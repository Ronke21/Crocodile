<text>Sharon Mitchell is an American sexologist and former pornographic film actress and director. In 1998, she founded the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation (AIM), which tested over 1,000 adult film performers per month before a 2011 data breach led to a lawsuit and the clinic&#x27;s closure.

==Early life and career==
An only child, Mitchell was adopted and raised Roman Catholic in Monmouth County, New Jersey. She married briefly at age 17 before becoming an off-Broadway actress and dancer, performing with the Martha Graham Dance Company. In the mid-1970s, she began appearing in pornographic films such as &quot;Captain Lust and the Pirate Women&quot; (1977), &quot;Sexcapades&quot; (1983), &quot;Water Power&quot; (1976), and &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones 2&quot; (1982). She also had small roles in mainstream films, such as &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978).

Mitchell made approximately 1,000 pornographic films over a 20-year career, including 38 as a director. She is the subject of the 1986 verité film &quot;Kamikaze Hearts&quot;, directed by Juliet Bashore, which follows her behind the scenes of a porn adaptation of Georges Bizet&#x27;s Carmen and explores her tumultuous relationship with then-girlfriend Tigr Mennett.
During her years in the adult industry, Mitchell developed a heroin addiction. 
In 1996, after a male stalker who was obsessed with her porn films assaulted, raped, and nearly killed her, she quit drugs, became a certified addiction counselor, and later obtained a MA and a PhD from the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality while working a variety of jobs including video engineer&#x27;s assistant, caterer, florist, dog walker, and maid.

In 1998, Mitchell founded the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation (AIM), an organization which provided information and STD testing to workers in adult entertainment. As of 2004, they were testing 1,200 pornography performers a month. According to the Associated Press, many in the adult industry credit her with raising the visibility of the risks of HIV/AIDS in the pornography industry. In 2011, a security breach led to over 12,000 adult performers&#x27; personal information being released publicly. A privacy breach lawsuit was filed against the institute, and they closed their doors in May 2011. Oversight of the protocol was assumed by the Free Speech Coalition.

==Awards==
Mitchell is a member of the AVN Hall of Fame and XRCO Hall of Fame (since 1988).

<doc id="638393" wikidata="Q20494" url="?curid=638393" title="Norcia">
<text>Norcia (), traditionally known in English by its Latin name of Nursia (), is a town and comune in the province of Perugia (Italy) in southeastern Umbria. Unlike many ancient towns, it is located in a wide plain abutting the Monti Sibillini, a subrange of the Apennines with some of its highest peaks, near the Sordo River, a small stream that eventually flows into the Nera. The town is popularly associated with the Valnerina (the valley of the Nera). It is a member of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

The area is known for its air and scenery, and is a base for mountaineering and hiking. It is also widely known for hunting, especially of the wild boar, and for sausages and ham made from wild boar and pork. Such products have been named after Norcia; in Italian, they are called &quot;norcineria&quot;.

== History ==
Traces of human settlement in Norcia&#x27;s area date back to the Neolithic Age.

The town&#x27;s known history begins with settlement by the Sabines in the 5th century BC. After the conquest by the Romans in the 3rd century BC, it was an ally of ancient Rome in 205 BC, during the Second Punic War, when it was known in Latin as Nursia, but the earliest extant Roman ruins date from around the 1st century. The renegade general Quintus Sertorius, who famously fought a guerrilla war in Spain against the Roman government (80–72 BC), was born in Nursia in &quot;c.&quot; 123 BC. Another famous Nursian of Roman times was Vespasia Polla (born &quot;c.&quot; 15 BC), the mother of the emperor Vespasian.

St. Benedict, the founder of the Benedictine monastic system, and his twin sister St. Scholastica, were born here in AD 480. In the 8th century, an oratory was built so pilgrims could pray at St. Benedict&#x27;s birthplace. Monks came to Norcia in the 10th century. Contemporary monks care for the Monastery of St. Benedict, built over the Roman ruins of the house of Sts. Benedict and Scholastica.

In the 6th century Norcia was conquered by the Lombards, becoming part of the Duchy of Spoleto. In the 9th century it suffered from Saracen attacks, which started a period of deep decadence. In the 11th century, it was part of the domain of St. Henry, Holy Roman Emperor. In the 12th century Norcia became an independent commune within the Papal territories, with an increasing political and economical prestige. The collaboration with the Benedictine abbey in Preci led to the creation of the &quot;Schola Chirurgica&quot;. Studies at this institution contributed to Norcia residents improving their swine breeding. The powerful Spoleto and the 1324 earthquake thwarted the city&#x27;s ambitions, and in 1354 it was returned definitively to the Papal authority.

On 24 August 2016, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake and numerous strong aftershocks struck near Norcia, causing major damage to the towns in the region. The people in the town of Norcia were not injured. The town of Norcia itself only suffered structural damage but this displaced many citizens. However, several small towns around the town received heavy damage and many collapsed buildings.

On 30 October 2016, another magnitude 6.5 earthquake rocked Norcia, causing heavy damage to the city: among other buildings, the nave of the Basilica of St. Benedict was destroyed.

==Main sights== 
The older core of Norcia is almost flat, which is relatively unusual among the towns of Umbria. It is completely enclosed by a full circuit of walls that has survived intact from the 14th century. They stood up despite many earthquakes, of which several were devastating (1763, 1859, 1979). After the earthquake of 22 August 1859, the Papal States, to which Norcia then belonged, imposed a stringent construction code forbidding structures of more than three storeys and requiring the use of certain materials and building techniques.

Roman vestiges are observable throughout the city, especially in the walls of San Lorenzo, its oldest extant church. On via Umberto is a small aedicule or corner chapel, sometimes called a tempietto, with faded frescoes, painted by Vanni della Tuccia in 1354. Of greater interest are the two Romanesque arches, densely sculpted with zoomorphic, human, and geometric forms.

The main basilica is dedicated to St. Benedict and is connected to a functioning Benedictine monastery, the Monastery of St. Benedict. Though this edifice was built in the 13th century, it stood on the remains of one or more small Roman buildings, sometimes considered to have been a Roman basilica, or alternately the house in which the twin saints were born. The façade, in Gothic style, is characterized by a central rose window and relief portraying the four Evangelists. Inside, the fresco of the &quot;Resurrection of Lazarus&quot; (1560) was painted by Michelangelo Carducci. The altar in the left-hand transept housed a &quot;St Benedict and Totila&quot; (1621) by Filippo Napoletano. The nave of the basilica was destroyed by an earthquake on 30 October 2016.

The Renaissance church of Santa Maria Argentea is the &quot;Duomo&quot; or cathedral. It holds some works by Flemish masters, a richly decorated altar by Duquesnoy, a &quot;Madonna and Saints&quot; by Pomarancio, and a &quot;St Vicent Ferrer and the Sick&quot; (1756) by Giuseppe Paladini.

The Gothic church of Sant&#x27;Agostino (14th century) has many votive frescoes of St Roch and St Sebastian. San Francesco, from the same century has a notable portal, surmounted by a Gothic rose window, with pink and white stone decorations.

A fortress, the Castellina was built in 1555–1563 as the residence of the Papal governors, as designed by Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola. It now houses a small museum with Roman and medieval artifacts, and documents of the Middle Ages and later periods.

In the &quot;frazioni&quot; near the town proper, are
*The &quot;pieve&quot; of San Salvatore, at Campi, with two rose windows and two portals of different ages. Also in Campi is the parish church of St. Andrew, with an original triangular loggiato. The Church of San Salvatore and that of Sant&#x27;Andrea were damaged or destroyed in the 2016 earthquake.
*The &quot;frazione&quot; of Savelli has the ruins of Madonna della Neve, an elegant octagonal church designed by Bramante in the 15th century. It was destroyed by the 1979 earthquake.
*In San Pellegrino is the convent of Santa Maria di Montesanto (14th century), now in poor condition. It has a noteworthy cloister and a church with 17th-century canvasses and a 14th-century wooden statue, &quot;Madonna with Child&quot;.

On 30 October 2016, a 6.6 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter near Norcia destroyed the nave of the basilica of St. Benedict Church as well as the town&#x27;s cathedral, with only the facade remaining.

<doc id="638394" wikidata="Q603467" url="?curid=638394" title="Pat Tiberi">
<text>Patrick Joseph Tiberi (; born October 21, 1962) is an American lobbyist and politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2001 to 2018. His district included communities north and east of Columbus. He is a member of the Republican Party, and previously served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1993 to 2000. He briefly served as Chair of the new Republican Main Street Congressional Caucus from September 7, 2017.

In October 2017, Tiberi announced his plan to resign from Congress in January 2018 to lead the Ohio Business Roundtable. His last day in office was January 15.

==Early life, education and career==
Tiberi was born in Columbus, Ohio, the son of Italian immigrants, Rina (Silvestri) and Joe Tiberi. He attended the city&#x27;s Woodward Park Middle school and Northland High School. Tiberi attended the Ohio State University, where he was a member of The Ohio State University Marching Band. He graduated from Ohio State in 1985 with a degree in journalism. Tiberi was the first person in his family to graduate from college. He was later awarded an honorary doctorate in the Humanities by Capital University in May 2005.

Upon graduation from college, Tiberi worked as a realtor for RE/MAX Achievers, a franchise of RE/MAX, located in Lewis Center, Ohio. He was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1993, and he soon rose to the position of House Majority Leader.

Tiberi is Catholic.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Tiberi authored legislation that made it easier for returning military veterans to receive federal jobs and provided for more federal assistance to caregivers of incapacitated adults. Both of the bills were passed in 2006.

Tiberi voted against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, saying the bill was &quot;loaded with Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s grab bag of big spending wishes.&quot; Following passage of the bill, Tiberi wrote a letter to United States Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack in an effort to bring stimulus money to his district.

Tiberi was described as loyal to former House Speaker John Boehner. When Boehner resigned his speakership and was replaced by Paul Ryan, Tiberi sought to replace Ryan as the chairperson of the United States House Committee on Ways and Means. The steering committee selected representative Kevin Brady over Tiberi to chair the committee. Ryan controlled five of the votes and reportedly supported Brady&#x27;s bid.

Tiberi was considered a potential candidate for the Republican Party&#x27;s nomination for the Senate in the 2018 election, but he declined to run. His large fundraising haul had fueled speculation of his possible entrance into the race.

=== Oversight of the executive branch ===

==== IRS ====

=====Targeting controversy=====
Tiberi spoke at a Ripon Society forum and addressed the IRS targeting controversy and tax reform. Tiberi said the IRS is one of the worst scandals he has seen in American history, stating that &quot;...it&#x27;s not like any other. It has Democrats, non-political independents, business owners, other individuals and people who don’t pay attention to government, kind of on their toes, because they know it can happen to them.&quot; Tiberi went on to say that the only way out was to show bipartisan partnership among the Administration in order to &quot;...get this scandal off the front page [and] working with Republicans to get comprehensive tax reform done in a way that simplifies our code.&quot;

===== Tax returns =====
Tiberi voted against an amendment by Bill Pascrell before the Ways and Means Committee to request President Trump&#x27;s federal income tax returns. He opposed the amendment as politically motivated and inviting a slippery slope. He said that Trump said &quot;he will release them, and I encourage him to do so.&quot;

==== Department of Justice ====
Tiberi said that President Trump&#x27;s firing of James Comey as the director of the FBI raised &quot;many questions&quot; amidst the FBI&#x27;s investigation over Russia&#x27;s involvement in the 2016 presidential election. Tiberi did not support the appointment of a special prosecutor to oversee the investigation. He said that he would support the appointment of a special prosecutor if the relevant congressional subcommittees recommended it.

===Constituent engagement===
Tiberi called town hall meetings &quot;not productive&quot; and &quot;shouting matches&quot;. He held town hall meetings, including one for Tea Party members of Newark in August 2011 and one on Iran in September 2015.

He cosponsored legislation that would require a commission to host town halls regarding reforms to Medicare and Social Security.

When asked by the &quot;Dispatch&quot; editorial board if he would hold &quot;a public, in-person town-hall meeting to answer questions from your constituents&quot;, Tiberi reiterated his opposition to town halls.

During the congressional recess of February 2017, Tiberi did not hold a town hall meeting to discuss healthcare reform with his constituents, but met in private with small groups. Prior to the recess, a constituent petition for a town hall with Tiberi surpassed 1,500 signatures. Over 200 small group meetings would be necessary to meet the demand of signatories alone. Constituents organized their own for February 22, 2017, and invited the congressman. Instead of attending the town hall, Tiberi delivered the keynote speech for a Knox County Republican Party fundraiser.

Tiberi does not represent Knox County as it is in Ohio&#x27;s 7th congressional district. He joined many of his Republican congressmen in refusing to schedule town halls over the February 2017 recess. Tiberi maintained that he was both &quot;the most accessible Congressman [his constituents have] ever had&quot; and &quot;one of the most accessible members of Congress.&quot; Tiberi&#x27;s claim was questioned when his colleague Representative Joyce Beatty appeared at a town hall the previous night whereas he failed to appear at a citizen-led event. Tiberi, following a majority of his Republican colleagues in the House, did not hold a public meeting with constituents during the May 2017 recess, instead he joined Speaker Paul Ryan at a roundtable with businessmen and a Republican fundraiser at the home of Les Wexner.

One of Tiberi&#x27;s claims in communications to his constituents about the Affordable Care Act was cited as an example of false claims lawmakers made about the healthcare law. The analysis was conducted by the publications Vox.com, ProPublica, &quot;Kaiser Health News&quot;, and Stat. Tiberi claimed that &quot;in Ohio, almost one third of counties will have only one insurer participating in the exchange.&quot; The analysis concluded that this was true of 23% of counties in Ohio.

==Political positions==

===Health care===
Tiberi was critical of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and expressed agreement with House Speaker Paul Ryan&#x27;s framework to replace it. On February 17, 2017, Tiberi told the Ripon Society that his plan to change the ACA was more complex than a single piece of legislation. It involved relying on the regulatory power of Tom Price as HHS Secretary, the budget reconciliation process, and bipartisan legislation. His comments also suggested that he no longer thought a full repeal of the ACA was necessary. He said &quot;it&#x27;s not just about repealing. Maybe it&#x27;s about modifying some provisions of the Affordable Care Act.&quot; The conservative Club for Growth ran a television ad criticizing Tiberi for his positions on healthcare. The ad accused Tiberi of blocking President Trump&#x27;s efforts to repeal the ACA. Tiberi refused to hold town hall meetings to discuss healthcare policy during the February and Easter 2017 congressional recesses.

====Medicaid expansion====
Tiberi&#x27;s proposed replacement of the ACA would have defunded the Medicaid expansion. This position was opposed by his seat&#x27;s predecessor and Ohio Governor, John Kasich, who called eliminating Medicaid coverage for 700,000 Ohioans &quot;a very, very bad idea, because we cannot turn our back on the most vulnerable.&quot; The cuts to Medicaid were estimated to cost Ohio between $16–18 billion and would cut services to children in special education.

====Pre-existing conditions====
The ACA prevents health insurance companies from both denying coverage and increasing premiums for individuals on the basis of pre-existing medical conditions. Tiberi co-sponsored legislation with Greg Walden to prevent this practice in the event that the ACA is repealed. According to Joseph Antos of the American Enterprise Institute, this policy would be difficult to pair with a repeal of the ACA. This is because without the individual mandate of the ACA, persons with pre-existing conditions would make up a disproportionate amount of the insured pool and drive up insurance premiums. Additionally, an amendment to the AHCA would allow states to waive the requirement that insurers not charge those with pre-existing conditions higher premiums.

====Employer-sponsored insurance====
As part of the repeal, Tiberi considered taxing some health benefits provided by employers.

The AHCA bill allows states to eliminate essential health benefits. This removes the protections for employer-provided insurance that limited copayment amounts and lifetime limits.

====American Health Care Act====
Tiberi supported the AHCA bill that would partially repeal and replace the ACA through the budget reconciliation process. Among other things, it replaces the individual mandate with a surcharge for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage, substitutes means-tested subsidies for insurance premiums with fixed refundable tax credits tied to age, and repeals taxes on those making over $250,000. For an earlier version of the bill, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that these provisions, together with the cuts to Medicaid and the elimination of its expansion, would have led to a loss of insurance for 24 million. An analysis of the CBO report by the progressive advocacy group Center for American Progress estimated that 39,500 of those who will lose insurance would come from the congressman&#x27;s own district. Tiberi praised the CBO report.

The legislation was privately constructed before it was debated by Ways and Means and the Energy and Commerce committees. After 18 hours of debate, Tiberi voted the legislation out of the Ways and Means Committee at 4:30 am on March 9, 2017. The initial version of the bill was not brought to the House floor for a vote.

Tiberi voted for an amended version of the bill that passed the House on May 4, 2017. The amended version exempts Congress from the elimination of essential health benefit protections for the general public. The vote occurred less than 24 hours after the final version was publicly available and before the CBO was able to analyze its cost and consequences. Following the vote, congressional Republicans celebrated the vote with President Trump in the Rose Garden, but Tiberi was not in attendance. The CBO analysis of the final version Tiberi voted for concluded that the legislation would cause 23 million to be left without health insurance, including one million Ohioans.

===Privacy===
Tiberi voted to repeal Internet privacy rules established by the FCC. The repeal of the rule was done using the Congressional Review Act. The rule would have allowed ISPs to sell customers&#x27; private browsing information only if they consented to such use. Tiberi&#x27;s only public statement on the issue was a tweet to an opinion article on Forbes&#x27; website. A YouGov poll showed that 71% of Americans disapproved of the repeal, while 12% supported it.

===Labor===
Tiberi voted to eliminate rules in the Fair Labor Standards Act that required time-and-a-half compensation for working overtime. The legislation allows employers to instead compensate overtime work with time off.

===Older Americans Act===
Then-chairman of the Select Education Subcommittee, Tiberi wrote the bill that reauthorized the Older Americans Act through fiscal year 2011. This bill provides most of the funding for social services and nutritional programs for the nation&#x27;s seniors. Tiberi received an 86 from the Retire Safe-Positions and a 10 from Alliance for Retired Americans-Lifetime Score. Tiberi wrote and sponsored the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006. Tiberi supported a full repeal of Obamacare, saying &quot;government has no place in getting between a patient&#x27;s relationship with their doctor.&quot;

===Education reform===
Tiberi supported reform to the No Child Left Behind bill. He introduced legislation to improve local flexibility by allowing some school districts to go to the Secretary of Education and present their own plan for the allocation of Title 1 federal funding for approval. This amendment was signed into law in 2002. During the 109th Congress, Tiberi served as the Chair the Education and Workforce Subcommittee on Select Education—a subcommittee with jurisdiction over issues related to international and graduate education programs. The Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)-Positions rated Tiberi at 50%.

===Government reform===
During his first congressional campaign, Tiberi made the campaign promise to make government more accountable to citizens. During the 110th Congress he supported proposed reforms to make earmarks, lines inserted into a bill that direct money to a member of Congress, more transparent. Tiberi&#x27;s goal was to introduce reform to give the president the authority to rid congressional bill of unrelated spending in bills. Tiberi also wanted to bring reform through a searchable database that would include an assessment of every piece of federal funding and the Education Oversight Subcommittee that he was appointed Vice-Chairman to in his first year in Congress. Citizens Against Government Waste-Positions gave Tiberi a 78% rating.

==Legislation==

===School safety===
Tiberi introduced a bill with Rep. Ron Kind (D-WI) that gives a tax credit to law enforcement officers for any income they earn doing substitute teaching. Tiberi and Kind introduced the bill as one way to add security to schools. The bill was introduced in Washington, D.C., on April 12.

=== Workforce ===
In 2014, Tiberi cosponsored legislation called the Save American Workers Act of 2013 that would make a 40 hours, instead of 30, the standard definition of full-time work.

=== Tax policy ===
On April 10, 2014, Tiberi introduced the America&#x27;s Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2014 (H.R. 4457; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code, which mostly affects small- to medium-sized businesses, to retroactively and permanently extend from January 1, 2014, increased the cap on the amount of investment that can be immediately deducted from taxable income. The bill would return the tax code to its 2013 status and make the change permanent.

==Political campaigns==
===2000===

Tiberi ran for and won the House seat that was vacated by nine-term incumbent and House Budget Committee chairman John Kasich, who retired to work as a consultant for Lehman Brothers. He won by nine points in a district that had long been considered to be far friendlier to the Democrats than the neighboring 15th, despite Kasich&#x27;s long tenure. However, Tiberi never faced another contest nearly that close, in part because his district was redrawn after the 2000 census.

===2006===

Tiberi won reelection after defeating former Democratic Congressman Bob Shamansky.

===2008===

Tiberi defeated Democrat David Robinson.

===2010===

Tiberi defeated Democratic nominee Franklin County Commissioner Paula Brooks in the general election.

===2012===
Redistricting made the 12th much more secure for Tiberi. For his first six terms, Tiberi represented a fairly compact district centered around eastern Columbus, as well as most of the northern suburbs. However, the new map pushed the district into more Republican areas north and east of the Columbus area. Tiberi defeated Democratic nominee James Reese and Green party nominee Robert Fitrakis in the general election.

===2016===

Tiberi defeated Democratic nominee Ed Albertson and Green party nominee Joe Manchik in the general election.

==Electoral history==

*Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 2000, Charles Ed Jordan received 1,556 votes (0.60%). In 2004, Chuck Spingola received 25 votes. In 2016, John J. Baumeister received 156 votes.

==Italian knighthood==
Tiberi received the title of Knight, which was conferred by the Italian ambassador to the United States Claudio Bisogniero, in the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, in May 2013. The Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (Italian: Ordine al merito della Repubblica Italiana) was founded as the senior order of knighthood by the second President of the Italian Republic, Luigi Einaudi, in 1951.

<text>The Alabama–Auburn football rivalry, better known as the Iron Bowl, is an American college football rivalry game between the University of Alabama Crimson Tide and the Auburn University Tigers, both charter members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and both teams are located in the state of Alabama. The series is considered one of the most important football rivalries in American sports. The rivalry, which started in 1893, was played for many years at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. In the early 20th Century, Birmingham was the leading industrial city of the South, rivaling Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the production of pig iron, coke, coal and the manufacture of steel. Thus, the term &quot;Iron Bowl&quot; came to represent the rivalry. Auburn Coach Ralph &quot;Shug&quot; Jordan is credited with actually coining it—when asked by reporters in 1964 how he would deal with the disappointment of not taking his team to a bowl game, he responded, &quot;We&#x27;ve got our bowl game. We have it every year. It&#x27;s the Iron Bowl in Birmingham.&quot;

The game was traditionally played on Thanksgiving weekend, but in 1993, the schools agreed to move the game up to the week before Thanksgiving to give themselves a bye for a potential SEC Championship Game berth after the game was introduced in the 1992 season. In 2007 the conference voted to disallow any team from having a bye before the league championship game, returning the game to its traditional Thanksgiving weekend spot.

The rivalry has long been one of the most heated collegiate rivalries in the country. It is all the more heated because the two schools have been among the nation&#x27;s elite teams for most of the time since the 1950s. Together, they account for 38 SEC titles, 30 by Alabama and 8 by Auburn. Both are among the most successful programs in major college football history; Alabama is third in all-time total wins among Division I FBS schools while Auburn is 13th. The two schools have been fixtures on national television since the late 1970s; the only time since then that the season-ending clash has not been nationally televised was in 1993, when Auburn was barred from live TV due to NCAA sanctions. Alabama leads the series with a record of 51–37–1.

For much of the 20th century, the game was played every year in Birmingham, with Alabama winning 34 games and Auburn 18. Four games were played in Montgomery, Alabama, with each team winning two. In Birmingham&#x27;s Legion Field, tickets were evenly divided between the two schools. In even years, Alabama was designated as home team and Auburn was the home team in odd-numbered years. Auburn broke with tradition in 1989, opting to move the game to its home stadium for the first time. The Tigers agreed to play one additional game as home team in Birmingham in 1991 before moving its home games permanently to Jordan-Hare Stadium in Auburn beginning in 1993. Alabama continued scheduling its home games in the series in Birmingham through the 1998 season before moving its home games to Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa permanently beginning in 2000.

==History==

The contest became the extension of a bitter political debate which took place in the Alabama State Legislature regarding the location of the new land-grant college under the state&#x27;s application under the Morrill Land Grant Act of 1862 during the Civil War Reconstruction Era. The state legislature, influenced by a heavy contingent of representatives who were University of Alabama alumni, pushed to sell the land scripts of 240,000 acres acquired from the Morrill Act or have any new land holdings held in conjunction with the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. The debate lasted over four years, until Lee County and the City of Auburn won the location of the new university in 1872, after donating more than a hundred acres and the remaining buildings and property of the East Alabama Male College. At the time of the Auburn decision the state legislature and governorship were controlled by Radical Republicans such as &quot;Scalawag&quot; Southern Republicans and Freedman African-Americans. By 1874, former Confederate and &quot;Redeemer&quot; forces from the Democratic Party gradually overturned the Radicals&#x27; control of the Alabama state legislature. The Democrats then attempted to overturn most legislation passed during the Reconstruction Period, including the founding of the new land-grant college at Auburn.

During the 1870s, Auburn (then named the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama) which received no appropriated funds from the state, was on the edge of financial collapse. Collapse of Auburn meant that the University of Alabama could assume the remaining land scripts, thus profiting from the closure of the new land-grant college. The University of Alabama remained closed till 1871 following the Civil War, during which it was partially destroyed by Union forces. &quot;By 1877, competition between the University of Alabama and the Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College for patronage had intensified. In January, Auburn President Isaac Tichenor reported to the board of trustees that Alabama had reduced its tuition and lowered its graduation standards. Tichenor responded by requesting that the board drop tuition and create a boarding department to further lower expenses.&quot; The University of Alabama had developed a reciprocal interest in the Alabama Coal Operators Association along with their “Big Mule” allies with vast timber holdings across the Black Belt of Alabama.

Alabama and Auburn played their first football game in Lakeview Park in Birmingham, Alabama, on February 22, 1893. Auburn won 32–22, before an estimated crowd of 5,000. Alabama considered the game to be the final matchup of the 1892 season while Auburn recorded it as the first matchup of 1893.

In 1902, a bill was introduced into both houses of the U.S. Congress to fund the creation of a &quot;School of Mines and Mining Engineering&quot; at each land-grant college. Under the provision of the bill, each participating land-grant college would receive $5,000 annually with $500 each additional year for 10 years. The University of Alabama secretly sent Professor Dr. Eugene Smith to lobby against passage of the bill or to amend the bill to allow other universities to participate in the federal program. Auburn responded by sending Professor C.C. Thach to D.C. to lobby with the Association of Land-Grant Colleges for a compromise to allow passage of the bill. The bill would later fail to receive passage.

During the 1907 state legislature session, a debate surfaced to move the land-grant college from Auburn to Birmingham.

One constant during the rivalry hiatus was Auburn&#x27;s Coach Mike Donahue. Donahue became a fixture at Auburn, coaching football from 1904 to 1922 along with basketball from 1905 to 1921 while also ascending to the position of athletic director. The first basketball game between Auburn and Alabama was by chance occurring in 1924 in the Southern Conference Tournament. This would be the only basketball matchup till 1941 which again was by chance in another conference tournament.

During the 1930s and into the 1940s while the football rivalry was in hiatus, Auburn under the leadership of President Duncan, became the administrative home for several New Deal agencies: the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the Soil Conservation Service, and the Resettlement Administration. The federal Government funding flowing into Auburn soon drew the ire of the University of Alabama trustees and their partisans in the Alabama Legislature. President Duncan was able to influence the placement of these agencies at Auburn due to his support for Governor Bibb Graves. 
Both the president and the governor supported the New Deal faction of the Democratic Party in Alabama. Graves was well connected in Washington D.C., with President Franklin D. Roosevelt and often lobbied in D.C. on &quot;plum-tree-shaking expeditions&quot;. Meanwhile, Duncan with his connections in the Alabama Farm Bureau and as the director of the Extension Service exercised great control over the organized farm vote. By the mid-1940s, the Democratic Party was splintering in Alabama, with the rise of the Dixiecrats and those who remained loyal to the national party. One of the most outspoken critics of Auburn was publisher Harry Ayers, who would later endorse Harry Truman in 1945. In 1940 Duncan had successfully opposed Ayers&#x27; candidacy as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, which deeply offended the publisher. The Anniston editor had been a long-time advocate of consolidating Auburn and Alabama, &quot;so that Auburn would become the dangling tail of a Tuscaloosa kite&quot;. In August 1942, President Duncan wrote to Raymond Paty, the newly appointed president of the University of Alabama, that the relationship between their two schools was &quot;of such magnitude and gravity&quot; that he had given the question more attention than any other problem he faced as president. He urged Paty that Auburn and Alabama should agree upon a funding formula that would give each institution the same appropriation per in-state student, an idea which worked against the University of Alabama&#x27;s self-image as the state&#x27;s capstone university.

During a 1945 legislative session, the University of Alabama&#x27;s report to the commission (Alabama Educational Survey Commission) argued that the Tuscaloosa school had well-established and broad responsibilities for higher education in the state. Four times in Alabama history, higher education responsibilities had been delegated to other institutions. In three of the four cases, this occurred under a state government established during the Reconstruction period: creation of the normal schools, higher education for blacks, and establishment of the land-grant college at Auburn. The fourth case was the state women&#x27;s college at Montevallo. In each case, this was argued to have resulted from &quot;the illogic inherent in the evolution of a democratic government&quot;. The Alabama report drew a sharp response from then Auburn President Luther Duncan, who said that he had never seen &quot;a bolder, more deliberate, more vicious, or more deceptive document&quot;. He predicted that if the friends of Auburn and Montevallo did not rise up to combat &quot;this evil monster&quot;, it would consume them &quot;just like the doctrine of Hitler&quot;. Duncan also remarked that according to Alabama, &quot;Auburn is the illegitimate children... born out of the misery of the Reconstruction period.&quot;

By 1945, with the end of World War II, the GI Bill had inundated Auburn (then officially named the Alabama Polytechnic Institute), with students—doubling enrollment twice between 1944 and 1948. With the increased enrollment, it was now obvious that Auburn would never &quot;become so weak that... it could be absorbed&quot; by the University of Alabama.

In March 1947, the Auburn Board of Trustees, with Governor Jim Folsom in attendance, unanimously approved the following resolution, &quot;Whereas, The Alabama Polytechnic Institute and the University of Alabama are important educational institutions of the State of Alabama and are maintained and operated by the people of the State; and Whereas, many years ago athletic relationship between the Alabama Polytechnic Institute and the University of Alabama was discontinued; and Whereas, intercollegiate rivalry between the two institutions would be conducive to a better understanding among students of both schools and would tend to promote interest in athletic engagements in Alabama, therefore Be It Resolved by the Board of Trustees of Alabama Polytechnic Institute in meeting assembled, that the President of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute, through its Athletic Director, make necessary negotiation with the Director of Athletics of the University of Alabama to resume athletic competition between the two institutions at the earliest possible date, and that a copy of this resolution be furnished to the President and Athletic Director of the University of Alabama.&quot; The Governor then suggested that the game be played not later than the first Saturday in December 1947.
Also during 1947, the Alabama House of Representatives passed a resolution encouraging both universities to &quot;make possible the inauguration of a full athletic program between the two schools&quot;. But the resolution did not have the effect of law, the schools still could not agree, the Legislature threatened to withhold state funding. In April 1948, Alabama president John Gallalee and Auburn president Ralph B. Draughon met and agreed to renew the series in 1948 and for the following 1949 season.

It was agreed that the games would be played as a neutral site series in Birmingham. Legion Field held 47,000 fans in 1948, dwarfing both Tuscaloosa&#x27;s Denny Stadium (31,000) and Auburn Stadium (15,000; expanded to 21,500 and renamed Cliff Hare Stadium in 1949). Also, it is believed Alabama refused to travel to Auburn, citing poor roads and the small size of Hare Stadium. Alabama was joined in this sentiment by the Tennessee Volunteers (who refused to play in Auburn until 1974) and Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (who did not travel to Auburn from 1900 to 1970). Auburn played its last home game at Legion Field, outside of the Iron Bowl, in 1978 against Tennessee.

Between 1969 and 1987, Auburn made additions to Jordan-Hare Stadium until it eclipsed Legion Field in size. Auburn was in the process of expanding Jordan-Hare Stadium from 72,169 seats to 85,214 for the 1987 season, almost 10,000 more than 75,808-seat Legion Field. (Alabama&#x27;s Bryant-Denny Stadium then seated a little over 60,000, but expanded to 70,123 in 1988.) By the late 1970s, Auburn fans began feeling chagrin at playing all Iron Bowl games at Legion Field. Despite the equal allotment of tickets, Auburn fans insisted that Legion Field was not a neutral site. While Auburn played many of their most important rivalry games in Birmingham for most of the 20th century (among those were Georgia Tech and Tennessee), Legion Field had long been associated with Alabama football in Auburn&#x27;s eyes. Well into the 1980s, Alabama played most of its important games in Birmingham—most of Alabama&#x27;s &quot;home&quot; football history from the 1920s to the 1980s actually took place at Legion Field. Mainly for business reasons, Auburn began lobbying to make the Iron Bowl a &quot;home-and-home&quot; series. When Pat Dye became Auburn&#x27;s head football coach and athletics director in 1981, he met with his longtime mentor, Alabama head coach and athletic director Bear Bryant. Dye recalled that at that meeting, &quot;the first thing he said to me, very first thing, he said, &#x27;Well, I guess you&#x27;re going to want to take that game to Auburn.&#x27;&quot; Dye confirmed that hunch, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re going to take it to Auburn.&quot; When Bryant noted that the schools&#x27; contract with Legion Field ran through 1988, Dye replied, &quot;Well, we&#x27;ll play 89 in Auburn.&quot; Although Auburn would have possibly been within its rights to move its home games to Jordan-Hare as early as 1983, Dye knew that Bryant was adamantly opposed to playing &quot;any&quot; Iron Bowl games in Auburn. He knew Bryant&#x27;s standing in the state was such that it would be folly to attempt making the Iron Bowl a home-and-home series as long as Bryant was still alive.

In the late 80s, the schools agreed that Auburn could play their home games for the Iron Bowl at Jordan-Hare starting in 1989 (with the exception of 1991) and Alabama would continue to play its &quot;home&quot; games at Legion Field. On December 2, 1989, Alabama came to &quot;the Plains&quot; for the first time ever as a sellout crowd witnessed Auburn win its first true &quot;home&quot; game of the series, 30–20 over an Alabama team that entered the game undefeated and ranked No.2 in the country.

Alabama continued to hold its home games for the rivalry at Legion Field. In 1998, Alabama expanded Bryant–Denny Stadium to a capacity of 83,818, narrowly eclipsing Legion Field. Alabama then began moving most of its more important home games to Tuscaloosa, and finally their Iron Bowl home games to Bryant–Denny Stadium in 2000. That year, Auburn came to Tuscaloosa for the first time since 1901 and won in a defensive struggle, 9–0. A new attendance record for the Iron Bowl was set in 2006 as the latest expansion to Bryant–Denny Stadium increased its capacity to 92,138. The record was reset again in 2010, after another expansion to Alabama&#x27;s Bryant–Denny Stadium, when a crowd of 101,821 witnessed a 28–27 Auburn victory.

===Broadcasters===

In 2009 and 2010 CBS Sports and the two universities arranged to have the game played in an exclusive time slot on the Friday following Thanksgiving. The 2009 game was the sixth Iron Bowl to be played on a Friday and the first one in 21 years. CBS did not attempt to renew the agreement after 2010 due to criticism from both fan bases, returning the game to its traditional Saturday date. Although CBS has broadcast the majority of Iron Bowl games since 1996 through its SEC coverage, ESPN has aired the game several times, from 1995 through 1999, 2003, and 2007. In 2014, CBS&#x27;s decision to broadcast the Egg Bowl due to a number of factors (which included contractual limits on how many times CBS may feature certain teams, and the larger prominence of the Egg Bowl due to its potential effects on Mississippi State&#x27;s participation in the College Football Playoff) resulted in ESPN broadcasting the first Iron Bowl played in primetime since 2007.

==Foy–ODK Trophy==

The Foy–ODK Trophy is named after James E. Foy, a former dean of student affairs at both schools, and Omicron Delta Kappa, an honor society on both campuses since the 1920s. In 1948 Omicron Delta Kappa fraternity sponsored the purchase of the trophy. The trophy is presented at halftime of the Alabama–Auburn basketball game later in the same academic year at the winner&#x27;s home court, where the SGA President of the losing football team traditionally sings the winning team&#x27;s fight song.

==Notable games==

=== 1904: Donahue&#x27;s first season ===
On November 12, Auburn coach Mike Donahue defeated Alabama in his first season, the purpose for his hiring.

=== 1906: Burks scores ===
Alabama&#x27;s star running back Auxford Burks scored all the game&#x27;s points in a 10–0 victory. Auburn contended that Alabama player T. S. Sims was an illegal player, but the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) denied the claim. Alabama coach Doc Pollard used a &quot;military shift&quot; never before seen in the south to gain an advantage over Auburn.

=== 1948: Rivalry returns ===
The rivalry resumed after being suspended for 41 years due to issues related to player per diems and officiating. Alabama beat Auburn 55–0 at Legion Field, which remains the largest margin of victory in series history.

=== 1964: First game on TV ===
In the first Iron Bowl broadcast on national television, quarterback Joe Namath led Alabama to a 21–14 victory over Auburn.

=== 1967: Run in the Mud ===
Alabama defeated Auburn 7–3 in rainy conditions at Legion Field behind Ken Stabler&#x27;s 47-yard &quot;Run in the Mud&quot; for the game&#x27;s only touchdown in the fourth quarter.

=== 1972: Punt Bama Punt! ===
Down 16–3 late in the game, Auburn blocked two punts and returned both for touchdowns, leading to an improbable 17–16 Auburn win and the coining of a new phrase among Auburn fans, &quot;Punt Bama Punt!&quot; In August 2010, ESPN.com ranked this game the 8th most painful outcome in college football history. Alabama would go on to win the next nine games in a row (1973–1981), known to Auburn fans as the &quot;Reign of Terror&quot;.

=== 1981: Bryant becomes all-time winningest coach ===
Coach Bear Bryant earned his 315th career win after Alabama defeated Auburn 28–17. With the victory, Bryant passed Amos Alonzo Stagg to become the all-time winningest FBS coach at the time. This was the final game in Alabama&#x27;s nine-game winning streak over Auburn, the longest streak in Iron Bowl history.

=== 1982: Bo Over The Top ===
Entering the game, Auburn had a nine-year losing streak versus Alabama. Freshman Bo Jackson leaped over the line of scrimmage on a fourth-down play from the one-yard line to score the winning touchdown.

=== 1984: Wrong Way Bo ===
Trailing 17–15 late in the game, Auburn had 4th-and-goal from the one-yard line. Opting to go for it, Auburn called a pitch to running back Brent Fullwood. Running back Bo Jackson, who was supposed to block for Fullwood, ran in the wrong direction, allowing the Alabama defense to easily push Fullwood out of bounds short of the goal line to seal the victory. The play and game are sometimes referred to as &quot;Wrong Way Bo&quot;.

=== 1985: The Kick ===
Alabama beat Auburn 25–23 on a 52-yard field goal by Van Tiffin as time expired. A close game was elevated by the &quot;epic&quot; fourth quarter &quot;with the teams trading haymakers and the lead changing hands four times.&quot; Alabama drove from their own 20-yard-line in the final minute, including a fourth-down flanker reverse to keep the drive alive. As recently as 2015, longtime sports reporter Paul Finebaum remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s still the greatest football game I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; The play is often referred to as &quot;the Kick&quot;.

=== December 2, 1989 ===
On December 2, 1989, for the first time in the history of the series, the Iron Bowl was played in Auburn&#x27;s Jordan-Hare stadium. Auburn won 30–20.

=== 1993 ===
No. 6 Auburn defeated No. 11 Alabama 22–14 to finish the season undefeated at 11–0. The game, at Jordan Hare Stadium, was not televised due to Auburn&#x27;s probation but was shown on closed-circuit television before 47,421 fans at Bryant–Denny Stadium.

=== 1997: Holmes field goal wins it ===
Alabama fullback Ed Scissum fumbled on a screen pass that was meant to give the underdog Crimson Tide a game-sealing first down. Auburn kicker Jaret Holmes converted a go-ahead 39-yard field goal, and Alabama&#x27;s last-chance attempt from 57 yards fell well short to give Auburn the SEC Western Division title. Auburn radio announcer Jim Fyffe is remembered by his dramatic call of the game winning field goal &quot;long enough, high enough, It&#x27;s good! it&#x27;s good! it&#x27;s good! it&#x27;s good! it&#x27;s good! it&#x27;s good!&quot; 

=== 2000: First Game in Tuscaloosa ===
In the first Iron Bowl played in Bryant–Denny Stadium and the first played in Tuscaloosa since 1901, Auburn kicked three field goals to beat Alabama 9–0. This would be Mike Dubose&#x27;s final game as Alabama head coach. It is also to date the last time Alabama has been shut out in any game.

=== 2010: The Camback ===
No. 2 Auburn defeated No. 11 Alabama 28–27 in Tuscaloosa after erasing a 24–0 deficit — the largest comeback win in series history — led by Auburn&#x27;s Heisman winning quarterback, Cam Newton. &quot;The Camback&quot; preserved Auburn&#x27;s undefeated season, which eventually resulted in Auburn&#x27;s second national championship. This is arguably the most contentious meeting in the rivalry&#x27;s history, with Auburn fans decorating Bear Bryant&#x27;s statue with a Cam Newton jersey, and an Alabama fan, Harvey Updyke, poisoning the famous oak trees at Toomer&#x27;s Corner.

=== 2013: The Kick Six ===

No. 4 Auburn defeated No. 1 Alabama 34–28. With one second remaining and the game tied 28–28, Alabama&#x27;s freshman kicker Adam Griffith attempted a 57-yard potential game-winning field goal. The kick fell short, and Auburn cornerback Chris Davis caught the ball at the back of the endzone and returned it 109 yards for the game-winning touchdown as time expired in what became known as the &quot;Kick Six&quot; game. The 2013 Iron Bowl won the ESPY Award for &quot;Best Game&quot; of the year in any sport, and the final play by Davis won the ESPY Award for &quot;Best Play&quot; of the year.

=== 2014: High score ===
No. 1 Alabama defeated No. 15 Auburn 55–44, the highest scoring Iron Bowl ever.

=== 2018: Tagovailoa scores six touchdowns ===
No. 1 Alabama defeated unranked Auburn 52–21, led by sophomore quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, who passed for five touchdowns and ran for one more. It would be the first time that an Alabama player would account for six touchdowns in a single game.

=== 2019 ===
No. 15 Auburn defeated No. 5 Alabama, 48–45, in a classic back-and-forth match. After losing starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa to injury a few weeks earlier, sophomore Mac Jones would be asked to step in against the Tigers. Auburn intercepted Jones twice, returning both for touchdowns. Alabama missed a game-tying field goal late in the fourth quarter, but forced an Auburn fourth down on the next possession with just 1:04 remaining on the clock. Auburn lined up in a formation with the punter out wide which confused the defense and led to an Alabama penalty for having too many players on the field. The five-yard penalty gave Auburn a first down and allowed the Tigers to run out the clock. With the loss, Alabama was knocked out of playoff contention for the first time since the creation of the four-team format in 2014. This loss also marked the first time Alabama had two or more regular-season losses since 2010.

=== 2021: Overtime ===
No. 3 Alabama defeated unranked Auburn 24–22 in a four-overtime game. Auburn starting quarterback Bo Nix did not play due to an ankle injury. After allowing seven sacks and committing eleven penalties, Alabama trailed 10–3 with 1:43 remaining. The Tide, led by quarterback Bryce Young, drove 97 yards for a game-tying touchdown to force the first overtime game in Iron Bowl history. (Although the rivalry game had been played 86 times, dating back to 1893, overtime in college football was instituted beginning with bowl games after the 1995 season.)
=== 2023: Fourth and 31 ===
No. 8 Alabama defeated unranked Auburn 27–24. Alabama trailed 24–20 with a 4th and goal on the 31 yard line. Crimson Tide quarterback Jalen Milroe threw a game-winning touchdown pass to Isaiah Bond with 32 seconds left. The win gave Alabama its longest win streak against Auburn since they won nine in a row from 1973 to 1982. Bond later referred to the play as &quot;Grave Digger,&quot; while others dubbed the play &quot;Fourth and 31&quot;.

==Game results==

Since 1893, the Crimson Tide and Tigers have played 89 times. Alabama leads the series 51–37–1. The game has been played in four cities: Auburn, Birmingham, Montgomery, and Tuscaloosa. Alabama leads the series in Birmingham (34–18–1) and Tuscaloosa (8–7). Auburn leads the series in Auburn (10–7). The series is tied in Montgomery (2–2). Alabama leads the series since it was resumed in the modern era in 1948 (47–30). For the first time in the series history, five consecutive Iron Bowl winners went to the BCS National Championship Game: Alabama in 2009, Auburn in 2010, and Alabama again in 2011 and 2012. Auburn also went in 2013, but lost to Florida State. Alabama&#x27;s 2009 BCS National Championship followed by Auburn&#x27;s 2010 BCS National Championship marks the first time that two different teams from the same state won consecutive BCS National Championships. One of the teams from this rivalry has gone to the BCS or CFP 12 times in 13 years from 2009 to 2021, with Alabama going 10 times (2009, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021) and winning 6 (2009, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2017, 2020) and Auburn going twice (2010, 2013) and winning once (2010).

<doc id="638406" wikidata="Q3275725" url="?curid=638406" title="The Story of Little Black Sambo">
<text>The Story of Little Black Sambo is a children&#x27;s book written and illustrated by Scottish author Helen Bannerman and published by Grant Richards in October 1899. As one in a series of small-format books called The Dumpy Books for Children, the story was popular for more than half a century.

Contemporary critics observed that Bannerman presented one of the first black heroes in children&#x27;s literature and regarded the book as positively portraying black characters in both the text and pictures, especially in comparison to books of that era that depicted black people as simple and uncivilised. However, it became an object of allegations of racism in the mid-20th century due to the names of the characters being racial slurs for dark-skinned people, and the fact that the illustrations were, as Langston Hughes expressed it, in the pickaninny style. In more recent editions, both text and illustrations have undergone considerable revision.

==Plot==
Sambo is a South Indian boy who lives with his father and mother, named Black Jumbo and Black Mumbo respectively. While out walking, Sambo encounters four hungry tigers, and he surrenders his colourful new clothes, shoes and umbrella so that they will not eat him. The tigers are vain and each thinks that it is better dressed than the others. They have a massive argument and chase each other around a tree until they are reduced to a pool of ghee (clarified butter). Sambo recovers his clothes and goes home, and his father later collects the ghee, which his mother uses to make pancakes.

==Controversy==
The book&#x27;s original illustrations were created by the author and were simple in style, and depicted Sambo as a Southern Indian or Tamil child. &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot;″s success led to many counterfeit, inexpensive, easily available versions that incorporated popular stereotypes of &quot;black&quot; peoples. One example was a 1908 edition illustrated by John R. Neill, best known for his illustration of the Oz books by L. Frank Baum. In 1932, Langston Hughes criticised &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot; as a typical &quot;pickaninny&quot; storybook which was hurtful to black children, and gradually the book disappeared from lists of recommended stories for children.

In 1942, Saalfield Publishing Company released a version of &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot; illustrated by Ethel Hays. In 1943, Julian Wehr created an animated version. During the mid-20th century, some American editions of the story, including a 1950 audio version on Peter Pan Records, changed the title to the racially neutral &quot;Little Brave Sambo&quot;.

The book is beloved in Japan and is not widely considered controversial there. was first published in Japan by Iwanami Shoten Publishing in 1953. The book was an unlicensed version of the original, and it contained drawings by Frank Dobias that had appeared in a U.S. edition published by Macmillan Publishers in 1927. Sambo was illustrated as an African boy rather than an Indian boy. Although it did not contain Bannerman&#x27;s original illustrations, this book was long mistaken for the original version in Japan. It sold over 1,000,000 copies before it was removed from shelves in 1988, when The Association to Stop Racism Against Blacks launched a complaint against all major publishers in Japan that published variations of the story, which, in turn, triggered self-censorship among those publishers. In 2005, after copyright of the 1953 Iwanami Shoten Publishing edition of the book expired, Zuiunsya reprinted the original version and sold more than 150,000 copies within five months&#x27; time, and Kodansha and Shogakukan, the two largest publishers in Japan, published official editions. These are still in print, and as of August 2011, an equally controversial &quot;side story&quot; for &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot;, called &quot;Ufu and Mufu&quot;, is being sold and merchandised in Japan. The reprinting caused criticism from media outside Japan, such as the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

==Modern versions==
In 1959, Whitman Publishing Company released an edition illustrated by Violet LaMont. Her colorful pictures show an Indian family wearing bright Indian clothes. The story of the boy and the tigers is as described in the plot section above.
In 1996, illustrator Fred Marcellino observed that the story itself contained no racist overtones and produced a re-illustrated version, &quot;The Story of Little Babaji&quot;, which changed the characters&#x27; names but otherwise left the text unmodified.

Julius Lester, in his &quot;Sam and the Tigers&quot;, also published in 1996, recast &quot;Sam&quot; as a hero of the mythical Sam-sam-sa-mara, where all the characters were named &quot;Sam&quot;.

A 2003 printing with the original title substituted more racially sensitive illustrations by Christopher Bing, portraying Sambo, in his publisher&#x27;s words, as &quot;a glorious and unabashedly African child&quot;. It was chosen for the Kirkus 2003 Editor&#x27;s Choice list. Some critics remained unsatisfied. Alvin F. Poussaint said of the 2003 publication: &quot;I don&#x27;t see how I can get past the title and what it means. It would be like ... trying to do &#x27;Little Black Darky&#x27; and saying, &#x27;As long as I fix up the character so he doesn&#x27;t look like a darky on the plantation, it&#x27;s OK.

In 1997, Kitaooji Shobo Publishing in Kyoto obtained formal license from the UK publisher, and republished the work under the title of &quot;Chibikuro Sampo&quot; (In Japanese, &quot;Chibi&quot; means &quot;little,&quot;&quot;kuro&quot; means black, and &quot;Sampo&quot; means a stroll, a kind of pun for the original word &quot;Sambo&quot;). The protagonist is depicted as a black Labrador puppy that goes for a stroll in the jungle; no humans appear in the edition. The Association To Stop Racism Against Blacks still refers to the book in this edition as discriminatory.

Bannerman&#x27;s original was first published with a translation of Masahisa Nadamoto by Komichi Shobo Publishing, Tokyo, in 1999.

In 2004, a Little Golden Books edition was published under the title &quot;The Boy and the Tigers&quot;, with new names and illustrations by Valeria Petrone. The boy is called Little Rajani.

Because Iwanami&#x27;s copyright expired fifty years after its first appearance, the Iwanami version, with its controversial Dobias illustrations and without the proper copyright, was re-released in April 2005 in Japan by a Tokyo-based publisher Zuiunsya.

==Adaptations==

A board game was produced in 1924, and re-issued in 1945, with different artwork. Essentially, the game followed the storyline, starting and ending at home.

In the 1930s, Wyandotte Toys used a pickaninny caricature &quot;Sambo&quot; image for a dart-gun target.

An animated version of the story was produced in 1935 as part of Ub Iwerks&#x27;s ComiColor series.

In 1939, Little Nipper (RCA Records for children) issued, in addition to a record storybook set of the traditional story, a two 45-RPM record storybook set entitled &quot;Little Black Sambo&#x27;s Jungle Band&quot;, narrated by Paul Wing. In the story, Little Black Sambo (in India) goes for a walk in the jungle and encounters a variety of animals, each, in the style of &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; (which had been composed by Sergei Prokofiev three years before), with its own distinctive instrument (e.g., an elephant with a tuba, a &quot;big baboon with a big bassoon&quot;, a honey bear with a &quot;perfectly peach piccolo&quot;, and a long green snake &quot;playing its scales&quot;). Each animal plays a distinctive song for him, and then they elect him to be their band director. By trial and error, Sambo trains the animals to play and harmonize together. In short, he is the talented hero of the story.

Columbia Records issued a 1946 version on two 78 RPM records with narration by Don Lyon. It was issued in a folder with artwork showing Sambo to be quite black indeed, though the narrative preserves the locale as India.

In 1961, the His Master&#x27;s Voice Junior Record Club issued a dramatised version – words by David Croft, music by Cyril Ornadel – with Susan Hampshire in the title role and narrated by Ray Ellington.

==Referenced or parodied in==
The visual novel &quot;&quot; (as well as its anime adaptation) references &quot;The Story of Little Black Sambo&quot; in the second chapter of the story. When Mondo Owada is found guilty of murdering a fellow student, the headmaster of the academy executes him in the &quot;Motorcycle Death Cage&quot;. Owada is tied to the back of a motorcycle and sent to spin in circles in a large steel cage; spinning at this fast rate while the cage becomes charged with electricity causes Mondo to be electrocuted to a point of liquefying into a butter-like substance that is packaged as &quot;Mondo Butter&quot;. &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot; (痴美苦露惨母) is seen written in kanji on the back of the motorcycle at the beginning of the execution, and the tiger design on the motorcycle and the two bobbing tiger panels on the sides of the death cage are a clear reference to this story.

The novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; by Ray Bradbury references &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot; in Part One: The Hearth and the Salamander as Captain Beatty discusses literature with Guy Montag: &quot;Colored people don&#x27;t like &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot;. Burn it. White people don&#x27;t feel good about &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin.&quot; Burn it.&quot;

&quot;Begin the Begin&quot;, the opening song on R.E.M.&#x27;s 1986 album Lifes Rich Pageant, references the story with the lyrics &quot;tiger run around the tree, follow the leader, run and turn into butter.&quot;

==Restaurants==
Lil&#x27; Sambo&#x27;s was a restaurant founded in 1957 in Lincoln City, Oregon named after the fictional character. It operated for 65 years as a popular spot in the community with many novelty merchandise items for sale. It closed in 2022 with the aging of the owners.

Sambo&#x27;s was a popular U.S. restaurant chain of the 1950s through 1970s that borrowed characters from the book (including Sambo and the tigers) for promotional purposes, although the Sambo name was originally a blend of the founders&#x27; names and nicknames: Sam (Sam Battistone) and Bo (Newell Bohnett). For a period in the late 1970s, some locations were renamed &quot;The Jolly Tiger&quot;. The controversy about the book led to accusations of racism that contributed to its demise in the early 1980s. Images inspired by the book (now considered by some to be racially insensitive) were common interior decorations in the restaurants. Though portions of the original chain were renamed &quot;No Place Like Sam&#x27;s&quot; to try to forestall closure, all but the original restaurants in Santa Barbara, California had closed by 1983. The original location, owned by Battistone&#x27;s grandson Chad Stevens, existed in Santa Barbara under the name &quot;Sambo&#x27;s&quot; until June 2020. The name on the restaurant&#x27;s sign was temporarily changed to the motto &quot;☮ &amp; LOVE&quot; due to pressure from the Black Lives Matter group during the George Floyd protests and a separate signature drive that collected thousands of signatures. In July 2020, the restaurant was officially renamed &quot;Chad&#x27;s&quot;.

<text>Giancarlo Parretti (born 23 October 1941) is an Italian financier.

==Early life and business interests==
Parretti was born in Orvieto, north of Rome, Italy. He worked as a waiter in London before moving to Sicily. There, he said, he used government aid to buy and sell at least four hotels. In 1983, he bought three Italian insurance companies and two years later sold them to a Geneva-based merchant bank, Sasea Holdings.

Parretti once was an owner and chairman of the 300-hotel Melia Hotel chain, and Renta Immobiliaria S.A, a Spanish real estate company. He was once a partner of the Spanish newspaper &quot;El Mundo&quot;.

==Later career==
From 1979 to 1981, Parretti was chairman of Siracusa Calcio, and partners with Gianni De Michelis and in the daily newspaper &quot;Il Diario&quot;, that was published between 1979 and 1981.

In 1986, Parretti gained control of &quot;Le Matin de Paris&quot;, a Socialist newspaper in Paris, which went bankrupt a year later.

In 1989, he took over Cannon Film Group Inc. from Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus. Almost immediately afterwards, he made plans to take over the historic French studio Pathé, and changed Cannon&#x27;s name to Pathé Communications in anticipation of the buyout. However, the French government blocked his bid due to concerns about his background.

&quot;In 1990, the Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti was trying to line up the Liberian government as an investor in a company he was using to buy MGM/UA Communications. But the relationship ended when Mr. Parretti’s ally, the Liberian president Samuel K. Doe, was tortured and killed by opponents.&quot;

Undaunted, Parretti bought Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1990 for $1.2 billion, using money borrowed from the Dutch arm of Crédit Lyonnais and contingent on future profits financing the purchase from mogul Kirk Kerkorian. 

Parretti persuaded Steve Ross (who, at the time was chairman of Time Warner) to guarantee a US$650 million loan to help his Pathé Communications to carry out the deal, with Time Warner in return gaining access to 3,000 films in the Pathé and MGM/UA libraries to distribute worldwide through theaters, TV and home video.

Parretti then merged the former Cannon with the MGM purchase to create the short-lived MGM-Pathé Communications.

Under Parretti&#x27;s control, MGM released almost no films (one victim being the &quot;James Bond&quot; franchise; the planned production of the seventeenth Bond film, &quot;Property of a Lady&quot;), while Parretti enjoyed a Hollywood mogul lifestyle. He fired most of the accounting staff, appointed his then 21-year-old daughter to a senior financial post, and used company money to buy lavish gifts for several girlfriends, including a former runner-up for Miss Universe. In 1991, his ownership dissolved in a flurry of lawsuits and a default to Crédit Lyonnais, and Parretti faced securities fraud charges in both the United States and Europe. In March 1999, he was found guilty of misuse of corporate funds and fraud and he was sentenced in absentia to four years in prison and fined 1 million Ff by a Paris court.

&quot;an ex-waiter whose principal expertise was Ponzi schemes, not film&quot;...much of the bank&#x27;s money went to what were euphemistically called &#x27;development deals&#x27; involving young women who were neither filmmakers nor developers&quot; – Peter Bart

Parretti is the subject of the 2024 documentary &quot;The Man Who Definitely Didn’t Steal Hollywood&quot;, directed by John Dower.

<text>Reed Leonard Crandall (February 22, 1917 – September 13, 1982) was an American illustrator and penciller of comic books and magazines. He was best known for the 1940s Quality Comics&#x27; &quot;Blackhawk&quot; and for stories in EC Comics during the 1950s. Crandall was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2009.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Reed Crandall was born in Winslow, Indiana, the son of Rayburn Crandall and wife. Crandall graduated from Newton High School in Newton, Kansas, in 1935, and then attended the Cleveland School of Art in Cleveland, Ohio, on a scholarship. He graduated in 1939. His father died in the spring of Crandall&#x27;s freshman year at art school, which Crandall left temporarily to return to Kansas. His mother and sister moved to Cleveland during Crandall&#x27;s junior year. With his schoolmate Frank Borth, Crandall found work painting signs on storefront windows. Crandall&#x27;s art influences included the painters and commercial illustrators N.C. Wyeth, Howard Pyle and James Montgomery Flagg.

Another classmate, the son of the president of the Cleveland-based Newspaper Enterprise Association syndicate, recommended Crandall for a job at NEA as a general art assistant, where Crandall drew maps and other supporting material. Following his desire to be a magazine illustrator, Crandall unsuccessfully made the rounds of glossy magazines in New York City and Philadelphia, and at some point did a small amount of work for a children&#x27;s book publisher. Moving to New York with his mother and sister, Crandall found work in the fledgling medium of comic books, joining the Eisner and Iger Studio, an early comic book packager that supplied complete, outsourced comics for publishers.

===Quality Comics===

Crandall drew for comic books from 1939 until 1973. His first work appears in comics from publisher Quality Comics, for which he drew stories starring such superheroes as the Ray (in &quot;Smash Comics&quot;, beginning in 1941 and initially under the playful pseudonym E. Lectron) and Doll Man (first in &quot;Feature Comics&quot; in 1941, then in the character&#x27;s own solo title). His earliest confirmed cover art is for Fiction House&#x27;s &quot;Fight Comics&quot; #12 (April 1941) at the Grand Comics Database. Other early work includes inking the pencil art of future industry legend Jack Kirby on two of the earliest Captain America stories, &quot;The Ageless Orientals That Wouldn&#x27;t Die&quot;, in &quot;Captain America Comics&quot; #2 (April 1941), and &quot;The Queer Case of the Murdering Butterfly and the Ancient Mummies&quot; in #3 (May 1941).

With S.M. &quot;Jerry&quot; Iger credited as writer, Crandall co-created the superhero the Firebrand in Quality&#x27;s &quot;Police Comics&quot; #1 (Aug. 1941) and began his long run as artist of his signature series, the World War II aviator-team strip &quot;Blackhawk&quot;, in &quot;Military Comics&quot; #12-22 (Oct. 1942 - Sept. 1943) and, after his WWII service in the Army Air Force, in &quot;Blackhawk&quot; and in &quot;Modern Comics&quot;. During this time he also drew the adventures of Captain Triumph in Quality&#x27;s &quot;Crack Comics&quot;. His final &quot;Blackhawk&quot; work was a seven-page story, plus the cover, for &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #67 (Aug. 1953).

===EC Comics and afterward===
Crandall went on to become a mainstay of EC Comics, whose line of hit horror and science fiction titles would become as influential to future generations of comics creators as they were controversial in their own time due to their often graphic nature and mature themes. Joining a group that included artists Johnny Craig, Jack Davis, Will Elder, Frank Frazetta, Graham Ingels, Jack Kamen, Bernard Krigstein and Wally Wood, Crandall made his debut there with the six-page story &quot;Bloody Sure&quot;, written by Al Feldstein, in &quot;The Haunt of Fear&quot; #20 (August 1953).

He drew dozens of stories across a variety of genres for the EC anthologies &quot;Crime SuspenStories&quot;, &quot;Shock SuspenStories&quot;, &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, &quot;Two-Fisted Tales&quot;, &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot;, &quot;Extra!&quot;, &quot;Impact&quot;, &quot;Piracy&quot;, and &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot; and its sequel series, &quot;Weird Science-Fantasy&quot;.

Following the demise of EC in the wake of the 1954 U.S. Senate hearings on juvenile delinquency and a wave of anti-comics sentiment, Reed freelanced for Atlas Comics, the 1950s iteration of Marvel Comics, as well as for the Gilberton Company&#x27;s &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot;. Crandall&#x27;s work for &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; consisted of joint projects with EC veteran George Evans on four titles: No. 18, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (Fall 1960); No. 23, &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (Fall 1961); No. 68, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1962); No. 168, &quot;In Freedom&#x27;s Cause&quot; (completed 1962; published UK 1963; published US 1969).

In 1960, he went under contract with the publisher of &quot;Treasure Chest&quot;, a comic book distributed exclusively through parochial schools. Crandall illustrated many covers and countless stories for &quot;Treasure Chest&quot; through 1972. In 1964, he illustrated books by Edgar Rice Burroughs for Canaveral Press. The following year, he began contributing to Warren Publishing&#x27;s black-and-white war-comics magazine &quot;Blazing Combat&quot;, and soon went on to contribute to the company&#x27;s line of black-and-white horror publications, including &quot;Creepy&quot; and &quot;Eerie&quot;. In the mid-to-late 1960s, he illustrated superhero-espionage stories for Tower Comics, and space opera science fiction in King Features Syndicate&#x27;s King Comics comic-book version of the syndicate&#x27;s long-running hero Flash Gordon.

In June 1970, Crandall and Buster Crabbe were guests at the Multicon-70 convention in Oklahoma City.

===Final years===
Crandall, who had left New York City in the 1960s in order to care for his ailing mother in Wichita, Kansas, had developed alcoholism. Recovering by the time of his mother&#x27;s death, he nonetheless suffered debilitated health and left art in 1974 to work as a night watchman and janitor for the Pizza Hut general headquarters in Wichita. After suffering a stroke that year, he spent his remaining life in a nursing home and died in 1982 of a heart attack. One of his last published stories, &quot;This Graveyard Is Not Deserted&quot;, appeared in &quot;Creepy&quot; #54 (July 1973). &quot;Creepy&quot; #58 contained &quot;Soul and Shadow&quot;, possibly his last published comic book work.

==Family==
Crandall married artist Martha Hamilton, and they had two children. Their daughter, artist Cathy Crandall, had three children. Their son, Navy veteran Reed L. &quot;Spike&quot; Crandall (Sept. 8, 1945-July 2, 2005), an artist who owned and operated Crandall&#x27;s Creations (Clarkesville, Georgia), had a daughter, Samantha Pledger, and three grandchildren.

==Awards and tributes==
Crandall was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2009.

He is referenced in Michael Chabon&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay&quot;. The fictional character Joe Kavalier refers to Crandall as the &quot;top&quot; comic-book artist of his era. In 2023, Crandall was posthumously awarded the Inkwell Awards SASRA (Stacey Aragon Special Recognition Award).

<text>The Maria Theresa thaler (MTT) is a silver bullion coin and a type of Conventionsthaler that has been used in world trade continuously since it was first minted in 1741. It is named after Maria Theresa who ruled Austria, Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia from 1740 to 1780 and is depicted on the coin.

==History==

In 1741, the first MTT was struck according to the standard with of a Cologne mark of fine silver, or 25.98 grams. In 1750 a new thaler was struck with a gross weight of of 1 Vienna mark of silver, fine (with a fine silver content of 23.39 grams, or of a Cologne mark). In 1751 this new standard was effectively adopted across the German-speaking world when it was accepted formally in the Bavarian monetary convention. This new, post-1751 thaler has continued as a trade coin ever since.

Since the death of Maria Theresa in 1780, the coin has always been dated 1780. On 19 September 1857, Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria declared the Maria Theresa thaler to be an official trade coinage. A little over a year later, on 31 October 1858, it lost its status as a currency in Austria.

The MTT could also be found throughout the Arab world, especially in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Muscat and Oman, in Africa, especially in Ethiopia, and India. Being of similar size to the Spanish eight-real coin, and initially thought to be of French origin, the MTT acquired the Arab name (, literally the &#x27;French riyal&#x27;). This coin was therefore the predecessor to, among others, the Saudi riyal and the Ethiopian birr.

During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies in World War II, enough people preferred it to the money issued by the occupying forces that the American Office of Strategic Services created counterfeit MTTs for use by resistance forces.

In German-speaking countries, following a spelling reform dated 1901 that took effect two years later, is written (the spelling of given names like was not affected). Hence 20th-century references to this coin in German and Austrian sources are found under . The spelling in English-speaking countries was not affected.

The MTT continues to be produced by the Austrian Mint and is available in both proof and uncirculated conditions.

==Details==
The thaler is in diameter and thick, weighs and contains 23.386 grams (0.752 troy ounces) of fine silver. It has a silver content of .833 and a copper content of .166 of its total millesimal fineness. Note: Rome mint struck MTTs are marginally lighter being produced in finer 835-standard instead of 833-standard silver.
The inscription on the obverse of this coin is in Latin: &quot;M. THERESIA D. G. R. IMP. HU. BO. REG.&quot; The Reverse reads &quot;ARCHID. AVST. DUX BURG. CO. TYR. 1780 X&quot;. It is an abbreviation of , which means, &#x27;Maria Theresa, by the grace of God, Empress of the Romans, Queen of Hungary and Bohemia, Archduchess of Austria, Duchess of Burgundy, Countess of Tyrol. 1780&#x27;. The &quot;☓&quot; is a saltire or Burgundian cross, and was added in 1750 indicating the new debased standard of the thaler. Around the rim of the coin is the motto of her reign: , meaning &#x27;Justice and Clemency&#x27;.

==Minting outside of Austria==
The MTT quickly became a standard trade coin and several nations began striking Maria Theresa thalers. The following mints have struck MTTs: Birmingham, Bombay, Brussels, London, Paris, Rome, and Utrecht, in addition to the Habsburg mints in Günzburg, Hall in Tyrol, Karlsburg, Kremnica, Milan, Prague, and Vienna. Between 1751 and 2000, some 389 million were minted. These various mints distinguished their issues by slight differences in the design, with some of these evolving over time. In 1935 Mussolini gained a 25-year concession over the production of the MTT. The Italians blocked non-Italian banks and bullion traders from obtaining the coin and so France, Belgium, and the UK started producing the coin to support their economic interests in the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and East Coast of Africa. In 1961 the 25-year concession ended and Austria made diplomatic approaches to the relevant governments requesting they cease production of the coin. The UK was the last government to agree formally to the request in February 1962.

The MTT came to be used as currency in large parts of Africa and the Middle East until after World War II. It was common from North Africa to Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, down the coast of Tanzania to Mozambique, and also in the Arabian Peninsula (Oman, Yemen). Its popularity in the Red Sea region was such that merchants would not accept any other type of currency. The Italian government produced a similarly designed coin in the hope of replacing the Maria Theresa thaler, but it never gained acceptance.

The Maria Theresa thaler was also formerly the currency of the Hejaz, Yemen, and the Aden Protectorate, as well as Muscat and Oman on the Arabia peninsula. There it was widely used for traditional jewellery, both as a source of silver, and as a decoration itself. The coin remains popular in North Africa and the Middle East to this day in its original form: a silver coin with a portrait of the ruler on the front and the Habsburg Double Eagle on the back.

In the United Kingdom, the Maria Theresa thaler bearing the date of 1780 is a &quot;protected coin&quot; for of Part II of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981.

==Ethiopia==

The MTT is first recorded as circulating in Ethiopia from Emperor Iyasu II of Ethiopia (1730–1755). According to traveller James Bruce, the coin, not debased as other currencies, dominated the areas he visited in 1768. Joseph Kalmer and Ludwig Hyun in the book estimate that over 20% of 245 million coins minted until 1931 ended up in Ethiopia.

In 1868, the British military expedition to Magdala, the capital of Emperor Tewodros II of Ethiopia, under Field Marshal Robert Napier, took MTTs with them to pay local expenses. In 1890 the Italians introduced the , styled after the MTT, in their new colony Eritrea, also hoping to impose it on the commerce with Ethiopia. They remained, however, largely unsuccessful.

In the early 1900s, Menelik II unsuccessfully attempted to mint Menelik thalers locally, with his effigy, but styled following the model of the MTT, and force their use. The newly established Bank of Abyssinia also issued banknotes denominated in thalers. Starting in 1935 the Italians minted the MTT at the mint in Rome for use in their conquest of Ethiopia. Then during World War II, the British minted some 18 million MTTs in Bombay to use in their East African Campaign to drive the Italians out of Ethiopia.

<doc id="638420" wikidata="Q55780" url="?curid=638420" title="Samarth Ramdas">
<text>Ramdas (c. 1608 – c. 1682), also known as Samarth Ramdas or Ramdas Swami, was an Indian Hindu saint, philosopher, poet, writer and spiritual master. He was a devotee of the Hindu deities Rama and Hanuman.

==Early life==
Ramdas or previously Narayan Thosar was born at Jamb, a village in present-day Jalna district, Maharashtra on the occasion of Rama Navami, probably in 1608 CE. He was born into a Marathi Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmin family to Suryajipant and Ranubai Thosar. His father was thought to have been a devotee of the Vedic deity, Surya. Ramdas had an elder brother named Gangadhar. His father died when Narayan was only seven years of age. He turned into an introvert after the demise of his father and would often be noticed to be engrossed in thoughts about the divine.

As per legend, Narayan fled his wedding ceremony in Asangao near Jamb, at age 12, upon hearing a &quot;pandit&quot; (Hindu priest) chant the word &quot;&#x27;Saawadhaana!&quot;&#x27; (Beware!) during a customary Hindu wedding ritual. He is believed to have walked over 200 km along the banks of Godavari river to Panchavati, a Hindu pilgrimage town near Nashik. He later moved to Taakli near Nashik at the confluence of Godavari and Nandini river. At Taakli, he spent the next twelve years as an ascetic in complete devotion to Rama. During this period, he adhered to a rigorous daily routine and devoted most of his time to meditation, worship and exercise. As per legend, he once blessed a widow lady of a long married life, without knowing that her husband has just died. It is said that he was able to give life back to the dead body of her husband and this act of miracle made him very famous in Nashik. He is thought to have attained enlightenment at the age of 24. He adopted the name Ramdas around this period. He later had an idol of Hanuman made from cowdung installed at Taakli.

==Pilgrimage and spiritual movement==

Ramdas left Taakli a few years later and then embarked on a pilgrimage across the Indian subcontinent. He traveled for twelve years and made observations on contemporary social life. He had these observations recorded in two of his literary works &quot;Asmani Sultania&quot; and &quot;Parachakraniroopan.&quot; These works provide a rare insight into the then prevalent social conditions in the Indian subcontinent. He also traveled to regions in the vicinity of the Himalayas during this period. Around this time, he met the sixth Sikh Guru Hargobind at Srinagar.

After the pilgrimage, he returned to Mahabaleshwar, a hill-town near Satara. Later while at Masur, he arranged for Rama Navami celebrations that were reportedly attended by thousands.
As part of his mission to redeem spirituality among the masses and unite the Hindu populations, Ramdas initiated the Samarth sect. He established several &quot;matha&quot; (monasteries) across the Indian subcontinent. He may have established between 700 and 1100 &quot;matha&quot; during his travels. Narahar Phatak in his biography of Ramdas claims that the actual number of &quot;matha&quot; founded by him may have been far fewer. Around 1648 CE, he had an idol of Rama installed at a newly built temple in Chaphal, a village near Satara. Initially, he had eleven Hanuman temples constructed in various regions of southern Maharashtra. These are now together referred to as the &quot;11-Maruti&quot; (see list below).

==Literary contribution and philosophy==

===Literary works===
Ramdas had extensive literature written during his lifetime. His literary works include &quot;Dasbodh&quot;, &quot;Karunashtakas&quot;, &quot;Sunderkand, Yuddhakand,&quot; &quot;Poorvarambh, Antarbhav, Aatmaaram, Chaturthman, Panchman, Manpanchak, Janaswabhawgosavi, Panchsamasi, Saptsamasi, Sagundhyan, Nirgundhyan, Junatpurush, Shadripunirupan, Panchikaranyog, Manache Shlok&quot; &quot;and&quot; &quot;Shreemad&quot; &quot;Dasbodh.&quot; Unlike the saints subscribing to Warkari tradition, Ramdas is not considered to embrace pacifism. His writings include strong expressions encouraging militant means to counter the barbaric Islamic invaders.

A major portion of his Marathi literature is in the form of verses.

Listed below are some of his notable literary works.
*&quot;Manache Shlok&quot; (co-written by Kalyan Swami)
*&quot;Dasbodh&quot;
*&quot;Shree Maruti Stotra&quot;
*&quot;Aatmaaram&quot;
*&quot;11-Laghu Kavita&quot;
*&quot;Shadripu Nirupan&quot;
*&quot;Maan Panchak&quot;
*&quot;Chaturthmaan&quot;
*&quot;Raamayan (Marathi-Teeka)&quot;

His compositions include numerous &quot;aarti&quot; (worship rituals). One of his most popular &quot;aarti&quot; commemorates the Hindu deity Ganesha, and is popularly known as &quot;Sukhakarta Dukhaharta&quot;. It is believed that the &quot;bhajan&quot; (devotional song) &quot;Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram&quot; is based on a &quot;mantra&quot; composed by Ramdas.

His other works include an &quot;aaratee&quot; commemorating Hanuman, S&quot;atrane Uddane Hunkaar Vadani&quot; and an &quot;aaratee&quot; dedicated to the Hindu deity Vitthala, &quot;Panchanan Haivahan Surabhushan Lila.&quot; He also composed &quot;aarti&quot; in dedication to other Hindu deities. His well-known work &quot;Dasbodh&quot; has been translated to several other Indian languages. The original copy of &quot;Dasbodh&quot; is currently placed at a &quot;matha&quot; in Domgaon, a village in present-day Osmanabad district, Maharashtra.

=== Philosophy ===
Ramdas was an exponent of Bhakti Yoga or the path of devotion. According to him, total devotion to Rama brings about spiritual evolution. His definition of &quot;Bhakti&quot; was in accordance with the philosophy of Advait Vedant. In Chapter 4 of his literary work Dasbodh, he describes Nice levels of devotion / communion - starting from listening / comprehending (श्रवण) to Surrender of oneself or being One with Self (आत्मनिवेदन) - the later being the core tenet of Advait Vedant - where the sense of separate &quot;I&quot; dissolves into non-duality. 

He endorsed significance of physical strength and knowledge towards individual development. He expressed his admiration for warriors and highlighted their role in safeguarding the society. He was of the opinion that saints must not withdraw from society but instead actively engage towards social and moral transformation. He aimed to resuscitate the Hindu culture after its disintegration over several centuries owing to consistent foreign occupation. He also called for unity among the Marathas to preserve and promote the local culture.

He encouraged the participation of women in religious work and offered them positions of authority. He had 18 female disciples, among who Vennabai headed the &quot;matha&quot; at Miraj near Sangli while Akkabai managed &quot;matha&quot; at Chaphal and Sajjangad near Satara. He is said to have once reprimanded an aged man who voiced his opinion against female participation in religious affairs. Ramdas reportedly responded by saying &quot;Everyone came from a woman&#x27;s womb and those who did not understand the importance of this were unworthy of being called men&quot;. In &quot;Dasbodh&quot;, Ramdas eulogizes the virtues of aesthetic handwriting (Chapter 19.10, Stanza 1–3p).
==Samarth sect==

Ramdas initiated the Samarth sect to revive spirituality among the various sections of Indian society. He established several &quot;matha during his lifetime&quot;.

== Links with contemporaries ==

=== Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Bhonsle I ===

The first Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji Bhonsle I was a disciple of Samarth Ramdas. 

===Guru Hargobind===

According to a manuscript in the Sikh tradition known as &quot;Panjāh Sakhīān&quot;, Ramdas Swami met Guru Hargobind (1595 - 1644) at Srinagar near the Garhwal hills. This meeting also finds a mention in an 18th-century Marathi literary work known as &quot;Ramdas Swamichi Bakhar&quot;, composed by Hanumant Swami&quot;.&quot; The meeting probably took place in the early 1630s during Ramdas&#x27; pilgrimage to northern India and Hargobind&#x27;s journey to Nanakmatta, a town in present-day Uttarakhand. Before the meeting, Hargobind had probably returned from a hunting excursion.
During their conversation, Ramdas Swami reportedly asked &quot;I had heard that you occupy the Gaddi (seat) of Nanak. Nanak was a &quot;tyāgī sādhu&quot;, a saint who had renounced the world. You possess arms and keep an army and horses. You allow yourself to be addressed as Sacha Patshah, the true king. What sort of a &quot;sādhu&quot; are you?&quot; Hargobind replied, &quot;Internally a hermit and externally a prince. Arms mean protection to the poor and destruction of the tyrant. Baba Guru Nanak had not renounced the world but had renounced &quot;māyā&quot; - the self and ego.&quot; Ramdas is reported to have said, &quot;Yeh hamare man bhavti hai&quot; (This appeals to my mind).

==Residences==
Ramdas moved all across the Indian subcontinent and usually resided in caves (&quot;ghal&quot; in Marathi). Some of these are listed below.
* Ramghal, Sajjangad
* Morghal, at Morbag near Sajjangad
* Tondoshighal, north of Chaphal
* Taakli, near Nashik
* Chandragiri, opposite Vasantgad, near Karad
* Helwak, near Helwak village
* Shiganwadi, near Chandragiri
*Shivtharghal, near Mahad

==Death==
For five days prior, he had ceased consuming food and water. This practice of fasting unto death is known as &quot;Praayopaveshana&quot;. He continuously recited the &quot;taaraka mantra&quot; &quot;Shree Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram&quot; while resting beside an idol of Rama brought from Tanjore. His disciples Uddhav Swami and Akka Swami remained in his service during this period. Uddhav Swami had the final rites performed.

==Legacy==
Samartha Ramdas Swami served an inspiration for a number of Indian thinkers, historians and social reformers such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Keshav Hedgewar, Vishwanath Rajwade ,Ramchandra Ranade, and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. Tilak derived inspiration from Ramdas when devising aggressive strategies to counter the British colonial rule. Nanasaheb Dharmadhikari, a spiritual teacher promoted Ramdas Swami’s philosophy through his spiritual discourses. Gondavalekar Maharaj, a 19th-century spiritual master promoted Ramdas&#x27; spiritual methods through his teachings. Bhausaheb Maharaj, founder of the Inchegeri Sampradaya used &quot;Dasbodh&quot; as a means of instruction to his disciples. &quot;Dasbodh&quot; has been translated and published by the American followers of Ranjit Maharaj, a spiritual teacher of the Inchegeri Sampradaya.

Ramdas had a profound influence on Keshav Hedgewar, the founder of Hindu nationalist organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Hedgewar quoted Ramdas on numerous occasions and would often note the latter&#x27;s views in his personal diary. According to one entry in his diary dated 4 March 1929, Hedgewar writes &quot;Shri Samarth did not want anything for himself. He mindfully guarded against self-pride which could result from success and greatness. Ingraining this discipline, he devoted himself to the welfare of his people and a higher self-realization.&quot;

===Cultural legacy===
Ramdas Swami is a revered spiritual figure in Maharashtra and remains relevant to contemporary society in Maharashtra, thanks to his literary contributions. An &quot;aarti&quot; composed by him in reverence of the Hindu deity Ganesh is often recited first in numerous Hindu rituals. &quot;Maruti Stotra&quot;, his hymn in praise of Hanuman is commonly recited by school children as well as wrestlers at traditional gyms known as a&quot;khada&quot; in Maharashtra. Generations of Marathi children have been reciting &quot;Manache Shlok&quot; at home or at school. Swatantravir Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, an Indian independence activist and writer is believed to have derived inspiration from &quot;Dasbodh&quot;. Ramdas&#x27; teachings and philosophy have been promoted and endorsed by various political and social organizations in Maharashtra.

<text>Fort Campbell is a United States Army installation located astride the Kentucky–Tennessee border between Hopkinsville, Kentucky and Clarksville, Tennessee (post address is located in Kentucky). Fort Campbell is home to the 101st Airborne Division and the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. The fort is named in honor of Union Army Brigadier General William Bowen Campbell, the last Whig Governor of Tennessee.

==History==
The site for Fort Campbell was selected on September 9, 1941, and the Title I Survey was completed November 15, 1941, coincidentally the same time the Japanese Imperial Fleet was leaving Japanese home waters for the attack on Pearl Harbor. Construction of Camp Campbell began on January 12, 1942. Within a year, the reservation designated as Camp Campbell was developed to accommodate one armored division and various support troops, with a total size of , and billets for 2,422 officers and 45,198 enlisted personnel.

Due to its close proximity to Nashville, the War Department on March 7, 1941, designated Tennessee as the official address of the new camp. This caused a great deal of confusion. While the headquarters and a great majority of the base&#x27;s acreage was in Tennessee, the base&#x27;s post office was in Kentucky. After many months of mail delivery problems, Colonel Guy W. Chipman requested that the address be changed to Camp Campbell, Kentucky. The War Department officially changed the address on September 23, 1942.

Early in the summer of 1942, the post&#x27;s initial cadre, one officer and 19 enlisted men, arrived from Fort Knox, Kentucky. From that time until the end of World War II, Camp Campbell was the training ground for the 12th, 14th and 20th Armored divisions, Headquarters IV Armored Corps and the 26th Infantry Division. Several formations were sent to Camp Campbell after the war and deactivated, one being the 5th Infantry Division in September 1946.

In the spring of 1949, the 11th Airborne Division arrived at Campbell following occupation duty in Japan. The 11th was in residence there until early 1956.

By April 1950, the post had evolved from a wartime training camp to a permanent installation and was renamed Fort Campbell.

From 1950 to 1962, the post operated an Airborne Course which trained nearly 30,000 soldiers as paratroopers before its inactivation.

On September 21, 1956, Secretary of the Army Wilber M. Brucker and the Army Chief of Staff, General Maxwell D. Taylor, presented the colors of the 101st Airborne Division to MG T.L. Sherbourne, the first commander of the new, previously experimental, ROTAD (Reorganization Of The Airborne Division) division. This ceremony officially reactivated the famed &quot;Screaming Eagles&quot; of World War II.

On May 2, 1966, Third Army General Order 161 directed the activation of a Basic Combat Training Center at Fort Campbell. On July 6, barely two months after its activation, Fort Campbell&#x27;s Army Training Center received its first 220 newly inducted soldiers. Basic Combat Training began on schedule July 11 with a full complement of 1,100 trainees. The Training Center operated until April 15, 1972, when it was deactivated.

The 1st Brigade was sent for duty in Vietnam in July 1965. Soon thereafter, upon the escalation of hostilities in Southeast Asia, the rest of the division arrived. Also in response to the military buildup, the 6th Infantry Division was reactivated at Fort Campbell on November 24, 1966, and inactivated July 25, 1968.

In September 1971, the 173rd Airborne Brigade returned to Fort Campbell and conducted its official homecoming ceremonies, which were presided over by Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird. The 173rd was then inactivated on 14 January 1972 and its personnel and the equipment used to rebuild the 3rd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile). The 3rd Brigade remained on jump status until April 1974, when its jump status was terminated and the division became entirely airmobile. On April 6, 1972, the 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile) was officially welcomed back to its home station after the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam. The ceremonies were attended by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew and General William C. Westmoreland, Army Chief of Staff.

Fort Campbell had a children&#x27;s theatre program until it closed down in 1983.

On December 12, 1985, 246 servicemembers died with eight aircrews shortly after takeoff from Gander, Newfoundland, Canada, during a return from peacekeeping duties in Egypt. A memorial grove of trees and monument are near the post museum.

As a result of the tornado outbreak of December 9–10, 2023, about 250 Army families were displaced from their homes. The damage was especially severe in Clarksville, the town outside of the base, where an EF3 tornado with estimated winds of killed 6 people there and in neighbouring areas. There were no reported fatalities among Fort Campbell personnel or their families. Roughly 1,100 Fort Campbell soldiers and family members were without critical services such as water, heat or electricity. Fort Campbell sustained no obvious significant damage.

===Criminal incidents===

On July 5, 1999, Private First Class Barry Winchell, 21, of 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, was bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat in his barracks. The murder was committed by Private Calvin Glover, who was egged on by Specialist Justin Fisher. Apparently the motive was punishing Winchell for falling in love with Calpernia Addams, a transsexual showgirl. Winchell died at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. Glover was later convicted for the murder, while Fisher was convicted of lesser crimes. Fisher was released to a halfway house in August 2006 and was later released from all custody. Glover received a life sentence and is eligible for parole after 15 years.

On October 13, 2005, Fort Campbell made international headlines when Private Nicholas Mikel opened fire on a group of soldiers training at the base. Private Mikel was arrested soon thereafter and charged with attempted murder. In April 2006 he was convicted of attempted premeditated murder and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment.

===2011 tornado===
Early on April 26, 2011, a strong tornado struck the Campbell Army Airfield at Fort Campbell, destroying one building and causing heavy damage to several others, all of which were large and well-constructed. Large doors were blown in on these buildings as well. Several other smaller buildings received minor to major damage, and numerous heavy vehicles were damaged, with at least three being flipped over. Immediately north of the airfield, across farmland, several dozen trees were downed, two barns were heavily damaged, three power poles were blown down, and some shingles were blown off of a house. The tornado was rated EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita scale.

=== 2023 Helicopter Training Crash ===
Nine soldiers in the 101st Airborne Division were killed during a helicopter training on March 29, 2023. Happening around 10 p.m. local time, two HH-60 Black Hawk medical evacuation aircraft crashed into each other, while pilots were using night vision goggles. Their helicopters crashed west of Fort Campbell in a partially wooded field.

==Operations and taxation==

The Sabalauski Air Assault School, named after Command Sergeant Major Walter James Sabalauski is located on Fort Campbell. Courses taught include Air Assault, Pathfinder, Pre-Ranger, Jumpmaster Refresher, and Rappel Master. Fast Rope Insertion Extraction System (FRIES)/Special Purpose Insertion Extraction (SPIES) Master courses are also taught. The school is also home to the Division&#x27;s Parachute Demonstration Team.

Kentucky has limited rights to taxation: Individuals performing services on the Kentucky portion of Fort Campbell only pay taxes to the state where they are residents, refer to US Code Title 4, Chapter 4, §115. Tennessee has no state income tax on wages but a higher retail sales tax than Kentucky.

==Fort Campbell Parachute Demonstration Team &quot;Screaming Eagles&quot;==
The Fort Campbell parachute demonstration team was established in 1958 during the infancy of precision freefall as the Army&#x27;s first such team—pre-dating the Golden Knights, United States Army Parachute Team, by one year. Early team members were soldiers who volunteered their free time in order to perform quality parachute demonstrations. In 1984, the 101st command group opted to form a full-time parachute team, known as the &quot;Screaming Eagles&quot;.

The &quot;Screaming Eagles&quot; perform more than 60 parachute demonstrations each year in front of an average viewing audience of 5,000 spectators. The team has a diverse background of Army Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) and at this time has seven members. The team has one Light Wheeled Mechanic, two Combat Medics, three Infantrymen, and one Parachute Rigger most of whom have combat experience. Collectively, the 2009 team has more than 40 years of skydiving experience and more than 6,000 skydives.

<text>Scott Sander Sheppard (born 1977) is an American astronomer and a discoverer of numerous moons, comets and minor planets in the outer Solar System.

He is an astronomer in the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, DC. He attended Oberlin College as an undergraduate, and received his bachelor in physics with honors in 1998. Starting as a graduate student at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, he was credited with the discovery of many small moons of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. He has also discovered the first known trailing Neptune trojan, , the first named leading Neptune trojan, 385571 Otrera, and the first high inclination Neptune trojan, . These discoveries showed that the Neptune trojan objects are mostly on highly inclined orbits and thus likely captured small bodies from elsewhere in the Solar System.

The main-belt asteroid 17898 Scottsheppard, discovered by LONEOS at Anderson Mesa Station in 1999, was named in his honor.

==Discoveries==


Sheppard was the lead discoverer of the object with the most distant orbit known in the Solar System, (nicknamed Biden). In 2014, the similarity of the orbit of to other extreme Kuiper belt object orbits led Sheppard and Trujillo to propose that an unknown Super-Earth mass planet (2–15 Earth masses) in the outermost Solar System beyond 200 AU and up to 1500 AU is shepherding these smaller bodies into similar orbits (see Planet X or Planet Nine). The extreme trans-Neptunian objects and , announced in 2016 and co-discovered by Sheppard, further show a likely unknown massive planet exists beyond a few hundred AU in the Solar System, with being the first known high semi-major axis and high perihelion object anti-aligned with the other known extreme objects. In 2018, the announcement of the high perihelion inner Oort cloud object 541132 Leleākūhonua (nicknamed &quot;The Goblin&quot;) by Sheppard et al., being only the third known after and Sedna, further demonstrated that a super-Earth planet in the distant solar system likely exists as Leleākūhonua has many orbital similarities as the two other known inner Oort cloud objects.

===Most notable discoveries===
Sheppard has been involved in the discovery of many small Solar System bodies such as trans-Neptunian objects, centaurs, comets and near-Earth objects.
*Three comets are named after him which are Sheppard-Trujillo (C/2014 F3), Sheppard-Tholen (C/2015 T5) and comet Trujillo-Sheppard (P/2018 V5).
*The possible dwarf planets discovered by Sheppard are 471143 Dziewanna, , , , and .
*In 2018, Sheppard was the lead discoverer of the most distant observed object in our solar system and first object observed beyond 100 AU, dwarf planet (nicknamed Farout), which is around 120 AU from the Sun.
*He discovered a minor-planet moon around likely dwarf planet .
*He is also a co-discoverer of a minor-planet moon orbiting the binary trans-Neptunian object 341520 Mors–Somnus.
*Among the numerous irregular moons of the major planets in whose discovery he has been involved are:

<text>A depth gauge is an instrument for measuring depth below a vertical reference surface. They include depth gauges for underwater diving and similar applications.
A diving depth gauge is a pressure gauge that displays the equivalent depth below the free surface in water. The relationship between depth and pressure is linear and accurate enough for most practical purposes, and for many purposes, such as diving, it is actually the pressure that is important. It is a piece of diving equipment used by underwater divers, submarines and submersibles.

Most modern diving depth gauges have an electronic mechanism and digital display. Earlier types used a mechanical mechanism and analogue display. Digital depth gauges used by divers commonly also include a timer showing the interval of time that the diver has been submerged. Some show the diver&#x27;s rate of ascent and descent, which can be is useful for avoiding barotrauma. This combination instrument is also known as a bottom timer. An electronic depth gauge is an essential component of a dive computer.

As the gauge only measures water pressure, there is an inherent inaccuracy in the depth displayed by gauges that are used in both fresh water and seawater due to the difference in the densities of fresh water and seawater due to salinity and temperature variations.

A depth gauge that measures the pressure of air bubbling out of an open ended hose to the diver is called a &quot;pneumofathometer&quot;. They are usually calibrated in metres of seawater or feet of seawater.

== History ==
Experiments in 1659 by Robert Boyle of the Royal Society were made using a barometer underwater, and led to Boyle&#x27;s law. The French physicist, mathematician and inventor Denis Papin published &quot;Recuiel de diverses Pieces touchant quelques novelles Machines&quot; in 1695, where he proposed a depth gauge for a submarine. 
A &quot;sea-gage&quot; for measuring ocean depth was described in &quot;Philosophia Britannica&quot; in 1747. But it wasn&#x27;t until 1775 and the development of a depth gauge by the inventor, scientific instrument, and clock maker Isaac Doolittle of New Haven, Connecticut, for David Bushnell&#x27;s submarine the &quot;Turtle&quot;, that one was deployed in an underwater craft. By the early nineteenth century, &quot;the depth gauge was a standard feature on diving bells&quot;.

== Mode of operation ==
With water depth, the ambient pressure increases 1 bar for every 10 m in fresh water at 4 °C. Therefore, the depth can be determined by measuring the pressure and comparing it to the pressure at the surface. Atmospheric pressure varies with altitude and weather, and for accuracy the depth gauge should be calibrated to correct for local atmospheric pressure. This can be important for decompression safety at altitude. Water density varies with temperature and salinity, so for an accurate depth measurement by this method, the temperature and salinity profiles must be known. These are easily measured, but must be measured directly.

== Types ==
=== Boyle-Mariott depth gauge ===
The &quot;Boyle-Mariotte depth gauge&quot; consists of a transparent tube open at one end. It has no moving parts, and the tube is commonly part of a circle or a flat spiral to compactly fit onto a support. While diving, water goes into the tube and compresses an air bubble inside proportionally to the depth. The edge of the bubble indicates the depth on a scale. For a depth up to 10 m, this depth gauge is quite accurate, because in this range, the pressure doubles from 1 bar to 2 bar, and so it uses half of the scale. This type of gauge is also known as a capillary gauge. At greater depths, it becomes inaccurate. The maximum depth cannot be recorded with this type of depth gauge, and accuracy is strongly affected by temperature change of the air bubble while immersed.

=== Bourdon tube depth gauge ===
The Bourdon tube depth gauge consists of a curved tube made of elastic metal, known as a Bourdon tube. Water pressure on the tube may be on the inside or the outside depending on the design. When the pressure increases, the tube stretches, and when it decreases the tube recovers to the original curvature. This movement is transferred to a pointer by a system of gears or levers, and the pointer may have an auxiliary trailing pointer which is pushed along but does not automatically return with the main pointer, which can mark the maximum depth reached. Accuracy can be good. When carried by the diver, these gauges measure the pressure difference directly between the ambient water and the sealed internal air space of the gauge, and therefore can be influenced by temperature changes.

=== Membrane depth gauge ===
In a membrane depth gauge, the water presses onto a metal canister with a flexible end, which is deflected proportionally to external pressure. Deflection of the membrane is amplified by a lever and gear mechanism and transferred to an indicator pointer like in an aneroid barometer. The pointer may push a trailing pointer which does not return by itself, and indicates the maximum. This type of gauge can be quite accurate when corrected for temperature variations.

Strain gauges may be used to convert the pressure on a membrane to electrical resistance, which can be converted to an analog signal by a Wheatstone bridge This signal can be processed to provide a signal proportional to pressure, which may be digitised for further processing and display.

===Piezoresistive pressure sensors ===

Piezoresistive pressure sensors use the variation of resistivity of silicon with stress. A piezoresistive sensor consists of a silicon diaphragm on which silicon resistors are diffused during the manufacturing process. The diaphragm is bonded to a silicon wafer. The signal must be corrected for temperature variations. These pressure sensors are commonly used in dive computers.
=== Pneumofathometer ===

A pneumofathometer is a depth gauge which indicates the depth of a surface supplied diver by measuring the pressure of air supplied to the diver. Originally there were pressure gaues mounted on the hand cranked diver&#x27;s air pump used to provide breathing air to a diver wearing standard diving dress, with a free-flow air supply, in which there was not much back-pressure other than the hydrostatic pressure of depth. As non-return valves were added to the system for safety, they increased back pressure, which also increased when demand helmets were introduced, so an additional small diameter hose was added to the diver&#x27;s umbilical which has no added restrictions and when a low flow rate of gas is passed through it to produce bubbles at the diver, it gives an accurate, reliable and rugged system for measuring diver depth, which is still used as the standard depth monitoring equipment for surface supplied divers. The pneumofathometer gauges are mounted on the diver&#x27;s breathing gas supply panel, and are activated by a valve. The &quot;pneumo line&quot;, as it is generally called by divers, can be used as an emergency breathing air supply, by tucking the open end into the bottom of the helmet or full face mask and opening up the valve to provide free flow air. A &quot;gauge snubber&quot; needle valve or orifice is fitted between the pneumo line and the gauge to reduce shock loads on the delicate mechanism, and an overpressure valve protects the gauge from pressures beyond its operating range. The type of high precision gauge used is also known as a caisson gauge. Precision is typically 1% to 0.25% of full scale.

== Dive computer ==

Dive computers have an integrated depth gauge, with digitized output which is used in the calculation of the current decompression status of the diver. The dive depth is displayed along with other values on the display and recorded by the computer for continuous simulation of the decompression model. Most dive computers contain a piezoresistive pressure sensor. Rarely, capacitive or inductive pressure sensors are used.

A diver uses a depth gauge with decompression tables and a watch to avoid decompression sickness. A common alternative to the depth gauge, watch and decompression tables is a dive computer, which has an integral depth gauge, and displays the current depth as a standard function.

== Light based depth gauges in Biology ==
A depth gauge can also be based on light: The brightness decreases with depth, but depends on the weather (e.g. whether it is sunny or cloudy) and the time of the day. Also the color depends on the water depth.

In water, light attenuates for each wavelength, differently. The UV, violet (&gt; 420 nm), and red (&lt; 500 nm) wavelengths disappear before blue light (470 nm), which penetrates clear water the deepest. The wavelength composition is constant for each depth and is almost independent of time of the day and the weather. To gauge depth, an animal would need two photopigments sensitive to different wavelengths to compare different ranges of the spectrum. Such pigments may be expressed in different structures.

Such different structures are found in the polychaete &quot;Torrea candida&quot;. Its eyes have a main and two accessory retinae. The accessory retinae sense UV-light (&quot;λ&quot;max = 400 nm) and the main retina senses blue-green light (&quot;λ&quot;max = 560 nm). If the light sensed from all retinae is compared, the depth can be estimated, and so for &quot;Torrea candida&quot; such a ratio-chromatic depth gauge has been proposed.

A ratio chromatic depth gauge has been found in larvae of the polychaete &quot;Platynereis dumerilii&quot;. The larvae have two structures: The rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells of the eyes and in the deep brain the ciliary photoreceptor cells. The ciliary photoreceptor cells express a ciliary opsin, which is a photopigment maximally sensitive to UV-light (&quot;λ&quot;max = 383 nm). Thus, the ciliary photoreceptor cells react on UV-light and make the larvae swimming down gravitactically. The gravitaxis here is countered by phototaxis, which makes the larvae swimming up to the light coming from the surface. Phototaxis is mediated by the rhabdomeric eyes. The eyes express at least three opsins (at least in the older larvae), and one of them is maximally sensitive to cyan light (&quot;λ&quot;max = 483 nm) so that the eyes cover a broad wavelength range with phototaxis. When phototaxis and gravitaxis have leveled out, the larvae have found their preferred depth.

<text>Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) is a compiler for the closely related programming-language dialects Pascal and Object Pascal. It is free software released under the GNU General Public License, with exception clauses that allow static linking against its runtime libraries and packages for any purpose in combination with any other software license.

It supports its own Object Pascal dialect, as well as the dialects of several other Pascal family compilers to a certain extent, including those of Borland Pascal (named &quot;Turbo Pascal&quot; until the 1990 version 6), Borland (later Embarcadero) Delphi, and some historical Macintosh compilers. The dialect is selected on a per-unit (module) basis, and more than one dialect can be used per program.

It follows a &quot;write once, compile anywhere&quot; philosophy and is available for many CPU architectures and operating systems (see Targets). It supports inline assembly language and includes an internal assembler capable of parsing several dialects such as AT&amp;T and Intel style.

There are separate projects to facilitate developing cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI) applications, the most prominent one being the Lazarus integrated development environment (IDE).

== Supported dialects ==
Initially, Free Pascal adopted the &quot;de facto&quot; standard dialect of Pascal programmers, Borland Pascal, but later adopted Delphi&#x27;s Object Pascal. From version 2.0 on, Delphi compatibility has been continuously implemented or improved.

The project has a &quot;compilation mode&quot; concept, and the developers made it clear that they would incorporate working patches for the standardized dialects of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to create a standards-compliant mode.

A small effort has been made to support some of the Apple Pascal syntax to ease interfacing to the Classic Mac OS and macOS. The Apple dialect implements some standard Pascal features that Turbo Pascal and Delphi omit.

The 2.2.&quot;x&quot; release series did not significantly change the dialect objectives beyond roughly Delphi 7 level syntax, instead aiming for closer compatibility. A notable exception to this was the addition of support for generics to Free Pascal in version 2.2.0, several years before they were supported in any capacity by Delphi.

In 2011 several Delphi 2006-specific features were added in the development branch, and some of the starting work for the features new in Delphi 2009 (most notably the addition of the codice_1 type) was completed. The development branch also has an &quot;Objective-Pascal&quot; extension for Objective-C (Cocoa) interfacing.

As of version 2.7.1, Free Pascal implemented basic ISO Pascal mode, though many things such as the codice_2 and codice_3 procedures, and the file-buffer variable concept for file handling were still absent.

As of version 3.0.0, ISO Pascal mode is fairly complete. It has been able to compile standardpascal.org&#x27;s P5 ISO Pascal compiler with no changes.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
Free Pascal was created when Borland clarified that Borland Pascal development for DOS would stop with version 7, to be replaced by a Windows-only product, which later became Delphi.

Student Florian Paul Klämpfl began developing his own compiler written in the Turbo Pascal dialect and produced 32-bit code for the GO32v1 DOS extender, which was used and developed by the DJ&#x27;s GNU Programming Platform (DJGPP) project at that time.

Originally, the compiler was a 16-bit DOS executable compiled by Turbo Pascal. After two years, the compiler was able to compile itself and became a 32-bit executable.

=== Expansion ===
The initial 32-bit compiler was published on the Internet, and the first contributors joined the project. Later, a Linux port was created by Michael van Canneyt, five years before the Borland Kylix Pascal compiler for Linux became available.

The DOS port was adapted for use in OS/2 using the Eberhard Mattes eXtender (EMX) which made OS/2 the second supported compiling target. As well as Florian Klämpfl the original author, Daniël Mantione also contributed significantly to make this happen, providing the original port of the run-time library to OS/2 and EMX. The compiler improved gradually, and the DOS version migrated to the GO32v2 extender. This culminated in release 0.99.5, which was much more widely used than prior versions, and was the last release aiming only for Borland Pascal compliance; later releases added a Delphi compatibility mode. This release was also ported to systems using Motorola 68000 family (m68k) processors.

With release 0.99.8 the Win32 target was added, and a start was made with incorporating some Delphi features. Stabilizing for a non-beta release began, and version 1.0 was released in July 2000. The 1.0.&quot;x&quot; series was widely used, in business and education. For the 1.0.&quot;x&quot; releases, the port to 68k CPU was redone, and the compiler produced stable code for several 68k Unix-like and AmigaOS operating systems.

=== Version 2 ===
During the stabilization of what would become 1.0.&quot;x&quot;, and also when porting to the Motorola 68k systems, it was clear that the design of the code generator was far too limited in many aspects. The principal problems were that adding processors meant rewriting the code generator, and that the register allocation was based on the principle of always keeping three free registers between building blocks, which was inflexible and difficult to maintain.

For these reasons, the 1.1.&quot;x&quot; series branched off from the 1.0.&quot;x&quot; main branch in December 1999. At first, changes were mostly clean-ups and rewrite-redesigns to all parts of the compiler. The code generator and register allocator were also rewritten. Any remaining missing Delphi compatibility was added.

The work on 1.1.x continued slowly but steadily. In late 2003, a working PowerPC port became available, followed by an ARM port in summer 2004, a SPARC port in fall 2004, and an x86-64-AMD64 port in early 2004, which made the compiler available for a 64-bit platform.

In November 2003, a first beta release of the 1.1.&quot;x&quot; branch was packaged and numbered 1.9.0. These were quickly followed by versions 1.9.2 and 1.9.4; the latter introduced OS X support. The work continued with version 1.9.6 (January 2005), 1.9.8 (late February 2005), 2.0.0 (May 2005), 2.0.2 (December 2005), and 2.0.4 (August 2006).

=== Version 2.2.x ===
In 2006, some of the major reworks planned for 2.2, such as the rewrite of the unit system, had still not begun, and it was decided to instead start stabilizing the already implemented features.

Some of the motives for this roadmap change were the needs of the Lazarus integrated development environment project, particularly the internal linker, support for Win64, Windows CE, and OS X on x86, and related features like DWARF. After betas 2.1.2 and 2.1.4, version 2.2.0 was released in September 2007, followed by version 2.2.2 in August 2008 and version 2.2.4 in March 2009.

The 2.2.&quot;x&quot; series vastly improved support for the ActiveX and Component Object Model (COM) interface, and Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), though bugs were still being found. The delegation to interface using the codice_4 keyword was partly implemented, but was not complete . Library support for ActiveX was also improved.

Another major feature was the internal linker for Win32, Win64, and Windows CE, which greatly improved linking time and memory use, and make the compile-link-run cycle in Lazarus much faster. The efficiency for smart-linking, or dead code elimination, was also improved.

Minor new features included improved DWARF (2/3) debug format support, and optimizations such as tail recursion, omission of unneeded stack frames and register-based common subexpression elimination (CSE) optimization. A first implementation of generic programming (generics) support also became available, but only experimentally.

=== Version 2.4.x ===
The 2.4.x release series had a less clear set of goals than earlier releases. The unit system rewrite was postponed again, and the branch that became 2.4 was created to keep risky commits from 2.2 to stabilize it. Mostly these risky commits were more involved improvements to the new platforms, Mac PowerPC 64, Mac x86-64, iPhone, and many fixes to the ARM and x86-64 architectures in general, as well as DWARF.

Other compiler improvements included whole program optimization (WPO) and devirtualization and ARM embedded-application binary interface (EABI) support.

Later, during the 2.2 cycle, a more Delphi-like resource support (based on special sections in the binary instead of Pascal constants) was added. This feature, direly needed by Lazarus, became the main highlight of the branch.

Other more minor additions were a memory manager that improved heap manager performance in threaded environments, small improvements in Delphi compatibility such as codice_5, and improvements in interface delegation.

On January 1, 2010, Free Pascal 2.4.0 was released, followed on November 13, 2010, by bug fix release 2.4.2, with support for codice_6 loops, codice_7 and codice_8 classes, and other changes.

=== Version 2.6.x ===
In January 2012, Free Pascal 2.6 was released. This first version from the 2.6 release series also supported Objective Pascal on OS X and iOS targets and implemented many small improvements and bug fixes. In February 2013, FPC 2.6.2 was released. It contained NetBSD and OpenBSD releases for the first time since 1.0.10, based on fresh ports. In March 2014, the last point release in the 2.6 series, 2.6.4, was launched, featuring mostly database (fcl-db) updates.

=== Version 3.0.x ===
Version 3.0.0 was released on November 25, 2015, and was the first major release since January 1, 2012.
It introduced many new language features.

Version 3.0.2 was released on February 15, 2017, and includes bug fixes and minor compiler updates.
Version 3.0.4 was released on November 28, 2017. 
It includes many language improvements over previous versions, including an internal linker for Executable and Linkable Format (ELF), Arm AARCH64 for iOS and Linux, a revived i8086 platform, extended libraries and much more.

=== Version 3.2.x ===
The next major release, version 3.2.0, was published on June 19, 2020. It introduced many new language features, including generic routines, standard namespaces, managed records and expanded functionality for dynamic arrays, in addition to the advent of new standard units and the support of additional platforms.

Version 3.2.2 was released on May 20, 2021, and supports macOS on AArch64 and naming of threads. Additionally it includes bug fixes and minor compiler updates.

== Targets ==
Free Pascal also supports byte code generation for the Java Virtual Machine as of version 3.0.0 and targets both Oracle&#x27;s Java and Google&#x27;s Android JVM, although Object Pascal syntax is not fully supported. Free Pascal 3.0.0 also supports ARMHF platforms like the Raspberry Pi, including ARMV6-EABIHF running on Raspbian. Work on 64-bit ARM has resulted in support for iOS in 3.0.0 as well. A native ARM Android target has been added, ending the formerly hacked ARM Linux target to generate native ARM libraries for Android. This makes porting Lazarus applications to Android (using Custom Drawn Interface) easier. Since FPC 2.6.2, OpenBSD and NetBSD are supported on IA32 and X86_64 architectures. A new target &quot;embedded&quot; has been added for usage without OS (ARM Cortex M and MIPS mainly). With InstantFPC it is possible to run Pascal programs, which are translated just in time, as Unix scripts or CGI back-end.

Ultibo core is an embedded or bare metal development environment for Raspberry Pi. Ultibo is based on Free Pascal and developed under a modified version of Lazarus. The IDE is PC based but has been ported to Linux and Mac as well. Ultibo is an OS-less runtime and has support for most functions and allows the programmer full control over the hardware via the RTL units. The runtime implements multi-threaded, pre-emptive multitasking. The programmer can put threads on a specific CPU or let the runtime divide the load automatically or a mix of the two. Most Raspberry Pi models are supported including the A, B, A+ and B+ as well as the Raspberry Pi 2B, 3B, 4B/400/CM4 and Zero.

== Integrated development environments ==
Like most modern compilers, Free Pascal can be used with an integrated development environment (IDE). Besides independent IDEs there are also plugins to various existing IDEs
*Lazarus is the most popular IDE used by Free Pascal programmers. It looks and feels similar to the Delphi IDE, and can be used to create console and graphical applications, Windows services, daemons, and web applications. Lazarus provides a cross-platform user interface framework, called Lazarus Component Library (LCL). Graphical applications created with LCL can be ported to another platform via recompiling or cross compiling.
*Free Pascal has its own text-mode IDE resembling Turbo Pascal&#x27;s IDE. It is made using the Free Vision framework (also included with Free Pascal), a Turbo Vision clone. In addition to many features of the Turbo Pascal IDE, it has code completion and support for multiple help file formats (HTML, Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM), Information Presentation Facility (IPF). Instead of using command line tools, the IDE uses its own embedded compiler, based on the same source as the command line compiler and debugger (using libgdb or GDBMI) to provide its functionality.

*Dev-Pascal is a free Windows-only IDE for Free Pascal and GNU Pascal, with no further development following the 2004 FPC version and the 2005 GPC version.

== Bundled libraries ==
Apart from a compiler and an IDE, Free Pascal provides the following libraries:

* Free Pascal Runtime Library (RTL): Basic low-level runtime library for general programming tasks
* Free Component Library (FCL): High-level software component library for general programming tasks

== Examples of software produced with Free Pascal ==
* Beyond Compare is a data comparison utility for Windows, OS X, and Linux. The Linux and OS X versions are compiled with Lazarus/FPC.
* Cartes du Ciel is a free planetarium program for Linux, OS X, and Windows. It maps and labels most constellations, planets, and objects visible by telescope. It was fully written in Lazarus/FPC, and released under GPL.
* Cheat Engine is a proprietary, source available, Freeware memory scanner, hex editor, and debugger. It can be used for cheating in computer games. Since version 6.0 it is compiled with Lazarus/FPC.
* Double Commander is an open-source multi-platform two-panel orthodox file manager inspired by the Microsoft Windows-only Total Commander.

<text>, real name Sano Toyofusa, was a scholar, &quot;kyōka&quot; poet, and &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; artist of Japanese folklore. 

== Early life ==
Born to a family of high-ranking servants to the Tokugawa shogunate, Toriyama was trained by Kanō school artists Kanō Gyokuen and Kanō Chikanobu, although he was never officially recognized as a Kanō school painter.

==Art career==
After retiring from service to the shogunate, Toriyama became a teacher to numerous apprentices in poetry and painting. He was among the first to apply Kanō techniques to &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; printmaking, inventing key new techniques along the way, such as &quot;fuki-bokashi&quot;, which allowed for replicating color gradations. Most famously, he was the teacher of Kitagawa Utamaro and Utagawa Toyoharu.

Sekien is best known for his mass-produced illustrated books of yōkai that had appeared in &quot;Hyakki Yagyō&quot; monster parade scrolls. The first book proved popular enough to spawn three sequels, the last of which features yōkai mainly out of Sekien&#x27;s imagination. Although sometimes described as a &quot;demonologist,&quot; his work is better described as a literary parody of encyclopedias such as the Japanese &quot;Wakan Sansai Zue&quot; or the Chinese &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot;, which were popular in Japan at the time. His portrayals of these creatures from folklore essentially established their visual portrayals in the public&#x27;s mind and deeply inspired other Japanese artists in his own and later eras, including ukiyo-e artists Tsukioka Yoshitoshi, Kawanabe Kyōsai, and manga artist Mizuki Shigeru.

<doc id="638447" wikidata="Q1335007" url="?curid=638447" title="Embedded software">
<text>Embedded software is computer software, written to control machines or devices that are not typically thought of as computers, commonly known as embedded systems. It is typically specialized for the particular hardware that it runs on and has time and memory constraints. This term is sometimes used interchangeably with firmware.

A precise and stable characteristic feature is that no or not all functions of embedded software are initiated/controlled via a human interface, but through machine-interfaces instead.

Manufacturers build embedded software into the electronics of cars, telephones, modems, robots, appliances, toys, security systems, pacemakers, televisions and set-top boxes, and digital watches, for example. This software can be very simple, such as lighting controls running on an 8-bit microcontroller with a few kilobytes of memory with the suitable level of processing complexity determined with a Probably Approximately Correct Computation framework (a methodology based on randomized algorithms). However, embedded software can become very sophisticated in applications such as routers, optical network elements, airplanes, missiles, and process control systems.

==Operating systems==
Unlike standard computers that generally use an operating systems such as macOS, Windows or Linux, embedded software may use no operating system. When they do use one, a wide variety of operating systems can be chosen from, typically a real-time operating system. Code for embedded software is typically written in C or C++, but various high-level programming languages, such as Java, Python and JavaScript, are now also in common use to target microcontrollers and embedded systems. Assembly languages are often used too, especially in booting and interrupt handling. Ada is used in some military and aviation projects.

==Differences from application software==

Most consumers are familiar with application software that provide functionality on a computer. However embedded software is often less visible, but no less complicated. Unlike application software, embedded software has fixed hardware requirements and capabilities, and addition of third-party hardware or software is strictly controlled.

Embedded software needs to include all needed device drivers at manufacturing time, and the device drivers are written for the various hardware devices. These device drivers, called BSP (Board support package), form the layer of software containing hardware-specific drivers and other routines that allow a particular operating system (traditionally a real-time operating system, or RTOS) to function in a particular hardware environment (a computer or CPU card), integrated with the RTOS itself. The software is highly dependent on the CPU and specific chips chosen. Most embedded software engineers have at least a passing knowledge of reading schematics, and reading data sheets for components to determine usage of registers and communication system. Conversion between decimal, hexadecimal and binary is useful as well as using bit manipulation.

Web applications are often used for managing hardware, although XML files and other output may be passed to a computer for display. File systems with folders are typically used, however SQL databases are often absent.

Software development requires use of a cross compiler, which runs on a computer but produces executable code for the target device. Debugging requires use of an in-circuit emulator, and debugging hardware such as JTAG or SWD debuggers. Software developers often have access to the complete kernel (OS) source code.

Size of the storage memory and RAM can vary significantly. Some systems run in 16 KB of Flash and 4 KB of RAM with a CPU operating at 8 MHz, other systems can rival contemporary computers. These space requirements lead to more work being done in C or embedded C++, instead of C++. Interpreted languages like BASIC (while e.g. Parallax Propeller can use compiled BASIC) and Java (Java ME Embedded 8.3 is available for e.g. ARM Cortex-M4, Cortex-M7 microcontrollers and older ARM11 used in Raspberry Pi and Intel Galileo Gen. 2) are not commonly used; while an implementation of the interpreted Python 3 language MicroPython is however available expressly for microcontroller use, e.g. 32-bit ARM-based (such as BBC micro:bit) and 16-bit PIC microcontrollers.

==Communication protocols==
Communications between processors and between one processor and other components are essential. Besides direct memory addressing, hardware level common protocols include I²C, SPI, serial ports, 1-Wires, Ethernets, and USB.

Communications protocols designed for use in embedded systems are available as closed source from companies including InterNiche Technologies and CMX Systems. Open-source protocols stem from uIP, lwip, and others.

<doc id="638448" wikidata="Q1460845" url="?curid=638448" title="Mothers Against Drunk Driving">
<text>Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) is a non-profit organization in the United States, Canada (MADD Canada) and Brazil that seeks to stop driving with any amount of alcohol in the bloodstream, support those affected by drunk driving, prevent underage drinking, and strive for stricter impaired driving policy, whether that impairment is caused by alcohol or any other drug. The Irving, Texas-based organization was founded on September 5, 1980, in California by Candace Lightner after her 13-year-old daughter, Cari, was killed by a drunk driver. There is at least one MADD office in every state of the United States and at least one in each province of Canada. These offices offer victim services and many resources involving alcohol safety. MADD has claimed that drunk driving has been reduced by half since its founding.

==Positions==
According to MADD&#x27;s website, &quot;The mission of Mothers Against Drunk Driving is to end drunk driving, help fight drugged driving, support the victims of these violent crimes and prevent underage drinking.&quot; Generally MADD favors strict policy in a variety of areas, including an illegal blood alcohol content of .08% or lower and using stronger sanctions for DUI offenders, including mandatory jail sentences, treatment for alcoholism and other alcohol abuse issues, ignition interlock devices, and license suspensions; maintaining the minimum legal drinking age at 21 years; and mandating alcohol breath-testing ignition interlock devices for everyone convicted of driving while legally impaired.

MADD&#x27;s founder Candace Lightner left the group in 1985. In the same year, Stevie Wonder added the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Drive Drunk&quot; on the &quot;Woman in Red&quot; movie soundtrack that referenced MADD and summarized its policy positions.

In 2002, as reported by &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, Lightner stated that MADD &quot;has become far more neo-prohibitionist than I had ever wanted or envisioned … I didn&#x27;t start MADD to deal with alcohol. I started MADD to deal with the issue of drunk driving&quot;.

Author Susan Cheever and the SAGE &quot;Encyclopedia of Social Problems&quot; have said MADD is a manifestation of the temperance movement. MADD &quot;supports a substantial increase in taxation on alcoholic beverages as a means of covering the cost to society caused by misuse of alcohol&quot;. MADD &quot;advocates that schools and other organizations hosting social and athletic gatherings for youth take positive steps to ensure that alcoholic beverages not be present at those gatherings&quot;.

==History==
On May 3, 1980, Carime Lightner, a 13-year-old girl, was killed by a drunken hit-and-run driver at Sunset and New York Avenues in Fair Oaks, California. The 46-year-old driver, who had recently been arrested for another DUI hit-and-run, left Carime&#x27;s body at the scene. Carime&#x27;s mother, Candace (Candy) Lightner, organized Mothers Against Drunk Driving and subsequently served as its founding president. A 1983 television movie about Lightner garnered publicity for the group, which grew rapidly.

In the early 1980s, the group attracted the attention of the United States Congress. Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) did not like the fact that youth in New Jersey could easily travel to New York to purchase alcoholic beverages, circumventing New Jersey&#x27;s law restricting consumption to those 21 years old and older.

The group had its greatest success with the enacting of a 1984 federal law, the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, that introduced a federal penalty (a 5%—later raised to 10%—loss of federal highway dollars), for states that did not raise the minimum legal age for the purchase and possession of alcohol to 21. After the United States Supreme Court upheld the law in the 1987 case of &quot;South Dakota v. Dole&quot;, every state and the District of Columbia made the necessary adjustments by 1988 (but not the territories of Puerto Rico and Guam). In July 2010, Guam did raise its drinking age to 21.

In 1988, a drunk driver traveling the wrong way on Interstate 71 in Kentucky caused a head-on collision with a school bus; twenty-seven people died and dozens more were injured in the ensuing fire. Known as the Carrollton bus disaster, it equaled another bus crash in Kentucky in 1958 as the deadliest bus crash in U.S. history. In the aftermath, several parents of the victims became actively involved in MADD and one became its national president.

In 1990, MADD Canada was founded with Toronto activist John Bates as chair.

In 1994, &quot;The Chronicle of Philanthropy&quot; released the results of the largest study of charitable and non-profit organization popularity and credibility. The study showed that MADD was ranked as the &quot;most popular charity/non-profit in America of over 100 charities researched with 51% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing &#x27;Love&#x27; and &#x27;Like A Lot&#x27; for MADD&quot;.

MADD released its first &quot;Rating the States&quot; report, grading the states in their progress against drunk driving, in 1991; as of this date, the report has been released an additional four times.

In 1999, MADD&#x27;s National Board of Directors unanimously voted to change the organization&#x27;s mission statement to include the prevention of underage drinking.

In 2002, MADD announced its &quot;Eight-Point Plan&quot;. This consisted of:
# Resuscitating the nation&#x27;s efforts to prevent impaired driving.
# Increasing driving while intoxicated (DWI)/driving under the influence (DUI) enforcement, especially the use of frequent, highly publicized sobriety checkpoints.
# Enacting primary enforcement seat belt laws in all states.
# Creating tougher, more comprehensive sanctions geared toward higher-risk drivers.
# Developing a dedicated National Traffic Safety Fund.
# Reducing underage drinking.
# Increasing beer excise taxes to the same level as those for spirits.
# Reinvigorating court monitoring programs.

In a November 2006 press release, MADD launched its &#x27;Campaign to Eliminate Drunk Driving&#x27;: this is a four-point plan to eliminate drunk driving in the United States using a combination of current technology (such as alcohol ignition interlock devices), new technology in smart cars, law enforcement, and grass roots activism.

MADD&#x27;s national president was Millie I. Webb in 2002. Chuck Hurley became MADD CEO in 2005. He retired in June 2010 and was replaced by Kimberly Earle, who had been CEO of Susan G. Komen for the Cure since 2007. Earle left to become the president of a new foundation of Sanford Health in January 2012, the Edith Sanford Breast Cancer Foundation. Debbie Weir replaced her as MADD&#x27;s CEO.

In 2019, MADD Brazil was founded.

==Funding==
According to Obama-Coburn Federal Funding Accountability Transparency Act of 2006, MADD received $56,814 in funds from the federal government in fiscal year 2000, and a total of $9,593,455 between fiscal years 2001 and 2006.

In 1994, &quot;Money&quot; magazine reported that telemarketers raised over $38 million for MADD, keeping nearly half of it in fees. This relationship continues to date.

In 2001, &quot;Worth&quot; magazine listed MADD as one of its &quot;100 best charities&quot;.

In 2005, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that the American Institute of Philanthropy was reducing MADD from a &quot;C&quot; to a &quot;D&quot; in its ratings. The Institute noted that MADD categorizes much of its fundraising expenses as &quot;educational expenses&quot;, and that up to 58% of its revenue was expended on what the Institute considered fundraising and management.

Charity Navigator rated MADD at 63.53 out of 100 on its financial rating scale and 96.00 out of 100 on its accountability and transparency scale for its 2013 fiscal year. MADD reported that it spent 24.4% of its total expenses on fundraising that year.

In 2014, MADD spent over $9 million on fundraising activities according to its 2014 tax return.

==Activities and criticisms==
Radley Balko, an advocate for decriminalizing drunk driving, argued in a December 2002 article that MADD&#x27;s policies were becoming overbearing. &quot;In fairness, MADD deserves credit for raising awareness of the dangers of driving while intoxicated. It was almost certainly MADD&#x27;s dogged efforts to spark public debate that effected the drop in fatalities since 1980, when Candy Lightner founded the group after her daughter was killed by a drunk driver,&quot; Balko wrote. &quot;But MADD is at heart a bureaucracy, a big one. It boasts an annual budget of $45 million, $12 million of which pays for salaries, pensions and benefits. Bureaucracies don&#x27;t change easily, even when the problems they were created to address change.&quot; CharityWatch gives MADD a &quot;C−&quot; grade.

===Drunk driving laws===
MADD was heavily involved in lobbying to reduce the legal limit for blood alcohol from BAC .10 to BAC .08. In 2000, this standard was passed by Congress and by 2004, every state had a legal .08 BAC limit. MADD Canada has called for a maximum legal BAC of .05. Although many MADD leaders have supported a lower limit, MADD has not called for a legal limit of .05 in the United States.

===Victim impact panels===
MADD promotes the use of victim impact panels (VIPs), in which judges require DWI offenders to hear victims or relatives of victims of drunk driving crashes relate their experiences. MADD received $5,547,693 in 2010 from VIPs; much of this income was voluntary donations by those attending as some states do not allow a fee to be charged to offenders for non-legislative programs. Other states like California and Georgia require that a fee be paid in order to attend. In California, this fee ranges from $25 to $50 depending on the county and in Georgia this fee is $50. Some states in the United States, such as Massachusetts, permit victims of all crimes, including drunk driving crashes, to give victim impact statements prior to sentencing so that judges and prosecutors can consider the impact on victims in deciding on an appropriate sentence to recommend or impose. The presentations are often emotional, detailed, and graphic, and focus on the tragic negative consequences of DWI and alcohol-related crashes. According to the John Howard Society, some studies have shown that permitting victims to make statements and to give testimony is psychologically beneficial to them and aids in their recovery and in their satisfaction with the criminal justice system. A New Mexico study suggested that the VIPs tended to be perceived as confrontational by multiple offenders. Such offenders then had a higher incidence of future offenses.

===&quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;===
On April 29, 2008, MADD issued a press release criticizing the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; saying it was &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; with the manufacturers. MADD has called on the ESRB to re-rate the game to Adults Only. They also called on the manufacturer (Rockstar) &quot;to consider a stop in distribution – if not out of responsibility to society then out of respect for the millions of victims/survivors of drunk driving.&quot; Players can drive drunk in &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; but doing so makes it harder to drive. The game also explicitly recommends that the player take a taxi instead of driving, and the character makes humorous remarks suggesting that it is bad to drive drunk. Ignoring these will lead to consequences: if any police officer is around while the player is drunk driving, the player immediately becomes wanted by the police.

===Blood alcohol content===
Prior to MADD&#x27;s influence, drunk driving laws addressed the danger by making it a criminal offense to drive a vehicle while impaired — that is, while &quot;under the influence of alcohol&quot;; the amount of alcohol in the body was evidence of that impairment. The level specified at that time — commonly, 0.15% — was high enough to indicate drunkenness rather than impairment. In part due to MADD&#x27;s influence, all 50 states have now passed laws making it a criminal offense to drive with a designated level of alcohol of .08% or higher.

===Sobriety checkpoints===
MADD writes that &quot;opponents of sobriety checkpoints tend to be those who drink and drive frequently and are concerned about being caught&quot;.

Radley Balko, opponent of limits on drunk driving and writer for &quot;Reason Magazine&quot;, discusses the possible social implications of some of MADD&#x27;s policies in a 2002 article. He writes, &quot;In its eight-point plan to &#x27;jump-start the stalled war on drunk driving,&#x27; MADD advocates the use of highly publicized but random roadblocks to find drivers who have been drinking.&quot;

===Beer taxes===
Balko criticizes MADD for not advocating higher excise taxes on distilled spirits, even though it campaigns for higher excise taxes for beer. He writes, &quot;Interestingly, MADD refrains from calling for an added tax on distilled spirits, an industry that the organization has partnered with on various drunk driving awareness projects.&quot; MADD writes, &quot;Currently, the federal excise tax is $.05 per can of beer, $.04 for a glass of wine and $.12 for a shot of distilled spirits, which all contain about the same amount of alcohol.&quot; Point 7 of MADD&#x27;s 8-Point Plan is to &quot;Increase beer excise taxes to equal the current excise tax on distilled spirits&quot;.

===Breath alcohol ignition interlock devices ===

Additionally, MADD has proposed that breath alcohol ignition interlock devices should be installed in all new cars. Tom Incantalupo of Newsday wrote: &quot;Ultimately, the group said yesterday, it wants so-called alcohol interlock devices factory-installed in all new cars. &quot;The main reason why people continue to drive drunk today is because they can,&quot; MADD president Glynn Birch said at a news teleconference from Washington, D.C.&quot;

Sarah Longwell, a spokeswoman for the restaurant lobbying group American Beverage Institute, responded to MADD&#x27;s proposals for ignition interlocks by stating &quot;This interlock campaign is not about eliminating drunk driving, it is about eliminating all moderate drinking prior to driving. The 40 million Americans who drink and drive responsibly should be outraged.&quot; She also points out that &quot;Many states have laws that set the presumptive level of intoxication at .05% and you can&#x27;t adjust your interlock depending on which state you&#x27;re driving in. Moreover, once you factor in liability issues and sharing vehicles with underage drivers you have pushed the preset limit down to about .02%. It will be a &quot;de facto&quot; zero tolerance policy.&quot;

A review by the California Department of Motor Vehicles concluded that &quot;interlock works for some offenders in some contexts, but not for all offenders in all situations. More specifically, ignition interlock devices work best when they are installed, although there is also some evidence that judicial orders to install an interlock are effective for repeat DUI offenders, even when not all offenders comply and install a device. California&#x27;s administrative program, where repeat DUI offenders install an interlock device in order to obtain restricted driving privileges, is also associated with reductions in subsequent DUI incidents. One group for whom ignition interlock orders do not appear effective is first DUI offenders with high blood alcohol levels.&quot;

<doc id="638449" wikidata="Q846270" url="?curid=638449" title="Gastric acid">
<text>Gastric acid or stomach acid is the acidic component – hydrochloric acid of gastric juice, produced by parietal cells in the gastric glands of the stomach lining. In humans, the pH is between one and three, much lower than most other animals, but is very similar to that of carrion eating carnivores, needing protection from ingesting pathogens.

With this higher acidity, gastric acid plays a key protective role against pathogens. It is also key in the digestion of proteins by activating digestive enzymes, which together break down the long chains of amino acids. Gastric acid is regulated in feedback systems to increase production when needed, such as after a meal. Other cells in the stomach produce bicarbonate, a base, to buffer the fluid, ensuring a regulated pH. These cells also produce mucus – a viscous barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach. The pancreas further produces large amounts of bicarbonate, secreting this through the pancreatic duct to the duodenum to neutralize gastric acid passing into the digestive tract.

The secretion is a complex and relatively energetically expensive process. Parietal cells contain an extensive secretory network (called canaliculi) from which the hydrochloric acid is secreted into the lumen of the stomach. The pH level is maintained by the proton pump H+/K+ ATPase. The parietal cell releases bicarbonate into the bloodstream in the process, which causes a temporary rise of pH in the blood, known as an alkaline tide.

The gastric juice also contains digestive enzymes produced by other cells in the gastric glands – gastric chief cells. Gastric chief cells secrete an inactivated pepsinogen. Once in the stomach lumen gastric acid activates the proenzyme to pepsin.

==Secretion==
A typical adult human stomach will secrete about 1.5 liters of gastric juice daily. Gastric juice is the combination of gastric gland secretions including the main component of hydrochloric acid (gastric acid), gastric lipase and pepsinogen. Once in the stomach pepsinogen is changed by gastric acid to the digestive enzyme pepsin adding this enzyme to the gastric juice. In humans, the pH of gastric acid is between one and three, much lower than most other animals, but is very similar to that of carrion eating carnivores, needing extra protection from ingesting pathogens.

Gastric acid secretion is produced in several steps. Chloride and hydrogen ions are secreted separately from the cytoplasm of parietal cells and mixed in the canaliculi. This creates a negative potential of between −40and−70mV across the parietal cell membrane that causes potassium ions and a small number of sodium ions to diffuse from the cytoplasm into the parietal cell canaliculi. Gastric acid is then secreted along with other gland secretions into the gastric pit for release into the stomach lumen. 

The enzyme carbonic anhydrase catalyses the reaction between carbon dioxide and water to form carbonic acid. This acid immediately dissociates into hydrogen and bicarbonate ions. The hydrogen ions leave the cell through H+/K+ ATPase antiporter pumps.

At the same time, sodium ions are actively reabsorbed . This means that the majority of secreted K+ (potassium) and Na+ (sodium) ions return to the cytoplasm. In the canaliculus, secreted hydrogen and chloride ions mix and are secreted into the lumen of the oxyntic gland.

The highest concentration that gastric acid reaches in the stomach is 160mM in the canaliculi. This is about 3 million times that of arterial blood, but almost exactly isotonic with other bodily fluids. The lowest pH of the secreted acid is 0.8, but the acid is diluted in the stomach lumen to a pH of between 1 and 3.

There is a small continuous basal secretion of gastric acid between meals of usually less than 10mEq/hour.

There are three phases in the secretion of gastric acid which increase the secretion rate in order to digest a meal:

# The cephalic phase: Thirty percent of the total gastric acid secretions to be produced is stimulated by anticipation of eating and the smell or taste of food. This signalling occurs from higher centres in the brain through the vagus nerve (Cranial Nerve X). It activates parietal cells to release acid and ECL cells to release histamine. The vagus nerve (CN X) also releases gastrin releasing peptide onto G cells. Finally, it also inhibits somatostatin release from D cells.
# The gastric phase: About sixty percent of the total acid for a meal is secreted in this phase. Acid secretion is stimulated by distension of the stomach and by amino acids present in the food.
# The intestinal phase: The remaining 10% of acid is secreted when chyme enters the small intestine, and is stimulated by small intestine distension and by amino acids. The duodenal cells release entero-oxyntin which acts on parietal cells without affecting gastrin.

==Regulation of secretion==

Gastric acid production is regulated by both the autonomic nervous system and several hormones. The parasympathetic nervous system, via the vagus nerve, and the hormone gastrin stimulate the parietal cell to produce gastric acid, both directly acting on parietal cells and indirectly, through the stimulation of the secretion of the hormone histamine from enterochromaffin-like cells (ECLs). Vasoactive intestinal peptide, cholecystokinin, and secretin all inhibit production.

The production of gastric acid in the stomach is tightly regulated by positive regulators and negative feedback mechanisms. Four types of cells are involved in this process: parietal cells, G cells, D cells and enterochromaffin-like cells. Beside this, the endings of the vagus nerve (CN X) and the intramural nervous plexus in the digestive tract influence the secretion significantly.

Nerve endings in the stomach secrete two stimulatory neurotransmitters: acetylcholine and gastrin-releasing peptide. Their action is both direct on parietal cells and mediated through the secretion of gastrin from G cells and histamine from enterochromaffin-like cells. Gastrin acts on parietal cells directly and indirectly too, by stimulating the release of histamine.

The release of histamine is the most important positive regulation mechanism of the secretion of gastric acid in the stomach. Its release is stimulated by gastrin and acetylcholine and inhibited by somatostatin.

==Neutralization==
In the duodenum, gastric acid is neutralized by bicarbonate. This also blocks gastric enzymes that have their optima in the acid range of pH. The secretion of bicarbonate from the pancreas is stimulated by secretin. This polypeptide hormone gets activated and secreted from so-called S cells in the mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum when the pH in the duodenum falls below 4.5 to 5.0. The neutralization is described by the equation:

:HCl + NaHCO3 → NaCl + H2CO3

The carbonic acid rapidly equilibrates with carbon dioxide and water through catalysis by carbonic anhydrase enzymes bound to the gut epithelial lining, leading to a net release of carbon dioxide gas within the lumen associated with neutralisation. In the absorptive upper intestine, such as the duodenum, both the dissolved carbon dioxide and carbonic acid will tend to equilibrate with the blood, leading to most of the gas produced on neutralisation being exhaled through the lungs.

== Clinical significance ==
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common disorder that occurs when stomach acid repeatedly flows back into the esophagus, this backwash of acid (reflux) also known as heartburn can irritate the lining of the esophagus. Most people are able to manage the discomfort of GERD with lifestyle changes and medications, notably proton pump inhibitors, and H2 blockers. Antacids may also be used to neutralise gastric acid. Sometimes, surgery may be needed to ease symptoms.

Chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa can lead to atrophic gastritis resulting in a decreased secretion of gastric acid, and consequent digestive problems.

In hypochlorhydria and achlorhydria, gastric acid is either low or absent, respectively. This can potentially lead to less protection against ingested pathogens such as &quot;Vibrio&quot; or &quot;Helicobacter&quot; bacteria.

In Zollinger–Ellison syndrome gastrin levels are increased, leading to excess gastric acid production, which can cause gastric ulcers.
Hypercalcemia also increases gastrin and gastric acid and can cause ulcers.

In diseases featuring excess vomiting, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (decreased blood acidity by H+ and chlorine depletion) may develop.

== History ==

The role of gastric acid in digestion was established in the 1820s and 1830s by William Beaumont on Alexis St. Martin, who, as a result of an accident, had a fistula (hole) in his stomach, which allowed Beaumont to observe the process of digestion and to extract gastric acid, verifying that acid played a crucial role in digestion.

<text>Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings is a real-time strategy video game developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft. Released in 1999 for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh in 2001, it is the second game in the &quot;Age of Empires&quot; series. &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; is set in the Middle Ages and contains 13 playable civilizations. Players aim to gather resources, which they use to build towns, create armies, and defeat their enemies. There are 5 historically based campaigns, which conscript the player to specialized and story-backed conditions, and 3 additional single-player game modes; multiplayer is also supported.

Despite using the same game engine and code similar to its predecessor&#x27;s, development of &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; took a year longer than expected, forcing Ensemble Studios to release &quot;Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome&quot; in 1998 instead. The design team focused on resolving significant issues in &quot;Age of Empires&quot;, but noted on release that some problems remained.

Reception of &quot;Age of Empires II&quot; was highly positive. The significant number of new features was praised, as were the gameplay improvements. 3 months after its release, two million copies of &quot;Age of Empires II&quot; had been shipped, and it topped sales charts in seven countries. The game won multiple awards and is today considered a classic of its type, having had a significant impact on future games in its genre. The original &quot;Age of Empires II&quot; and its 2000 expansion pack, &quot;The Conquerors&quot;, were later released as &quot;The Gold Edition&quot;. &quot;Age of Empires II&quot; is often considered one of the greatest games ever made.

An updated high-definition graphics version of the game, &quot;Age of Empires II: HD Edition&quot;, was released in 2013. The &quot;HD Edition&quot; includes the original game and the expansion &quot;The Conquerors&quot;, as well as new campaigns, civilizations, and updated graphics for high-resolution displays. A remaster, &quot;Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition&quot;, was released in November 2019.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Age of Empires II&quot; is a real-time strategy game that focuses on building towns, gathering resources, and creating armies to defeat opponents. Players conquer rival towns and empires as they advance one of 13 civilizations through four &quot;Ages&quot;: the Dark Age, the Feudal Age, the Castle Age (representing the High Middle Ages), and the Imperial Age (reminiscent of the Renaissance)—a 1,000-year timeframe. Advancing to a new Age unlocks new units, structures, and technologies, but players must first build certain buildings from their current age and then pay a sum of resources.

Civilian units, called &quot;villagers&quot;, are used to gather resources; they are either male or female—sex does not affect their abilities. Resources can be used to train units, construct buildings, and research technologies, among other things; for example, players can research better armour for infantry units. The game features four types of resources: food, wood, gold, and stone. Food is obtained by hunting animals, gathering berries, harvesting livestock, farming, and fishing, both from shore and from boats. Wood is gathered by chopping down trees. Gold is obtained from either gold mines, trade, or collecting relics in a monastery. Stone is collected from stone mines. Villagers require checkpoints, typically depository buildings (town center, mining camp, mill, and lumber yard), in order to store gathered resources.

Each civilization can purchase upgrades that increase the rate of gathering these resources. Players can also construct a marketplace for trade, where they can trade wood, stone, and food for gold, and use gold to buy other resources. Market prices fluctuate with every transaction. Furthermore, markets and docks can also generate gold by using trading carts or cogs, which are sent to visit foreign markets and ports; once they return to the player&#x27;s market/dock, gold is added to the stockpile. The amount of gold a trade unit earns on each trip is based on the distance it needed to travel to a foreign market; more gold is earned on longer trips. It is possible to trade with enemies&#x27; markets or docks, but the player&#x27;s trading units may be attacked or destroyed by enemy units in the process. Players do not need to keep trading manually, because once they select the port or market the trading units continue to trade automatically and indefinitely.

There are 5 campaigns in &quot;The Age of Kings&quot;, containing historically based scenarios such as Genghis Khan&#x27;s invasion of Eurasia, Barbarossa&#x27;s Crusade, and Saladin&#x27;s defence of the Holy Land. In the Joan of Arc and William Wallace campaigns, the player can control a unit based on its namesake; in others, players take orders from guiding spirits representative of the army&#x27;s commander.

Additional game modes are available to the player in &quot;The Age of Kings&quot;. One mode, random map, generates a map from one of several randomly chosen map-generating scripts, with players starting in the Dark Age with a Town Center, three villagers (or more depending on the civilization), and a scout unit. The game can be won through military conquest, by constructing a special building known as a Wonder and keeping it standing for a certain amount of time, or by obtaining control of all relics on the map for a set amount of time. Deathmatch mode allows players to begin with large amounts of resources, creating a focus on military dominance, while in the regicide mode each player is given a king unit, winning by killing all of the other monarchs.

===Units and civilizations===
Every player has an ultimate limit to the number of units they can create—a population limit—but cannot immediately use this entire potential population. The population capacity, which can be capped at anywhere between 25 and 200 in intervals of 25, is based on the number of houses, Castles, or Town Centers—the main building in a player&#x27;s town—which have been built. &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; introduced two significant new features for unit management: the idle villager button, which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task, and the town bell, which sends all of the player&#x27;s villagers into their Town Center, Castle, or tower for safety; units garrisoned within these 3 buildings, especially archers, increase the building&#x27;s firepower (towers fire more arrows with units garrisoned inside), including the Town Center, which cannot fire anything at all without someone garrisoned there.

&quot;The Age of Kings&quot; also includes five types of military units: infantry, archers, cavalry, siege weapons, and naval units. Certain types of infantry, archers, and cavalry are &quot;counter units&quot; with special defenses against other types of units. The three human classes of military generally follow a rock-paper-scissors model. For example, infantry are generally powerful against buildings but weak against cavalry, thus the infantry counter units—spearmen and pikemen—have attack bonuses against cavalry.

Each civilization in &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; has one or two special units that are exclusive to that civilization. For example, the Britons have access to longbowmen, an archery unit with increased range. These civilization-specific units are generally more powerful, but still follow the basic rock-paper-scissors model. The monk is a special kind of military unit that has the ability to convert enemy units to the player&#x27;s civilization, and to heal allied units. Monks are also used to collect relics, which accumulate gold once held in the player&#x27;s monastery—the more relics are captured, the faster the gold is accumulated. Collecting all relics on the map is one method by which a player can win a random map game, depending on the victory condition. Once a player has all the relics in their monasteries, a timer is shown to all players. The player holding all of the relics wins if they maintain control of the relics for the length of the timer.

Players choose to play as one of 13 civilizations split into 4 architectural styles—Western European (Britons, Celts, and Franks), Central European (Goths, Teutons, Vikings), Middle Eastern (Byzantines, Persians, Saracens, and Turks), and East Asian (Chinese, Japanese, and Mongols) —that determine building appearance in-game. The civilizations have varying strengths and weaknesses with regards to economics, technology, and combat, and each has access to one or more different, very powerful &quot;Unique Units&quot;. Additionally, each civilization provides an individual team bonus in team games. To add variety, each civilization has a set of sound bites in its native language that are uttered by units when selected or instructed to perform a task.

===Buildings===
Buildings in &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; are split into economic and military categories. Buildings can research technologies and upgrades that increase economic, military, or unit-based efficiency, as well as provide resources for the player.

The most important economic building is the Town Center, where villagers are created, all types of resources can be stored, some technologies are researched, and the player can advance to the next Age. The Town Center can fire arrows at enemy units if villagers or archers are garrisoned inside while enemy units are within range. Other economic buildings include storage buildings for resources, farms, docks (the dock may also produce several military ships), and houses to support a higher population.

Military buildings include unit-producing buildings such as barracks, archery ranges, stables, and castles, as well as defensive buildings such as walls and towers. Military buildings can conduct research to improve the abilities of military units, increasing their strength, defensive capabilities, or other capabilities. Castles are a key offensive and defensive building as they can build trebuchets, train the civilization&#x27;s &quot;unique unit/s&quot;, and fire a hail of arrows at enemy units within range, with garrisoned units firing extra arrows. Castles can only be built after a player has reached the Castle Age, although in some game options, players begin with an already-built castle as early as the Dark Age.

After advancing to the Imperial Age, players can also construct a Wonder, an expensive non-military building. On many gameplay modes building a Wonder triggers a victory countdown; unless it is destroyed within a certain timeframe, the player who built it wins. Every civilization&#x27;s Wonder is in the shape of a real-world landmark unique to that historical culture.

===Single player campaigns===
&quot;The Age of Kings&quot; shipped with five campaigns, each having multiple playable scenarios that progress a story line, and each centered around a different civilization. The campaign of William Wallace (Celts) serves as a tutorial campaign, and teaches the player how to move units, gather resources, and build armies to defeat the enemy. It takes place during the Wars of Scottish Independence against the English under King Edward I Longshanks. In the Frankish campaign, the player leads Joan of Arc against the English in the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The Saracen campaign features Saladin and his efforts to repulse Crusaders in the Middle East, while the Mongol campaign documents Genghis Khan&#x27;s conquest of Eurasia; finally, the Teuton campaign focuses on Frederick Barbarossa&#x27;s ambitious expansion of the Holy Roman Empire. The campaigns are sorted numerically to distinguish difficulty, with the William Wallace campaign being the easiest and Barbarossa and Saladin being the two most challenging.

===Multiplayer===
&quot;The Age of Kings&quot; supports multiplayer over the Internet, or via a local area network (LAN). Up to eight players can take part in one game, with all of the single-player game modes available. The MSN Gaming Zone supported the game until the service closed on June 19, 2006. After that, various multiplayer gaming services such as GameRanger supported it. Since April 2013, Steam supports in-game multiplayer for HD resolution

==Development==
Prior to the completion of &quot;Age of Empires&quot;, Ensemble Studios had signed a contract with Microsoft for a sequel. The design team chose to set &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; in the Middle Ages as a logical progression from the ancient era setting of &quot;Age of Empires&quot;. The design team was conscious of attempting to capture the broad appeal of the first game without making the game&#x27;s design too similar. Nonetheless, they attempted to appeal to the vast demographic who played &quot;Age of Empires&quot;. &quot;The Age of Kings&quot;″s design team intended to complete the game within a year by using code from the original and reusing the Genie game engine. Several months into the process they found they would not be able to complete a game of the quality they sought in that time. Ensemble Studios informed Microsoft they would need another year and instead created &quot;Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome&quot;, an easily developed expansion pack of &quot;Age of Empires&quot;, as a compromise which could be released for Christmas 1998. To help meet the next year&#x27;s deadline, additional programmers, artists, and designers were employed. To overcome another significant objection to the original game—its path-finding—the team completely redesigned the game engine&#x27;s movement system. The game took two years to complete with 50 full-time employees on a budget of less than $10 million.

The original &quot;Age of Empires&quot; was criticized for its artificial intelligence (AI), which did not &quot;cheat&quot; by attributing itself extra resources or using other techniques the human player could not, making it easier to defeat than in many other real-time strategy games. For &quot;The Age of Kings&quot;, Ensemble Studios attempted to develop a more powerful AI system that still did not compromise by cheating. Industry veteran Mario Grimani led Ensemble Studios in the creation of the new system. &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; saw the introduction of a triggers system for its scenario editor. The triggers allow messages to be displayed, or actions to take place, based on pre-set criteria or &quot;events&quot;. The scenario editor was also improved by the new AI system. The AI and trigger systems interacted regularly in the single-player campaigns.

The team was less successful in resolving other issues; programmer Matt Pritchard complained following the release of &quot;Age of Empires&quot; that there was still no process by which patches could be issued. Extensive cheating in multiplayer games of &quot;Age of Empires&quot; came as a result of several bugs in the game, which resulted in Microsoft promising Ensemble Studios there would be a patch process for &quot;The Age of Kings&quot;. Upon release, there were several bugs that needed immediate attention, but the patch process was not yet ready. The first patch was released 11 months later.

Ensemble Studios developed a new terrain system for &quot;The Age of Kings&quot;, with 3D presentation capabilities that were vastly superior to those of &quot;Age of Empires&quot;. Pritchard noted an improvement in the team&#x27;s artistic abilities following their work on the past two games, and he is noted as saying that &quot;&quot;AoK&quot; became a showcase for their improved talent&quot;. However, he complained about the lack of an art asset management tool, while other departments gained new tools and automated procedures to assist in design and play testing.

===Audio===
The soundtrack for &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; was directed by Stephen Rippy, who has since taken that role for all games in the &quot;Age of Empires&quot; series. Music for the game was split into two categories. For &quot;in-game&quot; music, Rippy&#x27;s team took musical elements from a variety of cultures and combined them to create a mixed sound. &quot;Pre-game&quot; music was designed to be unique to the civilization in question. Campaigns based on historical figures would include &quot;a theme that will at least be rooted in [the character&#x27;s] culture&quot;.

==Release==
A demo of &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; was released on October 16, 1999. It featured the learning campaign, a sample of a random map game, and the ability to play via the MSN Gaming Zone. Much to Ensemble Studios&#x27; disappointment, numerous incomplete versions of the game were leaked. These were picked up by warez sites, and sold illegally throughout the Pacific Rim; warez versions of the game were even sold outside Microsoft&#x27;s offices in South Korea.

==Reception==
===Sales===
In January 2000, three months after its release, Microsoft had shipped two million copies of &quot;The Age of Kings&quot;. The game topped sales charts in the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Australia, and South Korea. It spent the next two and a half years on top 20 sales lists. &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; was the top-selling game in October 1999, and the fourth highest-selling game in 1999. The game&#x27;s sales in the United States alone totaled 469,376 by the end of 1999, which drew revenues of $20.2 million, the second-highest domestic gross that year behind &quot;SimCity 3000&quot;. Domestic sales rose another 442,318 units ($19.56 million) from January through October 2000, according to PC Data. It finished the year as the seventh-largest computer game hit in the United States, with 595,016 in sales and $26.2 million in revenue. &quot;Age of Empires II&quot;″s domestic success continued in 2001: with sales of 478,557 units ($19.4 million), it claimed tenth place for the year.

In the German market, &quot;Age of Empires II&quot; debuted in first place on Media Control&#x27;s sales charts during October 1999, and by March 2000 had spent 17 weeks in the rankings. It received the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland&#x27;s (VUD) &quot;Platinum&quot; award within one month of release, indicating sales of 200,000 units across Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. By the end of February 2000, it had reached &quot;Double-Platinum&quot; status (400,000 sales) and become the German market&#x27;s &quot;most successful PC game of the past 12 months&quot;, according to the VUD. The game later received a &quot;Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA) for at least 300,000 copies sold in the United Kingdom.

Between the 2019 re-release and global lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the game has seen a resurgence in popularity.

===Critical reviews===
&quot;The Age of Kings&quot; received a 92% positive rating according to video game review aggregator Metacritic, based on 21 critics’ reviews.

According to Eurogamer&#x27;s Geoff Richards, &quot;the list of new features and improvements over the original game is over a page long&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s review similarly focused on &quot;new additions to the genre itself&quot; which it argued made &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; outstanding. These included the idle unit button and town bell. GameSpy&#x27;s Carlos Salgado was appreciative of other features; he praised the ability to create individual profiles for different players and to customize hotkeys. Meanwhile, IGN appreciated the new abilities given to the villager unit—the review stated villagers &quot;now play an important role not only in the collection of resources, but also in town defense and even in combat.&quot;

AllGame&#x27;s Michael L. House enjoyed the use of sound bites in civilizations&#x27; native languages, which he said was &quot;very influential in developing an era-enhancing atmosphere&quot;. Eurogamer said this feature &quot;gives [villagers] a personality, rather than the standard &#x27;Acknowledged&#x27; grunt of military RTS games&quot;, also stating that the use of female villagers provided a good variety. Game Revolution&#x27;s review explained that by being set in a more recent epoch of human history, &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; was able to &quot;add character to an otherwise impersonal style of gameplay&quot;. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; approved of &quot;The Age of Kings&quot;″ use of shorter, more focused campaigns, compared to its predecessor, while Game Revolution noted that even in slower sections of the campaign, the historical narrative helped maintain player interest. GameSpot said that with the screen full of units, &quot;you can begin to imagine how their historical equivalents once prospered&quot;, while GameSpy said &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; presents &quot;realism rarely seen in the RTS genre&quot;. IGN staff argued that while the strengths and weaknesses attributed to different civilizations made the game more realistic, the fact that they were still mostly the same prevented &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; from &quot;delivering the same battlefield impact of &quot;StarCraft&quot; or &quot;Tiberian Sun&quot;&quot;.

House also praised the gameplay interface, which he said &quot;couldn&#x27;t be simpler&quot;, as well as the advanced unit grouping and path-finding systems. Nash Werner of &quot;GamePro&quot; said that the battlefield formation tools were wonderful, and complained only that they could not be assigned to naval units. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; generally agreed, stating that &quot;the controls are very user-friendly and well explained&quot;. GameSpot&#x27;s Greg Kasavin wrote that despite the game&#x27;s improved graphics, &quot;there&#x27;s nothing foreign about its appearance&quot; and that most game features will be &quot;immediately recognizable if you&#x27;ve played a real-time strategy game before&quot;. &quot;PC Zone&quot; agreed, but in a negative sense—it argued that &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; &quot;is essentially an update of a two-year-old game&quot;.

Richards was surprised by the quality of &quot;The Age of Kings&quot;″ graphics, considering they were all bitmapped. However, AllGame complained that units were sometimes difficult to tell apart, a point numerous reviewers agreed on. It also considered the sound of &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; a negative, but not something significant enough to draw players away from the game&#x27;s overall quality. IGN stated that cutscenes were somewhat bland, but that overall the graphics added &quot;an amazing amount of detail to the actual game&quot;. IGN&#x27;s main criticism was directed at the in-game speech used in campaigns; it rhetorically asked &quot;why can&#x27;t they just find a Frenchman to do a French accent?&quot; Alex Constantides of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; rated the graphics highly, saying that some in-game buildings are &quot;so grand you&#x27;ll even feel guilty about burning them to the ground&quot;. Werner agreed: &quot;the most noticeable graphical advancements&quot;, he wrote, were &quot;the sheer size and scale of things&quot;. Game Revolution stated &quot;&quot;AOE2&quot; is the best looking of the 2D RTS games out there right now&quot;.

&quot;The Age of Kings&quot; won GameSpot&#x27;s Strategy Game of the Year in 1999, and was a nominee for Game of the Year. GamePower also named it Strategy Game of the Year, while &quot;PC Gamer&quot; and &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; gave it Editor&#x27;s Choice awards. The editors of &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named it their 1999 &quot;Best Real-Time Strategy Game&quot;, and wrote that it &quot;takes everything we know about the real-time strategy genre and polishes it, and polishes it, and then polishes it some more.&quot; &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; won &quot;Computer Strategy Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Computer Game of the Year&quot;, and tied for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Character or Story Development&quot; (with &quot;&quot;) during the AIAS&#x27; 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards; it also received nominations for &quot;Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Animation&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Game Design&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Game Play Engineering&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked &quot;The Age of Kings&quot; the 53rd best game of all time in 2005, and the 10th best PC game of all time in 2007. &quot;GameFAQs&quot; users placed it 56th in a poll of the best games ever. A 2023 poll conducted by &quot;GQ&quot; which surveyed a team of video game journalists across the industry listed &quot;Age of Empires II&quot; the 98th best video game of all time.

&quot;The Age of Kings&quot; was highly influential on its genre. &quot;Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds&quot;, a 2001 game by LucasArts, shared &quot;The Age of Kings&quot;″ game engine, and was heavily influenced by its mechanics. &quot;Empire Earth&quot;″s design was also similar to that of &quot;The Age of Kings&quot;; GameSpot said it &quot;borrows most of that game&#x27;s controls, interface features, and even some of its keyboard shortcuts&quot;. Rick Goodman, designer of &quot;Age of Empires&quot; and &quot;The Rise of Rome&quot;, designed &quot;Empire Earth&quot;. GameSpot&#x27;s Scott Osborne argued that the gameplay of &quot;&quot; was heavily based on &quot;The Age of Kings&quot;.
==Expansions and sequels==
A PlayStation 2 port was released by Konami in 2001 for Europe and in 2002 for Japan. A Nintendo DS spinoff, &quot;Age of Empires: The Age of Kings&quot; was released in 2006.

An expansion for &quot;The Age of Kings&quot;, &quot;The Conquerors&quot;, was released in 2000. It introduced numerous new game features, including unique technologies for each civilization, and five new civilizations. Two of these, the Aztecs and the Mayans, represent the New World and have a distinctive architectural style. Other new civilizations are the Huns, Koreans, and Spanish.

In 2005, a mobile version of &quot;Age of Empires II&quot; was released for Java mobile devices (J2ME), called &quot;Age of Empires II Mobile&quot; and developed by In-Fusio. It featured much simplified gameplay and graphics, designed for the mobile devices of the time.

The success of &quot;Age of Empires II&quot; also spurred the continuation of the franchise: the third historical game in the series, &quot;Age of Empires III&quot;, was released in 2005. The game portrayed the European colonization of the Americas. Aside from one significant feature, the home city, the game&#x27;s design was largely similar to that of its predecessor.

The multiplayer-only &quot;Age of Empires Online&quot; was released in 2012. While the game was freely accessible, it featured premium content which could either be earned through gameplay or purchased, enabling the player to use higher-tier equipment and new game modes. Active development of the game ended on January 1, 2014, when executive producer Kevin Perry stated that adding new content was &quot;no longer cost effective,&quot; and announced that the game would be moving from &quot;development phase&quot; to its &quot;support phase&quot;. The game servers were subsequently shut down on July 1, 2014.

===&quot;HD Edition&quot;===
In 2012, Hidden Path Entertainment began working on a high-definition remake of &quot;Age of Empires II&quot;, an effort spearheaded by Matt Pritchard, an original lead programmer at Ensemble Studios. On March 7, 2013, its release was announced, branded as &quot;Age of Empires II: HD Edition&quot;. It has improved graphics, widescreen support and new multiplayer options through Steam. It was released on April 9, 2013, and there was a pre-order available on April 5. &quot;HD Edition&quot; received mixed reviews, with aggregate review website Metacritic assigning a score of 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics. Critics agreed that the &quot;HD Edition&quot; changed very little from the original game, though Steam Workshop integration was widely praised.

====&quot;The Forgotten&quot;====
Three official expansion packs were released for &quot;HD Edition&quot;. The first, &quot;The Forgotten&quot;, is based on a fan-made expansion, &quot;The Forgotten Empires&quot;. The pack introduces five new civilizations: the Incas, Indians, Italians, Magyars, and Slavs. It includes new maps, campaigns (Alaric I, Bari, Dracula, El Dorado, Francesco I Sforza, and Prithviraj), units, a new game mode, an increase of the maximum population limit from 200 to 500, and numerous balance and gameplay adjustments. The expansion pack was developed by the team that created the mod with the assistance of SkyBox Labs.

====&quot;The African Kingdoms&quot;====
A second expansion pack for &quot;Age of Empires II HD&quot;, &quot;The African Kingdoms&quot;, was released on November 5, 2015, and introduces four new civilizations: the Berbers, Ethiopians, Malians, and the Portuguese. It includes new maps, campaigns (Tariq ibn Ziyad, Yodit, Sundjata, and Francisco de Almeida), as well as new units, new game modes including Capture the Relic and Treaty, and numerous balance and gameplay adjustments.

====&quot;Rise of the Rajas&quot;====
The third expansion pack, &quot;Rise of the Rajas&quot;, was released on December 19, 2016. It is set in Southeast Asia, and adds four civilizations (Burmese, Khmer, Malay, and Vietnamese), each with its own fully voice-acted campaign (Bayinnaung, Suryavarman I, Gajah Mada, and Lê Lợi, respectively), as well as a new map type with environments, units such as the ballista elephant, improved AI, and more.

<text>The Conqueror is a 1956 American epic historical drama film, directed by Dick Powell and written by Oscar Millard. It stars John Wayne as the Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan and co-stars Susan Hayward, Agnes Moorehead and Pedro Armendáriz. Produced by entrepreneur Howard Hughes, the film was principally shot near St. George, Utah.

Despite the stature of the cast and a respectable box office performance, the film was critically panned; it is often ranked as one of the worst films of the 1950s and also as one of the worst films ever made. Wayne, who was at the height of his career, had lobbied for the lead role after reading the script and was widely believed to have been grossly miscast. &quot;The Conqueror&quot; was listed in the 1978 book &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time&quot;. In 1980, Wayne posthumously received a Golden Turkey Award (awarded to movies and performances considered the &quot;worst&quot; in history) in the &quot;Worst Casting&quot; category for his performance as Genghis. In the years since release, the film garnered additional controversy for its filming downwind of a nuclear testing site, which sparked debate among historians and biologists over whether or not it caused multiple cases of cancer among the cast and crew.

==Synopsis==

Mongol chief Temujin (later to be known as Genghis Khan) falls for Bortai, the daughter of the Tatars&#x27; leader, and steals her away, precipitating war. Bortai spurns Temujin, and is taken back in a raid. Temujin is later captured. Bortai falls in love with him, and helps him escape. Temujin suspects he was betrayed by a fellow Mongol, and sets out to find the traitor and overcome the Tatars.

==Cast==

* John Wayne as Temujin, later Genghis Khan
* Susan Hayward as Bortai
* Agnes Moorehead as Hunlun
* Pedro Armendáriz as Jamuga
* Thomas Gomez as Wang Khan
* John Hoyt as Shaman
* William Conrad as Kasar
* Ted de Corsia as Kumlek
* Leslie Bradley as Targutai
* Lee Van Cleef as Chepei
* Peter Mamakos as Bogurchi
* Leo Gordon as Tatar Captain
* Richard Loo as Captain of Wang&#x27;s guard
* Michael Wayne (&quot;uncredited&quot;) as Mongol guard 
* Patrick Wayne (&quot;uncredited&quot;)
The role of Genghis Khan was originally written for Marlon Brando, but Brando later backed out of the role.

==Production==
300 members of the Shivwits Band of Paiutes were cast as Tartar horsemen. The film had a troubled production; writer Oscar Millard stated that &quot;The company had just missed being wiped out by a flash flood, and Duke [John] Wayne had been drunk for three days. Not that it made much difference; except when a bender bloated him, it was hard to tell. His performance drunk or sober was the way other actors tend to perform if drunk.&quot; According to his son Norman, Dick Powell accepted directing duties for the money.

===Nuclear incident and cancer controversy===

Of the 220 crew members, 91 (comprising 41% of the crew) developed cancer during their lifetime, while 46 (or 21%) died from it. When this was learned, many suspected that filming in Utah and surrounding locations, near nuclear test sites, was to blame. However, tobacco use was very common and likely to have been a key factor in accounting for these cancer deaths. Although the number of cases among the cast and crew is in line with the average for adults in the US at the time, the perception of a link between the film&#x27;s location and subsequent illness remains, not least because many of those involved developed cancer at a younger age than average.

Some filming locations included parts of Utah, such as Snow Canyon, Pine Valley, Leeds, and Harrisburg. Exteriors were shot in the Escalante Desert near St. George, Utah, which is 137 miles (220 km) downwind of the United States government&#x27;s Nevada National Security Site and received the brunt of nuclear fallout from testing active in this period. In 1953, eleven above-ground nuclear weapons tests occurred at the site as part of Operation Upshot–Knothole. The cast and crew spent many difficult weeks at the site, and producer Howard Hughes later shipped 60 tons of dirt back to Hollywood in order to match the Utah terrain and lend realism to studio reshoots. The filmmakers knew about the nuclear tests, but the federal government had assured residents that the tests posed no hazard to the public health. Over 100 nuclear bombs were detonated in the area from 1951 to 1962.

In 1962, Powell developed lymphoma and died in January 1963. Armendáriz committed suicide in June 1963 after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. Hayward died of brain cancer in 1975. Wayne developed lung cancer in 1964, and eventually died from stomach cancer in 1979. Several of Wayne&#x27;s and Hayward&#x27;s relatives visiting the set also had cancer scares. Wayne&#x27;s son Michael developed skin cancer and Patrick had a benign tumor removed from his breast. Hayward&#x27;s son, Tim Barker, had a benign tumor removed from his mouth. Moorehead was a nonsmoker, teetotaler and health fanatic, yet died of cancer in April 1974. Her mother Mary maintained that it was working on &quot;The Conqueror&quot; which ultimately killed Agnes.

Hoyt died of lung cancer in 1991. Van Cleef died from a heart attack in 1989, but his secondary cause of death was listed as throat cancer. Some point to other factors such as the wide use of tobacco for the cancer deaths. Wayne&#x27;s heavy-smoking habit was blamed for his cancer by Wayne and his wife Pilar Pallete. In a 2001 interview with Larry King, Powell&#x27;s widow June Allyson stated that the cause of death was lung cancer due to his chain smoking. Hayward&#x27;s cancer began as a lung tumor identified in March 1972 that later metastasized.

Reportedly, Hughes felt guilty about his decisions regarding production, particularly over the decision to film at a hazardous site. He bought every print for $12 million and kept it out of circulation for many years until Universal Pictures purchased the film from his estate in 1979. &quot;The Conqueror&quot;, along with &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot;, is said to be one of the films Hughes watched endlessly during his last years.

Dr. Robert Pendleton, then a professor of biology at the University of Utah, is reported to have stated in 1980, &quot;With these numbers, this case could qualify as an epidemic. The connection between fallout radiation and cancer in individual cases has been practically impossible to prove conclusively. But in a group this size you&#x27;d expect only 30-some cancers to develop. With 91 cancer cases, I think the tie-in to their exposure on the set of &quot;The Conqueror&quot; would hold up in a court of law.&quot; Several cast and crew members, as well as relatives of those who died, considered suing the government for negligence, claiming it knew more about the hazards in the area than it let on.

Since the primary cast and crew numbered about 220, and a considerable number of cancer cases would be expected, controversy exists as to whether the actual results are attributable to radiation at the nearby nuclear weapons test site. Statistically, the odds of developing cancer for men in the U.S. population are 43% and the odds of dying of cancer are 23% – very near what was found in this film crew. This statistic does not include the Native American Paiute extras in the film.

==Release==

&quot;The Conqueror&quot; had premieres around the world in January 1956 in Caracas, Hong Kong, Manila, Mexico City, Paris, (23) São Paulo and Washington, D.C. (24). It had its UK premiere at the Odeon Marble Arch in London on February 2, 1956 where it grossed $11,000 in its first 6 days. Its premiere in Berlin led to a riot as young fans from East Berlin, which was part of East Germany but was not yet separated from West Berlin by the Berlin Wall, stormed past the DDR Border Troops to see John Wayne. The film had its Los Angeles premiere on February 22 and opened in many other US cities that week, including Chicago, Denver, Philadelphia and San Francisco and finished second at the US box office for the week, including a gross of $71,000 in LA and setting many opening day records.

The film was the eleventh-highest-grossing film at the box office in the United States and Canada during 1956, earning theatrical rentals of $4.5 million, but was a financial failure.

Universal purchased the rights to the film in 1979, and the studio released the film on DVD as part of its Vault Series on June 12, 2012.

Kino Lorber will release the film on Blu-ray on February 25, 2025.

==Reception==
The critical reception was negative:

* A. H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;an Oriental &#x27;Western&#x27;&quot; with a script that &quot;should get a few unintentional laughs.&quot; Weiler wrote that John Wayne gave an &quot;elementary&quot; portrayal of Genghis while &quot;constantly being unhorsed by such lines as, &#x27;you are beautiful in your wrath.&#x27;&quot;
* &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a fanciful, colorful tale suggestive of the vivid period with a derring-do dash that pays off&quot;, adding, &quot;The marquee value of the John Wayne-Susan Hayward teaming more than offsets any incongruity of the casting.&quot;
* Edwin Schallert of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film had &quot;a storming quality about it over-all. Which unfortunately make some of the love scenes seem all but laughable.&quot; He added, &quot;Powell deserves much credit for maneuvering the fierce and sensational battle scenes, which are a big highlight when Mongols and Tartars clash.&quot;
* &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote that general audiences &quot;should be more than satisfied&quot; by the &quot;thrilling battle scenes&quot; and &quot;strong romance&quot;, but the story &quot;does not come through the screen with any appreciable dramatic force, and the acting is no more than acceptable.&quot;
* John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;pure Hollywood moonshine ... You never saw so many horses fall down in your life. Still, even though their tumbling is far superior to the antics of the actors, it presently becomes tiresome.&quot;
* &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote that Wayne &quot;portrays the great conqueror as a sort of cross between a square-shootin&#x27; sheriff and a Mongolian idiot. The idea is good for a couple of snickers, but after that it never Waynes but it bores.&quot;
* &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called it &quot;a rambling and rather ordinary Western-type spectacle ... the weakly contrived narrative is singularly lacking in dramatic tension, and it is difficult to see this Temujin, for all his high-flown cries to heaven to support his destiny, as a potential world-beater or as even an amiable bandit. He is merely John Wayne struggling with an unfortunate piece of casting and with such embarrassingly silly lines as &#x27;I feel this Tartar woman is for me.&#x27;&quot;
* &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; predicted success for the film: &quot;should be a three bell ringer among the popcorn set...the film is aptly titled and after 111 minutes of gore and intrigue, Wayne sets himself up as Genghis Khan, with Susan Hayward beside him. Screen playwright Oscar Millard and producer-director Dick Powell have done competent work.&quot;

The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot; as one of the 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.

<text>The American Shorthair (ASH) is a breed of domestic cat believed to be descended from European cats brought to North America by early settlers to protect valuable cargo from mice and rats. According to the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association, it was the eighth most popular pedigreed cat in the world for 2020.

==History==
When settlers sailed from Europe to North America, they carried cats on board (ships&#x27; cats) to protect the stores from mice—for instance, the cats that came over on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; with the Pilgrims to hunt rats on the ship and in the colony. Many of these cats landed in the New World, interbred, and developed special characteristics to help them cope with their new life and climate. Early in the 20th century, a selective breeding program was established to develop the best qualities of these cats.

The American Shorthair is a pedigree cat breed, with a strict conformation standard, as set by cat fanciers of the breed and the North American cat fancier associations such as The International Cat Association (TICA) and the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA). The breed is accepted by all North American cat registries. Originally known as the Domestic Shorthair, the breed was renamed in 1966 to the &quot;American Shorthair&quot; to better represent its &quot;all-American&quot; origins and to differentiate it from other shorthaired breeds. The name &quot;American Shorthair&quot; also reinforces the fact that the breed is a pedigreed breed distinct from the random-bred non-pedigreed domestic short-haired cats in North America, which may nevertheless resemble the ASH. Both the American Shorthair breed and the random-bred cats from which the breed is derived are sometimes called working cats because they were used for controlling rodent populations, on ships and farms. The American shorthair (then referred as Domestic shorthair) was among the first five breeds that were considered as registered cat breeds by CFA during 1906.

== Description ==
===Appearance===
The American Shorthair is a medium to large sized cat breed with males weighing between 11-15 lbs (5–7 kg) and females weighing between 6-12 lbs (2.75-5.5 kg). The head is large, resembling an oblong with more length than width. The ears are medium sized and slightly rounded at the tips. The eyes are large and wide. The neck is medium in length and well-muscled. The legs are medium in length and muscular. Tail is of medium length.

====Coat color====
The American Shorthair is recognized in more than eighty different colors and patterns ranging from the brown-patched tabby to the blue-eyed white, the silvers (tabbies, shaded, smokes and cameos) to the calico van, and many colors in between. Some even come in deep tones of black, brown, or other blends and combinations. Generally, only cats showing evidence of crossbreeding resulting in the colors chocolate, sable, lilac (lavender), or the point-restricted pattern of the Siamese family are disqualified from being shown.

==Health==
A study conducted in Japan of cats suspected to have kidney problems found that 47% of tested American Shorthair cats had the PKD1 mutation, which is responsible for feline polycystic kidney disease (PKD). A review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis in the United States found that the American Shorthair had significantly lower odds of developing urate uroliths than mixed-breed cats.

<doc id="638472" wikidata="Q147764" url="?curid=638472" title="Pulsatilla">
<text>The genus Pulsatilla contains about 40 species of herbaceous perennial plants native to meadows and prairies of North America, Europe, and Asia. Common names include pasque flower (or pasqueflower), wind flower, prairie crocus, Easter flower, and meadow anemone. Several species are valued ornamentals because of their finely-dissected leaves, solitary bell-shaped flowers, and plumed seed heads. The showy part of the flower consists of sepals, not petals.

The common name &quot;pasque flower&quot; refers to its flowering period in the spring during Passover (in &quot;pāsaḥ&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Pulsatilla&quot; was first formally named in 1754 by the English botanist Philip Miller. The type species is &quot;Pulsatilla vulgaris&quot;, the European pasque flower. The genus is placed in the tribe Anemoneae within the family Ranunculaceae. The tribe has been shown repeatedly to be monophyletic in molecular phylogenetic studies, but the number of genera recognized within the tribe and their relationship has varied. Multiple studies have shown that &quot;Pulsatilla&quot; forms a monophyletic group, but the rank assigned to the group has differed. In one approach, &quot;Pulsatilla&quot; is treated as a section within a more broadly circumscribed &quot;Anemone&quot;. In another approach, molecular phylogenetic evidence is used to separate &quot;Pulsatilla&quot; from &quot;Anemone&quot; as a separate genus, dividing it into three subgenera. Morphologically, &quot;Pulsatilla&quot; can be distinguished from &quot;Anemone&quot; by the long hairy beak on the achenes formed by the persistent style and stamens. &quot;Pulsatilla&quot; species can also be distinguished by DNA barcoding. , many sources, such as Plants of the World Online and the &quot;Flora of Korea&quot;, support the treatment of &quot;Pulsatilla&quot; as a distinct genus.

===Species===

, Plants of the World Online listed the following species in the genus &quot;Pulsatilla&quot;:
Plants of the World Online also listed a number of named hybrids:
*&quot;Pulsatilla&quot; × &quot;bolzanensis&quot; 
*&quot;Pulsatilla&quot; × &quot;celakovskyana&quot; 
*&quot;Pulsatilla&quot; × &quot;emiliana&quot; 
*&quot;Pulsatilla&quot; × &quot;gayeri&quot; 
*&quot;Pulsatilla&quot; × &quot;girodii&quot; 
*&quot;Pulsatilla&quot; × &quot;hackelii&quot; 
*&quot;Pulsatilla&quot; × &quot;knappii&quot; 
*&quot;Pulsatilla&quot; × &quot;mixta&quot; 
*&quot;Pulsatilla&quot; × &quot;weberi&quot; 
*&quot;Pulsatilla&quot; × &quot;wilczekii&quot; 
*&quot;Pulsatilla&quot; × &quot;yanbianensis&quot; 

==Cultural significance==
&quot;Pulsatilla nuttalliana&quot; (as the synonym &quot;P. patens&quot;) is the provincial flower of Manitoba, Canada and (as the synonym &quot;P. hirsutissima&quot;) the state flower of the US state of South Dakota. &quot;Pulsatilla vulgaris&quot; is the County flower for both Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire in England. &quot;Pulsatilla vernalis&quot; is the county flower of Oppland, Norway. The UK has introduced the UK biodiversity action plan to address the 49% decline in wild &quot;Pulsatilla&quot; species.

==Use and toxicity==
&quot;Pulsatilla&quot; is a toxic plant. Misuse can lead to diarrhea, vomiting and convulsions, hypotension, and coma. It has been used as a medicine by Native Americans for centuries. Blackfoot Indians used it to induce abortions and childbirth. &quot;Pulsatilla&quot; should not be taken during pregnancy nor during lactation.

Extracts of &quot;Pulsatilla&quot; have been used to treat reproductive problems such as premenstrual syndrome and epididymitis. Additional applications of plant extracts include uses as a sedative and for treating coughs.

<doc id="638483" wikidata="Q5631645" url="?curid=638483" title="HMS Boxer (F121)">
<text>HMS &quot;Boxer&quot; was built as a Landing Ship, Tank [LST(1)] at Harland &amp; Wolff. Launched in December 1942 and commissioned the following April, she saw service as part of the Allied invasion of Italy.

==Design and development==
&quot;Boxer&quot; was the next in development of the tank landing ship following the conversion of the Maracaibo tankers into landing ships capable of carrying vehicles. The requirement was for a ship that could carry 13 Churchill tanks, 27 other vehicles and 193 men. As it was expected to have a high speed even when laden for the assault (about 18 knots) it could not have a shallow draught. This in turn meant that an extra long bow ramp had to be added. At this took up a lot of room inside the ship.

&quot;Boxer&quot; was laid down at Harland &amp; Wolff&#x27;s Belfast shipyard on 31 July 1941. She was launched on 12 December 1942 and was completed on 1 August 1943. &quot;Boxer&quot; had only two sister ships, as plans to build more in the United States led instead to the Landing Ship, Tank#LST Mk.2 a simpler though slower design capable of similar capacity but with a much shallower draught.

==Service==

In 1944, she was refitted as a fighter direction ship, for use during the Normandy landings to control fighter aircraft by ground-controlled interception, then as an &quot;action information organisation&quot; tender (a radar training ship) in 1946. In 1953 she took part in the fleet review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, was placed in reserve in 1956 and scrapped at Barrow-in-Furness in 1958.

&quot;Boxer&quot; carried the writer, musician and comedian Spike Milligan from North Africa to Italy, when he served with the 56th Heavy Regiment Royal Artillery.

<doc id="638492" wikidata="Q42566" url="?curid=638492" title="Bombay cat">
<text>The Bombay cat is a short-haired breed of domestic cat. Bombays are glossy solid black cats with a muscular build, and have characteristic large bright copper-golden eyes. The breed is named after the Indian city of Bombay (Mumbai), referring to the habitat of the Indian black leopard.

There exist two different variants of Bombay breed; the &quot;American Bombay&quot; and the &quot;British Bombay&quot;. American-type Bombays were developed by crossbreeding sable American Burmese and black American Shorthair cats, to produce a cat of mostly Burmese type, but with a sleek, panther-like black coat with copper-golden eyes. British-type Bombays are solid black-coloured Asian Self cats under the Asian group, a group of European Burmese and chinchilla Persian crosses. The British-type Bombay originated from three mismatings of European Burmese with black domestic short-haired cats. 

Both types of Bombay cats are selectively bred by breeders and pedigreed in multiple major cat fancier and breeder organisations. Similar to other officially recognised cat breeds, the term &quot;Bombay&quot; is only meant to be used for cats from this specific breed, which are by definition all purebred cats with a known and formally registered ancestry, also known as the cat&#x27;s pedigree or &quot;paperwork&quot;.

== Breed registration ==

=== History ===
The breed was developed by Nikki Horner, a breeder from Louisville, Kentucky, who, starting in 1958, attempted to create a breed of cat that resembled a miniature black panther. The first attempt was a failure, but the second, in 1965, was successful. The breed was officially recognised and registered by the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA) in 1970 and The International Cat Association (TICA) in 1979.

=== Popularity ===
The Bombay cat is a relatively rare breed among pedigree cats, both in the American and British types. The British type are pedigreed as Asian Self cats under the Asian group. In 2023, only 160 kittens of the total Asian group were pedigreed with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). 

The American type is relatively more popular compared to the British type. In France, an average of 45 Bombay kittens were born yearly between 2003 and 2022. PawPeds is the largest cat pedigree database worldwide. As of June 2024, there were a total of 1,717 (including deceased cats) Bombay cats registered with PawPeds, and 406 of them were born after January 2000. 

== Appearance ==

The Bombay is described as the &quot;patent leather kid with the new penny eyes.&quot; The Bombay is a short-haired breed of domestic cat, closely related to the Burmese. Bombay cats are characterised as having an all-black coat, including the whiskers, and black skin, including the soles, nose leather and mouth. The close-lying, sleek and glossy black coat is of mature cats is coloured to the roots with no paling (exceptions are allowed in juvenile cats less than 2 years old). The eyes are always copper-golden coloured, and green eyes are not allowed.The Bombay has a medium-sized, Oriental-type body build that is muscular. Their weight ranges between , with males typically being heavier than females.

== Breed standard ==
Body: Medium size, graceful and elongated Oriental-type body. Elegant tail of medium length.
Head: Rounded heads with no sharp angles, and short. The shape is smooth. The muzzle is short, with a moderate nose “stop” which is visible (not a break). The short-nosed head shape is similar to the American-type Burmese. The medium-sized ears are wide-set, straight, and rounded at the tips.

Eyes: The large, round eyes are set far apart and are always copper-coloured, but can range from bright orange to warm golden. Green eyes are not allowed.

Coat: Short, dense and shiny, tight to the body, with a lacquered sheen. Only completely solid black coloured coats are allowed.

Weight: For females, the average is . For males, the average is .

== Health ==
A healthy Bombay has an average lifespan of 15 years, and some have been known to live up to 20. They can have some nasal and sinus problems, and gingivitis. Their food intake should be controlled to avoid overfeeding.

== Temperament ==

The personality of the Bombay tends to be highly social, is marked by strong attachment to families, and is typified by craving attention. As a breed, these characteristics make them highly suitable for children.

Bombay cats are happy and comfortable being strictly indoor cats, and can comfortably live in a single room apartment, so long as all of their needs are met. They prefer quiet surroundings.

<doc id="638501" wikidata="Q3844925" url="?curid=638501" title="Frederick Handley Page">
<text>Sir Frederick Handley Page (15 November 1885 – 21 April 1962) was an English industrialist who was a pioneer in the aircraft industry and became known as the father of the heavy bomber.

His company Handley Page Limited was best known for its large aircraft such as the Handley Page 0/400 and Halifax bombers and the H.P.42 airliner. The latter was the flagship of the Imperial Airways fleet between the wars and remarkable at the time for having been involved in no passenger deaths.

He is also known for his invention, with Gustav Lachmann, of the leading edge slot to improve the stall characteristics of aircraft wings. Frederick Handley Page was the uncle of World War II flying ace Geoffrey Page.

==Early life==
Handley Page was born in Cheltenham, the second son of Frederick Joseph Page, a furniture maker and member of the Plymouth Brethren. He was educated at Cheltenham Grammar School. In 1902, against his parents&#x27; wishes, he moved to London to study electrical engineering at Finsbury Technical College.

==Career==
On qualifying in 1906 he was appointed head designer at Johnson &amp; Phillips Ltd, an electrical engineering company based in Charlton in south east London. In 1907 he joined the Royal Aeronautical Society where he met the artist and aviation pioneer José Weiss. Weiss was performing experiments with gliders using an inherently stable wing design based on the seed-pods of the &quot;Zanonia macrocarpa&quot; which he was to patent in 1908. Unfortunately Handley Page, in his enthusiasm for aviation, started experimental work at Johnson and Phillips without authorisation: this was interpreted by the board as attempted fraud, and he was dismissed, leaving in charge his assistant, A.R. Low, who would later become an aircraft designer for Vickers.

He immediately set up his own business, with an office in Woolwich, and accepted a commission to build an aircraft for G.P. Deverall-Saul. After some searching for a suitable flying ground he leased a small stretch of marshland and a shed at Creekmouth in Essex. Here he constructed his first aircraft, a canard configuration glider with a tricycle undercarriage and wing of the Weiss pattern. Handley Page had entered into an agreement whereby he could use Weiss&#x27;s patents in exchange for making an improved wing for his next glider, and it was agreed to take a stand at the Aero Exhibition to be held at Olympia in 1909. In June 1909 he established his business as a limited company, with an authorised capital of £10,000.

Neither the glider nor the aircraft built for Saul-Deverell, which was powered only by a engine, was successful but Saul-Deverell ordered a second machine and two other commissions were received. Handley Page also set about designing and building his first powered aircraft, the Bluebird (so-called because of the blue-grey rubberised fabric with which it was covered), intended for the 1910 Aero exhibition. As well as complete aircraft, the company also supplied metal fixings for aircraft and aircraft propellers, two of which were used by one of the Willows airships. After it was exhibited at Olympia, Handley Page set about attempting to learn to fly using the &quot;Bluebird&quot;. A brief straight flight was first achieved on 26 May 1910, but after a few more similar efforts Handley Page&#x27;s first attempt at a turn ended in a crash. It was rebuilt with a slightly more powerful engine and the addition of wing-warping for lateral control, but it proved no more successful and was abandoned and work begun on a new, larger, monoplane.

At this time he was also active in the reform of the Royal Aeronautical Society and gained additional income from journalism and lecturing, giving classes at Finsbury on electrical engineering and in 1911 obtaining a post as a lecturer in aeronautics at the Northampton Polytechnic Institute in Clerkenwell, London. Here he had a wind-tunnel built, and he also sold the &quot;Bluebird&quot; to the Institute for use as an instructional airframe.

==First World War==
Shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 Handley Page was invited by Murray Sueter to the Admiralty to discuss Naval air requirements. The result was a specification for a large twin-engined aircraft, capable of carrying of bombs and larger than anything that had been flown at the time. The eventual result was the Handley Page 0/100, first flown in December 1915 and the start of the Handley Page company&#x27;s reputation for building large aircraft. During the war it was further developed into the 0/400 and 0/1500 bombers.

==Development of leading-edge slots==
In 1917 Handley Page and his aerodynamicist R.O. Bothwell started wind-tunnel experiments intended to combine the low drag of high aspect ratio wings with the delayed stall at high angles of attack of a low aspect ratio wing. The first attempts involved using a wing divided into separate square panels by slots running chordwise, but this produced no significant result. The idea of a wing divided into two sections by a narrow spanwise slot was then tried, and the first experiment, using a slot at 25% chord in a RAF 15 section wing gave an increase in lift of 25%. The shape and position of the slots was found to be critical, and a series of wind-tunnel test were made during 1918–19 under conditions of great secrecy, since Handley Page realised the commercial value of the idea and consequently wanted it kept secret until it could be patented. He delayed doing this until he was able to file a patent for a controllable device in which the slot could be opened and closed by the pilot. This was granted on 24 October 1919. The principle had been independently arrived at by Gustav Lachmann, a German pilot and engineer: Lachmann attempted to patent the idea a few weeks before Handley Page, but his patent application was initially refused. When his patent was retroactively granted, he contacted Handley Page but rather than getting involved in a legal dispute the two men arrived at a mutually satisfactory arrangement, with the patents being shared and Lachmann accepting a post as a consultant for Handley Page. He was later to become the company&#x27;s head of design and later director of research.

==Post-war==
The period immediately after World War I was a difficult one for the aviation industry, Handley Page Ltd being no exception. Companies had expanded hugely during the conflict: Handley Page had only 12 permanent staff at the outbreak of the war; by 1918 this had grown to over 5,000
Early in 1919 he converted HP into a public limited company. On 14 June 1919 he set up a subsidiary company, Handley Page Transport
Services had already begun, with converted 0/400s being used to ferry newspapers on 1 May 1919, the first day on which civil aviation was permitted under the new Air Navigation rules.

The enormous number of now-unwanted military aircraft, aero-engines and assorted spares was initially handled by a government body, the Aircraft Disposal Board, but a political scandal over misadministration led to a government decision to sell the material. Handley Page&#x27;s bid was successful, and for £1M plus 50% of any profits the entire stock of more than 10,000 airframes, 30,000 engines and sundry spares (such as 1,000 tons of ball-bearings), was acquired by a newly formed company, the Aircraft Disposal Company. It in turn appointed Handley Page Ltd as its sole agent.

The involvement with the Aircraft Disposal Company proved nearly disastrous for Handley Page: by April 1919 the value of £1 ordinary shares in Handley Page Ltd had dropped to one shilling, and he was accused of having used £400,000 of the ADC&#x27;s money to subsidise his various failed civil aviation projects. The same amount of money was owed to the Royal Bank of Scotland. The situation was saved by the RBS, which arranged for Handley Page to remain as managing director of Handley Page Ltd on condition that two seats on the board of directors were held by their nominees and two more by representatives of the ADC. This deal cost Handley Page £179,000 in royalties due to him from Handley Page Ltd but assured the survival of the company and Handley Page&#x27;s control over it.

He was knighted in 1942 for his contribution to the war effort.

In 1946 along with Sir Roy Fedden he played a major role the establishment of the College of Aeronautics at Cranfield, and was chairman of its governing body until his death.

Page was awarded the Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring from the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics) for &quot;outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering&quot; in 1960.

He died on 21 April 1962 in Grosvenor Square, Westminster, London at age 76. The house in Grosvenor Square where Handley Page lived, No. 18, now bears a blue plaque.

In 1987, Handley-Page was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum. A road named Sir Frederick Page Way has been created in BAE Systems&#x27; Enterprise Zone at the site of the old Samlesbury Aerodrome.

==Personal life==
He married Una Thynne (1890–1957) in 1918. They had three daughters. His nephew was Geoffrey Page, a World War 2 fighter ace.

His positions included:
*President of the Society of British Aircraft Constructors (SBAC) (1938–39 – he also served as honorary Treasurer and chairman);
*President of the Royal Aeronautical Society (RAeS) (1945–47 – and longstanding member of its Council);
*Vice-Chairman of the Air Registration Board (for 20 years);
*President of the Institute of Transport (1945–46); and
*chairman of the board of Governors of the College of Aeronautics, Cranfield.
*Master of the Worshipful Company of Coachmakers and Coach Harness Makers (1943–44)
*Deputy lieutenant (1954–56) and later lieutenant (1956–60) of the county of Middlesex
*Chairman of Council of the City and Guilds of London Institute (1949–61)

<text>Paul Grist (born 9 September 1960) is a British comic book creator, noted for his hard-boiled police series &quot;Kane&quot; and his unorthodox superhero series &quot;Jack Staff&quot;.

==Biography==
Grist was born in Sheffield. His first work was published in the 1980s by DC Thomson and Fleetway. His early work also includes &quot;St. Swithin&#x27;s Day&quot; (written by Grant Morrison and published by Trident Comics), &quot;Grendel: Devil in Our Midst&quot; (written by Steven T. Seagle and published by Dark Horse Comics), and a Judge Dredd adventure, &quot;Kinky Boots&quot;, authored by Robbie Morrison.

He later founded his own publishing company, Dancing Elephant Press, under which &quot;Kane&quot; and &quot;Jack Staff&quot; were first published, but both titles later moved to Image Comics. He also published &quot;Burglar Bill&quot; under the Dancing Elephant umbrella (May–Nov. 2003, though it had partly appeared in an earlier form published by Trident Comics).

Grist&#x27;s art is notable for its spare — sometimes stiff — style, heavy use of shadow, and inventive layouts. His writing is marked by a penchant for sudden cuts between events occurring in different time periods, without the gradual transitions common to the comic book medium. Following the structure of Grist&#x27;s stories can be a challenge, but he provides subtle visual clues to aid the alert reader.

<text>The Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) is an executive department of the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China that is responsible for formulating policy on foreign trade, export and import regulations, foreign direct investments, consumer protection, market competition (competition regulator) and negotiating bilateral and multilateral trade agreements. it is the 20th-ranking department of the State Council. The current minister is Wang Wentao.

== History ==
In November 1949, a month after the People&#x27;s Republic of China was established, the Chinese Communist Party formed the Ministry of Trade (贸易部) while the MOEA continued to operate in Taiwan and several other islands.

In August 1952, the Ministry was renamed to Ministry of Foreign Trade (对外贸易部). Ye Jizhuang was the first Minister and died in the post in 1967.

In March 1982, the Ministry of Foreign Trade was merged with the Ministry of Foreign Economic Liaison (对外经济联络部), the State Import and Export Regulation Commission (国家进出口管理委员会), and the State Foreign Investment Regulation Commission (国家外国投资管理委员会), and became the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade (对外经济贸易部).

In March 1993, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade was renamed to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (对外贸易经济合作部).

In the spring of 2003, the former Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation went through a reorganization and was renamed Ministry of Commerce. During 2003, the Ministry established Forum Macao in the Macao Special Administrative Region as a multi-lateral mechanism for cooperation between China and the Portuguese-speaking countries.

In 2006, the Ministry of Commerce oversaw the program of &quot;ten thousand businesses advance westward&quot; in conjunction with the Hu-Wen administration&#x27;s early emphasis on balancing regional development.

The ministry also incorporates the former State Economic and Trade Commission and the State Development Planning Commission.



Since 2015, the ministry has implemented &quot;overseas talent offshore innovation and entrepreneurship bases&quot; in partnership with institutions abroad for technology transfer purposes.

In 2018, the ministry lost powers and responsibilities regarding anti-monopoly, intellectual property, counterfeit goods, foreign aid, and some financial products to other departments.

Coordinating foreign aid became the responsibility of the newly created China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA). MOFCOM had tended to emphasize the use of aid to support foreign trade objectives, whereas CIDCA has increasingly emphasized the use of aid to support foreign policy objectives. MOFCOM continues to have a role in foreign aid through implementing overseas projects and selecting the firms to undertake them.

== Functions ==
MOFCOM is in charge of the administration of foreign trade and is China&#x27;s primary foreign trade negotiator. MOFCOM also deals with foreign investment regulation. It works with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to draft negative lists for foreign investments at the national level and for special economic zones. MOFCOM certifies Chines firms&#x27; international contracting business; Chinese contractors performing work abroad must obtain letters from the MOFCOM Economic and Commercial Office at the Chinese embassy in the host country.

MOFCOM additionally is responsible for developing strategic national plans in the areas of finance and taxation, drafts the central financing budget, supervises central financial expenditures, and audits the budget and accounts of state capital and the national social insurance fund.

MOFCOM is China&#x27;s most important negotiator in the global governance of intellectual property.

MOFCOM additionally has responsibilities on economic relations with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. To that end the Vice Minister An Min, and the previous Financial Secretary of Hong Kong, Antony Leung, concluded the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). New agreements are continually negotiated between An and the current Financial Secretary John Tsang under the auspices of the CEPA. Similar agreements were also concluded between the MOFCOM and Secretariat for Economy and Finance of Macau.

In the first decade after the institution of China&#x27;s Anti-Monopoly Law (2008–2018), MOFCOM was responsible for regulation of mergers under the law. Other antitrust investigations were handled by the State Administration of Industry and Commerce and the NDRC. During that period, MOFCOM prohibited two mergers and imposed remedies in 36 transactions, all of which involved foreign multinational corporations. The State Administration for Market Regulation was created and became China&#x27;s primary antitrust regulator in 2018.

MOFCOM assists in drafting laws and regulations in its relevant policy areas.

== List of ministers ==
A ministerial-level MOFCOM vice minister serves as the International Trade Representative, representing China at bilateral and multilateral trade agreements.

<doc id="638510" wikidata="Q6361749" url="?curid=638510" title="Kane (comics)">
<text>Kane is a comic book series created, written and drawn by Paul Grist and self-published through Dancing Elephant Press. Grist put out 31 issues of &quot;Kane&quot; from 1993 to 2001.

== Overview ==
&quot;Kane&quot; concerns a police detective who works in the 39th precinct of the fictional American city of New Eden, which seems to be located on the West Coast. Despite being a UK citizen, Grist appears to have modeled New Eden and its police force in the style of American cop shows such as &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; and &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;. Another clear influence is the work of Frank Miller, particularly his &quot;Sin City&quot; comics. &quot;Cerebus&quot; was another formative influence, particularly because it proved to Grist that self-published comics were a viable proposition; the first issue of &quot;Cerebus&quot; that Grist read was #39, hence the designation of Kane&#x27;s precinct.

Kane has a difficult relationship with his co-workers due to a violent encounter with his former partner, which unfolds gradually and in flashback during the series. Police corruption is a recurring theme. &quot;Kane&quot; is also densely intertextual and brims with references to popular culture, particularly characters from British television, comics, and films.

Since the end of 2001 Grist has concentrated on his superhero character Jack Staff, although he has announced plans to continue Kane as a series of original graphic novels.

== Reception ==
&quot;Kane&quot; won the 1998 National Comics Award for Best Self-Published/Independent comic.
==Collections==
Kane has been collected in the following trade paperbacks from Image Comics:

<text>Robert Waring Darwin (30 May 1766 – 13 November 1848) was an English medical doctor who is today best known as the father of naturalist Charles Darwin. He was a member of the influential Darwin–Wedgwood family.

==Biography==
Darwin was born in Lichfield, the son of physician Erasmus Darwin and his first wife, Mary Howard. He was named after his uncle, Robert Waring Darwin of Elston (1724–1816), a bachelor. His mother died in 1770 and Mary Parker, the governess hired to look after him, became his father&#x27;s mistress and bore Erasmus two illegitimate daughters.

In 1783, Darwin began his studies of medicine at the University of Edinburgh, where he apparently took lodgings with the chemistry professor Joseph Black. His father then sent him to the Leiden University in the Netherlands for a few months, and he took his MD there on 26 February 1785. His Leyden dissertation was impressive and was published in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, but his father may have assisted him in this. In Edinburgh Robert Darwin had studied under several leading scholars, including John Walker. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 21 February 1788.

===Career===
In 1787, when he was still under 21 years old, Darwin set up practice in Shrewsbury, the county town of Shropshire. The family story was that he was brought there by his father who gave him £20, saying, &quot;Let me know when you want more, and I will send it you&quot;, then sent another £20 by his uncle, and that was all he needed. A tall and then slim young man, he gained attention when the wife of a bookseller in Wellington, who was being treated for illness by a doctor from the county hospital, fell dangerously ill while that doctor was away for several days on business. Darwin was called in, and as the apothecary would give no information, had to decide on treatment himself. She died, and there was a controversy about which doctor was to blame. Darwin hastily published a pamphlet showing that the other doctor had been treating her for a disease which she did not have, and while his reputation was gained, the other doctor moved elsewhere. After only six months, Darwin &quot;already had between forty and fifty patients&quot;, and within two years had a large practice. For two or three years he lived on St. John&#x27;s Hill, then moved to The Crescent. For years afterwards Darwin, regretting the hasty way the pamphlet had been written, bought up all copies and burnt them.

With small inheritances from his mother and an aunt, Darwin invested in housing, buying the freehold of several buildings in Shrewsbury and getting income from rents. He became a major stockholder in the Trent and Mersey Canal, and an investor in the London to Holyhead road built by Thomas Telford as another part of the infrastructure of the Industrial Revolution.
Erasmus Darwin reached an understanding with his close friend Josiah Wedgwood that his son Robert would marry Wedgwood&#x27;s favourite daughter, Susannah, when able to support her. Josiah died in January 1795, leaving £25,000 to Susannah. By then Robert Darwin was well established, and they married on 18 April 1796. Their first child, Marianne, was born at The Crescent. Robert Darwin purchased land overlooking the River Severn and had a large red-brick house built there around 1800 which was named The Mount, where all their other children were born. He took great pleasure in the large garden, and had it planted out with ornamental trees and shrubs as well as having particular success in growing fruit-trees.

A large man of 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m), he reportedly stopped weighing himself when he weighed 24 stone (336 lb, 153 kg). He required his coachman to test the floorboards of houses he was visiting, and had to have special stone steps made for him to enter his carriage.

He held his experience in Edinburgh in such high regard that he sent his son Charles to study there. He at first refused to let his son join the survey voyage of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;, but was persuaded otherwise.

==Scientific contributions==
Robert Darwin provided the first empirical evidence that small eye movements are made even when people attempt to keep them fixed. This he found during his studies of the afterimages of colored stimuli in which he noticed that while a person tried to fixate a colored circle, a lucid edge appeared on the adjacent white-paper background. He concluded &quot;as by the unsteadiness of the eye a part of the fatigued retina falls on the white paper&quot;.

==Family==
On 18 April 1796 he married Susannah Wedgwood, daughter of the pottery manufacturer Josiah Wedgwood, at St Marylebone, Middlesex (now part of London), and they had six children:
* Marianne Darwin (1798–1858), married Henry Parker (1788–1858) in 1824.
* Caroline Sarah Darwin (1800–1888) married her cousin Josiah Wedgwood III
* Susan Elizabeth Darwin (1803–1866), unmarried.
* Erasmus Alvey Darwin (1804–1881)
* Charles Robert Darwin (1809–1882)
* Emily Catherine Darwin (1810–1866), married 1863, Charles Langton clergyman and widower of her cousin Charlotte Wedgwood.

He, his wife, and their daughter Susan are buried in St Chad&#x27;s Church, Montford, near Shrewsbury.

<text>BBC Online, formerly known as BBCi, is the BBC&#x27;s online service. It is a large network of websites including such high-profile sites as BBC News and Sport, the on-demand video and radio services branded BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds, the children&#x27;s sites CBBC and CBeebies, and learning services such as Bitesize and Own It. The BBC has had an online presence supporting its TV and radio programmes and web-only initiatives since April 1994, but did not launch officially until 28 April 1997, following government approval to fund it by TV licence fee revenue as a service in its own right. Throughout its history, the online plans of the BBC have been subject to competition and complaint from its commercial rivals, which has resulted in various public consultations and government reviews to investigate their claims that its large presence and public funding distorts the UK market.

The website has gone through several branding changes since it was launched. Originally named BBC Online, it was rebranded as BBCi (which itself was the brand name for interactive TV services) before being named &quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;. It was then renamed BBC Online again in 2008, although the service uses the branding &quot;BBC&quot;.

On 26 February 2010 &quot;The Times&quot; claimed that Mark Thompson, then Director General of the BBC, proposed that the BBC&#x27;s web output should be cut by 50%, with online staff numbers and budgets reduced by 25% in a bid to scale back BBC operations and allow commercial rivals more room. On 2 March 2010, the BBC reported that it would cut its website spending by 25% and close BBC 6 Music and Asian Network. On 24 January 2011, the confirmed cuts of 25% were announced, leaving a £34 million shortfall. This resulted in the closure of several sites, including BBC Switch, BBC Blast, 6-0-6, and the announcement of plans to sell the Douglas Adams created site h2g2.

==History==

=== Early years ===
www.bbc.co.uk was introduced in April 1994 with some regional information and Open University Production Centre (OUPC) content. By September, the first commercial service launched, a transcription service via FTP server. At its peak, it had 122 accounts, including FBI bureaus around the world, taking daily updates from 12 feeds.

Within 12 months, the BBC website offered &quot;Auntie&quot; online discussion groups; web pages for select web-related programs and BBC departments; free web pages for associate members.

The BBC Multimedia Centre was a team led by Martin Freeth to introduce new media across the corporation.

===BBC Networking Club===

BBC Networking Club www.bbcnc.org.uk (the &quot;nc&quot; standing for &quot;networking club&quot;) was launched by BBC Education on 11 May 1994 as a non-profit paid subscription service. For a joining fee of £25 and a monthly subscription of £12, members of the club were given access to an early type of social networking site featuring a bulletin board for sharing information and real-time conversation, along with a dialup Internet connection service.

===BBC Online and beeb.com===

The BBC Director General John Birt sought government approval to direct licence fee revenue into the service, describing planned BBC Internet services as the &quot;third medium&quot; joining the BBC&#x27;s existing TV and radio networks, achieving a change in the BBC Charter. This led to the official launch of &quot;BBC Online&quot; at the &quot;www.bbc.co.uk&quot; address in April 1997.

As well as the licence fee funded www.bbc.co.uk, BBC Worldwide launched the commercially funded beeb.com, featuring mostly entertainment focused content, with sites including &quot;Radio Times&quot;, &quot;Top Gear&quot; and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The development of these services formed the basis of a three-year agreement between BBC Worldwide and International Computers Limited, intended to assist the former in exploiting commercial opportunities in the &quot;new medium&quot; of the consumer Internet, while permitting the latter to gain commercial and technical experience and to position itself as a supplier to the media industry. Later, BBC Online launched licence-fee funded web sites for &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;Top Gear&quot;, resulting in some duplication.

Beeb.com was later refocussed as an online shopping guide, and was closed in 2002. beeb.com later redirected to the BBC Shop website, run by BBC Worldwide.

In 1999, the BBC bought the bbc.com domain name, previously owned by Boston Business Computing, for $375,000, but the price of this purchase was not revealed until six years later. , &quot;www.bbcnc.org.uk&quot; no longer exists.

===BBCi===

In 2001, BBC Online was rebranded as BBCi; the website launched on 7 November 2001. The BBCi name was conceived as an umbrella brand for all the BBC&#x27;s digital interactive services across web, digital teletext, interactive TV and on mobile platforms. The use of letter &quot;i&quot; prefixes and suffixes to denote information technology or interactivity was very much in vogue at this time; according to the BBC, the &quot;i&quot; in BBCi stood for &quot;interactivity&quot; as well as &quot;innovation&quot;.

As part of the rebrand, BBC website pages all displayed a standard navigation bar across the top of the screen, offering category-based navigation: Categories, TV, Radio, Communicate, Where I Live, A-Z Index and a search function. The navbar was designed to offer a similar navigation system to the i-bar on BBCi interactive television.

===bbc.co.uk and the return of BBC Online===
After three years of consistent use across different platforms, the BBC began to drop the BBCi brand gradually; on 6 May 2004, the BBC website was renamed bbc.co.uk, after the main URL used to access the site. Interactive TV services continued under the BBCi brand until it was dropped completely in 2008. The BBC&#x27;s online video player, the iPlayer has, however, retained an i-prefix in its branding.

On 14 December 2007, a beta version of a new bbc.co.uk homepage was launched, with the ability to customise the page by adding, removing and rearranging different categories, such as &#x27;News&#x27;, &#x27;Weather&#x27; and &#x27;Entertainment&#x27;. The widget-based design was inspired by sites such as Facebook and iGoogle, and allowed the BBC to add new content to the homepage while still retaining users&#x27; customisations. The new homepage also incorporated the clock design used in the 1970s on the BBC&#x27;s television service into the large header and a box containing featured content of the website. The new BBC homepage left beta on Wednesday, 27 February 2008 to serve as the new BBC Homepage under the same URL as the previous version.

On 30 January 2010, a new webpage design became available as a beta version, that by May 2010, replaced the old homepage. This homepage expanded on the modules idea and the customisation theme. The website allowed certain themes that interested the viewer to be tracked, via a new module. It also included a new &#x27;Media Zone&#x27; where featured content could be displayed, with this new featured box being located across the entire top of the webpage, below the header. The Media Zone was also changed so that the content changed by running the mouse over the tabs. The header was again changed to include the headings of the major sections of the website, these being: Home, News, Sport, Weather, iPlayer, TV, Radio and more, spread out evenly across the header. This new header was included across the entire website. Despite the cosmetic appearance of the relaunch, the new website was actually relaunched using a completely different operating system, allowing the site&#x27;s four different international versions to be more easily altered. It also brought their website layouts and operations closer to that of the main website.

Following the launch of the new BBC News website, which altered the header bar on that site, in October 2010, the new style of header was launched across the whole website, starting off with some of the larger, yet not obvious, sites, such as Doctor Who, first before relaunching all of the sites, including the homepage with the new look. This new style of header included the headings as before, but with the search box redesigned and aligned right, as with the links which are significantly smaller. Other links, such as BBC id login and mobile versions of the website also appear on the header, just to the right of the smaller BBC logo.
On 21 September 2011, a new BBC homepage went into beta testing that was drastically different from those before it. The new homepage was based on feedback that stated that the current page was too narrow in focus and not distinctive enough, with the homepage not displaying the full extend of the BBC Online site and that some did not realise it was the homepage. As a result, they launched a new version that featured as a centrepiece a revolving carousel of content on the BBC Online website, with filters beneath to restrict it to, and to show more of entertainment, lifestyle, knowledge and news and sports topics. At the top of the page, a new header has been inserted giving the date, the time through the use of the vintage BBC clock, as well as weather prospects for the next three days through the use of the traditional weather symbols. Below the carousel, boxes contain links to the most popular video material, web articles and pages on the site, as well as TV and Radio listings alongside an A-Z list of the BBC&#x27;s top level domains. This new site replaced the previous one on 30 November 2011. In a blog post from the same day, James Thornett explained the changes – while the post attracted complaints from users disliking the refreshed layout, the new-look site was critically acclaimed and nominated by the Design Museum as one of their Designs of the Year in 2012. It also won a Peabody Award in 2011 because it &quot;continued, expanded and enhanced one of the greatest traditions in electronic media.&quot;
==Content==
BBC Online contains a variety of content ranging from News, Sport, Music, Science, Technology and Entertainment, amongst other things. The website has a British orientation, although the home page, news section and sports section each provide different content between UK and &quot;International&quot; visitors. There are also separate pages for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland written by the BBC Nations.

The website focuses around the primary top level domains of News, Sport, Weather, iPlayer, TV and Radio. These are easily accessible from the taskbar running across the top of all current BBC Online pages. However, other top level domains are also in existence: some are available from a drop down list on the taskbar including CBBC, CBeebies, Comedy, Food, Health, History, Learning, Music, Science and Nature, while other top level domains are only available through the A-Z index on the BBC website. These include Archives, Arts &amp; Culture, Ethics, Gardening, Parenting, Religion and Travel news. However, there are many more top level domains – some 400 in March 2010 however this number has decreased as top level domains now frequently link to a lower domain name – that link to websites for individual services or programmes.

===News, Sport and Weather===

One of the most used aspects of the BBC Online website are the sections relating to News content, Sports results and news and Weather forecasts. The BBC News Online subsite launched in 1997 and received around 2 billion page views each month in 2012. The site contains journalistic content from the BBC covering news from the UK, both as a whole as well as regional news from the BBC Nations and Regions, and International content. The site also contains analysis from correspondents and other features from the Magazine section of the website. The BBC Sport Online subsite offers, in a similar way to news, a wide variety of material including sports results, live feeds to on-air programming, sports related news and analysis from commentators and pundits. The BBC Weather subsite primarily focuses on weather forecasts for UK and International locations, but also includes other features including Country guides that detail to geography and climate of each country, winter sports forecasts and during times of unusual or extreme weather, videos are produced explaining the causes for this weather.

===iPlayer and Programmes sites===

The BBC iPlayer subsite allows programmes to be viewed again after broadcast over the Internet. This successful site has now been expanded to include mobile views and downloads onto computers and mobiles allowing viewing for up to 30 days after broadcast.

BBC Programmes is a service of BBC Online which provides a page for every television and radio programme broadcast by the BBC in the United Kingdom. It was launched in October 2007 and gives each programme an eight or eleven digit identifier which is used to provide a permanent URL. It currently only holds data from the launch date plus a selection of high-profile programmes (notably Natural History programmes and Radio 4 programmes), but Jana Bennett, Director of BBC Vision, said in June 2008 that the BBC will eventually add a page for each programme it has broadcast over its history to the service.

BBC Programmes is available as HTML and RDF/XML and JSON.

The BBC Programme Catalogue is an internal archive of the BBC back catalogue which was briefly available online to the public in beta.

===Sounds===

BBC Sounds is an internet streaming, catchup, radio and Podcast service from the BBC. The service is available on a wide range of devices, including mobile phones and tablets, personal computers, and smart televisions. It was launched in November 2018 and replaces the &#x27;iPlayer Radio&#x27; branded service, and the mobile apps currently complement the existing iPlayer Radio native applications, which remain available.

===Knowledge and learning===
The BBC also operates numerous sub sites that focus on different topics and subjects to expand the knowledge of the reader. These are mainly centred around the topics of Science, Nature, Arts and Culture, Religion and Ethics, Food and History. Each of these sub sites feature new articles published on the topic and contain other collections relating to the topic.

For example, the Food site contains recipes featured on various BBC cookery programmes, the History site has an interactive timeline of key events and individuals, the Nature site contains a database of creatures, and the Language site teaches phrases and more in 40 languages. Included in this range was the well received Your Paintings website that catalogued every painting in public ownership for view.

Until 2013, the BBC also hosted a health website with detailed information, checked by professionals, of medical conditions and symptoms. However, the BBC withdrew the site as this service is available from other sources on the Internet which did not exist when the Health site launched, the most prominent of which is NHS Choices.

In addition to these subsites, the BBC also runs sites dedicated to education and learning. These include the Bitesize revision website for teenagers and a section with resources for teachers including Learning Zone Class Clips that provides video from educational programmes for use in the classroom.

The BBC plans to merge this content into one easier to access site in the foreseeable future.

BBC Own It is an offshoot that provides online safety advice for parents, teachers, and young people to help them make positive choices online. It follows in the footsteps of other online safety services such as Internet Matters and Childnet.

===Children&#x27;s===
The BBC runs a comprehensive children&#x27;s website. It includes information on all of CBBC&#x27;s shows along with several subsites covering art, sport, news, and other current events. Its message boards are especially popular with children who use them to communicate with each other about all of CBBC&#x27;s output among other salient topics for kids like bullying, books, and personal problems.

In conjunction with the Children&#x27;s subsite, the BBC also runs an online revision website using the Bitesize brand and also ran a message board for students. This latter service, now called &quot;BBC Student Life&quot; and previously called &quot;Onion Street&quot;, was launched in 2001 and is aimed at young people between the ages of 11 and 16. The site offers a pre-moderated forum discussion on school work, revision and other areas of learning.

The BBC previously ran a page to help young people sort out their life difficulties entitled &quot;Your Life&quot;. The page featured agony uncle &quot;Ask Aaron&quot;, a professional psychotherapist who provided regular answers to children&#x27;s questions across the message boards; after the page&#x27;s closure, the agony uncle has moved on to Radio One&#x27;s Sunday Surgery as their mental health expert.

There is integration between television output and website content with aspects of children&#x27;s programming have follow-up information on their websites.

===International-only site===
An international BBC subsite named &quot;BBC Britain&quot; is only available to users with IP addresses outside the UK. UK users attempting to visit the site are told: &quot;We&#x27;re sorry but this site is not accessible from the UK as it is part of our international service and is not funded by the licence fee.&quot; Additional subsites exist which were initially inaccessible to UK users in the same manner as BBC Britain but have since been made accessible while displaying the following disclaimer: &quot;This website is produced by BBC Global News Ltd, a commercial company owned by the BBC (and just the BBC). No money from the licence fee was used to create this website. The money we make from it is re-invested to help fund the BBC&#x27;s international journalism.&quot; These subsites include:

* &quot;Culture&quot; which is a fusion of videos and images coupled with editorial content from a host of well-known and respected journalists and commentators, offering an alternative lens on global trends across the arts.
* &quot;Future&quot; which is universal topics focused on future trends in the worlds of science, technology, environment and health.
* &quot;Worklife&quot; (formerly Capital) which is dedicated to offering a global perspective on economic stories, trends and profiles on a personal level.
* &quot;Autos&quot; which is an entertaining, insightful daily read focused on the passionate side of the motor industry, including design, technology and community.
* &quot;Earth&quot; which is the website of the BBC International channel BBC Earth.
* &quot;Travel&quot; which is a site about all aspects of travel.
* &quot;Reel&quot; which has video features.

===Former subsites===

====BBC Blast====
BBC Blast was the BBC&#x27;s network which encouraged teenagers to become creative in music, film, dance, art and fashion. It provided access to mentors online, and at free events and workshops across the UK. The website specifically catered for 13- to 19-year-olds but the BBC Blast project also ran a variety of work experience schemes for young adults between the ages of 18 and 25. Blast was running from 2002 until 2011. It included an online forum where participants could upload videos, audio tracks and images and comment on each other&#x27;s work. There was an annual season on BBC2 where their films could be shown. The BBC Blast tour built partnerships with local arts organisations around the UK, featuring workshops and talks with stars from a variety of backgrounds, and providing a performance space for participants. These including rapper Akala, director and actor Noel Clarke, the artists Antony Gormley and Jake and Dinos Chapman, BBC Radio 1Xtra DJs Ace and Vis, singer-songwriter Jay Sean, rapper Chipmunk, Panjabi Hit Squad and Yngve &amp; The Innocent. The tour also featured very early performances and interviews by artists such as Rizzle Kicks and Ed Sheeran.

Blast worked with a number of national partners to put on events and give teenagers&#x27; content a chance to be used at a higher level. These included the Victoria and Albert Museum, RSC, National Portrait Gallery, National Theatre, Zoo Nation, and the British Film Institute. 

On 24 January 2011, the BBC announced the closure of BBC Blast as part of a 25% cut to the BBC Online budget, resulting in a £34 million shortfall.

====Cult TV====
From 1999 to 2005, the BBC ran a popular subsite called &quot;Cult TV&quot;. This subsite had news, star interviews, trivia, and other content popular with fans of the cult TV shows they covered. Examples of covered TV shows include &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Farscape&quot; and &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;.

On 15 July 2005, the BBC announced that the site was closing as of the end of the month, although the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; section would be unaffected as the series was an ongoing BBC concern. The announcement explained that this was &quot;part of the restructuring of the BBC&#x27;s online activities&quot;. It was promised that some of the content would be moved to new places on bbc.co.uk, although as of January 2017 it is currently still all online at the no-longer-updated Cult site. In recent years, some of the content covered in the Cult section was included in the BBC&#x27;s Archive section, such as content and information on the 25th Anniversary of Children&#x27;s BBC.

====&quot;BBC Guide to Comedy&quot;====
The &quot;BBC Guide to Comedy&quot; was an online encyclopaedia based on Mark Lewisohn&#x27;s 1998 book &quot;The Radio Times Guide to Comedy&quot;. It offered &quot;Info on every TV comedy shown in the UK, from 1936 to today...&quot; and featured articles on almost every comedy programme and sitcom produced by the main channels in the United Kingdom. The site also featured video clips, viewable in RealPlayer, and a small gallery of cast photographs or screenshots. It was replaced by a smaller, less detailed guide in 2007, which only focussed on BBC shows and is also now discontinued.

====Democracy Live====
Democracy Live was a subsite of the BBC that contains live streams and recorded programmes from deciding bodies that affect the UK. Launched in November 2009, the site focused around live and recorded debate from the House of Commons and the House of Lords in Westminster, the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the European Parliament. While recordings tended to focus on the main debating chambers, the site also hosted video from some committees. The site also included a search facility to find relevant debate, a tool to follow a particular member and see videos of their contributions and other videos of historic events from these institutions. The service also allowed the translation of Welsh Assembly proceedings to and from Welsh.

==Funding==
The BBC&#x27;s site was initially entirely free from advertising; this was due to the BBC&#x27;s funding being derived primarily from compulsory television licence fees from UK viewers. BBC Studios who exploit BBC brands commercially have had several attempts at launching services online including Beeb.com in the late 1990s.

In 2006, the BBC began making controversial plans to raise revenue by including advertising on the international version of BBC News Online accessed from outside the United Kingdom. BBC Online is currently freely available worldwide (via various URLs including bbc.com/news) but planned video services and a lower than expected licence fee settlement paid for by UK residents only led to the BBC introducing banner advertisements to the site from November 2007. The BBC Trust approved the plans for introducing advertisements which also involved creating bbc.com as a part of BBC Worldwide. Sir Michael Lyons, Chairman of the Trust, confirmed the BBC would not charge for online news following News International&#x27;s planned introduction of charges for online content.

Prior to this there had been criticism from some, as web users outside the UK could use the services (including the entire BBC radio services) without having to pay for them. In addition, where rights to sporting events (such as certain football or cricket matches) do not include international online coverage, users from outside the UK are blocked from listening to commentaries.

On 24 January 2011, it was announced that the BBC was to cut its online budget by 25% or £34 million. To cope with this, many BBC websites would be closed including BBC Switch, BBC Blast, 6-0-6, BBC raw, Video Nation, and planned to sell the Douglas Adams created website h2g2, as well as the automation of many programme websites and radio websites.

==Technical details==

===Streaming media===
A service, called BBC iPlayer, was launched in December 2007, which allows users to download both radio and TV content for up to seven days after broadcast. The television version allows users to either stream programmes or to download them using peer-to-peer and DRM technology.

Initially streams were generally broadcast in the RealAudio and RealVideo formats controlled by RealNetworks and the BBC drew criticism with some for using those closed formats which, at the time, could only be played using RealPlayer. In response to such criticisms, the BBC negotiated a deal with RealNetworks a &#x27;cut-down&#x27; version of RealPlayer which did not contain as much advertising and marketing.

Windows Media has also been adopted and since Autumn 2006, a Windows Media stream of all national BBC radio stations has been available.

More recently, the BBC has been experimenting with MP3 downloads and podcasting facilities for an increasing number of radio shows, with a high level of success; a less publicised trial of Ogg Vorbis streams for certain programmes was less successful, and has now been discontinued.

During major events, the BBC often features liveblogs which publish the most recent text and image posts from BBC correspondents; particularly significant political events may pair live blogs with live video streams or recorded video loops relevant to the event.

===Message boards===
In February 2001, BBC Online incorporated Douglas Adams&#x27; previously independent h2g2 project into its group of web sites, and eventually replaced all its existing message boards, which used an archaic system called Howerd, with the DNA software derived from that project. The site&#x27;s now archived &quot;Collective&quot; magazine also used the DNA software along with numerous other sites created after the BBC&#x27;s acquisition of h2g2.

===Developers===
The website has extensive technical information available about its operation. The BBC also made some of the content on bbc.co.uk and the BBC News Website available in XML format on the former developer network backstage.bbc.co.uk. Also, through participation in the Creative Archive Licence group, bbc.co.uk allows legal downloads of selected material via the Internet.

In November 2011, the BBC launched the Connected Studio initiative which resulted in the running of workshops for independent web designers to work with the BBC in conceiving new designs and ways for current BBC services to be improved.

===Tracking cookies and privacy policy===
BBC Online uses several third-party companies to log information from users, by means of cookies. The BBC lists the companies it uses in its privacy policy:
* 24/7 Real Media
* AOL Advertising
* Atlas Solutions (Microsoft Advertising)
* Audience Science
* Google DoubleClick
* Media Mind
* Specific Media
* Yahoo! Network Plus

===Vulnerabilities===
In March 2007, a vulnerability was exposed in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Most Emailed&quot; and &quot;Most Read&quot; news sections which could allow for the popularity of a news article to be exaggerated and thus highlight it to other website visitors.

==Graf report==
In early 2004, the site was made the focus of a government review, launched by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, led by Philip Graf. Sections of the UK Internet industry had argued that the BBC site offered things that were available in the commercial sector, creating unnecessary competition.

The review was published in July 2004 and it was recommended that the BBC &quot;prioritise news, current affairs, education and information which is of value to the citizen.&quot; In response the BBC also shut down a small number of sections of the site, including the Soaps section.

In November 2004, the Governors of the BBC announced a newer, much more tightly drawn remit for bbc.co.uk as part of their response to the review. They also announced, as Graf had recommended, a new approach towards external providers which will see bbc.co.uk aiming to spend at least 25% of its eligible budget on content and services through independent commissions by the end of 2006/07.

The implementation of the Graf report has seen the popular message boards in the BBC Sport section shut down, as the BBC tries to promote its 606 brand, but these changes have proved unpopular as the interface has proven unusable and large numbers of content providers have abandoned the BBC site.

<text>Susannah Darwin (née Wedgwood, 3 January 1765 – 15 July 1817) was the wife of Robert Darwin, a wealthy doctor, and mother of naturalist Charles Darwin, and part of the Wedgwood pottery family.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Susannah Wedgwood was the daughter of Josiah and Sarah Wedgwood and grew up at Etruria Hall, the Wedgwood family home in Stoke on Trent (completed in 1771). Josiah Wedgwood&#x27;s business was already successful and expanding when she was born, and she grew up in increasingly comfortable circumstances. She was the oldest of the Wedgwood&#x27;s eight children, known as &quot;Sukey&quot; within the family. Her baptism in January 1765, at home because of bad weather, was followed by a lobster dinner, with port, for the family, though as a sign of things to come, her father had to leave early to deal with business matters.

At the age of seven, she was sent to a boarding school in Manchester but returned home for the summer holidays &quot;full of pouks, &amp; boils &amp; humours&quot;, according to a letter by her father, so was taken to the spa at Buxton to recover, and thereafter tutored at home, with occasional visits to London to stay with her father&#x27;s friend and business partner Thomas Bentley.

=== Marriage to Robert Darwin ===
Erasmus Darwin, father of Robert Darwin, had long been a friend of Josiah, and she had known the family since childhood, at one point giving Erasmus Junior music lessons (she was an accomplished harpsichordist). Robert and Susannah became engaged in 1794, at the ages of 29 and 28 respectively. They did not marry until 18 April 1796, by which time Robert&#x27;s medical practice in Shrewsbury was well-established. Josiah had died in January 1795, leaving his daughter £25,000, a very considerable sum at the time. Despite the families living in the Midlands, the marriage was at St Marylebone, Middlesex, even then part of London. This was not the present St Marylebone Parish Church, not built until 1813, but what is now called St Peter, Vere Street, appropriately very near Harley Street. 

From 1800, when it was completed, the family lived at The Mount, Shrewsbury, which still stands. She gave birth to Charles Darwin, the fifth of her six children, on 12 February 1809.

=== Death ===
In 1817, she started growing ill, with gastrointestinal symptoms that were probably a sign of either a severe ulcer or stomach cancer. She died on 15 July 1817 aged 52. She, her husband, and their daughter Susan are buried in St Chad&#x27;s Church, Shrewsbury.

<text>Michael Sage Danton (&quot;né&quot; Jefferson, October 21, 1980) is a Canadian-Polish former professional ice hockey player who last played for Rivière-du-Loup 3L in the LNAH.

Danton played for the New Jersey Devils and St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League between 2000 and 2004, before being imprisoned for a conspiracy to commit murder. He was released on parole on September 11, 2009 after 63 months in jail, the original sentence being 90 months.

After being released from prison, he resumed his professional ice hockey career in various European leagues and in North America.

==Junior hockey career==
Danton was known as Mike Jefferson during his junior hockey career. As a youth, Jefferson played in the 1994 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Toronto Young Nationals minor ice hockey team. He began junior hockey in the 1996–97 season with the Quinte Hawks of the Metro Junior A Hockey League. He played in the Ontario Hockey League from 1997 to 2000 with the Sarnia Sting, the Toronto St. Michael&#x27;s Majors, and the Barrie Colts. Playing for the Colts during the 2000 Memorial Cup, Jefferson commented that Brad Richards would not last five games in the Ontario Hockey League and later refused to shake Richards&#x27; hand after he had been named tournament MVP.

==Professional hockey career (2000-2004)==
Selected 135th overall by the New Jersey Devils in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, Danton was a left winger for the St. Louis Blues, who traded a 3rd round draft pick to New Jersey to obtain him. He played 68 games for the Blues in the 2003–04 season. While with the Devils organization, he changed his last name from Jefferson to Danton after becoming estranged from his family. He admitted he adopted the surname &quot;Danton&quot; from the name of a 13-year-old boy at David Frost&#x27;s hockey camp, because the name sounded &quot;cool&quot;. He also feuded with Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello and was suspended by the team, prompting his eventual trade to St. Louis.

==Arrest and imprisonment (2004–2009)==

On April 16, 2004, two days after the Blues were eliminated from the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs by the San Jose Sharks, Danton was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder. On July 16, 2004, he pleaded guilty to attempting to hire a hitman, who was actually a police dispatcher, to murder David Frost, his agent, and was sentenced by U.S. District Judge William Stiehl to seven-and-a-half years in a United States federal prison. To this day, however, Frost denies that he was the target. In 2011, Danton claimed in an interview with ESPN that his original target was his estranged father, Steve Jefferson.

In November 2005, the CBC program &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; aired a documentary, &quot;Rogue Agent&quot;, about the history between Danton and Frost. In it, the documentary casts light on the controlling relationship Frost had with Danton and how he encouraged Danton to estrange himself from his parents, as well as an alleged incident where Frost and a group of his players abused Danton&#x27;s younger brother. The documentary also focuses on a taped telephone call Danton made to Frost a week after his arrest. In it, Frost instructs Danton to plead guilty and ends the conversation demanding Danton say &quot;I love you,&quot; which Danton does, further fueling speculation of a homosexual relationship between the two. In 2006, Frost was charged with 12 counts of sexual exploitation related to acts on three females and four young boys between the ages of 14 and 16, alleged to have occurred during the time that Frost was Danton&#x27;s junior hockey coach, with the Quinte Hawks. Frost was acquitted of all charges on November 28, 2008; the trial included testimony from women who had participated in threesomes with other players and Danton. In an unrelated matter, Frost was also acquitted on February 14, 2009 of fraud charges related to the use of one of Danton&#x27;s credit cards; Danton stated that Frost had his permission to use the card.

In July 2008, in an article in the &quot;Denver Post&quot;, it was revealed that Howard Kieffer, the lawyer who represented Danton in his murder conspiracy case, had never graduated from law school, and so was not licensed to practice law. In September 2008, Kieffer pleaded not guilty to two felony charges, and news reports revealed that he would not be representing himself.

On March 19, 2009, the United States Bureau of Prisons granted Danton&#x27;s request to be transferred to a Canadian prison after five years at FCI Sandstone; he was housed at the Pittsburgh Institution in Joyceville, Ontario. Under Canadian law, Danton was eligible for parole, which was granted on September 11, 2009. Conditions of his parole include no contact with his father (who Danton now claims was the intended target), and no face-to-face meetings with Frost (widely believed to be Danton&#x27;s actual target).

==University hockey career (2010–2011)==
Danton took university correspondence courses at Queen&#x27;s University while imprisoned. In fall 2009 he applied to Saint Mary&#x27;s University in Halifax, Nova Scotia for January 2010 entry. Danton initially enrolled in three courses for the winter 2010 semester and joined the Saint Mary&#x27;s Huskies varsity men&#x27;s hockey team.

On January 27, 2010, Danton played in his first game since being released from prison, and scored a goal for the Saint Mary&#x27;s Huskies, during their 4-1 loss to the Acadia Axemen, played at the Halifax Forum in Halifax. On January 30, 2010, Danton played for the Huskies during a 5-3 loss to the UPEI Panthers played at the MacLauchlan Arena in Charlottetown. On March 28, 2010, the Huskies defeated the Alberta Golden Bears to win the 2010 University Cup, played in Thunder Bay, Ontario.

It was announced by Canadian Interuniversity Sport on October 4, 2010 that Danton had been named an Academic All-Canadian based on a student CIS athlete achieving a grade point average of 3.7 or higher. Danton achieved a 3.9 GPA overall through the winter and spring semesters as well as summer school, and it was revealed in a media story that his study ethic keeps him in the Patrick Power Library at Saint Mary&#x27;s until 11pm each night.

==Return to professional hockey (2011–2017)==
On July 28, 2011, Danton announced on his Twitter account that he had signed with a Swedish professional club for the 2011–12 season. The following day, this was confirmed to be the Division 1 club IFK Ore. The club explained that &quot;We&#x27;re obviously aware of his background but it was years ago&quot;. The club further explained that Danton&#x27;s playing knowledge was the reason why the club chose to acquire him. The club made him team captain upon his arrival in Sweden.

On September 18, 2011, while playing his first game for Ore, Danton saved teammate and linemate Marcus Bengtsson&#x27;s life using skills he learned in prison. Following a hard hit, Bengtsson&#x27;s head struck the ice, and he started convulsing. Danton waited for his teammate&#x27;s mouth to release before using his hand to prevent Bengtsson from choking on his own tongue. Ore won the game 4–3 against Söderhamn/Ljusne HC. Playing in 27 games, Danton scored 16 goals and 25 assists for a total of 41 points.

On December 17, 2011, following Ore&#x27;s failure to reach the spring series called &quot;Allettan&quot;, Orli Znojmo of the Erste Bank Eishockey Liga announced their signing of Danton. He spent the remainder of the season with the South Moravian club.

On May 20, 2012, Coventry Blaze of the Elite Ice Hockey League announced their signing of Danton, although his place at the club was brought to an abrupt end due to the UK Border Agency twice rejecting his application for a UK entry visa.

On September 29, 2012, after the departure of defenseman Dean Moore and forward Bill Keenan to IF Sundsvall of HockeyAllsvenskan, Kramfors-Alliansen of the Swedish Division 1 league signed Danton to a one-year contract.

On January 9, 2013, Danton signed a contract with the HC ’05 Banská Bystrica in the Slovak Extraliga. He then started the 2013–14 season playing for Beibarys Atyrau in Kazakhstan. After complaining about breaches in his contract, he had it terminated and moved to HSC Csíkszereda in Romania.

On January 24, 2014, Danton signed for Ciarko PBS Bank KH Sanok of the Polish Hockey League, until the end of the season. With Sanok, he won the 2013–14 playoff championship. He re-signed for both the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons. Due to financial difficulty, the team did not compete in the 2016–17 season, so Danton went back to North America, signing with Rivière-du-Loup 3L of the LNAH. After one season in the LNAH, he retired from professional hockey.

<doc id="638541" wikidata="Q168387" url="?curid=638541" title="Agatha Barbara">
<text>Agatha Barbara, (11 March 1923 – 4 February 2002) was a Maltese politician, having served as a Labour Member of Parliament and Minister. She was the first woman to serve as president of Malta, and remains the longest-serving woman Member of Parliament in Maltese political history.

==Early life==
Barbara was born in Żabbar, Malta, in 1923. Her father worked as a tug master (a skilled pilot of tugboats) for the Royal Navy, and was very poorly paid. Her mother struggled to feed the nine children on her husband&#x27;s wages. Agatha was the second child and the eldest daughter. 

She pleaded her parents to send her to school and attended grammar school in Valletta, but World War II prevented her from continuing to college. She had to work as an air raid warden and supervised one of the kitchens set up by the British military to feed the population. 

After the war she became a school teacher and got involved in politics. She became a member of the Malta Labour Party (MLP), was very active in party affairs, became member of the MLP executive committee, headed the party women&#x27;s branch and founded the Women&#x27;s Political Movement in Malta.

==Political life==

From 1947, Malta had limited self-government. Voting rights for women were raised by the Women of Malta Association and the Malta Labour Party against loud protests from the Church. The proposal was adopted by a narrow majority. The clashes spurred Barbara to show what women could do, so when people encouraged her, she stood for election in 1947. She became the first and only woman among the 40 MPs, and she was the only woman candidate to successfully contest in ten consecutive elections, until 1982, when she resigned to become president.

Agatha Barbara became known as a warm defender of economic and social reforms. She was Malta&#x27;s first and until the end of the 1990s only woman cabinet minister. When MLP came to power for the first time in 1955, she was appointed as education minister by Dom Mintoff from 1955 to 1958. She undertook comprehensive reforms: instituted compulsory full-time basic education for all children, established a teacher training college and special schools for the disabled, made secondary school free and provided science classes for both girls and boys. In 1958 relations between the British and the Maltese deteriorated. Protests erupted in the streets and Mintoff resigned. Barbara participated in the demonstrations and was sentenced to 43 days &quot;with hard labour&quot;. 

When Mintoff came to power again in 1971, Agatha Barbara was appointed minister of education again. Now compulsory basic education was extended from the age of 14 to 16, trade and technical schools were established and university fees were abolished. In 1974 she became minister for labour, culture and welfare. She worked to reduce unemployment and improve workers&#x27; pay and conditions and industrial relations. She introduced a law on equal pay for women and men, paid maternity leave, a 40-hour working week and retirement and unemployment benefits. She also set up a number of national museums. 
In 1976 Agatha Barbara became deputy chair of the MLP parliamentary group, but not of the party, and deputy prime minister. For shorter periods she served as deputy for Mintoff.

Barbara also took a prominent role in protecting Maltese heritage, playing a crucial role in the restoration of historic buildings in Mdina and Valletta, and promoting their use as museums.

==Presidency==

In 1981 elections led to a constitutional crisis because the Nationalist Party (PN) won a majority of the votes, but only got a minority in parliament: 31 seats against 34 for MLP. PN boycotted parliament and organized protests. Nevertheless, Mintoff took power, but instead of becoming minister, Barbara was appointed as the first woman president, 59 years old, on 15 February 1982. She was the third President of the Republic. 

Usually the position was mainly ceremonial, but her task now was to resolve the constitutional crises. At the end of her term in 1987, Barbara presided over the presentation and acceptance of the 1987 Constitutional reform, ranging from the cementing of Malta&#x27;s independence from foreign powers, to the allocation of additional Parliamentary seats in case a Party obtains an absolute majority of votes at a general election without achieving a Parliamentary majority. In 1987 her term expired and she withdrew from politics.

Barbara appeared on a series of Maltese banknotes which were issued in 1986. She retired in Żabbar, where she was born, and died in 2002. A monument in her honor was unveiled in Żabbar on 23 April 2006 by the then President of Malta, Dr. Edward Fenech Adami.

==Private life==
Barbara was never married. Maltese-Australian author Joseph Chetcuti claimed Barbara was a lesbian in his 2009 book on the LGBT history of Malta, based on interviews with her contemporaries.

In 2014 alleged &quot;romantic letters&quot; written by Barbara to Derek Barnes, a Royal Navy signalman stationed in Malta during World War II, were made public by Barnes&#x27; sister.

<doc id="638548" wikidata="Q42588" url="?curid=638548" title="Chartreux">
<text>The Chartreux is a rare breed of cat from France, and is recognised by a number of registries around the world. The Chartreux is large and muscular (called &quot;cobby&quot;) with relatively short, fine-boned limbs, and very fast reflexes. They are known for their blue (silver-grey) water-resistant short hair double coats which are often slightly thick in texture (often showing &quot;breaks&quot; like a sheepskin) and orange or copper-coloured eyes. Chartreux cats are also known for their &quot;smile&quot;; due to the structure of their heads and their tapered muzzles, they often appear to be smiling. Chartreux are exceptional hunters and are highly prized by farmers.

As for every French cat with a pedigree, the first letter of the official name of a Chartreux cat encodes the year of its birth. All Chartreux born in the same year have official names beginning with the same letter. The code letters rotate through the alphabet each year, omitting the letters K, Q, W, X, Y, and Z. For example, a Chartreux born in 2021 would have an official name starting with the letter S.

==History==

The Chartreux is mentioned for the first time in 1558 by Joachim du Bellay in a poem entitled , or &quot;French verse on the death of a small cat&quot; in English.

There is another representation of a Chartreux in 1747 in the Jean-Baptiste Perronneau&#x27;s painting , into which the cat is painted as a pet, quite rare for the time.

There is a legend that the Chartreux are descended from cats brought to France by Carthusian monks to live in the order&#x27;s head monastery, the Grande Chartreuse, located in the Chartreuse Mountains north of the city of Grenoble. But in 1972, the Prior of the Grande Chartreuse denied that the monastery&#x27;s archives held any records of the monks&#x27; use of any breed of cat resembling the Chartreux.

Legend also has it that the Chartreux&#x27;s ancestors were feral mountain cats from what is now Syria, brought back to France by returning Crusaders in the 13th century, many of whom entered the Carthusian monastic order.

The first documented mention of the breed was by the French naturalist Buffon in the 18th century. The breed was greatly diminished during the first World War and wild populations were not seen after World War II, except perhaps in Belle-Île-en-Mer where the Léger sisters started breeding the best subjects. A later concerted effort by European cat fanciers-breeders kept the Chartreux from extinction. The first Chartreux were brought to the U.S. in 1971 by Helen and John Gamon of La Jolla, California. In 1987, the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA) advanced the Chartreux breed to championship status. There are fewer than two dozen active Chartreux breeders in North America .

Historically, famous Chartreux owners include the French novelist Colette, Charles Baudelaire and the French president Charles de Gaulle.

==Temperament==
Chartreux cats tend to be quiet, rarely making noises such as meowing or crying, and some are even completely mute. They are quite observant and intelligent, with some Chartreux learning to operate radio on/off buttons and to open screen door latches. They take about two years to reach adulthood. Chartreux cats are playful cats well into their adult years; some can be taught to fetch small objects in the same manner as a dog. Chartreux are good with children and other animals. They are non-aggressive, affectionate, good travelers and generally very healthy. Chartreux tend to bond with one person in their household, preferring to be in their general vicinity (often following their favoured person from room to room), though they are still loving and affectionate to the other members of the household.

==In popular culture==
* The mascot of the world&#x27;s largest jazz festival, the Montreal International Jazz Festival, is a blue Chartreux affectionately named &#x27;Ste Cat&#x27; after the festival&#x27;s hub, Sainte Catherine Street in Montreal.
* Gris-Gris, Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s cat, followed him from room to room.

<doc id="638553" wikidata="Q6381586" url="?curid=638553" title="Samford University">
<text>Samford University is a private Christian university in Homewood, Alabama, United States. It was founded by Baptists in 1841 as Howard College and located until 1887 in Marion, Alabama. It is governed by an independent board of trustees, which requires board members to be Baptists.

In the fall of 2024, the university enrolled 6,101 students from 45 states, 1 U.S. territory, and 16 countries.

==History==
===19th century===
In 1841, Samford University was founded as Howard College in Marion, Alabama. It was named for the eighteenth-century English philanthropist John Howard. Some of the land was donated by the Reverend James H. DeVotie, who served on the school&#x27;s board of trustees for fifteen years and as its president for two years. The first financial gift, $4,000, was given by Julia Tarrant Barron and both she and her son also gave land to establish the college. The university also honors the Reverend Milo P. Jewett and Edwin D. King as founders. King and Barron derived much of their wealth, with which they supported the college, from the people they enslaved. The university was established after the Alabama Baptist State Convention decided to build a school for men in Perry County, Alabama. The college&#x27;s first nine students began studies in January 1842 with a traditional curriculum of language, literature and sciences. In those early years, the graduation addresses of several distinguished speakers were published, including those by Thomas G. Keen of Mobile, Joseph Walters Taylor, Noah K. Davis and Samuel Sterling Sherman. In October 1854, a fire destroyed all of the college&#x27;s property, including its only building. While the college was still recovering from the fire, the Civil War began. Howard College was converted to a military hospital by the Confederate government in 1863. During this time, the college&#x27;s remaining faculty offered basic instruction to soldiers recovering at the hospital. For a short period after the war, federal troops occupied the college and sheltered freed slaves on its campus. 

In 1865, the college reopened. Jabez Lamar Monroe Curry, an attorney, former US Congressman and Confederate military officer, served as president from 1865 to 1868. He was committed to the cause of broader education, and supported expansion of normal school training. 

In 1887, Howard College&#x27;s board of trustees accepted an offer of land from the East Lake Land Company owned by Robert Jemison, Sr. and relocated to the newly developing community of East Lake, six miles from the center of Birmingham, Alabama, and moved the institution there. Faculty who remained in Marion formed Marion Military Institute (MMI) on the old campus. MMI continues to operate in Marion.

===20th century===
In 1913, the college became fully and permanently coeducational. Howard College added its School of Music in 1914 and School of Education and Journalism the following year. The college introduced its Department of Pharmacy in 1927. At the time, it was the only program of its kind in the Southeastern United States. During World War II, Howard College hosted a V-12 Navy College Training Program, allowing enlisted sailors to earn college degrees while receiving military training. 

After the war, the number of veterans attending the college under the GI Bill boosted enrollment beyond capacity. The college moved to the Shades Valley in Homewood, Alabama. Construction on the new campus began in 1955. It opened in 1957. In 1961, the college acquired Cumberland School of Law, one of the nation&#x27;s oldest law schools. 

In addition to the law school, Howard College added a new school of business and reorganized to achieve university status in 1965. Since the name &quot;Howard University&quot; was already in use by a school in Washington, D.C., Howard College was renamed as &quot;Samford University&quot; in honor of Frank Park Samford, a longtime trustee of the school. In 1973, the university acquired Ida V. Moffett School of Nursing. Samford University established a study center in 1984 for students to study abroad in Kensington, England. On September 21, 1989, a Samford University professor, William Lee Slagle, fatally stabbed one of his debating team students and escaped. Slagle was finally captured six months later.

In 1994, Samford&#x27;s board of trustees voted to allow the board to elect its own members. This gave the university formal independence from the Alabama Baptist State Convention, but until 2017 convention leaders retained ex officio seats on the board, were consulted on trustee selection, and the new trustees were presented to the convention for affirmation. Convention leaders are still invited to the board&#x27;s meetings. The university&#x27;s corporate expression of faith commitment remains &quot;The Statement of the Baptist Faith and Message of 1963&quot;, without amendment.

===Civil rights===
As a private, segregated institution, Samford University was to some degree insulated from the activities of leaders and protesters of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and early 1960s. The officers of the Samford Student Government Association challenged a segregated concert held on campus by the Birmingham Symphony by inviting as guests the student government officers of nearby Miles College, a historically black school.

Segregation by private universities was outlawed by the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Initially, the school&#x27;s leaders declined to express their commitment to desegregation. For example, the university declined to apply for the NDEA Student Loan Program for 1965-66 because it would have to affirm desegregation. Cumberland School of Law faced the greatest immediate risk of losing accreditation. In 1967, it admitted Samford&#x27;s first black student, Audrey Lattimore Gaston. The entire university proceeded with desegregation. In the fall of 1969 Elizabeth Sloan Ragland became the first African American student to live on campus. On June 1, 2020, the university announced the installation of a memorial honoring &quot;the sacrifices of many African Americans for the mission and vision of Samford University even in days when their efforts were invisible or barely acknowledged.&quot; It specifically named Gaston and an enslaved servant named Harry who died while saving students from the 1854 fire. A public dedication of the memorial was held on February 15, 2022. In 2024, the university announced a new residence hall would be named in honor of Gaston.

===21st century===
Andrew Westmoreland was appointed president of the university in 2006. That year, the Jane Hollock Brock Recital Hall was dedicated as part of the university’s fine arts complex. A new soccer and track facility opened in 2011, part of a decade-long expansion of new athletics facilities that included a tennis center, a basketball arena, a football field house and a softball stadium. For the 2016–17 academic year, the economic and fiscal impacts of the university on Alabama were $424.8 million, 2,424 jobs, $16.1 million in state income and sales taxes, and $6 million in local sales tax. In 2013, the university established a new College of Health Sciences, including the existing Ida V. Moffett School of Nursing and McWhorter School of Pharmacy, and the newly created School of Health Professions and the School of Public Health. The dean of the nursing school, Nena Sanders, was named vice-provost of the new college, and after her retirement in 2020 the nursing school was renamed the Moffett &amp; Sanders School of Nursing. In 2013, the university announced the construction of a new facility to house Brock School of Business. In 2014, the West Village residence complex opened. That December, the university purchased the adjacent headquarters of Southern Progress, a subsidiary of Time, Inc. It subsequently named these buildings the home of the College of Health Sciences. 

The university ended its long financial connection with the Alabama Baptist State Convention in July 2017 when the trustees announced they would no longer accept funds from the convention. Later that year Samford and the state convention agreed that Samford would no longer present its slate of trustees to the convention for affirmation and that convention officers would no longer have an &quot;ex officio&quot; position on the board. This ended key aspects of Samford&#x27;s formal connection to the state convention that had existed for decades. Still, by the trustees’ own rule, all trustees must be members of Baptist churches and 75% from Alabama. Samford is a collaborative partner of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities. In August 2020, Westmoreland announced he would retire on June 30, 2021. On March 10, 2021, it was announced that he will be succeeded by Whitworth University president Beck A. Taylor. Taylor took office on July 1, 2021.

In May 2022, the university received a $100 million gift from the estate of alumnus Marvin Mann. This was the largest single-donor gift ever made to a higher education institution in Alabama.

===LGBTQ rights===
Samford has been involved in several well publicized incidents in which the university rejected LGBTQ+ students&#x27; requests to form student organizations or refused to work with Christian groups that were LGBTQ+ affirming. In 2017, President Westmoreland rejected Samford Together, an organization that sought to create a space for students to discuss topics related to sexual orientation and gender identity “in an open-minded and accepting environment,” even though the organization had been approved by both the Student Government Association and the faculty. 

Similar actions occurred again in 2022. In late August, Samford administration “uninvited” representatives of Episcopalian and Presbyterian campus ministries from a campus event because these ministries were affirming of LGBTQ+ individuals. In justifying the move, Vice President of Student Affairs Phil Kimrey stated, “Throughout its history, the university has consistently subscribed to and practiced biblically orthodox beliefs,&quot; and &quot;the university has a responsibility to formally partner with ministry organizations that share our beliefs.” On-campus protests against the change included a silent vigil outside a university-wide worship service on September 20. On September 30, President Beck Taylor stated more explicitly in a video message that &quot;we decided to limit Samford’s formal ministry partnerships to churches and to organizations that support Samford’s traditional view of human sexuality and marriage.&quot; This ended Samford’s nearly thirty-year relationship with Birmingham Episcopal Campus Ministries. In October, Taylor declined university recognition to a chapter of OUTLaw at Samford&#x27;s Cumberland School of Law. OUTLaw is a national organization supporting LGBTQ+ law students. 

As of 2023, an off-campus student group, Samford Prism, had been formed to support LGBTQ+ students. Another group of alumni and other community members, SAFE Samford, also advocated on behalf of students.

==Academics==

Samford, a Christian university, offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs, with 170 undergraduate majors, minors and concentrations. The university is divided into the School of the Arts, Howard College of Arts and Sciences, Brock School of Business, Beeson Divinity School, Orlean Beeson School of Education, Cumberland School of Law, Moffett &amp; Sanders School of Nursing, McWhorter School of Pharmacy, School of Health Professions, and School of Public Health. The faculty-to-student ratio at Samford University is 1:13. Approximately two-thirds of the university&#x27;s classes have fewer than 20 students.

===Admissions===
In 2023, the college accepted 83.3% of applicants, with those admitted having an average 3.8 GPA and an average 1160 SAT score or average 26 ACT score.

==Campus==
Samford has moved four times during its history. Originally, Howard College was located in Marion, Alabama, a black-belt town between Selma and Tuscaloosa; it was later the birthplace of Coretta Scott King. The college moved twice in the town. Its second campus is now the home of Marion Military Institute. In 1887, the college moved to the East Lake community in Birmingham across the street from Ruhama Baptist Church. The university is now located approximately south of downtown Birmingham in Homewood, Alabama&#x27;s Shades Valley along Lakeshore Drive in Homewood, just from Interstate 65. It is built in the Georgian Colonial style based on Colonial Williamsburg as envisioned by Lena Vail Davis, wife of then President Harwell Davis when the campus was moved to the Shades Valley area of Jefferson County in 1953-57. The campus location was chosen in consultation with Olmsted Brothers, the famous Massachusetts-based landscape design firm. Most elements of its initial site plan, however, were not included in the final plan by the Birmingham architectural firm Van Keuren &amp; Davis. This firm, known has Davis Architects since 1986, has designed almost all buildings on the campus.

In 1983 the university established a study center in London, England, to facilitate students studying abroad. Named the Daniel House, the center is located at 12 Ashburn Gardens in South Kensington and hosts 15-24 students each semester.

In 2014 the university purchased the campus of the Southern Progress Corporation which borders its main campus to the east. (The land had originally been part of Samford&#x27;s undeveloped campus and was previously sold by Samford to Southern Progress.) The three huge buildings on the former Southern Progress campus are strikingly modern in their architecture and nestled among trees. This contrasts with the Georgian Colonial classicism of the central campus.

<doc id="638560" wikidata="Q1400450" url="?curid=638560" title="Xanadu (Titan)">
<text>Xanadu (often called &quot;Xanadu Regio&quot;, though this is not its official name) is a highly reflective area on the leading hemisphere of Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan. Its name comes from an alternate transcription of Shangdu, the summer capital of the Yuan dynasty established by Kublai Khan and made famous by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

The feature was first identified in 1994 by astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope at infrared wavelengths, and has recently been imaged in more detail by the Cassini space probe. Xanadu is about the size of Australia. Preliminary observations indicate that Xanadu is a plateau-like region of highly reflective water ice, contrasting somewhat with the darker lower regions. These in turn seem to contrast quite sharply with the very dark maria, which were once believed to be seas of liquid hydrocarbons, but are now thought to be plains.

Images by Cassini during encounters in October and December 2004 reveal complex albedo patterns in the western portion of Xanadu. While scientists are still debating the significance and cause of the albedo patterns, one likely culprit is tectonism. Evidence for this exists in a pattern of criss-crossing dark lineaments near the western side of Xanadu. Scientists are also investigating the boundary between Xanadu and Shangri-La, a dark region to the west. The shape of the boundary suggests that the dark material embays the bright terrain.

Radar images taken by Cassini have revealed dunes, hills, rivers and valleys present on Xanadu. The features are likely carved in water ice by liquid methane or ethane. Water ice behaves similarly to rock at the pressures and temperatures present on Titan&#x27;s surface.

<doc id="638571" wikidata="Q316417" url="?curid=638571" title="Thomas P. Stafford">
<text>Thomas Patten Stafford (September 17, 1930 – March 18, 2024) was an American Air Force officer, test pilot, and NASA astronaut, and one of 24 astronauts who flew to the Moon. He also served as Chief of the Astronaut Office from 1969 to 1971.

After graduating from the United States Naval Academy, Stafford was commissioned in the United States Air Force, flying the F-86 Sabre before becoming a test pilot. He was selected to become an astronaut in 1962, and flew aboard Gemini 6A in 1965 and Gemini 9A in 1966. In 1969, he commanded Apollo 10, the second crewed mission to orbit the Moon. Here, he and Gene Cernan became the first to fly an Apollo Lunar Module in lunar orbit, descending to an altitude of .

In 1975, Stafford was the commander of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) flight, the first joint U.S.-Soviet space mission. A brigadier general at the time, he became the first general officer to fly in space. He was the first member of his Naval Academy class to pin on the first, second, and third stars of a general officer. He made six rendezvous in space and logged 507 hours of space flight.

Stafford flew more than 120 types of fixed-wing and rotary aircraft and three types of spacecraft. After the deaths of Wally Schirra, Eugene Cernan, and John Young, he was the last surviving crew member of Gemini 6A, Gemini 9A, and Apollo 10.

In 1993, the Stafford Air &amp; Space Museum was founded in his hometown of Weatherford, Oklahoma. Originally just two rooms, it has grown to over 63,000 square feet (5,850 m2) of artifact space. It is a Smithsonian affiliate and is the only museum in the world to house test-fired engines that would have been used in the Space Race: a U.S. F-1 engine and a Soviet NK-33 engine. It holds the Gemini 6 spacecraft that he and Schirra flew in a rendezvous with Gemini 7.

== Early life and education ==
Thomas Patten Stafford was born on September 17, 1930, in Weatherford, Oklahoma, to Dr. Thomas Sabert Stafford, a dentist, and Mary Ellen Stafford (), a former teacher. Thomas Sabert Stafford was diagnosed with skin cancer in 1944, and died on June 22, 1948. Mary Stafford remained in Weatherford until her death in August 1987. Stafford became interested in aviation following the start of World War II, as the nearby city El Reno has an Army Air Corps training base. Stafford began making model airplanes, and made his first flight at the age of 14 in a Piper Cub. He attended Weatherford High School and graduated in 1948.

In his senior year of high school, Stafford was recruited to play football at the University of Oklahoma, where he had received a Navy ROTC scholarship. Stafford applied to the United States Naval Academy, and was accepted to the Class of 1952. Stafford intended to play football for the Navy Midshipmen, but sustained a career-ending knee injury during a preseason practice session. After his freshman year, he sailed aboard the battleship , where his roommate was John Young, his future Apollo 10 command module pilot. After his second year, Stafford spent a summer at NAS Pensacola, where he was exposed to naval aviation and flew in the SNJ Trainer. On a trip home to Weatherford, Stafford began dating his future wife, Faye Shoemaker. After his third year, he served aboard , a destroyer escorting USS &quot;Missouri&quot;. While visiting home during his fourth year, Stafford became engaged to Faye in December 1951. In the spring of 1952, he was selected in a lottery to join the United States Air Force upon graduation. Stafford graduated from the Naval Academy with a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering with honors in 1952, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Air Force.

==Military service==
In high school, Stafford served in the 45th Infantry Division in the Oklahoma National Guard. Soon after, he transferred to the division&#x27;s 158th Field Artillery Battalion, where he plotted targets for artillery fires.

Stafford attended the first phase of pilot training at Greenville AFB, Mississippi, San Marcos AFB, Texas and Connally AFB, Texas, where he flew the T-6 Texan and the T-33 Shooting Star. While on a training mission at San Marcos AFB, he was involved in a mid-air collision with another student pilot. Stafford and his instructor were able to land, but the other student pilot was killed. He graduated from pilot training on September 1, 1953, and moved to Tyndall AFB, Florida, for F-86 Sabre training. In 1954, Stafford was assigned to the 54th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota, where he flew the F-86 mission for Arctic defense. In 1955, Stafford transferred to the 496th Fighter Interceptor Squadron at Hahn Air Base (now Frankfurt-Hahn Airport), West Germany, again flying interceptor mission in the F-86 Sabre. In addition, he served as an assistant maintenance officer, developing his interest in applying for the USAF Experimental Flight Test Pilot School.

In 1958, Stafford attended the Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards AFB, California, where he finished first in his class, and received the A. B. Honts Award. After graduation, he remained at Edwards AFB as a flight instructor. While working as an instructor, Stafford created the first civilian instructor position at Test Pilot School to ensure continuity, and co-wrote the &quot;Pilot&#x27;s Handbook for Performance Flight Testing&quot; and the &quot;Aerodynamics Handbook for Performance Flight Testing&quot;. At the end of his assignment, Stafford was accepted at Harvard Business School, and moved to Boston, Massachusetts, in September 1962. Three days after arriving, he was accepted to NASA Group Two.

==NASA career==
In April 1962, while working as a flight instructor, Stafford applied for the next round of astronaut selection. The required interviews and medical screenings occurred over the summer of 1962 at Brooks Air Force Base and in Houston. On September 14, 1962, Stafford was selected for Astronaut Group 2, alongside eight other future astronauts.

===Project Gemini===
====Gemini 6A====

Stafford was originally scheduled to fly with Alan Shepard on the first crewed Gemini mission, Gemini 3, but was replaced when Shepard was removed from the flight rotation after being diagnosed with Ménière&#x27;s disease. Stafford was paired with Wally Schirra as pilot and commander, respectively, and the pair was reassigned as the backup crew for Gemini 3, and primary crew for Gemini 6.

The original Gemini 6 mission profile involved docking with an Agena target vehicle. On October 25, 1965, Schirra and Stafford were inside Gemini 6 before liftoff when the Agena vehicle exploded on ascent. After the original mission was canceled, it was redesignated Gemini 6A and was planned to rendezvous with the long-duration Gemini 7 mission. Gemini 7 lifted off on December 4, 1965. On December 12, 1965, Gemini 6A&#x27;s ignition was followed by an immediate engine shutdown. Schirra and Stafford did not eject, and the cause of the shutdown was found to be an electrical issue and a cap inadvertently left on a fuel line.

On December 15, 1965, Gemini 6A lifted off and rendezvoused with Gemini 7. The two spacecraft kept station for about five hours, coming within feet of each other. Gemini 6A splashed down on December 16, and was recovered by .

====Gemini 9A====

Before Gemini 6A, Stafford was assigned as the backup commander for Gemini 9 with Eugene Cernan as the backup pilot. Charlie Bassett and Elliot See were the primary crew. On February 28, 1966, both crews flew in T-38 Talons to Lambert Field to visit the McDonnell Douglas Gemini assembly facility. Bassett and See crashed on landing, and were killed. Stafford and Cernan became the Gemini 9 primary crew, with Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin as their backup crew.

On May 17, 1966, the Agena target vehicle went off course and was shut down before entering orbit. As there was no replacement Agena rocket, the new target for the mission was the Augmented Target Docking Adapter (ATDA), which achieved orbit on June 1, 1966. The Gemini 9A launch, scheduled for later the same day, was canceled due to a computer error. Gemini 9A launched on June 3, and rendezvoused with the ATDA on the second orbit. Its shroud had only partially opened and Gemini 9A was unable to dock with it. Stafford and Cernan instead conducted orbital rendezvous maneuvers with it, including a simulated rescue of a lunar module in a lower orbit.

The following day, Cernan attempted an extravehicular activity (EVA), with the primary mission of testing the Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU). After exiting the spacecraft, Cernan quickly experienced mobility issues, followed by environmental regulation and communication issues. The EVA was aborted, and Cernan returned to the capsule after two hours. On June 6, Gemini 9A landed, and was recovered by USS &quot;Wasp&quot;.

After Gemini 9A, Stafford was assigned as the backup command module pilot on what was then planned as Apollo 2, with Frank Borman as the commander and Mike Collins as the lunar module pilot. For his technical assignment, Stafford was tasked as an astronaut liaison for the development of Apollo guidance and navigation systems, as well as the command and service module. In late 1966, he was reassigned to Apollo 2 backup commander, with Apollo 10 crewmates John Young as the command module pilot and Gene Cernan as the lunar module pilot. While testing the command module, they received word of the Apollo 1 fire and subsequent suspension of the Apollo program.
====Apollo 10====
In the spring of 1968, Deke Slayton announced that the previous backup crew for Apollo 2 would become the primary crew for Apollo 10. In preparation for the mission, Stafford helped design a color camera to replace the grainy black-and-white video broadcast before from space; he felt that public outreach was a vital aspect of the mission. The command module (CM) was nicknamed &quot;Charlie Brown&quot;; the lunar module (LM) was nicknamed &quot;Snoopy&quot;.

Apollo 10 lifted off on May 18, 1969. Despite heavy oscillation during ascent, Apollo 10 achieved orbit without incident, docked the LM and CM, and achieved its translunar injection burn. Upon arriving in lunar orbit, Stafford and Cernan undocked in the LM and entered an elliptical orbit with a periapsis (the closest distance) of nine miles over the lunar surface. To provide reconnaissance, the periapsis coincided with the Sea of Tranquility, the intended landing site for Apollo 11. Upon ascent, the LM began turning rapidly from a misaligned switch on the Abort Guidance System; Stafford was able to regain control and conduct the burn to rendezvous with the CM. The LM docked with the CM to return the astronauts and was jettisoned. After two days in lunar orbit, Apollo 10 began its return trajectory. Along the return, the capsule traveled at , setting the record for the fastest speed by a human being. Apollo 10 splashed down east of Samoa and was recovered by .

==== Apollo-Soyuz Test Project ====

In July 1969, Stafford replaced Alan Shepard (who had returned to flight status) as Chief of the Astronaut Office. Along with Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton, Stafford oversaw assignments to the upcoming Apollo and Skylab missions until Shepard resumed the position after Apollo 14 in July 1971. During this period, U.S. President Richard Nixon and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin agreed to the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP). Stafford was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in late 1972, and was soon named the commander of ASTP, along with Slayton (who had also returned to flight status) and Vance Brand.

Beginning in 1973, the ASTP team trained extensively in Russia and the United States. Soyuz 19, carrying Alexei Leonov and Valery Kubasov, launched on July 15, 1975, at 12:20 UTC, followed by Apollo at 19:50 UTC. After two days in space, Soyuz and Apollo docked on July 17, where the crews met and conducted joint experiments and held press conferences. After remaining docked for 44 hours, the two spacecraft undocked on July 19. Soyuz returned to Earth on July 21; Apollo remained in orbit until July 24. While descending, the Apollo command module began filling with nitrogen tetroxide from the reaction control thrusters. The crew donned oxygen masks, but Brand lost consciousness and had to be assisted by Stafford. All crew were safely recovered aboard , and were hospitalized in Hawaii for edema (swelling) from fuel inhalation.

==Post-NASA career==
In June 1975, before ASTP, Stafford was offered command of the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB. He accepted and assumed the assignment on November 15, 1975. Stafford oversaw the Air Force and NASA test facilities at Edwards AFB, as well as test ranges in Utah and Nevada. He continued to fly (including foreign aircraft such as the MiG-17 and Panavia Tornado) and was involved in the interview of Viktor Belenko after his defection. Stafford also managed the development of the XST, which would later evolve into the F-117 Nighthawk. In March 1978, he was promoted to lieutenant general and became Deputy Chief of Staff, Research Development and Acquisition in Washington, D.C. While working in Washington, Stafford advocated for the creation of the mobile MX missile, and began developing the Advanced Technology Bomber, the predecessor to the B-2 stealth bomber.

With no statement of need or requirements, Stafford pushed for and started a larger attack stealth aircraft named Senior Trend, which was later designated the Stealth Attack F-117A. The F-117A flew in just two years and eight months after the contract with Lockheed was signed. The aircraft became operational in less than five years. During Desert Storm, it was the only plane that secured airspace above Baghdad on the opening night of combat in 1991. The F-117A flew less than two percent of the air-to-ground combat missions, but it was responsible for attacking 43 percent of the Iraqi strategic targets.

In early 1979, before giving a speech at the Chicago chapter of the Air Force Association, Stafford met with the Chairman of Northrop whose company had started a low-speed experimental stealth reconnaissance program for DARPA and the U.S. Army using smooth surfaces. On a piece of hotel stationery, Stafford wrote specs for range, payload, radar cross-section, and gross take-off weight for an advanced stealth technology bomber, which later became designated as the B-2. To further enhance his emphasis on stealth, he started a competition between the firms of Boeing, General Dynamics, and also included Lockheed because of their stealth technology, to develop a stealth supercruise missile. Out of that came the AGM-129 Stealth Cruise missile developed by General Dynamics. It was a 2,000 nautical mile super stealth nuclear-armed cruise missile with a W-80-1 warhead and 130 Kilotons yield. He then started the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program to replace the F-15 (now the F-22) as an air superiority fighter. Stafford retired to Norman, Oklahoma, on November 1, 1979.

Following his retirement, Stafford served on several corporate boards, including Omega SA, Gibraltar Exploration, and Gulfstream Aerospace. He originally intended to reunite with his ASTP crewmates in Russia, but the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the subsequent 1980 Olympics boycott, left them unable to travel to Russia. Stafford created a consulting firm, Stafford, Burke, and Hecker, with two recently retired United States Air Force general officers, Lieutenant General Kelly H. Burke, and Major General Guy L. Hecker Jr. In July 1990, Vice President Quayle and Admiral Richard Truly, then the NASA administrator, asked Stafford to chair a committee (the &quot;Synthesis Committee&quot;) that advised NASA on their overall effort toward long-term lunar and Mars missions, the Space Exploration Initiative. Stafford and his team of 42 full-time members and 150 part-time members created a long-term plan with lunar missions in 2004 and a Mars mission in 2012. In 1992, Stafford began work as an advisor for Space Station Freedom, the precursor to the International Space Station (ISS). While coordinating Russian involvement, Stafford became a technical advisor for the Shuttle–Mir program, particularly STS-63 and STS-71. He also served on a review committee for the Progress-Mir Collision.

In 2002, Stafford published an autobiography written with Michael Cassutt, titled &quot;We Have Capture: Tom Stafford and the Space Race&quot;. He also wrote the epilogue of the 2011 book &quot;Falling to Earth: An Apollo 15 Astronaut&#x27;s Journey to the Moon&quot; by fellow Apollo astronaut Al Worden.

Stafford and Soviet commander Alexey Leonov, became lasting friends, with Leonov being the godfather of Stafford&#x27;s younger children. Stafford gave a eulogy in Russian at Leonov&#x27;s funeral in October 2019.

==Personal life and death==
In 1953, Stafford married Faye Shoemaker from Weatherford, Oklahoma. Faye and Stafford had two daughters, Dionne (born 1954) and Karin (born 1957). Faye and Stafford divorced in 1985. Stafford later married Linda Ann Dishman in December 1988. They had two adopted sons, Michael Thomas and Stanislav &quot;Stas&quot; Patten. Stafford enjoyed hunting, weight lifting, gliding, scuba diving, fishing and swimming.

Stafford died from liver cancer at a care home in Satellite Beach, Florida, on March 18, 2024, at the age of 93.

==Awards and honors==
Throughout his career, Stafford received numerous awards for his accomplishments. He was a recipient of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Award (1969), the Harmon International Aviation Trophy (1966), the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Special Trustees Award (1969), the Society of Experimental Test Pilots James H. Doolittle Award (1979) and the Elmer A. Sperry Award (2008). Stafford received recognition from the U.S. and Russian governments, with the U.S. Congressional Space Medal of Honor (1993) and the Russian Medal &quot;For Merit in Space Exploration&quot; (2011).

Stafford&#x27;s military decorations and awards include: the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster, Air Force Commendation Medal and Air Force Outstanding Unit Award ribbon with three oak leaf clusters. Other awards presented to Stafford include: NASA Distinguished Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, NASA Exceptional Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Octave Chanute Award (1976), the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Space Award, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1976), the National Geographic Society&#x27;s General Thomas D. White USAF Space Trophy (1975), and the A. B. Honts Award as the outstanding graduate from the USAF Experimental Test Pilot School. He was awarded the Gold Space Medal from the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) in 1976. FAI created an exception that allowed Leonov to be awarded it alongside him; typically the award is restricted to one person per year. The RNASA Foundation awarded him with their highest honor, the National Space Trophy, in 1993.

In 2011, Stafford was awarded the National Aeronautic Association Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy, and the Air Force Association&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2014. Stafford is an inductee of the National Aviation Hall of Fame, Oklahoma Aviation and Space Hall of Fame, International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame, the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame, and the International Space Hall of Fame. He was a fellow of the American Astronautical Society, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, and a member of the Explorers Club. In 2019, he was awarded the General James E. Hill Lifetime Space Achievement Award.

Honoraria: Stafford was the recipient of a Doctorate of Science from Oklahoma City University; a Doctorate of Laws from Western State University; a Doctorate of Communications from Emerson College, and a Doctorate of Aeronautical Engineering from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

In his hometown of Weatherford, Stafford was honored with a building at Southwestern Oklahoma State University named in his honor, the Thomas P. Stafford Airport, and the Stafford Air &amp; Space Museum.
The Stafford Building at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City is named after him.
In September 2018, Stafford was depicted in a corn maze in Hydro, Oklahoma.

<doc id="638579" wikidata="Q5193960" url="?curid=638579" title="Cumberland School of Law">
<text>Cumberland School of Law is an ABA-accredited law school at Samford University in Homewood, Alabama, United States. It was founded in 1847 at Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee and is the 11th oldest law school in the United States. 

The school offers two degree programs: the 90-hour Juris Doctor (J.D.), and the Master of Comparative Law (M.C.L.), which is designed to educate foreign lawyers in the basic legal principles of the United States. The school also offers eight dual-degree programs and a Master of Laws (LL.M) program with concentrations in financial service regulatory compliance, health law and policy, higher education law and compliance, and legal project management.

Cumberland Law School is unrelated to the University of the Cumberlands in Williamsburg, Kentucky, and is no longer a part of Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee.

==History==
This summary is based on &quot;From Maverick to Mainstream&quot;, a review of Cumberland&#x27;s history and the development of the American legal education system.

Langum and Walthall summarize the history of Cumberland Law School as:

From its very local, Tennessee origins in 1847, Cumberland...emerged as a premier law school with a national status. It excelled in faculty, teaching methodology, and numbers of students. Following the American Civil War, Cumberland rebuilt itself and ultimately succeeded on a grand scale with its single-year curriculum.

===Early years and founding===
Cumberland School of Law was founded on July 29, 1847 in Lebanon, Tennessee at Cumberland University. At the end of 1847, there were 15 law schools in the United States.

Prior to the law school&#x27;s official founding, Cumberland University facilitated the study of law and admitted a diverse student body, evidenced by graduates such as George W. Harkins, a Choctaw chief, who received a law degree from Cumberland and became a judge in 1834.
===Antebellum years===
Prior to the founding of the United States&#x27; first law schools, the primary means for a legal education was apprenticeship. Establishing law schools was difficult in the early 19th century. Harvard was only able to reestablish its law school in 1829 and Yale in 1826. By 1859, Cumberland, Harvard, and the University of Virginia School of Law were the three largest law schools in the United States. A year later, in 1860, only 21 university law schools existed in the country, and, in no school did the curriculum extend beyond two years.

During the Antebellum years, Cumberland enjoyed success. Nathan Green Jr., son of then professor Nathan Green Sr., stated that Cumberland enjoyed &quot;the highest degree of prosperity&quot;, with a beautiful campus, picturesque trees and fences, and fine architecture. Cumberland&#x27;s first graduate Paine Page Prim ultimately became chief justice of the Oregon Supreme Court.

Students were taught through reading treatises, approximately two hours worth of recitations each morning, and a mandatory moot court program. Caruthers considered the law a science and the Socratic Method a necessity. The cost was $50 a session and a $5 &quot;contingent fee&quot;. After the Civil War, this treatise method, the legal formalism of the school&#x27;s approach, and Nathan Green Jr.&#x27;s unwillingness to make changes, were all considered reasons for Cumberland&#x27;s drift out of the mainstream.

===Civil war===
At the start of the American Civil War, the campus split within a week; some students joined the northern army; many joined the southern. Nathan Green Jr.&#x27;s father, a law professor, went home, but in fear of arrest, Abraham Caruthers fled to Marietta, Georgia, where he died a year later.

During the war, professors John Carter and Nathan Green Jr. fought as Confederate officers. Carter was killed, but Green survived. The campus did not. The trees were cut down and fences destroyed and burned. The Confederate Army burned the University buildings, apparently because a Confederate major was offended that Black Union soldiers had used them as barracks.

===Reconstruction===
The law school began the slow process of rebuilding. In July 1866, Cumberland adopted the image of the phoenix, the mythological Egyptian bird that is reborn from its own ashes. The new motto was &quot;E Cineribus Resurgo&quot; or &quot;I rise from the ashes.&quot;

In September 1865 classes resumed with 11 students, which soon grew to 20. The 1865 class included a Confederate General and Union colonel, enemies only a few months earlier. Nathan Green Jr. kept the school together until Henry Cooper, a circuit judge, Andrew B. Martin, and Robert L. Caruthers, brother of deceased founder Abraham Caruthers, joined the faculty. Robert Caruthers had previously served as the state attorney general and had been elected Governor of Tennessee during the war in 1863, but was never inaugurated.
In 1873 Robert Caruthers purchased Corona Hall from the Corona Institute for Women for $10,000, which he immediately donated to the University for use by the law school.

The destruction of the campus and the devastation of war had impoverished the school, and it was almost 15 years before it saw students enter from outside the South, when a student from Illinois and a member of the Choctaw Nation enrolled at Cumberland. But there were few students from outside of the defeated Southern states, which Langum and Walthall claim underscored &quot;how terribly the Civil War blighted Cumberland.&quot;

Robert Caruthers persisted, despite the setbacks, and in 1878 Caruthers Hall was dedicated in his honor. This new school replaced Corona Hall, which had limitations. The new hall apparently had &quot;excellent acoustics and hard seats&quot; and is described as a:

splendid structure, built after the latest architectural style, is nearly one hundred feet from base to spire, and contains two recitation rooms for the Law Department, two Society Halls, a Library, and a chapel whose seating capacity is about seven hundred.

===National shift in legal education===
Despite the heroic efforts to keep the school alive, Cumberland was falling into the minority at the turn of the 20th century. It maintained a one-year curriculum when other schools moved toward longer terms, and it was entrenched with legal formalism, which had reached its peak in the 1870s and would soon be on the decline. In 1876, for instance, Harvard Law School began to encourage a three-year curriculum. Through 1919, Cumberland did not adapt to the shift in legal education.

Historian Lewis L. Laska observed that:

Cumberland, which had once marked the high point of professional education, had become a captive of its own success. Unwilling to adopt modern techniques such as the case method, or to expand and deepen its curriculum by opting for the three-year standard, Cumberland became the symbol of the democratic bar.

In 1903 Nathan Green Jr. became the first dean of the law school. For the prior 57 years the school did not have this position, which was becoming more and more popular among law schools.

Cumberland first admitted women in 1901, and the library grew from 600 volumes in 1869 to 3000 in 1878. Today, the Lucille Stewart Beeson Law Library contains 300,000 volumes and microform volume equivalents.

In 1915 Cumberland refurbished its halls with an $8000 grant from the U.S. government as reparation for federal occupancy during the Civil War.

When Cordell Hull graduated from Cumberland, he commented on the diploma privilege, which granted the right to practice law without taking a bar exam, saying that

according to custom, we members of the graduating class, the moment we received our diplomas, took them to the courthouse, where a district judge awaited us. He swore us in as members of the bar. I was not 20 years old.

Cordell Hull is today honored at Cumberland with a Moot Court room bearing his name.

Cumberland eventually did adapt to the changing times, moving from Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee, to Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama in 1961. It is one of a few law schools in the United States to have been sold from one university to another (others include the University of Puget Sound selling its law school to Seattle University and the Quinnipiac University School of Law, formerly part of the University of Bridgeport).

===Planning===

In December 2005 Cumberland adopted a long-term plan for the school. One call of the plan is to gradually downsize the number of students in order to provide smaller classes and closer individual attention to students. In 1995 the entering class was 212 and by 2023 that number had been reduced to 152.

Today the law school is known for its emphasis on trial advocacy and is building a biotechnology emphasis through its Biotechnology Center.

==Institution==
The law school emphasizes practical skills and integrity. Former dean, former federal judge John L. Carroll (class of &#x27;74), has stated that:

The prevailing philosophy is simple: Practical skill outweighs raw knowledge, and application transcends erudition. If the goal were to produce great law students, the tenets might be exactly the opposite. Our goal is to produce exceptional lawyers. That&#x27;s why Cumberland’s curriculum emphasizes the core competencies of legal practice: research, writing and persuasion.

===Curriculum===
The first-year required classes are Civil Procedure, Contracts, Property, Torts, Criminal Law, and Evidence. Students are divided into one of three sections, where the students remain together in their respective classes for the entire first year. First-year students are also enrolled in smaller sections for Lawyering and Legal Reasoning, a class that focuses on honing the students&#x27; ability to think and write like a lawyer.

Second- and third-year courses allow students more choices and some degree of specialization. Cumberland offers a balance of traditional courses, such as Criminal Procedure, Family Law, and Basic Federal Income Tax, and practical courses, such as Basic and Advanced Trial Skills, Business Drafting, Real Estate Transactions, and Law Office Practice and Management.

Students must also take Professional Responsibility and the MPRE, an exam that is required to practice in addition to the bar exam.

Students are taught using the Socratic method, typical of law school pedagogy.

===The Lucille Stewart Beeson Law Library===
The library building is with 13 conference rooms, 474 study spaces, carrels equipped with electrical and data connections, and three computer labs.

The collection consists of approximately 300,000 volumes and microform volume equivalents. The library also offers electronic and audiovisual resources. There are seven full-time librarians, eight full-time support staff members, and four part-time support staff members.

===The Center for Biotechnology, Law, and Ethics===
The Center for Biotechnology, Law and Ethics focus is on the research and study of the ethical and legal issues arising from the biotechnology industry, which is important to the City of Birmingham. Each year the Center sponsors a major symposium which attracts nationally known experts.

The 2007 Symposium, entitled &quot;The United States Health-Care System: Access, Equity and Efficiency&quot;, focused on the issues of health care delivery in the United States, particularly to the poor, the problems that exist and potential solutions to those problems. The symposium brought together experts from the University of Minnesota, the Saint Louis University School of Law and Texas A &amp; M University and Cumberland.

The keynote address, which was also the Thurgood Marshall Lecture, was presented by United States Congressman Artur Davis, a leader on issues relating to the delivery of health care services.

Other research centers include the Center for Law &amp; Church, and the Alabama Center for Law and Civic Education 

==Admissions statistics==

For the Fall 2023 entering class, the school offered admission to 55.67% of applicants, with 38.14% of accepted students enrolling. The class consisted of 152 students with an average LSAT score of 155 and average GPA of 3.61. The top 75th percentile of the class has an LSAT score of 157 and 3.79 GPA, and the bottom 25th percentile has an LSAT score of 152 and 3.37 GPA. The entering group had 61 male students, 89 female, and two that did not report a sex. There were 37 students of color and 23 students identifying as African American.

==Rankings==
&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in its 2024 ranking places Cumberland tied at #103 in Best Law Schools out of 196 ABA accredited schools.

==Bar examination passage==
In 2023, the overall bar examination passage rate for the law school’s first-time examination takers was 78.36%. The Ultimate Bar Pass Rate, which the ABA defines as the passage rate for graduates who sat for bar examinations within two years of graduating, was 93.80% for the class of 2021.

== Employment ==
According to Samford&#x27;s official 2022 ABA-required disclosures, 80.7% of the Class of 2022 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation. The largest number of students were employed in law firms of 1 – 10 attorneys. Samford&#x27;s Law School Transparency under-employment score is 19.3%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2022 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation. 

==Costs==
The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at Samford for the 2022-2023 academic year is $65,900. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $238,529.

<text>The game of Go (; Old Chinese: &quot;*ɢʷəj grə&quot; &quot;surrounding game&quot;) originated in China in ancient times. It was considered one of the four essential arts of a cultured Chinese scholar in antiquity and is described as a worthy pastime for a gentleman in the &quot;Analects of Confucius&quot;. It reached Korea by the 5th century, in the 7th century it had reached Japan. The game was described by Matteo Ricci in 1615 and by Thomas Hyde in 1694, but it did not become popular in the West until the late 19th century.

According to legend, the game was created as a teaching tool after the ancient Chinese Emperor Yao designed it for his son, Danzhu , to learn discipline, concentration, and balance. Another suggested genesis for the game is that Chinese warlords and generals used pieces of stone to map attacking positions. Other plausible theories relate Go equipment to divination or flood control.

== Origin in China ==
Go&#x27;s early history is debated, but there are myths about its existence, one of which assuming that Go was an ancient fortune telling device used by Chinese astrologers to simulate the universe&#x27;s relationship to an individual. Another common origin story is that the mythical sage Emperor Yao invented the game to educate his son and cultivate proper virtue.

The earliest written reference of the game is usually taken to be the historical annal &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; (), referring to a historical event of 548 BCE. It is also mentioned in Book XVII of the &quot;Analects of Confucius&quot; and in two of the books of Mencius (). In all of these works, the game is referred to as (; Old Chinese: &quot;*ɢrak&quot;).

Chinese archaeologists have discovered a broken piece of a pottery go board from the Western Han dynasty (206 BCE – 24 CE) in Shaanxi Province. This is the earliest discovery of an existing board unearthed in China. The board was found in the ruins of a watchtower at the tombs of Emperor Jingdi and Empress Wang Zhi of the Western Han dynasty. The broken fragment of the board measures 5.7 cm to 28.5 cm long, 17 cm to 19.7 cm wide and 3.6 cm thick. Li Gang, a research fellow with the Shaanxi Provincial Archaeological Research Institute, said that this board might have been made from a floor tile, and that it did not belong to the royal family since the carvings are too rough. Li said the board could have been made by the tomb guards who played go to pass the time. &quot;That proves that go was being played not only by nobles, but also by ordinary people like tomb guards, more than 2,000 years ago&quot;, Li noted.

In 1954 a complete Go board made out of stone was found in a tomb dating to the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220) in Wangdu County, Hebei Province. This board has a 17 × 17 grid, which confirms the statement by the 3rd century author Handan Chun in the &quot;Classic of Arts&quot; that Go was at this time played on a 17 × 17 grid:
The go board has 17 lines along its length and breadth, making 289 points in all. The black and white stones each number 150.
The earliest board with a 19 × 19 grid to have been found is a ceramic board dating to the Sui dynasty (581–618) that was excavated from Anyang in Henan Province, so sometime between the 3rd and 6th centuries a change in grid size must have taken place. However, the 17 × 17 board has survived in the version of Go played in Tibet.

The first book dedicated to Go is the &quot;Dunhuang Go Manual&quot; ( CE), and was found in the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, and discusses the game as played on a 19 x 19 board. More books devoted to the game were written during the Tang and Song dynasties.

In ancient China, Go had an important status among elites and was associated with ideas of self-cultivation, wisdom, and gentlemanly ideals. According to Japanese historian Miyoshi, Go flourished in China from about 200 to 600 CE, when the interest in art and literature was at a high point. Go was one of the four cultivated arts of the Chinese scholar gentleman, along with calligraphy, painting and playing the musical instrument guqin, and examinations of skill in those arts was used to qualify candidates for service in the bureaucracy.

==Growth in east Asia==
Go is believed to have been introduced to Japan by Kibi no Makibi who had studied in Tang China at the beginning of the 8th century. But the Taihō Code, enacted in 701 CE, has a description of Go and therefore the game may have been introduced a little earlier. The approximate period can be confirmed by the Middle Chinese pronunciation &quot;*ɦʉi ɡɨ&quot;, which was loaned into Old Japanese as &quot;*wigə/wigo2&quot; (= man&#x27;yōgana 井碁), later becoming the modern Japanese mixed kan-on/go-on reading &quot;igo&quot;.

After it was introduced from China, Go came to be actively played during the Nara period (710–794 CE), and during the following Heian period (794–1185 CE) Go was a favourite aristocratic pastime, as is described in typical literary works of this period such as &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; and &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;.

During the Muromachi period (1336–1573), potentates employed semi-professional Go players, called Go-uchi () or Jouzu () who competed against other clans. At the end of the 16th century, Nikkai (Hon&#x27;inbō Sansa) served Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu as a Go teacher, and in 1578 was recognized as the first &quot;Meijin&quot; of Go by Oda Nobunaga; he also became the first Hon&#x27;inbō. Around this time, free opening of the game started; before, the game started from a set position of several stones on the board.

In 1612, at the beginning of the Edo period (1603–1868), the Tokugawa shogunate established Four hereditary &quot;houses&quot; to teach the game of Go: , , and . These four houses (&quot;iemoto&quot;) competed with each other throughout the 300 years of the Edo period. Professional matches between the four houses, as well as other high-profile players, were called &quot;oshirogo&quot; (&quot;castle Go&quot;), because they were held at castles of the shogun.

The wave of Westernization and modernization accompanying the Meiji Restoration in 1868 caused the dissolution of the official &quot;iemoto&quot; Go system and a wane in general popularity for the game. In the wake of this upheaval, the Hon&#x27;inbō title was transformed into a tournament title.

==Development in the West==

Despite its widespread popularity in East Asia, Go has been slow to spread to the rest of the world, unlike other games of ancient Asian origin, such as chess. Schädler speculates that chess has more widespread appeal because culturally congruent game pieces can be created in chess (e.g. Queen and Bishop in Western Chess, Advisor and Elephant in Chinese Chess), while Go is totally abstract. Also, there is no climactic ending in Go (such as checkmate in chess). New players often have trouble figuring out when a game of Go is over. Other theories center around the existence of fundamental differences in the level and type of thinking required by Go players as opposed to chess players. While pure analytical thought and the ability to plan many moves in advance are advantageous in chess, in Go a more intuitive approach based on pattern recognition and experience is stressed. A purely analytical approach, due to the sheer number of moves available for consideration, can be paralyzing.

The first detailed description of Go in a European language, &quot;De Circumveniendi Ludo Chinensium&quot; (&quot;About the Chinese encircling game&quot;), was written in Latin by Thomas Hyde, and included in his 1694 treatise on Oriental board games, &quot;De Ludis Orientalibus&quot; (&quot;About Oriental games&quot;), pp. 195–201; Oskar Korschelt, a German engineer, is credited with being the first person to try to popularize Go outside of East Asia. He learned about the game from Hon&#x27;inbō Shūho (Murase Shūho) when he worked in Japan from 1878 to 1886. Korschelt published a detailed article on Go in 1880. A few years later he published a book based on this article. He brought the game to Europe, especially to Germany and Austria, and thus became the first person to systematically describe Go in a Western language. Since he learned Go in Japan, the terms of Go in Western languages come from Japanese, and Westerners generally refer to the game by its Japanese name instead of its Chinese name .

By the early 20th century, Go had spread throughout the German and Austro-Hungarian empires. In 1905, Edward Lasker learned the game while in Berlin. When he moved to New York, Lasker founded the New York Go Club together with (amongst others) Arthur Smith, who had learned of the game while touring the East and had published the book &quot;The Game of Go&quot; in 1908. Lasker&#x27;s book &quot;Go and Go-moku&quot; (1934) helped spread the game throughout the US, and in 1935, the American Go Association was formed. Two years later, in 1937, the German Go Association was founded. World War II put a stop to most Go activity, but after the war, Go continued to spread.

Western players&#x27; interest increased in the 1950s. In 1978, Manfred Wimmer became the first Westerner to receive a professional player&#x27;s certificate from an East Asian professional Go association. It was not until 2000 that a Westerner, Michael Redmond, achieved a professional 9 dan rating, the top rank awarded by East Asian Go associations.

For most of the 20th century, the Japan Go Association played a leading role in spreading Go outside East Asia, publishing the English-language magazine &quot;Go Review&quot; in the 1960s, establishing Go centers in the US, Europe and South America, and often sending professional teachers on tour to Western nations.
By 2005, the European Go Federation had a total of 35 member countries.

In 1996, NASA astronaut Daniel Barry and Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata became the first people to play Go in space, they used a special Go set designed by Wai-Cheung Willson Chow. Both astronauts were awarded honorary dan ranks by the Nihon Kiin.

In 2016 Lee Sedol was defeated by the computer program &quot;AlphaGo&quot;.

==Trivia==
The first recorded game of Go in Europe was played in 1872 between Kido Takayoshi and Ōkubo Toshimichi. Both were vice ambassadors of the Iwakura Mission, which traveled to the United States and Europe between 1871 and 1873. Kido was an enthusiastic Go player, as can be seen from his diary (translated by Sidney DeVere Brown and Akiko Hirota as &quot;The Diary of Kido Takayoshi&quot;, Vol. I–III, Tokyo, The University of Tokyo Press, 1983–1986). During his journey, after arriving at Birmingham on 1 November 1872 and staying at the Queen&#x27;s Hotel in Room No. 10, Kido notes two days later in his diary (Vol. II, p. 243):

3 November 1872 [Meiji 5/10/3] Fair, then rain. I stayed in my room all day to recuperate from my illness, and had a special diet. I played &quot;go&quot; with Ōkubo. (Note) Sunday.

<text>Santa Ana County was one of the seven original partidos created in New Mexico under Mexican rule. Under U.S. rule, it became a U.S. Territorial county from 1852 until 1876, when it was absorbed by Bernalillo County. It does not exist today as an administrative unit. The original county seat of Santa Ana County is what is now Fort Defiance, Arizona. The county was named after the Pueblo of Santa Ana.

The area enclosed by the original Santa Ana County was in Judicial District No. 1 from 1847 to 1863, then in JD 2 until 1876, when it was absorbed by Bernalillo County.

<text>Edward Hallowell (1808 – February 20, 1860) was an American herpetologist and physician.

He studied and practiced medicine in Philadelphia. He also was a renowned herpetologist who described 61 new species of reptiles.

In 1851, Hallowell was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

Hallowell is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of frogs: &quot;Hyla hallowellii&quot; and &quot;Leptodactylus hallowelli.

<text>Jean de Gisors (c. 1133–1220) was a Norman lord of the fortress of Gisors in Normandy, where meetings were traditionally convened between English and French kings. It was here, in 1188, a squabble occurred that involved the cutting of an elm.

Initially he was a vassal of the king of England - Henry II and then Richard I. During this time he also owned property in Sussex and the manor of Titchfield in Hampshire in England. 

Some time between 1170 and 1180 he purchased the manor of Buckland, Hampshire from the de Port family. On this newly purchased land he founded the town of Portsmouth as one end of a trade route between England and France. The original settlement of Portsmouth was a planned town on a medieval grid pattern, of which other examples can be found in places like Salisbury. Much of this original grid pattern is still visible in the Old Portsmouth district of Portsmouth. 

One of the first acts ordered by de Gisors in Portsmouth was the donation of land to the Augustinian canons of Southwick Priory so that they could build a chapel &quot;to the glorious honour of the martyr Thomas of Canterbury, one time Archbishop, on (my) land which is called Sudewede, the island of Portsea&quot;, Thomas Becket having spent much time in Gisors. This foundation of the Church of St Thomas of Canterbury was to eventually become Portsmouth Cathedral.

However the royal patronage of de Gisors was not to last, as after his support for an unsuccessful rebellion in Normandy in 1194 he paid the price by forfeiting all his lands, including Portsmouth, to Richard I.

==In popular culture==
In conspiracy theories, such as the one promoted in &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot;, Jean de Gisors has been alleged to be the first Grand Master of the Priory of Sion (1188–1220).

<doc id="638594" wikidata="Q7048848" url="?curid=638594" title="Non-belligerent">
<text>A non-belligerent is a person, a state, or other organization that does not fight in a given conflict. The term is often used to describe a country that does not take part militarily in a war.

A non-belligerent state differs from a neutral one in that it may support certain belligerents in a war but is not directly involved in military operations.
The term may also be used to describe a person not involved in combat or aggression, especially if combat or aggression is likely. In a situation of civil unrest such as a riot, civilians may be divided into belligerents, those actually fighting or intending to fight, and non-belligerents who are merely bystanders.

==Examples==
===Spain===
During World War II, Spain allowed and promoted the Spanish Blue Division of volunteers and conscripts to join the German forces on the condition that they would fight against the Soviet Union only and they would do it with German equipment and uniforms. At the same time, allied aircraft made emergency landings in Spanish territories (Melilla, Mallorca) and the Spanish government returned the crews home safely. The aircraft were either scrapped due to poor condition or repaired and allocated in the Spanish Air Force if not reclaimed, or after a negotiated purchase.

===United States===
A notable example of a non-belligerent in an environment of total war was the United States&#x27; military support of the Allies in World War II, prior to their entry into the war following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The military support given by the Americans was through the Destroyers-for-bases deal in which the United States provide the United Kingdom &quot;all possible assistance short of war&quot; in the words of Winston Churchill.

===Italy===
From September 1939 to June 1940, when it joined the war with Germany, Italy was a non-belligerent.

===Ireland===
Although officially Ireland declared itself neutral in World War II, it can be disputed whether it was a non-belligerent or not, as The Cranborne Report drew up by the Viscount Cranborne to the British War Cabinet noted regarding Irish-British collaboration. An example of such collaboration was the permission for Allied use of Irish airspace for military means.

===Sweden===
While Sweden did not officially fight in the Winter War, a new Flying regiment was formed out of volunteers to aid Finland and took charge of defending Finnish Lapland; the aircraft for the regiment came directly from Swedish Air Force inventory.

=== Japan ===
The Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan denies the right of belligerence of states, in order to accomplish &quot;international peace based on justice and order&quot;.

=== United Kingdom ===
The United Kingdom&#x27;s government showed support for the United States in the Vietnam War, but the country did not send troops to fight in the war.

=== NATO ===
During the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, the NATO states provide military equipment and economic support to Ukraine.

=== Others ===
Along with the US, the political stance of Peru during the Falklands War and that of the Netherlands during the 2003 invasion of Iraq was described by politicians as &quot;political support, but no military support&quot;.

<doc id="638599" wikidata="Q1566138" url="?curid=638599" title="University of Tennessee at Martin">
<text>The University of Tennessee at Martin (UT Martin or UTM) is a public university in Martin, Tennessee. It is one of the five campuses of the University of Tennessee system. UTM is the only public university in West Tennessee outside of Memphis.

UTM operates a large experimental farm and several satellite centers in West Tennessee.

==History==
Although UT Martin dates from 1927, it is not the first educational institution to use the current site. In 1900, Ada Gardner Brooks donated a site on what was then the outskirts of Martin to the Tennessee Baptist Convention for the purposes of opening a school. The school opened as the Hall-Moody Institute, named for two locally prominent Baptist ministers - John Newton Hall and Joseph Burnley Moody. It originally offered 13 years of study, from elementary grades to the equivalent of the first years of collegiate work. The institute changed its name to Hall-Moody Normal School in 1917, as teacher training became its primary focus. Five years later, Hall-Moody changed its name again to Hall-Moody Junior College. Due to declining enrollment and financial difficulties in the mid-1920s, Hall-Moody Junior College was in danger of closing. In 1927, the Tennessee Baptist Convention made the decision to consolidate Hall-Moody with a similar institution, Union University, in nearby Jackson.

Upon hearing of the impending closure of the Hall-Moody campus, area civic and political leaders asked the state of Tennessee to step in and take over the former Hall-Moody facilities under the auspices of the University of Tennessee. University of Tennessee president Harcourt Morgan agreed to accept the proposition on the condition that the Martin community would acquire the property as well as space for expansion. The City of Martin and Weakley County sold bonds to purchase the campus and some surrounding land. On February 10, 1927, Senate Bill Number 301 established the University of Tennessee Junior College in Martin. On March 29, it was officially approved by Governor Austin Peay. Hall-Moody closed for the last time on June 1, and the new UT Junior College began operations on September 2 with 120 students.

UT Martin nearly closed twice during its first quarter-century. During the hard times of the Great Depression, with tight state budgets and slow-growing enrollment that by 1933 had only increased slightly to 137 students, Tennessee slashed its annual budget by half to $36,000. Support from UT acting president James Hoskins kept UT Martin alive but could not save chief executive Porter Claxton&#x27;s position.

Though enrollment had surpassed 400 students by 1937, many college-age males enlisted in World War II a few years later. Executive officer Paul Meek repurposed a 1940 program training Army Air Corps pilots into a program training naval air cadets. Each cadet brought nine times as much income to UT Martin as a civilian student.

A post-war influx of returning servicemen and the G.I. Bill ushered in rapid growth both in enrollment and educational offerings. In 1951, with the addition of four-year fields of study leading to a bachelor&#x27;s degree, it was redesignated the University of Tennessee Martin Branch (UTMB).

In 1961, UTMB was the first campus in the University of Tennessee system to begin racial desegregation of undergraduates. (Graduate schools at other campuses had begun desegregation in 1952.)

Until 1967, it was treated as an off-site department of the main campus in Knoxville. As such, its presiding officer was known first as an executive officer (1927–1951), then a dean (1951–1967). In 1967, it was granted equal status with the main campus in Knoxville under its current name, and its presiding officer was granted the title of chancellor. The school grew greatly from the post-World War II era, largely under the influence of the G. I. Bill of Rights, through the 1960s under the leadership of Paul Meek, who led the school from 1934 to 1967. The school had almost as many entering freshmen in 1969 as it had overall students in 1961. Enrollment as of 2017 is listed at approximately 6,800.

==Academics==
Given its rural location, much of the focus of the school has been on undergraduate studies in education and agriculture, although many other courses of study are offered, particularly in the liberal arts, and in recent years there has been an increasing emphasis on business, engineering, and music. There is an active ROTC program and a school of nursing. The school is among the top providers of candidates to the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis. There is a growing graduate school, with most graduate degrees being conferred in education and business.

The university is regionally accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. For one year, from December 2015 until December 2016, the university was on probation for &quot;falling short of standards related to evidence of institutional effectiveness and general education competencies.&quot; During the tenure of Dr. Robert Smith, UT Martin successfully met the challenge and was removed from probation. For this and other accomplishments during his 19 months as interim chancellor, the UT Board of Trustees honored Dr. Smith by removing the designation &quot;interim&quot; and officially named him the university&#x27;s tenth chancellor. He was also granted the honorary title &quot;chancellor emeritus.&quot;

&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in its 2024 edition ranked the university tied for #27 in Regional Universities South.

===Colleges and departments===
* College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences
* College of Business and Global Affairs

===Rankings===
==Campus==
The rural campus is noted for being particularly scenic and well-landscaped. Students who live on campus are within walking distance of all academic buildings, the library, food services, the Boling University Center, and all recreational and sports facilities. Recent years have seen the demolition of old double-occupancy dormitory halls in favor of the construction of apartment-style housing.

UT Martin is one of the most environmentally responsible colleges in the United States and Canada, according to the second annual edition of &quot;The Princeton Review&#x27;s Guide to 311 Green Colleges: 2011 Edition.&quot; UT Martin is one of three public institutions in Tennessee included in the guide. UT Martin is also among the safest public college campuses in Tennessee based on crime statistics released by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.

UT Martin also has five centers throughout West Tennessee.
* Jackson
* Parsons
* Ripley
* Selmer
* Somerville

==Athletics==

The UT Martin athletic program is a member of the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) and competes in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision.

The school&#x27;s teams are known as the Skyhawks; the team colors are navy blue, orange, and white; and the mascot is Captain Skyhawk.

Athletic teams have participated in the Ohio Valley Conference since 1991. Previously, UTM was a member of the Gulf South Conference.

The university mascot was changed from &quot;Pacers&quot; to &quot;Skyhawks&quot; in 1995. The reasoning behind the &quot;Skyhawks&quot; moniker was described thus:
* The first educational institution on the site of UT Martin was Hall-Moody Bible Institute. The school&#x27;s athletic teams were called &quot;sky pilots&quot;, a frontier term for preachers in that day, but perhaps the students were thinking of the glamorous flying aces of World War I.
* During World War II, UT Junior College contracted with the Naval War Training Service to help train pilots, who completed their flight training at an airport located on the current site of Westview High School.
* Red-tail hawks are indigenous to the West Tennessee region.

Prior to being known as &quot;Pacers&quot;, the university&#x27;s teams were called &quot;Volunteers&quot;. The name was changed in 1971, largely because, on account of the former junior college status of the school, the teams were often referred to as the &quot;Baby Vols&quot;.

==Publications and media==

===Print===

Founded in 1928, &quot;The Pacer&quot; is the present day name of the student newspaper. The Office of Student Publications publishes &quot;The Pacer&quot; every Thursday morning throughout the semester except for holidays and exam periods. As of 2006, the newspaper has a circulation of 3,000 copies. In the spring of 2006, the publication won the distinction of being named &quot;Best in the South&quot; at the Southeastern Journalism Conference, beating out such schools as Vanderbilt and Mississippi State. Throughout its history, the newspaper has also been named &quot;The Checkerboard&quot; and &quot;The Volette&quot;.

&quot;Beanswitch&quot; is a literary magazine run by UT Martin&#x27;s undergraduates. This magazine publishes non-fiction, fiction, and poetry, in addition to artwork. Each fall, an online edition is published. The spring edition is in print. Submissions are accepted from all students and from staff.

===Radio===
The campus radio station at the University of Tennessee at Martin has been named the nation&#x27;s Best Overall Radio Station (2012). The honor—the Abraham &amp; Borst Award—was presented to WUTM at the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System Conference in New York. WUTM was also chosen Best College/University Station under 10,000 enrollment in both 2012 and 2016.

WUTM-FM was named 2015 &quot;Best College Radio Station in the South&quot;, the fifth time in seven years for the station to earn the award and earned a Platinum Award, the highest ranking, for the sixth consecutive year from the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS).

===Television===
WLJT-TV was launched in the fall of 2015.

==Student life==
The campus is home to many student life organizations. It also is the location of the 1965 founding of the medical fraternity Mu Epsilon Delta. The Panhellenic sororities at UTM are Alpha Delta Pi (ΑΔΠ), Alpha Omicron Pi (ΑΟΠ), Zeta Tau Alpha (ZTA), and Chi Omega (ΧΩ). The IFC fraternities on campus are Alpha Gamma Rho (ΑΓΡ), Kappa Alpha Order (KA), Phi Sigma Kappa (ΦΣΚ), Pi Kappa Alpha (ΠΚΑ), Sigma Alpha Epsilon (ΣΑΕ), Sigma Phi Epsilon (ΣΦΕ), and Sigma Chi (ΣΧ). There are two music organizations on campus: Phi Mu Alpha (ΦΜΑ) and Sigma Alpha Iota (ΣΑΙ). Religious Life is also a part of student life at UT Martin: Baptist Collegiate Ministry, Church of Christ Student Center, and Wesley Foundation.

<text>The Dodge Charger is a model of automobile marketed by Dodge in various forms over eight generations since 1966.

The first Charger was a show car in 1964. A 1965 Charger II concept car resembled the 1966 production version.

In the United States, the Charger nameplate has been used on mid-size cars, personal luxury coupes, subcompact hatchbacks, and full-size sedans.

==Background==
The 1966 Charger was an effort by Dodge to produce an upscale, upsized pony car. American Motors Corporation (AMC) had already introduced a very similar vehicle in 1965, the Rambler Marlin, which was positioned as a personal car, an emerging market niche.

Demand for larger specialty cars was rapidly increasing. Mercury was successful in its execution when it introduced the upscale Cougar, a larger and more refined version of the Ford Mustang that pioneered the pony car concept when it was introduced in 1964. General Motors was fielding specialty models across all its nameplates.

The first generation Charger included high-trim and comfort features positioned as a luxurious fastback hardtop. It was aimed at the segment that included the Oldsmobile Toronado and Ford Thunderbird rather than as a muscle car.

==First generation: 1966–1967==


The Charger was introduced mid-1966 model year. Derived from the Chrysler B-body intermediate-sized Dodge Coronet, it shared major components like the chassis and much of the two-door Coronet&#x27;s front body with a fastback roofline following the pattern set by AMC&#x27;s 1965 Marlin. Similar to the positioning of the Marlin, the Charger was a more substantial car focused on more mature buyers because &quot;Pony cars, the implication ran, were for kids.&quot;

The fastback styling was popular with Corvette and Mustang buyers. The Charger&#x27;s interior featured four bucket seats with a center console that went to the back seats and had &quot;race-inspired&quot; instrument gauges. The front fascia introduced hidden headlights behind a full-width grille and a &quot;wall-to-wall&quot; taillamp design. The base engine was a V8 with a three-speed manual transmission, while automatic and floor-mounted manual transmissions were optional. Larger and more powerful engines were available up to the Hemi V8.

Positioned as a sports-type luxury model, sales of the 1966 and 1967 Chargers were low. The cars&#x27; front and rear overhang made the fastback design look tall, especially given its relatively narrow track dimensions (the distance between the centerline of two wheels on the same axle). Adapting a pony car-sized fastback roofline to intermediate-sized cars was not attractive &quot;with pundits pointing to the similar fate of AMC&#x27;s Marlin to support the theory.&quot;

==Second generation: 1968–1970==

The Charger was redesigned for 1968, and 35,000 units were slated for production. The demand was high, and 96,100 Chargers were produced.

Based on the Chrysler B platform, the 1968 through 1970 model years had cosmetic changes to the exterior and interior. These included going from twin round tail lights to broad horizontal units and adding a horizontal trim to the grille. The powertrains were carried over from 1967, with the slant-6 available in mid-1968.

The 1968 Charger was unsuccessful in stock car racing, such as NASCAR. A more aerodynamic shape formed the Charger 500 model, later followed by the 1969 Charger Daytona. The 1970 Charger did win the most NASCAR races in 1970, helping Bobby Isaac win the championship that year.

&quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; television series made the second-generation Dodge Chargers familiar to the American public.
== Third generation: 1971–1974 ==


The third generation Charger was introduced for the 1971 model year. Chrysler&#x27;s B platform was modified to meet new emissions and safety regulations. Available in six different packages with cosmetic changes, including a split grill, semi-fastback rear window, and a ducktail spoiler.

The 1973 and 1974 Chargers were similar to the 1971s, with minor differences in the grille and headlamps. The 1973 and 1974 Chargers also featured new quarter windows, which were larger and shaped differently than the quarter windows seen on the 1971 and 1972 models.

The increase in sales was primarily due to the elimination of the Dodge Coronet two-door, which meant Dodge offered the two-door intermediate-size body style only as the Charger (although the Coronet two-door would reappear in 1975).

The name Charger was also used in Brazil as a performance model based on the Dart (A-Body) (1971–80).
==Fourth generation: 1975–1978==
The 1975 model year Charger continued as a B-body car and was restyled in an effort by Dodge to move the model into the growing personal luxury car market segment.

In 1978, Dodge added the Magnum to that segment. A Daytona model fourth-generation Charger featured stripes that ran along the length of the car.
==Fifth generation: 1981–1987==

The Charger returned in 1981 as a front-wheel drive subcompact hatchback coupe with a five-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission. This economy-type model was similar to the Dodge Omni 024, but slightly larger. The Charger was available with a 2.2 L SOHC engine or a turbocharged 2.2 L SOHC. Unlike in the Dodge Daytona, the turbo was available only with the manual transmission.

A Shelby Charger was marketed starting in 1983, with a turbo version available in 1984 producing @ 5600 rpm and of torque @ 3200 rpm. The engine was not intercooled, and used a small t3 Garrett turbo. In 1985, the electronics were updated allowing for an increase in boost pressure. As a result, output increased to 146 hp. In 1987 the intercooler-equipped 2.2L Turbo II engine was included with the Shelby-built Charger GLHS, these were the last 1000 L-body Chargers built and power was again bumped, this time to 175 hp and 175 lb.ft. of torque by way of the aforementioned intercooler as well as a two-piece intake manifold, larger injectors and throttle body, and Shelby-tuned ECM.
==Sixth generation: 2006–2010 (LX)==


After a twenty-year absence, Dodge reintroduced the Charger in 2005 for the 2006 model year as a Chrysler LX platform-based four-door sedan. Although the 1999 Charger concept car featured four doors, it shared little else with the 2006 production model.

Initially, the Charger was available in SE, SXT, R/T, R/T with Road/Track Performance Group, Police, and Daytona R/T versions. A V6 engine was available for the first time, as was all-wheel drive (AWD). All-wheel drive was first only available on the R/T package. However, from 2009 onwards, all-wheel drive was also an option for the SE and SXT versions.

The basic SE model included a 2.7 L V6 engine and a four-speed automatic transmission. The 3.5 L V6 included an &quot;AutoStick&quot; manual shifting feature, wheels, air conditioning, all-speed traction control, as well as ABS and electronic stability control, a CD player, tilt and telescoping steering column, power locks/mirrors/windows, and remote keyless entry. Additional features and trims were available, including the Charger R/T with a 5.7 L Hemi V8 mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. A multiple-displacement system that allowed it to save fuel by running on only four cylinders when cruising was also featured in the V8.

Performance was the focus of the Charger SRT8 equipped with a 6.1 L Hemi engine mated to a five-speed automatic, as well as conveniences such as an eight-way power front passenger seat, automatic climate control, unique grille and rear spoiler, body-color interior trim, special front fascia and engine cover, larger exhaust tips, performance steering gear, heated front seats with perforated suede inserts, power-adjustable pedals, and unique colors and exterior trim. An optional Road/Track package offered ten additional horsepower, a GPS navigation system, a 322-watt audio system, a sunroof, and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system and radio.
==Seventh generation: 2011–2023 (LD)==

The Charger received an improved interior and new exterior styling for 2011. This included new side scoops along both front and rear doors, more angular headlights, aggressive new grille styling, and a more defined and aerodynamic shape overall. Most notably, the back end adopted a more modern wrap-around LED tail light spanning nearly the entire trunk width. Driver visibility was improved by more than 15%, addressing complaints from previous years. The side and rear styling cues are reminiscent of the 1968 through 1970 models.

Base performance was increased, with the 3.5 L V6 engine replaced with a Pentastar 3.6 L producing @ 6350 rpm and of torque @ 4800 rpm. The 4-speed automatic transmission was replaced with the 5-speed A580 auto.

The SRT-8 was not produced for the 2011 model year.

The 2012 year featured a new eight-speed automatic transmission to the V6 model. The SRT-8 returned to the model lineup. AWD was also added to the V6, making AWD available on all but the SRT-8 model. 

For the 2012 through 2018 model years, the Super Bee platform (later called Scat Pack 15+) was available, using features seen in regular SRT-8 models with accessories and badges reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s muscle car. These included a 6.4 L engine rated at and had four-piston Brembo calipers, slotted rotors, paddle shifters, SRT launch features - such as 0-60 timing, Live G-Force readings, and and drag timers, custom seat embroidery, and other features.

The 2014 Pursuit model no longer included chrome exhaust tip extensions, as they often scraped during maneuvers over medians.

For 2015, the Charger received significant exterior styling updates. Most notably, the new front end featured new LED lights and a more aerodynamic nose that was less angled and featured a noticeable curve around the headlight housing. Suspensions, interiors, and brakes were also redesigned.

The 2017 model had an upgrade to the navigation/display system and was restyled due to issues with the previous system.

Except for Charger Pursuit (through 2020), all models came standard with the eight-speed automatic transmission. In December 2014, the AWD Charger Pursuit appeared, and the V8 R/T AWD model disappeared. Sales of the AWD Pursuit increased.

For 2020, the Charger Hellcat comes standard with the &quot;widebody&quot; to accommodate an improved tire/suspension package. Dodge also added a new trim for 2020 called the SRT Hellcat Redeye. The Hellcat Redeye comes standard with the V8 engine. The 2020 Charger Pursuit was only available in the RWD V6 and AWD V8 models. Beginning in 2021, the roles reversed, with the V6 Pursuit now equipped with AWD and the 850RE 8-spd auto. The V8 Pursuit was RWD with the 8HP70. In 2022, several police models were dropped, including the V8-RWD Charger Pursuit, the V6-AWD Durango Pursuit, and both Durango SSV models. That leaves police with the V6-AWD Charger and V8-AWD Durango Pursuit models, and 4×4 1500/2500/3500 Ram SSV models, through 2023.

In 2022, the Street and Racing Technology team produced the &quot;Jailbreak Edition&quot;, based on the 2020 Hellcat Redeye Widebody. SRT added ten extra horsepower from the stock Hellcat Redeye, which totals 807. The idea behind it was for the user to be able to customize the Charger through the factory as if there was a &quot;Jailbreak&quot;. The interior offers different options for the floor mats, the color of the leather seats, logos, sound system, and headliner. The exterior of the Charger has the options to add racing stripes to differ from the Challenger. Users have the option of changing the color of the car, brake calipers, wheels, badges, exhaust tips, and an option of adding the SRT spoiler.

In January 2022, Dodge announced that the Hemi V8 Charger (5.7L, 6.4L, and 6.2L) would be retired at the end of the 2023 model year.

==Eighth generation: 2024–present (LB)==


The Charger Daytona SRT Banshee is a coupe that was introduced as a concept in August 2022. Now in production Dodge will offer two models to begin with as 2024 model years, the Charger Daytona R/T and Dodge Charger Daytona Scat Pack, both as EV&#x27;s. Later will come the 4- door versions of the cars and an ICE version using the 3.0 litre Hurricane I-6. According to Dodge, the EV&#x27;s will go on sale in Q4 2024.

On January 12, 2024, Dodge posted photos of the eighth-generation Charger to their Instagram. It was captioned &quot;No cameras or recording devices permitted.&quot; The pre-production version was shown with 2025 models to be available in late 2024. It will be available with the company&#x27;s 3.0 liter &quot;Hurricane&quot; twin-turbo inline-six and electric variants.

The eighth-generation Charger was unveiled on March 5, 2024.

<text>Guillaume de Gisors (1219–1307) was a Norman lord and knight. He was the son of Hugues III de Gisors and grandson of Jean de Gisors.

== Life ==
A 1256 document identifies him as the Lord of Gisors. He had fiefdom over Meulan. He received fief from Matthew II of Montmorency.

He presented a candidate for the cure of Saint-Éloi-près-Bézu to Eudes Rigaud, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Rouen.

In conspiracy theories, such as the one promoted in &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot;, Guillaume de Gisors is alleged to have been a Grand Master of the Priory of Sion.

<doc id="638628" wikidata="Q220271" url="?curid=638628" title="South American tapir">
<text>The South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), also commonly called the Brazilian tapir (from the Tupi ), the Amazonian tapir, the maned tapir, the lowland tapir, (Brazilian Portuguese), and la sachavaca (literally &quot;bushcow&quot;, in mixed Quechua and Spanish), is one of the four recognized species in the tapir family (of the order Perissodactyla, with the mountain tapir, the Malayan tapir, and the Baird&#x27;s tapir). It is the largest surviving native terrestrial mammal in the Amazon.

Most classification taxons also include Tapirus kabomani (also known as the little black tapir or kabomani tapir) as also belonging to the species &quot;Tapirus terrestris&quot; (Brazilian tapir), despite its questionable existence and the overall lack of information on its habits and distribution. The specific epithet derives from &quot;arabo kabomani&quot;, the word for tapir in the local Paumarí language. The formal description of this tapir did not suggest a common name for the species. The Karitiana people call it the &quot;little black tapir&quot;. It is, purportedly, the smallest tapir species, even smaller than the mountain tapir (&quot;T. pinchaque&quot;), which had been considered the smallest. &quot;T. kabomani&quot; is allegedly also found in the Amazon rainforest, where it appears to be sympatric with the well-known South American tapir (&quot;T. terrestris&quot;). When it was described in December of 2013, &quot;T. kabomani&quot; was the first odd-toed ungulate discovered in over 100 years. However, &quot;T. kabomani&quot; has not been officially recognized by the Tapir Specialist Group as a distinct species; recent genetic evidence further suggests it is likely a subspecies of &quot;T. terrestris.&quot;

==Appearance==
&quot;T. terrestris&quot; is dark brown, paler in the face, and has a low, erect crest running from the crown down the back of the neck. The round, dark ears have distinctive white edges. Newborn tapirs have a dark brown coat, with small white spots and stripes along the body. The South American tapir can attain a body length of with a short stubby tail and an average weight around . Adult weight has been reported ranging from . It stands somewhere between at the shoulder.
===Features claimed for &quot;Tapirus kabomani&quot;===
With an estimated mass of only , &quot;T. kabomani&quot; is the smallest living tapir. For comparison, the mountain tapir has a mass between . &quot;Tapirus kabomani&quot; is roughly long and in shoulder height.

It has a distinct phenotype from other members of the species. It can be differentiated by its coloration: it is a range of darker grey to brown than other &quot;T. terrestris&quot; strains. This species also features relatively short legs for a tapir caused by a femur length that is shorter than dentary length. The crest is smaller and less prominent. &quot;T. kabomani&quot; also seems to exhibit some level of sexual dimorphism as females tend to be larger than males and possess a characteristic patch of light hair on their throats. The patch extends from the chin up to the ear and down to the base of the neck.

Head and skull attributes are also important in identification of this species. This tapir possesses a single, narrow, low and gently inclined sagittal crest that rises posteriorly from the toothrow. &quot;T. kabomani&quot; skulls also lack both a nasal septum and dorsal maxillary flanges. The skull possesses a meatal diverticulum fossa that is shallower and less dorsally extended than those of the other four extant species of tapir.

==Geographic range==
The South American tapir can be found near water in the Amazon Rainforest and River Basin in South America, east of the Andes. Its geographic range stretches from Venezuela, Colombia, and the Guianas in the north to Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay in the south, to Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador in the west. On rare occasions, waifs have crossed the narrow sea channel from Venezuela to the southern coast of the island of Trinidad (but no breeding population exists there).

&quot;Tapirus kabomani&quot; is restricted to South America. It is found in habitats consisting of a mosaic of forest and savannah. It has been collected in southern Amazonas (the type locality), Rondônia, and Mato Grosso states in Brazil. The species is also believed to be present in Amazonas department in Colombia, and it may be present in Amapá, Brazil, in north Bolivia and in southern French Guiana.

In 2024, the South American tapir was observed in the state of Rio de Janeiro for the first time since 1914. According to Marcelo Cupello, a scientist from Rio de Jaineiro&#x27;s State Environmental Institution, the return of the species indicates that the state&#x27;s forests are once again capable of sustaining populations of large mammals.

==Behavior==

&quot;T. terrestris&quot; is an excellent swimmer and diver, but also moves quickly on land, even over rugged, mountainous terrain. It has a life span of approximately 25 to 30 years. In the wild, its main predators are crocodilians (only the black caiman and Orinoco crocodile, the latter of which is critically endangered, are large enough to take these tapirs, as the American crocodile only exists in the northern part of South America) and large cats, such as the jaguar and cougar, which often attack tapirs at night when tapirs leave the water and sleep on the riverbank. The South American tapir is also attacked by the green anaconda (&quot;Eunectes murinus&quot;). 

Although they may flee into the bush or into water when threatened, lowland tapirs are capable of defending themselves with their very powerful bite; in 2005, a 55 year old farmer stabbed a 400 lb female lowland tapir that was feeding in his cornfield, which responded by repeatedly biting the man. Both died from their wounds.

There is a need for more research to better explore social interactions.

==Diet==

The South American tapir is an herbivore. Using its mobile nose, it feeds on leaves, buds, shoots, and small branches it tears from trees, fruit, grasses, and aquatic plants. They also feed on the vast majority of seeds found in the rainforest. This is known because the diet is studied through observation of browsing, analysis of feces, and studying stomach contents.

Although it has been determined via fecal samples that &quot;T. kabomani&quot; feeds on palm tree leaves and seeds from the genera &quot;Attalea&quot; and &quot;Astrocaryum&quot;, much about the diet and ecology of &quot;T. kabomani&quot; is unknown. Previously discovered tapirs are known to be important seed dispersers and to play key roles in the rainforest or mountain ecosystems in which they occur. It is possible that &quot;T. kabomani&quot; shares this role with the other members of its genus although further research is required.

==Mating==

&quot;T. terrestris&quot; mates in April, May, or June, reaching sexual maturity in the third year of life. Females go through a gestation period of 13 months (390–395 days) and will typically have one offspring every two years. A newborn South American tapir weighs about 15 pounds (6.8 kilos) and will be weaned in about six months.

==Endangered status==
The dwindling numbers of the South American tapir are due to poaching for meat and hide, as well as habitat destruction.
&quot;T. terrestris&quot; is generally recognized as an endangered animal species, with the species being designated as endangered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on June 2, 1970. It has a significantly lower risk of extinction, though, than the other four tapir species.

=== Conservation of &quot;T. kabomani&quot; ===
The species may be relatively common in forest-savanna mosaic habitat (relicts of former cerrado). Nevertheless, the species is threatened by prospects of future habitat loss related to deforestation, development and expanding human populations.

While this tapir does not seem to be rare in the upper Madeira River region of the southwestern Brazilian Amazon, its precise conservation status is unknown. &quot;T. kabomani&quot; is limited by its habitat preference and tends not to be found where its preferred mosaic gives way to either pure savannah or forest. This, in combination with the fact that other less restricted tapir species within the area are already classified as endangered, has led scientists to hypothesize that the new species is likely to prove more endangered than other members of its genus. Human population growth and deforestation within southwestern Amazonia threaten &quot;T. kabomani&quot; through habitat destruction. The creation of infrastructure such as roads as well as two dams planned for the area as of December 2013 further threaten to considerably alter the home range. Hunting is also a concern. The Karitiana tribe, a group of people indigenous to the area, regularly hunt the tapir. Additional threats exist from crocodilians and jaguars, natural predators of tapirs within the area.

Humans aside, the region of the Amazon in which &quot;T. kabomani&quot; is found has also been highlighted as an area that is likely to be particularly susceptible to global warming and the ecosystem changes it brings.

==History of classification==
Although it was not formally described until 2013, the possibility that &quot;T. kabomani&quot; might be a distinct species had been suggested as early as 100 years prior. The first specimen recognized as a member of this species was collected on the Roosevelt–Rondon Scientific Expedition. Theodore Roosevelt (1914) believed they had collected a new species, as local hunters recognized two types of tapir in the region and another member of the expedition, Leo E. Miller, suggested that two species were present. Nevertheless, though observed by experts, all tapirs from the expedition have been consistently treated as &quot;T. terrestris&quot;, including specimen AMNH 36661, which is now identified as &quot;T. kabomani&quot;. Ten years before &quot;T. kabomani&quot; was formally described, scientists suspected the existence of a new species while examining skulls that did not resemble the skulls of known tapir species. When the species was formally described in December 2013, it was the first tapir species described since &quot;T. bairdii&quot; in 1865.

===Relationships===
In both morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses, &quot;T. kabomani&quot; was recovered as the first diverging of the three tapirs restricted to South America. Morphological analysis suggested that the closest relative of &quot;T. kabomani&quot; may be the extinct species &quot;T. rondoniensis&quot;. Molecular dating methods based on three mitochondrial cytochrome genes gave an approximate divergence time of 0.5 Ma for &quot;T. kabomani&quot; and the &quot;T. terrestris&quot;–&quot;T. pinchaque&quot; clade, while &quot;T. pinchaque&quot; was found to have arisen within a paraphyletic &quot;T. terrestris&quot; complex much more recently (in comparison, the split between &quot;T. bairdii&quot; and the tapirs restricted to South America took place around 5 &quot;Ma ago).

===Controversy===
The validity of the species, and whether or not it can be reliably distinguished from the South American tapir, has subsequently been questioned on both morphological and genetic grounds. Morphological differences between the two species of tapir are noted to be especially difficult to discern in photographs allegedly depicting &quot;T. kabomani&quot; and noted to be only qualitatively described in the original literature. Morphologically, lack of published numerical ranges for diagnostic differences make it incredibly difficult for individuals to be identified in the field as little black tapirs instead of South American tapirs. A heavy reliance upon the indigenous people for identification of &quot;T. kabomani&quot; was also noted in the major dissenting article. Concerns were cited regarding the reliability of information when it is gathered from locals as, while they are frequently aware of many more species in an area, they can sometimes describe haplotypes of culturally important species to be entirely different species.

Genetic evidence has been questioned on similar grounds. Several examined genetic sequences said to be characteristic for the species, most notably the &quot;Cyth&quot; sequence of cytochrome b, have been described as minimally divergent from those of other South American tapirs. Further analyses of cytochrome b sequences did reveal a clade allegedly belonging to &quot;T. kabomani&quot;, however, it was described to be only as divergent as some haplotype found in other species. Mitochondrial DNA originally connected to morphological traits and used to describe the species has also been called into question. Although several samples of &quot;T. kabomani&quot; have been obtained, only the two samples from southwestern Amazonia were analysed while those obtained in the northwest were not. The connection between the morphology and DNA of supposed &quot;T. kabomani&quot; in northwestern areas is unknown and there is the possibility that the correlation between mtDNA and morphology is insufficiently supported.

However, besides cytochrome b, two other mitochondrial genes were analyzed, COI and COII, both showing the same pattern found for cytochrome b. Several other objections raised against the distinction of &quot;T. kabomani&quot; from &quot;T. terrestris&quot;, including external and internal morphological characters, statistical analysis, distribution and use of folk taxonomy, were addressed in Cozzuol et al (2014).

Further genetic evidence invalidating &quot;T. kabomani&quot; as a new species was published by Ruiz-Garcia et al. (2016). Ruiz-Garcia et al. found and sampled tapirs that fit the morphological description provided by Cozzuol et al. (2013) for &quot;T. kabomani&quot; but they only showed haplotypes of other &quot;T. terrestris&quot; haplogroups. In addition, the morphological evidence for &quot;T. kabomani&quot; has been contradicted by further research. Dumbá et al. reevaluated skull shape variation among tapir species and found that &quot;T. kabomani&quot; and &quot;T. terrestris&quot; exhibit considerable overlap in skull morphology, though it could still be distinguished by its broad forehead.

<doc id="638629" wikidata="Q2062450" url="?curid=638629" title="Tašmajdan Park">
<text>Tašmajdan Park ( / &quot;Tašmajdanski park&quot;), colloquially Tašmajdan () or simply just Taš (Serbian Cyrillic: Таш, literally: Tash), is a public park and the surrounding urban neighborhood of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is located in Belgrade&#x27;s municipality of Palilula.

In 2010–2011 the entire park saw its largest reconstruction since its creation in 1954. In November 2021, the park was declared a cultural monument and placed under protection. With the adjoining faculty buildings, it forms &quot;Tašmajdan and University Center&quot; protected spatial cultural-historical unit.

== Location ==

Tašmajdan begins southeast of Belgrade&#x27;s designated center, Terazije, covering the extreme south-west corner of the Palilula municipality, bordering the municipalities of Vračar on the south and Stari Grad on the west. In a narrower sense, Tašmajdan occupies the area bounded by the streets of &quot;Takovska&quot; on the north-west, &quot;Ilije Garašanina&quot; on the northeast, &quot;Beogradska&quot; on the southeast and Bulevar kralja Aleksandra. The majority of the area is occupied by the park itself (central, east, west) while the northern and extreme western sections are urbanised. In a wider sense, it occupies the additional area to the north (between &quot;Ilije Garašanina&quot; and &quot;27. marta&quot; streets) and east (between &quot;Beogradska&quot; and &quot;Karnedžijeva&quot; streets) The latter is also known as Little Tašmajdan. Tašmajdan is bordered by the neighborhoods of Palilula on the northeast, while it extends into the neighborhoods of Vukov Spomenik, Krunski Venac and Nikola Pašić Square on the east, south and west, respectively.

== Administration ==

The neighborhood of Tašmajdan forms a local community (&quot;mesna zajednica&quot;), sub-municipal administrative unit within Palilula. It had a population of 4,887 in 1981, 4,373 in 1991, 4,018 in 2002, and 3,073 in 2011.

== History ==
=== Antiquity ===

Almost two millennia ago, Romans were extracting stone from the quarry located in the area for the building of Belgrade&#x27;s predecessor, Singidunum and for many surviving sarcophagi from that period. It was recorded that the Romans used this stone for the construction of the city&#x27;s aqueduct in 69 AD. The castrum of Singidunum had tall walls, built from the white Tašmajdan limestone. After the Slavs settled in the area, because of the white stones of the fortress they named the city &quot;Beligrad&quot;, or &quot;white city&quot;.

The quarry remained operational during Ottoman period, thus giving the name to the entire location (Turkish &quot;taş&quot;, stone and &quot;maydan&quot;, mine), though it was also used for the extraction of saltpeter by Ilija Milosavljević Kolarac, which was used in the gunpowder production. Due to the proximity to the town, basically all stone buildings and walls in Belgrade from Ottoman period were built from the stone extracted here.

=== Little Vračar ===

Some historians believe that this is the actual place where the remains of the Serbian Saint Sava were burned at the stake on 29 April 1595 by the Ottoman grand vizier Sinan Pasha (area known as Little Vračar) and not the Vračar hill itself or Crveni Krst, another alternative site. Little Vračar () occupied the area along the Tsarigrad Road, starting from the modern crossroad of the &quot;Takovska&quot; Street and Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra. Sinan Pasha transported the remains from the Mileševa monastery in the golden casket and later scattered the ashes over Tašmajdan.

When an international congress of Byzantinologists was held in 1927 in Belgrade, some of them gathered with Marko Kuzmanović, a protopope of the Saint Mark Church. As Kuzmanović wrote, based on previous researches, they all took 60–70 steps from the church altar to the east and ended up on the small mound, called &quot;Čupina Humka&quot; from where both the Sava and the Danube rivers could be seen. Then they told him that this is the exact spot where the remains of Saint Sava were burned. On that spot today is the &quot;Poslednja Šansa&quot; restaurant. Historians who claim that Tašmajdan is the right location include Jovan Rajić and Sreten Popović.

During the 1717 siege of Belgrade, parts of the battle were in Tašmajdan. Austrian army, headed by Eugene of Savoy, defeated the Ottomans, under the command of Hacı Halil Pasha. The Ottomans suffered heavy losses and had to hand over Belgrade to the Austrians, which kept it under 1739. The locality of Čupina [H]umka itself was named after captain Milija Lešjanin Čupa. He gained prominence in the 1717 fighting but was executed on the future Čupina Humka location in 1725.

=== 19th century ===

During the First Serbian Uprising and the subsequent Siege of Belgrade in autumn of 1806, leader of the Uprising Karađorđe set his camp in Tašmajdan and conducted the liberation of Belgrade from there. He has done so, as from this location, up to the Stambol Gate of the Belgrade Fortress, there was an open field. One of the heroes of the uprising, Vasa Čarapić, was wounded at Stambol Gate and died in Karađorđe&#x27;s tent in Tašmajdan.

The Čupina Humka mound was used for public reading of decrees and laws. It was here that on 30 November 1830 the Sultan&#x27;s hattisherif (decree) was publicly announced, declaring autonomy (de facto, internal independence) of Serbia and granting hereditary ruling rights to the Obrenović dynasty.

Ruling prince Miloš Obrenović ordered the relocation of the cemetery to Tašmajdan in 1828 and in 1832, when he decided to build a merchant area along the Sava river, he also relocated the inhabitants of Savamala neighborhood. In the churchyard a school for 35 pupils was built in 1837, which was only the second elementary school in Belgrade at the time. During the Čukur Fountain incident in June 1862, and the subsequent bombardment of the city by the Ottomans from the fortress, thousands of women and children found refuge in Tašmajdan&#x27;s caves.

Because of the vicinity of the cemetery in Tašmajdan, there were many shops of funeral equipment and stonecutters. Small shops in time evolved into larger facilities, mostly selling old and cheap goods for the poorer citizens. Mostly owned by the Jewish merchants, these second hand shops formed the predecessor of modern flea markets, stretching along the street to the location of modern Law Faculty.

Eastern part of Tašmajdan was a location of one of the first horse tracks in Belgrade. First modern horse races in Belgrade, based on those held in Western Europe, were organized in 1842, by the former British consul-general George Lloyd Hodges. During the reign of prince Mihailo Obrenović, horse races became an annual event since 1862, with prince himself being one of the participants and creator of the rules. He organized three annual races: for the officers, for the public horsemen and for “anyone else who wanted to participate”. But for decades, the city had no regular horse track. Originally, the races were organized in the, at that time, outskirts of Belgrade: eastern Tašmajdan from 1863 (modern Vukov Spomenik neighborhood, close to the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law and Metropol Palace Hotel Belgrade area), and from the 1890s in Marinkova Bara.

==== Cemetery ====

After the successful Second Serbian Uprising when Serbian prince Miloš Obrenović ordered the building of a new town around the old Kalemegdan fortress (Savamala neighborhood), he also ordered that the old Serbian cemetery from Varoš Kapija (near Zeleni Venac) be moved to Tašmajdan, which was done in 1828. New cemetery was intended as &quot;international&quot; contrary to the existing practice, so beside Serbs, it was also the burial place for Hungarians, Germans, Greeks, Italians and French.

In the mid-19th century, near the modern crossroads with the &quot;Takovska&quot; Street (named &quot;Ratarska&quot; then), was where city ended at the time, and the fields began. The Batal mosque was located there, giving its name to the developing neighborhood. Kafana &quot;Valjevo&quot; was located where the Czech embassy is today. At the crossroad was the house of the Savić family, used as a medical facility and across it was the Marić pharmacy. Next to the pharmacy was a curvy road which was leading to the Tašmajdan cemetery. The cemetery wasn&#x27;t divided into parcels, but had numerous narrow, crossed paths, grown into bushes. This was also the location of &quot;Fišeklija&quot;, a series of gunpowder stores, where gunpowder was sold in &quot;fišeks&quot;, cone-shaped bags made from waxed paper. The stores developed in the second half of the 19th century, after Prince Miloš ordered for gunpowder stores to be removed outside of the city due to the safety reasons.

Already in 1880, city newspapers were reporting on the bad condition of the Tašmajdan cemetery. The burial lots were purchased in the Saint Mark&#x27;s Church, which became quite wealthy, but the cemetery was neglected. Also, as the land was owned by the church, city administration had no interest into arranging the cemetery itself. Part of the cemetery on the side of the Takovska, belonged to the Catholics and the Lutherans. The hill in the direction of modern Seismology Institute was allocated for the graves of soldiers, drowning victims, suicides and non-Christians in general, except for the Jews, who had their own cemetery. Newspapers described the cemetery and the surrounding area as the &quot;shelter for rascals and danglers, who tear the flowers, steal monuments, defile graves with slurs and in other ways, so that cemetery is an abomination of Belgrade where there is no any piety for the deceased&quot;.

In the western section of the cemetery the Catholics and Protestants were buried, Serbs on the central promenade, while area around modern Seisomology Institute was left for the soldiers, suicides and drowned ones. In 1835 a small Palilulska church was built. Some of the most important Serbs from this period were buried in the churchyard, including politicians Toma Vučić-Perišić and Stojan Simić and Stevan Knićanin, philologist Đura Daničić, botanist and first president of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Josif Pančić and philanthropist Ilija Milosavljević Kolarac. Belgraders protested because new cemetery, built on an inhabited fields, gardens and vineyards was away from then downtown, but already in the 1850s, the area surrounding the cemetery was completely urbanized.

Also, as the city expanded, cemetery became inadequate. One the one side, it became too small for the function of the city&#x27;s main graveyard. On the other, once projected to be on the outskirts of the city, as Belgrade grew, Tašmajdan practically became downtown and close to the Royal court. The first official initiative for the removal of the cemetery came in 1871 from Mihailo Jovanović, Metropolitan of Belgrade. As the city was in the financial crisis at the time and was not able to buy such a large lot for the new cemetery, mayor of Belgrade Vladan Đorđević donated a patch of his land to the city for the purpose of establishing a new cemetery. City government officially obtained land in 1882 and gradual restriction of burials was conducted until it was fully closed 1901. It was moved to the newly built Belgrade New Cemetery, several blocks to the east, beginning from 1886 and the moving was finally completed in 1927 with park being planted instead of the old cemetery. However, many bodies from older periods were not moved and remained below the park.

As many weren&#x27;t relocated because they had no surviving family members. or their families weren&#x27;t interested or solvent enough to pay for the relocation, city administration was left with the large number of tombstones. Some of the stones and bricks were sold, earning nice income to the city, but still, many remained. Administration decided to reuse them for construction works around the city. The stones were used for the 1927-1928 works on the Belgrade Fortress (pathways around the Big Staircase in Kalemegdan Park which connected it to the fortress&#x27; Lower Town, parts of the Pobednik&#x27;s pedestal), for the partial paving of the Ruzveltova Street and for the construction of the Tašmajdan pathway between the churches of Saint Mark and Holy Trinity. Belgrade chronicler Zoran Nikolić labeled the fortress path, made of the tombstones turned with the inscribed sides down, Path of the &quot;Former&quot; Deceased.

This was the usual practice in the Balkan history in general (the old, reused materials are called &quot;spolije&quot;) as there are numerous Greek, Roman and Byzantine remains in the region. Still, citizens protested when former tombstones were used for the works on the fortress. One of the stone benches was made in such a manner, that the name of the deceased, Aksentije Jovanović, was clearly visible, together with the carved cross and skull and crossbones.

=== 20th century ===

On the horse race track, a football match was held in 1915, before the German-Austrian attack, between the gunners from the Allied nations (Russia, Great Britain and France) and the Serbian team made of the players from the teams BSK, Velika Srbija and Soko. BSK had its own court nearby, on the location of the modern Belgrade University Library. During the Interbellum, King Alexander Karađorđević had an idea of building a catholic church in the Ilije Garašanina Street, next to the First Female Realschule. He intended to build it above the former quarry, where the modern stadium is, as an edifice &quot;monumental like Vatican cathedral of Saint Peter and beautiful like basilica Sagrada Família in Barcelona&quot;. The project was never realized.

The Belgrade&#x27;s first general urban plan, adopted in 1923 and approved in 1924, envisioned construction of the city&#x27;s municipal hall at the crossroads of the boulevard and Takovska, but the Main Post Office Palace was built instead. The post office itself was to be built on the lot next to this one, but it turned out it was a church land. So the post office was built on the neighboring lot, though completely following the design from the plan, while the Church of Saint Mark was later built on the church parcel planned for the post office. The plan also included the Ministry of the Foreign Affairs Building in Tašmajdan itself, but it wasn&#x27;t built either.

A tennis court was located on Tašmajdan during World War II. As basketball was played on the clay at the time, local guys began playing basketball there. In 1942–44, a group of 4 players was formed: Bora Stanković (1925), Aleksandar Nikolić (1924–2000), Radomir Šaper (1925–98) and Nebojša Popović (1923–2001). After the war, the group became founding fathers of the &quot;Yugoslav school of basketball&quot;. Later, Stanković became secretary general of FIBA, Nikolić was a coach, labeled the &quot;Father of Yugoslav basketball&quot; while Šaper and Popović turned to administrative positions. All four are FIBA Hall of Fame inductees.

After the war, new Communist authorities planned to build a massive building of Arts Museum in Tašmajdan. An architectural design competition was organized in 1948, which was won by Nikola Dobrović, but then it was decided his design is &quot;formalist, excessively massive, and fortress-like&quot;. Miladin Prljević was given the task of reducing the project, so he downsized it from five huge buildings to two, one to exhibit paintings and sculptures, and the other for medieval collection. This was still deemed too expensive and it was decided to form a park instead. The construction of the park began in 1950 and the opening ceremony was held in May 1954. The seedlings were transported by the horse wagons from the nursery gardens in Krnjača and from Zagreb&#x27;s Forestry Faculty.

In 1961, the first olympic-size swimming pool in Belgrade was built in Tašmajdan, within the complex of the sports center. At the time, the complex also included Belgrade Tennis Club, amusement park, &quot;Avala&quot; cinema, Fire Brigade and its fire lookout tower.

Since the 1970s, venues in Tašmajdan became some of the most popular hotspots of Belgrade&#x27;s night life. In 1971, &quot;Cepelin&quot; (&quot;Zeppelin&quot;), the best and the most famous disco in Yugoslavia was opened. It was located at 28 Ilije Garašanina Street. Its opening was described as the &quot;rushing off&quot; of the Belgrade night life. At the opening night, almost all of the state and military top officials and members of the diplomatic corps, were present. The caviar was served from the Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s plates. At the peak of its popularity, &quot;Cepelin&quot; had 10,000 members. It had three dance floors, state of the art sound system and the interior was patterned after the famed London club &quot;Lavalbon&quot;: floors covered with the black artificial leather, dominant brass ornaments, luxurious séparées, plush covered armchairs, twenty different types of mirrors, one thousand colored lightbulbs, and strobe lights above each dance floor. It also had blacklights, projector which emitted psychedelic music videos on the walls which were mostly black. The rooms were stuffy and the colors of the lights changed depending on the DJ who was working that night. Parts of the walls and furniture were in red, with colorful flower prints. The club was located next to the Fifth Gymnasium and sponsored by the Tašmajdan Sports and Recreation Center. It was opened by Saša Nikolić and had working hours of 16:00–21:00 (matinée, for the minors) and 21:00–24:00, for adult visitors, with strict rules on not allowing the minors to stay during the later program. DJs, including Saša Radosavljević and Raša Petrović, were located in the glass booth above the dance podium. It was renovated and expanded in the mid-1970s and included live performances from the most popular Yugoslav rock bands. Most frequent performers was Korni Grupa. &quot;Cepelin&quot; was closed in 1980.

In the 1980s, &quot;Taš&quot; replaced &quot;Cepelin&quot;. The club had the so-called &quot;Chivas booths&quot;, which introduced whiskey as a symbol of prestige in the Belgrade&#x27;s night life. Popular venues in the 1990s included &quot;Bus&quot; (in the park, close to the stadium, located in a small edifice which extended from the real derelict bus) and &quot;Pećina&quot; (situated at the entry into the &quot;lagums&quot;, and in the lagums themselves. It hosted the &quot;Ovo je moj grad&quot; festival).

==== 1999 NATO bombing ====

Tašmajdan was bombed again during the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia when several objects in Tašmajdan park were badly hit:

* 23 April 1999 – At 2:06 NATO aircraft struck with missiles the building of the Serbian Broadcasting Corporation (RTS) situated in Tašmajdan park. Part of the building collapsed, trapping people who were working in the building that night. Sixteen people were killed while many were trapped for days. The building of the Russian church nearby was also seriously damaged.

* 24 April 1999 – A children&#x27;s theatre &quot;Duško Radović&quot; in the heart of Tašmajdan park was badly damaged due to its close proximity to neighbouring buildings that were bombed.
* 30 June 1999 – A heart-like shaped monument was erected by the city of Belgrade for all the children that have died in the bombing. The monument says &quot;We were just children&quot; in English and Serbian.

The rubble was removed but the ruined section of the building was left as it is. A small memorial was placed in the park, called &quot;Why?&quot; (&quot;Zašto&quot;?). City administration proposed architectural-urban complex, even an underground garage, but family members of the victims rejected it. City conducted a design competition in 2013, with 40 applicants, selecting a design by the &quot;Neoarhitekte&quot; bureau (Snežana Vesnić, Vladimir Milenković, Tatjana Stratimirović). The project included conservation of the remaining ruins, and creation of one continuous &quot;discretely symbolic&quot; and &quot;suggestively poetic&quot; memorial complex with the existing &quot;Why?&quot; memorial. Though never officially abandoned, the project never materialized. Family members of the victims opposed to the stipulation in the competition that memorial text will blame only the NATO and not the executives of the television (then general manager Dragoljub Milanović served 10 years for not relocating the workers in time). Officially, the problem is due to the ownership issues, as some lots are owned by the city, and some by the state, so the project got lost in the bureaucracy.

=== 21st century ===

Urbanists drafted a detailed regulatory plan for the park in 2001. They concluded that both restaurants (Madera and Poslednja Šansa) and a group of houses across the Law Faculty, shouldn&#x27;t be in the park area. The only edifice which is completely surrounded by the park, and which should be preserved, was the Seismology Institute (churches are located at the edges of the park). Still, it was decided that nothing will be demolished, that nothing can be built in the park, that existing edifices will be kept &quot;as long as they stand&quot; and that they can&#x27;t be enlarged and annexed, either in width or height. While Poslednja Šansa was described as a small object, while Madera was described by the urbanists as the &quot;boil&quot; in the park. In October 2019, under suspicious conditions, the leaseholder of Poslednja Šansa since 1991 was expelled and Predrag Ranković Peconi, controversial business figure who has been acquiring hospitality venues in Belgrade in the past two decades, was announced as the new tenant. Sports Center, which owns the venue, claims the name will be preserved and the statue of poet Vasko Popa will be erected in the restaurant&#x27;s yard.

In June 2010, it was announced that the park will be completely reconstructed as a gift of Azerbaijan to Belgrade. The park has been reopened in June 2011 after throughout renovation, including the installation of a coloured fountain broadcasting classical music. As a sign of gratitude Belgrade has erected a monument to the former president of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev in the park. Reconstruction included the rebuilding of the paths, removal of sick trees and planting of new ones, construction of two children playgrounds and a special area for the pensioners. Two public toilets and park infrastructure were renovated, the video surveillance system was installed and the statue of the writer Milorad Pavić was erected. The star-shaped fountain, patterned after a similar one in Barcelona, was closed in 2020, and fully renovated by September 2021.

As of 2013, Tašmajdan Park had 1,100 individual trees from 61 different species and covered and area of .

In November 2017 a complete rearrangement of the plateau, which functioned as an extension of the Tašmajdan Park in front of the St.Mark&#x27;s Church began. Old asphalt pavement which served as a parking lot was removed. Architect Jovan Mitrović designed a new, leveled combination of granite slabs and green areas. The plateau was divided in two sections, left and right, separated by the green island. The right, &quot;ceremonial&quot; side was regularly shaped, with the granite slabs posted in the horizontal rhythm, interrupted with the thin squares of red Italian granite. The design is patterned after the façade of the Michelangelo&#x27;s temples on Capitoline Hill in Rome. The left side has &quot;disheveled&quot; pattern, made of differently sized and combined granite slabs. The plateau was finished in February 2018.

In June 2018 it was announced that a monument to Patriarch Pavle, head of the Serbian Orthodox Church from 1990 to 2009, will be erected on the green area between the newly finished plateau and the tram stop in Tašmajdan Park. The tall bronze monument was authored by Zoran Maleš. It was placed in the park on 13 November 2018 and dedicated on 15 November, an anniversary of Pavle&#x27;s death. Maleš said that he wanted to show the etherealness of Pavle, who was deemed among Serbs as the &quot;walking saint&quot;. He also added that he was influenced by the photos of patriarch commuting by the trams – it showed his mundane approach to life, using the public transportation, and he indeed often travelled to this spot when he was visiting the Saint Mark&#x27;s Church. However, the sculpture of the patriarch in the sitting position, but without a chair, throne or anything that he is sitting on, garnered negative public reaction. The Serbian Orthodox Church said that this is a public monument and that they will not judge it, but that it plans to erect a proper, monumental sculpture of Patriarch Pavle in the churchyard of the Rakovica Monastery, where he was buried.

Right across the park, at the corner of the Resavska Street and Bulevar kralja Aleksandra, a memorial plaque in memory of assassination of Galip Balkar (1937-83), Turkish ambassador to Yugoslavia, was unveiled on 8 October 2019. Assassination occurred on 9 March 1983 and the plaque commemorates both the ambassador, and student Željko Milivojević, who was also killed by the assassins while trying to apprehend them. In July 2020 city announced erection of the monument to novelist Miloš Crnjanski in the park&#x27;s main alley. The sculpture, sculptured by Miloš Komad, was selected in March 2022.

== Landmarks ==
=== Protection ===

With the surrounding area, Tašmajdan forms the cultural-historical complex Old Belgrade (), while the park itself is in the zone of the protected natural area of Miocene Sandbank-Tašmajdan (). The protected geological natural monument was established in 1968, and after the revision and reconfirmation in 2021, today covers . It is placed in the category III of protection. Exposed cliffs from the Miocene period show layers from the period of existence of the ancient Pannonian Sea. The exposed sandbank in the north and northeast section of the park, consists of three sections. The most recognizable section is seen from the western stands of the Tašmajdan stadium. Section 2 is below the stadium, while the third section includes caves (see Underworld section below).

The ridge extends all the way to Kalemegdan, ending with cliffs above the mouth of the Sava into the Danube. It consists of the Badenian limestone layers on top of the Lower Cretaceous Urgonian Limestone. This type of limestone became known as . It is rich in fossils, which include seashells, sea snails, and sea urchins.

=== Churches ===
Small Palilulska church (church of Palilula) was built in 1835. It was destroyed in the German bombing of Belgrade on 6 April 1941. Today existing Serbian Orthodox St. Mark&#x27;s Church was built in 1931–1940, in the medieval Serbo-Byzantine style, patterned after the Gračanica monastery. The Serbian Emperor Dušan is buried inside, along with the Serbian Patriarch German. Next to it is a small Russian Orthodox church of the Holy Trinity, built in 1924, inside of which the Russian general Pyotr Wrangel is buried.

=== Sports complex ===
Within the Tašmajdan park a sports complex of Tašmajdan Sports Centre is located. Centre administers several facilities located outside Tašmajdan, like &quot;Pionir Hall&quot; and &quot;Ice Hall&quot;. However, swimming pools are located in the park. The outdoor swimming pool was built in 1959–1961. Its dimensions are 50 x 20 meters; its depth varies between 2.2 and 5.0 meters; its capacity is 3,500 m³ and 2,500 seats. Next to the big one, there is a small swimming pool for children. Altogether, there is enough room for 4,000 people. It is equipped for international day-and-night competitions in swimming, water polo, water diving, etc. and also used for certain cultural venues or as an outdoor cinema during summer. It was one of the venues for the 2006 Men&#x27;s European Water Polo Championship and one of the venues of the 2009 Summer Universiade in July 2009, the event for which the pool was renovated. The indoor swimming-pool was built in 1964–1968 and open for public on 17 February 1969. Its dimensions are 50 x 20 meters and depth is between 2.2 and 5.4 meters; its capacity is 3,700 m³. The swimming pool is surrounded with four diving boards – 1, 3, 5 and 10 meters high and 2,000 seats. It is equipped with underwater light. At −16 °C, water and air can be heated up to 28 °C.

Some of the best known happenings in the venue include: EuroBasket Women 1954, first Miss Yugoslavia contest in 1957 (won by Tonka Katunarić), 1957 World Women&#x27;s Handball Championship, concerts of Alexandrov Ensemble in 1958 and later in the 1960s and 1970s of Mazowsze, Ray Charles and Tina Turner and ice hockey matches with over 10,000 spectators.

=== Seismology Institute ===
After an earthquake hit Svilajnac in 1893, one of the strongest ever in Serbia, instigated by the geologist Jovan Žujović, the Geology institute of the Great School began collecting data on earthquakes. After the Great School was transformed into the University of Belgrade in 1905, the university established the Seismology Institute in 1906 and proposed the location of Tašmajdan. First seismographs were installed in 1909 and the first earthquake was recorded in June 1910. Seismology Institute was officially part of the University of Belgrade until 1995, but is still located in Tašmajdan.

== Little Tašmajdan ==

Little Tašmajdan () is the eastern extension of the park, across &quot;Beogradska&quot; street which forms its western border, while &quot;Ilije Garašanina&quot; and &quot;Karnedžijeva&quot; streets form its northern and eastern borders, respectively. The southern section of the complex is the location of the Law Faculty and Hotel Metropol.

The park has undergone a renovation in 2006. Concrete walkways have been placed (6,000 square metres), and new stairways lighting have been installed. In the centre of the park a playing area for children has been constructed. Near the children&#x27;s area there is a fountain which has also been renovated and 30 new benches have been placed in the park as well.

Marking 80th anniversary of his death, a monument to the Russian émigré architect Nikolay Krasnov was dedicated in the park. Krasnov designed some of the most representative public buildings in Belgrade during the Interbellum. A stone monument, representing Krasnov sitting at the drawing desk, is work of Nebojša Savović Nes. The monument, work of Russian sculptor Sergey Nikitin, was first announced for September 2016. The planned location was the Manjež park, but this plan never went through. The monument is ultimately placed in the Little Tašmajdan, across the building of the Archive of Serbia, which was designed by Krasnov.

== Underworld ==

Geologically, the rocks on Tašmajdan are 13,5 million years old, and the ridge was probably a low island during the existence of the inner Pannonian Sea. Fossils from this period have been found and are kept at the Museum of Natural History. The caves under Tašmajdan are 6 to 8 million years old. Remains of the Roman aqueduct are found in the caves. Military arsenals and warehouses have been housed for a long time in the catacombs left after the excavations of stone blocks, and these catacombs have been also used as shelters and first-aid places for wounded soldiers.

During the Interbellum, the Šonda family, who owned the chocolate factory, founded the &quot;ice factory&quot; in Tašmajdan&#x27;s underground, below the modern building of Radio Television Serbia. The ice was advertised as the &quot;ice from the tap water&quot;, as opposed to the naturally occurring ice from the Danube.

It was a major hiding place for the local population during the 1914–1915 bombing of Belgrade by the Austro-Hungarian army in World War I and German bombing in April 1941. During World War II, the caves were the headquarters of Alexander Löhr, head of the German Air forces in Serbia, and colloquially called &quot;Löhr’s cave&quot;., which is accessed after passing the former quarry. Headquarters were massive, with large metal doors, truck entrances and fully prepared to support 1,000 soldiers for six months without making any surface contact. It could survive chemical and biological attacks, had a ventilation system, power generator, phone lines and elevator and one of the caves was even adapted into the brig for disobedient soldiers. It was also used by the Germans as the collection center for the Jews. Vast labyrinth of corridors, expanded by the Wehrmacht, branches into all directions beneath the city and today nobody knows how many of them there are or where they all lead. Future examinations are slowed because of the lack of funding and many remaining German mines. After 1945 the entrances into the caves were closed and new generations completely lost any knowledge of it. It was only in the 2000s that they were rediscovered and today are slowly turning into one of Belgrade tourist attractions. Occasionally, people illegally dig through the walls of the caves, hoping to find some long lost treasure.

Third large natural cave is right beneath the famed &quot;Poslednja Šansa&quot; restaurant. It was described by Felix Kanitz, who travelled through Serbia from 1860 to 1864. He noted that in this cave he has found 150 oxcarts with food and that the entire cave could accommodate some 600 carts all together. After World War II, caves were used as “ice factory”, which supplied with ice city kafanas until the 1950s. A big boulder broke off in 1966, fell into the center of the cave and a little girl fell through the hole and got killed. When sports center was built, rubble and remaining bones from the old cemetery were thrown into the caves, with deposits being some high today. Old doctors used to say that from these piles they took bones for the anatomy classes. In general, the cave, known as the &quot;Saltpeter cave&quot;, appears at least half of its real size being buried under the deposits and geologists dubbed it &quot;the weirdest part of Belgrade&quot;. It branches into the direction of the Faculty of Law, but this corridor is completely buried and was never explored. All caves are cold and wet.

As the caves were under military jurisdiction after World War II, only when the military administration was revoked, the exploration of the underground began in 1992. The accessible sections of the underground are some below the park.

=== Aquarium ===

Underwater research company &quot;Viridijan&quot; announced in June 2006 it would begin construction of the first Belgrade&#x27;s aquarium in the caves beneath Tašmajdan. The project includes construction of 50 underground aquariums with about 1,000 cubic meters of water in the period of 9 years. Over 900 marine animals were supposed to be placed in the natural environment provided by the caves. The project was initially backed by the Ministry of trade in the Government of Serbia and Belgrade City Assembly (the only problem appeared to be the building permit), but the project, which was promised to be &quot;more than just exhibit space&quot; and announcing &quot;the return of Pannonian Sea to Belgrade&quot; was abandoned.

<text>Political Soldier is a political concept associated with the Third Position. It played a leading role in Britain&#x27;s National Front from the late 1970s onwards under young radicals Nick Griffin, Patrick Harrington and Derek Holland of the Official National Front. The term was used to indicate an almost fanatical devotion to the cause of nationalism, which its supporters felt was needed to bring about a revolutionary change in society.

A faction within the National Front called for the building of a fresh ethos within society and for the emergence of a new man, to be known as the Political Soldier, who would reject materialism and devote himself to the nationalist struggle with religious zeal. Basing their ideas on those of Julius Evola, an Italian philosopher who sought the creation of a new elite to combat the decadence of modern bourgeois society, Political Soldiers rejected traditional British nationalism in favour of a European outlook and a racialist equality of separate races.

==History==
The idea of the Political Soldier, someone who devotes all his time and energy to the nationalist struggle, was one that had long existed on the far right in Europe. Jean-François Thiriart was amongst those to argue for this need for complete devotion from activists and had set up camps to train Political Soldiers in the 1960s.

Holland published &quot;The Political Soldier - A Statement&quot; in 1984. The pamphlet called on supporters to become consumed by their nationalism and to make it the driving force behind everything in their lives. The book offered four historical examples of a Political Soldier, i.e., the Spartans, the Roman Centurion, the Crusaders and the Iron Guard of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, a Romanian movement of fascism and religion. The book also made the Celtic Cross the emblem of the Political Soldiers.

The concept of the Political Soldier caused divisions within the British far right as many of its ideas were new and alien concepts. The Official National Front was eventually removed from the NF and the calls for a &#x27;new man&#x27; were continued by the International Third Position. Within the UK, the magazine &quot;Final Conflict&quot; is still devoted to this idea. Holland&#x27;s book has been translated into a number of European languages (notably into Polish for the National Revival of Poland) whilst the term is still used by the National Democratic Party of Germany to describe its followers.

<doc id="638633" wikidata="Q5273953" url="?curid=638633" title="Dictionary-based machine translation">
<text>Machine translation can use a method based on dictionary entries, which means that the words will be translated as a dictionary does – word by word, usually without much correlation of meaning between them. Dictionary lookups may be done with or without morphological analysis or lemmatisation. While this approach to machine translation is probably the least sophisticated, dictionary-based machine translation is ideally suitable for the translation of long lists of phrases on the subsentential (i.e., not a full sentence) level, e.g. inventories or simple catalogs of products and services.

It can also be used to speed up manual translation, if the person carrying it out is fluent in both languages and therefore capable of correcting syntax and grammar.

== LMT ==
LMT, introduced around 1990, is a Prolog-based machine-translation system that works
on specially made bilingual dictionaries, such as the Collins English-German
(CEG), which have been rewritten in an indexed form which is easily readable by
computers. This method uses a structured lexical data base (LDB) in order to
correctly identify word categories from the source language, thus constructing
a coherent sentence in the target language, based on rudimentary morphological
analysis. This system uses &quot;frames&quot; to identify the position a certain word
should have, from a syntactical point of view, in a sentence. This &quot;frames&quot; are
mapped via language conventions, such as UDICT in the case of English.

In its early (prototype) form LMT uses three lexicons,
accessed simultaneously: source, transfer and target, although it is possible
to encapsulate this whole information in a single lexicon. The program uses a
lexical configuration consisting of two main elements. The first element is a
hand-coded lexicon addendum which contains possible incorrect translations. The
second element consist of various bilingual and monolingual dictionaries
regarding the two languages which are the source and target languages.

== Example-Based &amp; Dictionary-Based Machine Translation ==
This method of Dictionary-Based Machine translation explores
a different paradigm from systems such as LMT. An example-based machine translation system is supplied with only a &quot;sentence-aligned bilingual corpus&quot;.
Using this data the translating program generates a &quot;word-for-word bilingual
dictionary&quot; which is used for further translation.

Whilst this system would generally be regarded as a whole
different way of machine translation than Dictionary-Based Machine Translation,
it is important to understand the complementing nature of this paradigms. With
the combined power inherent in both systems, coupled with the fact that a
Dictionary-Based Machine Translation works best with a &quot;word-for-word bilingual
dictionary&quot; lists of words it demonstrates the fact that a coupling of this two
translation engines would generate a very powerful translation tool that is,
besides being semantically accurate, capable of enhancing its own
functionalities via perpetual feedback loops.

A system which combines both paradigms in a way similar to
what was described in the previous paragraph is the Pangloss Example-Based
Machine Translation engine (PanEBMT) machine translation engine. PanEBMT uses a
correspondence table between languages to create its corpus. Furthermore,
PanEBMT supports multiple incremental operations on its corpus, which facilitates
a biased translation used for filtering purposes.

== Parallel Text Processing ==
Douglas Hofstadter through his &quot;Le Ton beau de Marot: In
Praise of the Music of Language&quot; proves what a complex task translation is. The
author produced and analysed dozens upon dozens of possible translations for an
eighteen line French poem, thus revealing complex inner workings of syntax,
morphology and meaning. Unlike most translation engines who choose a single
translation based on back to back comparison of the texts in both the source
and target languages, Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s work prove the inherent level of
error which is present in any form of translation, when the meaning of the
source text is too detailed or complex. Thus the problem of text alignment and
&quot;statistics of language&quot; is brought to attention.

This discrepancies led to Martin Kay&#x27;s views on translation
and translation engines as a whole. As Kay puts it &quot;More substantial successes
in these enterprises will require a sharper image of the world than any that
can be made out simply from the statistics of language use&quot; [(page xvii)
Parallel Text Processing: Alignment and Use of Translation Corpora]. Thus Kay
has brought back to light the question of meaning inside language and the
distortion of meaning through processes of translation.

== Lexical Conceptual Structure ==
One of the possible uses of Dictionary-Based Machine Translation is facilitating &quot;Foreign Language Tutoring&quot; (FLT). This can be achieved by using Machine-Translation technology as well as linguistics, semantics and morphology to produce &quot;Large-Scale Dictionaries&quot; in virtually any given language. Development in lexical semantics and computational linguistics during the time period between 1990 and 1996 made it possible for &quot;natural language processing&quot; (NLP) to flourish, gaining new capabilities, nevertheless benefiting machine translation in general.

&quot;Lexical Conceptual Structure&quot; (LCS) is a representation
that is language independent. It is mostly used in foreign language tutoring,
especially in the natural language processing element of FLT. LCS has also
proved to be an indispensable tool for machine translation of any kind, such as
Dictionary-Based Machine Translation. Overall one of the primary goals of LCS
is &quot;to demonstrate that synonymous verb senses share distributional patterns&quot;.

== &quot;DKvec&quot; ==
&quot;DKvec is a method for extracting bilingual lexicons, from
noisy parallel corpora based on arrival distances of words in noisy parallel
corpora&quot;. This method has emerged in response to two problems plaguing the
statistical extraction of bilingual lexicons: &quot;(1) How can noisy parallel
corpora be used? (2) How can non-parallel yet comparable corpora be used?&quot;

The &quot;DKvec&quot; method has proven invaluable for machine
translation in general, due to the amazing success it has had in trials
conducted on both English – Japanese and English – Chinese noisy parallel
corpora. The figures for accuracy &quot;show a 55.35% precision from a small corpus
and 89.93% precision from a larger corpus&quot;. With such impressive numbers it is
safe to assume the immense impact that methods such as &quot;DKvec&quot; has had in the
evolution of machine translation in general, especially Dictionary-Based
Machine Translation.

Algorithms used for extracting parallel corpora in a
bilingual format exploit the following rules in order to achieve a satisfactory
accuracy and overall quality:
# Words have one sense per corpus
# Words have single translation per corpus
# No missing translations in the target document
# Frequencies of bilingual word occurrences are comparable
# Positions of bilingual word occurrences are comparable

This methods can be used to generate, or to look for, occurrence patterns which in turn are used to produce binary occurrence vectors which are used by the &quot;DKvec&quot; method.

== History of Machine Translation ==
The history of machine translation (MT) starts around the
mid 1940s. Machine translations was probably the first time computers were
used for non-numerical purposes. Machine translation enjoyed a fierce research interest
during the 1950s and 1960s, which was followed by a stagnation until the 1980s.
After the 1980s, machine translation became mainstream again, enjoying an even
bigger popularity than in the 1950s and 1960s as well as rapid expansion,
largely based on the text corpora approach.

The basic concept of machine translation can be traced back
to the 17th century in the speculations surrounding &quot;universal
languages and mechanical dictionaries&quot;. The first true practical machine
translation suggestions were made in 1933 by Georges Artsrouni in France and Petr
Trojanskij in Russia. Both had patented machines that they believed could be
used for translating meaning from a language to another. &quot;In June 1952, the
first MT conference was convened at MIT by Yehoshua Bar-Hillel&quot;. On 7 January 1954 a Machine Translation convention in New York, sponsored by IBM,
served at popularizing the field. The conventions popularity came from the
translation of short English sentences into Russian. This engineering feat
mesmerised the public and the governments of both the US and USSR who
therefore stimulated large-scale funding in machine translation research.
Although the enthusiasm for machine translation was extremely high, technical
and knowledge limitations led to disillusions regarding what machine
translation was actually capable of doing, at least at that time. Thus machine
translation lost in popularity until the 1980s, when advances in linguistics
and technology helped revitalise the interest in this field.

== Translingual information retrieval ==
&quot;Translingual information retrieval (TLIR) consists of
providing a query in one language and searching document collections in one or
more different languages&quot;. Most methods of TLIR can be quantified into two
categories, namely statistical-IR approaches and query translation. Machine
translation based TLIR works in one of two ways. Either the query is translated
in the target language, or the original query is used to search while the
collection of possible results is translated in the query language and used for
cross-reference. Both methods have pros and cons, namely:
* Translation Accuracy – the correctness of any machine translation, is dependent on the size of the translated text, thus short texts or words may suffer from a bigger degree of semantic errors, as well as lexical ambiguities, whereas a larger text may provide context, which helps at disambiguation.
* Retrieval Accuracy – based on the same logic invoked at the previous point, it is preferably to have whole documents translated, rather than queries, because large texts are likely to suffer from less loss of meaning in translation then short queries.
* Practicality – unlike the previous points, translating short queries is the best way to go. This is because it is easy to translate short texts, whilst translating whole libraries is highly resource intensive, plus the volume of such a translating task implies the indexing of the new translated documents

All this points prove the fact that Dictionary-Based machine translation is the most efficient and reliable form of translation when working with TLIR. This is because the process &quot;looks up each query term in a general-purpose bilingual dictionary, and uses all its possible translations.&quot;

== Machine Translation of Very Close Languages ==
The examples of RUSLAN, a dictionary-based machine
translation system between Czech and Russian and CESILKO, a Czech – Slovak
dictionary-based machine translation system, shows that in the case of very
close languages simpler translation methods are more efficient, fast and
reliable.

The RUSLAN system was made in order to prove the hypotheses
that related languages are easier to translate. The system development started
in 1985 and was terminated five years later due to lack of further funding. The
lessons taught by the RUSLAN experiment are that a transfer-based approach of
translation retains its quality regardless of how close the languages are. The
main two bottlenecks of &quot;full-fledged transfer-based systems&quot; are complexity
and unreliability of syntactic analysis.

== Multilingual Information Retrieval MLIR ==
&quot;Information Retrieval systems rank documents according to
statistical similarity measures based on the co-occurrence of terms in queries
and documents&quot;. The MLIR system was created and optimised in such a way that
facilitates dictionary based translation of queries. This is because queries tend to be short, a couple of words, which, despite not
providing a lot of context it is a more feasible than translating whole
documents, due to practical reasons. Despite all this, the MLIR system is
highly dependent on a lot of resources such as automated language detection
software.

<doc id="638640" wikidata="Q670516" url="?curid=638640" title="Edward I, Count of Bar">
<text>Edward I (1294 - died November 1336), was the count of Bar from 1302 to his death. He was a minor when he succeeded his father Henry III as count, so ruled initially under the regency of his uncles, John of Puisaye, Theobald, Bishop of Liège, and Renaud, Bishop of Metz (his mother Eleanor had been dead since 1298).

==Life==
Born in 1294, Edward was the son of Henry III, Count of Bar, and Eleanor of England. In 1308, he accompanied Frederick IV of Lorraine into battle. In 1310, he married Mary, daughter of Robert II, Duke of Burgundy and Agnes of France, and was declared to have attained his majority. 

Edward purchased the lordship of Stenay from his uncle John, the aforementioned lord of Puisaye. In 1313, he was captured in battle against Frederick and not ransomed until 1314. Edward constructed a hydraulic forge at Moyeuvre-Grande in 1323. In 1324, he was again allied with the duke of Lorraine, and also with John,king of Bohemia, and the Archbishop of Trier, Baldwin of Luxembourg. This operation was the War of Metz, for each of the allied lords was owed something by the citizens of Metz. Edward demanded compensation for garrisoning the city with his own troops during a conflict with the bishop of Verdun.

In 1336, Edward died in a shipwreck off the coast of Famagusta, Cyprus, while en route to a Crusade. 

==Marriage &amp; issue==
Edward and Marie had:
*Henry IV, his successor
*Eleanor (died 1332), married (1330) Rudolph, Duke of Lorraine, son of Frederick IV and Elisabeth of Austria, of the House of Habsburg
*Beatrice, married Guido Gonzaga, Lord of Mantua, member of the House of Gonzaga

<doc id="638645" wikidata="Q1484058" url="?curid=638645" title="Short QT syndrome">
<text>Short QT syndrome (SQT) is a very rare genetic disease of the electrical system of the heart, and is associated with an increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms and sudden cardiac death. The syndrome gets its name from a characteristic feature seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG) – a shortening of the QT interval. It is caused by mutations in genes encoding ion channels that shorten the cardiac action potential, and appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The condition is diagnosed using a 12-lead ECG. Short QT syndrome can be treated using an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or medications including quinidine. Short QT syndrome was first described in 2000, and the first genetic mutation associated with the condition was identified in 2004.

==Signs and symptoms==
Those affected by short QT syndrome (SQT) have an increased risk of developing abnormal heart rhythms. These abnormal heart rhythms often occur at a young age. They may take relatively benign forms such as atrial fibrillation, leading to symptoms of palpitations, breathlessness, or fatigue. Accordingly, atrial fibrillation presenting in a newborn should raise the suspicion of short QT syndrome. In addition, far more dangerous heart rhythm disturbances such as ventricular fibrillation can also occur in those with short QT syndrome, leading to blackouts or even sudden death. More than a third of those with short QT present with ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death, while one in five cases are detected during family screening, and one in five cases are found incidentally after an electrocardiogram (ECG) has been recorded for another reason.

If someone with short QT syndrome is examined while their heart is beating in an abnormal rhythm such as atrial fibrillation, this can be detected by feeling their pulse. No abnormal signs will usually be found when examining someone with short QT syndrome while their heart is beating in its normal or sinus rhythm.

==Cause==
Short QT syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in genes responsible for producing certain ion channels within heart cells. It appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Some genetic variants cause an increased flow of potassium out of the cell, while others reduce the flow of calcium into the cell. The common effect of all these variants is to shorten the cardiac action potential, reflected on the surface ECG as a shortening of the QT interval. A list of genes in which variants have been associated with short QT syndrome can be found in the table below.
=== Mechanism ===
The overall effect of each of the genetic variants associated with short QT syndrome is to shorten the cardiac action potential, which in turn increases the risk of developing abnormal heart rhythms including atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation. During the normal rhythm of the heart, or sinus rhythm, smooth waves of electrical activity pass regularly through the cardiac muscle. In contrast, during atrial or ventricular fibrillation, waves of electrical activation spiral through the cardiac muscle chaotically in a mass of disorganised, broken wavelets. The consequence of fibrillation is that the chambers of the heart affected by the disorganised electrical activation lose their pumping ability – fibrillation of the cardiac atria in atrial fibrillation leads to an irregular pulse, and fibrillation of the cardiac ventricles in ventricular fibrillation renders the heart unable to pump blood at all.

There are several possible mechanisms by which short action potentials might promote fibrillation. The link between these mechanisms is how the duration of the action potential influences how frequently a heart muscle cell can be excited. A shorter action potential generally allow a heart muscle cell to be excited more frequently – the refractory period is shorter.

The first mechanism, referred to as the dispersion of repolarisation, occurs because the action potential shortening seen in this condition occurs to a greater extent in some layers of the heart wall than in others. This means that at certain points in the cardiac cycle, some layers of the heart wall will have fully repolarised, and are therefore ready to contract again, while other regions are only partially repolarised and therefore are still within their refractory period and not yet able to be re-excited. If a triggering impulse arrives at this critical point in the cardiac cycle, the wavefront of electrical activation will conduct in some regions but block in others, potentially leading to wavebreak and re-entrant arrhythmias.

The second mechanism relates to the increased number of fibrillatory wavelets that can simultaneously exist if the action potential decreases, in a concept known as the arrhythmia wavelength. During fibrillation, the chaotic wavelets rotate, or re-enter, within the muscle of the heart, continually extinguishing and reforming. The volume of tissue in which each wavelet can complete a re-entrant circuit is dependent on the refractory period of the tissue and the speed at which the waves of depolarisation traverse move – the conduction velocity. The product of the conduction velocity and refractory period is known as the wavelength. In tissue with a lower wavelength a wavelet can re-enter within a smaller volume of tissue. A shorter refractory period therefore allows more wavelets to exist within a given volume of tissue, reducing the chance of all wavelets simultaneously extinguishing and terminating the arrhythmia.

==Diagnosis==

Short QT syndrome is diagnosed primarily using an electrocardiogram (ECG), but may also take into account the clinical history, family history, and possibly genetic testing. Whilst a diagnostic scoring system has been proposed that incorporate all of these factors (the Gollob score), it is uncertain whether this score is useful for diagnosis or risk stratification, and the Gollob score has not been universally accepted by international consensus guidelines. There continues to be uncertainty regarding the precise QT interval cutoff that is should be used for diagnosis.

=== 12-lead ECG ===

The mainstay of diagnosis of short QT syndrome is the 12-lead ECG. The precise QT duration used to diagnose the condition remains controversial with consensus guidelines giving cutoffs varying from 330 ms, 340 ms or even 360 ms when other clinical, familial, or genetic factors are present. The QT interval normally varies with heart rate, but this variation occurs to a lesser extent in those with short QT syndrome. It is therefore recommended that the QT interval is assessed at heart rates close to 60 beats per minute. Other features that may be seen on the ECG in short QT syndrome include tall, peaked T-waves and PR segment depression.

=== Other features supporting diagnosis ===
Other features that support a diagnosis of short QT syndrome include: a history of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia despite an apparently structurally normal heart; a family history of confirmed short QT syndrome; a family history of sudden cardiac death aged &lt;40 years; and identification of a genetic mutation consistent with short QT syndrome.

Invasive electrophysiological studies, in which wires are passed into the heart to stimulate and record the heart&#x27;s electrical impulses, are not currently recommended for diagnosing short QT syndrome or predicting the risk of sudden cardiac death.

==Treatment==

The treatment for short QT syndrome is aimed at preventing abnormal heart rhythms and reducing the risk of sudden cardiac death. It has been difficult to experimentally test potential treatments as the condition is very rare, so the evidence for treatment effectiveness comes largely from consensus opinion. In addition to treating the person identified as having the condition, screening of family members may be recommended.

=== Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ===

In those with short QT syndrome who have already experienced a life-threatening abnormal heart rhythm such as ventricular fibrillation, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) may be recommended to reduce the chance of sudden death. This device is implanted under the skin and can continually monitor the heart rhythm. If the device detects a dangerous heart rhythm disturbance it can deliver a small electric shock with the aim of restoring a rhythm. Implanting an ICD in someone with short QT syndrome who has not yet experienced a life-threatening arrhythmia is more controversial but may be considered.

=== Medication ===
Medication aimed at correcting the ECG abnormality – the shortened QT interval – has been tried. Quinidine, a class Ia antiarrhythmic agent, has been shown to partially correct the QT interval and make the heart more resilient to artificially-induced abnormal heart rhythms, although it is still uncertain at present whether this translates to a lower risk of sudden death. Sotalol, another antiarrhythmic, may prolong the QT in some subtypes of short QT syndrome. Other medications including beta blockers, flecainide, and amiodarone have been tried, but at present there is little evidence to support their use.

Drugs can also be used to treat the less dangerous abnormal heart rhythm that is also associated with short QT – atrial fibrillation. Propafenone, a class 1c antiarrhythmic, may be helpful in those with short QT to prevent atrial fibrillation. Those who develop atrial fibrillation may also require medication to decrease blood clotting in order to reduce the risk of stroke.

== Epidemiology ==
Short QT syndrome is a very rare condition with, as of 2018, fewer than 300 cases described in the medical literature. As a genetic syndrome, those affected are born with the condition. Symptoms can occur in newborns, potentially presenting as sudden infant death syndrome. Males and females are equally likely to be affected, and have a similar risk of sudden cardiac death.

== Prognosis ==
The rarity of short QT syndrome makes calculating prognosis accurately difficult. The risk of sudden cardiac death has been estimated at 0.8% per year, leading to a cumulative risk of sudden cardiac death of 41% by the age of 40. A previous history of cardiac arrest predicts a higher likelihood of further dangerous arrhythmias. Some have suggested that those with the shortest QT intervals may have a higher risk of arrhythmias, but this view has not been supported by all. The findings from invasive electrophysiological studies do not predict an individual with short QT syndrome&#x27;s risk of cardiac arrest.

== History ==
The first report of short QT syndrome to be published was in 2000, describing a family with short QT intervals on the 12-lead ECG, atrial fibrillation occurring at a young age, and an unrelated patient who had a sudden cardiac death associated with a short QT interval. The association between short QT and sudden cardiac death was described in 2003, and the first gene associated with the condition was identified in 2004. Criteria for diagnosing Short QT syndrome were proposed in 2011. Recently the first animal model of short QT syndrome was presented, enabling more in depth analysis of arrhythmia mechanisms.

<text>Dam Square or the Dam () is a town square in Amsterdam, the capital and most populated city of the Netherlands. Its notable buildings and frequent events make it one of the best-known and most important locations in the city and the country.

== Location and description ==
Dam Square lies in the historical center of Amsterdam, approximately south of the main transportation hub, Centraal Station, at the original location of the dam in the river Amstel. It is roughly rectangular in shape, stretching about from west to east and about from north to south. It links the streets Damrak and Rokin, which run along the original course of the Amstel River from Centraal Station to Muntplein (Mint Square) and the Munttoren (Mint Tower). The Dam also marks the endpoint of the other well-traveled streets Nieuwendijk, Kalverstraat and Damstraat. A short distance beyond the northeast corner lies the main red-light district: De Wallen.

On the west end of the square is the neoclassical Royal Palace, which served as the city hall from 1655 until its conversion to a royal residence in 1808. Beside it are the 15th-century Gothic Nieuwe Kerk (New Church) and the Madame Tussauds Amsterdam Wax Museum. The National Monument, a white stone pillar designed by J.J.P. Oud and erected in 1956 to memorialize the victims of World War II, dominates the opposite side of the square. Also overlooking the plaza are the NH Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky and the upscale department store De Bijenkorf. These various attractions have turned the Dam into a tourist zone.

== History ==

The Dam derives its name from its original function: a dam on the Amstel River, hence also the name of the city of Amsterdam. Built in approximately 1270, the dam formed the first connection between the settlements on the sides of the river. The dam was originally built with a discharge sluice to allow control of the water level of the newly dammed river, but would soon be rebuilt with locks which also permitted navigation between the dammed river and the new harbor, the Damrak. The settlement first appeared in a document from 1275, concerning a road toll granted by the count of Holland Floris V to the residents &quot;apud Amestelledamme&quot; &#x27;at the dam in the Amstel&#x27; or &#x27;at the dam of Amstelland&#x27;.

As the dam was gradually built up it became wide enough for a town square, which remained the core of the town developing around it. Dam Square as it exists today grew out of what was originally two squares: the actual dam, called &quot;Middeldam&quot;, on which was located a large fish market (&quot;vismarkt&quot;) where ships moored at the dam to load and unload goods; and &quot;Plaetse&quot;, an adjacent plaza to the west. The area became a centre not only of commercial activity but also of the government, as the site of Amsterdam&#x27;s town hall.

As a market square, the Dam had a weigh house that can be seen in some old paintings. It was demolished in 1808 by order of Louis Bonaparte who, upon taking up residence in the newly converted Royal Palace, complained that his view was obstructed.

The Damrak, or the former mouth of the Amstel River, was partially filled in the 19th century; since then, the Dam square has been surrounded by land on all sides. The new land made room for the Beurs van Zocher, a stock exchange that was built in 1837. After the stock trade moved to the Beurs van Berlage in 1903, the Zocher building was demolished. In its place, De Bijenkorf department store has stood since 1914.

In 1856, a war memorial named &quot;De Eendracht&quot; (The Unity) was unveiled inside the square before King William III. A stone column with a female statue on top, the monument acquired the nickname &quot;Naatje of the Dam&quot;. It was taken down in 1914.

=== Dam Square shooting, 1945 ===
During World War II, the Netherlands were occupied by Nazi Germany. On 7 May 1945, two days after German capitulation, thousands of Dutch people were waiting for Canadian troops to arrive on the Dam square in Amsterdam. In the &quot;Grote Club&quot;, on the corner of Kalverstraat and Paleisstraat, members of the German Kriegsmarine watched as the crowd below their balcony grew and people danced and cheered. The Germans then placed a machine gun on the balcony and started shooting into the crowds. The motives behind the shooting have remained unclear; the Germans were drunk and possibly angered because contrary to previous agreement Dutch police had arrested members of the German military.

The shooting finally came to an end after a member of the Dutch resistance climbed into the tower of the royal palace and started shooting onto the balcony and into the club. At that moment, a German officer together with a Resistance commander found their way into the club and convinced the men to surrender. At the brink of peace, 120 people were badly injured and 22 pronounced dead. In 2013, evidence was brought to light that suggested the number may have been higher: possibly 33 people died, and there were 10 more unconfirmed possible victims.

=== Coronation riots, 1980 ===

Dam Square was the central scene of the largest post-war civil disturbance in the Netherlands during the Amsterdam coronation riots on 30 April 1980.

== Present ==

Several tram lines traverse the Dam and have stops there. In the time of the horse tram (end 19th century), the Dam was the most important tram hub of Amsterdam. After 1900, this function moved to the Central Station, at the other end of the Damrak.

Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, Amsterdam&#x27;s main square became a &quot;national&quot; square well known to nearly everyone in the Netherlands. It has frequently been the location of demonstrations and events of all kinds, and a meeting place for many people. On 4 May every year, the Dutch celebrate National Memorial Day (&quot;Nationale Dodenherdenking&quot;), in observance of which the last addition to the square, the National Monument, was set up in 1956.

A funfair was held on Dam Square for several years.

On 6 December 2003, Bulgarian mobster Konstantin &quot;Samokovetsa&quot; Dimitrov was shot dead on Dam Square.

On 7 November 2024, a series of attacks occurred against fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C. at Dam Square during their UEFA Europa League match against AFC Ajax.

<text>Joan of Bar (died 1361) was a French-English noble. She acted as regent of the County of Bar for her great-nephew Robert in 1353-1356. 
She was a daughter of Henry III, Count of Bar and Eleanor of England, and niece of Edward II of England. She was unhappily married to John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey.

==Life==

On 25 May 1306, Joan was married to one of the leading nobles of England, John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey, a &quot;nasty, brutal man with scarcely one redeeming quality&quot;. 
She lived at the Warenne family estates, Conisbrough Castle and Sandal Castle, abandoned by her husband, who since 1313 had been trying to divorce her. In England, she was close to Isabella of France, her aunt by marriage (Isabella’s husband Edward II was Joan’s maternal uncle) who was about her same age, and spent time with her at court. She was probably close to her cousin Elizabeth de Clare, who left Joan an image of John the Baptist in her will.

After four unhappy years of marriage, Warenne alleged in 1313 that the union was unlawful because Joan was related to him in the third and fourth degree, and because he had been &quot;precontracted&quot; to Maud of Nerford before marrying Joan. He was living openly with Maud by 1311. In 1313 the King arranged for his yeoman William Aune to take Joan from Conisbrough Castle, and bring her to him. Edward II of England then paid all Joan&#x27;s expenses while she lodged at the Tower of London. Despite Warenne&#x27;s claims, a divorce was never granted.

===Regency===
In 1345, Joan was invited by Philip VI of France to act as regent of the County of Bar for her great-nephew Edward II, Count of Bar. However, she was challenged by her nephew&#x27;s widow Yolande of Dampierre, who secured the regency instead.

Edward died in 1352 and his brother Robert was proclaimed duke at only seven years old. Political problems associated with his mother Yolande&#x27;s continued position as regent had arisen. Yolande was on the point of remarrying to Philip of Navarre, count of Longueville, a member of the Navarre family which was attempting to claim the French crown from John the Good. Joan of Bar, Robert&#x27;s grandaunt, made known to the king that she was ready to replace Yolande and assume the regency.

The Parlement of Paris, by decree of 5 June 1352, declared that the county was under the king&#x27;s control. John the Good then entrusted the regency to Joan on 27 July of that year. Yolande initially renounced the regency, but then went back on her decision, levying troops to fight Joan. John the Good intervened, to force Yolande to renounce the regency again on 2 July 1353. Joan ruled for another three years.

===Later life===
The defeat of Poitiers and the capture of John the Good in 1356 deprived Joan of John&#x27;s support, and Yolande retook the regency. Joan then returned to England. When John II of France was captured and imprisoned in London, she was allowed to visit him, and is said to have become his mistress.

Joan died in 1361 in London.

<text>Mirzapur() is a city in Uttar Pradesh, India. It is known for its carpets and brassware industries, and the tradition of kajari and birha music. Straddled by the Kaimur extension of Vindhya mountains, it served as the headquarters of the Mirzapur district. In the district, Vindhya mountains meet with Indo-Gangetic Plain.

== Geography ==
Mirzapur is located at . It has an average elevation of 80 metres (265 feet). Mirzapur lies between the parallels of 23.52 &amp; 25.32 North latitude and 82.7 and 83.33 East longitude. It forms a portion of the Varanasi district. On the north and north-east it is bounded by Varanasi district, on the south by Sonbhadra district and on the north-west by Prayagraj district. The shape to the north and west is totally regular. In no direction, except for about 13 km in the north-east where the Ganga separates the Tehsil of Chunar from the district of Varanasi, has Mirzapur a natural frontier. The Chanvar fields, considered to be one of the most fertile land tracts in India, are located on Gangetic flood plains of the district.

Indian Standard Time is calculated on the basis of 82.5° E longitude, from the Mirzapur Clock Tower.

== Demographics ==
 2011 census, Mirzapur-cum-Vindhyachal municipality had a population of 233,691 and the urban agglomeration had a population of 245,817. The municipality had a sex ratio of 869 females per 1,000 males and 11.9% of the population were under six years old. Effective literacy was 78.25%; male literacy was 83.85% and female literacy was 71.80%.
== Indian Standard Time calculation ==

Indian Standard Time is calculated from the clock tower in Mirzapur nearly exactly on the reference longitude of Indian Standard Time at 82°30&#x27;E, within 4 angular minutes, a property shared by Tuni, a town in Andhra Pradesh.
This is because there is a time lag of two hours between Gujarat and Arunachal Pradesh. Hence, this was taken as the Standard Meridian for the whole country.

== Education ==
Mirzapur benefits from a university, Rajiv Gandhi South Campus at Barkachha acquired by BHU, on lease in perpetuity from Bharat Mandal Trust in April 1979 with an area of 1104 hectare situated about 8 km South West of Mirzapur City.
At present RGSC (Rajiv Gandhi South Campus) is spread over 2700 acres and has been used to run special courses of Banaras Hindu University. Ambika Devi Senior Secondary School in Panwari Kalan is also located in Mirzapur.

== In popular culture ==
* The famous web series Mirzapur is inspired from the city with its name as well as for its carpet and brassware making industry.

<doc id="638654" wikidata="Q16987191" url="?curid=638654" title="International Third Position">
<text>International Third Position (ITP) was a neo-fascist organisation formed by the breakaway faction of the British National Front, led by Roberto Fiore, an ex-member of the Italian far-right movement Third Position.

==Development==
Though a key formulator of the Third Positionist platform, Nick Griffin left in 1990. After about four years he joined the British National Party (BNP), where he later succeeded the BNP founder John Tyndall. Other leading figures in the group on its foundation were Roberto Fiore and Derek Holland. Jason Wilcock would subsequently emerge as the group&#x27;s leader, although in 2001 he was reported in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; as having played a leading role in instigating the riots in Oldham.

Troy Southgate, as well as the majority of ITP supporters, split from the organisation in September 1992 after accusing Fiore and Holland of ideological hypocrisy and swindling members out of their life savings to prop up the group&#x27;s failed rural experiment in northern France. This included the departure of several local ITP publications, including &quot;The Kent Crusader&quot;, &quot;Surrey Action&quot;, and &quot;Eastern Legion&quot;. Southgate then founded the English Nationalist Movement (ENM) and during this time edited magazines like &quot;The Crusader&quot; and &quot;The English Alternative&quot;. The ENM had strong units in the Burnley, Bradford and south-east Kent areas.

The ITP changed its name to England First in 2001 and has since become a part of the European National Front with the Spanish Falange, Italian Forza Nuova, Romanian Noua Dreaptă, Polish National Revival of Poland and others.

An ITP/ENF gathering in central London in April 2005 drew 150 supporters. Overall membership is estimated by &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine to be somewhat lower than this, although the ITP maintains a relatively strong publishing presence as well as its network of international contacts. The modern party is much less critical of Islam than the rest of the British far-right, and claims that the campaign against Islam is mostly driven by Jewish interests. The party remains strongly anti-Semitic.

==Ideology==
ITP ideology is a mix of leftist and rightist ideas—&quot;e.g.&quot;, environmentalism, wealth redistribution—with a racialist slant. Initially the ITP distanced itself from traditional Fascism and Nazism, promoting &#x27;racial separatism&#x27; rather than crude racism. The International Third Position operated more as an elite cadre than a mass movement. Promoting a &quot;back to the land&quot; ideal of rural traditionalism, the group even purchased Los Pedriches, a remote Spanish village in 1997. This initiative was funded through a charity called Saint Michael the Archangel. Purporting to be an apolitical Roman Catholic charity, the group, which had several charity shops in the UK, was exposed as an ITP front in the press in 1999.

Publications supporting the ITP in the UK are &quot;Final Conflict&quot; (), &quot;The Voice of St George&quot;, &quot;Heritage and Destiny&quot; and &quot;Candour&quot;.

<text>Godda district is one of the twenty-four districts of Jharkhand state in eastern India. It lies in the northeastern part of the state. The geographical area that now comprises Godda district used to be part of the erstwhile Santhal Parganas district. Godda town is the headquarters of Godda district. The area of the district is 2110 km², with a population of around 1,313,551.

==Economy==
Godda is mostly famous for the Rajmahal coalfield in Lalmatia. It is an integral part of Jharkhand and is known for its hills and small forests. The mine present here is an integral part of ECL coalfields and is among the biggest in whole Asia.

Until the late 1980s Godda was full of forests and was a remote place far from science and technology and was living in a dark age as other districts of Jharkhand. The entire scenario changed after coal was first discovered in abundance under the Rajmahal Hills by a team of the Geological Survey of India. Central Mine Planning and Design Institute Ltd. conducted a detailed survey of the area. The Rajmahal Opencast Coal mine project was conceived in early 1980s, initially to supply coal to Farakka Super Thermal Power Project of NTPC, with an initial annual capacity of 5 million tonne. For expansion of this coal mine project to 10.5 million tonne per annum, an agreement was signed between Coal India Limited and Canadian Commercial Corporation in January 1989 where MET-CHEM Canada Inc. was designated as the Canadian Executing Agency for implementing the project. The Project was completed in July 1994 and is being run by Eastern Coalfileds Limited personnel. This mine is producing 11.5 million tonne coal per annum. This is being expanded further to 17 million tonne.

Two more opencast coal mine of Eastern Coalfields Limited are coming in Godda district, Chuperbhita opencast coal mine project (capacity - 4 million tonne) and Hurra &#x27;C&#x27; opencast coal mine project (capacity - 3 million tonne).

The main economic activity of the people is agriculture, and major crops are paddy, wheat and maize. The district is with rail link of Godda railway station. In 2006 the Indian government named Godda one of the country&#x27;s 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640). It is one of the 21 districts in Jharkhand receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF).

<text>The Pyramid (Moriori: ; ; officially The Pyramid (Tarakoikoia)) is a small island south of Pitt Island in the Chatham Islands group of New Zealand. The site has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports the only known breeding colony of Chatham albatrosses, with 4575 pairs recorded in 2001.

Based on the 180th meridian, it is the southwesternmost point of land in the world outside of Antarctica; if the International Date Line is used instead, however, Niue has that honour.

<text>The Authority is a superhero comic book series published by DC Comics under the Wildstorm imprint. It was created in 1999 by Warren Ellis and Bryan Hitch, and follows the adventures of the Authority, a superhero team mainly composed of Ellis-created characters from &quot;Stormwatch&quot;.

The team will appear in various media set in the DC Universe (DCU) media franchise. Angela Spica / Engineer will appear in the upcoming film &quot;Superman&quot; (2025) portrayed by María Gabriela de Faría, while the team will additionally headline a self-titled film in development.

==Publication history==
===Volume 1===

====Ellis/Hitch run====
In 1999, Warren Ellis and Bryan Hitch created the Authority, a team of superheroes who got the job done by any means necessary. The original line-up consisted of Jenny Sparks, a British woman who could generate and turn into electricity; Jack Hawksmoor, who was psychically bonded to cities in order to communicate with them and receive powers from them; Swift, a Tibetan woman who possessed wings and sharp talons; Apollo, a bio-engineered Superman pastiche; Midnighter, a bio-engineered Batman pastiche who possessed the ability to foresee his opponents&#x27; moves in combat; The Engineer, a scientist who had replaced her blood with nine pints of nanotechnology and could create solid objects with it; and The Doctor, a Dutch drug addict and shaman who possessed the combined powers of the hundreds of shamans who came before him. On the creation of the series, Ellis noted:

The Ellis/Hitch run of &quot;The Authority&quot; lasted 12 issues, divided into three four-issue story arcs: &quot;The Circle&quot;, &quot;Shiftships&quot;, and &quot;Outer Dark&quot;. &quot;Outer Dark&quot; ended with team leader Jenny Sparks, thought to be the Spirit of the 20th Century, dying in the final minutes of December 31, 1999, as the 20th Century ended and the 21st began.

====Millar/Quitely run====

Replacing Ellis and Hitch after issue #12 were writer Mark Millar and artist Frank Quitely. Tom Peyer and Dustin Nguyen worked on a four-issue fill-in arc, and Arthur Adams drew two of the final three issues of Millar&#x27;s run and Gary Erskine drew the final issue, #29.

During the Millar/Quitely run, the Authority was now under Jack Hawksmoor&#x27;s leadership following Jenny Sparks&#x27; death at the end of the 20th century. They faced multiple foes such as a mad scientist and his army of superhumans who wanted to influence the 21st Century through Jenny Sparks&#x27; successor Jenny Quantum, a previous Doctor who manipulated the Earth itself, and a duplicate team of superheroes modeled on the Authority that was created and backed by the G7 group of nations. Also during the run, Jenny Quantum was adopted by Apollo and Midnighter after they were married and the Doctor worked through his heroin addiction after faltering in battle.

A number of panels and covers during the Millar/Quitely run, which was published in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, were censored by DC Comics. During Millar and Quitely&#x27;s first arc, red filters were used to obscure particularly violent panels. DC also ordered a scene in which Apollo and Midnighter kiss be completely removed, and a character based on Marvel Comics&#x27; Captain America be redesigned, subsequently re-drawn and recolored on the cover to issue #14 to differentiate between the two. DC would order Adams&#x27; work on the final issues of the volume be substantially re-drawn, the more significant examples being a scene depicting leader of the G7 Authority, The Colonel, about to perform a sexual act on Jenny Sparks&#x27; severely-decomposed corpse that was re-drawn and Millar&#x27;s dialogue was re-written to remove any depiction or mention of necrophilia; a panel in which G7 Authority member Teuton kills multiple people by flying through them, that was re-drawn as two separate and less graphic panels; multiple panels in which Teuton gropes Apollo against his will and is then killed in a particularly gory fashion, which were re-drawn so as not to show the groping and to make Teuton&#x27;s death scene less explicit; a series of panels depicting Swift being humiliated, which had sexual overtones, and was re-drawn so as to soften the scene; and a panel in which George W. Bush was depicted that was re-drawn so the character who appears as the President of the United States would not resemble Bush.

===Volume 2===
The series was subsequently restarted, (with a planned &quot;Mature Readers&quot; relaunch by Brian Azzarello and Glenn Fabry being scrapped in the wake of 9/11), and was written by Robbie Morrison with art by Dwayne Turner (except for the single issue &quot;Behemoth&quot;, which featured art by Tan Eng Huat, and &quot;Street Life&quot;, which was penciled by Whilce Portacio). This incarnation of the series lasted for 15 issues, including issues 1–14 and the series of back-ups that ran through Stormwatch: &quot;Team Achilles&quot; #9, &quot;Sleeper&quot; #3 and &quot;Wildcats v3.0&quot; #8 which were eventually published as issue 0. Prior to issue 10, the series was part of the &quot;Coup d&#x27;état&quot; crossover that included &quot;The Authority&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Sleeper&quot;, and &quot;Wildcats v3.0&quot;. The crossover revolved around the Authority taking over the United States of America.

===&quot;Revolution&quot;===
The series was again restarted in October 2004 as &quot;The Authority: Revolution&quot;, a twelve issue mini-series written by Ed Brubaker and drawn by Dustin Nguyen and Richard Friend that focused on the troubles the Authority faced as the rulers of America.

===Volume 3===

====Morrison/Ha run====
 In February 2006, it was announced that Grant Morrison would write &quot;The Authority Volume 3&quot;, with art by Gene Ha. The series was intended to be published bimonthly, beginning in October 2006. Morrison &quot;cited Warren Ellis’s original run as an approach they wanted to return to, saying their new approach will allow the team to be effectual again&quot;.

Morrison and Ha&#x27;s first issue was released in December 2006. It followed a family man named Ken in his search for a downed submarine that encountered something massive and unexpected in the depths of the ocean that caused it to be destroyed. When Ken finds the ship, many of the crew are missing. The issue ends as Ken and his search party encounters the Authority&#x27;s Carrier, 50 miles long, lying on the ocean floor.

The second issue came out five months after the first and dealt with the Authority&#x27;s reaction to crash-landing on a less developed Earth than theirs. Ken meets The Authority but begins to question their methodology.

In September 2007, Gene Ha was quoted at &quot;Newsarama&quot; as saying that he did not believe his run with Morrison would continue. &quot;...I don&#x27;t think &quot;The Authority&quot; #3 by Grant Morrison and Gene Ha is ever coming out. Grant is busy redesigning the DC Universe and I&#x27;ve moved onto new projects. Most importantly, it seems that editor Scott Dunbier has been forced out of Wildstorm. There is no #3 script, there may never be a #3 script.&quot;

Scott Peterson announced at Wondercon 2008 that he had talked to Morrison two weeks earlier about &quot;The Authority&quot;, and there was &quot;very serious progress&quot; and it would start shipping again toward the end of the year. When asked to comment upon their inability to complete further issues of &quot;The Authority&quot;, Morrison has said &#x27;&quot;Authority was just a disaster.&quot; They said that they were doing it and running late when &quot;52&quot; started, but when they saw the reviews to the first issue, &quot;I said fuck it.&quot;&#x27;

====&quot;The Lost Year&quot;====
On 19 April 2008, Wildstorm announced Keith Giffen would complete Grant Morrison&#x27;s scripts. Giffen ran into an immediate problem: &quot;I stepped into a book that was in the midst of a type of storyline that is probably my least favorite in comics. And that is, heroes come to our earth&quot;. However, according to Giffen, this was only the first short arc of the longer story:

The remaining issues of volume 3 were published by Wildstorm under the title &quot;The Authority: The Lost Year&quot;. Giffen was credited alongside Morrison as the writer, with several artists contributing. Eventually, J. M. DeMatteis joined the creative team for a few issues as co-writer. The series ran a total of twelve issues, including the original two by Morrison.

===Prime===
In July 2007, it was announced that Christos Gage and Darick Robertson would do an intended storyarc as a miniseries due to the scheduling problems with the Morrison/Ha run on the title. The resulting six-issue miniseries entitled &quot;The Authority: Prime&quot; was planned to have spanned issues #6 to #11 of &quot;The Authority&quot; (vol. 3). It featured the renewed Stormwatch Prime who, along with the Authority, investigate a recently discovered secret bunker that once belonged to Henry Bendix.

===Volume 4===

====Abnett/Lanning/Coleby era====

Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning relaunched the book in May 2008 in the wake of the &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot; event and took over the writing duties, accompanied by artist Simon Coleby, writing the first seventeen issues of the series. Senior Wildstorm editor Ben Abernathy also said of four issues that had already been completed by the new team, &quot;I can say honestly, based on the four issues of script and art that are already in the can, people will NOT be disappointed!&quot;

Abnett and Lanning&#x27;s contract with Marvel Comics included a clause which allowed them to finish their existing projects, including their run on &quot;The Authority&quot;.

====Bernardin/Freeman/Barrionuevo era====
Writers Marc Bernardin &amp; Adam Freeman and artist Al Barrionuevo worked on the book for a four-issue run from #18 to #21, including the epilogue in issue 17.

====Taylor/Barrionuevo era====
Writer Tom Taylor (writer of several &quot;Star Wars&quot; titles including the &quot;Star Wars: Invasion&quot; series) took over &quot;The Authority&quot; with issue #22, (with artist Mike S. Miller filling in for two issues for Al Barrinuevo), until the series concluded with #29.

===Superman and the Authority===
After Wildstorm was eventually merged with DC&#x27;s mainline universe, the Authority would be reintroduced during the Infinite Frontier era, in a short miniseries known as &quot;Superman and the Authority&quot;, by Grant Morrison and Mikel Janen. In this miniseries, Superman and Manchester Black (whose previous team the Elite was a reference to the Authority) assemble a new incarnation of the Authority to liberate Warworld from Mongul.

==Storylines==
==Members==
The founding members of the Authority were:
*Jenny Sparks, &quot;The Spirit of the Twentieth Century&quot;; the group&#x27;s founder and original leader.
*Apollo, &quot;The Sun God&quot;.
*Midnighter a.k.a. Lucas Trent, &quot;Night&#x27;s Bringer of War&quot;.
*The Doctor a.k.a. Jeroen Thornedike, &quot;The Shaman&quot;.
*The second a.k.a. Angela Spica, &quot;The Maker&quot;.
*, &quot;The God of Cities&quot;; leader of the Authority from 2000 to 2005, and again from 2008 to 2010.
*Swift a.k.a. Shen Li-Min, &quot;The Winged Huntress&quot;.

Following the &quot;Outer Dark&quot; story arc, Jenny Sparks was replaced with:
*, &quot;The Spirit of the 21st Century&quot;; leader of the Authority from 2005 to 2008.

At the end of the &quot;Revolution&quot; maxi-series, the Authority gained two new members:
*The Doctor a.k.a. Habib ben Hassan, &quot;The Shaman&quot;; Thornedike&#x27;s successor and
*Rose Tattoo, &quot;The Spirit of Life&quot;; formerly &quot;The Spirit of Murder&quot;, the personification of the act of murder, and seemingly capable of killing anyone; member of Stormwatch.

Beginning with #18 of volume four the team roster underwent a major change. Jack Hawksmoor, Swift and Engineer remained on the team, where they were joined by new members:
*Synergy a.k.a. Christine Trelane; formerly Stormwatch&#x27;s activator, capable of activating or temporarily removing Seedlings&#x27; powers; their second Weatherman until Henry Bendix&#x27;s return; and second-in-command under Jackson King.
*Deathblow a.k.a. Michael Cray; former member of Team 7.
*Flint a.k.a. Victoria Ngengi; former member of Stormwatch.
*Freefall a.k.a. Roxanne Spaulding; former member of Gen¹³.
*Grifter a.k.a. Cole Cash; former member of the Wildcats and Team 7.
*The High a.k.a. John Cumberland; one of the first super-heroes active in America during the 1930s and &#x27;40s, long thought to be an urban legend, and former member of the radical super-human group The Changers.
*Rainmaker a.k.a. Sarah Rainmaker; former member of Gen 13.

The Authority&#x27;s base of operations is the Carrier, a sentient, gigantic, interdimensional &quot;shiftship&quot; existing everywhere on Earth at the same time and capable of moving through every imaginable plane of existence.

When the Authority was assembled in the &quot;Superman and the Authority&quot; series, the group would operate out of the Fortress of Solitude, where the artificial intelligence Kelex could aid them. In addition to Apollo and Midnighter, several characters created for DC comics would become members of this version of the team. These members were:
*Superman, one of Earth&#x27;s leading heroes, the owner of the Fortress of Solitude, one of the survivors of the destruction of Krypton, and the team&#x27;s new founder.
*Manchester Black, a former enemy of Superman and leader of the Elite who possesses telepathic powers.

<doc id="638662" wikidata="Q7420152" url="?curid=638662" title="Santhal Pargana division">
<text>Santhal Pargana division constitutes six district administration units known as the divisions of Jharkhand state in eastern India.

==Origin of name==
Santal Pargana derives its name from two words: &quot;Santal&quot;, a major inhabited tribe in the region and Pargana, a unit of administration in Persian language used mostly by medieval rulers.

==Location==
Santal Pargana is one of the divisions of Jharkhand. Its headquarters is at Dumka. Presently, this administrative division comprises six districts: Godda, Deoghar, Dumka, Jamtara, Sahibganj and Pakur.
==History==
This region is mentioned as Kajangala in different ancient literatures specially in Buddhist literatures. 
It is mentioned that the Chinese monk-traveller Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang) travelled from Champa (recent Bhagalpur) to Kajangala and then proceeded to Pundravardhana (recent Bangladesh) in the 7th century AD. He says that the northern limit of its territory (means Sahebganj) was not very far from the Ganges. The forests to the south had plenty of elephants. The people were straight forward, talented and devoted to education.

In the system of Permanent Settlement, British encourage paharia of Rajmahal hills to practice settled agriculture but they refused to cut trees. Then British officials attracted attention to Santals who were ready to clear the forests for settled agriculture. In 1832, a large number of area demarcated as Damin-i-koh. Santal from Cuttack, Dhalbhum, Birbhum, Manbhum, Hazaribagh migrated, clear forest tracts and started cultivating these lands as peasants. British collected tax from Santals as revenue. The imposition of taxes, exploitation by Zamindar and money lenders sparked Santal rebellion. The Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu, two brothers organized and led Santal inhabitants for the Santal Revolt (Santal Hul) against the Britishers but were defeated. Their other siblings namely Chand Murmu, Bhairo Murmu, Phulo Murmu, Jhano Murmu also followed elder brothers leadership for fighting against injustice.
In 1855, during British India, Santal Parganas was created as a district, and was a part of the Bengal Presidency. Santal Parganas was a district, in undivided Bihar state, upgraded to a division in 1983. As a consequence of Santal uprising, the British passed the Santhal Parganas Tenancy Act ,1876 which offered some protection for the tribals against exploitation. It prohibits the sale of Adivasi land to non-Adivasis in the Santal Pargana region along present day Jharkhand&#x27;s border with West Bengal. After Independence of India, the Santal Pargana Tenancy Act, 1949 is the first codified law of tenancy in Santal Pargana division of Jharkhand. When enacted, it supplemented existing British-era tenancy laws and codified some of the customary laws related to tribal land.

==Demographics==
===Languages===

It has a population of 6,969,097. Santali, Bengali and Hindi are mostly spoken national languages, followed by regional dialect Khorta.

===Religion===

Majority of the population follows Hinduism. Sari Dharam is followed by the Santal tribe residents and Sarna by other tribe. (The percentage will notified soon official sooner the Govt. Of India accomplishes recent Census).
