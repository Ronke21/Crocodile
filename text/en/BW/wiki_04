<text>Prednisolone is a corticosteroid, a steroid hormone used to treat certain types of allergies, inflammatory conditions, autoimmune disorders, and cancers, electrolyte imbalances and skin conditions. Some of these conditions include adrenocortical insufficiency, high blood calcium, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatitis, eye inflammation, asthma, multiple sclerosis, and phimosis. It can be taken by mouth, injected into a vein, used topically as a skin cream, or as eye drops. It differs from the similarly named prednisone in having a hydroxyl at the 11th carbon instead of a ketone.
Common side effects with short-term use include nausea, difficulty concentrating, insomnia, increased appetite, and fatigue. More severe side effects include psychiatric problems, which may occur in about 5% of people. Common side effects with long-term use include bone loss, weakness, yeast infections, and easy bruising. While short-term use in the later part of pregnancy is safe, long-term use or use in early pregnancy is occasionally associated with harm to the baby. It is a glucocorticoid made from hydrocortisone (cortisol).
Prednisolone was discovered and approved for medical use in 1955. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic drug. In 2022, it was the 136th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
When used in low doses, corticosteroids serve as an anti-inflammatory agent. At higher doses, they are considered as immunosuppressants. Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and, it is presumed, delay or slow healing. They inhibit edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation.

===Systemic use===
Prednisolone is a corticosteroid drug with predominant glucocorticoid and low mineralocorticoid activity, making it useful for the treatment of a wide range of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions such as asthma, uveitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, rheumatoid arthritis, urticaria, angioedema, ulcerative colitis, pericarditis, temporal arteritis, Crohn&#x27;s disease, Bell&#x27;s palsy, multiple sclerosis, cluster headaches, vasculitis, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, autoimmune hepatitis, lupus, Kawasaki disease, dermatomyositis, post-myocardial infarction syndrome, and sarcoidosis.

Prednisolone can also be used for allergic reactions ranging from seasonal allergies to drug allergic reactions.

Prednisolone can also be used as an immunosuppressant for organ transplants.

Prednisolone in lower doses can be used in cases of adrenal insufficiency due to Addison&#x27;s disease.

===Topical use===
Ophthalmology
Topical prednisolone is mainly used in the ophthalmic pathway as eye drops in numerous eye conditions, including corneal injuries caused by chemicals, burns, and alien objects, inflammation of the eyes, mild to moderate non-infectious allergies, disorders of the eyelid, conjunctiva or sclera, ocular inflammation caused by operation and optic neuritis. Some side effects include glaucoma, blurred vision, eye discomfort, impaired recovery of injured site, scarring of the optic nerve, cataracts, and urticaria. However, their prevalence is not known.

Prednisolone eye drops are contraindicated in individuals who develop hypersensitivity reactions against prednisolone, or individuals with the current conditions, such as tuberculosis of the eye, shingles affecting the eye, raised intraocular pressure, and eye infection caused by fungus.

Prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension (eye drops) is prepared as a sterile ophthalmic suspension and used to reduce swelling, redness, itching, and allergic reactions affecting the eye. It has been explored as a treatment option for bacterial keratitis.

Prednisolone eye drops are used in conjunctivitis caused by allergies and bacteria, marginal keratitis, uveitis, endophthalmitis, which is an infection of the eye involving the aqueous humor, Graves&#x27; ophthalmopathy, herpes zoster ocular infection, inflammation of the eye after surgery, and corneal injuries caused by chemicals, radiation, thermal burns, or penetration of foreign objects. It is also used in the prevention of myringosclerosis, herpes simplex stromal keratitis. Topical prednisolone can also be used after procedures such as Laser Peripheral Iridotomy for patients with primary angle-closure suspects (PACS) to control inflammations.

Ear drops

In addition, topical prednisolone can also be administered as ear drops. 

==Adverse effects==
Adverse reactions from the use of prednisolone include:
* Increased appetite, weight gain, nausea, and malaise
* Increased risk of infection
* Cardiovascular events
* Dermatological effects including reddening of the face, bruising/skin discoloration, impaired wound healing, skin atrophy, skin rash, edema, and abnormal hair growth
* Hyperglycemia; patients with diabetes may need increased insulin or diabetic therapies
* Menstrual abnormalities
* Lower response to hormones, especially during stressful instances such as surgery or illness
* Change in electrolytes: rise in blood pressure, increased sodium and low potassium, leading to alkalosis
* Gastrointestinal system effects: swelling of the stomach lining, reversible increase in liver enzymes, and risk of stomach ulcers
* Muscular and skeletal abnormalities, such as muscle weakness/muscle loss, osteoporosis (see steroid-induced osteoporosis), long bone fractures, tendon rupture, and back fractures
* Neurological effects, including involuntary movements (convulsions), headaches, and vertigo
* Psychosocial behavioral and emotional disturbances with aggression being one of the most common cognitive symptoms, especially with oral use.
* Nasal septum perforation and bowel perforation (in some pathologic conditions).

Discontinuing prednisolone after long-term or high-dose use can lead to adrenal insufficiency.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Although there are no major human studies of prednisolone use in pregnant women, studies in several animals show that it may cause birth defects including increased likelihood of cleft palate.

Prednisolone is found in the breast milk of mothers taking prednisolone.

=== Local adverse effects in the eye ===

When used topically on the eye, the following are potential side effects:
* Cataracts: Extended usage of corticosteroids may cause clouding at the back of the lens, also known as posterior subcapsular cataract. This type of cataract reduces the path of light from reaching the eye, which interferes with a person&#x27;s reading vision. Consumption of prednisolone eye drops post-surgery may also retard the healing process.
* Corneal thinning: When corticosteroids are used in the long term, corneal and scleral thinning is also one of its consequences. When not ceased, thinning may ultimately lead to perforation of the cornea.
* Glaucoma: Elongated use of corticosteroids has a chance of causing a raised intraocular pressure (IOP), injuring the optic nerve, and weakening visual awareness. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with concomitant conditions of glaucoma. Doctors track patients&#x27; IOP if they are using corticosteroid eye drops for more than 103 days.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
As a glucocorticoid, the lipophilic structure of prednisolone allows for easy passage through the cell membrane where it then binds to its respective glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) located in the cytoplasm. Upon binding, the formation of the GC/GCR complex causes dissociation of chaperone proteins from the glucocorticoid receptor enabling the GC/GCR complex to translocate inside the nucleus. This process occurs within 20 minutes of binding. Once inside the nucleus, the homodimer GC/GCR complex binds to specific DNA binding sites known as glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) resulting in gene expression or inhibition. Complex binding to positive GREs leads to the synthesis of anti-inflammatory proteins while binding to negative GREs blocks the transcription of inflammatory genes. They inhibit the release of signals that promote inflammation such as nuclear factor-Kappa B (NF-κB), Activator protein 1 (AP-1), nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), and stimulate anti-inflammatory signals such as the interleukin-10 gene. All of them will collectively cause a sequence of events, including the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and additional inflammatory mediators. Glucocorticoids also inhibit neutrophil cell death and . As well as phospholipase A2, which in turn lessens arachidonic acid derivative genesis.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Prednisolone has a relatively short half-life, ranging 2–4 hours. It also has a large therapeutic window, considering the dosage required to produce a therapeutic effect is a few times higher than what the body naturally produces.

Prednisolone is 70–90% plasma protein bound, it binds to proteins such as albumin.

Both prednisolone phosphate and prednisolone acetate go through ester hydrolysis in the body to form prednisolone. It subsequently undergoes the usual metabolism of prednisolone. Concomitant use of prednisolone and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole is shown to cause a rise in plasma prednisolone concentrations by about 50% owing to a diminished clearance.

Prednisolone predominantly undergoes kidney elimination and is excreted in the urine as sulphate and metabolites of glucuronide conjugate.

===Prednisone===
Prednisone is a prodrug that is activated in the liver. When it enters the body, prednisone is triggered by the liver and body chemicals to turn into its active form, prednisolone.

==Chemistry==
Prednisolone is a synthetic pregnane corticosteroid closely related to its cognate prednisone, having identical structure save for two fewer hydrogens near C11. It is also known as δ1-cortisol, δ1-hydrocortisone, 1,2-dehydrocortisol, or 1,2-dehydrohydrocortisone, as well as 11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione.

== Interactions ==
Co-administration of prednisolone eye drops with ophthalmic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may perhaps exacerbate its effects, causing unwanted side effects such as toxicity. The wound healing process may also be hindered.

Drug interactions of prednisolone include other immunosuppressants like azathioprine or ciclosporin, antiplatelet drugs like clopidogrel, anticoagulants like dabigatran or warfarin, or NSAIDs such as aspirin, celecoxib, or ibuprofen.

== Special populations ==

=== Children ===
Prolonged use of prednisolone eye drops in children may lead to raised intraocular pressure. While this phenomenon is dose-dependent, it is shown to have a greater effect, especially in children under 6 years of age.

=== Pregnancy and breastfeeding ===
Research on animal reproduction has indicated that there is a trace of teratogenicity when doses are reduced by 10 times the human recommended dose. There is no sufficient information on human pregnancy at this moment. Use is only recommended when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks for the pregnant mother and the fetus.

Prednisolone when delivered systemically can be found in the mother&#x27;s breast milk, however, there is no data provided for the extent of prednisolone found in the system after administering eye drops. However, the presence of corticosteroids is recorded when they are administered systemically, and it could affect the fetus&#x27; growth. Therefore, the use of prednisolone during breastfeeding is not advocated.

==Society and culture==

===Dosage forms===
Prednisolone is supplied as oral liquid, oral suspension, oral syrup, oral tablet, and oral disintegrating tablet. It may be a generic medication or supplied as brands Flo-Pred (prednisolone acetate oral suspension), Millipred (oral tablets), Orapred (prednisolone sodium phosphate oral dissolving tablets), Pediapred (prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution), Veripred 20, Prelone, Hydeltra-T.B.A., Hydeltrasol, Key-Pred, Cotolone, Predicort, Medicort, Predcor, Bubbli-Pred, Omnipred, P-Pred (prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension), Pred Mild, Pred Forte, and others.

===Athletics===
As a glucocorticosteroid, unauthorized or ad hoc use of prednisolone during competition via oral, intravenous, intramuscular, or rectal routes is banned under World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) anti-doping rules.

==Veterinary uses==
Prednisolone is used in the treatment of inflammatory and allergic conditions in cats, dogs, horses, small mammals such as ferrets, birds, and reptiles. Its usage in treating inflammation, immune-mediated disease, Addison&#x27;s disease, and neoplasia is often considered off-label use. Many drugs are commonly prescribed for off-label use in veterinary medicine.&quot; Studies in ruminating species, such as alpacas, have shown that oral administration of the drug is associated with a reduced bioavailability compared to intravenous administration; however, levels that are therapeutic in other species can be achieved with oral administration in alpacas.

It is used in a broad spectrum of diseases, for example, inflammation of scleral tissues, cornea, and conjunctiva in dogs. In horses, prednisolone acetate suspensions are priorly used to treat inflammation in the middle layer of the eye, also known as anterior uveitis and equine recurrent uveitis (ERU), which is the leading cause of visual impairment in horses. Prednisolone acetate eye drops are not to be used in other animals such as birds.

Prednisolone acetate eye drops are also prescribed to dogs and cats to lessen swelling, redness, burning, and pain sensations after surgeries of the eye.

Cats with conjunctivitis usually are required to avoid using ophthalmic preparations of corticosteroids and its derivatives. The most typical infections are caused by herpes virus.

<doc id="634318" wikidata="Q3046338" url="?curid=634318" title="Eagle (British comics)">
<text>Eagle was a British children&#x27;s comics periodical, first published from 1950 to 1969, and then in a relaunched format from 1982 to 1994. It was founded by Marcus Morris, an Anglican vicar from Lancashire. Morris edited a Southport parish magazine called &quot;The Anvil&quot;, but felt that the church was not communicating its message effectively. Simultaneously disillusioned with contemporary children&#x27;s literature, he and &quot;Anvil&quot; artist Frank Hampson created a dummy comic based on Christian values. Morris proposed the idea to several Fleet Street publishers, with little success, until Hulton Press took it on.

Following a huge publicity campaign, the first issue of &quot;Eagle&quot; was released in April 1950. Revolutionary in its presentation and content, it was enormously successful; the first issue sold about 900,000 copies. Featured in colour on the front cover was its most recognisable story, &quot;Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future&quot;, created by Hampson with meticulous attention to detail. Other popular stories included &quot;Riders of the Range&quot; and &quot;P.C. 49&quot;. &quot;Eagle&quot; also contained news and sport sections, and educational cutaway diagrams of sophisticated machinery. A members club was created, and a range of related merchandise was licensed for sale.

Amidst a takeover of the periodical&#x27;s publisher and a series of acrimonious disputes, Morris left in 1959; Hampson followed shortly thereafter. Although &quot;Eagle&quot; continued in various forms, a perceived lowering of editorial standards preceded plummeting sales, and it was eventually subsumed by its rival, &quot;Lion&quot;, in 1969. &quot;Eagle&quot; was relaunched in 1982 and ran for over 500 issues before being dropped by its publisher in 1994.

==History==
===Background===
&quot;Eagle&quot; was founded by John Marcus Harston Morris (1915–1989). Morris was born in the Lancashire town of Preston, and in 1918 moved to Southport. He graduated from Brasenose College, Oxford with a second-class degree in &quot;Literae Humaniores&quot;, and at Wycliffe Hall gained a second in theology in 1939. He became a priest the following year, and served as a chaplain in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve from 1941 to 1943.

In 1945 he became vicar of St. James&#x27; Church in Birkdale. Morris had long felt that the Anglican church was not publicising its message effectively enough; four years earlier he had written an unpublished article, intended for the &quot;Yarmouth Mercury&quot; and entitled &quot;Christian Hypocrisy&quot;, in which he questioned the difference that the Christian church had made to society in general. Morris also felt that the church was completely out of touch with the people whom it was supposed to represent. He gradually expanded the parish magazine—printed on four pages of cheap paper— into &quot;The Anvil&quot;, a widely circulated Christian magazine based on the humour and arts magazine &quot;Lilliput&quot;. Morris managed to employ several notable contributors on &quot;Anvil&quot;, such as C. S. Lewis and Harold Macmillan.

In 1948 he employed young artist Frank Hampson, a war veteran who had enrolled at the Southport School of Arts and Crafts, where he was described by his tutor as an &quot;outstanding draughtsman &#x27;prepared to go to endless trouble to get a thing right. He worked as the illustrator on &quot;Anvil&quot;, and later became the full-time artist for Interim, a Christian publicity society formed during a conference of diocesan editors, with ambitions to produce a strip cartoon magazine aimed at children.

Children&#x27;s comics such as &quot;The Rover&quot;, &quot;The Hotspur&quot;, &quot;Schoolgirls&#x27; Own&quot;, &quot;The Magnet&quot; and &quot;Adventure&quot; usually contained a mixture of adventure stories, presented as text rather than strip cartoons, and some British boys were buying American horror comics produced for G.I.s. Morris was impressed by the high standard of artwork in the US magazines, but disgusted by their content, which he described as &quot;deplorable, nastily over-violent and obscene, often with undue emphasis on the supernatural and magical as a way of solving problems&quot;. He realised that a market existed for a children&#x27;s comics periodical which featured action stories in cartoon form, but which also would convey to children the standards and morals he advocated.

Morris was instrumental in launching the short-lived Society for Christian Publicity, formed to take control of &quot;The Anvil&quot; and to perhaps produce further Christian publications, and in January 1949 the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; published an optimistic piece about the rumoured publication by the Society of a &quot;new children&#x27;s comic&quot;. This intrigued local journalist Norman Price, and the following month he met Morris, and helped him express his desire to see such a magazine by co-writing with him &quot;comics that bring horror to the nursery&quot;, published in the &quot;Sunday Dispatch&quot;. Morris&#x27;s article provoked a strong reaction from its readers; letters of support flooded into his home.

Morris envisioned a character called Lex Christian, &quot;a tough, fighting parson in the slums of the East End of London&quot;, whose adventures would be told in strip cartoon form, illustrated by Hampson. The idea gained the support of Terence Horsley, editor of the &quot;Sunday Empire News&quot;, but Horsley was killed in a gliding accident shortly thereafter. Morris suggested to Hampson that they instead create an entirely new children&#x27;s publication. Hampson was enthusiastic about the idea, and in May that year the two began work on a dummy of it. Lex Christian became Chaplain Dan Dare of the Inter-Planet Patrol, and featured on the cover. On the inside, two pages of Secret City featured a character named Jimmy Swift, and on the back page was a religious story about Saint Paul. Short strips included Joe from Strawberry Farm and Ernie, Always Unlucky. Other features included Morris&#x27;s Editor&#x27;s Letter and a range of news articles. Three photocopies of the dummy were made, each hand-coloured by Hampson.
By then deeply in debt from the publication of &quot;The Anvil&quot; and the production costs of the dummy, Morris formed Anvil Productions Ltd. Its prospectus declared: &quot;The Company proposes to publish a new children&#x27;s coloured &#x27;comic&#x27; paper, which will be of a much higher and more mature quality than anything published in England and in appearance and format will be modelled more on the American comic papers which are so far in advance of our own&quot;. Initially he sought to keep the project under his control, but his escalating debts forced him to try to sell the idea. To that end, he made several trips to London, where—armed with the dummy—he pitched his idea to several Fleet Street publishers. He met John Myers at Hulton Press, who referred him to Montague Haydon at Amalgamated Press. He then met Neville Pearson at George Newnes, Ltd., whose executives claimed that the publication was &quot;not an economic proposition&quot;. The US comics reprinter Boardmans was next, followed by Mike Wardell of the &quot;Sporting Record&quot;. Neither &quot;The Times&quot; nor &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; were interested, and at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; the personal assistant to Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount Kemsley, presumed that Morris was asking for a charitable donation. In autumn 1949 however, Hulton Press contacted Morris with the instruction &quot;definitely interested do not approach any other publisher&quot;.

===1950–1969===

In October that year Morris sold &quot;The Anvil&quot;—by then selling about 3,560 copies monthly—for £1,250, plus a £200 annual contract to continue as editor. Morris wanted to produce a comic the pages of which would be filled with role models whose behaviour and moral outlook he felt was socially desirable. Foreigners would not be depicted as either enemies or villains, and at least one child in any group of children would be from an ethnic minority. Religious values would not be imposed upon the reader, although their underlying moral tones would be made obvious on each page. These were innovative but somewhat risky ideas, as nothing similar existed in the market, and Hulton therefore commissioned extensive research into the new comic, which by then, inspired by the design of her church lectern, had been christened &quot;Eagle&quot; by Hampson&#x27;s wife. Layout and typography were designed by Morris&#x27;s friend, Ruari McLean, assisted by Charles Green, and faced with an initial print run of 1 million copies, Aintree printer Eric Bemrose designed and built a new ten-unit rotogravure machine in about twelve weeks.

The comic was heavily publicised before its release; copies were mailed direct to several hundred thousand people who worked with children, and a &quot;Hunt the Eagle&quot; scheme was launched, whereby large papier-mâché golden eagles were set on top of several Humber Hawk cars, and toured across the UK. Those who spotted an eagle were offered tokens worth 3d, which could be exchanged at newsagents for a free copy of &quot;Eagle&quot;.

Despite its relatively high price, the comic was an immediate success; released on 14 April 1950, and despite government paper quotas, the first issue sold about 900,000 copies. Eight of its twenty pages were presented in four-colour rotogravure. &quot;Eagle&quot; was designed to entertain and educate its readers; although a typical issue might contain such characters as Cavendish Brown, Harris Tweed, Jack O&#x27;Lantern, Storm Nelson and Luck of the Legion, it also included a special news section, a sports page, and school stories. Each issue also featured a centre-spread full-colour cutaway illustration of a piece of machinery—the first detailed the inner workings of the British Rail 18000 locomotive. Such high quality strips as Riders of the Range and P.C. 49 helped ensure a weekly circulation of almost a million copies, but it was the adventures of Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future, which most captivated readers. Created by Hampson—now a full-time staff artist with his own team—Dan Dare was the UK&#x27;s first science-fiction comic strip of any significance. Readers were thrilled by the square-jawed British spaceman&#x27;s weekly exploits, and his struggles with The Mekon.
While Morris (who by now had resigned from St James) edited the magazine from Hulton&#x27;s premises at Shoe Lane in London, the comic was created in a converted bakery in the Churchtown district of Southport. The building was described by &quot;Eagle&quot; artist Greta Tomlinson as &quot;very basic, a flagstone floor and a tin roof; there was cold running water in the corner. It was freezing cold in the winter and boiling hot in the summer&quot;. Working to a tight schedule, Hampson created each Dan Dare episode first in pencil, and then in ink and colour. He and his team of artists posed for photographs, in the positions drawn in his pencil sketches (Hampson usually posed for Dan Dare). These photographs were combined with the rough sketches, and his colleagues then worked on the strip while he tackled the opening frame of each week&#x27;s story. His drawings of the technology Dan Dare employed were meticulous, and were based on a large body of research and reference material, as well as space ship models, plaster heads, mocked-up space suits, and a complete model of a space station. He also wrote the dialogue for several of the comic&#x27;s pages. Hampson was assisted in his work by expert consultants, among them Arthur C. Clarke (then an aspiring young science fiction writer). Scriptwriters included Anglican priest Chad Varah (founder of Samaritans). Varah also accompanied Morris on tours of Cathedrals often filled with &quot;Eagle&quot; readers keen to meet the comic&#x27;s creators. Peter Ling and Macdonald Hastings were contributors, as was Harris Tweed&#x27;s creator John Ryan, who was also responsible for Captain Pugwash, printed in the first 19 issues.

Children were encouraged to submit their good deeds to the comic; those that had their stories printed were called MUGs, a not-so-subtle dig at the &quot;spivs&quot; who made fun of them. The best of these stories were awarded the title of &quot;MUG of the Month&quot;, or &quot;MUG of the Year&quot;. Readers were also invited to join an &quot;Eagle&quot; club. Upon payment of a subscription, members would be given a gilt &quot;Eagle&quot; badge, a rulebook, and a list of privileges. The club proved extremely popular, attracting within months a membership of about 100,000, but it also served as a research tool for Hulton; questionnaires were sent to a random selection of members, asking each to rate certain aspects of the comic. &quot;Eagle&quot;″s production costs were funded partly by advertising revenue, although advertisers were required to integrate their designs so as to match the comic&#x27;s high standards. Another of Hampson&#x27;s strips, Tommy Walls, was the first commercial cartoon in any comic, and an obvious advertisement for Wall&#x27;s ice cream. &quot;Eagle&quot; also spawned a large range of merchandise, which included toothpaste, pyjamas, and toy ray guns. Several annuals were printed; the first was announced in a September 1951 issue, in Morris&#x27;s regular letter to his readers.

&quot;Eagle&quot; became immensely popular with people of all ages and walks of life. Copies brought into school regularly found their way into the hands of staff, who enjoyed them almost as much as the children they taught. &quot;The Lancet&quot; reported on one doctor who read &quot;Eagle&quot; on his rounds. It was sent to soldiers in Korea, to refugee camps, and was praised by Geoffrey Grigson on the BBC Home Service. Wolf Mankowitz proclaimed Dan Dare a &quot;Hero of Our Time&quot;, and the Earl of Jellicoe was reported to have read the comic in the library of Westminster Palace. Lord Mountbatten supposedly placed a subscription order for his nephew, Prince Charles, and on one occasion rang Hulton to complain that the comic had not arrived; a replacement was quickly despatched. Years later Morris sent the prince a copy of &quot;The Best of Eagle&quot; (1977); Charles replied and thanked him for the &quot;fond memories&quot;. The comic was not universally popular, however, as it was quickly banned in South Africa.
Despite settling some of his debts, Morris once again found himself in financial trouble, with unexpected tax bills and arguments with Hulton over payments. In 1955 he sold the copyright of his signature to Hulton for £7,250 (a portion of which was a loan). 45% of his £5,000 per annum salary was paid to the taxman. With only one other profit-making magazine (&quot;Farmers Weekly&quot;), Hulton sought to curb &quot;Eagle&quot;″s costs, complaining about the use of taxis, expensive stationery, electricity and telephone bills, restaurant bills, and staff expenses. At their 1957 AGM Hulton&#x27;s Chairman reported a fall in profits, from £298,000 to £36,000, blaming reduced revenue from another of their magazines, &quot;Picture Post&quot;, and increased production costs. Several of Morris&#x27;s friends later left the company, and following a short period of internal turmoil Morris gave up the editor&#x27;s chair in 1959. The following year &quot;Eagle&quot; was taken over by Odhams Press. Hampson&#x27;s studio (by then in Epsom) was disbanded, and following creative differences he retired from the comic. His duties on Dan Dare were taken up by Frank Bellamy, described by Morris as &quot;a most fastidious artist and scrupulous draftsman, and like Hampson at his best, often consumed with anxiety&quot;. With Keith Watson and Don Harley, the three worked from a studio in Fleet Street. The front cover was redesigned, the Eagle name appearing across the top of the page rather than in one corner, coinciding with a new-look Dare. Many readers found Bellamy&#x27;s changes to Dare (made at the behest of &quot;Eagle&quot;″s publisher) objectionable. Bellamy was succeeded by Harley, who in 1962 was followed by Watson, who had returned from a short stint working on &quot;Eagle&quot;″s rival, &quot;Lion&quot;. Watson stopped drawing Dan Dare in 1967, and was succeeded by Bruce Cornwell. Following Hampson&#x27;s departure, the emphasis on Dan Dare&#x27;s exploration of the Solar System had changed instead to include interstellar travel. Continuity became strained, and production on Dan Dare ceased in 1967, when it was replaced by reprints from earlier editions.

&quot;Eagle&quot; continued to be published through the 1960s, under a succession of editors (Morris was succeeded by his deputy, Clifford Makins). Regular changes in emphasis, including an increasing number of features on contemporary music and sport, were not enough to ensure the comic&#x27;s continued survival. Although in 1961 its circulation was still about 500,000, under IPC, then &quot;Eagle&quot;″s owners, the comic suffered a drastic fall in quality. The centre spreads were replaced with the historically inaccurate &quot;Last of The Saxon Kings&quot;, and letters of complaint poured in to the comic. Within months the comic&#x27;s circulation fell to 150,000, and continued to drop. By 1966 it was in decline. IPC continued production until the comic&#x27;s last issue, on 26 April 1969, by which time circulation had dwindled to an unprofitable 40,000. Just short of its 1,000th edition, the comic was merged with its rival, IPC&#x27;s &quot;Lion&quot;.

Eric Meredith from Chester was employed as technical adviser by the Eagle Comic as the &#x27;Man from Eagle&#x27; who undertook daring stunts and wrote about his experiences in the comic.

===1982–1994===
A modified Dan Dare was briefly featured in IPC Media&#x27;s &quot;2000 AD&quot; (1977–1979). The public reaction to this, along with news of a planned television series, persuaded IPC&#x27;s comic arm Fleetway to relaunch &quot;Eagle&quot; in 1982, as a weekly comic edited by Dave Hunt. The first issue was dated 27 March 1982.

The original Dan Dare was no longer a feature of the comic, his eponymous great-great grandson taking on the mantle of space explorer instead. Drawn by Gerry Embleton, and later Ian Kennedy, and set 200 years after the original story, the first story-arc featured the return of Dan Dare&#x27;s earliest nemesis, The Mekon. IPC were unable to recreate the popularity of the original strip, and in 1989 the original Dan Dare returned to the comic, in a six-part story illustrated by original &quot;Eagle&quot; artist Keith Watson.

In an attempt to emulate the success that Fleetway had had with girls&#x27; magazines, the relaunched &quot;Eagle&quot; initially contained a large number of photo stories such as &quot;Doomlord&quot;, &quot;Sgt. Streetwise&quot;, &quot;Manix&quot; and &quot;Walk or Die&quot;, but this style was soon replaced by the more traditional comic-strip format. Other stories included &quot;Bloodfang&quot;, &quot;The House of Daemon&quot;, &quot;Computer Warrior&quot; and &quot;Detective ZED.&quot;

Along with IPC&#x27;s entire comics line, &quot;Eagle&quot; was sold to Robert Maxwell in 1987. Although not as successful as its predecessor, over 500 issues were published. A change to a monthly anthology caused by falling sales was a portent of the comic&#x27;s future. Toward the end of its life issues contained reprints of earlier work, including reprints of stories from other comics, such as &quot;M.A.C.H. 1&quot; from &quot;2000 AD&quot; and &quot;Charley&#x27;s War&quot; from &quot;Battle&quot;. There were also new Dan Dare stories written by Tom Tully and illustrated by David Pugh. The relaunched &quot;Eagle&quot; was dropped in 1994.

===Mergers with other comics===
In the twentieth century it was standard practice in the British comics industry to merge a comic into another one when it declined in sales. Typically, a few stories from the cancelled comic would continue for a while in the surviving comic, and both titles would appear on the cover (one in a smaller font than the other) until the title of the cancelled comic was eventually dropped. In this way, two comics were merged with the original &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;Swift&quot; in 1963 and &quot;Boys&#x27; World&quot; in 1964, before the &quot;Eagle&quot; itself came to an end when it was merged with &quot;Lion&quot; in 1969.

&quot;Lion&quot; was merged with &quot;Valiant&quot; in 1974, &quot;Valiant&quot; in turn was merged with &quot;Battle Picture Weekly&quot; in 1976, and finally &quot;Battle&quot; was merged into the revived &quot;Eagle&quot; in 1988. In a sense, the new &quot;Eagle&quot; was descended from the old.

The new &quot;Eagle&quot; also consumed &quot;Scream!&quot; in 1984, &quot;Tiger&quot; in 1985, &quot;M.A.S.K.&quot; in 1988 and &quot;Wildcat&quot; in 1989. The story &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot; from &quot;Scream!&quot; continued in the &quot;Eagle&quot; until 1987, and its lead character, Max, purported to be the comic&#x27;s editor for several years after the story finished (starting in #159).

==Legacy==

&quot;Eagle&quot; inspired several imitators, such as &quot;Valiant&quot;, &quot;Tiger&quot;, and &quot;Lion&quot; (which featured a Dan Dare clone, &quot;Captain Condor&quot;) but such adventure tales were less palatable for girls. Female characters like Dan Dare&#x27;s Professor Peabody (one of only two female main characters in the strip), were generally given less important roles than the men, and as a result a trend developed toward producing comics aimed specifically at either boys or girls. &quot;Girl&quot;, a sister title to &quot;Eagle&quot;, appeared in November 1951, and featured youthful capers in boarding schools, and tales of equestrian adventure. Later comics such as &quot;Jackie&quot;, descended from contemporary women&#x27;s magazines, were more cosmopolitan in flavour. &quot;Girl&quot; was followed in 1953 by &quot;Robin&quot;, which was aimed at younger children, and in March 1954 by &quot;Swift&quot;, for older readers than &quot;Robin&quot; but younger than &quot;Eagle&quot; or &quot;Girl&quot;.

The popularity of comics which depicted war faded after the end of the Second World War, and &quot;Eagle&quot;&#x27;s previously unheard-of circulation figures helped define the content of most comics produced during the 1950s, including war. In contrast to other, earlier publications, &quot;Eagle&quot; attempted to educate the reader with factual, text-based historical stories, such as the life of Winston Churchill, as presented in &quot;The Happy Warrior&quot;. A detailed account of the Second World War was given, while one strip lambasted German paratroopers, who on seeing British infantry below them, shouted &quot;Donner und Blitzen! Der Englander!&quot; During the mid-1950s however, comics began sensationalising their covers with war imagery, and &quot;Eagle&quot; followed suit in the 1960s.

Morris went on to become editorial director of the National Magazine Company, and later its managing director and editor-in-chief. He launched &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; in the UK, and with Condé Nast he formed COMAG, one of the UK&#x27;s largest media distribution companies. He was appointed OBE in 1983, retired the following year, and died in March 1989. Despite his later work however, he is best remembered as the founder of &quot;Eagle&quot;. His memorial service at St Bride&#x27;s Church in Fleet Street was filled to overflowing.

Hampson was embittered by his departure from &quot;Eagle&quot;. Although he created Dan Dare, he and Morris had signed contracts which made the space adventurer the copyright of its publisher. This made it difficult for him to get hold of his original artwork, and excluded him from any profits Hulton made from the huge range of Dan Dare and &quot;Eagle&quot; merchandise it licensed. He called Odhams, the comic&#x27;s owner after 1960, &quot;Treens&quot;. Hampson later worked on various advertising commissions, and illustrated seven Ladybird books. He recovered from cancer to become a graphics technician at Ewell Technical College, and in 1975 at the Lucca comics convention was declared as the best writer and illustrator of strip cartoons since the end of the Second World War. At the 1976 Comics 101 British comics convention he was given the Ally Sloper Award, as the best British strip cartoon artist. He died at Epsom in July 1985. His original Dan Dare drawings now command high prices, and have inspired a range of modern artists.

Gerald Scarfe and David Hockney were first published in &quot;Eagle&quot;. X-Men comic scriptwriter Chris Claremont read and enjoyed &quot;Eagle&quot;, and cites Hampson&#x27;s work as influential on his career. &quot;Watchmen&quot; co-creator Dave Gibbons has also praised Hampson&#x27;s work, and the lyricist Tim Rice, in his foreword to &quot;Living with Eagles&quot; (1998), cites the stories printed in &quot;Eagle&quot; as helping &quot;me in my story-telling efforts through musicals many years on&quot;. Professor Stephen Hawking, when asked about the influence Dan Dare had on him, replied: &quot;Why am I in cosmology?&quot;, and the entertainer Kenny Everett chose an &quot;Eagle Annual&quot; as his book on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;.

The comic industry&#x27;s Eagle Awards, first presented in 1977, are named after &quot;Eagle&quot;, and a fan club, the Eagle Society, regularly publishes the quarterly &quot;Eagle Times&quot;.

<text>The 42 centimetre 14 L/12 (short naval cannon), or Minenwerfer-Gerät (M-Gerät), popularly known by the nickname Big Bertha, was a German siege howitzer built by Krupp AG in Essen, Germany and fielded by the Imperial German Army from 1914 to 1918. The had a calibre barrel, making it one of the largest artillery pieces ever fielded.

The designed in 1911 as an iteration of earlier super-heavy German siege guns intended to break modern fortresses in France and Belgium and entered production in 1912. Test firing began in early 1914 and the gun was estimated to be finished by October 1914. When the First World War broke out, the two guns, still prototypes, were sent to Liège, Belgium, and destroyed Forts Pontisse and Loncin. German soldiers bestowed the gun with the nickname &quot;Big Bertha&quot;, which then spread through German newspapers to the Allies, who used it as a nickname for all super-heavy German artillery. The Paris Gun, a railway gun used to bomb Paris in 1918, has historically been confused for the M-Gerät.

Due to losses from faulty ammunition and Allied counter-battery artillery, a smaller-calibre () gun called the was built and fielded from 1916 until the end of the war. It had a longer and heavier barrel that was mated to the &#x27;s carriage but was found to be less effective than the base gun.

==Development and design==
The quick advancement of artillery technology beginning in the 1850s provoked an arms race between artillery and military architecture. Rifled artillery could now fire out of range of fortress guns, so military architects began placing forts in rings around cities or in barriers to block approaching armies. These forts were vulnerable to new artillery shells, which could penetrate earth to destroy masonry underground. In response, star forts evolved into polygonal forts, mostly underground and made of concrete with guns mounted in armoured, rotating casemates. Combining rings and barriers, France created a vast fortified zone on its border with Germany, while Belgium began construction of the National Redoubt in 1888.

The German Empire also fortified its borders, but Chief of the General Staff Helmuth von Moltke the Elder desired the ability to break through Franco-Belgian fortifications. Although German artillery had been effective during the Franco-Prussian War, it had been allowed to stagnate. By the 1880s the barrel diameter of the German Army&#x27;s most powerful gun, the field howitzer, was no longer adequate against fortresses. Moltke began requesting more powerful guns that same decade. More powerful artillery became essential to his successor, Alfred von Schlieffen, who planned quickly to defeat France by sweeping through Belgium (the Schlieffen Plan) in response to the 1893 Franco-Russian Alliance. To be able to reduce French and Belgian fortresses, the (Artillery Test Commission, APK) formed a partnership with Krupp AG in 1893. The first result of this partnership was a mortar, accepted into service four years later as the L/8, but known as the (Beta Apparatus) to disguise its purpose as a siege gun. Tests in the mid-1890s showed that the could not destroy French or Belgian forts, even with improved shells. Interest in a more powerful siege gun waned until the Russo-Japanese War, during which the Japanese Army used 28 cm howitzer L/10 ( coastal guns) brought from Japan to end the 11-month long Siege of Port Arthur.

In 1906, Helmuth von Moltke the Younger became Chief of the General Staff and instructed the APK to study and improve the performance of the . The APK recommended a more powerful gun, with a diameter as large as , but the German Army opted for a 30.5-centimetre howitzer, the 09 and a gun. Design and testing for the began in 1906 and lasted until 1911. Although the had the destructive power the General Staff required and could outrange French and Belgian fort guns, it could only be emplaced near rail lines and took 24 hours to prepare. As early as 1907, Krupp began development of siege artillery transported by gun carriage. Testing resulted in a howitzer transportable over road and countryside but it was rejected by the APK, as was Krupp&#x27;s 30.5-centimetre model. Finally, in late 1911, Krupp and the APK developed a wheeled 42-centimetre howitzer, the &quot;42-centimetre 14 L/12&quot; or (). The APK ordered its first in July 1912 and another in February 1913. Tests of the gun&#x27;s mobility began in December 1913 and found that gas-powered tractors were best for pulling it. Test firing, at one point observed by Kaiser Wilhelm II, began in February 1914, and Krupp estimated that the would be complete by October 1914.

===Design and production===
Assembled and emplaced, the weighed , was tall, long and wide, and sat on a steel base with a spade for bracing. This spade could be lifted out of the ground while the was emplaced to move it, giving it a traverse of 360°. The gun was breech loaded, using a horizontally-sliding breech block and had a barrel that could be elevated to a maximum of 65°. The had a muzzle velocity of about and a maximum range of . Post-prototype guns had a crew platform in front of the blast shield, a detachable breech, and solid wheels. The APK ordered the first in July 1912, delivered the following December, and a second in February 1913. Another two guns were ordered before the First World War on 31 July 1914, and then two more on 28 August and another pair on 11 November. Krupp eventually built 12 howitzers.

The had to be assembled for firing and for transport was dismantled and towed in five wagons. These wagons, weighing each, were designed to hold a specific portion of the M-Gerät, sans the gun carriage, which was its own wagon. These were towed by purpose-built, gas-powered tractors as the wagons were too heavy to be pulled by horses. To move across open country, the wagon wheels were fitted with articulated feet called to reduce their ground pressure. Under optimal circumstances, the tractors and wagons could move at .

The 30.5-centimetre , called the L/30, was developed in late 1917 to replace guns that had been rendered inoperable by premature detonation of shells. To increase the range of the and lower the likelihood of premature detonation, the APK selected a -long, naval barrel to be mounted onto the chassis of the . Two large spring cylinders were added to the front of the gun to counterbalance the new barrel, which had to be carried in a new carriage weighing . Fully assembled, the weighed and had a maximum range of . The propellant used to achieve that range caused three of the four guns to explode, forcing their crews to limit its range by , defeating the purpose of the longer L/30 barrel. Only four Beta-M-Gerät guns were modified from two M-Gerät guns and two guns (a one- to two-month-long process per gun), but 12 L/30 barrels were built.

===Ammunition===
German siege artillery had three types of projectiles: armour-piercing, high-explosive and intermediate. The armour-piercing shell was designed to smash through concrete and metal armour but was largely ineffective against reinforced concrete. High-explosive shells were fitted with two charges and could be set to have no delay, a short delay or a long delay. If set to &quot;no delay&quot; the shell burst on impact. If set to a delayed detonation, it could penetrate up to of earth. Finally, the intermediate, or &quot;short shell&quot;, weighed half as much as the high-explosive shell and was fitted with a ballistic tip for range and accuracy. Shells for the 42-centimetre guns were generally long, weighed between , and were propelled via primer loaded into the gun with a brass casing. Siege artillery shells were produced in limited runs of varying quality. Beginning in early 1916, German siege guns began to suffer internal explosions due to faulty ammunition. Crews were required to disembark from the gun before firing via a lanyard.

== Service history ==
The (KMK) batteries that formed with M-Gerät guns were 3 (2 August 1914), 5 (June 1915), 6 (Summer 1915) and 7 (early 1916). Battery 3 was split in half in April 1916 to form 10 with a single M-Gerät each. The four Beta-M-Gerät guns produced were fielded by KMK Batteries 8 and 10 after their M-Gerät gun barrels had been destroyed by premature detonation. When the German Army was reorganised in late 1918, only Battery 5 had M-Gerät guns, and (SKM) Battery 3 was assigned the remaining two Beta-M-Gerät guns.

===Western Front===

By June 1914, the prototype M-Gerät howitzers had returned to Essen for final adjustments and would have been formed into a reserve artillery battery on completion in October. On 2 August 1914, they were organised into KMK Battery 3 and sent to the Western Front with 240 men. On 4 August, the 1st Army arrived near Liège, Belgium, the first objective of the Schlieffen Plan and began the Battle of Liège. Although German troops entered the city on 7 August, its forts were firing upon the road to be taken by the 2nd Army and had to be reduced. Heavy artillery began their attack on 8 August. KMK Battery 3 was the first siege battery sent into battle to bombard the Fort de Pontisse on 12 August, which surrendered after two days. The battery next moved to the Fort de Liers but the fort surrendered as the battery was being emplaced. KMK Battery 3 relocated to the Fort de Loncin, where Gérard Leman directed the defence of Liège. Firing commenced on 15 August and lasted two hours, as the 25th shot fired struck a magazine and caused an explosion that destroyed the fort. The Germans carried Leman, unconscious, out of Loncin, and the last two forts, Hollogne and Flémalle, capitulated on 16 August.

With Liège captured, the 1st Army continued north-west while the 2nd and 3rd Armies marched to Namur, whose forts were undermanned, unmaintained, and poorly stocked with ammunition. The 2nd Army arrived on 20 August 1914 to open the Siege of Namur, but began their main attacks the following day with 400 pieces of artillery. KMK Battery 3 fired upon the Fort de Marchovelette, which was destroyed on 23 August by a magazine explosion. The battery shifted its fire to the Fort de Maizeret, already under bombardment by four Austro-Hungarian Skoda 30.5-centimetre guns, and compelled its surrender. With the eastern forts occupied, the Germans entered Namur and the remaining Belgian forces evacuated from the city.

Following the defeat of the Western Allies at Charleroi and at Mons, the British Expeditionary Force withdrew past Maubeuge, their base of operations after arriving in France. On 24 August 1914, the advancing Germans arrived at the fortresses of Maubeuge and began the Siege of Maubeuge and its garrison of 45,000 soldiers. The next day, the VII Reserve Corps were left behind the main German armies to take the city. Bombardment of the forts began on 30 August, with KMK Battery 3 tasked with reducing (Fort Sarts) but it mistakenly shelled an interval fortification in front of Sarts. By 5 September, a hole in the fortress ring had been opened by German 21-centimetre guns, but they had by now exhausted their ammunition. To widen that gap, the siege guns then expended their remaining ammunition against Forts Leveau, Héronfontaine, and Cerfontaine on 7 September, and destroyed them in quick succession. The two remaining French forts surrendered that same day and the Germans occupied Maubeuge on 8 September.

With Maubeuge taken, German siege guns were available for an attack on Paris, but Germany&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of the Marne blocked the advance of the 1st and 2nd Armies, and the guns were instead sent to Antwerp. King Albert I had ordered a general retreat to Antwerp on 18 August, and his army arrived in the city two days later. From Antwerp, Albert made attacks on the German flank on 24–25 August and 9 September, prompting General Alexander von Kluck of the 1st Army to send the III Reserve Corps to seize Antwerp. It arrived and partially surrounded Antwerp from the south-west on September 27, and bombardment began the next day. KMK Battery 3 arrived on 30 September and opened fire on the , whose artillery narrowly missed the battery. The fort was abandoned by its garrison on 2 October, allowing KMK Battery 3 to attack and destroy the in a day. The battery then moved to attack the , which was also destroyed within two days. From 7 to 9 October, the Belgian army fled from Antwerp and the city surrendered on 10 October.

Early in 1916, all 42-centimetre guns were assigned to the 5th Army, which amassed a total of 24 siege guns, the highest concentration of them during the war. The Battle of Verdun was opened on 21 February 1916 with an intense, nine-hour long artillery bombardment. The 42-centimetre guns had to suppress the artillery of Forts Vaux, Douaumont, Souville and but were unable to penetrate the concrete of the modern fortresses. On the second day of the battle, both of KMK Battery 7&#x27;s M-Gerät guns were destroyed by premature detonations and KMK Batteries 5 and 6 both lost an M-Gerät each to the same cause. Most of the siege guns at Verdun were moved north in July to participate in the Battle of the Somme, and by September the only M-Gerät units left in Verdun were KMK Batteries 3 and 6.

In the final two years of the war, KMK batteries that suffered losses of their big guns had them replaced with smaller–calibre weapons. Those that remained primarily shelled field works and often had low survivability due to malfunctions or Allied counter-battery artillery. KMK Battery 10 lost one M-Gerät to a premature detonation and the other to British warships near Ostend in August 1917 and was rearmed with captured Russian howitzers. It and KMK Battery 10 were given the four Beta-M-Geräts made during the war in early 1918. For the German spring offensive, KMK Battery 8 was assigned to the 6th Army, Battery 6 to the 2nd Army, and Battery 3 to the 18th Army. The effect of the siege guns was negligible. For Germany&#x27;s final offensive in July 1918, KMK Batteries 5 and 6 were reassigned to the 7th Army at the Marne, while Batteries 3, 8 and 10 went to the 1st Army at Reims. The batteries again had little to no effect, and Battery 10 became the last German siege battery to fire on a fort, the Fort de la Pompelle. In November 1918, KMK Battery 5 surrendered its guns, the remaining two M-Gerät howitzers, to the American Expeditionary Force.

===Eastern Front===
On 2 May 1915, August von Mackensen launched the Gorlice-Tarnow Offensive. By the end of the month, his forces neared Przemyśl, which had been captured by the Russians from Austria-Hungary on 22 March 1915. KMK Battery 6 took part in the bombardment of forts X, Xa, XI and XIa, opened on 30 March. Two days later, the Germans took and held forts X, Xa and XI against counter-attack, compelling the Russians to abandon Przemyśl. German troops entered the city on 3 June, then took the remaining forts two days later. From 8 August, KMK Battery 6 supported the XXXX Reserve Corps in its attack on Kaunas Fortress by bombarding Kaunas&#x27;s three westernmost forts. Although the German siege artillery&#x27;s shelling of Kaunas was slow, the fortifications were outdated and were easily destroyed. The city fell on 18 August.

To the south, KMK Batteries 3 and 5 participated in the siege of Novogeorgievsk, which the Germans had surrounded on 10 August. On 13 August, KMK Batteries 3 and 5 attacked with the siege guns from the north, shelling forts XIV, XV and XVI. On 16 August, German infantry stormed forts XV and XVI as the artillery bombarded them. A 42-centimetre shell struck German troops attacking Fort XV, resulting in heavy casualties but the Germans took the forts. The Russians abandoned the outer ring on 18 August, allowing the Germans to open a hole in the inner ring and capture Novogeorgievsk the next day. The Russians abandoned fortresses wholesale during the Great Retreat. At Grodno, KMK Batteries 3, 5, and 6 were not even fully emplaced when the fortress was evacuated on 3 September. The last deployment of M-Gerät guns on the Eastern Front was in October 1915, when KMK Battery 6 was attached to the German 11th Army as it invaded Serbia.

== Replicas and legacy ==
The nickname &quot;Big Bertha&quot; appeared early in the war, when German soldiers named the guns at the Battle of Liège, a reference to Bertha Krupp, who had inherited the Krupp works from her father. The name spread to German newspapers and then to Allied troops as &quot;Big Bertha&quot; and became slang for all heavy German artillery, but especially the 42-centimetre guns. The name has since entered the public consciousness, for example being applied as a moniker to a line of Callaway golf clubs and a satirical French-language magazine and a bond-buying policy by Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank.

Two M-Gerät guns were surrendered to the US Army at Spincourt in November 1918. One was taken to the United States, evaluated and then put on display at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, while the other was left unassembled in its transport configuration. Both were scrapped in 1943 and the early 1950s. World War I veteran Emil Cherubin built a replica of an M-Gerät, which toured Germany and appeared on a few postage stamps. The Paris Gun, a railway gun developed during the war and used to bomb Paris in 1918, has historically been confused with the M-Gerät since World War I.

<text>Socket 6 was a 486-generation CPU socket, a slightly modified version of the more common Socket 3. It was used in a few motherboards.

Intel designed this new standard near the end of the 80486&#x27;s market life, and therefore few motherboards were produced that used it, especially as the Socket 3 standard was already sufficient.

<text>Johannes Japetus Smith Steenstrup FRS(For) HFRSE (8 March 1813 – 20 June 1897) was a Danish zoologist, biologist, and professor.

==Life==
Born in Vang, Thy on 8 March 1813, he held a lectorate in mineralogy in Sorø until 1845 when he became a professor of zoology at the University of Copenhagen. He worked on a great many subjects, including cephalopods, and also in genetics, where he discovered the principle of the alternation of generations in some parasitic worms in 1842.

Steenstrup discovered (1842) the possibility of using the subfossils of the Postglacial as a means of interpreting climate changes and correlated vegetation change, which he called succession in the recent past. Two of Steenstrup&#x27;s students, Christian Vaupell and Eugen Warming further developed this line of research.

Japetus Steenstrup was a professor to zoologist Johan Erik Vesti Boas, who was also a student of zoologist Carl Gegenbaur, and Hans Christian Gram, inventor of the Gram stain.
During Charles Darwin&#x27;s extensive study of barnacles (Cirripedia) between 1846 and 1854, he corresponded with Steenstrup, who sent him both information and specimens. Darwin returned the specimens in 1854, and by way of thanks also sent Steenstrup a box of specimens, with a letter listing the 77 species of cirripedia he had enclosed as a gift. The specimens were dispersed in the Natural History Museum of Denmark; in 2014 staff at the museum found the list, and were able to identify most of the specimens for a new exhibition of their best objects. When Darwin published his series of monographs, he included notes acknowledging his debt to the kindness of Professor Steenstrup for sending him specimens of both modern and fossil barnacles.

Together with Johan Lange, Steenstrup was the publisher of &quot;Flora Danica&quot; fasc. 44.

In 1842, at the age of 29, he was elected a member of the Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab. In 1857, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1862, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society and in 1863 elected as member of the Royal Society.

He died on 20 June 1897 in Copenhagen.

<doc id="634336" wikidata="Q332413" url="?curid=634336" title="Robert McFarlane (American government official)">
<text>Robert Carl &quot;Bud&quot; McFarlane (July 12, 1937 – May 12, 2022) was an American Marine Corps officer who served as National Security Advisor to President Ronald Reagan from 1983 to 1985. Within the Reagan administration, McFarlane was a leading architect of the Strategic Defense Initiative, a project intended to defend the US from Soviet ballistic missile attacks. He resigned as National Security Adviser in late 1985 because of disagreements with other administration figures but remained involved in negotiations with Iran and with Hezbollah.

McFarlane was a central figure in the Iran–Contra affair, an operation in which the Reagan administration funneled weapons to Iran and diverted the profits to illegally fund right-wing rebels in Nicaragua. When the scheme came to light, administration officials implemented a plan to insulate Reagan and senior officials by focusing blame on McFarlane. He ultimately pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts and admitted that he had hidden information about the Reagan administration&#x27;s support of the Contras from Congress. Suffering from guilt over his role in the scheme and feeling betrayed by Reagan, who, McFarlane later wrote, &quot;approved every single action I ever took&quot; but &quot;lacked the moral conviction and intellectual courage to stand up in our defense and in defense of his policy.&quot; McFarlane attempted suicide in 1987. He was later pardoned, along with several other figures in the Iran-Contra scandal, by President George H. W. Bush shortly before he left office.

After his pardon, McFarlane operated a consulting business. He was investigated by the FBI in 2009 over concerns that he was illegally lobbying on behalf of the Sudanese government of Omar al-Bashir but was not charged with any crime. McFarlane died in Lansing, Michigan, on May 12, 2022, from a lung condition.

==Early life and education==
McFarlane was the son of Texas Democratic Congressman William McFarlane. After graduating high school, McFarlane entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1955, where he graduated in 1959. He was the third member of his family to attend the Academy, after his uncle Robert McFarlane (1925) and his brother Bill (1949). At the academy he graduated in the top 15 percent of the class and lettered twice in gymnastics. He received an honorary doctorate from the Institute of World Politics in Washington, D.C., in 2014. He sang in the Chapel Choir, and was a Brigade Administrative Officer and 14th Company Commander. He married his high school sweetheart, Jonda Riley.

==Marine Corps service==

Following graduation from the Naval Academy in 1959, McFarlane was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps, where he served as a field artillery officer.

As a Marine Corps officer, McFarlane commanded platoons, a battery of field artillery howitzers and was the Operations Officer for an artillery regiment. He taught Gunnery at the Army Advanced Artillery Course. He was the executive assistant to the Marine Corps&#x27; Operations Deputy from 1968–1971, preparing the deputy for meetings with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. During this assignment he was also the Action Officer in the Marine Corps Operations Division for Europe/NATO, the Middle East, and Latin America.

McFarlane served two combat tours in the Vietnam War. In March 1965, he commanded an artillery battery in the first landing of U.S. combat forces in Vietnam. While deployed during his first tour, McFarlane was selected for graduate studies as an Olmsted Scholar. McFarlane received a master&#x27;s degree (License) in strategic studies with highest honors from the Graduate Institute of International Studies (&quot;Institut de Hautes Etudes Internationales&quot;, HEI) in Geneva, Switzerland.

After attending the Graduate Institute of International Studies, McFarlane returned to Vietnam for a second tour in 1967–1968 as a Regimental Fire Support Coordinator for the 3rd Marine Division deployed along the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone during the Tet Offensive. He organized all fire support (B-52s, naval gunfire from the USS &quot;New Jersey&quot; (BB-62), and artillery) for forces deployed at Con Thien, Cam Lộ, Đông Hà, The Rockpile, Khe Sanh, and points between. McFarlane received a Bronze Star and a Navy Commendation Medal, both with Valor device.

Following his second tour in Vietnam and a tour at Headquarters Marine Corps, in 1971 he was named a White House Fellow. He was the first Marine Corps officer selected for the program.

McFarlane was assigned to the White House Office of Legislative Affairs and at the conclusion of that assignment was selected as the Military Assistant to Henry Kissinger at the National Security Council. In this post, McFarlane dealt with intelligence exchanges with the People&#x27;s Republic of China from 1973 to 1976, giving detailed intelligence briefings to the PRC at the time of the Sino-Soviet split. He also accompanied Kissinger on his visits to the PRC. In addition, McFarlane dealt with other aspects of foreign policy, including the Middle East, relations with the Soviet Union, and arms control. McFarlane was appointed by President Gerald Ford as his Special Assistant for National Security Affairs while a Lieutenant Colonel and was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal in 1976.

Upon leaving the White House, McFarlane was assigned to the National Defense University, where he co-authored a book on crisis management while concurrently receiving a diploma from the National War College.

He ended his Marine Corps career on Okinawa as Operations Officer for the 12th Marine Regiment. McFarlane retired in 1979 as a lieutenant colonel.

==Civilian posts==
In 1979, McFarlane was appointed by U.S. Senator John Tower to the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee, where he was responsible for staffing Senate consideration of the SALT II Treaty from 1979 to 1981. He also authored much of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s foreign policy platform during the 1980 presidential campaign.

In 1981, President Reagan appointed and the Senate confirmed McFarlane as Counselor at the Department of State. In this post he assisted Secretary of State Alexander Haig.

In 1982, Reagan appointed McFarlane as Deputy National Security Advisor responsible for the integration of the policy recommendations of the Departments of State, Treasury, and Defense. In 1983, he was appointed by the president as his Special Representative in the Middle East responsible for Israeli-Arab negotiations.

McFarlane was criticized for having involved the United States armed forces in the Lebanon Civil War with gunship bombardment of Lebanese opposition forces which may have led to the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing where 241 American servicemen were killed.

Following that assignment, he returned to the White House and was appointed President Reagan&#x27;s National Security Advisor. In that post, he was responsible for the development of U.S
foreign and defense policy. He was a supporter of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI or &quot;Star Wars&quot;).

==Iran-Contra affair and resignation==

The Iran-Contra affair involved secretly selling arms to Iran and funneling the money to support the Contras in Nicaragua. As National Security Adviser, McFarlane urged Reagan to negotiate the arms deal with Iranian intermediaries, but McFarlane said that by late December 1985 he was urging Reagan to end the arms shipments. McFarlane resigned on December 4, 1985, citing that he wanted to spend more time with his family; he was replaced by Admiral John Poindexter.

The Iran-Contra affair came to light in November 1986 and a political scandal ensued. Disheartened, feeling abused by his former colleagues, and in depression over the embarrassment for the president that his actions had contributed to, McFarlane attempted suicide with an overdose of 25 to 30 valium tablets and was admitted into the hospital just two hours before his scheduled testimony before the Blue Ribbon panel appointed by President Reagan to investigate Iran-Contra known as the Tower Commission on February 9, 1987, saying he had failed his country.

In 1988, he pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts of withholding information from Congress as part of the Iran-Contra cover-up. He was sentenced to two years&#x27; probation and a $20,000 fine but was pardoned by President George H. W. Bush on Christmas Eve 1992.

==Other activities==

McFarlane co-founded and served as CEO of McFarlane Associates Inc., an international consulting company.

He was also a Co-founder and Director of IP3 International (short for &quot;International Peace Power &amp; Prosperity&quot;), a consortium of firms wanting to build nuclear reactors in Saudi Arabia that is led by retired U.S. military commanders and former White House officials. Michael Flynn has described himself as an adviser to IP3, which the company denies. In May 2019, McFarlane wrote an op-ed in &quot;The Washington Times&quot; advocating for developing nuclear power generation in the Middle East titled &quot;The New Imperialism&quot;. This proposal, dubbed &quot;Middle East Marshall Plan&quot; by its backers, was detailed in a March 2017 White Paper written by Tom Barrack, the chairman of Donald Trump&#x27;s 2017 Presidential Inaugural Committee, a senior adviser to Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign, and a long-time close friend of and fundraiser for Donald Trump. In 2021, McFarlane co-wrote with David Gattie a piece for &quot;The National Interest&quot;, titled, &quot;China and the Importance of Civil Nuclear Energy,&quot; which extended his ideas on nuclear energy to the geopolitical outlook for China.

McFarlane was a member of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP) Board of Advisors, was president of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, was on the Board of Advisors, and was a founding member of the Set America Free Coalition. He was also an Advisory Board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy.

McFarlane served on a number of boards including:
* Aegis Defence Services – Non-executive director
* Partnership for a Secure America – Advisory Board
* Fuel Freedom Foundation – Advisory Board
* Myriant Incorporated – Advisory Board
* Member of the Committee on the Present Danger
* Alphabet Energy – advisory board

He was an advisor to John McCain&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign.
From 2009 on, McFarlane worked in the southern region of Sudan and Darfur on intertribal relations and development projects. On September 30, 2009, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; published a story suggesting that McFarlane&#x27;s contract for this work, which was supported by the government of Qatar, was the result of a request by Sudanese officials. McFarlane denied any improper contact with Sudanese officials or efforts to avoid disclosure of his work. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; article reported that some persons involved in peacemaking efforts in the southern Sudan region questioned the source and helpfulness of McFarlane&#x27;s activities. That article prompted FBI investigators to review McFarlane&#x27;s activities in the Sudan. After an exhaustive probe that lasted three years and included search of his trash, email, and personal belongings, investigators concluded their search and did not file any criminal charges.

In July 2011, McFarlane, in cooperation with former CIA director Jim Woolsey, co-founded the United States Energy Security Council, sponsored by the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security.

==Death==
McFarlane died on May 12, 2022, at a hospital in Lansing, Michigan, from complications of a lung condition at the age of 84. He lived in Washington, D.C., but was visiting family in Michigan at the time of his death. On July 27, 2022, the Congressional Record published, &quot;Remembering the Honorable Robert C. &quot;Bud&quot; McFarlane,&quot; commemorating the respect he commanded around the world for his diverse leadership roles.

<doc id="634343" wikidata="Q5176829" url="?curid=634343" title="Countdown (Australian TV program)">
<text>Countdown was a weekly Australian music television program that was broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation from 8 November 1974 until 19 July 1987. It was created by executive producer Michael Shrimpton, producer/director Robbie Weekes and record producer and music journalist Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum. &quot;Countdown&quot; was produced at the studios of the ABC in the Melbourne suburb of Ripponlea. It was screened Sunday night from 6:00pm to 7:00pm.

&quot;Countdown&quot; was the most popular music program in Australian TV history. It was broadcast nationwide on Australia&#x27;s government-owned broadcaster, the ABC, and commanded a huge and loyal audience. It soon exerted a strong influence on radio programmers because of its audience and the amount of Australian content it featured. The first half-hour episode went to air at 6.30pm on Friday, 8 November 1974, but for most of the time it was on air, it also gained double exposure throughout the country by screening a new episode each Sunday evening, and then repeating it the following Saturday evening. The majority of performances on the show were lip synced.

Molly Meldrum, the program&#x27;s talent co-ordinator, began appearing on-air in 1975, presenting the &quot;Humdrum&quot; music news segment and conducting interviews. Meldrum soon became the &quot;face&quot; of &quot;Countdown&quot;. He appeared regularly on-air until 1986. Another attraction to the program was the local and international acts who would host an episode—usually performing as well. During the show, Meldrum would interview them (while co-hosting) or have a chat with them before the show went out with the number-one single of the week. In October 2014, Meldrum published his autobiography, &quot;The Never, Um, Ever Ending Story&quot;.

==Cultural influence==
Teen-oriented pop music still enjoyed strong popularity during the 1970s, although much of it was sourced from overseas, and the proportion of Australian acts in the charts had hit an all-time low by 1973. That trend began to change around 1975, and many credit that largely to the advent of &quot;Countdown&quot;. Much of the show&#x27;s influence derived from its timeslot (Sundays at 6pm) and the fact that each week&#x27;s show was repeated the following Saturday at 5pm; the series also undoubtedly benefitted hugely from the long-delayed introduction of PAL colour television system in Australia, which was introduced four months after &quot;Countdown&quot; premiered. Because of this, &quot;Countdown&quot; was also one of the first Australian TV series to be made entirely in colour.

Although it is not widely recognised, &quot;Countdown&quot; also had a strong international influence, because it was one of the first TV shows in the world to promote the regular use of the music video as a major part of its programming. Because of its receptivity to music videos (something of a necessity because of the comparative rarity of tours by overseas acts), &quot;Countdown&quot; proved to be instrumental in the worldwide success of a number of important overseas acts of the period. Madonna achieved her first hit single in April 1984 when &quot;Holiday&quot; was screened on &quot;Countdown&quot;. Subsequently, &quot;Burning Up&quot; reached the top twenty following repeated showings of the video clip on the show; this second song was not a hit in other countries. Other international artists—including Blondie, ABBA, John Mellencamp, Meat Loaf, Boz Scaggs and Cyndi Lauper—achieved their first hits in Australia thanks to their video clips being aired on &quot;Countdown&quot;, and this in turn led to their records being picked up and becoming hits in America and/or Europe.

Many international acts, who would otherwise have gone largely unheard on Australian commercial radio, gained important exposure in Australia on &quot;Countdown&quot; through their music videos; the list includes many UK &quot;new wave&quot; acts such as Duran Duran, XTC, The Beat, Elvis Costello, The Specials, Lene Lovich, Joe Jackson, and The Cure, and US acts such as The Ramones and The Cars.

Above all, &quot;Countdown&quot; was crucial to the success of many leading Australian acts, including John Farnham, AC/DC, Olivia Newton-John, INXS, Dragon, Hush, Kylie Minogue, I&#x27;m Talking, John Paul Young, Sherbet, Skyhooks, Ted Mulry Gang, Jimmy and the Boys, Marcia Hines, Mark Holden, The Angels, Mondo Rock, Men at Work, Icehouse, Australian Crawl and Mental As Anything.

The program dominated Australian popular music well into the 1980s. The popularity of &quot;Countdown&quot; started to lose momentum by the mid-1980s. Music videos were often shown rather than the artists performing live in the studio. It was cheaper to produce with videos, and this led to &quot;Countdown&quot; having no significant difference from any other music video program shown on TV during this time.

The final episode of &quot;Countdown&quot; aired on 19 July 1987. Meldrum co-hosted with, and interviewed, Carol Hitchcock and Jim Keays. It was followed by the last &quot;Countdown&quot; Awards ceremony. It was a sad night for many, yet a celebration of musical achievements in &#x27;86/&#x27;87. Meldrum made his appearance at the end of the show wearing his well-known Stetson hat. Meldrum saluted the music industry and fans and then bared his shaved head to the audience. It was well known that his shaved head was a statement to artists like Midnight Oil, who during their career, and being one of Australia&#x27;s favourite bands, never appeared on the show due to regarding &quot;Countdown&quot; as too industry/hit-driven and appealed only to a young teenage audience.

In March 2007, the pay television service Foxtel, and its regional affiliate Austar, began screening hundreds of studio performances from the &quot;Countdown&quot; era. Themed &quot;Countdown&quot; specials have become very popular, and thought-lost performances by John Farnham, drag queen Divine, a-ha, Pseudo Echo and the Countdown Dancers performing the &quot;Flashdance&quot; medley highlight the popular music of the period.

The sign used in the logo is now housed and displayed at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image.

==Side shows==
During 1982-83 two side shows called &quot;Countdown Friday&quot; and &quot;Countdown Flipside&quot; were aired on Friday and Saturday nights. 23 episodes of &quot;Countdown Flipside&quot; were produced and by mid 1983 19 episodes of &quot;Countdown Friday&quot; had been produced. Both were clip shows with voice overs by John Peters.

==Prince Charles interview==

A well-known segment of the show&#x27;s run is an atypical studio interview Meldrum conducted with Prince Charles. Meldrum was extremely nervous about interviewing the prince, and he botched a great many takes during the interview by flubbing his lines and even committing several royal protocol blunders. Members of his production crew gave him constant encouragement between takes, and eventually Prince Charles politely asked Meldrum if he could get a teleprompter to assist him with the interview, to which Meldrum replied that there was not one available.

The interview, or rather, the numerous botched takes from it, has become a staple of blooper shows in Australia. Meldrum has since said of the interview, &quot;It&#x27;s not a regret, but I definitely stuffed that up.&quot;

==Wiped episodes==
A large number of master videotapes recorded between 1974 and 1978 were later erased and recycled during a management-initiated &quot;economy drive&quot; at the ABC, an action which Meldrum later criticised and said was &quot;unforgivable&quot;. Given the costs at the time of recording on videotape, most tapes were wiped and re-used. At least 100 episodes in total were erased from this period of the show&#x27;s history.

In the book &quot;Glad All Over&quot;, Michael Shrimpton said at that time the ABC were &quot;run by financial types [who] suddenly discovered that the increase in the purchase of video tapes had roared up 200 percent in 12 months&quot;. He said they didn&#x27;t stop to consider that the video tape &quot;was the cheapest link in the chain&quot;. An order came through from middle-management Bill Pritchard to erase a whole wall of tapes.

A total of 500 12-inch reels were pulled out, which affected at least 100 episodes. Ted Emery and Paul Drane heard about the order, surreptitiously removing as many reels as they could during the middle of the night and hiding them in their cars. According to Ted Emery, when the order came to erase the episodes, he used stalling tactics such as moving the tapes around. He said: &quot;I kept thinking fifteen years down the track this stuff will be important.&quot; The producers tried stalling further by handing in trims and pre-assemblies rather than the master copies. &quot;But it wasn&#x27;t enough,&quot; Emery said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t have enough to give him so they took the masters as well&quot;. Had it not been for Emery and Drane, the few episodes from the 1974–78 period that remained would have been erased. That includes the first episode broadcast in colour.

With the exception of 30 episodes, all programs aired between 1975 and 1978 were erased; only two episodes which aired in 1976 are known to exist. Most of the episodes erased originally aired from 1975 to 1977, but there are other episodes either missing or too damaged for future airing, the latter of which are most likely held only for research purposes.

According to Ted Emery, it was not just episodes of &quot;Countdown&quot; that were affected by the purge. A number of Australian Rules Football Grand Final games, along with episodes of &quot;Bellbird&quot; and &quot;Certain Women&quot;, were also erased.

In recent years, ABC Archives has undertaken an upgrade of the remaining episodes, copying what was left to its two on-air playback formats (Betacam SP and Digital Betacam). It is the copying of the programs onto this format that has allowed the ABC to re-broadcast episodes of &quot;Countdown&quot; during its all-night music show, &quot;Rage&quot;, in place of video clips which would normally air during that timeslot.

Missing-episode enthusiast Troy Walters has a website &quot;Turning Back Time: The Hunt For ABC&#x27;s Countdown&quot;, which discusses what has been lost and found.

==&quot;Countdown Revolution&quot; era==
From 3 July 1989 to December 1990, &quot;Countdown&quot; returned in the guise of &quot;Countdown Revolution&quot;. Without Meldrum, who had since gone on to &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;, it featured a group of young hosts, including Tania Lacy and Mark Little. The duo were fired by the ABC after an unauthorised on-air protest on 22 June 1990 against the policy of not allowing acts to perform live and insisting they mime to backup tracks. The show continued until its cancellation in December 1990. It also played once a month in Sydney at the Artransa Studios in Frenchs Forest.

The program aired 6:30 weeknights for 30 mins. On Friday nights, the top 10 biggest-selling songs in Australia was counted down (using information from the ARIA Chart). Video clips were generally shown, but memorable appearances live on stage included Poison (&quot;Nothin&#x27; but a Good Time&quot;), Faith No More (&quot;Epic&quot;), Kylie Minogue (&quot;Hand on Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Never Too Late&quot;), Jason Donovan (&quot;Sealed with a Kiss&quot;), Collette (&quot;All I Wanna Do Is Dance&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s What I Like About You&quot;), Brother Beyond (&quot;He Ain&#x27;t No Competition&quot;), Indecent Obsession (&quot;Say Goodbye&quot;), Martika (&quot;I Feel The Earth Move&quot;), James Freud (&quot;One Fine Day&quot;) and many more.

The hour-long Batdance competition was a high-rating show in November 1989, where Molly Meldrum aided in the judging of the talent from the state finalists.

The ABC&#x27;s late-night continuous music show &quot;Rage&quot; replayed old episodes of &quot;Countdown Revolution&quot; in January 2012, and again in January 2015, including the first episode from 1989.

The &quot;Countdown Magazine&quot; continued to be published during the run of &quot;Countdown Revolution&quot;.

==40th anniversary==
&quot;Countdown&quot;, the show that epitomised the pop music scene in Australia for over a decade, celebrated the 40th anniversary of its debut with the release of an anthology album in 2014. A two-part 40th Anniversary TV special, &quot;Countdown: Do Yourself A Favour&quot;, was broadcast on Sunday 16 November 2014. It was hosted by Julia Zemiro and included a guest appearance by Prince Charles. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2014 in November, both &quot;Countdown&quot; and Meldrum were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame – the first time a non-performing artist was inducted.

==&quot;Molly&quot; television drama==
A two-part documentary-drama about the life of Meldrum and his experiences with &quot;Countdown&quot; was created by Channel 7 in 2016. Episode one aired on 7 February 2016, while episode two aired on 14 February 2016. Australian actor Samuel Johnson starred as Meldrum, with Tom O&#x27;Sullivan as Shrimpton and T.J. Power as Weekes. It tells of the rise and fall of &quot;Countdown&quot;, its production struggles and various other tales about the music groups that went on it. The show received predominantly positive ratings, with 1.79 million viewers watching episode one and 1.52 million viewers watching episode two.

==&quot;Rage: Countdown&quot;==
The show lived up to its name when it angered devoted viewers by slashing its top 50 in mid-2006 and playing videos freeform.
But nearly a decade after that controversial decision, a new segment called &quot;The Chart&quot; hit the silver screen.
Rage now regularly plays chart hits with a &#x27;Countdown&#x27; of the most popular videos from the ARIA singles

==&quot;Classic Countdown&quot;==
On 17 September 2017, the ABC commenced airing a retrospective of the show, comprising 13 one hour episodes. Each episode focused on one year from 1975 to 1987, showcasing live performances from the show, interviews and Molly&#x27;s Humdrum. Voice over narration is supplied by recording artists who appeared on the show.
The show was programmed to air in &quot;Countdown&quot;″s original Sunday 6pm slot.

==New Year&#x27;s Eve: &quot;Countdown&quot; Live==
For the 2017 Sydney New Year&#x27;s Eve live show and broadcast on the ABC, there was a countdown to midnight and the fireworks. The show was themed like the &quot;Countdown&quot; show, with many live artists including Casey Donovan, Jimmy Barnes, Phil Jamieson, Isiah Firebrace and more. The show had the &quot;Countdown&quot; theme song and some of the same graphics. Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum did not return to host. The stage also had the &quot;Countdown&quot; logo.

==50th anniversary==
A 50th anniversary special, &quot;Countdown 50 Years On&quot;, was broadcast on Saturday 16 November 2024 on ABC. It was hosted by Myf Warhurst and Tony Armstrong.

==Compilation albums==
A series of popular CD compilations have been released by ABC Music, with selective tracks as featured on the original series.

<text>Colin Macfarquhar (1744/5 – 2 April 1793) was a Scottish bookseller and printer who is most known for co-founding &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; with Andrew Bell, first published in December 1768. The dates of his birth and death remain uncertain, even to Britannica itself.

== Biography ==
Macfarquhar was born in Edinburgh to his father James Macfarquhar who was a wigmaker and his mother Margaret. His formal education ended when he was apprenticed to a printing firm and achieved the status of a master printer in 1767. On 13 December 1767 Macfarquhar married Jane whose father, James Scruton, was an accountant in Glasgow. Macfarquhar and Jane had one son and four daughters.

Macfarquhar opened a printing shop in Edinburgh one or two years after getting married. The first edition of Britannica was sold at his printing office in Nicolson Street. Macfarquhar also contributed heavily to the second and third editions of Britannica.

<text>Karl Hermann Johannes Thiele (1 October 1860 – 5 August 1935) was a German zoologist specialized in malacology. Thiele was born in Goldap, East Prussia. His &quot;Handbuch der systematischen Weichtierkunde&quot; (English edition published by the Smithsonian under the title &quot;Handbook of Systematic Malacology&quot;) is a standard work. From 1904 until his retirement in 1925 he was the curator of the malacological collection at the Museum für Naturkunde (Museum of Natural History) in Berlin.
Thiele described more than 1.500 new species of molluscs; until today their types are deposited with the Museum of Natural History in Berlin. Especially important are his works on the Mollusca of the First German Antarctica Expedition and of the German Deep Sea Expedition aboard the vessel Valdivia.

Thiele&#x27;s classification of Gastropoda has been in use up to the past decade. It modified an earlier concept of Henri Milne-Edwards (1848) with three subclasses: Prosobranchia, Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata. Thiele&#x27;s classification was based on overall similarity between the species. This classification has been modified over the years, one recent example being the classification of Ponder &amp; Lindberg, 1997, based on phylogenetic arguments. He became the first to describe &quot;Geodia exigua&quot; in 1898.

<text>LexisNexis is an American data analytics company headquartered in New York, New York. Its products are various databases that are accessed through online portals, including portals for computer-assisted legal research (CALR), newspaper search, and consumer information. During the 1970s, LexisNexis began to make legal and journalistic documents more accessible electronically. the company had the world&#x27;s largest electronic database for legal and public-records–related information. The company is a subsidiary of RELX.

== History ==
LexisNexis is owned by RELX (formerly known as Reed Elsevier).

According to Trudi Bellardo Hahn and Charles P. Bourne, LexisNexis (originally founded as LEXIS) is historically significant because it was the first of the early information services to both envision and actually bring about a future in which large populations of end users would directly interact with computer databases, rather than going through professional intermediaries like librarians. The developers of several other early information services in the 1970s harbored similar ambitions (e.g., OCLC&#x27;s WorldCat), but met with financial, structural, and technological constraints and were forced to retreat to the professional intermediary model until the early 1990s.

The LexisNexis story begins in western Pennsylvania in 1956, when attorney John Horty began to explore the use of CALR technology in support of his work on comparative hospital law at the University of Pittsburgh Health Law Center. Horty was surprised to discover the extent to which the laws governing hospital administration varied from one state to another across the United States and began building a computer database to help him keep track of it all.

In 1965, Horty&#x27;s work inspired the Ohio State Bar Association (OSBA) to independently develop its own CALR system, Ohio Bar Automated Research (OBAR). In 1967, the OSBA signed a contract with Data Corporation, a local defense contractor, to build OBAR based on the OSBA&#x27;s written specifications. Data proceeded to implement OBAR on Data Central, an interactive full-text search system originally developed in 1964 as Recon Central to help U.S. Air Force intelligence analysts search text summaries of the contents of aerial and satellite reconnaissance photographs. (Before computer vision was invented, text summaries were manually prepared by enlisted personnel called &quot;photo interpreters&quot;; analysts then used those summaries as a catalog to retrieve photographs from which they could draw inferences about enemy strategy.)

In 1968, paper manufacturer Mead Corporation purchased Data Corporation for $6 million to gain control of its inkjet printing technology. Mead hired the Arthur D. Little consulting firm to study the business possibilities for the Data Central technology. Arthur D. Little dispatched a team of consultants from New York to Ohio led by H. Donald Wilson. After Mead asked for a practicing lawyer on the team, Jerome Rubin, a Harvard-trained attorney with 20 years of experience was included. The resulting study concluded that the nonlegal market was nonexistent, the legal market had potential, and OBAR needed to be rebuilt to profitably exploit that market. At the time, OBAR searches often took up to five hours to complete if more than one user was online, and its original terminals were noisy Teletypes with slow transmission rates of 10 characters per second. The original OBAR terminals were belatedly replaced with CRT text terminals in 1970. OBAR also had quality control issues; Rubin later recalled that its data was &quot;unacceptably dirty.&quot;

In February 1970, Mead reorganized Data Corporation&#x27;s Information Systems Division into a new Mead subsidiary called Mead Data Central (MDC). Wilson and Rubin, respectively, were installed as president and vice president. A year later, Mead bought out the OSBA&#x27;s interests in the OBAR project, and OBAR disappears from the historical record after that point.

After Wilson was put in charge, he became reluctant to implement his own study&#x27;s recommendation to abandon the OBAR/Data Central work to date and start over. In September 1971, Mead&#x27;s management relegated Wilson to vice chairman of the board (i.e., a nonoperational role) and elevated Rubin to president of MDC. Rubin pushed the legacy Data Central technology back to Mead Corporation. Under a newly organized division, Mead Technical Laboratories, Data Central continued to operate as a service bureau for nonlegal applications until 1980.

Rubin then hired a new team to build an entirely new information service dedicated exclusively to legal research. He coined a new name, LEXIS, from &quot;lex&quot;, the Latin word for law, and &quot;IS&quot; for &quot;information service&quot;. After several iterations, the original functional and performance specifications were finalized by Rubin and executive vice president Bob Bennett in late summer 1972. System designer Edward Gottsman supervised the implementation of the specifications as working computer code. At the same time, Rubin and Bennett orchestrated the necessary keyboarding of the legal materials to be provided through LEXIS, and designed a business plan, marketing strategy, and training program. MDC&#x27;s corporate headquarters were moved to New York City, while the data center stayed in Dayton, Ohio.

Lexis was the first information service to directly serve end users. Rubin later explained that they were trying &quot;to crack the librarian barrier. Our goal was to get a LEXIS terminal on every lawyer&#x27;s desk.&quot; To persuade American lawyers to use LEXIS (at a time when computer literacy was rare), MDC used aggressive marketing, sales, and training campaigns.

On April 2, 1973, MDC publicly launched LEXIS at a press conference in New York City, with libraries of New York and Ohio case law as well as a separate library of federal tax materials. By the end of that year, the LEXIS database had reached two billion characters in size and added the entire United States Code, as well as the &quot;United States Reports&quot; from 1938 through 1973.

By 1974, LEXIS was running on an IBM 370/155 computer in Ohio supported by a set of IBM 3330 disk storage units which could store up to about 4 billion characters. Its communications processor could handle 62 terminals simultaneously with transmission speed at 120 characters per second per user. On this platform, LEXIS was able to execute over 90% of searches within fewer than five seconds. Over 100 text terminals had been deployed to various legal offices (i.e., law firms and government agencies) and over 4,000 users had been trained.

By 1975, the LEXIS database had grown to 5 billion characters and could handle up to 200 terminals simultaneously. By 1976, the LEXIS database included case law from six states, plus various federal materials. MDC turned a profit for the first time in 1977.

In 1980, LEXIS completed its hand-keyed electronic database of all extant U.S. federal and state cases. The NEXIS service, added that same year, provided journalists with a searchable database of news articles.

In September 1981, Rubin and several of his allies (including Bennett and Gottsman) left Mead Data Central to pursue other opportunities.

When Toyota launched the Lexus line of luxury vehicles in 1989, Mead Data Central sued for trademark infringement on the grounds that consumers of upscale products (like lawyers) might confuse &quot;Lexus&quot; with &quot;Lexis&quot;. A market research survey asked consumers to identify the spoken word &quot;Lexis&quot;. Survey results showed that a nominal number of people thought of the computerized legal search system; a similarly small number thought of Toyota&#x27;s luxury car division. A judge ruled against Toyota, and the company appealed the decision. Mead lost on appeal in 1989 when the Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit held that there was little chance of consumer confusion. Today, the two companies have an amicable business relationship, and in 2002 implemented a joint promotion called &quot;Win a Lexus on Lexis!&quot;

In 1988, Mead acquired the Michie Company, a legal publisher, from Macmillan.

In December 1994, Mead sold the LexisNexis system to Reed Elsevier for $1.5 billion. The U.S. state of Illinois subsequently audited Mead&#x27;s income tax returns and charged Mead an additional $4 million in income tax and penalties for the sale of LexisNexis; Mead paid the tax under protest, then sued for a refund in an Illinois state court. On April 15, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with Mead that the Illinois courts had incorrectly applied the Court&#x27;s precedents on whether Illinois could constitutionally apply its income tax to Mead, an out-of-state, Ohio-based corporation. The Court reversed and remanded so the lower courts could apply the correct test and determine whether Mead and Lexis were a &quot;unitary&quot; business.

In 1997, LexisNexis acquired 52 legal titles (including the Lawyers&#x27; Edition) owned by the Thomson Corporation. Thomson was required to sell the titles as a condition of acquiring competing publisher West.

In 1998, Reed Elsevier acquired Shepard&#x27;s Citations and made it part of LexisNexis. Before electronic citators like Westlaw&#x27;s KeyCite appeared, Shepard&#x27;s was the only legal citation service which attempted to provide comprehensive coverage of American law.

In 2019, LexisNexis announced a joint venture with Knowable, a leader in contract data analytics.

In February 2020, LexisNexis transitioned its database services to the Amazon Web Services cloud architecture, and shut down its legacy mainframes and servers.

In 2020, &quot;Estates Gazette&quot; and the remaining business of Reed Business Information became part of LexisNexis.

=== Acquisitions ===
In 2000, LexisNexis purchased RiskWise, a St. Cloud, Minnesota company. Also in 2000, the company acquired the American legal publisher Matthew Bender from Times Mirror. In 2002, it acquired a Canadian research database company, Quicklaw. In 2002, LexisNexis acquired the Ohio legal publisher Anderson Publishing. In 2004, Reed Elsevier Group, parent company of LexisNexis, purchased Seisint, Inc, from founder Michael Brauser of Boca Raton, Florida. Seisint housed and operated the Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange (MATRIX).

In February 2008, Reed Elsevier purchased data aggregator ChoicePoint (previous NYSE ticker symbol CPS) in a cash deal for US$3.6 billion. The company was rebranded as LexisNexis Risk Solutions.

In 2013, LexisNexis, together with Reed Elsevier Properties SA, acquired publishing brands and businesses of Sheshunoff and A.S. Pratt from Thompson Media Group.

Sheshunoff Information Services, A.S. Pratt, &amp; Alex Information (collectively, SIS), founded in 1972, is a print and electronic publishing company that provides information to financial and legal professionals in the banking industry, as well as online training and tools for financial institutions. SIS was founded in 1971 by Alex and Gabrielle Sheshunoff. The company became recognized for providing guidance and analysis to the banking industry. In 1988 Thompson Media, a division of Thomson Reuters, acquired the company. Separately, the Sheshunoffs began publishing Alex Information products.

In 1995, SIS acquired A.S. Pratt &amp; Sons. Established in 1933, &quot;Pratt&#x27;s Letter&quot; is believed to be the second oldest continuously published newsletter in the country behind &quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s Washington Letter&quot;, which began publication in 1923. A.S. Pratt is a provider of regulatory law and compliance work tools for the financial services industry.

Gabrielle Sheshunoff returned in 2004 to unite the AlexInformation, Sheshunoff, and A.S. Pratt brands before it was sold to Thompson in 2008.

In November 2014, LexisNexis Risk Solutions bought Health Market Science (HMS), a supplier of data about US healthcare professionals.

In May 2022, LexisNexis acquired the behavioral biometrics technology provider, BehavioSec for an undisclosed sum.

=== Data breach ===
On March 9, 2005, LexisNexis made the theft of personal information of Seisint users public. It was originally estimated that 32,000 users were affected, but that number greatly increased to over 310,000. Affected persons were provided with free fraud insurance and credit bureau reports for a year. However, no reports of identity theft or fraud were discovered to have stemmed from the security breach. The hackers stole passwords, names, addresses, and Social Security and driver&#x27;s license numbers of customers of LexisNexis&#x27;s Seisint division. Seisint collects data on individuals that&#x27;s used by law enforcement agencies and private companies for debt recovery, fraud detection and other services.

== Commercial products ==
LexisNexis services are delivered via two websites that require separate paid subscriptions.

In 2000, Lexis began building a library of briefs and motions. In addition to this, Lexis also has libraries of statutes, case judgments and opinions for jurisdictions such as France, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, South Africa, and the United Kingdom as well as databases of law review and legal journal articles for countries for which materials are available.

Previously, LexisNexis had a stripped-down free version (known as LexisOne) but this has been discontinued
and replaced by Lexis Communities, which provides news and blogs across a variety of legal areas.

Time Matters is a LexisNexis-branded software offering. Lexis for Microsoft Office is a LexisNexis-branded software offering.

In France, the UK and Australia, LexisNexis publishes books, magazines and journals, both in hard copy and online. Titles include &quot;Taxation Magazine&quot;, &quot;Lawyers Weekly&quot; and &quot;La Semaine Juridique&quot;.

Lastly, LexisNexis focused on generative AI tool for attorneys called LexisNexis Precision that can produce memos defining key legal concepts, identify and summarize new case developments, and generate common legal documents.

=== LexisNexis UK ===
The organization that eventually became LexisNexis UK was founded in 1818 by Henry Butterworth (1786–1860). He was a pupil at King Henry VIII School, Coventry. After leaving Coventry he was apprenticed to and, for some time, worked for his uncle Joseph Butterworth, the great law bookseller of Fleet Street. In 1818, however, disagreement between them as to the terms of partnership made Henry set up on his own account at the corner of Middle Temple Gate (7 Fleet Street), where he became the well-known Queen&#x27;s Law Bookseller.

Butterworths was acquired by International Publishing Corporation in 1965; IPC was acquired by the Reed Group in 1970. Heinemann Professional Publishing was merged with Butterworths Scientific in 1990 to form Butterworth-Heinemann. The Butterworths publishing business is now owned and operated in the UK by Reed Elsevier (UK) Ltd, a company in the Reed Elsevier Group. Publications continue to be produced by RELX (UK) Ltd using the &quot;LexisNexis&quot;, &quot;Butterworths&quot; and &quot;Tolley&quot; trade marks. Such publications include &quot;Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of England&quot; and the &quot;All England Law Reports&quot;, amongst others.

The Butterworths name is also used to publish works in many countries such as Canada, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.

LexisNexis also produces a range of software, services and products which are designed to support the practice of the legal profession. For example, case management systems, customer relationship management systems (&quot;CRMs&quot;) and proofreading tools for Microsoft Office.

=== Other products ===
InterAction is a customer relationship management system designed specifically for professional services firms such as accountancy and legal firms.

Business Insight Solutions offers news and business content and market intelligence tools. It is a global provider of news and business information and market intelligence tools for professionals in risk management, corporate, political, media, and academic markets.

== Criticism and cases ==

=== Illegal collection and sale of personal data ===
In 2022, LexisNexis Risk Solutions was sued by immigration advocates for allegedly violating Illinois law by collecting and combining extensive personal information and selling it to third parties, including federal immigration authorities. The lawsuit claimed that the company&#x27;s practices posed &quot;a grave threat to civil liberties.&quot;

=== Immigration-related criticism ===
Critics accused LexisNexis of violating individuals&#x27; privacy rights by providing addresses, phone numbers, relatives&#x27; names, and more through the data being sold to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

In November 2019, several legal scholars and human rights activists called on LexisNexis to cease work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement because their work directly contributes to the deportation of undocumented migrants.

=== Allegations of violating EU privacy legislation ===
LexisNexis has been accused of violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by collecting and storing personal data of European citizens without their explicit consent. The accusation was made by NOYB, a European privacy advocacy group, which filed a complaint with the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), the lead supervisory authority for LexisNexis in the European Union. NOYB alleges that LexisNexis collects personal data of European citizens through its legal research products and services, including Lexis Advance and LexisNexis® Academic. This data includes names, addresses, email addresses, and IP addresses.

NOYB also alleges that LexisNexis does not provide European citizens with an opportunity to opt out of the collection and storage of their personal data. This is a violation of the GDPR, which requires companies to obtain consent from individuals before collecting and storing their personal data.

In response to the complaint, LexisNexis has said that it is committed to complying with the GDPR and that it is currently reviewing its data collection and processing practices.

The DPC is currently investigating the complaint and has not yet issued a decision. If the DPC finds that LexisNexis has violated the GDPR, it could impose a fine of up to €20 million or 4% of the company&#x27;s global annual turnover, whichever is greater.

=== Withdrawal from China ===
In March 2017, after being asked to remove some content, LexisNexis withdrew Nexis and LexisNexis Academic from China.

=== Violation of Daniel&#x27;s Law ===
On March 4, 2024, two anonymous plaintiffs in New Jersey filed a class-action lawsuit against LexisNexis, stating that they violated Daniel&#x27;s Law. In New Jersey, Daniel&#x27;s Law includes a clause requiring that if websites have published certain personal information regarding certain government officials, and a request to take it down by an authorized party is issued, such a request must be honored. The lawsuit represents over 18,000 individuals, and alleges that not only were such requests not honored, but those who filed requests were punished by LexisNexis, who &quot;campaign[ed] to freeze the credit reports of Plaintiffs and others&quot;, and incorrectly reported them as victims of identity theft. Furthermore, additional allegations state that LexisNexis published &quot;comprehensive reports on other family members (including minor children as young as 13 years old)&quot;, and that as of the time of the lawsuit, none of the attempts to have LexisNexis unfreeze the credit reports have been honored.

=== Privacy Class Action Lawsuit ===
On April 17, 2024, a privacy class action lawsuit was filed against LexisNexis over its use of personally identifiable information. The lawsuit was filed in behalf of residents of at least California and Illinois. The complaint claims that LexisNexis did so without plaintiffs&#x27; authorization in order to promote its Lexis Personal Records Products.

=== Other privacy cases ===
LexisNexis has been in the news for a number of data privacy issues. In 2023, the company was fined €100,000 by the French data protection authority, CNIL, for failing to properly inform individuals about how their data was being used. The CNIL found that LexisNexis had not provided clear and concise information about its data collection and processing practices, and that it had not obtained the necessary consent from individuals to use their data.

LexisNexis has also been criticized for its use of facial recognition technology. In 2022, the company was sued by a group of privacy advocates who alleged that it was illegally using facial recognition technology to scan images of people without their consent. LexisNexis has denied the allegations; the case is still pending.

The company has also been accused of collecting and storing excessive amounts of data about individuals. In 2021, a report by the Norwegian Consumer Council found that LexisNexis had collected data on millions of people, including their names, addresses, phone numbers, and social media activity. The report also found that LexisNexis was sharing this data with third-party companies without the knowledge or consent of the individuals involved.

<text>Bernardino Luís Machado Guimarães, (; 28 March 1851, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil – 29 April 1944, Porto, Portugal), was a Portuguese political figure, the third and eighth president of Portugal (1915–1917, 1925–1926).

In 1917, Sidónio Pais, who was at the head of a military junta, dissolved Congress and removed Machado, forcing him to leave the country. Later, in 1925, he returned to the presidency of the Republic and, a year later, he was again overthrown by the military revolution of 28 May 1926, which instituted the military dictatorship and paved the way for the establishment of the Estado Novo.

== Early life ==
Bernardino Machado was born in Rio de Janeiro, Empire of Brazil, the son of António Luís Machado Guimarães (1820–1882), 1st Baron of Joane and a nobleman of the royal household, a rich merchant raised to the nobility, and his second wife Praxedes de Sousa Guimarães. Bernardino came to Portugal in 1860, enrolled at Coimbra University in 1866, studied mathematics for three years, and graduated in philosophy in 1873. In 1872, he chose to obtain Portuguese nationality. Machado continued his studies, obtaining a doctorate in philosophy in 1876 and graduated in general agriculture and rural economy in 1883. He lectured at that institution beginning in 1877.

In Porto in January 1882 he married Elzira Dantas Gonçalves Pereira (Rio de Janeiro, 15 December 1865 – Porto, 21 April 1942), by whom he had nineteen children. One of his sons-in-law was the writer Aquilino Ribeiro, whose own son was Aquilino Ribeiro Machado, the first mayor of Lisbon after the Carnation Revolution.

== Political scene ==

Bernardino Machado began in politics from a young age, by the leader of the Regenerator Party, Fontes Pereira de Melo. It was the members of the Regenerator Party who elected him as a deputy for the first time to the Portuguese parliament for Lamego, in the supplementary elections of 1882. In the following legislature (1884-1887) he was reelected, this time by the Coimbra circle.

In 1890 and 1894 was also elected Peer of the Realm by Coimbra University. During this period he was briefly Minister for Public Works on the Hintze Ribeiro cabinet in 1893, and created the first labour court in Portugal. Taking a special interest in public education, he was made part of the Superior Council of Public Education in 1892, and published several books on the subject.

In February 1893, Machado joined the first ministry of Hintze Ribeiro, as Minister of Public Works, Commerce and Industry, presenting his resignation in December of that same year.

Machado had an important career as leader of Freemasonry (in the Lodge of Perseverance of the Grand Orient of Portugal, with the symbolic name of &quot;&quot;Littré&quot;&quot;). From 1892 to 1895 he was the 7th President of the Order of the Grand Orient of Portugal, from 1895 to 1899 he was the 18th Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council attached to the Grande Oriente Lusitano and 7th Grand Master of the Grande Oriente Lusitano United and from 1929 until his death in 1944 was the 23rd Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council attached to the Lusitanian Grand Orient.

In 1903, due to his growing disbelief in monarchical values, he joined the Portuguese Republican Party. On 31 October 1903 he professed his republican faith in a conference given at the Ateneu Comercial in Lisbon, thus marking his formal adherence to the Party. Since then, he contributed much to the remodeling and organization of the Party as a political force; participated in vigorous propaganda campaigns of republican ideals and participated actively in numerous rallies. In 1904, 1905 and 1906 he was a candidate for deputy on the republican lists, always for the Lisbon constituency, however, he was not elected.

Machado was also briefly President of the Directory of the Democratic Party in 1902, and after switching to the Republican Party, was this party&#x27;s President of the Directory from 1906 to 1909. He was one of the few monarchists-turned-republican who switched during the monarchy.

In the legislative elections of August 1910, he was one of the five deputies elected by Eastern Lisbon, along with António José de Almeida, Afonso Costa, Alfredo de Magalhães and Miguel Bombarda.

Once the Republic was proclaimed in 1910 he was made Minister for Foreign Affairs, and ran an unsuccessful campaign for the presidential elections of 1911. Afterwards, on 20 January 1912, he was appointed Minister of Portugal in Rio de Janeiro, assuming office in July that year. The diplomatic mission was promoted to embassy in November 1913, with Bernardino Machado being the first Portuguese ambassador to that country.

When he returned to Portugal in February 1914, the country was in a ministerial crisis with the resignation of Afonso Costa as head of government. Bernardino Machado was called to set up an extrapartisan ministry, in order to appease the heated political sentiments, foreseeing in his program a truce proposal to monarchists, trade unionists and Catholics, to whom he promised a revision of the religious segregation law. In June of that year, Bernardino Machado requested the resignation of the executive who presided, but was again called to form a government: the 7th Republican government was once again &quot;extra-partisan&quot;, with all the ministers, except for the president, who was independent.

Machado ran again for the presidency in 1915 and was this time elected President of Portugal. In the course of his term, he received Germany&#x27;s declaration of war (March 1916), and visited the Portuguese forces placed in France in the battlefields.

In 1917 the government was deposed by a military coup headed by Sidónio Pais, and Machado went into exile.

Upon Machado&#x27;s return in 1919 he was elected Senator. He served as Prime Minister from 2 March to 23 May 1921. Once again, in 1925, he achieved the presidential office after President Teixeira Gomes resigned, only to be overthrown a year later (1926) by Gomes da Costa (See: 28 May 1926 coup d&#x27;état and Ditadura Nacional). The country remained under a military, then a civilian, dictatorship until 1974.

For a second time he went into exile in France, where he continued to be very critical of the Portuguese regime. The German occupation of France in 1940 forced him to seek protection in Portugal, which the government granted him with the condition that he was to be confined to his personal retreat in the northern part of Portugal. It was there in Porto that he died, aged 93, in 1944, making him the longest lived Portuguese president ever.

== Personal life ==
He was the father-in-law of the noted writer Aquilino Ribeiro, grandfather of the politician Aquilino Ribeiro Machado and the great-grandfather of the psychologist and sexologist Júlio Machado Vaz. In 1906, Machado was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.

<text>Gerardo Machado y Morales (28 September 1869 – 29 March 1939) was a general of the Cuban War of Independence and President of Cuba from 1925 to 1933.

Machado entered the presidency with widespread popularity and support from the major political parties. However, his support declined over time. Many people objected to his running again for re-election in 1928, as his victory violated his promise to serve for only one term. As protests and rebellions became more strident, his administration curtailed free speech and used repressive police tactics against opponents.

Ultimately, in 1933, Machado was forced to step down in favor of a provisional government headed by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada and brokered by US ambassador Sumner Welles. Machado has been described as a dictator.

==Family and education==
Machado was born in 1869 as the oldest child in his family, in the central province of Las Villas (now Villa Clara). He had two younger siblings, a brother named Carlos and a sister named Consuelo. He and his siblings grew up on their family&#x27;s cattle farm, during a period when their father served with Cuban rebels in the Ten Years&#x27; War against Spain (1868–1878). His father attained the rank of major. The war ended without Cuba achieving independence. When he was in his early 20s, Machado engaged in growing and selling tobacco.

As a young man, he married Elvira Machado Nodal (28 October 1868 in Villa Clara – 1968). They had three daughters together: Laudelina (Nena), Ángela Elvira, and Berta.

==Cuban War of Independence==
In 1895 Cubans launched a War of Independence against Spain. Machado joined the rebel forces and rose to the rank of brigadier general. He was one of the youngest Cuban generals in the war. He fought in the middle provinces.

==Post-war career==
After the war ended, Machado turned to politics and business. In 1902, Cuba was granted full independence. Meanwhile, Machado was elected as mayor of Santa Clara. During the national administration of José Miguel Gómez (1909–1913), Machado was appointed as inspector of the armed forces and later as Secretary of the Interior.

After his return to private life, he engaged in farming and in business, investing in public utilities. With his family provided for, he returned to politics in the early 1920s.

Machado was said to be the party&#x27;s war leader in Las Villas province, where he fought on the Liberal side in the &quot;Little War of February 1917&quot; La Chambelona (Chambelona War), with José Miguel Gómez, Alfredo Zayas, and Enrique Loynaz del Castillo. The Liberals were defeated. Calixto Enamorado fought on the Conservative side.

After initial victories for the Liberals, things turned for the worse, and yet Machado continued to fight even after the Liberals were defeated by the machine guns of Colonel Rosendo Collazo at Caicaje, once the hacienda of Santiago Saura Orraque and Juan Manuel Perez de la Cruz. Finally they could not continue and Machado surrendered on 8 March 1917.

President Mario García Menocal had definitively won the conflict. Technically there was no U.S. intervention in this war. Cuban Army officers, notably Julio Sanguilí in Santiago, and their forces regained control of the government.

In this war, against the background of the Great War raging in Europe, the Liberals were said to be pro-German. This resulted in U.S. President Woodrow Wilson adding Cuba to his worries, as he was already concerned about the Mexican civil conflict and actions of Pancho Villa on the Southern border. The Cuban war resulted in the death of Frederick Funston, a friend and ally of Menocal. President Menocal declared war on Germany 7 April 1917. John J. Pershing was reassigned to United States forces in Mexico and then Europe.

Machado was appointed as Interior Minister under José Miguel Gómez. Allied with his predecessor, the outgoing president Alfredo Zayas, and running as a Liberal Party candidate in the 1924 election, Machado defeated Mario García Menocal of the Conservative Party by an overwhelming majority; he was elected as Cuba&#x27;s fifth president. He campaigned with the slogan, &quot;Water, roads, and schools&quot;.

==First term as president==
Machado took office as President of Cuba on 20 May 1925, and left office on 12 August 1933. He is noted for stating that at the end of his term he would ask for the abrogation of the Platt Amendment. Elected at the time of a fall in world sugar prices, he was a Cuban industrialist and member of the political elite of the Liberal Party. Machado&#x27;s first term (1925–1929) coincided with a period of prosperity. Sugar production expanded, and the United States provided a close and ready market. Machado embarked on an ambitious public works program. He determined to make Cuba the &quot;Switzerland of the Americas.&quot;

In April 1927, Machado visited the United States and on 23 April 1927, he met with President Calvin Coolidge. During his visit, Machado discussed with Coolidge many issues including the Platt Amendment. Whether for the sake of gaining political favour, being tactful or whatever the reason Machado firstly stated that the Platt Amendment was in fact a positive benefit to the Cuban people but he insisted on a modification of its terms as the Platt Amendment was a stigma of embarrassment among the international community insofar that it represented Cuba as lacking complete sovereignty over its affairs.

Among the public works completed during Machado&#x27;s administration, there was the Carretera Central or Central Highway which ran practically the entire length of the island, from Pinar del Rio in the west to Santiago de Cuba, a distance of over .
Machado was also responsible for the construction of El Capitolio (The Capitol), the elegant home of the Cuban Congress from 1929 to 1959. The new building, designed by Raúl Otero and Eugenio Rayneri Piedra and constructed in 1926–1929 had a neoclassical design that borrowed elements from the U.S. Capitol building and the Pantheon in Paris. Its purpose was to portray the optimism, confidence and elegance of the new democracy.

Additionally, Machado oversaw the enlargement of the University of Havana, and the expansion of health facilities. Other key buildings constructed under his administration include the Hotel Nacional de Cuba, the Asturia Center (today National Museum of Fine Arts of Havana), the Bacardi Building (Havana), Lopez Serrano and the Hotel Presidente. He also sponsored a tariff reform bill in 1927 providing protection to certain Cuban industries. Despite these accomplishments, Cuba&#x27;s dependence on sugar continued, and United States influence and investments increased.

In order to complete the financing of these projects, the President, ignoring his original pledge against foreign loans, entered into transactions with the Chase Bank Syndicate resulting by his second term in the increase of Cuba&#x27;s public debt by $86 million.

==Second term as president==

===1928 re-election===
Cosme de la Torriente y Peraza, Cuban statesman and President of the League of Nations in the 1920s, said:
According to Peraza on 9 January 1931, the following newspapers were closed upon Machado&#x27;s presidential decreeː Diario de la Marina, El Mundo, El Pais, Informacion, The Havana American, La Semana, Karikato, Carteles, and Bohemia, followed by the multiple arrests of numerous newspaper editors.

His detractors claimed he became despotic and forced his way into a second term. Throughout his campaign leading to the 1924 general election, Machado stated numerous times that he did not aspire to be reelected, but only two years into his presidency he changed his mind. In 1927 Machado pushed a series of constitutional amendments to enable him to seek re-election, which he obtained in the 1928 presidential election. This act of continuismo, coupled with growing economic depression caused by a decline in sugar prices starting in 1925, its aggravation due to the crash of 1929, and political repression, led to significant political instability. Machado also faced backlash from university students after the formation of the Directorio Estudiantil Universitario in 1927. After various protests and the death of the DEU members, most notably of Rafael Trejo, Machado closed the university in 1930.

U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull wrote, in a telegram to the incoming U.S. Ambassador to Cuba Sumner Welles on 1 May 1933, with respect to Machado&#x27;s constitutional reforms of 1927:
===Violence===
Machado survived several attempts on his life. In the most famous, a violent opposition group, the ABC (&quot;abecedarios&quot;), assassinated the President of the Cuban Senate Clemente Vazquez Bello. They had constructed a tunnel to reach the Vazquez family crypt in Havana&#x27;s Colón Cemetery and planted an explosive device there, anticipating that Machado would attend the funeral. The plan failed when the family decided to bury Vazquez in Santa Clara instead. This attempt is the basis of the 1949 Horizon Pictures film &quot;We Were Strangers.

Machado has also been credited for unleashing a wave of violence against his critics. In &quot;Machado: Crimenes y Horrores de un Regimen&quot;, Carlos G. Peraza details some of Machado&#x27;s alleged crimes. Peraza blames Machado for the death of numerous Cubans including Armando Andre y Alvarado (1926), Enrique Varona (1926), Claudio Bouzón –Noske Yalob (1928), Ponce de Leon y Perez Terradas (1928), Abelardo Pacheco (1930), Raoul Martin (1931), the three Freyre de Andrade brothers (1932) and most famously Rafael Trejo (30 September 1930).

There were numerous murders and assassinations committed by the police and army under Machado&#x27;s administration. The extent of his involvement in these is disputed. Writing to the U.S. Secretary of State, on 5 January 1933, U.S. ambassador to Cuba, Harry Frank Guggenheim noted as follows,
The following day Harry Frank Guggenheim reported to the U.S. Secretary of Stateː
Writing to the U.S. Secretary of State, on 8 April 1933, The Chargee in Cuba, Edward Reed noted:
:according to information obtained by the Embassy from sources believed to be reliable, there were several killings in and near Habana on the night of 6 April... the secret police arrested a young man named Carlos Manuel Fuertes outside of Payret Theatre in Habana. Fuertes is said to have been a member of the student directorate. Later in the night his body was found near the Eremita de las Catalinas on Ayesteran Street.

==Regime change==

In Cuba, Machado engaged in a long struggle with diverse insurgent groups, from the green shirts of the ABC to Blas Hernández to the conservative veterans of the Cuban War of Independence to the radical Antonio Guiteras group, and he clung on for several years.

In May 1933, newly appointed US ambassador Sumner Welles arrived in Cuba and initiated negotiation with the opposition groups for a government to succeed Machado&#x27;s. A provisional government headed by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada (son of Cuban independence hero Carlos Manuel de Céspedes) and including members of the ABC was brokered; it took power on 13 August 1933 amidst a general strike in Havana. Welles succeeded in weakening Machado&#x27;s government by extracting a series of concessions which tipped the balance of power in favor of the opposition.

The collapse of Machado&#x27;s government was followed by the provisional president General Alberto Herrera y Franchi (12-13 August 1933).

The collapse of Machado&#x27;s government can be traced to the beginning of negotiations between Machado&#x27;s government and opposition groups with Ambassador Welles as mediator. One of the proposed solutions to the political crisis was the appointment of a vice president who would be impartial and acceptable to all parties, followed by a leave of absence for President Machado until the 1934 general election. This plan would ensure that Machado no longer had power and, most importantly, could not tamper with the 1934 general election, while still keeping within the country&#x27;s constitutional framework. Eventually, as Machado resisted giving up power and the crisis escalated, the army revolted. Welles noted as follows on 12 August 1933 at 3 a.m.: &quot;Since the abortive revolt of the first battalion of artillery yesterday afternoon there have been several threatened revolts in divers portions of the Army insisting upon the immediate resignation of President Machado.&quot; Machado left Cuba on a flight to the Bahamas on the afternoon of 12 August 1933.

Machado died of colon cancer in Miami Beach, US in 1939 and was entombed in Miami at Woodlawn Park Cemetery and Mausoleum (now Caballero Rivero Woodlawn North Park Cemetery and Mausoleum).

Whitaker made his directorial debut with the television film &quot;Strapped&quot; (1993), and directed the films &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; (1995), &quot;Hope Floats&quot; (1998), and &quot;First Daughter&quot; (2004).

== Early life and education ==
Forest Steven Whitaker was born on July 15, 1961, in Longview, Texas, the son of Laura Francis (née Smith), a special education teacher and Forest E. Whitaker Jr., an insurance salesman. A DNA test has shown that his mother had Akan ancestry, while his father was of Igbo descent. When Whitaker was in elementary school, his family moved to Carson, California. He has two younger brothers and an older sister. His first role as an actor was the lead in Dylan Thomas&#x27;s play &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;.

Whitaker attended Palisades High School, where he played on the football team and sang in the choir, graduating in 1979. He entered California State Polytechnic University, Pomona on a football scholarship, but a back injury made him change his major to music (singing). He toured England with the Cal Poly Chamber Singers in 1980. While still at Cal Poly, he briefly changed his major to drama. He later transferred to the Thornton School of Music at the University of Southern California to study opera as a tenor and was subsequently accepted into the university&#x27;s Drama Conservatory. He graduated from USC with a BFA in acting in 1982. He then took a course at Drama Studio London at its now defunct California branch. He was pursuing a degree in &quot;The Core of Conflict: Studies in Peace and Reconciliation&quot; at New York University&#x27;s Gallatin School of Individualized Study in 2004.

== Career ==
=== 1982–1987: Rise to prominence ===

Whitaker has a long history of working with well-regarded film directors and actors. In his first onscreen performance of note, he had a supporting role playing a high school football player in the 1982 film version of Cameron Crowe&#x27;s coming-of-age teen-retrospective &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;. In 1986, he appeared in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s sports drama &quot;The Color of Money&quot; and Oliver Stone&#x27;s Vietnam War drama film &quot;Platoon&quot;. The following year, he co-starred in the comedy &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; alongside Robin Williams. 

After completing several films in the early 1980s, Whitaker gained additional roles in multiple television shows. On the series &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, he played a bully in the 1985 episode &quot;Bully for Arnold&quot;. That same year, Whitaker also played the part of a comic book salesman in the &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; episode &quot;Gather Ye Acorns&quot;. He appeared in the first and second parts of &quot;North and South&quot; in 1985 and 1986. Throughout the 1990s, Whitaker mainly had roles in made-for-cable films which aired on HBO, including &quot;Criminal Justice&quot;, &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, and &quot;Witness Protection&quot;.

=== 1988–2006: Breakthrough and acclaim === 
In 1988, Whitaker appeared in the film &quot;Bloodsport&quot; and had his first lead role starring as jazz alto saxophonist Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Bird&quot;. To prepare himself for the part, Whitaker took saxophone lessons and sequestered himself in a loft with only a bed, couch, and an alto saxophone, having also conducted extensive research and talked to numerous people who knew Parker. His performance, which has been called &quot;transcendent&quot;, earned him the Best Actor award at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Globe nomination.

Whitaker continued to work with a number of well-known directors throughout the 1990s. He starred in the 1990 film &quot;Downtown&quot; and was cast in the pivotal role of Jody, a captive British soldier in the 1992 film &quot;The Crying Game&quot;, for which he used an English accent. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; described Whitaker&#x27;s performance as &quot;big-hearted&quot;, &quot;hugely emotional&quot;, and &quot;simply terrific&quot;. He was a member of the cast that won the first ever National Board of Review Award for Best Acting by an Ensemble for Robert Altman&#x27;s film, &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot;, in 1994. In 1995, he gave a &quot;characteristically emotional performance&quot; in Wayne Wang and Paul Auster&#x27;s &quot;Smoke&quot;, and appeared in the science-fiction film Species. In 1996, he played the role of a good-natured man in &quot;Phenomenon&quot;, alongside John Travolta and Robert Duvall, which earned him a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actor – Drama, and was also nominated for NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture.
Whitaker branched out into producing and directing in the 1990s. He co-produced and co-starred in &quot;A Rage in Harlem&quot; in 1991. He made his directorial debut with a grim film about inner-city gun violence, &quot;Strapped&quot;, for HBO in 1993 – and won the International Critics&#x27; Award at the Toronto International Film Festival. In 1995, he directed his first theatrical feature, &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;, which was based on the Terry McMillan novel of the same name. Roger Ebert observed that the tone of the film resembled Whitaker&#x27;s own acting style: &quot;measured, serene, confident&quot;. Whitaker also directed co-star Whitney Houston&#x27;s music video of the movie&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Exhale (Shoop Shoop)&quot;. Whitaker continued his directing career with the 1998 romantic comedy, &quot;Hope Floats&quot;, starring Sandra Bullock and Harry Connick Jr., which he also executive produced. He directed Katie Holmes in the romantic comedy &quot;First Daughter&quot; in 2004, while also an executive producer on the film; he had previously co-starred with Holmes in &quot;Phone Booth&quot; in 2002. He gained experience as the executive producer of several made-for-television movies, most notably the 2002 Emmy-award-winning &quot;Door to Door&quot;, starring William H. Macy. 

Whitaker played a serene, pigeon-raising, bushido-following, mob hit man in &quot;Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai&quot;, a 1999 film written and directed by Jim Jarmusch. Many consider this to have been a &quot;definitive role&quot; for Whitaker. In a manner similar to his preparation for &quot;Bird&quot;, he again immersed himself in his character&#x27;s world—he studied Eastern philosophy and meditated for long hours &quot;to hone his inner spiritual hitman&quot;. Jarmusch has told interviewers that he developed the title character with Whitaker in mind; &quot;The New York Times&quot; review of the film observed that &quot;[I]t&#x27;s hard to think of another actor who could play a cold-blooded killer with such warmth and humanity.&quot; From 2002 to 2003, Whitaker was the host and narrator of 44 new episodes of the Rod Serling classic &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, which lasted one season on UPN. After working in several film roles, he returned to television in 2006 when he joined the cast of FX&#x27;s police serial &quot;The Shield&quot;, as Lieutenant Jon Kavanaugh, who was determined to prove that the lead character, Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis), is a dirty cop. As opposed to his previous character work, Whitaker stated that he merely had to draw on his childhood years growing up in South Central Los Angeles for the role. He received rave reviews for his performance—&quot;Variety&quot; called it a &quot;crackling-good guest stint&quot;—and he reprised the role in the show&#x27;s 2007 season.
Whitaker next appeared in what has been called one of the worst films ever made, the 2000 production of &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;, based on the novel of the same name by L. Ron Hubbard. The film was widely criticized as a notorious commercial and critical disaster. However, Whitaker&#x27;s performance was lauded by the film&#x27;s director, Roger Christian, who commented that, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s going to be very surprised&quot; by Whitaker, who &quot;found this huge voice and laugh.&quot; &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; won seven Razzie Awards. Whitaker later expressed his regret for participating in the film.

In 2001, Whitaker had a small, uncredited role in the Wong Kar-wai-directed &quot;The Follow&quot;, one of five short films produced by BMW that year to promote its cars. He co-starred in Joel Schumacher&#x27;s 2002 thriller &quot;Phone Booth&quot; with Kiefer Sutherland and Colin Farrell. That year, he also co-starred with Jodie Foster in &quot;Panic Room&quot;. His performance as the film&#x27;s &quot;bad guy&quot; was described as &quot;a subtle chemistry of aggression and empathy&quot;. In the fall of 2006, Whitaker started a multi-episode story arc on &quot;ER&quot; as Curtis Ames, a man who comes into the ER with a cough, but quickly faces the long-term consequences of a paralyzing stroke; he sues, then takes out his anger on Dr. Luka Kovač, who he blames for the strokes. Whitaker received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for his performance in the series. Also in 2006, Whitaker appeared in T.I.&#x27;s music video &quot;Live in the Sky&quot; alongside Jamie Foxx.

Whitaker&#x27;s 2006 portrayal of Idi Amin in the film &quot;The Last King of Scotland&quot; earned him positive reviews by critics as well as multiple awards and honors. To portray the dictator, Whitaker gained 50 pounds, learned to play the accordion, and immersed himself in research. He read books about Amin, watched news and documentary footage featuring Amin, and spent time in Uganda meeting with Amin&#x27;s friends, relatives, generals, and victims; he also learned Swahili and mastered Amin&#x27;s East African accent. His performance earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor, making him the fourth black actor in history to do so, joining the ranks of Sidney Poitier, Denzel Washington, and Jamie Foxx. In his acceptance speech, Whitaker said: &quot;When I first started acting, it was because of my desire to connect to everyone, to that thing inside each of us, that light that I believe exists in all of us. Because acting for me is about believing in that connection; and it&#x27;s a connection so strong, it&#x27;s a connection so deep that we feel it and through our combined belief we can create a new reality.&quot; For that same role, he was also recognized with the British Academy Film Award, Golden Globe Award, National Board of Review Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and accolades from the Broadcast Film Critics Association, London Film Critics&#x27; Circle Award, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, National Society of Film Critics, and New York Film Critics Circle among others. It&#x27;s the only performance to have swept these awards.

=== 2007–2018: Established actor === 
In 2007, Whitaker played Dr. James Farmer Sr. in &quot;The Great Debaters&quot;, for which he received an Image Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor. In 2008, Whitaker appeared in three films, first as a business man known only as Happiness, who likes butterflies, in the film &quot;The Air I Breathe&quot;. He also portrayed a rogue police captain in &quot;Street Kings&quot;, and a heroic tourist in &quot;Vantage Point&quot;. Whitaker was cast in the &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; spin-off &quot;Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior&quot;, that was subsequently cancelled by CBS on May 17, 2011. Under Frank Cooper, he was the creator and producer of &quot;DEWmocracy.com&quot;, an interactive video game, short film, and website that allowed people to select a new flavor of Mountain Dew. This campaign turned into the most successful launch of a soft drink in Mountain Dew&#x27;s history. Whitaker appears in the Jamie Foxx featuring T-Pain 2008 music video &quot;Blame It&quot;. 

In 2013, after a small career slump where he starred in a few straight-to-video films, Whitaker has enjoyed a career resurgence, having played the lead role in &quot;Lee Daniels&#x27; The Butler&quot;, which has become one of his greatest critical and commercial successes to date. Whitaker won the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture for that film as well as nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role. Whitaker also starred in the film &quot;Black Nativity&quot; and co-starred in 2013&#x27;s &quot;The Last Stand&quot;, playing an FBI agent chasing an escaped drug cartel leader.

In 2016, Whitaker played Saw Gerrera in the film &quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&quot;, and reprised this role for the &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; animated series. That same year he made his Broadway debut in a revival of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play &quot;Hughie&quot; at the Booth Theatre, directed by Michael Grandage. David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote of Whitaker&#x27;s performance, &quot;With his sleepy eyes, soulful voice and fluttering hands, Whitaker is a superb actor who can wear sorrow like a baggy overcoat&quot;.

Whitaker portrayed Colonel Weber in the science fiction drama film &quot;Arrival&quot; (2016) and portrayed Archbishop Desmond Tutu in 2017&#x27;s &quot;The Forgiven&quot;. In 2017 and 2018, Whitaker had an eleven-episode arc on &quot;Empire&quot;, which saw him reunited with Lee Daniels after their work together on &quot;The Butler&quot;. For his portrayal of Zuri in the Ryan Coogler directed Marvel Cinematic Universe action adventure film &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2018), Whitaker shared in winning the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.

=== 2019–present === 

Whitaker&#x27;s voice and likeness were used for Saw Gerrera in the 2019 video game &quot;Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order&quot;.

In 2020, Whitaker starred as Jeronicus Jangle in the Netflix Christmas musical &quot;Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey&quot;. He appeared as Reverend C. L.

Carter&#x27;s novel &quot;The Emperor of Ocean Park&quot;. He was originally set to appear in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s project &quot;Megalopolis&quot; but turned down the offer and his role given to Laurence Fishburne.

He produced numerous projects through his production company, Spirit Dance Entertainment, which he shut down in 2005 to concentrate on his acting career.

=== Significant Productions === 
Whitaker&#x27;s current company, Significant Productions, is devoted to creating opportunities for underrepresented narratives and storytellers by championing films and television shows starring people of color, alongside diversified representation behind the camera. Whitaker and his partner Nina Yang Bongiovi produced Ryan Coogler&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot;, which won the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award for U.S. dramatic film at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, and won Prize of the Future at Cannes. They also launched the career of Chloé Zhao, with &quot;Songs My Brothers Taught Me&quot; (2015).

Since Whitaker joined as co-chair, five projects have been greenlit for production.

== Music producer ==
Whitaker worked closely with Babyface as the executive producer to the soundtrack for &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;, which Whitaker directed.

He also appears in the music video &quot;In the Dark&quot; by Bring Me the Horizon, released on October 21, 2019,

== Activism ==
=== Charity work ===
Over the past decade, Whitaker has spent much of his time dedicated to humanitarian work. These pursuits were partially motivated by a core lesson his mother taught him: &quot;You don&#x27;t have to believe what I believe, but you have to believe in something,&quot; which Whitaker has discussed giving structure to much of his life.

He founded the Whitaker Peace &amp; Development Initiative (WPDI), a non-governmental organization, in 2012. WPDI implements peace-building programs in conflict affected communities throughout the world, which are focused on training youths in conflict resolution and developing businesses in areas of conflict. WPDI&#x27;s programs are currently operating throughout Africa, Mexico, and the United States.

Whitaker was inducted as a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for Peace and Reconciliation, in a ceremony at UNESCO headquarters on June 21, 2011. As Goodwill Ambassador, Whitaker worked with UNESCO to support and develop initiatives that empower youths and keep them from entering or remaining in cycles of violence. At the induction ceremony, U.S. Ambassador to UNESCO David Killion described Whitaker as a &quot;perfect choice as a Goodwill Ambassador... he has exemplified compassion in every area of his life, with humility and grace. He does this because it&#x27;s the right thing to do.&quot; Following his increased work in conflict-impacted regions, Whitaker was then promoted to a UNESCO Special Envoy for Peace and Reconciliation, and was a member of President Obama&#x27;s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. He previously served on President Obama&#x27;s Urban Policy Committee and started collaborating with the Office of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict as an Advocate for Children Affected by War, a topic on which he was invited to speak before the UN Security Council in September 2014. Whitaker worked with elementary schools through the Turnaround Arts organization. Additionally, he is on the steering committee for the UN&#x27;s work with the Reintegration of Child Soldiers after having been an Advocate for Children Affected by War, and is an Advocate for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

He is also a supporter and public advocate for Hope North, a boarding school and vocational training center in northern Uganda for escaped child soldiers, orphans, and other young victims of the country&#x27;s civil war.

Above all, Whitaker believes that ordinary people can and must come together to change the world. In his own words, &quot;Even a seemingly small action can cause ripples that make an enormous impact.&quot;

=== Politics ===
In politics, Whitaker supported and spoke on behalf of Senator Barack Obama in his 2008 presidential campaign. On April 6, 2009, he was given a chieftaincy title in Imo State, Nigeria. Whitaker, who was named a chief among the Igbo community of Nkwerre, was given the title Nwannedinamba of Nkwerre, which means &quot;A Brother in a Foreign Land&quot;.

Whitaker co-founded the International Institute for Peace (IIP) at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey, where he is also a senior research scholar. Launched during the international Newark Peace Education Summit, IIP&#x27;s mission is to develop programs and strategic partnerships to address issues such as increasing citizen security through community-building; the role of women and spiritual and religious leaders in peacebuilding; the impact of climate change; and the reduction of poverty. IIP operates under the auspices of UNESCO.

== Personal life ==
In 1996, Whitaker married actress Keisha Nash (1972–2023), whom he met on the set of &quot;Blown Away&quot;. As a couple, they had four children: two daughters together (Sonnet and True), and his son (Ocean Alexander) and her daughter (Autumn) from their previous relationships. In December 2018, Whitaker filed for divorce from Nash, citing irreconcilable differences.

Whitaker studies yoga, has a black belt in kenpō and is a vegetarian. He also trains in eskrima, originally under Dan Inosanto and currently with Joe Jackson. In 2021, it was announced that he had joined NBA Africa as a minority owner and strategic investor.

Whitaker&#x27;s left eye ptosis has been called &quot;intriguing&quot; by the critic Susan Wloszczyna, with the writer Stephanie Zacharek maintaining that it gives him &quot;a sleepy, contemplative look&quot;. Whitaker has explained that the condition is hereditary and that he has considered having surgery to correct it, not for cosmetic reasons but because it affects his vision.

His ancestry has been traced to Nkwerre in Imo State of Nigeria, where he was made an honorary titled chief on April 5, 2009.

<text>Helen Clark MacInnes (October 7, 1907 – September 30, 1985) was a Scottish-American writer of espionage novels.

==Life==
She and her husband emigrated to the United States in 1937, when he took an academic position at Columbia University in New York, while retaining his role in the British MI6, for foreign espionage. MacInnes published her first novel during World War II, and her early novels are all based in that setting. Later she wrote more about characters within the context of the Cold War.

==Early life==
Helen Clark MacInnes was born on October 7, 1907, in Glasgow to Donald MacInnes and Jessica McDiarmid, and had a traditional Scots Presbyterian upbringing. MacInnes graduated from the University of Glasgow in Scotland in 1928 with an MA in French and German. MacInnes continued her studies at University College, London, where she received a diploma in librarianship in 1931.

While working as a librarian, MacInnes met the classics scholar Gilbert Highet. The pair married on September 22, 1932, and moved to New York City in 1937. The pair had one child, Keith Highet, who was born in 1933 and became an eminent international lawyer.

==Career==
In the early 1930s, MacInnes had collaborated with Highet to translate German literature, which helped finance their summer travels through Europe. These European excursions gave MacInnes exposure to locations that she used later as settings for her espionage thrillers.

MacInnes accepted an appointment as a special cataloguer for the Ferguson Collection at the University of Glasgow. She worked with the Dunbartonshire Education Authority to select books for county libraries. In 1932, Gilbert Highet accepted a classics teaching appointment at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford. While in Oxford, MacInnes performed as an amateur actress with the Oxford University Dramatic Society and the Oxford Experimental Theatre.

One of MacInnes’ greatest inspirations in writing on foreign affairs and espionage was her honeymoon to the European mainland, Bavaria in particular. As she and Highet witnessed the oppression of the German totalitarian regime, she swore to write against the oppressive forces of the Nazi government. MacInnes even kept notes about the different governments she saw in her travels with Highet that she would refer back to when she began writing full-time.

Highet served as a British intelligence agent in MI6 in addition to working as a classical scholar. Highet continued his work with MI6 after he and MacInnes moved to the U.S. in 1937. That year he accepted an appointment as a professor and chairman of the department of classics (Latin and Greek) at Columbia University in New York City. When the couple moved there permanently, MacInnes began her writing career. Highet&#x27;s work in intelligence, in addition to MacInnes&#x27;s own research and traveling, influenced her writing. MacInnes and Highet produced two books together, translations of German works.

In 1939, the couple&#x27;s son was taken to hospital with a ruptured appendix. During this episode, Highet came across MacInnes&#x27;s notes and commentary on Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, and other matters of contemporary politics. He encouraged her to use them as the basis for a novel.

During the following 45 years, MacInnes wrote 21 espionage thrillers, four of which were later adapted as films. Her early books were set during the Second World War, often featuring lay people who become spies or otherwise caught up in acting on behalf of the Allied war effort. MacInnes became a U.S. citizen in 1952.

MacInnes’ first novel, &quot;Above Suspicion&quot;, was published in 1941 and remains one of her most famous works. The plot was loosely tied to her travels with Highet and his work in particular with MI6. It follows the journey of newlywed English couple Frances and Richard Myles overseas as they are charged with going “above the suspicion” of the Nazi regime to seek out an undercover spy living in Austria to determine if his position as informant and his information is still valid. It was adapted into a film in 1943 by MGM director Richard Thorpe, and was promoted with the tagline “It happened on a honeymoon,” a parallel between MacInnes and Highet and the Myles couple. MacInnes&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Assignment in Brittany&quot; (1942), was made required reading for Allied intelligence agents who were being sent to work with the French resistance against the Nazis. It was featured on the &quot;New York Times&quot; first fiction bestseller list, in 1942. Her 1944 book, &quot;The Unconquerable&quot;, gives such an accurate portrayal of the Polish resistance that some reviewers and readers thought she was using classified information given to her by her husband.

In her later books, MacInnes shifted her subject matter from World War II to the Cold War. &quot;The Venetian Affair,&quot; for example, was published in 1963, and set in Paris and Venice; it involved Soviet agents and sleeper cells, alluded to events unfolding in Algeria and Vietnam, and contained a conspiracy to assassinate Charles de Gaulle. She continued to produce about one book every two years until her final novel &quot;Ride a Pale Horse&quot; (1984).

MacInnes’ career was not dotted with many awards, although she did win the 1966 Iona University Columbia Prize for Literature. This is most directly related to her influence in the state of New York, seeing as her first sixteen novels (those written up to 1966) each spent time on the international best sellers’ list (according to a 1974 People Magazine article).

A review in The New York Times praised MacInnes&#x27; body of work for its &quot;unfailing eye for vivid backgrounds, her deft control of complex story lines, and her clear-cut presentation of each important member of her casts. These common qualities have given her work a kind of grandeur, a romantic overtone suggesting knights in mortal combat.&quot; Many of MacInnes’ novels are continuing to be renewed for print, cementing her legacy as one of the trailblazing female international affairs novelists in the World War II and Cold War eras.

Her husband Gilbert Highet died in 1978. MacInnes died in New York City on September 30, 1985, at age 77, following a stroke she had suffered three weeks earlier.

MacInnes&#x27;s writing reflects an affinity for Arthur Koestler and Rebecca West, as she strongly opposed any form of tyranny and totalitarianism.

<doc id="634437" wikidata="Q5375688" url="?curid=634437" title="Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop">
<text>The Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop or Rock and Pop by Australian music journalist Ian McFarlane is a guide to Australian popular music from the 1950s to the late 1990s. The book has a similar title to the 1978 work by Noel McGrath, &quot;Australian Encyclopaedia of Rock and Pop&quot;, but is not otherwise related.

Publishers, Allen &amp; Unwin described McFarlane&#x27;s encyclopedia as containing over 870 entries and an &quot;essential reference to the bands and artists who molded the shape of Australian popular music [...] in an A-to-Z encyclopedia format complete with biographical and historical details. Each entry also includes listings of original band lineups and subsequent changes, record releases, career highlights, and cross-references with related bands and artists.&quot;

The first edition is out of print, but was for a time available on the whammo.com.au online record store, and is still in the Internet Archive. In 2017 a second edition was published by Third Stone Press.

==Reviews==
The first edition was described in &quot;Australian Music Guide&quot; as &quot;the most exhaustive and wide-ranging encyclopedia of Australian music from the 1950s onwards&quot;. 

The second edition appeared in 2017 and was updated to 2016. Steven Carroll of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; opined that &quot;Any survey of Australian pop and rock that includes entries on such bands as Serious Young Insects (via Boom Crash Opera) is a serious tome. It&#x27;s so easy to get lost in this revised edition: one band leading to another, and so on, until you&#x27;re suddenly asking yourself what happened to the last hour.&quot;

<text>Robert Morrison MacIver (April 17, 1882 – June 15, 1970) was a sociologist and political scientist.

==Early life and family==
Robert Morrison MacIver was born in Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, Scotland on April 17, 1882, to Donald MacIver, a general merchant and tweed manufacturer, and Christina MacIver (née Morrison). His father was a Calvinist, specifically, Scottish Presbyterian. On 14 August 1911 he married Elizabeth Marion Peterkin. They had three children: Ian Tennant Morrison, Christina Elizabeth, and Donald Gordon.

==Education==
He received degrees from the University of Edinburgh (M.A. 1903; D.Ph. 1915), the University of Oxford (B.A. 1907), and Columbia University (Litt.E. 1929) and Harvard (1936). In his rather long period of formal education, he had never made any academically supervised study of sociology. His work in that field was distinguished by his acumen, his philosophical understanding, and extensive study of the major pioneering works of Durkheim, Levy-Bruhl, Simmel and others in the British Museum Library in London, while resident as a student in Oxford.

==Career==
He was a university Lecturer in Political Science (1907) and sociology (1911) at the University of Aberdeen. He left Aberdeen in 1915 for a post at the University of Toronto where he was Professor of Political Science and later Head of department from 1922 to 1927. MacIver was vice chairman of the Canada War Labor Board from 1917 to 1918. In 1927 he accepted an invitation from Barnard College of Columbia University in New York City, where he became professor of Social Science from 1927 to 1936. He was subsequently named Lieber Professor of Political Science and Sociology at Columbia University and taught there from 1929 to 1950. He was president, beginning in 1963 until 1965, and then chancellor of The New School for Social Research from 1965 to 1966.

He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. He was a member of the American Sociological Society, and was elected as its 30th President in 1940. He was a member of the Institut International de Sociologie and of Phi Beta Kappa.

==Activism==
In the 1950s, MacIver was activist at Boris Gourevitch&#x27;s the Union for the Protection of the Human Person. Among its activities, with Albert Simard, in 1955, the three signed a letter addressed to South Africa on equality.

<doc id="634444" wikidata="Q211606" url="?curid=634444" title="Social structure">
<text>In the social sciences, social structure is the aggregate of patterned social arrangements in society that are both emergent from and determinant of the actions of individuals. Likewise, society is believed to be grouped into structurally related groups or sets of roles, with different functions, meanings, or purposes. Examples of social structure include family, religion, law, economy, and class. It contrasts with &quot;social system&quot;, which refers to the parent structure in which these various structures are embedded. Thus, social structures significantly influence larger systems, such as economic systems, legal systems, political systems, cultural systems, etc. Social structure can also be said to be the framework upon which a society is established. It determines the norms and patterns of relations between the various institutions of the society.

Since the 1920s, the term has been in general use in social science, especially as a variable whose sub-components needed to be distinguished in relationship to other sociological variables, as well as in academic literature, as result of the rising influence of structuralism. The concept of &quot;social stratification&quot;, for instance, uses the idea of &quot;social structure&quot; to explain that most societies are separated into different &quot;strata&quot; (levels), guided (if only partially) by the underlying structures in the social system. There are three conditions for a social class to be steady, that of class cohesiveness, the self-consciousness of classes, and the self-awareness of one&#x27;s own class. It is also important in the modern study of organizations, as an organization&#x27;s structure may determine its flexibility, capacity to change, and success. In this sense, structure is an important issue for management. 

On the &quot;macro&quot; scale, social structure pertains to the system of socioeconomic stratification (most notably the class structure), social institutions, or other patterned relations between large social groups. On the &quot;meso&quot; scale, it concerns the structure of social networks between individuals or organizations. On the &quot;micro&quot; scale, &quot;social structure&quot; includes the ways in which &#x27;norms&#x27; shape the behavior of individuals within the social system. These scales are not always kept separate. Social norms are the shared standards of acceptable behavior by a group. When norms are internalized, they take on a &quot;for granted&quot; quality and are difficult to alter on the individual and societal levels.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The early study of social structures has considerably informed the study of institutions, culture and agency, social interaction, and history.

Alexis de Tocqueville was supposedly the first to use the term &quot;social structure&quot;. Later, Karl Marx, Herbert Spencer, Ferdinand Tönnies, Émile Durkheim, and Max Weber would all contribute to structural concepts in sociology. The latter, for example, investigated and analyzed the institutions of modern society: market, bureaucracy (private enterprise and public administration), and politics (e.g. democracy).

One of the earliest and most comprehensive accounts of social structure was provided by Karl Marx, who related political, cultural, and religious life to the mode of production (an underlying economic structure). Marx argued that the economic base substantially determined the cultural and political superstructure of a society. Subsequent Marxist accounts, such as that of Louis Althusser, proposed a more complex relationship that asserted the relative autonomy of cultural and political institutions, and a general determination by economic factors only &quot;in the last instance.&quot;

In 1905, German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies published his study &quot;The Present Problems of Social Structure&quot;, in which he argues that only the &quot;constitution&quot; of a multitude into a unity creates a &quot;social structure&quot;, basing his approach on his concept of social will.

Émile Durkheim, drawing on the analogies between biological and social systems popularized by Herbert Spencer and others, introduced the idea that diverse social institutions and practices played a role in assuring the functional integration of society through assimilation of diverse parts into a unified and self-reproducing whole. In this context, Durkheim distinguished two forms of structural relationship: mechanical solidarity and organic solidarity. The former describes structures that unite similar parts through a shared culture, while the latter describes differentiated parts united through social exchange and material interdependence.

As did Marx and Weber, Georg Simmel, more generally, developed a wide-ranging approach that provided observations and insights into domination and subordination; competition; division of labor; formation of parties; representation; inner solidarity and external exclusiveness; and many similar features of the state, religious communities, economic associations, art schools, and of family and kinship networks. However diverse the interests that give rise to these associations, the forms in which interests are realized may yet be identical.

=== Later developments ===
The notion of social structure was extensively developed in the 20th century with key contributions from structuralist perspectives drawing on theories of Claude Lévi-Strauss, as well as feminist, marxist, functionalist (e.g. those developed by Talcott Parsons and followers), and a variety of other analytic perspectives. Some follow Marx in trying to identify the basic dimensions of society that explain the other dimensions, most emphasizing either economic production or political power. Others follow Lévi-Strauss in seeking logical order in cultural structures. Still others, notably Peter Blau, follow Simmel in attempting to base a formal theory of social structure on numerical patterns in relationships—analyzing, for example, the ways in which factors like group size shape intergroup relations.

The notion of social structure is intimately related to a variety of central topics in social science, including the relation of structure and agency. The most influential attempts to combine the concept of social structure with agency are Anthony Giddens&#x27; theory of structuration and Pierre Bourdieu&#x27;s practice theory. Giddens emphasizes the duality of structure and agency, in the sense that structures and agency cannot be conceived apart from one another. This permits him to argue that structures are neither independent of actors nor determining of their behavior, but rather sets of rules and competencies on which actors draw, and which, in the aggregate, they reproduce. Giddens&#x27;s analysis, in this respect, closely parallels Jacques Derrida&#x27;s deconstruction of the binaries that underlie classic sociological and anthropological reasoning (notably the universalizing tendencies of Lévi-Strauss&#x27;s structuralism). Bourdieu&#x27;s practice theory also seeks a more subtle account of social structure as embedded in, rather than determinative of, individual behavior.

Other recent work by Margaret Archer (morphogenesis theory), Tom R. Burns and Helena Flam (actor-system dynamics theory and social rule system theory), and Immanuel Wallerstein (World Systems Theory) provide elaborations and applications of the sociological classics in structural sociology.

==Definitions and concepts==
As noted above, social structure has been conceptualized as:
* the relationship of definite entities or groups to each other;
* the enduring patterns of behaviour by participants in a social system in relation to each other; and
* the institutionalised norms or cognitive frameworks that structure the actions of actors in the social system.

=== Institutional vs Relational ===
Furthermore, Lopez and Scott (2000) distinguish between two types of structure:

* Institutional structure: &quot;social structure is seen as comprising those cultural or normative patterns that define the expectations of [&quot;sic&quot;] agents hold about each other&#x27;s behaviour and that organize their enduring relations with each other.&quot;
* Relational structure: &quot;social structure is seen as comprising the relationships themselves, understood as patterns of causal interconnection and interdependence among agents and their actions, as well as the positions that they occupy.&quot;

=== Micro vs Macro ===
Social structure can also be divided into microstructure and macrostructure:

* Microstructure: The pattern of relations between most basic elements of social life, that cannot be further divided and have no social structure of their own (e.g. pattern of relations between individuals in a group composed of individuals, where individuals have no social structure; or a structure of organizations as a pattern of relations between social positions or social roles, where those positions and roles have no structure by themselves). 
* Macrostructure: The pattern of relations between objects that have their own structure (e.g. a political social structure between political parties, as political parties have their own social structure).

=== Other types ===
Sociologists also distinguish between:

*Normative structures: pattern of relations in a given structure (organization) between norms and modes of operations of people of varying social positions
*Ideal structures: pattern of relations between beliefs and views of people of varying social positions
*Interest structures: pattern of relations between goals and desires of people of varying social positions
*Interaction structures: forms of communication of people of varying social positions
Modern sociologists sometimes differentiate between three types of social structures:

* Relation structures: family or larger family-like clan structures 
* Communication structures: structures in which information is passed (e.g. in organizations)
* Sociometric structures: structures of sympathy, antipathy, and indifference in organizations. This was studied by Jacob L. Moreno.

Social rule system theory reduces the structures of (3) to particular rule system arrangements, i.e. the types of basic structures of (1 and 2). It shares with role theory, organizational and institutional sociology, and network analysis the concern with structural properties and developments and at the same time provides detailed conceptual tools needed to generate interesting, fruitful propositions and models and analyses.

==Origin and development of structures==
Some believe that social structure develops naturally, caused by larger systemic needs (e.g. the need for labour, management, professional, and military functions), or by conflicts between groups (e.g. competition among political parties or élites and masses). Others believe that structuring is not a result of natural processes, but of social construction. Research from scholars Nicole M. Stephens and Sarah Townsend demonstrated that the cultural mismatch between institutions&#x27; ideals of independence and the interdependence common among working-class individuals can hinder workers&#x27; opportunities to succeed.
In this sense, social structure may be created by the power of élites who seek to retain their power, or by economic systems that place emphasis upon competition or upon cooperation.

Ethnography has contributed to understandings about social structure by revealing local practices and customs that differ from Western practices of hierarchy and economic power in its construction.

Social structures can be influenced by individuals, but individuals are often influenced by agents of socialization (e.g., the workplace, family, religion, and school). The way these agents of socialization influence individualism varies on each separate member of society; however, each agent is critical in the development of self-identity.

==Critical implications==
The notion of social structure may mask systematic biases, as it involves many identifiable sub-variables (e.g. gender). Some argue that men and women who have otherwise equal qualifications receive different treatment in the workplace because of their gender, which would be termed a &quot;social structural&quot; bias, but other variables (such as time on the job or hours worked) might be masked. Modern social structural analysis takes this into account through multivariate analysis and other techniques, but the analytic problem of how to combine various aspects of social life into a whole remains.

== Development of Individualism ==
Sociologists such as Georges Palante have written on how social structures coerce our individuality and social groups by shaping the actions, thoughts, and beliefs of every individual human being. In terms of agents of socialization, social structures are slightly influenced by individuals but individuals are more greatly influenced by them. Some examples of these agents of socialization are the workplace, family, religion, and school. The way these agents of socialization influence your individualism varies on each one; however, they all play a big role in your self-identity development. Agents of socialization can also affect how you see yourself individually or as part of a collective. Our identities are constructed through social influences that we encounter in our daily lives. The way you are raised to view your individuality can hinder your ability to succeed by capping your abilities or it could become an obstacle in certain environments in which individuality is embraced like colleges or friend groups.

<text>Gaius Blossius (; 2nd century BC) was, according to Plutarch, a philosopher and student of the Stoic philosopher Antipater of Tarsus, from the city of Cumae in Campania, Italy, who (along with the Greek rhetorician, Diophanes) instigated Roman tribune Tiberius Gracchus to pursue a land reform movement on behalf of the plebs. Tiberius was accused by his political opponents of attempting to provoke a popular uprising, and have himself crowned King. Eventually, he was assassinated, and his body thrown into the river Tiber.

After the death of Tiberius Gracchus, Blossius was interrogated by the consuls on the matter. Blossius freely admitted that he had done anything Tiberius had asked. The consuls asked &quot;What? What would you do if Tiberius ordered you to burn the Capitol?&quot; He answered that Tiberius would never have given such an order. Being pressed on the point, though, Blossius eventually stated that Tiberius would only have ordered such a thing, if it were in the true interests of the Roman people. After that, he was released. Blossius went to the province of Asia, where he took part in Aristonicus&#x27; popular uprising against Rome, aiding in the organization of the Heliopolis state. When the uprising was ultimately defeated, he killed himself.

==In literature==

Blossius is a sympathetic character in Steven Saylor&#x27;s novel &quot;Roma&quot;. Saylor follows the known facts of Blossius&#x27; life, but adds a long-lasting love relationship between him and a Patrician Roman woman, which is not attested in historical sources.

<doc id="634456" wikidata="Q332968" url="?curid=634456" title="Susan Kramer, Baroness Kramer">
<text>Susan Veronica Kramer, Baroness Kramer PC (&quot;née&quot; Richards; born 21 July 1950) is a British politician and life peer who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond Park from 2005 to 2010. A member of the Liberal Democrats, she was their Treasury Spokesperson from 2015 to 2017 and 2017 to 2019.

Born in Holborn, Kramer was privately educated at St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School before studying at St Hilda&#x27;s College, University of Oxford and the University of Illinois. Prior to entering the House of Commons, she pursued a career in infrastructure finance and in 2000 was a candidate in the London mayoral election. She served as Minister of State for Transport in the Cameron–Clegg coalition.

==Early life and career==
Susan Veronica Richards was born in Holborn, London, on 22 July 1950. She was educated at St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, an independent school in London. She then read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at St Hilda&#x27;s College, University of Oxford. She served as the President of the Oxford Union in 1971, the second woman ever to be elected to the position. She then earned her MBA at the University of Illinois in the United States. She began her career in finance, and rose to become a Vice-President of Citibank in Chicago. She and her husband then set up Infrastructure Capital Partners, a firm which advised on infrastructure projects, primarily in Central and Eastern Europe. 

==Political career==
===Early candidacies===
Kramer contested Dulwich and West Norwood in 1997, coming third behind the Labour incumbent Tessa Jowell and the Conservative candidate Roger W. Gough. In 1999, she was on the Liberal Democrat party list for the London constituency at the European Parliament elections, though she was not elected. The following year, she stood as the Liberal Democrat candidate in the election for Mayor of London against Ken Livingstone, and other candidates. She finished fourth with 11.9% of the vote. In March 2003, she again sought the party&#x27;s nomination for Mayor of London, but was beaten in a three-way race for the candidacy by Simon Hughes. 

===Member of Parliament===
In September 2003, Kramer was selected as the prospective parliamentary candidate for the constituency of Richmond Park in South West London, following the decision of the sitting Liberal Democrat MP, Jenny Tonge, to stand down at the next election. Kramer was then elected as the MP for the constituency at the May 2005 general election. Kramer was appointed as the Liberal Democrat spokesperson on International Development by the new party leader, Sir Menzies Campbell, in March 2006. She succeeded Ed Davey as Trade &amp; Industry spokesperson nine months later. In 2007 she became the party&#x27;s Transport spokesperson. When Nick Clegg was appointed as Liberal Democrat Leader, Kramer received a demotion to a spokesperson for the Cabinet Office. She later regained the Transport post in a subsequent reshuffle. In January 2009, she resigned from the party&#x27;s front bench to defend her seat from a renewed Conservative campaign to regain Richmond. Kramer was one of the contributors to the &quot;Orange Book&quot; (2004). 

Kramer was involved in a breach of electoral rules when her son made four monthly donations of £332 between December 2008 and March 2009 to her campaign while not on the electoral register. A Liberal Democrat spokeswoman said to the press Jonathan Kramer was unaware his name had fallen off the register, and that the money was paid back once the error was pointed out.

====Voting record and positions====

Kramer rarely rebelled against Liberal Democrat policy in terms of voting. She has voted against the introduction of national ID cards, against the renewal of the Trident defence system, and for an elected House of Lords.

Kramer took a keen interest in London transport, in particular regarding high-speed rail and the Thameslink Programme. Despite her initial enthusiasm about the opening of High Speed 1, she became more mixed on the issue, citing in 2007 during a debate with a number of Labour MPs that &quot;significant numbers of business customers in south-west London have been happy to make the easy journey by train to Waterloo, but that they simply jump in a cab to go to Gatwick or Heathrow. It is unfortunate, but their passenger business will largely be lost, as the journey to St Pancras will be more than an hour longer than the current journey to Waterloo.&quot; Kramer&#x27;s district of Richmond Park is situated in an area served by South West Trains which provides service into Waterloo station rather than the newly opened St Pancras International station which replaced the former as the London terminus for Eurostar; she later argued for possible use of both stations.

In addition, she echoed her discontent with the management of the Thameslink Programme, originally meant to improve cross-Thames rail travel, claiming it failed to meet set targets and that its cash flow has been poorly managed. She consistently supported Crossrail and was a member of the Crossrail Bill Committee. Kramer voiced her opposition to the expansion of Heathrow Airport and submitted an early day motion that gained support from 54 MPs, 38 from her own party and 16 from the Labour Party. As early as her maiden speech, she opposed the airport&#x27;s expansion. This opposition was one of her key goals as a Member of Parliament.

On civil rights, Kramer voted for amendments to the Equality Act 2006 that would ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender reassignment. Along with all other Liberal Democrat MPs, she voted to allow Gurkhas permanent settlement rights in the United Kingdom, overriding previous legislation which denied such rights.

===Local issues===
In early January 2009, Kramer stepped down from the Liberal Democrat Front Bench to focus on local issues impacting her constituency. The principal cause stated was to coordinate opposition to further development of Heathrow Airport, whose incoming aircraft routinely overfly the constituency on their landing approach to the airport.

===After 2010===
In 2010, Kramer faced a challenge from Conservative Zac Goldsmith, defending a notional majority of 3,649 (7.2%). with Goldsmith emerging victorious by 4,091 votes. In November 2010, she lost the election to become President of the Liberal Democrats to Tim Farron by 47% of votes to Farron&#x27;s 53%.

Later in the month, it was announced that she would be made a life peer, and was created Baroness Kramer, of Richmond Park in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames on 22 December 2010. On 4 October 2012, she appeared as a panellist on BBC&#x27;s Question Time. In October 2013, Kramer was appointed Minister of State at the Department for Transport. which she held until the May 2015 General Election.

Following the 2015 election she was appointed as the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson under Tim Farron.

==Personal life==
She married an American banker, John Davis Kramer, in 1972, while working at Citibank. He died in September 2006. She has 2 children and 3 grandchildren. Kramer is a patron of the Friends of Richmond Park, as well as Home Start, the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, the Three Wings Trust and the Environment Trust.

She lives in Barnes, London.

<text>Claude Émile Jean-Baptiste Litre (1716–1778) is a fictional character created in 1978 by Kenneth Woolner of the University of Waterloo to justify the use of a capital L to denote litres.

The International System of Units usually only permits the use of a capital letter when a unit is named after a person. The lower-case character l might be difficult to distinguish from the upper-case character I or the digit 1 in certain fonts and styles, and therefore both the lower-case (l) and the upper-case (L) are allowed as the symbol for &quot;litre&quot;. The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology now recommends the use of the uppercase letter L, a practice that is also widely followed in Canada and Australia.

Woolner perpetrated the April Fools&#x27; Day hoax in the April 1978 issue of &quot;CHEM 13 News&quot;, a newsletter concerned with chemistry for school teachers. According to the hoax, Claude Litre was born on 12 February 1716, the son of a manufacturer of wine bottles. During Litre&#x27;s extremely distinguished fictional scientific career, he purportedly proposed a unit of volume measurement that was incorporated into the International System of Units after his death in 1778.

The hoax was mistakenly printed as fact in the IUPAC journal &quot;Chemistry International&quot; and subsequently retracted. In reality, the litre derives its name from the &quot;litron&quot;, an old French unit of dry volume.

<text>The Church of the Lutheran Confession (CLC) is a conservative Christian religious body theologically adhering to confessional Lutheran doctrine. Founded in 1960 in Minnesota, it has approximately 85 congregations in 24 U.S. states, and missions in Canada, India, Africa, Nepal, and Myanmar.

The CLC maintains its headquarters at its ministerial college; Immanuel Lutheran High School, College &amp; Seminary in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.

==Historical background==

Various Lutheran congregations left their synods during the 1950s and were independent at first. They began meeting together in 1957. The Church of the Lutheran Confession (CLC) was formed around the time of the break-up of the Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America in 1963.

The CLC was created primarily (though not solely) from congregations that broke away from the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) and the Evangelical Lutheran Synod (ELS) because of a doctrinal difference in the matter of church fellowship. The CLC maintained that the WELS and ELS did not follow scriptural principles (Romans 16:17-18) when they did not break with the Synodical Conference and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod after they had publicly recognized doctrinal error within those bodies .

While there were joint talks in the 1990s between the CLC and the WELS and ELS to resolve the dispute, no resolution was reached. More recently, the CLC has been in formal discussions with the WELS and ELS over doctrinal issues. The goal of these discussions has been to establish doctrinal unity. In 2015, the &quot;Joint Statement Regarding the Termination of Fellowship&quot; was drafted by those involved in the discussions. However, the 2017 CLC General Pastoral Conference recommended that the 2018 CLC Convention not adopt the &quot;Joint Statement&quot; as a resolution of the doctrinal difference in this matter, since it is unclear and contains some ambiguities.

==Beliefs and practice==

===Core beliefs===
The CLC teaches that the Bible is the only authoritative source for doctrine. It subscribes to the Lutheran Confessions (the Book of Concord, 1580) as an accurate presentation of what Scripture teaches. It is strongly linked to the concept of &quot;sola scriptura&quot;—scripture alone, and its website states, &quot;If it is not Scripture; it is not Lutheran.&quot;

===Ecumenical relations===
Fellowship between the CLC and other church groups is established only upon investigation and confirmation that both church groups hold complete unity in scriptural doctrine and practice.

The CLC is currently in fellowship with several worldwide synods, some founded through mission work by the CLC.

==Publishing and publications==
The CLC Bookhouse is the official publishing house for the CLC. It is devoted to publishing Christian literature and CLC related religious materials, as well as several CLC periodicals. The CLC Bookhouse also offers books and items from other publishing houses.

CLC periodicals include:
* &quot;The Lutheran Spokesman&quot; — the CLC&#x27;s monthly family magazine
* &quot;Ministry by Mail&quot; — printed and online sermons for CLC members at a distance from their church
* &quot;The Journal of Theology&quot; — a quarterly theological magazine
* &quot;The Witness&quot; — an e-newsletter 

CLC educational materials include:
* &quot;God&#x27;s Hand in our Lives&quot; — the CLC Sunday School Series
* &quot;Learn From Me&quot; — an adult instruction manual

<text>George Michael Moser (17 January 1706 – 24 January 1783) was an artist and enameller of the 18th century, father of floral painter Mary Moser, and, with his daughter, among the founder members of the Royal Academy in 1768.

==Biography==
He was the son of Michael Moser, an eminent Swiss engineer and worker in metal. Moser was born in Schaffhausen, Switzerland and trained initially as a coppersmith in Geneva. He later learnt additional skills as a chaser, goldsmith and engraver.

He moved to London during the 1720s and married Mary Guynier. Surviving metal works by him include elaborate gold snuffboxes and watch-cases (including movements by noted watchmakers George Philip Strigel and John Ellicott, among others), and silver candlesticks in the Rococo style.

He subsequently rose to be head of his profession as a gold-chaser, medallist, and enameller, and was particularly distinguished for the compositions in enamel with which he ornamented the backs of watches, bracelets, and other trinkets. A beautiful example of this work was a watch-case executed for Queen Charlotte, adorned with whole-length figures of her two eldest children, for which he received &#x27;a hatful of guineas.&#x27; Moser was drawing-master to George III during his boyhood, and on his accession to the throne was employed to engrave his first great seal. When the art school afterwards known as the St. Martin&#x27;s Lane Academy was established about 1736, in Greyhound Court, Strand, he became manager and treasurer, and continued in that position until the school was absorbed in the Royal Academy. 

Moser was an original member, and afterwards a director, of the Incorporated Society of Artists, whose seal he designed and executed, and was one of the 21 directors whose retirement, in 1767, led to the establishment of the Royal Academy. To Moser&#x27;s zeal and energy the latter event was largely due. In association with William Chambers, Benjamin West, and Francis Cotes, he framed the constitution of the new body, and on 28 November 1768, presented the memorial to the king asking for his patronage.

He became a foundation member, and was elected the first keeper, having rooms assigned to him in Somerset House. For this position he was well qualified by his powers as a draughtsman and knowledge of the human figure, while his ability and devotion as a teacher gained for him the strong affection of the pupils. He taught many notable artists including William Blake. Another student was his nephew Joseph Moser.

Moser was greatly esteemed in private life, and enjoyed the friendship of Samuel Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith, and other literary celebrities of his day. According to Boswell, he once greatly mortified Goldsmith by stopping him in the middle of a vivacious harangue with the exclamation, &#x27;Stay, stay! Toctor Shonson&#x27;s going to say something&#x27;.

He died at Somerset House on 24 January 1783, and was buried in the churchyard of St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden, his funeral being attended by almost all his fellow-academicians and pupils. On the day after Moser&#x27;s death a notice of him from the pen of Sir Joshua Reynolds was published, in which he was described as the first goldchaser in the kingdom, possessed of a universal knowledge of all branches of painting and sculpture, and &#x27;in every sense the father of the present race of artists.&#x27;

==Family==
He left an only daughter, Mary Moser.

<text>Walter Staunton Mack (October 19, 1895 – March 18, 1990) was a US drink businessman and financier. He was president of Pepsi-Cola from 1938 until 1951 after taking over from Charles Guth. Walter S Mack Jr, his son, married Consuelo Mack.

==Biography==
Mack was born on October 19, 1895, in Manhattan, New York City.

He graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School and from Harvard College in 1917. In World War I he joined the United States Navy, and he earned an ensign&#x27;s commission while he served in the North Atlantic.

He was elected Pepsi&#x27;s president in 1938, and served as both president and board chairman from 1951 to 1956. When he became president, the cola company had just been spun off from Loft, Inc., a New York candy company that sold its soft drink, in syrup form, to candy store soda fountains. The formula was concocted in 1893 by a North Carolina pharmacist.

Pepsi was only one of scores of cola drinks when he became president, and like all the others, was making little headway against the giant Coca-Cola bottling concern. But Pepsi made $3 million in 1938, increased profits an impressive 76 percent, and saw its stock increase in value from $70 to $190 a share.

Mack decided that real success would only come at the expense of Coke. In the late 1930s, in a notable court case, Pepsi won from Coke the right to add &quot;cola&quot; to its name. By the 1940s, Pepsi too was an international giant and second only to Coca-Cola in sales.

Another noted move he made was to dispense with long, wordy advertisements on radio and broadcast memorable commercial jingles. One famous spot, &quot;Pepsi-Cola Hits the Spot&quot;, launched in 1939, went:

Under Mack&#x27;s direction, Pepsi also became known for its aggressive promotion campaigns. Before he stepped down, the company was financing nearly 120 new scholarships each year. It began a national program of scholarships for black students in 1945. The company also financed art exhibits, and built gathering places for city youths and for servicemen.

He resigned after a fight with the board of directors over his promotion campaigns and the stream of innovations he was bringing to the company. These included selling soft drinks in cans in the early 1950s, the first large firm to do so.

After leaving Pepsi, he directed a variety of companies. In 1978, he came out of retirement to set up King-Cola Corp., which went bankrupt in 1981.

Mack, who was born in New York City, graduated from Harvard University in 1917. He then served as a Navy officer aboard destroyers and transports in the Atlantic during World War I.

His 1982 autobiography, &quot;No Time Lost,&quot; published by Atheneum, included other details of his wartime duty. He remembered Newport, R.I., as &quot;a continuous round . . . of cocktail parties, banquets, holiday balls and especially coming-out parties for the debutantes.&quot;

After the war, he became a salesman with the Bedford Mills textile firm, and rose to its presidency in 1926. Five years later, he resigned to enter the investment banking business. During the Great Depression, he gained a reputation as a businessman and financer who could turn around troubled companies. He and his companies would pump money into failing firms where they saw promise, after gaining stock options and a say in management. It was while working with the Loft&#x27;s candy chain that Mack discovered its Pepsi syrup and saw its potential.

Over the years, he also was active in New York civic affairs and in the Republican Party. He ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate from Manhattan in 1932 and worked on New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia&#x27;s mayoral campaigns. He also served as chairman of the New York County Republican Committee and was active in most Republican presidential races from the early 1940s to the early 1960s.

In his later years, Mack was a vocal advocate for older workers. &quot;Work keeps me alive, as it does a great many people,&quot; he testified before the House Select Committee on Aging in 1981. He remained active in business ventures until about two years ago.

He died on March 18, 1990, of heart disease at his home in Manhattan, New York City.

<text>George Henry Hainsworth (June 26, 1893 – October 9, 1950) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs in the National Hockey League, and the Saskatoon Crescents in the Western Canada Hockey League. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

==Personal==
Hainsworth was born in the Kew Beach area of Toronto in 1893. His parents, John Hainsworth and Mary James, were both from England. Hainsworth&#x27;s family moved to Berlin, Ontario, where his father was a water commissioner for many years. Previously, his father had worked as a plumber in Toronto. He also owned a plumbing retail business, Hainsworth Plumbing, in Berlin.

After his playing days were over, Hainsworth returned to Berlin (now named Kitchener) with his wife Alma and son Bill. Bill played goaltender, like his father, and played in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) as a junior and later as a senior player but never a professional.

==Playing career==

Hainsworth played junior hockey for the Berlin Union Jacks then moved up to senior hockey with the Berlin City Seniors and the Kitchener Greenshirts. Hainsworth won the Allan Cup, as senior amateur champions of Canada, with the Kitchener Greenshirts in 1918. One of the games he played for Kitchener against the Toronto Argonaut Rowing Club in the 1923 OHA playoffs was the first game that Foster Hewitt broadcast. By the end of the 1922–23 season, Hainsworth had played five seasons for the Greenshirts. At that time, Newsy Lalonde, manager of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) Saskatoon Crescents, needed a goalie. On the recommendation of Montreal Canadiens&#x27; part-owner Leo Dandurand, Lalonde signed Hainsworth to a pro contract of $2,500 per season with Saskatoon. Hainsworth played three seasons with Saskatoon before he was signed by Dandurand to play goal for Montreal in 1926. The Western league was in the process of folding, and Dandurand signed Hainsworth to a $6,500 per year contract before Toronto claimed him from the Western league players who were en masse moving to the National Hockey League (NHL). Dandurand had to pay $5,000 to Saskatoon for the rights to Hainsworth.

There was a need for a top goaltender in Montreal. Georges Vezina, the Canadiens goaltender, had recently died of tuberculosis. Vezina had played every game in team history from the 1910–11 NHA season until the opening game of the 1925–26 NHL season, when the illness proved too much for him. In his memory, the team decided to create the Vezina Trophy for the team goaltender(s) who allowed the least goals in the NHL.

Hainsworth proved up to the challenge by winning the Vezina Trophy for the 1926–27, 1927–28 and 1928–29 NHL seasons. In 1928–29, he set an all-time record with 22 shutouts and a 0.92 goals against average while playing all 44 games. In 1930 he set an NHL record that still stands, going 270 minutes and 8 seconds without allowing a goal during the playoffs for the Canadiens. He backstopped the Canadiens to back to back Stanley Cups in 1930 and 1931. Hainsworth served as the Canadiens&#x27; captain during 1932–33, becoming the second of only eight goalies to serve as an NHL team&#x27;s captain.

Hainsworth was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1933 for Lorne Chabot in a move by Dandurand to land another French-Canadian on his roster and boost attendance. He helped the Maple Leafs reach the 1935 Stanley Cup Finals. In 1936, Turk Broda won the goaltender job for Toronto, and Leaf manager Conn Smythe gave Hainsworth his outright release on November 25, 1936. Hainsworth retired, but was persuaded to join the Canadiens again after goaltender Wilf Cude was injured. He played four more games for the Montreal Canadiens, from December 12 to 20, 1936, before retiring for good.

==Post career==
In 1936, Hainsworth became a radio inspector with Dominion Electrohome Ltd. During World War II, he was a member of Kitchener&#x27;s civil defence guard. In 1949, he was elected to Kitchener&#x27;s city council.

Hainsworth died in a head-on collision between his car and a light panel truck near Gravenhurst, Ontario, on Monday, October 9, 1950. Hainsworth was pronounced dead at the scene from several broken ribs which punctured his heart. Hainsworth was returning home from Val D&#x27;Or, Quebec, where he and his wife had visited their son Bill. He was 57. His funeral was held October 13 at St. Mark&#x27;s Lutheran Church in Kitchener and the burial was at Woodland Cemetery.

<text>Lai Châu () is a city in the Northwest region of Vietnam. It is the capital city of Lai Châu Province. The city borders Phong Thổ District, Sìn Hồ District và Tam Đường District.

==History==

Lai Châu, or Muang Lay (Vietnamese: Mường Lay) was the seat of lords of the White Tai who were dominant over other Thai peoples of the area, though there was rivalry between the White Tai rulers of Muang Lay and Muang So. During the 1870s Muang Lay was the base of lord Đèo Văn Trị of the White Tai who sought to unite and become chief of the 12 mường (Sino-Vietnamese: / ) making up the Sip Song Chau Tai. This he partially achieved, with the help first of the Chinese Black Flags, then later the French. His authority, and the autonomy of the area, was recognised by the French in 1890.

==Demographics==
As of 2020 the city had a population of 42,973, covering an area of 92.37 km².

==Administrative divisions==
Lai Châu City is officially divided into 7 commune-level sub-divisions, including 5 wards (Đoàn Kết, Đông Phong, Quyết Thắng, Quyết Tiến, Tân Phong) and 2 rural communes (San Thàng, Sùng Phài).

==Climate==
Lai Châu has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;), typical for northwestern Vietnam, with hot, oppressively humid, and wet summers and warm to very warm, dry winters.

<doc id="634495" wikidata="Q11681085" url="?curid=634495" title="Face detection">
<text>Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images. Face detection also refers to the psychological process by which humans locate and attend to faces in a visual scene.

== Definition and related algorithms ==

Face detection can be regarded as a specific case of object-class detection. In object-class detection, the task is to find the locations and sizes of all objects in an image that belong to a given class. Examples include upper torsos, pedestrians, and cars.
Face detection simply answers two question, 1. are there any human faces in the collected images or video? 2. where is the face located? 

Face-detection algorithms focus on the detection of frontal human faces. It is analogous to image detection in which the image of a person is matched bit by bit. Image matches with the image stores in database. Any facial feature changes in the database will invalidate the matching process.

A reliable face-detection approach based on the genetic algorithm and the eigen-face technique:

Firstly, the possible human eye regions are detected by testing all the valley regions in the gray-level image. Then the genetic algorithm is used to generate all the possible face regions which include the eyebrows, the iris, the nostril and the mouth corners.

Each possible face candidate is normalized to reduce both the lighting effect, which is caused by uneven illumination; and the shirring effect, which is due to head movement. The fitness value of each candidate is measured based on its projection on the eigen-faces. After a number of iterations, all the face candidates with a high fitness value are selected for further verification. At this stage, the face symmetry is measured and the existence of the different facial features is verified for each face candidate.

== Applications ==
=== Facial motion capture ===
=== Facial recognition ===
Face detection is used in biometrics, often as a part of (or together with) a facial recognition system. It is also used in video surveillance, human computer interface and image database management.

=== Photography ===
Some recent digital cameras use face detection for autofocus. Face detection is also useful for selecting regions of interest in photo slideshows that use a pan-and-scale Ken Burns effect.

Modern appliances also use smile detection to take a photograph at an appropriate time.

=== Marketing ===
Face detection is gaining the interest of marketers. A webcam can be integrated into a television and detect any face that walks by. The system then calculates the race, gender, and age range of the face. Once the information is collected, a series of advertisements can be played that is specific toward the detected race/gender/age.

An example of such a system is &quot;OptimEyes&quot; and is integrated into the Amscreen digital signage system.
=== Emotional Inference ===
Face detection can be used as part of a software implementation of emotional inference. Emotional inference can be used to help people with autism understand the feelings of people around them.

AI-assisted emotion detection in faces has gained significant traction in recent years, employing various models to interpret human emotional states. OpenAI&#x27;s CLIP model exemplifies the use of deep learning to associate images and text, facilitating nuanced understanding of emotional content. For instance, combined with a network psychometrics approach, the model has been used to analyze political speeches based on changes in politicians&#x27; facial expressions. Research generally highlights the effectiveness of these technologies, noting that AI can analyze facial expressions (with or without vocal intonations and written language) to infer emotions, although challenges remain in accurately distinguishing between closely related emotions and understanding cultural nuances. 

=== Lip Reading ===
Face detection is essential for the process of language inference from visual cues. Automated lip reading has applications to help computers determine who is speaking which is needed when security is important.

<text>Mount Scopus ( &#x27;, &quot;Mount of the Watchmen/ Sentinels&quot;;&#x27;, lit. &quot;Mount Lookout&quot;, or &quot;&quot; &quot;Mount of the Scene/Burial Site&quot;, or &quot;Mount Syenite&quot;) is a mountain (elevation: above sea level) in northeast Jerusalem.

Between the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and the Six-Day War in 1967, the peak of Mount Scopus with the Hebrew University campus and Hadassah Hospital was a UN-protected exclave of Israel within Jordan. Today, Mount Scopus lies within the municipal boundaries of the city of Jerusalem.

==Name and identification==
The ridge of mountains east of ancient as well as modern Jerusalem offers the best views of the city, which it dominates. Since the main part of the ridge bears the name Mount of Olives, the name &quot;lookout&quot; was reserved for this peak to the northeast of the ancient city. Its name in many languages (Hebrew, Arabic, Greek and Latin) means &quot;lookout.&quot; Scopus is a Latinisation of the Greek word for &quot;watcher&quot;, &quot;skopos&quot;. . Adding to the multi-layered meaning of the name, it is also said that in times in which the city&#x27;s Roman or Byzantine authorities prohibited Jews from entering Jerusalem, they used to come and look at their former capital from this vantage point.

The Hebrew name, Har HaTzofim, &quot;Lookout Mountain&quot;, is not mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. It first appears in the form of the Greek &quot;ὁ Σκοπός&quot; (skopós) in the works of Josephus (&quot;The Jewish War&quot; 2.528; 5.67, 106, first century CE) in connection to Alexander the Great and the 70 CE Roman siege. He also writes that its ancient name was &quot;Sapha&quot; (Σάφα), which has led to a theory that the hills of Safa and Marwa near Mecca, which Muslim pilgrims walk or run between, were originally Scopus/Sapha and Mount Moriah, and the pilgrimage originally took place at Jerusalem.

The Mishnah (third century CE) mentions &quot;Tzofim&quot; in relation to Jerusalem, but it is not at all certain that it means a particular location or rather any point from which the Temple can be seen.

The ancient name Har Hatzofim or Mount Scopus has been affixed to this particular mountain and its peak in the 20th century without the certainty that it corresponds precisely to what Josephus had referred to as Mount Scopus.

==History==

===Antiquity===
Overlooking Jerusalem, Mount Scopus has been strategically important as a base from which to attack the city since antiquity. During the Great Jewish Revolt, the 12th Roman Legion commanded by Cestius, camped there in 66 CE. In 70, at the conclusion of the same war that led to the destruction of the Jewish Temple, Mount Scopus was used as a base to carry out the final siege of the city by the same 12th Legion, plus the 15th and 5th Legions, while the 10th Legion was positioned on the continuation of the same ridge, known as the Mount of Olives. The Crusaders used it as a base in 1099.

===Modern era===


The exact location of the mountain known in the ancient sources as Mount Scopus is not known. It is described as being in the north-eastern part of the ridge that prominently includes the Mount of Olives, which dominates Jerusalem from the east. As the Zionist organisations decided to build a new Jewish institution of higher learning in Jerusalem, which eventually became the Hebrew University, they decided that it was unwise to try and ask for donations for a project designed to be built on the Mount of Olives, a location with many Christian connotations.

The site chosen for the university did correspond approximately to the description of the ancient Mount Scopus and so it was decided to name that particular peak &quot;Mount Scopus&quot;.

In 1948, as the British began letting go of their security responsibilities, the Jewish enclave on Mount Scopus became increasingly cut off from the main sections of Jewish Jerusalem. Access to the hospital and university campus was through a narrow road, long, passing through the Palestinian neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah. Arab sniper fire on vehicles moving along the access route became a regular occurrence, and road mines were laid. When food and supplies at the hospital began to dwindle, a large convoy carrying doctors and supplies set out for the besieged hospital, leading to an attack that became known as the Hadassah medical convoy massacre. Seventy-eight Jewish doctors, nurses, students, patients, faculty members, and Haganah, and one British soldier were killed in the attack.

After the ceasefire agreement of November 30, 1948, which established the division of East and West Jerusalem, Israel controlled the western part of the city while Jordan controlled the east. Several demilitarized &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; zones were established along the border, one of them Mount Scopus. Fortnightly convoys carrying supplies to the university and hospital located in the Israeli part of the demilitarized zone on Mount Scopus were periodically held up by Jordanian troops.

Article VIII of the 1949 Armistice Agreements signed by Israel and Jordan in April 1949 called for:

In January 1958, Francis Urrutia, a representative of the UN Secretary-General, tried to persuade Jordan to abide by Article VIII, but without success. In May 1958, Jordanian soldiers fired on Israeli patrols, killing a UN officer and four Israeli policemen.

Mount Scopus was not a traditional exclave. There were two versions of the demilitarization agreement: one was initialed by Franklyn M. Begley, a UN official; the local Jordanian commander; and the Israeli local commander; while the other was not initialed by the Israeli local commander. Having two versions of the map was the cause of many incidents within the Mount Scopus area.
Ralph Bunche, assistant to UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld visited Jerusalem and Amman to find a solution, followed by Hammarskjöld himself, again unsuccessfully. The Mount Scopus Agreement signed on July 7, 1948, regulated the demilitarised zone around Mount Scopus and authorized the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization to settle disputes between the Israelis and Jordanians.

Two Jewish-owned plots in Issawiya known as Salomons Garden were purchased by Mrs. V.F. Salomons in 1934 and sold to the Gan Shlomit Company, Ltd. in 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN Doc S/4030&quot;&gt;Unispal.un.org Report of the Firing Incident of May 26, 1958 on Mount Scopus UN Doc S/4030 17 June 1958, paragraph 80&lt;/ref&gt; It was surrounded by a fence, but clashes erupted when Arabs living on the other side of the fence sought to cultivate land, pick olives, and carry out repairs on homes close to the fence. The Arabs were requested not to work closer than fifty metres from the fence unless prior permission was granted by the Israeli police.

==Landmarks==

===Hebrew University of Jerusalem===

Construction of the Mount Scopus campus of the Hebrew University began in 1918 on land purchased from the Gray Hill estate. The dedication ceremony was held in 1925 in the presence of many dignitaries. A design for the university campus by Sir Patrick Geddes positioned the university buildings on the slopes of the mount, below a domed, hexagonal Great Hall recalling the Star of David, as a counterpoint to the octagonal Dome of the Rock in the Old City. This plan was never implemented, but Geddes designed the university Library, today the Hebrew University Faculty of Law on Mount Scopus.

By 1947, the university was a solid research and teaching institution with humanities, science, medicine, education and agriculture departments (in Rehovot), a national library, a university press and an adult education center. The university had a student population of over 1,000 and 200 faculty members.

====Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design====

Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design is Israel&#x27;s national school of art, founded in 1906 by Boris Schatz. It is named for the Biblical figure Bezalel (), who was appointed by Moses to oversee the design and construction of the Tabernacle in Exodus 35:30-35.

The university&#x27;s main campus was located on Mount Scopus from 1990 to 2023.

====Cave of Nicanor====
The Cave of Nicanor is an ancient burial cave located on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem, Israel. Excavations in the cave discovered an ossuary referring to &quot;Nicanor the door maker.&quot; He has been identified as Nicanor of Alexandria, who donated one of the gates of Herod&#x27;s Temple. The cave is located in the National Botanic Garden of Israel.

There was a plan to use the Cave of Nicanor as a national of Zionism, but due to circumstances (the area of Mount Scopus after receipt of Israel&#x27;s independence was an enclave, surrounded by the West Bank territorial possessions of Jordan), this project was not implemented. Only two of Zionist leaders – Leon Pinsker and Menachem Ussishkin – were interred inside the ancient tomb. After 1948, the national cemetery was created on Mount Herzl, closer to the centre of West Jerusalem.

====Hadassah Hospital (Mount Scopus)====

In 1939, the Hadassah Women&#x27;s Organization opened a teaching hospital on Mount Scopus in a building designed by architect Erich Mendelsohn. In 1948, when the Jordanians occupied East Jerusalem and blockaded the road to Mount Scopus, the hospital could no longer function. In 1960, after running clinics in various locations, the organization opened a medical center on the other side of the city, in Jerusalem&#x27;s Ein Karem neighborhood.
On April 13, 1948, a civilian convoy bringing medical supplies and personnel to Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus was attacked by Arab forces. 78 Jews, mainly doctors and nurses, were killed in the ambush.

====Hecht Synagogue, Hebrew University====

The Hecht Synagogue, a large noticeable building on the south-west corner of the campus, was erected by the family of Mayer Jacob &quot;Chic&quot; Hecht (1928–2006), a Republican United States Senator from Nevada and U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas. It is noted for the unique arrangement of the Torah ark and the panoramic view of the Old City from a huge window.

====National Botanical Garden of Israel====

The National Botanic Garden of Israel, also called the Land of Israel Botanic Garden, was founded on the grounds of the Hebrew University on Mount Scopus by botanist Alexander Eig in 1931. This garden contains one of the largest collections of Israeli uncultivated plants. This was the first home of the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo. A cave in the garden has been identified as the Tomb of Nicanor (see above).

===Jerusalem British War Cemetery===
The Jerusalem British war cemetery is a military cemetery for fallen soldiers of the British Empire, later known as the Commonwealth of Nations, in World War I in Mandatory Palestine. The cemetery is located on the neck of land on the north end of the Mount of Olives and west of Mount Scopus.

2,515 fallen soldiers were buried in the cemetery, of whom 2,449 were war dead, including 2,218 British casualties. A total of 100 fallen soldiers are unidentified.

A memorial was placed in the cemetery to 3,300 service personnel killed in operations in Palestine and Egypt who have no known grave. In all, commemorated in this cemetery are 5815 service personnel of World War I. No casualties buried in the cemetery died after the war.

===Kiryat Menachem Begin===

Kiryat Menachem Begin, named after former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and also known as Kiryat HaMemshala, is a complex of government buildings in East Jerusalem located between Sheikh Jarrah in the north, adjacent to Mount Scopus in the east and Ammunition Hill in the west. It serves as home to several government offices, along with the main government complex in Givat Ram. It also includes the National Headquarters of the Israel Police.

===Tabachnik Garden===

Tabachnik Garden is a National Park located on the southern slopes of Mount Scopus, next to the Hebrew University. The park preserves some Jewish burial caves from the Second Temple period and it also contains two smaller cemeteries, the Bentwich Cemetery and one of the cemeteries of the American Colony. Inside the park there are two lookouts, one facing eastward towards the Dead Sea and the Judean Desert, the other westward towards the Temple Mount.

====Jerusalem American Colony Cemetery====

The American Colony Cemetery on Mount Scopus is the main cemetery of Jerusalem&#x27;s American Colony, located next to the Hebrew University in the Tabachnik Garden. Among those buried there are Anna Spafford and Jacob Spafford (1864–1932), born in Ramallah as Jacob Eliahu into a Turkish Jewish family, adoptive son of Horatio and Anna Spafford and discoverer of the Siloam inscription.

====Bentwich Cemetery====
A small cemetery, dedicated to Herbert Bentwich and his family, is located beside the American Colony Cemetery in Tabachnik Garden.

===Ammunition Hill===
Ammunition Hill was a fortified Jordanian military post in the north-west side of Mount Scopus in Jerusalem that was in the northern part of Jordanian East Jerusalem. It was the site of one of the fiercest battles of the Six-Day War.

<text>The Jianwen Emperor (5 December 1377 – probably 13 July 1402), personal name Zhu Yunwen, also known by his temple name as the Emperor Huizong of Ming and by his posthumous name as the Emperor Hui of Ming, was the second emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigning from 1398 to 1402. Zhu Yunwen&#x27;s father was Zhu Biao, the eldest son and crown prince of the Hongwu Emperor, the founder of the Ming dynasty. Zhu Biao died in 1392, after which the Hongwu Emperor named Zhu Yunwen as his successor. He ascended the throne after the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s death in June 1398.

As emperor, he surrounded himself with Confucian-educated officials who immediately began revising the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s reforms, and the most significant change was the attempt to limit or eliminate the power of princes (the sons of the Hongwu Emperor). The most powerful among them, Zhu Di, Prince of Yan, who was based in Beijing and responsible for guarding the border with the Mongols. In 1399, Zhu Di rebelled under the pretext of protecting the emperor from corrupt court officials after the emperor ordered the imprisonment of his followers. This sparked a civil war known as the Jingnan campaign, which aimed to eliminate disorder. In 1402, Zhu Di captured the capital of Nanjing, and the imperial palace was burned to the ground. The emperor, along with his wife and eldest son, perished in the fire, but their bodies were never found, leading to rumors of the emperor&#x27;s survival and refuge in a Buddhist monastery. Zhu Di ascended the throne as the Yongle Emperor. He abolished the Jianwen Emperor&#x27;s reforms and declared him illegitimate, thus abolishing the Jianwen era and extending the era of Hongwu to 1402. It was not until 1595 that the Jianwen Emperor&#x27;s era and imperial title were restored by the Wanli Emperor.

==Early life==
Zhu Yunwen, the future Jianwen Emperor, was born on 5 December 1377, the second son of Zhu Biao and his wife Lady Lü. Zhu Biao was the eldest son of the Hongwu Emperor, the founder and first emperor of the Ming dynasty of China. Upon assuming the imperial title in 1368, the Hongwu Emperor named his eldest son as his heir to the throne. In 1382, after the death of his elder brother, Zhu Yunwen became the eldest son of Zhu Biao. He was a mature and direct child, and was well-liked by the emperor.

In May 1392, Zhu Biao died at the age of thirty-seven after several months of illness. As the eldest surviving son, Zhu Yunwen was named the new crown prince on 28 September 1392. He spent the next six years carefully preparing for his future role as emperor. Like his father, Zhu Yunwen was not physically fit and preferred scholarly pursuits. As crown prince, he criticized certain laws and statements for being excessively harsh and advocated for their abolition. He was known for his polite demeanor and adherence to Confucian values, such as (benevolence) and (filial piety). The Hongwu Emperor had doubts about his grandson&#x27;s ability to rule, as he believed him to lack toughness. This may have been the reason for the purges of potentially dangerous generals in the first half of the 1390s.

==Accession==
The Hongwu Emperor died on 24 June 1398. Just six days later, on 30 June 1398, Zhu Yunwen took the throne. Known for his gentle nature and adherence to Confucian principles, he was deeply concerned about the harshness of his grandfather&#x27;s policies. As a result, he aimed to bring about significant changes in the political landscape. The era name of his reign, Jianwen, means &quot;establishing civility&quot; and represents a sharp change in tone from Hongwu (&quot;vastly martial&quot;), the era name of his grandfather&#x27;s reign. Instead of relying on accomplished generals or members of the imperial family, he turned to Confucian scholars for guidance. His closest advisors were Huang Zicheng, Qi Tai, and Fang Xiaoru, all of whom were idealistic reformers, but they lacked practical experience in governing the country.

==Reforms==
During the reign of the Jianwen Emperor, the civilian part of the administration gained more influence, while that of the military commanders and the emperor&#x27;s uncles declined. After the abolition of the Central Secretariat in 1380, there had been no central office in the Ming administration to coordinate the work of ministries and other civil offices. As a result, all of these offices were directly under the emperor&#x27;s control. The Jianwen Emperor relied on Huang Zicheng, Qi Tai, and Fang Xiaoru to lead the government, discussing policies with them and overseeing their implementation by the ministries. Although they effectively acted as chancellors (; &quot;chengxiang&quot;), they did not hold the official title. This reform proved beneficial for the administration of the empire, but it went against the edict of the Hongwu Emperor, which strictly prohibited the restoration of the chancellery in any form due to concerns about the potential threat from the authority and autonomy of the chancellor.

The ministers were elevated from the second rank to the first in the hierarchy of rank classes, placing them on equal footing with the highest-ranking generals (the military commissioners). The number of departments and officials in the ministries was changed, and the status and number of positions in the Hanlin Academy and the Imperial University were increased. He also strengthened the influence of Hanlin scholars in educating princes by creating new positions in the Household Administration of the Heir Apparent. A series of changes were made to the powers and titles of offices, following the patterns of the ancient Zhou dynasty ( – 256 BC).

The Jianwen Emperor abolished the unfair tax system of the previous era, particularly the excessive taxes imposed on Jiangnan, specifically Suzhou and Songjiang prefectures. In 1400, taxes in Jiangnan were reduced to a more reasonable level. The following year, the tax exemptions for Taoist and Buddhist clergy were limited, and they were required to hand over land exceeding a certain amount to be distributed to the needy. The government did not have enough time to fully implement these changes before its fall.

==Reduction of the princes&#x27; power==
The Jianwen government aimed to reduce the influence of the emperor&#x27;s uncles, the sons of the Hongwu Emperor, especiall Zhu Di, Prince of Yan, Zhu Su, Prince of Zhou, Zhu Gui, Prince of Dai, Zhu Bo, Prince of Xiang, Zhu Fu, Prince of Qi, and Zhu Pian, Prince of Min. They had been granted the title of prince (; &quot;wang&quot;) and were given significant income and privileges by their father. They were stationed in various provinces and had their own personal guards, which could range from 3,000 to 15,000 men. Some of them even led the Ming armies in the 1390s, particularly on the northern border. The most powerful and eldest among them was Zhu Di, the fourth son of the Hongwu Emperor. The princes saw the Jianwen Emperor&#x27;s efforts as a personal threat and a violation of the laws of the Hongwu Emperor, which everyone, including the emperor, was obliged to obey.

The policy of &quot;reducing the feudatories&quot; (; &quot;xuefan&quot;) was supported by Qi Tai and, most notably, by Huang Zicheng, who cited past dynastic experiences, such as the Rebellion of the Seven States during the Han dynasty. Princedoms were either directly suppressed or had their powers limited for both real and perceived offenses. The government forbade the princes from participating in public life, in direct contradiction to the laws of the late Hongwu Emperor, which stated that they were to be the backbone of the throne at the head of the government&#x27;s armies.

The first victim of the new order was Zhu Su, based in Kaifeng, a city in central China, and a close friend of Zhu Di. In the fall of 1398, the Jianwen Emperor stripped him of his title and exiled him to the southeastern Chinese province of Yunnan. In February 1399, Zhu Gui was placed under house arrest in Datong. Zhu Bo set fire to his palace in Jingzhou on 1 June 1399, taking his own life and that of his family. In the following two months, in June and July, Zhu Fu (who was based in Jingzhou), and Zhu Pian (based in Yunnan) were also stripped of their titles. The main long-term target of the government&#x27;s measures was Zhu Di. He was based in Beijing and had shown himself to be a capable military leader and energetic administrator during campaigns against the Mongols. However, since 1392, when he was not named as a successor, he has considered himself unjustly neglected.

==Civil war==
===Conflict with Zhu Di===
The government was cautious towards Zhu Di, which gave him the opportunity to prepare and gather forces, although his power was systematically limited. For example, his personal guard of 15,000 men was transferred outside of Beijing, and the generals serving in the northeast, close to Zhu Di, were gradually replaced by commanders loyal to the Jianwen Emperor.

In June 1399, the emperor finally granted Zhu Di&#x27;s request to return his sons, who had been effectively held as hostages in Nanjing since the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s funeral, to Beijing. This event seemed to remove Zhu Di&#x27;s inhibitions. The immediate pretext for his rebellion was the arrest of two of his lower officials for &quot;subversive activity&quot;. With the support of Beijing&#x27;s provincial dignitaries, Zhu Di responded by occupying the counties and prefectures around Beijing, calling the war a campaign to clear away disorders.

Zhu Di justified his actions by claiming that he wanted to end internal disorder and confusion, defend the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s statutes and laws defining the duties of princes, and honor his deceased father. He accused the emperor and his ministers of persecuting the princes, who were falsely accused of preparing an uprising. He presented his actions as a reasonable act of self-defense. He also stated that he had no interest in the throne, but as the eldest surviving son of the deceased founder of the dynasty, he felt obligated to restore the law and legality that had been subverted by the emperor&#x27;s criminal advisers and ministers.

===Course of the war===

At the beginning of the war, Zhu Di had a force of 100,000 men and controlled the immediate vicinity of Beijing. In contrast, the Ming government had three times the number of soldiers and significantly more resources, but the government&#x27;s superiority was not as clear-cut as it seemed. Zhu Di was a decisive and exceptionally capable commander, leading elite units that included a large number of Mongol cavalry. On the other hand, the imperial party was weakened by the indecision and poor coordination of its commanders, as well as the conflicting views between those who supported aggressive tactics and those who favored a more conciliatory approach. Additionally, the emperor and his closest ministers lacked military experience.

In August 1399, the emperor appointed Geng Bingwen as the commander of the troops tasked with suppressing the rebellion. Geng Bingwen led 130,000 troops to Zhending, a city southwest of Beijing, but was ultimately defeated by Zhu Di in late September, resulting in heavy losses for the imperial army. The new commander of the imperial army, Li Jinglong, took advantage of Zhu Di&#x27;s absence from Beijing and laid siege to the city in November 1399. Zhu Di quickly returned and forced the imperial army to retreat.

In 1400, there were numerous rebel attacks and government army counterattacks. The Imperial forces were unable to utilize their numerical advantage or mobilize additional troops, allowing Zhu Di to strengthen his position in the north. The emperor, who was dissatisfied with Li Jinglong, dismissed him and appointed Sheng Yong as the new commander of the anti-rebellion forces. Zhu Di, following the advice of his supporters in Nanjing, opted for a war of attrition. He disrupted the enemy&#x27;s communications in southern Beijing and western Shandong through small raids from the autumn of 1400.

The government army used firearms and rocket weapons to kill tens of thousands of rebels at Dongchang in Shandong in January 1401. During the retreat to Beijing, Zhu Di narrowly escaped capture. In late February, the rebels launched an attack, and they crushed the government armies in April and May. In response, the emperor promoted Ru Chang and Li Jinglong, who were leaders of the &quot;peace party&quot; at court, but Zhu Di rejected their offer for negotiations. The insurgents continued to raid the enemy&#x27;s supply lines throughout the summer, while the front in Shandong and southern Beijing was moving back and forth.

Zhu Di launched an offensive in January 1402. On the advice of the Nanjing eunuchs, he chose to advance westward instead of through the fortified cities along the Grand Canal, where the government forces were stronger. This strategic decision proved successful as the government forces in the west were weaker, allowing the rebels to disrupt their lines. The government&#x27;s attempt to stop the rebel advance by sending reinforcements led by General Xu Huizu to the north failed. The rebels continued their southward march, and captured Xuzhou, a city in the north of the strategically important Zhili by the beginning of March. As a result, the government was forced to withdraw its troops from Beijing and Shandong provinces to defend Zhili.

From April to June 1402, the rebel army engaged in fierce battles and successfully advanced from Xuzhou to the banks of the Yangtze River. Chen Xuan, the commander of the government fleet, defected to the rebels, giving them an open road to Nanjing. The emperor, who was gathering forces to defend the capital, was unable to stop the rebels. Taking advantage of the chaos, members of the &quot;peace party&quot; opened the gates of Nanjing to the rebels on 13 July 1402. In the ensuing clashes, the imperial palace was burned down. Three bodies found at the cremation site were later identified as those of the emperor, his wife, and their eldest son. Beginning in the Jiajing era (1522–1567), non-state historians who were sympathetic to the Jianwen Emperor propagated a folk legend in their writings that the Jianwen Emperor survived the palace fire and lived in anonymity as a Buddhist monk.

Zhu Di ascended the imperial throne on 17 July presentin himself as the direct successor of the Hongwu Emperor. He denied legitimacy to his overthrown nephew, canceled his reforms, and attempted to erase them from history. The Jianwen Emperor&#x27;s younger son, Zhu Wengui, and other relatives spent the rest of their lives in prison. The Jianwen Emperor&#x27;s followers were punished, and his closest advisers were executed. Although Zhu Di hoped that Fang Xiaoru, known for his integrity and honesty, would join his side and bring confidence to the new government, he was resolutely rejected. As punishment, the emperor not only executed Fang Xiaoru&#x27;s relatives but also his pupils. The purges, executions, imprisonments, and exiles affected tens of thousands of people.

==Legacy==
In an attempt to erase the memory of the Jianwen Emperor, the era of Jianwen was retroactively cancelled and the era of Hongwu was extended from 1399 to 1402. Many official documents from his government were destroyed, and private notes were also eliminated. Historians&#x27; views of the Jianwen Emperor were closely tied to their opinions of the legitimacy of the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s rule. The Jianwen Emperor&#x27;s reforms were criticized for deviating from the principles of the dynasty&#x27;s founder and were subsequently repealed. Furthermore, the Yongle Emperor fully restored the harsh laws of the Hongwu Emperor that had been abolished by the emperor.

The official history of the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s reign, known as &quot;Taizu Shilu&quot; (&quot;Veritable Records of Emperor Taizu&quot;), was compiled from 1399 to 1402, but was rewritten by 1403 and again between 1411 and 1418. The Yongle Emperor&#x27;s historians portrayed the Jianwen Emperor as a weak and immoral ruler who showed little interest in governing and was surrounded by corrupt and treacherous ministers. However, later versions of the history paint the Jianwen Emperor as an honest and benevolent leader who followed the advice of devoted Confucians and worked to correct the cruelties of his predecessor. The Wanli Emperor restored his reign to the official history of the dynasty in October 1595, but he was not given a posthumous temple name until July 1644 by Zhu Yousong (the Hongguang Emperor), the first ruler of the Southern Ming dynasty. Zhu Yousong bestowed upon him the temple name Huizong (; &#x27;Magnanimous Ancestor&#x27;) and the posthumous name Emperor Rang (; &#x27;Abdicated Emperor&#x27;). However, Zhu Yousong was not recognized by the Qing dynasty, which succeeded the Ming, as legitimate, and his decisions were not considered valid. It was not until September 1736 that the Jianwen Emperor was given the posthumous name Emperor Gongmin Hui () by the Qianlong Emperor.

<text>A nail bomb is an anti-personnel explosive device containing nails to increase its effectiveness at harming victims. The nails act as shrapnel, leading almost certainly to more injury in inhabited areas than the explosives alone would. A nail bomb is also a type of flechette weapon. Such weapons use bits of shrapnel (steel balls, nail heads, screws, needles, broken razors, darts and other small metal objects) to create a larger radius of destruction. 

Nail bombs are often used by terrorists, including suicide bombers since they cause larger numbers of casualties when detonated in crowded places. Nail bombs can be detected by electromagnetic sensors and standard metal detectors.

== Nail-bomb incidents ==
===Pre-2000s===
* On 6 March 1970, in the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, three members of the Weather Underground were killed in the accidental explosion of a nail bomb intended to be set off at a non-commissioned officers dance at the Fort Dix, New Jersey Army base.
* Several nail bombings occurred during The Troubles in Northern Ireland, both by Republicans and Loyalists.
* American Mafia figure Philip Testa was killed by a nail bomb in Philadelphia in 1981.
* Mark Hofmann, convicted of murdering two people with a nail bomb in 1985.
* In 1989, football hooligans threw nail bombs at supporters of a rival club in the Netherlands.
* A number of nail-bombings occurred in 1999 when the neo-Nazi David Copeland planted several devices in London targeted against ethnic minorities and LGBT people.

===2000s===
* On 11 October 2002 in Myyrmäki, Finland, a 19-year-old named Petri Gerdt committed a nail bombing in a local mall. Seven people died including Gerdt, and 159 were injured.
* On 9 June 2004, a nail bomb was detonated in Cologne, Germany, by the Nazi terrorist group National Socialist Underground (&quot;Nationalsozialistischer Untergrund&quot;) in a popular Turkish shopping quarter called &quot;Little Istanbul&quot;, wounding 22 people and damaging several shops and parked cars. According to the magazine &quot;Der Spiegel,&quot; the Nazi group claimed responsibility for the attack in a DVD found in the ruins of a house in Zwickau (D) that exploded on 4 November 2011.
* On 31 December 2005, an Indonesian marketplace was nail-bombed, and a second undetonated bomb was found nearby.
* On 29 June 2007, a nail bomb that was assumed to be a part of a terror plot was discovered in a car and was consequently defused by police in the West End of London. There was a second car bomb, further down the street that was apparently scheduled to detonate as evacuees and survivors fled down the street, to a nearby tube station. 
* On 21 December 2007, a nail bomb was detonated in Sherpao, Pakistan by a suicide bomber. Detonation occurred inside a tightly packed mosque, filled with holiday worshippers. At least 50 people were killed, with over 100 injured.
* In the 22 May 2008 Exeter bombing, a nail bomb explosive was detonated in the toilets of Giraffe café in the Princesshay Shopping Centre in Exeter, Devon.

<text>Thomas Pingo (1714–1776) was an English medallist and die engraver. He worked for the Royal Mint in London. Originally thought to have come from Italy in 1742, and born there in 1692, he was in fact the son of Thomas Pingo Sr (1688 – after 1743) of Plumbtree Court, London. The Pingo family first appeared in London in the 1650s in the Parish of St Martins-in-the-Fields.

His subjects included Charles Edward Stuart (Bonny Prince Charlie, King George III of Great Britain and Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, last Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück (1763–1827)). His was appointed Assistant Engraver at the Mint in 1771. The same year, Pingo engraved the dies used for the Botetourt Medals of the College of William &amp; Mary in Virginia.

==Private life==
His daughter Mary Pingo was an artist and designer; baptised in 1741, she died unmarried in 1819. Their sons Lewis Pingo (baptised 1743–1830) and John Pingo (baptised 1738–1827) also became noted medallists, Lewis succeeding his father as the Mint&#x27;s Assistant Engraver in 1776. Another son, Benjamin Pingo (1749–94), was Rouge Dragon Pursuivant (1780–1786) and York Herald (1786–1794) in the College of Arms.

<text>Fodder (), also called provender (), is any agricultural foodstuff used specifically to feed domesticated livestock, such as cattle, rabbits, sheep, horses, chickens and pigs. &quot;Fodder&quot; refers particularly to food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them), rather than that which they forage for themselves (called forage). Fodder includes hay, straw, silage, compressed and pelleted feeds, oils and mixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes (such as bean sprouts, fresh malt, or spent malt). Most animal feed is from plants, but some manufacturers add ingredients to processed feeds that are of animal origin.

The worldwide animal feed trade produced 1.245 billion tons of compound feed in 2022 according to an estimate by the International Feed Industry Federation, with an annual growth rate of about 2%. The use of agricultural land to grow feed rather than human food can be controversial (see food vs. feed); some types of feed, such as corn (maize), can also serve as human food; those that cannot, such as grassland grass, may be grown on land that can be used for crops consumed by humans. In many cases the production of grass for cattle fodder is a valuable intercrop between crops for human consumption, because it builds the organic matter in the soil. When evaluating if this soil organic matter increase mitigates climate change, both permanency of the added organic matter as well as emissions produced during use of the fodder product have to be taken into account. Some agricultural byproducts fed to animals may be considered unsavory by humans.

* Crop residues: stover, copra, straw, chaff, sugar beet waste
* Fish meal
* Freshly cut grass and other forage plants
* Grass or lawn clipping waste
* Green maize 
* Green sorghum 
* Horse gram 
* Leaves from certain species of trees
* Meat and bone meal (now illegal in cattle and sheep feeds in many areas due to risk of BSE)
* Molasses
* Native green grass 
* Oilseed press cake (cottonseed, safflower, sunflower, soybean, peanut or groundnut)
* Oligosaccharides
* Processed insects (i.e. processed maggots)
* Seaweed (including Asparagopsis taxiformis which is used mainly as a supplement to reduce methane emissions by up to 90%)
* Seeds and grains, either whole or prepared by crushing, milling, etc.
* Single cell protein(can also be made from atmospheric)
* Sprouted grains and legumes
* Yeast extract (brewer&#x27;s yeast residue)

==Health concerns==
In the past, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or &quot;mad cow disease&quot;) spread through the inclusion of ruminant meat and bone meal in cattle feed due to prion contamination. This practice is now banned in most countries where it has occurred. Some animals have a lower tolerance for spoiled or moldy fodder than others, and certain types of molds, toxins, or poisonous weeds inadvertently mixed into a feed source may cause economic losses due to sickness or death of the animals. The US Department of Health and Human Services regulates drugs of the Veterinary Feed Directive type that can be present within commercial livestock feed.

== Droughts ==
Increasing intensities and frequencies of drought events put rangeland agriculture under pressure in semi-arid and arid geographic areas. Innovative emergency fodder production concepts have been reported, such as bush-based animal fodder production in Namibia. During extended dry periods, some farmers have used woody biomass fibre from encroacher bush as their primary source of cattle feed, adding locally-available supplements for nutrients as well as to improve palatability.

==Production of sprouted grains as fodder==

Fodder in the form of sprouted cereal grains such as barley, and legumes can be grown in small and large quantities.

Systems have been developed recently that allow for many tons of sprouts to be produced each day, year round. Sprouted grains can significantly increase the nutritional value of the grain compared with feeding the ungerminated grain to stock. They use less water than traditional forage, making them ideal for drought conditions. Sprouted barley and other cereal grains can be grown hydroponically in a carefully-controlled environment. Hydroponically-grown sprouted fodder at tall with a root mat is at its peak for animal feed. 

Although products such as barley are grain, when sprouted they are approved by the American Grassfed Association to be used as livestock feed.

<doc id="634527" wikidata="Q580374" url="?curid=634527" title="Nkulunkulu Mnikati wetibusiso temaSwati">
<text>&quot;&quot; is the national anthem of Eswatini. It is a compromise between Swazi and Western styles of music and was adopted after independence in 1968. The lyrics were authored by Andrease Enoke Fanyana Kukies Simelane, and the composer of the tune was David Kenneth Rycroft.

== History ==
At the time of Swaziland&#x27;s upcoming independence from the United Kingdom on 6 September 1968, a new flag was adopted, and it was decided to set up an Anthem Committee and hold a &#x27;National Anthem Competition&#x27;. Firstly, a local competition for suitable lyrics in siSwati was held, then a competition for the best musical settings was advertised in &quot;The Musical Times&quot; in London in early 1967, offering a prize for the winner, with composers being invited to apply to Swaziland&#x27;s Ministry of Local Administration.

Applicants received the lyrics 10 months later around October 1967, which were in two forms, as the judges had not been able to agree on a single text. With the competition&#x27;s closing date by 1968, on 1 November 1967 the Ministry issued a circular updating on their progress in the search for lyrics, now narrowed down to the two proposals, and music, still open to submissions. The Ministry stated that the lyrics were to be decided after the musical settings had been judged. Composers could submit music for one or both verses.

The judges eventually narrowed down to four settings of the lyrics to music, which were then each recorded and performed by the choir of the Ionian Music Society of Johannesburg. The Cabinet was then to decide on which to adopt as the national anthem, but members of the Cabinet wished to hear live performances by a local choir. They requested the choir of Waterford School in Mbabane to sing the four settings for them on 9 July 1968. Ultimately, David K. Rycroft&#x27;s setting of verse A was chosen as the winner.

On 16 August 1968, it was reported in &quot;The Times of Swaziland&quot; that Deputy Prime Minister Mfundza Sukati had announced that a choral version of the new anthem would be played on Radio Swaziland every day until Independence Day to give people a chance to learn the anthem. Sukati stated that the words were written by Andrease Fanyana Kukies Simelane of Jerusalem School, near Hlatikulu. He also stated that a member of the British Royal Military School of Music had arranged a musical score based on David Rycroft&#x27;s setting, which was recorded by the Band of the Irish Guards.

== Lyrics ==
The anthem includes several typically Swazi features, such as intricate polyphony, the principle of &#x27;non-simultaneous entry&#x27; of voice parts; certain melodic and harmonic allusions to traditional practice; and a relatively strict adherence to Swazi prosodic conventions, the rhythmic setting of words to music.

<text>Kim Salmon and the Surrealists are an Australian indie rock band formed by Kim Salmon in 1987 when he was living in Perth between the final two tours by The Scientists. When the Scientists stopped, Salmon continued the Surrealists as his main band while playing in Beasts of Bourbon.

==Biography==
Salmon formed the first lineup of the Surrealists in mid-1987, with Brian Henry Hooper on bass and Tony Pola on drums. He formed the band to record the album &quot;Hit Me with the Surreal Feel&quot;, using minimalist lo-fi approaches to recording a basic trio: recording the band live with microphones around the studio capturing the entire sound rather than one instrument per track. The recording and mixing cost was A$240 total. The band also played live around Perth in mid-1987. The album was released in October 1988.

The Surrealists did a few songs by the Scientists (particularly &quot;Shine&quot; from &quot;The Human Jukebox&quot;) and had a similar sound in that Salmon remained the leader and primary songwriter, but the feel of the music was notably different, far less tense and confrontational.

The second album &quot;Just Because You Can&#x27;t See It ... Doesn&#x27;t Mean It Isn&#x27;t There&quot; was recorded more conventionally in 1989 and released in early 1990. Comparing this album with &quot;The Human Jukebox&quot;, there is a similarity in songwriting but a difference in feel is readily apparent. The band&#x27;s third album &quot;Essence&quot; was released in 1991, followed by &quot;Sin Factory&quot; in 1993, which arguably gained the most attention for the band. The sound by now was strong rock riffery, also blending their take on Blaxploitation music.

When The Beasts of Bourbon reformed in early 1988, Salmon started touring with that band too. When James Baker and Boris Sujdovic left The Beasts of Bourbon to go full-time with The Dubrovniks, Hooper and Pola joined to replace them.

Salmon fired Tony Pola from the Surrealists in 1993, replacing him with Greg Bainbridge. Brian Hooper later left after the &quot;Kim Salmon and the Surrealists&quot; album and was replaced by Stu Thomas in 1995. This new trio put out &quot;Ya Gotta Let Me Do My Thing&quot; in 1997, touring Australia, Europe, and the U.S. A horn section was added to the band that included trumpet player Leon de Bruin and saxophonist Michael Redman.

In 1999, Salmon renamed the band Kim Salmon and the Business, and released one album &quot;Record&quot; in 1999. Stu Thomas remained on bass and Phil Collings was recruited on drums in 2000.

In September 2006, Kim Salmon and the Surrealists &#x27;reformed&#x27; for a show in Spain at Azkena Rock Festival. This line-up of Kim Salmon (guitar/vocal), Stu Thomas (bass) and Phil Collings (drums) also played later in Australia.

2010 marked the release of the album &quot;Grand Unifying Theory&quot;, the first Kim Salmon and The Surrealists record for 13 years. Line-up featured Kim Salmon (guitar/vocal/sampler), Stu Thomas (bass) and Phil Collings (drums). The band was recorded live during rehearsals. The results were sifted through by Salmon and co-producer Mike Stranges, spliced together in some cases (ala Miles Davis&#x27; &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;), and made into songs.

In June 2020, during COVID lockdowns the band performed 2 improvised livestream gigs from Rolling Stock Studios, Melbourne. These were seen by 7500 worldwide. The livestreams were also recorded then released as the double-LP &quot;Rantings From The Book Of Swamp&quot;.

In 2022 the band completed the &quot;Ya Gotta Let Me Swamp My Rantings&quot; tour of Australia, included the current lineup, plus previous drummer Greg Bainbridge. Two sets featured the 2 different lineups, first performing the current &quot;Rantings&quot; LP, followed by 1997&#x27;s &quot;Ya Gotta Let Me Do My Thing&quot; album.

<text>Percy MacKaye (1875–1956) was an American dramatist and poet.

==Biography==
MacKaye was born in New York City into a theatrical family. His father, Steele MacKaye, was a popular actor, playwright, and producer, while his mother, Mary, wrote a dramatization of Pride and Prejudice, first produced in 1910. His brother James MacKaye was a philosopher, while brother Benton MacKaye was a forester and conservationist. His sister, Hazel MacKaye, became a women&#x27;s suffrage leader and pageant director.

After graduating from Harvard in 1897, he traveled in Europe for three years, residing in Rome, Switzerland and London, studying at the University of Leipzig in 1899–1900. He returned to New York City to teach at a private school until 1904, when he joined a colony of artists and writers in Cornish, New Hampshire, and devoted himself entirely to dramatic work.

He wrote the plays &quot;The Canterbury Pilgrims&quot; in 1903, &quot;Sappho and Phaon&quot; in 1907, &quot;Jeanne D&#x27;Arc&quot; in 1907, &quot;The Scarecrow&quot; in 1908, &quot;Anti-Matrimony&quot; in 1910, and the poetry collection &quot;The Far Familiar&quot; in 1937. In 1950, MacKaye published &quot;The Mystery of Hamlet King of Denmark, or What We Will&quot;, a series of four plays written as prequels to William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. His sister Hazel acted in or helped produce several of his early works.

He was made a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1914. In the 1920s, MacKaye was poet in residence at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. He lectured on the theatre at Harvard, Yale, Columbia and other universities in the United States.

Percy MacKaye is considered to be the first poet of the Atomic Era because of his sonnet &quot;The Atomic Law,&quot; which was published in the Christmas 1945 issue of &quot;The Churchman&quot;.

==Civic Theatre==
In 1912, he published &quot;The Civic Theatre in Relation to the Redemption of Leisure; A Book of Suggestions&quot;. Here he presented a concept of Civic Theatre as &quot;the conscious awakening of the people to self-government in its leisure&quot;. To this end he called for the active involvement of the public, not merely as spectators, professional staff not dominated by commercial considerations and the elimination of private profit by endowment and public support. This idea is most apparent in his play &quot;Caliban by the Yellow Sands&quot; (1916). This concept was influential on Platon Kerzhentsev and the Soviet Proletcult Theatre movement.

<text>James Morrison Steele MacKaye ( ; June 6, 1842 – February 25, 1894) was an American playwright, actor, theater manager and inventor. Having acted, written, directed and produced numerous and popular plays and theatrical spectaculars of the day, he became one of the most famous actors and theater producers of his generation.

==Biography==
Steele MacKaye was born in Buffalo, New York. His father, Colonel James M. MacKaye, was a successful attorney and an ardent abolitionist; Steele&#x27;s mother died when he was young. He had two sisters, Emily MacKaye von Hesse and Sarah MacKaye Warner, and two half-brothers, William Henry MacKaye and Henry Goodwin MacKaye. While young, Steele attended Roe&#x27;s Military Academy in Cornwall-on-Hudson and the William Leverett Boarding School in Newport. Under the influence from his father, who was also an art connoisseur, MacKaye initially planned to become an artist. During his teens he studied painting with William Morris Hunt, then continued his studies at the École des Beaux Arts in Paris. He returned to the U.S. in order to serve for the Union Army during the American Civil War. A member of New York&#x27;s Seventh Regiment, he eventually rose to the rank of Major before an illness forced his retirement. MacKaye would later model in full uniform for John Quincy Adams Ward&#x27;s Seventh Regiment Memorial statue, which stands in Central Park.
In 1869, MacKaye traveled to Paris with his family, where he became the disciple of the renowned French acting teacher François Delsarte. Under Delsarte, MacKaye learned to enhance performance through pose and gesture. He would later teach and utilize this system during his career. On his return to the United States a year later, he lectured on the philosophy of ethics and &quot;natural&quot; acting in New York, Boston and elsewhere. In 1873 he became the first American actor to portray Hamlet in London.

MacKaye was the author of thirty plays. As a dramatist, MacKaye is seen as representative of the transition from an older theatrical tradition to a newer one, incorporating realism and naturalistic portrayals. His first play to be published was &quot;Hazel Kirke&quot;, which was privately printed in New York in 1880. The play, while a smash-hit with audiences, received neutral-to-negative response from theatre critics, who criticized its lack of a primary antagonist. In the mid-1880s he helped establish the first school of acting in the United States, the Lyceum Theatre School, which later became the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (AADA). He was also well known for his theatrical innovations, having invented a variety of devices including flame-proof curtains, folding theater seats and the &quot;Nebulator&quot;, a machine for creating clouds onstage. In all, he patented over 100 theatrical inventions.

By 1885, MacKaye had established three theaters in New York City: the St. James, Madison Square and the Lyceum Theatre. For the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair of 1893, he began to construct a theatre capable of seating 10,000 people—the &quot;Spectatorium&quot;—but the Panic of 1893 deprived the project of necessary funds. The project was left incomplete.

MacKaye married Jeannie Spring, the daughter of Marcus Spring, during the time he was teaching art at Marcus Spring&#x27;s Eagleswood Military Academy, in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. After a brief marriage to Jeannie, which ended in divorce, MacKaye married his second wife, Mary K. Medbery, in 1865. The couple had six children, four of whom attained notability: philosopher James MacKaye, poet and playwright Percy MacKaye, conservationist Benton MacKaye, and suffragist Hazel MacKaye.

Steele MacKaye fell ill in February 1894, and his physicians urged him to move to a warmer climate. He left Chicago on February 22 on a private train headed for San Diego. The train was near Timpas, Colorado on February 25 when MacKaye&#x27;s health began to rapidly decline up until his death at 7:45 in the morning. His son, Percy, published his father&#x27;s biography, &quot;Epoch: The Life of Steele MacKaye&quot;, in 1927.

==Inventions==
Steele MacKaye was widely known for being an innovator in theater technology. He patented and invented more than 100 inventions including the Folding Theater Chair, the Fire Curtain, and the unique Double-Stage System.

The Double-Stage System was a large elevator-like structure that was used to load scenery on and off of the stage. It was only ever installed in the Madison Square Theatre (not to be confused with Madison Square Garden) because of its cost and complexity. The system cut the time of intermissions between scenes of plays from around 6 minutes to 40 seconds, which made the theatre more enjoyable to go to as a whole.

MacKaye is also responsible for converting the Lyceum Theatre to an overhead-lit theater. This is the first recorded occurrence of an overhead lighting structure in a North-American theater.

==Works==

He wrote the plays &quot;Monaldi&quot; and &quot;Marriage&quot;. Other works include: 
* &quot;The Twins&quot; (1876) (with Andrew Carpenter Wheeler)
* &quot;Won at Last&quot; (1877)
* &quot;Through the Dark&quot; (1878), later called &quot;Money Mad&quot;
* &quot;Hazel Kirke&quot; (1880)
* &quot;Anarchy&quot; (1887), originally called &quot;Paul Kauvar; or Anarchy&quot;, later shortened to &quot;Anarchy&quot;, and then again changed to &quot;Paul Kauvar.&quot;
* &quot;A Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot;
* &quot;In Spite of All&quot;

<text>Gotham Central is a police procedural comic-book series that was published by DC Comics. It was written by Ed Brubaker and Greg Rucka, with pencils initially by Michael Lark. The story focused on the Gotham City Police Department and the difficulties of its officers living and working in Gotham City, home of Batman.

==Publication history==

===Formation===
Greg Rucka and Ed Brubaker collaborated on the &quot;Officer Down&quot; Batman crossover. They wanted to do a series about the police in Gotham City and finally obtained approval from DC executives. The writers wanted Michael Lark for pencils and waited nearly a year to get him onboard due to scheduling, but used the opportunity to plan out the storylines. They plotted out the new series&#x27; elements and decided to script the first story arc together, then split the lengthy cast into two shifts: Rucka would write the GCPD&#x27;s day shift storylines, Brubaker would take the night shift, and Lark would pencil them both. &quot;Gotham Central&quot;&#x27;s debut yielded Eisner Award nominations in 2003 for Best New Series, Best Writer (Rucka), Best Writer (Brubaker), and Best Penciller/Inker (Lark).

===Sales problems===
&quot;Gotham Central&quot; repeatedly failed to break the top 100 comics in sales. Despite this, DC Comics were encouraged by the improved sales of the trade paperback collected editions. In an interview, Ed Brubaker stated that the book sold pretty well and was never in danger of cancellation, outselling almost all of Vertigo&#x27;s books at the time. Ultimately Lark and Brubaker moved on to other projects, and, after three years of publication, the series ended amid the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; aftermath. It continued to have sales troubles through to the conclusion: issue #37 ranked 102nd place, and issue #38 ranked 120th place on the distributor&#x27;s charts.

===End of the series===
Despite the sales, writer Greg Rucka assured that DC would have continued publishing &quot;Gotham Central&quot; as long as he wanted to write it and that it was his decision to conclude the series. Rucka felt that the book was a co-creation between himself, Lark and Brubaker and when they left, with issue #25 and #37 respectively, it was time to move on. The year-long break provided by the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; event provided an opportune place to close out the main storylines. At one point, Rucka was in talks to replace &quot;Gotham Central&quot; with a new series called &quot;Streets of Gotham&quot;, which would focus on Renee Montoya as a private investigator. Those plans were scrapped in favor of making Montoya a major character in the weekly series &quot;52&quot;, with Rucka as a co-writer. In 2009, DC released an unrelated series called &quot;&quot; that has been described as a mixture of &quot;Gotham Central&quot; and another canceled Batman series, &quot;&quot;.

==Cast of characters==

The &quot;Gotham Central&quot; cast was divided between the day and night shifts, with arcs alternating between both sets of characters. Main characters among the ranks of the detectives were Marcus Driver, Romy Chandler, Renee Montoya, Crispus Allen and Josephine &quot;Josie Mac&quot; MacDonald. Their superiors, Commissioner Michael Akins, Captain Margaret &quot;Maggie&quot; Sawyer and Lieutenant Ron Probson also appeared prominently. Jim Corrigan, a corrupt CSI, features near the end of the series.

The supporting cast was mainly pulled from the large roster of the Gotham City Police Department and some characters were subjects of their own story arcs. Long-time supporting characters of Batman, James Gordon and Harvey Bullock, also made recurring appearances. Batman himself, although not often seen, played a prominent role in the series.

==Stories/story arcs==
==Characters after the series&#x27; end==
* Michael Akins left the force under unknown circumstances during the one-year gap with James Gordon taking back the role of Police Commissioner. It is implied that Akins had either become corrupt himself, or had done nothing to curb corruption in the GCPD.
* The deceased Allen became the Spectre during the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. He was briefly turned into a Black Lantern before regaining the Spectre mantle. 
* Renee Montoya became one of the major characters in &quot;52&quot;, a series dealing with the aftermath of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. During the series she takes up the guise of &quot;the Question&quot;.
* Josie Mac and Maggie Sawyer have also appeared in minor roles in &quot;52&quot; and both have made sporadic appearances in Batman-related comic books, with Sawyer eventually becoming a prominent member of Kate Kane&#x27;s supporting cast. Sawyer and Kane are currently engaged to be married.
* Marcus Driver and Josh Azeveda appeared in the miniseries &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;, along with the Spectre (Crispus Allen). Romy Chandler and Stacy also made brief cameos.
* Harvey Bullock is hired back onto the force under disciplinary probation during the &quot;one-year gap&quot;—the exact reasons are never expressly stated—with the understanding that he is not allowed to make a single mistake. He and Batman have set a &quot;clean slate&quot; for their new working relationship (see &quot;&quot;).

==Awards==
* Eisner Awards – Best Serialized Story 2004 – &quot;Half a Life&quot; (&quot;Gotham Central&quot; #6–10).
* Harvey Awards – Best Single Issue or Story 2004 – &quot;Half a Life&quot; (&quot;Gotham Central&quot; #6–10). Tied with &quot;Love &amp; Rockets&quot; #9.
* Gaylactic Spectrum Awards – Best Other Work 2004 – &quot;Half a Life&quot; (&quot;Gotham Central&quot; #6–10). Tied with &quot;Angels in America&quot;.

==Collected editions==
==Television series==
In August 2006, Brubaker said that he was told that many people at Warner Bros. loved the comic, and that if they had not had a moratorium on Batman television shows, they &quot;could have set up &quot;Gotham Central&quot; at WB in a heartbeat&quot;.

A television series titled &quot;Gotham&quot; was in development by Fox in 2013, following the career of Jim Gordon prior to the appearance of Batman. The series premise bears similarities to &quot;Gotham Central&quot;. It premiered on September 22, 2014. To coincide with &quot;Gotham&quot;″s premiere, DC Comics issued a reprint of &quot;Gotham Central&quot; #1, at a special price of $1.

An untitled police procedural TV series from Matt Reeves was in development, to be set in the same continuity as the film &quot;The Batman&quot;. &quot;Gotham Central&quot; was being considered as a title for the series. The development of the show was revealed to not being moving forward and put on hold in March 2022.

<text>Peregrine Andrew Morny Cavendish, 12th Duke of Devonshire, (also known as &quot;Stoker&quot;; born 27 April 1944), is an English peer. He is the only surviving son of Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire, and his wife, the former Deborah Mitford. He succeeded to the dukedom following the death of his father on 3 May 2004. Before his succession, he was styled Earl of Burlington from 1944 until 1950 and Marquess of Hartington between 1950 and 2004. His immediate family are owner-occupiers of Chatsworth House with an estimated net worth of £910 million, and own large estates in Derbyshire, North Yorkshire and Ireland.

== Early life and education ==
Cavendish was born on 27 April 1944 in Chatsworth House, the second child and only surviving son of Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire, and Deborah Mitford. His mother was the youngest of the Mitford sisters. His paternal uncle was William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, who married Kathleen &quot;Kick&quot; Kennedy (a member of the Kennedy family and younger sister of U.S. President John F. Kennedy). He is a first cousin of merchant banker Jonathan Guinness, 3rd Baron Moyne (born 1930), the Irish preservationist Desmond Guinness (1931–2020), Max Mosley (1940–2021), former President of the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), and fourth cousin of Diana, Princess of Wales. His niece was fashion model Stella Tennant (1970–2020). 

He was educated at Eton College, Exeter College, Oxford, where he read history, and at the Royal Agricultural College (now the Royal Agricultural University), Cirencester.

==Horse racing==
The Duke is well known in the world of horse racing and served as Her Majesty&#x27;s Representative at Ascot and chairman of Ascot Racecourse Ltd. In 1980 he was elected to the Jockey Club and in 1989 he was appointed its Senior Steward (that is, chairman). During his five-year term of office, he oversaw a number of changes within the racing industry, in particular the creation of the British Horseracing Board which is now the governing authority for British racing. He was appointed first chairman of the board in June 1993 and retired at the end of his term in 1996. 

He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to racing in 1997 and Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in the 2009 New Year Honours for his services as Her Majesty&#x27;s Representative at Ascot.

==Other interests==
The Duke was appointed a trustee of the Wallace Collection in 2007 and is also a trustee of Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust.

He is chairman of the Devonshire Arms Hotel Group, a chain of countryside hotels in North Yorkshire and Derbyshire, and deputy chairman of Sotheby&#x27;s. He collects modern British and contemporary painting and sculpture, as well as works in other areas, many of which are on display at his family seat Chatsworth House. The Duke and Duchess and the house and estate grounds were featured in the BBC documentary series &quot;Chatsworth&quot;. In December 2012, he sold &quot;Auxiliary cartoon for the Head of a Young Apostle&quot; by Raphael for £29.7m at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction.

As of 2016, he is the owner of Heywood Hill, a notable bookstore in London where his aunt Nancy Mitford used to work. The duke is a current patron of St Wilfrid&#x27;s Hospice in Eastbourne. The duke has provided a Swaledale Ram as mascot to the Mercian Regiment since the regiment&#x27;s inception. In 2017, he presented Private Derby to the Regiment.

He was the third chancellor of the University of Derby, serving from 2008 to March 2018. He stepped down from the role in 2018 and his son and heir, William Cavendish, Earl of Burlington was nominated and installed as the fourth and current Chancellor of the university in March 2018. 

The Duke is close to the British royal family and attended the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. The Duke then attended the service of thanksgiving for Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh at Westminster Abbey and the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022, as well as the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla in 2023. Later that year, the Duke and Duchess sat in the royal carriage with King Charles III and Queen Camilla in the King&#x27;s procession at Royal Ascot.

== Marriage and children ==
The Duke married Amanda Carmen Heywood-Lonsdale, daughter of Commander Edward Gavin Heywood-Lonsdale, on 28 June 1967. Queen Elizabeth II and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother attended the wedding ceremony. They have three children:

* William Cavendish, Earl of Burlington (born 6 June 1969), heir apparent to the dukedom.
* Lady Celina Imogen Cavendish (born 4 October 1971)
* Lady Jasmine Nancy Cavendish (born 4 May 1973), married to Nicholas Dunne, son of Sir Thomas Dunne KG KCVO

==Chatsworth House==
One of the homes of the Duke and Duchess is Chatsworth House in Derbyshire. They are involved in the operation of the house as a tourist attraction. In 2019, the Duke and Duchess visited Sotheby&#x27;s to view &quot;Treasures From Chatsworth&quot;, including art and artifacts from Chatsworth House, that would be displayed in New York.

==Titles, honours and arms==
=== Titles ===
He succeeded as the 12th Duke of Devonshire, 12th Marquess of Hartington, the 7th Earl of Burlington, the 15th Earl of Devonshire, the 15th Baron Cavendish of Hardwick, and the 7th Baron Cavendish of Keighley on 3 May 2004.

In February 2010, the Duke announced his intention to give up his title if hereditary peers were removed from the House of Lords, on the basis that &quot;the aristocracy is dead&quot; and &quot;because then it would be clear-cut what the people wanted, and it would be confusing to maintain hereditary titles&quot;.

===Honours===
*Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (2008)
*Commander of the Order of the British Empire (1997)
*Chancellor of the University of Derby (October 2008 – March 2018)

<doc id="634542" wikidata="Q1524867" url="?curid=634542" title="Schmorl's nodes">
<text>Schmorl&#x27;s nodes are protrusions of the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc through the vertebral body endplate and into the adjacent vertebra.

==Signs and symptoms==
These are protrusions of disc material into the surface of the vertebral body, which may contact the marrow of the vertebra and lead to inflammation. The protrusions are also associated with necrosis of the vertebral bone and the question of whether these protrusions and inflammation cause the necrosis, or whether the cartilage migrates into areas that have become necrotic due to other conditions, is under investigation.

They may or may not be symptomatic, and their link to back pain is controversial. Williams and colleagues note that this relationship may be due to lumbar disc disease, as the two commonly occur simultaneously.

==Causes==
Schmorl&#x27;s nodes are fairly common, especially with minor degeneration of the aging spine, but they are also seen in younger spines. Schmorl&#x27;s nodes often cause no symptoms, but may simply reflect that &quot;wear and tear&quot; of the spine has occurred over time; they may also reflect that bone strength was at one time somewhat compromised, perhaps due to a vitamin D deficiency although this has yet to be confirmed with studies, or if heavy lifting is done at a young age before the vertebral bodies are completely ossified such as in young farm workers. There is also a strong heritability of Schmorl&#x27;s Nodes (&gt;70%). While often non-complicating, Schmorl&#x27;s nodes also tend to occur more often in cases of spinal deformity, specifically Scheuermann&#x27;s disease. These defects are caused when the vertebra loses its normal function and is not moving/hypomobile/subluxated. During this time the forces normally distributed by the nucleus pulposus (the incompressible gelatinous center of the intervertebral disc) are concentrated in a certain area causing endplates to deform in a concave manner.

==Diagnosis==

Schmorl&#x27;s nodes can be detected with X-rays, although they can be imaged better by CT or MRI. They are considered to be vertical disc herniations through the cartilaginous vertebral body endplates. Schmorl&#x27;s nodes can sometimes be seen radiographically, however they are more often seen on MRI, even when not visible on plain X-rays. They may or may not be symptomatic, and their etiological significance for back pain is controversial. In a study in Spine by Hamanishi, et al., Schmorl&#x27;s nodes were observed on MRI in 19% of 400 patients with back pain, and in only 9% of an asymptomatic control group. The authors concluded that Schmorl&#x27;s nodes are areas of &quot;vertical disc herniation&quot; through areas of weakness in the endplate.

==Management==
Painful Schmorl&#x27;s node can be diagnosed by discography, which demonstrates an intravertebral disc herniation with concomitant back pain. Surgical treatment should be considered in a patient with persistent disabling back pain. When surgical treatment is indicated, eradication of the intervertebral disc including Schmorl&#x27;s node and segmental fusion are preferable.

==Eponym==
Schmorl&#x27;s nodes are named after German pathologist Christian Georg Schmorl (1861–1932).

<text>In mathematics, the Bendixson–Dulac theorem on dynamical systems states that if there exists a formula_1 function formula_2 (called the Dulac function) such that the expression

:formula_3

has the same sign (formula_4) almost everywhere in a simply connected region of the plane, then the plane autonomous system

: formula_5

: formula_6

has no nonconstant periodic solutions lying entirely within the region. &quot;Almost everywhere&quot; means everywhere except possibly in a set of measure 0, such as a point or line.

The theorem was first established by Swedish mathematician Ivar Bendixson in 1901 and further refined by French mathematician Henri Dulac in 1923 using Green&#x27;s theorem.

==Proof==
Without loss of generality, let there exist a function formula_2 such that

:formula_8

in simply connected region formula_9. Let formula_10 be a closed trajectory of the plane autonomous system in formula_9. Let formula_12 be the interior of formula_10. Then by Green&#x27;s theorem,

: formula_14

Because of the constant sign, the left-hand integral in the previous line must evaluate to a positive number. But on formula_10, formula_16 and formula_17, so the bottom integrand is in fact 0 everywhere and for this reason the right-hand integral evaluates to 0. This is a contradiction, so there can be no such closed trajectory formula_10.

<doc id="634546" wikidata="Q2346507" url="?curid=634546" title="Bolitaeninae">
<text>The Bolitaeninae are a subfamily, in the family Amphitretidae, of small, common pelagic octopuses found in all tropical and temperate oceans of the world. The taxonomy of this taxon is not entirely certain. Recent research suggests just two genera exist, &quot;Bolitaena&quot; and &quot;Japetella&quot;, both of which are thought to be monotypic by some authorities and under this view, the family would represent two very similar species: &quot;Bolitaena pygmaea&quot; and &quot;Japetella diaphana&quot;. However, currently a second species of &quot;Bolitaena&quot;, &quot;B. massyae&quot; is also recognised.

== Physical description ==
Bolitaenins are characterised by their small size—up to 8.5 cm or 3.3 in mantle length and 12 cm total length in &quot;Japetella&quot; species—and their comparatively short arms, much shorter than their dome-shaped mantles. The arms have a single series of suckers; in males, these suckers are greatly enlarged on the third right arm. In &quot;Bolitaena&quot; (but not &quot;Japetella&quot;) this arm is also modified into a hectocotylus, an appendage used to facilitate transfer of spermatophores during mating.

The eyes of both species are laterally compressed and are distinctly smaller and set further apart from the brain on longer optic stalks in &quot;Bolitaena&quot; than in &quot;Japetella&quot;. This feature may be the only way to differentiate the two genera when examining subadults. Mature males are rarely encountered. Their translucent, gelatinous bodies are fragile and easily damaged during collection.

Perhaps the most striking feature of the family is seen in mature females. Upon maturity, a ring-shaped photophore (a light-producing organ) develops to encircle the mouth. This is believed to be an adaptation to life in gloomy, deep ocean waters. The bioluminescent ring may help males and females find each other.

== Habitat ==

Mature bolitaenins occupy depths in the meso- to bathypelagic zones of the water column, down to about 1,425 m. Younger animals (under 20 mm mantle length) are known to remain in shallower waters, either from 170–270 m or 500–800 m depending on size. &quot;Japetella&quot; is known to venture into far northern waters.

== Reproduction ==

Mating is thought to occur at or below 1,000 m deep. In the darkness, whether mating is successful or not may depend on the female; she can choose whether to signal the male with her circumoral photophore. The light emitted by the photophore is believed to be of a specific wavelength, possibly both preventing miscommunication and the attraction of predators.

After mating, the female then rises to about 800 m to brood. Her eggs are interconnected by a number of stalks and the whole mass is held safely by means of suckers near her mouth. Due to the cold (4–5 °C) environment, brooding likely takes several months; the female is thought to forgo food during this entire period. After hatching, the young octopuses rise to the productive, upper 300 m of the water column where they remain until reaching a certain size (7–20 mm). As they mature, the young begin their gradual descent to the mesopelagic and eventually bathypelagic zones.

<doc id="634561" wikidata="Q674739" url="?curid=634561" title="Alexander Mackenzie (composer)">
<text>Sir Alexander Campbell Mackenzie KCVO (22 August 1847 – 28 April 1935) was a Scottish composer, conductor and teacher best known for his oratorios, violin and piano pieces, Scottish folk music and works for the stage.

Mackenzie was a member of a musical family and was sent for his musical education to Germany. He had many successes as a composer, producing over 90 compositions, but from 1888 to 1924, he devoted a great part of his energies to running the Royal Academy of Music. Together with Hubert Parry and Charles Villiers Stanford, he was regarded as one of the fathers of the British musical renaissance in the late nineteenth century.

==Life and career==
Mackenzie was born in Edinburgh, the eldest son of Alexander Mackenzie and his wife, Jessie Watson &quot;née&quot; Campbell. He was the fourth musician of his family. His great-grandfather was an army bandsman; his grandfather, John Mackenzie, was a violinist in Edinburgh and Aberdeen; his father was also a violinist, the conductor of the orchestra in the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, and editor of &quot;The National Dance Music of Scotland&quot;. Mackenzie&#x27;s musical talent emerged early: at the age of eight he was playing nightly in his father&#x27;s orchestra. He was sent for his musical education to Germany, living with his teacher, the Stadtmusiker August Bartel, in Schwarzburg-Sondershausen in Thuringia, where he entered the conservatorium under K. W. Ulrich and Eduard Stein, remaining there from 1857 to 1861, when he entered the ducal orchestra as a violinist.
Mackenzie wished to continue his violin studies with the teacher Prosper Sainton, who had taught his father, and in 1862 he successfully applied for admission to the Royal Academy of Music in London, where Sainton taught. His other tutors were the principal, Charles Lucas (harmony), and Frederick Bowen Jewson (piano). Shortly after starting at the Academy, he was awarded a King&#x27;s Scholarship, the income from which Mackenzie augmented by playing in theatre and music hall pit-bands, as well as in classical concerts under the leading conductor Michael Costa. This sometimes caused him to neglect his academic work, and on one occasion, having failed to prepare a piece by a classical composer for a piano examination, he improvised, &quot;starting off in A minor and taking care to end in the same key&quot;, and convinced the examiners that it was a little-known work by Schubert. Recalling this prank in his old age, he added, &quot;I have never ceased to wonder at my escape, and would certainly not advise any student to run a similar risk today.&quot; Some of Mackenzie&#x27;s early compositions were performed at the Academy.

===Early career===
In 1865 Mackenzie returned to Edinburgh. He undertook a heavy workload of teaching, both privately and in local colleges, and from 1870 he was in charge of music at St George&#x27;s, Charlotte Square. In 1873 he took on the conductorship of the Scottish Vocal Association. He also played the violin in orchestral concerts both locally and at the Birmingham Festivals from 1864 to 1873, meeting visiting musicians including the conductor Hans von Bülow, who became a firm friend. In 1874 Mackenzie married a local woman, Mary Malina Burnside (d. 1925). They had a daughter, Mary. Mackenzie successfully began composing orchestral music. Bülow conducted his overture &quot;Cervantes&quot; in 1879, and two of his Scottish rhapsodies were premiered by August Manns in 1880 and 1881.
By this time, Mackenzie&#x27;s heavy workload as a teacher and player began to undermine his health. Two of Bülow&#x27;s pupils in Florence, Italy, Giuseppe Buonamici and George F. Hatton, introduced Mackenzie to the musical philanthropists Carl and Jessie Hillebrand. After a few months&#x27; rest in their care, Mackenzie began composing full-time. Apart from a year in England (1885), he made Florence his home until 1888. During this period he spent much time in the company of Franz Liszt. He began composing large-scale works, including instrumental, orchestral and choral music and two operas. His cantatas &quot;The Bride&quot; and &quot;Jason&quot; were successfully given, and the Carl Rosa Company commissioned his first opera, &quot;Colomba&quot;, written to a libretto prepared by Francis Hueffer, music critic of &quot;The Times&quot;. The opera premiered successfully in 1883. A second opera, &quot;The Troubadour&quot;, produced by the same company in 1886, was less successful, though Liszt thought well enough of the piece to begin work on a piano fantasia based on themes from it. Pablo de Sarasate premiered a violin concerto by Mackenzie at the Birmingham Festival of 1885. For the 1885–86 season, Mackenzie was appointed conductor of Novello&#x27;s oratorio concerts in London. Liszt paid his final visit to England chiefly to hear his &quot;Saint Elisabeth&quot; performed under Mackenzie&#x27;s direction in 1886.

===Peak years===
In October 1887, the principal of the Royal Academy of Music, Sir George Macfarren, died, and in early 1888 Mackenzie was appointed to succeed him. He held the post for 36 years until his retirement in 1924. At the time, the Academy was overshadowed by its younger rival, the Royal College of Music, and Mackenzie set about reviving its reputation. He was fortunate in enjoying the friendly support of his opposite numbers at the College, George Grove, and, from 1895, Hubert Parry, and the two institutions established a close working relationship of mutual benefit. In addition to overhauling the curriculum and reorganising the faculty, Mackenzie engaged personally with his students by teaching composition and conducting the student orchestra. In 1912 the Academy moved from its old buildings in Mayfair to purpose-built premises in Marylebone. In his later years as principal, Mackenzie became markedly conservative, forbidding his students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he stigmatised as &quot;a pernicious influence&quot;.

Mackenzie was conductor of the Royal Choral Society and the Philharmonic Society Orchestra between 1892 and 1899, giving the British premières of many works, including symphonies by Tchaikovsky and Borodin. 
Like his father, Mackenzie took a great interest in folk music and produced several collections of arrangements of traditional Scottish songs. In 1903, interested in investigating Canadian folk-song, he undertook a tour of Canada organised by the Anglo-Canadian musician Charles A.E. Harriss. His visit stimulated the cultural scene and choral festival competitions were held throughout Canada with eleven new choral societies being founded. Mackenzie conducted concerts during the tour, exclusively of British music.

Mackenzie was regarded as a cosmopolitan musician. He spoke fluent German and Italian and was elected to the post of President of the International Musical Society which he held from 1908 to 1912. From his early days playing in orchestras in Edinburgh and Birmingham he had met and become friendly with many leading international musicians, including Clara Schumann, Joseph Joachim, Charles Gounod and Antonín Dvořák. His friendship with Liszt began in Mackenzie&#x27;s student days in Sondershausen and lasted for the rest of Liszt&#x27;s life.

Although Mackenzie composed a large number of works, which met with great public success, he found, as had Arthur Sullivan earlier and as did Parry contemporaneously, that running a large musical conservatoire left less time for composition. Both at the Academy and elsewhere, he was a popular lecturer. Among his topics were Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Falstaff&quot;, the text of his lecture on which was later published in translation in Italy. Outliving his contemporaries Sullivan and Parry, he gave memorial lectures on their lives and works. At a time when Sullivan&#x27;s reputation in academic musical circles was not high, Mackenzie&#x27;s tribute was generous and enthusiastic.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Mackenzie&#x27;s professional prominence brought him many honours from universities and learned societies in Britain and abroad. He was knighted in 1895, and created a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1922, the year of the centenary celebrations of the Royal Academy, in which he was the central figure. On 15 October 1923 the BBC broadcast one of the earliest examples of a one-composer programme, devoting one hour and 45 minutes to performances of Mackenzie&#x27;s works, conducted by the composer. On his eighty-sixth birthday, over forty distinguished musicians presented him with a silver tray inscribed with facsimiles of their signatures, including Elgar, Delius, Ethel Smyth, Edward German, Henry Wood, and Landon Ronald. He retired from the Academy and from public life in 1924.

Mackenzie died in London in 1935 at the age of 87.

==Works==

&quot;The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; says of Mackenzie&#x27;s music that it is &quot;cosmopolitan in style and somewhat old-fashioned for its period, displaying influences of French and German composers, including Bizet, Gounod, Schumann, and Wagner.&quot; &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; says that although Mackenzie&#x27;s music was eclipsed by the works of later composers, &quot;he and his contemporaries may be regarded as having laid the foundations of the musical renaissance in 19th- and early 20th-century Britain&quot;.

During his time teaching in Edinburgh, Mackenzie wrote several works, including a piano trio, a string quartet and a piano quartet, and he maintained a considerable output despite his crowded schedule both then and later. &quot;The Times&quot; reported that his list of compositions numbered 90, of which 20 were distinctly Scottish.
His orchestral works include the overture &quot;Cervantes&quot;, performed at Schwarzburg-Sondershausen in 1877, three &quot;Scottish Rhapsodies&quot;, a violin concerto premiered by Pablo de Sarasate at the Birmingham Festival of 1885, a &quot;Scottish&quot; concerto for piano (1895), a suite, &quot;London Day by Day&quot; (1902), and a &quot;Canadian Rhapsody&quot; (1905). He composed incidental music to six dramas, including &quot;Ravenswood&quot;, and J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;The Little Minister&quot;. The funeral march from his music for Henry Irving&#x27;s production of &quot;Coriolanus&quot; was played at Irving&#x27;s funeral in 1905 and at Mackenzie&#x27;s memorial service at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in 1935. He worked on a symphony but did not complete it.

It was as a composer of vocal music that Mackenzie first achieved national fame. His cantata &quot;The Bride&quot; was a success at the Three Choirs Festival of 1881. Edward Elgar played in the violins at the première and later remarked that meeting Mackenzie was &quot;the event of my musical life&quot;. A second cantata, &quot;Jason&quot;, for the Bristol festival of 1882, was also well received. His most famous choral work was the oratorio &quot;The Rose of Sharon&quot;, written for the Norwich festival of 1884. The words were adapted from the &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; by Joseph Bennett, music critic of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, who later provided Sullivan with the text for &quot;The Golden Legend&quot;. &quot;The Dream of Jubal&quot; (1889), is an unusual combination of recitation and choral sections, composed for the jubilee of the Liverpool Philharmonic Society in 1889.

Mackenzie&#x27;s operas began in 1883 with &quot;Colomba&quot;, first produced by the Carl Rosa Company. It was a success, but his second opera &quot;The Troubadour&quot; (1886) was not. Francis Hueffer&#x27;s libretti for both operas were written in an antiquated style that attracted much criticism. Mackenzie&#x27;s other operas were &quot;The Cricket on the Hearth&quot; (1914), &quot;The Eve of St John&quot; (1924), and two almost-complete operas, &quot;The Cornish Opera&quot; and &quot;Le luthier&quot;.

Critics observed that Mackenzie&#x27;s operatic and choral music was generally ill-served by his librettists: &quot;Much of his best work ... is neglected, partly because unlike his contemporaries, Parry and Stanford, Mackenzie went for the texts of his larger vocal works to such librettists as Joseph Bennett and Hueffer, instead of to the vital things of English poetry and literature.&quot; &quot;[He] was content with librettos written by hacks according to the current operatic conventions.&quot; This even applied to his one excursion into comic opera, &quot;His Majesty&quot;, a piece in the Gilbert and Sullivan vein, with a libretto by F. C. Burnand and R. C. Lehmann and additional lyrics by Adrian Ross, presented at the Savoy Theatre in 1897. &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;Mr Burnand&#x27;s experience as a librettist of comic opera, and Sir Alexander Mackenzie&#x27;s inexperience in this class of composition might lead the public to expect a brilliant book weighed down by music of too serious and ambitious a type. The exact opposite is the case.&quot; Burnand&#x27;s libretto was judged dull and confused, but Mackenzie&#x27;s music was &quot;marked by distinction as well as humour.&quot;

Mackenzie also wrote books on Giuseppe Verdi (1913) and Franz Liszt (1920). In his memoirs &quot;A Musician&#x27;s Narrative&quot; (1927), he described &quot;a lifetime spent, boy and man, in the service of British music&quot;.

<doc id="634563" wikidata="Q2467252" url="?curid=634563" title="Ocythoe tuberculata">
<text>Ocythoe tuberculata, also known as the tuberculate pelagic octopus or football octopus, is a pelagic octopus. It is the only known species in the family Ocythoidae.

&quot;Ocythoe tuberculata&quot; is found in warm and temperate seas, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, such as the North Pacific Ocean off California.

==Description==

=== Morphology ===
&quot;Ocythoe&quot; are one of the few cephalopods to have a swimbladder. In captivity, two specimens were observed controlling their buoyancy and shooting water &quot;forwards, upwards, sideways, and backwards&quot; from the upper channel of the mantle cavity. &quot;Ocythoe&quot; achieves this by altering the dorso-lateral corners of the mantle opening. The entire swimbladder structure rests on the &quot;visceral mass&quot; and connects to the mantle cavity. It is also innervated and vascular. Juvenile and adult swimbladders exhibit key differences. Juveniles tend to have thicker and &quot;gelatinous&quot; walls with more spherical cells. Adults on the other hand have a less gelatinous appearance and a constitutively open lumen. Dwarf males do not possess swimbladders. &quot;Ocythoe&quot; is the only cephalopod to possess a proper gas bladder, based on specimens kept in captivity, although the origins of the gas is still an area of research.

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
Female and male tuberculate pelagic octopuses have distinct morphological differences. Females exhibit a larger dorsal mantle length upon maturity around 300 millimeters, while males only reach a dorsal mantle length of around 30 millimeters. The females are around long when full-grown. The males are considerably smaller, around . Males also have a well-developed hectocotylus on the third arm. This structure contains the spermatophores and is dislodged and detached in the mantle of the female during mating and remains for an extended period of time for fertilization.

Young females and mature males have been observed residing inside salps, although little is known about this relationship.

=== Distribution ===
&quot;O. tuberculata&quot; have been well known for inhabiting mainly northern hemisphere waters, typically in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as the eastern and western parts of the North Atlantic. &quot;O. tuberculata&quot; has also been found in the northern Pacific waters, with very few individuals found in the southern hemisphere, either in the Indian or Pacific oceans. &quot;O. tuberculata&quot; has typically been found in warmer waters. There is some speculation that warm ocean currents moving eastward from the Indian Ocean are responsible for the small sample of specimens found in northern pacific waters, but this has yet to be confirmed or denied.

&quot;O. tuberculata&quot; is a near-surface dwelling pelagic octopus, living between depths of 100 and 200 meters.

== Lifespan and reproduction ==
Female tuberculate pelagic octopuses are known to have a high fecundity, producing nearly 100,000 eggs. One female specimen caught in May 2003 had a record-breaking 1 million eggs, the most of any Octopoda. Egg size is typically very small, measuring 1.75 mm long and 1.00 mm wide. This has been seen as a trend in other pelagic octopus species. Tuberculate pelagic octopuses is said to be viviparous, meaning their offspring develop with in the body of the parent. However, several different authors dispute exactly how and where this development occurs. The general consensus is the eggs develop in expanded oviducts. Fertilization occurs when the hectocotylus is deposited from the male in the female&#x27;s mantle cavity.

== Diet ==
The diet of &quot;Ocythoe&quot; is undocumented, however most octopuses are predatory. It is known that open ocean octopuses typically feed on prawns, fish, or other cephalopods.

== Predators ==
There are a number of known predators that prey on Ocythoe. These are lancet fishes (&quot;Alepisaurus borealis&quot; and &quot;A. ferox&quot;), tunas (&quot;Thunnus alalunga, T. thunnus, and Germon germon)&quot;, and Risso&#x27;s dolphin (&quot;Grampus griseus&quot;). These predators have a large vertical range, and typically prey on &quot;O. tuberculata&quot; between 100 and 200 meters.

<doc id="634567" wikidata="Q3364490" url="?curid=634567" title="Maitrayaniya Upanishad">
<text>The Maitrayaniya Upanishad (, ) is an ancient Sanskrit text that is embedded inside the Yajurveda. It is also known as the Maitri Upanishad (, ), and is listed as number 24 in the Muktika canon of 108 Upanishads.

The &quot;Maitrayaniya Upanishad&quot; is associated with the &quot;Maitrayanas&quot; school of the Yajurveda. It is a part of the &quot;black&quot; Yajurveda, with the term &quot;black&quot; implying &quot;the un-arranged, motley collection&quot; of content in Yajurveda, in contrast to the &quot;white&quot; (well arranged) Yajurveda where Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and Isha Upanishad are embedded. The chronology of Maitrayaniya Upanishad is contested, but generally accepted to be a late period Upanishadic composition.

The &quot;Maitrayaniya Upanishad&quot; consists of seven &quot;Prapathakas&quot; (lessons). The first &quot;Prapathaka&quot; is introductory, the next three are structured in a question-answer style and discuss metaphysical questions relating to Atman (Self), while the fifth to seventh &quot;Prapathaka&quot; are supplements. However, several manuscripts discovered in different parts of India contain lesser number of &quot;Prapathakas&quot;, with a Telugu language version showing just four, and another Burnell version showing just one section. The content and structure of the Upanishad is also different in various manuscript recensions, suggesting that the Upanishad was extensively interpolated and expanded over a period of time. The common kernel of the Upanishad across different recensions, states Max Muller, is a reverence for Self, that can be summarized in a few words as, &quot;(Man) is the Self – the immortal, the fearless, the Brahman&quot;.

The &quot;Maitri Upanishad&quot; is an important ancient text notable, in its expanded version, for its references to theories also found in Buddhism, elements of the Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hinduism, as well as the Ashrama system. The text is also notable for its practice of &quot;Anyatrapyuktam&quot; (or &quot;Ityevam Hyaha&quot;), that is being one of the earliest known Sanskrit texts that embedded quotes with credits and frequent citations to more ancient Sanskrit texts.

==Etymology==
The etymological root of the Maitrayaniya Upanishad is unclear. This has historically led to a variety of names and spellings for this Upanishad.

&quot;Maitra&quot; (Sanskrit: मैत्र) and &quot;Maitri&quot; (मैत्री) are related words which literally mean &quot;kindly, benevolent, good will, amity, friend of all creatures&quot;. The likely root for the Upanishad is probably the name of an ancient Indian scholar, Maitra, sometimes spelled Maitri or Maitreya, giving the text the alternate name of Maitri or Maitra Upanishad. The ancient scholar is also credited with a school of thought, thus giving the text the name Maitrayaniya Upanishad. Other names for this text include Maitrayani Upanishad (मैत्रायणि उपनिषद्), Maitrayana Upanishad, Maitrayaniya-brahmana Upanishad, Sriyagussakhayam Maitrayaniya-brahmana Upanishad, Maitreyopanishad and Maitrayaniyopanishad.

==Chronology==
The Maitrayaniya Upanishad offers no firm evidence as to its date. But on various internal criteria such as its passages on yoga and its doctrinal heterogeneity, scholarly consensus places its composition in late 1st millennium BCE or even slightly later, likely after Atharva Veda texts such as the Mundaka Upanishad and Prashna Upanishad. But its precise chronology is unclear and contested. The chronology is difficult to resolve because all opinions rest on scanty evidence, an analysis of archaism, style and repetitions across texts, driven by assumptions about likely evolution of ideas, and on presumptions about which philosophy might have influenced which other Indian philosophies. van Buitenen identified at least five compositional layers in the work, composed at different times by different groups or individuals.

When discussing the chronology of the Upaniṣads, Olivelle did not specifically mention the Maitri Upanishad but noted that the last group of principal Upanishads &quot;cannot be much older than the beginning of the common era.&quot; Mahony suggests an earlier date, placing Prashna along with Maitri and Mandukya Upanishads, as texts that probably emerged about early fourth century BCE. Jayatilleke states, &quot;Buddhism is not far removed in time from, though it is prior to, the Maitri Upanishad&quot;. Nakamura states that &quot;although Buddhistic influence can be seen in the Maitri Upanishad (from words used), the particular terms and modes of expression of Mahayana Buddhism do not yet appear (in it)&quot;.

Phillips, in contrast, lists Maitri Upanishad before and about the time the first Buddhist Pali canonical texts were composed. Ranade posits a view similar to Phillips, placing Maitri&#x27;s chronological composition in the fifth group of ancient Upanishads and last of the Principal Upanishads. Cowell too considers Maitri Upanishad as late era Upanishad, with its later sections comparatively modern, because of the structural and style differences within texts, inconsistencies in Poona manuscript, Calcutta (Kolkata) manuscript, Eckstein manuscript, Burnell manuscript and other manuscripts, and because some version of the manuscripts insert quotes from Vaishnavism.

Deussen states that the Upanishad is chronologically significant because its author(s) takes for granted the concepts and ideas found in Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hinduism, which must have been established by the time Maitri Upanishad was composed.

==Structure==
The extant recension of the text consists seven s (lessons), of which several sections are &quot;Khilas&quot; (appendices, supplements) added later. The last two are called as &quot;khila&quot; by medieval era Indian scholar Ramatirtha. Others consider the last three sections as supplements and appendices. Other discovered manuscript versions of the Maitri Upanishad present different number of sections, ranging from 1 to 4, without any appendices. There are also differences in style, structure and content among the discovered manuscripts when the text contains the same number of sections.

The text is a prose style Upanishad, with a motley collection of different sized paragraphs. The first section has four paragraphs, the second has seven, the third presents five paragraphs, while the fourth section contains six. As appendices, the fifth lesson has two paragraphs, while the sixth &quot;Prapathaka&quot; is the longest section with thirty eight paragraphs. The last supplementary section, or the seventh &quot;Prapāṭhaka&quot; has eleven paragraphs some with many sub-paragraphs.

The Maitrayaniya Upanishad is embedded after the Brahmana text of Yajur Veda, and in its opening passages refers to rituals contained therein. It contextually belongs to the Sannyasa Upanishads corpus. Hume includes it among his list of &quot;Thirteen Principal Upanishads&quot;.

==Contents==

Maitri Upanishad deals with the concept and nature of Atman (Self), the question of &quot;how is joy possible?&quot; and &quot;how one can achieve moksha (liberation)?&quot;; in later sections it offers a debate on possible answers.

===Meditation of Self is the essence of religious activity - First Prapathaka===
The text begins with the following prelude,

The above prelude is followed by an answer, offered as a tale of a king named Brihadratha who renounces his kingdom, lives an austere life and therewith seeks the knowledge of the eternal, the Self. Sage appears before the king. The king admits, &quot;I lack the knowledge of Self, you know the essence of Self&quot;, so please teach me. In the resulting reply, the sage first claims that the &quot;seeking the knowledge of Atman&quot; was a practice of the past, it is difficult and not in vogue, then urges the king to ask something else&quot;. The king insists, by asking a series of metaphysical questions to the sage.

The sage then shares with the king the philosophy of the Brahman (Universal Self, Cosmic Principle, Ultimate Reality), described in the next lessons. Paul Deussen states that parts of the above questions, on sorrow and frailty of human life is found in the oldest Upanishads of Hinduism, for example in chapters 3.4, 3.5, 3.7, 3.28 and 4.4 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, yet its declamation in the question form above in Maitri Upanishad, mirrors those found in Buddhism and Samkhya school of Hinduism. It is likely, states Deussen, that these two philosophies influenced the formulation of these questions in the form presented in Maitri Upanishad.

===Every individual has Self, which is serene, the highest light, the cosmic truth - Second Prapathaka===
Sakayanya answers the king&#x27;s question, in verse 2.2 of Maitri Upanishad, by asserting that &quot;Atman&quot; (Self) exists in every individual, and it is that inmost being which &quot;moves about without moving&quot; (exists everywhere), which dispels darkness of ignorance and error, which is serene, immortal, fearless and soaring for the highest light. The Maitri Upanishad states that this is the message of all Upanishads,

Sage Sakayanya thereafter narrates an ancient dialogue between s and Kratu, which is sourced from Rig Veda. The dialogue states that &quot;man was created in the image of its creator, innately has all its powers, and is driven by it&quot;. The dialogue raises a series of metaphysical objections and inconsistencies with this premise, and then offers theories to resolve the what, how and why this is so.

The Maitrayaniya Upanishad states that the &quot;Prajapati&quot; (lord of creatures) divided himself fivefold and entered all creatures of the world. The divided parts are &quot;Prana&quot;, &quot;Apana&quot;, &quot;Samana&quot;, &quot;Udana&quot; and &quot;Vyana&quot;. &quot;Prana&quot; is upward breath, &quot;Apana&quot; is downward breath (exhale). &quot;Vyana&quot; holds the &quot;Prana&quot; and &quot;Apana&quot; in balance, giving strength to the whole body. &quot;Samana&quot; is that which carries gross food to &quot;Apana&quot; and then subtler food throughout the body. &quot;Udana&quot; is that which delivers food up and down the body from what has been eaten or drunk.

Now the Upamsu-vessel (or prana) depends on the Antaryama-vessel (apana) and the Antaryama-vessel (apana) on the Upamsu-vessel (prana), and between these two the self-resplendent (Self) produced heat. This heat is the purusha(person), and this purusha is Agni Vaisvanara.
The Purusha resides within, assumes the nature of &quot;Buddhi&quot; (intellect, power to reason). However, having divided itself fivefold, its purpose unattained, it impulsively feels, &quot;let me enjoy objects&quot;. It is distracted from its purpose, its Self. The Upanishad, thereafter recites the &quot;parable of chariot&quot; found in older Upanishads. Max Muller summarizes it as, &quot;the perceptive organs are his reins, the active organs his horses, the body his chariot, the mind the charioteer, the whip being the temperament (emotions). Driven by that whip, his body goes round and round like a wheel driven by the potter. This body is made intelligent, and he (Atman) is the driver thereof.&quot; He experiences the fruits of his Karma, his personality the weaving of the three Guṇas (sattvam, rajas, tamas).

In essence, however, man seeks the true bliss, the immortal happiness, the resplendent contentment, the calm freedom that is his Self, states paragraph 2.7 of Maitri Upanishad. This Self of his is pure, unchanging, unmoving, undefilable, serenely calm constant, the spectator within him, the self-abiding. The Self is inherently good, enjoyer of Ṛta (that which is properly/excellently joined, natural perfection, harmonious, holistic, right, truth).

===Human suffering, its causes and the nature of Selfs - Third Prapathaka===
The third &quot;Prapathaka&quot; of Maitri Upanishad presents a theory of Self that is different from the Vedanta school of Hinduism, rather it resonates with its Samkhya school. It enumerates different types of Atman, the three &quot;Gunas&quot; and how these &quot;qualities of personality&quot; overwhelm him from his essential nature into egoistic life of cravings, the source of evil and sorrow in a man&#x27;s life, and other terminology from the Samkhya philosophy.

The third Prapathaka opens with the question, &quot;if Self is inherently great, then who is this Self that suffers from the &#x27;bright and dark fruits&#x27; of karma, rebirth and is overcome by &quot;Dvandva&quot; (pairs of opposite such as heat and cold, health and disease, etc)?&quot;

As answer, the Maitrayaniya Upanishad states that there is another, different Self, calling it &quot;Bhutatman&quot; (the elemental Self), which transmigrates. In paragraph 3.2, the Upanishad presents the &quot;theory of gross elements and subtle elements&quot; which combine to form &quot;Sarira&quot; (शरीर, body). The &quot;elemental Self&quot; resides in this body, and is overcome by &quot;prakrti guna&quot; (inner nature of an individual&#x27;s personality). This, states the text, is cause of confusion, conflicting desires, unsteady behaviors and self-conceit. Man, because of this confusion, binds himself with suffering, just like a bird binds itself inside a net. Human suffering is the result of human actions (Karma) and complex interplay of human psychology (Guṇas). However, the &quot;immortal Self&quot; is, states the text, unaffected by the elemental Self&#x27;s confusion and drifts. The third Prapathaka explains the two Self and human personalities using the metaphor of &quot;fire, iron and forge&quot; as follows,

The Maitri Upanishad in paragraph 3.4 states that true essence of man is not his body, but his immortal Self. The elemental Self is mere reflection of his &quot;Gunas&quot; (psychology), a source of his suffering, which manifests itself as quality of &quot;Tamas&quot; (darkness), such as &quot;confusion, fear, grief, sloth, carelessness, decay, sorrow, hunger, thirst, infidelity, anger, ignorance, cruelty, meanness, envy, shamelessness, pride, folly, dishonesty, arrogance, miserliness&quot;. The quality of &quot;Rajas&quot; () too, states the Upanishad, is a result of this interplay of overpowered elemental Self and &quot;guna&quot;, and lists the manifold manifestation of this as, &quot;greed, covetousness, craving, possessiveness, unkindness, hatred, deceit, restlessness, mania, fickleness, wooing and impressing others, servitude, flattery, hedonism, gluttony, prodigality and peevishness&quot;. While the elemental Self is thus affected, the inner Self, the immortal Self, the inner spectator is unaffected, asserts the Upanishad.

===Realization of True Self, union with Brahman - Fourth Prapathaka===
The fourth Prapathaka begins with the question, &quot;how can the elemental Self obtain union with the true Self&quot;?

The Maitri Upanishad answers that the elemental Self is distracted, intoxicated and attached to numerous things in life, craving for false delights, which prevents its ability to know the true Self. The remedy for elemental Self, in order to realize the true Self, is to acquire the knowledge of the Veda, perform &quot;svadharma&quot; (one&#x27;s duty) based on one&#x27;s age, be part of Rta, devote oneself to &quot;Ashrama&quot; stage one is in. The Upanishad, in paragraph 4.3 acknowledges the inherent tension between ascetic life of renouncing society for Self-knowledge and the &quot;svadharma&quot; in each &quot;Ashrama&quot; stage of life with devotion to society. It calls asceticism qua asceticism wrong, and then immediately calls asceticism right, necessary and praises asceticism for the inner perfection and Self-knowledge it helps bring. The fourth prapathaka does not resolve the inherent conflict it acknowledges. In paragraph 4.4, the Upanishad asserts that meditation, austerities, perseverance and knowledge leads to Brahman state, of bliss that is imperishable, infinite and unchangeable. It is this union of Brahman that frees the true Self unto bliss.

===Deity worship can be rewarding, but must be temporary, replaced with meditation and self knowledge - Fourth Prapathaka===
In paragraph 4.5, the Maitrayaniya Upanishad presents the question as to which of the gods is best for worship. The text answers that they are merely forms of Brahman, that one should meditate upon, worship, yet ultimately deny them and reject the gods. They are means to man&#x27;s liberation, which is obtained through Self meditation and in Self-knowledge. This is expounded on, as follows,

Hume states that the construct of the question above is notable, as it thus incorporates the three triads of thought found in ancient Indian philosophies - the Vedic trinity, the philosophical trinity in different schools of Hinduism, as well as the Brahmanic trinity.

===Appendix: Pantheistic Self and Samkhya theory of Gunas - Fifth Prapathaka===
The fifth Prapathaka then presents a motley collection of a hymn and various theories, all focussed on the pantheistic premise that everything is manifested form of Cosmic Self, all is One Brahman-Atman.

A hymn, inserted into paragraph 5.1 and called the &quot;Kutsayana Hymn&quot;, states that the Self is the hidden unchanging reality, the tranquil, the unlimited, the one without beginning or end. The Self, states this pantheistic hymn, is Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Prajapati, Agni, Varuna, Vayu, Indra, Moon, Anna (Food), Yama, Earth. All life, all existence is manifold manifestation of the Self. The hymn calls the Self as &quot;Prabhu&quot; (Lord) of all pleasure and delight.

The paragraph 5.2 of the Upanishad asserts the Guna theory of Samkhya school of Hinduism. The text states that in the beginning the universe was darkness (&quot;Tamas&quot;) alone. The Brahman impelled &quot;Tamas&quot; to differentiate, thus arose passion (action qua action, &quot;Rajas&quot;). The Brahman impelled &quot;Rajas&quot; to continue differentiating, and thus arose purity (right action, truth, &quot;Sattva&quot;). These three Gunas reside in everything. The aspect of Brahman that characterizes &quot;Tamas&quot; is Rudra. The aspect of Brahman that characterizes &quot;Rajas&quot; is Brahma. The aspect of Brahman that characterizes &quot;Sattva&quot; is Vishnu. These threefold concepts have differentiated manifold into eightfold, elevenfold, into infinite number of parts, states the Upanishad. These, all creatures, and the &quot;Visva&quot; (विश्व, world, empirical universe) are manifestations of one Supreme Self, within and without. Self&#x27;s existence is reflected by the development of goodness (virtues). It is this Self that is reflected in man, just like sun is reflected in different vessels of water, posits paragraph 5.2 of the fifth Prapathaka.

===Appendix: Enumeration of Selfs - Sixth Prapathaka===
The sixth Prapathaka enumerates Self into two, the one that is within each human being and one without that is in Sun. These correspond to two paths, one inner and one outer. The existence of inner Self can only be inferred, while the outer Self can be perceived. The outer Self is the evidence of the inner Self, and the inner Self is the evidence of the outer Self. In Paragraph 6.1, the Maitri Upanishad refers to more ancient texts of this teaching of Self and its relation to ethical life and introspective behavior, as follows,

Just like in time (&quot;kala&quot;), the solar fire ultimately consumes all beings and the outer world as food, asserts the Upanishad, it is the man&#x27;s Self that consumes inner food. The outer Self and inner Self are, assuredly, states the Upanishad, one and same thing. Man should meditate on both these Selfs with the symbol Om (), revere them through &quot;Vyahrtis&quot; and the Savitri verse, asserts paragraph 6.2 of the text.

===Appendix: The symbol Om and its significance - Sixth Prapathaka===

Om represents Brahman-Atman. The three roots (or three-footed nature) of the word are &quot;A&quot; + &quot;U&quot; + &quot;M&quot;. The sound is the body of Self, and it manifests in three: as gender-endowed body - feminine, masculine, neuter; as light-endowed body - Agni, Vayu and Aditya; as deity-endowed body - Brahma, Rudra and Vishnu; as mouth-endowed body - Garhapatya, Dakshinagni and Ahavaniya; as knowledge-endowed body - Rig, Saman and Yajur; as world-endowed body - Bhūr, Bhuvaḥ and Svaḥ; as time-endowed body - Past, Present and Future; as heat-endowed body - Breath, Fire and Sun; as growth-endowed body - Food, Water and Moon; as thought-endowed body - intellect, mind and psyche. Brahman exists in two forms - the material form, and the immaterial formless. The material form is changing, unreal. The immaterial formless isn&#x27;t changing, real. The immortal formless is truth, the truth is the Brahman, the Brahman is the light, the light is the Sun which is the syllable &quot;Om&quot; as the Self.

The world is Om, its light is Sun and the Sun is also the light of the syllable Om. Meditating on Om, is acknowledging and meditating on the Brahman-Atman (Self).

Savitri prayer and meditation with the rising sun, a means to Self worship

Anyone who loves his Self, states paragraph 6.7 of the Upanishad, loves the &quot;Savitri&quot; – literally, that which &quot;vivifies, ray of light that enlivens knowledge&quot;. The Sun is &quot;Savitri&quot;, and thus one who loves his Self, loves the splendor of the Sun. The text thereafter explains the meaning of Savitri verse from Rig Veda 3.62.10, its emphasis on &quot;may the Sun inspire our thoughts, stimulate our thoughts&quot;. To think is to meditate, states paragraph 6.7 of Maitri Upanishad. To worship Sun, is to worship Self.

The sixth Prapathaka includes etymologies of six Sanskrit words, stating that these are all related to stimulating Self-knowledge. It is this Self, this Self that is the immortal inside man, the perceiver, thinker, goer, doer, evacuator, begetter, speaker, taster, smeller, seer, hearer, toucher and all-prevader. The Self underlies the senses yet is more than the sensory capabilities of man, it is pristine unity beyond cause, effect and action.

===Appendix: Types of knowledge, all gods are nothing but Self, that Self is within each human being - Sixth Prapathaka===
Knowledge is of two types, asserts the Maitri Upanishad: subjective and objective. The subjective knowledge is about the external world dependent on the person, the objective knowledge is about the Self and inner, hidden principles of the world. It is the Self of man that comes to know subjective and objective knowledge.

The Self of man is identical with various gods and powers, it is the deities Isana, Sambhu, Bhava, Rudra, Prajapati, Visvarij, Hiranyagarbha, Satyam, Prana, Hamsa, Sastri, Vishnu, Narayana, Arka, Savitri, Dhatri, Vidhatri, Samraj, Indra, Indu and Sun. It is this Self that is to be thought after, sought after. Man should find this Self within him.

===Appendix: The metaphorical theory of food, of time - Sixth Prapathaka===
Sections 6.9 through 6.17 of the Maitri Upanishad is motley collection of three parts, all relating to the metaphysical interpretation of food. This is connected with the much older metaphorical discussion of &quot;food&quot; in chapter 5 of the Chandogya Upanishad. Everything is food to everything else, and taking of food is described by the Upanishad as a form of worship, a sacrifice offered by the Self to the Self.

In the first part of discussing food, the section discusses the feeding of one&#x27;s own body as a form of religious ritual, and includes a hymn that is &quot;food prayer&quot; and that urges &quot;Atman&quot; to gratify the reciter as well as gratify all creatures in the universe. In the second part, the Upanishad calls apparent form of Brahman as food, then differentiates between food and the eater of food, and metaphorically maps food all to the nature of existence, of Prakrti (nature) and Purusha (consciousness).

In the third part, in paragraphs 6.11 to 6.17, the text states that food is the cause of all that is in space and hidden principles, then expands the idea to include time by calling &quot;Kala&quot; (Time) is the cause of food, and then celebrates Time as Brahman. Food, states the sixth Prapathaka, is the source of the world, Time is the origin of food, and Sun is the origin of Time. It symbolically maps the Time and Timeless as changing reality and the unchanging Brahman, respectively.

There is a motley collection of ideas in the discussion of &quot;Kala&quot; (Time), within the sixth Prapathaka of the Upanishad. For example, in section 6.14, it sets out to prove Time exists, acknowledges the difficulty in proving Time exists by Pramana (epistemology in Indian philosophy), then inserts a theory of inductive inference for epistemological proof as follows,

The section includes the concept of Time and non-Time, calling these as two forms of Brahman, mirroring the Upanishad&#x27;s earlier discussion of Material and non-Material universe. It defines non-Time as &quot;what was there before the appearance of Sun&quot;, and Time as &quot;what began with the appearance of Sun&quot;. Non-Time is indivisible, Time is divisible. Year is the &quot;Murti&quot; (idol) of time. Time ripens everything, asserts the Upanishad. Sun is the foundation for Time, Sun is the Self (the Atman) of Brahman. The Brahman is the eternal, the boundless, the unborn, the immeasurable, the infinite, that which existed before Time, the light in the Sun, the colors in the smokeless fire, and all are only that one, one alone.

===Appendix: Yoga, Samkhya and Vaishnava doctrines - Sixth Prapathaka===
Sections 6.18 through 6.30 of the Maitri Upanishad is another motley collection of various theories. The supplementary section starts with the theory of Yoga, as the way by which the highest human goal of Self-knowledge can be attained. Paul Deussen states that this highest goal is the knowledge of &quot;Atman&quot; (Self, one&#x27;s inmost being), and with that knowledge realized, becoming one with the &quot;Atman&quot;. Along with Katha Upanishad and Shvetashvatara Upanishad, the Maitri Upanishad offers one of the oldest known descriptions of Yoga theory. The sixth Prapathaka enumerates six limbs, a shorter list than the eight limbs of Patanjali&#x27;s Yogasutra. The identified Yoga steps for Self-knowledge in Maitrayaniya Upanishad are: &quot;Pranayama&quot; (regulation of breath), &quot;Pratyahara&quot; (withdrawal of senses inwards), &quot;Dhyana&quot; (meditation), &quot;Dharana&quot; (concentration of mind on one idea), &quot;Tarka&quot; (creative, contemplation of idea), &quot;Samadhi&quot; (absorption with the idea, a state of being one with the idea).
After enumerating the sixfold yoga, the Upanishad states that the path to Self-knowledge is yogic meditating on Self and Brahman. This meditation leads to the state that &quot;unites everything in the eternal, highest Atman&quot;. The one who thus knows Atman, asserts the text, becomes innately one of goodness, liberated, limitless, blissful.

In section 6.23, the Upanishad re-asserts that Brahman is the syllable Om, and then adds that Brahman is manifested in the name of Vishnu, recommending the worship of both. In section 6.30, the Maitri Upanishad acknowledges a debate, based on the Samkhya theories, whether it is the Prakrti or Purusha who attains moksha. The text asserts that it is Purusha, because man by default is controlled by his senses and mind, all emotions such as fear and bashfulness are products of a mind in bondage; man is what his mind is, and for freedom (moksha) man needs to recognize and know his Self.

===Appendix: Self exists, it is everywhere - Sixth Prapathaka===
In section 6.31, the Maitri Upanishad acknowledges concepts, such as &quot;Sūnya&quot; (voidness) found in Buddhism, in a form that suggests a challenge to its premise, as follows,
The text answers that Self exists, that reason, steadfastness, recollection, consciousness are related to Self, as plants are related to seeds, as smoke is related to flame and sparks to fire. The Self (Atman), states the Upanishad, is the source of all life-forces, all worlds, all the Vedas, all gods, all beings, all knowledge, all nature, all literature, all sciences, all explanations, all commentaries, it is in everything. The Upanishad (secret meaning) of the Self is that &quot;it is the Reality of the realities&quot;.

===Appendix: What a man thinks, that he becomes - Sixth Prapathaka===
The goal of meditation, states Maitri Upanishad in section 6.34, is to reach liberation and tranquility of mind through Self-realization. This liberation is achieved through one&#x27;s mind, by refining one&#x27;s thoughts, through knowing Atman. The text includes a hymn, which in abridged form expresses these ideas as follows,
The mind of man, states the Upanishad, is the cause of his bondage and his freedom. The one whose mind is controlled by objects of sense is unfree, the one whose mind is guided by his Self is free (mukti).

===Appendix: Self is unlimited and there is Oneness in the whole world - Seventh Prapathaka===
The seventh Prapathaka of Maitrayaniya Upanishad states that the Self is &quot;the inmost being of everything&quot;, it is unlimited and it is manifestation of one Brahman. It is Self, it is deep, it is pure, it is brilliant. The Self is tranquil, it is fearless, it is sorrowless, it is indescribable joy. It is intelligent, it is patient, it is truth, it is harmony. It is self-dependent, it is steadfast, it is immortal, it is without limits. It is Vishnu, it is Shiva, it is Aditya, it is Indra. It is everywhere, it is in creatures, it is in nature, it is in music. It is in gods, it is in seasons, it is in planets, it is in hymns. It is the Self, it is the Lord, it manifests in many, they are all one and the same.

===Appendix: Beware of false teachers and non-Vedic doctrines; seek your own truth - Seventh Prapathaka===
The final supplement of the Maitri Upanishad is a polemic against philosophies that declared antagonism to the Vedic teachings and its doctrine of Self. The section does not name any specific philosophy, but scholars have included Carvakas and Buddhism among the likely candidates. Paul Deussen states that the description though probable, is not concrete enough to prove that this section targets Buddhism. Max Muller expresses stronger doubts that the target was Buddhism. Jayatilleke, on the other hand, states that Buddhism is the likely target.

The paragraph eight of seventh Prapathaka opens by stating that there are hindrances to knowledge, and it is false teaching by those who continually beg, preach hedonism, wear red robes, ear rings and skulls, rogues as religious mendicants, who &quot;for a price, offer that they can remove the evil influences of spirits, demons, ghosts, goblins and the like&quot;. In this group of false teachers, are others who misrepresent Vedas, have developed the strategy of deceptive circular arguments, false claims, faulty reasoning and irrational examples against the Vedic literature. All false teachers declare good to be evil, evil to be good, knowledge to be ignorance, and ignorance to be knowledge. They compel a dharma that destroys Vedas and other &quot;Sastras&quot; (scriptures, sacred books). One must not associate with these people, states the text, because they are robbers and love to oppress the believers in the Veda. The text quotes a passage to express its sentiment as follows,

In sections 7.9 and 7.10, the Upanishad refers to Katha Upanishad, and recommends that man should seek to know both knowledge and non-knowledge, the real and the delusion, the truth and untruth. Don&#x27;t be &quot;like blind men led by one who is himself blind&quot;, states the Maitri Upanishad.

==Similarities and differences with Buddhist teachings==
The Maitri Upanishad shows signs of influence, or at least awareness of Buddhist teachings. Rhys Davis, about a 100 years ago, stated that Maitri Upanishad is the earliest Sanskrit literary usage of the term &#x27;samadhi&#x27;, a word also found in early texts of Buddhism. However, the concept of meditation and union is far older than the known literally use of the term &quot;Samadhi&quot;. The idea of &quot;union&quot;, expressed with terms such &quot;Samadhi&quot;-root or related words, occur in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the oldest and longest Upanishad of the Hinduism. There are many other words and ideas that are shared between Maitri Upanishad and earliest known Buddhist texts.

Maitri Upanishad explicitly mentions, in seventh &quot;Prapathaka&quot;, a sect of thought whose teachers wear &quot;reddish robe&quot; (&quot;kasaya&quot;–), who deny the &quot;existence of Self&quot; premise (&quot;nairatmyavada&quot;–), preach a &quot;dharma destructive of Vedas and Upanishads&quot; (&quot;vedadisastra himsaka dharmabhidhyanam&quot;–) and whose goal is hedonistic &quot;attainment of pleasure&quot; (&quot;ratimatram phalam asya&quot;–). This sect reference could potentially be Carvakas, Ajivakas, Buddhism, Jainism or another unknown sect of thought that existed in ancient India. Jayatilleke states that this reference in Maitri Upanishad is likely to be to the Buddhists since, 
# Ajivikas or Jainism upheld the belief in Self, which the Buddhists explicitly rejected
# Carvakas did not value &quot;dharma&quot;, while Buddhists were referred to as &quot;dharmavadin&quot; by opposing schools of thought.
# Buddhists were strongly accused of being hedonists at this time.
# Dhammapada seems to regard red robes as a distinct attire of Buddhist monks.
Jayatilleke additionally notes that there are many words as well as ideas such as the contemplation of the organic substances of the body and &quot;brahma-kosa&quot; theory in the sixth &quot;Prapathaka&quot; of this Upanishad that has &quot;a Buddhist flavor&quot;.

Despite the similarities in words and some ideas, the teachings in the Upanishads of Hinduism, including Maitrayaniya Upanishad, however, are founded on the premise that &quot;the Self and Brahman exists&quot;, and these texts discuss the paths to know, realize one&#x27;s Self and Brahman. This makes the fundamental premise of Maitrayaniya and other Upanishads of Hinduism distinctly different from Buddhism&#x27;s key premise that there is &quot;no Self, no Soul&quot;.

===Anatman and Niratman===
The term &quot;niratman&quot; appears in the &quot;Maitrayaniya Upanishad&quot; such as in verses 6.20, 6.21 and 7.4. &quot;Niratman&quot; literally means &quot;selfless&quot;. The verses 6.22 and 6.23 discuss sound-Brahman (Om, &quot;sabda-brahman&quot;, lower Brahman) and soundless-Brahman (empty, &quot;asabda-brahman&quot;, higher Brahman), then teaches that both should be known. The &quot;niratman&quot; concept has been interpreted to be analogous to &quot;anatta&quot; doctrine (&quot;anatman&quot;) of Buddhism. The ontological teachings, however, are different. In the Upanishad, states Thomas Wood, numerous positive and negative descriptions of various states – such as &quot;niratman&quot; and &quot;sarvasyatman&quot; (the self of all) – are used in &quot;Maitrayaniya Upanishad&quot; to explain the nondual concept of the &quot;highest Self&quot;. According to Ramatirtha, states Paul Deussen, the &quot;niratman&quot; state discussion is referring to stopping the recognition of oneself as an individual Self, and reaching the awareness of universal Self or the metaphysical Brahman.

==Reception==
The Maitri Upanishad is oft cited text in comparative studies of Buddhism and Hinduism, as well as the likely influence of one on the other. Monier-Williams referred to Maitrayaniya Upanishad, among other Vedic literature, in his review of the relationship between Hinduism and Buddhism.

In studies on the earliest discussion of Yoga theory, Maitri Upanishad is among the most referred to.

<text>Sir Edward Montague Compton Mackenzie, (17 January 1883 – 30 November 1972) was a Scottish writer of fiction, biography, histories and a memoir, as well as a cultural commentator, raconteur and lifelong Scottish nationalist. He was one of the co-founders in 1928 of the National Party of Scotland along with Hugh MacDiarmid, Cunninghame Graham and John MacCormick. He was knighted in the 1952 Birthday Honours List.

==Background==
Edward Montague Compton Mackenzie was born in West Hartlepool, County Durham, England, into a theatrical family of Mackenzies, many of whose members used Compton as their stage surname, starting with his English grandfather Henry Compton, a well-known Shakespearean actor of the Victorian era. His father, Edward Compton Mackenzie, and mother, Virginia Frances Bateman, were actors and theatre company managers; his sister, Fay Compton (whose son was Anthony Pelissier, Compton&#x27;s nephew), starred in many of J. M. Barrie&#x27;s plays, including &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. He was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, London, and Magdalen College, Oxford, from where he graduated with a degree in Modern History. In 1910, he began a brief career as an actor at the Garrick theatre in &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Son&quot; by Hall Caine. From there he joined the satirical theatrical troupe &quot;The Follies&quot; under the management of the comedian and impresario H.G. Pélissier at the Apollo, Shaftesbury Avenue as a song lyricist and sketch writer. Within a year their relationship became estranged over the marriage of his sister Fay, aged 17, to the 37 year-old Pélissier. It was then that he took up novel writing as a full-time career bolstered by the success of his early best-seller &quot;Carnival&quot; (1912), partly based on his experience with &quot;The Follies.&quot;

==Writing==

Mackenzie is perhaps best known for two comic novels set in Scotland: &quot;Whisky Galore&quot; (1947) set in the Hebrides, and &quot;The Monarch of the Glen&quot; (1941) set in the Scottish Highlands. They were the sources of a successful film and a television series respectively. He published almost a hundred books on different subjects, including ten volumes of autobiography: &quot;My Life and Times&quot; (1883–71). He wrote history (on the Battle of Marathon and the Battle of Salamis), biography (&quot;Mr Roosevelt&quot;, a 1943 biography of FDR), literary criticism, satires, apologia (&quot;Sublime Tobacco&quot; 1957), children&#x27;s stories, poetry and so on. Of his fiction, &quot;The Four Winds of Love&quot; is sometimes considered his &quot;magnum opus&quot;. He was admired by F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose first book, &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, was written under the literary influence of Compton.

&quot;Sinister Street&quot;, his lengthy 1913–14 &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;, influenced George Orwell and Cyril Connolly, who both read it as schoolboys. Max Beerbohm praised Mackenzie&#x27;s writing for vividness and emotional reality. Frank Swinnerton, a literary critic, comments on Mackenzie&#x27;s &quot;detail and wealth of reference&quot;. Sir John Betjeman said of it, &quot;This has always seemed to me one of the best novels of the best period in English novel writing.&quot; Henry James thought it to be the most remarkable book written by a young author in his lifetime. After his conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1914, Mackenzie explored religious themes in a trilogy of novels, &quot;The Altar Steps&quot; (1922), &quot;The Parson&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1923) and &quot;The Heavenly Ladder&quot; (1924).

In 1922, Robin Legge, chief music critic of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, encouraged Mackenzie to write some of the earliest gramophone record reviews. In 1923 he and his brother-in-law Christopher Stone founded &quot;Gramophone&quot;, the still-influential classical music magazine. Mackenzie continued to edit the magazine until 1961. He was also the literary critic for the London-based national newspaper &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

Following his time on Capri, socialising with the gay exiles there, he treated the homosexuality of a politician sensitively in &quot;Thin Ice&quot; (1956). &quot;The Lunatic Republic&quot; (1959) is a political satire. For the version of English spoken by the inhabitants of Lunamania on the far side of the Moon, Mackenzie invented over 150 new words.

==&quot;Greek Memories&quot;==
Mackenzie worked as an actor, political activist and broadcaster. He served with British Intelligence in the Eastern Mediterranean during the First World War, later publishing four books on his experiences. According to these books, he was commissioned in the Royal Marines, rising to the rank of captain. His ill-health making front-line service impractical, he was assigned counter-espionage work during the Gallipoli campaign, and in 1916 built up a considerable counter-intelligence network in Athens, Greece then being neutral. He is alleged to have taken part in an attempt to assassinate the King by poison in August 1916, during which the royal palace was to be surrounded by fire to prevent him escaping. While his secret service work seems to have been valued highly by his superiors, including Sir Mansfield Smith-Cumming, his passionate political views, especially his support for the Venizelists, made him a controversial figure and he was expelled from Athens following the Noemvriana.

In 1917, he founded the Aegean Intelligence Service, and enjoyed considerable autonomy for some months as its director. He was offered the Presidency of the Republic of Cerigo, which was briefly independent while Greece was split between Royalists and Venizelists, but declined the office. He was recalled in September 1917. Smith-Cumming considered appointing him as his deputy, but withdrew the suggestion after opposition from within his own service, and Mackenzie played no further active role in the war. In 1919, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), and was also honoured with the French Legion of Honour, the Serbian Order of the White Eagle, and the Greek Order of the Redeemer.

After the publication of his &quot;Greek Memories&quot; in 1932, he was prosecuted the following year at the Old Bailey under the Official Secrets Act for quoting from supposedly secret documents. His account of the trial, vividly described, is in Octave Seven (1931–38) of his autobiography: the result was a fine of £100 and (prosecution) costs of £100. His own costs were over £1,000. Mackenzie states that a plea-bargain (described in the text as &quot;an arrangement&quot;) had been reached with the judge prior to the trial: in exchange for his pleading guilty, he would be fined £500 with £500 costs. However Sir Thomas Inskip, then attorney general who prosecuted the case, succeeded in annoying the trial judge to such an extent that he then reduced the penalties to a token amount. Even so, the costs of his defence and the withdrawal from sale of &quot;Greek Memories&quot; left Mackenzie out of pocket and an attempt was made to ask the authorities exactly which passages in the book they objected to so it could be re-issued with the offending material removed. This approach was rebuffed. In Octave Eight, covering the years 1939–45, Mackenzie recounts that the matter was raised in Parliament and a new version of &quot;Greek Memories&quot; was eventually published in 1939.
However, in spite of the withdrawal of the 1st edition a copy had already been deposited at the British Museum (which then contained what is now the independent British Library) but was not given a general catalogue reference making it effectively impossible to access. In 1994 &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper published an article about this anomaly &quot;The muzzling of Compton Mackenzie – 62 years on&quot;. Following this the 1932 edition was entered in the British Library&#x27;s public catalogue. 
In 2011 Biteback published the original 1932 edition of &quot;Greek Memories&quot;, including the Secret Intelligence Service memo detailing the offending passages of the book.

He was president of the Croquet Association from 1953 to 1966. He was president of the Siamese Cat Club. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1956 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the King&#x27;s Theatre, Hammersmith, London.

A strong supporter of Edward VIII, Mackenzie was a leading member of the Octavians, a minor society that campaigned in support of Edward VIII and for his return to the UK after he became the Duke of Windsor. According to a 1938 &quot;Time&quot; article Mackenzie had intended to write a book in support of Edward but abandoned the plan when the Duke asked him not to publish.

==Capri==
Between 1913 and 1920 he lived with his wife, Faith, on Capri at Villa Solitaria, and returned to visit in later years. This Italian island near Sorrento was known to be tolerant not just of foreigners in general, but of artists and homosexuals in particular. He became friends with the writer Somerset Maugham, a frequent visitor to the island. Faith had an affair with the Italian pianist Renata Borgatti, who was connected to Romaine Brooks.

Compton Mackenzie&#x27;s observations on the local life of the Italian islanders and foreign residents led to at least two novels, &quot;Vestal Fire&quot; (1927) and &quot;Extraordinary Women&quot; (1928). The latter, a roman à clef about a group of lesbians arriving on the island of Sirene, a fictional version of Capri, was published in Britain in the same year as two other ground-breaking novels with lesbian themes, Virginia Woolf&#x27;s love letter to Vita Sackville-West, &quot;&quot;, and Radclyffe Hall&#x27;s controversial polemic, &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;, but Mackenzie&#x27;s satire did not attract legal attention. He was a friend of Axel Munthe, who built Villa San Michele, and Edwin Cerio, who later became mayor of Capri.

==Scottish identity==

Mackenzie went to great lengths to trace the steps of his ancestors back to his spiritual home in the Highlands, and displayed a deep and tenacious attachment to Gaelic culture throughout his long and very colourful life. As his biographer, Andro Linklater, commented, &quot;Mackenzie wasn&#x27;t born a Scot, and he didn&#x27;t sound like a Scot. But nevertheless his imagination was truly Scottish.&quot; He was an ardent Jacobite, the third Governor-General of the Royal Stuart Society, and a co-founder of the National Party of Scotland. He became a member of the Scottish Arts Club in 1929. He was rector of University of Glasgow from 1931 to 1934, defeating Oswald Mosley, who later led the British Union of Fascists, in his bid for the job.

From 1920 to 1923 Mackenzie was the Tenant of Herm and Jethou. He built a house on Barra, in the Western Isles (Outer Hebrides) of Scotland, in the 1930s. On Barra, he gained inspiration and found creative solitude, and befriended a great number of people that he described as &quot;the aristocrats of democracy&quot;. 

He was a founding member of the short-lived secret organisation Clann Albain.

==Private life==
Mackenzie was married three times. On 30 November 1905 (aged 22), he married Faith Stone in St Saviour&#x27;s, Pimlico: they remained married for more than 50 years, until her death. In 1962 (aged 79), he married Christina MacSween, who died the following year. Lastly, he married his deceased wife&#x27;s sister, Lilian MacSween in 1965 (aged 82). (died 2009)

Mackenzie was a supporter of West Bromwich Albion F.C. Although from the north east of England, he &quot;was influenced in the choice of Albion as &#x27;my&#x27; team by the fact that their ground was romantically called The Hawthorns and that they were nicknamed the Throstles&quot;.

He was also a fan of snooker, and gave an account of the origin of the game&#x27;s name in &quot;The Billiard Player&quot; magazine of 1939, describing how a young lieutenant named Neville Chamberlain (not the former British Prime Minister) had been experimenting on the officers&#x27; mess table with the existing game of &quot;Black Pool&quot; featuring 15 red balls and a black. He presented the World Championship trophy to Joe Davis at the 1939 Championships.

After his retirement, Mackenzie sold the entire copyright in 20 of his books for a lump sum of £10,000 arguing that this was a capital receipt and not the proceeds of the business. The Court of Appeal held that this was assessable income as part of the proceeds of his business: Mackenzie v Arnold (1952) 33 TC 363.

In 1964 Mackenzie joined the &quot;Who Killed Kennedy Committee?&quot; set up by Bertrand Russell.

Mackenzie died on 30 November 1972, aged 89, in Edinburgh and was interred in St Barr&#x27;s churchyard cemetery at Eoligarry on the Isle of Barra.

<text>Vitreledonella richardi, also known as the glass octopus, is an incirrate octopus. It is in the genus &quot;Vitreledonella&quot; and of the family Amphitretidae.

==Description==
&quot;Vitreledonella richardi&quot;, also known as the glass octopus, is a transparent, gelatinous, and almost colorless meso- to bathypelagic octopod found worldwide in tropical and subtropical seas. Because this octopus mostly lives in deep ocean waters, there have been very few observations of it in the wild. One of the most recent sightings of the glass octopus occurred in 2021, when marine scientists from Boston University captured video of two glass octopuses while aboard the Falkor research vessel. It has a mantle length up to and a total length up to in adults. The upper three pairs of arms are subequal in length; in juveniles about as long as the mantle, in adults two to three times mantle length. The fourth, ventral pair is slightly shorter. Suckers are small, widely separated, and in a single series. Male glass octopuses have a hectocotlylized third left arm. This refers to when the male is ready to mate with a female, the arm can detach and release sperm to impregnate the female octopus. The large ampulla and the elongate accessory gland lie out among the internal reproductive organs, notable among mature males alongside its reproductive anatomical counterparts. Seen from the side, its eyes are rectangular. This cylindrical design, with the lens centered, results in a restricted horizontal field of vision, but is thought to be an adaptation that reduces the eye&#x27;s silhouette when viewed from below as part of the animal&#x27;s method of camouflage. The radula is heterodont, also known as heteroglossan, in which the middle or rhachidian tooth in each array has multiple cusps and the lateral teeth are unicuspid.

== Mating ==
&quot;Vitreledonella richardi&quot; is ovoviviparous. The female broods her eggs, of which hundreds are within the mantle cavity. Each egg measures about in length. Newborn larvae have a mantle length around . The young paralarvae are left to fend for themselves as the mother quickly dies after their birth.

Researchers at Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute conducted an experiment that later concluded young paralarvae beaks change as they get older, along with the depth of water which they want to live in. Younger paralarvae have stronger beaks to tear prey&#x27;s flesh off since that was all they ate. Once they got older, they lose that beak and form a faint, less developed one to eat softer-bodied prey. With their diet changing, they are predicted to move up from deeper levels (between 310 and 440, but can be as far as 1000 m) to the subsurface (between 110 and 300 m) as they get older.

== Ecology ==
Found mostly in the tropic and subtropic regions of seas worldwide, the glass octopus is prey to the feeding ecology of Northern bottlenose whales. More specifically noted is that of Tåsinge whale.

<doc id="634581" wikidata="Q991798" url="?curid=634581" title="Bruce Robinson">
<text>Bruce Robinson (born 2 May 1946) is an English actor, director, screenwriter and novelist. He wrote and directed &quot;Withnail and I&quot; (1987), a film with comic and tragic elements set in London in the late 1960s, which drew on his experiences as a struggling actor, living in poverty in Camden Town. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; (1984).

As an actor, he has worked with Franco Zeffirelli, Ken Russell and François Truffaut.

==Early life==
Bruce Robinson was born in London. He grew up in Broadstairs, Kent, where he attended the Charles Dickens Secondary Modern School. His parents were Mabel Robinson and American lawyer Carl Casriel, who had a short-term relationship during World War II. His father was a Lithuanian Jew. As a child, Robinson was constantly brutally abused by his stepfather Rob (an ex RAF navigator and a wholesale newsagent), who knew the boy was not his son. He had an elder sister Elly, whom he asked to teach him some French.

==Film career==
In his youth, Robinson aspired to be an actor and was admitted to the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. His first film role was as Benvolio in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1968). He then appeared in Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;The Music Lovers&quot; (1970), Barney Platts-Mills&#x27;s &quot;Private Road&quot; (1971) and François Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Adèle H.&quot; (1975). After spending several years out of work and living on social security payments, he became disenchanted and began writing screenplays. He was soon commissioned by David Puttnam to write the screenplay for Roland Joffé&#x27;s &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; (1984). Robinson was nominated for an Academy Award and won a BAFTA for his work. In 1989, Robinson wrote again for Joffé on &quot;Fat Man and Little Boy&quot;. He returned to acting briefly in 1998, taking a role in the film &quot;Still Crazy&quot;.

He is perhaps best known as the creative force behind the loosely autobiographical film &quot;Withnail and I&quot; (1987) which he based on his time as a struggling out-of-work actor. The character &#x27;Withnail&#x27; is reportedly based on his friend, Vivian MacKerrell, the character &#x27;I&#x27; (Marwood), on himself. Though unsuccessful at the box office, because of its success on video it has since been described as &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s biggest cult films&quot;. The film also launched the acting career of Richard E. Grant.

Robinson&#x27;s next two outings as a director (&quot;How to Get Ahead in Advertising&quot;, teaming him again with Richard E. Grant, and &quot;Jennifer 8&quot;, a Hollywood thriller) were not as well received. Robinson became disillusioned with the restrictive film-making practices of Hollywood and stopped directing to concentrate solely on writing. He wrote the screenplays for the films &quot;Return to Paradise&quot; (1998) and &quot;In Dreams&quot; (1999), but both were altered drastically by their producers, leaving Robinson once again disappointed.

Robinson eventually returned to directing with an adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s novel &quot;The Rum Diary&quot;, with the main role performed by Johnny Depp. With Aaron Eckhart and Richard Jenkins also on board, filming started on 25 March 2009 in Puerto Rico. It was released in 2011. In 2012, Robinson&#x27;s comic novella &quot;Paranoia in the Launderette&quot; was substantially filled out and adapted for the screen as &quot;A Fantastic Fear of Everything&quot; starring Simon Pegg. Robinson has completed a screenplay for his novel &quot;The Peculiar Memories of Thomas Penman&quot; and a book on Jack the Ripper, titled &quot;They All Love Jack&quot;.

==Author==
Robinson is also a successful author. His first published work was the semi-autobiographical novel &quot;The Peculiar Memories of Thomas Penman&quot; in 1998, based on his own childhood growing up in Broadstairs, Kent. In 2000, &quot;Smoking in Bed: Conversations with Bruce Robinson&quot;, edited by Alistair Owen, was published, made up of a selection of interviews given by Robinson. Meanwhile, since becoming a father, Robinson has also written two children&#x27;s books, &quot;The Obvious Elephant&quot; (2000) and &quot;Harold and the Duck&quot; (2005), both illustrated by his wife. The former is also available as an audiobook edition (2003), read by Lorelei King and Michael Maloney.
He spent about 15 years collecting and researching the materials on the mystery of Jack the Ripper, which later became his book &quot;They All Love Jack: Busting the Ripper&quot; (2015). Robinson identified songwriter Michael Maybrick as his prime suspect for the killings.

==Personal life==
Robinson married artist Sophie Windham in 1984, and they live in England. They have a daughter, Lily, and a son, Willoughby.

Robinson claimed to have been the target of unwanted sexual advances by Franco Zeffirelli during the filming of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, in which Robinson played Benvolio. Robinson says that the lecherous character of Uncle Monty in the film &quot;Withnail and I&quot; was influenced by Zeffirelli.

<text>Sir Halford John Mackinder (15 February 1861 – 6 March 1947) was a British geographer, academic and politician, who is regarded as one of the founding fathers of both geopolitics and geostrategy. He was the first Principal of University Extension College, Reading (which became the University of Reading) from 1892 to 1903, and Director of the London School of Economics from 1903 to 1908. While continuing his academic career part-time, he was also the Conservative and Unionist Member of Parliament for Glasgow Camlachie from 1910 to 1922. From 1923, he was Professor of Geography at the London School of Economics.

==Early life and education==

Mackinder was born in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England, the son of a doctor, and educated at Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School in Gainsborough, Epsom College, and Christ Church, Oxford. At Oxford he started studying natural sciences, specializing in zoology under Henry Nottidge Moseley, who had been the naturalist on the &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition. When he turned to the study of history, he remarked that he was returning &quot;to an old interest and took up modern history with the idea of seeing how the theory of evolution would appear in human development&quot;. He was a strong proponent of treating both physical geography and human geography as a single discipline. Mackinder served as President of the Oxford Union in 1883.

He received a degree in biology in 1883 and one in modern history the next year.

==Career==
In 1887, he published &quot;On the Scope and Methods of Geography&quot;, a manifesto for the &quot;New Geography&quot;. A few months later, he was appointed reader in geography at the University of Oxford, where he introduced the teaching of the subject. As Mackinder himself put it, &quot;a platform has been given to a geographer&quot;. This was arguably at the time the most prestigious academic position for a British geographer. In 1892, he was the first principal of University Extension College, Reading, a role he retained until he was succeeded, in 1903, by William Macbride Childs. The college became the University of Reading in 1926, a progression that owed no small debt to his early stewardship of the institution. In 1893, he was one of the founders of the Geographical Association, which promotes the teaching of geography in schools. He later became chairman of the GA from 1913 to 1946 and served as its President from 1916 to 1917.

In 1895, he was one of the founders of the London School of Economics. At Oxford, Mackinder was the driving force behind the creation of a School of Geography in 1899. In the same year, he led an expedition of the first Europeans to climb Mount Kenya. It was during this expedition that eight of his African porters were killed; it is disputed as to who killed them, as both Mackinder and another man, Edward Saunders were recorded issuing death threats. In 1902, he published &quot;Britain and the British Seas&quot;, which included the first comprehensive geomorphology of the British Isles and which became a classic in regional geography. He was a member of the Coefficients dining club, set up in 1902 by the Fabian campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb, which brought together social reformers and advocates of national efficiency.

In 1904, Mackinder gave a paper on &quot;The Geographical Pivot of History&quot; at the Royal Geographical Society, in which he formulated the Heartland Theory. This is often considered as a, if not the, founding moment of geopolitics as a field of study, although Mackinder did not use the term. Whilst the Heartland Theory initially received little attention outside geography, this theory would later exercise some influence on the foreign policies of world powers. Possibly disappointed at not getting a full chair, Mackinder left Oxford and became director of the London School of Economics in the same year. After 1908, he concentrated on advocating the cause of imperial unity and lectured only part-time. He stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal Unionist in a by-election for Hawick Burghs in 1909. He was elected to Parliament in January 1910 as Liberal Unionist member for the Glasgow Camlachie constituency and was defeated in 1922 as a Unionist. He was knighted in the 1920 New Year Honours for his services as an MP.

His next major work, &quot;Democratic Ideals and Reality: A Study in the Politics of Reconstruction&quot;, appeared in 1919. It followed the 1904 book titled &quot;The Geographic Pivot of the History&quot;, and presented his theory of the Heartland and made a case for fully taking into account geopolitical factors at the Paris Peace conference and contrasted (geographical) reality with Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s idealism. The book&#x27;s most famous quote was: &quot;Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; Who rules the Heartland commands the World Island; Who rules the World Island commands the World.&quot; This message was composed to convince the world statesmen at the Paris Peace conference of the crucial importance of Eastern Europe as the strategic route to the Heartland was interpreted as requiring a strip of buffer states to separate Germany and Russia. These were created by the peace negotiators but proved to be ineffective bulwarks in 1939 (although this may be seen as a failure of other, later statesmen during the interbellum). The principal concern of his work was to warn of the possibility of another major war (a warning also given by economist John Maynard Keynes).

Mackinder was anti-Bolshevik, and as British High Commissioner in Southern Russia in late 1919 and early 1920, during the Russian Civil War, he stressed the need for Britain to continue her support to the White Russian forces, which he attempted to unite. Mackinder&#x27;s last major work was the 1943 article, &quot;The Round World and the Winning of the Peace&quot;, in which he envisioned a post-war world. He reiterated and expanded his Heartland view of the world, suggesting that the Atlantic Ocean would be jumped, with North America&#x27;s influence pulled into the region by its use of Britain as a &quot;moated aerodrome&quot;. Elsewhere in the world, beyond the &quot;girdle of deserts and wilderness&quot;, and the &quot;Great Ocean&quot; region of the Indo-Pacific Rim, was the &quot;Monsoon lands&quot; area of India and China that would grow in power.

Mackinder was contemporary of the Swedish political scientist Rudolf Kjellén, born three years later, who like Mackinder was a conservative member of the national parliament from 1910 until 1922 (year of his death). The two fathers of geopolitics both believed that the development of international transportation on land was growing to such a high rate &quot;that the advantage of the sea powers was more of historical importance. Hence, they argued that the pivot of the global political power was the land control of Eurasia while a naval powersuch as the Great Britainwas playing a secondary role. They disagreed about Mackinder&#x27;s emphasis on serving the British Empire.

==Significance==
Mackinder&#x27;s work paved the way for the establishment of geography as a distinct discipline in the United Kingdom. His role in fostering the teaching of geography is probably greater than that of any other single British geographer.

Whilst Oxford did not appoint a statutory Professor of Geography until 1932, both the University of Liverpool and University of Wales, Aberystwyth established professorial chairs in Geography in 1917. Mackinder himself became Professor of Geography at the University of London (London School of Economics) in 1923.

Mackinder is often credited with introducing two new terms into the English language: &quot;manpower&quot; and &quot;heartland&quot;. In 1944, he received the Charles P. Daley medal from the American Geographical Society, and in 1945 was awarded the Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Patron&#x27;s Medal for his service in the advancement of the science of Geography. Mackinder&#x27;s work was an influence on Karl Haushofer, for which Mackinder was maligned after World War II.

The Heartland Theory and more generally classical geopolitics and geostrategy were extremely influential in the making of US strategic policy during the period of the Cold War. Arguably it continued afterwards. The theory has seen a revival in application to China&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative. On China, Mackinder predicted in 1904 that it may become the greatest threat &quot;to the world&#x27;s freedom&quot; because of it &quot;would add an oceanic frontage to the resources of the great continent.&quot;

Evidence of Mackinder&#x27;s Heartland Theory can be found in the works of geopolitician Dimitri Kitsikis, particularly in his geopolitical model &quot;Intermediate Region&quot;. 
In the book &quot;Sri Lanka at Crossroads,&quot; Asanga Abeyagoonasekera revisits Mackinder&#x27;s 1904 Map while highlighting the geostrategic importance of Sri Lanka. Reviewing the work, Swaran Singh writes, &quot;Asanga talks of Mackinder&#x27;s &#x27;outer crescent&#x27; that makes him see two other nations, Britain and Japan, being similarly ordained. However, as world drifts from continents to Oceans following Mahanian axioms, it leaves only Sri Lanka that sits in the midst of global east-west super expressway of sea lanes of communications connecting the two ends of the Indo-Pacific geopolitical paradigm.&quot;. His ideas experienced a revival of interest in post-Cold War former-Soviet Central Asia, in particular the republics of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.

<text>Rich Kids on LSD (RKL) is a Californian hardcore punk band formed in 1982 in Montecito, California, a suburb of Santa Barbara. They were associated with the &quot;Nardcore&quot; scene of West Coast hardcore that evolved out of nearby Oxnard. Their music expanded over the years from Nardcore to a mixture of hardcore infused with rock and metal elements. This style, along with touring, made them very popular on the European scene, especially among skaters in the 1980s and 1990s. Guitarist Chris Rest was the band&#x27;s only consistent member.

==History==
===Formative years===
The initial members of RKL got together at an early age. Chris Rest and Bomer Manzullo (sometimes credited as &#x27;Bomber&#x27;) were playing together and had asked Joey Cape to join as a second guitarist. Cape told them he would only join if Jason Sears could be the singer. Rest knew Sears from elementary school and youth soccer. Cape was frequently unavailable due to being grounded much of the time, so he was eventually left out of the band. RKL began playing shows around the area with myriad changes at second guitar and bass positions. In the end, Allen &#x27;Alpo&#x27; Duncan joined as second guitarist and Vincent Peppars joined as bassist. Rest has said, &quot;Bomer soon started writing the majority of the music.&quot;

====Band name and logo origin====
The group&#x27;s name came about as a mere fluke from some light hearted criticism. According to vocalist Jason Sears in a 2002 interview with &quot;Thrasher&quot; magazine: “it happened that some guy said, &#x27;ha, those kids will never be anything, they&#x27;re just a bunch of rich kids on LSD, man.&#x27; The first party we played we didn&#x27;t have a name for the band, so we put that one on the flier and it just stuck.” The beanie boy logo was born one night while Bomer and Jason were being tattooed. Bomer was attempting to draw a dragon pattern. On seeing the drawing, Jason commented, &quot;Yeah dude, it&#x27;s Cecil! Where&#x27;s Beanie?&quot; Dan Sites was sitting alongside drawing a flyer for a show supporting Suicidal Tendencies in Oxnard and drew a beanie guy jumping from a building. Beanie boy was born.

===Signing with Mystic Records===
Though not actually from the Oxnard area, RKL was still considered part of the Nardcore punk movement from Oxnard, California due to their close proximity to Oxnard and hardcore style. RKL recorded &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Feeling&quot; EP on Mystic Records, released in 1984. It is a 7-song release that included concert mainstays &quot;Why&quot;, &quot;Tell Me The Truth&quot;, and &quot;Beautiful Feeling&quot;. Outside the studio while waiting for the rest of his bandmates to arrive, Bomer had a skateboarding accident that looked to be a broken wrist. Doug Moody, owner and operator of Mystic Records, duct taped his wrist then taped the drumstick to his hand so he could complete the session. All the artwork for the EP was done by Dan Sites marking the first official appearance of the popular &quot;beanie boy&quot; character, which would remain an icon for RKL for their entire career. RKL would play around California, and particularly enjoyed the scene in San Francisco, driving 6 hours to play shows and drive back. Eventually they decided to move there, minus Alpo. He did not wish to leave Santa Barbara. His position would remain empty for some time. After about five months Vince Peppars wanted to move back to Santa Barbara. Sears said:&quot;...so we hooked up with Barry to cover for him. Then Vince came back and Barry went to guitar&quot;. This marked the entrance of Barry &#x27;D&#x27;live&#x27; Ward to the fold. During this time RKL contributed various songs to a number of Mystic compilations. In 1985 the band soon recorded and released their first full-length LP, &quot;Keep Laughing&quot; on Mystic Records with Dan Sites once again providing artwork. This release included classic RKL tracks &quot;Think Positive&quot;(often played live as &quot;Drink Positive&quot;), &quot;Ded Teds&quot;, and &quot;Pothead&quot; and has been named as one of the best skate punk records of all time. Ward, however, was not part of this recording. Ward said: &quot;[RKL] moved back to Santa Barbara and I stayed in San Francisco until they came back after Keep Laughing was recorded.&quot; Following the release RKL toured and polished their live act. Things were not good between the band and Mystic Records. The deal the band signed was that they would be a paid a percentage of sales in merchandise. There is contention whether Mystic came through on that agreement. Doug Moody has stated Mystic fulfilled their end of the agreement while Ward has stated not only did they not receive much of anything in merchandise, the band had to eventually resort to bootlegging their own tapes and screening their own shirts to sell at shows. Ward was quoted as saying, &quot;We were fucking broke, starving, dumpster diving for food, barely making gas money, and we kept going because that’s what we did. Doug Moody can say he financed the tours and paid us in merch but that’s completely untrue.&quot; Rest has also stated the band never received any money from Mystic.

===&quot;Rock &#x27;n Roll Nightmare&quot;===
Due to the increasingly acrimonious situation between the band and Mystic Records and a luckless 1986 tour (dubbed the &quot;Disastour&quot; by the band), RKL was looking for a new home and found one with the independent Alchemy Records. They were also gearing up to take their sound to the next level. Bomer was the driving force and creative head of the band. Rest said: &quot;He played so fast and tight that we were all forced to do the same. He was a perfectionist and expected the same from us.&quot; Vince Peppars would depart around this time. According to Bomer, he didn&#x27;t like the direction of the new material and preferred the earlier rawer sound. Their next album, &quot;Rock &#x27;n Roll Nightmare&quot; (also known as &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich Kids on LSD - A Rock N Roll Nightmare&quot;) stayed true to the fast tempo and hardcore sound the band was known for, but introduced elements of progressive rock and thrash metal to their sound as well as a technical musicianship that was very uncommon for the punk genre at the time. &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; called it &quot;Very strong&quot; in their review of the album. About their sound, Bomer said: &quot;People say that we have a metal influence, but really, all our licks are pretty much rhythm and blues based, but it&#x27;s super fast! So instead of saying it&#x27;s metal, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s just super fast rock and roll.&quot; They still did not have a bass player for the sessions. Previously, Ricky Bowersock had succeeded Peppars, but the band had soured on him and the spot was vacated. Bowersock appeared as &#x27;Rikkity Borrow A Sock&#x27; under a &quot;Special No Thanks&quot; part of the liner notes of the next album, along with Doug Moody. Subsequently, Bomer ended up playing both drums and bass on the recording. Mark Deutrom, producer of the album, says &quot;Bomer tracking all the drum parts in a row without a scratch track is one of the more impressive things I’ve seen in a studio.&quot; Regarding the album Fat Mike of NOFX and owner/founder of Fat Wreck Chords, is quoted as saying this in 2007:

Andrew Kiraly, writing for the &quot;Las Vegas Mercury&quot;, comedically gave this album the award &quot;Best Album of 1987 I Found While Digging in My Desk Which I&#x27;m Surprised Hasn&#x27;t Been &#x27;Rediscovered&#x27; By Critics and Hailed Anew As a Masterpiece, or Maybe I&#x27;m Just Feeling Stupid and Nostalgic&quot;.

====New bass player====
After auditioning at least a dozen potential bass players, they finally found Joe Raposo through an advertisement in &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot;. An audition was set up for Raposo by a friend. Raposo became the bass player for RKL in time for touring support of RocK &#x27;n Roll Nightmare. In 1988, RKL toured Europe in support of the new album where it was particularly well received. A live album was recorded in West Berlin at Quartier Latin (now Wintergarten Varieté) on July 9, 1988. It was entitled &quot;Greatest Hits Double Live&quot; and released on Destiny Records. It was the first RKL album on CD in addition to the common vinyl and cassette formats. The artwork of the album is a collection of blotter acid paper of varying size, image, and age contributed by Mark McCloud, famous for his extensive collection which he calls the &quot;Institute of Illegal Images&quot;. Due to Raposo&#x27;s status as a minor (he was only seventeen), his parents, though less than enthusiastic, gave permission for him to leave the country. Ward was named temporary guardian for the European tour. The signed guardianship papers are included in the &quot;Greatest Hits Double Live&quot; artwork.

RKL also sold their Mystic-era material to Destiny without Mystic Records&#x27; permission. Destiny proceeded to release a compilation album of Mystic recordings and called it &quot;Revenge is a Beautiful Feeling&quot; in reference to their perceived mistreatment by Mystic Records. The cover also featured a caricature of Doug Moody with his neck being twisted up by the same monster character that appeared on the cover of RKL&#x27;s previous release, &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Feeling&quot;.

Through it all, RKL mainly played in Europe and California. There was no official US tour to back the &quot;Rock &#x27;n Roll Nightmare&quot; album. Victor Hayden was in charge of the business side of Alchemy records. About Alchemy&#x27;s promotion of &quot;Rock &#x27;n Roll Nightmare&quot;, Sears said: &quot;[Advertisements in] &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; and &quot;Flipside&quot; was about as far as it got. And we didn&#x27;t have our own ad, it was sort of a Mystic deal where you had every band on the label listed as new albums... And in our payment they took out some for promotion, saying that [Victor Hayden] sent posters to all the stores, and put ads in all kinds of magazines. There was those two ads, and no one&#x27;s ever seen a poster.&quot;

===First break-up===
In 1989 RKL called it quits for the first time. Commenting about this break-up, Fat Mike said, &quot;the wheels started falling off the RKL train. The drug abuse and constant partying was taking its toll.&quot; Regarding the break, Ward had this to say: &quot;Ultimately, it was the frustration with deals like [the Mystic records situation] and Alchemy later that broke up the band the first time. Had our business sense been there in the beginning and things gone right, I think Bomer wouldn’t have wanted to bag it. He broke up the band ... &#x27;cause he thought punk rock was going nowhere&quot;. Raposo said: &quot;If I could change one thing, I would have never let RKL break up the first time in 1989. I would have fought that to the death and would have never let it happen.&quot; Rest agreed, stating: &quot;We broke up at the worst time we could have.&quot;

===Epitaph years===
====Slang, &quot;Reactivate&quot;====
Bomer formed a new band called Slang after the dissolution of RKL. Slang eventually included his old RKL bandmates with the notable exception of Jason Sears. Their sound was much different than the previous incarnation, dropping the fast hardcore style for a distinct rock/funk fusion. Slang had Bomer on lead vocals while newcomer Dave Raun played drums, Joe Raposo played bass, with Chris Rest and Joel Monte Mahan on guitars. Though Fat Mike had stated during an interview in &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; that he was going to put out a Slang record on his then new record label Fat Wreck Chords, Slang ended up signing with Epitaph Records in 1992 and an album was recorded soon after. At some point during this time Ward replaced Mahan. Just prior to its release in 1993, it was decided by Bomer and Epitaph owner/operator Brett Gurewitz it would be released as an RKL album under the title &quot;Reactivate&quot; to capitalize on the RKL name and built-in fanbase. Dan Sites again provided artwork. Before the album&#x27;s release Slang, now RKL, headed on tour to Europe. The fans in Europe were not aware of the drastic sound change as the album had not yet been released. Many were disillusioned. Bomer wanted to quit early in the tour due to fan reaction. During the tour long-time friend and band roadie Will Knutilla died of a drug overdose in Zürich. Following this tragedy, Bomer quit in Italy. Jason Sears was flown into Barcelona to re-join RKL and to attempt to complete the tour playing their pre-&quot;Reactivate&quot; songs. Regarding this period, Ward said, &quot;That &quot;Reactivate&quot; record hurt RKL more than anything, more than Mystic Records.&quot; Epitaph also re-released RKL&#x27;s previous full-length album &quot;RocK &#x27;n Roll Nightmare&quot; in 1993.

====&quot;Riches to Rags&quot; and break-up====
RKL pressed on without original member Bomer. They recorded a new album at the Music Annex in 1994 with completely new material. The resultant album &quot;Riches to Rags&quot; would be released in early 1995 and dedicated to Will Knutilla. The name was a sarcastic self-deprecating spoof on their previous &#x27;Lifestyles&#x27; persona. For perhaps the first time in their history, RKL finally had a large amount of support from an experienced and highly successful independent label, Epitaph Records. The band had the song &quot;We&#x27;re Back We&#x27;re Pissed&quot; appear on Epitaph&#x27;s first of a long running compilation series called &quot;Punk-O-Rama&quot;. The song &quot;Betrayed&quot; also appeared on the February 1995 sample CD of the magazine &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot;. RKL&#x27;s first music video was created featuring the song &quot;Betrayed&quot; and directed by Isaac Camner. Around this time they were also featured on the national tabloid news television show Hard Copy in a piece about LSD. RKL toured the world supporting &quot;Riches to Rags&quot;, including most parts of Europe and Japan. However, tensions within the band caused RKL to once again go their separate ways. Ward put together the entire &quot;Still Flailing After All These Beers RKL&quot; video which released on VHS through Epitaph Records. The video contained rare live footage and home videos from RKL&#x27;s time on the road, an exclusive &quot;Take Me Home&quot; music video directed by Ward, and a cover of Devo&#x27;s &quot;Timing X&quot;.

==First Reunion==
In 1999 RKL reformed briefly to play a single show at a mutual friends funeral but nothing further came of it. In 2000, RKL were invited by the city of Santa Barbara, California to play at the opening of the Skaters Point Skateboard Park. Original members Jason Sears and Chris Rest reunited, along with three mutual friends (including Derrick Plourde on drums) to fill out the remaining positions. They played to approximately 2,000 people. Sears said, &quot;...after the first note the place went haywire, me and Chris looked at each other and were all &#x27;YES&#x27;, and ever since that day we knew we had to get this back together.&quot; Along with Plourde on drums, they eventually added Chris Flippin on guitar and a returning Bomer Manzullo on bass. This line-up played sporadic shows around the West Coast for the next few years, including the San Francisco Warped Tour in 2002. Around 2002 Bomer left again and Joe Raposo returned on bass. The same year Boz Rivera replaced Derrick Plourde. RKL was starting to write and record new songs during this time. However, by November 2005 it was decided to stop the band. Flippen has said &quot;it was because the singer was self-destructive. It kind of sucked Derrick [Plourde] in too. I think that band is cursed.&quot; The new songs were eventually included as bonus tracks on the re-issued &quot;Greatest Hits - Live In West Berlin 1988&quot; released in 2011 on Destiny Records. An unreleased track from more recent demo recordings entitled &quot;Twisting and Turning&quot; was included on a 2 CD compilation album &quot;Sick Slabs of Sonic Sound from the Slaboratory&quot; released December 17, 2013.

==Second Reunion==
In January 2024, RKL announced a return with four of the members from the Riches to Rags (Chris Rest, Barry Ward, Joe Raposo, Dave Raun) recording and touring with Tony Foresta from Municipal Waste on vocals. So far they have released a newly recorded version of “Lies” with the new lineup on Ward&#x27;s YouTube channel.

==Band members&#x27; deaths==
On March 30, 2005, Derrick Plourde, former drummer of RKL, who also played in Lagwagon, Mad Caddies, Bad Astronaut, Jaws, and The Ataris, committed suicide. Lagwagon paid tribute to Derrick with their 2005 release of the album &quot;Resolve&quot;. Bad Astronaut also paid tribute to Plourde, as well as Manzullo and Sears, with the song Stillwater, California, off of their album Twelve Small Steps, One Giant Disappointment.

On December 12, 2005, original member Richard Anthony Manzullo (aka &quot;Bomer&quot;) died due to heart failure at his home in Summerland, California. The cause of death was the result of a long time battle with drug addictions.

On January 31, 2006, Jason Sears died due to complications while undergoing a detox treatment involving ibogaine in Tijuana, Mexico. The cause of death was the result of a pulmonary embolism caused by thrombosis.

==After RKL==
In 1996 Bomer Manzullo and Chris Rest formed a band called The Other with future Mad Caddies drummer Boz Rivera. Bomer performed vocals and played bass. This group produced one self-titled album in 1997 on Honest Don&#x27;s Records, a subsidiary label set up by Fat Wreck Chords to release material by bands that didn&#x27;t fit within the roster at Fat. Rivera would later go on to join a reunited RKL.

Barry &#x27;D&#x27;live&#x27; Ward released a solo album in 1990 on RRRecords titled &quot;Homely All American Songs &amp; Stories For Mutant Space Dweebs From Planet Hell&quot;. He performed briefly in Gwar as Balsac the Jaws of Death, filling in for Mike Derks during Gwar&#x27;s 1991 European tour. He was the guitarist for the death metal parody band Embryo Killers, releasing one self-titled album in 1993. He also played guitar for Me First and the Gimme Gimmes on their 1996 tour. Ward is the lead vocalist and guitarist for San Francisco Bay Area&#x27;s Crosstops, who have released three full-length albums. Both Ward and Chris Rest played guitar on the album &quot;Lickety Split&quot; by the band Hotbox. Along with being a musician, he has also directed music videos for bands, including NOFX, Terrorgruppe, and Don Cikuta and works with Grumblefish Movies. Ward put together the entire &quot;Still Flailing After All These Beers&quot; RKL video. In 2018, Ward toured with MDC. In 2019, Ward toured with Scheisse Minnelli.

Dave Raun went on the replace future RKL member Derrick Plourde as the drummer in Lagwagon. He is also the drummer for Me First and the Gimme Gimmes and had stints as drummer in Good Riddance in 1999, Pulley in 2002, and Hot Water Music in 2009. He recorded drums for Japanese band Mr. Orange on their album &quot;Radiostaticactivity&quot; released in 2000. He also has a side project contributing lead vocals and drums in a band called District of Columbias which released an EP on Japanese label Inyaface Records in 2009 entitled &quot;We Barely Just Got Here&quot;. Chris Rest was also part of this project.

Chris Rest, Joe Raposo, and Boz Rivera are members of the San Francisco–based group King City.

Chris Rest contributed his guitar on Mad Caddies 2001 release &quot;Rock the Plank&quot;, as well as The Real McKenzies 2008 release &quot;Off the Leash&quot;. He has also been a member Lagwagon since 1997 having replaced Ken Stringfellow. Additionally, he joined No Use For A Name in 2009 replacing Dave Nassie and remained a member until their final show following the death of lead singer Tony Sly in 2012.

Joe Raposo played bass guitar on two album releases by The Real McKenzies; their 2005 album &quot;10,000 Shots&quot;, and their 2008 album &quot;Off the Leash&quot;. He has also played with the Dwarves. In an interview with fasterlouder.com.au Joey Cape, lead singer of Lagwagon, stated that Joe Raposo is Lagwagon&#x27;s new bassist. In a June 2011 interview with ExploreMusic however, Joey Cape said that things didn&#x27;t work out with Raposo, and the band is testing a new bassist. After first announcing Patrick Solem as the new bass player in August 2011, Lagwagon decided that Raposo will remain a member after all in October 2011. , Raposo also works for Zynga as the quality assurance lead for their casual social city-building simulation game CityVille.

Vocalist Jason Sears contributed lyrics and vocals for a song called &quot;Until Next Time&quot; on Snot&#x27;s album entitled &quot;Strait Up&quot; in tribute to their late lead singer Lynn Strait. It was released on November 7, 2000. The album also features appearances by the lead vocalists of a number of major rock groups. Lynn Strait was a long-time friend of the band and his name can be viewed in the liner notes &quot;Special Thanks&quot; section of RKL&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Rock N Roll Nightmare&quot;. Jason Sears recorded an album with the San Diego–based band Mercury Legion originally released with the title &quot;Jason Sears and Mercury Legion: It Happened on a Friday Night - The Original Soundtrack Album&quot; on Dolphin Records. It was then repackaged and re-released as a self-titled effort; simply &quot;Jason Sears &amp; Mercury Legion&quot; on Malt Soda Recordings.

==Legacy==
RKL was influential on the punk rock scene. Regarding RKL&#x27;s impact on punk music, Fat Mike had this to say: &quot;When we first started, we wanted to sound like RKL.&quot; &quot;Without RKL, there wouldn’t be a NOFX. Well, there might be a totally shitty NOFX... RKL was the band that we would always be in the shadow of. When they broke up, we kinda took their spot.&quot; Erik Sandin described them as &quot;[NOFX&#x27;s] musical heroes, we worked hard to imitate their sound&quot;. Lagwagon&#x27;s Joey Cape has said &quot;In many ways, I don’t think there would be a NOFX or a Lagwagon or many bands that sound like us if there hadn’t been an RKL. They had this style of music that would just rip the whole time.&quot; Dwarves vocalist Blag Dahlia said, &quot;RKL carved out a niche in the 1980s as a band that could actually play in a sea of those who could not.&quot;, and called them the &quot;standard bearers of ‘Prog-Punk’&quot;. Many people credit Bomer Manzullo as the first person to play the standard, or modern, punk beat. RKL has been credited with creating the prototype that brought success to punk rock bands that followed in the early 1990s, including The Offspring and NOFX and has been described as &quot;your favorite band&#x27;s favorite band, and in a just world, they would&#x27;ve been way bigger.&quot;

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;TimesTalks&quot; television interview discussing musicianship in punk rock, Green Day&#x27;s Billie Joe Armstrong mentioned RKL&#x27;s Bomer Manzullo as an example of the high level of talent in punk rock, calling Bomer an &quot;insane drummer&quot;, while in an interview with &quot;Communities Digital News&quot;, NOFX&#x27;s Erik Sandin said: &quot;Bomber was just out of control, he was so fucking good.&quot;

RKL, known for their live shows, once had a Goleta, California crowd in such a fervor that a club owner deployed tear gas in an attempt to stop the large mosh pit.

The three deceased members were directly referenced by NOFX in &quot;Doornails&quot;, a song from their 2006 album &quot;Wolves in Wolves&#x27; Clothing&quot;.

Foo Fighters guitarist Chris Shiflett called RKL his &quot;hometown pride punk band.&quot;

A Rich Kids on LSD tribute album was released on Malt Soda Recordings entitled &quot;For Those About To Trip&quot; which contains 23 covers of classic RKL tracks by various artists.

Strung Out&#x27;s Jake Kiley cites RKL as an personally influential band while growing up.

Actor Josh Brolin claimed in a New York Times interview to have been a member of RKL. He later gave more detail about this in a radio interview, stating &quot;Things have gotten confused in interviews and all that. And I said that I was a part of RKL, which is Rich Kids on LSD, which was a big punk band back then. And it was - I was part of the garage band that first started playing. And then they went to be known with other drummers and other musicians as RKL. And they actually became a fairly well-known punk rock band.&quot;. On the WTF with Marc Maron he said Jason Sears was his best friend and has also stated &quot;Rich Kids on LSD was the band that I helped start.&quot;

The band is referenced by Janez Detd. in &quot;My Life My Way&quot;, a song from their 2008 album &quot;For Better For Worse&quot;.

The band is referenced by The High Speed Scene in &quot;For the Kids&quot;, a song from their 2005 album &quot;The High Speed Scene&quot;.

RKL&#x27;s song &quot;Tell Me the Truth&quot; is referenced by Snot in &quot;Mr. Brett&quot;, a song from their 1997 album &quot;Get Some&quot;.

The beanie boy character appears on the cover of Annihilation Time&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Annihilation Time II&quot;.

Italian band Overdrive Bonzai dedicated a song called &quot;Jason Sears&quot; to the late vocalist.

Brazilian crossover/hardcore band Ratos de Porão was also influenced by RKL&#x27;s attitude on stage. &quot;Another thing that really opened our minds was seeing the RKL show, Rich Kids on LSD,&quot; said Ratos de Porão vocalist João Gordo. &quot;We have to be like those guys.&quot;

&quot;OC Weekly&quot; published an article entitled &quot;10 Classic Punk Bands We&#x27;d Love to See Reunite&quot;, RKL being named as one of the bands.

There were rumors of an &quot;RKLAOKE&quot; show sometime in the Summer of 2006 as a benefit concert to raise money for Sears&#x27; children Anthony, Sierra, and Cisco. The show would have featured the remaining members of the band playing all the past favorites with different members of the audience.

<text>Hannah Primrose, Countess of Rosebery (&quot;née&quot; de Rothschild; 27 July 1851 – 19 November 1890) was the daughter of Baron Mayer de Rothschild and his wife Juliana (&quot;née&quot; Cohen). After inheriting her father&#x27;s fortune in 1874, she became the richest woman in Britain. In 1878, Hannah de Rothschild married Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, and was thereafter known as the Countess of Rosebery.

During the final quarter of the 19th century, her husband, the Earl of Rosebery, was one of the most celebrated figures in Britain, an influential millionaire and politician, whose charm, wit, charisma and public popularity gave him such standing that he &quot;almost eclipsed that of Royalty&quot;. The Countess remains an enigmatic figure, and is often regarded as notable only for financing her husband&#x27;s three ambitions: to marry an heiress, win The Derby, and become Prime Minister (the second and third of these possibly apocryphal ambitions were achieved after her death).

Her marriage into the aristocracy, while controversial at the time, gave her the social cachet in an antisemitic society that her vast fortune could not. She subsequently became a political hostess and philanthropist. Her charitable work was principally in the sphere of public health and causes associated with the welfare of working-class Jewish women living in the poorer districts of London.

Having firmly assisted and supported her husband on his path, she suddenly died in 1890, aged 39.

== Early years ==

Hannah de Rothschild was born in 1851 into a world of great wealth and luxury. She was the granddaughter of Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild, who had founded N M Rothschild &amp; Sons, the English branch of the Rothschilds&#x27; banking empire. Niall Ferguson states in his &quot;History of the House of Rothschild&quot; that by the mid-19th century the Rothschilds regarded themselves as the nearest thing the Jews of Europe had to a royal family, and the equals of royalty. The many Rothschild houses and art collections, in England, Austria, France, and Germany, rivalled those of the crowned heads of Europe, Mentmore in particular being one of the most outstanding art collections of its kind anywhere in the world.

Hannah de Rothschild&#x27;s father Baron Meyer Amschel de Rothschild married his cousin Juliana Cohen in 1850. The marriage provided the impetus for Meyer to create what he described as &quot;an enduring monument&quot;, a country house of monumental proportions. His daughter Hannah, aged just five months, helped lay the foundation stone on 31 December 1851.

Within a few years of the mansion&#x27;s completion, attracted by the good hunting and proximity to London, Hannah&#x27;s relatives began to build estates nearby, all within a carriage drive of each other; thus, Hannah grew up in an almost private world of unimaginable splendour and security. Pevsner has described this enclave of Rothschild properties as &quot;the most conspicuous and significant aspect of Victorian architecture in Buckinghamshire&quot;. In addition to Mentmore, Baron and Baroness Meyer de Rothschild had a large house in London, 107 Piccadilly, and &quot;The Zenaide&quot;, a luxurious yacht, upon which Hanna&#x27;s mother died in 1877, the year before her marriage.

As an only child growing up in what were, in all but name, palaces, her childhood appears to have been lonely. She was a companion to her hypochondriac mother and, in later life, a hostess with her father during her mother&#x27;s long periods of indisposition. She was indulged by both parents and her formal education was neglected in favour of music and singing lessons, subjects in which she was &#x27;skilled&#x27; and had a &#x27;decided gift&#x27;. Her parents were very protective of her, attempting to ensure that she was never exposed to the risk of sickness or even the sight of poverty. As a result, she was never allowed to enter the cottages on the Rothschilds&#x27; estates. Lady Battersea claimed that Hannah was so sheltered that the phrase &quot;&#x27;the poor&#x27;&quot; was &quot;merely a phraseology for her&quot;. Whatever the faults of her education, she possessed great confidence, impressing her Rothschild relations, who noted her poise and competence when she hosted a large house party at Mentmore for the Prince of Wales while only 17 years of age. A year later, in 1869, Hannah made her formal entrance into society as a debutante, when she was presented to Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace by her mother.

Mayer Amschel de Rothschild died in 1874, leaving his daughter not only Mentmore (with its priceless art collection), his London mansion, and innumerable investments, but also the sum of two million pounds sterling in cash (equivalent to £ in present-day terms). Thus, Hannah de Rothschild became the wealthiest woman in England.

== Betrothal ==

Hannah de Rothschild was first introduced to her future husband, the 28-year-old Earl of Rosebery, by Lady Beaconsfield, the wife of Benjamin Disraeli, at Newmarket Racecourse. The Disraelis were close friends and neighbours of the Rothschilds in Buckinghamshire. In 1901 Rosebery, in an interview with the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, claimed to have met Hannah when their carriages crashed and he &#x27;sprang out and saved her&#x27;; however, this version of their meeting is believed to be a romanticised fabrication of Rosebery&#x27;s.

Archibald, 5th Earl of Rosebery, born in 1847, had inherited his title from his grandfather in 1868, aged 21, together with an income of £30,000 a year. He owned 40,000 acres (160 km2) in Scotland, and land in Norfolk, Hertfordshire, and Kent. His father had died when he was eight and he had been brought up by his mother, who had subsequently married Harry Powlett, 4th Duke of Cleveland. His mother was a distant figure, and their relationship was always strained. The Earls of Rosebery, whose family name was Primrose, were old, if undistinguished, members of the Scottish aristocracy. Rosebery was considered to be strikingly handsome and immensely cultivated. He was highly intelligent, and a brilliant future was forecast for him by his tutors at both Eton and Christ Church, Oxford.

As early as 1876, there were rumours of an engagement. However, several hurdles had to be overcome before a marriage could take place. While the Jewish Rothschilds were accepted into society, and indeed were close friends of some members of the royal family including the Prince of Wales, as elsewhere in Europe, antisemitic feelings were prevalent in the upper echelons of society; this was particularly so among those closest to the Queen at court where, following the death of the Prince Consort in 1861, the Rothschilds became pointedly excluded. The Queen&#x27;s equerry Arthur Edward Hardinge referred to the Rothschilds&#x27; dining tables as &quot;resplendent with the Hebrew gold&quot; going so far as to say a visiting Russian royal needed a &quot;corrective&quot; visit to Westminster Abbey following acceptance of Rothschild hospitality. Queen Victoria herself expressed antisemitic views in 1873 when it was proposed that Lionel de Rothschild be elevated to the peerage; the Queen refused, and expressed a reluctance to make a Jew a peer, saying that &quot;to make a Jew a peer is a step she could not consent to&quot; and furthermore stating that to give &quot;a title and mark of her approbation to a Jew&quot; was something she would not do. Lord Spencer advised the Prince and Princess of Wales against attending a Rothschild ball with the words &quot;The Prince ought only to visit those of undoubted position in Society.&quot; However, this did not prevent the Prince from accepting Rothschild&#x27;s invitations and gifts privately. While one could be friends with Jews and accept their hospitality, their social status was still not sufficiently elevated to include marriage into the peerage without unfavourable comment.

Rosebery&#x27;s own mother was horrified at the thought of a Jewish woman, even a Rothschild, in the family. Rosebery too felt there was an impassable barrier of faith. This factor also worked in reverse; while Hannah de Rothschild was keen to marry Rosebery, she was also aware of many obstacles, the foremost being that she was devoted to her faith, and to leave it would be a severe moral wrench. Another obstacle was the Rothschild family itself: it was their custom to marry cousins to keep their fortune within the family. Ironically, Hannah herself had opposed the marriage of her cousin Annie de Rothschild to the Christian Eliot Constantine Yorke, the son of the Earl of Hardwicke, in 1866. In fact, she was to be the third daughter of the family&#x27;s English branch to marry outside of the Jewish faith, but such was the fame of the bridegroom and the resultant publicity that the Jewish elders and press felt an example needed to be made. The &quot;Jewish Chronicle&quot; announced its &quot;most poignant grief&quot; at the prospect, and cryptically added, &quot;If the flame seize on the cedars, how will fare the hyssop on the wall: if the leviathan is brought up with a hook, how will the minnows escape,&quot;

The formal engagement of marriage was announced on 3 January 1878, a day Rosebery forever afterwards regarded as sacred. Writing to a friend in January 1878, Rosebery described his wife as &quot;very simple, very unspoilt, very clever, very warm-hearted and very shy... I never knew such a beautiful character.&quot; The marriage was celebrated in London on 20 March 1878 at the Board Room of Guardians in Mount Street, and also in a Christian ceremony at Christ Church in Down Street, Piccadilly. To show &quot;official&quot; disapproval, no male member of the Rothschild family attended the ceremonies.

== Marriage ==

For the first few years following their marriage, the Roseberys resided in London in the Piccadilly house Lady Rosebery had inherited from her father. As the couple&#x27;s social and political interests increased from 1882, they leased the larger Lansdowne House. Lansdowne House was one of the finest of the aristocratic palaces in London, well suited to be the home of the political salon which Hannah Rosebery was to establish. Here political and social leaders of the day mixed with royalty, authors such as Henry James and Oscar Wilde, and other prominent social and intellectual figures of the time. Henry James, an occasional guest in the Roseberys&#x27; homes, delivered one of the most unflattering condemnations of Lady Rosebery describing her as &quot;... large, coarse, Hebrew-looking with hair of no particular colour and personally unattractive&quot;.

The Roseberys divided their year among their various homes: London for the social season and parliament, Mentmore at weekends to entertain both political and shooting house-parties. In August the household would move north to Dalmeny for the grouse shooting. In between, occasional days and the weeklong Derby meeting would be spent at their home &quot;The Durdans&quot; in Epsom. Though small by comparison to their other homes, this mansion was described by Henry James as the most homely and comfortable of the Roseberys&#x27; many homes and as a delightful house full of books and sporting pictures, with just a few Gainsboroughs and Watteaux.

=== Relationship with Rosebery ===
Published commentators on the Roseberys claim their marriage was happy, and there is no known evidence that Hannah was anything other than happy in her marriage, and quite a lot to suggest she was indeed blissfully happy. However, much evidence suggests that Rosebery, while professing to be happy, was at times irritated and bored by Hannah, who was always keen to accommodate his every whim.

There were times when Lady Rosebery&#x27;s devotion to her husband was tested. Rosebery may have not been antisemitic before his marriage; however, the acerbic wit for which he was famous led him to make remarks that could have been taken in such a way, once his marriage had secured the Rothschild fortune. Rosebery seems to have disliked his first son, who he claimed looked &quot;Jewish.&quot; On seeing his son for the first time he remarked &quot;&quot;Le Jew est fait, rien ne vas plus&quot;,&quot; which must have been disconcerting for the child&#x27;s Jewish mother. Rosebery, who has been described as febrile and supercilious, replied in a letter of congratulations on the birth of his heir from Mary Gladstone: &quot;I cannot pretend to be much excited by an event which occurs to almost every human being and which may cause me a great deal of annoyance.&quot; Rosebery then left his newborn child and wife (who was again pregnant) for a year-long tour of Australia. On another occasion, when the Roseberys were travelling in India, Rosebery is reported to have announced &quot;I will travel ahead, Hannah and the rest of the heavy baggage will follow the next day.&quot;

While the marriage was based on warmth and esteem on Rosebery&#x27;s side and adoration on Hannah&#x27;s, it seems that Rosebery often found his wife&#x27;s devotion irritating, and this sometimes caused him to be impatient with her. He was often abrupt with her in public. She, by contrast, was completely enraptured by him, and would frequently ignore her neighbours at a dinner party to listen to her husband&#x27;s conversation further down the table, a faux pas almost considered a crime in Victorian society. Those who saw the couple alone at home &quot;could not doubt the affection as well as the comprehension that united them&quot;.

Rosebery&#x27;s behaviour could be eccentric. Gladstone remarked that Rosebery was, perhaps, rather too concerned with his health. Early in the marriage Rosebery decided to renovate the small ruined Barnbougle Castle (the original Rosebery family seat), close to, and within sight of, Dalmeny House. Once renovation was complete in 1882, Rosebery used it as a private retreat from his family, and began to spend his nights there alone. Always an insomniac, he claimed that the &quot;stillness of the waters&quot; [the nearby Firth of Forth] &quot;were conducive to sleep&quot;.
During their marriage the Roseberys travelled extensively, usually without their children. In September 1883, the couple left their children in the care of the nannies and nursery maids, supervised by Rosebery&#x27;s sister Lady Leconfield, for a long tour of America and Australia. Lady Rosebery owned large investments in North America, including ranches in Texas and mines in Montana. Their arrival in New York was widely reported, and a full and flattering description of Lady Rosebery was reported in &quot;The Herald&quot;. The newspaper went on to describe Rosebery as looking like a prosperous farmer. Lady Rosebery was very taken with California, from where she wrote: &quot;The inhabitants are very entertaining ... the women are very handsome, think nothing of dresses costing £80, &quot;fix up&quot; their faces very frequently and are generally divorced.&quot;

Rosebery&#x27;s frequent absences from his wife fuelled gossip that he was a secret homosexual. It has been claimed that the inscrutable air that Rosebery wore was a mask to disguise his secret homosexual life. The worry of this illegal secret, it was claimed, and fear of exposure, caused his insomnia and bouts of depression. It was even whispered that his Barnbougle Castle retreat was really a venue for clandestine assignations with young men. Rosebery&#x27;s possible homosexuality has been much discussed in recent times. Nothing conclusive has ever been found one way or the other, but it is possible that he had homosexual experiences while in the care of a paedophile housemaster at Eton in his youth. No evidence exists that his wife was aware of these rumours against her husband, or even that she would have understood them, bearing in mind her sheltered upbringing and limited education. Sex education was not part of a 19th-century upper-class girl&#x27;s schooling.

The relationship between the couple appears at times to have been almost that of a mother and child. Rosebery, a self-centred, reserved man, prone to depression, pessimism and insecurity, had a difficult relationship with his mother, who had been distant and openly preferred his younger brother. Lady Rosebery, an orphan and only child, appears to have been desperate to lavish affection. Once upon entering a book shop she told her children they were entering a toy shop, and when the disappointed children pointed out the obvious she replied &quot;to your father this is a toy shop.&quot; Lord Rosebery&#x27;s friend Edward Hamilton recorded her &quot;notable faculty of getting other people to work and quickening their energies&quot;. It seems she was the driving force of the relationship, with her feet firmly on the ground. She made herself the link between the world and her &quot;thin skinned and neurotic&quot; husband.

=== Children ===

The marriage produced four children: Lady Sybil Primrose, born in 1879; Lady Margaret Primrose, born in 1881; the heir Harry Primrose, Lord Dalmeny (later 6th Earl of Rosebery), born in 1882; and finally the Honourable Neil Primrose, born the same year as his elder brother.

== Politics ==

It has been said of Hannah de Rothschild that she grew up with a good sense and presence of mind, enabling her to deputise for her mother on grand social occasions at Mentmore and in London. This gave her confidence and the experience to be the perfect political wife. Marriage to her altered Rosebery&#x27;s status, too: while his wife acquired Christian respectability and a title, Rosebery moved from being one of many wealthy and capable young noblemen to being one with unfathomable riches. This, coupled with his good looks, appealed to the public&#x27;s imagination and gave him glamour.

From the outset of the marriage, political members of the Rothschild family took an interest in Rosebery, and he was soon acclaimed as one of the rising hopes of the Liberal Party. As a hereditary peer, he already had a seat in the House of Lords and had made his maiden speech there on attaining his majority. But brilliant as he was, Rosebery tended to lethargy and boredom. Lord Granville in fact considered Rosebery&#x27;s wife to be the more ambitious of the pair, and even advised her &quot;If you keep him up to the mark, [he] is sure to have his page in history.&quot; The subtle driving of her often languid and lethargic husband to achieve his &quot;page in history&quot; was to become her &quot;&quot;. Rosebery&#x27;s secretary Thomas Gilmour noted: &quot;She is thoroughly genuine and very tender and devoted to Lord Rosebery, it is easy to see that she is very proud of him, and she is a woman of considerable force of character and great energy, she may prove to be a powerful ally in his political career.&quot;

Rosebery was not a natural politician. He was an idealist who disliked the rancour of politics, in fact &quot;his innate dislike of politics was something Lady Rosebery always fought against.&quot; However, he was a gifted orator, and this was an era when platform speaking was beginning to replace House of Commons debate.

===Midlothian campaign===
This first became evident in the great campaign to re-elect Gladstone, culminating in the 1880 general election. Known today as the Midlothian campaign, it was masterminded by the Roseberys. Rosebery used his influence to have Gladstone invited to stand as parliamentary candidate for Midlothian, near to Rosebery&#x27;s Dalmeny estate. Gladstone had nominally retired from politics after losing his Greenwich seat in 1874, when Disraeli had been swept to power. The campaign was based at Dalmeny where Lady Rosebery hosted a series of large political house parties throughout the long campaign. The Tories were later to claim that Rosebery had paid for Gladstone&#x27;s campaign. Rosebery later admitted to spending £50,000.

The Roseberys&#x27; house party would leave Dalmeny and tour towns and cities across Midlothian and Scotland, with Gladstone and the speakers often addressing vast crowds from the back of an American-designed Pullman car specially acquired by Rosebery for the purpose. The scenes at these meetings have been described as something between a carnival and an evangelist&#x27;s revival meeting. While in the grounds of Dalmeny House itself, the public were treated to a great firework display.

Throughout all this, Gladstone was supported not only by the popular and charismatic Rosebery but also by an array of well-dressed women including Lady Rosebery and Gladstone&#x27;s daughter Mary. These fashionable people – the celebrities of their day (newspapers at the time gave many column inches each day to the doings of the upper classes) – were as much a crowd-puller as the political speakers, and Rosebery&#x27;s planning used that to full effect. One meeting was so packed that many were fainting: 70,000 people applied for tickets in a hall capable of holding 6,500. Lady Rosebery reported, &quot;I had never heard Archie (Lord Rosebery) speak in public politically before, but after the first minute I felt I could never be nervous at his making a speech the audience show him great affection.&quot; [sic] However it was not just Gladstone and Rosebery the huge crowds had come to see, but also the dutifully supporting and smiling families. Lady Rosebery went on to describe how &quot;They (the crowds) patted me on the back till my shoulders were sensitive.&quot; Thus in Rosebery&#x27;s first serious involvement in politics, Disraeli was defeated and the newly elected MP for Midlothian became Prime Minister for the second time (the caretaker liberal leader Lord Hartington retired in favour of Gladstone). It was also obvious that Lady Rosebery was a very evident and valuable political electioneering asset. As the Marquess of Crewe put it &quot;she had cut her spurs&quot;.

===Gladstone&#x27;s second government (1880–1885)===

Her political mettle and ambitions for her husband were however to be more severely tested in Gladstone&#x27;s second government following the Liberal victory. Rosebery was, as expected, offered a position in Government by Gladstone. It had been rumoured that the position of Viceroy of Ireland or a cabinet place would be proffered, but it turned out to be the job of Under Secretary of the India Office. Rosebery immediately declined the post, giving as his reason that it would appear that he was being repaid for running Gladstone&#x27;s campaign (as though the Viceregal position would not). When pressed further he cited ill health—he had been suffering from scarlet fever during the Midlothian campaign and now also appeared to be suffering a minor nervous breakdown. Political leaders urged Lady Rosebery to influence him, but she defended his decision, while stressing that his deterioration in health was only temporary. She had to be careful—if it appeared her husband had declined the offer on the grounds that it was too lowly, it would give substance to the claims being made that he was conceited and petulant. Whatever the truth, and it may be Rosebery&#x27;s own explanation that he &quot;disliked hard work&quot;, Lady Rosebery continued to solicit Gladstone for a job for Rosebery within the cabinet. In August 1880, when Gladstone told her firmly that &quot;There is nothing I can give him,&quot; she claimed she had not been seeking a cabinet post and Gladstone had misunderstood her. At the same time she was canny enough to mention that Sir William Harcourt and Sir Charles Dilke, both radicals opposed to Gladstone&#x27;s policies, were &quot;visiting them&quot; and &quot;thoughtful&quot;.

Lady Rosebery also began to befriend those politicians such as Lord Northbrook who empathised with her husband, while others such as Lord Granville and Lord Hartington she identified as aloof. She dismissed Lord Spencer with &quot;I can never look on him as a great motive power, besides he does not mention Archie [Rosebery] to me.&quot;

Finally her soliciting paid off and in 1881, Rosebery was offered a government position acceptable to him, that of Under Secretary at the Home Office with special responsibility for Scotland. He had sought the position feeling that Scotland was neglected by the Liberal Government who were more interested in Ireland. However, immediately upon assuming the job he began to demand a place in the cabinet. The office he sought was that of Lord Privy Seal, a position Gladstone refused on account of Rosebery&#x27;s inexperience in Government. It appeared that Rosebery was showing his true colours and he was accused of behaving like a spoilt child, with doubts cast over the honourableness of his reasons for refusing the Under Secretaryship of the India Office.

Lady Rosebery, &quot;conscious of her husband&#x27;s supreme ability&quot;, wanted him in the cabinet and was furiously agitating her husband&#x27;s discontent until Rosebery threatened to resign his Home Office position. Lady Rosebery had an angry row with Gladstone&#x27;s wife, where Mrs Gladstone pointed out that if Rosebery resigned he would have nothing but horse racing to interest him, and that Lady Rosebery should be patient as her husband was young. Rosebery, accepting that a cabinet place was not going to be forthcoming, resigned from Government. Lady Rosebery, realising further appeal to the Gladstones was pointless, tried a new avenue—Lord Hartington, the immensely influential Secretary of State for War, who was already quarrelling with Gladstone over the Irish home rule problem, and whom she allegedly met by chance at Preston Railway Station. Inviting him into her carriage for the journey to London, she pleaded her husband&#x27;s case for three hours to her captive listener. The Roseberys then immediately left England and their children for a long trip to America and Australia. On their return in 1885 Rosebery was appointed Lord Privy Seal, complete with the seat in the cabinet which he sought.

===After 1885, and the Dilke Scandal===
Gladstone resigned as Prime Minister in 1885 following a Government defeat over the Irish home rule question. The new Tory government was led by Lord Salisbury. However, as a minority administration it was not expected to last, and a swift return of the former administration was anticipated. During this period serious (if unproven) charges of plotting and ruthless ambition were about to be levelled against Lady Rosebery. Sir Charles Dilke, considered as a likely replacement for Gladstone, and thus a rival to Rosebery in government, was implicated in one of the most scandalous and ruinous divorce cases of the era. Involvement in any divorce was social suicide in the 19th century, but the facts which emerged were enough to ensure it was political suicide as well. A friend of the Roseberys, Donald Crawford, MP, sued his wife Virginia for divorce naming Dilke as co-respondent. There was little evidence and Dilke denied the charge, which could have been ultimately forgotten, if Virginia had not suddenly decided to sign a confession giving such lurid details that a great scandal was unavoidable. She claimed that not only had Dilke slept with her and taught her &quot;French vices&quot;, but also slept with her mother and partaken in a three-in-a-bed orgy with Virginia and a maid. Dilke denied everything, but his hopes of high political office were ruined forever. Dilke claimed the whole thing was an embroidery of lies and conspiracies by his political enemies. Rumours began to circulate that the Roseberys, and Lady Rosebery in particular, were at the bottom of Dilke&#x27;s misfortune.

In his futile quest to exonerate himself, and grasping at rumour, Dilke wrote to Rosebery accusing Lady Rosebery of having paid Virginia to make the confession. An outraged Rosebery denied all on his wife&#x27;s behalf, while in December 1885 Lady Rosebery&#x27;s only response on being told of Virginia Crawford&#x27;s confessions was: &quot;Dilke&#x27;s behaviour is very astonishing in some reports, though it is not an actual surprise to me.&quot; Early the following year Gladstone was returned to power and Rosebery was appointed Foreign Secretary in Gladstone&#x27;s third but brief term of office. Dilke&#x27;s political career was ruined, and for years afterwards he continued to expound the Rosebery conspiracy theory. Nothing was ever proven against Lady Rosebery and no tangible evidence exists to substantiate the claim.

The impartiality demanded by Rosebery&#x27;s new office forced him to sell many of his business interests, which had come by the way of the Rothschild family, to be seen to be avoiding a conflict of interest. However, his wife&#x27;s ambition and part in his rise to power was not only being recognised in high places, but clearly starting to irritate. On being told that Lady Rosebery was very keen for her husband to become Foreign Secretary, Gladstone replied &quot;She would think herself capable of being Queen of the Realm and think the place only just good enough for her.&quot;

== Philanthropy ==

Like many other women of her class and era, Lady Rosebery patronised a great number of charities. Upon her inheriting her fortune, one of her first acts was to found a lifeboat station in memory of her father, in 1875, at a cost of £2,000.

Lady Rosebery was also deeply involved with the welfare of young working-class women of the Jewish faith who inhabited the poorer areas of London, in particular Whitechapel. There she founded the Club for Jewish Working Girls. She also donated to numerous other charities connected with Jewish causes. However, within a week of her death her husband began to cancel many of these subscriptions, prompting charges of antisemitism.

Her interest in education has been one of her most obvious surviving charitable legacies. She founded schools in all the villages surrounding the Roseberys&#x27; estates. The Mentmore estate alone was serviced by three schools founded by her at Wingrave, Cheddington and Mentmore itself. Not only were the children educated at her expense by trained teachers, each was also provided with seasonal gifts of new clothes. Cheddington School remains in its original building with her cypher on its walls, while Wingrave School, which opened in 1877, survives in new premises.

== Death ==

Lady Rosebery died of typhoid at Dalmeny in 1890. She was found to also have Bright&#x27;s disease which had weakened her. It was only after her death that the doctors who had treated her disclosed to Rosebery that her kidney condition would have killed her within two years even if she had not contracted typhoid. She was buried in accordance with the rites of the Jewish faith on 25 November 1890 at Willesden Jewish Cemetery. Rosebery found this particularly hard to bear, and wrote to Queen Victoria of the pain he experienced when &quot;another creed steps in to claim the corpse&quot;.

==Legacy==

===Rosebery as widower===
There is no evidence that Lady Rosebery drove her husband to follow her own political agenda, or that of her family. For her the rewards seem to have been the pleasure of seeing a husband she undoubtedly adored in the high office of which she felt him worthy. There is no doubt that she tempered her husband&#x27;s more radical views. Immediately following his wife&#x27;s death Rosebery retired from politics, writing in October 1891 &quot;The sole object of my ambition has disappeared with the death of my wife.&quot; Proof of the widespread belief in society that Lady Rosebery was the stable element of the partnership was confirmed shortly after her death, by Queen Victoria, following a then rare public speech by Rosebery, in which he supported Home Rule for Ireland. The Queen was shocked and thought the speech &quot;almost communistic&quot; and went on to attribute Rosebery&#x27;s &quot;shocking and disappointing&quot; behaviour to the fact that &quot;poor Lady Rosebery is not there to keep him back&quot;. While Queen Victoria always personally liked Rosebery, she mistrusted his politics.

The Queen had thoroughly liked Lady Rosebery and wrote Rosebery several letters of condolence, likening his loss to the untimely death of her own consort, Prince Albert. It seems that the Queen&#x27;s antipathy to Jews was confined to elevating them to the peerage. This view had softened by 1885. In 1890 she accepted a luncheon invitation from Lady Rosebery&#x27;s cousin Ferdinand de Rothschild and toured Waddesdon Manor albeit eating in a separate dining room to the Jewish members of the party.

Shortly after his wife&#x27;s death, Rosebery left his grieving children and went alone on a tour of Spain. Following a visit to El Escorial he wrote on the sepulchral wonders of the building, but added &quot;for the dead alone the Taj is of course supreme&quot;. On his return home he had designed for his wife a Victorian Gothic version of the Taj Mahal in miniature. For the remainder of his life he wore black and used black edged writing paper. Once, when talking with his daughter Sybil, he asked her what mourning she thought her mother would have worn had the situation been reversed. Sybil replied, &quot;She would not have worn any, she would have died at once.&quot;

Ronald Munro Ferguson has been quoted in 1912 as saying &quot;many things would have gone otherwise had Lady Rosebery lived. Her loss is today as great a calamity from every point of view as it was at the time of her death.&quot;

Widowhood changed Rosebery, both mentally and physically: he aged overnight, and began to refer to himself as an old man. Two years after her death, friends were still concerned that he was suicidal. Winston Churchill thought him maimed by her death, and later said of her &quot;she was a remarkable woman on whom Rosebery leaned, she was ever a pacifying and composing element in his life which he was never able to find again because he could never give full confidence to anyone else.&quot;

Sir Edward Hamilton, Rosebery&#x27;s closest friend, wrote:


Before their marriage and his full-time entry into politics, Rosebery&#x27;s future wife had written with extraordinary foresight and ambition to him: &quot;I work only to help you, if you are Prime Minister, let me imitate Montagu Corry.&quot;

===Later life of children===
Lady Rosebery&#x27;s eldest son, Harry, who was less successful in politics than his father and brother, distinguished himself by becoming captain of Surrey County Cricket Club and owning two Epsom Derby-winning horses. He succeeded his father as 6th Earl of Rosebery and died in 1974. Margaret married her father&#x27;s old friend and biographer the Marquess of Crewe. Such was still the fame of her parents that London traffic was brought to a standstill on her wedding day in 1899. Lady Crewe became one of the first women magistrates in Britain; she died in 1955. Lady Sybil has been summarised by one of her father&#x27;s biographers: &quot;Even more eccentric than her father, she spent much of her time living in a caravan.&quot; Neil, the second of the Roseberys&#x27; sons, entered politics but joined the army on the outbreak of World War I and was killed leading a charge at Gezer in 1917.

===Property===
Of Hannah Rosebery&#x27;s homes, the lease on Lansdowne House was surrendered shortly before her death, when the Roseberys purchased 38 Berkeley Square. This property was transformed into one of London&#x27;s most luxurious town houses. However, Lady Rosebery did not live to see the work completed. Her son Harry sold the house in 1938, and it was demolished. A year later a bomb landed on the empty site during World War II. The Durdans was bequeathed to her daughter, Sybil, in 1929 and was sold together with its contents in 1955. Lord and Lady Rosebery&#x27;s library there was given to the nation at this time. Mentmore, the grandest of the Roseberys&#x27; homes, was sold by Lady Rosebery&#x27;s grandson, the 7th Earl of Rosebery, in 1977, together with the Rothschild art collection, which Lady Rosebery had not only been intensely interested in but had enlarged considerably. She personally catalogued the collection, and prophetically wrote in the preface &quot;In time to come, when, like all collections, this will be dispersed (and I hope this will be long after my death) this book may be of value.&quot;

Her two-volume work and the collection it described remained so unknown that &quot;Save Mentmore&quot; (a group attempting to halt the sale of Mentmore to keep the collection within Britain) failed largely due to widespread public ignorance of both house and collection. A few pieces of furniture and paintings were taken to Dalmeny, (the only house to remain in the family) where they are displayed today, and three pictures including Drouais&#x27;s &quot;Madame de Pompadour&quot; were purchased for the National Gallery. The remainder of the collection was dispersed in a week-long sale and is now scattered across the globe. A further sale of the &quot;Continental Library,&quot; to which she had added, was conducted in 1995 at the Aeolian Hall, London, by Sotheby&#x27;s.

===Town named after Hannah Primrose in Israel===
Pardes Hanna (Hebrew: Hannah&#x27;s [Citrus] Orchard), a local council founded in 1929 on the Sharon plain in Israel, was named after Hannah Primrose, Countess of Rosebery.

===In literature===
Her qualities were portrayed in literature when Lady Rosebery was reputed to be the model for Marcella Maxwell in Mrs Humphry Ward&#x27;s novel &quot;Sir George Tressady&quot; (1909). The author lived at Stocks close to Lady Rosebery&#x27;s home at Mentmore.

<text>Billy Higgins (October 11, 1936 – May 3, 2001) was an American jazz drummer. He played mainly free jazz and hard bop.

==Biography==
Higgins was born in Los Angeles, California, United States. Higgins played on Ornette Coleman&#x27;s first records, beginning in 1958. He then freelanced extensively with hard bop and other post-bop players, including Donald Byrd, Dexter Gordon, Grant Green, Herbie Hancock, Joe Henderson, Don Cherry, Paul Horn, Milt Jackson, Jackie McLean, Pat Metheny, Hank Mobley, Thelonious Monk, Lee Morgan, David Murray, Art Pepper, Sonny Rollins, Mal Waldron, and Cedar Walton. He was one of the house drummers for Blue Note Records and played on dozens of Blue Note albums of the 1960s. He also collaborated with composer La Monte Young and guitarist Sandy Bull.

In his career, Higgins played on more than 700 recordings, including recordings of rock and funk. He appeared as a jazz drummer in the 2001 movie &quot;Southlander&quot;.

In 1989, Higgins cofounded a cultural center, The World Stage, in Los Angeles to encourage and promote younger jazz musicians. The center provides workshops in performance and writing, as well as concerts and recordings. Higgins also taught in the jazz studies program at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Billy Higgins died of kidney and liver failure on May 3, 2001, at a hospital in Inglewood, California.

<text>Mark Harris (November 19, 1922 – May 30, 2007) was an American novelist, literary biographer, and educator, remembered for his baseball novels featuring Henry Wiggen, particularly &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly.&quot; Harris&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Denver Post&quot; calls him &quot;one of that legion of under-the-radar writers who for decades consistently turned out excellent novels and went largely unsung as he did...Harris said of his books that &#x27;they are about the one man against his society and trying to come to terms with his society, and trying to succeed within it without losing his own identity or integrity.&#x27; He might have said the same thing of himself.&quot;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Harris was born Mark Harris Finkelstein in Mount Vernon, New York, to Carlyle and Ruth (Klausner) Finkelstein. At the age of 11, he began keeping a diary, which he would maintain for every day of his life thereafter.

After graduating in 1940 from Mount Vernon High School, he dropped his surname because &quot;it was a difficult time for kids with Jewish names to get jobs.&quot; He subsequently went to work for Paul Winkler&#x27;s Press Alliance news agency in New York City as a messenger and mimeograph operator.

He was drafted into the United States Army in January 1943. His growing opposition to war and his anger at the prevalence of racial discrimination in the Army led him to go AWOL from Camp Wheeler, Georgia, in February 1944. He was soon arrested and then hospitalized for psychoneurosis. He was honorably discharged in April 1944. His wartime experience formed the basis for two of his novels, &quot;Trumpet to the World&quot; (1946) and &quot;Something About a Soldier&quot; (1957).

===Journalism career===
Harris joined &quot;The Daily Item&quot; of Port Chester, New York, as a reporter in May 1944. A year later he accepted a position with &quot;PM&quot; in New York City but was fired after two months. In July 1945 he was hired by the International News Service and moved to St. Louis. While there, he met coworker Josephine Horen, whom he would marry in March 1946. After resigning in July 1946, he spent the next year and a half in a succession of short-lived journalism jobs in Albuquerque, New Mexico (&quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot;), Chicago (&quot;Negro Digest&quot; and &quot;Ebony&quot;), and New York (Park Row News Service).

===Academic career===
In February 1948, Harris enrolled at the University of Denver, from which he received a Master&#x27;s degree in English in 1951 as well as obtaining a PhD in American Studies from the University of Minnesota in 1956, writing his doctoral dissertation on the progressive writer and intellectual Randolph Bourne.

After obtaining his doctorate, Harris began a long, productive career as a college educator. In September 1956, he was hired by the English department of San Francisco State College, where he taught until 1967. He went on to teach at several other universities, including Purdue University (1967–1970), California Institute of the Arts (1970–1973), the University of Southern California (1973–1975), and the University of Pittsburgh (1976–1980). In September 1980, he joined the faculty of Arizona State University, where he was a professor of English and taught in the creative writing program until his retirement in 2001.

===Writing career===
Harris completed his first novel, &quot;Trumpet to the World&quot;, while employed as a journalist in St. Louis. Published in 1946, &quot;Trumpet to the World&quot; is the story of a young black soldier married to a white woman who is put on trial for striking back at a white officer. Even while Harris attended school he continued to write fiction, producing three novels by the time he received his Ph.D. He continued to produce novels and contribute to periodicals through the years.

Harris was best known for a quartet of novels about baseball players: &quot;The Southpaw&quot; (1953), &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly&quot; (1956), &quot;A Ticket for a Seamstitch&quot; (1957), and &quot;It Looked Like For Ever&quot; (1979). Written in the American vernacular, the books are the account of Henry &quot;Author&quot; Wiggen, a pitcher for the fictional New York Mammoths. In 1956, &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly&quot; was adapted for an installment of the dramatic television anthology series &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;; the production starred Paul Newman as Wiggen and Albert Salmi as doomed catcher Bruce Pearson. The novel also became a major motion picture in 1973, with a screenplay written by Harris, directed by John D. Hancock and featuring Michael Moriarty as Wiggen and Robert De Niro as Pearson. Although &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly&quot; was Harris&#x27;s only true popular success, most of his novels have received critical acclaim. These include &quot;Something about a Soldier&quot; (1957), &quot;Wake Up Stupid&quot; (1959), &quot;The Goy&quot; (1970), and &quot;Killing Everybody&quot; (1973).

In 1960, while in his first college teaching position, at San Francisco State College, Harris promoted his then-most-recent book in a TV appearance as guest contestant in &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, a game played on &quot;The Groucho Show&quot;.

In the first chapter of his 1961 book &quot;The Rhetoric of Fiction&quot;, Wayne C. Booth quotes the &quot;fine young novelist&quot; Harris as saying: &quot;You will no more expect the novelist to tell you precisely how something is said than you will expect him to stand by your chair and hold your book.&quot;

In January 1962, &quot;Something About a Soldier&quot;, a stage version of Harris&#x27;s novel, played briefly on Broadway. Written by Ernest Kinoy and produced by the Theatre Guild, it featured Sal Mineo in the lead role. Later, the novel &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly&quot; was adapted into a stage play at the Next Theatre in Evanston, Illinois.

In addition to his work as a novelist, Harris had a productive career in other literary genres. He authored numerous critical essays and articles, and has edited the poems of Vachel Lindsay (&quot;Selected Poems of Vachel Lindsay&quot;, 1963) and the journals of James Boswell (&quot;Heart of Boswell&quot;, 1981). Harris also wrote biographies of Lindsay (&quot;City of Discontent&quot;, 1952) and Saul Bellow (&quot;Saul Bellow: Drumlin Woodchuck&quot;, 1980). He has also written three autobiographical books: &quot;Mark the Glove Boy, or The Last Days of Richard Nixon&quot; (1964), an account of Nixon&#x27;s unsuccessful California gubernatorial campaign; &quot;Twentyone Twice: A Journal&quot; (1966), an account of his experiences in Sierra Leone as a member of the Peace Corps; and, finally, &quot;Best Father Ever Invented&quot; (1976), subtitled &quot;An Autobiography of Mark Harris,&quot; in which he chronicles his life from late adolescence up to 1973.

Harris died of complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital at age 84. He was survived by his wife, Josephine Horen; his sister, Martha; two sons, one daughter, and three grandchildren. His nephew (the son of Harris&#x27;s sister Martha Finkelstein) is the writer Saïd Sayrafiezadeh, author of the memoir &quot;When Skateboards Will Be Free: A Memoir of a Political Childhood&quot;. Harris&#x27;s papers are held in Special Collections at the University of Delaware.

== Legacy ==
In &quot;Baseball: A Literary Anthology&quot;, editor Nicholas Dawidoff writes that &quot;The four books in which Wiggen narrates the story of his life in baseball—&quot;The Southpaw&quot; (1953), &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly&quot; (1956), &quot;A Ticket for a Seamstitch&quot; (1957), and &quot;It Looked For Ever&quot; (1979)—elevate the baseball novel into unmistakable art.&quot;

In &quot;The Denver Post&quot;, Roger K. Miller writes that &quot;&quot;Bang the Drum Slowly, by Henry J. Wiggin: Certain of His Enthusiasms Restrained&quot;, to give it its full title, is even better than that other much-praised baseball novel, Bernard Malamud&#x27;s &quot;The Natural&quot;, with its element of fantasy. (Harris did not like fantasy, especially in baseball.) It is at least as good as Robert Coover&#x27;s &quot;The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop&quot;. which is about a fantasy game and, like Harris&#x27; and all other good baseball novels, about something more than baseball.&quot;&quot;

<doc id="634606" wikidata="Q1624133" url="?curid=634606" title="Sasha (name)">
<text>Sasha is a name which originated among Slavic peoples from Eastern and Southern Europe as the shortened version of Alexander and Alexandra. It is also used as a surname, although very rarely. Alternative spellings include: &#x27; ( – Belarusian, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Ukrainian), &#x27; ( – Bulgarian), &#x27; ( – Macedonian), &#x27; (Slovenian, Serbo-Croatian, Czech, Slovak, Latvian, Lithuanian), &#x27; (Polish), &#x27; (Romanian), &#x27; (French), &#x27; (German), &#x27; (Italian), &#x27; (Danish and Swedish) and  ( – Hebrew).

== Usage ==
This name is especially common in Europe, where it is used by both females and males as a diminutive of Alexandra and Alexander, respectively. Despite its popularity in informal usage, the name is rarely recorded on birth certificates in countries such as Belarus, the Czech Republic, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, as it is considered a diminutive, not a formal name. Exceptions are Croatia, Germany, Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Switzerland. 

In Italy or in French-speaking regions (Belgium, France, and Quebec), Sacha is more often given to males. In the United States the name is almost exclusively used for girls and ranked number 569 among U.S. baby names in 2014, although it didn&#x27;t gain popularity until the 1970s.

<doc id="634612" wikidata="Q465983" url="?curid=634612" title="Margaret I, Countess of Flanders">
<text>Margaret I ( 1145 – died 15 November 1194) was the countess of Flanders &quot;suo jure&quot; from 1191 to her death.

==Early life==
Margaret was the daughter of Count Thierry of Flanders and Sibylla of Anjou. 

In 1160 she married Count Ralph II of Vermandois, son of Ralph I and known as Ralph the Younger. Due to his leprosy, the marriage could not be consummated and remained childless. He died of leprosy in 1167 without issue. 

In 1169 she married Count Baldwin V of Hainaut, a scion of the House of Flanders.

==Countship==
In 1191, Margaret&#x27;s brother Count Philip I of Flanders died childless, and she as his heir claimed the county of Flanders with the support of her husband. Her claim was questioned by the king of France who, with support of Ghent, declared Flanders escheated to the crown due to the lack of male heirs, a problem that was not solved until the Treaty of Arras by the mediation of the archbishop of Reims. They met some unrest among the nobility of the area, foremost by her brother&#x27;s widow, Theresa of Portugal, who was given extensive dower lands in the coastal and southern Flanders where she provoked considerable unrest by high taxation.

The right of Margaret and her husband to the County of Flanders was not finally acknowledged until 1 March 1192. As countess, she objected to all foreign legal independence in her lands, and accordingly, she prevented the Hanse merchants living in Bruges from acquiring a separate quarter and rights for themselves in the port of Damme.

Margaret died on 15 November 1194. As her husband had become Count of Flanders &quot;jure uxoris&quot;, he could not remain sole count, and Margaret was succeeded by their son Baldwin IX.

==Issue==
Margaret and Baldwin had:
* Isabella of Hainault, married Philip II of France
* Baldwin IX of Flanders (1171–1205), also count of Flanders and Latin Emperor
* Yolanda (1175–1219), married Peter of Courtenay, Latin Emperor.
* Philip I of Namur (1175–1212), Margrave of Namur, married Marie of France.
* Henry of Flanders (1176–1216), Latin emperor of Constantinople, married firstly to Agnes of Montferrat and secondly to Maria of Bulgaria.
*Sybille (1179–9 January 1217), married c. 1197 Guichard IV, Sire de Beaujeu. They had a daughter, Agnes of Beaujeu.
* Eustace (d. 1219), regent of the Kingdom of Thessalonica,
* Godfrey

Illegitimate Issue:
* Thierry, of Flanders (ill.) (1197-1207), son of Philip I, Margaret&#x27;s brother

<text>Naqada (Egyptian Arabic: ; Coptic language: ; Ancient Greek: , Ancient Egyptian: &quot;Nbyt&quot;) is a town on the west bank of the Nile in Qena Governorate, Egypt, situated ca. 20 km north of Luxor. It includes the villages of Tukh, Khatara, Danfiq, and Zawayda. According to the 1960 census, it is one of the most uninhabited areas and had only 3,000 inhabitants, mostly of Christian faith who preserved elements of the Coptic language up until the 1930s.

The ancient town contained a cemetery that held approximately 2,000 graves. The first person to excavate the site was archaeologist Sir Flinders Petrie in 1894. Petrie was working for the Egypt Exploration Fund (now the Egypt Exploration Society) when he excavated the site. Some of the findings during the excavation included artifacts from the Amratian (Naqada I) and the Gerzeh (Naqada II).

==Archaeology==
Naqada stands near the site of a prehistoric Egyptian necropolis: The town, called Ombos, was the centre of the cult of Set and large tombs were built there  3500 BCE.

The large quantity of remains from Naqada has enabled the dating of the entire archeological period throughout Egypt and its environs, hence the town name Naqada is used for the pre-dynastic Naqada culture  4400–3000 BCE. Other Naqada culture archeological sites include el Badari, the Gerzeh culture, and Nekhen.

=== Excavations ===
Petrie&#x27;s initial findings during his excavations lead him to incorrectly believe he had found a new race of people who had invaded Egypt during the First Intermediate Period. This would later be disproven by the work of Jacques de Morgan who had conducted his own digs in the Naqada Region. Morgan&#x27;s findings showed that the artifacts came from an earlier era and this lead Petrie to revise his own findings.

The graves that were uncovered contained bodies that were less intact and were placed by streams and in covered pits compared to the Egyptian practice of usually placing the graves on a cliff face or rising ground and having the bodies lie in a hollow or a cave and they lacked the embalming typical of Egyptian burials.

Research into the predynastic sites of the dead in the Naqada region came to show that they had transitioned into a state style of civilization and away from a chiefdom. Many of these graves had contained many items ranging from amulets to hairpins to knives made of flint. Few of these graves had items of value or were of special use which tells us that they had a developing class of people who resided within the upper class including an established group of middle class individuals. This level of monetary stability is thought to have come from the region having an established gold trade as reveled by seals found in cemeteries.

A survey of the area in the years between 1978 and 1981, led by Fekri Hassan, working with the Washington State University in a project titled &quot;Predynastic of Naqada&quot; was done in an attempt to find more cemetery sites. This project did lead to the discovery of more cemeteries. This survey also lead to the rediscovery of the Royal Tomb that was found by de Morgan which was then later re-evaluated. Through the survey the area of Nubt, in the south town, was found to have been looted and used by the farmers in the area as a form of fertilizer called Sebakh. The objects that were left behind had been moved from their original location or were sold on the black market.

==== Future Surveys ====
In August 2018 the Egypt Exploration Society had conducted tests in the area of Nubt to test for its ability to be used for further research. The purpose of this survey is to bring more attention to the usefulness of the site and for protecting it. Later seasons will take looks into how to best preserve the sites. Further work will begin on the surrounding area.

== In popular culture ==
In the &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise, alien civilizations make extensive use of a mineral, naquada, named after the archaeological site.
