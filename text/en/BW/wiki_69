<text>The Cincinnati May Festival is a two-week annual choral festival, held in May in Cincinnati, Ohio, US.
==History==
The festival&#x27;s roots go back to the 1840s, when &quot;Saengerfests&quot; were held in that city, bringing singers from all over the United States and abroad to perform large scale classical works of the day.

In &quot;A City That Sings,&quot; we find a description of Cincinnati in the late 1800s: &quot;In the final decades of the nineteenth century Cincinnati cemented its position as one of America&#x27;s cultural leaders with the founding of the still flourishing May Festival (1873), the Cincinnati Art Museum (1886) and its neighbor in Cincinnati, the Cincinnati Art Academy (1887), and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (1895).

Singing societies were very popular in the nineteenth century and the tradition was no different in Cincinnati. Both the English and German societies were evident.
As a rule, the differences between the two national choral traditions were in language, origin, composition, and social scope. English societies, the earliest of Cincinnati&#x27;s choral ensembles, existed primarily to make music. The first German society was founded in 1825, but the majority of these organizations arose after an immigration boom in the late 1840s. They provided social opportunities for eating and drinking, as well as making music. Most of the German societies were men&#x27;s choruses, but women were sometimes admitted, often as non-singing supporting members, in the last half of the century.

In October 1863, a circular was sent to the &#x27;Musical Public of Cincinnati&#x27; to extend a &#x27;cordial invitation to singers, both ladies and gentlemen, who will take an interest in building up a large Choral Society, such as the old societies of Boston and New York, to join.&#x27; This mixed chorus approach to presenting oratorio with members drawn from a broad spectrum of Cincinnati&#x27;s singers regardless of the nationality or society to which they pledged allegiance, must be regarded as an important precedent of the May Festival.
Maria Longworth Nichols Storer the granddaughter of Nicholas Longworth, a banker and winemaker, and wife of Colonel George Ward Nichols took a trip to England in 1871. There she witnessed one of the large English festivals. At home, Mr. Nichols was a member of the Harmonic Society, so the couple was involved in choral music of the English variety. Mrs. Nichols knew Cincinnati&#x27;s choral tradition was the perfect place to start a musical festival of their own. She wrote to Theodore Thomas, a renowned American, conductor and asked for a meeting with him on his next visit to Cincinnati.
He recounts: &#x27;On my...visit in 1871 [sic—it was 1872] a young married lady, member of one of the leading families, laid before me a plan for a large Musical Festival. She proposed that I should be the conductor of it, saying that I would be responsible for the artistic side, she would find the men who would take charge of the business details. I soon found out that this lady was not only very talented in may ways, but that her taste was not amateurish in anything, and I readily consented to undertake the work she wished me to do.&#x27; He agreed to be conductor of the Festival if fifty thousand dollars could be raised for a guarantee fund and a committee could be formed to take care of the business aspects of the event. Mrs. Nichols&#x27;s biographer, Sr. Rose Angela Boehle, mentions that Maria and Col. Nichols started the guarantee fund of the 1873 Festival with a five-thousand-dollar contribution.

Among the first actions of the executive committee was the hiring of Theordore Thomas as musical director and Carl Barus as director of the chorus. Thomas&#x27;s touring orchestra would play, as they would continue to do at every festival until 1904. Arthur Mees, a Cincinnati music teacher, was named rehearsal accompanist and later, festival organist. While the artistic forces were almost entirely German, the administrative team that planned the event was mostly of English descent. A circular describing the expectations of chorus members was printed in English and German and distributed to 121 music dealers, 60 post offices, and 144 singing societies. It was also distributed to 1,120 newspapers throughout Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and &#x27;the leading papers of the West.&#x27; According to the superintendent of the chorus, Samuel D. Carey, by the time the first performance took place, the chorus had 706 members.

==The 1873 Festival==
&quot;The orchestra is German; the music three-fourths German, and the other fourth exotic; scarcely half the singers were native-born; but, despite all this, it is thoroughly American, for nothing but that attenuated and intensified form of Anglo-Saxon called the Yankee could ever have supplied the nerve-force needed to carry on such a mammoth affair.&quot;
Performances included repertoire that was overwhelmingly German. Handel, Bach, Beethoven, Haydn, and Mozart comprised the first two concerts. Of the sixty works on the seven concerts, only five were by composers not born in a German-speaking country. The matinee concerts consisted largely of arias, art songs, and light orchestral works, including isolated movements of symphonies, Strauss waltzes, and overtures. Thomas&#x27;s evening concerts were more formal and consisted of major vocal and choral works, including Handel&#x27;s &quot;Dettingen Te Deum&quot;, scenes from Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;, and Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, along with purely symphonic works and concert arias.

==The 1875 Festival==
A second May Festival took place at Saengerfest Hall in 1875, and presented the American premieres of Bach&#x27;s Magnificat and Brahms&#x27;s Triumphlied. During this festival, Cincinnati&#x27;s usual springtime thunderstorms pelted the leaky tin roof of the hall with rain and hail, as they had done to a lesser degree in 1873. The cavernous hall acted as a resonating chamber and Thomas had to stop the concerts on more than one occasion to let the storms pass. Two other problems with the hall were mentioned in the press reports of the first festival, which no doubt persisted in 1875. The reporter from the Gazette mentioned that the temperature in the hall was too warm. The situation was &#x27;promptly remedied by a member of the executive committee who crashed out the glass from every window whose frame was wedged too tight in its place to be readily removed.&#x27; Another problem arose as the audience, estimated at four thousand with two thousand more in the streets, seems to have grown somewhat frustrated by the crowded conditions in the hall and complained that allowing one thousand people to stand in the aisles &#x27;sorely disappoints ticket-holders who selected their seats on the aisles with especial purpose.&#x27;

==Music Hall and the 1878 Festival==
Kentucky-born railroad entrepreneur Reuben Springer was so annoyed by the hall problems that he made the initial $125,000 donation to create a matching fund to enable the construction of a new music hall.

The area chosen for the new Music Hall was close to the Community Hospital, Insane Asylum, and the Pest House . When inmates or patients expired, they were interred in Potter&#x27;s Field, the present site of Music Hall. Over two hundred wagon loads of bones were moved to Spring Grove Cemetery and reburied in a mass grave.

Construction for the hall began on May 1, 1877, just a year before the third May Festival was to begin. It was dedicated on May 14 at the first concert of the 1878 May Festival. (125) Tickets for the first festival held in Music Hall were, &quot;$2 for a single reserved seat, $1 for standing room, and $10 dollars for the entire set of seven concert.&quot; Cincinnati&#x27;s May Festival has taken place in Springer Auditorium since 1878.

==Edward Elgar in Cincinnati==
After the death of Theodore Thomas in 1905, the 1906 May Festival featured British composer Sir Edward Elgar conducting his oratorio The Dream of Gerontius at the final concert. ... Elgar was the most prominent British composer and \his music was popular in the U.S. He conducted the second, fifth, and sixth concerts of the festival, after spending the preceding two weeks rehearsing his music with the performers.

Theodore Thomas had previously conducted Gerontius at the 1904 May Festival, and its success and the fame of the composer may have drawn the board of directors to consider Elgar for a guest conductor and celebrity at the upcoming festival.

Enraging the chorus, Lawrence Maxwell Jr., vice-president of the May Festival Association stated that he was &quot;against the giving of the memorial concert, saying that it had not the sanction of the board, that the program was a log of &#x27;hash,&#x27; and that it would make Thomas turn in his grave to listen to it.&quot; ...The Festival Board, in an act of either reconciliation or humiliation towards the chorus, planned its own memorial concert to open the 1906 May Festival. The chorus responded in a letter by demanding Maxwell&#x27;s resignation, adding that &quot;if the Board of Directors do not find this request acceptable, we find no other course open to us than to insist that this communication shall constitute the resignation of the chorus, to take effect at once.&quot; The May Festival Chorus was soon disbanded, and the Board of Directors chose Maxwell as the next president of the May Festival Association.

In the midst of the upheaval, the festival reorganized its board and established a marketing plan for the 1906 concerts to choose &quot;[Frank] Van der Stucken as festival conductor, and to depend upon Sir Edward Elgar as a foreign attraction.&quot; Frank van der Stucken was the conductor of the recently formed Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, and the board decided that the Cincinnati orchestra would play in the 1906 May Festival for the first time.

The previous festivals had had open rehearsals and many other public opportunities for Cincinnatians to meet and mingle with the stars, but this would not be the case in 1906. With a completely restructured program, Frank Van der Stucken anticipated rehearsals would be full of personnel problems and musical challenges and considered options that would allow the performers to focus on the music.

The final concert was held on the same evening, and the program consisted of The Dream of Gerontius followed by Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony.

==The May Festival and Cincinnati School Music==
However, perhaps the appearances of massed school choirs most valued by Cincinnatians were those in the then-biennial May Festivals. At the first May Festivals (1873 and 1875) a large chorus of pupils and teachers from the city&#x27;s intermediate, secondary, and normal schools presented music learned in their public school classes. Beginning in 1882, planners of the festivals began working student choral ensembles into the regular festival repertoire, such as Bach&#x27;s St. Matthew Passion, Berlioz&#x27;s Damnation of Faust, and Te Deum, Handel&#x27;s Judas Maccabeus, or Rubinstein&#x27;s Tower of Babel. In 1897 a Children&#x27;s May Festival, utilizing some 2,000 students from the city schools, presented Franz Abt&#x27;s Cinderella.

Choruses of school children continue to be welcome participants in such major works as Orff&#x27;s Carmina Burana, Walton&#x27;s Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast, Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 3, and Britten&#x27;s War Requiem. All these accomplishments would have been impossible had not Cincinnati schools, both public and parochial, introduced music into their curricula.

==Notable performances and recent history==

Perhaps the largest work in the repertoire, Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 8, often called The Symphony of a Thousand, received a then-rare performance at the 1931 festival with a chorus of nine hundred, a massive orchestra, and eight soloists.

African-American composer Robert Nathaniel Dett&#x27;s oratorio The Ordering of Moses appeared on the 1937 May Festival. In 2014, the May Festival Chorus and Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra gave a full performance of the oratorio in Carnegie Hall.

During times of war and tragedy, the May Festival has traditionally stepped forward to honor heroes and soothe the pain. During World War II, patriotic music held price of place in 1942 and performers donated their services. All proceeds were given to the Cincinnati War Chest. In 1944 a chorus of Women&#x27;s Army Corps members from Ft. Campbell, Kentucky, performed Frank Loesser&#x27;s The WAC Hymn and many soldiers attended the festival. Just one month after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania, the May Festival Chorus traveled to New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall to perform Britten&#x27;s powerful War Requiem with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and James Conlon.

When the United States entered World War II, the problems necessitated a three-year span until the next Festival. And then it was reduced to three concerts with a very much abridged program due to the shortage of paper. The Victory Festival in 1946 opened with the Hallelujah Chorus and the whole program was dedicated to the blessings of peace. The Folk Song Symphony by Roy Harris had 500 high school students singing as their costumes divided the chorus stand into three broad stripes of red, white and blue.

Until 1967 the May Festival was held every two years with only a few exceptions, but since then it has been given every year.

Adolphus Hailstork also composed &#x27;Earthrise,&#x27; a work for double chorus and orchestra commissioned by the May Festival in 2006 to promote healing following the 2000 riots. The piece featured a white chorus on one side of the risers and an African American chorus on the other side, who by the end form a visual metaphor by interweaving to create a racially harmonic gesture.

May Festival opened its doors to African American singers in 1956.

The all-volunteer May Festival Chorus was under the direction of Robert Porco from 1989 to May 2024. Matthew Swanson, former director of the May Festival Youth Chorus, is the current director. The chorus rehearses on Tuesday evenings during the academic year from 7-10pm. The chorus performs regularly with the Cincinnati Symphony and Pops Orchestras, singing at Music Hall (Cincinnati) as well as Riverbend Music Center. The May Festival Chorus has garnered critical acclaim for its high level of performance. The May Festival Chamber Chorus performs at the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption in northern Kentucky during the annual May Festival and at various community concerts throughout the year. 

In addition, in 1986 the May Festival Youth Chorus was formed. Made up of youth from area high-schools, the MFYC is conducted by Jason Alexander Holmes and gives its members (who must audition competitively) the opportunity to perform challenging music well above the average high school level. The MFYC also has the opportunity to perform with the adult May Festival throughout the year, most notably during May Festival.

On 5 December 2017, the Cincinnati May Festival canceled conductor James Levine’s appearance in May 2018, after he was accused by four males of sexual abuse.

Since 12 March 2020, all concerts were cancelled and virtual ones were held due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All concerts have since returned to in person.

Between 1905 and 1946, music directors of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (founded in 1895) also were engaged as music director of the biannual choral festival (Frank Van der Stucken, Ernst Kunwald, Eugène Ysaÿe, Fritz Reiner, and Eugene Goosens held the reins during those years). Fritz Busch and Josef Krips led festivals between 1948 and 1960.

With the appointment of Max Rudolf as director of the festival in 1963, the festival became an annual event in 1967, as it is today. In the 1970s, the centennial of both the festival (1973) and Music Hall (1978) was celebrated with the tenures of Julius Rudel (director from 1971 to 1973) and James Levine (1974 to 1978). James Conlon became director in 1979.

When Leonard Bernstein conducted the festival in its centennial year, he ascribed the true strength of the endeavor with his typical aplomb:

<text>Carlina vulgaris, the carline thistle, is a plant species of the genus &quot;Carlina&quot;.

It is a biennial that grows on limestone, chalky or other alkaline grasslands or dunes. The flowers are clusters of very small brown florets surrounded by brown-golden bracts. Both feel dry and spiky, so at first glance the plants appear to be dying when in full flower. The green leaves are spiny and may have hairs. Plants are often short but can reach 60 cm.

It originates from Europe, north Africa and Asia but is also found in other parts of the world such as North America. It is considered an invasive species in parts of its introduced range.

<text>Luiz Roberto de Barros Mott or Luiz Mott (born 6 May 1946) in São Paulo, is an anthropologist and a gay rights activist in Brazil.

== Early life ==
Luiz Mott graduated with a degree in Social Sciences from the University of São Paulo (USP) during the military regime, obtained a master&#x27;s degree in Ethnography from the Sorbonne and a doctorate in anthropology from the University of Campinas in São Paulo.

==Career==
Luiz Mott is professor emeritus of the Department of Anthropology of the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA). In his work Mott has traced homosexual desire in a number of indigenous Brazilian tribes such as the Bororo, Guató, Trumai, Tupinambá, Wai Wai and Xavante. He has also explored intimate partner violence between gay, transsexual and transgender people in Salvador, the capital of the Brazilian state of Bahia. In 1995, he declared that national hero Zumbi dos Palmares had been gay.

Alongside his academic work, Mott is also a gay rights activist and founded the in 1980. It was the first homosexual support group in Bahia and Mott ensured its survival by pressuring the municipal government to fund it. It published records of homophobic attacks, raised awareness of HIV/AIDS and organised a pride parade, workshops, educational events and protests. He also created Centro Baiano Anti-AIDS.

In 1993, he published the first account of the life of Rosa Egipcíaca, a religious mystic and formerly enslaved prostitute, who wrote the book &quot;Sagrada Teologia do Amor Divino das Almas Peregrinas,&quot; which was the first book to be written by a black woman in Brazil.

In 1995, he was awarded the Felipa de Souza Award by the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (now OutRight Action International). Mott commented to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2015: &quot;Brazil is an extremely contradictory country. On the one hand, we are a pink country, celebrating sexual diversity [..] then, there is another color, the red blood of victims.&quot;

<text>Social consciousness or social awareness, is collective consciousness shared by individuals within a society.

Social consciousness is linked to the collective self-awareness and experience of collectively shared social identity. From this viewpoint, social consciousness denotes conscious awareness of being part of an interrelated community of others. The “we feeling” or the “sense of us” may be experienced in members of various cultures and social groups. By the experience of collectively shared social identity, individuals may experience social unity. Social consciousness may also stimulate working towards a common goal.

According to Karl Marx, human beings enter into certain productive, or economic, relations and these relations lead to a form of social consciousness. Marx said:

<doc id="651232" wikidata="Q5054028" url="?curid=651232" title="Catskill High Peaks">
<text>The Catskill High Peaks are all of the mountains in New York&#x27;s Catskill Mountains above in elevation whose summits are separated either by &quot;or&quot; a vertical drop of at least between it and the next nearest separate summit. By usual standards, these mountains are rather low and rounded, and mostly covered by vegetation. 

Unlike the Adirondack High Peaks, those in the Catskills are more evenly distributed around the eastern half of the range instead of being confined to one small area. All except Bearpen and Vly lie within the Catskill Park Blue Line.

==The 3500s==

The elevation was chosen in the early 1950s when Dan Smiley, a descendant of the founders of Mohonk Mountain House and his fellow birders were trying to find the elusive Bicknell&#x27;s thrush, which prefers to nest and breed in the boreal forests that predominate above that elevation in the Catskills. They drew up a list nearly identical to the one below and published it in a naturalists&#x27; journal.

A decade later hikers interested in peak bagging formed the Catskill Mountain 3500 Club, an organization similar to the better-known Adirondack 46ers, to promote the climbing of 34 of the 35 peaks listed below (&quot;Southwest Hunter&quot; was added to the list in 1992). The club implemented the peak-separation rule, modeled on the one already in use by the Appalachian Mountain Club. Prospective members are required to climb all (13 have no established route to the summit, requiring a ) and then do Slide, Blackhead, Balsam and Panther mountains again in wintertime.

Today the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation enforces special rules for all the lands it manages in the Catskills above , whether tiny plots such as on Rocky or vast ridgetops as on Plateau, Hunter and West Kill, due to the fragility of the ecosystems. In these areas, camping is permitted only in dire emergencies except during winter, when snow shields the earth somewhat, and open fires are banned. Almost all were designated bird conservation areas by Governor George Pataki in 1999, due to Bicknell&#x27;s and other vulnerable species that return there in springtime to nest and breed.

== The high peaks ==

Surveys of the Catskills date to the 1940s at the newest, and exact elevations have never been officially determined for many of these peaks. In those cases, their elevations are indicated by the highest contour shown on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) quadrangles with a plus (+) sign.

: &quot;The name is currently unofficial. It refers to the peak that rises between Hunter and West Kill on the USGS Lexington quad&quot;

: &quot;This refers not to &quot;Bearpen Mountain&quot; shown on the USGS Prattsville quad straddling the border between Delaware and Greene counties at , but rather the unnamed higher area approximately one-half mile (800 m) to the southeast in Greene County.&quot;

==Potential High Peaks==
Without the aforementioned &quot;AND&quot; ruling of the Catskill 3500 Club, the unnamed summit west of Thomas Cole (unofficially referred to as &quot;Camel&#x27;s Hump&quot;) sits within the contour and is more than the required distance from that peak&#x27;s summit. No one has yet considered it a High Peak, however.

The inexact nature of past USGS surveys of the region have led to speculation that two summits in the western Catskills might prove to be High Peaks if measurements were redone with more modern technology. GPS readings on some summits have consistently suggested higher elevations than those given on the maps.

Mill Brook Ridge, the named summit of the pair, would displace neighboring Balsam Lake as the westernmost Catskill High Peak were any of the land in its summit contour found to exceed 3,500 feet. However, much of that land is as flat as the map suggests and the peak may come close to that height but not over it.

The other is &quot;East Schoolhouse Mountain,&quot; the unofficial name for the higher of the two peaks on the ridge between Balsam Lake and neighboring Graham. Digital Elevation Modeling (DEM) data in some mapping software suggests its summit may just exceed the limit.

There is also a tiny contour indicated more than a half-mile east of West Kill&#x27;s summit, right next to the drop into Diamond Notch, but exploration of that area has cast doubt on whether it actually exists.

<doc id="651234" wikidata="Q351802" url="?curid=651234" title="Jerry Stackhouse">
<text>Jerry Darnell Stackhouse (born November 5, 1974) is an American basketball coach and former professional player who is an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association. Stackhouse played college basketball for the North Carolina Tar Heels and played 18 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and was a two-time NBA All-Star. He was the head coach of Raptors 905 and an assistant coach for the Toronto Raptors and Memphis Grizzlies. Additionally, he has worked as an NBA TV analyst.

==Early career==
Stackhouse was a premier player from the time he was a sophomore in high school. He was the state player of the year for North Carolina in 1991–92, leading Kinston (N.C) High School to the state finals. His senior year, he played for Oak Hill Academy with future college teammate Jeff McInnis, leading them to an undefeated season. He was a two-time first team &quot;Parade&quot; All-America selection, and was the MVP of the McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game. At the 1992 Nike Camp, he and Rasheed Wallace were considered to be the top players at the camp. There were some who considered Stackhouse the top prep player to come out of North Carolina since Michael Jordan.

Stackhouse attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a teammate of future NBA players Wallace, McInnis and Shammond Williams. In his sophomore season at UNC, Stackhouse led the team in scoring with 19.2 points per game and averaged 8.2 rebounds per contest. He led UNC to a Final Four appearance and was named as the National Player of the Year by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and earned first-team All-America and All-ACC honors. While playing for the Tar Heels, he was coached by Dean Smith. Following the season, Stackhouse declared his eligibility for the 1995 NBA draft.

Although he left UNC after two years, he continued working on his degree and received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in African American Studies in 1999.

==NBA career==

===NBA draft===
Stackhouse was selected in the first round of the 1995 NBA draft with the third pick by the Philadelphia 76ers. At one time he was hyped as the &quot;Next Jordan&quot; since both players played at North Carolina, went #3 in the draft, were listed at 6&#x27;6&quot;, looked similar physically, and had similarly acrobatic games. Coincidentally, both had a taller power forward from UNC drafted immediately after them in the #4 spot, Sam Perkins in 1984, and Rasheed Wallace in 1995.

===Philadelphia 76ers (1995–1997)===
In his first season with the 76ers, Stackhouse led his team with a 19.2 points per game (PPG) average, and was named to the NBA&#x27;s All-Rookie team. In the 1996–97 season, the 76ers also drafted Allen Iverson. Combined, the two posted 44.2 points per game for the Sixers. Stackhouse represented the 76ers in the 1996 NBA Slam Dunk Contest.

===Detroit Pistons (1997–2002)===
Midway through the 1997–98 season, Stackhouse was dealt to the Detroit Pistons with Eric Montross for Theo Ratliff, Aaron McKie and future considerations. By the 1999–2000 season, his second full season with the Pistons, Stackhouse was averaging 23.6 points per game. A year later, he had a career-high average of 29.8 points per game. In a late season victory over the Chicago Bulls, he set the Pistons&#x27; franchise record and the league&#x27;s season high for points in a game with 57. In 2001 he led the NBA in total points scored, finishing 2nd in the PPG scoring title to his former 76er teammate, Allen Iverson. Stackhouse saw his final action as a Piston with Detroit&#x27;s elimination in the second round of the 2001–02 NBA playoffs to the Boston Celtics.

===Washington Wizards (2002–2004)===
During the 2002 offseason, Stackhouse was traded to the Washington Wizards in a six-player deal, also involving Richard Hamilton.

In his first season with Washington (2002–03), Stackhouse led the Wizards in points and assists per game with 21.5 and 4.5 respectively. Stackhouse became the only teammate to average more points per game than Michael Jordan for an entire season (Jordan averaged 20.0 points per game in 2002-03 which was his last season in the NBA). Stackhouse missed most of the 2003–04 season while recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee, playing in only 26 games.

In 2020 Stackhouse stated that he regretted playing with Jordan, as plays were being designed for an NBA legend who was past his prime, stalling Stackhouse&#x27;s All-Star momentum.

===Dallas Mavericks (2004–2009)===
In the 2004 offseason, Stackhouse—along with Christian Laettner and the Wizards&#x27; first-round draft pick (Devin Harris)—was traded to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for former Tar Heel and NBA All-Star Antawn Jamison. He did not play for 41 games during his first two seasons with Dallas due to groin and continued knee problems, and played mostly the role of sixth man. During the 2004–05 playoffs, Stackhouse began wearing pressure stockings during games to keep his legs warm, to aid his groin injury, and hold his thigh sleeves in place; the stockings also allowed for better blood flow to the legs. The practice quickly became a trend among NBA players, with Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James and others adopting pressure stockings the following season.

Stackhouse was still coming off the bench as the 6th man for the Dallas Mavericks during the 2005–06 NBA season. He was a significant factor in the NBA Finals series against the Miami Heat. The Mavericks suffered when Stackhouse was suspended for Game 5 for a flagrant foul on Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, and the Heat eventually won the series 4–2. Stackhouse was the third player from the Mavericks suspended during the 2006 playoffs.

===Milwaukee Bucks (2010)===
Stackhouse was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies on July 8, 2009, in a four-way trade. On the day after the trade, Stackhouse was waived by the Grizzlies. On January 17, 2010, the Milwaukee Bucks signed Stackhouse for the remainder of the 2009–10 season.

===Miami Heat (2010)===
On October 23, 2010, Stackhouse and the Miami Heat agreed to a contract.

On November 23, 2010, the Heat waived Stackhouse to make room for Erick Dampier who was signed to replace injured forward Udonis Haslem.

===Atlanta Hawks (2011–2012)===
On December 9, 2011, Stackhouse joined the Atlanta Hawks. Stackhouse was chosen to replace injured teammate Joe Johnson as Atlanta&#x27;s representative in the Haier Shooting Stars Competition during NBA All-Star weekend.

===Brooklyn Nets (2012–2013)===
On July 11, 2012, Stackhouse made a verbal agreement to sign a one-year, $1.3 million deal with the Nets. Stackhouse has worn the number 42 in honor of Jackie Robinson, his favorite athlete, and became the first professional athlete to wear the number 42 in Brooklyn since Robinson. On November 26, 2012, the Nets played the New York Knicks for the first time since the Nets had moved to Brooklyn. Stackhouse played 22 minutes and scored 14 points, including a tiebreaking 3-pointer in overtime, and the Nets went on to win. On March 18, 2013, he scored 10 points against the Detroit Pistons, one of his former teams.

After the Nets&#x27; first-round playoff loss to the Chicago Bulls, Stackhouse announced his retirement.

==Broadcasting career==
On November 15, 2013, it was announced that Stackhouse had joined Fox Sports Detroit as a Pistons analyst. He primarily provided studio analysis but also was the road color commentator for Fox Sports Detroit on select road trips. Stackhouse was also a college basketball analyst for the ACC Network and Fox Sports Detroit. By Joining Fox Sports Detroit, Stackhouse reunited with his former Pistons teammate Mateen Cleaves in the studio.

==Coaching career==

=== Toronto Raptors ===
On June 29, 2015, he was hired to serve as an assistant coach by the Toronto Raptors. During his first season with the Raptors, he helped the team finish second in the Eastern Conference along with reaching the Eastern Conference Finals.

=== Raptors 905 ===
On September 9, 2016, the Raptors named him head coach for Raptors 905, the franchise&#x27;s NBA Development League team. Stackhouse has aspirations of being an NBA head coach and told The Ringer that he hopes the D-League position will propel him to a head coaching job. Stackhouse led the 905 to a successful year during the 2016–17 season as the team was crowned champion of the NBA D-League. Stackhouse was named NBA D-League Coach of the Year in 2017.

=== Memphis Grizzlies ===
Stackhouse served as an assistant coach for the Memphis Grizzlies for the 2018–19 NBA season.

===Vanderbilt===
On April 5, 2019, Stackhouse was named the head coach of the Vanderbilt Commodores, signing a six-year contract. He was fired on March 14, 2024, after a disappointing 9–23 record in the 2024 season. Throughout his five seasons coaching the Commodores, he led the team to a 70–92 record and failed to make the NCAA Tournament.

=== Golden State Warriors ===
On September 27, 2024, Stackhouse was hired by the Golden State Warriors as an assistant coach under Steve Kerr.

==Personal life==

Stackhouse is the younger brother of former CBA player and Sacramento Kings and Boston Celtics forward Tony Dawson, and he is the uncle of former Wake Forest University guard Craig Dawson.

Stackhouse has performed the U.S. national anthem before Mavericks home games and during the Bucks&#x27; 2010 and the Nets&#x27; 2013 playoff appearances. Although formerly a Pescatarian, Stackhouse is now back to eating meat.

In 2017, Stackhouse completed the Harvard Business School executive education program on the Business of Entertainment, Media, and Sports.

<text>A straight ally, heterosexual ally, cisgender ally, or cis ally (often simply called an ally) is a heterosexual and cisgender person who supports equal civil rights, gender equality, and LGBTQ+ social movements. Individuals may meet this designation through their actions without actively identifying as an ally.

== Organizations ==
=== Gay-straight alliance ===
Most LGBTQ+ organizations have straight or cisgender members involved, while others actively encourage straight and cisgender participation. A good example of the change straight allies can help achieve is the gay-straight alliance (GSA) which has been becoming more popular in schools all around the world. A gay–straight alliance (also known as a gender-sexuality alliance) is a student-run club that brings together LGBTQ+ and straight students to create a platform for activism to fight homophobia and transphobia. The goal of most gay-straight alliances is to make their school community safe, facilitate activism on campus, and create a welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ students.

==== History ====
The first gay-straight alliance was formed in November 1988 at Concord Academy in Concord, Massachusetts, when Kevin Jennings, a history teacher at the school who had just come out as gay, was approached by Meredith Sterling, a straight student at the school who was upset by the treatment of gay students and others. Jennings recruited some other teachers at the school, thus forming the first gay-straight alliance. Jennings credits students for both the establishment of the club, as well as for setting the agenda of struggling against homophobia, and for changes to CA&#x27;s nondiscrimination policy. Jennings would go on to co-found the Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network (GLSEN) in Boston in 1990.

The GSA Network is an LGBT rights organization founded in 1998 by Carolyn Laub to empower youth activists to start GSA clubs in their respective schools to motivate and inspire fellow students to fight against homophobia and transphobia. Laub initially started working with this movement in 40 GSA clubs in the San Francisco Bay area during 1988–99 and then gradually expanded to other cities and states; by 2005, it began operating programs nationally.

==== Impact on students ====
Most of what has been written, academically, about LGBTQ+ youth has focused on non-normative development or risk outcomes. This focus has overshadowed and often-times disregarded the ways in which young LGBTQ+ people and their allies are actively engaged in creating positive change for themselves and their peers; for many young people, this active engagement is achieved through involvement and leadership in high school Gay-Straight Alliances. Adolescence is an important developmental period for individual engagement in community and social concerns; empowerment suggests that young people discover their capacity to become agents of change in issues and causes they care about. Sexuality activism has emerged as an important arena for youth activism, and offers a unique context in which to study youth empowerment.

Those most impacted by gay-straight alliances are LGBTQ+ students; however, gay and straight members alike are benefitted from the sense of community and empowerment that gay-straight alliances provide. In 1994, Anderson categorized gay youth as an &quot;at risk&quot; population. He believes that school-based support groups can help to counter the negative statistics in the lives of gay youth (homelessness, high school dropouts, drug and alcohol abuse, victims of physical violence, and suicide). Participants in this study experienced some of the hopelessness and despair common to gay youth, but they also became empowered young people through their association with the GSA. Being a part of the GSA helped them to move beyond the depressing statistics and gain stronger identities. Their new identities were expressed in their educational lives as well as their personal and social lives. They became empowered by working toward a collective goal: challenging the system in which they previously believed they could not have an impact&quot;.

==== Impact on society ====
According to many studies, involvement in high school gay-straight alliances leads to more civically active young adults. &quot;The current study demonstrated significant associations between GSA involvement level and forms of civic engagement, including efforts to counter discrimination and raise others&#x27; awareness of LGBTQ issues. Our findings highlight the promising role that GSAs could play in building civic engagement capacity among their members. Ultimately, as active and engaged citizens, LGBTQ youth and their allies could play a major role in challenging oppressive systems and promoting social justice for LGBTQ individuals in society&quot;.

=== PFLAG ===
Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG), an international nonprofit organization, works to support LGBTQ+ people and their loved ones. Stemming from parents&#x27; desire to be involved in their gay and lesbian children&#x27;s struggle for equality, PFLAG has been a resource for countless families since 1973. Founded by Jeanne Manford, who is considered the mother of the ally movement, PFLAG unites LGBTQ+ people with parents, families, and allies to gain full civil and legal equality for people in the LGBTQ+ community. In 2007, the organization launched a new project, Straight for Equality to help more allies become engaged with the movement in the workplace, healthcare, and now in faith communities.

&quot;Despite the exclusion of &quot;bisexual&quot; and &quot;transgender&quot; from the organization&#x27;s name, PFLAG works for the rights of these sexual minorities as well, providing education on gender identification along with sexual orientation. PFLAG&#x27;s policy statements on such issues as legislation, equality in the workplace, hate crimes, same-gender marriage, religious affiliation, and comprehensive sex education all reflect its deep commitment to ensuring the rights of all lgbtq people&quot;.

=== GLAAD ===
GLAAD was established by a group of reporters after an article talked down on HIV/AIDS, being officially founded in 1985. GLAAD put pressure on media organizations to end what it saw as homophobic reporting. Over the years, GLAAD has expanded its resources to provide change for LGBTQ+ members and allies. &quot;As a dynamic media force, GLAAD ensures fair, accurate, and inclusive representation that rewrites the script for LGBTQ acceptance. GLAAD tackles tough issues to shape the narrative and provoke dialogue that leads to cultural change. GLAAD protects all that has been accomplished and envisions a world with 100% LGBTQ acceptance. GLAAD works through entertainment, news, and digital media to share stories from the LGBTQ community that accelerate acceptance&quot;.

===LGBTQQIAAP===
A second A was added to the abbreviation to stand for Ally though this use is sometimes controversial. Sometimes the acronym is spelled LGBTQQIAAP.

== Historical background ==

=== The Stonewall Uprising ===
The Stonewall Uprising, or the Stonewall riots of 1969 (in New York City), is known to be the starting point of the Gay Liberation Front. Protests, advocacy organizations, HIV/AIDS relief groups, etc. collectively have characterized the movement from the start. The Stonewall Uprising, a series of events between police and LGBTQ+ protesters that stretched over six days, became well known due to the media coverage and the subsequent annual Pride traditions. &quot;Stonewall veterans have explicitly stated that they prefer the term Stonewall uprising or rebellion. The reference to these events as riots was initially used by police to justify their use of force. Early publications show that the LGBTQIA+ community largely did not use the term riot until years after the fact&quot;.

&quot;The criminalization of homosexuality led many gay establishments to operate sans liquor license, providing an open door for raids and police brutality. Like many gay establishments at the time, the Stonewall Inn was owned by the mafia, and as long as they continued to make a profit, they cared very little what happened to their clientele. Because the owners were still making a profit, they simply adjusted to the raids, and were often tipped off about them ahead of time&quot;. The Stonewall Inn remains both as a gay bar and a statement against the violence that it has survived, and has even become a National Historic Landmark. The Stonewall Inn continues to make strides within the LGBTQ+ community with its nonprofit charity. &quot;The Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative is ... dedicated to providing educational, strategic and financial assistance to grassroots organizations committed to advocacy for and crucial support to LGBTQ communities and individuals who suffer the indignities and fear arising from social intolerance here in the United States and around the world&quot;.

=== Liberationists ===
In the 1970s, a divide emerged within the community over opposing beliefs on what liberation truly meant: the &quot;liberationists&quot; and the &quot;homophiles&quot;.

Liberationists presented themselves as being considerably radical; their intent lay in going beyond acceptance and transforming traditional constructs of society (homophobia, sexism, militarism, etc.).

In contrast, homophiles aimed only for what was deemed realistic; instead of dismantling an oppressive system, they simply asked for tolerance. Their group maintained an apologist standpoint, where their end goal was living in peaceful coexistence with the oppressor. This assimilationist perspective held particular appeal with members of the community who were able to &quot;blend in&quot; with heterosexual society.

The existence of such a group left room for a movement that was more sensitive to the struggles, needs, and ultimate goals of more marginalized subcultures. The liberationists, who seemed to be drawing in members of such groups, filled this need.

The emergence of the Liberationists allowed for a wider spectrum of sexual-social behavior and identity to be represented without compromise, and with less risk of infighting. Members of the latter group would not feel forced to conform to the more socially conservatives mores of the former group, while they were able to separate themselves from elements of the gay subculture that they had found crass, excessive, decadent, or extreme.

== Challenges raised ==

=== Partnership ===
Partnership with straight allies has raised challenges as well as benefits for the LGBTQ+ community: there is a perception that such allies evince different levels of &#x27;respect&#x27; for the community on whose behalf they advocate, sometimes being patronizing, unaware of their own privilege and power, and crowding out the members. Given that distinguishing between speaking on behalf of a group and speaking for a group is not simple, that line is often crossed without even noticing. This grey area can be referred to as &#x27;positive respect&#x27;; a sort of force found in an ally&#x27;s motives that inhibits the &#x27;servile&#x27; (as a result of their internalized oppression) group&#x27;s freedom to act.

=== Scrutiny ===
Another challenge is that straight allies can be easily discouraged, in the face of scrutiny of their motives and approaches. Newer straight allies can become overwhelmed or confused by the complication of their position in the movement. Since newer allies derive their identity from their personal relations with queer-identifying people, this limits their allyship. Some allies can sometimes respond very defensively to criticism from members of the queer community about their understanding of queer issues, which in turn feeds a concern that they are motivated by the praise they anticipate as their moral reward. Additionally, there is a coming out process for being a straight ally that is not explicitly present in other social movements (concerns about being seen as LGBTQ+); this can hinder the level of advocacy an ally does. In other words, allyship requires support that is accompanied by a distinct protocol many find challenging to achieve. Straight allies protesting at Seattle March for Marriage Equality Allies may receive criticism for a variety of reasons. For example, some believe that allies are unable to step outside their own heteronormative world to advocate. Allies are also criticized for using LGBT advocacy as a means to gain popularity and status.

== Role in policy change ==
Studies show that elite allies have a positive effect on the policy goals of a social movement, whatever those goals may be. While allies&#x27; main role is to provide wider support for the goals of a social movement, their secondary role of influencing policy is also valuable. The allies&#x27; role is to inform policymakers of the struggles endured by a community. Allyship of this kind is often effective, though self-interested; for example, high-ranking, conservative government officials Barry Goldwater and William Weld (former Republican governor of Massachusetts), were motivated by their relations with queer family and friends to provide uncharacteristic support for pro-gay policies.

<doc id="651254" wikidata="Q4703900" url="?curid=651254" title="Al Gore 2000 presidential campaign">
<text>The 2000 presidential campaign of Al Gore, the 45th vice president of the United States under President Bill Clinton, began when he announced his candidacy for the presidency of the United States in Carthage, Tennessee, on June 16, 1999. Gore became the Democratic nominee for the 2000 presidential election on August 17, 2000.

On November 7, 2000, projections indicated that Gore&#x27;s opponent, then-Governor of Texas George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, had narrowly won the election. Gore won the national popular vote but lost the Electoral College vote after a legal battle over disputed vote counts in the state of Florida. Bush won the state of Florida in the initial count and also in each subsequent recount at the time. While a NORC study of uncounted ballots released on November 12, 2001, found that with a full statewide hand recount, Gore may have won Florida under revised vote standards (depending on which standard was used, his margin of victory would have varied from 60 to 171 votes), under rules devised by the Florida Supreme Court and accepted by the Gore campaign at the time, Bush would likely have won the recount.

The legal dispute was ultimately resolved by the Supreme Court of the United States in a 5–4 decision. Bush won the election by 537 votes in Florida, and won the electoral college vote of 271 to 266. One elector pledged to Gore did not cast an electoral vote; Gore received 267 pledged electors. The election was one of the most controversial in American history.

==Announcement and Democratic primaries==

===CNN interview===
Prior to his announcement that he would be running in the 2000 election, Gore participated in a March 9, 1999, interview for CNN&#x27;s &quot;Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer&quot;. Gore stated in the interview, &quot;During my service in the United States Congress I took the initiative in creating the internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country&#x27;s economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system.&quot; Former UCLA professor of information studies, Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert both argue that three articles in &quot;Wired News&quot; led to the creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have &quot;invented the Internet&quot;, which followed this interview. This urban legend became &quot;an automatic laugh. Jay Leno, David Letterman, or any other comedic talent can crack a joke about Al Gore &#x27;inventing the Internet,&#x27; and the audience is likely to respond with howls of laughter.&quot;
In response to the controversy, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn argued that they didn&#x27;t think, &quot;as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he &#x27;invented&#x27; the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore&#x27;s initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet.&quot;

Gore would later poke fun at the controversy on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; when he read Letterman&#x27;s Top 10 List, which for this show was called, &quot;Top Ten Rejected Gore - Lieberman Campaign Slogans&quot;. Number nine on the list was: &quot;Remember, America, I gave you the Internet, and I can take it away!&quot; A few years later, on June 6, 2005, Gore was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award &quot;for three decades of contributions to the Internet&quot; at the Webby Awards.

===Announcement===
There was talk of a potential run for president by Gore as early as January 1998.

Gore formally announced his candidacy for president on June 16, 1999, in Carthage, Tennessee. He was introduced by his eldest daughter, Karenna Gore, who was pregnant at the time with her first child. The speech was &quot;briefly interrupted&quot; by AIDS protesters claiming Gore was working with the pharmaceutical industry to prevent access to generic medicines for poor nations. Additional speeches were also interrupted by the protesters. Gore responded, &quot;I love this country. I love the First Amendment ... Let me say in response to those who may have chosen an inappropriate way to make their point, that actually the crisis of AIDS in Africa is one that should command the attention of people in the United States and around the world.&quot; In making the announcement, Gore also distanced himself from Bill Clinton, whom he stated had lied to him. In an interview for &quot;20/20&quot; Gore stated, &quot;What he did was inexcusable, and particularly as a father, I felt that it was terribly wrong.&quot;

===Primaries===
Gore faced an early challenge by former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley. Bradley was the only candidate to oppose Gore and was considered a &quot;fresh face&quot; for the White House. Bradley, in comparing himself with the current administration, argued that &quot;One of the reasons I&#x27;m running for president is to restore trust and public service and confidence in our collective will.&quot; By the fall of 1999, a number of polls showed Bradley running even with the Vice President in key primary states.&quot; Gore responded by switching his campaign headquarters from Washington, D.C., to Nashville, Tennessee, in an effort to further distance himself from Bill Clinton. Gore then challenged Bradley to a series of debates which took the form of &quot;town hall&quot; meetings. Gore went on the offensive during these debates leading to a drop in the polls for Bradley. Gore eventually went on to win every primary and caucus and in March 2000, secured the Democratic nomination.

====Joe Lieberman and nomination====
In August 2000, Gore announced that he had selected Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as his vice presidential running mate. Lieberman became &quot;the first person of the Jewish faith to run for the nation&#x27;s second-highest office&quot; (Barry Goldwater, who ran for president in 1964, was of &quot;Jewish origin&quot;). Lieberman, who was a more conservative Democrat than Gore, had publicly blasted President Clinton for the Monica Lewinsky affair. Many pundits saw Gore&#x27;s choice of Lieberman as another way of trying to distance himself from the scandals of the Clinton White House. However, Lieberman voted against Clinton&#x27;s removal from office in both counts. Lieberman was selected from a group of potential running mates that included Senators John Kerry from Massachusetts and John Edwards from North Carolina, both of whom eventually became the Democratic nominees four years later.

Gore&#x27;s daughter, Karenna, together with her father&#x27;s former Harvard roommate Tommy Lee Jones, officially nominated Gore as the Democratic presidential candidate during the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Gore accepted his party&#x27;s nomination and spoke about the major themes of his campaign, stating in particular his plan to extend Medicare to pay for prescription drugs, to work for a sensible universal health-care system.

===Campaign trail and platform===
Soon after the convention, with running mate Joe Lieberman, Gore hit the campaign trail. He and Bush were deadlocked in the polls.

During his first presidential run in 1988, Gore ran his campaign as &quot;a Southern centrist, [who] opposed federal funding for abortion. He favored a moment of silence for prayer in the schools and voted against banning the interstate sale of handguns.&quot; Gore&#x27;s policies changed substantially during the 2000 campaign, reflecting his eight years as vice president. According to an article by PBS, Gore promised to appoint pro-choice judges with more liberal leanings. Gore appointees are more likely to support gay rights and maintain a separation between religion and government. Gore vowed to maintain a firm distinction between Church and State, and did not focus on religion as a major issue. However, Gore did promote government partnerships with faith-based groups. His running mate, Senator Joe Lieberman, was an observant Jew who often talked about increasing the role of religion in public life. During Gore&#x27;s eight years as vice president, the Clinton administration appointed 150 gay people to government posts. Al Gore said he wanted to lift the &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy on LGBT people in the military, which was supported by President Clinton. Gore also promised to work toward expanding gay rights, and supports legislation such as the &quot;Hate Crime Prevention Act&quot; that would broaden the definition of hate crimes to include crimes committed against gay people.

====Economic platform====
Al Gore&#x27;s platform pledged to &quot;keep our economy strong by building on the careful fiscal policies of the last seven years&quot;.

====National debt and Social Security====
The platform included a plan to pay off the national debt by 2012. Gore&#x27;s platform stated: &quot;This fiscally-disciplined approach assures that our children will not be saddled with debt - and the enormous annual interest burden on that debt - and the costs of paying for the Baby Boomers&#x27; retirement.&quot; Gore&#x27;s balanced budget plan also devoted the $2.3 trillion social security surplus exclusively to social security and the national debt, thereby extending solvency &quot;through at least 2054&quot;.

====Medicare &quot;lock box&quot;====
Gore&#x27;s platform involved creating a &quot;Medicare lock box&quot; designed so that Medicare payroll taxes could only be used to strengthen Medicare and pay down the national debt.

=====Tax cuts=====
Gore proposed a $500 billion package of targeted tax cuts, &quot;to afford quality child care, higher education and lifelong learning, health insurance and long-term care for an aging or disabled relative&quot;.

=====Trust funds=====
Gore called for the establishment of &quot;three new trust funds to improve and expand access to affordable health care, dramatically improve education, and clean up [America&#x27;s] environment&quot;. The environmental trust fund would use market-based mechanisms to target the transportation, electric power generation and industrial production sectors of the economy.

=====Investing in technology=====
Gore&#x27;s plan called for increased investment in biotechnology, information technology, a university research ideas &quot;which are later turned into benefits that we all enjoy such as high-speed wireless networks that can provide telemedicine, distance learning, and electronic commerce to remote rural communities; supercomputers that can dramatically increase our ability to predict tornadoes and hurricanes; and computers that are much easier to use, and can &#x27;understand&#x27; human language; new research leading to the design of effective drugs and a speed-up of the time it takes to find important new treatments and cures&quot;. These investments were considered &quot;a vital element of preserving and expanding America&#x27;s prosperity&quot;.

=====Investing in communities=====
Gore&#x27;s platform included measures aimed at &quot;revitalizing distressed communities&quot;. This included creating and funding more empowerment zones and enterprise communities (EZs and ECs), tax credits and grants as part of the New Markets Initiative, and $35 million increased funding for the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund.

=====Trade=====
Gore called for opening markets to &quot;spur innovation, speed the growth of new industries, and make [American] businesses more competitive&quot;, but also stressed the need to &quot;negotiate worker rights, human rights, and environmental protections&quot;, stating: &quot;we should use trade to lift up standards around the world not drag down standards here at home&quot;.

=====Defense=====
Gore&#x27;s economic platform also contained a section entitled &quot;Keep Our Defense Strong and Protect Americans Abroad&quot;, in which he stated his intention to &quot;use part of the surplus to make reasonable increases in military spending - targeted to improve benefits and quality of life for servicemen and women, improve force readiness and provide the most modern equipment&quot;.

===Debates===
Gore and Bush participated in three televised debates. A Gallup debate-reaction survey taken right after the first debate found that viewers felt Gore won the debate by 48 percent to 41. Media analysis focused on the presentation style of each of the candidates. Issues of style and presentation would continue to be a theme throughout the election. Stuart Rothemberg analyzed the debate and declared that Bush appeared to be a deer in the headlights&#x27; in the first debate. But the governor was relaxed and authentic, and he seemed at ease on the same stage with the sitting vice president ... Gore may have been more aggressive on issues, and he surely was more detailed. But the vice president also looked and sounded about as appealing as a case of the flu. His makeup was terrible, and his comments sounded canned. Gore has always had problems sounding natural, and his first debate performance made him look like a phony politician, not a sincere leader.&quot; After three days of such analysis, support for Gore went from a pre-debate lead by 8 points to a tie of 43 percent for both candidates. After the second debate, Gore was criticized as too &quot;reticent&quot; while Bush was &quot;relaxed and self-confident.&quot; Finally, critics argued that Gore&#x27;s performance during the third debate was too aggressive.

==Florida recount and &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;==

On election night, news networks first called Florida for Gore, later retracted the projection, and then called Florida for Bush, before finally retracting that projection as well. Florida Secretary of State Republican Katherine Harris eventually certified the Florida count. This led to the Florida election recount, a move to further examine the Florida results. The Florida recount was stopped a few weeks later by the Supreme Court of the United States. In the ruling, &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;, the Florida recount was called unconstitutional and that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by the December 12 deadline, effectively ending the recounts. This 7–2 vote ruled that the standards the Florida Supreme Court provided for a recount as unconstitutional due to violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and further ruled 5–4 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by the December 12 deadline. This case ordered an end to recounting underway in selected Florida counties, effectively giving George W. Bush a 534-vote victory in Florida and consequently Florida&#x27;s 25 electoral votes and the presidency. The results of the decision led to Gore winning the popular vote by approximately 500,000 votes nationwide, but receiving 266 electoral votes (1 DC Elector abstained) to Bush&#x27;s 271.

Gore strongly disagreed with the Court&#x27;s decision, but in a widely praised concession speech, co-written with his chief White House and campaign speechwriter Eli Attie, Gore said, &quot;for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.&quot;

In the introduction to his global warming presentation, Gore later jokingly introduced himself as &quot;the former next President of the United States&quot;. Gore became the fourth candidate in American history to win the popular vote but lose the electoral vote after Andrew Jackson, Samuel Tilden, and Grover Cleveland. Hillary Clinton, the First Lady during Gore&#x27;s vice presidency and later a US Senator and Secretary of State, would subsequently become the fifth such candidate over a decade later, in 2016.

==Transition planning==

A presidential transition was contingently planned from Clinton to Gore in accordance to occur in the event Gore was elected president. It would have been a &quot;friendly takeover&quot;, in which the outgoing president and the incoming president are of the same political party. Since Gore lost the 2000 election to Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush, this transition never went into effect.

Months before the election, transition planning began, with Al Gore appointing Roy Neel to lead the planning effort.

On November 9, Neel announced that all transition planning would be paused by the Gore team. With the result of the election remaining in flux, for some time, Gore would keep this pause on transition planning. Contrarily, Bush proceeded with his transition efforts. Gore&#x27;s camp criticized this as Bush&#x27;s team rushing to declare a victory before the election result had even been decided.

Unlike Bush, who would have to start from scratch to form an administration, Gore had many top-aides for which he had had input in hiring already in place in Clinton&#x27;s White House. A Gore transition, unlike a Bush transition would be a &quot;friendly transition&quot;, with the same political party remaining in control of the executive branch.

In late November, with the inauguration day ever nearing, Gore began resuming work on his transition effort. The Clinton administration would attempt to treat it as though two different presidential transitions were taking place simultaneously. The FBI began conducting background checks for each transition team&#x27;s potential appointees. Resuming work on his transition, Gore, Lieberman, and Neel gathered a small group of associates and aides, which included Katie McGinty, Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman, Gore&#x27;s chief of staff Charles Burson, and Gore&#x27;s national security adviser Leon Fuerth to work on planning activities. They created preliminary lists of nominees for top administration roles. Gore and Lieberman also consulted with individuals such as AFL–CIO president John Sweeney and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson. On November 23, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on Neel making moves related to potential Cabinet picks. On November 24, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Gore had met at Number One Observatory Circle with Lieberman, Neel, William M. Daley, and Leon Fuerth to discuss transition plans.

Gore&#x27;s transition effort ended when Bush became president-elect after the &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; decision.

==Aftermath==

===Theories===
There were a number of theories connected to Gore&#x27;s loss. Gore, according to a 2002 NPR article, attributed it to &quot;the economic downturn and stock market slide that began earlier that year.&quot; His running mate, Joe Lieberman, criticized Gore for adopting a populist theme, stating that he had objected to Gore&#x27;s &quot;people vs. the powerful&quot; message, as he believed that it was not the best strategy for a sitting Vice President (Lieberman also stated that he would still endorse Gore if he decided to run for the 2004 election). Other critics attributed Gore&#x27;s loss in part to Green Party candidate Ralph Nader who garnered 2.7% of the vote, enough of whose votes which they argued might have otherwise gone to Gore to swing the result.

Another theory suggests that Al Gore attempted to run a populist campaign but failed to separate himself from the abuses of the Clinton presidency. The public was not able to forget the Campaign fund raising controversy at the Hsi Lai Temple 1996 United States campaign finance controversy. There is also a theory concerning Al Gore&#x27;s first campaign interviews on CNN.

However, it has been acknowledged that Gore&#x27;s decision to distance himself from Clinton—whose Gallup approval ratings were well above 50% throughout the year—was a costly mistake for his campaign.

===Television appearances===
A few years later, Gore began to make a number of television appearances in which he displayed a willingness to poke fun at himself, such as in episodes of &quot;Futurama&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Some argued that this was evidence that he was &quot;presenting a whole new side of himself&quot; to contradict the perception of a persona &quot;often associated with stiffness and caution.&quot; There was further speculation that it was indicative of a 2004 presidential run.

===HBO film===
The election is the subject of a 2008 made-for-TV movie directed by Jay Roach, produced by, and starring Kevin Spacey called &quot;Recount.&quot; It premiered on the HBO cable network on May 25, 2008.

<text>Lamar Joseph Odom (born November 6, 1979) is an American former professional basketball player. As a member of the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA), he won championships in 2009 and 2010 and was named the NBA Sixth Man of the Year in 2011.

In high school, Odom received national player of the year honors from &quot;Parade&quot; in 1997. He played college basketball for the University of Rhode Island, earning all-conference honors during his only season in the Atlantic 10 Conference before turning professional. The Los Angeles Clippers selected Odom with the fourth overall pick in the first round of the 1999 NBA draft. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Team in the following year; it was during his four seasons with the Clippers, however, that he was twice suspended for violating the league&#x27;s anti-drug policy. As a restricted free agent, he then signed with the Miami Heat, where he played the 2003–04 season before being traded to the Lakers. Odom spent seven seasons with the Lakers, who traded him to the Dallas Mavericks in 2011. After the move, his career declined. He was traded back to the Clippers in 2012 and played briefly in Spain in 2014.

Odom played on the United States national team, winning a bronze medal in the Olympics in 2004 and a gold medal in the FIBA World Championship (later known as the World Cup) in 2010.

Odom was married to Khloé Kardashian from 2009 to 2016. During their marriage, Odom made several appearances on the reality television show &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot;. He and Kardashian also had their own reality series, &quot;Khloé &amp; Lamar&quot;. In October 2015, Odom was hospitalized in a comatose state after being discovered unconscious in a Nevada brothel. He later sought treatment for drug and alcohol addiction.

==Early life==
Odom was born in South Jamaica, Queens, New York City, to Joe Odom and Cathy Mercer. His father was a heroin addict. His mother died of colon cancer when he was only 12 years old. On her deathbed, she reportedly told him: &quot;Be nice to everybody.&quot; Odom was afterwards raised by his maternal grandmother, Mildred Mercer.

In his first three years of high school, Odom played for Christ the King Regional High School in Middle Village, Queens. He left the school at the start of his senior year due to poor grades, transferring first to Redemption Christian Academy in Troy, New York, and then to the now-defunct St. Thomas Aquinas High School in New Britain, Connecticut, where he was coached by Jerry DeGregorio. As a senior, Odom was recognized nationally as the &quot;Parade&quot; Player of the Year in 1997. Among other distinctions, he earned &quot;USA Today&quot; All-USA First Team honors and was named to the &quot;Parade&quot; All-American First Team for the second consecutive year. While still in high school, Odom played on the same AAU team as future NBA teammates Elton Brand and Ron Artest (later known as Metta World Peace); he also played at the Adidas ABCD Camp with future Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant. Adidas executive Sonny Vaccaro commented at the time that Odom possessed a &quot;$2 million smile&quot;.

==College career==
Though he considered entering the NBA directly from high school and consulted Kobe Bryant as a player who had made that jump, Odom ultimately decided that he was not ready and committed to the University of Nevada at Las Vegas instead. However, a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; story questioning the validity of his ACT score and an arrest for soliciting prostitution provided the school cause enough to revoke his scholarship, and for this reason, he never played for the Runnin&#x27; Rebels. To the university&#x27;s further embarrassment, an investigation by the NCAA would later reveal that Odom had received $5,600 in illicit payments from one of its boosters, resulting in the firing of Coach Bill Bayno and UNLV being placed on probation for four years.

Odom transferred to the University of Rhode Island, with the cost of his room and board being covered by funds his father received from the G.I. Bill. Since he was admitted as a non-matriculating student, Odom was forced to sit out the 1997–98 season. After two semesters and a summer session, however, Odom earned his eligibility to play intramural basketball. His career at Rhode Island had been in some jeopardy during his first semester after he once vanished before finals; that is until coach Jim Harrick prevailed upon three of his four instructors to let him make up his extant work. The coach also had Odom work alongside DeGregorio, who had become a Rams assistant and ended up being the player&#x27;s closest friend in college. Odom also drew inspiration from the example of his maternal grandmother, a nurse who had raised five children and returned to school to earn her degree in 1980 at the age of 56.

Odom played one season (1998–99) for Rhode Island, during which he averaged 17.6 points per game and led the Rams to the conference championship. He earned First Team All-Conference honors and was named the Atlantic 10 Rookie of the Year. He was named the most valuable player of the Atlantic 10 tournament after his three-point shot at the buzzer against Temple gave the Rams their first A-10 title.

==Professional career==
===Los Angeles Clippers (1999–2003)===

Odom declared his eligibility for the 1999 NBA draft after his freshman year at Rhode Island. He then tried to return to college, thinking he was not ready for the NBA; but having already signed with an agent, he was no longer eligible to withdraw from the draft. Odom was selected by the Los Angeles Clippers with the fourth overall pick. In his first season with the Clippers, Odom averaged 16.6 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 4.2 assists per game. He put up 30 points and tore down 12 rebounds in his NBA debut. He was named to the 2000 NBA All-Rookie First Team.

In the 2000–01 season, Odom increased his scoring average to 17.2 points a game as he started in 74 games. The Clippers again failed to make the playoffs, however, as the young team could not improve their positioning in the Western Conference. In March 2001, Odom was suspended for five games for violating the terms of the NBA&#x27;s anti-drug policy. In the following season, he was suspended in November for yet another infraction of the anti-drug policy, his second offense in eight months. He admitted to using marijuana after the suspension. Odom only played 29 games during the season, and his production slipped.

He would only play in 49 games during the 2002–03 season, and would become a restricted free agent the following summer. The Miami Heat offered a deal that the Clippers declined to match after already matching another offer the Heat made to Elton Brand.

===Miami Heat (2003–2004)===
The Heat had won only 25 games the previous season but had drafted young talent such as Dwyane Wade and Caron Butler. Odom was brought on to play as the team&#x27;s starting power forward. Along with a budding Wade and the veteran Eddie Jones, Odom shared the scoring load, scoring 17.1 points to go with a career-high 9.7 rebounds per game. Despite an inauspicious start to the season where they lost seven consecutive games, the Heat ended up playing much better and even competing for a seed in the playoffs. On March 6, Odom posted a triple-double, scoring 30 points with 19 rebounds and 11 assists in a home win over the Sacramento Kings. The Heat would go on to clinch the fourth seed in the playoffs and face off against the New Orleans Hornets in the first round. Each team won at home, but the Heat would win a seventh deciding game to advance to the second round and face a top-seeded Indiana Pacers team. The Pacers won the first two games in Indiana, but the Heat responded with two consecutive home wins, including a game 4 victory that was led by Odom&#x27;s 22 points. The Pacers&#x27; breadth of experience proved too much for the younger Heat, however, as they claimed games 5 and 6 to win the series. All in all, Odom had a solid season compared to his previous one with the Clippers.

After the season, Odom was traded in a package with Caron Butler and Brian Grant to the Los Angeles Lakers for All-Star Shaquille O&#x27;Neal.

===Los Angeles Lakers (2004–2011)===

In his first year with the Los Angeles Lakers, Odom incurred a left shoulder injury that forced him to miss the end of the 2004–05 season. Despite Odom averaging 15.2 points and a career-high 10.2 rebounds, the Lakers finished out of the playoffs for only the 5th time in franchise history. Following the 2004–05 season, they re-hired former coach Phil Jackson.

In the first half of the 2005–06 season, Odom showed signs of inconsistency. However, as Los Angeles progressed towards the end of the season, his performance steadily improved. Along the way, he posted consecutive triple-doubles for the first time as a Laker in games against the Golden State Warriors and the Portland Trail Blazers. The Lakers were eliminated in 7 games in their first round playoffs matchup against the Phoenix Suns, having blown a 3–1 series lead. Odom averaged 14.8 points and 9.2 rebounds during the season and increased his scoring (19.1) and rebounds (11) in seven playoff contests.

Battling injuries, Odom was limited to 56 games in 2006–07, but finished with an average of 15.9 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. In a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s series, the Lakers were again defeated by the Suns in the first round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs.

After young center Andrew Bynum had gone down with a knee injury and Pau Gasol was acquired amid the 2007–08 season, Odom stepped up his production, as he posted averages of 15.3 points, 12 rebounds, and 4 assists across 36 games. He would finish that season averaging 14.2 points, 10.6 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per contest. In the 2008 NBA Finals, however, his numbers would decline to 13.5 points, 9 rebounds, and 3 assists per game, with the Lakers falling to the Boston Celtics.

In 2008–09, Odom arrived to training camp out of shape. Jackson later disclosed his plan to move Odom to the bench as their sixth man, backing up the Lakers&#x27; frontcourt consisting of Gasol, Bynum, and Trevor Ariza. A free agent after the season, Odom initially balked at the prospect of playing as a reserve for the first time in his career. But he came around to the assignment soon enough, having resolved to sacrifice his own numbers to make his teammates happy and in hopes of securing his first NBA championship. In January, after Bynum got injured in a game against the Memphis Grizzlies, Odom returned to the starting lineup. Over the month of February, he averaged 16.5 points and 13.4 rebounds while playing 36 minutes a night. This February run included a standout performance at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. The 15 points Odom scored in the third quarter helped the Lakers turn a 12-point deficit to a 10-point victory, ending Cleveland&#x27;s 23-game home winning streak in the process. Odom finished the game with 28 points, 17 rebounds, and 2 assists.
When Bynum returned to the hardwood for a home game against the Denver Nuggets, on the 9th of April, Odom adjusted back into his sixth-man role. Odom finished the season with 11.3 points, 8.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 1.0 steals, and 1.3 blocks with 29.7 minutes per contest. He won his first NBA championship when the Lakers defeated the Orlando Magic in the 2009 NBA Finals.

Over the 2009 offseason, Odom was heavily courted by his former franchise, the Miami Heat. Despite pleas from Heat guard Dwyane Wade and Heat executive Pat Riley, Kobe Bryant was optimistic that Odom would return to Los Angeles, reasoning that he would prefer to team up with newly acquired asset and fellow New Yorker Ron Artest. On July 31, 2009, after a month of tedious negotiations, the Lakers announced that they had made a four-year, $33 million deal with Odom. The investment paid off as Odom would play a crucial role for the Lakers on their way to another NBA Championship, with the team winning over the Boston Celtics in the 2010 NBA Finals.

Odom continued his strong play for the Lakers with another solid season in 2010–11, as he posted career-highs in both three-point shooting percentage (.382) and overall field goal percentage (.530). He started 35 games in Bynum&#x27;s absence during the season and averaged 16.3 points and 10.2 rebounds in those games. In 47 games off the bench, Odom averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds in 28.4 minutes. Meeting the requirement to come in as a reserve more games than he started, Odom was awarded the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award, becoming the first player in Lakers history to do so. Bryant called it Odom&#x27;s most &quot;consistent season&quot;.

During the offseason, Odom considered taking a break from basketball after a close cousin of his was murdered and he himself was a passenger in a SUV involved in an accident that tragically killed a teenage cyclist. The car accident had occurred the day after Odom attended his cousin&#x27;s funeral.

===Dallas Mavericks (2011–2012)===
On December 11, 2011, Odom was traded to the Dallas Mavericks, the defending NBA champions, for a first-round draft pick and an $8.9 million trade exception after NBA Commissioner David Stern vetoed a proposed three-team trade that would have sent Odom and Houston Rockets teammates Kevin Martin, Luis Scola, and Goran Dragić to the New Orleans Hornets; Chris Paul to the Lakers; and Pau Gasol to the Houston Rockets. Odom felt &quot;disrespected&quot; after he learned of the Hornets trade publicly, and he requested a trade from the Lakers to another contending team. The Lakers were also concerned that Odom&#x27;s contract was pricey since he was not needed to initiate the triangle offense with Mike Brown replacing Phil Jackson as Lakers coach.

In January 2012, Sports Illustrated reported that &quot;Odom [had] yet to find his niche in Dallas. His struggles [made] him a frequent target of [Mavericks coach Rick] Carlisle, who [harped] on Odom&#x27;s need to understand the coverages, be more alert, communicate and get in better shape ... Team sources say Odom ... appeared stressed by what they believe [was] the mental burden of an overwhelming offseason.&quot; On March 2, 2012, Odom was assigned to the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League. He had missed the prior three games for personal reasons. His stint with the Legends was canceled on March 3, 2012, and he returned to the Mavs&#x27; active roster. On March 24, Odom did not play in a 104–87 loss to the San Antonio Spurs; this was the first time he could remember not playing due to a coach&#x27;s decision.

On April 9, 2012, it was announced that Odom had parted ways with the Mavericks. Instead of releasing him, the team listed Odom as inactive for the remainder of the season. The move allowed the Mavericks to trade him at the end of the season. In a statement to ESPN, Odom said, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry that things didn&#x27;t work out better for both of us, but I wish the Mavs&#x27; organization, my teammates and Dallas fans nothing but continued success in the defense of their championship.&quot; Mavericks owner Mark Cuban admitted that a clash between the two during halftime in a game against the Memphis Grizzlies on April 7 was the last straw. Odom reportedly responded angrily when Cuban questioned his commitment, asking if he was &quot;in or out&quot;. Odom averaged only 6.6 points in 20.5 minutes along with career lows in shooting percentage (35.2), rebounds (4.2) and assists (1.7).

===Return to the Clippers (2012–2013)===
On June 29, 2012, Odom was traded back to the Los Angeles Clippers as part of a four-team deal. The deal sent Odom to the Clippers, the rights to Tadija Dragićević and cash considerations to the Dallas Mavericks, Mo Williams and the draft rights to Shan Foster to the Utah Jazz, and the draft rights to Furkan Aldemir to the Houston Rockets. He played all 82 games of the season for the third time in his career, but only started two of them. Out of shape for half the season, he averaged career lows of 4.0 ppg and 1.7 apg in 19.7 mpg during the season. He also averaged 5.9 rebounds, but shot just 39.9 percent. The Clippers finished 56–26 and won their first-ever Pacific Division title.

In July 2013, Odom became a free agent, but did not land an NBA contract despite some interest from the Clippers in his return. The Lakers also contemplated re-signing him, but both teams committed to other players instead.

===Laboral Kutxa Baskonia (2014)===
On February 18, 2014, Odom signed with Laboral Kutxa Baskonia of the Spanish League and the Euroleague on a two-month deal with an option to extend it for the remainder of the season. A month later, he returned to the United States due to a back injury after his personal doctors in New York ruled him unfit to play out his contract. He appeared in just two games for Baskonia.

=== Mighty Sports (2018–2019) ===
On April 16, 2014, Odom signed with the New York Knicks for the remainder of the 2013–14 season, but did not appear in the team&#x27;s season finale. The Knicks finished with a 37–45 win–loss record and missed the playoffs. On July 11, 2014, he was waived by the Knicks.

Odom planned to enter the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) in early 2018, but concluded that he was not fit enough. In December 2018, he joined Philippine club Mighty Sports, which was set to play in the 30th Dubai International Basketball Tournament on February 1–9, 2019. The roster included fellow imports Justin Brownlee and Randolph Morris, together with local amateur, former professional and Filipino-American basketball players.

Odom considered his Dubai stint to be preparation for his re-entry to professional basketball, particularly in the Big3, a US-based 3x3 basketball league founded by rapper Ice Cube. He was named a co-captain of the Enemies squad, but struggled in his first game before he was deactivated for the 2019 season by the Big3.

==National team career==

Odom played for the U.S. national team on the 2004 Olympic team in Athens, averaging 9.3 ppg while helping the U.S. to a bronze medal. He was invited to play for the FIBA World Championships for 2006 but declined the invitation because of the death of his son and in 2007 because of a shoulder injury.

Odom joined the 2010 FIBA World Championship team in Istanbul, Turkey, where the U.S. won win gold for the first time since 1994. Odom, being one of the elder statesmen on a young U.S. squad, served as a mentor for many of the younger players and even played out of position at center for the tournament. He led the U.S. in rebounds and finished the FIBA championships with double-doubles in the semi-final and championship games while becoming the first player in history to win both an NBA championship and FIBA gold in the same year.

==Player profile==
Odom was renowned for the impact his positive personality had on his teams. Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak called him &quot;the most popular player in our locker room&quot;. Odom valued the concept of a team and played unselfishly, and was content deferring to teammates while playing a supporting role. Standing at , he was still adept at dribbling the ball and directing the offense, and could also rebound proficiently as a small forward. He was able to score as a post player, on mid-range jumpers, as well as from outside. He could start a fast break with an outlet pass, finish it with a layup, or simply drive from coast to coast for a dunk. Though he was a reserve on the Lakers championship teams, he typically finished games in place of starter Andrew Bynum.

Odom was cooperative with the media, and provided both thoughtful and open responses.

==Personal life==
Odom had three children, Destiny (b. 1998), Lamar Jr. (b. 2002) and Jayden (2005–2006) with former girlfriend Liza Morales. On June 29, 2006, 6½-month-old Jayden died from sudden infant death syndrome while sleeping in his crib in New York. At the time, Odom was already in town for the funeral of an aunt. Odom developed a relationship with his father, who became drug-free; however, he remains closer to his high school coach, Jerry DeGregorio, who he calls [his] &quot;white dad&quot;. DeGregorio is the godfather to Destiny and Lamar Jr.

In September 2009, Odom married Khloé Kardashian after a month of dating. He had met her at a party for Lakers teammate Ron Artest. Their wedding was featured on the E! reality-based series &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot;, in which she stars. Odom became a fixture on the show and a household name to millions who were not already familiar with him as a basketball player. In December 2010, E! announced another spinoff from the series featuring Odom, Kardashian, and his two children from his previous relationship. The series, titled &quot;Khloé &amp; Lamar&quot;, debuted on April 10, 2011. Soon thereafter, Odom almost opted out of the show as the filming wore him down. The series was canceled in 2012 after two seasons.

On August 30, 2013, Odom was arrested on charges of driving under the influence (DUI). After the arrest, he refused to submit to a chemical test. Almost a week earlier, gossip websites had alleged that Odom had been abusing drugs, which prompted worried tweets from former teammates and coaches. On December 9, Odom pleaded no contest to the DUI charges and accepted a sentence of three years&#x27; probation and three months of alcohol abuse treatment. On December 13, after months of speculated separation, Kardashian filed for divorce from Odom and for legal restoration of her last name. Divorce papers were signed by both parties in July 2015; however, the divorce did not receive final approval from a judge before being dismissed by request in October 2015.

On October 13, 2015, Odom was hospitalized after being discovered unconscious at the Love Ranch, a legal brothel in Crystal, Nevada. Odom visited the ranch seeking the company of Cherry Ryder and Madison Montag. Odom, who had used cocaine in the days prior to his medical emergency, suffered kidney failure, several heart attacks, and 12 strokes. He became comatose and was placed on life support in a hospital in Las Vegas before regaining consciousness. He was transferred from Las Vegas to a Los Angeles hospital by medical transport. In the aftermath of the incident, Kardashian withdrew her request for a divorce; she stated that she had not reconciled with Odom, but wished to assist him in making medical decisions during his recovery.

Odom&#x27;s recovery went well. On January 8, 2016, Odom&#x27;s paternal aunt JaNean Mercer told &quot;Us Weekly&quot; that &quot;the former NBA star is on the road to recovery after finally leaving the hospital earlier in the week.&quot; She said, &quot;Lamar continues to make remarkable strides.&quot; In early 2016, Khloé Kardashian said, &quot;I&#x27;m just there to support and care for him. But he is doing amazing.&quot; On May 26, 2016, Kardashian filed for divorce again, and their divorce was finalized in December 2016. In 2017, Odom spoke publicly about his health struggles, his cocaine addiction, and his recovery from that addiction. He called himself a &quot;walking miracle&quot; who had &quot;cheated death&quot;, and acknowledged that his past drug use had made &quot;the end of [his basketball] career come along a little faster&quot;.

Odom has his own music and film production company, Rich Soil Entertainment. He appeared in a Taco Bell commercial with Charles Barkley during Super Bowl XLIV. Additionally, Odom made a cameo on the second season of the HBO television series &quot;Entourage&quot;.

Odom is noted for his fondness for candy. Wrigley made a replica of the Larry O&#x27;Brien Championship Trophy out of candy in celebration of the Lakers&#x27; victory in the 2009 Finals, and Odom&#x27;s name is featured on the base.

In 2015, Odom was #1 on the Google Trends list for living people, which measures the highest spikes in search traffic over a sustained period compared to the previous year.

In November 2019, Odom announced his engagement to Sabrina Parr, a health and lifestyle coach. On November 5, 2020, Parr confirmed that their engagement had been called off.

In February 2022, Odom was a HouseGuest on the third season of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;.

In 2023, Lamar Odom sold his company, Odom Senior Care to ZNest.com, a senior living platform. He subsequently became Chief Creative Officer at ZNest, where he leverages his personal experiences to help families navigate senior care options and improve access to quality housing for older.

===Boxing===

On June 11, 2021, Odom participated in an exhibition boxing match with singer/rapper Aaron Carter. He knocked Carter out in the second round. On October 2, 2021, Odom defeated Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s ex-husband Ojani Noa in a celebrity boxing match.

<text>S&amp;P Global Inc. (prior to 2016, McGraw Hill Financial, Inc., and prior to 2013, The McGraw–Hill Companies, Inc.) is an American publicly traded corporation headquartered in Manhattan, New York City. Its primary areas of business are financial information and analytics. It is the parent company of S&amp;P Global Ratings, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, S&amp;P Global Mobility, S&amp;P Global Sustainable1, and S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, CRISIL. It is also the majority owner of the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices joint venture. &quot;S&amp;P&quot; is a shortening of &quot;Standard and Poor&#x27;s&quot;.

== Corporate history==
The predecessor companies of S&amp;P Global have histories dating to 1888, when James H. McGraw purchased the &quot;American Journal of Railway Appliances&quot;. He continued to add further publications, eventually establishing The &quot;McGraw Publishing Company&quot; in 1899. John A. Hill had also produced several technical and trade publications and in 1902 formed his own business, The &quot;Hill Publishing Company&quot;. In 1909, both men, having known each other&#x27;s interests, agreed upon an alliance and combined the book departments of their publishing companies into The &quot;McGraw–Hill Book Company&quot;. John Hill served as president, with James McGraw as vice-president. In 1917, the remaining parts of each business were merged into The &quot;McGraw–Hill Publishing Company&quot;. McGraw Hill founded Business Week magazine in 1929.

In 2009, McGraw Hill Cos. sold Business Week to Bloomberg L.P. In 1964, after Hill died, both &quot;McGraw–Hill Publishing Company&quot; and &quot;McGraw–Hill Book Company&quot; merged into &quot;McGraw–Hill, Inc.&quot; McGraw–Hill purchased credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s from Paul Talbot Babson in 1966. In 1979, McGraw–Hill acquired &quot;Byte&quot; magazine from its owner/publisher Virginia Williamson, who then became a vice-president of McGraw–Hill. In 1986, McGraw–Hill bought out competitor The Economy Company, then the United States&#x27; largest publisher of educational material. The buyout made McGraw–Hill the largest educational publisher in the United States. In 1994, McGraw–Hill&#x27;s broadcasting division signed a deal with ABC, due partly to the fact that its stations in San Diego (KGTV) and Indianapolis (WRTV) had already been aligned with the network, and that Denver (KMGH-TV) and Bakersfield (KERO-TV) joined the ABC family. (Bakersfield sister station KERO-TV was also involved in the deal between McGraw–Hill and ABC; however, that station had to wait for its affiliation contract with CBS to expire in March 1996, before it could finally switch to ABC). In 1995, McGraw–Hill, Inc. became The &quot;McGraw–Hill Companies, Inc.&quot; as part of a corporate rebranding.

On October 3, 2011, McGraw–Hill announced it was selling its entire television station group to the E. W. Scripps Company for $212 million. The sale was completed on December 30, 2011. It had been involved in broadcasting since 1972, when it purchased four television stations from a division of Time Inc. The sale included McGraw–Hill Broadcasting&#x27;s stations KERO-TV and KZKC-LP Bakersfield; KGTV and KZSD-LP San Diego; KZCS-LP Colorado Springs; flagship station KMGH-TV and KZCO-LD Denver; KZFC-LP Fort Collins; and WRTV Indianapolis. On November 26, 2012, McGraw–Hill announced it was selling its entire education division, known as &quot;McGraw–Hill Education&quot; to Apollo Global Management for $2.5 billion. On March 22, 2013, McGraw–Hill announced it had completed the sale for $2.4 billion cash. On May 1, 2013, shareholders of McGraw–Hill voted to change the company&#x27;s name to &quot;McGraw Hill Financial&quot;. McGraw–Hill divested the subsidiary McGraw–Hill Construction to Symphony Technology Group for US$320 million on September 22, 2014. The sale included Engineering News-Record, Architectural Record, Dodge and Sweet&#x27;s. McGraw–Hill Construction has been renamed Dodge Data &amp; Analytics.

In February 2016, McGraw–Hill announced that McGraw–Hill Financial would change its name to &quot;S&amp;P Global Inc.&quot; by the end of April 2016. McGraw Hill Financial officially changed its name following a shareholder vote on April 27, 2016. In April 2016, McGraw–Hill announced that it was selling J.D. Power and Associates to investment firm XIO Group for $1.1 billion. On August 3, 2020, S&amp;P Global Platts launched S&amp;P Global Platts Analytics fundamental oil information on the redesigned S&amp;P Global Platts Developer Platform. The Platts Developer Platform offers customers with quick exposure to product price databases, business statistics and insights at the pace of market changes. In November 2020, S&amp;P Global agreed to acquire IHS Markit analytics company in a $44 billion transaction. In 2023, S&amp;P sold the former IHS engineering operations to KKR &amp; Co, which rebranded IHS as Accuris.

<doc id="651273" wikidata="Q7950410" url="?curid=651273" title="WHRW">
<text>WHRW (90.5 FM) is Binghamton University&#x27;s non-profit, student-run, free-format radio station. The station is licensed and owned by Binghamton University, serving the New York college area. WHRW has operational facilities in Glenn G. Bartle Library Tower and in SUNY Binghamton Student Union.

WHRW is operated by the students of SUNY Binghamton and interested members of the Greater Binghamton community. WHRW operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week and broadcasts using a 2 kW transmitter at 90.5 MHz.

WHRW&#x27;s air staff consists of volunteers who become members by apprenticing under a current member for a programming season, typically during a college semester or over the summer) and then passing a Clearance Exam. Since 1996, WHRW members have participated in a &quot;Station Service&quot; program, by which they accrue hours by accomplishing tasks that support the station. The support hours are then used to determine the member&#x27;s &quot;slotting priority&quot; when they request a show. This guarantees that those who give more time to the station have more opportunities.

==Beginnings as a radio workshop==
In the 1950s, Binghamton University was known as Harpur College, a public college of the State of New York. In 1954, a loose organization formally called &quot;The Radio Workshop of Harpur College&quot; was formed. Its primary function was to create a network with interested college students and local commercial radio stations, with the intention of providing the opportunity to be involved in doing production work for these stations.

In October 1961, members of the Workshop began to construct their own AM transmitter. The first installment of a self-broadcasting Workshop started in May 1962. The station was called WRAF, where &quot;RAF&quot; stood for Harpur College&#x27;s Rafuse Residence Hall, the origin of the broadcast. While the station was received on 590 kHz on AM radio, the broadcasts were carrier-current as they were transmitted through the power lines of only two residence halls. Accordingly, only the residents of those halls could receive the maiden broadcasts.

==A &quot;no rock-and-roll&quot; policy==
While WHRW&#x27;s accessible format environment would arguably become the station&#x27;s strongest suit, the days of experimental FM had not yet happened and WRAF&#x27;s days were different. The station regularly polled the student body to try and create a programming schedule acceptable to its audience. WRAF had a &quot;no rock-and-roll&quot; policy and focused its broadcast day mostly on classical and &quot;good&quot; non-classical music. However, in 1965, WRAF had its first rock-and-roll show.

==The move to FM==
In 1965, WRAF&#x27;s General Manager proposed moving the station to the FM band, which was still largely unused. In November of that year, the FCC approved the construction of an educational station at 90.5 MHz. The FCC approved the station&#x27;s request for WHRW as the new station&#x27;s call letters. &quot;HRW&quot; was chosen to represent Harpur Radio Workshop. While stereo FM had been introduced in the early 1960s, it was not an inexpensive technology, WHRW&#x27;s first transmitter was a humble 10W in mono.

WHRW&#x27;s first broadcast was on Friday, February 4, 1966, at 7:30 pm, which covered a Binghamton Colonials basketball game. The formal inaugural broadcast took place two days later. WHRW was only the third FM radio station in the Binghamton market.

The broadcasting followed the times and the culture in which it was steeped:

* Jazz, folk, classical, rock, and other forms of music.
* News and culture coverage that leaned progressive (Vietnam War protests and debates, news from Pacifica Radio and the BBC).
* Interviews with local political figures.

The regular broadcast schedule ran from Sunday through Thursday, from about 5 pm to 1 am.

In the spring of 1967, the mayor of Binghamton, Joseph Esworthy, was interviewed on the &quot;Open Line&quot; show by the station&#x27;s general manager, David R. Cooper. When Esworthy was asked if he favored the legalization of marijuana, he answered affirmatively. The next day, the local media picked up the story, and it is believed that the publicity is what ended Esworthy&#x27;s political career.

In the late 1960s, construction on the new &quot;Faculty Tower&quot; (later more famously named the Glenn G. Bartle Library Tower) was completed. WHRW&#x27;s antenna was moved to the top of this building in April 1968 and remained there to this day. 1969, the year of Woodstock, WHRW-FM broadcast for the first time during the summer months with local volunteers on a daily schedule of music variety shows and news under the first summer General Manager. The program schedule became enormously popular with local listeners and WHRW-FM attracted many more. From that time forward, WHRW-FM has maintained summer programming.

==The &quot;old station&quot;==
While WRAF/WHRW had called several locations home before September 1968, it would be the move during that month that would find them a home for more than 30 years. University Union 266, on what is called the &quot;Mezzanine Level&quot; of the University Union, was WHRW&#x27;s new home in 1968.

The facility was built specifically for the station, with two control rooms (which were named &quot;Control Room 1&quot;, or &quot;CR-1&quot;; and &quot;Control Room 2&quot;, or &quot;CR-2&quot;), a place for extra people to be hosted for group broadcasts (dubbed &quot;Studio A&quot;), rooms for records, and office space. There was also a &quot;lobby,&quot; an open room that had couches and chairs, bulletin boards with station news and current events, and WHRW&#x27;s broadcast piped in through speakers.

In the late 1960s, station members began to augment the normal decor of a college radio station by writing and drawing on the walls. These graffiti gave the station an even more enigmatic feel, and by 2000 nearly every inch of the facility had been &quot;personalized&quot; in one form or another.

In 2002, the station was forced in to move to the new University Union after Binghamton University decided they were re-purposing the original Union building. However, the budget for the project was misappropriated, and the project ran out of money before the old building could be re-purposed. The shell of the &quot;old station,&quot; as it was called, existed in exactly the condition in which it was left after the move for five years, until mid-2007, when renovation work finally began.

==Moe Loogham==
In the early 1970s, a strange graffito started to appear on campus. A picture in the 1973 yearbook shows &quot;Moe Loogham Is Coming!&quot; spray-painted on the plywood walls surrounding the School of Engineering building construction site at Binghamton University, which was then known as Harpur College. From the mid-1970s onward, Moe Loogham was referred to frequently on WHRW&#x27;s programs, in station publications, and all around campus. In fact, Moe&#x27;s name has been seen in such diverse locations as at the top of the Washington Monument and in downtown Prague.

Moe appears to be an enigmatic folk legend whose name is derived from the name of a social club at a Hicksville, Long Island high school. (Moe&#x27;s last name is believed to be a re-working of the name of the Rolling Stones&#x27; record producer, Andrew Loog Oldham). First word of Moe came to the third floor of the dormitory Delaware Hall on September 10, 1970. He was thought of more as the &quot;Bringer of all Rightness&quot; than anything else. In ensuing months, &quot;Men (and Women) of Moe&quot; would engage in &quot;slapping missions&quot; where simply-printed stickers with the words &quot;Moe Loogham is Coming!&quot; printed on them in plain block letters would be pasted in prominent locations on and off campus (like Lecture Hall-1, a popular meeting place for classes and student organizations on the Binghamton University campus).

&quot;Moe&quot; was said by some to be a drug dealer (which in those days meant a counterculture figure who functioned more like a neighborhood grocer or bartender than a criminal nuisance) or a shipment of drugs (which in those days usually meant marijuana (&quot;Moe&#x27;s Loogs&quot;...), hashish or the odd tablet or sugar-cube of LSD). According to legend, he was supposed to have &quot;so many drugs that no one would ever need to get drugs from anyone else again,&quot; and &quot;drugs of many kinds and colors, drugs beyond one&#x27;s wildest dreams.&quot; In later years, Moe was the nostalgic icon for the euphoria of the 1960s. But regardless of the times, the popular saying on campus was that &quot;When Moe gets here, &quot;everything&quot; will be &quot;All Right!&quot;&quot;

In more recent years as, new generations have called WHRW their own, Moe has become sort of a godhead to long-standing station members, a metaphor for the free spirit of WHRW. Moe&#x27;s name is now often used to describe the euphoria often felt when good radio happens just right.

==The Golden Age of FM==
In the early 1970s, some adventurous FM stations (such as KSAN-FM and WNEW-FM) began experimenting with programming based upon album tracks, not only from established artists but from more obscure bands as well. Many of these stations played records by bands few AM radio listeners had heard of at the time such as Led Zeppelin, The Chambers Brothers, Iron Butterfly, and spoken-comedy acts like Firesign Theatre. As in the early days of rock and roll, DJs would play a record based mostly upon their own judgement.

Experimental programming was also becoming popular, especially among college stations, and this time period is also where the term &quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;underground&quot; radio was born. It was the 1960s description of what we now call free-form radio. A DJ could play whatever they wanted as long as it did not violate Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations (some DJs played things which most certainly did), and a station&#x27;s popularity depended upon how well its DJs knew music and how they applied that knowledge on the air. Classical was played alongside jazz; rock against folk music or folk-rock, and so on. Shows were often semi-scripted, using tape production to introduce both commentary and comedy rather than simple turn-table segues to press disparate sound, culture and music into a holistic collage that sometimes became art, but often challenged mind and senses in ways nearly painful for the thrill. In the mid-1970s free-form radio fell out of vogue, and many formerly progressive FM stations adopted an AM-like playlist and rotation schedule, though unlike today many of those stations would still offer specialty programming such as live concert simulcasts (most notably the King Biscuit Flower Hour) and comedy shows such as the National Lampoon Radio Hour and Dr. Demento. WHRW decided to preserve this format throughout those years and beyond, perhaps not intentionally, but simply by sticking with a style that suited its DJs and listeners.

<text>Write once, run anywhere (WORA), or sometimes Write once, run everywhere (WORE), was a 1995 slogan created by Sun Microsystems to illustrate the cross-platform benefits of the Java language. Ideally, this meant that a Java program could be developed on any device, compiled into standard bytecode, and be expected to run on any device equipped with a Java virtual machine (JVM). The installation of a JVM or Java interpreter on chips, devices, or software packages became an industry standard practice.

The catch is that since there are multiple JVM implementations, on top of a wide variety of different operating systems, there could be subtle differences in how a program executes on each JVM/OS combination, possibly requiring an application to be tested on each target platform. This gave rise to a joke among Java developers: Write Once, Debug Everywhere.

In comparison, the Squeak Smalltalk programming language and environment boasts of being truly write once run anywhere, because it runs bit-identical images across its wide portability base.

<doc id="651286" wikidata="Q27618" url="?curid=651286" title="Matricaria">
<text>Matricaria is a genus of flowering plants in the chamomile tribe within the sunflower family. Some of the species have the common name of &quot;mayweed&quot;, but this name also refers to plants not in this genus.

== Description ==
Their many-branched stems are prostrate to erect, glabrous, and very leafy. Their bipinnate leaves have numerous linear, narrowly lobed leaflets.

The flowers are radially symmetrical. The greenish-yellow capitula are semi-spherical. The white ray florets can be present (&quot;M. recutita&quot;) or lacking (&quot;M. discoidea&quot;). The disc florets are 4- to 5-dentate. The receptacle is 2–3 times as high as wide. The pappus may be crown-shaped and short, or lacking.

== Taxonomy ==
The taxonomy of &quot;Matricaria&quot; is controversial and very confused. Several species are classified either in &quot;Tripleurospermum&quot; or &quot;Matricaria&quot; depending on the interpretation of the author. The distinction is made according to the number of the seed ribs: &quot;Tripleurospermum&quot; has one adaxial and two lateral seed ribs, while &quot;Matricaria&quot; has four or five adaxial seed ribs.
; Species
== Distribution and habitat ==
Most are very common in the temperate regions of Eurasia and North America, as well as in northern and southern Africa, with some also being naturalised in Australia. &quot;Matricaria occidentalis&quot; is native to North America; other species have been introduced there.

These are hardy, pleasantly aromatic annuals, growing along roadsides in ruderal communities and in fallow land rich in nutrients. Though many are considered nuisance weeds, they are suitable for rock gardens and herb gardens, and as border plants.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Matricaria&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species (caterpillars) including lime-speck pug.

== Uses ==
The extract of &quot;Matricaria chamomilla (or recutita)&quot; (German chamomile) is taken as a strong tea. It has been used in herbal medicine as a carminative and anti-inflammatory. It is also used in ointments and lotions, and as a mouthwash against infections of mouth and gums. Aromatherapy uses two essential oils of chamomile: the &quot;true chamomile&quot; oil (or German chamomile oil, from &quot;M. recutita&quot;) and the Roman chamomile oil (from &quot;Chamaemelum nobile&quot;).

<text>Matricaria chamomilla (synonym: &quot;Matricaria recutita&quot;), commonly known as [[chamomile]] (also spelled camomile), German chamomile, Hungarian chamomile (kamilla), wild chamomile, blue chamomile, or scented mayweed, is an annual plant of the composite family Asteraceae. Commonly, the name &quot;M. recutita&quot; is applied to the herbal product chamomile, although other species are also used as chamomile. The plant is commonly used to make a tea.

==Description==
&quot;Matricaria chamomilla&quot; is a member of the Asteraceae family, native to southern and eastern Europe. It can be found on all continents, has a branched, erect and smooth stem, and grows to a height of . The long and narrow leaves are bipinnate or tripinnate. The flowers are borne in paniculate flower heads (capitula). The white ray florets are furnished with a ligule, while the disc florets are yellow. The hollow receptacle is swollen and lacks scales. This property distinguishes German chamomile from &quot;Anthemis arvensis&quot; (corn chamomile), which has a receptacle with scales. The flowers bloom in early to midsummer and are fragrant.

The essential oil of the flowers gives them a characteristic smell and has interesting properties. The blue color of the oil, attributable to the chamazulene it contains, explains why the plant is also known by the common name &quot;blue chamomile&quot;. The fruit is a yellowish-brown achene.

==Etymology==
The word chamomile comes from the Greek χαμαίμηλον (&quot;chamaimēlon&quot;) meaning &quot;earth-apple&quot;, which is derived from χαμαί (&quot;chamai&quot;) meaning &quot;on the ground&quot; and μήλον (&quot;mēlon&quot;) meaning &quot;apple&quot;. It is so called because of the apple-like scent of the plant.

In Latin, one of the meanings of &quot;matrix&quot; is &quot;womb&quot;; the name Matricaria was given to the genus because &quot;Matricaria chamomilla&quot; was used in ancient herbalism to treat cramps and sleep disorders related to premenstrual syndrome.

== Cultivation ==
Chamomile does not need special soil, although it grows best on well balanced soils with good topsoil. It can be planted as an annual crop in either autumn or spring, or it can be treated as a perennial due to its ability to self-seed.

Aphids are a major insect pest in chamomile production. Its most significant diseases in Europe are downy mildew, powdery mildew and rust.

The chamomile plant often flowers 2 to 3 times per year. This is taken into account by multiple harvests per year as well. The flowering period is about 50–65 days while the development of a flower takes about 20–25 days.

== Potential adverse effects ==
Chamomile, a relative of ragweed, can cause allergy symptoms and can cross-react with ragweed pollen in individuals with ragweed allergies. Contact dermatitis may occur when touching the plant. When consuming the tea, there is potential for drug interactions with anticoagulants.

== Uses ==

Chamomile is commonly used to make a tea. German chamomile is used in herbal medicine.

===Phytochemistry===
The flowers contain between 0.3 and 1.5% of the essential oil. It is extracted by distillation, mostly out of fresh flower buds and flower stalks. Bisabolol accounts for up to 33% of the oil&#x27;s content.

More than 120 chemical constituents have been identified in chamomile flower, most of them found in the essential oil. Chemical constituents of the essential oil include bisabolol, farnesene, chamazulene, apigenin, quercetin, patuletin, luteolin, and coumarin.

<doc id="651295" wikidata="Q6787941" url="?curid=651295" title="Matrícula Consular">
<text>The Matrícula Consular de Alta Seguridad (MCAS; English: High Security Consular Registration, HSCR), also known as the Mexican Consular Identification Card (Mexican CID Card; Spanish: Tarjeta de Identificación Consular Mexicana, TICM), is an identification card issued by the Government of Mexico through its consulate offices to Mexican nationals residing outside of Mexico. Also known as the Mexican CID card, it has been issued since 1871. The issue of the card has no bearing on immigration status in the foreign country they are residing in. The purpose of the card is to demonstrate that the bearer is a Mexican national living outside of Mexico. It includes a Government of Mexico issued ID number and bears a photograph and address outside of Mexico of the Mexican national to whom it is issued.

==Use in the United States==
Several states, municipalities, and businesses in the United States accept the Matrícula Consular (English: Consular Registration) as an official form of identification. Two million Mexican CIDs were issued in 2002–2003. A number of countries have followed suit including Guatemala, Brazil, and Ecuador. Other countries are considering the program, including: Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Peru. Peru has specifically cited &quot;the acceptance of the Mexican CID card in the United States as a factor contributing to its interest in issuing a CID card.&quot; The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations defines consular functions to include issuing passports and travel documents, and the United States Department of State accepts that the issuing of CID cards is a permissible consular function.

On September 14, 2004, the United States Congress voted down a motion to prevent financial institutions from accepting consular IDs. Representative Tom Price announced that the Committee on Financial Services would be convening hearings on the methods permitted by the United States Department of the Treasury applying to the use of the Matricula Consular by banking institutions for the purposes of verification of identity.

The FDIC says &quot;about $18 billion is wired annually from the U.S. to Mexico. Many U.S. banks have welcomed the IDs as a way to get a cut of this activity by profiting from the handling charges on the wires and increased deposits.&quot;

== Security issues ==
Former New Jersey Representative Scott Garrett (R) stated that the use of MCAS (Matrícula Consular de Alta Seguridad) cards by undocumented immigrants weakens the measures established by the U.S. Congress after &quot;9/11 to safeguard American businesses and financial institutions against fraud and abuse&quot;. U.S. law enforcement officials also cite that Matrícula Consular cards are issued by Mexican Consulate without checking the authenticity of the applicant&#x27;s supporting documentation. In testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 26, 2003, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) disclosed and reported that the Matricula Consular card is inherently unreliable and unverifiable as an identification card and is highly vulnerable to fraud, regardless of its security features. The FBI reported that because Mexico lacks a centralized database for their CIDs, they are unable to prevent an individual from receiving multiple CIDs and cannot access information about a CID applicant&#x27;s identity. An FBI agent said that &quot;Mexican consulates issued CID cards to individuals lacking any proof of identification, as long as they fill out a questionnaire and satisfy the consular official that they are who they claim to be.&quot; U.S. federal and local drug enforcement agents have discovered that numerous non-citizen narcotics traffickers obtain Matricula Consular cards using aliases and that their use in the United States presents the United States with a serious criminal threat.

In a 2003 letter to the Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge by the U.S. House Chairmen of the Homeland Security Committee, the Judiciary Committee, the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, and the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, &amp; Intellectual Property, it was written that the Matricula Consular &quot;can be a perfect breeder document for establishing a false identity&quot;. They warned that criminals could exploit the cards to conceal their identity as well as launder money and write fraudulent checks. They went on to point out that any acceptance of the cards by the Federal Government &quot;compromises our homeland security&quot; by providing an opportunity for terrorists to freely move about the United States, board planes and transfer funds for terrorist activities.

In January 2003, Nancy Pelosi, the ranking Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, pushed for a trial arrangement to give holders of Matricula Consular cards access to the Phillip Burton Federal Building in San Francisco. Due to national security concerns, other members of Congress later revoked the privilege by the summer of 2003. In response to this, Pelosi argued that the vote to restrict the use of the Matrícula Consular was &quot;anti-Hispanic&quot; and that &quot;We in San Francisco know that the Matrícula Consular works&quot;. The Matricula Consular card has been embraced by the Democratic Caucus. The Mayor of San Francisco established a policy in December 2001 for the city and county of San Francisco to accept the Mexican CID as a valid form of ID. The mayor&#x27;s office issued a press release stating that the card would prevent those in the Mexican immigrant community lacking an acceptable identification from being jailed or deported when committing minor offenses.

The United States Department of Agriculture warned that the Matricula Consular card is not sufficient to determine legal immigration status nor eligibility for the U.S. Food Stamp Program. The department also advised that home addresses on these cards may not be current &quot;given the potential mobility of this population&quot;.

Bank on California, a program launched by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in December 2008, encourages financial institutions to accept the Mexican CID, Guatemalan CID and other CID cards as primary identification for opening bank accounts.

The Center for Immigration Studies, a conservative research organization, argued in a research brief that the Matricula is becoming a shield that hides criminal activity for two reasons: first, the holder&#x27;s identity was not verified when the card was issued, and second, police in jurisdictions that accept the Matricula are less likely to run background checks on card holders picked up for minor infractions. The organization claimed that the Matricula consular is useful in the United States only for the undocumented, since legal immigrants, have U.S. government-issued documents, and that the objective the card&#x27;s supporters is to achieve quasi-legal status for &quot;Mexican illegals in the United States&quot;.

Anti-immigration activists also claimed the Federal Government of Mexico responded to the September 11 attacks by aggressively lobbying for the ID.

== Mexican Consular Identification Card ==
The Mexican Consular Identification Card (Mexican CID Card; Spanish: &quot;Tarjeta de Identificación Consular Mexicana&quot;, TICM), known as &quot;Matrícula Consular de Alta Seguridad&quot; (MCAS; English: High Security Consular Registration, HSCR) in Spanish, is a proof of nationality certificate issued by a Mexican Consular Office that verifies that the bearer is registered as a resident in its consular district. It is issued in accordance with Mexican privacy law and international legal instruments signed by Mexico and the United States such as the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 1963.

Mexican Consulates have historically issued these ID cards to their nationals who reside in the United States, regardless of whether they are permanent residents, or have dual citizenship or other status. The practice is widely followed throughout the world, and the United States and Mexico are just two of the 180 countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention.

Many other countries around the world also choose to document their consular registries with identification cards to prove that every registered person is:

1)    a national of the issuing country and

2)    registered with the respective consulate or embassy. 

Article 5 (d) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations defines consular functions to include the issuance of documents to nationals of the sending state. Furthermore, subsections (g) and (h) of the treaty say that consulates should safeguard the interests of their nationals, particularly in the case of death or minors.  Consular identification cards are a part of this process.  

Requirements

Mexicans living abroad who request a Consular Identification Card must submit these three documents:

·        a document that proves Mexican nationality,

·        an official identification card with a photo and

·        a document that proves their place of residence within the corresponding consular district.  

The Mexican Consular Identification Card cannot be issued to a person who faces a judicial or administrative process in Mexico.

Background

In 2002, the Mexican Government created the Consular Identification Card and Mexican Consulates in the United States started to issue these ID cards.  In 2006, the security of the ID card was improved by the addition of biometrics, decoded information using two-dimensional (2D) bar codes and security measures in accordance with international standards.

In 2014, the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs introduced a new format for the Consular Identification Card that further improved its security and not only met U.S. identification security standards but, in some cases, surpassed them. The new security features of the Consular Identification Card include:
·        a Guilloché design (a complex, repetitive pattern to avoid forgery),

·        a laser-engraved element,

·        Ghost images,

·        UV elements,

·        2D bar codes,

·        Pearlescent ink,

·        Preprinted microtexts and nanotexts,

·        Proprietary security holographic laminates and

·        a cryptographic chip with encrypted data.

The Arizona Case

The Mexican Consular Identification Card is currently recognized as proof of identity by many banks, financial institutions and police departments, as well as federal, state and local authorities in Mexico and the United States. This acceptance not only supports the work of law enforcement agencies, it also offers certainty to business transactions.

The use of these ID cards is definitely good for the local Arizona economy. Hispanics currently represent 31.7% of Arizona’s population, and 27.8% of those residents are of Mexican origin. Mexicans represent more than 52% of the total foreign-born population in Arizona, and there are 35 Mexican companies that employ more than 8,000 people in the state. 

Members of the Mexican community can use these ID cards for business transactions, which will make it easier to use formal financial services. They also can use the cards to obtain loans, open businesses or acquire property. Because remittances to Mexico are sent through financial institutions or money transfer operators, the growth and profitability of the U.S. remittance market also has been strengthened by the use of these highly secure ID cards.

History of MCAS in Arizona

&quot;Unfortunately, these Consular ID cards were not always accepted in Arizona. In 2011, Arizona Senate Bill&quot; SB1465 &quot;prohibited the state of Arizona or any of its political subdivisions from accepting the Mexican Consular Identification Card as a valid and legal form of identification. The main argument was a lack of perceived security and reliability&quot;

&quot;In the last decade, there has been lengthy and complex work done to get the Consular Identification Card accepted again in Arizona.&quot;

In 2015, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey issued an important proclamation recognizing Mexico&#x27;s major role as Arizona&#x27;s number one trading partner. Governor Ducey exhorted the Arizona State Legislature to review and reconsider SB1465.

Since Consul General Jorge Mendoza Yescas was appointed in 2019, the Mexican Consulate in Phoenix organized a number of official visits with local authorities to discuss the benefits of the Consular ID card in terms of the local economy, security and law enforcement. The official visits included, among others, 30 Arizona mayors and 30 police officers, seven county sheriffs, several state legislators, chambers of commerce and members of academia.

In 2020, those intense efforts paid off when former state Rep. Tony Rivero, state Rep. David Cook and state Sen. Paul Boyer collaborated with the Mexican Consulate to present a new bill to recognize the Consular Identification Card. Finally, on February 24, 2021, the Arizona State Legislature approved AZ SB1420 (Consular identification; validity; biometric verification), which was promoted by state Sen. Boyer.

On March 5, 2021, Gov. Doug Ducey signed the new bill, which allow authorities in Arizona to accept consular ID cards such as MCAS, into law.

Mexico&#x27;s consular network in Arizona is made up of two Consulates General (Phoenix and Nogales) and three Consulates (Douglas, Tucson and Yuma).

<text>The wardroom is the mess cabin or compartment on a warship or other military ship for commissioned naval officers above the rank of midshipman. Although the term typically applies to officers in a navy, it is also applicable to marine officers and coast guard officers in those nations that have such service branches. On larger vessels, such as aircraft carriers of the United States Navy, there may be more than one wardroom. It may also be used on stone frigates to refer to similar officer mess facilities at naval, marine, and coast guard installations ashore.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;the wardroom&quot; is also used (metonymically) to refer to those individuals with the right to occupy that wardroom, meaning &#x27;the officers of the wardroom&#x27;. 

==Usage==
The wardroom provides a place of rest, relaxation and recreation, as well as being an officers&#x27; dining room. Usually, a galley or scullery adjoins the wardroom. Table service is provided by stewards, now known in some services as mess specialists or culinary specialists.

On warships other than those of the U.S. Navy, there is usually a bar where alcoholic drinks may be purchased. Ships may be either &#x27;wet&#x27; or &#x27;dry&#x27;: the former allowing the consumption of alcohol whilst at sea (though may still be prohibited during action stations), whilst a dry ship only allows alcohol to be consumed when alongside at port, if at all. Ships of the United States Navy have not allowed alcohol consumption onboard since 1913, although since 1980 unique, by exception, single-day waivers have been granted to vessels deployed in excess of 60 days without a port call.

==Etiquette==

Wardrooms have rules governing etiquette &quot;and&quot; military customs. Traditionally considered taboo are three topics: politics, religion, and sex (earlier guidebooks referred to the latter as &#x27;ladies&#x27;, this being changed as increasing numbers of female officers joined the wardrooms of warships and coast guard vessels). On large ships in peacetime, talking about professional business is also frowned upon. It is also considered inappropriate to perform work, or to meet with subordinates in a wardroom. Typically, upon entering the wardroom at meal time, members ask permission from the most senior officer present before joining the table.

The ship&#x27;s executive officer is usually the &quot;mess president&quot;. On warships and coast guard vessels, the commanding officer is normally not a member of the wardroom but is invited to join the members for special occasions.

Of significant note in ships&#x27; wardrooms of the Royal Navy is the daily toast to the monarch. In all other circumstances and settings, those toasting the monarch would first rise to their feet and face the monarch before raising their glass and declaring their affirmation. In ships wardrooms, officers remain seated to toast the monarch. This practice came about following the permission of King William IV; when the King who was dining in a wardroom aboard a warship himself rose to return the compliment and banged his head, due to the low headroom height between warship decks of the period.

<text>LaGuardia Community College is a public community college in New York City. It is in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens in and part of the City University of New York. LaGuardia is named after former congressman and New York City mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia. The college offers associate degrees in the arts, sciences, and applied sciences, as well as continuing education programs.

==History==
LaGuardia Community College was founded on January 22, 1967, by a resolution of the Board of Higher Education of the City of New York, a New York State government agency which was the precursor to the City University of New York&#x27;s board of trustees. The new college, originally designated &quot;Community College Number Nine&quot;, was to be comprehensive: &quot;The college will be oriented to the needs and interests of the community in which it is located, providing cultural activities, special services, continuing education and skills training opportunities for community residents of all ages.&quot;

The college&#x27;s first president was Joseph Shenker, who had been Acting President of Kingsborough Community College and at age 29, the youngest community college president anywhere in the United States. In October 1970, the Board of Higher Education, breaking with CUNY&#x27;s geographic naming convention, named the new college after Mayor LaGuardia, noting his &quot;lifelong public service to the people of the City of New York and of the United States, and his ambitious and successful leadership of good government campaigns to provide decent living conditions and guarantee democratic processes for all...&quot;

The college was officially opened on September 22, 1971, and received its first accreditation from the Middle States Association in December 1972 when the college graduated its first class. Shenker was succeeded as president by Raymond C. Bowen in 1989 and by Gail Mellow in 2000.

The La Guardia and Wagner Archives was established on campus in 1982.

The college has supported numerous and conferences in collaboration with the Wikipedia community since 2012.

In early 2024, Steve Cohen&#x27;s Steven &amp; Alexandra Cohen Foundation donated $116 million for the establishment of a workforce development center at LaGuardia Community College, which is planned to open in 2029.

==Campus==

On March 24, 1970, the New York City Board of Higher Education approved the former Ford Instrument Company building on Long Island City&#x27;s Thomson Avenue as the location for the College. At this time, Joseph Shenker was named president of the proposed college. Renovations to the five-story, former factory began the same year. This building would serve as the Main building of the new college—renamed Shenker Hall in 2008 in honor of the College&#x27;s founding president.

The Ford Instrument Building was intended to be a temporary home for the college. On September 22, 1972, the school received from the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, for payment of $1, a site in Astoria that had formerly been the U.S. Army Pictorial Center, with the intention of moving the college to a campus on the new site. Originally the Famous Players–Lasky film studio, the complex consisted of 15 buildings. However, in 1974 during the city&#x27;s fiscal crisis the site had to be sold off, as the expense of maintaining it in the interim was too high. The Army Pictorial Center would later become Kaufman Astoria Studios.

The current campus including Shenker Hall is located at the east end of Long Island City near Sunnyside. The area is physically separated from the rest of Long Island City by the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Sunnyside Yard. The campus runs between Thomson Avenue to the north and 47th Avenue to the south, extending east from 28th Street near the Queensboro Bridge approach to Van Dam Street. The buildings of the campus consist of former Long Island City factories and warehouses converted for school use.

The closest New York City Subway station to the campus is the 33rd Street–Rawson Street station on the IRT Flushing Line.

===Current buildings===
====C Building====

At the far west end of the campus is the C Building or Center III, located between 29th and 30th Street near the Queensboro Bridge approach. The ten-story former factory was constructed in 1912 as the Loose-Wiles Sunshine Biscuits Building. Due to its size and numerous windows, the building was dubbed the &quot;largest factory in Long Island&quot;, &quot;world&#x27;s largest bakery&quot;, and the &quot;Thousand Window Bakery&quot;. The building was designed by architect William Higginson, with a reinforced concrete frame, and a glazed white terra cotta facade produced by the Atlantic Terra Cotta Company. A spur track from the nearby Long Island Rail Road fed into the rear of the building, allowing freight cars to load and unload inside the facility. The complex also included a two-level garage building for the storage of delivery trucks. The biscuit factory was erected as part of the Degnon Terminal area of Long Island City, created by developer Michael Degnon. Degnon&#x27;s firm was the contractor that excavated the Steinway Subway Tunnel to Midtown Manhattan. He also proposed and partially developed a major industrial port revolving around Flushing Bay, which later became Flushing Meadows–Corona Park.

By the 1970s, the building was used as the headquarters for Executone, a producer of telephone systems. It also served as a Gimbels warehouse. In 1975, LaGuardia Community College began leasing of space on the third floor the Executone Building, including seven classrooms and a lecture hall. In 1981, the college leased an additional of space on the building&#x27;s seventh floor. In 1985, the Executone Building became part of a four-building complex known as the International Design Center New York (IDCNY). The complex included the adjacent Bucilla Building (Center II) and the former American Chicle Company factory (Center I). The name &quot;Center III&quot; originated from its use within the Design Center. Due to the 1987 stock market crash, Center III was never redesigned for IDCNY like the other two buildings. The entire Center III building was purchased by LaGuardia in 1998 for $52 million to create a West Campus. The college also purchased the adjacent garage (Center IV), the former Loose-Wiles truck garage. The purchase increased the size of the college campus by 70 percent, and would relieve space in the E Building.

In 2006 the college announced a series of projects to renovate the C Building. One of the projects completed circa 2010 renovated the interior of the building, creating new classrooms and office space. This involved removing a grain elevator used during the Sunshine Biscuit era. Other work involved constructing escalators in the building, overhauling passenger elevators, and converting three freight elevators into passenger elevators. In 2013, LaGuardia announced a project to install a new facade on the C Building, designed by Mitchell Giurgola Architects. An aluminum and terra cotta curtainwall would be installed atop the original terra cotta which was in disrepair, and new windows would also be installed. Both renovations improved the insulation and energy efficiency of the building. In addition, the two front entrances along Thomson Avenue were consolidated into a single main entrance. The project was completed in 2018.
The building features a large rooftop billboard sign which is illuminated at night. Over the years it has featured the names of its various tenants, including Loose-Wiles, Executone, and IDCNY. As part of the modern renovations to the C Building, the sign was fitted with branding for LaGuardia Community College.

====B Building====
The B Building or Center II is located between 30th Street and 30th Place, across from the C Building. The eight-story building was constructed in 1914 as the American Eveready Building within the Degnon Terminal, designed by Maynicke and Francke. The building occupies the northern half of the block between Thomson and 47th Avenues; the southern half was purchased by Eveready for a future expansion which was never built, and it is currently used as a parking lot. In 1929, the American Knit Goods company leased space in the building, beginning its use as a clothing and textile factory. By the 1940s, the plant was used by the Bernhard Ulmann Company and its subsidiary Bucilla Yarn.

The Bucilla Building became Center II of the International Design Center New York in 1985. As part of renovations for the design center created by I. M. Pei &amp; Partners, the open-air courtyards at the center of the building and the adjacent American Chicle Building (Center I) were covered with skylights to create atriums, while indoor walls were taken down to create more open interiors. By 1998, the International Design Center was renamed the Queens Atrium Corporate Center, and three floors from Center II were leased to DeVry University.

In 2006, LaGuardia Community College received $55 million allocated by the New York State Legislature for the purchase of new school buildings. This was used to lease two floors in the Bucilla Building beginning in 2008. In November 2009, the college opened a Healthcare Career Center inside the B Building.

Four of the eight floors of the building are occupied by the Queens High School Complex of the New York City Department of Education. The complex houses three public high schools: Bard High School Early College Queens, the Academy of Finance and Enterprise, and the High School of Applied Communication.

====Joseph Shenker Hall and E Building====
Located at the east end of the campus are the adjacent Joseph Shenker Hall, a.k.a. the Main Building or M Building; and the E Building or East Building, formerly the Annex Building. The two buildings occupy a two-block-wide site between 31st Street and Van Dam Street, with a common courtyard in between the two buildings along the de-mapped 31st Place.

The M Building was constructed in 1920 as the White Motor Company truck factory and service station, part of the Degnon Terminal. It replaced the company&#x27;s plant at Broadway and 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan. In 1941, the building was sold to the Ford Instrument Company, a subsidiary of Sperry Rand. The factory manufactured electronics for the United States Armed Forces&#x27; World War II efforts. Following the war, the factory produced missile guidance systems for the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, designed the controls and instrumentation for the USS Seawolf nuclear submarine, and created other computer systems such as aircraft navigation systems for the U.S. military.

The Ford Instrument building was purchased by CUNY for the college, then provisionally known as &quot;Community College IX&quot;, in 1970. &quot;Phase I&quot; renovations were conducted in the building prior to the opening of the college in September 1971. At this time, the building included basic classrooms and offices, a 115-seat library, and a &quot;Great Hall&quot; at the south end of the building for assemblies inherited from Sperry Rand. Additional &quot;Phase II&quot; renovations were completed in 1976, which added new classrooms and a theater, an atrium or mall referred to as an &quot;interior street&quot;, and converted the Great Hall into a gymnasium.

The E building was originally operated as the Equitable Paper Bag factory building. In 1954, the company claimed to manufacture the largest paper bag in the world, measuring long. The building was purchased by LaGuardia in 1984, with the college proposing a major project to renovate the building and connect it to the Main Building. The plans were drawn up by Danforth Toan of the Warner, Burns, Toan and Lund firm. Ground was broken for the project on November 16, 1989, and the new building complex was dedicated and opened on June 4, 1992. The project included the LaGuardia Performing Arts Center at the south end of the E Building, featuring an 800-seat proscenium theater, and a new campus library at the north end. The basement of the complex contains the athletic facilities of the college. This includes a six-lane NCAA regulation swimming pool constructed in the 1992 project, a fitness center, and a gymnasium for multiple sports including basketball.

On August 14, 2008, the college dedicated the M Building as &quot;Joseph Shenker Hall&quot; in honor of founding president Joseph Shenker. Shenker would pass away in September of that year.

====Middle College High School Campus====
At the far east end of the campus across from the M and E Buildings is the Middle College High School Campus, formerly the college&#x27;s L Building, located at Van Dam Street and 47th Avenue. The building houses two public high schools affiliated with the college, Middle College High School and International High School. Prior to educational use, the building served as the factory for X-Acto hobby knives, and as a depot for Pan American World Airways.

The building was purchased by the college in 1989. At this time, Middle College High School was moved into the building, with classrooms used by the high school during the day and by the college at night. In addition, an Early Child Care Learning Center for the children of college students was created in the building. On October 20, 1989, the building was dedicated as the Marie LaGuardia Building or L Building in honor of the wife of Fiorello La Guardia, who in 1982 donated records and memorabilia that formed the basis of the La Guardia and Wagner Archives.

An 820-seat addition or annex was completed in October 2012, designed by Goshow Architects. This allowed International High School to move from the M Building into the Middle College Campus.

===Former buildings===
====S Building====

The former S Building, a.k.a. the Satellite Building or Satellite College (31-11 Thomson Avenue), is located on Thomson Avenue across to the north of the Main Building. It was originally known as the Sony Building. It was also the headquarters and warehouse for Stroheim &amp; Romann, a fabric and interior design company.

LaGuardia began renting space in the building in 1973, occupying of space. It was the original home of Middle College High School when it opened in 1974. In 1984, the college began leasing the second and third floors of the building, in addition to the basement and first floor already in use. The building features a rooftop parking lot, which was used by the college. The college ceased use of the building in the 1990s, after the completion of the E &amp; M Building complex and the acquisition of the L Building.

In 2008, the New York Public Library began leasing the building. The library renovated the building for use as its Library Services Center, opening in 2010 at the cost of $50 million. The center contains a automated book sorting machine in the building&#x27;s basement, and a digital imaging center.
==Academics==
The College offers associate degrees and certificates in over 50 majors in Business and Technology, Liberal Arts, Health, Math, and Science.

==Enrollment==
As of the Fall of 2011, LaGuardia had an enrollment of 17,569 undergraduate students, 58% of them attending full-time, and 42% part-time. This undergraduate enrollment made the college the third largest community college in the CUNY system, after the Borough of Manhattan Community College and Kingsborough Community College.

==Student body==
LaGuardia&#x27;s student body is made up of people from 160 different countries who speak 127 languages natively.

<text>Ostashkov () is a town and the administrative center of Ostashkovsky District in Tver Oblast, Russia, on a peninsula at the southern shore of Lake Seliger, west of Tver, the administrative center of the oblast. Population: 

==History==

===Early developments===
The island of Klichen was first mentioned in a letter sent by Grand Duke Algirdas of Lithuania to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople in 1371. After the island was pillaged by Novgorod pirates several years later, two of Klichen&#x27;s surviving inhabitants, Ostashko and Timofey, moved to the mainland, where they founded the villages Ostashkovo and Timofeyevo, respectively. The former belonged to the Moscow Patriarchs, and the latter to the Joseph-Volokolamsk Monastery. In 1770, both villages were merged into the town of Ostashkov.

Ostashkov is commonly regarded as one of the finest Russian provincial towns. Its main streets were laid out in Neoclassical style after the plans of Ivan Starov (1772). Local landmarks include the Ascension Church (1689), the Trinity Cathedral (1697), the Monastery of the Sign (1673, 1730s, 1880s), and the mid-18th century Zhitny Cloister. There is also a fanciful column erected by the people of Ostashkov in 1787 to mark a spot where a wooden fort (1587) used to stand. The town&#x27;s pleasant architecture and attractive setting by the lake combine to make Ostashkov one of the most popular resorts in Western Russia.
The well-known Nilov Monastery is on Stolobny Island, about north from Ostashkov. It was the place where the &quot;Ostashkov Special Camp&quot; of the NKVD was and where roughly 6,300 Polish policemen and prisoners of war were kept before they were executed in Tver. Approximately 4,300 of their comrades, held in Kozelsk, were around this time executed in Smolensk Oblast at Stalin&#x27;s order in April and May 1940, in what is now known as the Katyn massacre.

In 1772, Ostashkov was granted town status, and Ostashkovsky Uyezd of Novgorod Governorate was established, with the seat in Ostashkov. In 1775, Tver Viceroyalty was formed from the lands which previously belonged to Moscow and Novgorod Governorates, and the area was transferred to Tver Viceroyalty, which in 1796 was transformed to Tver Governorate.

On 1 October 1929, governorates and uyezds were abolished, and Ostashkovsky District with the administrative center in Ostashkov was established. It belonged to Velikiye Luki Okrug of Western Oblast. On August 1, 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were subordinated directly to the oblast. On January 29, 1935 Kalinin Oblast was established, and Ostashkovsky District was transferred to Kalinin Oblast. In February 1963, during the abortive administrative reform by Nikita Khrushchev, Kirovsky and Penovsky Districts were merged into Ostashkovsky District.

=== Second World War ===
During World War II, Ostashkov was not occupied by German troops but until 1943 stayed in the immediate vicinity of the front lines. Soviet flotilla on the lake Seliger was involved in evacuation of Leningrad and Kalinin industrial equipment, military supplies, wounded and refugees.

In the period 1939 to 1941, during the first years of World War II, the monastery at Stolobny Island, about 10 km (6.2 mi) north of Ostashkov, was a prisoner-of-war camp of the Russian secret service NKVD, which held approximately 7,000 Poles who had been taken captive by the Soviet Union as a result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Between April 3 and April 19, 1940, 6,311 Polish officers from the POW camp were executed by shooting as part of the Katyn massacre, and buried near Mednoye.

On 25 September 1941 the frontline approached the town, and local authorities were ordered to evacuate all the industrial equipment from Ostashkov to Bely Gorodok. Only flotilla which were still involved in evacuation of the town were left.

The barges and ships were under constant bombings by Luftwaffe. On 7 October 1941 Colonel Belov ordered to evacuate flotilla and workshops towards Kalinin but after front near Rzhev collapsed, the flotilla returned from Selizharovo to Lake Seliger and stationed on the Krapivnya river. After the Germans entered the village of Selizharovo, all the barges were dispersed along the river and covered by trees and bushes. Crews were ready to destroy their barges with explosives.

However Germans failed to capture Ostashkov and the front line was stabilized. Due to German occupation of Kalinin the only way to supply the troops near Ostashkov was Lake Seliger waterway. Soviet lake flotilla command faced German bombardments in harsh winter conditions when the barges were blocked by ice. During spring 1942 flotilla faced the threat to be crushed by ice and washed away by the floods. However all the barges survived the spring and became ready to the 1942 navigation. As the northern lake shore was occupied, all the northern waterways were under shelling by German artillery. The new waterways across the Khrestnoye, Seremo and Glubokoye lakes, which were not considered navigable earlier, were used for evacuation of the wounded and shipping the military supplies. During the German air raids steamers and barges were hiding near the islands. Wooden shores also served as a shelter for the ships.

Ostashkov workshop which remained in the town, repaired the damaged ships. As the Ostashkov tannery was evacuated to Kazakhstan the only industries remaining in the town were: workshop, power plant, mechanized bakery and mill. All of them were mined in case of capture by Germans. The power plant was operated by several workers and it was often bombed by Luftwaffe. It also lacked fuel and power plant workers had to disassemble the wooden buildings inside the power plant territory and use them as a fuel.

There were 63 hospitals in the city. All of them were powered from the local power plant. Some of them were bombed by German aviation. All the evacuated factory buildings were used as a military warehouses. Food and military supplies were transported to the front lines by barges and narrow gauge railway.

The frontline was in a swampy and wooded area. Both sides built many trenches, pillboxes and infrastructure. In summer 1942 most of the Ostashkov area was liberated from German occupation and the frontline was moved far away from the town.

In January 1943 most of the evacuated industries were returned into the town. Fish factory, woodworking plant, mechanized bakery, power plant, printing house, tannery and ship repairing workshops functioned in Ostashkov.

=== Post-war period ===

On January 12, 1965, Selizharovsky District (which occupied the same area as Kirovsky District), and on December 27, 1973, Penovsky District were . In 1990, Kalinin Oblast was renamed Tver Oblast.

Nowadays the town is popular among tourists from Moscow and Saint Petersburg as a nearby resort near the Seliger lake. Educational forum held since 2005 at the lake shore near Ostashkov.

The lake also attracts thousands of campers from all over the nearby cities. Ostashkov itself also attracts tourists because it contains a lot of cultural heritage monuments. Since September 30, 2018 Russian Railways established regular train connection with steam locomotive in addition to regular diesel powered trains. Such move of promoting local tourism by using old steam locomotive and old time - styled traincars, was first of its kind in Russia, and soon was followed by another tourism sites in Russia(such as Ruskeala in Karelia).

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Ostashkov serves as the administrative center of Ostashkovsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Ostashkovsky District as Ostashkov Urban Settlement. As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban settlement status and is a part of Ostashkovsky Municipal District.

===Industry===
The main industrial enterprise in Ostashkovsky District is Ostashkov Leather Factory. Additionally, enterprises of timber, textile, and food industries are present.

===Transportation===

The railway connecting Bologoye with Velikiye Luki runs through Ostashkov. There are daily suburb trains to Bologoye and Velikiye Luki (except for Monday and Wednesday). 
There is also regular(on Saturday) steam locomotive train connection with Bologoe(station located on the Moscow - Saint Petersburg railway). Such move of promoting local tourism by using old steam locomotive and old time - styled train cars, with ticket price equal to ordinary suburb train, was first of its kind in Russia.

There are also suburb trains going to Kuvshinovo twice a week (on Monday and Friday).
There are infrequent trains to Saint Petersburg and Moscow, mostly during summer touristic season.

Ostashkov is connected by road with Torzhok via Kuvshinovo. This road has access to M10 highway, connecting Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Ostashkov is further connected with Staritsa via Selizharovo, with Andreapol via Peno, and with Demyansk and Maryovo. There are also local roads, with bus traffic originating from Ostashkov.

<text>Ricardo Benjamín Salinas Pliego (born 19 October 1955) is a Mexican businessman, founder and chairman of Grupo Salinas, a corporate conglomerate with interests in telecommunications, media, financial services, and retail.

An outspoken supporter of minarchism and neoliberalism, he is the third richest person in Mexico and the 172nd richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of US$13.6 billion in February 2021.

==Career==
Ricardo Salinas Pliego is a CPA graduate of the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM). After earning an MBA at Tulane University, he joined Elektra in 1981 as import manager. He learned the business moves when the company faced dire financial straits at the continuing devaluation of the eighties. Between 1981 and 1986, Salinas experimented with other businesses such as a restaurant in Monterrey, satellite dishes and the sale of systems multi communication.

In 1987 Ricardo succeeded his father Hugo Salinas Price as CEO of Grupo Elektra. The company began as a family-owned furniture manufacturing company called Salinas &amp; Rocha founded in 1906 by Salinas&#x27; great-grandfather, Benjamin Salinas. In 1950, Hugo Salinas Rocha created Grupo Elektra and when Ricardo Salinas became CEO of the company in 1987 he refocused Elektra on basic products: appliances, electronics, and furniture. Significantly, he developed at Elektra a vast new consumer market among Mexico&#x27;s lower middle income consumers by providing credit sales and diverse financial products and services.

Grupo Elektra expanded further and became Mexico&#x27;s biggest consumer-finance company when, in 2002, it won the first banking license granted to any Mexican institution in nearly a decade. The strategy was to build new markets by creating new buying power among classes of people largely ignored by most other major Mexican businesses. Thus was born Banco Azteca, which currently has operations in Mexico, Panama, Guatemala and Honduras. Subsequently, Grupo Elektra obtained two financial licenses from the federal government to create Seguros Azteca and Afore Azteca.

Salinas is also chairman of TV Azteca, one of the world&#x27;s two largest producers of Spanish-language television programming. Under his leadership, TV Azteca broke Mexico&#x27;s long-standing television monopoly through the successful privatization of a media package offered by the government.

In 2001, TV Azteca launched Azteca America, a wholly owned Spanish-language broadcasting network aimed at the 50 million-strong Hispanic population of the United States. Azteca America had affiliates in 70 markets, including Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, Miami and Houston, reaching 89 percent of the Hispanic population in the U.S. Azteca America was sold to HC2 Holdings in 2017.

In 2003, Salinas bought Iusacell (the first cell phone company in Mexico) and four years later, merged it with Unefon, another cell phone company, founded by him in 1999. However, in early 2015, Grupo Salinas announced the sale of Iusacell to AT&amp;T Today, with Totalplay, offers the most innovative internet and television services and telephony via fiber optics to home. Also, Totalplay Empresarial provides broadband internet access video surveillance, broadband interfaces, videoconferencing, among other services to institutions and companies throughout Mexico.

In 2012, Grupo Elektra acquired Advance America, —currently Purpose Financial—, a company that provides short-term non- bank loans in the United States. Also put into operation Punto Casa de Bolsa. The Group operates more than six thousand points of contact in Mexico, United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Peru and Panama.

Salinas has participated and addressed The World Economic Forum, The Economist Roundtable on Mexico, the Young Presidents&#x27; Organization, UCLA, the Institute of the Americas, Harvard Business School and TED, where he discussed issues related to globalization, education, entrepreneurship, freedom and opportunity in the BOP. He also has a blog where he publishes his business, political, economic and cultural ideas. His articles have been published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;The Hill&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; in Spanish, &quot;La Opinión&quot;, and regularly writes in the Mexican press. Mr. Salinas was the first Mexican to elect the board of trustees of the Aspen Institute.

It was announced in 2020 that Salinas had 10% of his liquid portfolio invested in Bitcoin.

==Philanthropy==
Salinas formed the nonprofit Fundación Azteca in 1997 to address a broad range of social problems with ongoing campaigns in healthcare and nutrition, education, and the protection of the environment. It is a foundation that finances and supports other foundations. Fundación Azteca has raised millions of dollars, benefiting hundreds of thousands of lives.

In April 2021, the Ricardo B. Salinas Pliego Center was inaugurated, a space that seeks to promote the development of ideas that contribute to the transformation of Mexico, based on six lines of action: Freedom, Rule of Law, Education, Leadership, Art and Culture, and Innovation and Entrepreneurship. The initiative is made up of the following programs: Arte &amp; Cultura, through which artistic and cultural activities are promoted to raise the quality of life of society; Caminos de la Libertad, a space for reflection on different aspects of freedom that seeks to raise awareness of its value and Kybernus, which promotes the formation of young leaders from the local level.

==Controversies==
Salinas has been involved in a series of political and financial scandals (which include investigations by the American Securities and Exchange Commission and the Mexican Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores), and has been linked to ex-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Salinas was charged by the American Securities and Exchange Commission in January 2005 with being engaged in an elaborate scheme to conceal Salinas&#x27;s role in a series of transactions through which he personally profited by $109 million. The SEC complaint also alleged that Salinas and Padilla sold millions of dollars of TV Azteca stock while Salinas&#x27;s self-dealing remained undisclosed to the market place. This was settled in September 2006 with Salinas required to pay $7.5M while not admitting guilt. Esteban Moctezuma (ex-Secretary of Interior of PRI President Ernesto Zedillo), was appointed as chief executive officer of Fundación Azteca in 2002 by Salinas Pliego. His daughter, Ninfa, entered to the PVEM party (linked to the PRI party, some old but now of recent political endeavor) in 2009.

===Football game and presidential debate===

Salinas decided to air the 2011–12 quarter final game between Tigres de la UANL and Monarcas Morelia, two professional football teams from the Mexican Primera División, during the same time as the presidential debate of the 2012 Mexican general elections. The day of these two events were set for 6 May 2012.

He posted on Twitter the following message on 30 April 2012:
Emilio Azcárraga Jean, the CEO of Televisa, posted a message on Twitter to &quot;clarify the doubts&quot; by stating that it was not Televisa who was planning to air the game between Tigres and Morelia, but rather TV Azteca, the closest television competitor to his company.

The Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) and its president, Leonardo Valdés Zurita, asked for TV Azteca to not air the game at the same time as the presidential debate. According to Zurita, the IFE has already set up the permissions and invitations to carry out the debate, but also recognized that other media companies can air programs they consider relevant. In addition, the electoral councils in Mexico recognized that this incident will leave the Mexican people with two difficult dilemmas: &quot;watch football or the presidential debate between Josefina Vázquez Mota (PAN), Enrique Peña Nieto (PRI), Andrés Manuel López Obrador (PRD) and Gabriel Quadri de la Torre (PANAL).&quot; Nonetheless, the majority of the messages posted on Twitter criticized Salinas Pliego for this incident.

===Anonymous group and Grupo Salinas===
Following the decision of Salinas, the internet group Anonymous &quot;attacked&quot; the official website of Grupo Salinas on 1 May 2012, posting on Twitter that they wanted the presidential debate and not the football game. The official webpage—www.gruposalinas.com—was not available for some time.

===TV Azteca accepts to air debate===
On 3 May 2012, the IFE acknowledged that TV Azteca decided to air the presidential debate on XHTVM-TV, commonly referred to as Proyecto 40. On his defense, Salinas said on 4 May 2012 that the &quot;majority of the population is not interested in the presidential debate.&quot; He claimed that only 15% of the population is interested in the debate, while 54% of them claim they are not interested at all. If the statistics were different, he said, then he would have adjusted his strategy. Salinas then said that his business &quot;understands well&quot; the preferences of the population and takes decisions accordingly.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Salinas Pliego (previously an economic ally of President López Obrador) repeatedly called the public to ignore official social distancing and quarantine measures, expressing concerns that the economy and freedom should not be tampered with. He ordered his tens of thousands of employees at his several companies to remain working normally, the private schools he owns remained open, and via his TV channel, TV Azteca, the businessman disseminated opposition to government health measures to the population at large.

<doc id="651309" wikidata="Q5803319" url="?curid=651309" title="Randle, Washington">
<text>Randle is a small town in eastern Lewis County, Washington, United States. Randle is located on U.S. Route 12 and is notable as the northeastern access point to the Mount St. Helens Windy Ridge viewpoint, by way of forest service roads that cut through the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.

Randle is located next to the Cowlitz River and is about north of the Cispus River, a tributary of the Cowlitz. The Cowlitz River winds westward through a rural valley in Randle known locally as &quot;Big Bottom Valley,&quot; which is reflective of the fact that the valley floor, in certain areas, is &quot;big&quot;. The flat, fertile land is, in places, more than wide.

==Etymology==
An 1889 petition to open a post office for the community was created by an early settler of the area, James Randles, but it lacked a town name in the paperwork. Due to a clerical decision by the then existing rules of the Washington Territory, the surname of Randles (excluding the &quot;s&quot;) was determined as the moniker for the town.

==History==
William Joerk explored in the area around 1882 and the townsite was officially founded in 1902. One of the first to settle the town was James L. Randles in 1886 who helped deliver mail in the site&#x27;s infancy and would spearhead the creation of a post office. Randles would pass away in 1920 and be buried in Centralia due to winter conditions at the time of his death. In 2023, his body was ceremoniously reburied next to family members in a Randle cemetery.

The White Pass High School was built in 1951. In 2011, it was demolished and built into a new school.

In 2021, a charge of sexual assault was filed against the rapper and songwriter, Lil Mosey; the incident, occurring in Randle, was reported to have happened in 2020. A trial and acquittal of the musician took place at the Lewis County courthouse in Chehalis in early 2023.

== Geography ==
Randle is the center of the White Pass School District, which, in addition to Randle, covers the small towns of Glenoma, Washington, and Packwood, Washington (its school district jurisdiction includes a vast rural expanse in extreme eastern Lewis County, terminating at the Cascade Mountains and the county border with Yakima County). The community of Randle is located within Census Tract 9719 of Lewis County.

===Climate===
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Randle has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

==Arts and culture==

===Historic buildings and sites===
Randle is home to the Randle Ranger Station-Work Center, a complex of rustic buildings built by the Civilian Conservation Corps and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The North Fork Guard Station No. 1142, another NRHP site, is located near the town.

==Economy==

In 2019, Crystal Geyser Water Company purchased property in Randle and proposed the construction of a water bottling plant. The proposal drew extensive opposition from local residents who were concerned about damage to the Cowlitz River watershed and industrialization of the area. In 2022, Lewis County PUD authorized a deal to acquire the property from Crystal Geyser to expand the adjacent campground and wilderness areas along the Cowlitz River.

==Parks and recreation==
The community is located northeast of several recreation areas, including Riffe Lake, Taidnapam Park, and Cowlitz Falls Park which is located on the Cispus River near its junction to the reservoir, Lake Scanewa. The Cowlitz Falls Campground, also known as Leonard “Bud” Allen Park, is a park under the control of the Lewis County PUD and is situated near the Cowltiz River, southwest of the town center.

==Education==
The White Pass High School was built in 1951. In 2011, it was demolished and built into a new school.

== Politics ==
Note that the voting information is based on the Randle East and Randle West precincts only. As this is an unincorporated community, there are no defined bounds, and the precinct may be incongruous with the census boundaries.

The 2020 election included votes for candidates of the Libertarian Party and Green Party.

==Infrastructure==
The community is among 8 locations that are part of an EV installation project on the White Pass Scenic Byway. The program will stretch from the White Pass Ski Area to Chehalis and is run in partnership with Lewis County PUD, Twin Transit, state government agencies, and local community efforts. The venture began in 2023 from two grants totaling over $1.8 million.

The Timberland Regional Library system built a new 3,400-square-foot public library in Randle that formally opened to the public in January 2025. It replaced a previous library location in a rented space.

<text>The commanding officer (CO) or commander, or sometimes, if the incumbent is a general officer, commanding general (CG), is the officer in command of a military unit. The commanding officer has ultimate authority over the unit, and is usually given wide latitude to run the unit as they see fit, within the bounds of military law. In this respect, commanding officers have significant responsibilities (for example, the use of force, finances, equipment, the Geneva Conventions), duties (to higher authority, mission effectiveness, duty of care to personnel), and powers (for example, discipline and punishment of personnel within certain limits of military law).

In some countries, commanding officers may be of any commissioned rank. Usually, there are more officers than command positions available, and time spent in command is generally a key aspect of promotion, so the role of commanding officer is highly valued. The commanding officer is often assisted by an executive officer (XO) or second-in-command (2i/c), who handles personnel and day-to-day matters, and a senior enlisted advisor. Larger units may also have staff officers responsible for various responsibilities.

==Commonwealth==
===Army and Royal Marines===
In the British Army, Royal Marines, and many other Commonwealth military and paramilitary organisations, the commanding officer of a unit is appointed. Thus the office of CO is an appointment.
The appointment of commanding officer is exclusive to commanders of major units (regiments, battalions and similar sized units). It is customary for a commanding officer to hold the rank of lieutenant colonel, and they are usually referred to within the unit simply as &quot;the colonel&quot; or the CO. &quot;The colonel&quot; may also refer to the holder of an honorary appointment of a senior officer who oversees the non-operational affairs of a regiment. However, the rank of the appointment holder and the holder&#x27;s appointment are separate. That is, not all lieutenant colonels are COs, and although most COs are lieutenant colonels, that is not a requirement of the appointment.

Sub-units and minor units (companies, squadrons and batteries) and formations (brigades, divisions, corps and armies) do not have a commanding officer. The officer in command of a minor unit holds the appointment of officer commanding (OC). Higher formations have a commander (e.g. brigade commander) or a general officer commanding (GOC). Area commands have a commander-in-chief (e.g. C-in-C Land Army, C-in-C British Army of the Rhine). The OC of a sub-unit or minor unit is today customarily a major (although formerly usually a captain in infantry companies and often also in cavalry squadrons), although again the rank of the appointment holder and the holder&#x27;s appointment are separate and independent of each other.

In some cases, independent units smaller than a sub-unit (e.g. a military police platoon that reports directly to a formation such as a brigade) will also have an OC appointed. In these cases, the officer commanding can be a captain or even a lieutenant. The commanders of administrative organisations, such as schools or wings, may also be designated officers commanding or commanders.

Appointments such as CO and OC may have specific powers associated with them. For example, they may have statutory powers to promote soldiers or to deal with certain disciplinary offences and award certain punishments. The CO of a unit may have the power to sentence an offender to 28 days&#x27; detention, whereas the OC of a sub-unit may have the power to sentence an offender to three days&#x27; restriction of privileges.

Commanders of units smaller than sub-units (e.g. platoons, troops and sections) are not specific appointments and officers or NCOs who fill those positions are simply referred to as the commander or leader (e.g. platoon commander, troop leader, section commander/leader, etc.).

===Air force===
In the Royal Air Force, the title of commanding officer is reserved for station commanders or commanders of independent units, including flying squadrons. As with the British Army, the post of a commander of a lesser unit such as an administrative wing, squadron or flight is referred to as the officer commanding (OC).

===Navy===
In the Royal Navy and many others, commanding officer is the official title of the commander of any ship, unit or installation. However, they are referred to as &quot;the captain&quot; no matter what their actual rank, or informally as &quot;skipper&quot; or even &quot;boss&quot;.

==United States==

In the United States, the status of commanding officer is duly applied to all commissioned officers who hold lawful command over a military unit, ship, or installation.

===Army===
The commanding officer of a company, usually a captain, is referred to as the company commander (or the battery/troop commander for artillery/cavalry) units. The commanding officer of a battalion (or squadron of cavalry/armored cavalry) is usually a lieutenant colonel. The commanding officer of a brigade, a colonel, is the brigade commander. At the division level and higher, however, the commanding officer is referred to as the commanding general, as these officers hold general officer rank.

Warrant officers in the United States Armed Forces are single career-track officers that can, and occasionally do, hold command positions within certain specialty units, i.e. Special Forces and Army Aviation. However, warrant officers usually do not command if a commissioned officer is present; normally they serve as executive officer (2IC).

===Marine Corps===

The commanding officer of a company, usually a captain, is referred to as the company commander or the battery commander (for field artillery and low altitude air defense units). The commanding officer of a battalion or a squadron (Marine aviation), is usually a lieutenant colonel. The commanding officer of a regiment, aviation group, or Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is a colonel. At the Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB), Marine Logistics Group (MLG), Marine Division (MARDIV), Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW), Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), and Fleet Marine Force (FMF) levels; however, the commanding officer is referred to as the commanding general, as these officers hold general officer rank.

===Navy and Coast Guard===
In the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard, commanding officer is the official title of the commander of a ship, but they are usually referred to as &quot;the Captain&quot; regardless of their actual rank: &quot;Any naval officer who commands a ship, submarine or other vessel is addressed by naval custom as &#x27;captain&#x27; while aboard in command, regardless of their actual rank.&quot; They may be informally referred to as &quot;Skipper&quot;, though allowing or forbidding the use of this form of address is the commanding officer&#x27;s prerogative.

A prospective commanding officer (PCO) is a U.S. Navy officer who has been selected for his/her own command. The term is used in correspondence or in reference to the officer before they assume command of the unit (ship, squadron, unit, etc.).

If the sailor in command of a unit is an enlisted member, rather than a commissioned or warrant officer, he or she is referred to as the &quot;officer in charge&quot; rather than &quot;commanding officer&quot;. In the Coast Guard it is common for smaller cutters to be commanded by a chief petty officer.

===Air Force===
In the United States Air Force, the commanding officer of a unit is similarly referred to as the unit commander, such as squadron commander, group commander, wing commander, and so forth. Squadron commanders (the base unit of the United States Air Force) are usually majors or lieutenant colonels. Group commanders (made up of two or more squadrons) are usually colonels, while wing commanders may be colonels (typical wings) or generals (larger wings).

<doc id="651311" wikidata="Q6220" url="?curid=651311" title="Subdwarf">
<text>A subdwarf, sometimes denoted by &quot;sd&quot;, is a star with luminosity class VI under the Yerkes spectral classification system. They are defined as stars with luminosity 1.5 to 2 magnitudes lower than that of main-sequence stars of the same spectral type. On a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram subdwarfs appear to lie below the main sequence.

The term &quot;subdwarf&quot; was coined by Gerard Kuiper in 1939, to refer to a series of stars with anomalous spectra that were previously labeled as &quot;intermediate white dwarfs&quot;.

Since Kuiper coined the term, the subdwarf type has been extended to lower-mass stars than were known at the time. Astronomers have also discovered an entirely different group of blue-white subdwarfs, making two distinct categories:
* Cool subdwarfs
* Hot subdwarfs

== Cool (red) subdwarfs ==

Like ordinary main-sequence stars, cool subdwarfs (of spectral types G to M) produce their energy from hydrogen fusion. The explanation of their underluminosity lies in their low metallicity: These stars are not enriched in elements heavier than helium. The lower metallicity decreases the opacity of their outer layers and decreases the radiation pressure, resulting in a smaller, hotter star for a given mass. This lower opacity also allows them to emit a higher percentage of ultraviolet light for the same spectral type relative to a Population I star, a feature known as the ultraviolet excess.
Usually members of the Milky Way&#x27;s halo, they frequently have high space velocities relative to the Sun.

Cool subdwarfs of spectral type L and T exist, for example ULAS J131610.28+075553.0 with spectral type sdT6.5.

Subclasses of cool subdwarfs are as following:
; cool subdwarf: Examples: Kapteyn&#x27;s Star (sdM1), GJ 1062 (sdM2.5)
; extreme subdwarf: Example: APMPM J0559-2903 (esdM7)
; ultrasubdwarf: Example: LSPM J0822+1700 (usdM7.5)

=== Subdwarfs of type L, T and Y ===
The low metallicity of subdwarfs is coupled with their old age. The early universe had a low content of elements heavier than helium and formed stars and brown dwarfs with lower metallicity. Only later supernovae, planetary nebulae and neutron star mergers enriched the universe with heavier elements. The old subdwarfs belong therefore often to the older structures in our Milky Way, mainly the thick disk and the galactic halo. Objects in the thick disk or the halo have a high space velocity compared to the Sun, which belongs to the younger thin disk. A high proper motion can be used to discover subdwarfs. Additionally the subdwarfs have spectral features that make them different from subdwarfs with solar metallicity. All subdwarfs share the suppression of the near-infrared spectrum, mainly the H-band and K-band. The low metallicity increase the collision induced absorption of hydrogen, causing this suppressed near-infrared spectrum. This is seen as blue infrared colors compared to brown dwarfs with solar metallicity. The low metallicity also change other absorption features, such as deeper CaH and TiO bands at 0.7 μm in L-subdwarfs, a weaker VO band at 0.8 μm in early L-subdwarfs and stronger FeH band at 0.99 μm for mid- to late L-subdwarfs. 2MASS J0532+8246 was discovered in 2003 as the first L-type subdwarf, which was later re-classified as an extreme subdwarf. The L-type subdwarfs have subtypes similar to M-type subdwarfs: The subtypes subdwarf (sd), extreme subdwarfs (esd) and ultra subdwarfs (usd), which are defined by their decreasing metallicity, compared to solar metallicity, which is defined on a logarithmic scale:
* subdwarfs have formula_1
* extreme subdwarfs have formula_2 and
* ultra subdwarfs have formula_3
* The Sun sets the scale at formula_4 by definition.

For T-type subdwarfs only a small sample of subdwarfs and extreme subdwarfs is known.

2MASSI J0937347+293142 is the first object that was discovered in 2002 as a T-type subdwarf candidate and in 2006 it was confirmed to have low metallicity. The first two extreme subdwarfs of type T were discovered in 2020 by scientists and volunteers of the Backyard Worlds project. The first extreme subdwarfs of type T are WISEA 0414−5854 and WISEA 1810−1010. Subdwarfs of type T and Y have less methane in their atmosphere, due to the lower concentration of carbon in these subdwarfs. This leads to a bluer W1-W2 (WISE) or ch1-ch2 (Spitzer) color, compared to objects with similar temperature, but with solar metallicity. The color of T-types as a single classification criterion can be misleading. The closest directly imaged exoplanet, COCONUTS-2b, was first classified as a subdwarf of type T due to its color, while not showing a high tangential velocity. Only in 2021 it was identified as an exoplanet.

The first Y-type subdwarf candidate was discovered in 2021, the brown dwarf WISE 1534–1043, which shows a moderate red Spitzer Space Telescope color (ch1-ch2 = 0.925±0.039 mag). The very red color between J and ch2 (J-ch2 &gt; 8.03 mag) and the absolute brightness would suggest a much redder ch1-ch2 color of about 2.4 to 3 mag. Due to the agreement with new subdwarf models, together with the high tangential velocity of 200 km/s, Kirkpatrick, Marocco &quot;et al&quot;. (2021) argue that the most likely explanation is a cold very low-metal brown dwarf, maybe the first subdwarf of type Y.

Binaries can help to determine the age and mass of these subdwarfs. The subdwarf VVV 1256−62B (sdL3) was discovered as a companion to a halo white dwarf, allowing the age to be measured at 8.4 to 13.8 billion years. It has a mass of 84 to 87 , making VVV 1256−62B likely a red dwarf star. The subdwarf Wolf 1130C (sdT8) is the companion of an old subdwarf-white dwarf binary, which is estimated to be older than 10 billion years. It has a mass of 44.9 , making it a brown dwarf.

=== Examples of cool subdwarfs ===
* Kapteyn&#x27;s Star
* Groombridge 1830
* Mu Cassiopeiae
* 2MASS J05325346+8246465, a possible halo brown dwarf and the first substellar subdwarf.
* SSSPM J1549-3544

== Hot (blue) subdwarfs ==

Hot subdwarfs, of bluish spectral types O and B are an entirely different class of object than cool subdwarfs; they are also called &quot;extreme horizontal-branch stars&quot;.
Hot subdwarf stars represent a late stage in the evolution of some stars, caused when a red giant star loses its outer hydrogen layers before the core begins to fuse helium.

The reasons for their premature loss of their hydrogen envelope are unclear, but the interaction of stars in a binary star system is thought to be one of the main mechanisms. Single subdwarfs may be the result of a merger of two white dwarfs or gravitational influence from substellar companions. B-type subdwarfs, being more luminous than white dwarfs, are a significant component in the hot star population of old stellar systems, such as globular clusters and elliptical galaxies.

===Heavy metal subdwarfs===
The heavy metal subdwarfs are a type of hot subdwarf star with high concentrations of heavy metals. The metals detected include germanium, strontium, yttrium, zirconium and lead. Known heavy metal subdwarfs include HE 2359-2844, LS IV-14 116, and HE 1256-2738.

<text>Acamptopappus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae described as a genus in 1873.

&quot;Acamptopappus&quot; is native to the deserts in southwestern North America. The name is derived from &quot;a-&quot; (not), &quot;campto-&quot; (bent), and &quot;pappus&quot; (down). They are also commonly known as goldenheads.

&quot;Acamptopappus&quot; plants are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Coleophora acamtopappi&quot; which feeds on &quot;A. sphaerocephalus&quot;.

<doc id="651319" wikidata="Q625399" url="?curid=651319" title="Arracacia xanthorrhiza">
<text>Arracacia xanthorrhiza is a root vegetable that originates in the Andes, whose starchy taproot is a popular food item across South America where it is a major commercial crop.

==Common names==
Being a South American plant, its most common names are in either Spanish or Portuguese, the two most spoken languages in that continent.

The name arracacha (or racacha) was borrowed into Spanish from Quechua &quot;raqacha&quot;, and is used in the Andean region. The plant is also called &quot;apio&quot; or &quot;apio criollo&quot; (&quot;Creole celery&quot;) in Venezuela, &quot;apio&quot; in Puerto Rico, &quot;zanahoria blanca&quot; (&quot;white carrot&quot;) in Ecuador, and virraca in Peru.

Its Portuguese names are usually derived from the plant&#x27;s similarity to other well known vegetables and roots. It is known as either mandioquinha (&quot;little cassava&quot;) or batata-baroa (&quot;baroness potato&quot;) in most regions of Brazil, but other common names in certain regions of that country include batata-salsa (“parsley potato”), batata fiúza (&quot;trustworthy potato&quot;), cenourinha-branca (&quot;little white carrot&quot;), and cenourinha-amarela or simply cenoura-amarela (&quot;little yellow carrot&quot; or simply &quot;yellow carrot&quot;), among others.

It is sometimes called white carrot or yellow cassava in English, but these names may also refer to other vegetables.

==Description and varieties==
The leaves of arracacha are similar to parsley, and vary from dark green to purple. The roots resemble fat short carrots, with off-white skin. The interior may be white, yellow, or purple.

==Cultivation==

The plant is native to the region west of the Andes and grows at altitudes varying from 200 to 3,600 meters with an optimal altitude of between 1,800 and 2,500 meters. It is frequently grown with other crops such as maize, beans, and coffee. The plant is very susceptible to viruses and is slow to mature (10–12 months), but requires much less fertilizer input than the potato. Its harvest season in the Southern Hemisphere spans from January to September. Arracacia&#x27;s roots need to be picked promptly lest they become woody. They have a short shelf life and must reach consumers within a week of harvest. Fresh arracachas can be kept in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 weeks.

Arracacha cultivation can be very lucrative. It was imported into Brazil in the 19th century and has been grown commercially since the 1960s. Brazilian crop improvement programs have developed varieties that are ready to harvest in seven months.

==Culinary uses==
The most widely used part of arracacia is its starchy root. It cannot be eaten raw, but when cooked it develops a distinctive flavor and aroma that have been described as &quot;a delicate blend of celery, cabbage and roasted chestnuts.&quot;

The boiled root is used in similar ways to boiled potatoes, including being served as side dishes, mashed or whipped into purées, formed into dumplings and &quot;gnocchi&quot;, as an ingredient in pastries, or creamed into soups, commonly garnished with chopped cilantro and croutons, though arracacia&#x27;s flavor is stronger, and (depending on the variety) its color is more brilliant.

In the Andes region, arracacia is made into fried chips, biscuits, and ground into a coarse flour. The small size of arracacia starch grains make it highly digestible, and so purées and soups made from it are considered excellent as food for babies and young children.

The young stems can be eaten cooked or in salads, and the leaves can be fed to livestock.

==Nutrition==
100 grams of arracacha provide about 100 calories, 26g of which are dry matter, 23g being carbohydrate, and less than 1g of protein. The plant is rich in calcium, having four times as much as potatoes.

The yellow cultivar contains substantial amounts of carotenoid pigments, precursors to vitamin A, to the point that excessive consumption of arracachas may cause yellowing of the skin, a condition that is not considered to be harmful.

<doc id="651320" wikidata="Q113695405" url="?curid=651320" title="Mess">
<text>The mess (also called a mess deck aboard ships) is a designated area where military personnel socialize, eat and (in some cases) live. The term is also used to indicate the groups of military personnel who belong to separate messes, such as the officers&#x27; mess, the chief petty officer mess, and the enlisted mess. In some civilian societies this military usage has been extended to the eating arrangements of other disciplined services such as fire fighting and police forces.

The root of &quot;mess&quot; is the Old French &quot;mes&quot;, &quot;portion of food&quot; (cf. modern French &quot;mets&quot;), drawn from the Latin verb &quot;mittere&quot;, meaning &quot;to send&quot; and &quot;to put&quot; (cf. modern French &quot;mettre&quot;), the original sense being &quot;a course of a meal put on the table&quot;; cfr. also the modern Italian &quot;portata&quot; with the same meaning, past participle of &quot;portare&quot;, &quot;to bring&quot;. This sense of &quot;mess&quot;, which appeared in English in the 13th century, was often used for cooked or liquid dishes in particular, as in the &quot;mess of pottage&quot; (porridge or soup) or Eton mess.

== Canada ==
Messing in the Canadian Forces generally follows the British model (see United Kingdom below), from which most traditions have descended. Basic regulations regarding the establishment and administration of messes is contained in the King&#x27;s Regulations and Orders and the Canadian Forces Administrative Orders.

As in the British Forces, there are normally three messes: the officers&#x27; mess (called the wardroom in naval establishments), for commissioned officers and officer cadets; the warrant officers&#x27; and sergeants&#x27; mess (Navy: chiefs&#x27; and petty officers&#x27; mess), for senior non-commissioned officers and warrant officers; and the junior ranks mess, for junior non-commissioned officers, privates, and seamen. Some bases, such as CFB Kingston in the 1980s, had a master corporals&#x27; mess separate from the junior ranks&#x27;; all of these, with the exception of the CFB Valcartier master corporals&#x27; mess (known as the ), have been amalgamated with the junior ranks&#x27; messes. Certain other bases, mainly training establishments such as HMCS &quot;Venture&quot; have messes known as the gun room for the use of subordinate officers (naval or officer cadets).

Most bases and stations have three messes (officers&#x27;, warrant officers&#x27; and sergeants&#x27;, and junior ranks&#x27;). Many of these establishments have lodger units (such as air squadrons, army regiments, etc.) who also have their own messes. All of His Majesty&#x27;s Canadian ships have three messes aboard; this extends to Naval Reserve divisions and other naval shore establishments which bear the title HMCS (see stone frigate). Due to limited budgets and declining revenues, many messes have been forced to close or amalgamate: for example, at CFS St. John&#x27;s, the junior ranks&#x27; mess of the Newfoundland Militia District closed, its members moving to the station&#x27;s junior ranks&#x27;; the station&#x27;s officers&#x27; mess and warrant officers&#x27; and sergeants&#x27; mess later amalgamated.

Headdress is not worn in Canadian messes, except:
* by personnel on duty, such as a duty or watch officer, or the military police;
* as permitted on special occasions, such as during costume parties, theme events, etc.;
* by personnel for whom wearing headgear is mandatory (e.g. for religious reasons).

All Canadian Forces personnel, regular and reserve, must belong to a mess, and are termed &quot;ordinary members&quot; of their particular mess. Although normally on federal property, messes have been ordered to comply with the legal drinking age laws of their province; for example, an 18-year-old soldier may legally consume alcohol in a Quebec mess, but not in one in Ontario, where the legal age is 19 years. However, despite being underage, the soldier may not be prohibited &quot;entry&quot; into the mess.

Canadian Forces personnel are normally welcome in any mess of their appropriate rank group, regardless of element; thus a regimental sergeant-major of an infantry battalion is welcome in a chiefs&#x27; and petty officers&#x27; mess (inter-service rivalries notwithstanding). Personnel of a different rank (except as noted below) must ask for permission to enter; that may be granted by the president of the mess committee, his designate, or the senior member present.

These restrictions are normally waived on certain special occasions, when the messes are &quot;opened&quot; to all personnel, regardless of rank. These occasions may include (and will be locally published by the mess committee)::
* New Year&#x27;s Day, January 1, called a &quot;levée&quot;
* Canada Day, July 1
* Remembrance Day, November 11

The commanding officer of the establishment or unit that owns the mess is permitted access to all his messes; thus a ship&#x27;s captain has access to the vessel&#x27;s chiefs&#x27; and petty officers&#x27; mess, the commanding officer of a regiment may enter any of the regimental messes, and the base commander is welcome in any of the base&#x27;s messes. In practice, commanding officers rarely enter anything other than the officers&#x27; mess unless invited, as a point of etiquette. In addition, duty personnel — such as a duty NCO or officer of the watch — or the military police have access to any and all messes for the purposes of maintaining good order and discipline. Chaplains are usually welcomed in all messes.

As in the UK, Canadian messes are run by the mess committee, a group democratically elected by the members of the mess. One exception is on warships, where the president of the junior ranks mess is appointed by the commanding officer. The committee members are generally the same as those of their British counterparts, with the addition of special representatives for such things as sports, housing, morale, etc. These positions are normally spelled out in the mess constitution, which sets out the bylaws, regulations, and guidelines for such things as conduct of mess meetings, associate memberships, dress regulations within the mess, or booking of the mess by civilian organizations. The constitution and any amendments are voted upon by the members of the mess.

== Germany ==
The Federal German Armed Forces (&quot;Bundeswehr&quot;) differentiates between three different mess areas.

1. HBG (&quot;Heimbetriebsgesellschaft&quot;) - More commonly called Enlisted Mess (&quot;Mannschaftsheim&quot;): it is common for most bases to have one, where food and drink can be purchased. Newspapers and in some cases equipment and souvenirs such as key chains may also be available. There is generally no strict regulation of conduct, even though access is not limited to enlisted personnel, and NCOs or officers may also be present, ensuring some regulation of conduct. 

2. UHG (&quot;Unteroffizierheim&quot; or &quot;Unteroffizierheimgesellschaft&quot;) (&quot;Gesellschaft&quot; lit. society) - also called UK (NCO Comradeship/&quot;Unteroffizierkameradschaft&quot;) - Non-commissioned Officers&#x27; Mess: this is the area where NCOs can dine or spend their evenings. As opposed to the HBG, the UHG has a constitution, bylaws and a board. Access is usually restricted to NCOs, while officers can gain entry, even though it is usually frowned upon by the NCOs. Some bases have a joint NCOs&#x27; and Officers&#x27; Mess.

3. OHG (Officers&#x27; Mess/&quot;Offizierheimgesellschaft&quot;) - Also called Casino (&quot;Kasino&quot; or &quot;Offizierkasino&quot;). Much like the UHG, the &quot;Kasino&quot; also has a constitution, bylaws and a board. Gentlemanly conduct is mandatory: for instance upon entering the main hall, officers are expected to stand at attention and perform a small bow. Additionally, veterans&#x27; meetings are usually held either in a UHG or in a Kasino. As with the UHG, Kasinos have permanent personnel, as a general rule enlisted men, called &quot;Ordonnanzen&quot;, a military term for waiter or barman. Some Kasinos have grand pianos, and hold recitals, as well as having music played during luncheons or dinners. Official events such as balls and unofficial events such as weddings, informational events and the like, are held here.

The German Navy call their messes &quot;Messen&quot;, with the distinction &quot;Offiziermesse&quot;. The land-based messes are also called &quot;Offiziermessen&quot;.

== India ==
The Indian Army follows a system similar to the British. A typical regiment/unit would have one mess and two clubs, one for the commissioned officers, club for the Junior Commissioned Officers (JCO) and one for the NCOs. Havildars/Daffadars (equivalent to Sergeants) are considered to be NCOs. The Air Force, however has an SNCO (Sr. NCO) mess for Warrant Officers and sergeants, while lower-ranking NCOs would be members of the NCO&#x27;s mess.

In the officer&#x27;s mess and the JCO&#x27;s club, there also is rank of Mess Havildar. A Mess Havildar is a senior NCO who manages and executes the day-to-day activities of the mess/club.

On Republic Day (Jan 26) the JCOs are formally invited for cocktails at the Officers mess. This is reciprocated on Independence Day (Aug 15) by the JCOs at the JCOs Club.

The term mess (short for mess halls) is also used for South Indian restaurants that serve vegetarian meals.

== Israel ==

In the Israeli Navy, although Hebrew speaking, dining rooms on the Missile Ships, Dolphin submarines, and the kitchen in the Patrol Boats are named Messes, Crew Mess and Officers&#x27; Mess. Also, every special meal brought by a crewmember, say celebrating a birthday or a rank promotion, is called Mess.

== United Kingdom ==
On a naval or military establishment there are usually two or three messes:
* The Officers&#x27; Mess, for Commissioned Officers;
* The Chief Petty Officer&#x27;s or Warrant Officers&#x27; and Sergeants&#x27; Mess, for Senior Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs) and Warrant Officers (WOs);
* The Junior Rates&#x27; or Junior Ranks Mess, for Junior NCOs, Rates, Airmen and Privates.

Officers and SNCOs are required under King&#x27;s Regulations to be a member of a mess and unmarried members usually live, eat, and socialise in them. Members of the Officers’ and SNCO mess are also required to pay a subscription fee for supplies and upkeep. The amount is decided upon by the commanding officer within the limits stipulated by the Regulations.

Soldiers, sailors or airmen are welcome in any mess for their rank or equivalent, should they be away from their home unit, as long as they are paying dues in at least one mess. For the Warrant Officers&#x27; and Sergeants&#x27; Mess the highest ranking (normally the regimental sergeant major) member is known as the Presiding Member.

A mess is run by the Mess Committee, a group democratically elected by the members of the mess (except wardrooms), but normally agreed by the commanding officer or regimental sergeant major.
# President Mess Committee (PMC) - (Officers&#x27; Mess) or Chairman of the Mess Committee (Sergeants&#x27;/Petty Officers&#x27; Mess)
# Vice President of the Mess Committee (Mr Vice), who is responsible for toasts during mess dinners. He or she is rarely the deputy of the PMC (normally this is the Secretary) but instead the most junior person in the mess.
# Treasurer
# Secretary (Sec), who is responsible for records and minutes, etc.
# Wines Member, who is responsible for keeping the bar stocked.
# House Member, who is responsible for furniture and infrastructure.
# Entertainments (Ents) Member, for any special events or parties in the mess.

Some messes also have a Senior Living-In Member (SLIM) who represents the living-in members and supervises their conduct.

The commanding officer of the unit has right of veto over the mess, and any changes or events must have his approval. The CO is allowed into any mess (because they are legally all his), but it is often considered an abuse of power, unbecoming conduct or disturbing the order for a CO to drink in a lower rank mess, except when invited on special occasions.

The Officers&#x27; Mess in a Royal Navy ship or base is called the wardroom. Associated with the wardroom is a gunroom, the mess for midshipmen and occasionally junior sub-lieutenants. The captain of a vessel is not normally a member of the wardroom, which is always run by the first lieutenant or executive officer (XO), thereby known as the Mess President (&quot;Mess Prez&quot;). This post is part of the job of being a ship&#x27;s XO. Other committee members are generally appointed (voluntarily or otherwise) by the XO.

Mess dress is the military term for the formal evening dress worn in the mess or at other formal occasions. It is also known as mess kit. Mess dress would be worn at occasions requiring white tie or black tie.

== United States ==

=== U.S. Army ===
In the United States Army, officers historically have had to purchase their own food using funds allocated to each officer. In the far-flung forts of the American Old West, officers would organize their food service in two ways:
* &quot;Closed Mess&quot; was when the few officers of a small fort would pool all of their food funds to provide all meals to members only, thus being &quot;closed&quot; to outsiders except as guests.
* In a larger post, the larger pool of officers could allow the officers to purchase meals on an individual meal basis (after payment of a small monthly dues amount). Such arrangements were called &quot;Open Messes&quot;.

The mess now is called a &quot;dining facility&quot; or &quot;DFAC&quot;. The Officers&#x27; Club (&quot;O Club&quot;) is an outgrowth comparable to the Officers&#x27; Open Mess, but also providing areas to allow officers to entertain guests. A similar version for enlisted personnel is the &quot;E Club&quot;. &quot;Mess&quot; also describes the formal affair of having a &quot;dining in&quot;, held for military members and closed to the public, or a &quot;dining out&quot;, a social event for military personnel and their families.

For much of the 20th century the Army&#x27;s mess food selection was spartan, but after the end of the draft they changed to a food court model with more variety including fast food, while also making fast food franchises available on bases. In 2011, the Army rolled out a program known as &quot;Soldier Athlete&quot; which promotes healthier foods including low-fat milk, whole grains, and veggie wraps.

=== U.S. Navy ===
At most United States Navy shore installations, galleys (previously called Enlisted Dining Facilities in the 1970s and early 1980s) provide messing for sailors (and, if assigned, enlisted marines) ashore and as an option for sailors (and, if assigned, enlisted marines) aboard ships while in port at those installations. Commissioned officers may use these facilities as well.

In addition to galleys ashore, various social clubs with dining facilities may also exist. These are enlisted clubs for sailors in the grade of Petty Officer First Class (E-6) and below; chief petty officer clubs for CPOs (E-7), senior chief petty officers (E-8) and MCPOs (E-9); and officers&#x27; clubs for commissioned officers, although many have been closed, merged into combination enlisted/CPO clubs, or converted into &quot;all hands&quot; enlisted and officer facilities. Such changes began to be imposed following the congressionally-mandated end of Department of Defense budgetary subsidies for all such clubs in the 1990s and the subsequent need for these clubs to be financially self-sufficient. Further impacting the club system ashore for the Navy is the fact that most naval units deploy for extended periods (e.g., six to ten months) on a regular basis with, especially for shipboard personnel, requiring for senior enlisted personnel and commissioned officers to maintain concurrent membership in a ship&#x27;s CPO Mess or officers&#x27; wardroom, respectively.

At sea aboard naval vessels, messing is still separate, with E-6 and below utilizing the ship&#x27;s mess decks, E-7 through E-9 utilizing the ship&#x27;s CPO mess, and commissioned officers being part of the wardroom. Certain large vessels (e.g., aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships) may also include a first class mess for E-6, typically a separate dining area adjacent to the mess decks. This is considered a chance for future CPOs to learn how to be a part of a mess before they enter the CPO mess, often called by the sobriquet of &quot;goat locker.&quot; Enlisted personnel normally receive all meals at what appears to be no cost, but in fact subsidize their meals through forfeiture of their Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS), also called &quot;commuted rations,&quot; although chief petty officers may also have a mess &quot;buy in&quot; or monthly mess bill equivalent to the BAS. For those ships with embarked Marine Corps personnel, staff noncommissioned officers in the grades of E-7, E-8 and E-9 will also be part of the CPO Mess. Commissioned officers retain their BAS, a flat-rate allowance much smaller than the graduated by rank amount paid out to enlisted personnel; however, they must pay for all of their meals while afloat out of pocket. This usually entails a mess &quot;buy in&quot; as a member of the officers&#x27; mess and will typically have either a monthly mess bill or will purchase meals via some sort of debit card.

=== U.S. Air Force ===
Social clubs on United States Air Force installations were at one time called Open Messes, even though most were known in vernacular as Officers Clubs or NCO clubs. Those for officers were able to utilize their initials as colorful acronyms, among the more well-known of which in the 1960s and 1970s were Zaragosa and Zweibrücken (ZOOM), Danang (DOOM), Ramstein (ROOM), and Korat Air Bases or Kirtland Air Force Base (KABOOM), Randolph AFB (Auger Inn) and Nellis AFB (Robin&#x27;s Nest), with the nicknames usually ascribed to those facilities&#x27; casual bars versus the entire club. 

At one time, each squadron had its club, and some flying squadrons continue to maintain a bar in the squadron facilities for officer and enlisted aircrew to this day, but most disappeared after World War II and the various Airmen&#x27;s Clubs, Senior NCO Clubs and Officers&#x27; Clubs became facilities of a base rather than a unit. Most are now officially referred to as officer or enlisted clubs; the term &quot;mess&quot; or &quot;officers&#x27; open mess&quot; having largely disappeared from the Air Force lexicon. Though a few bases (usually major training bases) have separate Airmen&#x27;s Clubs for junior enlisted and NCO Clubs for noncommissioned officers, this is no longer normally the case. Physically separate Officers&#x27; Clubs still exist at some installations; however, smaller Air Force installations may have one consolidated club with separate lounges. Membership is voluntary, though highly encouraged for senior NCOs and officers. Most NCO and Officers Clubs contain a sit-down restaurant in addition to social lounges, meeting/dining rooms, and bars.

Mess halls in the USAF, where unmarried junior enlisted residing in the dormitories are expected to eat, are officially referred to as &quot;dining facilities,&quot; but are colloquially called &quot;chow halls,&quot; although dining facility workers traditionally take offense at the term.

=== U.S. Marine Corps ===
In the United States Marine Corps, enlisted dining facilities ashore are commonly referred to as &#x27;galleys&#x27; or &#x27;chow halls.&#x27; When embarked aboard naval vessels, enlisted Marines and NCOs in the rank of staff sergeant (E-6) and below use the same mess decks as sailors in the grade of petty officer first class (E-6) and below, while staff NCOs in the rank of gunnery sergeant (E-7) and above take meals in the chief petty officers (CPO) mess. Separate enlisted, NCO and officers clubs continue to exist at Marine Corps shore installations, following the Navy model of enlisted, CPO and officers clubs.

Marine Clubs have also been in decline. According to an article by &quot;USA Today&quot;:
:&quot;Alcohol deglamorization in the late &#x27;80s started the decline,&quot; says Carol Garland, head of the Marine Corps&#x27; Food and Hospitality, Personal and Family Readiness Division. &quot;(Congressionally) appropriated funds to support the operation of clubs, including managers, were greatly reduced. Without appropriated funds, clubs had to be self-supporting businesses.&quot;

=== U.S. Coast Guard ===
The United States Coast Guard follows the U.S. Navy model in terms of messing facilities afloat and ashore in terms of the demarcation of galleys for petty officer first class (E-6) and below, chief petty officer messes for chief petty officers (E-7) through master chief petty officers (E-9), and wardrooms for commissioned officers. The only exception is that, given its small size, there are very few Coast Guard clubs aboard Coast Guard shore installations and those that do exist are typically &quot;all hands&quot; facilities.

<doc id="651322" wikidata="Q603696" url="?curid=651322" title="Days of Thunder">
<text>Days of Thunder is a 1990 American sports action drama film produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Tony Scott. The film stars Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Robert Duvall, Randy Quaid, Cary Elwes, Caroline Williams, and Michael Rooker. It also features appearances by real life NASCAR racers, such as Richard Petty, Rusty Wallace, Neil Bonnett, and Harry Gant. Commentator Dr. Jerry Punch, of ESPN, has a cameo appearance, as does co-producer Don Simpson.

&quot;Days of Thunder&quot; was released in the United States on June 27, 1990, by Paramount Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its racing sequences, Hans Zimmer&#x27;s musical score, and the performances of Cruise and Duvall, but criticized its lack of originality compared to Scott&#x27;s previous film &quot;Top Gun&quot;, and grossed $157 million worldwide against a production budget of $60 million. A sequel is in development.

Young USAC racer Cole Trickle is recruited by Chevrolet dealership tycoon Tim Daland to race for his team in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series, bringing former crew chief and car builder Harry Hogge out of retirement to lead Cole&#x27;s pit crew (Harry had left NASCAR a year prior to avoid investigation involving the death of driver Buddy Bretherton). After Cole sets a fast time in a private test at Charlotte Motor Speedway, Harry builds him a new chassis and hires him onto his team.

Cole makes his first start at Phoenix, where he has difficulty adjusting to the larger NASCAR stock cars and communicating with his crew, while being intimidated on the track by Winston Cup Champion and dirty driver Rowdy Burns; these obstacles, combined with numerous crashes and blown engines, prevent Cole from finishing the next three races at Bristol, Dover, and Rockingham. Cole confesses to Harry that he does not understand any common NASCAR terminology, leading Harry to put him through rigorous training. This pays off at Darlington, when Cole uses a slingshot maneuver from the outside line to overtake Rowdy and win his first race.

The rivalry between Cole and Rowdy intensifies throughout the season until the Firecracker 400 at Daytona, where both drivers are seriously injured after being caught in a massive crash. Recovering in Daytona Beach, Cole develops a romantic relationship with Dr. Claire Lewicki, a neurosurgeon at a local hospital. NASCAR President Big John brings Rowdy and Cole together in a meeting and warns them that he and his sport will no longer tolerate any misbehavior from the two rivals. The two bitter rivals soon become close friends after having dinner and settling their differences by smashing rental cars in a race on the beach, per Big John&#x27;s persuasion.

Daland hires another hotshot rookie, Russ Wheeler, to fill Cole&#x27;s seat until Cole returns, and then expands his team, with Daland now fielding two cars – the second car driven by Russ, despite Harry&#x27;s disapproval. Though Cole shows signs of his old self, he falls into a new rivalry with Russ, leading to an engine failure at Atlanta. Daland offers no help to Cole or his crew, as he is defensive of his newest driver. At North Wilkesboro, Russ blocks Cole&#x27;s path during their pit stop, and later forces Cole into the outside wall on the last lap to win the race. Cole retaliates by crashing into Russ&#x27; car after the race, leading to a fight between Harry, Daland, and both of Cole and Russ&#x27;s pit crews, with Daland firing both Cole and Harry in the process.

Rowdy learns he has to undergo brain surgery to fix a broken blood vessel, and asks Cole to drive his car at the Daytona 500 so his sponsor will pay for the year. Cole reluctantly agrees and convinces Harry to return as his crew chief. Hours prior to the race, Harry discovers metal in the oil pan, a sign of engine failure, and manages to procure a new engine from Daland, who still believes in his former driver&#x27;s promise. During the race, Cole&#x27;s car is spun out by Russ and suffers a malfunctioning transmission, but the combined efforts of Harry&#x27;s and Daland&#x27;s pit crews manage to fix the problem and get Cole back on the lead lap. On the final lap, Russ predicts that Cole will attempt his signature slingshot maneuver from outside, but Cole tricks him with a crossover, overtaking him from the inside to win his first Daytona 500.

Cole drives into Victory Lane, where he and his pit crew celebrate with Claire. He approaches Harry, sitting alone, who is impressed by Cole&#x27;s performance. Cole asks Harry to walk with him and Harry agrees, challenging him to a foot race to Victory Lane.

==Cast==
* Tom Cruise as Cole Trickle, a young race car driver out to make a name for himself in NASCAR. He drives the No. 46 City Chevrolet, the SuperFlo Chevrolet and later the No. 51 Mello Yello Chevrolet. The character was patterned after Tim Richmond, while his name is a nod to veteran racer Dick Trickle.

Richard Petty, Rusty Wallace, Neil Bonnett, Harry Gant, and Dr. Jerry Punch all appear in cameo roles as themselves. Bob Jenkins had a voice-over role as a public address announcer, and his ESPN colleagues Benny Parsons and Ned Jarrett portray radio announcers.

In addition, character actress Margo Martindale is seen in her first film role, as Harry&#x27;s timekeeper, while Don Simpson, one of the film&#x27;s producers, has a cameo as driver Aldo Bennedetti, patterned after Mario Andretti and using his twin brother Aldo Andretti&#x27;s first name.

==Production==
Principal photography took place in early 1990 in and around Charlotte and Daytona Beach. It was plagued with delays due to frequent arguments on set between Simpson and Bruckheimer, Scott, and sometimes Towne over how to set up a shot. Crew members sat idle for long hours; some later said they had accumulated enough overtime pay to go on vacation for a full four months after filming was completed. The completion date was pushed back many times, with filming being completed in early May, three months later than it had originally been scheduled. At one point, following the third revision of the shooting schedule in a single day, the unit production manager, who represents the studio on the set or location, confronted Simpson and Bruckheimer and was told bluntly that the schedule no longer mattered.

In Daytona, Simpson and Bruckheimer spent $400,000 to have a vacant storefront in their hotel converted into their private gym, with a large neon sign reading &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;. Simpson also kept a closet full of Donna Karan dresses to offer the attractive women his assistants found on the beach, and held private parties with friends like rapper Tone Lōc. Towne also played a role in the film&#x27;s increasing cost by scrapping more barn scenes when he did not like either of two barns built to his specifications. The film&#x27;s original budget of $35 million nearly doubled; at that level it would have had to make at least $100 million, a rare gross at that time, to break even. In addition, when Tom Cruise lost the Oscar for &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;, some additional budget was cut. Despite the budget overruns and delays, reportedly it was only after shooting was finished that the filmmakers discovered they had neglected to film Cole Trickle&#x27;s car crossing the finish line at Daytona. Nine million dollars of the film&#x27;s budget plus gross percentage went to star Tom Cruise.

With the delay in completion of filming and no delay in release date, post production had to be completed in five weeks rather than the five months it would normally take for such a film.

===Race cars===
The cars used as those of Cole Trickle, Rowdy Burns, and Russ Wheeler were provided by Hendrick Motorsports, with racers Greg Sacks, Tommy Ellis, Bobby Hamilton, and Hut Stricklin as the stand-in drivers. In order to provide authentic race footage involving the cars, these cars were actually raced on three occasions. In late 1989, Hamilton and Sacks raced at Phoenix. Hamilton officially qualified fifth and led a lap before his engine blew. In 1990, the cars were raced again at Daytona and Darlington. Sacks drove a car during the Busch Clash, while Hamilton and Ellis drove unscored entries in the Daytona 500. At Darlington, Stricklin and Sacks drove two of the cars, but both were pulled from the race early after Sacks broke a crankshaft. Cole&#x27;s first car in the film is sponsored by City Chevrolet, a real-life car dealership in Charlotte, North Carolina, owned by Rick Hendrick.

===Music===
The score for &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; was composed by Hans Zimmer, with Jeff Beck featured on guitar. Zimmer had this to say about Jeff Beck &quot;I think he is the most amazing musician I&#x27;ve ever worked with. The whole reason I did &#x27;Days of Thunder&#x27; was a subterfuge to work with Jeff Beck, it was as simple as that. There&#x27;s Jeff Beck and then there&#x27;s everybody else.&quot;. This was the first of an ongoing list of films in which Zimmer would compose the score for a Jerry Bruckheimer production. An official score album was not released until 2013, by La-La Land Records. The film&#x27;s theme song &quot;Last Note of Freedom&quot; was sung by David Coverdale of the band Whitesnake at the request of Tom Cruise himself. Coverdale&#x27;s vocal parts were recorded in 1990 in Los Angeles during a day off of the Whitesnake &quot;Slip of the Tongue&quot; Liquor and Poker world tour. &quot;Show Me Heaven&quot;, written and sung by Maria McKee, reached number one in the music charts of the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway.

==Release==
&quot;Days of Thunder&quot; was released on Wednesday, June 27, 1990 on 2,307 screens in the United States and Canada and grossed $21,502,162 in its first five days. It opened on 170 screens in Japan on June 29 and grossed $2,105,932 for the weekend. The film was a financial success grossing a total of $157,920,733. The film was also successful on home video.

===Home media===
Having been previously released on VHS and then DVD, &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; was released as the fifth film entry in the Paramount Presents series on remastered Blu-ray in May 2020. A 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray was also released the same day. Extra features include a new Isolated Score and a six-minute featurette - Filmmaker Focus: Days of Thunder with Producer Jerry Bruckheimer.

==Reception and legacy==
===Critical response===
The film received mixed reviews from critics who mostly shrugged off the sometimes over-the-top special effects and plot which greatly resembled the earlier Bruckheimer, Simpson, Scott and Cruise vehicle &quot;Top Gun&quot;, which had been hugely successful four years earlier. &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; dismissed &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; as &quot;An over familiar story rendered no more interestingly than usual&quot;, while the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; described it as &quot;simply a flashy, noisy star vehicle for Tom Cruise, one which – like the stock car he drives – goes around in circles getting nowhere&quot;. It holds a rating of 37% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 67 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Days of Thunder&quot; has Tom Cruise and plenty of flash going for it, but they aren&#x27;t enough to compensate for the stock plot, two-dimensional characters, and poorly written dialogue.&quot; Metacritic gave it a score of 60 out of 100 based on 16 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Reassessment===
Following Tony Scott&#x27;s death in 2012, film critic Stephen Metcalf argued that the film marked an important turning point in the history of the American film industry. &quot;The best film he made may well have been &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;,&quot; he wrote in &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;but the most important film he made was &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;.&quot; The excesses of its production and its failure to equal &quot;Top Gun&quot;&#x27;s magnitude of box-office success, he argues, helped end the era that had followed the failure of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; ten years earlier. The studio&#x27;s willingness to indulge director Michael Cimino on that film, as other studios had been doing up to that point, led to a backlash where studios favored producers like Simpson and Bruckheimer whose films bore far more of their imprint than any director who worked for them. &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;, made several years after &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;, was the critical and commercial success it was, Metcalf says, because after similar excesses on the producers&#x27; part like those that occurred on &quot;Thunder&quot; directors were allowed to reassert themselves.

Quentin Tarantino said the film was his favorite big budget racing movie:
Yeah, yeah, you laugh but seriously I&#x27;m a big fan. To me &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; is the movie &quot;Grand Prix&quot; and &quot;Le Mans&quot; should have been. Sure, it had a big budget, big stars and a big director in Tony Scott, but it had the fun of those early AIP movies. I just don&#x27;t think it works if you take the whole thing too seriously.

In 2024, Producer Jerry Bruckheimer also praised the film: “[It] was a terrific film. Tom was great in it.“

==In popular culture==
While the film was neither based on a true story, nor a biographical film, the main character Cole Trickle was very loosely based on the careers of Tim Richmond and Geoff Bodine, and several scenes reenacted or referenced real-life stories and personalities from NASCAR history. The scene where Big John tells Cole and Rowdy they will drive to dinner together is based on an actual meeting Bill France Jr. had in the 1980s between Dale Earnhardt Sr. and Geoff Bodine. Richard Childress and Dale Earnhardt Jr. discussed how &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; was based on the rivalry between Earnhardt Sr. and Bodine. One scene in which Cole deliberately blows his engine by over-revving it reflects upon an incident in which Tim Richmond was said to have done at Michigan in 1987. In another scene, Trickle is told he cannot pit because the crew is too busy eating ice cream. This incident actually occurred at the 1987 Southern 500 involving the Hendrick Motorsports No. 35 team with crew chief Harry Hyde and Richmond&#x27;s replacement driver Benny Parsons. The scene where Cole and Rowdy destroy a pair of rental cars by racing them through the city streets loosely referenced early 1950s NASCAR superstars Joe Weatherly and Curtis Turner, each of whom were known to rent cars, race, and crash them with abandon.

A year after the film&#x27;s release, the fictional Mello Yello sponsorship depicted on Trickle&#x27;s No. 51 car was followed by a real-life sponsorship arrangement. The No. 42 Pontiac of SABCO Racing driven by Kyle Petty carried the paint scheme from 1991 to 1994. Mello Yello also sponsored the fall race at Charlotte from 1990 to 1994. At the 2013 Subway Firecracker 250, driver Kurt Busch had his unsponsored No. 1 Phoenix Racing Chevy painted to resemble Cole Trickle&#x27;s No. 46 City Chevrolet car as part of an awareness campaign for the Armed Forces Foundation.

The Darlington throwback race weekend has also seen drivers race with paint schemes based on those from the film. The 2015 Bojangles&#x27; Southern 500 saw the Mello Yello car on the No. 42 Chevy of Kyle Larson. Rick Ware Racing executed the throwback in 2017 for Cody Ware&#x27;s No. 51, but with a &quot;Pray for Texas&quot; message in support of the survivors of Hurricane Harvey. At the following year&#x27;s race, RWR&#x27;s No. 51 for B. J. McLeod resembled Russ Wheeler&#x27;s No. 18 Hardee&#x27;s car, but with Jacob Companies as the sponsor. In 2019, the City Chevrolet paint scheme returned on the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports car of William Byron. The NASCAR Xfinity Series&#x27; 2019 Darlington race saw the No. 51 of Jeremy Clements use a paint scheme resembling Rowdy Burns&#x27; Exxon car, but with RepairableVehicles.com as the sponsor.

The 1991 &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Saturdays of Thunder&quot; is named after the film.

In 2015, M&amp;M&#x27;s released a promo video on YouTube to commemorate the 25th anniversary of &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; and to promote M&amp;M&#x27;s Crispy. The video features driver Kyle Busch and crew chief Adam Stevens parodying scenes from the film.

==Accolades==
The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound (Charles M. Wilborn, Donald O. Mitchell, Rick Kline and Kevin O&#x27;Connell).

==Video games==

In 1990, Mindscape released a video game adaptation of the film for multiple platforms such as the PC, NES and Amiga. A Game Boy version was released in 1992. The game was available for the PlayStation Network and iOS. Paramount Digital Entertainment released a new video game based on the film for the iOS, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PlayStation Portable. iOS version was released in 2009 and other versions were released in 2011. The game includes 12 NASCAR sanctioned tracks—including Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway—and the film characters Cole Trickle, Rowdy Burns, and Russ Wheeler. The PS3 version, labeled &quot;Days of Thunder: NASCAR Edition&quot; has more than 12 select NASCAR Sprint Cup drivers, including Denny Hamlin, Ryan Newman and Tony Stewart.

==Sequel==
In November 2024, it was reported that Tom Cruise was in final talks to star in and produce a &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; sequel. It is being developed concurrently with an untitled &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot; sequel.

<doc id="651326" wikidata="Q154247" url="?curid=651326" title="Macaronic language">
<text>Macaronic language is any expression using a mixture of languages, particularly bilingual puns or situations in which the languages are otherwise used in the same context (rather than simply discrete segments of a text being in different languages). Hybrid words are effectively &quot;internally macaronic&quot;. In spoken language, code-switching is using more than one language or dialect within the same conversation.

Macaronic Latin in particular is a jumbled jargon made up of vernacular words given Latin endings or of Latin words mixed with the vernacular in a pastiche (compare dog Latin).

The word comes from the Neo-Latin &quot;macaronicus&quot;, which is from the Italian &quot;maccarone&quot;, or &quot;dumpling&quot;, regarded as coarse peasant fare. It is generally derogatory and used when the mixing of languages has a humorous or satirical intent or effect but is sometimes applied to more serious mixed-language literature.

==History==

===Mixed Latin-vernacular lyrics in medieval Europe===
Texts that mixed Latin and vernacular language apparently arose throughout Europe at the end of the Middle Ages—a time when Latin was still the working language of scholars, clerics and university students, but was losing ground to vernacular among poets, minstrels and storytellers.

An early example is from 1130, in the Gospel book of Munsterbilzen Abbey. The following sentence mixes late Old Dutch and Latin:
&lt;poem&gt;
Tesi samanunga was edele unde scona
et omnium virtutum pleniter plena
&lt;/poem&gt;
Translated: &quot;This community was noble and pure, and completely full of all virtues.&quot;

The &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; (collected c.1230) contains several poems mixing Latin with Medieval German or French. Another well-known example is the first stanza of the famous carol &quot;In Dulci Jubilo&quot;, whose original version (written around 1328) had Latin mixed with German, with a hint of Greek. While some of those early works had a clear humorous intent, many use the language mix for lyrical effect.

Another early example is in the Middle English recitals &quot;The Towneley Plays&quot; (c.1460). In &quot;The Talents&quot; (play 24), Pontius Pilate delivers a rhyming speech in mixed English and Latin.

A number of English political poems in the 14th century alternated (Middle) English and Latin lines, such as in MS Digby 196:
&lt;poem&gt;The taxe hath tened [ruined] vs alle,
 Probat hoc mors tot validorum
 The Kyng þerof had small
 fuit in manibus cupidorum.
 yt had ful hard hansell,
 dans causam fine dolorum;
 vengeaunce nedes most fall,
 propter peccata malorum
 &quot;(etc)&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

Several anthems also contain both Latin and English. In the case of &#x27;Nolo mortem peccatoris&#x27; by Thomas Morley, the Latin is used as a refrain:

&lt;poem&gt;
Nolo mortem peccatoris; Haec sunt verba Salvatoris.
Father I am thine only Son, sent down from heav’n mankind to save.
Father, all things fulfilled and done according to thy will, I have.
Father, my will now all is this: Nolo mortem peccatoris.
Father, behold my painful smart, taken for man on ev’ry side;
Ev&#x27;n from my birth to death most tart, no kind of pain I have denied,
but suffered all, and all for this: Nolo mortem peccatoris.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Translated: &quot;&#x27;I do not wish the death of the wicked&#x27;; These are the words of the Saviour.&quot; An allusion to John 3:17 and 2 Peter 3:9.

The Scottish Chaucerian William Dunbar&#x27;s &quot;Lament for the Makaris&quot; uses as a refrain for every four-line stanza the phrase from the Office of the Dead &quot;Timor mortis conturbat me&quot; [&quot;The fear of death disturbs me&quot;].

===Latin–Italian macaronic verse===
The term &quot;macaronic&quot; is believed to have originated in Padua in the late 15th century, apparently from &quot;maccarona&quot;, a kind of pasta or dumpling eaten by peasants at that time. (That is also the presumed origin of &quot;maccheroni&quot;.) Its association with the genre comes from the &quot;Macaronea&quot;, a comical poem by Tifi Odasi in mixed Latin and Italian, published in 1488 or 1489. Another example of the genre is &quot;Tosontea&quot; by Corrado of Padua, which was published at about the same time as Tifi&#x27;s &quot;Macaronea&quot;.

Tifi and his contemporaries clearly intended to satirize the broken Latin used by many doctors, scholars and bureaucrats of their time. While this &quot;macaronic Latin&quot; (&quot;macaronica verba&quot;) could be due to ignorance or carelessness, it could also be the result of its speakers trying to make themselves understood by the vulgar folk without resorting to their speech.

An important and unusual example of mixed-language text is the &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot; of Francesco Colonna (1499), which was basically written using Italian syntax and morphology, but using a made-up vocabulary based on roots from Latin, Greek, and occasionally others. However, while the &quot;Hypnerotomachia&quot; is contemporary with Tifi&#x27;s &quot;Macaronea&quot;, its mixed language is not used for plain humor, but rather as an aesthetic device to underscore the fantastic but refined nature of the book.

Tifi&#x27;s &quot;Macaronea&quot; was a popular success, and the writing of humorous texts in macaronic Latin became a fad in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in Italian, but also in many other European languages. An important Italian example was &quot;Baldo&quot; by Teofilo Folengo, who described his own verses as &quot;a gross, rude, and rustic mixture of flour, cheese, and butter&quot;.

===Other mixed-language lyrics===
Macaronic verse is especially common in cultures with widespread bilingualism or language contact, such as Ireland before the middle of the nineteenth century. Macaronic traditional songs such as &quot;Siúil A Rúin&quot; are quite common in Ireland. In Scotland, macaronic songs have been popular among Highland immigrants to Glasgow, using English and Scottish Gaelic as a device to express the alien nature of the anglophone environment. An example:

Folk and popular music of the Andes frequently alternates between Spanish and the given South American language of its region of origin.

Some Classical Persian poems were written with alternating Persian and Arabic verses or hemistichs, most famously by Saadi and Hafez. Such poems were called &quot;molamma&quot;&#x27; (, literally &quot;speckled&quot;, plural &quot;molamma‘āt&quot; ), Residing in Anatolia, in some of his poems Rumi mixed Persian with Arabic as well as the local languages of Turkish and Greek.

Macaronic verse was also common in medieval India, where the influence of the Muslim rulers led to poems being written in alternating indigenous Hindi and the Persian language. This style was used by poet Amir Khusro and played a major role in the rise of the Urdu or Hindustani language.

===Unintentional macaronic language===
Occasionally language is unintentionally macaronic. One particularly famed piece of schoolyard Greek in France is Xenophon&#x27;s line &quot;they did not take the city; but in fact they had no hope of taking it&quot; (, ). Read in the French manner, this becomes (&#x27;Where is Pauline the maid? At the [railway] station. She&#x27;s pissing and taking a shit.&#x27;)

==Modern macaronic literature==

===Prose===
Macaronic text is still used by modern Italian authors, e.g. by Carlo Emilio Gadda and Beppe Fenoglio. Other examples are provided by the character Salvatore in Umberto Eco&#x27;s &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, and the peasant hero of his &quot;Baudolino&quot;. Dario Fo&#x27;s &quot;Mistero Buffo&quot; (&quot;Comic Mystery Play&quot;) features grammelot sketches using language with macaronic elements.

The 2001 novel &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; by Helen DeWitt includes portions of Japanese, Classical Greek, and Inuktitut, although the reader is not expected to understand the passages that are not in English.

Macaronic games are used by the literary group Oulipo in the form of interlinguistic homophonic transformation: replacing a known phrase with homophones from another language. The archetypal example is by François Le Lionnais, who transformed John Keats&#x27; &quot;A thing of beauty is a joy forever&quot; into &quot;Un singe de beauté est un jouet pour l&#x27;hiver&quot;: &#x27;A monkey of beauty is a toy for the winter&#x27;. Another example is the book &quot;Mots d&#x27;Heures: Gousses, Rames: The d&#x27;Antin Manuscript&quot;.

Macaronisms figure prominently in &quot;The Trilogy&quot; by the Polish novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz, and are one of the major compositional principles for James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.

In Michael Flynn&#x27;s science fiction novels of the Spiral Arm series, a massive interplanetary exodus from all Earth language groups has led to star system settlements derived from random language and culture admixtures. At the time of the novels&#x27; setting, several hundred years later, each planet has developed a macaronic pidgin, several of which are used for all the dialogs in the books.

The Reverend Fergus Butler-Gallie&#x27;s second book bears a cross-lingual pun as its title, &quot;Priests de la Résistance&quot;.

===Poetry===
Two well-known examples of non-humorous macaronic verse are Byron&#x27;s &quot;Maid of Athens, ere we part&quot; (1810, in English with a Greek refrain); and Pearsall&#x27;s translation of the carol &quot;In Dulci Jubilo&quot; (1837, in mixed English and Latin verse).

An example of modern humorous macaronic verse is the anonymous English/Latin poem &quot;Carmen Possum&quot; (&quot;The Opossum&#x27;s Song&quot;), which is sometimes used as a teaching and motivational aid in elementary Latin language classes. Other similar examples are &quot;The Motor Bus&quot; by A. D. Godley, and the anonymous &quot;Up I arose in verno tempore&quot;.

Ezra Pound&#x27;s &quot;The Cantos&quot; makes use of Chinese, Greek, Latin, and Italian, among other languages.

Recent examples are the &quot;mużajki&quot; or &#x27;mosaics&#x27; (2007) of Maltese poet Antoine Cassar mixing English, Spanish, Maltese, Italian, and French; works of Italian writer Guido Monte; and the late poetry of Ivan Blatný combining Czech with English.

Brian P. Cleary&#x27;s &quot;What Can I C&#x27;est?&quot; makes use of macaronic verse, as do other poems in his book &quot;Rainbow Soup: Adventures in Poetry&quot;:

A whole body of comic verse exists created by John O&#x27;Mill, pseudonym of Johan van der Meulen, a teacher of English at the Rijks HBS (State Grammar School), Breda, the Netherlands. These are in a mixture of English and Dutch, often playing on common mistakes made when translating from the latter to the former.

===Theatre===
The finale of act 1 of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s Savoy Opera &quot;Iolanthe&quot; has several instances of humorous macaronic verse.

First, the three lords mix Italian and Latin phrases into their discussion of Iolanthe&#x27;s age:
Lord Mountararat: This gentleman is seen, / With a maid of seventeen, / A-taking of his &quot;dolce far niente&quot;...
Lord Chancellor: Recollect yourself, I pray, / And be careful what you say- / As the ancient Romans said, &quot;festina lente&quot;...
Lord Tolloller: I have often had a use / For a thorough-bred excuse / Of a sudden (which is English for &quot;repente&quot;)...
Lord Mountararat: Now, listen, pray to me, / For this paradox will be / Carried, nobody at all &quot;contradicente&quot;...

Then, the chorus of peers sing macaronic verse as they attempt to resist the fairies&#x27; powers:
Our lordly style you shall not quench with base &quot;canaille&quot;! (That word is French.)
Distinction ebbs before a herd of vulgar &quot;plebs&quot;! (A Latin word.)
Twould fill with joy and madness stark the &quot;oι πoλλoί&quot;! (A Greek remark.)
One Latin word, one Greek remark, and one that&#x27;s French.

===Film===
&quot;Macaronisms&quot; are frequently used in films, especially comedies. In Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s anti-war comedy &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;, the title character speaks English mixed with a parody of German (e.g. &quot;Cheese-und-cracken&quot;). This was also used by Benzino Napaloni, the parody character of Benito Mussolini, using Italian foods (such as salami and ravioli) as insults.

Other movies featuring macaronic language are the Italian historical comedies &quot;L&#x27;armata Brancaleone&quot; and &quot;Brancaleone alle crociate&quot; (d. Mario Monicelli), which mix modern and medieval Italian as well as Latin (sometimes in rhyme, and sometimes with regional connotations, such as the Italo-Normans using words from modern Sicilian).

===Song===

A macaronic song is one that combines multiple languages. Macaronic songs have been particularly common in Ireland (Irish–English) and also occur for other languages, such as Yiddish–Ukrainian.

Macaronic language appearing in popular songs include Rammstein&#x27;s &quot;Amerika&quot; (German and English), the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Michelle&quot;, Talking Heads&#x27; &quot;Psycho Killer&quot; and The Weeknd&#x27;s &quot;Montreal&quot; (French and English), The Clash&#x27;s &quot;Spanish Bombs&quot;, José Feliciano&#x27;s &quot;Feliz Navidad&quot; (Spanish and English), Bandolero&#x27;s &quot;Paris Latino&quot;, Magazine 60&#x27;s &quot;Don Quichotte (No Están Aquí)&quot;, and JJ Lin&#x27;s &quot;只對你說 (Sarang Heyo)&quot; (Mandarin, English, and Korean).

<doc id="651328" wikidata="Q5029896" url="?curid=651328" title="Canadian Computing Competition">
<text>The Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) is an annual programming competition for secondary school students in Canada, organized by the Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing at the University of Waterloo. Stage 1 is written at high schools and can be written in the programming language of the students&#x27; choice, with only a few, such as Maple and
Mathematica, disallowed. There are two levels of problems presented, Junior and Senior. The top 20 (or so) students in the Senior division are invited to the University of Waterloo to participate in Stage 2, the Canadian Computing Olympiad (CCO). CCO participants are restricted to languages permitted at the IOI, which currently includes only Java, C and C++. (Pascal was discontinued in 2019). The CCO is used to select students to represent Canada at the IOI.

The questions in the CCC are algorithmic in nature, designed to test a student&#x27;s ability to design and code algorithms rather than their knowledge of APIs or language-specific features. Stage 2 is more difficult than Stage 1, but still easier than the IOI. The problems generally have memory or time constraints, forcing the programmer to find efficient solutions to earn full marks.

The contests are also open to students from Hong Kong (since 2005) and Beijing (since 2007), although they are not eligible to participate on the Canadian IOI team.

==Contest Stages==
===Canadian Computing Olympiad (CCO)===

The CCO is two days long, with four hours to do three questions each day. There are six questions, each weighted 25 points. Contestants&#x27; combined stage 1 and CCO scores are used to determine final scores for the Canadian Computing Competition. Bronze, silver, and gold medals are awarded, with each competitor receiving a medal; winners of gold medals are invited to represent the Canadian team at the IOI.

<text>The Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne (; &quot;National Museum of Modern Art&quot;) is the national museum for modern art of France. It is located in the 4th arrondissement of Paris and is housed in the Centre Pompidou. In 2021 it ranked 10th in the list of most visited art museums in the world, with 1,501,040 visitors. It is one of the largest museums for modern and contemporary art in the world.

==History==
In 1937, the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne succeeded the Musée du Luxembourg, established in 1818 by King Louis XVIII as the first museum of contemporary art created in Europe, devoted to living artists whose work was due to join the Louvre 10 years after their death. Imagined as early as 1929 by Auguste Perret to replace the old Palais du Trocadero, the construction of a museum of modern art was officially decided in 1934 in the western wing of the Palais de Tokyo. Completed in 1937 for that year&#x27;s International Exhibition of Arts and Technology, it was temporarily used for another purpose, since the exhibition of national and foreign &quot;art indépendant&quot; was then preferably held in the Petit Palais and the Musée du Jeu de Paume. Although due to open in 1939, construction was eventually interrupted by the war; following the nomination of its first Chief Conservator in September 1940, the museum partially opened in 1942 with only a third of the collection brought back from some national collection caches hidden in the province. But its real inauguration didn&#x27;t take place until 1947, after World War II and the addition of the foreign schools collection of the Musée du Luxembourg, which had been held at the Musée du Jeu de Paume since 1922.
In 1947, then housed in the Palais de Tokyo, its collection was dramatically increased by its first director, Jean Cassou, thanks to his special relationship with many prominent artists or their families, such as Picasso and Braque. 

With the creation of the Centre Pompidou, the museum moved to its current location in 1977.

==Description==
The museum has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe, and second largest in the world, after the Museum of Modern Art in New York, with more than 100,000 works of art by 6,400 artists from 90 countries since Fauvism in 1905. These works include painting, sculpture, drawing, print, photography, cinema, new media, architecture, and design. A part of the collection is exhibited every two years alternately in an space divided between two floors, one for modern art (from 1905 to 1960, on the 5th floor), the other for contemporary art (from 1960, on the 4th floor), and 5 exhibition halls, on a total of within the Centre Pompidou. The Atelier Brancusi is located in its own building adjacent to the museum.

The works displayed in the museum often change in order to show to the public the variety and depth of the collection. Many major temporary exhibitions of modern and contemporary art have taken place on a separate floor (the 6th) over the years, among them many one-person exhibitions. Since 2010, the museum has also displayed unique, temporary exhibitions in its provincial branch, the Centre Pompidou-Metz, in a space divided between 3 galleries and since 2015, in Málaga, Spain, and 2018, in Brussels, Belgium.

In 2021, after the French government restituted a looted Max Pechtstein painting to the heirs of Hugo Simon, the Centre Pompidou held an exhibition in a tribute to the persecuted art collector.

<text>&quot;My Old Man&#x27;s a Dustman&quot; is a song first recorded by the British skiffle singer Lonnie Donegan. It reached number one in the British, Irish, Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand singles charts in 1960. The chorus of the song is: 

==Composition==
The song was written by Lonnie Donegan, Peter Buchanan (Donegan&#x27;s manager between 1956 and 1962), and Beverly Thorn; Thorn was not credited on the original release. According to his autobiography, Beverley Thorn was a pseudonym of Leslie Bricusse, the songwriter who wrote hit shows with Anthony Newley.

It probably has its origins in &quot;My Father Was a Fireman&quot;, a song sung by British World War I troops. The two songs share a lyrical similarity in their reference to &quot; trousers&quot;. A song beginning with the line &quot;My old man&#x27;s a dustman&quot;, but otherwise sharing no lyrics with Donegan&#x27;s, is recorded as a playground song in the 1956 novel &quot;My Old Man&#x27;s a Dustman&quot; by Wolf Mankowitz. This song tells of the exploits of the protagonist at the Battle of Mons. A version concerning a football game and beginning &quot;My old man&#x27;s a scaffie [dustman or street-sweeper, from &quot;scavenger&quot;]/He wears a scaffie&#x27;s hat&quot; (echoing the first two lines of Donegan&#x27;s song) is recorded as a Scottish playground song during the 1950s. A very similar song, beginning &quot;My old man&#x27;s a baker&quot;, is recorded in Chester-le-Street in 1967. All of these songs share the same metric structure.

The melody is borrowed from the theme starting at around 2 minutes and 20 seconds into the music for the ballet &quot;Petrushka&quot;, composed by Igor Stravinsky.

The song represented a change in style for Donegan, away from American folk and towards British music hall.

==Single release==
On 16 March 1960, through Pye Records in the UK, Donegan released a version of the song recorded live at the Gaumont cinema in Doncaster just a few weeks earlier, on 20 February. The B-side was a version of the English folk song &quot;The Golden Vanity&quot;. The single reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on 31 March and maintained that position for four weeks. It also reached number one in Ireland, Australia and New Zealand and on the Canadian CHUM Chart, selling over a million copies in total.

==Cover versions==

In 1960, a Dutch version was released by Toby Rix. Also in 1960, a parody version, &quot;My Old Man&#x27;s An All-Black&quot;, was released in New Zealand by the Howard Morrison Quartet in reaction to the New Zealand rugby tour of Apartheid-era South Africa. The song was performed by the Bee Gees on the Australian TV show &quot;Bandstand&quot; in 1963, and, in the US, the Smothers Brothers included a parody based on the song on their LP &quot;Think Ethnic&quot;. In 1966, The Irish Rovers included a version of the song on their LP &quot;The First of the Irish Rovers&quot;.

A version titled &quot;My Old Man&#x27;s a Provo&quot; became one of the most popular Irish republican rebel folk songs in the latter part of the twentieth century.

The tune to the chorus has become a popular football chant in recent years. For example, Arsenal supporters sang &quot;Arsène Wenger&#x27;s magic, he wears a magic hat, and when he saw the double, he said &#x27;I&#x27;m having that!&#x27;&quot; at the end of their double winning season in 2002; Chelsea fans later adopted it after ex-Arsenal player Cesc Fabregas assisted the Blues in securing a double of their own in 2015.

He first rose to prominence for portraying the titular role in &quot;&quot; (1986), and is best known for starring as Merle Dixon in the AMC series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; (2010–2013) and as Yondu Udonta in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; (2014), followed by its sequels &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot; (2017) and &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot; (2023). He is a recurring collaborator of &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; director and co-CEO of DC Studios James Gunn, appearing in all of his films to date including &quot;Slither&quot; (2006), &quot;Super&quot; (2010) and &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot; (2021).

Rooker&#x27;s other notable roles include Chick Gandil in &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; (1988), Frank Bailey in &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; (1988), Terry Cruger in &quot;Sea of Love&quot; (1989), Rowdy Burns in &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; (1990), Bill Broussard in &quot;JFK&quot; (1991), Hal Tucker in &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; (1993), Sherman McMaster in &quot;Tombstone&quot; (1993), Jared Svenning in &quot;Mallrats&quot; (1995), Detective Edward Kennesaw in &quot;Deceiver&quot; (1997), Detective Howard Cheney in &quot;The Bone Collector&quot; (1999), Detective Jake Riley in &quot;Replicant&quot; (2001), and Buddy in &quot;F9&quot; (2021).

==Early life==
Rooker was born in Jasper, Alabama. He has nine brothers and sisters. His parents divorced when he was 13, and he moved with his mother and siblings to Chicago, where he attended Wells Community Academy High School and studied at the Goodman School of Drama at DePaul University.

==Career==

Rooker made his film debut in 1986, playing the title role in &quot;&quot;, based on the confessions of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas. He was acting in a play when the play&#x27;s director, who was going to do the prosthetics for &quot;Henry&quot;, told him about the role. Rooker did not care if the script was good or bad; he just wanted to act in a film as it would &quot;challenge&quot; him. &quot;Henry&quot; was a critical success and Rooker received more film roles.

He was given more dramatic roles in films such as &quot;Eight Men Out&quot;, &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot;, and &quot;JFK&quot;, but he became widely known for his roles in action and thriller films such as &quot;Sea of Love&quot;, &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;, &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, and &quot;Tombstone&quot;. He also starred in &quot;Mallrats&quot;, &quot;Rosewood&quot;, &quot;The 6th Day&quot;, &quot;Slither&quot;, &quot;Jumper&quot;, &quot;Super&quot; and &quot;Hypothermia&quot;.

In June 2010, Rooker revealed via Twitter that he was to appear in the AMC television series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; as Merle Dixon, one of the survivors of a zombie apocalypse. He guest-starred in two episodes of the first season and one of the second season before becoming a series regular for the third season.

Rooker is also known for his roles in video games such as &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot; (where he played himself), Mike Harper in &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops 2&quot; in November 2012, and as Merle in &quot;The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct&quot;, the video game based on the television series.

He played Yondu Udonta in the Marvel Studios film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, directed by James Gunn, and reprised the role in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot; (2017) as well as &quot;The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special&quot; (2022). In 2021 he appeared in the action film &quot;F9&quot;, directed by Justin Lin.

==Personal life==
Rooker lives in California with his wife Margot. They married in 1979 and have two daughters. He practices the Kyokushin style of karate.

<text>Riverside City College (RCC) is a public community college in Riverside, California. The college is part of the Riverside Community College District, as well as the larger California Community Colleges System.

==History==
RCC first opened in 1916 at the same site as the Riverside Polytechnic High School (Riverside Poly). Originally known as Riverside Junior College and later as Riverside City College, the school changed its name to Riverside Community College in the mid-1980s. In 2008, the board of trustees renamed the institution back to &quot;Riverside City College&quot;.
The junior college expanded from the Riverside Poly campus and in 1924 constructed the first two buildings of the campus quadrangle in 1924. When Riverside Poly re-located to its own campus on Victoria Avenue in 1965 the college assumed total control of the Magnolia property.

Today, Riverside City College is part of the greater Riverside Community College District which enrolls about 21,000 students each semester. Students may earn an associate degree, transfer to a four-year college or university, or earn a career certificate.

In addition to the campus located in downtown Riverside, there are campuses in Moreno Valley and Norco. Separate education centers include the Riverside County Sheriff&#x27;s Department Ben Clark Public Safety Training Center, the Center for Teaching Excellence at Stokoe, and the Rubidoux Annex in Rubidoux. RCC is also home to Gateway to College, a charter school that serves those returning to high school seeking diplomas as adults.

RCC maintains programs in liberal arts and science, athletics, and performing arts and vocational education. The school band is the RCC Marching Tigers, which includes the Fantasia Winter Guard, which has won several Winter Guard International awards, a Fall Marching Band, a Winter Drum Line, and a Spring Pep Band. The student newspaper is &quot;Viewpoints&quot;. The college is home to the School for Nursing.

In 2016, RCC opened the Henry W. Coil Sr. and Alice Edna Coil School for the Arts on University Avenue and Market Street, adjacent to the historic White Park. The school is the home of the college&#x27;s music program, including the internationally renowned RCC Chamber Singers, and the RCC Jazz Ensemble. The school combining classrooms, studios, and digital media labs, built around a state of the art concert hall designed with adjustable acoustics. The new school serves around 1,000 students preparing for careers in vocal or instrumental performance, music education, and careers in the music industry.

The college&#x27;s marching band performed at the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California on January 1, 2010, and at Bandfest at Pasadena City College.

==Athletics==
The Riverside City College Tigers compete in the Orange Empire Conference (OEC) and Southern California Football Association, which operates within the California Community College Athletic Association. The college currently fields nine men&#x27;s teams and nine women&#x27;s teams.

<doc id="651351" wikidata="Q6221573" url="?curid=651351" title="John Bennett Ramsey">
<text>John Bennett Ramsey (born December 7, 1943) is an American businessman, author, and father of JonBenét Ramsey, the victim of an unsolved homicide.

==Early life and education ==
Ramsey was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, the son of Mary Jane (née Bennett) (1919–1978) and James Dudley &quot;Jay&quot; Ramsey (1916–1992), a decorated World War II pilot. He attended Okemos High School in Michigan. In 1966, he graduated from Michigan State University (MSU) with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering. Ramsey earned a master&#x27;s degree in business administration from MSU in 1971.

Ramsey joined the Navy in 1966, served as a Civil Engineer Corps officer in the Philippines for three years, and in an Atlanta reserve unit for an additional eight years.

==Career==
In 1989, Ramsey formed the Advanced Product Group, one of three companies that merged to become Access Graphics. He became president and chief executive officer of Access Graphics, a computer services company that became a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin in 1991.

In 1996, Access Graphics grossed over $1 billion, and Ramsey was named &quot;Entrepreneur of the Year&quot; by the Boulder Chamber of Commerce. Immediately following the murder of his daughter he was &quot;temporarily replaced so the company did not have to bother him about business matters as he grieved&quot;, according to Lockheed Martin spokesman Evan McCollum, but Ramsey returned to his job within weeks.

Ramsey, along with his wife Patsy and young son Burke, moved back to Atlanta shortly thereafter. Access Graphics was later sold to General Electric in 1997.

In 2015, Ramsey told Barbara Walters in an interview that the death of JonBenét and the ensuing investigation and cost of the case had drained his finances, and that the notoriety of the case made it difficult for him to find work.

==Case file for JonBenét murder==

The murder of Ramsey&#x27;s six-year-old daughter, JonBenét, was the only murder in Boulder, Colorado, in 1996.

The Boulder police considered various scenarios regarding who had committed the murder, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine naming eight possible suspects including John.

Linda Arndt, the detective first assigned to the case, stated in a deposition that she believed John Ramsey was responsible for the murder.

==Grand jury indictment==
In 1999, a grand jury voted to indict the parents of murdered 6-year-old beauty pageant winner JonBenét Ramsey on charges of child abuse resulting in death and of being accessories to a crime. The indictment alleges that between Christmas Day and Dec. 26, 1996, John and Patsy Ramsey “unlawfully, knowingly, recklessly and feloniously permit a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the child’s life or health,” which resulted in her death.

===District Attorney is split===
On July 9, 2008, the Boulder County District Attorney&#x27;s office announced that, as a result of newly developed DNA sampling and testing techniques known as Touch DNA analysis, the Ramsey family members were no longer considered suspects in the case. In light of the new DNA evidence, Boulder County District Attorney Mary Lacy gave a letter to John Ramsey that same day; however, Stan Garnett, the current Boulder County DA, regarding Lacy&#x27;s exoneration letter, said, &quot;This letter is not legally binding. It&#x27;s a good-faith opinion and has no legal importance.&quot;

==Defamation lawsuits==
Several defamation lawsuits have ensued since JonBenét&#x27;s murder. L. Lin Wood was the attorney for the Ramsey family, filing defamation claims on their behalf against St. Martin&#x27;s Press, Time, Inc., The Fox News Channel, American Media, Inc., &quot;Star&quot;, &quot;The Globe&quot;, Court TV, and &quot;The New York Post&quot;.

John and Patsy Ramsey were sued in two separate defamation lawsuits arising from the publication of their book, &quot;The Death of Innocence&quot;. These suits were brought by two persons named in the book as having been investigated by Boulder police as suspects in JonBenét&#x27;s murder. The Ramseys were defended in those lawsuits by Lin Wood and three other Atlanta attorneys, James C. Rawls, Eric P. Schroeder, and S. Derek Bauer, who obtained dismissal of both lawsuits, including an in-depth decision by U.S. District Court Judge Julie Carnes that &quot;abundant evidence&quot; pointed to an intruder having committed the murder.

==Political campaign==
In 2004, Ramsey campaigned for a seat in Michigan&#x27;s House of Representatives for the 105th district. He received 24.3 percent of the vote in the Republican Party primary, finishing in second place to Kevin Elsenheimer.

==Personal life==
Ramsey married Lucinda Pasch in 1966. They had three children. The couple divorced in 1978. His eldest daughter, Elizabeth, was killed in a car crash at age 22 in 1992.

Ramsey married his second wife, Patsy Ramsey, in 1980, with whom he had two children, Burke and JonBenét. Patsy died of ovarian cancer in 2006 at age 49.

After his wife&#x27;s death, Ramsey met Beth Holloway, mother of missing Natalee Holloway. It was reported that the two began dating. However, Ramsey played down their relationship, stating that they &quot;developed a friendship of respect and admiration&quot; out of common interests related to their children.

Ramsey relocated to Moab, Utah, and met his third wife, Jan Rousseaux, in 2011. They later married and relocated to Michigan.

==In popular culture==
*Ramsey has been portrayed by Ronny Cox in the miniseries &quot;Perfect Murder, Perfect Town&quot; (2000); by Cliff DeYoung in the TV movie &quot;Getting Away with Murder: The JonBenet Ramsey Story&quot; (2000); by Michel Gill in Lifetimes &quot;Who Killed Jonbenet&quot; (2016) and Clive Owen in an upcoming untitled Paramount+ limited series.
*The Ramseys were also portrayed in the 2001 &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Butters&#x27; Very Own Episode&quot;. In a 2011 interview, &quot;South Park&quot; creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone stated that they regretted how the Ramseys were portrayed in the episode.
*The Ramseys were also portrayed in two &quot;MADtv&quot; sketches, one parodying &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, with John portrayed by Michael McDonald and Patsy by Alex Borstein.
*Ramsey appears in the documentary series &quot;Cold Case: Who Killed JonBenét Ramsey&quot; directed by Joe Berlinger for Netflix.

<text>Credibility comprises the objective and subjective components of the believability of a source or message. Credibility is deemed essential in many fields to establish expertise. It plays a crucial role in journalism, teaching, science, medicine, business leadership, and social media. 

Credibility online has become an important topic since the mid-1990s. This is because the web has increasingly become an information resource. The Credibility and Digital Media Project @ UCSB highlights recent and ongoing work in this area, including recent consideration of digital media, youth, and credibility. In addition, the Persuasive Technology Lab at Stanford University has studied web credibility and proposed the principal components of online credibility and a general theory called Prominence-Interpretation Theory.

Credibility dates back to Aristotle&#x27;s theory of Rhetoric. Aristotle defines rhetoric as the ability to see what is possibly persuasive in every situation. He divided the means of persuasion into three categories, namely Ethos (the source&#x27;s credibility), Pathos (the emotional or motivational appeals), and Logos (the logic used to support a claim), which he believed have the capacity to influence the receiver of a message. According to Aristotle, the term &quot;Ethos&quot; deals with the character of the speaker. The intent of the speaker is to appear credible. In fact, the speaker&#x27;s ethos is a rhetorical strategy employed by an orator whose purpose is to &quot;inspire trust in his audience&quot;.

Credibility has two key components: trustworthiness and expertise, which both have objective and subjective components. Trustworthiness is based more on subjective factors, but can include objective measurements such as established reliability. Expertise can be similarly subjectively perceived, but also includes relatively objective characteristics of the source or message (e.g., credentials, certification or information quality). Secondary components of credibility include source dynamism (charisma) and physical attractiveness.

==In journalism==

According to the Society of Professional Journalists&#x27; code of ethics, professional integrity is the cornerstone of a journalist&#x27;s credibility.
A journalist&#x27;s number one obligation is to be honest.

According to Gallup polls, Americans&#x27; confidence in the mass media has been consistently declining each year since 2007.

In 2013, a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press found that credibility ratings for major news organizations are at or near their all-time lows.

&quot;As audiences lose confidence in traditional news outlets, many see great promise in the Internet as a response to this crisis in journalism.&quot;

The widespread use of the internet has helped motivate journalists to become more credible. The reason for this is because the competition of providing news increased when consumers had the chance and ability to choose the media consume through online sources. The internet has provided a chance for anyone to report news. In order to increase credibility, and therefore increase readers of their articles, journalists should be objective, accurate, trustworthy, and reliable.

Three aspects of credibility: clarity (how easily the article can be understood), accuracy (how well documented the information is), and trustworthiness (how believable the information is).

==In teaching==
Students&#x27; perception of instructors has great importance and possible consequences. Instructor credibility, which is defined as &quot;the attitude of a receiver which references the degree to which a source is seen to be believable&quot;, consists of three dimensions-, competence, character, and caring. Competence focuses on his or her expertise or knowledge in a subject matter. Character refers to the &quot;goodness&quot; (i.e., honesty, trustworthiness) of an instructor. Caring focuses on whether the instructor shows concern or empathy for the students&#x27; welfare or situation. Although an instructor may show one or two of these qualities, the best and most respected exude all three qualities. A study done by Atkinson and Cooper revealed that students who are taught by an instructor perceive as credible, results in extreme allegiance to those instructors.

Generally, instructors who are perceived to have credibility are associated with effective teaching skills. Instructors who demonstrate competence, character, and/or caring are perceived to engage in a variety of effective instructional communication behaviors such as argumentativeness, verbal and nonverbal immediacy, affinity seeking, and assertiveness and responsiveness. Moreover, credible instructors are perceived to be low in verbal aggressiveness and less likely to use behaviors that interfere with student learning.

Unlike instructor competence which centers on instructors&#x27; perceived expertise, instructor character and caring are rooted in students&#x27; perceptions of their instructors&#x27; interpersonal communication behaviors. Students can feel more connected to the material being taught and have the information stay in their mind, if the instructor sharing the information has credibility. According to studies, when instructors exemplify the qualities of character (i.e., kind, virtuous, good) and caring (i.e., empathetic, understanding, responsive), students report a greater likelihood of communicating with them.

Teachers who are concerned with whether students communicate with them, either in class or out of class, may want to reconsider the role their own in-class communication behaviors play in students&#x27; willingness or likelihood to communicate with them. Instructors who are interested in how students perceive their competence, character, and caring should examine how their in-class communication behaviors contribute to these perceptions. They can evaluate themselves, go back over their lectures, scores that students give them at the end of the semester, and seek advice and training from their peers. By doing so, instructors may find students are more willing, likely, or interested in communicating with them. 
==In science==

&quot;Scientific credibility&quot; has been defined as the extent to which science in general is recognized as a source of reliable information about the world. The term has also been applied more narrowly, as an assessment of the credibility of the work of an individual scientist or a field of research. Here, the phrase refers to how closely the work in question adheres to scientific principles, such as the scientific method. The method most commonly used to assess the quality of science is peer review and then publication as part of the scientific literature. Other approaches include the collaborative assessment of a topic by a group of experts, this process can produce reviews such as those published by the Cochrane Collaboration, or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

The 2008 credibility article written by Peter Alagona highlights that, “In environmental science, credibility is one of the most referenced yet the least comprehended concepts.” This lack of understanding is due to the public often confusing credibility with trust because of shared characteristics, such as reliability and dependability. To be credible in the scientific field, researchers are to demonstrate expertise, reliability and objectivity, through methods such as peer and systematic review, and experimental studies. Alagona states that “the credibility of scientific research shapes the public’s trust and influence policies.” Therefore, scientific credibility means that when research is seen as trustworthy, it can shape various rules and regulations. This reinforces the public’s trust, belief, and acceptance, as these guidelines are based on credible scientific findings.

The general public can give a great deal of weight to perceptions of scientific authority in their decisions on controversial issues that involve scientific research, such as biotechnology. However, both the credibility and authority of science is questioned by groups with non-mainstream views, such as some advocates of alternative medicine, or those who dispute the scientific consensus on a topic, such as denialists of AIDS. Political endorsements can reduce non-partisan scientific credibility.

== In medicine ==
People rely on doctors&#x27; expertise to respond to issues relating to their health. Trust in a doctor&#x27;s credibility is essential to a patient&#x27;s health: depending on the patient&#x27;s trust in the doctor they will be more or less willing to seek help, reveal sensitive information, submit to treatment, and follow the doctor&#x27;s recommendations. 

In general, it is easy to see what patients are looking for when it comes to a trustworthy doctor and the best way they can have their needs satisfied. There does seem to be a growing discontent with the medical field, however, because of for-profit drug companies that are influencing money behind the medical field. In 2002 a doctor attended the hearings of a drug company that was on trial for the death of adolescents who committed suicide while taking their antidepressants. Before the hearing studies had been filed with the FDA under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2002. These studies reflected a congressional effort to motivate drug companies to study the effects of medications on children. Since children are a much smaller market for new drugs, the pharmaceutical industry was suspected to not study them as much. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2002 was meant to strengthen drug companies&#x27; credibility by rewarding those that performed pediatric studies. The law, however, did not require these pediatric studies performed to be publicized or published

According to a &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; study, 94% of American doctors have some relationship with a drug or medical device company, including payments but also drug samples and industry lunches, for example. Such alarming evidence is what has prompted a growing mistrust in medical professionals&#x27; credibility. Despite the studies conducted intended on finding out how to increase doctors&#x27; credibility, the findings are inconclusive. It is a strong general consensus that increased visibility of the relationship between doctors and pharmaceutical companies is the first place to start.

The Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication investigated a study that “perceived credibility of online information” to grasp an understanding about how knowledge of a topic and a source expertise establish credibility to access online healthcare data. The results of this study divide expertise into three levels. Utilizing online health information that is free of bias and includes the qualifications and background of the author or organization would be considered credible. Additionally, having high numbers of citation and peer-reviewed sources support credibility. These factors together would be level 1, which is a highly rated source. Missing a high number of citations and peer-reviewed sources results in a level 2 grade, which is considered a moderate source. Failure to meet any criteria of these would classify the source as a level 3, which is not an expert source and should be avoided. To assess these levels, one can check if a source meets the mentioned requirements, as it is the public’s decision. Furthermore, using academic resources such as google scholar and JSTOR can be used verify the credibility of an online source. 

==On the street==
Street credibility or &quot;street cred&quot; (also referred to as &quot;the word on the street&quot;) is the degree to which someone&#x27;s word can be believed by a typical person, the &quot;person on the street&quot;. Corporations have gone through their own ways of getting street credibility; however, it goes by a different name: branding. This is a process in which companies spend billions of dollars a year to convey information about a product, who is using it, and why others should also. They are targeting certain individuals as to increase their ability to grow their &quot;street cred&quot; so that the sales growth does not end. From clothing like running shoes and jeans to food and alcoholic beverages, branding is used to assist companies improve their street cred and better sell a product.

The CEO of the company is the face of what the public sees. A CEO helps illustrate the organization&#x27;s internal and external shareholders. CEOs are spokesmen who are actively visible and shape the corporate image. The role of the CEO is to influence employees&#x27; attitudes, perceptions, and performances through example of leadership and support.

==In business leadership==

According to the Journal of Research Technology Management, Chief Technical Officers (CTOs), executives responsible for technologies and Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) play a major role in ensuring credibility in leadership for research and development across many companies. Uttal and the rest of the team discovered that CTO could use multiple resources to evaluate the desire for credibility and set goals for addressing the issue. The credibility of a CTO is built by acting as a “technical businessman” to make strategic decisions that advance technologies to reach the company goals. The CEO actively build credibility by consistently supporting the team, expanding the company, and establishing trust within the employees. People often assume that only the CEO has to be credible, when in fact both the CEO and CTO must establish credibility to succeed. 

The employees view of the organization completely intervenes the positive relationship between the CEO credibility and the employee&#x27;s involvement of engagement. Although the CEO&#x27;s credibility positively affects employee engagement, the actual impact is exercised by the employee&#x27;s view of the organization&#x27;s reputation.

== In social media ==
Social media credibility is dependent on cues and heuristics. Cues used to assess credibility online are authority cues, identity cues, and bandwagon cues. Authority cues are the most influence source credibility. Authority cues are cues that let the viewer know that it is an expert source such as a university or government institution. Identity cues are peer information. Users trust information more if they can identify the person that published it the publisher is not anonymous. Users view information as more credible if a peer shared it than a stranger. 
Bandwagon cues triggers credibility processing based on the logic that &quot;if others think it&#x27;s good, so should I. 
== Two-phase model of credibility ==
Jürgen Habermas in his theory of &quot;communicative action&quot; developed four validity claims (&quot;truth&quot;, &quot;sincerity&quot;, &quot;appropriateness&quot; and &quot;understandability&quot;) leading to the concept of &quot;credibility&quot;.

In a different study researchers empirically validated the claims and derived a two-phase model of &quot;reporting credibility&quot;, where first of all &quot;understandability&quot; needs to be reached. Only then the three other validity claims make a difference and may lead to credibility in the Habermasian sense.

<text>Photoemission spectroscopy (PES), also known as photoelectron spectroscopy, refers to energy measurement of electrons emitted from solids, gases or liquids by the photoelectric effect, in order to determine the binding energies of electrons in the substance. The term refers to various techniques, depending on whether the ionization energy is provided by X-ray, XUV or UV photons. Regardless of the incident photon beam, however, all photoelectron spectroscopy revolves around the general theme of surface analysis by measuring the ejected electrons.

==Types==
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was developed by Kai Siegbahn starting in 1957 and is used to study the energy levels of atomic core electrons, primarily in solids. Siegbahn referred to the technique as &quot;electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis&quot; (ESCA), since the core levels have small chemical shifts depending on the chemical environment of the atom that is ionized, allowing chemical structure to be determined. Siegbahn was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1981 for this work. XPS is sometimes referred to as PESIS (photoelectron spectroscopy for inner shells), whereas the lower-energy radiation of UV light is referred to as PESOS (outer shells) because it cannot excite core electrons.

Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) is used to study valence energy levels and chemical bonding, especially the bonding character of molecular orbitals. The method was developed originally for gas-phase molecules in 1961 by Feodor I. Vilesov and in 1962 by David W. Turner, and other early workers included David C. Frost, J. H. D. Eland and K. Kimura. Later, Richard Smalley modified the technique and used a UV laser to excite the sample, in order to measure the binding energy of electrons in gaseous molecular clusters.

Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has become the most prevalent electron spectroscopy in condensed matter physics after recent advances in energy and momentum resolution, and widespread availability of synchrotron light sources. The technique is used to map the band structure of crystalline solids, to study quasiparticle dynamics in highly correlated materials, and to measure electron spin polarization.

Two-photon photoelectron spectroscopy (2PPE) extends the technique to optically excited electronic states through the introduction of a pump-and-probe scheme.

Extreme-ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (EUPS) lies in between XPS and UPS. It is typically used to assess the valence band structure. Compared to XPS, it gives better energy resolution, and compared to UPS, the ejected electrons are faster, resulting in less space charge and mitigated final state effects.

==Physical principle==
The physics behind the PES technique is an application of the photoelectric effect. The sample is exposed to a beam of UV or XUV light inducing photoelectric ionization. The energies of the emitted photoelectrons are characteristic of their original electronic states, and depend also on vibrational state and rotational level. For solids, photoelectrons can escape only from a depth on the order of nanometers, so that it is the surface layer which is analyzed.

Because of the high frequency of the light, and the substantial charge and energy of emitted electrons, photoemission is one of the most sensitive and accurate techniques for measuring the energies and shapes of electronic states and molecular and atomic orbitals. Photoemission is also among the most sensitive methods of detecting substances in trace concentrations, provided the sample is compatible with ultra-high vacuum and the analyte can be distinguished from background.

Typical PES (UPS) instruments use helium gas sources of UV light, with photon energy up to 52 eV (corresponding to wavelength 23.7 nm). The photoelectrons that actually escaped into the vacuum are collected, slightly retarded, energy resolved, and counted. This results in a spectrum of electron intensity as a function of the measured kinetic energy. Because binding energy values are more readily applied and understood, the kinetic energy values, which are source dependent, are converted into binding energy values, which are source independent. This is achieved by applying Einstein&#x27;s relation formula_1. The formula_2 term of this equation is the energy of the UV light quanta that are used for photoexcitation. Photoemission spectra are also measured using tunable synchrotron radiation sources.

The binding energies of the measured electrons are characteristic of the chemical structure and molecular bonding of the material. By adding a source monochromator and increasing the energy resolution of the electron analyzer, peaks appear with full width at half maximum (FWHM) less than 5–8 meV.

<doc id="651361" wikidata="Q40139" url="?curid=651361" title="Curvature of Riemannian manifolds">
<text>In mathematics, specifically differential geometry, the infinitesimal geometry of Riemannian manifolds with dimension greater than 2 is too complicated to be described by a single number at a given point. Riemann introduced an abstract and rigorous way to define curvature for these manifolds, now known as the &quot;Riemann curvature tensor&quot;. Similar notions have found applications everywhere in differential geometry of surfaces and other objects.
The curvature of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold can be expressed in the same way with only slight modifications.

== Ways to express the curvature of a Riemannian manifold ==

=== Riemann curvature tensor ===

The curvature of a Riemannian manifold can be described in various ways; the most standard one is the curvature tensor, given in terms of a Levi-Civita connection (or covariant differentiation) and Lie bracket by the following formula:
formula_1

Here is a linear transformation of the tangent space of the manifold; it is linear in each argument.
If and are coordinate vector fields then and therefore the formula simplifies to
formula_2
i.e. the curvature tensor measures &quot;noncommutativity of the covariant derivative&quot;.

The linear transformation is also called the curvature transformation or endomorphism.

&quot;N.B.&quot; There are a few books where the curvature tensor is defined with opposite sign.

==== Symmetries and identities ====

The curvature tensor has the following symmetries:
formula_3
formula_4
formula_5

The last identity was discovered by Ricci, but is often called the &quot;first Bianchi identity&quot;, just because it looks similar to the Bianchi identity below. The first two should be addressed as &quot;antisymmetry&quot; and &quot;Lie algebra property&quot; respectively, since the second means that the for all are elements of the pseudo-orthogonal Lie algebra. All three together should be named &quot;pseudo-orthogonal curvature structure&quot;. They give rise to a &quot;tensor&quot; only by identifications with objects of the tensor algebra – but likewise there are identifications with concepts in the Clifford-algebra. Let us note that these three axioms of a curvature structure give rise to a well-developed structure theory, formulated in terms of projectors (a Weyl projector, giving rise to &quot;Weyl curvature&quot; and an Einstein projector, needed for the setup of the Einsteinian gravitational equations). This structure theory is compatible with the action of the pseudo-orthogonal groups plus dilations. It has strong ties with the theory of Lie groups and algebras, Lie triples and Jordan algebras. See the references given in the discussion.

The three identities form a complete list of symmetries of the curvature tensor, i.e. given any tensor that satisfies the identities above, one could find a Riemannian manifold with such a curvature tensor at some point. Simple calculations show that such a tensor has independent components.
Yet another useful identity follows from these three:
formula_6

The Bianchi identity (often the second Bianchi identity)
involves the covariant derivatives:
formula_7

=== Sectional curvature ===

Sectional curvature is a further, equivalent but more geometrical, description of the curvature of Riemannian manifolds. It is a function that depends on a section (i.e. a 2-plane in the tangent spaces). It is the Gauss curvature of the -&quot;section&quot; at ; here -section is a locally defined piece of surface that has the plane as a tangent plane at , obtained from geodesics that start at in the directions of the image of under the exponential map at .

If are two linearly independent vectors in then
formula_8

The following formula indicates that sectional curvature describes the curvature tensor completely:
formula_9
formula_10
formula_11
Or in a simpler formula:
formula_12

=== Curvature form ===

The connection form gives an alternative way to describe curvature. It is used more for general vector bundles, and for principal bundles, but it works just as well for the tangent bundle with the Levi-Civita connection. The curvature of an -dimensional Riemannian manifold is given by an antisymmetric matrix of 2-forms (or equivalently a 2-form with values in , the Lie algebra of the orthogonal group , which is the structure group of the tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold).

Let be a local section of orthonormal bases. Then one can define the connection form, an antisymmetric matrix of 1-forms that satisfy from the following identity
formula_13

Then the curvature form is defined by
formula_14

Note that the expression &quot;&quot; is shorthand for and hence does not necessarily vanish. The following describes relation between curvature form and curvature tensor:
formula_15

This approach builds in all symmetries of curvature tensor except the &quot;first Bianchi identity&quot;, which takes form
formula_16
where is an -vector of 1-forms defined by .
The &quot;second Bianchi identity&quot; takes form
formula_17
where denotes the exterior covariant derivative.

=== Curvature operator ===

It is sometimes convenient to think about curvature as an operator 
on tangent bivectors (elements of ), which is uniquely defined by the following identity:
formula_18
It is possible to do this precisely because of the symmetries of the curvature tensor (namely antisymmetry in the first and last pairs of indices, and block-symmetry of those pairs).

== Further curvature tensors ==

In general the following tensors and functions do not describe the curvature tensor completely; however they play an important role.

=== Scalar curvature ===

Scalar curvature is a function on any Riemannian manifold, denoted variously by or . 
It is the full trace of the curvature tensor; given an orthonormal basis formula_19 in the tangent space at a point we have
formula_20
where denotes the Ricci tensor. The result does not depend on the choice of orthonormal basis. Starting with dimension 3, scalar curvature does not describe the curvature tensor completely.

=== Ricci curvature ===

Ricci curvature is a linear operator on tangent space at a point, usually denoted by . 
Given an orthonormal basis formula_19 in the tangent space at we have
formula_22

The result does not depend on the choice of orthonormal basis. 
With four or more dimensions, Ricci curvature does not describe the curvature tensor completely.

Explicit expressions for the Ricci tensor in terms of the Levi-Civita connection is given in the article on Christoffel symbols.

=== Weyl curvature tensor ===

The Weyl curvature tensor has the same symmetries as the Riemann curvature tensor, but with one extra constraint: its trace (as used to define the Ricci curvature) must vanish.

The Weyl tensor is invariant with respect to a conformal change of metric: if two metrics are related as for some positive scalar function , then .

In dimensions 2 and 3 the Weyl tensor vanishes, but in 4 or more dimensions the Weyl tensor can be non-zero. For a manifold of constant curvature, the Weyl tensor is zero. Moreover, if and only if the metric is locally conformal to the Euclidean metric.

=== Ricci decomposition ===

Although individually, the Weyl tensor and Ricci tensor do not in general determine the full curvature tensor, the Riemann curvature tensor can be decomposed into a Weyl part and a Ricci part. This decomposition is known as the Ricci decomposition, and plays an important role in the conformal geometry of Riemannian manifolds. In particular, it can be used to show that if the metric is rescaled by a conformal factor of , then the Riemann curvature tensor changes to (seen as a (0, 4)-tensor):
formula_23
where formula_24denotes the Kulkarni–Nomizu product and Hess is the Hessian.

<doc id="651370" wikidata="Q224513" url="?curid=651370" title="Precocious puberty">
<text>In medicine, precocious puberty is puberty occurring at an unusually early age. In most cases, the process is normal in every aspect except the unusually early age and simply represents a variation of normal development. There is early development of secondary sex characters and gametogenesis also starts earlier. Precocious puberty is of two types: true precocious puberty and pseudoprecocious puberty. In a minority of children with precocious puberty, the early development is triggered by a disease such as a tumor or injury of the brain.

Even when there is no underlying disease, unusually early puberty can have adverse effects on social behavior and psychological development (having more mature knowledge than one&#x27;s peers, feeling inadequate, trying to attend and establish friendships with older people, depression). Affected children also face shorter adult height potential and possible lifelong health risks. Central precocious puberty can be treated by suppressing the pituitary hormones that induce sex steroid production. The opposite condition is delayed puberty.

The term is used with several slightly different meanings that are usually apparent from the context. In its broadest sense, and often simplified as early puberty, &quot;precocious puberty&quot; sometimes refers to any physical sex hormone effect, due to any cause, occurring earlier than the usual age, especially when it is being considered as a medical problem. Stricter definitions of &quot;precocity&quot; may refer only to central puberty starting before a statistically specified age based on percentile in the population (e.g., 2.5 standard deviations below the population mean), on expert recommendations of ages at which there is more than a negligible chance of discovering an abnormal cause, or based on opinion as to the age at which early puberty may have adverse effects. A common definition for medical purposes is onset before 8 years in girls or 9 years in boys.

== Causes ==
Early pubic hair, breast, or genital development may result from natural early maturation or from several other conditions.

=== Central ===
If the cause can be traced to the hypothalamus or pituitary, the cause is considered central. Other names for this type are &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;true precocious&quot; puberty.

Causes of central precocious puberty can include:
* hypothalamic hamartoma produces pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
* Langerhans cell histiocytosis
* McCune–Albright syndrome

Central precocious puberty can also be caused by brain tumors, infection (most commonly tuberculous meningitis, especially in developing countries), trauma, hydrocephalus, and Angelman syndrome. Precocious puberty is associated with advancement in bone age, which leads to early fusion of epiphyses, thus resulting in reduced final height and short stature.

Adrenocortical oncocytomas are rare with mostly benign and nonfunctioning tumors. There have been only three cases of functioning adrenocortical oncocytoma that have been reported up until 2013. Children with adrenocortical oncocytomas will present with &quot;premature pubarche, clitoromegaly, and increased serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and testosterone&quot; which are some of the presentations associated with precocious puberty.

Precocious puberty in girls begins before the age of 8. The youngest mother on record is Lina Medina, who gave birth at the age of either 5 years, 7 months and 17 days or 6 years 5 months as mentioned in another report.

&quot;Central precocious puberty (CPP) was reported in some patients with suprasellar arachnoid cysts (SAC), and SCFE (slipped capital femoral epiphysis) occurs in patients with CPP because of rapid growth and changes of growth hormone secretion.&quot;

If no cause can be identified, it is considered idiopathic or constitutional.

=== Peripheral ===
Secondary sexual development induced by sex steroids from other abnormal sources is referred to as &quot;peripheral precocious puberty&quot; or &quot;precocious pseudopuberty.&quot; It typically presents as a severe form of disease with children. Symptoms are usually as a sequelae from adrenal hyperplasia (because of 21-hydroxylase deficiency or 11-beta hydroxylase deficiency, the former being more common), which includes but is not limited to hypertension, hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, ambiguous genitalia in females, signs of virilization in females. Blood tests will typically reveal high level of androgens with low levels of cortisol.

Causes can include:
* Endogenous sources
** Gonadal tumors (such as arrhenoblastoma)
** Adrenal tumors
** Germ cell tumor
** Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
** McCune–Albright syndrome
** Silver–Russell syndrome
** Familial male-limited precocious puberty (testotoxicosis)
* Exogenous hormones
** Environmental exogenous hormones
** As treatment for another condition

=== Isosexual and heterosexual ===
Generally, patients with precocious puberty develop phenotypically appropriate secondary sexual characteristics. This is called &quot;isosexual&quot; precocity.

In some cases, a patient may develop characteristics of the opposite sex. For example, a male may develop breasts and other feminine characteristics, while a female may develop a deepened voice and facial hair. This is called &quot;heterosexual&quot; or &quot;contrasexual&quot; precocity. It is very rare in comparison to isosexual precocity and is usually the result of unusual circumstances. As an example, children with a very rare genetic condition called aromatase excess syndrome – in which exceptionally high circulating levels of estrogen are present – usually develop precocious puberty. Males and females are hyper-feminized by the syndrome. The &quot;opposite&quot; case would be the hyper-masculinisation of both male and female patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, in which there is an excess of androgens. Thus, in the aromatase excess syndrome the precocious puberty is isosexual in females and heterosexual in males, whilst in the CAH it is isosexual in males and heterosexual in females.

=== Research ===
Although the causes of early puberty are still somewhat unclear, girls who have a high-fat diet and are not physically active or are obese are more likely to physically mature earlier. &quot;Obese girls, defined as at least 10 kilograms (22 pounds) overweight, had an 80 percent chance of developing breasts before their ninth birthday and starting menstruation before age 12 – the western average for menstruation is about 12.7 years.&quot; In addition to diet and exercise habits, exposure to chemicals that mimic estrogen (known as xenoestrogens) is another possible cause of early puberty in girls. Bisphenol A, a xenoestrogen found in hard plastics, has been shown to affect sexual development. &quot;Factors other than obesity, however, perhaps genetic and/or environmental ones, are needed to explain the higher prevalence of early puberty in black versus white girls.&quot; While more girls are increasingly entering puberty at younger ages, new research indicates that some boys are actually starting later (delayed puberty). &quot;Increasing rates of obese and overweight children in the United States may be contributing to a later onset of puberty in boys, say researchers at the University of Michigan Health System.&quot;

High levels of beta-hCG in serum and cerebrospinal fluid observed in a 9-year-old boy suggest a pineal gland tumor. The tumor is called a &quot;chorionic gonadotropin secreting pineal tumor&quot;. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy reduced tumor and beta-hCG levels normalized.

In a study using neonatal melatonin on rats, results suggest that elevated melatonin could be responsible for some cases of early puberty.

Familial cases of idiopathic central precocious puberty (ICPP) have been reported, leading researchers to believe there are specific genetic modulators of ICPP. Mutations in genes such as LIN28, and LEP and LEPR, which encode leptin and the leptin receptor, have been associated with precocious puberty. The association between LIN28 and puberty timing was validated experimentally in vivo, when it was found that mice with ectopic over-expression of LIN28 show an extended period of pre-pubertal growth and a significant delay in puberty onset.

Mutations in the kisspeptin (KISS1) and its receptor, KISS1R (also known as GPR54), involved in GnRH secretion and puberty onset, are also thought to be the cause for ICPP However, this is still a controversial area of research, and some investigators found no association of mutations in the LIN28 and KISS1/KISS1R genes to be the common cause underlying ICPP.

The gene MKRN3, which is a maternally imprinted gene, was first cloned by Jong et al. in 1999. MKRN3 was originally named Zinc finger protein 127. It is located on human chromosome 15 on the long arm in the Prader-Willi syndrome critical region2, and has since been identified as a cause of premature sexual development or CPP. The identification of mutations in MKRN3 leading to sporadic cases of CPP has been a significant contribution to better understanding the mechanism of puberty. MKRN3 appears to act as a &quot;brake&quot; on the central hypothalamic-pituitary access. Thus, loss of function mutations of the protein allow early activation of the GnRH pathway and cause phenotypic CPP. Patients with a MKRN3 mutation all display the classic signs of CCP including early breast and testes development, increased bone aging and elevated hormone levels of GnRH and LH.

== Diagnosis ==
Studies indicate that breast development in girls and the appearance of pubic hair in both girls and boys are starting earlier than in previous generations. As a result, &quot;early puberty&quot; in children as young as 8 and 9 is no longer considered abnormal, particularly with girls. Although it is not considered as abnormal, it may be upsetting to parents and can be harmful to children who mature physically at a time when they are immature mentally.

No age reliably separates normal from abnormal processes in children, but the following age thresholds for evaluation are thought to minimize the risk of missing a significant medical problem:
* Breast development in boys before appearance of pubic hair or testicular enlargement
* Pubic hair or genital enlargement (gonadarche) in boys with onset before 9 years
* Pubic hair (pubarche) before 8 or breast development (thelarche) in girls with onset before 7 years
* Menstruation (menarche) in girls before 10 years

Medical evaluation is sometimes necessary to recognize the few children with serious conditions from the majority who have entered puberty early but are still medically normal. Early sexual development warrants evaluation because it may:
* induce early bone maturation and reduce eventual adult height
* indicate the presence of a tumour or other serious problem
* cause the child, particularly a girl, to become an object of adult sexual interest.

== Treatment ==
One possible treatment is with anastrozole. GnRH agonists, including histrelin, triptorelin, or leuprorelin, are other possible treatments. Non-continuous use of GnRH agonists stimulates the pituitary gland to release follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Triptorelin depot is widely used to treat central precocious puberty (CPP) in children.

Puberty blockers work by stabilizing puberty symptoms, decreasing growth velocity, and slowing skeletal maturation. The outcomes of treatment are assessed in terms of height, reproduction, metabolic, and psychosocial measures. The most pronounced effects on height have been seen in children experiencing the onset of puberty before 6 years of age; however there is variability in height outcomes across studies which can be attributed to varying study designs, time of symptom presentation, and time of treatment termination. A study investigating the effects of puberty blockers on reproductive health showed no significant difference in the number of irregular menstrual cycles, pregnancies, or pregnancy outcomes between women who received treatment for precocious puberty and those who opted out of treatment. Individuals with precocious puberty, early adrenarche, and early normal puberty show less stress after treatment compared to individuals without preexisting developmental conditions.

Blockers are also used in the treatment of central precocious puberty resulting from conditions like hypothalamic hamartomas or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, where early onset of puberty is a symptom. Additionally, puberty blockers can be prescribed for children with severe forms of idiopathic short stature, allowing for more time for growth before the closure of growth plates.

In the USA, since 1993, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has supported the use of puberty blockers to treat precocious puberty. Currently under FDA regulation the use of puberty blockers is considered on-label for the treatment of central precocious puberty.]

For years, the FDA, Endocrine Society, American Academy of Pediatrics(AAP) and many other pediatric associations have supported the use of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs(GnRHas) in central precocious puberty (CPP). 

In 2009, the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society and European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology published a consensus statement highlighting the effectiveness of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs(GnRHas) in early onset central precocious puberty. They confirmed that the use of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs(GnRHas) has had a positive effect on increasing adult height. However these Endocrine Societies believe additional research should be conducted before routinely suggesting GnRHAs for other conditions. There is still some uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of GnRHas when utilized for other conditions.

Overall, puberty blockers have demonstrated an excellent safety and efficacy profile in the treatment of precocious puberty. 

=== Side effects ===
The most common side effects reported include nonspecific headaches, hot flashes, and implant-related skin reactions.

A systematic review of studies investigating the long-term effects of treating precocious puberty with GnRH agonists found that bone mineral density decreases during treatment but normalizes afterward, with no lasting effects on peak bone mass.

== Prognosis ==
Early puberty is posited to put girls at higher risk of sexual abuse; however, a causal relationship is, as yet, inconclusive. Early puberty also puts girls at a higher risk for teasing or bullying, mental health disorders and short stature as adults. Girls as young as 8 are increasingly starting to menstruate, develop breasts and grow pubic and underarm hair; these &quot;biological milestones&quot; typically occurred only at 13 or older in the past. African-American girls are especially prone to early puberty.

Though boys face fewer problems from early puberty than girls do, early puberty is not always positive for boys. Early sexual maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of pubertal hormones. Because they appear older than their peers, pubescent boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms; society may view them as more emotionally advanced, although their cognitive and social development may lag behind their physical development. Studies have shown that early-maturing boys are more likely to be sexually active and are more likely to participate in risky behaviors.

== History ==
 is the Latin term used by physicians from the 1790s onward. Various hypotheses and inferences on pubertal (menstrual, procreative) timing are attested since ancient times, which, well into early modernity were explained on the basis of temperamental, humoral and Jungian &quot;complexional&quot; causes, or general or local &quot;plethora&quot; (blood excess).

<text>An evaporative cooler (also known as evaporative air conditioner, swamp cooler, swamp box, desert cooler and wet air cooler) is a device that cools air through the evaporation of water. Evaporative cooling differs from other air conditioning systems, which use vapor-compression or absorption refrigeration cycles. Evaporative cooling exploits the fact that water will absorb a relatively large amount of heat in order to evaporate (that is, it has a large enthalpy of vaporization). The temperature of dry air can be dropped significantly through the phase transition of liquid water to water vapor (evaporation). This can cool air using much less energy than refrigeration. In extremely dry climates, evaporative cooling of air has the added benefit of conditioning the air with more moisture for the comfort of building occupants.

The cooling potential for evaporative cooling is dependent on the wet-bulb depression, the difference between dry-bulb temperature and wet-bulb temperature (see relative humidity). In arid climates, evaporative cooling can reduce energy consumption and total equipment for conditioning as an alternative to compressor-based cooling. In climates not considered arid, indirect evaporative cooling can still take advantage of the evaporative cooling process without increasing humidity. Passive evaporative cooling strategies can offer the same benefits as mechanical evaporative cooling systems without the complexity of equipment and ductwork.

== History ==
An earlier form of evaporative cooling, the windcatcher, was first used in ancient Egypt and Persia thousands of years ago in the form of wind shafts on the roof. They caught the wind, passed it over subterranean water in a &quot;qanat&quot; and discharged the cooled air into the building. Modern Iranians have widely adopted powered evaporative coolers (&quot;&quot;).

The evaporative cooler was the subject of numerous US patents in the 20th century; many of these, starting in 1906, suggested or assumed the use of excelsior (wood wool) pads as the elements to bring a large volume of water in contact with moving air to allow evaporation to occur. A typical design, as shown in a 1945 patent, includes a water reservoir (usually with level controlled by a float valve), a pump to circulate water over the excelsior pads and a centrifugal fan to draw air through the pads and into the house. This design and this material remain dominant in evaporative coolers in the American Southwest, where they are also used to increase humidity. In the United States, the use of the term &quot;swamp cooler&quot; may be due to the odor of algae produced by early units.

Externally mounted evaporative cooling devices (car coolers) were used in some automobiles to cool interior air—often as aftermarket accessories—until modern vapor-compression air conditioning became widely available.

Passive evaporative cooling techniques in buildings have been a feature of desert architecture for centuries, but Western acceptance, study, innovation, and commercial application are all relatively recent. In 1974, William H. Goettl noticed how evaporative cooling technology works in arid climates, speculated that a combination unit could be more effective, and invented the &quot;High Efficiency Astro Air Piggyback System&quot;, a combination refrigeration and evaporative cooling air conditioner. In 1986, University of Arizona researchers built a passive evaporative cooling tower, and performance data from this experimental facility in Tucson, Arizona became the foundation of evaporative cooling tower design guidelines.

== Physical principles ==

Evaporative coolers lower the temperature of air using the principle of evaporative cooling, unlike typical air conditioning systems which use vapor-compression refrigeration or absorption refrigeration. Evaporative cooling is the conversion of liquid water into vapor using the thermal energy in the air, resulting in a lower air temperature. The energy needed to evaporate the water is taken from the air in the form of sensible heat, which affects the temperature of the air, and converted into latent heat, the energy present in the water vapor component of the air, whilst the air remains at a constant enthalpy value. This conversion of sensible heat to latent heat is known as an isenthalpic process because it occurs at a constant enthalpy value. Evaporative cooling therefore causes a drop in the temperature of air proportional to the sensible heat drop and an increase in humidity proportional to the latent heat gain. Evaporative cooling can be visualized using a psychrometric chart by finding the initial air condition and moving along a line of constant enthalpy toward a state of higher humidity.

A simple example of natural evaporative cooling is perspiration, or sweat, secreted by the body, evaporation of which cools the body. The amount of heat transfer depends on the evaporation rate, however for each kilogram of water vaporized 2,257 kJ of energy (about 890 BTU per pound of pure water, at 95 °F (35 °C)) are transferred. The evaporation rate depends on the temperature and humidity of the air, which is why sweat accumulates more on humid days, as it does not evaporate fast enough.

Vapor-compression refrigeration uses evaporative cooling, but the evaporated vapor is within a sealed system, and is then compressed ready to evaporate again, using energy to do so. A simple
evaporative cooler&#x27;s water is evaporated into the environment, and not recovered. In an interior space cooling unit, the evaporated water is introduced into the space along with the now-cooled air; in an evaporative tower the evaporated water is carried off in the airflow exhaust.

===Other types of phase-change cooling===
A closely related process, &quot;sublimation cooling&quot;, differs from evaporative cooling in that a phase transition from solid to vapor, rather than liquid to vapor, occurs.

Sublimation cooling has been observed to operate on a planetary scale on the planetoid Pluto, where it has been called an anti-greenhouse effect.

Another application of a phase change to cooling is the &quot;self-refrigerating&quot; beverage can. A separate compartment inside the can contains a desiccant and a liquid. Just before drinking, a tab is pulled so that the desiccant comes into contact with the liquid and dissolves. As it does so, it absorbs an amount of heat energy called the latent heat of fusion. Evaporative cooling works with the phase change of liquid into vapor and the latent heat of vaporization, but the self-cooling can uses a change from solid to liquid, and the latent heat of fusion, to achieve the same result.

==Applications==
Before the advent of modern refrigeration, evaporative cooling was used for millennia, for instance in &quot;qanats&quot;, windcatchers, and mashrabiyas. A porous earthenware vessel would cool water by evaporation through its walls; frescoes from about 2500 BCE show slaves fanning jars of water to cool rooms. Alternatively, a bowl filled with milk or butter could be placed in another bowl filled with water, all being covered with a wet cloth resting in the water, to keep the milk or butter as fresh as possible (see zeer, botijo and Coolgardie safe).


Evaporative cooling is a common form of cooling buildings for thermal comfort since it is relatively cheap and requires less energy than other forms of cooling.
The figure showing the Salt Lake City weather data represents the typical summer climate (June to September). The colored lines illustrate the potential of direct and indirect evaporative cooling strategies to expand the comfort range in summer time. It is mainly explained by the combination of a higher air speed on one hand and elevated indoor humidity when the region permits the direct evaporative cooling strategy on the other hand. Evaporative cooling strategies that involve the humidification of the air should be implemented in dry condition where the increase in moisture content stays below recommendations for occupant&#x27;s comfort and indoor air quality. Passive cooling towers lack the control that traditional HVAC systems offer to occupants. However, the additional air movement provided into the space can improve occupant comfort.

Evaporative cooling is most effective when the relative humidity is on the low side, limiting its popularity to dry climates. Evaporative cooling raises the internal humidity level significantly, which desert inhabitants may appreciate as the moist air re-hydrates dry skin and sinuses. Therefore, assessing typical climate data is an essential procedure to determine the potential of evaporative cooling strategies for a building. The three most important climate considerations are dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature, and wet-bulb depression during a typical summer day. It is important to determine if the wet-bulb depression can provide sufficient cooling during the summer day. By subtracting the wet-bulb depression from the outside dry-bulb temperature, one can estimate the approximate air temperature leaving the evaporative cooler. It is important to consider that the ability for the exterior dry-bulb temperature to reach the wet-bulb temperature depends on the saturation efficiency. A general recommendation for applying direct evaporative cooling is to implement it in places where the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air does not exceed . However, in the example of Salt Lake City, the upper limit for the direct evaporative cooling on psychrometric chart is . Despite the lower temperature, evaporative cooling is suitable for similar climates to Salt Lake City.

Evaporative cooling is especially well suited for climates where the air is hot and humidity is low. In the United States, the western and mountain states are good locations, with evaporative coolers prevalent in cities like Albuquerque, Denver, El Paso, Fresno, Salt Lake City, and Tucson. Evaporative air conditioning is also popular and well-suited to the southern (temperate) part of Australia. In dry, arid climates, the installation and operating cost of an evaporative cooler can be much lower than that of refrigerative air conditioning, often by 80% or so. However, evaporative cooling and vapor-compression air conditioning are sometimes used in combination to yield optimal cooling results. Some evaporative coolers may also serve as humidifiers in the heating season. In regions that are mostly arid, short periods of high humidity may prevent evaporative cooling from being an effective cooling strategy. An example of this event is the monsoon season in New Mexico and central and southern Arizona in July and August.

In locations with moderate humidity there are many cost-effective uses for evaporative cooling, in addition to their widespread use in dry climates. For example, industrial plants, commercial kitchens, laundries, dry cleaners, greenhouses, spot cooling (loading docks, warehouses, factories, construction sites, athletic events, workshops, garages, and kennels) and confinement farming (poultry ranches, hog, and dairy) often employ evaporative cooling. In highly humid climates, evaporative cooling may have little thermal comfort benefit beyond the increased ventilation and air movement it provides.

===Other examples===
Trees transpire large amounts of water through pores in their leaves called stomata, and through this process of evaporative cooling, forests interact with climate at local and global scales.
Simple evaporative cooling devices such as evaporative cooling chambers (ECCs) and clay pot coolers, or pot-in-pot refrigerators, are simple and inexpensive ways to keep vegetables fresh without the use of electricity. Several hot and dry regions throughout the world could potentially benefit from evaporative cooling, including North Africa, the Sahel region of Africa, the Horn of Africa, southern Africa, the Middle East, arid regions of South Asia, and Australia. Benefits of evaporative cooling chambers for many rural communities in these regions include reduced post-harvest loss, less time spent traveling to the market, monetary savings, and increased availability of vegetables for consumption.

Evaporative cooling is commonly used in cryogenic applications. The vapor above a reservoir of cryogenic liquid is pumped away, and the liquid continuously evaporates as long as the liquid&#x27;s vapor pressure is significant. Evaporative cooling of ordinary helium forms a 1-K pot, which can cool to at least 1.2 K. Evaporative cooling of helium-3 can provide temperatures below 300 mK. These techniques can be used to make cryocoolers, or as components of lower-temperature cryostats such as dilution refrigerators. As the temperature decreases, the vapor pressure of the liquid also falls, and cooling becomes less effective. This sets a lower limit to the temperature attainable with a given liquid.

Evaporative cooling is also the last cooling step in order to reach the ultra-low temperatures required for Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC). Here, so-called forced evaporative cooling is used to selectively remove high-energetic (&quot;hot&quot;) atoms from an atom cloud until the remaining cloud is cooled below the BEC transition temperature. For a cloud of 1 million alkali atoms, this temperature is about 1μK.

Although robotic spacecraft use thermal radiation almost exclusively, many crewed spacecraft have short missions that permit open-cycle evaporative cooling. Examples include the Space Shuttle, the Apollo command and service module (CSM), lunar module and portable life support system. The Apollo CSM and the Space Shuttle also had radiators, and the Shuttle could evaporate ammonia as well as water. The Apollo spacecraft used sublimators, compact and largely passive devices that dump waste heat in water vapor (steam) that is vented to space. When liquid water is exposed to vacuum it boils vigorously, carrying away enough heat to freeze the remainder to ice that covers the sublimator and automatically regulates the feedwater flow depending on the heat load. The water expended is often available in surplus from the fuel cells used by many crewed spacecraft to produce electricity.

== Designs ==

Most designs take advantage of the fact that water has one of the highest known enthalpy of vaporization (latent heat of vaporization) values of any common substance. Because of this, evaporative coolers use only a fraction of the energy of vapor-compression or absorption air conditioning systems. Except in very dry climates, the single-stage (direct) cooler can increase relative humidity (RH) to a level that makes occupants uncomfortable. Indirect and two-stage evaporative coolers keep the RH lower.

===Direct evaporative cooling===

&quot;Direct evaporative cooling&quot; (open circuit) is used to lower the temperature and increase the humidity of air by using latent heat of evaporation, changing liquid water to water vapor. In this process, the energy in the air does not change. Warm dry air is changed to cool moist air. The heat of the outside air is used to evaporate water. The RH increases to 70 to 90% which reduces the cooling effect of human perspiration. The moist air has to be continually released to outside or else the air becomes saturated and evaporation stops.
A &quot;mechanical&quot; direct evaporative cooler unit uses a fan to draw air through a wetted membrane, or pad, which provides a large surface area for the evaporation of water into the air. Water is sprayed at the top of the pad so it can drip down into the membrane and continually keep the membrane saturated. Any excess water that drips out from the bottom of the membrane is collected in a pan and recirculated to the top. Single-stage direct evaporative coolers are typically small in size as they only consist of the membrane, water pump, and centrifugal fan. The mineral content of the municipal water supply will cause scaling on the membrane, which will lead to clogging over the life of the membrane. Depending on this mineral content and the evaporation rate, regular cleaning and maintenance are required to ensure optimal performance. Generally, supply air from the single-stage evaporative cooler will need to be exhausted directly (one-through flow) as with direct evaporative cooling. A few design solutions have been conceived to utilize the energy in the air, like directing the exhaust air through two sheets of double glazed windows, thus reducing the solar energy absorbed through the glazing. Compared to energy required to achieve the equivalent cooling load with a compressor, single stage evaporative coolers consume less energy.
&quot;Passive&quot; direct evaporative cooling can occur anywhere that the evaporatively cooled water can cool a space without the assistance of a fan. This can be achieved through the use of fountains or more architectural designs such as the evaporative downdraft cooling tower, also called a &quot;passive cooling tower&quot;. The passive cooling tower design allows outside air to flow in through the top of a tower that is constructed within or next to the building. The outside air comes in contact with water inside the tower either through a wetted membrane or a mister. As water evaporates in the outside air, the air becomes cooler and less buoyant and creates a downward flow in the tower. At the bottom of the tower, an outlet allows the cooler air into the interior. Similar to mechanical evaporative coolers, towers can be an attractive low-energy solution for hot and dry climate as they only require a water pump to raise water to the top of the tower.
Energy savings from using a passive direct evaporating cooling strategy depends on the climate and heat load. For arid climates with a great wet-bulb depression, cooling towers can provide enough cooling during summer design conditions to be net zero. For example, a 371 m2 (4,000 ft2) retail store in Tucson, Arizona with a sensible heat gain of 29.3 kJ/h (100,000 Btu/h) can be cooled entirely by two passive cooling towers providing 11890 m3/h (7,000 cfm) each.

For the Zion National Park visitors&#x27; center, which uses two passive cooling towers, the cooling energy intensity was 14.5 MJ/m2 (1.28 kBtu/ft2;), which was 77% less than a typical building in the western United States that uses 62.5 MJ/m2 (5.5 kBtu/ft2). A study of field performance results in Kuwait revealed that power requirements for an evaporative cooler are approximately 75% less than the power requirements for a conventional packaged unit air-conditioner.

===Indirect evaporative cooling===

&quot;Indirect evaporative cooling&quot; (closed circuit) is a cooling process that uses direct evaporative cooling in addition to some heat exchanger to transfer the cool energy to the supply air. The cooled moist air from the direct evaporative cooling process never comes in direct contact with the conditioned supply air. The moist air stream is released outside or used to cool other external devices such as solar cells which are more efficient if kept cool. This is done to avoid excess humidity in enclosed spaces, which is not appropriate for residential systems.

====Maisotsenko cycle====

Indirect cooler manufacturer uses the Maisotsenko cycle (M-Cycle), named after inventor and Professor Dr. Valeriy Maisotsenko, employs an iterative (multi-step) heat exchanger made of a thin recyclable membrane that can reduce the temperature of product air to below the wet-bulb temperature, and can approach the dew point. Testing by the US Department of Energy found that a hybrid M-Cycle combined with a standard compression refrigeration system significantly improved efficiency by between 150 and 400% but was only capable of doing so in the dry western half of the US, and did not recommend being used in the much more humid eastern half of the US. The evaluation found that the system water consumption of 2–3 gallons per cooling ton (12,000 BTUs) was roughly equal in efficiency to the water consumption of new high efficiency power plants. This means the higher efficiency can be utilized to reduce load on the grid without requiring any additional water, and may actually reduce water usage if the source of the power does not have a high efficiency cooling system.

An M-Cycle based system built by Coolerado is currently being used to cool the Data Center for NASA&#x27;s National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). The facility is air cooled below 70 degrees Fahrenheit and uses the Coolerado system above that temperature. This is possible because the air handler for the system uses fresh outside air, which allows it to automatically use cool outside ambient air when conditions allow. This avoids running the refrigeration system when unnecessary. It is powered by a solar panel array which also serves as secondary power in case of main power loss.

The system has very high efficiency but, like other evaporative cooling systems, is constrained by the ambient humidity levels, which has limited its adoption for residential use. It may be used as supplementary cooling during times of extreme heat without placing significant additional burden on electrical infrastructure. If a location has excess water supplies or excess desalination capacity it can be used to reduce excessive electrical demand by utilizing water in affordable M-Cycle units. Due to high costs of conventional air conditioning units and extreme limitations of many electrical utility systems, M-Cycle units may be the only appropriate cooling systems suitable for impoverished areas during times of extremely high temperature and high electrical demand. In developed areas, they may serve as supplemental backup systems in case of electrical overload, and can be used to boost efficiency of existing conventional systems.

The M-Cycle is not limited to cooling systems and can be applied to various technologies from Stirling engines to Atmospheric water generators. For cooling applications it can be used in both cross flow and counterflow configurations. Counterflow was found to obtain lower temperatures more suitable for home cooling, but cross flow was found to have a higher coefficient of performance (COP), and is therefore better for large industrial installations.

Unlike traditional refrigeration techniques, the COP of small systems remains high, as they do not require lift pumps or other equipment required for cooling towers. A 1.5 ton/4.4 kW cooling system requires just 200 watts for operation of the fan, giving a COP of 26.4 and an EER rating of 90. This does not take into account the energy required to purify or deliver the water, and is strictly the power required to run the device once water is supplied. Though desalination of water also presents a cost, the latent heat of vaporization of water is nearly 100 times higher than the energy required to purify the water itself. Furthermore, the device has a maximum efficiency of 55%, so its actual COP is much lower than this calculated value. However, regardless of these losses, the effective COP is still significantly higher than a conventional cooling system, even if water must first be purified by desalination. In areas where water is not available in any form, it can be used with a desiccant to recover water using available heat sources, such as solar thermal energy.

====Theoretical designs====

In the newer but yet-to-be-commercialized &quot;cold-SNAP&quot; design from Harvard&#x27;s Wyss Institute, a 3D-printed ceramic conducts heat but is half-coated with a hydrophobic material that serves as a moisture barrier. While no moisture is added to the incoming air the relative humidity (RH) does rise a little according to the Temperature-RH formula. Still, the relatively dry air resulting from indirect evaporative cooling allows inhabitants&#x27; perspiration to evaporate more easily, increasing the relative effectiveness of this technique. Indirect Cooling is an effective strategy for hot-humid climates that cannot afford to increase the moisture content of the supply air due to indoor air quality and human thermal comfort concerns. 

&quot;Passive&quot; indirect evaporative cooling strategies are rare because this strategy involves an architectural element to act as a heat exchanger (for example a roof). This element can be sprayed with water and cooled through the evaporation of the water on this element. These strategies are rare due to the high use of water, which also introduces the risk of water intrusion and compromising building structure.

===Hybrid designs===
====Two-stage evaporative cooling, or indirect-direct====
In the first stage of a two-stage cooler, warm air is pre-cooled indirectly without adding humidity (by passing inside a heat exchanger that is cooled by evaporation on the outside). In the direct stage, the pre-cooled air passes through a water-soaked pad and picks up humidity as it cools. Since the air supply is pre-cooled in the first stage, less humidity is transferred in the direct stage, to reach the desired cooling temperatures. The result, according to manufacturers, is cooler air with a RH between 50 and 70%, depending on the climate, compared to a traditional system that produces about 70–80% relative humidity in the conditioned air.

====Evaporative + conventional backup====
In another &quot;hybrid&quot; design, direct or indirect cooling has been combined with vapor-compression or absorption air conditioning to increase the overall efficiency and/or to reduce the temperature below the wet-bulb limit.

==== Evaporative + passive daytime radiative + thermal insulation ====
Evaporative cooling can be combined with passive daytime radiative cooling and thermal insulation to enhance cooling power with zero energy use, albeit with an occasional water &quot;re-charge&quot; depending on the climatic zone of the installation. The system, developed by Lu et al. &quot;consists of a solar reflector, a water-rich and IR-emitting evaporative layer, and a vapor-permeable, IR-transparent, and solar-reflecting insulation layer,&quot; with the top layer enabling &quot;heat removal through both evaporation and radiation while resisting environmental heating.&quot; The system demonstrated 300% higher ambient cooling power than stand-alone passive daytime radiative cooling and could extend the shelf life of food by 40% in cool humid climates and 200% in dry climates without refrigeration.

====Membrane dehumidification and evaporative cooling====
Conventional evaporative cooling only works with dry air, e.g. when the humidity ratio is below ~0.02 kgwater/kgair. They also require substantial water inputs. To remove these limitations, dewpoint evaporative cooling can be hybridized with membrane dehumidification, using membranes that pass water vapor but block air. Air passing through these membranes can be concentrated with a compressor, so it can be condensed at warmer temperatures. The first configuration with this approach reused the dehumidification water to provide further evaporative cooling. Such an approach can fully provide its own water for evaporative cooling, outperforms a baseline desiccant wheel system under all conditions, and outperforms vapor compression in dry conditions. It can also allow for cooling at higher humidity without the use of refrigerants, many of which have substantial greenhouse gas potential.

===Materials===
Traditionally, evaporative &quot;cooler pads&quot; consist of excelsior (aspen wood fiber) inside a containment net, but more modern materials, such as some plastics and melamine paper, are entering use as cooler-pad media. Modern rigid media, commonly 8&quot; or 12&quot; thick, adds more moisture, and thus cools air more than typically much thinner aspen media. Another material which is sometimes used is corrugated cardboard.

===Design considerations===

====Water use====
In arid and semi-arid climates, the scarcity of water makes water consumption a concern in cooling system design. From the installed water meters, 420938 L (111,200 gal) of water were consumed during 2002 for the two passive cooling towers at the Zion National Park visitors&#x27; center. However, such concerns are addressed by experts who note that electricity generation usually requires a large amount of water, and evaporative coolers use far less electricity, and thus comparable water overall, and cost less overall, compared to chillers.

====Shading====
Allowing direct solar exposure to any surface which can transfer the extra heat to any part of the air flow through the unit will raise the temperature of the air. If the heat is transferred to the air prior to flowing through the pads, or if the sunlight warms the pads themselves, evaporation will increase, but the additional energy required to achieve this will not come from the energy contained in the ambient air, but will be supplied by the sun, and this will result not only in higher temperatures, but higher humidity as well, just as raising the inlet air temperature by any means, and heating the water prior to distribution over the pad by any means, would do. In addition, sunlight may degrade some media, and other components of the cooler. Therefore, shading is advisable in all circumstances, though the vertical aspect of the pads, and insulation between the exterior and interior horizontal (upwards facing) surfaces to minimise heat transfer will suffice.

====Mechanical systems====
Apart from fans used in mechanical evaporative cooling, pumps are the only other piece of mechanical equipment required for the evaporative cooling process in both mechanical and passive applications. Pumps can be used for either recirculating the water to the wet media pad or providing water at very high pressure to a mister system for a passive cooling tower. Pump specifications will vary depending on evaporation rates and media pad area. The Zion National Park visitors&#x27; center uses a 250 W (1/3 HP) pump.

====Exhaust====
Exhaust ducts and/or open windows must be used at all times to allow air to continually escape the air-conditioned area. Otherwise, pressure develops and the fan or blower in the system is unable to push much air through the media and into the air-conditioned area. The evaporative system cannot function without exhausting the continuous supply of air from the air-conditioned area to the outside. By optimizing the placement of the cooled-air inlet, along with the layout of the house passages, related doors, and room windows, the system can be used most effectively to direct the cooled air to the required areas. A well-designed layout can effectively scavenge and expel the hot air from desired areas without the need for an above-ceiling ducted venting system. Continuous airflow is essential, so the exhaust windows or vents must not restrict the volume and passage of air being introduced by the evaporative cooling machine. One must also be mindful of the outside wind direction, as, for example, a strong hot southerly wind will slow or restrict the exhausted air from a south-facing window. It is always best to have the downwind windows open, while the upwind windows are closed.

==Different types of installations==

=== Typical installations ===
Typically, residential and industrial evaporative coolers use direct evaporation, and can be described as an enclosed metal or plastic box with vented sides. Air is moved by a centrifugal fan or blower (usually driven by an electric motor with pulleys known as &quot;sheaves&quot; in HVAC terminology, or a direct-driven axial fan), and a water pump is used to wet the evaporative cooling pads. The cooling units can be mounted on the roof (down draft, or downflow) or exterior walls or windows (side draft, or horizontal flow) of buildings. To cool, the fan draws ambient air through vents on the unit&#x27;s sides and through the damp pads. Heat in the air evaporates water from the pads which are constantly re-dampened to continue the cooling process. Then cooled, moist air is delivered into the building via a vent in the roof or wall.

Because the cooling air originates outside the building, one or more large vents must exist to allow air to move from inside to outside. Air should only be allowed to pass once through the system, or the cooling effect will decrease. This is due to the air reaching the saturation point. Often 15 or so air changes per hour (ACHs) occur in spaces served by evaporative coolers, a relatively high rate of air exchange.

=== Evaporative (wet) cooling towers ===
Cooling towers are structures for cooling water or other heat transfer media to near-ambient wet-bulb temperature. Wet cooling towers operate on the evaporative cooling principle, but are optimized to cool the water rather than the air. Cooling towers can often be found on large buildings or on industrial sites. They transfer heat to the environment from chillers, industrial processes, or the Rankine power cycle, for example.

=== Misting systems ===

Misting systems work by forcing water via a high pressure pump and tubing through a brass and stainless steel mist nozzle that has an orifice of about 5 micrometres, thereby producing a micro-fine mist. The water droplets that create the mist are so small that they instantly flash-evaporate. Flash evaporation can reduce the surrounding air temperature by as much as 35 °F (20 °C) in just seconds. For patio systems, it is ideal to mount the mist line approximately 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3.0 m) above the ground for optimum cooling. Misting is used for applications such as flowerbeds, pets, livestock, kennels, insect control, odor control, zoos, veterinary clinics, cooling of produce, and greenhouses.

==== Misting fans ====
A misting fan is similar to a humidifier. A fan blows a fine mist of water into the air. If the air is not too humid, the water evaporates, absorbing heat from the air, allowing the misting fan to also work as an air cooler. A misting fan may be used outdoors, especially in a dry climate. It may also be used indoors.

Small portable battery-powered misting fans, consisting of an electric fan and a hand-operated water spray pump, are sold as novelty items. Their effectiveness in everyday use is unclear.

== Performance ==
Understanding evaporative cooling performance requires an understanding of psychrometrics. Evaporative cooling performance is variable due to changes in external temperature and humidity level. A residential cooler should be able to decrease the temperature of air to within of the wet bulb temperature.

It is simple to predict cooler performance from standard weather report information. Because weather reports usually contain the dewpoint and relative humidity, but not the wet-bulb temperature, a psychrometric chart or a simple computer program must be used to compute the wet bulb temperature. Once the wet bulb temperature and the dry bulb temperature are identified, the cooling performance or leaving air temperature of the cooler may be determined.

For direct evaporative cooling, the direct saturation efficiency, formula_1, measures in what extent the temperature of the air leaving the direct evaporative cooler is close to the wet-bulb temperature of the entering air. The direct saturation efficiency can be determined as follows:

::formula_2

:Where:
::&quot;formula_1&quot; = direct evaporative cooling saturation efficiency (%)
::&quot;formula_4&quot; = entering air dry-bulb temperature (°C)
::&quot;formula_5&quot; = leaving air dry-bulb temperature (°C)
::&quot;formula_6&quot; = entering air wet-bulb temperature (°C)

Evaporative media efficiency usually runs between 80% and 90%. Most efficient systems can lower the dry air temperature to 95% of the wet-bulb temperature, the least efficient systems only achieve 50%. The evaporation efficiency drops very little over time.

Typical aspen pads used in residential evaporative coolers offer around 85% efficiency while CELdek type of evaporative media offer efficiencies of &gt;90% depending on air velocity. The CELdek media is more often used in large commercial and industrial installations.

As an example, in Las Vegas, with a typical summer design day of  dry bulb and  wet bulb temperature or about 8% relative humidity, the leaving air temperature of a residential cooler with 85% efficiency would be:

:&quot;formula_5&quot; = 42 °C – [(42 °C – 19 °C) × 85%] = 

However, either of two methods can be used to estimate performance:
* Use a psychrometric chart to calculate wet bulb temperature, and then add 5–7 °F as described above.
* Use a rule of thumb which estimates that the wet bulb temperature is approximately equal to the ambient temperature, minus one third of the difference between the ambient temperature and the dew point. As before, add 5–7 °F as described above.

Some examples clarify this relationship:
* At and 15% relative humidity, air may be cooled to nearly . The dew point for these conditions is .
* At 32 °C and 50% relative humidity, air may be cooled to about . The dew point for these conditions is .
* At and 15% relative humidity, air may be cooled to nearly . The dew point for these conditions is .

(&quot;Cooling examples extracted from the June 25, 2000 University of Idaho publication, &quot;Homewise&quot;&quot;).

Because evaporative coolers perform best in dry conditions, they are widely used and most effective in arid, desert regions such as the southwestern USA, northern Mexico, and Rajasthan.

The same equation indicates why evaporative coolers are of limited use in highly humid environments: for example, a hot August day in Tokyo may be with 85% relative humidity, 1,005 hPa pressure. This gives a dew point of and a wet-bulb temperature of . According to the formula above, at 85% efficiency air may be cooled only down to which makes it quite impractical.

==Comparison to other types of air conditioning==
Comparison of evaporative cooling to refrigeration-based air conditioning:

===Advantages===
Less expensive to install and operate
* Estimated cost for professional installation is about half or less that of central refrigerated air conditioning.
* Estimated cost of operation is 1/8 that of refrigerated air conditioning.
* No power spike when turned on due to lack of a compressor.
* Power consumption is limited to the fan and water pump, which have a relatively low current draw at start-up.
* The working fluid is water. No special refrigerants, such as ammonia or CFCs, are used that could be toxic, expensive to replace, contribute to ozone depletion and/or be subject to stringent licensing and environmental regulations.
* Newly launched air coolers can be operated though remote control.

Ease of installation and maintenance
* Equipment can be installed by mechanically-inclined users at drastically lower cost than refrigeration equipment which requires specialized skills and professional installation.
* The only two mechanical parts in most basic evaporative coolers are the fan motor and the water pump, both of which can be repaired or replaced at low cost and often by a mechanically inclined user, eliminating costly service calls to HVAC contractors.

Ventilation air
* The frequent and high volumetric flow rate of air traveling through the building reduces the &quot;age-of-air&quot; in the building dramatically.
* Evaporative cooling increases humidity. In dry climates, this may improve comfort and decrease static electricity problems.
* The pad itself acts as a rather effective air filter when properly maintained; it is capable of removing a variety of contaminants in air, including urban ozone caused by pollution, regardless of very dry weather. Refrigeration-based cooling systems lose this ability whenever there is not enough humidity in the air to keep the evaporator wet while providing a frequent trickle of condensation that washes out dissolved impurities removed from the air.

===Disadvantages===
Performance
* Most evaporative coolers are unable to reach as low a temperature as refrigerated air conditioning systems.
* High dewpoint (humidity) conditions decrease the cooling capability of the evaporative cooler.
* No dehumidification. Traditional air conditioners remove moisture from the air, except in very dry locations where recirculation can lead to a buildup of humidity. Evaporative cooling adds moisture, and in humid climates, dryness may improve thermal comfort at higher temperatures.

Comfort
* The air supplied by the evaporative cooler is generally 80–90% relative humidity and can cause interior humidity levels as high as 65%; very humid air reduces the evaporation rate of moisture from the skin, nose, lungs, and eyes.
* High humidity in air accelerates corrosion, particularly in the presence of dust. This can considerably reduce the life of electronics and other equipment.
* High humidity in air may cause condensation of water. This can be a problem for some situations (e.g., electrical equipment, computers, paper, books, old wood).
* Odors and other outdoor contaminants may be blown into the building unless sufficient filtering is in place.

Water use
* Evaporative coolers require a constant supply of water.
* Water high in mineral content (hard water) will leave mineral deposits on the pads and interior of the cooler. Depending on the type and concentration of minerals, possible safety hazards during the replacement and waste removal of the pads could be present. Bleed-off and refill (purge pump) systems can reduce but not eliminate this problem. Installation of an inline water filter (refrigerator drinking water/ice maker type) will drastically reduce the mineral deposits.

Maintenance frequency
* Any mechanical components that can rust or corrode need regular cleaning or replacement due to the environment of high moisture and potentially heavy mineral deposits in areas with hard water.
* Evaporative media must be replaced on a regular basis to maintain cooling performance. Wood wool pads are inexpensive but require replacement every few months. Higher-efficiency rigid media is much more expensive but will last for a number of years proportional to the water hardness; in areas with very hard water, rigid media may only last for two years before mineral scale build-up unacceptably degrades performance.
* In areas with cold winters, evaporative coolers must be drained and winterized to protect the water line and cooler from freeze damage and then de-winterized prior to the cooling season.

Health hazards
* An evaporative cooler is a common place for mosquito breeding. Numerous authorities consider an improperly maintained cooler to be a threat to public health.
* Mold and bacteria may be dispersed into interior air from improperly maintained or defective systems, causing sick building syndrome and adverse effects for asthma and allergy sufferers. This can also cause a foul odor. 
* Wood wool of dry cooler pads can catch fire even from small sparks.

<doc id="651378" wikidata="Q1516012" url="?curid=651378" title="Delayed puberty">
<text>Delayed puberty is when a person lacks or has incomplete development of specific sexual characteristics past the usual age of onset of puberty. The person may have no physical or hormonal signs that puberty has begun. In the United States, girls are considered to have delayed puberty if they lack breast development by age 13 or have not started menstruating by age 15. Boys are considered to have delayed puberty if they lack enlargement of the testicles by age 14. Delayed puberty affects about 2% of adolescents.

Most commonly, puberty may be delayed for several years and still occur normally, in which case it is considered constitutional delay of growth and puberty, a common variation of healthy physical development. Delay of puberty may also occur due to various causes such as malnutrition, various systemic diseases, or defects of the reproductive system (hypogonadism) or the body&#x27;s responsiveness to sex hormones.

Initial workup for delayed puberty not due to a chronic condition involves measuring serum FSH, LH, testosterone/estradiol, as well as bone age radiography. If it becomes clear that there is a permanent defect of the reproductive system, treatment usually involves replacement of the appropriate hormones (testosterone/dihydrotestosterone for boys, estradiol and progesterone for girls).

==Timing and definitions==

Puberty is considered delayed when the child has not begun puberty when two standard deviations or about 95% of children from similar backgrounds have.

In North American girls, puberty is considered delayed when breast development has not begun by age 13, when they have not started menstruating by age 15, and when there is no increased growth rate. Furthermore, slowed progression through the Tanner scale or lack of menarche within 3 years of breast development may also be considered delayed puberty.

In the United States, the age of onset of puberty in girls depends heavily on their racial background. Delayed puberty means the lack of breast development by age 12.8 years for White girls, and by age 12.4 years for Black girls. The lack of menstruation by age 15 in any ethnic background is considered delayed.

In North American boys, puberty is considered delayed when the testes remain less than 2.5 cm in diameter or less than 4 mL in volume by the age of 14. Delayed puberty is more common in males.

Although the absence of pubic and/or axillary hair is common in children with delayed puberty, the presence of sexual hair is due to adrenal sex hormone secretion unrelated to the sex hormones produced by the ovaries or testes.

The age of onset of puberty is dependent on genetics, general health, socioeconomic status, and environmental exposures. Children residing closer to the equator, at lower altitudes, in cities and other urban areas generally begin the process of puberty earlier than their counterparts. Mildly obese to morbidly obese children are also more likely to begin puberty earlier than children of normal weight. Variations in genes related to obesity, such as FTO or NEGRI, have been associated with earlier onset of puberty. Children whose parents started puberty at an earlier age were also more likely to experience it themselves, especially in women where onset of menstruation correlated well between mothers and daughters and between sisters.

==Causes==
Pubertal delay can be separated into four categories from most to least common:

=== Constitutional and physiologic delay ===
Children who are healthy but have a slower rate of physical development than average have a constitutional delay with a subsequent delay in puberty. It is the most common cause of delayed puberty in girls (30%) and even more so in boys (65%). It is commonly inherited, with as much as 80% of the variation in the age of onset of puberty due to genetic factors. These children have a history of shorter stature than their age-matched peers throughout childhood, but their height is appropriate for bone age, meaning that they have delayed skeletal maturation with potential for future growth.

It is often difficult to establish if it is a true constitutional delay of growth and puberty or if there is an underlying pathology because lab tests are not always discriminatory. In the absence of any other symptoms, short stature, delayed growth in height and weight, and/or delayed puberty may be the only clinical manifestations of certain chronic diseases including coeliac disease.

=== Malnutrition or chronic disease ===
When underweight or sickly children are present with pubertal delay, it is warranted to search for illnesses that cause a temporary and reversible delay in puberty. Chronic conditions such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia, cystic fibrosis, HIV/AIDS, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, and chronic gastroenteric disorders (such as coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease) cause a delayed activation of the hypothalamic region of the brain to send signals to start puberty.

Childhood cancer survivors can also present with delayed puberty secondary to their cancer treatments, especially males. The type of treatment, amount of exposure/dosage of drugs, and age during treatment determine the level by which the gonads are affected, with younger patients at a lower risk of negative reproductive effects.

Excessive physical exercise and physical stress, especially in athletes can also delay pubertal onset. Eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa can also impair puberty due to undernutrition.

Carbohydrate-restricted diets for weight loss have also been shown to decrease the stimulation of insulin which in turn does not stimulate kisspeptin neurons, vital in the release of puberty-starting hormones. This shows that carbohydrate restricted children and children with diabetes mellitus type 1 can have delayed puberty.

=== Primary failure of the ovaries or testes (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism) ===

Primary failure of the ovaries or testes (gonads) will cause delayed puberty due to the lack of hormonal response by the final receptors of the HPG axis. In this scenario, the brain sends a lot of hormonal signals (high gonadotropin), but the gonads are unable to respond to said signals causing hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism can be caused by congenital defects or acquired defects.

==== Congenital disorders ====
Congenital diseases include untreated cryptorchidism where the testicles fail to descend from the abdomen. Other congenital disorders are genetic in nature. In males, there can be deformities in the seminiferous tubule as in Klinefelter syndrome (most common cause in males), defects in the production of testicular steroids, receptor mutations preventing testicular hormones from working, chromosomal abnormalities such as Noonan syndrome, or problems with the cells making up the testes. Females can also have chromosomal abnormalities such as Turner syndrome (most common cause in girls), XX gonadal dysgenesis, and XY gonadal dysgenesis, problems in the ovarian hormone synthesis pathway such as aromatase deficiency or congenital anatomical deformities such as Müllerian agenesis.

==== Acquired disorders ====
Acquired diseases include mumps orchitis, Coxsackievirus B infection, irradiation, chemotherapy, or trauma; all problems causing the gonads to fail.

=== Genetic or acquired defect of the hormonal pathway of puberty (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) ===

The hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis can also be affected at the level of the brain. The brain does not send its hormonal signals to the gonads (low gonadotropins), causing the gonads to never be activated in the first place, resulting in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The HPG axis can be altered in two places, at the hypothalamic or at the pituitary level. CNS disorders such as childhood brain tumors (&quot;e.g.&quot; craniopharyngioma, prolactinoma, germinoma, glioma) can disrupt the communication between the hypothalamus and the pituitary. Pituitary tumors, especially prolactinomas, can increase the level of dopamine causing an inhibiting effect to the HPG axis. Hypothalamic disorders include Prader-Willi syndrome and Kallmann syndrome, but the most common cause of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a functional deficiency in the hormone regulator produced by the hypothalamus, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone or GnRH.

==Diagnosis==
Pediatric endocrinologists are the physicians with the most training and experience in evaluating delayed puberty. A complete medical history, review of systems, growth pattern, and physical examination, as well as laboratory testing and imaging, will reveal most of the systemic diseases and conditions capable of arresting development or delaying puberty, as well as providing clues to some of the recognizable syndromes affecting the reproductive system.

Timely medical assessment is a necessity since as many as half of girls with delayed puberty have an underlying pathology.

=== History and physical ===

==== Constitutional and physiologic delay ====
Children with constitutional delay are reported to be shorter than their peers, lacking a growth spurt, and having an overall smaller build. Their growth has begun to slow down years before the expected growth spurt secondary to puberty, which helps differentiate a constitutional delay from an HPG-axis related disorder. A complete family history with the ages at which parents hit the pubertal milestones can also provide a reference point for the expected age of puberty. Growth measurement parameters in children with suspected constitutional delay include a height, a weight, the rate of growth, and the calculated mid-parental height which represents the expected adult height for the child.

==== Malnutrition or chronic disease ====
Diet and physical activity habits, as well as history of previous serious illnesses and medication history can provide clues as to the cause of delayed puberty. Delayed growth and puberty can be the first signs of severe chronic illnesses such as metabolic disorders including inflammatory bowel disease and hypothyroidism. Symptoms such as fatigue, pain, and abnormal stooling pattern are suggestive of an underlying chronic condition. Low BMI can lead a physician to diagnose an eating disorder, undernutrition, child abuse, or chronic gastrointestinal disorders.

==== Primary failure of the ovaries or testes ====
A eunuchoid body shape where the arm span exceeds the height by more than 5 cm suggests a delay in growth plate closure secondary to hypogonadism. Turner syndrome has unique diagnostic features including a webbed neck, short stature, shield chest, and low hairline. Klinefelter syndrome presents with tall stature as well as small, firm testes.

==== Genetic or acquired defect of the hormonal pathway of puberty ====
Lacking the sense of smell (anosmia) along with delayed puberty are strong clinical indications for Kallmann syndrome. Deficiencies in GnRH, the signalling hormone produced by the hypothalamus, can cause congenital malformations including cleft lip and scoliosis. The presence of neurological symptoms including headaches and visual disturbances suggest a brain disorder such as a brain tumor causing hypopituitarism. The presence of neurological symptoms in addition to lactation are signs of high prolactin levels and could indicate either a drug side effect or a prolactinoma.

=== Imaging ===

Since bone maturation is a good indicator of overall physical maturation, an X-ray of the left hand and wrist to assess bone age usually reveals whether the child has reached a stage of physical maturation at which puberty should be occurring. X-ray displaying a bone age &lt;11 years in girls or &lt;13 years in boys (despite a higher chronological age) is most often consistent with constitutional delay of puberty. An MRI of the brain should be considered if neurological symptoms are present in addition to delayed puberty, two findings suspicious for pituitary or hypothalamic tumors. An MRI can also confirm the diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome due to the absence or abnormal development of the olfactory tract. However, in the absence of clear neurological symptoms, an MRI may not be the most cost-effective option. A pelvic ultrasound can detect anatomical abnormalities including undescended testes and Müllerian agenesis.

=== Laboratory evaluation ===

The first step in evaluating children with delayed puberty involves differentiating between the different causes of delayed puberty. Constitutional delay can be evaluated with a thorough history, physical, and bone age. Malnutrition and chronic diseases can be diagnosed through history and disease-specific testing. Screening studies include a complete blood count, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and thyroid studies. Hypogonadism can be differentiated between hyper- and hypo-gonadotropic hypogonadism by measuring serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) (gonadotropins to measure pituitary output), and estradiol in girls (to measure gonadal output). By the age of 10–12, children with failure of the ovaries or testes will have high LH and FSH because the brain is attempting to jump-start puberty, but the gonads are not responsive to these signals.

Stimulating the body by administering an artificial version of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH, the hypothalamic hormone) can differentiate between constitutional delay of puberty and a GnRH deficiency in boys, although no studies have been done in girls to prove this. It is often sufficient to simply measure the baseline gonadotrophin levels to differentiate between the two.

In girls with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, a serum prolactin level is measured to identify if they have the pituitary tumor prolactinoma. High levels of prolactin would warrant further testing with MRI imaging, except if drugs inducing the production of prolactin can be identified. If the child has any neurological symptoms, it is highly recommended that the physician obtains a head MRI to detect possible brain lesions.

In girls with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, a karyotype can identify chromosomal abnormalities, the most common of which is Turner syndrome. In boys, a karyotype is indicated if the child may have a congenital gonadal defect such as Klinefelter syndrome. In children with a normal karyotype, defects in the synthesis of the adrenal steroid sex hormones can be identified by measuring 17-hydroxylase, an important enzyme involved in the production of sex hormones.

==Management==
The goals of short-term hormone therapy are to induce the beginning of sexual development and induce a growth spurt, but it should be limited to children with severe distress or anxiety secondary to their delayed puberty. Bone age must be monitored frequently to prevent precocious closure of the bone plates, thereby stunting growth.

=== Constitutional and physiologic delay ===
If a child is healthy with a constitutional delay of growth and puberty, reassurance and prediction based on the bone age can be provided. No other intervention is usually necessary, but repeat evaluation by measuring serum testosterone or estrogen is recommended. Furthermore, the diagnosis of hypogonadism can be excluded once the adolescent has started puberty by age 16–18.

Boys over 14 years of age whose growth is severely stunted or are experiencing severe distress secondary to their lack of puberty can be started on testosterone to increase their height. Testosterone treatment can also be used to stimulate sexual development, but it can close bone plates prematurely stopping growth altogether if not carefully administered. Another therapeutic option is the use of aromatase inhibitors to inhibit the conversion of androgens to estrogens as estrogens are responsible for stopping bone growth plate development and thus growth. However, due to side effects, therapy with testosterone alone is most often used. Overall, neither growth hormone nor aromatase inhibitors are recommended for constitutional delay to increase growth.

Girls can be started on estrogen with the same goals as their male counterparts.

Overall, studies have shown no significant difference in final adult height between adolescents treated with sex steroids and those who were only observed with no treatment.

=== Malnutrition or chronic disease ===
If the delay is due to systemic disease or malnutrition, the therapeutic intervention is likely to focus direction on those conditions. In patients with coeliac disease, an early diagnosis and the establishment of a gluten-free diet prevents long-term complications and allows restoration of normal maturation. Thyroid hormone therapy will be necessary in the case of hypothyroidism.

=== Primary failure of the ovaries or testes (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism) ===
Whereas children with constitutional delay will have normal levels of sex hormones post-puberty, gonadotropin deficiency or hypogonadism may require lifelong sex steroid replacement.

In girls with primary ovarian failure, estrogen should be started when puberty is supposed to start. Progestins are usually added after there is acceptable breast development, about 12 to 24 months after starting estrogen, as starting treatment with progestin too early can negatively affect breast growth. After acceptable breast growth, administering estrogen and progestin in a cyclical manner can help establish regular menses once puberty is started. The goal is to complete sexual maturation over 2 to 3 years. Once sexual maturation has been achieved, a trial period with no hormonal therapy can determine whether or not the child will require life-long treatment. Girls with congenital GnRH deficiency require enough sex hormone supplementation to maintain body levels in the expected pubertal levels necessary to induce ovulation, especially when fertility is a concern.

Males with primary failure of the testes will be on lifelong testosterone.

Pulsatile GnRH, weekly multi-LH, or hCG and FSH can be used to induce fertility in adulthood for both males and females.

=== Genetic or acquired defect of the hormonal pathway of puberty (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) ===
Boys aged &gt;12 years old with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism are most often treated with short-term testosterone while males with testicular failure will be on life-long testosterone. Choice of formulation (topical vs injection) is dependent on the child&#x27;s and family&#x27;s preference as well as on how well they tolerate side effects. Although testosterone therapy alone will result in the start of puberty, to increase fertility potential, they may need pulsatile GnRH or hCG with rFSH. hCG can be used by itself in boys with spontaneous onset of puberty from non-permanent forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and rFSH can be added in cases of low sperm count after 6 to 12 months of treatment.

If puberty has not started after 1 year of treatment, then permanent hypogonadotropic hypogonadism should be considered.

Girls with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism are started on the same sex steroid therapy as their counterparts with a constitutional delay, however doses are gradually increased to reach full adult replacement levels. Dosage of estrogen is titrated based on the woman&#x27;s ability to have withdrawal bleeds and to maintain appropriate bone density. Induction of fertility must also be done through pulsatile GnRH.

=== Others ===
Growth hormone is another option that has been described, however it should only be used in proven growth hormone deficiency such as idiopathic short stature. Children with a constitutional delay have not been shown to benefit from growth hormone therapy. Although serum growth hormone levels are low in constitutional delay of puberty, they increase after treatment with sex hormones and in those cases, growth hormone is not suggested to accelerate growth.

Subnormal vitamin A intake is one of the etiological factors in delayed pubertal maturation. Supplementation of both vitamin A and iron to normal constitutionally delayed children with subnormal vitamin A intake is as efficacious as hormonal therapy in the induction of growth and puberty.

More therapies are being developed to target the more discreet modulators of the HPG axis including kisspeptin and neurokinin B.

In cases of severe delayed puberty secondary to hypogonadism, evaluation by a psychologist or psychiatrist, as well as counseling and a supportive environment are an important supplemental therapy for the child. Transition from pediatric to adult care is also vital as many children are lost during transition of care.

== Outlook ==
Constitutional delay of growth and puberty is a variation of normal development with no long-term health consequences, however it can have lasting psychological effects. Adolescent boys with delayed puberty have a higher level of anxiety and depression relative to their peers. Children with delayed puberty also display decreased academic performance in their adolescent education, but changes in academic achievement in adulthood have not been determined.

There is conflicting evidence as to whether or not children with constitutional growth and pubertal delay reach their full height potential. The conventional teaching is that these children catch up on their growth during the pubertal growth spurt and just remain shorter before their delayed puberty starts. However, some studies show that these children fall short of their target height from about 4 to 11 cm. Factors that could affect final height include familial short stature and pre-pubertal growth development.

Pubertal delay can also affect bone mass and subsequent development of osteoporosis. Men with delayed puberty often have low to normal bone mineral density unaffected by androgen therapy. Women are more likely to have lower bone mineral density and thus an increased risk of fractures as early as even before the onset of puberty.

Furthermore, delayed puberty is correlated with a higher risk in cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in women only, but also appears to be protective for breast and endometrial in women and testicular cancer in men.

<doc id="651379" wikidata="Q1165352" url="?curid=651379" title="Shōchū">
<text>is a Japanese distilled beverage. It is typically distilled from rice, barley, sweet potatoes, buckwheat, or brown sugar, though it is sometimes produced from other ingredients such as chestnut, sesame seeds, potatoes, or even carrots.

Typically shōchū contains 25% alcohol by volume, which is weaker than baijiu, whiskey, or vodka, but stronger than huangjiu, sake, or wine. It is not uncommon for multiply distilled shōchū, which is more likely to be used in mixed drinks, to contain up to 35% alcohol by volume.

==Etymology==
The word is the Japanese rendition of the Chinese &quot;shaojiu&quot; (), meaning &quot;burned liquor&quot;, which refers to the heating process during distillation. The Chinese way of writing &quot;shaojiu&quot; with the character means sake in modern Japanese, which writes &quot;shōchū&quot; using the character instead. Nevertheless, both characters mean &quot;liquor&quot;.

==Culture==

===Drinking===
&quot;Shōchū&quot; should not be confused with sake, a brewed rice wine. Its taste is usually far less fruity and depends strongly on the nature of the starch used in the distilling process. Its flavor is often described as &quot;nutty&quot; or &quot;earthy&quot;. 

&quot;Shōchū&quot; is drunk in many ways according to season or personal taste:

* neat, i.e., on its own with nothing added
* on the rocks, i.e., mixed with ice, known as &quot;rokku&quot; in Japanese
* diluted with room temperature water (水割り &quot;mizuwari&quot;) or hot water (お湯割り &quot;oyuwari&quot;),
* mixed with oolong tea or fruit juice
* as &quot;chūhai&quot; (&quot;shōchū&quot; highball), a mixed drink consisting of &quot;shōchū&quot;, soda water, ice and some flavoring, often lemon, grapefruit, apple or &quot;ume&quot; (East Asian plum)
* mixed very cold with a beer-flavored mixer known as Hoppy

&quot;Shōchū&quot; is widely available in supermarkets, liquor stores, and convenience stores in Japan while canned chuhai drinks are sold in some of Japan&#x27;s ubiquitous vending machines. However, it is more difficult to find &quot;shōchū&quot; outside Japan except in urban areas with large enough Japanese populations. Interest in shōchū has begun to grow in North America, particularly in cosmopolitan cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vancouver, Toronto, and New York. Dedicated shōchū bars have begun to appear in New York and more than 100 brands are now available in the U.S. market.

In Kyūshū, the center of production, &quot;shōchū&quot; is far more common than &quot;sake&quot;. Indeed, there &quot;sake&quot; (酒) generally refers to &quot;shōchū&quot;, and is sometimes consumed mixed with hot water (Oyuwari), especially in cooler months. First hot water is poured into the glass, then shōchū is gently added. The liquids mix naturally and stirring is unnecessary. Typically, when serving a standard 25% ABV shōchū oyuwari, the amount of shōchū exceeds the amount of hot water and is enjoyed for its aroma. Occasionally, &quot;shōchū&quot; and water are mixed, left to stand for a day, and then gently heated. This traditional pre-dilution technique is known as maewari in Japan.

===Boom===
The early 21st century witnessed a consumer boom in shōchū within Japan, and in 2003 domestic shipments surpassed those of sake for the first time.
Shōchū bars appeared serving shōchū exclusively, and premium brands with a focus on particular ingredients, production methods, or aging techniques entered the market. The beverage has undergone a change of image; formerly it was seen as an old fashioned drink, but now has become trendy amongst young drinkers, particularly women. The boom also had negative effects: It caused a serious shortage of sweet potatoes, a basic ingredient of some popular types of shōchū and, with the emergence of expensive premium brands, pricing scams appeared.

In 2005 the Japanese television drama &quot;Kiken na Aneki&quot; illustrated this change in drinking habits. Its plot centered on the Minagawa family of Miyazaki Prefecture, who were brewers of a sweet potato shōchū called imojōchū. The lead character Hiroko (Ito Misaki) spends the majority of the series trying to come up with enough money to save the distillery from loan sharks, but in the process becomes involved with corporate distilleries. The larger companies formulate an advertising campaign that results in the imojōchū becoming a popular drink. In this fictional account, the beverage is marketed to young women when it previously had been mostly consumed by the older male generation.

There are several reasons for shōchū&#x27;s recent popularity. With increasing health-consciousness, many people see it as healthier than some alternatives. There have been well-publicized claims of medical benefits, including that it can be effective in preventing thrombosis, heart attacks, and diabetes. It is also a versatile drink that is suited to most styles of cuisine.

Shigechiyo Izumi, a Japanese citizen who apparently lived to be 120 (though the claim is disputed), made shōchū part of his daily dietary regimen. This practice was mentioned along with his record in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. Because of his intimate passion for shōchū, many have speculated that shōchū is healthy and can actually promote longevity. This even prompted some local Ryūkyū shōchū brewers to market a special Longevity Liquor (長寿の酒) shōchū bearing his name on the front label. Despite these claims, Izumi&#x27;s personal physician strongly advised against drinking shōchū, as his kidneys were not strong enough to process shōchū in his advanced age. But Izumi went on to say: &quot;Without shōchū there would be no pleasure in life. I would rather die than give up drinking.&quot;

==History==
Shōchū production has been historically attested to since the 16th century. When the missionary Francis Xavier visited Kagoshima Prefecture in 1549, he recorded that &quot;the Japanese drink arak is made from rice [...] but I have not seen a single drunkard. That is because once inebriated they immediately lie down and go to sleep.&quot;

The oldest existing direct reference to shōchū in Japan can be found at Kōriyama Hachiman shrine in Ōkuchi, Kagoshima. There, two carpenters working on the shrine in 1559 inscribed the following graffiti on a wooden plank in the roof: &quot;The high priest was so stingy he never once gave us shōchū to drink. What a nuisance!&quot;

From these early times through to the Edo period shōchū was produced throughout Japan in the traditional kasutori way, using single pot distillation. During the Meiji period, the column still was introduced to Japan from Great Britain, making affordable mass production of high-purity multiply distilled shōchū possible during a time of chronic rice shortages. Shōchū made the traditional way was called &quot;old-style shōchū&quot; and that produced using the new multiple-distillation machinery &quot;new-style shōchū.&quot;

In the early 20th century, Hajime Katahira (1884–1936), Minosuke Kurose (1882–1967), and Tsunekichi Kurose (1885–1925) in Kasasa Village in Kagoshima Prefecture established the Kurose Toji Guild. Through their experience in both Okinawan Awamori and sake production, these men revolutionized traditional shochu production through the introduction of black koji (&quot;A. awamori&quot;) and multi-stage fermentation. Prior to this multistage fermentation process, shochu was made in the donburi style with both koji inoculated grains and the main ingredients added to a single fermentation. Today, almost all authentic shochu is made with a multi-stage fermentation. At its peak, the Kurose Koji Guild boasted more than 500 members who would travel throughout Japan to produce shochu from local agricultural ingredients.
Tamaki Inui (1873–1946), a lecturer at University of Tokyo, succeeded in the first isolating and culturing &quot;aspergillus&quot; such as &quot;A. kawachii&quot;, &quot;A. awamori&quot; and a variety of subtaxa of &quot;A. oryzae&quot;. His contemporary, Genichirō Kawachi (1883–1948), who is said to be the father of modern &quot;shōchu&quot; with his development of the Kawachi Drum koji machine as well as the isolation of white koji, also known as &quot;A. kawachii&quot;, which is named after him. These discoveries results in great progress in producing high quality &quot;shochu&quot; in Japan, but the Kawachi Drum machine and other innovations led to the eventual demise of the Kurose Toji Guild, which today has just a handful of active members, but primarily continues to live on in a museum in Kasasa Village. &quot;Aspergillus&quot; developed by Kawachi has also been used for &quot;soju&quot; and &quot;makgeolli&quot; in Korea.

==Definition and classification==
Japan&#x27;s alcohol taxation law, as revised in April 2006, defines two categories of shōchū
(also called &quot;white liquor&quot;).

===Multiply distilled shōchū===
Alcohol distilled more than once with special machinery for that purpose, diluted for sale to an alcohol by volume level of less than 36%, that meets the following conditions:

# Fruit or grain that has been allowed to germinate is not used as a base ingredient in whole or in part (preventing brandy and malt whisky from being considered shōchū).
# It is not filtered through charcoal.
# If sugar is used as a base ingredient, in whole or in part, then the result of distillation must be at least 95% alcohol by volume (see discussion under brown sugar shōchū).
# It is not fortified at distillation time with other than expressly permitted ingredients (eliminates liqueurs).

Until the 2006 revision the law referred to this category as , sometimes abbreviated to &quot;kōshu&quot; (甲焼). &quot;Kōrui&quot; (Class A) in the classification of shōchū simply means classification and does not mean that the quality is superior to that of &quot;Otsurui&quot; (Class B).

It is generally distilled from a fermented liquid similar to molasses. Repeated distillation forms ethyl alcohol of high purity which is typically odorless and has a taste of little distinction. Water is then added, and the precise nature of this water has subtle effects on the taste and palatability of the shōchū.

Kōrui shōchū is made from sweet potato, potato, and corn.
It is generally produced in modern large factories. Distillers make Kōrui shōchū by weakening the distilled alcohol.

The specialized distillation equipment, called a patent still lends it to mass production at low cost, so large corporations produce this kind of shōchū in high volume. In Japan, it retails in plastic bottles, cans, and paper cup form and is consumed as a cheap alcoholic drink. It forms the base of several cocktails and liqueurs such as chūhai and umeshu.

===Singly distilled shōchū===
Alcohol distilled using other than multiple-distillation machinery, with alcohol by volume of no more than 45%, from one of the following:

# ferment whose primary ingredient is grain or potato and their &quot;kōji&quot;
# ferment whose primary ingredient is grain kōji
# ferment whose primary ingredient is sake lees, possibly with rice and/or its kōji (see kasutori shōchū)
# ferment whose primary ingredient is sugar (restricted types) and rice kōji (see brown sugar shōchū)
# ferment whose primary ingredient is grain or potato and their kōji along with other ingredients, provided the other ingredients form no more than 50% by weight
# other substances with certain restrictions

Until the 2006 revision the law referred to this category as , sometimes abbreviated to &quot;otsushu&quot; (乙焼). &quot;Otsurui&quot; (Class B) in the classification of shōchū simply means classification and does not mean that the quality is inferior to that of &quot;Kōrui&quot; (Class A).

The equipment used for single distillation is called a pot still. As the shōchū is distilled just once it retains the character of the base ingredient, typically rice, barley, or sweet potato, with a strong taste and aroma. Small-to-medium size enterprises make most brands, with the island of Kyūshū famous as the center of production. Recently however larger corporations have been entering the market.

====Maturation====
Shōchū is shipped after maturation. Maturation techniques vary in storage vessel and location, both of which affect the character of the shōchū. The most commonly used containers for aging shōchū are stainless steel tanks, clay pots, and wooden barrels or casks.

As a result of maturation, the flavor, and aroma of shōchū settle. Maturation generally takes between one and three months. Maturation from three to six months is called &quot;beginning maturation&quot;. During this period, sharp flavors in the shōchū generally decrease. Shōchū matured from six months to three years usually has a mellow taste.

A shōchū called &quot;long-term maturation&quot; is matured for more than three years. But long-term maturation does not always improve the flavor. On the other hand, long-term maturation is particularly effective for &quot;awamori&quot;. Distillers sometimes mature &quot;awamori&quot; for longer than ten years.

=====Locations=====
Shōchū is matured in various places to impart unique flavors, typically where there are minimal variations in temperature and humidity.
These places include tunnels and limestone caverns.

====Honkaku shōchū====
Until 2006 Japanese postwar tax law classified shōchū into &quot;kōrui&quot; and &quot;otsurui&quot; types. The terms and are Chinese celestial stems typically used for classification, and mean something akin to &quot;Grade A&quot; and &quot;Grade B&quot; respectively.

Fearing a tendency to believe that otsurui shōchū is somehow inferior to kōrui shōchū, the Kyūshū Otsurui Shochu Producers&#x27; Association lobbied the Finance Ministry, and in 1962 succeeded in having , or authentic shōchū, recognized as an alternative name. The name is believed to have been coined in 1957 by Junkichi Enatsu, the president of Kirishima Brewery of Miyakonojō, Miyazaki Prefecture.

However, since the term was not formally defined naming disputes arose. As a result, on 1 November 2002, the law was clarified and shōchū satisfying any of conditions 1 to 5 of the above definition of singly distilled shōchū can be called honkaku shōchū. Those satisfying the final condition are excluded.

===Shōchū consumption in Japan by categories===
2016 Shōchū consumption in Japan by categories (tax base) is as follows;

==Moromitori shōchū==
Most singly distilled shōchū is moromitori shōchū (もろみ取焼酎). This name derives from its production process:

# Raw material treatment. Usually, rice or barley is steeped in water, then steamed to promote starch gelatinization and cooled.
# Kōji production. &quot;kōjikin&quot;, or koji mold spores, are cultivated onto the material to form koji mold which creates enzymes as it grows. The enzymes break starch molecules down into sugar molecules that can be fermented, a process called &quot;saccharification&quot;.
# Primary fermentation. The koji is mashed by adding both water and yeast and is fermented for seven to nine days in a tank or vat to form unrefined alcohol, called moto or (first stage) moromi.
# Secondary fermentation. The steamed main ingredient and water are added to the unrefined alcohol and fermented again to form (second stage) moromi. The ingredient added during this second stage determines the variety of shōchū; for example, if sweet potato is added then it becomes sweet potato shōchū.
# Distillation. Purification of the unrefined moromi alcohol.

===Kōji===
 mold, a kind of &quot;Aspergillus&quot; fungus, has a profound effect on the final taste of the shōchū. There are three varieties of kōji mold with distinct characteristics.
* Yellow &quot;kōji&quot; (&quot;A. oryzae&quot;). Used to produce sake, and at one time all honkaku shōchū. However yellow kōji is extremely sensitive to temperature; its &quot;moromi&quot; can easily sour during fermentation. This makes it difficult to use in warmer regions such as Kyūshū, and gradually black and white kōji became more common. Its strength is that it gives rise to a rich, fruity refreshing taste, so despite the difficulties and great skill required it is still used by some manufacturers. It is popular amongst young people and those who previously had no interest in typically strong sweet potato shōchū, playing a role in its recent revival. Thus, white and black &quot;kōji&quot; are mainly used in the production of &quot;shōchū&quot;, but only yellow &quot;kōji&quot; (&quot;A. oryzae&quot;) is usually used in the production of &quot;sake&quot;.
* White &quot;kōji&quot; (&quot;A. kawachii&quot;). Discovered as a mutation from black &quot;kōji&quot; by Genichirō Kawachi in 1918. This effect was researched and white kōji was successfully grown independently. White kōji is easy to cultivate and its enzymes promote rapid saccharization; as a result, it is used to produce most shōchū today. It gives rise to a drink with a refreshing, gentle, sweet taste.
* Black &quot;kōji&quot; (&quot;A. luchuensis&quot;) . Mainly used to produce &quot;shōchū&quot; and &quot;awamori&quot;. In 1901, Tamaki Inui of the University of Tokyo succeeded in the first isolating and culturing. In 1910, Genichirō Kawachi succeeded for the first time in culturing var. kawachi, a variety of subtaxa of &quot;A. awamori&quot;. This improved the efficiency of shochu production. It produces plenty of citric acid, which helps to prevent the souring of the moromi. Of all three kōji it most effectively extracts the taste and character of the base ingredients, giving its shōchū a rich aroma with a slightly sweet, mellow taste. Its spores disperse easily, covering production facilities and workers&#x27; clothes in a layer of black. Such issues led to it falling out of favor, but due to the development of New Kuro-&quot;kōji&quot; (NK-&quot;kōji&quot;) in the mid-1980s, interest in black kōji resurged amongst honkaku shōchū makers because of the depth and quality of the taste it produced. Several popular brands now explicitly state they use black kōji on their labels.

===Water===
Water is one of the most important ingredients for making shōchū. The quality of water affects that of shōchū directly. Various kinds of water are used in the process of making shōchū.

===Varieties===
There is a broad variety of moromitori shōchū. Four locations have achieved protection as geographical indications under World Trade Organization TRIPS article 23 and are noted below.

====Rice shōchū====
 shares its base ingredient with sake. It has a fairly thick taste, and appears to have originally developed in regions too warm for sake production.

Kumamoto Prefecture is particularly well known for its production of rice shōchū. Notably produced in Hitoyoshi-bonchi is protected as a geographical indication.

Rice shōchū is also produced in regions famous for their sake, such as Niigata and Akita prefectures.

====Barley shōchū====
 is generally less distinctive than rice shōchū and easy to drink. However, if cask-aged the taste can be quite sharp and strongly reminiscent of single-malt whisky.

Ōita Prefecture, Miyazaki Prefecture, and Iki in Nagasaki Prefecture are strong production hubs. has also been given protection as a geographical indication.

====Sweet potato shōchū====
 uses sweet potato, widely cultivated across southern Kyūshū since the Edo period, as its base ingredient. Originally it was almost exclusively produced in Kagoshima and Miyazaki prefectures, but nowadays is made across Japan using locally grown sweet potatoes.

It tends to have a strong taste and a distinctive smell; more recently producers have made varieties whose aroma is somewhat suppressed.

Kagoshima&#x27;s has been given protection under WTO rules as a geographical indication.

The 1956 film &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot; portrayed an American-occupied Okinawan village rebuilding its economy with sweet potato shōchū.

The taste of sweet potato shōchū is a bit smoky, evocative of some whiskeys.

====Brown sugar shōchū====

From the Edo period through to the time of the Pacific War, the Amami Islands produced drinks such as &quot;awamori&quot; and a distilled alcohol based on brown sugar. From the middle of the war through to the American occupation, because of a shortage of rice (the base ingredient of awamori) and an inability to export the sugar-based alcohol to the mainland, a large surplus was produced. In 1953, when the Amami Islands were returned to Japanese sovereignty, the alcohol was not classified as &quot;shōchū&quot; under the 1949 alcohol tax law and therefore would attract a high rate of tax. The Ministry of Finance, taking into account the desire of local residents and as part of a strategy to promote the region, gave special recognition to the local alcohol as . This recognition was geographically restricted to the Amami Islands of Kagoshima Prefecture and was conditional on the use of rice kōji. This regional restriction remains in place to this day; as can be seen in the legal definition of singly distilled shōchū above.

Typically, brown sugar shōchū contains 30% or 25% alcohol by volume. Contrary to what might be expected, brown sugar shōchū has a mild and not particularly sweet taste, as it contains no sugar. Nowadays it is produced in 25 breweries in 5 islands: Kikaijima, Amami Ōshima, Tokunoshima, Okinoerabujima and Yoronjima. Awamori, however, is no longer made outside Okinawa Prefecture.

Before the war, another alcoholic drink based on brown sugar was made in the Ogasawara Islands. Its name translates as &quot;sugar alcohol&quot; and could be seen as a form of brown sugar shōchū. Production ceased because of the war, but recently, aiming to revive its popularity, similar alcohol, using no rice kōji, has been introduced. However, as Ogasawara does not qualify for the above special regional exemption, this alcohol is instead classified as rum or spirits.

====Soba shōchū====
Soba, or buckwheat, has origins going back to just 1973 when Unkai Brewery Co., of Gokase, Miyazaki Prefecture, developed it using soba from the local mountainous region as its base ingredient. Since then shōchū producers across Japan have produced it, sometimes as part of a shōchū blend.

The taste is milder than barley shōchū.

====Awamori====


Okinawa is the home of , which uses rice as its base ingredient. Prior to April 1983, it was labeled otsurui shōchū, but is now properly called &quot;Authentic Awamori&quot;.

Awamori is made from Thai long-grained &quot;indica&quot; crushed rice, not the usual short-grained &quot;japonica&quot; of standard shōchū. The fermentation process employs black koji mold indigenous to Okinawa rather than the standard white variety, and secondary fermentation is not performed.
Fermentation is done in a way that creates plenty of citric acid, allowing it to be produced all year round despite Okinawa&#x27;s hot climate. After distillation its strength is reduced with water to about 25% alcohol by volume, although some varieties go as high as 65%.

Japanese law classifies awamori as a singly distilled honkaku shōchū despite the different production processes.

With its method of production, awamori could theoretically be made anywhere in Japan, but Ryūkyū Awamori (琉球泡盛) is a protected geographical indication restricted to Okinawa.

====Others====
Japanese law admits a very wide range of unusual base ingredients, such as perilla leaf, sesame and chestnut, and shōchū made from most if not all of these exists. For example, there is a milk shōchū brand called &quot;Makiba-no Yume&quot;. Others are generic shōchū mixed with a particular fruit juice or extracts.

With its peculiarity, such shōchū is typically intended to catch the eye of visitors to a region and has attracted limited broader appeal. Soba shōchū is a good example of one that has managed to achieve more widespread success.

==Kasutori shōchū==
In contrast to moromitori shōchū, is made by distilling the sake lees leftover from the fermentation of sake. It is a form of honkaku shōchū.

It first became popular in the north of Kyūshū, and then spread to other areas, being manufactured during a period when it was not possible to brew refined sake across Japan. It is also widely used in sake production to stop fermentation before it is complete, which can help prevent degradation or give a dry taste. Shōchū made for this purpose is called .

During the Edo period shōchū lees were used as a fertilizer during the rice-planting season. Many farms, therefore, installed distillation equipment to distill sake lees to produce shōchū lees. Whilst the lees were used in the fields, the distilled alcohol was drunk, or offered to the gods, at the festival held at the end of the rice-planting season to pray for a bountiful harvest. Kasutori shōchū has therefore also come to be known as sanaburi shōchū.

Owing to the recent surge in popularity of shōchū in Japan, an increasing number of manufacturers have been making kasutori shōchū.

Most kasutori shōchū is made in modern ways, shōchū made via older production processes has decreased sharply. People who wish to preserve Japanese culture call shōchū produced the historical way , such drinks have been revitalized by their activities.

===Slang usage===
Confusingly kasutori is also a slang term for a separate, inferior form of shōchū. After the Pacific War, in a chaotic society with a shortage of good alcohol, moonshine shōchū began to circulate. Its source and ingredients were not apparent, and in extreme cases contained toxic methyl alcohol diluted with water. Such shōchū with ill side-effects became known as &quot;kasutori&quot;, and the association with poor shōchū lingered, sometimes even affecting the image of &quot;real&quot; respectable kasutori shōchū.

The expressions &quot;kasutori literature&quot; and &quot;kasutori culture&quot; also came to be associated with the upheavals of the postwar period.

==Blended shōchū==
Singly distilled and multiply distilled shōchū can be mixed to form . Formerly it was often mislabeled &quot;honkaku shōchū&quot;, or had no indication of mixing or relative volumes. Starting in 2005 the industry regulated itself and created the blended shōchū mark, with subcategorization based upon the relative volumes used.

Singly distilled shōchū makes up 50%–95% of the total volume of &quot;singly distilled blended shōchū&quot;. This category is targeted at those viewing pure singly distilled shōchū as having too strong a smell or taste, aiming to be softer and more easily drinkable.

In &quot;multiply distilled blended shōchū&quot; singly distilled shōchū makes up 5%–50% of the total volume. With a focus on price, this tries to combine the cheap mass-production benefits of multiply distilled shōchū whilst introducing some of the distinctive flavor and aroma of the singly distilled form.

<doc id="651387" wikidata="Q211746" url="?curid=651387" title="Book of Baruch">
<text>The Book of Baruch is a deuterocanonical book of the Bible, used in many Christian traditions, such as Catholic and Orthodox churches. In Judaism and Protestant Christianity, it is considered not to be part of the canon, with the Protestant Bibles categorizing it as part of the Biblical apocrypha. The book is named after Baruch ben Neriah, the prophet Jeremiah&#x27;s scribe who is mentioned at Baruch 1:1, and has been presumed to be the author of the whole work. The book is a reflection of a late Jewish writer on the circumstances of Jewish exiles from Babylon, with meditations on the theology and history of Israel, discussions of wisdom, and a direct address to residents of Jerusalem and the Diaspora. Some scholars propose that it was written during or shortly after the period of the Maccabees.

The Book of Baruch is sometimes referred to as 1 Baruch to distinguish it from 2 Baruch, 3 Baruch and 4 Baruch.

Although the earliest known manuscripts of Baruch are in Greek, linguistic features of the first parts of Baruch (1:1–3:8) have been proposed as indicating a translation from a Semitic language.

Although not in the Hebrew Bible, it is found in the Septuagint, and also in Theodotion&#x27;s Greek version. It is considered to be a canonical book of the Old Testament by the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Oriental Orthodox Churches. In 80-book Protestant Bibles, the Book of Baruch is a part of the Biblical apocrypha. Jerome, despite his misgivings about the deuterocanonical books, included Baruch into his Vulgate translation. In the Vulgate it is grouped with the books of the prophets alongside Jeremiah and Lamentations. In the Vulgate, the King James Bible Apocrypha, and many other versions, the Letter of Jeremiah is appended to the Book of Baruch as a sixth chapter; in the Septuagint and Orthodox Bibles chapter 6 is usually counted as a separate book, called the Letter or Epistle of Jeremiah.

== Basic structure ==
The basic outline of the book of Baruch:
*1:1–14 Introduction: &quot;And these are the words...which Baruch...wrote in Babylonia... And when they heard it they wept, and fasted, and prayed before the Lord.&quot;
* 1:15–2:10 Confession of sins: &quot;[T]he Lord hath watched over us for evil, and hath brought it upon us: for the Lord is just in all his works... And we have not hearkened to his voice&quot;...
* 2:11–3:8 Prayer for mercy: &quot;[F]or the dead that are in hell, whose spirit is taken away from their bowels, shall not give glory and justice to the Lord...&quot; (cf. Psalms 6:6/5)
* 3:9–4:14 A paean for Wisdom: &quot;Where are the princes of the nations... that hoard up silver and gold, wherein men trust? ... They are cut off, and are gone down to hell...&quot;
* 4:5–5:9 Baruch&#x27;s Poem of Consolation: messages for those in captivity, for the &quot;neighbours of Zion&quot;, and for Jerusalem: &quot;You have been sold to the Gentiles, not for your destruction: but because you provoked God to wrath... [F]or the sins of my children, he [the Eternal] hath brought a nation upon them from afar...who have neither reverenced the ancient, nor pitied children...&quot; &quot;Let no one gloat over me [Jerusalem], a widow, bereft of many, for the sins of my children I am left desolate, for they turned from the law of God&quot;. &quot;Look toward the east, O Jerusalem, and see the joy that is coming to you from God&quot;.
* Chapter 6: see &quot;Letter of Jeremiah&quot;

== Early evidence of use ==
No reference to the Book of Baruch is found in Rabbinic literature, nor is its text cited. A fragment of the Letter of Jeremiah in Greek has been excavated amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls, but no counterpart fragments survive of the Book of Baruch. It is generally argued that there are no references to, quotations from, or allusions to the Book of Baruch in the New Testament, although Adams proposes a general similarity between themes in the later parts of the book and some in the Pauline Epistles, particularly Galatians and 1 Corinthians. The earliest evidence for the text of the Book of Baruch is in quotations in the works of early Christian Church Fathers; the earliest citation being in the &quot;Legatio pro Christianis: 9&quot; of Athenagoras of Athens, dated 177. Much the most extensive use of the Book of Baruch in patristic literature is in the &quot;Adversus Haereses: 5.35.1&quot; (c. 180) of Irenaeus of Lyons; which draws extensively on Baruch 4:36 to 5:9. Both Athenagorus and Irenaeus cite these readings as being from the Book of Jeremiah. A brief quotation appears also in the Paedagogus by Clement of Alexandria. Increasingly from the 4th century onwards, however, Greek Fathers tend to cite such readings as from a &#x27;Book of Baruch&#x27;, although Latin Fathers consistently maintain the former practice of citing these texts as from Jeremiah, and where they do refer to a &#x27;Book of Baruch&#x27; are to be understood as denoting the apocalyptic work, 2 Baruch.

== Manuscripts ==
Both the Book of Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah are separate books in the great pandect Greek Bibles, Codex Vaticanus (4th century) and Codex Alexandrinus (5th century), where they are found in the order Jeremiah, Baruch, Lamentations, Letter of Jeremiah. In the Codex Sinaiticus (4th century) Lamentations follows directly after Jeremiah and Baruch is not found; but a lacuna after Lamentations prevents a definitive assessment of whether Baruch may have been included elsewhere in this manuscript. Neither of the two surviving early Latin pandect Bibles (Codex Amiatinus (7th century) and Leon palimpsest (7th century) includes either the Book of Baruch or the Letter of Jeremiah; the earliest Latin witnesses to the text being the Codex Cavensis (9th century) and the Theodulfian Bibles (9th century). Baruch is also witnessed in some early Coptic (Bohairic and Sahidic) and Syriac manuscripts, but is not found in Coptic or Syriac lectionaries.

== Authorship and date ==
Baruch 1:1–14 gives a narrative account of an occasion when Baruch ben Neriah reads the book of &#x27;these words&#x27; before the Israelites in Babylon, and then sends that book (together with collected funds) to be read in Jerusalem. Where the Book of Baruch is considered to be a distinct work of scripture, it is commonly identified as the book that Baruch reads; and hence Baruch himself has traditionally been credited as the author of the whole work. However, the syntactical form of Baruch chapter 1 has been held rather to imply that &#x27;these words&#x27; correspond to a preceding text – which might then be identified with Lamentations or with the Book of Jeremiah; in which case comparison may be made with a corresponding notice of Baruch writing down reading the prophecies of Jeremiah, recorded at Jeremiah chapter 36. These considerations underlie an alternative tradition (found for instance in Augustine) in which all four works (Book of Jeremiah, Baruch, Lamentations, Letter of Jeremiah) are credited to Jeremiah himself as author.

Critical scholarship is, however, united in rejecting either Baruch or Jeremiah as author of the Book of Baruch, or in dating the work in the period of its purported context; the Babylonian Exile. Rather they have seen clear thematic and linguistic parallels with later works; the Book of Daniel and the Book of Sirach. Many scholars have noted that the restoration of worship in the Jerusalem Temple following its pollution by Antiochus Epiphanes could provide a counterpart historical context in which the narrative of Baruch may equally be considered to apply; and consequently a date in the period 200–100 BCE has been proposed.

== Language ==

The Latin, Syriac, Coptic, Armenian, Arabic, Bohairic and Ethiopic versions of Baruch are all translated directly from the Greek; the text of which survives in Vaticanus and Alexandrinus, and is highly consistent. Jerome (5th century) states that no Hebrew text was in existence, and Origen (3rd century) appears to know of no Hebrew text in the preparation of the text of Baruch in the Hexapla Old Testament. Nevertheless, there are a number of readings in the earlier sections of Baruch (1:1 to 3:8) where an anomalous reading in the Greek appears to imply a mistranslation of a Hebrew or Aramaic source; as at chapter 3:4, where &#x27;hear now the prayers of the dead of Israel&#x27; (מֵתֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל) is assumed to be a mistranslation of, &#x27;hear now the prayers of the men of Israel&#x27; (מְתֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל, from the plural word מְתִים &#x27;men&#x27; as in biblical expressions like מְתֵי אָהֳלִי &#x27;men of my tent&#x27;, מְתֵי שָׁוְא &#x27;men of vanity&#x27; or מְתֵי מִסְפָּר &#x27;men of few [numbers]&#x27;). Since the 19th century, critical scholars have assumed a Semitic original for these earlier parts of the book, and a number of studies, such as that of Tov, have sought to retrovert from the Greek to a plausible Hebrew source text. Whereas in the Revised Standard Version (1957) of Bible, the English text of Baruch consistently follows the Greek in these readings; in the New Revised Standard Version (1989) these readings are adjusted to conform with a conjectural reconstruction of a supposed Hebrew original.

Nevertheless, some more recent studies of Baruch, such as those by Adams and Bogaert, take the Greek text to be the original. Adams maintains that most of the text of Baruch depends on that of other books of the Bible; and indeed it has been characterised by Tov as a &quot;mosaic of Biblical passages&quot; especially in these early sections. Consequently, variations from the literal Hebrew text could have found their way directly into a dependent Greek version, without having to presume a Semitic intermediary stage. Moreover, Adams takes issue with the presupposition behind conjectural retroversions to conform to a supposed Hebrew text; that the author of Baruch understood the principle of literal translation, and aspired to follow that principle; and yet lamentably failed to do so.

== Canonicity ==

In the Greek East, Athanasius (367 AD), Cyril of Jerusalem (), and Epiphanius of Salamis () listed the Book of Baruch as canonical. Athanasius states &quot;Jeremiah with Baruch, Lamentations, and the epistle&quot;; the other Fathers offer similar formulations.

Baruch is mentioned by the Synod of Laodicea (c. 364); where a list of canonical books is variously appended to canon 59, in which &quot;Jeremiah, and Baruch, the Lamentations, and the Epistle&quot; are stated as canonical. This list is found in compendiums of the decrees of Laodicea circulating in the Ethiopic church, and in all later Greek compendiums; but is absent from counterpart compendiums of Laodicea circulating in the Latin, Coptic and Syriac churches; as too from some earlier Greek compendiums. In the decrees of the Council of Florence (1442) and the Council of Trent (1546), &quot;Jeremias with Baruch&quot; is stated as canonical.

Pope Innocent I (405 AD), the Council of Rome (382 AD), the Synod of Hippo (in 393), followed by the Council of Carthage (397) and the Council of Carthage (419) mention Jeremiah as a canonical book without mentioning Baruch, but it is commonly accepted that the absence of specific mention of Baruch in canon lists circulating in the West cannot be interpreted as an assertion that the Book of Baruch was non-canonical only that it is being assumed within Jeremiah. Most of the Church Fathers considered Jeremiah as a single book, along with Baruch, Lamentations and the Epistle.

Augustine of Hippo () in his work &quot;The City of God&quot; 18:33 he discusses the text of Baruch 3: 36–38, noting that this is variously cited to Baruch and to Jeremiah; his preference being for the latter. Jerome did not consider the Book of Baruch as a canonical book, but he included it in his Vulgate. 

There was also an extensive body of pseudepigraphal &quot;Baruch&quot; apocalyptic literature ( 2 Baruch, 3 Baruch, 4 Baruch), which are frequently classed in Latin lists as apocryphal.

== Book of Baruch and Book of Jeremiah ==
The evident variation among early Christian divines as to whether a particular reading is to be cited from &#x27;Baruch&#x27; or &#x27;Jeremiah&#x27; is generally regarded as relating to the very different texts of the Book of Jeremiah that are found respectively in manuscripts of the Greek and Hebrew Bibles. The version of Jeremiah in the Greek Septuagint texts (Vaticanus, Alexandrinus) is a seventh shorter than that in the Hebrew Masoretic Text or the Latin Vulgate; and the ordering of the chapters is very different, with sections from the middle of the book in the Septuagint version (the Oracles against the Nations) found at the end of the book in the Masoretic text and Vulgate. As Hebrew fragments have been found in the Dead Sea Scrolls corresponding to both the Septuagint and Masoretic orders, it is commonly accepted that the two versions derive from two distinct Hebrew traditions, and that the Septuagint form of the text is likely the older. Benedictine scholar Pierre-Maurice Bogaert suggests that, if the Book of Baruch is appended to the Septuagint version of Jeremiah, it follows on as a plausible continuation of the Septuagint narrative (Chapter 51: 31–35 in the Septuagint, corresponding to the truncated Chapter 45 in the Masoretic text). A similar conclusion is proposed by Emanuel Tov, who notes characteristics of a consistent redactional revision of the Septuagint text of Jeremiah from Chapter 29 onwards (correcting readings towards the Hebrew), a revision that is then carried over into the Greek text of Baruch 1:1 to 3:8, suggesting that these once formed a continuous text. Bogaert consequently proposes that the gathering of sections from the end of Septuagint Jeremiah into a distinct book of &#x27;Baruch&#x27; was an innovation of Christian biblical practice in the Greek church from around the 3rd century onwards; but that the version of Jeremiah in the Old Latin Bible preceded this practice, and hence did not designate the Book of Baruch as a distinct work of scripture, but included its text within the Book of Jeremiah. The text of Old Latin Jeremiah nowhere survives in sufficient form for this speculation to be confirmed, but Bogaert proposes that its characteristics may be recognised in the texts of Baruch in the early Theodulfian Vulgate Bibles; noting that Baruch in these manuscripts is continuous with Jeremiah, and that the end at Chapter 5:9 is marked by an &quot;&quot; in Old Latin form, stating &quot;Explicit hieremiae prophetae&quot;.

== Liturgical use ==

=== Western ===
====Catholic usage====
In the Catholic Church, Baruch 3:9–38 is used in the liturgy of Holy Saturday during Passiontide in the traditional lectionary of scripture readings at Mass. A similar selection occurs during the revised liturgy for the Easter Vigil.

Baruch 1:14 – 2:5; 3:1–8 is a liturgical reading within the revised Roman Catholic Breviary for the 29th Week in Ordinary Time, Friday Office of Readings. The subject is &quot;the prayer and confession of sin of a penitent people&quot;:

Justice is with the Lord, our God; and we today are flushed with shame, we men of Judah and citizens of Jerusalem, that we, with our kings and rulers and priests and prophets, and with our fathers, have sinned in the Lord&#x27;s sight and disobeyed him. ... And the Lord fulfilled the warning he had uttered against us... Lord Almighty, ... Hear... and have mercy on us, who have sinned against you... (Baruch 1:15–18; 2:1; 3:1–2)

Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s reflection, which is paired with this reading, on this occasion speaks of prayer: &quot;[S]ince this [that we pray for] is that peace that surpasses all understanding, even when we ask for it in prayer we do not know how to pray for what is right...&quot;; from there he explains what it means that the Holy Spirit pleads for the saints.

Baruch 3:9–15, 24–4:4 is a liturgical reading for the Saturday of the same week. The theme is that &quot;the salvation of Israel is founded on wisdom&quot;: &quot;Learn where prudence is, ... that you may know also where are length of days, and life, where light of the eyes, and peace. Who has found the place of wisdom, who has entered into her treasuries? ... She is the book of the precepts of God, ... All who cling to her will live... Turn, O Jacob, and receive her: ... Give not your glory to another, your privileges to an alien race.&quot; Paired with this on the same day is a reading from Peter Chrysologus, died AD 450, who quotes Paul the Apostle: &quot;let us also wear the likeness of the man of heaven&quot;.

Baruch 5:1-9 is read on the second Sunday of Advent in Year C of the three-yearly lectionary cycle.

====Lutheran usage====
The Book of Baruch is part of the intertestamental Apocrypha section of the Bible in the Lutheran Churches. Scripture readings from the Apocrypha are included in the lectionaries of the Lutheran Churches.

====Anglican usage====
Baruch is listed in Article VI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England. In the Daily Office Lectionary for Christmas Eve, Baruch 4:21–29 is read; on Christmas day, Baruch 4:30–5:9; both of these are considered Messianic Prophecies in the Anglican tradition.

In the American 1928 Book of Common Prayer, the Daily Office lectionary includes the Book of Baruch for the First Lesson on several occasions: Baruch 4:21–30 on the Second Sunday after Easter; Baruch 3:14–15, 29–37 for the 21st Sunday after Trinity; and Baruch 5 for the 22nd Sunday after Trinity. In the American Book of Common Prayer (1979) Baruch 5:1–9 is the Old Testament reading for Advent II (Year C); and in the Daily Office (Year 2) Baruch 4:21–29 is prescribed for Advent IV, and Baruch 4:36–5:9 for Dec. 24.

=== Eastern ===

In the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, a selection from Baruch (which is considered an extension of the Book of Jeremiah, and is announced in the services as &quot;Jeremiah&quot;) is read as one of the eight &quot;Paroemia&quot; (Old Testament readings) during the Vesperal Divine Liturgy on Christmas Eve.

== Use by theologians, Church Fathers, the Second Vatican Council ==

In &quot;Summa Theologiae&quot; III 4 4, Doctor of the Church Thomas Aquinas quotes Baruch 3:37 (3:38 in Vulgate) to affirm that &quot;the Son of God assumed human nature in order to show Himself in men&#x27;s sight, according to Baruch 3:38: Afterwards He was seen upon earth, and conversed with men. This statement, more properly rendered as Afterward he appeared on earth and lived with humankind. is part of his discussion of &quot;the mode of union on the part of the human nature&quot; III 4. He quotes the same passage of Baruch in III 40 1 to help answer &quot;whether Christ should have associated with men, or led a solitary life&quot; III 40. By switching the gender of the pronoun, this reading, which properly is discussing Divine Wisdom was widely re-interpreted in Christian discourse as a prophecy of the incarnation of Jesus Christ.
Church Father Clement of Alexandria, d. AD 217, quoted Baruch 3:16–19, referring to the passage thus: &quot;Divine Scripture, addressing itself to those who love themselves and to the boastful, somewhere says most excellently: &#x27;Where are the princes of the nations...&#x27;&quot; (see &quot;Paean for Wisdom&quot; example &quot;infra&quot;) (Jurgens §410a).

Hilary of Poitiers, d. AD 368, also a Church Father, quoted the same passage as Thomas, &quot;supra&quot;, (3:36–38), citing &quot;Jeremias&quot;, about which Jurgens states: &quot;Baruch was secretary to Jeremias, and is cited by the Fathers mostly under the name of Jeremias&quot; (§864n). Hilary states: &quot;Besides Moses and Isaias, listen now a third time, and to Jeremias, who teaches the same thing, when He says:...&quot; (Jurgens §864).

Baruch 3:38(37) is referenced in the Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation of the Second Vatican Council.

== Use in the current Catechism of the Catholic Church ==

Baruch 6 is quoted in the Catechism of the Catholic Church as part of an exposition against idolatry. During the Diaspora the Jews lamented their lapse into idolatry, and their repentance is captured in the Book of Baruch.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;The Book of Baruch by the Gnostic Justin&quot; is a sequence of 270 poems by the English poet Geoffrey Hill, published posthumously by Oxford University Press in 2019.

<text>Jeparit ( ) is a town on the Wimmera River in Western Victoria, Australia, north west of Melbourne. At the 2016 census Jeparit had a population of 342, down from 394 five years earlier.

==History==
The area around Jeparit is originally home to the Gromiluk Aboriginal peoples prior to European settlement. The name Jeparit is believed to be derived from a Gromiluk word meaning &quot;home of small birds&quot;. European settlement began in the 1880s when German Lutheran immigrants began to settle and grow wheat.

The town was surveyed in 1883 and gazetted in 1889, the post office opening on 31 August 1889 though known as Lake Hindmarsh until December 1889. Two earlier post offices called Lake Hindmarsh had existed in the area at various times since 1861 to serve a smaller population of graziers.

Jeparit&#x27;s most famous resident is former Australian Prime Minister and founder of the Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies, who was born in the town in 1894. He is commemorated with a spire and a memorial bust installed at the town square. The spire, topped with an ornament resembling a Scottish Thistle, is inscribed:

==Sport==
With neighbouring townships Rainbow, Hopetoun, and Beulah, Jeparit has a football and netball club, the Southern Mallee Thunder, competing in the Wimmera Football Netball League.

Golfers play at the course of the Jeparit Golf Club on Nhill Road.

Jeparit is the setting for Peter Carey&#x27;s 1985 novel &quot;Illywhacker&quot;.

<doc id="651396" wikidata="Q4129937" url="?curid=651396" title="Sexton (office)">
<text>A sexton is an officer of a church, congregation, or synagogue charged with the maintenance of its buildings and/or an associated graveyard. In smaller places of worship, this office is often combined with that of verger. Larger establishments, such as cathedrals, may employ a team of sextons.

Historically in North America and the United Kingdom the &quot;sexton&quot; was sometimes a minor municipal official responsible for overseeing the town graveyard. In the United Kingdom the position still exists today, related to management of the community&#x27;s graveyard, with such sextons usually employed by the town/parish or community council.

== Origin of the name ==
The words &quot;sexton&quot; and &quot;sacristan&quot; both derive from the Medieval Latin word &quot;sacristanus&quot; meaning &quot;custodian of sacred objects&quot;. &quot;Sexton&quot; represents the popular development of the word via the Old French &quot;Segrestein&quot;.

== Duties ==
Among the traditional duties of the sexton in small parishes was the digging of graves—the gravedigger in &quot;Hamlet&quot; refers to himself as sexton, for example. In modern times, grave digging and maintenance of the cemetery is usually done by an outside contractor. The general duties of a modern sexton may include:

* Operation and maintenance of mechanical systems, such as: refrigerators, boilers, HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) units, hot water systems, kitchen equipment, electrical system, and piping systems (i.e., gas, water, fire protection, and sewer systems).
* Liaison with any routine contract maintenance and supply companies (regarding: large maintenance projects, fire protection equipment, pest control, kitchen and worship materials, etc.)
* Ordering and receiving supplies and equipment.
* Stocking supplies (paper towels, toilet paper, soap, etc.)
* Tasks involving security (locking doors, operating security system, etc.), and safety (emergency light/exit sign testing, first aid kit maintenance, etc.).
* Logistics for regular services and events on church calendar (chairs and tables, decorating, lighting, acoustics, audio and video, etc.).
* Emergency response during bad weather.
* Small building repairs (painting, drywall/plaster work, replacing ceiling tiles, etc.).
* Maintaining the grounds (grass mowing, hedge/shrub trimming and tree pruning, weed control, watering plants, snow removal, fall clean up, and other landscaping work).
* Regular cleaning (vacuuming, dusting, sweeping, mopping, etc.)
* Other maintenance tasks not handled by a contract service or church volunteers, such as: the replacement of light bulbs, returning premises to a neat and orderly state following services and events, disposal of trash (rubbish), running any local errands or trips that are needed by the church, and other miscellaneous tasks.
* Following building code.
* Report to supervisors (about tasks completion, mishaps, etc.).

In many UK churches nowadays, where neither a sexton nor a verger is employed, these duties are likely to fall to the churchwardens.

<text>An undulator is an insertion device from high-energy physics and usually part of a larger
installation, a synchrotron storage ring, or it may be a component of a free electron laser. It consists of a periodic structure of dipole magnets. These can be permanent magnets or superconducting magnets. The static magnetic field alternates along the length of the undulator with a wavelength formula_1. Electrons traversing the periodic magnet structure are forced to undergo oscillations and thus to radiate energy. The radiation produced in an undulator is very intense and concentrated in narrow energy bands in the spectrum. It is also collimated on the orbit plane of the electrons. This radiation is guided through beamlines for experiments in various scientific areas.

The undulator strength parameter is:
:formula_2,

where &quot;e&quot; is the electron charge, &quot;B&quot; is the magnetic field, &quot;formula_1&quot; is the spatial period of the undulator magnets, &quot;formula_4&quot; is the electron rest mass, and &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light.

This parameter characterizes the nature of the electron motion. For formula_5 the oscillation amplitude of the motion is small and the transverse deflection nearly sinusoidal as a function of time, so that long undulators can have narrow on-axis bandwidth, and most of the radiated power at around the fundamental wavelength. For formula_6 the oscillation amplitude is large and the transverse deflection is no longer sinusoidal in time so that it contains Fourier components of high harmonics of the fundamental wavelength. This kind of device naturally has a much larger bandwidth and is typically called a wiggler.

Away from the axis of the undulator, the radiation spectrum is broadened by the angle dependent Doppler effect, so to observe the naturally narrow bandwidth, one has to use a small aperture to select only the central radiation cone.

For a device with formula_7 periods and a small enough aperture, the brightness of an undulator scales like formula_8 while the brightness of a wiggler only scales like formula_7. The difference is due to the naturally narrower bandwidth of the undulator. Since the radiation emitted from an undulator is incoherent, the power scales linearly with the number of electrons. In a Free-electron laser, some coherence is achieved and the power can scale with a higher power of the number of electrons.

The polarization of the emitted radiation can be controlled by using permanent magnets to induce different periodic electron trajectories through the undulator. If the oscillations are confined to a plane the radiation will be linearly polarized. If the oscillation trajectory is helical, the radiation will be circularly polarized, with the handedness determined by the helix.

An undulator&#x27;s figure of merit is spectral radiance.

==History==
The Russian physicist Vitaly Ginzburg showed theoretically that undulators could be built in a 1947 paper. Julian Schwinger published a useful paper in 1949 that reduced the necessary calculations to Bessel functions, for which there were tables. This was significant for solving the design equations as digital computers were not available to most academics at that time.

Hans Motz and his coworkers at Stanford University demonstrated the first undulator in 1952. It produced the first manmade coherent infrared radiation. The design could produce a total frequency range from visible light down to millimeter waves.

<text>Cota tinctoria, the golden marguerite, yellow chamomile, or oxeye chamomile, is a species of perennial flowering plant in the sunflower family. Other common names include dyer&#x27;s chamomile, Boston daisy, and Paris daisy. In horticulture this plant is still widely referred to by its synonym Anthemis tinctoria.

It is a short-lived plant often treated as biennial, native to Europe, the Mediterranean and Western Asia and naturalized in scattered locations in North America. It has aromatic, bright green, feathery foliage. The serrate leaves are bi-pinnatifid (= finely divided) and downy beneath. It grows to a height of .

It has yellow daisy-like terminal flower heads on long thin angular stems, blooming in profusion during the summer.

It has no culinary or commercial uses and only limited medicinal uses. However, it produces excellent yellow, buff and golden-orange dyes, used in the past for fabrics.

&quot;Cota tinctoria&quot; is grown in gardens for its bright attractive flowers and fine lacy foliage; there is a white-flowering form. Under the synonym &quot;Anthemis tinctoria&quot;, the cultivar &#x27;E.C. Buxton&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. The popular seed-raised cultivar &#x27;Kelwayi&#x27; has 5 cm wide, yellow flowers on 65 cm plants.

The species hybridizes with &quot;Tripleurospermum inodorum&quot; to form the hybrid × &quot;Tripleurocota sulfurea&quot;.

<text>Glauber de Andrade Rocha (; 14 March 1939 – 22 August 1981) was a Brazilian film director, actor and screenwriter. He was one of the most influential moviemakers of Brazilian cinema and a key figure of Cinema Novo. His films &quot;Black God, White Devil&quot; and &quot;Entranced Earth&quot; are often considered to be two of the greatest achievements in Brazilian cinematic history, being selected by Abraccine as, respectively, the second and fifth best Brazilian films of all-time. Rocha also the distinction of having the most films on Abraccine&#x27;s list: 5 films.

Rocha&#x27;s film possess a staunch avant-garde and experimental nature, making of him a seminal figure of the new wave. His works are noted for their many political overtones, often addressing the passive-aggressive situation of the Third World, which Rocha referred to both metaphorically and objectively as &quot;hunger&quot; in his essay &quot;Estética da Fome&quot; (&quot;The Aesthetics of Hunger&quot;). Rocha won the Prix de la mise en scène at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival for &quot;Antonio das Mortes&quot; and the 1977 Special Jury Prize for Best Short Film for &quot;Di&quot;. Three of Rocha&#x27;s films were nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or, including &quot;Entranced Earth&quot;, which was awarded the FIPRESCI at the 1967 Cannes Film Festival and the Grand Prix of the Locarno Film Festival of the same year.

==Biography==

Rocha was born in Vitória da Conquista, Bahia, Brazil, and moved with his family to Salvador when he was only nine years old, there studying in a well-known Presbyterian school.

During his adolescence, he developed great interest in arts, especially theatre and cinema, and even joined a drama group. He was also very active in politics, a trait that would be strongly influential in his works. A member of the Brazilian radical left, he helped start a political party in the late 1950s that called for an anti-capitalist people&#x27;s revolution and, among other things, advocated the abolition of money.

By the age of 16, he started freelancing for a local newspaper and debuted as a movie reviewer. Later, he attended Law School for about two years and in 1959, after taking part in some projects as assistant, he finally directed his first Short film, &quot;Pátio&quot;. After gaining some recognition in Bahia for his critical and artistic work, Rocha decided to quit college and pursue a journalistic career, as well as being a film-maker.

He is famous for his film trilogy, made up of &quot;Black God, White Devil&quot; (1964) – perhaps his most acclaimed movie, nominated for the Golden Palm - &quot;Entranced Earth&quot; (1967) and &quot;Antonio das Mortes&quot; (1969), award-winning for Best Director at Cannes. His films were renowned for their strongly-expressed political themes, often combined with mysticism and folklore, but also for their particular style and photography. Rocha is regarded as one of the best Brazilian directors of all time and leader of the Cinema Novo movement, as well as a full-time polemicist. He once said, &quot;I am the Cinema Novo,&quot; paraphrasing Louis XIV&#x27;s famous quote. In an interview with &quot;Le Monde&quot;, Rocha said: &quot;My Brazilian films belong to a whole period when my generation was full of wild dreams and hopes. They are full of enthusiasm, faith and militancy and were inspired by my great love of Brazil.&quot;

In 1969, he was a member of the jury at the 6th Moscow International Film Festival. In the following year, Rocha made a brief appearance in the Dziga Vertov Group film &quot;Wind from the East&quot;. After refusing an invitation by Jean-Luc Godard to shoot a segment of the film, Rocha appeared as a man in a crossway pointing the direction of the political cinema, namely, the Cinema Novo.

In 1971, during the Brazilian military dictatorship, he left the country to a voluntary exile, dwelling in many places, such as Spain, Chile, and France, eventually relocating to the Portuguese Riviera, with the help of his friend, Portuguese filmmaker Manuel Carvalheiro. He never completely returned home until his last days, when he was transferred from Lisbon, where he had been receiving medical treatment for a lung infection, to Rio de Janeiro. Rocha resisted in hospital for few days, but ultimately died on August 22, 1981, at the age of 42. He had been married three times and had five children. His daughter Ava is a singer-songwriter.

<text>Belconnen () is a district in the Australian Capital Territory in Australia. The district is subdivided into 27 divisions (suburbs), sections and blocks. As at the , the district had a population of people; and was the most populous district within the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).

Belconnen is situated approximately to the north-west of the central business district of Canberra, and surrounds an artificially created, ornamental lake, Lake Ginninderra. Lake Ginninderra was made possible by building a dam at an elbow of Ginninderra Creek. Exiting the lake, via a simple overflow, Ginninderra Creek continues, and runs north-west to its confluence with the Murrumbidgee River just beyond the north-western ACT border.

== Transport ==
The primary mode of transport within the District is by private vehicle. The District of Belconnen was planned in the 1960s and was guided by a philosophy of reliance on private personal transport and an abundance of roads. Public buses serve the district with local and express services; the primary interchange is off Benjamin Way in the town centre.

=== Roads ===
Belconnen is well served by a network of near-freeway-quality roads located between suburbs and intersecting the district. The main roads between suburbs are typically landscaped with mounds of earth and vegetation to form &#x27;parkways&#x27;.

The main roads connecting the district with North Canberra and the city centre are Belconnen Way and Ginninderra Drive. These roads are 6 lane parkways for the majority of their length and run in an east–west direction. Belconnen is situated south of the Barton Highway which leads to Yass, where it connects with the Hume Highway to Sydney and Melbourne. To the south of the district is William Hovell Drive which connects the southern and western suburbs of Belconnen with Parkes Way and the Tuggeranong Parkway which lead to the city centre and Canberra&#x27;s southern districts respectively.

=== Public transport ===
The ACTION bus service which provides public transport throughout Canberra is the only form of regularly scheduled public transport in Belconnen. Services from the various suburbs generally pass through a bus interchange at Belconnen Town Centre from where they continue to Civic and the other town centres to Canberra&#x27;s south. Some services travel to Gungahlin. There are also express services which connect directly with Tuggeranong.

The bus interchange is spread across the Belconnen town centre in three different locations. The previous interchange, which is now one of those locations, was connected by footbridge to large shopping centre and to office buildings occupied by major Government departments. It was an ageing facility which was criticised for being unsafe, particularly at night, and for being dirty and prone to vandalism. For these reasons it was subject to major renovations.

The ACT Government plans to construct a busway to connect the Belconnen Town centre with the hospital and CIT precinct in Bruce and the city centre.

===Cycling===
The Belconnen Bikeway goes through the district.

<text>Consulting by faculty members is the use of scholarly expertise for the benefit of organizations outside the scholarly community through friendship, volunteering or in return for some sort of compensation.

== Overview ==
Universities have widely varying policies on faculty consulting, generally limiting the proportion of a faculty member&#x27;s time, which may be spent on consulting, and instituting rules to avoid conflicts of interest.

Consulting is distinguished from activities, which are scholarly or creative, from public service, and from outside activities which are unrelated to the area of scholarly expertise. For instance, a professor of history who designs sailboats on the side is not considered to be consulting, although a professor of engineering might be.

<text>The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) is a multiple choice test, administered by the United States Military Entrance Processing Command, used to determine qualification for enlistment in the United States Armed Forces. It is often offered to U.S. high school students when they are in the 10th, 11th and 12th grade, though anyone eligible for enlistment may take it.

== History ==
The ASVAB was first introduced in 1968 and was adopted by all branches of the military in 1976. It underwent a major revision in 2002. In 2004, the test&#x27;s percentile rank scoring system was renormalized, to ensure that a score of 50% really did represent doing better than exactly 50% of the test takers.

== Categories ==

=== Format ===
The ASVAB contains nine sections and takes three hours to complete. The duration of each section varies between 7 and 39 minutes, the longest being for Arithmetic Reasoning. The test is typically administered in a computerized format at Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) or in a written format at satellite locations called Military Entrance Test (MET) sites. Testing procedures vary depending on the mode of administration.

==== Computerized test format ====
* General Science (GS) – 15 questions in 8 minutes
* Arithmetic Reasoning (AR) – 15 questions in 39 minutes
* Word Knowledge (WK) – 15 questions in 8 minutes
* Paragraph Comprehension (PC) – 10 questions in 22 minutes
* Mathematics Knowledge (MK) – 15 questions in 20 minutes
* Electronics Information (EI) – 15 questions in 8 minutes
* Automotive and Shop Information (AS) – 10 questions in 7 minutes
* Mechanical Comprehension (MC) – 15 questions in 20 minutes
* Assembling Objects (AO) – 15 questions in 40 minutes
* Verbal Expression (VE) Score = (WK)+(PC)

==== Written test format ====
* General Science (GS) – 45 questions in 20 minutes
* Arithmetic Reasoning (AR) – 30 questions in 36 minutes
* Word Knowledge (WK) – 35 questions in 11 minutes
* Paragraph Comprehension (PC) – 15 questions in 13 minutes
* Mathematics Knowledge (MK) – 25 questions in 24 minutes
* Electronics Information (EI) – 20 questions in 9 minutes
* Automotive and Shop Information (AS) – 25 questions in 11 minutes
* Mechanical Comprehension (MC) – 25 questions in 19 minutes
* Assembling Objects (AO) – 25 questions in 15 minutes
* Verbal Expression (VE) Score = (WK)+(PC)

Navy applicants also complete a Coding Speed (CS) test.

== Armed Forces Qualification Test ==
An &quot;Armed Forces Qualification Test&quot; (AFQT) score is used to determine basic qualifications for enlistment.

The AFQT scores are divided into the following categories

* Category I: 93–99
* Category II: 65–92
* Category III A: 50–64
* Category III B: 31–49
* Category IV A: 21–30
* Category IV B: 16–20
* Category IV C: 10–15
* Category V: 0–9

- The formula for computing an AFQT score is: AR + MK + (2 × VE).

- The VE (verbal) score is determined by adding the raw scores from the PC and WK tests and using a table to get the VE score from that combined PC and WK raw score.

- AFQT scores are not raw scores, but rather percentile scores indicating how each examinee performed compared with the base youth population. For example, if someone receives an AFQT score of 55 that means they scored higher than 55 percent of all other members of the base youth population. The highest possible percentile score is 99.

- The minimum score for enlistment varies according to branch of service and whether the enlistee has a high school diploma.

GED holders who have earned 15 college credits in courses at the 100 level or higher are considered equivalent to those holding high school diplomas, so they need only the Tier I score to enlist. However, eligibility is not determined by the score alone. Depending on current recruitment goals an applicant may be required to achieve a higher score than the required minimum AFQT score in order to be considered for enlistment. Up-to-date information about eligibility requirements can be obtained from local recruiting centers.

Applicants in Category V are legally ineligible for enlistment. Applicants in Category IV must be high school diploma holders (unless they are needed to satisfy “established strength” requirements). The law limits the percentage of accessions who can fall between Categories IV and V (currently, the limit is 20% of all persons originally enlisted in a given armed force in a given fiscal year).

== Composite scores ==
In addition to the ASVAB&#x27;s AFQT, each branch has military occupational specialty, or MOS, scores. Combinations of scores from the nine tests are used to determine qualification for a MOS. These combinations are called &quot;aptitude area scores&quot;, &quot;composite scores&quot;, or &quot;line scores&quot;. Each of the five armed services has its own aptitude area scores and sets its own minimum composite scores for each MOS.

<doc id="651424" wikidata="Q7215753" url="?curid=651424" title="Serratula tinctoria">
<text>Serratula tinctoria, commonly known as dyer&#x27;s plumeless saw-wort or saw-wort, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.

==Description==

Saw-wort is a spineless hairless perennial herb with wiry branched erect grooved stems. It usually grows 20 – 80 cm tall. The long hairless leaves measure 12 – 20 cm long and have finely bristle-toothed edges. The leaves, which are arranged alternately along the stem, vary in shape and dimensions, ranging from undivided and lanceolate to deeply pinnatifid with narrow lobes. Only the lower leaves are stalked

The stalked thistle-like flowerheads are 1.5 – 2 cm long and arranged in loose leafy inflorescences. The 5-lobed florets are reddish purple, the involucre is narrow oblong. The purplish bracts are appressed to the stem, being oval and pointed and not spiny. The achenes have a simple feathery yellowish pappus.

==Etymology and taxonomy==

The specific epithet &quot;tinctoria&quot; is derived from a Latin word meaning &quot;used for dyeing or staining&quot;. This name refers to its source of yellow dye that was previously used until the 19th century.

Chromosome number has been confirmed as 2n = 22.

==Ecology and habitat==

&quot;S. tinctoria&quot; grows in various soil types overlying a range of rock types but is almost always confined to semi-natural vegetation in habitats with low levels of soil fertility and disturbance. It typically favours moist soils with full sun to partial shade, growing in grasslands, mires, open woodland, and scrub as well as their ecotones.

==Distribution==

The species is found throughout much of England and Wales but is very rare in Scotland. It was first recorded from Ireland in New Ross, County Wexford in 1925, but has not been seen there since 1952. The European range extends as far north as southern Sweden and Norway, but the plant is absent from much of the Boreal Zone (northern Poland, Russia, Fennoscandia, and the Baltic States) and the lowland Mediterranean.

&quot;S. tinctoria&quot; has declined in Britain since at least the 19th century, primarily through a combination of drainage, ploughing and agricultural improvement as well as lack of management by cutting and grazing in grassland.

This is an introduced plant in a small area of the north-eastern United States.

== Uses ==
The leaves of &quot;Serratula tinctoria&quot; are the source of a yellow dye. As a herbal preparation, the plant was thought to mend ruptures and wounds.

<text>Cyril Raker Endfield (November 10, 1914 – April 16, 1995) was an American film director, who at times also worked as a writer, theatre director, and inventor. Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he worked in the New York theatre in the late 1930s before moving to Hollywood in 1940. 

After World War II, his film career was interrupted by the Hollywood blacklist. He resettled in London at the end of 1951. He is particularly known for &quot;The Sound of Fury&quot; (1950), &quot;Hell Drivers&quot; (1957) and &quot;Zulu&quot; (1964).

==Early life and career==
Cyril Endfield was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania on November 10, 1914, the first of three children. His parents were first generation Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe; his father ran a fur business. A bright boy, Cyril developed an early interest both in chess and sleight-of-hand card magic, publishing a routine in a magicians’ magazine at the age of 16. In 1932 he won a scholarship to Yale, but delayed his arrival by a year because of the collapse of his father’s business during the Depression. While in Scranton, he first met Israel Shapiro (Paul Jarrico), a politically conscious screenwriter-to-be who would become a life-long friend.[i]

In his two years at Yale, Endfield’s attitude to his studies was ‘rather lackadaisical’ (his own description in a letter to Jarrico), although he read widely, and developed an extra-curricular interest in new science fiction.[ii] Much of his time in New Haven was devoted to the intertwined worlds of theatre and radical politics: he joined the local Unity Theatre and was an active member of the Young Communist League. Rather than graduate, Endfield left Yale in early 1936, moving to New York and taking classes at the leftist New Theatre League, supporting himself by taking acting jobs and contributing magic acts to new theatre movement revues. 

At age 23 he joined the League as a teacher, before spending a year directing an amateur theatre group in Montreal, where he met writers and playwrights including – briefly – Clifford Odets. It was also here that he married actress Fanny Shurack (stage name Osborne). 

In 1940, with a baby due, the couple moved to Hollywood, and Endfield looked for work in the studios. His first assignment, a short-lived engagement with Orson Welles’s Mercury Theatre unit at RKO, followed a random meeting with Welles at a Los Angeles magic shop. During this period, Endfield was one of the few people to view the original, uncut version of Welles’s &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1942). Eventually he secured a position with the short subject department at MGM. But his first film, &quot;Inflation&quot; (1943), a well-regarded propaganda short approved by the Office of War Information, was quickly withdrawn from distribution following criticism from the Chamber of Commerce.[iii] The United States&#x27; entry into World War II had made studios very sensitive to criticism.

Endfield remained at MGM until he was called up to a year of military service at Camp Crowder, in Missouri. After the war he returned to the studio, before writing and directing several low budget Joe Palooka features (based on the comic strip) for Monogram. What he later called his first ‘auteur effort,’  &quot;The Argyle Secrets&quot; (1948), was made after nine days of shooting, from his own short¹ radio play for the CBS Suspense series. Endfield’s career revived in 1950, with the release of two well-received crime features, &quot;The Underworld Story&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Fury&quot; (&quot;Try and Get Me!&quot;).

== Politics and exile ==
In 1951 Endfield found his career derailed as a result of hearings by the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Screenwriter Martin Berkeley named him in September 1951 as known to have been involved with left wing political associations (at the New Theatre League in New York in the late 1930s, and in Hollywood in 1943). Endfield was called to testify and, while he was reluctant to plead the Fifth Amendment before the Committee, he found the option of ‘naming names’, so as to clear himself for further Hollywood film work, to be unacceptable. He made a hurried settlement with his wife, with whom he had separated, and sailed for England on the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; in December 1951. He slowly re-established his filmmaking career in London. 

He later commented:
:&quot;The political enthusiasms attributed to me were already years and years dead, but the sole option of informing [was] still repellent. My enjoyable career and its attendant affluence conducted in the unmatchable ambience of as-yet-unpolluted Los Angeles was &quot;kaput!&quot; And I, physically storm-tossed, a ‘boat-person,’ albeit as a passenger on the Queen Mary on a one-way transatlantic trip.&quot;[i]

Endfield was 37 when he began his new life in the UK, and it was a struggle to get work both in theatre and film. The British security services took a close interest, and for a time there was a real possibility of him being sent back to the United States. His FBI and Home Office files reveal something of this struggle. Only slowly, as he found film work (and some work in the theatre), did the Board of Trade become more sympathetic, recognising the value to the country (as it slowly emerged from austerity) of the employment and dollar investment that the filmmaker began to attract.[ii]

Endfield was one of a number of American filmmakers with left-wing associations who moved to Europe in the early fifties because of the blacklist (notably Joseph Losey, John Berry, Jules Dassin, and Carl Foreman).[iii] His stay in the UK was gradually extended, and he made a series of low budget films. His association with the producer Benjamin Fisz led to two better funded productions, &quot;Hell Drivers&quot; (1957) and &quot;Sea Fury&quot; (1958), for Britain’s largest production company, the Rank Organisation; both featured Stanley Baker, who was to appear in six of his films. Endfield was eventually issued with a new passport and in 1957 he was given permission to remain permanently in the UK, having remarried in March 1956, to the model, Mo Forshaw.[iv]

Yet Endfield’s career remained something of a struggle, and the blacklist still prevented him being considered for international productions, with American finance. It was in 1960, when he was offered the direction of &quot;Mysterious Island&quot;by Columbia Pictures, that he decided that he needed to clear himself by appearing before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in Washington. Endfield had written to the Committee in August 1958, but it was in March 1960 that he reluctantly made the flight to Washington D.C. to appear before the Committee. He there admitted his associations with the Communist Party, and of distancing himself from the Party after the war, such that some left-wing friends saw him as a renegade. At this late stage, with the blacklist beginning to collapse, all of those named were already blacklisted. Yet some of his fellow American exiles were not impressed by his action, which allowed him to direct &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; (1961), at a time when he and Stanley Baker were working to try and set up an ambitious production of &quot;Zulu&quot; on location in South Africa.[v]

== Endfield&#x27;s film work ==
The short period from 1949 to 1951 was one in which Endfield’s profile was on the rise. He directed &quot;The Underworld Story&quot; (1950), a crime story with social overtones (with Dan Duryea, Herbert Marshall and Howard da Silva), that was made for a subsidiary of Monogram Pictures. He followed this up with &quot;The Sound of Fury&quot; (1950), for the independent company Robert Stillman Productions (distributed by United Artists), at the end of the year. He described both films as ‘nervous A’ pictures, meaning that they had a budget of around $500,000. Their cost was beyond that of a B-picture, but still well short of that of ‘A’ pictures. This was a step up for directors such as Endfield, and followed in the tradition of the successful pictures associated with rising producer Stanley Kramer in the late forties, notably &quot;Champion&quot; (1949) and &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; (1949). Both the 1950 films, and particularly the second, came to be seen as film noirs, to use the term then being applied by critics to a series of American crime films that were released in France after the war.[i]

The success of &quot;The Underworld Story&quot; led to the effort by new producer Robert Stillman to set up &quot;The Sound of Fury&quot; (&quot;Try and Get Me!&quot;), based on a 1947 novel by Jo Pagano that dealt with a notorious kidnapping and lynching case of 1933. The events, in San Jose, had already loosely inspired Fritz Lang’s &quot;Fury&quot; (1935), with Spencer Tracy. Endfield put heart and soul into the project, which was filmed on location in Phoenix, Arizona, and which starred Lloyd Bridges, Frank Lovejoy, Katherine Ryan and Art Smith. There were disagreements over the script, but the story was a powerful one of a decent, family man (Lovejoy) whose desperation for work leads to an ill-fated, criminal alliance with a psychopath (Bridges). The climax, in which a mob invades a prison where the two criminals are being kept, had a particularly strong impact on critics.

Endfield arranged a private showing of &quot;The Sound of Fury&quot; for friends and associates. In the audience was the actor Joseph Cotten, who Endfield had got to know well at the Welles unit at RKO. The director recalled Cotten’s comment after the showing: ‘Cy, we’ve both grown up in the same country, but I’m telling you, the America you know is not the America that I know.’[ii] To the director this reaction indicated how such a film could be viewed in the febrile atmosphere of the Cold War. The critic Manny Farber also saw the film in these terms, describing it as ‘an ominous snarl at American life.’ Endfield talked to theatre managers who reported that some patrons had complained that the film was ‘un-American’, at a time when Americans were fighting and dying in Korea.[iii]

Early in his time in London Endfield worked without credit for the American producer Hannah Weinstein, directing three pilot episodes for a television series called &quot;Colonel March Investigates&quot;, with Boris Karloff. His other films were directed anonymously, with another director – Charles de la Tour – often being credited, and being paid to stand by on set. This partly reflected then rules of the film industry union, the Association of Cinematograph Technicians (ACT), as well as the reluctance of American distributors to handle films that carried the names of those blacklisted. Such films included &quot;The Limping Man&quot; (1953) and &quot;Impulse&quot; (1955), while for &quot;The Master Plan&quot; (1955) Endfield was credited as Hugh Raker. The director’s credit for &quot;The Secret&quot; (1955), and &quot;Child in the House&quot; (1956) was C. Raker Endfield, although the latter film still saw la Tour standing by. There are some resonances of the blacklist experience in &quot;The Secret&quot; (with Sam Wanamaker) and in &quot;Child of the House&quot;, the first of Endfield’s films with Stanley Baker.

&quot;Hell Drivers&quot; (1957) was a breakthrough in terms of scale and ambition; it was successful in the UK and has attained a cult reputation. The subject, from a short story by John Kruse, concerned the trucking industry, and the short-haul transport of ballast, by a private company that stokes the ultra-competitive behaviour of its drivers. A publicity still of the time described it as a ‘drama of men who battle for their livelihood in ten-ton trucks.’[iv] Stanley Baker plays the driver (and ex-con) Tom Yately, while the strong cast includes Herbert Lom, Peggy Cummins, William Hartnell, and Wilfred Lawson, together with, in small but significant roles, emerging British actors Sean Connery and Patrick McGoohan.

Endfield wrote at the time of the rationale for the film, and for the Rank film that followed, &quot;Sea Fury&quot; (1958), seeing both as drawing inspiration from Hollywood dramas of working-class life. The &quot;Sunday Times&quot; review referred to ‘a pace and muscular command of violent action uncommon in British cinema,’ while another critic, referencing Henri-Georges Clouzot’s 1953 film &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; (&quot;Le salaire de la peur&quot;), wrote of ‘a British &quot;Wages of Fear&quot;’. &quot;Sea Fury&quot; drew on similar aspects of the world of work, in this case following the efforts of men on salvage boats off the coast of Spain; the action sequences attracted particular critical attention.

Yet neither film was successful internationally, and in the late fifties Endfield become discouraged by the lack of opportunities in the industry. Several film projects collapsed, including adaptations of Evelyn Waugh’s &quot;Scoop&quot;, and Mary Webb’s &quot;Precious Bane&quot;, although he did direct &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; (1961), a studio project that successfully exploited Ray Harryhausen’s special effects to tell the Jules Verne story.[v]

For several years the director worked on commercials, while he and Baker engaged in a long struggle to make &quot;Zulu&quot;(1964), a recreation of the 1879 engagement between four thousand Zulu warriors and a small garrison of British soldiers at Rorke’s Drift, in southern Africa. With a script by John Prebble, Endfield and Baker (co-producers of the film) eventually achieved financing from Joseph Levine, as well as from Paramount. The resulting film was a huge success in Britain and has remained one of the most popular of British war films.[vi]

It was Endfield who took a chance on inexperienced 30-year-old actor Michael Caine to play (opposite Baker) one of the two British officers, and personally engaged the then Zulu chief, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi to play Cetshwayo, the King of the Zulus at the time. Caine has long recalled that it took an American to give this working-class actor the chance to play a British officer role.[vii] His acting career never looked back. The resulting film uses the epic scenery of the Drakensberg Mountains and the Royal National Park, establishing the beleaguered colonial garrison and then elegantly depicting the hour-long battle. For all the lack of historical context, and developed characters on the Zulu side, the film avoids jingoism, and presents the British officers as having a final sense of self-disgust at their survival.[viii]

Despite this success, Endfield struggled in the following years, as American financing for British projects became scarcer. His last film as a director was &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; (1971), with George Lazenby, while he wrote the screenplay (with Anthony Storey) for &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot; (d. Douglas Hickox, 1979), and a novel with the same title (also 1979).[ix] The science fiction writer Brian Aldiss, who worked on several unrealised projects with the director, made his own comment: ‘I admired Cy. He never had another success like &quot;Zulu&quot;. But then, how many people could have achieved the sheer organisation and artistry that went into the film?’[x]

== A Polymath ==
Endfield had a range of interests that crossed the traditional ‘two cultures’ of British life.[i] First and foremost, he had a life-long passion for close-up, sleight of hand magic, particularly involving card manipulations. As a youngster in Scranton he gave demonstrations and published tricks for the magic fraternity, while in New York in the late thirties, and in Los Angeles in the forties he designed popular magic acts. When he came to London in the fifties he was in demand, and gave presentations, including at the Magic Circle, while he maintained friendships with other exponents of card magic, including Dai Vernon, as well as with scientists with an interest in card magic and issues of probability. A book of Endfield’s card magic was published in Britain in 1955, while in 1959 he appeared on a BBC programme on contemporary magic, along with Vernon and (Tony) Slydini. Endfield maintained a correspondence with science writer Martin Gardner on close-up card magic, and science and pseudo-science, and was encouraging to younger practitioners, for example, Michael Vincent. Science fiction literature was another of his passions.[ii]

Parallel to his film career, Endfield was periodically involved with the theatre. After his time at the New Theatre League in the late thirties he ran a leftist ‘social’ theatre for around a year in Montreal. In the UK he was involved as director of several theatrical performances, the most notable of which was the run, for over a year (1962–63), of Neil Simon’s play &quot;Come Blow Your Horn&quot;, in London’s West End.

Endfield was also interested in invention, technology and design, and was often ahead of his time. He designed and patented a portable chess set composed of hand-crafted pieces that could be fitted into silver cylinders. The set was marketed to commemorate the World Championship match between Bobby Fischer of the United States and Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union, in Reykjavik in 1972. In 2021 there was a renewed interest in developing a miniature chess set based on Endfield’s design.

Also, in the late 1970s and into the 1980s, Endfield became intensely interested in devising, financing and marketing a hand-held mechanism that was essentially an early form of word processor. He worked with Chris Rainey on the device on which text could be inputted and subsequently connected to a printer. In the early 1980s the finished product, the Microwriter, was sold around the world with (for a time) some success. A related personal organiser led to Endfield and his collaborators receiving a British Design Award in 1990.
Cy Endfield died in 1995 in Shipston-on-Stour, Warwickshire, England, age 80. He is buried in Highgate Cemetery.

== Reputation and legacy ==
Endfield’s first critical success (apart from the studio and trade praise for the largely unseen 1943 short, &quot;Inflation&quot;) came with the release of &quot;The Sound of Fury&quot; (&quot;Try and Get Me!&quot;). The film attracted positive attention, despite its commercial failure. The &quot;Saturday Review of Literature&quot; (in February 1951) welcomed the low-budget feature that ‘challenges comparison with the million-dollar epics.’ After the film’s UK release, Gavin Lambert reviewed it in the British Film Institute (BFI)’s &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;. Lambert referred to the film&#x27;s remarkable ‘characterisation and the handling of the drama’ – ‘at times reaching a complexity rare in films of this type.’ (Lambert, with Lindsay Anderson, had founded the influential post-war British film magazine &quot;Sequence&quot;.) 

Endfield himself wrote a short article in the Film Society magazine &quot;Film&quot; (1958), in which he discussed his approach to directing.[i]

In 1964 Pierre Rissient, a French critic, cinėaste and sometime producer, drew more attention to the director’s work by organizing a partial retrospective of six of Endfield’s films at the Cinémathèque française. This included the first French release of &quot;The Sound of Fury.&quot; While in Paris for this event, Endfield commented about his approach to directing, noting that ‘you don’t necessarily have to go to art theatres to find art.’ He revealed his admiration for storyteller directors – he mentioned Fritz Lang and Raoul Walsh - who were able to make some degree of personal comment on the world while still being appreciated by a popular audience.[ii]

Late in his life Endfield referred to the upheavals in his life, and notably the lost opportunities attendant on his unplanned move to the UK. But he had also received critical recognition there: Raymond Durgnat, a highly respected writer on British cinema, wrote positively of Endfield’s work in his &quot;A Mirror for England&quot; (1970). 

He noted that:
&quot;… even if Cy Endfield’s &quot;Hell Drivers&quot; (1957) and &quot;Sea Fury&quot; (1958) lack the social analysis of his Hollywood &quot;The Sound of Fury&quot;, their harsh energy is exhilarating and disturbing.&quot;

In addition, Thom Andersen, in 1985, first drew attention to a group of post-war film noirs that were particularly sensitive to social and political issues. He listed thirteen examples, released between 1947 and 1951, including films directed by Robert Rossen, Abraham Polonsky, Jules Dassin, John Huston, Joseph Losey and Cy Endfield. Andersen described &quot;The Sound of Fury&quot; as a ‘remarkable tour de force of action filmmaking’.[iii]

Late in life Endfield gave a long interview to American writer Jonathan Rosenbaum, a film critic who was an early champion of the director’s work. Rosenbaum referred to Endfield’s ‘remarkable noir efforts,’ and wrote of ‘a poetry of thwarted ambitions, dark, social insights, and awesomely orchestrated struggle.’[iv] 

Despite ill-health, Endfield accepted an invitation to attend the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado in 1992, where he was awarded the festival’s Silver Medallion and was interviewed by National Public Radio’s Howie Movshowitz about &quot;The Sound of Fury&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot; and the effect of the blacklist. In 1989 and 1992 Endfield also gave interviews to Brian Neve, talking at length, in particular about his American work and the blacklist.

Since Endfield’s death in Shipston-on Stour, in the UK, on April 16, 1995 (aged 80), a number of writers have continued to explore political and other aspects of film noir, and to credit his contribution. James Naremore, in his survey of film noir and its contexts, highlights &quot;The Sound of Fury&quot;:

&quot;… the film’s lynch-mob sequences are profoundly unsettling, and the story as a whole is such a thoroughgoing indictment of capitalism and liberal complacency that it transcends the ameliorative limits of the social problem picture.&quot;[v]

Glen Erickson and others have referred to the prescience of &quot;The Sound of Fury&quot;, with its frightening depiction of populist anger.[vi] A book-length treatment of Endfield’s life and work was published in 2015. Since then there have been several retrospectives of the director’s work, notably at Anthology Film Archives in New York City, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the UCLA film &amp; television archive. His later work also received further discussion. Sheldon Hall wrote a major examination of &quot;Zulu&quot;, a film that was given a 50th anniversary showing in London in 2014. 

Critic Nick Pinkerton celebrated the range of Endfield’s cinematic achievement in a 2015 piece that concluded:

&quot;He had done a great deal in cinema, but late in life he rued the fact that he hadn’t done more – as should we, for there is much evidence here that Cy Endfield still had a few tricks up his sleeve.&quot;[vii]

<text>Norman Cornthwaite Nicholson (8 January 1914 – 30 May 1987) was an English writer. Although he is now known chiefly for his poetry, Nicholson also wrote in many other forms: novels, plays, essays, topography and criticism.

== Biography ==
Nicholson was born and lived in 14 St George&#x27;s Terrace, a Victorian terraced house and shop in the small industrial town of Millom on the edge of the Lake District. He was the son of Joseph Nicholson, a gentleman&#x27;s outfitter, and his wife Edith Cornthwaite (died 1919).

Nicholson was educated at Holborn Hill School and Millom Secondary School, but his education was interrupted at the age of 16, when he needed treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis. He then spent two years at a sanatorium in Linford, Hampshire. Although he had been regarded as one of the most brilliant school students in Cumberland his poor health prevented him from attending university and instead he devoted his life to writing.

Nicholson was influenced by the social and religious community around the local Wesleyan Methodist chapel in Millom, to which belonged Rosetta Sobey, who became his stepmother in 1922. He was confirmed in 1940 into the Church of England.

He was married in 1956 to Yvonne Edith Gardner (died 1982), a teacher who had consulted him about a school production of his play &quot;The Old Man of the Mountains&quot;. They travelled extensively in England, Scotland and Norway. They had no children.

Norman Nicholson died on 30 May 1987 in Whitehaven and was buried in St George&#x27;s Churchyard, Millom.

==Writings==
Nicholson&#x27;s writing career stretched from the 1930s until his death in 1987. He was published by T. S. Eliot at Faber and Faber and by Robert Hale. His poetry collections include &quot;Rock Face&quot; (1948), &quot;The Pot Geranium&quot; (1954), &quot;A Local Habitation&quot; (1972), and &quot;Sea to the West&quot; (1981). He was elected to the Royal Society of Literature in 1945. He received altogether five honorary higher degrees from British universities; one of Britain&#x27;s top poetry awards, the Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry in 1977; and the OBE in 1981. He reviewed frequently for the &quot;TLS&quot;, the &quot;Church Times&quot;, &quot;The Listener&quot; and many other magazines and gave numerous talks on the BBC. He also travelled widely around the UK to give poetry readings.

Some of the poems in &quot;Five Rivers&quot; foreshadow verse plays of his – &quot;The Old Man of the Mountains&quot; (1946), &quot;A Match for the Devil&quot; (1955) and &quot;Birth by Drowning&quot; (1960) – placing the Bible in a distinctly Cumbrian setting. A fourth, &quot;Prophesy to the Wind&quot; (1947) is about survival after nuclear disaster.

As a poet Nicholson is not generally associated with any of the 20th-century movements. Like Charles Causley, he stood outside the mainstream of poetic trends. Nonetheless, he acknowledged a debt to W. H. Auden and the way he had &quot;turned to the industrial scene.&quot; His descriptive poetry can be remarkably vivid:
&lt;poem&gt;
Above the collar of crags,
The granite pate breaks bare to the sky
Through a tonsure of bracken and bilberry.
(From &quot;Eskdale Granite&quot;)
&lt;/poem&gt;
Nicholson&#x27;s Lake District comprises not only the National Park but also the industrial coastal towns of Millom, Egremont, Whitehaven, Bootle and Askam. His admirers included T. S. Eliot, Ted Hughes, and Seamus Heaney, who wrote in a poem of tribute:
&lt;poem&gt;
...those Cumbrian phonetics
cracked like a plaited whip
until the slack, nostalgic
ambler in me trotted

on the paved margin
of my own black pool —
Dublin black pool, dubh linn
...that is yours and mine as well
&lt;/poem&gt;
Aspects of Nicholson include his social awareness as a champion of the working class and the environment. As a young man he worked as a lecturer for the Workers&#x27; Educational Association. He was intensely interested in geology and botany and his poem &quot;Windscale&quot; about the catastrophic nuclear accident in 1957 has become something of an environmentalists&#x27; anthem.

&lt;poem&gt;
The toadstool towers infest the shore:
Stink-horns that propagate and spore
Wherever the wind blows.
Scafell looks down from the bracken band
And sees hell in a grain of sand,
And feels the canker itch between his toes.

This is a land where dirt is clean
And poison pasture, quick and green,
And storm sky, bright and bare;
Where sewers flow with milk, and meat
is carved up for the fire to eat,
And children suffocate in God&#x27;s fresh air.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Nicholson was the subject of a South Bank Show television broadcast in the United Kingdom on 4 November 1984.

<text>Mount Hungabee, officially Hungabee Mountain, is a mountain located on the boundaries of Banff National Park and Yoho National Park on the Continental Divide at the head of Paradise Valley, in Canada. The peak was named in 1894 by Samuel Allen after the Stoney Indian (also known as Nakoda) word for &quot;chieftain&quot; as the mountain is higher than its neighbouring peaks. The mountain can be seen from the Icefields Parkway (#93) in the upper Bow Valley.

== Climbing ==
;History
Mt. Hungabee was first climbed in 1903 by H.C. Parker who was guided by Hans Kaufmann and Christian Kaufmann.

;Routes
The normal climbing route is via the west ridge (III 5.4) which features route finding challenges. Early summer is not recommended due to avalanche hazard from snow on the NW face.

==Geology==
Mount Hungabee is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Hungabee is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.

<doc id="651454" wikidata="Q3643492" url="?curid=651454" title="Brad Roberts">
<text>Bradley Kenneth Roberts (born January 10, 1964) is the lead singer and guitarist for the Canadian folk-rock band Crash Test Dummies and the only constant member since its inception. He sings in the bass-baritone range. The band is best known internationally for their 1993 album God Shuffled His Feet and single &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; and best known in Canada for the 1991 single &quot;Superman&#x27;s Song&quot;.

==Career==
===Early beginnings===
He studied English Literature and Philosophy, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree with honours from University of Winnipeg in 1986. As a musician, he is largely self taught.

Roberts began performing with Paul James and Curtis Riddell at the Blue Note Cafe in Winnipeg. Curtis, without consulting Brad, advertised them under the moniker Bad Brad Roberts and the St. James Rhythm Pigs. The band dropped this name quickly at Brad&#x27;s insistence, and after Curtis left, they evolved into The Crash Test Dummies. While studying at university and working as a bartender at The Spectrum Cabaret, Roberts began writing his own songs and introducing them to the band. After attending a songwriters&#x27; workshop with Lyle Lovett at the Winnipeg Folk Festival, he wrote &quot;Superman&#x27;s Song&quot;.

===Record deal and debut album===
Demos of Roberts&#x27;s songs found themselves in the hands of various music company execs across Canada, and the quirky bar band that had just begun to write original material found itself with record deal options which led The Crash Test Dummies into a rushed, but nevertheless well-received debut album, &quot;The Ghosts That Haunt Me&quot;. The album introduced the band to the rest of the Canadian provinces, selling over 400,000 copies in Canada alone and also garnering a 1991 Juno Award for Group of the Year.

===Second album and international success===
With more time and finances, Roberts set about writing the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;God Shuffled His Feet&quot;. This to date is the band&#x27;s best selling and most popular album, bringing an international audience and selling over six million copies. The Crash Test Dummies were nominated for three Grammy Awards in 1994. The group was nominated for eleven other Junos from 1992 to 2000.

===Third album: &quot;A Worm&#x27;s Life&quot;===
&quot;A Worm&#x27;s Life&quot; was released in 1996, selling over one million copies and showcasing a harder-edged sound as the band continued to evolve, producing this album on their own.

===Fourth album: &quot;Give Yourself a Hand&quot;===
1999 introduced a mix of electronic funk and spontaneous wordplay with &quot;Give Yourself a Hand&quot;. Roberts met Greg Wells at a songwriters&#x27; workshop and invited him to co-write and assist in recording this album inspired by influences and flavours of Roberts&#x27; new home in Harlem, New York.

===Car accident and independent release===
On September 28, 2000, Roberts was severely injured when he crashed his car on a dirt road in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia; he was charged with drug possession when marijuana was discovered on his person by the RCMP. While recuperating, he began to jam with locals (The Great Wind Jammers from Argyle, Yarmouth County), subsequently producing his next album, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care That You Don&#x27;t Mind&quot;, from the sessions — the first album released by the band, independent of a major record label.

===Sixth album: &quot;Puss &#x27;n&#x27; Boots&quot;===
&quot;Puss &#x27;n&#x27; Boots&quot; was released in October 2003 with a European and additional American version.

===Further releases===
A Crash Test Dummies album, &quot;Oooh La La!&quot;, was released in 2010. This was followed with the solo release on an album of Mantras, entitled &quot;&quot;, in 2011.

==Musical influences==
His influences as a musician are primarily rooted in late-&#x27;60s, &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s British music, from the albums &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; by The Rolling Stones, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; by The Beatles, &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; by David Bowie and &quot;Oranges &amp; Lemons&quot; by XTC, which was introduced to him by his friend on his car stereo in the late &#x27;80s.

At age 12 he bought his first record, &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot; by Kiss, and was inspired by guitarist Ace Frehley. He took guitar lessons for four years from that point.

==Personal life==
He has honour degrees in English and philosophy.

<doc id="651458" wikidata="Q1335122" url="?curid=651458" title="Achillea ptarmica">
<text>Achillea ptarmica is a Eurasian species of herbaceous perennial flowering plant in the genus &quot;Achillea&quot;. Common names include the sneezewort, sneezeweed, bastard pellitory, European pellitory, fair-maid-of-France, goose tongue, sneezewort yarrow, wild pellitory, and white tansy.

== Description ==
&quot;Achillea ptarmica&quot; has loose clusters of showy white composite flower heads that bloom from June to August. Its dark green leaves have finely toothed margins. Like many other plants, the sneezewort&#x27;s pattern of development displays the Fibonacci sequence.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;ptarmica&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;ptairo&quot; (=sneeze) and means &#x27;causes sneezing&#x27;.
==Distribution and habitat==
It is native to Europe and western Asia. It is widespread across most of Europe and naturalized in scattered places in North America.

==Uses==
The leaves can be eaten raw or cooked. The leaves are used as an insect repellent. The plant yields an essential oil that is used in herbal medicine. When chewed, the plant produces a numbing, tingling effect in the mouth, comparable to that of Sichuan pepper. For this reason, it is sometimes used in herbal medicine to relieve toothache or ulcers, and as a culinary herb.

==Cultivation==
This is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that prefers full sun and moist but well-drained soil. Propagation is by sowing seed or division in Spring. It will tolerate hot, humid summers, and drought.

<doc id="651459" wikidata="Q7913218" url="?curid=651459" title="Van Buren Trail State Park">
<text>Van Buren Trail State Park, also known as Trail State Park, is an unimproved rail trail running along a former railroad right-of-way between Hartford, Michigan to South Haven, Michigan in Van Buren County. It is long and is used by hikers, mountain bikers and horse trail riders in the summer and snowmobilers in the winter. Terrain is flat with farmland and trees.

In 2004, Van Buren County took over operation of the state-owned trail after state budget problems. There was a trail pass system to pay for maintenance but that was resolved years ago and the trail is now free for Michigan residents with a Parks Passport.

In 2015, The Michigan Department of Natural Resources paved the 4.5-mile stretch which connects Van Buren State Park to the South Haven Trail system The pavement is a 10-foot-wide asphalt surface. South Haven maintains the marked route that connects to a downtown trailhead, city businesses, beaches and Kal-Haven Trail State Park.

In the fall of 2022 the Friends of the Kal-Haven Park installed directional and mile posts along the trail to better direct guests traveling from Hartford to South Haven via Covert.

Its northern terminus is South Haven near Lake Michigan. The Kal-Haven Trail starts in South Haven northeast of downtown. The trail pass is valid for both trails.

<doc id="651472" wikidata="Q1533184" url="?curid=651472" title="Gnawa">
<text>The Gnawa () (or Gnaoua, Ghanawa, Ghanawi, Gnawi&#x27;; ) are an ethnic group inhabiting Morocco, that had been brought as slaves from the West African Sahel.

The name Gnawa originated in the indigenous language of North Africa and the Sahara Desert. The phonology of this term according to the grammatical principles of Berber is &quot;agnaw&quot; (singular) and &quot;ignawen&quot; (plural), which means &quot;black person.” 

Gnawa music was inscribed in 2019 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

==History==

The Gnawa population is generally believed to originate from the Sahelian region of West Africa, which had long and extensive trading and political ties with Morocco. The Gnawa are an ethnic group who were brought to Morocco as slaves, and their ancestry is traced to parts of West Africa. After the abolition of slavery, they became a part of the Sufi order in the Maghreb. While adopting Islam, the Gnawa continued to celebrate ritual possession during rituals which were devoted to the practice of dances of possession and fright. This rite of possession is called &quot;Jedba&quot; ().

==Gnawa and music==

Gnawa music mixes classical Islamic Sufism with pre-Islamic African folk traditions. The term Gnawa musicians generally refers to people who also practice healing rituals. The healing rituals have apparent ties to pre-Islamic African animism rites known as &quot;Bori&quot; in the Hausa culture. In Moroccan popular culture, Gnawas, through their ceremonies, are considered to be experts in the magical treatment of scorpion stings and mental illness. They heal diseases by the use of colors, condensed cultural imagery, perfumes and fright.

Gnawas play deeply hypnotic music marked by low-toned, rhythmic melodies played on a skin-covered lute called a &quot;sintir&quot; or &quot;guembri&quot;. The method, similar to garaya in Hausa traditional music, involves call-and-response singing, hand-clapping, and cymbals called &quot;krakeb&quot; (plural of &quot;karkaba&quot;). Gnawa ceremonies use music and dance to evoke ancestral saints who are said to perform the healing.

Gnawa music has won an international profile and appeal. Many Western musicians, including Bill Laswell, Brian Jones, Randy Weston, Adam Rudolph, Klaus Doldinger, Tucker Martine, Robert Plant, Jacob Collier and Jimmy Page, have drawn on and collaborated with Gnawa musicians such as brothers Mahmoud Guinia and Mokhtar Gania of Essaouira, brothers Mustapha Baqbou &amp; Ahmed Baqbou, Abdelkebir Merchane, Brahim Belkani, all from Marrakesh, as well as Hamid El Kasri and Abdelkader Amlil of Rabat and the late Ahmida Boussou and Saïd Oughassal of Casablanca, who have all participated at the annual festival in Essaouira. Some traditionalists regard modern collaborations as a mixed blessing, leaving or modifying sacred traditions for more explicitly commercial goals. International recording artists such as Hassan Hakmoun have introduced Gnawa music and dance to Western audiences through their recordings and concert performances.

The centres for Gnawa music are Marrakesh, Tangier, Rabat, Casablanca, Fez and Essaouira, which is in the southwest of Morocco where the Gnaoua World Music Festival is held annually. The Gnawa of Marrakesh hold their annual festival at the sanctuary of Moulay Brahim in the Atlas Mountains and around the sanctuary of Moulay Abdullah bin Tsain in the village of Tamesloht, between Marrakesh and the town of Amizmiz. The festivals take place in connection with the birthday of Muhammad.

The Gnawa of Khamlia hold their annual festival in August at the village of Khamlia in Erg Chebbi.

Finally there is also a special tribe inside Gnawa called Ganga. The Ganga are of subsaharan African origin and typically speak Tashelhait, and are found in Haha between Essaouira and Agadir and in the Sous Valley around towns like Agadir and Taroudant. They do not play the &quot;guimbri&quot; but only focus on the dance known as &quot;kouyou&quot;, playing &quot;krakeb&quot; and the large drums called &quot;tebel&quot; or &quot;ganga&quot;, which is also part of the procession of the regular gnawa ceremony.

<text>The name Eurymachus or Eurymachos (; Ancient Greek: Εὐρύμαχος &quot;Eurúmakhos&quot;) is attributed to the following individuals:

== Mythology ==

* Eurymachus, son of Hermes and father of Eriboea, mother of the Aloadae.
*Eurymachus, a prince of the Phlegyes who attacked and destroyed Thebes after the death of Amphion and Zethus.
*Eurymachus, the fourth suitor of Princess Hippodamia of Pisa, Elis. Like the other suitors of the latter, he was killed by the bride&#x27;s father, King Oenomaus.
* Eurymachus, son of Antenor and Theano. He was the brother of Crino, Acamas, Agenor, Antheus, Archelochus, Coön, Demoleon, Glaucus, Helicaon, Iphidamas, Laodamas, Laodocus, Medon, Polybus, and Thersilochus. Eurymachus was engaged to King Priam&#x27;s daughter Polyxena.
* Eurymachus, a fisherman from Syme, a small island between Caria and Rhodes, who came with their leader Nireus to fight against Troy. He was killed with a spear by Polydamas, the Trojan friend of Hector.
* Eurymachus, an Achaean warrior who participated in the Trojan War. He was among those who hid inside the Wooden Horse.
*Eurymachus, son of Polybus and one of the suitors of Penelope.

== History ==

*Eurymachus, one of the 180 Theban soldiers who were taken prisoner in the Theban siege of Plataea. All of the Theban soldiers were killed after the Plataeans brought everyone living outside of their walls into the city after unrequited negotiation with Thebes&#x27;s nightly backup troops. Thucydides states that Eurymachus was &quot;a man of great influence at Thebes,&quot; and that the Platean, Naucleides, arranged with him to bring in &quot;a little over 300&quot; Theban troops in the middle of the night, for a sneak attack. This event touched off the Peloponnesian War.

== Astronomy ==

, a minor planet named after the Achaean warrior

<text>Secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is a technique used to analyze the composition of solid surfaces and thin films by sputtering the surface of the specimen with a focused primary ion beam and collecting and analyzing ejected secondary ions. The mass/charge ratios of these secondary ions are measured with a mass spectrometer to determine the elemental, isotopic, or molecular composition of the surface to a depth of 1 to 2 nm. Due to the large variation in ionization probabilities among elements sputtered from different materials, comparison against well-calibrated standards is necessary to achieve accurate quantitative results. SIMS is the most sensitive surface analysis technique, with elemental detection limits ranging from parts per million to parts per billion.

==History==
In 1910 British physicist J. J. Thomson observed a release of positive ions and neutral atoms from a solid surface induced by ion bombardment. Improved vacuum pump technology in the 1940s enabled the first prototype experiments on SIMS by Herzog and Viehböck in 1949, at the University of Vienna, Austria. In the mid-1950s Honig constructed a SIMS instrument at RCA Laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey. Then in the early 1960s two SIMS instruments were developed independently. One was an American project, led by Liebel and Herzog, which was sponsored by NASA at GCA Corp, Massachusetts, for analyzing Moon rocks, the other at the University of Paris-Sud in Orsay by R. Castaing for the PhD thesis of G. Slodzian. These first instruments were based on a magnetic double focusing sector field mass spectrometer and used argon for the primary beam ions. 

In the 1970s, K. Wittmaack and C. Magee developed SIMS instruments equipped with quadrupole mass analyzers. Around the same time, A. Benninghoven introduced the method of static SIMS, where the primary ion current density is so small that only a negligible fraction (typically 1%) of the first surface layer is necessary for surface analysis. Instruments of this type use pulsed primary ion sources and time-of-flight mass spectrometers and were developed by Benninghoven, Niehuis and Steffens at the University of Münster, Germany and also by Charles Evans &amp; Associates. The Castaing and Slodzian design was developed in the 1960s by the French company CAMECA S.A.S. and used in materials science and surface science. Recent developments are focusing on novel primary ion species like C60+, ionized clusters of gold and bismuth, or large gas cluster ion beams (e.g., Ar700+). The sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) is a large-diameter, double-focusing SIMS sector instrument based on the Liebl and Herzog design, and produced by Australian Scientific Instruments in Canberra, Australia.

==Instrumentation==
A secondary ion mass spectrometer consists of (1) a primary ion gun generating the primary ion beam, (2) a primary ion column, accelerating and focusing the beam onto the sample (and in some devices an opportunity to separate the primary ion species by Wien filter or to pulse the beam), (3) high vacuum sample chamber holding the sample and the secondary ion extraction lens, (4) a mass analyser separating the ions according to their mass-to-charge ratio, and (5) a detector.

===Vacuum===
SIMS requires a high vacuum with pressures below 10−4 Pa (roughly 10−6 mbar or torr). This is needed to ensure that secondary ions do not collide with background gases on their way to the detector (i.e. the mean free path of gas molecules within the detector must be large compared to the size of the instrument), and it also limits surface contamination by adsorption of background gas particles during measurement.

===Primary ion source===
Three types of ion guns are employed. In one, ions of gaseous elements are usually generated with duoplasmatrons or by electron ionization, for instance noble gases (40Ar+, Xe+), oxygen (16O−, 16O2+, 16O2−), or even ionized molecules such as SF5+ (generated from SF6) or C60+ (fullerene). This type of ion gun is easy to operate and generates roughly focused but high current ion beams. A second source type, the surface ionization source, generates 133Cs+ primary ions. Cesium atoms vaporize through a porous tungsten plug and are ionized during evaporation. Depending on the gun design, fine focus or high current can be obtained. A third source type, the liquid metal ion gun (LMIG), operates with metals or metallic alloys, which are liquid at room temperature or slightly above. The liquid metal covers a tungsten tip and emits ions under influence of an intense electric field. While a gallium source is able to operate with elemental gallium, recently developed sources for gold, indium and bismuth use alloys which lower their melting points. The LMIG provides a tightly focused ion beam (&lt;50 nm) with moderate intensity and is additionally able to generate short pulsed ion beams. It is therefore commonly used in static SIMS devices.

The choice of the ion species and ion gun respectively depends on the required current (pulsed or continuous), the required beam dimensions of the primary ion beam and on the sample which is to be analyzed. Oxygen primary ions are often used to investigate electropositive elements due to an increase of the generation probability of positive secondary ions, while caesium primary ions often are used when electronegative elements are being investigated. For short pulsed ion beams in static SIMS, LMIGs are most often deployed for analysis; they can be combined with either an oxygen gun or a caesium gun during elemental depth profiling, or with a C60+ or gas cluster ion source during molecular depth profiling.

===Mass analyzer===
Depending on the SIMS type, there are three basic analyzers available: sector, quadrupole, and time-of-flight. A sector field mass spectrometer uses a combination of an electrostatic analyzer and a magnetic analyzer to separate the secondary ions by their mass-to-charge ratio. A quadrupole mass analyzer separates the masses by resonant electric fields, which allow only the selected masses to pass through. The time of flight mass analyzer separates the ions in a field-free drift path according to their velocity. Since all ions possess the same kinetic energy the velocity and therefore time of flight varies according to mass. It requires pulsed secondary ion generation using either a pulsed primary ion gun or a pulsed secondary ion extraction. It is the only analyzer type able to detect all generated secondary ions simultaneously, and is the standard analyzer for static SIMS instruments.

===Detector===
A Faraday cup measures the ion current hitting a metal cup, and is sometimes used for high current secondary ion signals. With an electron multiplier an impact of a single ion starts off an electron cascade, resulting in a pulse of 108 electrons which is recorded directly. A microchannel plate detector is similar to an electron multiplier, with lower amplification factor but with the advantage of laterally-resolved detection. Usually it is combined with a fluorescent screen, and signals are recorded either with a CCD-camera or with a fluorescence detector.

==Detection limits and sample degradation==
Detection limits for most trace elements are between 1012 and 1016 atoms per cubic centimetre, depending on the type of instrumentation used, the primary ion beam used and the analytical area, and other factors. Samples as small as individual pollen grains and microfossils can yield results by this technique.

The amount of surface cratering created by the process depends on the current (pulsed or continuous) and dimensions of the primary ion beam. While only charged secondary ions emitted from the material surface through the sputtering process are used to analyze the chemical composition of the material, these represent a small fraction of the particles emitted from the sample.

==Static and dynamic modes==
In the field of surface analysis, it is usual to distinguish &quot;static SIMS&quot; and &quot;dynamic SIMS&quot;. Static SIMS is the process involved in surface atomic monolayer analysis, or surface molecular analysis, usually with a pulsed ion beam and a time of flight mass spectrometer, while dynamic SIMS is the process involved in bulk analysis, closely related to the sputtering process, using a DC primary ion beam and a magnetic sector or quadrupole mass spectrometer.

Dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry (DSIMS) is a powerful tool for characterizing surfaces, including the elemental, molecular, and isotopic composition and can be used to study the structure of thin films, the composition of polymers, and the surface chemistry of catalysts. DSIMS was developed by John B. Fenn and Koichi Tanaka in the early 1980s. DSIMS is mainly used by the semiconductor industry.

==Applications==
The COSIMA instrument onboard Rosetta was the first instrument to determine the composition of cometary dust in situ with secondary ion mass spectrometry during the spacecraft&#x27;s 2014–2016 close approaches to comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko.

SIMS is used for quality assurance purposes in the semiconductor industry and for the characterization of natural samples from this planet and others. More recently, this technique is being applied to nuclear forensics, and a nanoscale version of SIMS, termed NanoSIMS, has been applied to pharmaceutical research.

SIMS can be used in the forensics field to develop fingerprints. Since SIMS is a vacuum based method, it is necessary to determine the order of usage along with other methods of analysis for fingerprints. This is because the mass of the fingerprint significantly decreases after exposure to vacuum conditions.

<doc id="651486" wikidata="Q310292" url="?curid=651486" title="Jim Cummings">
<text>James Jonah Cummings (born November 3, 1952) is an American voice actor. Beginning his career in the 1980s, he has appeared in over 400 titles. Cummings has frequently worked with the Walt Disney Company and Warner Bros., serving as the official voice of Winnie the Pooh since 1988, Tigger since 1989, the Tasmanian Devil since 1991, and Peg Leg Pete since 1992. Other notable roles include Fat Cat and Monterey Jack on &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot; (1989–1990), the title character on &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; (1991–1992), Dr. Julian Robotnik on &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1993–1994), Kaa on &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot; (1996–1998) and &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot; (2003), Cat on &quot;CatDog&quot; (1998–2005), and Ray in &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot; (2009).

==Early life==
Born in Youngstown, Ohio, Cummings attended Immaculate Conception and St. Columba grade schools as well as Ursuline High School and graduated from there in 1970.

Upon his graduation from high school, Cummings relocated to New Orleans, where he designed and painted Mardi Gras floats, worked as a river boat deck hand, and sang and played drums in the regionally-successful rock band Fusion. He later married and moved to Anaheim, California, where he managed a video store in the early 1980s, before launching his voice acting career in late 1984.

==Career==
===Early work and voice doubling===
Cummings&#x27;s first voice role was as Lionel the Lion and Aunt Fira in &quot;Dumbo&#x27;s Circus&quot;. Some of Cummings&#x27; earliest vocal work was at Disney, where he replaced Sterling Holloway as the voice of Winnie the Pooh in 1988. His impression proved to be so spot-on that he also filled in for Holloway as Kaa for both &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot; and &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot;, and as the Cheshire Cat for various Disney video games. He also notably impersonated J. Pat O&#x27;Malley in the roles of Colonel Hathi for both aforementioned productions and the Colonel in &quot;101 Dalmatians: The Series&quot;, Louis Prima as King Louie in &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot; and &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, and Wayne Knight as Tantor the Elephant in &quot;The Legend of Tarzan&quot;. Starting with &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, Cummings also became the regular voice of Pete.

Beginning with &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;, Cummings alternated with Paul Winchell as Tigger, before fully replacing him as the character starting with &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot;. He had also filled in for Winchell as the voice of Zummi Gummi in the final season of &quot;Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot;, and as Dick Dastardly in &quot;Wacky Races Forever&quot; and &quot;Wacky Races Starring Dastardly and Muttley&quot;. Similarly, he alternated with Peter Cullen in the role of Monterey Jack in &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;. In &quot;The Little Mermaid: Ariel&#x27;s Beginning&quot;, Cummings voiced King Triton in place of Kenneth Mars, who was unable to reprise the role due to his struggles with pancreatic cancer. In 1991, he was hired by Warner Bros. Animation to voice Taz on the animated series &quot;Taz-Mania&quot; and would continue to voice the character in various &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; media.

When actor Jeremy Irons, the voice of Scar in &quot;The Lion King&quot;, developed vocal problems during the recording of the song &quot;Be Prepared&quot;, Cummings replaced him on the remainder of the track. He also provided Scar&#x27;s voice in a brief nightmare sequence in &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot;. Cummings would later be hired as the singing double for both Russell Means as Chief Powhatan and Gordon Tootoosis as Kekata in &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, and the singing double for Christopher Lloyd as Grigori Rasputin in &quot;Anastasia&quot;. He went onto understudy for Lloyd by voicing Rasputin for the &quot;&quot; video game.

Cummings has also voiced Smokey Bear for several U.S. Forest Service commercials, ads, and promos from 1993 to 2008.

===Original characters===
Besides being a voice double and sound-alike, Cummings has also voiced original characters.

In &quot;Rescue Rangers&quot; and &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, he portrayed a wide variety of other characters. His most famous role in &quot;Rescue Rangers&quot; was the villainous Fat Cat, and for &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, he notably starred as the show&#x27;s main antagonist, Don Karnage. After both shows concluded production, Cummings went on to portray the title characters in &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; and &quot;Bonkers&quot;, each of which he also got to voice other characters. He would later co-star with Tom Kenny in &quot;CatDog&quot;, with Cummings playing Cat and Kenny voicing Dog. Also, despite having starred in animated feature films under &quot;additional voices&quot;, Cummings achieved a motion picture breakthrough by starring in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin&quot;, where he voiced both Razoul the Agrabah Guard Captain and Farouk the Merchant. He later went on to voice original characters for a variety of the company&#x27;s theatrical and direct-to-video films, such as Ed the Hyena in &quot;The Lion King&quot; and Ray the Firefly in &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;. In 1998, Cummings also starred as Ocula the Gorgonite in &quot;Small Soldiers&quot;, which was a live-action film directed by Joe Dante.

Aside from Fat Cat and Don Karnage, Cummings&#x27;s involvements as Pete and the Tasmanian Devil were elements that typecast him in antagonistic roles. An example comes from when he voiced Steele the Alaskan Malamute in Universal&#x27;s &quot;Balto&quot;. According to an interview with director Simon Wells, the role was originally offered to Brendan Fraser, but executive producer Steven Spielberg recommended recasting the role with Cummings because he wanted to feel a clearer sense of Steele&#x27;s &quot;inherent evil&quot;. Wells stated that Cummings &quot;did a fantastic job, and totally made the character live, so I don&#x27;t regret the choice.&quot;. Other villain roles Cummings notably took on include Sierra the Cearadactylus in &quot;The Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire&quot;, and Doctor Robotnik in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; animated series that aired from 1993 to 1994. He also voiced several characters in the 1997 video game &quot;Fallout&quot;, but his most notable role was the game&#x27;s main antagonist, The Master.

In addition, he voiced various characters for the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchises. His most famous role in &quot;Star Wars&quot; is Hondo Ohnaka the Weequay Pirate. According to Cummings, Ohnaka was initially only going to appear in a two or three episode story arc of &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, but the character was so well-received that he became much more recurring throughout the franchise. Following the departure of Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, Cummings was hired to portray characters in several productions by Dreamworks, most notably voicing the Captain of Lord Farquaad&#x27;s Guards in &quot;Shrek&quot;, Hernán Cortés in &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; along with additional characters, and Luca in &quot;&quot;. In 2006, Cummings voiced a variety of characters for the &quot;Curious George&quot; animated TV show, notably voicing that of Pisghetti the Italian Chef, the male members of the Quint family, and Jumpy Squirrel, the latter which he provided merely animal sounds. The series became one of the longest-running American children&#x27;s programs around, having initially run for nine seasons on PBS Kids before being renewed following the launch of Peacock, the streaming service of NBCUniversal.

===Recent works===
In 2018, Cummings became the first voice performer of animation to reprise a role or more for a live-action Disney film, reprising the roles of Winnie the Pooh and Tigger for &quot;Christopher Robin&quot;. For the film, the role of Tigger was originally going to be played by Chris O&#x27;Dowd, but due to negative reactions from test audiences, Disney immediately replaced O&#x27;Dowd with Cummings. His performance as Pooh was particularly praised by Richard Lawson of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, who felt it was &quot;Oscar-worthy&quot; and said that &quot;[a]s Winnie the Pooh ... the veteran voice actor gives such sweet, rumpled, affable life to the wistful bear of literary renown that it routinely breaks the heart.&quot;

Nearly three years later, Cummings reprised the role of Taz by providing uncredited vocal effects for the character in some scenes of &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;. His recordings in question were mixed with material by Fred Tatasciore, who was the character&#x27;s credited voice actor for the film and previously played the part for &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;. Cummings would later go on to reprise the roles of Fat Cat, Darkwing Duck, and Pete for the &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot; film, along with the right arm of Shredder from the 1987 &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; animated series, and bootleg versions of Pooh and Tigger. Meanwhile, the role of Monterey Jack was played by Australian actor and comedian Eric Bana. Over a year after the film&#x27;s release, Cummings reprised the role of King Triton for &quot;Lego Disney Princess: The Castle Quest&quot;, making his first appearance as the character since &quot;Ariel&#x27;s Beginning&quot;. Months later, Cummings reprised the role of Winnie the Pooh for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot; to sing a portion of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;, the short in question also featured him as the voice of Baloo from &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; for a similar purpose. Cummings was also involved in Disney Speedstorm. For the game, he voiced Steamboat Pete for the &quot;To Infinity and Beyond&quot; season, and he later made his third appearance as King Triton for the &quot;Under the Sea&quot; season.

Beginning on June 12, 2023, Cummings began hosting a podcast called &quot;Toon&#x27;d In!with Jim Cummings&quot;, which is available on &quot;Spotify&quot;, &quot;Apple Podcasts&quot;, and &quot;Spreaker&quot;. In the series, Cummings talks about the wide array of characters he voiced over the years, and various other voice artists guest star in episodes for interviews. In 2025 he reprised several of his past roles (Fat Cat, Darkwing Duck and Bonkers Bobcat) in the Chibiverse episode &quot;Journey at the Center of the Chibiverse&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cummings has two daughters with his former wife Stephanie Jardon. The two were married from 2001 to 2011, when they divorced. In 2019, they became involved in an acrimonious custody dispute, which Cummings won. Cummings also has two older daughters from a previous marriage.

In an interview with the A.V. Club, Cummings commented that his prime voice acting influences are Mel Blanc, Paul Winchell, Paul Frees, June Foray, and Frank Welker. He particularly noted Blanc by classifying him as the &quot;Frank Sinatra of voice acting&quot;, and Welker by calling him &quot;The Beatles of voiceover&quot;.

In a separate interview with Collider, Cummings stated that his favorite characters to play are Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Ray the Firefly, Drake Mallard/Darkwing Duck, and Hondo Ohnaka.

<doc id="651488" wikidata="Q1529459" url="?curid=651488" title="Julie Cypher">
<text>Julie Cypher (born August 24, 1964) is an American film director and gay rights advocate. She is best known as the former partner of musician Melissa Etheridge, with whom she had two children. They were one of the first celebrity same-sex couples. This relationship had followed Cypher&#x27;s three-year marriage to actor Lou Diamond Phillips. In 2004 she married again, to another man.

==Biography==
Cypher was born in Wichita, Kansas, to Dick and Betty (&quot;&quot; Jackson) Cypher. She has an older sister named Melanie. She attended the University of Texas at Austin, studying television and film.

She married actor Lou Diamond Phillips on September 17, 1987. Two years later, she met Melissa Etheridge while assisting on the music video for the single &quot;Bring Me Some Water&quot;. She separated from Phillips in 1990 and came out as a lesbian and started a relationship with Melissa Etheridge. Cypher directed the 1995 film &quot;Teresa&#x27;s Tattoo&quot;, starring Phillips, C. Thomas Howell, and Kiefer Sutherland. 

==Personal life==
After marrying and being with actor Lou Diamond Phillips for three years, Cypher separated and came out as a lesbian. 

She was a gay rights advocate, and became notable as a partner in one of the first publicly lesbian celebrity couples. In 1995, she and Melissa Etheridge appeared in a &quot;We&#x27;d Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur&quot; poster campaign for PETA.

During her partnership with Etheridge, Cypher gave birth to two children via artificial insemination: a daughter, Bailey Jean, born in February 1997; and a son, Beckett, born November 1998. Although initially reluctant to discuss it, the couple eventually revealed that the biological father of both children was musician David Crosby. In a 1999 therapy session, Cypher told Etheridge that she (Cypher) was &quot;not gay&quot;. The couple split in September 2000. 

Cypher later married again, to Matthew Hale in 2004.

On May 13, 2020, Etheridge announced via Twitter that Beckett, her son with Cypher, had died at age 21.

<text>Mount Clemenceau is the fourth highest mountain in the Park Ranges of the Canadian Rockies. The peak was originally named &quot;Pyramid&quot; in 1892 by Arthur Coleman. The mountain was renamed by the Interprovincial Boundary Survey in 1919 to its present name, which is for Georges Clemenceau, premier of France during World War I.

Mt. Clemenceau was first climbed in 1923 by D.B. Durand, H.S. Hall, W.D. Harris and H.B. De V. Schwab.

== Routes ==
There are three standard climbing routes:
*West Face II
**This is the normal route, similar to the north glacier route (normal) on Mount Athabasca but considered more interesting. The route avoids the steepest parts of the face.
*North-East Ridge IV
*North Face IV

<text>Lenora Branch Fulani (born April 25, 1950) is an American psychologist, psychotherapist, and political activist. She is best known for her presidential campaigns and development of youth programs serving minority communities in the New York City area. In the 1988 United States presidential election heading the New Alliance Party ticket, she became the first woman and the first African American to achieve ballot access in all fifty states. Fulani&#x27;s political concerns include racial equality, gay rights, and political reform, specifically to encourage third parties.

Fulani has worked closely since 1980 with Fred Newman, a New York–based psychotherapist and political activist who has often served as her campaign manager. Newman developed the theory and practice of Social Therapy in the 1970s, founding the New York Institute for Social Therapy in 1977. Along with psychologist Lois Holzman, Fulani has worked to incorporate the social therapeutic approach into youth-oriented programs, most notably the New York City–based All Stars Project, which she co-founded in 1981.

Fulani joined activists who supported Ross Perot for president in the 1992 United States presidential election in a national effort to create a new pro-reform party. In 1994 she led the formation of the Committee for a Unified Independent Party (CUIP). For years Fulani was active with Newman&#x27;s version of the International Workers Party (IWP). Since then, she has been active with the Independence Party of New York.

==Early life==
Fulani was born Lenora Branch in 1950 in Chester, Pennsylvania, the youngest daughter of Pearl, a registered nurse, and of Charles Branch, a railway baggage handler. Her father died of pneumonia when she was 12. As a teenager in Chester in the 1960s, Fulani was active in her local Baptist church, where she played piano for the choir. She graduated from Chester High School.

In 1967, Fulani was awarded a scholarship to study at Hofstra University in New York. She graduated in 1971, and went on to earn a master&#x27;s degree from Columbia University&#x27;s Teachers College. In the late 1970s, she earned a PhD in developmental psychology from the City University of New York (CUNY). Fulani was a guest researcher at Rockefeller University from 1973 to 1977, with a focus on how learning and social environment interact for African-American youth.

In college, she became involved in black nationalist politics, along with her then-husband, Richard. Both had adopted the name of the West African people Fulani as a surname when they married in a traditional West African ceremony. During her studies at City University, Fulani became interested in the work of Fred Newman and Lois Holzman, who had recently formed the New York Institute for Social Therapy and Research. Fulani studied at the Institute in the early 1980s.

==Electoral politics==
Fulani became active in the Newman-founded independent New Alliance Party (NAP) and emerged as a spokesperson who often provoked controversy. In 1982, Fulani ran for New York Lieutenant Governor on the NAP ticket. She has also been involved in the affiliated (or, some say, secret) Independent Workers Party, the Rainbow Alliance, and other shifting groups that were led by Newman.

She helped to recruit the NAP&#x27;s 1984 presidential candidate Dennis L. Serrette, an African-American trade union activist. Although he was quite involved with the party for years, Serrette left and published critical accounts of what he described as its cultic operation.

Fulani ran for president in 1988 as the candidate of the New Alliance Party. She received almost a quarter of a million votes or 0.2% of the vote. She was, at the same, the first African-American, independent, and female presidential candidate on the ballot in all 50 states. In the 1990 New York gubernatorial election, Fulani ran as a New Alliance candidate. She was endorsed that year by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. She received 31,089 votes for 0.77% of the total vote.

Although in 1987, Fulani and Newman began an alliance with minister and activist Al Sharpton, he ran for the US Senate from New York as a Democrat, rather than as an Independent. After that, Sharpton has kept his distance from both Fulani and Newman.

Fulani again ran as the New Alliance candidate in the 1992 presidential election, this time receiving 0.07% of the vote. She chose former Peace and Freedom Party activist Maria Elizabeth Muñoz as her vice-presidential running mate. Muñoz ran on the NAP ticket for the offices of US senator and California governor. In 1992 Fulani self-published her autobiography &quot;The Making of a Fringe Candidate, 1992&quot;.

In 1994, Fulani and Newman became affiliated with the Patriot Party, one of the many groups that later competed for control of the Reform Party, which was founded by Ross Perot. She also joined with Jacqueline Salit to start the Committee for a Unified Independent Party (CUIP), which was formed to bring together independent groups to challenge the bipartisan hegemony in American politics.

During the 2000 presidential election, Fulani surprisingly endorsed Pat Buchanan, who was then running on the Reform Party ticket. She even served briefly as co-chair of the campaign. Fulani withdrew her endorsement and said that Buchanan was trying to further his right-wing agenda. Fulani and Newman then endorsed the presidential candidacy of Natural Law Party leader John Hagelin, a close associate of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Later, Fulani unsuccessfully sought the vice-presidential nomination at the national convention organized by a faction of the Reform Party.

In the 2001 New York City mayoral election, Fulani endorsed the Republican candidate Michael Bloomberg and organized city members of the IP to work for his campaign. Bloomberg, once elected, approved an $8.7 million municipal bond to provide financing for Fulani and Newman to build a new headquarters for their youth program, theater, and telemarketing center.

In the municipal election of 2003, Fulani was among those who endorsed Bloomberg&#x27;s proposed amendment to the New York City Charter to establish nonpartisan elections. Although Bloomberg spent $7 million of his own money to promote the amendment, voters rejected it.

In September 2005, the State Executive Committee of the Independence Party of New York dropped Fulani and other members from the New York City chapter. That was part of a fierce power struggle that brewed between members from Upstate New York and Long Island, and Newman, Fulani, and the other members based in New York City. Most party members were disaffected by the ideology of Newman and Fulani. The party&#x27;s state chairman, Frank MacKay, a former ally of Fulani, claimed the action to have followed Fulani&#x27;s refusal to repudiate an earlier statement that many considered to be anti-Semitic. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;In 1989, Dr. Fulani wrote that the Jews &#x27;had to sell their souls to acquire Israel&#x27; and had to &#x27;function as mass murderers of people of color&#x27; to stay there.&quot; She refused to disavow these comments in 2005. Fulani said that she did not intend the statement as anti-Semitic but wanted to raise issues that she believed needed to be explored. She has, however, since repudiated the remarks, which she characterized as &quot;excessive&quot; and publicly apologized to &quot;any people who had been hurt by them.&quot;

Citing the &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; allegations, Independence Party State chairman Frank MacKay initiated proceedings to have nearly 200 Independence Party members in New York City expelled from the party. Each case that MacKay brought to the New York State Supreme Court was dismissed. In one instance, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Emily Jane Goodman wrote that the charges were &quot;more political than philosophical.&quot;

Fulani formed a coalition to organize Independence Party support for the re-election campaign of Bloomberg. The local press described the coalition as composed of &quot;union officials, clergy, sanitation workers, police officers, firefighters, district leaders and others who work at the grassroots level.&quot; Spirited defenses of Fulani have appeared in the city&#x27;s black press; writing in the &quot;Amsterdam News&quot;, columnist Richard Carter wrote &quot;there is little doubt that the main reason for the negative press, which, by the way, is not unusual for this brilliant, outspoken political strategist, is because she is a strong, no-nonsense Black woman. So strong she makes the city&#x27;s political establishment and lockstep white news media nervous.&quot;

==Community work==

Fulani has worked on a number of community outreach and youth development projects. In 1984, she helped found the Castillo Cultural Center in New York City, which produces mostly plays written by Newman, in an unusual arrangement. In 1998, the Castillo Center merged with the All Stars Project youth charity and broadened the single base for Newman&#x27;s work. Fulani has been active in the development of educational programs associated with the All Stars Project, including the Joseph A. Forgione Development School for Youth and the All Stars Talent Show Network, which create enriching experiences outside of schools for poor inner-city youth, using a performance model. Fulani described her approach in Derrick Bell&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;Silent Covenants: Brown V. Board of Education and the Unfulfilled Hopes for Racial Reform&quot;:

We teach young people to use performance skills to become more cosmopolitan and sophisticated—to interact with the worlds of Wall Street, with business and the arts. In becoming more cosmopolitan—in going beyond their narrow and parochial and largely nationalistic identities—they acquire a motivation to learn as a part of consistently creating and recreating their lives.

In 2004, the Anti-Defamation League criticized the All Stars/Castillo theater troupe for its play &quot;Crown Heights&quot; and accused the playwright of blaming the riots on the Jewish community. The play dramatized events of the 1991 riots in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, after a motorcade of the Lubavitcher rabbi accidentally killed a seven-year-old black Caribbean-American child. The accident ignited long-standing tensions in the community; in street violence, a visiting Australian rabbinical student, Yankel Rosenbaum, was stabbed to death by Lemrick Nelson, a 16-year-old Crown Heights youth.

A local Brooklyn paper described the play favorably.

==Criticism==
Newman and Fulani&#x27;s leadership, as well as various manifestations of the political party, such as the International Workers Party (IWP), have been strongly criticized by former members through the years, including party candidate Dennis Serrette and five-year member Marina Ortiz. In addition, Political Research Associates published a critical report on the NAP in 1987 that was updated in 2008 in which Ortiz accused Newman and Fulani of manipulating followers with &quot;psychopolitical cultism.&quot;

After working with Fulani for several years, Serrette, who also had a personal relationship with her, has questioned his experience and publicly criticized Newman and Fulani&#x27;s leadership of the party and its members: &quot;it was clearly a tactical... a racist scheme of using Black and Latino and Asian people to do the bidding of one man, namely Fred Newman, that&#x27;s my opinion, and to use other whites as well, you know through the therapy practices.&quot;

After he raised his concerns internally, Serrette said his treatment by other NAP leaders worsened dramatically. He also questioned the way in which therapy was used in the political work: &quot;therapy was a way of getting people to not only operate in an organizational way but also a way of controlling every aspect of their lives... you certainly couldn&#x27;t straighten anybody out. But it was certainly effective in terms of controlling a lot of people to do the kinds of things that were asked of them... they would do anything, just about, that he would ask them to do.&quot;

In an article published after he left the NAP, Serrette stated:

Fulani dismissed his charges as related simply to the end of their personal relationship. In her self-published autobiography, &quot;The Making of a Fringe Candidate, 1992&quot; (1992), Fulani wrote that Serrette frequently fought with black women in the New Alliance Party and would &quot;criticize and ridicule&quot; them for their relationship to Newman.
