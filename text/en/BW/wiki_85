<text>Flix (stylized as FLiX) is an American premium cable and satellite television network owned by Showtime Networks, a division of Paramount Global operated through its Paramount Media Networks division. Its programming consists solely of theatrically released motion pictures released from the 1970s to the present day, interspersed with some films from the 1950s and 1960s.

It is the only premium television service in the United States that does not operate any multiplex channels that provide additional programming alongside the main service. Although Flix is typically offered as part of the Showtime multiplex, the channel&#x27;s carriage varies depending on both the cable provider and market, therefore it may not be available alongside Showtime and The Movie Channel&#x27;s multiplex services in all areas. Although one or both of the channels have traditionally been carried alongside the Showtime multiplex on cable and satellite providers, , Flix as well as The Movie Channel are not presently carried by any of the over-the-top subscription television services – Hulu Live TV, Sling TV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Now – that carry most or all of the eight Showtime multiplex channels.

In recent years, Flix has lost carriage with the growth of streaming alternatives including its parent company&#x27;s Paramount+, and has generally been depreciated by Paramount in current retransmission consent negotiations with cable and streaming providers. Unlike Showtime, The Movie Channel, and other premium television networks, Flix does not carry multiplex channels under the brand.

== History ==
The network launched on August 1, 1992, as a single-channel &quot;mini-pay&quot; service. Flix originally featured movies from the 1960s to the 1980s, although it would gradually begin to scatter some 1990s film titles onto the network&#x27;s schedule over time. At its launch, Flix had been one of the last premium channels to restrict the broadcast of R-rated films to the nighttime hours. A notable aspect of Flix during its early days was that the channel did not solely advertise the channel&#x27;s own prime time lineup, but also ran a schedule of programs that were slated to air that evening on the other major U.S. premium channels – including HBO, Cinemax and Encore as well as sister networks Showtime and The Movie Channel – during breaks between daytime movies (since 2002, Showtime has been the only other premium service that the network has provided prime time listings during its prime time lineup segment).

Three years prior to the channel&#x27;s launch, in 1989, Tele-Communications Inc. made a failed bid to acquire a 50% ownership stake in Showtime from Viacom. There was some debate as to whether Viacom or TCI originally conceived the idea for Encore, another (one-time) &quot;mini-pay&quot; service that was originally similar in format to Flix, which also focused on films from the 1960s to the 1980s until a format change in 1999 in which that channel added more recent films to its schedule. Viacom executives insisted that TCI lifted part of the idea for Encore from the company&#x27;s Showtime Networks division. John Sie, the president of Encore at the time, said in a 1991 interview with &quot;Multichannel News&quot; that TCI brought up the concept of the Encore network as a way to revitalize Showtime, either by launching a new tertiary service from scratch or by overhauling the format of Showtime&#x27;s existing sister network The Movie Channel.

On June 14, 2005, Viacom decided to separate itself into two companies (only six years after the company&#x27;s acquisition of CBS), both of which would be controlled by Viacom parent National Amusements, amid stagnation of the company&#x27;s stock price. The original Viacom was restructured as CBS Corporation and acquired Showtime Networks along with CBS&#x27; broadcasting assets, Paramount Television (now the separate arms CBS Television Studios for network and cable production, and CBS Television Distribution for production of first-run syndicated programs and off-network series distribution), advertising firm Viacom Outdoor (renamed CBS Outdoor), Simon &amp; Schuster and Paramount Parks (which was later sold); the new Viacom kept Paramount Pictures, the MTV Networks and BET Networks cable divisions, and Famous Music (the latter was sold off in 2007).

In 2007, Flix began to broadcast certain R-rated movies during daytime timeslots. That same year, Flix began to air movies released in 2000, including such titles as &quot;Reindeer Games&quot; and &quot;Pitch Black&quot;; other films released during the 2000s have been added to the network&#x27;s schedule since then.

On August 13, 2019, National Amusements officially announced that CBS and Viacom would re-merge into a new entity known as ViacomCBS, to be headed by Viacom CEO Bob Bakish as the new company&#x27;s president and CEO, while National Amusements CEO Shari Redstone would serve as chairperson. On October 29, 2019, National Amusements approved the re-merger deal; it closed on December 4, 2019. As part of the new structure, the Showtime Networks unit and its assets—Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix—became part of the Premium Content Group division of Paramount Media Networks, along with BET and temporarily Pop TV (which was transferred to the Youth &amp; Entertainment Group division the following month), to be overseen by SNI CEO David Nevins.

=== Flix On Demand ===

Flix On Demand is the channel&#x27;s subscription video-on-demand service; it is available to subscribers who receive the channel along with the other Showtime multiplex channels, though a few cable systems carry it as a free service that does not require a subscription as an inducement for customers to subscribe to the full Showtime suite of channels. Launched in 2005, Flix On Demand offers classic movies released between the 1950s and the 1990s, which are divided by category based on the decade of their release: 1950s and 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.

== Programming ==
=== Movie library ===
, Flix – through Showtime – maintains exclusive first-run film licensing agreements with Amblin Partners, IFC Films, A24, and Bleecker Street.

Flix also shows sub-runs – runs of films that have already received broadcast or syndicated television airings – of theatrical films distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing (all divisions, and including content from Revolution Studios and Morgan Creek Productions), Warner Bros. Pictures (including content from New Line Cinema), Universal Pictures (including content from subsidiaries Focus Features, Illumination Entertainment, and DreamWorks Animation), Open Road Films, Screen Media, Oscilloscope, Summit Entertainment (for films released prior to 2013), Paramount Pictures (for films released prior to 2017, and including content from MTV Films and Nickelodeon Movies), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (including content from subsidiaries United Artists and Orion Pictures), Lionsgate (sub-run rights with the latter two studios are for films released prior to 2009), and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (including content from Pixar Animation Studios, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Disney, Marvel Studios/Entertainment, Lucasfilm, and 20th Century Studios).

Many lesser-known film titles (particularly those released as independent films) that have either not received a theatrical release or were released on DVD or home video are also commonly broadcast on Flix. The window between a film&#x27;s initial release in theaters and its initial screening on Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix is wider than the grace period leading to a film&#x27;s initial broadcast on HBO, Cinemax or Starz. Films that Showtime has pay cable rights to will usually also run on Flix and The Movie Channel during the period of its term of licensing.

<doc id="655262" wikidata="Q2264751" url="?curid=655262" title="The Movie Channel">
<text>The Movie Channel (often abbreviated as TMC) is an American premium television network owned by Showtime Networks, a division of Paramount Global operated through its Paramount Media Networks division. Not including CBS, it is the oldest network owned by Paramount. The Movie Channel&#x27;s programming mainly features first-run theatrically released and independently produced motion pictures, and during promotional breaks between films, special behind-the-scenes features and movie trivia. Originally operated and sold as a standalone service (launching as Star Channel in April 1973), at present, The Movie Channel is receivable to pay television subscribers primarily as part of the multiplex tier of parent network Showtime. The channel, along with its parent network Showtime and sister network Flix, is headquartered at Paramount Plaza on the northern end of New York City&#x27;s Broadway district.

== History ==
=== Early history (1973–1979) ===
The Movie Channel traces its history to the development of Gridtronics, a pay television service which delivered videotaped feature films to cable systems throughout the United States. The concept was originally developed in the late 1960s by Alfred Stern and Gordon Fuqua, both executives at multiple system operator Television Communications Corporation (TVC) at the time, as part of a multi-channel service that was designed to include channels focusing on the arts, instructional programming and medical programs. The video-to-cable movie delivery concept was presented by Fuqua and Stern at the 1969 National Cable Television Association Convention. Over the course of the next several years, the two men subsequently discussed carriage agreements with other cable providers to distribute Gridtronics and engaged in discussions with various film studios to provide film content for the service. Following the creation of Dimension Pictures, TVC was purchased by Kinney National Company, the parent company of Dimension, in 1971, and gave the service the financial funding and content that it needed to launch.

Kinney National Company&#x27;s successor, Warner Communications, launched the Gridtronics service on April 1, 1973. Included among its initial offerings was the Warner Star Channel (later renamed Star Channel), a service developed as a vehicle to promote the Warner Bros. film library (notably excluding the pre-1950 film library that was owned by United Artists at the time). The channel was initially offered on systems operated by Warner Cable Communications (later Time Warner Cable), and was eventually made available on Warner-Amex&#x27;s experimental QUBE interactive service when the company launched it in 1977. Cable providers sometimes experienced technical problems trying to transmit the delivered tapes to viewers, especially when the tapes jammed during playback.

=== National expansion as The Movie Channel (1979–1983) ===
On January 1, 1979, Star Channel became a nationally distributed service after it was uplinked to satellite, becoming the third premium service to be distributed nationally through such a transmission method (after HBO, which was uplinked to satellite in September 1975, and Showtime, which was uplinked in March 1978). In April of that year, it began to share channel and transponder space with Warner Cable&#x27;s newly launched children&#x27;s network, Nickelodeon (an outgrowth of the company&#x27;s former QUBE channel C-3 programming service, which had &quot;Pinwheel&quot; as its flagship program); this resulted in the latter service switching to an encrypted signal during the regularly scheduled network transition at 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time on weekdays and 8:00 p.m. on weekends; Star Channel originally signed off at 4:00 am. Eastern and Pacific, three hours before the transponder space reverted to use by Nickelodeon. The channels were originally uplinked from a facility located next to WIVB-TV in Buffalo, New York; both later moved downstate to Hauppauge by 1981 (after a planned expansion to the Buffalo facility was scrapped following an inability to reach a long-term lease deal with WIVB&#x27;s ownership).

On September 14 of that year, American Express reached an agreement with Warner Communications to buy 50% of Warner Cable Corporation for $175 million in cash and short-term notes. Through the formation of the joint venture, which was incorporated in December 1979, Star Channel and Nickelodeon were folded into Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment (later Warner-Amex Cable Communications), a company which handled the operations of the group&#x27;s cable channels (Warner Cable was folded into a separate jointly owned unit, the Warner Cable Corporation). Warner-Amex executive John A. Schneider served as the company&#x27;s president; other Warner-Amex staff that manned Star/The Movie Channel&#x27;s initial management team included executive vice president John Lack, programming chief Robert Pittman, and Fred Seibert, who was in charge of developing on-air promotions.

On December 1, 1979, the network was relaunched as The Movie Channel; the first feature film to be broadcast on the relaunched service was the 1953 comedy &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;. On January 1, 1980, TMC discontinued its time-lease arrangement with Nickelodeon (then a sister network under the Warner, and later Viacom umbrellas) and became a 24-hour standalone service. At that point, TMC became the first premium channel to air R-rated films during the daytime hours (HBO continues to not air any R-rated films on its primary channel before 8:00 pm. Eastern and Pacific Time , except occasionally for films aired as part of its Sunday late-afternoon rebroadcast of the preceding Saturday&#x27;s prime time movie premiere; TMC sister network Showtime, Cinemax, and now-defunct rival Spotlight did not run R-rated films during the daytime hours at the time, the former two surviving services would not schedule them before prime time until the late 1980s/early 1990s while another now-defunct rival Home Theater Network never ran any R-rated films by mode of that service&#x27;s family-oriented format).

In 1981, The Movie Channel became one of the first television channels to broadcast movies in stereophonic audio; from that point until 1988, films presented in stereo were verbally and visually denoted in prime time lineup bumpers shown during promotional breaks within its daytime schedule – with titles for films available in stereo accompanied by the now-standard headphone symbol – and, until 1985, in a custom version of its feature presentation opening sequence (thereafter, films transmitted in the format were denoted along with the film rating during the latter open). As the standard for television broadcasts in stereo was a few years away, cable operators had to simulcast the multichannel audio feed through cable radio decoders using FM receivers. Interstitial segments that aired during breaks between films for much of the 1980s included &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; (featuring biographies and interviews with actors appearing in films set to air on the network or being released theatrically), &quot;The Heart of Hollywood&quot; (borrowing its name from the slogan that TMC used concurrently during the segment&#x27;s run from September 1985 to May 1988, and featuring more in-depth interviews with film stars), &quot;Reel Shorts&quot; (a showcase of live action and animated short films, which continued to air during extended breaks until 1991, by then under the &quot;Film Shorts&quot; moniker) and &quot;Reel Hits&quot; (featuring music videos for songs featured in films of that period and their accompanying soundtracks).

=== Operational merger with Showtime (1983–1985) ===
For much of its early years, The Movie Channel struggled in a race for subscribers in a pay television industry that pitted it against as many as seven cable-originated competitors, and even some over-the-air subscription services transmitted over independent stations in many U.S. cities such as ONTV and SelecTV. In addition to the launch of Cinemax as then-HBO parent Time Inc.&#x27;s movie-focused competitor to TMC in August 1980, the competition grew when Warner-Amex and Rainbow Media jointly launched the film and arts-focused Bravo (now a general entertainment basic cable channel, with a reality television focus) in September 1980; Walt Disney Productions threw itself into the fray when it announced plans in early 1982 to launch family-oriented Disney Channel, a service which made its debut in April 1983 (it is now a basic cable channel, focusing mainly on children&#x27;s programming).

In August 1982, MCA Inc. (then-owner of Universal Pictures), Gulf and Western Industries (then-owner of Paramount Pictures) and Warner Communications reached an agreement to jointly acquire TMC, under which the three companies would acquire a combined controlling 75% interest in the service (with each holding a 25% ownership stake) from Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment. The proposal was guided by the motive of the studios wanting to increase their revenue share for licensing movie rights to premium television services; there were also concerns by the major studios that HBO&#x27;s dominance of that market and its pre-buying of pay cable rights to films prior to their theatrical release would result in an undue balance of negotiating power over them by HBO, resulting in a lower than suitable licensing fee rate that would be paid to the distributors for individual titles. The three companies officially announced their agreement in principle to acquire interests in The Movie Channel on November 11, 1982. Subsequently, in late December of that year, the U.S. Department of Justice (which had blocked a similar attempt by MCA, Gulf+Western, 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures to create a competing pay service, Premiere, in an antitrust case ruling less than two years earlier in January 1981) launched a routine preliminary inquiry into the proposed partnership.

On January 7, 1983, Viacom International added itself as a partner and drafted an amendment to the proposal to consolidate The Movie Channel with the company&#x27;s own competing premium service, Showtime (which Viacom had wholly acquired in August 1982, after buying out Group W Cable&#x27;s 50% interest in Showtime for $75 million). Under the revised proposal, the four studios would each own a 22.58% stake in the two networks, with American Express owning a 9.68% minority interest. In addition, the consortium would appoint a management team separate from those employed by the two channels – which would continue to operate as separate services – to operate the joint venture. However, the deal ran into regulatory hurdles since Warner, Universal and Paramount received 50% of their respective total revenue from film releases and licensing fees from premium services; furthermore, Showtime and TMC combined would control about 30% of the pay cable marketplace, creating an oligopoly with HBO (which, in conjunction with Cinemax, controlled 60% of the market).

After a four-month investigation resulted in the Department of Justice filing a civil antitrust lawsuit against the five parties to block the Showtime-TMC merger on June 10, 1983, the Department asked Warner and American Express to restructure the deal during hearings for the case. The Department&#x27;s decision – citing concerns, including some expressed by HBO management, that combining the assets of Showtime and TMC would stifle competition in the sale of their programming and that of other pay cable services to cable providers – was despite the fact that, under the original proposal, MCA, Gulf+Western, and Warner had each agreed to continue licensing films released by their respective movie studios to competing pay television networks. The partners involved in the merger would also set standard prices for films that were acquired for broadcast on The Movie Channel and Showtime, either those produced by the studio partners or by unassociated film studios. To address the Justice Department&#x27;s concerns over the deal, the four partners submitted another revised proposal for consideration on July 19, that included guarantees of conduct agreeing that Paramount, Universal and Warner Bros. would not receive higher residual licensing payments for films acquired by Showtime and TMC than that paid by other studios, and that all four partners would not permit the two channels in the venture to pay lower fees for films produced by the three studio partners than that paid by smaller pay television services for the same films.

After the revised proposal was rejected on July 28, Warner Communications and American Express restructured the purchase to include only Viacom as a partner, bowing Gulf+Western and MCA out of the proposed partnership. The changes – which Justice Department officials acknowledged would &quot;prevent any anti-competitive effect from arising&quot; following the merger, by allowing other premium services to enter the market should the venture significantly raise licensing fee prices for films – led the Justice Department to drop its challenge to the merger agreement on August 12; the department formally approved the deal the following day on August 13. When the deal was completed on September 6, 1983, the operations of The Movie Channel and Showtime were folded into a new holding company, Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc., which was majority owned by Viacom (controlling 50% of the venture&#x27;s common stock as well as investing $40 million in cash), with Warner Communications (which owned 31%) and Warner-Amex (which owned the remaining 19% interest) as minority partners (the operational arrangement between The Movie Channel and Showtime is of a similar relationship to that between rival pay service Starz and its progenitor Starz Encore; as with Starz Encore to Starz, TMC operates as a secondary service to Showtime even though its launch, under the Star Channel brand, predates that of its parent network – Showtime launched on July 1, 1976 – by three years).

The Showtime-TMC joint venture also benefited The Movie Channel by allowing for the group to expand the channel&#x27;s distribution. On December 12, 1983, the Times-Mirror Company announced that it would sell the subscriber base and transponder rights assigned to competing premium service Spotlight to Showtime-The Movie Channel, Inc. for an undisclosed price. Under the agreement, the four cable providers that backed the Spotlight venture – Times Mirror Cable, Storer Cable, Cox Cable and Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) – would offer Spotlight subscribers who subscribe to any of the systems an option to subscribe to either Showtime or The Movie Channel as a replacement, with those dissatisfied with Showtime/TMC&#x27;s program offerings following a two-month sampling period during February and March permitted to exchange it for another premium channel at no charge. After Spotlight ceased operations on February 1, 1984, Spotlight subscribers who subscribed to any of the participating systems began to automatically receive The Movie Channel in markets where a provider was already carrying Showtime. (In select Spotlight markets, Showtime was added to the provider as a replacement instead if neither service had been carried prior.) Showtime-The Movie Channel President Michael Weinblatt estimated that approximately 100,000 subscribers of the four partner systems already received either Showtime or TMC, and that the absorption of Spotlight would increase the total number of paid subscribers to both channels by at least 650,000 to about eight million subscribers nationwide.

=== Transfer to Viacom (1985–2005) ===
On August 10, 1985, after Time Inc. and cable provider Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) jointly submitted a bid to buy the company for $900 million and the assumption of $500 million in debt as well as an earlier offer by American Express the previous month to buy out Warner&#x27;s share of the company (under a clause in the agreement that allowed either company the option of buying out their partner&#x27;s stake in Warner-Amex), Warner Communications exercised an option to acquire American Express&#x27; 50% share of Warner-Amex Cable Communications for $450 million. Among the options, barring that it chose to sell Viacom a 50% interest in the company for $450 million, the deal originally excluded Warner-Amex&#x27;s 19% interest in Showtime-The Movie Channel, Inc.; that interest would have reverted to Warner, which intended to operate Warner-Amex as a wholly owned subsidiary.

Two weeks later on August 26, Viacom acquired Warner Communications and Warner-Amex&#x27;s combined 50% ownership interest in Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc. as well as full ownership of Warner-Amex and the public shareholder interests in MTV Networks for $671.7 million. This gave Viacom exclusive ownership of both premium channels through its $500 million cash payment and acquisition of 1.625 million shares for Warner&#x27;s 31% stake in Showtime/The Movie Channel, and Warner-Amex&#x27;s 19% interest in the unit and its 60% interest in MTV Networks (Viacom had owned Showtime alone or jointly with other companies – previously in ventures with TelePrompTer Corporation, and later briefly, its successor Group W Cable – from the time it launched in July 1976). The buyout, part of an option given by Warner in its purchase of American Express&#x27; interest in MTV, was exercised in part to finance much of the buyout of Showtime/The Movie Channel without borrowing any money. The subsidiary would eventually be renamed Showtime Networks, Inc. in 1988. Ironically, four years after the company sold its interests in Showtime and The Movie Channel, Warner Communications would acquire competitors HBO and Cinemax, when the company merged with Time Inc. in 1989 to form Time Warner.

In May 1986, TMC began incorporating regular on-air hosts to present the channel&#x27;s afternoon and evening film presentations, and provide backstory on the production of those scheduled to be shown; the channel began using hosts on a regular basis after employing celebrity guest presenters to host special showcase stunts in the fall of 1985 (The Movie Channel would continue to feature guest hosts, such as Ron Howard, Daphne Zuniga, Shirley Jones and Frank Zappa, for programming stunts through much of the late 1980s after it hired full-time presenters). Hosts appearing on the channel between the late 1980s and the mid-1990s included Robert Osborne (then also working as a columnist for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, and who also hosted the channel&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Hollywood&quot; behind-the-scenes and interview interstitials), Michelle Russell, Lauren Graham and Joe Bob Briggs (the pseudonym of actor and film critic John Irving Bloom, and host of the popular Saturday evening B-movie showcase &quot;Joe Bob&#x27;s Drive-In Theater&quot;).

==== Format evolution and carriage issues ====

The Movie Channel underwent a significant rebranding on May 1, 1988, which in addition to introducing a new &quot;eye and profile&quot; logo designed by Noel Frankel of Fred/Alan, Inc., also saw the introduction of a revamped programming schedule designed to cater to movie fans, maintaining a block scheduling structure for its entire film lineup that was organized by genre or film selection; among the blocks included were the &quot;TMC Classic&quot;, a weekday morning and Sunday overnight block of films from the 1930s to the 1960s; &quot;Dramarama&quot;, a weekday late-morning block of drama films; &quot;The Laffternoon Movie&quot;, a weekday late-afternoon block of comedy films; and two action film-focused blocks (the &quot;Action Attraction&quot;, which aired Monday through Fridays in the mid-afternoon, and the weekly prime time showcase &quot;Friday Night Action&quot;).

The most distinct block was the &quot;Weekend Multiplex&quot;, featuring a set lineup of different movies aired in a scheduling format inspired by movie theaters, comprising a main daytime block on Saturdays and Sundays, seven individual prime time blocks on Friday through Sunday evenings (encompassing three per night between 7:00 p.m. and 1:00 am. Eastern and Pacific Time) and themed editions of the existing &quot;VCR Overnight&quot; block (including the &quot;All Night Drive-In&quot; – a spin-off of &quot;Joe Bob&#x27;s Drive-In Theater&quot; – on Fridays, film marathons on Saturdays and the Sunday edition of &quot;TMC Classics&quot;). The centerpiece of the &quot;Weekend Multiplex&quot; was the &quot;TMC Top Attraction&quot;, a film making its premiere on the channel that was scheduled at different, progressively earlier time slots each evening throughout the weekend. With the exception of &quot;Joe Bob&#x27;s Drive-In Theater&quot; (which remained on Saturday nights until it was discontinued in February 1996) and the &quot;VCR Overnight&quot; block (which was reduced to Wednesday overnights only in 1997), most of these blocks were discontinued in May 1991.

With the scheduling revamp, TMC greatly increased the number of films it aired on a monthly basis, from about 40 to more than 100 titles per month, with the addition of older films to the slate (which were presented without colorization, in direct contrast to Cinemax, which at the time had aired remastered color versions of some classic films on its schedule). In addition, TMC began incorporating trailers for current and upcoming feature films released initially for theatrical exhibition, which aired during promotional breaks between films until 1997. It also began airing a 15-second daily entertainment news interstitial focusing on the film industry, &quot;The Movie Channel News&quot;, featuring stories read by a continuity announcer – which varied depending on the segment – over a segment title graphic; the segment would be discontinued in May 1991.

Although extended promotional breaks were shown in a somewhat limited form beforehand, partially as a result of the changes that occurred in 1988, breaks between individual feature presentations on the channel sometimes ran as long as 20 minutes, and even up to 25 minutes in rare cases, depending on the scheduled airtime of the next film (which was denoted on a minute-based countdown ticker graphic that persisted within breaks from May 1988 to August 1997; Showtime would implement a similar countdown graphic for the next scheduled program as part of a branding update in January 1990, which that network would discontinue following its August 1997 rebrand). The Movie Channel temporarily truncated the length of its promotional breaks to five minutes or less in an on-air strategical test during February and March 1993, dispensing of fixed start times at the top and bottom of the hour – at which most of TMC&#x27;s weekday daytime film telecasts had been scheduled, along with some films aired in other dayparts, since the 1988 format revamp – in favor of airtimes set at top-of-the-hour, bottom-of-the-hour and random five-minute intervals regardless of daypart. After results from the test measured an increase in audience retention for other films with the strategy, the channel instituted the limited break lengths on a regular basis in August of that year; TMC abandoned the break limits in 1997. The break limits imposed by the channel resulted in TMC reducing the number of internally produced interstitial segments that it aired during promotional breaks, with interstitials airing over the next four years consisting mainly of trailers and shorter-length behind-the-scenes segments for upcoming and current films produced by their originating studios.

On March 1, 1994, The Movie Channel and Showtime in conjunction with rivals HBO and Cinemax implemented a cooperative content advisory system to provide to parents specific information about pay-cable programming content that may be unsuitable for their children; the development of the system—inspired by the advisory ratings featured in program guides distributed by the major premium cable services—was in response to concerns from parents and advocacy groups about violent content on television, allowing Showtime Networks and other premium services discretionary authority to assign individual ratings corresponding to the objectionable content depicted in specific programs (and categorized based on violence, profanity, sexuality or miscellaneous mature material). A revised system—centered around ten content codes of two to three letters in length—was implemented by TMC and the other participating premium services on June 10, 1994.

Although TMC was carried by most subscription television providers, there were some that did not have agreements to carry the channel, even if they already carried Showtime. As an example, now-defunct satellite provider PrimeStar never carried The Movie Channel; weeks after it announced a new carriage agreement with Viacom in January 1999 that would have resulted in the channel joining the provider&#x27;s lineup, PrimeStar sold its assets to Hughes Communications (then-owners of competitor DirecTV, which would neither carry Viacom&#x27;s premium and basic-tier services nor Time Warner&#x27;s premium channels until its 1999 acquisition of United States Satellite Broadcasting). In May 1994, TCI dropped The Movie Channel from more than 30 of the cable provider&#x27;s service markets. At the time, Viacom was in the midst of an antitrust lawsuit against TCI on accusations that the provider engaged in a &quot;conspiracy to eliminate&quot; Showtime and its sister channels (including TMC) and pressuring Viacom to settle its lawsuit through the negotiation of a carriage contract with the media company that expired in January 1993; Viacom reportedly stated that TCI threatened to hurt both Showtime and TMC unless Viacom agreed to purchase an ownership stake in Encore (now Starz Encore), a network which Viacom claimed to have first conceptually conceived four years earlier during negotiations between the two companies that, if they had been successful, would have resulted in TCI purchasing 50% of Showtime Networks. Representatives for the affected TCI systems said that the decision to remove The Movie Channel from their lineups was made at the local level and was not a directive by company management. Viacom and TCI settled the Showtime Networks distribution dispute in January 1995, preceding the former&#x27;s $2.3-billion sale of its Viacom Cablevision systems to TCI affiliate company Intermedia Partners.

In August 1997, TMC underwent an extensive rebranding effort that resulted in the channel briefly premiering its own original movies (which were produced through Showtime&#x27;s original programming division), along with increasing reliance on action and comedy films that Showtime had started to deemphasize as part of its shift toward more &quot;high-minded&quot; original made-for-cable films and series. The channel also added daily movie marathons, aired without a set schedule and with the number of titles varying day-to-day, that were set around a specific theme; a companion weekend-long programming stunt scheduled once a month, the &quot;Double Vision Weekend&quot;, built on the daily marathon format, comprising multiple themed mini-marathons scheduled over all three days of the event. Building on the slogan it adopted with the rebrand (&quot;100% Pure Movies, 100% Pure Fun&quot;), the 1994 Crystal Waters single &quot;100% Pure Love&quot; was sampled for use in network IDs and prime time schedule previews as well as a nightclub-themed &quot;dream sequence&quot; image promo (which quoted an April 1997 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; television review referring to its then-recent programming changes as having &quot;transform[ed it] into the party girl of the Viacom family.&quot;) In addition, TMC also started running movie and celebrity trivia segments during promotional breaks (originally known as &quot;TMC Fun Facts&quot; and later &quot;TMC Reel Stuff&quot;), along with incorporating trivia during promos for movies that were scheduled to air on the channel (the channel had previously aired trivia segments between 1988 and 1991). In October of that year, The Movie Channel launched a secondary service, The Movie Channel 2 (renamed The Movie Channel Xtra in March 2001), which is the only multiplex channel to be launched by the service.

In March 2001, The Movie Channel began premiering movies that did not previously receive a theatrical, home video or DVD release, under the umbrella brand &quot;TMC First-Run Movies&quot;. It also began airing softcore pornographic films during late night time periods. The channel also debuted a series of two-minute sketches called &quot;The Pitch&quot;, starring character actor Sean Smith as a movie executive who listens as prospective playwrights pitch him ideas for films (the segment was tongue-in-cheek in nature as the pitches were for well-known existing feature films such as &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; and &quot;The Terminator&quot;).

=== Under CBS Corporation ownership (2005–2019) ===
On June 14, 2005, only five years after the company completed its $2.4-billion acquisition of the original CBS Corporation, Viacom announced that it would split its holdings into two separate media companies, citing concerns by management over stagnation of the principal company&#x27;s stock price; both companies would be controlled by National Amusements, the Sumner Redstone-owned media and real estate holding company that had owned Viacom since 1976. When the split was completed on December 31, 2005, the original Viacom was restructured as the second CBS Corporation, which retained ownership of Showtime Networks; CBS&#x27; broadcast television and radio assets (including the CBS television network, UPN (which was replaced by The CW in September 2006) and the company&#x27;s broadcast group, which became CBS Television Stations); Paramount Television (now the separate arms CBS Studios for network and pay-TV production, and CBS Media Ventures for production of first-run syndicated programs and off-network series distribution); advertising firm Viacom Outdoor (renamed CBS Outdoor); publishing firm Simon &amp; Schuster; and amusement park operator Paramount Parks (which was later sold to Cedar Fair, L.P. on June 30, 2006). The newly incorporated spin-off company, which assumed the Viacom name, attained ownership of Paramount Pictures, the MTV Networks and BET Networks pay-TV divisions, and Famous Music (the latter of which was sold to Sony-ATV Music Publishing in May 2007).

On May 3, 2006, The Movie Channel adopted an overhauled on-air look including a new logo and slogan (&quot;Movies For Movie Lovers&quot;). Bumpers that introduced films were discontinued entirely (instead starting the film with the customary intermediate bumper providing rating and content information). The channel&#x27;s website – which only featured a programming schedule with up to one month of data in advance – was also revamped with the addition of special features including an online store, a streaming video player and previews of films set to air on the channel (TMC still features movie trivia interstitials between films on the linear channels and on its video-on-demand service, though it directs viewers to the channel&#x27;s website for answers to the trivia questions).

=== Re-merger with Viacom (2019–present) ===
On August 13, 2019, it was officially announced that CBS and Viacom would merge into a new entity known as ViacomCBS. Viacom CEO Bob Bakish would serve as president and CEO of the new company, while Ianniello would become chairman and CEO of CBS and oversee CBS-branded assets. Shari Redstone will also serve as chairwoman of ViacomCBS. On October 29, 2019, National Amusements approved the re-merger deal. It closed on December 4, 2019. As part of the new structure, Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix became part of the Premium Content Group division of ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks, along with BET and Pop TV, to be overseen by SNI CEO David Nevins. On February 16, 2022, ViacomCBS renamed itself to Paramount Global; the company&#x27;s U.S. cable networks unit became Paramount Media Networks on the same day.

== Channels ==
=== List of channels ===
Depending on the service provider, The Movie Channel provides up to four multiplex channels – two 24-hour multiplex channels, both of which are simulcast in both standard definition and high definition – as well as a subscription video-on-demand service (The Movie Channel On Demand). The Movie Channel and multiplex service The Movie Channel Xtra respectively broadcast on both Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The individual coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together, resulting in the difference in local airtimes for a particular movie telecast between two geographic locations being three hours at most. Most subscription providers, however, only offer the east and west coast feeds of TMC&#x27;s main channel and one coastal feed of TMC Xtra applicable to a particular region (the Eastern Time Zone feed in areas from the Central Time Zone eastward or the Pacific feed in areas from the Mountain Time Zone westward); some providers only offer the coastal feeds of the primary channel and TMC Xtra applicable to their region.

Showtime and Flix, which are also owned by ViacomCBS, operate as separate services. Although The Movie Channel is frequently sold together in a package with Showtime, TMC subscribers do not necessarily have to subscribe to the other two services. Prior to the advent of digital cable, many providers often sold The Movie Channel separately from Showtime, continuing for about two decades after Viacom acquired both Warner Communications and Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment&#x27;s respective ownership interests of the two previously autonomous services in 1985. Showtime began offering all of its channels, including TMC, Flix and Sundance Channel (now AMC Networks-owned SundanceTV), in a single package by the early 2000s; this resulted in most providers (with the exception of Comcast, DirecTV and Dish Network) ceasing to sell or promote The Movie Channel separately from Showtime (Dish Network and DirecTV offer both TMC and TMC Xtra optionally as either a package with the remainder of the Showtime multiplex, or as part of a separate movie tier to subscribers that do not already have Showtime; both The Movie Channel and Starz Encore are the only American premium channels to be offered to subscribers that do not subscribe to their co-owned premium services).

Although one or both of the channels have traditionally been carried alongside the Showtime multiplex channels on traditional pay television providers, , The Movie Channel as well as Flix are not presently carried as live feeds on Paramount+&#x27;s premium tier (nor was it ever available on Showtime&#x27;s defunct direct-to-consumer service and TV Everywhere platform Showtime Anytime, all of which only offer the Eastern and Pacific feeds of the main Showtime channel); the Paramount+ add-ons (and the predecessor Showtime aggregated OTT add-ons) sold through Apple TV Channels, Amazon Video Channels, The Roku Channel and YouTube Primetime Channels; or the Showtime add-ons sold through over-the-top subscription television services (including Hulu Live TV, Sling TV, DirecTV Stream, YouTube TV and Philo).

==== The Movie Channel HD ====
The Movie Channel HD is a high definition simulcast feed of The Movie Channel that broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format, and was launched on December 1, 2003. Most American subscription providers carry this simulcast.
==== The Movie Channel On Demand ====
The Movie Channel operates a subscription video-on-demand television service, The Movie Channel on Demand, which is available at no additional charge to new and existing subscribers of TMC. The service launched on December 1, 2003, with a subscriber base of two million homes. The Movie Channel On Demand offers program content available in standard or high definition categorized by four individual genres: action and adventure films, dramas, comedies and softcore pornographic films. It also offers special feature content consisting of film trivia and behind-the-scenes features including interviews. The Movie Channel on Demand&#x27;s rotating program selection incorporates select new titles that are added each Friday, alongside existing program titles held over from the previous one to two weeks.

=== Movie library ===
, The Movie Channel – through Showtime – maintains exclusive first-run film licensing agreements with Amblin Partners (including releases produced in conjunction with DreamWorks Pictures and Participant), IFC Films, A24, and Bleecker Street.

The Movie Channel also shows sub-runs – runs of films that have already received broadcast or syndicated television airings – of theatrical films distributed by Sony Pictures (including content from Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures, Screen Gems, Revolution Studios and Morgan Creek Productions), Warner Bros. Pictures (including content from New Line Cinema), Universal Pictures (including content from subsidiary Focus Features), Open Road Films, Screen Media, Oscilloscope, Summit Entertainment (for films released prior to 2013), Paramount Pictures (for films released prior to 2017), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (including content from subsidiaries United Artists and Orion Pictures), Lionsgate (sub-run rights with the latter two studios are for films released prior to 2009), and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (including content from Pixar, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Walt Disney Pictures, 20th Century Studios, Touchstone Pictures, Hollywood Pictures, and Marvel Studios).

Many lesser-known film titles (particularly those released as independent films) that have either not received a theatrical release or were released on DVD or home video are also commonly broadcast on TMC. The window between a film&#x27;s initial release in theaters and its initial screening on Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix is wider than the grace period leading to a film&#x27;s initial broadcast on HBO, Cinemax or Starz. Films to which Showtime holds the pay-TV rights will usually also run on The Movie Channel and sister channel Flix during the period of its term of licensing.

=== Programming blocks ===
==== Current ====
* Splatterday: In May 2006, The Movie Channel introduced a weekly block called &quot;Splatterday on Saturday&quot; (also known as simply &quot;Splatterday&quot;). The block – which airs on the main channel each Saturday night starting at 9:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time, with an encore presentation of the entire block airing the following Friday evening at 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific on The Movie Channel Xtra – is a double feature of horror movies; the two films that air in that week&#x27;s initial late evening block are rebroadcast on TMC&#x27;s primary channel following the conclusion of the second film. From the block&#x27;s debut until late 2008, the &quot;Splatterday&quot; lineup also included repeats of the now-defunct Showtime anthology series &quot;Masters of Horror&quot;, which is the only television series to have aired on The Movie Channel to date.
* The Good Stuff: The Movie Channel introduced a weeknight block called &quot;The Good Stuff&quot; in May 2006, showcasing critically acclaimed theatrical and independent films as part of its late night schedule, usually airing around 12:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time.

==== Former ====
* Midnight Madness: Running from 1983 to 1988, the block originated as &quot;The Saturday Special&quot;, a showcase of comedy and musical films that originally aired on Saturday late nights at 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The block, maintaining the same format and time slot, was renamed &quot;Friday Movie Madness&quot; upon its move to Fridays in May 1984, before being renamed &quot;Midnight Madness&quot; in September 1985.
* Joe Bob&#x27;s Drive-In Theater: Originally debuting in January 1984 as &quot;The Movie Channel&#x27;s Drive-In Theater&quot; and airing on Fridays in late prime time, the weekly double feature showcase presented a mix of cult films, B movies and some exploitation films. In January 1986, the program was moved to Saturday nights with the appointment of a regular host, Joe Bob Briggs (the alter ego of actor and film critic John Bloom, who was asked by TMC management to portray his Texan redneck character – standardly donning cowboy attire and a ten-gallon hat – for a guest hosting role on the program, after gaining notice through his one-man comedic stage show &quot;An Evening with Joe Bob Briggs&quot;, later retitled &quot;Joe Bob Dead in Concert&quot;). Each of the features presented on the retitled &quot;Joe Bob&#x27;s Drive-In Theater&quot; were bookended by taped wraparound segments that featured Bloom building upon the persona he cultivated in his syndicated newspaper column and stage show, and incorporated many recurring gags from Briggs&#x27; unique way of introducing movies (featuring a summary of the amount of violence and nudity included in the films being showcased [i.e. &quot;three dead bodies, six naked breasts...&quot;], with nouns suffixed with &quot;-fu&quot; often being used to refer to objects featured in fight scenes) to colorful tales that often dealt with romantic troubles and brushes with the law that involved him rushing to see a film at a local drive-in. He also read letters from viewers on the air, who often requested specific movies to be aired, some of which were ultimately chosen to be featured on the broadcast. As Briggs, Bloom also closed each edition with the signoff, &quot;this is Joe Bob Briggs, reminding you that the drive-in will never die&quot;. Bloom&#x27;s work as the Joe Bob character also extended to roles as host of The Movie Channel&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Madness&quot; block during the second half of the 1980s, and for an extension of the &quot;Drive-In Theater&quot;, the &quot;All-Night Drive-In&quot;, which aired on Fridays from May 1988 to May 1991 as part of the &quot;VCR Overnight&quot; block. After &quot;Joe Bob&#x27;s Drive-In Theater&quot; ended its ten-year run on TMC on February 24, 1996, Bloom would reprise the Joe Bob Briggs character as host of TNT&#x27;s horror film block &quot;MonsterVision&quot; from 1997 to 2000.
* Salute to the Academy Awards: The Movie Channel aired the &quot;Salute to the Academy Awards&quot; (a month-long block similar to the present-day &quot;31 Days of Oscar&quot; annual lineup on Turner Classic Movies) from 1984 to 1997, which ran during the month proceeding the Academy Awards. It featured movies that have won or earned nominations for Academy Awards in various film and acting categories, with one Oscar-winning or Oscar-nominated film airing each evening.
* Tuesday Film Festival: Running from 1985 to 1987, the &quot;Tuesday Film Festival&quot; block was a prime time showcase of critically acclaimed feature films that aired on Tuesday evenings at 8:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time.
* VCR Theater/VCR Overnite/TMC Overnight: The channel launched a weekly feature called &quot;The Movie Channel&#x27;s VCR Theater&quot; in June 1986, which originally aired nightly at 3:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. The block was created in response to the rise in consumer ownership of VCRs (particularly among the channel&#x27;s subscriber base) during the 1980s. The films featured were selected for the convenience of subscribers wanting to videotape a movie of particular interest while they are asleep to watch at a later time of their choosing (the overnight time slot was chosen because of the technical limitations with VCRs that prevented cable and satellite subscribers from watching one program and recording another simultaneously in the pre-digital video recorder era). The block was renamed &quot;VCR Overnite&quot; in 1988, at which point, it expanded to include three extended blocks: the &quot;All-Night Drive-In&quot; (a spin-off of &quot;Joe Bob&#x27;s Drive-In Theater&quot;) on Fridays, the &quot;Movie Marathon&quot; on Saturdays and &quot;TMC Classics&quot; on Sundays; these full-overnight weekend blocks were discontinued in 1991. The block was reduced to a weekly airing on early Wednesday mornings in 1997 as &quot;TMC Overnight&quot;; this iteration of the block lasted until 2004.
* TMC Top Attraction: This block, which ran from May 1988 to May 1991, was based around a featured movie title making its TMC debut that was initially showcased each Friday night at 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The &quot;Top Attraction&quot; also included encore presentations of that week&#x27;s premiere film that progressively aired two hours earlier from the prior prime time telecast on Saturday (at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time) and Sunday evenings (at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time).
* The Movie Channel&#x27;s Weekend [at the] Multiplex: Running from May 1988 to May 1991, the &quot;Weekend Multiplex&quot; was a weekend-long umbrella block that was primarily centered around several distinct themed film blocks during prime time on Friday through Sundays starting at 7:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. Joined alongside the &quot;Top Attraction&quot; and &quot;Joe Bob&#x27;s Drive-In Theater&quot; as part of the lineup were the &quot;TGIF Movie&quot; (a Friday early evening showcase featuring lighter film fare), &quot;Friday Night Action&quot; (a weekly showcase of action films), &quot;The Early Show&quot; (featuring a different feature film on Saturday early evenings), the &quot;Sunday Star Movie&quot; (a prime time feature movie) and &quot;Critics&#x27; Choice&quot; (a Sunday late-evening showcase of critically acclaimed feature films). The lineup also encompassed a daytime lineup with films scheduled at less fixed airtimes – in contrast to the scheduling format adopted at the time of the May 1988 rebrand for its weekday daytime and daily nighttime programming – akin to the scheduling used by movie theaters and full late-night themed editions of &quot;VCR Overnite&quot;.
* The Movie Channel Challenge: Running each August from 1990 to 1997, &quot;The Movie Channel Challenge&quot; was a month-long summer programming stunt – inspired by the &quot;no-repeat weekends&quot; music playlist stunts used on many radio stations – that featured a lineup of approximately 420 movies, none of which were repeated during the course of that month. The festival was developed to address a consumer complaint common with premium services like The Movie Channel, in avoiding repeat showings of select films on multiple dates and time slots during the calendar month – effectively quadrupling the number of movies that most pay services typically aired in a given month (TMC&#x27;s film lineup normally averages around 100 movies per month) – and to attract potential subscribers to and increase consumer awareness of TMC (at the time the festival began, The Movie Channel had approximately 2.5 million subscribers, one-third that of sister network Showtime, which had 8.5 million). Individual marathon-style festivals consisting of a set of movies starring a particular actor or focusing on a certain film genre (similar to those later featured as part of the &quot;TMC Marathons/Double Vision Weekends&quot; blocks) would be aired at various points during the period.
* Tuesday Night Terrors: In May 1991, The Movie Channel introduced &quot;Tuesday Night Terrors&quot;, a weekly block of horror films (similar in format to the present-day &quot;Splatterday on Saturday&quot; block) that aired on Tuesday nights at 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time; the block was discontinued in August 1997.
* The Movie Channel Marathons: In February 1996, TMC started airing movie marathons seven days a week, featuring three, or sometimes four, films that were tied to a specific subject (such as &quot;Ouch&quot; for crime dramas, or &quot;The Eyes Have It&quot; for films with the word &quot;eyes&quot; in their title such as &quot;Night Eyes 3&quot;) or actor (such as &quot;Omar Goodness&quot; for movies starring Omar Epps). These themed marathons were discontinued on March 2, 2006.
* TMC Double Vision Weekends: In conjunction with the daily marathons, The Movie Channel ran a special extended marathon-style lineup, the &quot;Double Vision Weekend&quot;, on a bi-monthly basis beginning in August 1997. These three-day long blocks featured three different movies starring a particular actor or actress within various mini-marathon block, with a new themed set of films airing after the conclusion of the previous block. The &quot;Double Vision Weekend&quot; lineup ran throughout the daytime and evening hours each day during the Friday through Sunday period in which it was scheduled, typically encompassing a larger portion of the schedule than that of the channel&#x27;s standard &quot;TMC Marathons&quot; blocks (the daily marathon lineups ran during the afternoon and/or evening hours). The &quot;Double Vision Weekend&quot; blocks were discontinued in May 2006, along with the daily film marathons.

===== Showtime After Hours =====
A signature feature of Showtime was a late-night block known as Showtime After Hours, which featured softcore pornographic films and original series. Showtime did not have set start or end times for the block, as they varied depending on the mainstream feature films – and original series on certain nights – that aired prior to and following it, and also depended on the number of programs and programs in particular that were scheduled to air within the block. Programs that aired under the Showtime After Hours banner carried either a TV-MA or R rating (usually the former), primarily for strong sexual content and nudity. The block had often been the subject of both scrutiny in the media and a source of humor in popular culture, with references to Showtime&#x27;s late night programming being featured in various films and television shows.

== Branding ==
Over the years, TMC has used a myriad of unique, and sometimes bizarre logos and promotional concepts. The channel&#x27;s original logo under the &quot;Movie Channel&quot; name incorporated a star outline made up of film strips with folded sides, indirectly referencing its previous identity as Star Channel. In 1981, the text for the network&#x27;s name changed from the Broadway typeface to a stylized all-uppercase font (with a slightly enlarged letter &quot;M&quot;) augmented to the left and underside of the star. Beginning in 1983, the network alternately used a script logo (which varied slightly in style, depending on the promo or network ID it was displayed in), sometimes more often than its &quot;star&quot; logo. Promos using the &quot;script&quot; logo were aired on the network up until the 1988 rebrand, although they were used less frequently from the summer of 1985 as the &quot;star&quot; logo was phased back to universal use within TMC&#x27;s on-air imaging. Between 1985 and 1988, TMC began airing somewhat clever graphics for their time such as a &quot;tour of Hollywood&quot; introduction for its film presentations, which closed with a shot of the Hollywood skyline with a faint heart outline in the middle of the sky.

On May 1, 1988, The Movie Channel debuted its &quot;eye and profile&quot; logo, which used various designs incorporating facial expressions, with the channel&#x27;s name rendered in Helvetica Extended on tilted black bars at the top and bottom of the logo; some viewers have commented on online blogs and video websites such as YouTube that this logo, due to the eyes being prominently displayed, had frightened them as young children (this logo was replicated somewhat when WGN America used a logo featuring a set of female eyes rimmed with green mascara from 2008 to 2009). The channel ran different and unique feature presentation opens and network IDs during the nine-year period it was in use (among which included intros in which the logo changed facial expressions at the draw of a curtain, set to a bouncy keyboard tune; a grayscale version of the logo – which then winked – rotating to face the screen in front of a gray background accompanied by a steady drumbeat; and a live-action/partially computer-animated sequence set to &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;-style adventure music in which the logo shoots lasers from its eyes to escape from the newspaper it is printed on – which is set afire as kindling in a fireplace – and embarks on a calamity-filled journey through a family&#x27;s living room, seen from its point of view, as it heads toward the safety of a TV set it rappels into on a cable hooked up to a wall outlet above the fireplace&#x27;s mantle).
TMC adopted a very slick on-air look that predominantly used CGI graphics, with the debut of a new logo in August 1997, a 3D computer-animated green sphere with a tilted and lowercase &quot;tmc&quot; imprinted on it, usually shown either to the right of the channel&#x27;s full name or above the name (also rendered in lowercase type). Jeff Bottoms (who has since become The Movie Channel&#x27;s longest-serving promo announcer, and also does promotions for sister channel Showtime) promoted upcoming programs between films with humorous and tongue-in-cheek voiceovers. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, The Movie Channel started running a wide variety of network promotions from those akin to a movie trailer to typical promos that feature behind-the-scenes trivia relating to the film. The latter technique continued to be used by the channel – often in a more hybrid way – until the fall of 2015, when the Showtime Networks services began deemphasizing the use of voiceovers in on-air promotions, at which point film promotions shown during breaks switched to using trailers accompanied by the channel&#x27;s standard title/timeslot card.

An extensively modified logo was introduced on March 5, 2001, featuring a one-dimensional circle with a lowercase &quot;tmc&quot; in Knockout type on it, surrounded with two lines on the corners framing the circle; the &quot;movie&quot; in the channel&#x27;s name was rendered in bold. The Movie Channel&#x27;s current logo was introduced on May 3, 2006, featuring three colored crescent-like sections in a circle framing the channel&#x27;s name, rendered in the same Helvetica typeface variant used in the 1988–1997 logo. Online film reviewers were incorporated into promos for films to provide backstory on the movie at this point. On April 1, 2010, The Movie Channel and TMC Xtra began displaying digital on-screen graphic logos of the respective channels during its programming; the bug seen is an alternate version of the channel&#x27;s logo with &quot;The Movie Channel&quot; name oriented in vertically stacked text.

<doc id="655266" wikidata="Q4949127" url="?curid=655266" title="Bottom crawler">
<text>A bottom crawler is an underwater exploration and recovery vehicle. It is designed to sink to the bottom of a body of water, where it moves about using traction against the bottom with wheels or tracks. It is usually tethered to a surface ship by cables providing power, control, video, and lifting capabilities, but this is not essential.

Such devices have been proposed for use in recovering deep seabed minerals, such as manganese nodules.

These also have been considered since the late 1960s for use in offshore oil exploration and production in extremely deep water, but practical devices have used other technologies from the sea surface, such as moored barges and tension leg platforms.

<doc id="655270" wikidata="Q4955745" url="?curid=655270" title="Brain Cell Repulsion">
<text>Brain Cell Repulsion is a mail art project begun by Ryosuke Cohen in June 1985. The project is a networked art project where individual artists contribute stamps, stickers, drawings or other images. These are sent through the mail to Cohen, who assembles and prints them as part of each cell. He prints 150 copies (30 x 42 cm) with a small silkscreen system called a Cyclostyle (now out of production). Each participant is mailed a Brain Cell print along with a documentation list of contributors worldwide.

Cohen keeps a copy for himself. Some of the remaining Brain Cell prints from each edition are assembled into sets of 30 consecutive editions. These set are sent to artists and Mail Art shows around the world.

Cohen also uses Brain Cell prints in the Fractal Portrait Project (another long running art series by Cohen) and as additions to Mail Art Add and Pass pages.

New Brain Cell editions are published every eight to ten days. More than nine hundred editions have been published.

Cohen described the origin of the project&#x27;s name in 1985: &quot;Well, I&#x27;ll title my work &#x27;Brain Cell&#x27;, because the structure of a brain through a microscope looks like the diagram of the Mail Art network. Thousands of Neurons clung and piled up together are just like the Mail Art network, I believe.&quot;

Brain Cell is an art experiment in the vein of networked mail art, where a network expands from A, copied, forwarded and even returned to the originator. This produces a series of cybernetic cells, which can interact in a non-linear order. Brain Cell enlisted over 6,000 contributors from 80 nations between 1985 and 2002. 

More than 1200 different Brain Cell prints have been created (Brain Cell nr 1232 was issued in January 2025).

It has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America, and in some areas has become invasive. It is also known as common tansy, bitter buttons, cow bitter, or golden buttons. The Latin word &quot;vulgare&quot; means &quot;common&quot;.

==Description==


Tansy is a flowering herbaceous plant with finely divided compound leaves and yellow, button-like flowers. It has a stout, somewhat reddish, erect stem, usually smooth, tall, and branching near the top. The leaves are alternate, long and are pinnately lobed, divided almost to the center into about seven pairs of segments, or lobes, which are again divided into smaller lobes having saw-toothed edges, giving the leaf a somewhat fern-like appearance. The roundish, flat-topped, button-like, yellow flower heads are produced in terminal clusters from mid-to-late summer. The scent is similar to that of camphor with hints of rosemary. The leaves and flowers are toxic if consumed in large quantities; the volatile oil contains toxic compounds including thujone, which can cause convulsions and liver and brain damage. Some insects, notably the tansy beetle &quot;Chrysolina graminis&quot;, have resistance to the toxins and subsist almost exclusively on the plant.

==History and distribution==
Tansy is native to Eurasia; it is found in almost all parts of mainland Europe, as well as Britain and Ireland. It is absent from Siberia and from some of the Mediterranean islands. The ancient Greeks may have been the first to cultivate it as a medicinal herb. In the sixteenth century it was considered to be &quot;necessary for a garden&quot; in England.

===History of uses===
Tansy has a long history of use. The first historical records of its cultivation for medicinal purposes involved the ancient Greeks. In the 8th century AD it was grown in the herb gardens of Charlemagne and by Benedictine monks of the Swiss monastery of Saint Gall. Tansy was used to treat intestinal worms, rheumatism, digestive problems, fevers, sores, and to bring out measles.

During the Middle Ages and later, high doses were used to induce abortions. On the other hand, tansy was also used to help women conceive and to prevent miscarriages. In the 15th century, Christians began serving tansy with Lenten meals to commemorate the Passover bitter herbs eaten by the Israelites. Tansy was thought to have the added Lenten benefits of controlling flatulence brought on by days of eating fish and pulses and of preventing the intestinal worms believed to be caused by eating fish during Lent.

Tansy was used as a face wash and was reported to lighten and purify the skin. In the 19th century, Irish folklore suggested that bathing in a solution of tansy and salts would cure joint pain.

==Insect repellent==
Tansy has also been used as insect repellent and in embalming. It was packed into coffins, wrapped in funeral winding sheets, and tansy wreaths were sometimes placed on the dead. Henry Dunster, the first president of Harvard University, was buried wearing a tansy wreath in a coffin packed with tansy; when the cemetery was moved in 1846 the tansy had maintained its shape and fragrance, helping to identify the president&#x27;s remains. By the 19th century, tansy was used so much at New England funerals that people began to disdain it for its morbid association with death.

During the American colonial period, meat was frequently rubbed with or packed in tansy leaves to repel insects and delay spoilage. Tansy was frequently worn at that time in shoes to prevent malaria and other fevers; it has been shown, however, that some mosquito species, including &quot;Culex pipiens&quot;, take nectar from tansy flowers.

Tansy can be used as in companion planting and for biological pest control. It is planted alongside potatoes to repel the Colorado potato beetle, with one study finding tansy reduced the beetle population by 60 to 100 percent.

In England tansy is placed on window sills to repel flies; sprigs are placed in bed linen to drive away pests, and it has been used as an ant repellent.

In the 1940s, distilled tansy oil mixed with fleabane, pennyroyal and diluted alcohol was a well-known mosquito repellent; collectors were paid five cents a pound for tansy in full bloom. Research has found that tansy extracts do indeed repel mosquitoes, but not as effectively as products containing DEET. In 2008, researchers in Sweden investigated the use of tansy to repel ticks, showing a 64–72 percent repellency for each oil constituent.

==Toxicity==

Many tansy species contain a volatile oil which can cause contact dermatitis in sensitive individuals. If taken internally, toxic metabolites are produced as the oil is broken down in the liver and digestive tract. It is highly toxic to internal parasites, and for centuries tansy tea has been prescribed by herbalists to expel worms. Tansy is an effective insecticide and is highly toxic to arthropods. Because it contains thujone, the U.S. FDA limits the use of tansy to alcoholic beverages, and the final product must be thujone-free. &quot;Tanacetum annuum&quot; is often confused with common tansy (&quot;Tanacetum vulgare&quot;) but the former produces an essential oil that is completely different chemically as it contains no thujone and high amounts of chamazulene making the oil dark blue in color, giving rise to its common name of Blue Tansy Oil. Despite claims by some unethical resellers of essential oils who adulterate the very expensive Blue Tansy (&quot;Tanacetum annuum&quot;) oil with the much cheaper oil from &quot;Tanacetum vulgare&quot;, the oil from &quot;Tanacetum vulgare&quot; is never blue in color as it contains no chamazulene. For this reason a high thujone oil from &quot;Tanacetum vulgare&quot; should never be referred to as &quot;Blue Tansy&quot; oil and any such blue oil containing significant thujone is an adulterated product.

The active components of the volatile oil include 1,8-cineole, &quot;trans&quot;-thujone, camphor and myrtenol, with the quantities and proportions of each varying seasonally and from plant to plant.

1,8-Cineole is a toxin believed to defend the plant leaves against attacks by herbivores.

==Culinary uses==

Tansy was formerly used as a flavouring for puddings and omelettes, but is now almost unknown, except in Cork, where it is used in a sauce to accompany drisheens. The herbalist John Gerard (c. 1545–1612) noted that tansy was well known as “pleasant in taste”, and he recommends tansy sweetmeats as “an especial thing against the gout, if every day for a certain space a reasonable quantitie thereof be eaten fasting.” In Yorkshire, tansy and caraway seeds were traditionally used in biscuits served at funerals.

During the Restoration, a &quot;tansy&quot; was a sweet omelette flavoured with tansy juice. In the BBC documentary &quot;The Supersizers go ... Restoration&quot;, Allegra McEvedy described the flavour as &quot;fruity, sharpness to it and then there&#x27;s a sort of explosion of cool heat a bit like peppermint.&quot; However, the programme&#x27;s presenter Sue Perkins experienced tansy toxicity.

According to liquor historian A. J. Baime, in the 19th century Tennessee whiskey magnate Jack Daniel enjoyed drinking his own whiskey with sugar and crushed tansy leaf.

In the Belgian coastal province of West-Flanders small quantities of crushed dried tansy leaf were traditionally used as culinary herb to spice up pancakes and omelettes. Their tansy is colloquially known as &quot;pancake herb&quot;.

It can also be used as a substitute for sage.

==Ethnomedical use==
For many years, tansy has been used as a medicinal herb despite its toxicity. 19th-century Irish folklore suggests bathing in a solution of tansy and salt as a cure for joint pain. A bitter tea made with tansy flowers has been used for centuries as an anthelmintic to treat parasitic worm infestations, and tansy cakes were traditionally eaten during Lent because it was believed that eating fish during Lent caused intestinal worms. Various &quot;Tanacetum&quot; species are used ethnomedically to treat migraine, neuralgia and rheumatism and as anthelmintics. Traditionally, tansy was often used for its emmenagogue effects to bring on menstruation or end an unwanted pregnancy, and pregnant women are advised to not use this herb.
Research published in 2011 identified 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (3,5-DCQA) and axillarin in tansy as antiviral compounds that are active against herpes simplex virus.

===Among Native Americans===
The Cherokee use an infusion of the plant for backache, use the plant as a tonic, and wear it around the waist and in shoes to prevent miscarriages. The Cheyenne use an infusion of the pulverized leaves and blossoms for dizziness and weakness.

==Other uses==

Some traditional dyers use tansy to produce a golden-yellow color. The yellow flowers are dried for use in floral arrangements.

Tansy is also used as a companion plant, especially with cucurbits like cucumbers and squash, or with roses or various berries. It is thought to repel ants, cucumber beetles, Japanese beetles, squash bugs, and some kinds of flying insects, among others.

Dried tansy is used by some beekeepers as fuel in a bee smoker.

<text>The Quittapahilla Creek (nicknamed the &quot;Quittie&quot;) is a tributary of Swatara Creek in south-central Pennsylvania in the United States.

==History==
The original Lenape name for this waterway is &quot;Kuwektəpehəle&quot;, which means &#x27;it flows out (&quot;ktəpehəle&quot;) from the pines (&quot;kuwe&quot;)&#x27;.

By the late twentieth century, the creek had become polluted from steel mill waste. The decline of industry in the region, as well as federal, state, and local efforts, have led to an improvement in water quality. The stream is stocked annually with trout and it has become a popular destination for recreational fly fishing.

==Geography==
Quittapahilla Creek rises in eastern Lebanon County, flows west-southwest through Lebanon and Annville, and joins Swatara Creek northeast of Palmyra.

<text>Azalia is an unincorporated community in Monroe County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The community is located within Milan Township. As an unincorporated community, Azalia has no legally defined boundaries or population statistics of its own but does have its own post office with the 48110 ZIP Code.

==History==
The community was first known as East Milan, or Reeves Station where a family named Reeves established the Star Bending Company. A post office opened on August 4, 1869 (or in 1866 by some accounts), largely through the efforts of Daniel T. Hazen, to avoid having to travel to West Milan (now Cone) to pick up mail. Steven Frink was the first postmaster, followed by Hazen in 1867, Joseph Meadows in 1872, John M. Lewis in 1877, and A.C. Reynolds in 1884. On September 1, 1887, the postmaster-general issued orders changing the name of the post office from &quot;East Milan&quot; to &quot;Azalia&quot;, which was the name of the railroad station and also named Meadows as postmaster again.

The Toledo, Ann Arbor and Grand Trunk Railway (later the Toledo, Ann Arbor and North Michigan Railway and then the Ann Arbor Railroad), opened on June 8, 1878, with a station named &quot;Azalia&quot;, named after one of the daughters of the president of the railroad, Azalia Ashley.

A Methodist Episcopal Church began holding classes in the early 1850s, building a church in 1870, which continues to the present as the Azalia United Methodist Church.

<doc id="655299" wikidata="Q2920201" url="?curid=655299" title="Eureka Flag">
<text>The Eureka Flag was flown at the Battle of the Eureka Stockade, which took place on 3 December 1854 at Ballarat in Victoria, Australia. It was the culmination of the 1851 to 1854 Eureka Rebellion on the Victorian goldfields. Gold miners protested the cost of mining permits, the officious way the colonial authorities enforced the system, and other grievances. An estimated crowd of over 10,000 demonstrators swore allegiance to the flag as a symbol of defiance at Bakery Hill on 29 November 1854. It was then flown over the Eureka Stockade during the battle that resulted in at least 27 deaths. Around 120 miners were arrested, and many others were badly wounded, including five soldiers.

The field is Prussian blue, measuring (2:3.08 ratio) and made from a fine woollen fabric. The horizontal arm of the cross is wide, and the vertical arm is tall. The central star is slightly larger (8.5%) than the others, being about , all from point to point and the other stars . The white stars are made from a fine cotton lawn, and the off-white cross is cotton twill. In addition to a modern, standardised version, there are also other Eureka Flag variants.

Since the 19th century, the Eureka Flag has achieved customary use as a general-purpose symbol of protest and has been adopted by supporters of the Australian republic and trade union movements. It has also been incorporated into the official logo of the far-right Australia First Party and is often seen on bumper stickers accompanied by white nationalist political slogans. There have been efforts, such as around the time of the 150th anniversary in 2004 by Ballarat MP Catherine King, to give legal standing to the Eureka Flag under the Flags Act and to reserve it for more progressive causes.

The Eureka Flag is listed as an object of significance on the Victorian Heritage Register and was designated as a Victorian icon by the National Trust of Australia in 2006. The &quot;King&quot; fragments are part of the collection of the Art Gallery of Ballarat, which is responsible for their conservation. Since 2013, they have been on a long-term loan to the interpretative centre located at the Eureka Stockade Memorial Park, where they remain on public display. There are also other notable authenticated Eureka Flag fragments to have been exhibited and sold at auction.

The disputed first report of the attack on the Eureka Stockade also refers to a Union Jack being flown during the battle that was captured, along with the Eureka Flag, by the foot police.

==History==
The Port Phillip District was partitioned on 1 July 1851 by the &quot;Australian Constitutions Act 1850&quot;, as Victoria gained autonomy within the British Empire after a decade of de facto independence from New South Wales. Approval of the Victorian constitution by the Imperial parliament was pending, with an election held for a provisional legislative council consisting of 20 elected and ten appointed members subject to property-based franchise and membership requirements.

Gold prospectors were offered 200 guineas for making discoveries within of Melbourne. In August 1851, the news was received worldwide that, on top of several earlier finds, Thomas Hiscock, outside of Buninyong in central Victoria, had found still more deposits. As gold fever took hold, the colony&#x27;s population increased from 77,000 in 1851 to 198,496 in 1853. Among this number was &quot;a heavy sprinkling of ex-convicts, gamblers, thieves, rogues and vagabonds of all kinds&quot;. 

The local authorities soon found themselves with fewer police officers and lacked the infrastructure needed to support the expansion of the mining industry. The number of public servants and factory and farm workers leaving for the goldfields to seek their fortune led to a chronic labour shortage that needed to be resolved. The response was a universal mining tax based on time stayed, rather than what was seen as the more equitable option, being an export duty levied only on gold found, meaning it was always designed to make life unprofitable for most prospectors. 

Licence inspections, known as &quot;digger hunts&quot;, were treated as a great sport and &quot;carried out in the style of an English fox-hunt&quot; by mounted officials who received a fifty per cent commission from any fines imposed. Many recruits were former prisoners from Tasmania and prone to brutal means, having been sentenced to serve in the military. Miners were often arrested for not carrying licences on their person because of the typically wet and dirty conditions in the mines, then subjected to such indignities as being chained to trees and logs overnight.

In the years leading up to the Eureka Stockade, several mass public meetings were held to address the miner&#x27;s grievances. The Bendigo Petition received over 5,000 signatures and was presented to Lieutenant-Governor Charles La Trobe by a miner&#x27;s delegation in August 1853. There were also delegations received by the Ballarat gold commissioner Robert William Rede and La Trobe&#x27;s successor Charles Hotham in October and November 1854. The ever-present &quot;physical force&quot; faction of the mining tax protest movement gained the ascendancy over those who advocated &quot;moral force&quot;, including John Basson Humffray, after a judicial enquiry into the murder of miner James Scobie outside the Eureka Hotel. There was no finding of guilt regarding the owner, James Bently, who was deeply suspected of involvement, with the case being presided over by a police magistrate accused of having a conflict of interest. 

Then, there was an uproar over the arrest of Catholic Father Smyth&#x27;s disabled Armenian servant, Johannes Gregorius. He was subjected to police brutality and false arrest for licence evasion even though it was revealed he was exempt from the requirement. Gregorius was instead convicted of assaulting a constable and fined 5 pounds despite the court hearing testimony to the contrary. 

Eventually, the discontent began to spiral out of control. A mob of many thousands of aggrieved miners burned the Eureka Hotel on 17 October 1854. On 28 November, there was a skirmish as the approaching 12th Regiment (East Suffolk) had their wagon train looted in the vicinity of the Eureka lead, where the rebels ultimately made their last stand. The next day, the Eureka Flag appeared on the platform for the first time, and mining licences were burnt at the final fiery mass meeting of the Ballarat Reform League – the miner&#x27;s lobby. The league&#x27;s founding charter proclaims that &quot;it is the inalienable right of every citizen to have a voice in making the laws he is called upon to obey&quot; and &quot;taxation without representation is tyranny&quot;, in the language of the United States Declaration of Independence. 

On 30 November, there was further rioting where missiles were once again directed at military and law enforcement by the protesting miners, who had henceforth refused to cooperate with licence inspections &quot;en masse&quot;. That afternoon there was a paramilitary display on Bakery Hill. The oath-swearing ceremony took place as the military companies formed were gathered around the Eureka Flag. In the preceding weeks, the men of violence had already been aiming musket balls at the barely fortified government camp during the night.

The rebels, under their commander-in-chief Peter Lalor, who had left Ireland for the gold fields of Australia, were led down the road from Bakery Hill to the ill-fated Eureka Stockade. It was a crude &quot;higgledy piggledy&quot; battlement erected between 30 November and 2 December that consisted of diagonal spikes and overturned horse carts. In the ensuing battle that left at least 22 rebels and seven soldiers dead, the stockade was besieged and captured by the advancing government forces. They briefly wavered, with the 40th Regiment (2nd Somersetshire) having to be rallied amid a short, sharp exchange of ranged fire lasting around 15 minutes at dawn on Sunday, 3 December. The Victorian police contingent led the way over the top as the forlorn hope in a bayonet charge.

===Origin and symbolism===


The earliest mention of a flag was the report of a meeting held on 23 October 1854 to discuss indemnifying Andrew McIntyre and Thomas Fletcher, who had both been arrested and committed for trial over the burning of the Eureka Hotel. The correspondent for the Melbourne &quot;Herald&quot; stated: &quot;Mr. Kennedy suggested that a tall flag pole should be erected on some conspicuous site, the hoisting of the diggers&#x27; flag on which should be the signal for calling together a meeting on any subject which might require immediate consideration.&quot;

In 1885, John Wilson, whom the Victorian Works Department employed at Ballarat as a foreman, claimed that he had originally conceptualised the Eureka Flag after becoming sympathetic to the rebel cause. He then recalls that it was constructed from bunting by a tarpaulin maker. There is another popular tradition where the flag design is credited to a member of the Ballarat Reform League, &quot;Captain&quot; Henry Ross of Toronto, in Ontario, Canada. A. W. Crowe recounted in 1893 that &quot;it was Ross who gave the order for the insurgents&#x27; flag at Darton and Walker&#x27;s&quot;. Crowe&#x27;s story is confirmed in that there were advertisements in the &quot;Ballarat Times&quot; dating from October–November 1854 for Darton and Walker, manufacturers of tents, tarpaulin and flags, situated at the Gravel Pits.

It has long been said that women were involved in constructing the Eureka Flag. In a letter to the editor published in the Melbourne &quot;Age&quot;, 15 January 1855 edition, Fredrick Vern states that he &quot;fought for freedom&#x27;s cause, under a banner made and wrought by English ladies&quot;. According to some of their descendants, Anastasia Withers, Anne Duke and Anastasia Hayes were all involved in sewing the flag. The stars are made of delicate material, consistent with the story they were made out of their petticoats. The blue woollen fabric &quot;certainly bears a marked resemblance to the standard dressmaker&#x27;s length of material for making up one of the voluminous dresses of the 1850s&quot; and also the blue shirts worn by the miners.

In his seminal &quot;Flag of Stars&quot;, Frank Cayley published two sketches he discovered on a visit to the soon-to-be headquarters of the Ballarat Historical Society in 1963, which may be the original plans for the Eureka Flag. One is a two-dimensional drawing of a flag bearing the words &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;white&quot; to denote the colour scheme. Cayley has concluded: &quot;It looks like a rough design of the so-called King Flag.&quot; The other sketch was &quot;pasted on the same piece of card shows the flag being carried by a bearded man&quot; that Cayley believes may have been intended as a representation of Henry Ross. Federation University history professor Anne Beggs-Sunter refers to an article reportedly published in the &quot;Ballarat Times&quot; &quot;shortly after the Stockade referring to two women making the flag from an original drawing by a digger named Ross. Unfortunately no complete set of the Ballarat Times exists, and it is impossible to locate this intriguing reference.&quot;

The theory that the Eureka Flag is based on the Australian Federation Flag has precedents in that &quot;borrowing the general flag design of the country one is revolting against can be found in many instances of colonial liberation, including Haiti, Venezuela, Iceland, and Guinea&quot;. Some resemblance to the modern Flag of Quebec has been noted, that was based on a design used by the French-speaking majority of the colony of the Province of Canada at the time Ross emigrated. Ballarat local historian Father Tom Linane thought women from the St Aliphius chapel on the goldfields might have made the flag. This theory is supported by St Aliphius raising a blue and white ecclesiastical flag featuring a couped cross to signal that mass was about to commence. Professor Geoffrey Blainey believed that the white cross on which the stars are arrayed is &quot;really an Irish cross rather than being [a] configuration of the Southern Cross&quot;.

Cayley has stated that the field &quot;may have been inspired by the sky, but was more probably intended to match the blue shirts worn by the diggers&quot;. Norm D&#x27;Angri theorises that the Eureka Flag was hastily manufactured, and the number of points on the stars is a mere convenience as eight was &quot;the easiest to construct without using normal drawing instruments&quot;.

===Oath swearing at Bakery Hill===

Before the oath-swearing ceremony at Bakery Hill on 30 November 1854, another recorded hoisting of the Eureka Flag occurred that day. In his open letter to the colonists of Victoria, dated 7 April 1855, Peter Lalor said that he heard the news that shots were fired on miners at the Gravel Pits. Along with an armed mob, he then headed towards Barker and Hunt&#x27;s store on Specimen Hill. It was here the Eureka Flag &quot;was procured and hoisted on the flagstaff belonging to Barker and Hunt; but it was almost immediately hauled down, and we moved down to the holes on the Gravel Pits Flat.&quot;

John Wilson claimed to have enlisted the help of prisoners to procure the flag pole on Bakery Hill. He said that it was long and felled from an area known as Byle&#x27;s Swamp in Bullarook Forest. Then it was set into an abandoned mineshaft, and his design of &quot;five white stars on a blue ground, floated gaily in the breeze&quot;.

The &quot;Ballarat Times&quot; first mentioned the Eureka Flag on 24 November 1854 in an article about a meeting of the Ballarat Reform League to be held the following Wednesday where, &quot;The Australian flag shall triumphantly wave in the sunshine of its own blue and peerless sky, over thousands of Australia&#x27;s adopted sons.&quot; There are also other examples of it being referred to at the time as the Australian flag. The day after the battle, the &quot;Age&quot; reported that: &quot;They assembled round the Australian flag, which has now a permanent flag-staff.&quot; 

The &quot;Geelong Advertiser&quot; stated, &quot;The following remarkable scene at the inauguration of the &#x27;Australian flag&#x27;, and the organisation of the first &#x27;rebel army&#x27; in these colonies&quot; and that &quot;The &#x27;Australian Flag&#x27;, it appears, has been captured from the volunteers.&quot; In a despatch dated 20 December 1854, Lieutenant-Governor Charles Hotham said: &quot;The disaffected miners ... held a meeting whereat the Australian flag of independence was solemnly consecrated and vows offered for its defence.&quot;

In the subsequent &quot;Ballarat Times&quot; report of the oath-swearing ceremony, it was stated that:

Lalor, armed with a rifle, took the initiative by mounting a stump and proclaiming &quot;liberty&quot;, then called for rebel volunteers to form themselves into companies. Near the base of the flagpole, Lalor knelt with his head uncovered, pointed his right hand to the Eureka Flag, and swore to the affirmation of over 10,000 demonstrators: &quot;We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties.&quot; Raffaello Carboni recalls that Henry Ross was the &quot;bridegroom&quot; of the flag and &quot;sword in hand, he had posted himself at the foot of the flag-staff, surrounded by his rifle division&quot;.

In 1931, R. S. Reed claimed that &quot;an old tree stump on the south side of Victoria Street, near Humffray Street, is the historic tree at which the pioneer diggers gathered in the days before the Eureka Stockade to discuss their grievances against the officialdom of the time.&quot; Reed called for the formation of a committee of citizens to &quot;beautify the spot, and to preserve the tree stump&quot; upon which Lalor addressed the assembled rebels during the oath swearing ceremony. It was reported that the stump had &quot;been securely fenced in, and the enclosed area is to be planted with floriferous trees. The spot is adjacent to Eureka, which is famed alike for the stockade fight and for the fact that the Welcome Nugget (sold for £10,500) was discovered in 1858 within a stone&#x27;s throw of it.&quot;

The modern-day address of the oath-swearing ceremony is likely 29 St Paul&#x27;s Way, Bakery Hill. As of 2016, the site is a car park and was for a hundred years a school, with plans to develop it into an apartment block.

===Seized by police at Eureka Stockade===

After the oath-swearing ceremony, the rebels marched in double file behind the Eureka Flag from Bakery Hill to the Eureka lead, where construction of the stockade began. In his 1855 memoirs, Raffaello Carboni again mentions the role of Henry Ross, who &quot;was our standard-bearer. He hoisted down the Southern Cross from the flag-staff, and headed the march.&quot;

In his report dated 14 December 1854, Captain John Thomas mentioned &quot;the fact of the Flag belonging to the Insurgents (which had been nailed to the flagstaff) being captured by Constable King of the Force&quot;. King had volunteered for the honour while the battle was still raging. W. Bourke, a miner residing about 250 yards from the stockade, recalled that: &quot;The police negotiated the wall of the Stockade on the south-west, and I then saw a policeman climb the flag pole. When up about 12 or 14 feet the pole broke, and he came down with a run.&quot; 

John Lynch, who fought at the Eureka Stockade, said: &quot;I have a vague recollection of its being pulled down by the soldiers amidst a chorus of jeers and ribald shoutings. A private of the 40th Regiment told myself and other prisoners that he was one of those who rough handled it.&quot; Theophilus Williams, a Justice of the Peace and later Mayor of Ballarat East, had a tent situated 300 yards away from the Eureka Stockade. He said that he was prepared to &quot;affirm on affidavit that he saw two red uniformed soldiers haul down the flag&quot;. 

Carboni, an eyewitness to the battle, recalls that: &quot;A wild &#x27;hurrah!&#x27; burst out and &#x27;the Southern Cross&#x27; was torn down, I should say, among their laughter, such as if it had been a prize from a May-pole ... The red-coats were now ordered to &#x27;fall in&#x27;; their bloody work was over, and were marched off, dragging with them the &#x27;Southern Cross&#x27;.&quot; 

The &quot;Geelong Advertiser&quot; reported that the flag &quot;was carried by in triumph to the Camp, waved about in the air, then pitched from one to another, thrown down and trampled on&quot;. The soldiers also danced around the flag on a pole that was &quot;now a sadly tattered flag from which souvenir hunters had cut and torn pieces&quot;. The morning after the battle, &quot;the policeman who captured the flag exhibited it to the curious and allowed such as so desired to tear off small portions of its ragged end to preserve as souvenirs.&quot;

===Exhibit in high treason trials===

At the Eureka state treason trials that began on 22 February 1855, the 13 defendants had it put to them that they did &quot;traitorously assemble together against our Lady the Queen&quot; and attempt &quot;by the force of arms to destroy the Government constituted there and by law established, and to depose our Lady the Queen from the kingly name and her Imperial Crown&quot;. Furthermore, concerning the &quot;overt acts&quot; that constituted the actus reus of the offence, the indictment read: &quot;That you raised upon a pole, and collected round a certain standard, and did solemnly swear to defend each other, with the intention of levying war against our said Lady the Queen&quot;.

Called as a witness, George Webster, the chief assistant civil commissary and magistrate, testified that upon entering the stockade the besieging forces &quot;immediately made towards the flag, and the police pulled down the flag&quot;. John King testified, &quot;I took their flag, the southern cross, down – the same flag as now produced.&quot;

In his closing submission, the defence counsel Henry Chapman argued there were no inferences to be drawn from the hoisting of the Eureka Flag, saying:

===Post-battle preservation===

The Eureka Flag was retained by John King, who quit the police force two days after the state treason trials ended to become a farmer. In the late 1870s, he eventually settled near Minyip in the Victorian Wimmera district. It was here that the flag &quot;made occasional appearances at country bazaars&quot;. In his 1870 history of Ballarat, William Withers said he had not been able to find out what had happened to the flag. Professor Anne Beggs-Sunter thinks it is &quot;likely that King read Withers&#x27;s book, because he wrote to the Melbourne Public Library offering to sell the flag to that institution.&quot; 

The head librarian, Marcus Clarke, approached Peter Lalor to authenticate the flag. He was unable, replying, &quot;Can you find someone whose memory is more accurate than mine?&quot; The library eventually decided not to acquire the flag due to the uncertainty over its origins. It would remain in the custody of the King family for forty years until 1895 when it was lent to the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery (now the Art Gallery of Ballarat). John King&#x27;s widow Isabella would post the flag after being approached by art gallery president James Oddie, along with a letter to the secretary which reads:

In a letter to his father, Fred Riley recalled visiting Ballarat in 1912 and acquiring a fragment of the Eureka Flag that now resides at the National Library of Australia. He said:

As a result of this practice, the pieces of the flag in the art gallery collection represent only 69.01% of the original specimen. In &quot;Labour History&quot;, Professor Beggs-Sunter states that the art gallery displayed the flag &quot;in various unsuitable ways&quot; until it was put in a glass case alongside the sword of Captain Wise in October 1934, which she described as an &quot;unlikely juxtaposition&quot;. When peace activist Egon Kisch visited the gallery the following year, he wrote that the Eureka monument &quot;heroes and minions of the law, fighters and executioners ... on the same level&quot;.

The Eureka Flag remained unauthenticated at the art gallery. After being told about it by his friend Rem McClintock in December 1944, Sydney journalist Len Fox, who worked with the Communist Party media, published an article about the flag during his investigation that followed on from Withers&#x27;. He entered into correspondence with the King family, the art gallery, and Ballarat local historian Nathan Spielvogel. Fox was sent a piece of the flag by the art gallery in March 1945, along with a drawing.

Spielvogel offered to assist, although he had reasons to doubt the authenticity of the flag held by the art gallery. Later that year, Fox visited Ballarat to inspect the flag, and the custodians gave him two more pieces. Fox self-published a booklet in 1963 that advanced his argument as to why the flag at the art gallery was authentic. It was probably due to Fox&#x27;s interest that in 1963, the flag was transferred to a safe at the art gallery. 

Eventually, the librarian discovered that the safe had been broken into. The robber left the flag that was still there wrapped in brown paper. At this point, it was stored in a vault at the National Bank. The final irrefutable validation of its authentication occurred when sketchbooks of Canadian Charles Doudiet were put up for sale at a Christie&#x27;s auction in 1996. Two sketches, in particular, show the design is the same as the tattered remains of the original flag that were first put on public display at the art gallery in 1973, being unveiled during a ceremony attended by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.

The art gallery had received a $1,000 grant from the state government to cover half the estimated cost of repairing and mounting the flag. Ballarat seamstress Val D&#x27;Angri did the conservation work in May 1973. Along with a pin, there was a &quot;W&quot; mark discovered at the fly end of the cross that D&#x27;Angri believes may be the signature of her great-great-grandmother Anastasia Withers. Later additions to the gallery placed the flag in a dedicated shrine in the building&#x27;s centre, surrounded by Eureka-related works.

In 2001, legal ownership of the Eureka Flag was transferred to the art gallery. There was a second extensive restoration of the specimen undertaken in 2011 by leading textile conservation specialists Artlab Australia. The City of Ballarat had received a permit from Heritage Victoria to proceed with the conservation work. A full assessment of the state of the flag was commissioned. The report compiled by Artlab described the flag as &quot;arguably the most important historical textile in Australia&quot;. The old backing cloth was replaced with state-of-the-art materials that are less prone to deterioration, along with the timber backing board. A new, purpose-built, low-light, temperature-controlled display case was also constructed. The art gallery then loaned the flag to the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka (MADE) in 2013. When MADE closed in 2018, the interpretive centre came under the management of the City of Ballarat. The flag was retained as the centrepiece of a visitor experience now branded as the Eureka Centre Ballarat while remaining part of the art gallery collection.

====Other notable fragments====

Over the years, a number of additional pieces of the Eureka Flag have been entrusted to the Art Gallery of Ballarat and other organisations or sold at auction. Martha Clendinning claimed to have a piece of the Eureka Flag that was given to her by doctor Alfred Carr. Clendinning&#x27;s daughter married Robert Rede, who was the Ballarat gold commissioner at the time of the battle. In his 1896 article, Withers states that Robert Rede sent these fragments to him. They were compared to the pieces loaned to the art gallery in 1895. After a minute comparison by Mr Grainger of Sunnyside Woollen Mills, they were adjudged to be the same. A small piece of blue material was later donated to the Melbourne Public Library by Mr A. S. Kenyon, who died in 1943. Along with the fragment was a written statement signed by Mrs Clendinning that reads, &quot;Piece of the flag set up in the Stockade. Given to me by Dr Alfred Carr immediately after it was taken.&quot;

Before it was given to the Ballarat Historical Society, the Bradford fragment was stored for many years in a leather pouch containing a note written by J. Bradford. It reads: &quot;This piece of cloth is part of the original Eureka Stockade Flag. It was given to me by my father Wm. Bradford who had it given to him by his father Wm. Bradford Snr, who fought for freedom at Ballarat, Victoria, in 1854.&quot; 

On his 1963 visit to Ballarat, Frank Cayley compared the Bradford fragment to the pieces held by the art gallery. He found they matched in both texture and colour. Acquiring a small sample of the Bradford fragment, Cayley then compared this to the piece held by the Melbourne Public Library. Apart from some variations in colour due to fading, he could detect no difference. Cayley shared his findings with fellow Eureka investigator Len Fox. They organised for experts from the School of Textile Technology at the University of New South Wales to test a piece of the Bradford fragment and a piece from the art gallery in Fox&#x27;s possession. In November 1963, the report was released, concluding that the two fragments &quot;are most probably from the same source&quot;.

The Billings fragment was discovered in Kybram, Victoria, inside a compartment of a sea chest that had once belonged to J. D. Williams, the camp surgeon at Ballarat, in December 1854. Williams obtained a piece of the Eureka Flag as a souvenir while taking care of the wounded after the battle. His descendants donated it to the art gallery in 1993.

A piece of the Eureka Flag was placed in a safe at St Patrick&#x27;s Christian Brothers College in Ballarat in the early 20th century. In June 1996, it was donated to the art gallery. It was then loaned to the Royal Australian Navy when was commissioned and went on the warship&#x27;s maiden voyage.

The five tiny pieces that were given to Len Fox during his investigation were returned to the gallery by Professor Beggs-Sunter in January 1997.

Evelyn Healy was sent a fragment of the Eureka Flag by her mother, Myrtle Shaw. Healy was active with the Communist Party, and the party wanted a replica of the flag for a May Day parade in 1938. Healy believed the pieces of the Eureka Flag at the art gallery were genuine, and Shaw spoke to the gallery&#x27;s custodian, William Keith. He gave Shaw a snippet along with some rough sketches and a written description. Healy then forwarded these materials to party leader Rem McClintock. When Healy asked for it back, she was told it was still needed and then that it was lost.

In July 1997, McClintock&#x27;s son Alex tried to sell a piece of the Eureka Flag through Christie&#x27;s auction house in Melbourne with a reserve price of $10,000. It was the same piece Len Fox mentioned in his 1986 &quot;Overland&quot; article. Healy obtained an injunction blocking the sale on the grounds that she was the lawful owner. A lengthy court case ensued, and her claim was eventually upheld. After the fragment was returned, she gave it to the art gallery in March 1998.

In 2017, the Victorian Trades Hall Council purchased a fragment of the Eureka Flag through the Melbourne auction house Mossgreen for $32,000. The seller was Adrian Millane, who inherited a piece of the flag that was reportedly handed to his great-grandfather Francis Hanlon by Peter Lalor. The auction house subsequently went bankrupt with $12 million in debt. Millane claimed he was still owed $20,000 and that he intended to use the funds to support an orphanage in Bengal, India. In 2013, Millane loaned his fragment to the former Museum of Australian Democracy, where it was displayed for the 159th anniversary of the battle.

==Customary use==

Since the 1854 miner&#x27;s revolt, the Eureka Flag, born out of adversity, has gained wider notability in Australian culture as a symbol of democracy, egalitarianism, trade unionism, white nationalism, and a general-purpose symbol of protest. Whilst some Australians view it as a symbol of nationality, it has more often been employed by historical societies, re-enactors and trade unions such as the former Builders Labourers Federation. More recently, far-right organisations and political parties have adopted it, including the Australia First Party, National Action, and some neo-Nazi groups, much to the frustration of more established socialist and progressive claimants. Depending on their political persuasion, these groups either see it as representative of the miner&#x27;s efforts to free themselves from political or economic oppression or their sentiments favouring restricting non-white immigration and the eventual 1855 Chinese poll tax.

Construction union boss Kevin Reynolds and the Northern Territory&#x27;s nomination for Australian of the Year, Warwick Thornton, both raised fears in 2010 that the Eureka Flag could &quot;become a swastika-like symbol of racism.&quot; Professor Greg Craven said that 20 years prior, the Eureka Flag rivalled the official Australian flag. However, it had become so tainted through appearing on bumper stickers with racist slogans that &quot;The Southern Cross is becoming a symbol not of unity but of exclusion.&quot; According to Craven, the union movement has also politicised the Eureka Flag, given that &quot;The Eureka Stockade was not exclusively about the working class but also the middle class.&quot;

In a 2013 survey about national symbols, McCrindle Research found the Eureka Flag eliciting a &quot;mixed response with 1 in 10 (10%) being extremely proud while 1 in 3 (35%) are uncomfortable with its use.&quot;

The City of Unley refused a request to fly the Eureka Flag at the local civic centre to commemorate the 166th anniversary of the Eureka Stockade in 2020. Councillor Jennifer Bonham noted the flag&#x27;s place in the &quot;struggle for democracy.&quot; However, she said it must be acknowledged that &quot;the Chinese were persecuted on the goldfields&quot; and &quot;The Eureka flag can also be a symbol of that persecution.&quot; Councillor Jane Russo said that it had become symbolic of &quot;white supremacy.&quot;

In response to the use of the Eureka Flag at violent protests in recent times, efforts have been made by some, including federal Labor MP Catherine King, to reclaim it for more progressive causes.

===Late 19th century – present===

There is an oral tradition that Eureka Flags were on display at a seaman&#x27;s union protest against the use of cheap Asian labour on ships at Circular Quay in 1878. In August 1890, a crowd of 30,000 protesters gathered at the Yarra Bank in Melbourne under a platform draped with the flag in a show of solidarity with maritime workers. A similar flag was flown prominently above the camp at Barcaldine during the 1891 Australian shearers&#x27; strike.

After the First World War and the Great Depression, the Eureka Flag once again returned to the public domain, being adopted by the New Guard and &quot;the radical left wing of the Australian Labor Party and the Communist Party&quot; in the 1930s.

In 1948, a procession of 3,000 members of the Communist-affiliated Eureka Youth League and allied unionists led by a Eureka Flag bearer marched through the streets of Melbourne on the occasion of the 94th anniversary of the Eureka Stockade. The same year, headlines in the Melbourne &quot;Argus&quot; stated, &quot;Police in serious clash with strikers&quot; and &quot;Battle over Eureka flag&quot; following a violent clash between about 500 strikers and police during a procession on St Patrick&#x27;s Day in Brisbane. The marchers were singing &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Day for the Irish&quot; and &quot;Advance, Australia Fair&quot; whilst carrying shamrock-shaped anti-government placards and a coffin with the label &quot;Trade Unionism.&quot;

Readers were also told, &quot;Conspicuous in the procession was a Eureka flag, a replica of the flag Peter Lalor&#x27;s followers carried at the Eureka Stockade in 1854.&quot; It was reported that two protesters were injured and five arrested &quot;In a fight for the Eureka flag&quot; where the &quot;strikers resisted, and blows were struck. Police, caught up in the melee, drew batons and used them.&quot;

The Eureka Flag was used by supporters of Gough Whitlam after he was dismissed as prime minister. In 1979, the Northcote City Council began flying the Eureka Flag from its Town Hall to mark the 125th anniversary of the uprising and continued until at least 1983.

During a 1983 royal tour, a republican supporter informally presented a small Eureka Flag to Diana, Princess of Wales, who did not recognise it. The event prompted a cartoon of the royal couple with Charles, Prince of Wales, observing, &quot;Mummy will not be pleased.&quot;

To commemorate the 2004 Eureka sesquicentenary, the Eureka Flag flew at every state and territory parliament; the federal senate; City Hill, Canberra; and from the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson made the flag a federal election issue that year. He was opposed to flying it at Parliament House, Canberra to mark the occasion, stating: &quot;I think people have tried to make too much of the Eureka Stockade ... trying to give it a credibility and standing that it probably doesn&#x27;t enjoy.&quot;

The Eureka Flag has been adopted by a variety of civic and political organisations, including the City of Ballarat and Federation University, which use elements or stylised versions of the flag in their official logo. Several trade unions use it, including the CFMEU and ETU. The Eureka Flag is often informally flown on-site at building and other construction sites by members of the construction, forestry, maritime, mining and energy unions. It is deemed to be a trade union symbol under the Commonwealth building code, which prohibits using any &quot;building association logos, mottos or indicia&quot; on property, clothing or equipment that suggests union membership is required to work on government-funded projects. In 2022, the Federal Court of Australia ruled that companies subject to the legislation must ensure the Eureka Flag is not displayed at affected worksites. The flag flies permanently over the Melbourne Trades Hall and the Ballarat Trades Hall. The Prospectors and Miners Association of Victoria use it as their official flag. In 2016, it was formally incorporated into the official logo of the Australia First Party with the Australian Electoral Commission receiving submissions opposing the inclusion of the Eureka Flag.

Sporting clubs have made use of the Eureka Flag, including the Melbourne Victory and Melbourne Rebels. Melbourne Victory supporters adopted it as a club flag for the foundation year in 2004. It was briefly banned at A-League games by the Football Federation of Australia but rescinded in the face of criticism from the Victorian general public. The Football Federation of Australia claimed that the ban was &quot;unintentional.&quot;

HMAS &quot;Ballarat&quot; occasionally flies the Eureka Flag from its mainstay alongside the Australian White Ensign

===Standardised design===

The standardised Eureka Flag most often seen in circulation today is an enhanced and different version from the original specimen with blue key lines around each of five equal stars. It is frequently made in the proportions of 20:13. The Eureka Flag features the stars of the Southern Cross, a constellation more visible to viewers in the Southern Hemisphere. The stars are arranged differently from the astronomical alignment of the Southern Cross. The &quot;middle&quot; star (Epsilon Crucis) in the constellation is off-centre and near the edge of the &quot;diamond.&quot; In contrast, the Eureka Flag features a star in the centre of the white cross.

====Eureka Flag bills====
A bill was tabled in federal parliament on 23 March 2004 by Victorian Senator Gavin Marshall to &quot;amend the &quot;Flags Act 1953&quot; to recognise the Eureka Flag as an official flag of Australia, and for related purposes&quot;. A mirror bill had previously been introduced into the House of Representatives by the member for Ballarat Catherine King in 2003.

First floated by the Eureka Stockade Memorial Trust in 1997, the proposed amendment was moved ahead of the impending sesquicentenary of the Eureka Stockade in 2004. It sought to officially recognise the standardised design and put the legality of flying the Eureka Flag from public buildings beyond all doubt, with petitions presented to both houses of parliament calling for such recognition under the Flags Act. King stated in parliament that former immigration minister Al Grassby had attested to a precedent where the Eureka Flag was flown from the old parliament house in 1972.

The Australian Labor Party indicated support for the move, with opposition leader Mark Latham saying he was: &quot;pledged to fly it [the Eureka Flag] above [Parliament House] Canberra if he became Prime Minister.&quot;

===Derivatives and variants===

The Lambing Flat riots were a series of violent anti-Chinese demonstrations in the Burrangong region in New South Wales, Australia. The miner&#x27;s local vigilante committee was known as the Miner&#x27;s Protection League. On 30 June 1861, seven hundred miners led by a brass band went about sacking the grog shops, which were havens for thieves, before turning their attention to the Chinese section. Most fled, but two Chinese who stayed to fight were killed, and ten others were badly injured. There were further incidents throughout 1861, with the Chinese who returned targeted. Another large gathering was held on Bastille Day, 14 July. The demonstrators were eventually read the riot act and had shots fired over their heads before being dispersed by mounted troopers. The trouble gradually subsided as more soldiers and marines were sent from Sydney. In 1870, the town was renamed in honour of former New South Wales governor, Sir John Young.

The Lambing Flat banner was painted on a tent flap and is now on display at the Lambing Flat Museum. It bears a Southern Cross superimposed over a St Andrew&#x27;s cross with the inscription &quot;ROLL UP. ROLL UP. NO CHINESE.&quot; It has been claimed that the banner, which served as an advertisement for a public meeting that presaged the Lambing Flat riots, was inspired by the Eureka Flag.

According to Whitney Smith, writing in 1975, the Eureka Flag:

Before the Eureka Flag went on permanent display to the public, it was often featured with no cross and free-floating stars as per the Australian national flag, such as in the 1949 motion picture &quot;Eureka Stockade&quot; starring Chips Rafferty.

There is also a variant based on the red flag that is occasionally seen.

==Other Eureka flags==
During his investigation in the late nineteenth century, William Withers found two women, Mrs Morgan and Mrs Oliver, who claimed to have sewn a starry flag at the time, but &quot;they could not positively identify it as the one flown at Eureka.&quot; John Wilson recalls that the Eureka Flag was taken down by Thomas Kennedy at sundown on 2 December 1854 and stored in his tent &quot;for safe keeping.&quot; 

When the government forces arrived in the early hours of the following day, it was already flying above the stockade. Frank Cayley has concluded that: &quot;Wilson&#x27;s flag was undoubtedly one of several flags, in various designs, that were made at Eureka.&quot; His colleague and fellow Eureka investigator, Melbourne journalist Len Fox, has also stated: &quot;Flags were popular on the goldfields, and it may well be that among the diggers at Ballarat were smaller (and different) versions of the Eureka flag.&quot;

Concerning the provenance of the star-spangled Eureka Flag, Withers also interviewed police officer John McNeil, who recalled a meeting at Bakery Hill where Robert McCandlish &quot;unbuttoned his coat and took out and unfurled a light blue flag with some stars on it, but there was no cross on it.&quot;

===Eureka Jack Mystery===

Since 2009, various theories have emerged, based on the &quot;Argus&quot; account of the battle dated 4 December 1854 and an affidavit sworn by Private Hugh King three days later as to a flag being seized from a prisoner detained at the stockade, concerning whether a Union Jack, known as the Eureka Jack was also flown by the rebel garrison. Readers of the &quot;Argus&quot; were told that:

In his &quot;Eureka: The Unfinished Revolution&quot;, Peter FitzSimons has stated:

However, Hugh King, who was a private in the 40th (the 2nd Somersetshire) Regiment of Foot, swore in a signed contemporaneous affidavit that he recalled:

During the committal hearings for the Eureka rebels, there would be another &quot;Argus&quot; report dated 9 December 1854 concerning the seizure of a second flag at the stockade in the following terms:

Hugh King was called upon to give further testimony live under oath in the matter of Timothy Hayes. In doing so, he went into more detail than in his written affidavit, as the report states that the Union Jack-like flag was found:


Military historian and author of &quot;Eureka Stockade: A Ferocious and Bloody Battle&quot; Gregory Blake, concedes that the rebels may have flown two battle flags as they claimed to be defending their British rights. Blake leaves open the possibility that the flag being carried by the prisoner had been souvenired from the flag pole as the routed garrison was fleeing the stockade. Once taken by Constable John King, the Eureka Flag was placed beneath his tunic in the same fashion as the suspected Union Jack was found on the prisoner. 

In 1896, Sergeant John McNeil, who was at the battle, recalled shredding a flag at the Spencer Street Barracks in Melbourne at the time. He claimed it was the Eureka Flag that he had torn down. However, Blake believes it may have been the mystery Eureka Jack.

Another theory is that the Eureka Jack was an 11th-hour response to divided loyalties in the rebel camp. 

The oath swearing ceremony in &quot;Eureka Stockade&quot; (1949) features the star-spangled Eureka Flag with the Union Jack beneath. In &quot;The Revolt at Eureka&quot;, part of a 1958 illustrated history series for students, the artist Ray Wenban remained faithful to the first reports of the battle with his rendition featuring two flags flying above the Eureka Stockade.

In 2013, the Australian Flag Society announced a worldwide quest and a $10,000 reward for more information and materials relating to the Eureka Jack mystery. The AFS also released a commemorative artwork, &quot;Fall Back with the Eureka Jack&quot; illustrating Gregory Blake&#x27;s theory for the 160th anniversary of the battle in 2014.

<doc id="655302" wikidata="Q3500650" url="?curid=655302" title="Structure of the rail industry in the United Kingdom">
<text>There are effectively two separate mainline railway systems in the United Kingdom – the Great Britain system and the Northern Ireland system, which are regulated and operated separately, and are constituted under separate pieces of United Kingdom legislation.

==Great Britain==
Railways in Great Britain are run under a structure established by the Railways Act 1993 (as amended), which provided for the break-up of the former vertically integrated state railway, the British Railways Board, and the transfer of its operations into the private sector. The Secretary of State for Transport has overall responsibility for the railways within the UK Government.

The railway track and infrastructure is owned and operated by Network Rail, which is regulated by the Office of Rail &amp; Road (ORR).

In Great Britain, passenger trains are run under either franchises from the Department for Transport, or on an open access basis; which means their operators have no contract with government. Freight train operators have no contracts with government, and rely on the competitiveness and attractiveness of their product and services to maintain and increase their market shares.

Rolling stock is primarily owned by rolling stock leasing companies (ROSCOs).

In 2006, using powers in the Railways Act 2005, the Department for Transport took over most of the functions of the Strategic Rail Authority. The DfT now itself runs competitions for the award of passenger rail franchises, and, once awarded, monitors and enforces the contracts with the private sector franchisees. Franchises specify the passenger rail services which are to be run, and the quality and other conditions (for example, the cleanliness of trains, station facilities and opening hours, the punctuality and reliability of trains) which the operators have to meet. Some franchises receive subsidy from the DfT for doing so, and some are cash-positive, which means that the franchisee pays the DfT for the contract. Some franchises start life as subsidised and, over the tenure of their franchise period, move to being cash-positive.

The other regulatory authority for the privatised railway is the ORR, which, following the Railways Act 2005, is the combined economic and safety regulator. It replaced the Rail Regulator on 5 July 2004.

==Northern Ireland==
Unlike the other constituent countries of the United Kingdom, railways in Northern Ireland are a devolved matter. The Northern Ireland Minister for Regional Development has responsibility for railways in Northern Ireland. Even during direct rule, a Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office has always had responsibility for railways in Northern Ireland, and not the Secretary of State for Transport.

The structure of the railway industry in Northern Ireland is governed by the Transport Act 1967 (Northern Ireland), an Act of the former Parliament of Northern Ireland that still applies. This established a statutory corporation, the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company - which trades under the brand name Translink - whose members are appointed by the Minister for Regional Development. The corporation has established a wholly owned subsidiary, Northern Ireland Railways Company Limited - which trades as NI Railways - to carry out its functions relating to railways.

Unlike in Great Britain, where different companies run the network, provide rolling stock, and operate trains, NI Railways carries out all these activities itself in Northern Ireland, and is thus a vertically integrated railway, rather than merely a train operating company. The only exception is the Dublin to Belfast railway line, where services are operated jointly with Iarnród Éireann, the nationalised railway company in the Republic of Ireland, under the brand name Enterprise.

<text>Urban sprawl (also known as suburban sprawl or urban encroachment) is defined as &quot;the spreading of urban developments (such as houses and shopping centers) on undeveloped land near a city&quot;. Urban sprawl has been described as the unrestricted growth in many urban areas of housing, commercial development, and roads over large expanses of land, with little concern for very dense urban planning. Sometimes the urban areas described as the most &quot;sprawling&quot; are the most densely populated. In addition to describing a special form of urbanization, the term also relates to the social and environmental consequences associated with this development. In modern times some suburban areas described as &quot;sprawl&quot; have less detached housing and higher density than the nearby core city. Medieval suburbs suffered from the loss of protection of city walls, before the advent of industrial warfare. Modern disadvantages and costs include increased travel time, transport costs, pollution, and destruction of the countryside. The revenue for building and maintaining urban infrastructure in these areas are gained mostly through property and sales taxes. Most jobs in the US are now located in suburbs generating much of the revenue, although a lack of growth will require higher tax rates.

In Europe, the term &quot;peri-urbanisation&quot; is often used to denote similar dynamics and phenomena, but the term &quot;urban sprawl&quot; is currently being used by the European Environment Agency. There is widespread disagreement about what constitutes sprawl and how to quantify it. For example, some commentators measure sprawl by residential density, using the average number of residential units per acre in a given area. Others associate it with decentralization (spread of population without a well-defined centre), discontinuity (leapfrogging development, as defined below), segregation of uses, and so forth.

The term &quot;urban sprawl&quot; is highly politicized and almost always has negative connotations. It is criticized for causing environmental degradation, intensifying segregation, and undermining the vitality of existing urban areas, and is attacked on aesthetic grounds. The pejorative meaning of the term means that few openly support urban sprawl as such. The term has become a rallying cry for managing urban growth.

==Definition==
The term &quot;urban sprawl&quot; was often used in the letters between Lewis Mumford and Frederic J. Osborn, firstly by Osborn in his 1941 letter to Mumford and later by Mumford, generally condemning the waste of agricultural land and landscape due to suburban expansions. The term was used in an article in &quot;The Times&quot; in 1955 as a negative comment on the state of London&#x27;s outskirts. Definitions of sprawl vary; researchers in the field acknowledge that the term lacks precision. Batty et al. defined sprawl as &quot;uncoordinated growth: the expansion of community without concern for its consequences, in short, unplanned, incremental urban growth which is often regarded unsustainable&quot;. Bhatta et al. wrote in 2010 that despite a dispute over the precise definition of sprawl, there is a &quot;general consensus that urban sprawl is characterized by [an] unplanned and uneven pattern of growth, driven by a multitude of processes and leading to inefficient resource utilization&quot;.

Reid Ewing has shown that sprawl has typically been characterized as urban developments exhibiting at least one of the following characteristics: low-density or single-use development, strip development, scattered development, and/or leapfrog development (areas of development interspersed with vacant land). He argued that a better way to identify sprawl was to use indicators rather than characteristics because this was a more flexible and less arbitrary method. He proposed using &quot;accessibility&quot; and &quot;functional open space&quot; as indicators. Ewing&#x27;s approach has been criticized for assuming that sprawl is defined by negative characteristics.

What constitutes sprawl may be considered a matter of degree and will always be somewhat subjective under many definitions of the term. Ewing has also argued that suburban development does not, per se, constitute sprawl depending on the form it takes, although Gordon &amp; Richardson have argued that the term is sometimes used synonymously with suburbanization in a pejorative way.

===Examples and counterexamples===
According to the National Resources Inventory (NRI), about of land in the United States was developed between 1982 and 2017. Presently, the NRI classifies approximately 100,000 more square kilometres (40,000 square miles) (an area approximately the size of Kentucky) as developed than the Census Bureau classifies as urban. The difference in the NRI classification is that it includes rural development, which by definition cannot be considered to be &quot;urban&quot; sprawl. Currently, according to the 2000 Census, approximately 2.6 percent of the U.S. land area is urban. Approximately 0.8 percent of the nation&#x27;s land is in the 37 urbanized areas with more than 1,000,000 population. In 2002, these 37 urbanized areas supported around 40% of the total American population.

Nonetheless, some urban areas like Detroit have expanded geographically even while losing population. But it was not just urbanized areas in the U.S. that lost population and sprawled substantially. According to data in &quot;Cities and Automobile Dependence&quot; by Kenworthy and Laube (1999), urbanized area population losses occurred while there was an expansion of sprawl between 1970 and 1990 in Amsterdam, Netherlands; Brussels, Belgium; Copenhagen, Denmark; Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich, Germany; and Zürich, Switzerland, albeit without the dismantling of infrastructure that occurred in the United States.
Despite its sprawl, Metropolitan Los Angeles is the densest major urban area (over 1,000,000 population) in the US, being denser than the New York urban area and the San Francisco urban area. Most of metropolitan Los Angeles is built at more uniform low to moderate density, leading to a much higher overall density for the entire region. This is in contrast to New York, San Francisco or Chicago which have compact, high-density cores surrounded by areas of very low-density suburban periphery, such as eastern Suffolk County in the New York metro area and Marin County in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Some cases of sprawl challenge the definition of the term and what conditions are necessary for urban growth to be considered sprawl. Metropolitan regions such as Greater Mexico City, Delhi National Capital Region Beijing, and the Greater Tokyo Area are often regarded as sprawling despite being relatively dense and mixed use.

== History ==
Many theories speculate as to the reason for the creation of urban sprawl. The theory of &quot;flight from blight&quot; explains that aspects of living in urban areas, such as high taxes, crime rates, poor infrastructure and school qualities lead to many people moving out of urban areas and into surrounding suburban areas. According to &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot;, reasons why wealthier people move to suburbs include noise, pollution, crime, drug addiction, poverty, labor strikes, and breakdown of social services.

Others suggest that Urban Sprawl is a natural product of population increases, higher wages, and therefore better access to housing. Improvement in transportation also means that individuals are able to live further from large cities and industrial hubs, thus increasing demand for better housing further from the noise of cities. This leads to the creation of sprawling residential land development surrounding densely packed urban areas.

== Characteristics ==
Despite the lack of a clear agreed upon description of what defines sprawl most definitions often associate the following characteristics with sprawl.
=== Single-use development ===
This refers to a situation where commercial, residential, institutional and industrial areas are separated from one another. Consequently, large tracts of land are devoted to a single use and are segregated from one another by open space, infrastructure, or other barriers. As a result, the places where people live, work, shop, and recreate are far from one another, usually to the extent that walking, transit use and bicycling are impractical, so all these activities generally require a car. The degree to which different land uses are mixed together is often used as an indicator of sprawl in studies of the subject.

According to this criterion, China&#x27;s urbanization can be classified as &quot;high-density sprawl&quot;, a seemingly self-contradictory term coined by New Urbanist Peter Calthorpe. He explains that despite the high-rise buildings, China&#x27;s superblocks (huge residential blocks) are largely single-use and surrounded by giant arterial roads, which detach different functions of a city and create an environment unfriendly to pedestrians.

=== Job sprawl and spatial mismatch ===
Job sprawl is another land use symptom of urban sprawl and car-dependent communities. It is defined as low-density, geographically spread-out patterns of employment, where the majority of jobs in a given metropolitan area are located outside of the main city&#x27;s central business district (CBD), and increasingly in the suburban periphery. It is often the result of urban disinvestment, the geographic freedom of employment location allowed by predominantly car-dependent commuting patterns of many American suburbs, and many companies&#x27; desire to locate in low-density areas that are often more affordable and offer potential for expansion. Spatial mismatch is related to job sprawl and economic environmental justice. Spatial mismatch is defined as the situation where poor urban, predominantly minority citizens are left without easy access to entry-level jobs, as a result of increasing job sprawl and limited transportation options to facilitate a reverse commute to the suburbs.

Job sprawl has been documented and measured in various ways. It has been shown to be a growing trend in America&#x27;s metropolitan areas. The Brookings Institution has published multiple articles on the topic. In 2005, author Michael Stoll defined job sprawl simply as jobs located more than radius from the CBD, and measured the concept based on year 2000 U.S. Census data. Other ways of measuring the concept with more detailed rings around the CBD include a 2001 article by Edward Glaeser and Elizabeth Kneebone&#x27;s 2009 article, which show that sprawling urban peripheries are gaining employment while areas closer to the CBD are losing jobs. These two authors used three geographic rings limited to a radius around the CBD: or less, 3 to , and 10 to . Kneebone&#x27;s study showed the following nationwide breakdown for the largest metropolitan areas in 2006: 21.3% of jobs located in the inner ring, 33.6% of jobs in the 3–10 mile ring, and 45.1% in the 10–35 mile ring. This compares to the year 1998 – 23.3%, 34.2%, and 42.5% in those respective rings. The study shows CBD employment share shrinking, and job growth focused in the suburban and exurban outer metropolitan rings.

===Low-density===

Sprawl often refers to low-density development. There is no precise definition of &quot;low density&quot;, but it might commonly mean Single-family homes on large lots. Such buildings usually have fewer stories and are spaced farther apart, separated by lawns, landscaping, roads or parking lots. In the United States 2–4 houses per acre (5–10 per hectare) might be considered low-density while in the UK 8–12 per acre (or 20–30 per hectare) would still be considered low-density. Because more automobiles are used in the USA, much more land is designated for parking. The impact of low density development in many communities is that developed or &quot;urbanized&quot; land is increasing at a faster rate than the population is growing.

Overall density is often lowered by &quot;leapfrog development&quot;. This term refers to the relationship, or lack of it, between subdivisions. Such developments are typically separated by large green belts, i.e. tracts of undeveloped land, resulting in an overall density far lower even than the low density indicated by localized per-acre measurements. This is a 20th and 21st century phenomenon generated by the current custom of requiring a developer to provide subdivision infrastructure as a condition of development. Usually, the developer is required to set aside a certain percentage of the developed land for public use, including roads, parks and schools. In the past, when a local government built all the streets in a given location, the town could expand without interruption and with a coherent circulation system, because it had condemnation power. Private developers generally do not have such power (although they can sometimes find local governments willing to help), and often choose to develop on the tracts that happen to be for sale at the time they want to build, rather than pay extra or wait for a more appropriate location.

Some research argues that religious ideas about how humans should live (and die) promote low-density development and may contribute to urban sprawl.

===Conversion of agricultural land to urban use===
Land for sprawl is often taken from fertile agricultural lands, which are often located immediately surrounding cities; the extent of modern sprawl has consumed a large amount of the most productive agricultural land, as well as forest, desert and other wilderness areas. In the United States the seller may avoid tax on profit by using a tax break exempting like-kind exchanges from capital gains tax; proceeds from the sale are used to purchase agricultural land elsewhere and the transaction is treated as a &quot;swap&quot; or trade of like assets and no tax is due. Thus urban sprawl is subsidized by the tax code. In China, land has been converted from rural to urban use in advance of demand, leading to vacant rural land intended for future development, and eventual urban sprawl.

===Housing subdivisions===

Housing subdivisions are large tracts of land consisting entirely of newly built residences. New Urbanist architectural firm Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp; Company state that housing subdivisions &quot;are sometimes called villages, towns, and neighbourhoods by their developers, which is misleading since those terms denote places that are not exclusively residential&quot;. They are also referred to as developments.

Subdivisions often incorporate curved roads and cul-de-sacs. These subdivisions may offer only a few places to enter and exit the development, causing traffic to use high volume collector streets. All trips, no matter how short, must enter the collector road in a suburban system.

===Lawn===
After the Second World War, residential lawns became commonplace in suburbs, notably, but not exclusively in North America. The development of country clubs and golf courses in the early 20th century further promoted lawn culture in the United States. Lawns now take up a significant amount of land in suburban developments, contributing to sprawl.

===Commercial developments===

In areas of sprawl, commercial use is generally segregated from other uses. In the U.S. and Canada, these often take the form of strip malls, which refer to collections of buildings sharing a common parking lot, usually built on a high-capacity roadway with commercial functions (i.e., a &quot;strip&quot;). Similar developments in the United Kingdom are called Retail Parks. Strip malls consisting mostly of big box stores or category killers are sometimes called &quot;power centers&quot; (U.S.). These developments tend to be low-density; the buildings are single-story and there is ample space for parking and access for delivery vehicles. This character is reflected in the spacious landscaping of the parking lots and walkways and clear signage of the retail establishments. Some strip malls are undergoing a transformation into Lifestyle centers; entailing investments in common areas and facilities (plazas, cafes) and shifting tenancy from daily goods to recreational shopping.
Another prominent form of retail development in areas characterized by sprawl is the shopping mall. Unlike the strip mall, this is usually composed of a single building surrounded by a parking lot that contains multiple shops, usually &quot;anchored&quot; by one or more department stores. The function and size is also distinct from the strip mall. The focus is almost exclusively on recreational shopping rather than daily goods. Shopping malls also tend to serve a wider (regional) public and require higher-order infrastructure such as highway access and can have floorspaces in excess of . Shopping malls are often detrimental to downtown shopping centres of nearby cities since the shopping malls act as a surrogate for the city centre. Some downtowns have responded to this challenge by building shopping centres of their own.

Fast food chains are often built early in areas with low property values where the population is expected to boom and where large traffic is predicted, and set a precedent for future development. Eric Schlosser, in his book &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;, argues that fast food chains accelerate suburban sprawl and help set its tone with their expansive parking lots, flashy signs, and plastic architecture (65). Duany Plater Zyberk &amp; Company believe that this reinforces a destructive pattern of growth in an endless quest to move away from the sprawl that only results in creating more of it.

==Effect==

One of the major environmental problems associated with sprawl is land consumption, habitat loss and subsequent reduction in biodiversity. A review by Brian Czech and colleagues finds that urbanization endangers more species and is more geographically ubiquitous in the mainland United States than any other human activity. Urban sprawl is disruptive to native flora &amp; fauna and introduces invasive plants into their environments. Although the effects can be mitigated through careful maintenance of native vegetation, the process of ecological succession and public education, sprawl represents one of the primary threats to biodiversity.

Regions with high birth rates and immigration are therefore faced with environmental problems due to unplanned urban growth and emerging megacities such as Kolkata.

Other problems include:

* flooding, which results from increased impervious surfaces for roads and parking (&quot;see&quot; urban runoff)
* increased temperatures from heat islands, which leads to a significantly increased risk of mortality in elderly populations.
At the same time, the urban cores of these and nearly all other major cities in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan that did not annex new territory experienced the related phenomena of falling household size and, particularly in the U.S., &quot;white flight&quot;, sustaining population losses. This trend has slowed somewhat in recent years, as more people have regained an interest in urban living.

Due to the larger area consumed by sprawling suburbs compared to urban neighborhoods, more farmland and wildlife habitats are displaced per resident. As forest cover is cleared and covered with impervious surfaces (concrete and asphalt) in the suburbs, rainfall is less effectively absorbed into the groundwater aquifers. This threatens both the quality and quantity of water supplies. Sprawl increases water pollution as rain water picks up gasoline, motor oil, heavy metals, and other pollutants in runoff from parking lots and roads.

Gordon &amp; Richardson have argued that the conversion of agricultural land to urban use is not a problem due to the increasing efficiency of agricultural production; they argue that aggregate agricultural production is still more than sufficient to meet global food needs despite the expansion of urban land use.

=== Health ===
Sprawl leads to increased driving, which in turn leads to vehicle emissions that contribute to air pollution and its attendant negative impacts on human health. In addition, the reduced physical activity implied by increased automobile use has negative health consequences. Sprawl significantly predicts chronic medical conditions and health-related quality of life, but not mental health disorders. The American Journal of Public Health and the American Journal of Health Promotion, have both stated that there is a significant connection between sprawl, obesity, and hypertension. Loud vehicles can cause stress, prevent sleep, and minimize social interactions in public for people living in cities (especially homeless people).

In the years following World War II, when vehicle ownership was becoming widespread, public health officials recommended the health benefits of suburbs due to soot and industrial fumes in the city center. However, air in modern suburbs is not necessarily cleaner than air in urban neighborhoods. In fact, the most polluted air is on crowded highways, where people in suburbs tend to spend more time. On average, suburban residents generate more per capita pollution and carbon emissions than their urban counterparts because of their increased driving, as well as larger homes.

Sprawl also reduces the chance that people will take the bicycle for their commute which would be better for their health. Bicycles are a common mode of transportation for those living in urban centers due to many factors. One major factor many people consider relates to how, when one rides a bike to, say, their workplace, they are exercising as they do so. This multi-tasking is better for one&#x27;s health than automatic transport.

=== Safety ===
A heavy reliance on automobiles increases traffic throughout the city as well as automobile crashes, pedestrian injuries, and air pollution.
Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of five and twenty-four and is the leading accident-related cause for all age groups. Residents of more sprawling areas are generally at greater risk of dying in a car crash due to increased exposure to driving. Evidence indicates that pedestrians in sprawling areas are at higher risk than those in denser areas, although the relationship is less clear than for drivers and passengers in vehicles.

Research covered in the &quot;Journal of Economic Issues&quot; and &quot;State and Local Government Review&quot; shows a link between sprawl and emergency medical services response and fire department response delays.

=== Economy ===

Living in larger, more spread out spaces generally makes public services more expensive. Since car usage becomes endemic and public transport often becomes significantly more expensive, city planners are forced to build highway and parking infrastructure, which in turn decreases taxable land and revenue, and decreases the desirability of the area adjacent to such structures. Providing services such as water, sewers, road maintenance, and electricity is also more expensive per household in less dense areas, given that sprawl increases lengths of power lines, roads, and pipes, necessitating higher maintenance costs.

Residents of low-density areas spend a higher proportion of their income on transportation than residents of high density areas. The unplanned nature of outward urban development is commonly linked to increased dependency on cars. In 2003, a British newspaper calculated that urban sprawl would cause an economic loss of £3,905 per year, per person through cars alone, based on data from the RAC estimating that the average cost of operating a car in the UK at that time was £5,000 a year, while train travel (assuming a citizen commutes every day of the year, with a ticket cost of 3 pounds) would be only £1,095. Additionally, increased density increases the supply of housing in desirable areas, and thus, it also decreases housing prices in those areas (by the logic of supply and demand).

=== Social ===
Urban sprawl may be partly responsible for the decline in social capital in the United States. Compact neighborhoods can foster casual social interactions among neighbors, while sprawl creates barriers. Sprawl tends to replace public spaces with private spaces such as fenced-in backyards.

Critics of sprawl maintain that sprawl erodes quality of life. Duany and Plater-Zyberk believe that in traditional neighborhoods the nearness of the workplace to retail and restaurant space that provides cafes and convenience stores with daytime customers is an essential component to the successful balance of urban life. Furthermore, they state that the closeness of the workplace to homes also gives people the option of walking or riding a bicycle to work or school and that without this kind of interaction between the different components of life the urban pattern quickly falls apart. James Howard Kunstler has argued that poor aesthetics in suburban environments make them &quot;places not worth caring about&quot;, and that they lack a sense of history and identity.

Urban sprawl has class and racial implications in many parts of the world; the relative homogeneity of many sprawl developments may reinforce class and racial divides through residential segregation.

Numerous studies link increased population density with increased aggression. Some people believe that increased population density encourages crime and anti-social behavior. It is argued that human beings, while social animals, need significant amounts of social space or they become agitated and aggressive. However, the relationship between higher densities and increased social pathology has been largely discredited.

== Debate ==

According to Nancy Chin, a large number of effects of sprawl have been discussed in the academic literature in some detail; however, the most contentious issues can be reduced &quot;to an older set of arguments, between those advocating a planning approach and those advocating the efficiency of the market&quot;. Those who criticize sprawl tend to argue that sprawl creates more problems than it solves and should be more heavily regulated, while proponents argue that markets are producing the economically most efficient settlements possible in most situations, even if problems may exist. However, some market-oriented commentators believe that the current patterns of sprawl are in fact the result of distortions of the free market. Chin cautions that there is a lack of &quot;reliable empirical evidence to support the arguments made either for or against sprawl&quot;. She mentions that the lack of a common definition, the need for more quantitative measures &quot;a broader view both in time and space, and greater comparison with alternative urban forms&quot; would be necessary to draw firmer conclusions and conduct more fruitful debates.

Arguments opposing urban sprawl include concrete effects such as health and environmental issues as well as abstract consequences including neighborhood vitality. American public policy analyst Randal O&#x27;Toole of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, has argued that sprawl, thanks to the automobile, gave rise to affordable suburban neighborhoods for middle class and lower class individuals, including non-whites. He notes that efforts to combat sprawl often result in subsidizing development in wealthier and whiter neighborhoods while condemning and demolishing poorer minority neighborhoods.

=== Groups that oppose sprawl ===
The American Institute of Architects, American Planning Association, and Smart Growth America recommend against sprawl and instead endorses smart, mixed-use development, including buildings in close proximity to one another that cut down on automobile use, save energy, and promote walkable, healthy, well-designed neighborhoods. The Sierra Club, the San Francisco Bay Area&#x27;s Greenbelt Alliance, 1000 Friends of Oregon and counterpart organizations nationwide, and other environmental organizations oppose sprawl and support investment in existing communities. NumbersUSA, a national organization advocating immigration reduction, also opposes urban sprawl, and its founder, Roy Beck, specializes in the study of this issue.

=== Consumer preference ===

One of the primary debates around suburban sprawl is the extent to which sprawl is the result of consumer preference. Some, such as Peter Gordon, a professor of planning and economics at the University of Southern California&#x27;s School of Urban Planning and Development, argue that most households have shown a clear preference for low-density living and that this is a fact that should not be ignored by planners. Gordon and his frequent collaborator, Harry Richardson have argued that 
 They argue that sprawl generates enough benefits for consumers that they continue to choose it as a form of development over alternative forms, as demonstrated by the continued focus on sprawl type developments by most developers. However, other academics such as Reid Ewing argue that while a large segment of people prefer suburban living that does not mean that sprawl itself is preferred by consumers, and that a large variety of suburban environments satisfy consumer demand, including areas that mitigate the worst effects of sprawl. Others, for example Kenneth T. Jackson have argued that since low-density housing is often (notably in the U.S.) subsidized in a variety of ways, consumers&#x27; professed preferences for this type of living may be over-stated.

===Automobile dependency===
Whether urban sprawl increases the problems of automobile dependency or not, policies of smart growth have been fiercely contested issues over several decades. An influential study in 1989 by Peter Newman and Jeff Kenworthy compared 32 cities across North America, Australia, Europe and Asia. The study has been criticised for its methodology, but the main finding, that denser cities, particularly in Asia, have lower car use than sprawling cities, particularly in North America, has been largely accepted, although the relationship is clearer at the extremes across continents than it is within countries where conditions are more similar.

Within cities, studies from across many countries (mainly in the developed world) have shown that denser urban areas with greater mixture of land use and better public transport tend to have lower car use than less dense suburban and ex-urban residential areas. This usually holds true even after controlling for socio-economic factors such as differences in household composition and income. This does not necessarily imply that suburban sprawl causes high car use, however. One confounding factor, which has been the subject of many studies, is residential self-selection: people who prefer to drive tend to move towards low density suburbs, whereas people who prefer to walk, cycle or use transit tend to move towards higher density urban areas, better served by public transport. Some studies have found that, when self-selection is controlled for, the built environment has no significant effect on travel behavior. More recent studies using more sophisticated methodologies have generally refuted these findings: density, land use and public transport accessibility can influence travel behavior, although social and economic factors, particularly household income, usually exert a stronger influence.
Those not opposed to low density development argue that traffic intensities tend to be less, traffic speeds faster and, as a result, ambient air pollution is lower. (See demographia&#x27;s report.) Kansas City, Missouri is often cited as an example of ideal low-density development, with congestion below the mean and home prices below comparable Midwestern cities. Wendell Cox and Randal O&#x27;Toole are leading figures supporting lower density development.

Longitudinal (time-lapse) studies of commute times in major metropolitan areas in the United States have shown that commute times decreased for the period 1969 to 1995 even though the geographic size of the city increased. Other studies suggest, however, that possible personal benefits from commute time savings have been at the expense of environmental costs in the form of longer average commute distances, rising vehicles-miles-traveled (VMT) per worker, and despite road expansions, worsening traffic congestion.

=== Transportation inequality ===
Critics of urban sprawl say that the United States&#x27; improper treatment of minority groups&#x27; access to transportation is a major downside to the continuation of urban sprawl. In many urban centers, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, transportation in minority areas is lacking. As found by Kate Baldridge of Golden Gate University Law, areas with high minority populations typically see less than adequate transportation options, leading to overcrowded and unsafe transportation routes that do not provide a comprehensive means of transportation. This disparity is made more evident because minority residents are more reliant on public transportation. According to Baldridge, this means that minority groups cannot move from urban areas, while people with higher incomes and thus better access to transportation can move out of urban areas and into surrounding suburbs.

===Paradox of intensification===

Reviewing the evidence on urban intensification, smart growth and their effects on travel behaviour Melia et al. (2011) found support for the arguments of both supporters and opponents of smart growth measures to counteract urban sprawl. Planning policies that increase population densities in urban areas do tend to reduce car use, but the effect is a weak one, so doubling the population density of a particular area will not halve the frequency or distance of car use.

These findings led them to propose the paradox of intensification, which states:

=== Risk of increased housing prices ===

There is also some concern that anti-sprawl policies will increase housing prices. Some research suggests Oregon has had the largest housing affordability loss in the nation, but other research shows that Portland&#x27;s price increases are comparable to other Western cities.

In Australia, it is claimed by some that housing affordability has hit &quot;crisis levels&quot; due to &quot;urban consolidation&quot; policies implemented by state governments. In Sydney, the ratio of the price of a house relative to income is 9:1. The issue has at times been debated between the major political parties.

=== Proposed alternatives ===

Many critics concede that sprawl produces some negative externalities; however there is some dispute about the most effective way to reduce these negative effects. Gordon &amp; Richardson for example argue that the costs of building new public transit is disproportionate to the actual environmental or economic benefits, that land use restrictions will increase the cost of housing and restrict economic opportunity, that infill possibilities are too limited to make a major difference to the structure of American cities, and that the government would need to coerce most people to live in a way that they do not want to in order to substantially change the impact of sprawl. They argue that the property market should be deregulated to allow different people to live as they wish, while providing a framework of market based fees (such as emission fees, congestion charging or road pricing) to mitigate many of the problems associated with sprawl such as congestion and increased pollution.

===Early attempts at combatting urban sprawl===

Starting in the early 20th century, environmentalist opposition to urban sprawl began to coalesce, with roots in the garden city movement, as well as pressure from campaign groups such as the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE).

Under Herbert Morrison&#x27;s 1934 leadership of the London County Council, the first formal proposal was made by the Greater London Regional Planning Committee &quot;to provide a reserve supply of public open spaces and of recreational areas and to establish a green belt or girdle of open space&quot;. It was again included in an advisory Greater London Plan prepared by Patrick Abercrombie in 1944. The Town and Country Planning Act of 1947 expressly incorporated green belts into all further national urban developments.

New provisions for compensation in the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act allowed local authorities around the country to incorporate green belt proposals in their first development plans. The codification of Green Belt policy and its extension to areas other than London came with the historic Circular 42/55 inviting local planning authorities to consider the establishment of Green Belts. The first urban growth boundary in the U.S. was in Fayette County, Kentucky, in 1958.

==== Maryland ====
Maryland underwent many &quot;Smart Growth&quot; initiatives, starting in 1997 with the Smart Growth Areas Act. This act allocated funding towards areas already undergoing growth or areas with development plans. Maryland also implemented the 1997 Rural Legacy Act, which distributed grants to private land owners and allowed them to purchase development rights. Brownfields Voluntary Cleanup and Revitalization Incentive Programs also incentivized property owners to use previously contaminated properties to avoid liability for the property. The state also offered incentives, such as tax breaks and loans for repairs to contaminated areas. Another program the state of Maryland created was the Job Creation Tax Credit Program, which encouraged businesses to relocate to select areas, reducing the intensity of urban sprawl in some areas. The Live Near Your Work Program also incentivized employees to purchase homes closer to work. This led to a reduced commute time and more emphasis on homeownership rather than renting.

=== Contemporary anti-sprawl initiatives ===

The term &quot;smart growth&quot; has been particularly used in North America. The terms &quot;compact city&quot; and &quot;urban intensification&quot; are often used to describe similar concepts in Europe, and particularly in the UK, where it has influenced government policy and planning practice in recent years.

The state of Oregon enacted a law in 1973 limiting the area urban areas could occupy, through urban growth boundaries. As a result, Portland, the state&#x27;s largest urban area, has become a leader in smart growth policies that seek to make urban areas more compact (they are called urban consolidation policies). After the creation of this boundary, the population density of the urbanized area increased somewhat (from 1,135 in 1970 to 1,290 per km2 in 2000.) Although the growth boundary has not been tight enough to vastly increase density, the consensus is that the growth boundaries have protected great amounts of wild areas and farmland around the metro area.

Much of San Francisco Bay Area has also adopted urban growth boundaries; 25 of its cities and 5 of its counties have urban growth boundaries. Many of these were adopted with the support and advocacy of Greenbelt Alliance, a non-profit land conservation and urban planning organization.

In other areas, the design principles of New Urbanism have been employed to combat urban sprawl. The concept of circular flow land use management has been developed in Europe to reduce land take by urban sprawl through promoting inner-city and brownfield development.

Although cities such as Los Angeles are well known for sprawling suburbs, policies and public opinion are changing. Transit-oriented development, in which higher-density mixed-use areas are permitted or encouraged near transit stops, is encouraging more compact development in certain areas: particularly those with light and heavy rail transit systems.

Bicycles are the preferred means of travel in many countries: Also, bicycles are permitted in public transit. Businesses in areas of some towns in which bicycle use is high are thriving. Bicycles and transit contribute in two important ways toward the success of businesses:
# People living the closest to these business districts on average have more money to spend locally because they spend less on their cars.
# Because such people rely more on bicycling, walking, and transit than on driving, they tend to focus more of their commerce on locally-owned neighborhood businesses that are convenient for them to reach.

Walkability is a measure of how friendly an area is to walking. Walkability has many health, environmental, and economic benefits. However, evaluating walkability is challenging because it requires the consideration of many subjective factors. Factors influencing walkability include the presence or absence and quality of footpaths, sidewalks, or other pedestrian right-of-ways, traffic and road conditions, land use patterns, building accessibility, and safety, among others. Walkability is an important concept in sustainable urban design.

Land use policies are one potential avenue to reduce the effects of urban sprawl. These policies take the form of boundaries to urban growth, regional development rights, and development centralized in urban areas. Housing policies, such as inclusionary zoning, rental vouchers in suburban areas, and a focus on employer-assisted housing are another approach to combatting urban sprawl. Gasoline taxes and increased funding towards the construction of public transportation also help to reduce the necessity of commuting in and out of urban areas.

<doc id="655314" wikidata="Q5634372" url="?curid=655314" title="HMS Solebay (D70)">
<text>HMS &quot;Solebay&quot; was a of the Royal Navy (RN). She was named after the Battle of Solebay which took place in 1672 between an Anglo-French force and the Dutch Navy during the Third Anglo-Dutch War. &quot;Solebay&quot; was built by R. &amp; W. Hawthorn, Leslie &amp; Company Limited on the Tyne. She was launched on 22 February 1944 and commissioned on 25 September 1945.

==History==
&quot;Solebay&quot; was intended to join the 19th Destroyer Flotilla of the British Pacific Fleet, but the war against Japan ended while &quot;Solebay&quot; was working up in the Mediterranean, and so she returned to Home Waters. She subsequently became Captain (D), or leader, of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Home Fleet which was based in the United Kingdom. &quot;Solebay&quot; also took part in Operation Deadlight, the large-scale destruction of the German U-boat fleet, and which resulted in over one hundred of the boats being sunk in a variety of ways.

In June 1953, &quot;Solebay&quot; was involved in the 1953 Fleet Review at Spithead, which took place in celebration of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. &quot;Solebay&quot; was positioned in the middle of her sister ships and . In July that year, &quot;Solebay&quot; was placed in Reserve with the rest of her flotilla.

In 1957, &quot;Solebay&quot; returned to active service, becoming Captain (D) of the 1st Destroyer Squadron, which saw service with the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. In 1959, while still part of that squadron, &quot;Solebay&quot; deployed to the Far East. While there, tragedy struck her sister-ship, , which had collided with the Indian light cruiser . &quot;Solebay&quot;, along with another sister-ship, towed the heavily damaged &quot;Hogue&quot; to a nearby base.

After returning home in 1960, &quot;Solebay&quot; subsequently saw service once more in the Mediterranean, when she and the rest of the 1st Destroyer Squadron deployed to that region to relieve the 5th Destroyer Squadron. During this deployment &quot;Solebay&quot; accidentally rammed her sister-ship , leader of the 7th Destroyer Squadron, while at Malta, delaying that Squadron&#x27;s departure from the Mediterranean. While there, &quot;Solebay&quot; acted as escort for the royal yacht , carrying Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, who were visiting Italy on a state visit. &quot;Solebay&quot; subsequently joined the Home Fleet.

She once more joined up with the yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; and the Queen in November–December 1961, when &quot;Solebay&quot; formed part of the escort during the Queen&#x27;s visit to West Africa.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
In 1962, &quot;Solebay&quot;″s eventful career came to an end, when she was decommissioned and placed on the disposal list, becoming the Harbour Training Ship, being based at Portsmouth. She arrived at Troon for breaking up on 11 August 1967.

<doc id="655326" wikidata="Q367591" url="?curid=655326" title="Western fiction">
<text>Western fiction is a genre of literature set in the American Old West frontier and typically set from the late eighteenth to the late nineteenth century. Well-known writers of Western fiction include Zane Grey from the early 20th century and Louis L&#x27;Amour from the mid-20th century. The genre peaked around the early 1960s, largely due to the popularity of televised Westerns such as &quot;Bonanza&quot;. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside a few west American states, only carry a small number of Western fiction books.

==History==

===Pre-1850s===
The predecessor of the Western in American literature emerged early with tales of the frontier. The most famous of the early 19th-century frontier novels were James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s five novels comprising the &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot;. Cooper&#x27;s novels were largely set in what was at the time the American frontier: the Appalachian Mountains and areas west of there. As did his novel &quot;The Prairie&quot; (1824), most later Westerns would typically take place west of the Mississippi River.

The notable writer Washington Irving was inspired by Cooper and wrote tales of the American frontier beginning with &quot;A Tour on the Prairies&quot; which related his recent travels on the frontier. In 1834, he was approached by fur magnate John Jacob Astor, who convinced him to write a history of his fur trading colony in Astoria, Oregon. Irving made quick work of Astor&#x27;s project, shipping the fawning biographical account &quot;Astoria&quot; in February 1836.

===1850s–1900===
The Western as a specialized genre got its start in the &quot;penny dreadfuls&quot; and later the &quot;dime novels&quot;. Published in June 1860, &quot;Malaeska; the Indian Wife of the White Hunter&quot; is considered the first dime novel. These cheaply made books were hugely successful and capitalized on the many stories that were being told about the mountain men, outlaws, settlers, and lawmen who were taming the western frontier. Many of these novels were fictionalized stories based on actual people, such as Billy the Kid, Buffalo Bill, Wyatt Earp (who was still alive at the time), Wild Bill Hickok, and Jesse James.

===1900s–1930s===
By 1900, the new medium of pulp magazines helped to relate these adventures to easterners. Meanwhile, non-American authors, like the German Karl May, picked up the genre, went to full novel length, and made it hugely popular and successful in continental Europe from about 1880 on, though they were generally dismissed as trivial by the literary critics of the day. One of the most famous pulp works of the era was Johnston McCulley&#x27;s first Zorro novel, &quot;The Curse of Capistrano&quot; (1919).

Popularity grew with the publication of Owen Wister&#x27;s novel &quot;The Virginian&quot; (1902) and especially Zane Grey&#x27;s &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; (1912). The first Hopalong Cassidy stories by Clarence Mulford appeared in 1904, both as dime novels and in pulp magazines. When pulp magazines exploded in popularity in the 1920s, Western fiction greatly benefited (as did the author Max Brand, who excelled at the Western short story). Pulp magazines that specialised in Westerns include &quot;Cowboy Stories&quot;, &quot;Ranch Romances&quot;, &quot;Star Western&quot;, &quot;West&quot;, and &quot;Western Story Magazine&quot;. The simultaneous popularity of Western movies in the 1920s also helped the genre.

===1940s–1960s===
In the 1940s several seminal Westerns were published, including &quot;The Ox-Bow Incident&quot; (1940) by Walter van Tilburg Clark, &quot;The Big Sky&quot; (1947) and &quot;The Way West&quot; (1949) by A.B. Guthrie Jr., and &quot;Shane&quot; (1949) by Jack Schaefer. Many other Western authors gained readership in the 1950s, such as Ray Hogan, Louis L&#x27;Amour, and Luke Short.

The genre peaked around the early 1960s, largely due to the tremendous number of Westerns on television. The burnout of the American public on television Westerns in the late 1960s seemed to have an effect on the literature as well, and interest in Western literature began to wane. In 1968 Charles Portis published &quot;True Grit&quot;, which became the most successful work of the era.

==== Western comics ====

Western novels, films and pulps gave birth to Western comics, which were very popular, particularly from the late 1940s until , when the comics began to turn to reprints. This can particularly be seen at Marvel Comics, where Westerns began and thrived until 1967, when one of their flagship titles, &quot;Kid Colt Outlaw&quot; (1949–1979), ceased to have new stories and entered the reprint phase. Other notable long-running Marvel Western comics included &quot;Rawhide Kid&quot; (1955–1957, 1960–1979) &quot;Two-Gun Kid&quot; (1948–1962), and &quot;Marvel Wild Western&quot; (1948–1957).

DC Comics published the long-running series &quot;All-Star Western&quot; (1951–1961) and &quot;Western Comics&quot; (1948–1961), and Charlton Comics published &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; (1957–1983) and &quot;Cheyenne Kid&quot; (1957–1973). Magazine Enterprises&#x27; &quot;Straight Arrow&quot; ran from 1950 to 1956, and Prize Comics&#x27; &quot;Prize Comics Western&quot; ran from 1948 to 1956.

Fawcett Comics published a number of Western titles, including &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot; from 1948 to 1953. They also published comics starring actors known for their Western roles, including &quot;Tom Mix Western&quot; (1948–1953) and &quot;Gabby Hayes Western&quot; (1948–1953). Similarly, Dell Comics published Roy Rogers comics from 1948 to 1961, and Magazine Enterprises published &quot;Charles Starrett as the Durango Kid&quot; from 1949 to 1955.

The Franco-Belgian comic-series Lucky Luke by Morris (cartoonist) and René Goscinny is one of the most famous and estimated Western-comics in Europe.

The popular Western comic strip &quot;Red Ryder&quot; was syndicated in hundreds of American newspapers from 1938 to 1964.

===1970s and 1980s===
In the 1970s, the work of Louis L&#x27;Amour began to catch hold of most Western readers and he has dominated the Western reader lists ever since. George G. Gilman also maintained a cult following for several years in the 1970s and 1980s. Larry McMurtry&#x27;s and Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s works remain notable. Specifically, McMurtry&#x27;s &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; and McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; (both published in 1985) are recognized as major masterpieces both within and beyond the genre. Elmer Kelton, mostly noted for his novels &quot;The Good Old Boys&quot; and &quot;The Time it Never Rained&quot;, was voted by the Western Writers of America as the &quot;Best Western Writer of All Time&quot;. Early in the 1970s Indiana novelist Marilyn Durham wrote two popular Western novels, &quot;The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing&quot; and &quot;Dutch Uncle&quot;.

Western readership as a whole began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s. A partial exception was an innovation, the so-called adult Western. As Robert J. Randisi puts it, &quot;it&#x27;s a western novel with sex in it. That&#x27;s right, the cowboy has sex with women. A new idea? Probably not, but heretofore this had not been seen in western novels (certainly not by Max Brand, Zane Grey, Owen Wister or Louis L&#x27;Amour). What these books actually showed was that men and women really did have sex in the old west. (Back when I started the series a rigidly traditional western writer of my acquaintance insisted to me that &quot;women did not have orgasms in the old west.&quot;).&quot;

===1990s and 2000s===
Readership of Western fiction reached a new low in the first decade of the twenty-first century, and most bookstores, outside a few western states, only carry a small number of Western fiction books. Nevertheless, several Western fiction series are published monthly, such as &quot;The Trailsman, Slocum, Longarm&quot; and &quot;The Gunsmith&quot;; these are all adult Westerns. Canadian author Guy Vanderhaeghe wrote a trilogy of Western novels: &quot;The Englishman&#x27;s Boy&quot;, &quot;The Last Crossing&quot;, and &quot;A Good Man&quot;. Other more recent Western authors include Ivan Doig and William Kittredge. The genre has seen the rumblings of a revival, and 2008 saw the publication of an all-Western short story magazine &quot;Great Western Fiction&quot; which was published by Dry River Publishing in Colorado. Nevertheless, the magazine was short-lived and folded after only two issues. One of the most successful Western novels in recent times was &quot;The Sisters Brothers&quot; (2011) by Patrick deWitt.

==Organizations==
Western authors are represented by the Western Writers of America, who present the annual Spur Awards and Owen Wister Award for Lifetime Achievement. The organization was founded in 1953 to promote the literature of the American West. While the founding members were mostly Western fiction writers, the organization began getting a number of other members from other backgrounds such as historians, regional history buffs, and writers from other genres.

Western Fictioneers, founded in 2010, is a professional writers&#x27; group that encourages and promotes the traditional Westerns. It is the only professional writers&#x27; organization composed entirely of authors who have written Western fiction. Fans of the genre may join as patron members. The Western Fictioneers&#x27; annual Peacemakers competition awards prizes in many categories of Western writing.

<doc id="655334" wikidata="Q7977955" url="?curid=655334" title="Weak interpretability">
<text>In mathematical logic, weak interpretability is a notion of translation of logical theories, introduced together with interpretability by Alfred Tarski in 1953.

Let &quot;T&quot; and &quot;S&quot; be formal theories. Slightly simplified, &quot;T&quot; is said to be weakly interpretable in &quot;S&quot; if, and only if, the language of &quot;T&quot; can be translated into the language of &quot;S&quot; in such a way that the translation of every theorem of &quot;T&quot; is consistent with &quot;S&quot;. Of course, there are some natural conditions on admissible translations here, such as the necessity for a translation to preserve the logical structure of formulas.

A generalization of weak interpretability, tolerance, was introduced by Giorgi Japaridze in 1992.

<doc id="655335" wikidata="Q147878" url="?curid=655335" title="Ivan's Childhood">
<text>Ivan&#x27;s Childhood (), sometimes released as My Name Is Ivan in the US, is a 1962 Soviet war drama film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. Co-written by Mikhail Papava, Andrei Konchalovsky and an uncredited Tarkovsky, it is based on Vladimir Bogomolov&#x27;s 1957 short story &quot;Ivan&quot;. The film features child actor Nikolai Burlyayev along with Valentin Zubkov, Evgeny Zharikov, Stepan Krylov, Nikolai Grinko, and Tarkovsky&#x27;s then wife Irma Raush.

&quot;Ivan&#x27;s Childhood&quot; tells the story of orphaned boy Ivan, whose parents were killed by the invading German forces, and his experiences during World War II. &quot;Ivan&#x27;s Childhood&quot; was one of several Soviet films of its period, such as &quot;The Cranes Are Flying&quot; and &quot;Ballad of a Soldier&quot;, that looked at the human cost of war and did not glorify the war experience as did films produced before the Khrushchev Thaw. In a 1962 interview, Tarkovsky stated that in making the film he wanted to &quot;convey all [his] hatred of war&quot;, and that he chose childhood &quot;because it is what contrasts most with war.&quot;

&quot;Ivan&#x27;s Childhood&quot; was Tarkovsky&#x27;s first feature film. It won him critical acclaim and made him internationally known. It won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and the Golden Gate Award at the San Francisco International Film Festival, both in 1962. The film was also selected as the Soviet entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 36th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee. Famous filmmakers such as Ingmar Bergman, Sergei Parajanov and Krzysztof Kieślowski praised the film and cited it as an influence on their work.

==Plot==
After a brief dream sequence, Ivan Bondarev, a 12-year-old Russian boy, wakes up and crosses a war-torn landscape to a swamp, then swims across a river. On the other side, he is seized by Russian soldiers and brought to the young Lieutenant Galtsev, who interrogates him. The boy insists that he call &quot;Number 51 at Headquarters&quot; and report his presence. Galtsev is reluctant, but when he eventually makes the call, he is told by Lieutenant-Colonel Gryaznov to give the boy a pencil and paper to make his report, which will be given the highest priority, and to treat him well. Through a series of dream sequences and conversations between different characters, it is revealed that Ivan&#x27;s mother and sister (and probably his father, a border guard) have been killed by German soldiers. He got away and joined a group of partisans. When the group was surrounded, they put him on a plane. After the escape, he was sent to a boarding school, but he ran away and joined an army unit under the command of Gryaznov.

Burning for revenge, Ivan insists on fighting on the front line. Taking advantage of his small size, he is successful on reconnaissance missions. Gryaznov and the other soldiers grow fond of him and want to send him to a military school. They give up their idea when Ivan tries to run away and rejoin the partisans. He is determined to avenge the death of his family and others, such as those killed at the Maly Trostenets extermination camp (which he mentions that he has seen).

Finally, Kholin and Galtsev ferry Ivan across the river late at night. He disappears through the swampy forest. The others return to the other bank after cutting down the bodies of two Soviet scouts hanged by the Germans.

The final scenes then switch to Berlin under Soviet occupation after the fall of the Third Reich. Captain Kholin has been killed in action. Galtsev finds a document showing that Ivan was caught and hanged by the Germans. As Galtsev enters the execution room, a final flashback of Ivan&#x27;s childhood shows the young boy running across a beach after a little girl in happier times. The final image is of a dead tree on the beach.

==Production==
&quot;Ivan&#x27;s Childhood&quot; was Tarkovsky&#x27;s first feature film, shot two years after his diploma film &quot;The Steamroller and the Violin&quot;. The film is based on the 1957 short story &quot;Ivan&quot; () by Vladimir Bogomolov, which was translated into more than twenty languages. It drew the attention of the screenwriter Mikhail Papava, who changed the story line and made Ivan more of a hero. Papava called his screenplay &quot;Second Life&quot; (, ). In this screenplay Ivan is not executed, but sent to the Majdanek concentration camp, from where he is freed by the advancing Soviet army. The final scene of this screenplay shows Ivan meeting one of the officers of the army unit in a train compartment. Bogomolov, unsatisfied with this ending, intervened and the screenplay was changed to reflect the source material.

Mosfilm gave the screenplay to the young film director Eduard Abalov. Shooting was aborted and the film project was terminated in December 1960, since the first version of the film drew heavy criticism from the arts council, and the quality was deemed unsatisfactory and unusable. In June 1961 the film project was given to Tarkovsky, who had applied for it after being told about &quot;Ivan&#x27;s Childhood&quot; by cinematographer Vadim Yusov. Work on the film resumed in the same month. The film was shot for the most part near Kanev at the Dnieper River.

Tarkovsky continued his collaboration with cinematographer Vadim Yusov, who was the cameraman in Tarkovsky&#x27;s diploma film &quot;The Steamroller and the Violin&quot;. Nikolai Burlyayev had played a role in Andrei Konchalovsky&#x27;s student film &quot;The Boy and the Pigeon&quot;. Konchalovsky was a friend and fellow student of Tarkovsky at the State Institute of Cinematography (VGIK), and thus Burlyayev was also cast for the role of Ivan. He had to pass several screen tests, but according to Burlyayev it is unclear whether anyone else auditioned for the role. Burlyayev would later play Boriska in Tarkovsky&#x27;s second feature, &quot;Andrei Rublev&quot;.

===Style===
Nature takes up an important role in &quot;Ivan&#x27;s Childhood&quot;. Before the film’s release, the Stalinist viewpoint on war cinema in the 1930s and 40s was that of instrumentalizing nature as a means to serve human agency in context of violence. &quot;Ivan&#x27;s Childhood&quot; is produced during the stagnating period of Khrushchev thaw, and as a result instead is considered pioneer in its use of extensive and predominant representation of nature. In the film, nature is omnipresent and is captured both in Ivan’s dreams and in scenes of violence, it’s portrayed as an active witness of human violence, but also as a rebellious force itself entangled in battle, namely as a victim of war. Furthermore, Tarkovsky’s framing of nature in tracking shots was also intended as visual poetry adding a layer of artistic elegance to the film. The way in which he balances poetic representations of nature and violent narratives of war unveils his pursuit of an aesthetic representation of war, and thus also exhibiting his distinguishing cinematographic signature.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Ivan&#x27;s Childhood&quot; was one of Tarkovsky&#x27;s most commercially successful films, selling 16.7 million tickets in the Soviet Union. Tarkovsky himself was displeased with some aspects of the film; in his book &quot;Sculpting in Time&quot;, he writes at length about subtle changes to certain scenes that he regrets not implementing.
===Critical response===
The film received international acclaim on its release. &quot;Ivan&#x27;s Childhood&quot; has an approval rating of 100% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 25 reviews, and an average rating of 8.9/10.The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Ostensibly an atypical Tarkovsky work (less than 100 minutes!), &quot;Ivan&#x27;s Childhood&quot; carries the poetry and passion that would characterize the director from here on&quot;.
It attracted the attention of many intellectuals, including Ingmar Bergman who said, &quot;My discovery of Tarkovsky&#x27;s first film was like a miracle. Suddenly, I found myself standing at the door of a room the keys of which had, until then, never been given to me. It was a room I had always wanted to enter and where he was moving freely and fully at ease.&quot;

Jean-Paul Sartre wrote an article on the film, defending it against a highly critical article in the Italian newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Unità&quot; written by Alberto Moravia and saying that it was one of the most beautiful films he had ever seen. In a later interview, Tarkovsky (who did not consider the film to be among his best work) admitted to agreeing with Moravia&#x27;s criticisms at the time, finding Sartre&#x27;s defense &quot;too philosophical and speculative&quot;. Filmmakers Sergei Parajanov and Krzysztof Kieślowski praised the film and cited it as an influence on their work.

===Awards and nominations===
&quot;Ivan&#x27;s Childhood&quot; received numerous awards, 
including the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and the Golden Gate Award at the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1962. The film was also selected as the Soviet entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 36th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.

==Film restoration==
In 2016 the film was digitally restored. The newest version was highly praised by &quot;The Independent&quot; who called it &quot;The most lyrical war movie ever made pristinely restored&quot;.

<text>Doryteuthis plei, also known as the slender inshore squid or arrow squid, is a medium-sized squid belonging to the family Loliginidae. It occurs abundantly in coastal waters of the Atlantic Ocean, from Argentina northward to North Carolina.

== Description ==
As both common names imply, these squid have elongate, cylindrical bodies with a length to width ratio of 7:1. The arms are in contrast short and weak; the two tentacles are somewhat less than the mantle length. The rhombus-shaped fins are large, up to about 50 percent of the mantle length. Running the ventral length of the mantle is a noticeable ridge. The squid are a reddish orange colour with a large complement of chromatophores.

The suckers of the arms possess blunt teeth. On the meaty ends (&quot;clubs&quot;) of the tentacles, there are four rows of suckers; the inner two (&quot;mesial&quot;) rows are three times as large as the outer two (&quot;marginal&quot;) rows. The larger suckers have horny rings with up to 45 teeth.

These squid reach a maximum mantle length of 33 centimetres in males and 22 centimetres in females. Sexual dimorphism is apparent, with the left ventral arm in males modified into a hectocotylus; this is used to facilitate fertilization during mating. Males also have a number of purple stripes running lengthwise on the ventral side of the mantle; along with other visual cues produced by chromatophores, these stripes are used in elaborate courtship displays.

== Ecology ==
Due to their abundance, slender inshore squid are important to both commercial and subsistence fisheries. During the annual summer mating season, the squid congregate in large numbers near shore. During the austral summer in waters off Brazil, annual catches may reach 763 metric tonnes.

While there may be safety in their numbers, the squid are an important prey item for large fish such as tuna and sharks and a number of cetaceans: pygmy killer whales, orcas, Atlantic spotted dolphins, rough-toothed dolphins, and bottlenose dolphins are all known predators of slender inshore squid. Other predators include South African and Antarctic fur seals.

The squid prey upon several species of estuarine fish, including: killifish, mosquitofish and mollies. Small crustaceans such as grass shrimp are also taken.

<text>Blixa Bargeld (born 12 January 1959) is a German musician who has been the lead singer of the band Einstürzende Neubauten since its formation in 1980. Bargeld was also a founding member of the Australian rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, serving as a member from 1983 until his departure in 2003.

==Early life==
Bargeld left school prior to completion and is self-taught. He experimented with audio equipment as a teenager, including the disassembling of tape recorders. The first album that he owned was by Pink Floyd, but he quickly moved on to German krautrock acts such as Kraftwerk, Neu! and Can, which he described as his biggest influences at the time.

Bargeld is from the Tempelhof area of West Berlin; he moved out of his parents&#x27; home in the late 1970s. A 2008 documentary featured him visiting his mother and talking to her about his childhood and the relationship that he had with his parents.

His name came from Blixa, a popular brand of felt-tip pens and Bargeld, which literally translates to &quot;cash&quot; and also referenced the artist Johannes Theodor Baargeld.

==Career==
In 1980, Bargeld founded the group Einstürzende Neubauten. Bargeld spoke of the early days of Neubauten in 2010:

The starting point for Neubauten was more that we didn&#x27;t have anything, so I didn&#x27;t really have the choice to say &quot;I am doing this, I am doing that, or maybe I should play organ&quot;. I didn&#x27;t have any of these things, and I could not afford any of these things, and neither could anybody else in the group. It was more of the logical consequence of what can we obtain, and that&#x27;s how it turned out. It certainly didn&#x27;t start out as an artistic concept to say &quot;let&#x27;s do something different&quot;, it started as an extension of the live situation as it already was.
Around this time, Bargeld became involved with the German film scene, appearing in &quot;Kalt wie eis&quot; in 1981 and &quot;Berlin Now&quot; in 1984, performing music in both.

From 1983 to 2003, Bargeld was a guitarist and backing vocalist with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. He also sang lead vocals with Cave on several songs, such as &quot;The Carny&quot; and &quot;The Weeping Song&quot;. Cave first saw Bargeld performing with Einstürzende Neubauten on TV while the Birthday Party, Cave&#x27;s band at the time, were touring in Amsterdam. He described the music as &quot;mournful&quot;, Bargeld as looking &quot;destroyed&quot;, and his screams as &quot;a sound you would expect to hear from strangled cats or dying children&quot;.

Bargeld played guitar on the Gun Club song &quot;Yellow Eyes&quot; from their 1987 album &quot;Mother Juno&quot;. He also played on the album &quot;Novice&quot; by Alain Bashung in 1989.

Since the mid-1990s, Bargeld has appeared live with his solo &quot;Rede/Speech Performances&quot;. During these performances, usually supported by Neubauten&#x27;s sound engineer Boris Wilsdorf, he works with microphones, sound effects, overdubbing with the help of sampler loops and speaks English or German. The performed pieces include a vocal creation of the DNA of an angel and a parody of a techno song.

In 2000 he worked together with Oliver Augst on the music for the plays &quot;Rosa Melonen Schnitt Freude&quot; based on words by Gertrude Stein and &quot;Rom, Blicke&quot; by Rolf Dieter Brinkmann, which they also performed together in Italy, Germany and Austria. 

In 2007, Bargeld started a collaborative project with Alva Noto (a.k.a. Carsten Nicolai) called ANBB, an abbreviation of Noto&#x27;s and Bargeld&#x27;s initials. An EP, &quot;Ret Marut Handshake&quot;, was released on 26 June 2010, followed later that year by a full-length album &quot;Mimikry&quot;.

In June 2013, Bargeld collaborated with Italian composer Teho Teardo for an album called &quot;Still Smiling&quot;, which was released on the Specula record label. A music video for the song &quot;Mi Scusi&quot; was created and an Italian tour was scheduled.

In early October 2014, Neubauten announced 24 November 2014 as the release date for their next album, &quot;Lament&quot;, described as a &quot;concept album based on a live performance and installation commissioned by the Flemish city of Diksmuide, Belgium to mark the centenary of the start of the First World War in 1914&quot;. Bargeld explained in the official press release: &quot;The Second World War is nothing but the elongation of the first one … As a child of the post Second World War era, and the resulting division of Germany and Berlin, I’m of course hugely influenced in my upbringing about the results of that.&quot;

Bargeld explained in October 2014 that Neubauten is essentially a materialistic band, leading them to employ two scientific researchers to seek out material to support the development of &quot;Lament&quot; after the album received financial backing in August 2013. The band opened their 2014 European tour in support of &quot;Lament&quot; with a performance in Diksmuide, Belgium.

==Instruments==
Bargeld&#x27;s guitars of choice are a Fender Jaguar and a Fender Mustang, as seen on the concert DVD &quot;God Is in The House&quot; and at various media appearances. Initially he used a battered Höfner Model 173 and a red Höfner Colorama II until they &quot;broke down&quot;. After his effect pedals were stolen in the early 1980s, he relied exclusively on the Fender floating/dynamic tremolo (like the Höfner units), which both raise and lower pitch, along with Fender Twin amplifiers, metal slides and changing his amp settings for each individual song to create a unique guitar sound.

==Personal life==
Bargeld is married to Chinese-American mathematician Erin Bargeld, daughter of the entrepreneur Min Zhu. Together they developed the concept of web-based fan subscriptions as a new business model for musicians. The couple are featured among 37 other design and media figures in the 2010 book &quot;Designing Media&quot; by designer and IDEO co-founder Bill Moggridge. The couple reside in San Francisco, Beijing and Berlin. They have a transgender son.

Bargeld was a vegetarian for 30 years, but stopped as a result of difficulties that he encountered while practicing vegetarianism in China.

<text>Flateyjarbók (; &quot;Book of Flatey&quot;) is an important medieval Icelandic manuscript. It is also known as GkS 1005 fol. and by the Latin name Codex Flateyensis. It was commissioned by Jón Hákonarson and produced by the priests and scribes Jón Þórðarson and Magnús Þórhallsson.

== Description ==
&quot;Flateyjarbók&quot; is the largest medieval Icelandic manuscript, comprising 225 written and illustrated vellum leaves. It contains mostly sagas of the Norse kings as found in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, specifically the sagas about Olaf Tryggvason, St. Olaf, Sverre, Hákon the Old, Magnus the Good, and Harald Hardrada. But they appear here expanded with additional material not found elsewhere (some of it being very old) along with other unique differences. Most—but not all—of the additional material is placed within the royal sagas, sometimes interlaced. Additionally, the manuscript contains the only copy of the eddic poem &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;, a unique set of annals from creation to 1394, and many short tales not otherwise preserved such as &quot;Nornagests þáttr&quot; (&quot;the Story of Norna Gest&quot;).

Especially important is the &quot;Grœnlendinga saga&quot; (&quot;History of the Greenlanders&quot;), giving an account of the Vinland colony with some differences from the account contained in &quot;Eiríks saga rauða&quot; (&quot;History of Eirík the Red&quot;). Here also are preserved the only Icelandic versions of the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; (&quot;History of the Orkney Islanders&quot;) and &quot;Færeyinga saga&quot; (&quot;History of the Faroe Islanders&quot;).

== History ==
From internal evidence the book was being written in 1387 and was completed in 1394 or very soon after. The first page states that its owner is &quot;Jonn Hakonar son&quot; and that the book was scribed by two priests. One of them, &quot;Jon prestr Þórðar son&quot;, scribed the contents from the tale of &quot;Eirík the Traveller&quot; down to the end of the two Olaf sagas and the other, &quot;Magnús prestr Thorhallz sun&quot;, scribed the earlier and later material and also drew the illustrations.

Further material was inserted towards the end of the 15th century.

The manuscript first received special attention by the learned in 1651 when Bishop Brynjólfur Sveinsson of Skálholt, with the permission of King Frederick III of Denmark, requested all folk of Iceland who owned old manuscripts to turn them over to the Danish king, providing either the original or a copy, either as a gift or for a price. Jon Finnsson, who resided on Flatey (&#x27;Flat Island&#x27;) in the fjord of Breiðafjörður on the northwest coast of Iceland, was then the owner of the book which was already known as the &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot;. At first Jon refused to release his precious heirloom, the biggest and best book in all of Iceland, and he continued to refuse even when Bishop Brynjólfur paid him a personal visit and offered him five hundreds of land. Jon only changed his mind and bestowed the book on the bishop just as the bishop was leaving the region.

The manuscript was given as a present from Bishop Brynjólfur to King Frederick III in 1656, and placed in the Royal Library of Copenhagen. In 1662, the bishop presented the king with a second medieval manuscript, the &quot;Codex Regius&quot; (&quot;Konungsbók eddukvæða&quot;). It and &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot; survived the Copenhagen Fire of 1728 and the Second Battle of Copenhagen in 1807 and were eventually repatriated to Iceland in 1971 as Icelandic national treasures. They are preserved and studied by the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies.

<doc id="655350" wikidata="Q267195" url="?curid=655350" title="Cynisca">
<text>Cynisca (; or Kyniska, ; born ) was a wealthy Spartan princess. She is famous for being the first woman to win at the Olympic Games. Cynisca first entered the Olympics in 396 BC, where she won first prize competing with a team of horses she had trained herself. In 392 BC, Cynisca entered her horses in the Olympics for a second time and was awarded another victory in the same event.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Cynisca&quot; means &#x27;female puppy&#x27; or &#x27;little hound&#x27; in Ancient Greek. She was named after her grandfather Zeuxidamus, who was also called &quot;Cyniscos&quot;. Sarah B. Pomeroy suggest that this unusual name could have been a nickname for a tomboyish woman and it alludes to an interest in hunting. It is possible that the name is derived from the hunting traditions of the Spartan elite. Per Cartledge, it could have been a tribute to a species of a Spartan hound that was renowned as scenter during hunting. Pomeroy notes that the names of her close female relatives point to equestrian interests in their lineage.

==Early life==

Cynisca was born in the ancient Greek city-state of Sparta probably born around 440 BC. A member of the Eurypontid dynasty, she was the daughter of King Archidamus II and his wife Eupolia. She was probably half-sister to Agis II ( BC) and full sister to Agesilaus II ( BC), both of whom succeeded their father as a kings of Sparta. She had a sister named Proauga. In her childhood, Cynisca may have earned some experience in sporting from Sparta&#x27;s female physical education carriculum (equivalent to boys&#x27; &quot;agoge&quot;), which she presumably attended. Coming from a wealthy family, she could own racehorses. According to Pausanias, Cynisca was the first woman to breed horses and was exceedingly ambitious to succeed at the Olympic Games.

Several sources from Xenophon and Plutarch mention how Agesilaus encouraged her to breed horses and compete in the games during her youth. However, his motivations for doing so have recently been debated. According to these ancient sources, Agesilaus supposedly viewed success in chariot racing as a victory without merit. Unlike other events, where a man&#x27;s bravery and virtue were the decisive factors, he believed that chariot racing merely demonstrated wealth, as it required no direct involvement from the horses&#x27; owner. Both of these ancient authors suggested that Agesilaus hoped to expose how the sport was unmanly and aristocratic by having a woman win. Though in reality, Cynisca&#x27;s victories did not stop wealthy Spartans from engaging in the sport. Several modern scholars, on the other hand, have theorized that Agesilaus&#x27; motivations were more practical. They suspect that he was using her victories and wealth to promote his own political career and gain public support through association, rather than providing a moral lesson. The evidence provided to support this theory is that Cynisca&#x27;s two Olympic victories would have also brought fame to Agesilaus and to the wider Eurypontid house. Additionally, the establishment of Cynisca&#x27;s hero-cult after her death could suggest that Agesilaus was still making use of his sister&#x27;s fame even after her death. 

==Olympic Games==

In 396 BC, Cynisca employed charioteers to drive the horses she trained and entered her team at the Olympics for the first time, where it won in the four-horse chariot race (tethrippon Greek: τέθριππον). Cynisca is thought to have been approximately 40 years old when she won her first Olympic victory. In 392 BC, Cynisca again entered her racing team at the Olympic games and secured another victory.

To commemorate her Olympic achievements, Cynisca dedicated a set of bronze statues which depicted herself, her charioteer, her chariot, and her horses at the Temple of Zeus in Olympia. According to Pausanias, these statues were placed in a prominent location in the entrance way of the temple, next to the throne dedicated by Arimnestus, a king of Etruria. Along with the statues, Cynisca also celebrated her victories with an inscription, declaring that she was the only woman to win the wreath in the chariot events at the Olympic Games. Cynisca also dedicated another monument with copy of the same inscription in Sparta. The inscription from Olympia (c. 390-380 BC) reads:
:English
:Kings of Sparta are my father and brothers
:I, Kyniska, victorious with a chariot of swift-footed horses,
:have erected this statue. I declare myself the only woman
:in all Hellas to have won this crown.
:Apelleas son of Kallikles made it.

:Ancient Greek

Pausanias also mentions an epigram to Cynisca of unknown authorship, which he claims was the only poetic composition ever written to commemorate the deeds of the royal houses of the Lacedaemonians. In addition to this, a heroön (hero-shrine) was erected for Cynisca in Sparta at Plane-tree Grove, where religious ceremonies were held. Previously, only Spartan kings had been graced in this way; Cynisca was the first woman to receive this honor.

== Cultural context ==

While most women in the ancient Greek world were kept in seclusion and forbidden to pursue athletic activities such as riding or hunting, Spartan women of the elite spartiate class were trained to excel in sports. The greater freedom that spartiate women experienced in terms of athletic pursuits was largely due to the fact that they were able to dedicate significant amounts of time to their training, since the helot system, whereby the majority of the population was kept in slavery, relieved them of the typical household duties that most other Greek women were expected to attend to. High levels of female athleticism were encouraged in Sparta because as a society, they believed that strong women would produce strong children and supply the army with powerful soldiers.

Despite the greater level of social freedom that spartiate women enjoyed, participation in Olympic Games remained almost entirely restricted to men. There is debate about whether women were even allowed to attend the games as spectators. Several passages from Pausanias shed light on this issue, as he suggests that &quot;parthenai&quot; (young, unmarried women) were allowed to attend the Olympics as spectators, but &quot;gynaikes&quot; (married women) were barred from entering. In terms of competing in the Olympic games, women were only allowed to enter the equestrian events, not by participating themselves, but rather by owning and training the horses.

However, while it was rare for women to compete against men in athletic games, as Cynisca did, there is evidence to suggest that separate athletic competitions existed for women in the Greek world. The existence of these competitions is supported by Pausanias&#x27; mention of a number of bronze statues dedicated by victorious female runners (mostly Spartan) at the temple of Hera at Elis, as well as several stone inscriptions that have been uncovered.

==Cynisca&#x27;s cultural impact==

Based on archaeological evidence such as the locations of her dedications and hero-cult, as well as the speculation of modern scholars, Cynisca&#x27;s win at the Olympics likely had a great impact on women across the Greek world, not only her fellow Lacedaemonians. After Cynisca&#x27;s victory, several other Greek women went on to achieve varying levels of success in the sport of chariot racing, including Euryleonis, Belistiche, Zeuxo, Encrateia and Hermione, Timareta, Theodota, and Cassia. However, according to Pausanias, none of these women gained greater recognition for their victories than Cynisca. When Berenike of Egypt won in the four-horse chariot race at the Olympics in the early third century BC, she commissioned an epigram by the poet Posidippus in which she explicitly claimed to have &quot;stolen&quot; the fame (κῦδος) of Cynisca. Her epigram was included in the so-called Greek Anthology, which also indicates its continuing relevance long after the victory itself. Some scholars have suggested that Cynisca&#x27;s Olympic victories and heroic qualities were likely also honored by men, based on the fact that her heroön was placed in a prominent location near the Platanistas, the exercise grounds for Spartan youths.

In modern times, Cynisca has been commemorated by the Greek poet Zoe Karelli, who wrote a poem about her love for horses and the Olympic victory which made her name famous in Greek history. Cynisca is included in Judy Chicago&#x27;s 1979 feminist art exhibit commemorating historically famous women throughout civilization, &quot;The Dinner Party.&quot; In sports of the modern era, Cynisca continues to be recognized. Cynisca Cycling is a U.S. registered women&#x27;s professional cycling team named after the Spartan princess. Kyniska Advocacy is a UK organization fostering a safe environment for women in sports. Kyniska Hoops is an AAU girls&#x27; basketball club, also playing in the girls&#x27; U.S. Junior National basketball tournament.

<doc id="655358" wikidata="Q1777301" url="?curid=655358" title="Standard time">
<text>Standard time is the synchronization of clocks within a geographical region to a single time standard, rather than a local mean time standard. Generally, standard time agrees with the local mean time at some meridian that passes through the region, often near the centre of the region. Historically, standard time was established during the 19th century to aid weather forecasting and train travel. Applied globally in the 20th century, the geographical regions became time zones. The standard time in each time zone has come to be defined as an offset from Universal Time. A further offset is applied for part of the year in regions with daylight saving time.

The adoption of standard time, because of the inseparable correspondence between longitude and time, solidified the concept of halving the globe into the Eastern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere, with one Prime Meridian replacing the various prime meridians that had previously been used.

==History of standard time==
During the 19th century, scheduled steamships and trains required time standardisation in the industrialized world.

===Great Britain===
A standardised time system was first used by British railways on 1 December 1847, when they switched from local mean time, which varied from place to place, to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). It was also given the name railway time, reflecting the important role the railway companies played in bringing it about. The vast majority of Great Britain&#x27;s public clocks were standardised to GMT by 1855.

===North America===
Until 1883, each United States railroad chose its own time standards. The Pennsylvania Railroad used the &quot;Allegheny Time&quot; system, an astronomical timekeeping service which had been developed by Samuel Pierpont Langley at the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Allegheny Observatory (then known as the Western University of Pennsylvania, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). Instituted in 1869, the Allegheny Observatory&#x27;s service is believed to have been the first regular and systematic system of time distribution to railroads and cities as well as the origin of the modern standard time system. By 1870 the Allegheny Time service extended over 2,500 miles with 300 telegraph offices receiving time signals.

However, almost all railroads out of New York ran on New York time, and railroads west from Chicago mostly used Chicago time, but between Chicago and Pittsburgh/Buffalo the norm was Columbus time, even on railroads such as the PFtW&amp;C and LS&amp;MS, which did not run through Columbus. The Santa Fe Railroad used Jefferson City (Missouri) time all the way to its west end at Deming, New Mexico, as did the east–west lines across Texas; Central Pacific and Southern Pacific Railroads used San Francisco time all the way to El Paso. The Northern Pacific Railroad had seven time zones between St. Paul and the 1883 west end of the railroad at Wallula Jct; the Union Pacific Railway was at the other extreme, with only two time zones between Omaha and Ogden.

In 1870, Charles F. Dowd proposed four time zones based on the meridian through Washington, DC, for North American railroads. In 1872 he revised his proposal to base it on the Greenwich meridian. Sandford Fleming, a Scottish-born Canadian engineer, proposed worldwide Standard Time at a meeting of the Royal Canadian Institute on February 8, 1879. Cleveland Abbe advocated standard time to better coordinate international weather observations and resultant weather forecasts, which had been coordinated using local solar time. In 1879 he recommended four time zones across the contiguous United States, based upon Greenwich Mean Time. The General Time Convention (renamed the American Railway Association in 1891), an organization of US railroads charged with coordinating schedules and operating standards, became increasingly concerned that if the US government adopted a standard time scheme it would be disadvantageous to its member railroads. William F. Allen, the Convention secretary, argued that North American railroads should adopt a five-zone standard, similar to the one in use today, to avoid government action. On October 11, 1883, the heads of the major railroads met in Chicago at the Grand Pacific Hotel and agreed to adopt Allen&#x27;s proposed system.

The members agreed that on Sunday, November 18, 1883, all United States and Canadian railroads would readjust their clocks and watches to reflect the new five-zone system on a telegraph signal from the Allegheny Observatory in Pittsburgh at exactly noon on the 90th meridian. Although most railroads adopted the new system as scheduled, some did so early on October 7 and others late on December 2. The Intercolonial Railway serving the Canadian maritime provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia just east of Maine decided not to adopt Intercolonial Time based on the 60th meridian west of Greenwich, instead adopting Eastern Time, so only four time zones were actually adopted by American and Canadian railroads in 1883. Major American observatories, including the Allegheny Observatory, the United States Naval Observatory, the Harvard College Observatory, and the Yale University Observatory, agreed to provide telegraphic time signals at noon Eastern Time.

Standard time was not enacted into US law until the 1918 Standard Time Act established standard time in time zones; the law also instituted daylight saving time (DST). The daylight saving time portion of the law was repealed in 1919 over a presidential veto, but was re-established nationally during World War II. In 2007 the US enacted a federal law formalising the use of Coordinated Universal Time as the basis of standard time, and the role of the Secretary of Commerce (effectively, the National Institute of Standards and Technology) and the Secretary of the Navy (effectively, the US Naval Observatory) in interpreting standard time.

In 1999, standard time was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame in the category &quot;National: Technical Innovations.&quot;

The Dominion of Newfoundland, whose capital St. John&#x27;s falls almost exactly midway between the meridians anchoring the Atlantic Time Zone and the Greenland Time Zone, voted in 1935 to create a half-hour offset time zone known as the Newfoundland Time Zone, at three and a half hours behind Greenwich time.

=== The Netherlands ===

In the Netherlands, introduction of the railways made it desirable to create a standard time. On 1 May 1909, Amsterdam Time or Dutch Time was introduced. Before that, time was measured in different cities; in the east of the country, this was a few minutes earlier than in the west. After that, all parts of the country had the same local time—that of the Wester Tower in Amsterdam (Westertoren/4°53&#x27;01.95&quot; E). This time was indicated as GMT +0h 19m 32.13s until 17 March 1937, after which it was simplified to GMT+0h20m. This time zone was also known as the &quot;Loenen time&quot; or &quot;Gorinchem time&quot;, as this was the exact time in both Loenen and Gorinchem. At noon in Amsterdam, it was 11:40 in London and 12:40 in Berlin.

The shift to the current Central European Time zone took place on 16 May 1940. The German occupiers ordered the clock to be moved an hour and forty minutes forward. This time was kept in summer and winter throughout 1941 and 1942. It was only in November 1942 that a different Winter time was introduced, and the time was adjusted one hour backwards. This lasted for only three years; after the liberation of the Netherlands in 1945, Summer time was abolished for over thirty years, so during those years, standard time was 40 minutes ahead of the original Amsterdam Time. As of 2017, the Netherlands is in line with Central European Time (GMT+1 in the winter, GMT+2 in the summer, which is significantly different from Amsterdam Time).

=== New Zealand ===
In 1868, New Zealand was the first country in the world to establish a nationwide standard time.

A telegraph cable between New Zealand&#x27;s two main islands became the instigating factor for the establishment of &quot;New Zealand time&quot;. In 1868, the Telegraph Department adopted &quot;Wellington time&quot; as the standard time across all their offices so that opening and closing times could be synchronised. The Post Office, which usually shared the same building, followed suit. However, protests that time was being dictated by one government department, led to a resolution in parliament to establish a standard time for the whole country.

The director of the Geological Survey, James Hector, selected New Zealand time to be at the meridian 172°30′E. This was very close to the country&#x27;s mean longitude and exactly 11.5 hours in advance of Greenwich Mean Time. It came into effect on 2 November 1868.

For over fifty years, the Colonial Time Service Observatory in Wellington, determined the correct time each morning. At 9 a.m. each day, it was transmitted by Morse code to post offices and railway stations around the country. In 1920, radio time signals began broadcasting, greatly increasing the accuracy of the time nationwide.

<doc id="655364" wikidata="Q1140524" url="?curid=655364" title="Rei Ayanami">
<text>is a fictional character from the &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; franchise, created by Gainax studio. In the anime series of the same name, Rei is an introverted girl chosen as the enigmatic pilot of a giant mecha named Evangelion Unit 00. At the beginning of the series, Rei is an enigmatic figure whose unusual behavior astonishes her peers. As the series progresses, she becomes more involved with the people around her, particularly her classmate and fellow Eva pilot, Shinji Ikari. Rei appears in the franchise&#x27;s animated feature films and related media, video games, the original net animation &quot;Petit Eva: Evangelion@School&quot;, the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; films, and the manga adaptation by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto.

Hideaki Anno, director of the animated series, conceived her as a representation of his unconscious. He was also influenced by his readings on psychology, in particular on Freudian psychoanalysis, taking inspiration from Freud&#x27;s theories on the Oedipus complex. Other influences for its creation include earlier works by Gainax staff members, such as &quot;Aoki Uru&quot;, and Paul Gallico&#x27;s &quot;The Snow Goose&quot;. Rei is voiced by Megumi Hayashibara in Japanese, and by Amanda Winn-Lee, Brina Palencia and Ryan Bartley in English.

Rei has been well received by critics and in reviews. She has maintained a high ranking in every popularity poll of the series and has also appeared in polls to decide the most popular anime characters in Japan. Reviewers have praised Rei&#x27;s mysterious aura and her role in the story. Merchandising based on her has also been released, particularly action figures, which became popular. Critics linked her success to a series of &quot;moe&quot; traits that proved popular with anime fans, influencing the creation of subsequent female anime characters.

== Conception ==
=== Design ===
According to the &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: The Unofficial Guide&quot; by writers Kazuhisa Fujie and Martin Foster, director Hideaki Anno instructed Yoshiyuki Sadamoto on Rei&#x27;s character design saying, &quot;Whatever else, she needs to be painted in as a bitterly unhappy young girl with little sense of presence.&quot; The band Kinniku Shōjo Tai&#x27;s theme song &quot;Doko e demo ikeru kitte&quot; and its line inspired Sadamoto to draw Rei. The same band produced a song named , in which a female monologue is audible, and Sadamoto tried to portray a girl with a similar voice. Ukina, a character from Sadamoto&#x27;s previous work &quot;Koto&quot;, served as Rei&#x27;s model, and the artist gave her &quot;shaggy, bobbed, wolf-like hair&quot;. Another source of inspiration was &quot;The Snow Goose&quot;, a novella written by Paul Gallico; the story describes a painting portraying the protagonist, a thin and pale girl in an empty room, and the artist tried to create a character similar to her.

Anno required a &quot;gloomy&quot;, &quot;cool character with short hair&quot;, so Sadamoto designed Rei originally as a brunette with dark eyes; however, it was necessary to distinguish her from the other female protagonist Asuka Langley Soryu, so he designed her with eye and hair colors opposite to Asuka&#x27;s. He also published a drawing of a dark-haired character named Yui Ichijō among Rei&#x27;s designs in one of his artbooks, without specifying whether it is an early conception of Yui Ikari or not. While Asuka was conceived as &quot;an idol-like figure&quot; in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; and a symbol of &quot;heterosexual desire&quot;, Sadamoto designed Rei as a motherhood symbol, thinking of her as &quot;the Yin opposed to Asuka&quot;. Anno also suggested that Rei&#x27;s eye color be red, a feature he believed would give her more personality and distinguish her design from those of the other characters. Her hair color changed to blue, similarly to the main character from &quot;Aoki Uru&quot;, the movie sequel to &quot;The Wings of Honneamise&quot; (1987) which was never made. Sadamoto also gave her black stockings, inspired by a women&#x27;s handball team he saw playing when he was in middle school. Black allowed him to differentiate her from the characters of the series released in the same period and go against their trend.

=== Development ===
Like other &quot;Evangelion&quot; characters, Ayanami&#x27;s surname comes from a Japanese World War II naval vessel, the . Her first name comes from the character Rei Hino of the anime and manga series &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;. This was done to get one of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;″s directors, Kunihiko Ikuhara, to work on &quot;Evangelion&quot;. Written in kanji, can mean &quot;zero&quot;, &quot;null&quot;. The character also means &quot;custom&quot;, &quot;routine&quot;. According to writer Patrick Drazen, her name can be a pun on her Evangelion 00, while for critic Hiroki Azuma it may have been influenced by a character named Zero, the protagonist of the 1987 novel &quot;Ai to Gensō no Fascism&quot;, written by Ryū Murakami. Anno also took inspiration from Sigmund Freud&#x27;s psychoanalytic concept of Oedipus complex for her role. He conceived the Evangelion and Rei as palliative mother figures for Shinji; Rei was also conceived as emotionally close to Shinji&#x27;s father, Gendo, creating a multi-layered Oedipus complex. In a discarded draft of the character background, she was thus a more sensual character than her final version; character designer Sadamoto, however, unlike the more frank and explicit Hideaki Anno, decided to give her a much more &quot;enigmatic&quot; and bland eros.

During &quot;Evangelion&quot;″s production and first broadcast, Anno encountered difficulties writing the character, not feeling &quot;particularly interested&quot; or relating to her, but he thought of her as a representation of his unconscious mind, conceiving Rei as &quot;the unconscious Shinji&quot;. In the fifth episode, &quot;Rei I&quot;, explicitly dedicated to her character, Rei speaks seven lines and fifty-two words, while in the sixth she has twenty-five lines. Not feeling particularly close to her, the director for a long time forgot to explore Rei&#x27;s personality, ignoring it or giving it marginal space. In the eighth episode, &quot;Asuka Strikes!&quot;, for example, she does not appear in any scene, while in the seventh installment, &quot;A Human Work&quot;, he remembered her and he added a scene with Rei. As with other &quot;Evangelion&quot; characters, he transposed aspects of his life into her character, including the choice to not eat meat and maintain a vegetarian diet. At the beginning of the production he also stated that he did not know what would happen to Rei or to the other characters, &quot;because I don&#x27;t know where life is taking the staff&quot;.

Her history has eventually undergone changes. According to Sadamoto and assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki, she was originally conceived as an alien entity, but staff later went on to make her at least genetically human. During an interview, they described Rei as a girl who has both the human genes of Yui Ikari and ; Tsurumaki also associated her condition to a Devilman, a hybrid presented in the manga &quot;Devilman&quot; by Go Nagai. Moreover, in the twenty-first episode, the first Rei clone, killed by Naoko Akagi in the final version of the script, would eventually survive after being strangled and having lost consciousness momentarily, awakening in an empty command room without Dr. Akagi, while the death of her second clone was planned by Anno since the beginning. During the production of the fourteenth episode, the director decided to focus on her and &quot;explore her emotion&quot;, adding a monologue of Rei. When he was working on the monologue, he wanted to develop her in a &quot;schizophrenic&quot; direction and wondered how to portray a kind of madness. He was loaned a magazine-like book entitled on mental illness that contained a poem by someone who suffered from a mental disorder, and that triggered his imagination. Moreover, during the production, Ikuhara, annoyed by the idealized image and the fetishism that some fans built around the character, proposed to Anno to &quot;betray&quot; fans and show her as a real girl who gets married and &quot;gets pregnant in the last episode&quot;, but Anno rejected the suggestion. Furthermore, in the original finale wanted by Anno, the giant Rei added in the film &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; (1997) was not foreseen, since it was conceived at a later time. Anno himself declared he considered her character &quot;already finished&quot; in her smile scene from the sixth episode, since &quot;she and Shinji completely &#x27;communicated&#x27; there&quot;.

=== Voice ===
Megumi Hayashibara voiced Rei in all her appearances in the original series, as well as the later films, spin-offs, video games and the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; saga. In 1995, Hayashibara said she was somewhat &quot;surprised&quot; by her role and her laconic character saying, &quot;I have to challenge something new.&quot; Hayashibara also attended auditions for Asuka and Misato Katsuragi, but after hearing her performance in an OVA named Anno felt her voice more suited to Rei. She noticed that before &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; there were few taciturn and cold characters to deal with, so, in the absence of examples to imitate, she tried to characterize her &quot;as best I could&quot;. During the dub sessions, Hideaki Anno instructed and guided her, advising her to read her lines in the flattest tone possible: &quot;When the director explained her character to me, he said, &#x27;It&#x27;s not that Rei doesn&#x27;t have any feelings, it&#x27;s just that she doesn&#x27;t understand&#x27;.&quot; According to Hayashibara, since Rei &quot;doesn&#x27;t know emotion, there&#x27;s no difference between what she says and feels&quot;. At first glance, her &quot;great beauty&quot; comes from &quot;this surface, not without depth, but with the absence of its necessity&quot;. She added, &quot;Rei&#x27;s beauty comes from the truth that she has feelings&quot;, and &quot;when I found the warmth below the coldness in her words, I synchronized with Rei for the first time&quot;.

Voicing the mahjong game , she stated that she understood the difference between &quot;lack of intonation&quot; and &quot;absence of emotion&quot; in words. She linked the lack of intonation as a sign of &quot;self-confidence&quot;; an insecure or bad-faith person, in her opinion, would tend to emphasize words, while Rei is completely honest and only tells the truth. The voice actress also reprised the role for the &quot;Rebuild&quot;. While filming for the third film in the saga, &quot;&quot; (2012), she worked on parts that were not fully animated, so she had to ask the director what was happening in the scenes. Hayashibara stated she had to do &quot;countless takes&quot; for Rei&#x27;s short lines and find the right nuance the staff wanted. She had to dub her as she was indifferent and be careful in conveying her character&#x27;s feelings of happiness &quot;without overdoing it&quot;.

Regarding the final installment, &quot;&quot; (2021), a difficult part for her was showing another Rei clone who is slowly growing up; when she tried to be pure she was criticized, and when she tried to be less emotional she was criticized anyway. Anno tried to make the characters younger and with fuller emotions, so it was difficult for the voice actress to get the nuances the director wanted. With Rei&#x27;s role, Hayashibara&#x27;s popularity as a voice actor grew, and she became an icon of anime fandom. Shunsuke Nozawa, assistant professor at Hokkaido University, noted how in the 1990s there was an explosion of interest in Japanese voice actors, believing the figure of Hayashibara to be at the center of this change, thanks to the &quot;enormous, societal-level fascination&quot; exerted by Ayanami. Hayashibara thus began to be interviewed about the series and to be regularly invited on television as a celebrity.

Amanda Winn-Lee voices Rei in English in the original series and in the Amazon dubs of the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; films. According to Winn-Lee, despite the cold and detached appearance, there is still &quot;a small spark of humanity&quot; in Rei, &quot;clouded by this huge sense of negative self-worth and the realization that she is expendable&quot;. She also stated: &quot;She knows she&#x27;s expendable, but the thing is, she&#x27;s still human.&quot; In the Funimation dub of the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; films, her role is entrusted to Brina Palencia, while in the Netflix dub she is voiced by Ryan Bartley.

== Appearances ==
=== &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; ===
Rei Ayanami&#x27;s birth date is never specified in the original series. All data about Rei&#x27;s past are unknown or erased; her age, 14 in 2015, is the only known fact. Officially, Rei is chosen by an organization called the Marduk Institute as the First Child and pilot of Eva Unit-00 to defeat creatures named Angels for the special agency Nerv under the command of Gendo Ikari. In 2014 she moves to the first municipal middle school of the new city of Tokyo-3, and Gendo becomes her legal guardian. Through the course of the series, Rei, who is originally completely submissive to the will of Gendo, becomes friends with fellow Eva pilot and classmate Shinji Ikari, changing attitude. She also begins to become more aware of her own identity and desires.

In the battle with the Angel Armisael, Rei decides to sacrifice herself alongside Eva Unit-00 to save Shinji and destroy the enemy. After her apparent death, Dr. Ritsuko Akagi reveals she was born in Laboratory for Artificial Evolution&#x27;s third branch, a place located under lake Ashino and Hakone city. Her body with albino-like traits was created in absolute secrecy from the salvaged remains of Yui Ikari, a brilliant researcher who lost her life in a testing experiment by Evangelion Unit 01. Ritsuko also reveals that in the deepest level of Nerv&#x27;s headquarters many Rei clones are kept, so that when one Rei dies, she can be replaced. When a clone is activated from a level named Terminal Dogma, although she remains characteristically distinct from all former incarnations, she is endowed with the soul of Lilith, the second Angel. Her memory is eventually saved in an object similar to a spinal column placed in the Central Dogma of the Nerv, the Dummy Plug Plant. In 2010, Gendo brought her first clone (Rei I) to the Gehirn base, the predecessor of Nerv and responsible for the development and construction of the first Evangelion units, introducing her as the daughter an acquaintance had entrusted to him. This first Rei was killed by Dr. Naoko Akagi, colleague and secret lover of Gendō. During her visit to Gehirn, Rei I got lost in the laboratory control room and met Naoko, calling her an &quot;old hag&quot;, as if to provoke her. She then revealed that it was Gendo who called Naoko that. Naoko suddenly recognized Yui&#x27;s facial features in the little girl&#x27;s face and, in an outburst of violence, she strangled and killed her, after which she committed suicide.

After her sacrifice, Rei II is replaced by a third and final clone. All the other bodies in Terminal Dogma are later destroyed by Ritsuko. Thanks to her close relationship with Shinji, the last Rei decides to rebel against Gendo&#x27;s will. Rei III thus acts as the main catalyst behind an apocalyptic event named Third Impact. She merges with Lilith, letting Shinji freely decide the course of a process named Human Instrumentality, during which all of mankind unites into one collective consciousness. A giant white and naked Rei emerges into open space during the process, holding Shinji&#x27;s Eva-01, and, when Shinji rejects Instrumentality, this figure decomposes. After Shinji rematerializes, he briefly sees a version of Rei watching over him from a distance before vanishing.

=== &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; ===
Rei returns as a primary character in &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; and appears in the first installment of the saga, &quot;&quot; (2007). Her character remains virtually identical to the anime, acting as a pilot of Evangelion Unit-00 and helping Shinji defeat Angel Ramiel. Writer Thomas Lamarre noted that the &quot;Rebuild&quot; saga makes the relationship between Shinji and Rei a more central element to the story, increasing and improving the scenes depicting them. In the second movie, &quot;&quot; (2009), her character develops and her relationship with Shinji is shown much more openly than in the original series. In a departure from her original traits, she attempts to host a dinner party for her fellow pilots. Anno first thought to use this idea for the fourth episode of the original anime, but the proposal was shelved during the production of the series. During the climax, Angel Zeruel devours Rei and Unit-00. When Unit-01 goes out of control, Shinji forces his way into the Angel pulling her out, and the two embrace each other; at the end of the fight, they are both trapped within Unit-01 as the action triggers the Third Impact. During the feature film, it is also suggested that Gendō and Fuyutsuki plan to bring Shinji and Rei together. Assistant director Tsurumaki was asked about this after the release of the feature film; according to him, the impression of a strategy to bring Shinji and Rei together was a result of the complex script writing, and &quot;Anno probably hasn&#x27;t thought about that very deeply&quot;.

In the third installment, &quot;&quot; (2012), set fourteen years later, the same Rei does not appear; a different clone is introduced instead, who acts differently than the other Rei, maintaining a cold and silent demeanor. In &quot;&quot; (2021), the last film of the saga, Rei&#x27;s new clone, named Ayanami (Tentative Name), heads together with Shinji and Asuka Shikinami to a small town called Village 3, inhabited by survivors of the various Impacts that occurred and isolated from the outside world, almost uninhabitable. Here Rei interacts with the adult Toji Suzuhara and Hikari Horaki, old schoolmates of the previous clone, with the children and women of Village 3, helping them to work in the fields; with time the new Ayanami begins to develop her individuality, gradually discovering the world around her and learning to socialize with the inhabitants. After some time, however, Rei (Tentative Name), whose real name turns out to be Ayanami-Type No.006, is unable to maintain her form without continuous contact with the Evangelion&#x27;s LCL liquid and dies in front of Shinji. During the Instrumentality, Shinji meets again the Rei of fourteen years before, who remained inside the Eva-01. The old Rei, with visibly long hair, argues with her companion, who decides to live in a world without Evangelions and give the world a new birth, Neon Genesis. Rei and Shinji then say goodbye to each other for the last time, shaking hands and smiling.

=== In other media ===
In the official &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; manga, by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, further differences are evident in the characterization of Rei. In the manga, she is generally more empathetic and open to human contact compared to her animated counterpart. In the comic, moreover, the character has more space than Asuka, who in the anime has a predominant role. Compared to the classic series, Sadamoto tried to tread his hand on her relationship with Shinji, particularly insisting on the symbology of the touch of the hands and the theme of motherhood, inspired by Kazuo Umezu&#x27;s &quot;The Drifting Classroom&quot;. As in the series, she at first considers herself empty and useless, created solely for piloting the Evangelion under Ikari&#x27;s orders; Shinji&#x27;s touch changes his attitude. In a scene from the fifth volume of the manga where they are both at Rei&#x27;s house, Rei gets burned while preparing tea with Shinji and their hands touch for a moment. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Rei invites Shinji to speak to his father and open up to him; in another chapter, thinking back to that moment, she wonders if her hands will one day be able to touch Shinji again. During the clash with the Angel Armisael, Rei becomes increasingly aware of her feelings of sadness and affection towards Shinji, towards whom she demonstrates a certain romantic interest. Sadamoto himself described Shinji and Rei&#x27;s feelings as mutual love.

In a scene from the last episode of the animated series, an alternate reality is presented with a different story than the previous episodes; Rei is presented as a girl who has just moved into the class of Asuka and Shinji, with a cheerful, distracted and irascible personality. An outgoing Rei is featured in some &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; spin-offs, such as &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days&quot;, set in the alternate reality of the last episode. In the original web anime series &quot;Petit Eva: Evangelion@School&quot;, a parody of the original animated series, three Ayanami sisters are presented, one is diligent and introverted; another sport oriented and extroverted; and another is a four-year-old girl with a passion for soft toys. In &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Anima&quot;, set three years after &quot;End of Evangelion&quot; in an alternate scenario, several Rei appears; Rei Troi, pilot of an Eva named Evangelion Unit-02 Type II Allegorica, Rei Quatre, Rei Cinq and the seven-year-old version Rei Six, all of them pilots of Evangelion-0.0 units. In &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse&quot;, Rei shares a mysterious connection with Kaworu that triggers Shinji&#x27;s attention. She is also present in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Legend of the Piko Piko Middle School Students&quot;. In a simulation game entitled &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Ayanami Raising Project&quot;, the player takes on the task of looking after Rei. She is also available as a romantic option in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Girlfriend of Steel 2nd&quot;, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion 2&quot;, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shinji Ikari Raising Project&quot; and its manga adaptation, wherein she is a distant cousin of Shinji.

In addition to games based on the original series, Rei has appeared in media not related to the &quot;Evangelion&quot; franchise, such as &quot;Monster Strike&quot;, &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot;, &quot;Tales of Zestiria&quot;, &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot;, &quot;Keri hime sweets&quot;, &quot;Summons Board&quot;, &quot;Puyopuyo!! Quest&quot;, &quot;Line Rangers&quot;, &quot;Unison&quot;, &quot;MapleStory&quot;, &quot;Valkyrie Connect&quot;, &quot;Ragnarok Online&quot;, &quot;The Battle Cats&quot; and in an official &quot;Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion&quot; crossover episode.

== Characterization and themes ==
Rei Ayanami is a taciturn girl who limits relations as much as possible and mechanically executes any order given to her, even if particularly cruel. She is introverted, socially detached and laconic. Sociologist Satomi Ishikawa noticed that in a scene from the sixth episode of the series, &quot;Rei II&quot;, her companion Shinji asks her the reason that pushes her to want to pilot Evangelion 00; Rei replies saying she finds her only &quot;bond&quot; with other people in this, thus demonstrating that she is committed to the struggle against the Angels &quot;as if it were the only reason why she exists&quot;. Throughout the series she proves to be indifferent to life and engages herself in drastic acts that could cost her life. &quot;The Artifice&quot;&#x27;s writer Justin Wu noticed that, unlike other characters from the series, she does not care if she dies, and embraces death &quot;as if death is the only way to prove that she has lived&quot;.

For the critic Gerald Alva Miller, despite her cold attitude, Rei experiences feelings of alienation and existential angst. Gualtiero Cannarsi, who cured the Italian adaptation for the series, similarly described Rei as a girl &quot;unaware of the most basic rules of life and hygiene&quot;, as she has had no one to teach them to her, resulting in her being disinterested in them. Her attitude is reflected in her apartment, where hygiene is neglected. In one episode Ritsuko Akagi says, like Commander Ikari, she &quot;is not very adept at living&quot;. Scattered on the floor of her apartment are scientific texts on biological interactions and genetics written in Latin alphabet in the original series, and &quot;The Happy Prince and Other Tales&quot; in the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; series. Critic Susan J. Napier also noticed that in the last two episodes she confesses to wanting to die and &quot;go back to nothing&quot;. According to &quot;Evangelion&quot; character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, she is &quot;translucent&quot;, like a shadow or &quot;the air&quot;: &quot;The kind of girl you can&#x27;t touch. The girl you long for, but there is nothing about her that you can grab a hold onto.&quot; He also interpreted Asuka and Rei as &quot;strong characters, in their own separate ways&quot;. Furthermore, Hayashibara described her as an &quot;ethereal character&quot;; according to her: &quot;Her emotions are like waves, so if I was off by even one millimeter it would affect her character, and I&#x27;d have to redo it&quot;.

During a show a little girl asked Hideaki Anno what Rei likes, and he replied that he never thought about it. According to him, she does not appreciate her own life, hurts herself and feels she does not need friends, being aware of the fact that &quot;there&#x27;ll be another to replace her&quot;: &quot;Her presence, her existence—ostensible existence—is ephemeral. She&#x27;s a very sad girl. She only has the barest minimum of what she needs to have&quot;. Anno also likened the Japanese national attraction to characters like Rei as the product of a stunted imaginative landscape born of Japan&#x27;s defeat in the Second World War, because &quot;since that time, the education we received is not one that creates adults&quot;. The architect Kaichiro Morikawa compared the face of the first Rei, usually presented in a distorted and deformed way, to the installations of Tony Oursler, also comparing her bedroom to Gottfried Helnwein&#x27;s photographs. Writer Claudio Cordella associated her personality to that of the female characters portrayed by the painter Edward Burne-Jones, and her gaze to the &quot;fixed and lifeless eyes&quot; of the Olympia from &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;.

Takekuma Kentaro linked the image of Rei in bandages to the photos of Romain Slocombe, while Sadamoto compared her to the works of mangaka Sensha Yoshida. In an interview with Anno, Japanese writer and academic Ōizumi Mitsunari likened the figure of Rei to the girls committed to the Japanese sect Aum Shinrikyō, which carried out the Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995, as &quot;completely dependent on their guru&quot;, Shōkō Asahara. The book &quot;Schizo Evangelion&quot;, edited by him, describes her as &quot;a sacrifice offered to all the Japanese mama&#x27;s boys and sadists&quot; and in a series of dichotomies, such as opium and euphoria, Satan and God, &quot;the infinite power of Eros&quot; and &quot;the blinding power of Thanatos at the same time&quot;, &quot;a sarin prepared by Gendo Ikari for his plan to destroy humanity&quot;, the &quot;keyhole of Pandora&#x27;s box&quot; and the Great Bad Mother trying to take in her son.

For the scholar Hiroki Azuma, Rei Ayanami introduces a &quot;new type of solitude&quot;. Before her, anime characters were divided between sociable girls, with expensive clothes and cosmetics, technological gadgets and often engaged in prostitution activities named &quot;kogal&quot;, and &quot;otaku&quot;, isolated characters, with rooms full of &quot;computer software&quot; and magazines. Rei, according to Azuma, transcends the two stereotypes; he likened her room to Satyam, scientific laboratories of Aum Shinrikyō. Critic Krystian Woznicki also compared her to Pinocchio in the film &quot;964 Pinocchio&quot; (1991), but &quot;Rei&#x27;s character is quite realistic, whereas Pinocchio is completely removed from reality&quot;. Japanese critic Tamaki Saitō described her as &quot;the culmination of the pygmalionism that began with &quot;Nanako SOS&quot;&quot;, while Kenneth Lee noted a similarity in her path of self-awareness with Pinocchio and Key from &quot;Key the Metal Idol&quot;. Furthermore, writer Tamaki Saito reported that Ami Mizuno from &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot; has been interpreted as &quot;the prototype&quot; of Rei.

Critics linked her silent and inexpressive personality to alexithymia or a schizoid personality disorder. An official &quot;Death and Rebirth&quot; booklet describes her as &quot;an expressionless noh mask&quot; and &quot;a girl who does not dream&quot;, while the book &quot;Schizo Evangelion&quot; as &quot;a dreamless mind, completely separated from Jung&#x27;s collective unconscious&quot;. According to Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Rei is capable of feeling emotions and feelings but has expressive and communicative difficulties. From the first episodes of the series, Shinji tries to connect with her; however, Rei is unable to parse the meaning of his words and actions adequately. Although the two pilots occasionally converse with each other, they cannot communicate on an emotional level and do not understand their feelings. However, facing a crying Shinji, who is glad that she is alive after a big fight in the sixth episode, she smiles, marking one of her most significant moments of character development. After this, both their words and actions move to a place of mutual understanding. For critic Manabu Tsuribe, with her smile in the sixth episode &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; reaches its climax, and &quot;as a story of &#x27;growth and independence of a boy&#x27;—like a Bildungsroman—ended there once. &quot;Evangelion&quot; as a story has stopped there&quot;. In the last episodes of the series this Rei dies and is replaced by another clone, who acts like a stranger to Shinji. Anno compared the story after her smile scene, in which there is a step back in interpersonal communication, to Hideki Gō, a character from the &quot;Return of Ultraman&quot; series; Gō seems to get closer to other people and his colleagues from the Monster Attack Team, but &quot;then next week things begin again from [a position of] estrangement&quot;. He also added: &quot;At that point something emerges of my mistrust or fear of communication with others&quot;.

Academic Frenchy Lunning described Rei as Shinji&#x27;s anima. In one of the first scenes of the &quot;Evangelion&quot; anime, Shinji sees a ghost of Rei Ayanami in a deserted city near Tokyo-3. The Rei visible in the sequence is not the real Rei; the appearance has been connected to the scenario of the film &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, released in 1997 as a conclusion to the classic series. During the film, all forms of life come together in one being during the Instrumentality; human beings, shortly before dying, see Rei&#x27;s ghosts appear, guiding them in the process as &quot;messengers of redemption&quot;. According to Yūichirō Oguro, editor of some of the contents of the Japanese home video editions of &quot;Evangelion&quot;, the Rei&#x27;s ghost Shinji sees on the avenue is &quot;the existence that gazes upon man&quot;, and the scene symbolizes that &quot;Shinji is protected by his mother since the beginning of the series&quot;. For screenwriter Yōji Enokido, she produces in young men a feeling of distance &quot;as though they were still half in the womb&quot;. Patrick Drazen noticed that, like other &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; characters who have traits of some deities of Shinto mythology, Rei has affinities with the goddess of the Sun, Amaterasu, who is reborn at every dawn. He also compared the show&#x27;s two other protagonists, Shinji and Asuka, with Susanoo and Ama-no-Uzume, respectively; Shinji, like Susanoo, has clumsily social manners and unsociable behavior, while Asuka, like Uzume, is ebullient and flaunts her body. According to Italian scholar Fabio Bartoli, her three incarnations could be linked to the three evolutionary stages of the soul postulated by the Jewish Qabbalah—Nephesh, the mere animal vitality, Ruach, the normal human soul, and Neshamah, the elevated spirit and result of the connection between man and God. Her image is often flanked by that of the Moon, a celestial body associated with motherhood, pallor, passivity, and femininity. Japanese engineer Yumiko Yano thus noticed a hieratic and unattainable aura in Rei Ayanami, comparing her to the Virgin Mary. Yano also associated her figure with the fragile and chaste women portrayed in &quot;fin de siècle&quot; art, particularly popular among the works of Symbolists painters. For Kazuya Tsurumaki, Shinji feels a sexual and incestuous desire for her, while Kentaro Takekuma described her as an &quot;eternal virgin&quot;.

== Cultural impact ==
=== Popularity ===
Reception to Rei&#x27;s character has been positive. Since 1995, she became the subject of homages from the &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; fandom, including fan fictions, fan art and&quot; dōjinshi&quot;, proving popular. Writer Patrick W. Galbraith described her as &quot;the single most popular and influential character in the history of &quot;otaku&quot; anime&quot;. She also ranked highly in popularity surveys. Immediately after &quot;Evangelion&#x27;s&quot; first airing concluded, the 1996 and 1997 Anime Grand Prix survey by &quot;Animage&quot; magazine elected Rei best female character of the moment. In 1998, when &quot;Revival of Evangelion&quot; was released, she ranked fifth as the most popular &quot;Evangelion&quot; female character. Rei also appeared in the monthly surveys of the magazine, remeaning in the top ten in 1997 and 1998 and in the top twenty in the 1999 polls. In 2002 TV Asahi ranked her 36th among the 100 most loved characters in anime history. TV Asahi later published the results of polls on anime&#x27;s greatest scenes; all the &quot;Evangelion&quot; scenes which ranked in the lists were related to the character.

Rei Ayanami also won first place in &quot;Newtype&quot; magazine popularity charts. In July 2005, for example, she emerged tenth, and the magazine itself wrote that: &quot;Her many charms and mysteries continue to shine and captivate fans even now, ten years after the broadcast&quot;. In August and September 2009, after the release of &quot;Evangelion 2.0: You Can (Not) Advance&quot;, she ranked in fourth and second place. In October, she took third place, becoming the most popular &quot;Evangelion&quot; female character. Rei was also voted the most popular female anime character from the 1990s in a &quot;Newtype&quot; poll in March 2010. In 2015, almost twenty years after its debut, she conquered the first place among the female characters favored by fans, thus beating all the heroines of the anime of the season, while in 2018 &quot;Rebuild&quot; Rei was included among the best thirty characters of the previous decade. In 2013 the NHK &quot;Shibuya Anime Land&quot; radio show ranked her among the ten top anime heroines of all time.

For Oricon News, Rei&#x27;s character has become &quot;Evangelion&quot;″s emblem. She also ranked in &quot;Evangelion&quot; popularity polls, usually in the top three. A column in the September 2007 issue of the &quot;Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot; newspaper said, on the occasion of &quot;Evangelion 1.0&quot; theatrical release, that there were over one million dedicated Rei fans in Japan and that, &quot;This bandaged Goddess is an icon of Japanese anime.&quot; She also had a place in Mania Entertainment&#x27;s ten iconic anime heroines list written by Thomas Zoth, who commented on the large amount of merchandise based on her: &quot;Shops in Akihabara struggled to keep Rei Ayanami figurines and toys in stock. ... Many critics also credit Ayanami for starting the &quot;moe&quot; boom in anime, with its reliance on weak, vulnerable characters that the audience would desire to protect&quot;. In March and April 2021, after release of the final &quot;Rebuild&quot; film, she finished eighth and sixth most popular female character in a &quot;Newtype&quot; poll, and sixth and second place in May and June.

=== Critical reception ===
Rei has been well received by anime critics. Japanese cultural critic Hiroki Azuma described her as &quot;an extremely impressive character&quot;, praising the performance of Megumi Hayashibara and its psychological realism, since &quot;Rei&#x27;s solitude is grounded in a completely tactile substantiality which gives us extremely realistic images of the discommunication that children of the present face&quot;. &quot;Newtype&quot; praised the fifth and the sixth episode, describing the drawings of the scene in which she smiles at Gendo in &quot;Rei I&quot; as &quot;excellent&quot;, and the scene where she greets Shinji before the battle against the Angel Ramiel in &quot;Rei II&quot; as &quot;impressive&quot;. In February 1996, &quot;Animedia&quot; magazine ranked her smile scene from the sixth episode among the most memorable anime moments of the month. &quot;The Artifice&quot; writer Justin Wu also praised the scene, describing it as a &quot;powerful&quot; and &quot;iconic moment&quot;, since it is &quot;the first time she has deliberately shown an emotion, and one of the handful of times she has done so throughout the whole series&quot;. Screen Rant and Comic Book Resources praised her development and the various revelations about her identity, placing her among the best characters in the series. &quot;Science Fiction Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Tasha Robinson expressed appreciation for the character&#x27;s conclusion. Comic Book Resources&#x27; Luke Penn positively received the differences introduced in Sadamoto&#x27;s manga and the increased space dedicated to her. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked her tenth on its list of the top twenty-five anime characters of all time. Writer Chris Mackenzie described her as &quot;a hugely influential character concept&quot;; Mackenzie also found Rei different from similar characters created after &quot;Evangelion&quot;, since: &quot;The difference between Rei and so many almost-Reis is that there might be something behind the façade.&quot;

Other critics expressed a negative opinion of the character. The Anime-planet.com site, while appreciating some interesting revelations about her past and still considering her &quot;by far the most interesting character&quot;, was critical that her character had not been &quot;explored as much as she should have been&quot;. Animecritics.com wrote, &quot;[Rei] has absolutely no personality to speak of, and she remains an enigma for most of the series. Part of the intrigue in the series is discovering the secrets she holds.&quot; THEM Anime Reviews&#x27; Raphael See criticized the characterization of the whole &quot;Evangelion&quot; cast for being &quot;cliche&quot;, saying he did not understand the reasons for her great popularity. Anime News Network&#x27;s Kenneth Lee considered her character arc a wasted opportunity, as he considered that &quot;a &#x27;dummy shell,&#x27; gaining a soul could had an entire series devoted to it&quot;. Comic Book Resources&#x27; Anthony Gramuglia praised her character design but criticized her lack of development, especially in the 1997 cinematic finale.

While reviewing the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; films, writers from Anime News Network praised Rei&#x27;s character development. On &quot;Evangelion 1.0&quot;, Carlo Santos noticed that Rei&#x27;s personality is the same as in the TV series, and &quot;those who hated the original &quot;Evangelion&quot; for its highly dysfunctional characters still won&#x27;t find anything to like in this version&quot;, while Justin Sevakis praised her response to Shinji&#x27;s kindness in &quot;Evangelion 2.0&quot;. UK Anime described &quot;Rebuild&quot;&#x27;s Rei as a more human character who is easier to empathize with. The Fandom Post appreciated the fact that she becomes progressively more independent from Gendo, while Anime News Network&#x27;s Mark Sombillo wrote: &quot;Her personality and plight form much more of the core motivation of the story and despite her still tryingly hesitant attempts at communication, there&#x27;s genuine warmth beneath her actions and it&#x27;s hard not to be won over by her&quot;.

Her role in the last installment of the saga, &quot;Evangelion 3.0+1.0&quot;, received a particularly positive reception from critics and reviewers, especially for its optimistic view. Critics praised her journey and campy scenes in the first part of the film as &quot;immersive&quot; and &quot;moving&quot;. Crunchyroll&#x27;s Daryl Harding described them as &quot;one of the nicest parts of the film&quot;. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine lauded the fact that the movie shows Rei and the other pilots outside the militarized and violent context of the battles. According to Gizmodo, she has &quot;the most complete journey&quot; among those presented by &quot;3.0+1.0&quot;. Otaquest&#x27;s Chris Cimi similarly praised her character development, saying that her actions &quot;make for something different and warm&quot;, but &quot;still &quot;Evangelion&quot;&quot;.

=== Merchandise ===
Mania.com&#x27;s Thomas Zoth wrote, &quot;Rei Ayanami proved such a popular character that she started a merchandising boom&quot;. Her image was used in a wide range of products, including toys, t-shirts, action figures, musical instruments, life-size statues, makeup, accessories and reproductions of her clothing. On March 30, 2001, King Records launched an album entitled &quot;Evangelion: The Birthday of Rei Ayanami&quot;. In 2012, a team built an tall figure of the character outside of the NTV Tower in the Shiodome area of Tokyo as part of the Shiohaku Expo 2012 summer amusement event. The following year, a reproduction of the girl&#x27;s bedroom was built, and a life-size model was exhibited at the Eva Expo in Shanghai. In 2020, Honda used Rei and other characters from the series for a number of commercials, which aired on the occasion of a collaboration between &quot;Evangelion&quot; and Honda Civic.

In 2007 her costumes ranked first among the best selling cosplay costumes of the year by the company Cospa. Rei Ayanami&#x27;s action figures also enjoyed success. Writer Thomas Lamarre wrote that Sadamoto&#x27;s design for the character became &quot;&quot;the&quot; sensation of the series&quot;, selling &quot;an unprecedented number of figurines&quot; and spurring expensive speculation about her character in the press and the world of anime criticism. The high sales of Ayanami merchandise have been described by scholar Patrick Galbraith as a turning point for the Japanese market, since they helped to expand the figures and fanzines sector, with &quot;entire fanzine conventions ... committed to the series and its characters&quot;. According to one estimate, plastic models before &quot;Evangelion&quot; sold about three thousand units, but Rei&#x27;s figures managed to reach ten times that amount, and for Galbraith &quot;the series overlapped with a boom in figurines of anime characters and the spread of the Internet, making &quot;otaku&quot; consumption and community more conspicuous&quot;. &quot;Newtype USA&quot; magazine similarly wrote that: &quot;Hordes of &quot;otaku&quot; flooded Akihabara in search of the enigmatic Rei Ayanami, and companies realized for the first time that catering to the geek crowd could be very profitable. ... Akihabara itself has transformed from an &#x27;electric town&#x27; famous for household appliances to the geek paradise it is today&quot;.

In 2005, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the first airing of &quot;Evangelion&quot;, &quot;mangaka&quot; Mine Yoshizaki designed several action figures of the Angels with anthropomorphic appearances; among the various models, he devised a figure of the Angel Lilith inspired by Rei&#x27;s character design. According to Japanese writer Kazuhisa Fujie, despite models and toys in the series were a commercial failure at first, Rei&#x27;s action figures immediately became so popular that they exceeded Evangelion&#x27;s unit sales, thus creating the first and perhaps the only case of a robotic anime &quot;where reproductions of the human characters outsold those of the robots&quot;. Furthermore, books and magazines portraying her on the cover were successful. She also appeared on the cover of an issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Japanese edition, among others. An artbook about her named was published in 1997. According to Fujie, sales of Rei-themed merchandise led Japanese media to call her &quot;the girl who manipulates magazine sales at will&quot;, &quot;the fastest route to the sold-out sign&quot; and &quot;the Premium Girl&quot;.

=== Legacy ===
Rei Ayanami had a significant influence on Japanese animation and subsequent fictional characters. Following the fame gained by &quot;Evangelion&quot;, other characters with its aesthetic and character traits were created. Critics regarded Rei and her success as the beginning of the &quot;moe&quot; phenomenon, with the creation of characters according to definite stereotyped features easily recognizable and consumable by the Japanese &quot;otaku&quot; audience. In the late 1990s, characters bearing a close resemblance to Rei have been produced and consumed on a massive scale in comics, anime, and novelizations, both in the commercial market and the fanzine market.

According to Japanese scholar Hiroki Azuma, this output is not linked to a direct &quot;Evangelion&quot; influence, since &quot;the emergence of Ayanami Rei did not influence many authors so much as change the rules of the &quot;moe&quot;-elements sustaining &quot;otaku&quot; culture&quot;. As a result, even authors who were not deliberately thinking of &quot;Evangelion&quot; began to produce characters resembling Rei, using newly registered &quot;moe&quot;-elements, such as a quiet personality, blue hair, white skin, mysterious power and an absence of emotions. For Azuma, moreover, the twenty-sixth episode, in which an alternative reality with Rei running with a slice of bread in her mouth is shown, constitutes a turning point within the &quot;otaku&quot; culture. The scene, according to him, represents the point where the era of great stories ends and that of &quot;moe&quot; characters begins; from that point on, therefore, the emotional response to the protagonists would become more important than the plot of the series. He also regarded Ruriko Tsukishima from &quot;Shizuku&quot; as being directly influenced by Rei, and Ruri Hoshino of &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot; as a combination of both.

Critics compared other characters to her, including Miharu in &quot;Gasaraki&quot;, Vanilla H in &quot;Galaxy Angel&quot;, Maya in &quot;Geobreeders&quot;, Neya in &quot;Infinite Ryvius&quot;, Aruto Kirihara in &quot;Kagihime Monogatari Eikyū Alice Rondo&quot;, Riza Hawkeye in &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;, Dorothy R. Wayneright in &quot;The Big O&quot;, Anthy Himemiya in &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot;, Chise in &quot;Saikano&quot;, Yuzuriha Inori in &quot;Guilty Crown&quot;, Miyu in &quot;My-HiME&quot;, Ai in &quot;&quot;, Diya in &quot;Butterfly Soup&quot;, Yashiro Kasumi in &quot;Muv-Luv&quot; and the female cyborgs in &quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot;. &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot;″s Lain Iwakura was also associated with the character; &quot;Lain&quot;″s main screenwriter Chiaki J. Konaka stated he was not influenced by &quot;Evangelion&quot; and, while appreciating their characteristics, he said he did not see similarities between the two characters. Eureka from &quot;Eureka Seven&quot; has similarly been compared to Rei Ayanami, causing dissatisfaction in series screenwriter Dai Satō. &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;&#x27;s author Nobuhiro Watsuki compared Yukishiro Tomoe to Rei. He said Yukishiro became an Ayanami lookalike, with the only unique feature being her black pupils. The author originally conceived her as a &quot;cool beauty&quot;, but, once she revealed her true feelings in the end, she became a different character.

&quot;The Artifice&quot; writer Justin Wu regards Rei as the prototypical , a term used by anime fans to describe reticent and emotionless characters, usually with a monotone voice who speak to-the-point, and avoid unnecessary conversations. This &quot;moe&quot; element, which gained wide popularity only after Rei&#x27;s success, can be found in numerous subsequent female characters, including Eva in &quot;Black Cat&quot;, Ai Enma in &quot;Hell Girl&quot;, and Yuki Nagato in &quot;Haruhi Suzumiya&quot;. The character is also credited to have popularized the &quot;kuudere&quot; stereotype, a term for male or female characters who hide their true feelings behind a melancholic and cold facade. According to Kaichiro Morikawa, a Japanese architect and academic, characters with physical defects before &quot;Evangelion&quot; and Rei Ayanami were rare, such as Char Aznable in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, who has a scar on his forehead, and Princess Kushana in &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;. Justin Wu also noticed that, after the success of the series, the bandages gained great popularity, becoming the trademark of the character and a common feature in cosplays.

Japanese band Rey derived its name from her. Singer and guitarist Motoo Fujiwara wrote the lyrics of the song &quot;Arue&quot; taking inspiration from Rei, with the English title &quot;R.A.&quot; inspired by the initial letters of her name. Ging Nang Boyz album &quot;Door&quot; features a song named . According to the Japanese site Animentalism, the track &quot;Ray&quot; by rock band Luna Sea, included as the B-side of their single &quot;In Silence&quot; and composed by Sugizo, could be a tribute to Rei Ayanami. Artists have produced fan art about her, including Okama, Huke, Hiroya Oku and Arina Tanemura. Celebrities paid tribute to Rei cosplaying her, including Shoko Nakagawa, Natsuki Katō, Miu Nakamura, Yuuri Morishita, Umika Kawashima, Rio Uchida, Kokoro Shinozaki and Shōma Uno. During Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show 2012 English model Jourdan Dunn wore a dress similar to the character&#x27;s plugsuit; Gainax only learned about the outfit from the Internet and was perplexed by the situation. &quot;&quot; contains a reference to the character. Rei&#x27;s image appeared on a shirt of a character from the &quot;Veronica&#x27;s Closet&quot; series. Further references have been identified in other Japanese animated series, including &quot;Joshiraku&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot;, and &quot;Nisemonogatari&quot;, in which her line from the sixth episode &quot;You won&#x27;t die, because I&#x27;ll protect you&quot; is parodied. According to &quot;Vogue&quot;, her plugsuit also inspired a piece of clothing for the spring 2016 line by the fashion house Louis Vuitton.

<doc id="655371" wikidata="Q1215203" url="?curid=655371" title="The New York Trilogy">
<text>The New York Trilogy is a series of novels by American writer Paul Auster. Originally published sequentially as &quot;City of Glass&quot; (1985), &quot;Ghosts&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Locked Room&quot; (1986), it has since been collected into a single volume. The Trilogy is a postmodern interpretation of detective and mystery fiction, exploring various philosophical themes.

== Plot ==

=== &quot;City of Glass&quot; ===
The first story, &quot;City of Glass&quot;, features an author of detective fiction who becomes a private investigator and descends into madness as he becomes embroiled in the investigation of a case. It explores layers of identity and reality, from Paul Auster the writer of the novel to the unnamed &quot;author&quot; who reports the events as reality, to &quot;Paul Auster the writer&quot;, a character in the story, to &quot;Paul Auster the detective&quot;, who may or may not exist in the novel, to Peter Stillman the younger, to Peter Stillman the elder and, finally, to Daniel Quinn, the protagonist.

&quot;City of Glass&quot; has an intertextual relationship with Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Not only does the protagonist Daniel Quinn share his initials with the knight, but when Quinn finds &quot;Paul Auster the writer,&quot; Auster is in the midst of writing an article about the authorship of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Auster calls his article an &quot;imaginative reading,&quot; and in it he examines possible identities of Cide Hamete Benengeli, the narrator of the &quot;Quixote&quot;.

=== &quot;Ghosts&quot; ===
The second story, &quot;Ghosts&quot;, is about a private eye called Blue, trained by Brown, who is investigating a man named Black on Orange Street for a client named White. Blue writes written reports to White who in turn pays him for his work. Blue becomes frustrated and loses himself as he becomes immersed in the life of Black.

=== &quot;The Locked Room&quot; ===
&quot;The Locked Room&quot; is the story of a writer who lacks the creativity to produce fiction. Fanshawe, his childhood friend, has produced creative work, and when he disappears the writer publishes his work and replaces him in his family. &quot;Paul Auster&quot;, the name, does not appear in this story as it does in &quot;City of Glass&quot;, but Auster breaks the 4th wall by writing about writing of the previous books in the trilogy &quot;...I could not have started this book. The same holds for the two books that come before it, &quot;City of Glass&quot; and &quot;Ghosts&quot;.&quot; He also references clearly autobiographical moments such as his encounter with composer Wyschnegradsky when Auster was a young man in Paris. The title is a reference to a &quot;locked-room mystery&quot;, a popular form of early detective fiction.

== Adaptations ==
&quot;City of Glass&quot; was adapted in 1994 into a critically acclaimed experimental graphic novel by Paul Karasik and David Mazzucchelli. It was published as &quot;City of Glass: A Graphic Mystery&quot; in 2004.

In March 2006, published as text with illustrations by Art Spiegelman and an introduction by Lucy Sante - ISBN 9780143039839.

In 2009, Audible.com produced an audio version of &quot;The New York Trilogy&quot;, narrated by Joe Barrett, as part of its &quot;Modern Vanguard&quot; line of audiobooks.

In 2016, Edward Einhorn adapted &quot;City of Glass&quot; as a play Off-Broadway, at the New Ohio.

In 2017, Duncan Macmillan produced another adaptation as a play, which showed for a short period at HOME in Manchester, before transferring to the Lyric, Hammersmith. It was a co-production between HOME, the Lyric, and 59 Productions.

<doc id="655373" wikidata="Q1936223" url="?curid=655373" title="Minahasan people">
<text>The Minahasans or Minahassa are an Austronesian ethnic group native to North Sulawesi province of Indonesia, formerly known as North Celebes. The Minahasa people sometimes refer to themselves as Manado people. Although the Minahasan pre-Christian creation myth entails some form of ethnic unification, before the nineteenth century the Minahasa region was in no way unified. Instead, a number of politically independent groups (walak) existed together, often in a permanent state of conflict.

Minahasans are the most populous ethnic group in the Minahasan peninsula of North Sulawesi, a Christian-majority region in a Muslim-majority country (Indonesia). The indigenous inhabitants of Minahasa are &#x27;Austronesian&#x27; people who are the descendants of earlier migrations from further North. Prior to contact with Europeans, people living in the Minahasan peninsula primarily had contact with the people of North Maluku and with Chinese and Malay traders from within the Indonesian archipelago. From the 1500s onwards, the region had contact with the Portuguese and Spanish. Ultimately, however, it was the Dutch who colonized the region; firstly through the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and, from 1817 onwards, through the administration of the Dutch nation state.

There are nine languages that are indigenous to the Minahasan peninsula. All languages belong to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family, and five of these (Tondano, Tombulu, Tonsea, Tontemboan, and Tonsawang) comprise the Minahasan microgroup, while three (Bantik, Toratan, and Sangir) are part of the Sangiric group. Another language (Ponosakan) is considered moribund and is part of the Gorontalo-Mongondow microgroup. The language of wider communication, Manado Malay (also known as &quot;Minahasa Malay&quot;), contains numerous loan words from Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch - a result of contact with European powers from 1523 onwards. While Manado Malay bears some similarities with other varieties of Malay spoken in eastern Indonesia, it also displays many differences. It has been termed both a creole language and a dialect or variety of Malay.

Minahasa Raya is the area covering Bitung City, Manado City, Tomohon City, Minahasa Regency, North Minahasa Regency, South Minahasa Regency and Southeast Minahasa Regency, which are altogether seven of the fifteen regional administrations in the province of North Sulawesi, Indonesia.

Historically, the Minahasa region was located within the sphere of influence of the Ternate Sultanate. The links with the Ternate people are evidenced by lexical borrowings from the Ternate language; moreover, Manado Malay originates from North Moluccan Malay (Ternate Malay). The Minahasa people, however, resisted Islamization. In the Dutch East Indies the Minahasa people identified strongly with the Dutch language, culture and the Protestant faith – so strongly, in fact, that when Indonesia became independent in 1945 certain factions of political elites of the region even pleaded with the Dutch to let it become a province of the Netherlands. The centuries-old strong bond between the Minahasa and the Netherlands has recently been studied and explained using the Stranger King concept.

There is a considerable number of people from the Minahasa living in the Netherlands, as part of the Indo (Eurasian) community.

== History ==

The word &#x27;Minahasa&#x27; is made up of the prefix ma-, the infix -in-, and the independent word esa &#x27;one&#x27;. In English this translates as &#x27;become one&#x27; or &#x27;united&#x27;. The name Minahasa appears in written sources for the first time in 1789.

North Sulawesi never developed any large empire. In 670, the leaders of the different tribes, who all spoke different languages, met by a stone known as Watu Pinawetengan. There they founded a community of independent states, who would form one unit and stay together and would fight any outside enemies if they were attacked.

Until well into the 19th century, the Minahasa was made up of rivaling warrior societies that practiced headhunting. Only during &#x27;Pax Neerlandica&#x27; of the formal colonisation of the Dutch East Indies did the state of permanent internal warfare and the practice of headhunting subside.

=== Origin of Minahasa people ===

The province of North Sulawesi was the location of one of the first southward Austronesian migrations patterns in the late third and second millennia BC. The generally-accepted hypothesis is that the Austronesian people originally inhabited Taiwan, before migrating and colonising areas in the northern Philippines, the southern Philippines, Borneo, and Sulawesi before splitting into separate groups, with one heading west to Java, Sumatra, and Malaya, while the other moved east towards Oceania.

According to Minahasa mythology the Minahasans are descendants of &quot;Toar&quot; and &quot;Lumimuut&quot;. Initially, the descendants of &quot;Toar-Lumimuut&quot; were divided into three groups: &quot;Makatelu-pitu&quot; (three times seven), &quot;Makarua-siouw&quot; (two times nine) and &quot;Pasiowan-Telu&quot; (nine times three). They multiplied quickly. But soon there were disputes among these people. Their leaders named &quot;Tona&#x27;as&quot; then decided to meet and talk about this. They met in Awuan (north of the current Tonderukan hill). That meeting was called &quot;Pinawetengan u-nuwu&quot; (dividing of language) or &quot;Pinawetengan um-posan&quot; (dividing of ritual). At that meeting the descendants were divided into three groups named Tonsea, Tombulu, and Tontemboan corresponding to the groups mentioned above. At the place where this meeting took place a memorial stone called &quot;Watu Pinabetengan&quot; (Stone of Dividing) was then built. It is a favourite tourist destination.

The groups Tonsea, Tombulu, and Tontemboan then established their main territories which were Maiesu, Niaranan, and Tumaratas respectively. Soon several villages were established outside these territories. These new villages then became a ruling center of a group of villages called &quot;puak&quot;, later &quot;walak&quot;, comparable to the present-day district.

Subsequently, a new group of people arrived in Pulisan peninsula. Owing to numerous conflicts in this area, they then moved inland and established villages surrounding a large lake. These people were therefore called Tondano, Toudano or Toulour (meaning water people). This lake is now the Tondano lake.

In the following years, more groups came to Minahasa. There were:
* people from the islands of Maju and Tidore who landed in Atep. These people were the ancestors of the Tonsawang ethnic group.
* people from Tomori Bay. These were the ancestors of the subethnic Pasam-bangko (Ratahan dan Pasan)
* people from Bolaang Mangondow who were the ancestors of Ponosakan (Belang).
* people from the Bacan archipelago and Sangi, who then occupied Lembeh, Talisei Island, Manado Tua, Bunaken and Mantehage. These were the subethnic Bobentehu (Bajo). They landed in the place now called Sindulang. They then established a kingdom called Manado which ended in 1670 and became walak Manado.
* people from Toli-toli, who in the early 18th century landed first in Panimburan and then went to Bolaang-Mangondow
* and finally to the place where Malalayang is now located. These people were the ancestors of the subethnic Bantik.

There are the nine groups in North Sulawesi which are originally differentiated ethnically and linguistically. Of these nine, only the first five are of Minahasan descent:
*Tonsea
*Tombulu
*Tontemboan
*Tondano (Toulour)
*Tonsawang
*Ratahan (Toratán)
*Ponosakan
*Sangir
*Bantik

The first recorded use of the term &quot;Minahasa&quot; occurs in a treaty with the Dutch signed in 1790. A common misconception is that the unity among different ethnic groups arose as a result of a historical alliance to fight the Bolaang-Mongondow kingdom. However, the creation of Minahasan unity was in fact almost exclusively the product of the colonisation and Christian conversion enacted by the Dutch. The colonial administration and Dutch missionaries undertook various policies which resulted in ethnic unification and the increased use of the Manado Malay language.

Among the Minahasan heroes in the wars against Bolaang-Mongondow are: Porong, Wenas, Dumanaw and Lengkong (in the war near Lilang village), Gerungan, Korengkeng, Walalangi (near Panasen, Tondano), Wungkar, Sayow, Lumi, and Worotikan (in the war along Amurang Bay).

Until the dominance of Dutch influence in the 17th and 18th century, the Minahassans lived in warrior societies that practised headhunting.

=== European era ===

In the second half of the 16th century, both Portuguese and the Spanish arrived in North Sulawesi. Half-way through the 17th century, there was a rapprochement between the Minahasan chiefs and the Dutch East India Company (VOC), which was given concrete form in the treaty of 1679 (which can be found in the Corpus Diplomaticus Neerlando-Indicum 1934, vol. III, no 425). From 1801 to 1813, the Netherlands were occupied by the French imperial forces of Napoleon and the Minahasa came under English control. In 1817 Dutch rule was re-established until 1949.

At the time of the first contact with Europeans the sultanate of Ternate held some sway over North Sulawesi, and the area was often visited by seafaring Bugis traders from South Sulawesi. The Spanish and the Portuguese, the first Europeans to arrive, landed in Minahasa via the port of Makasar, but also landed at the Sulu archipelago (off the northeast coast of Borneo) and at the port of Manado. The abundance of natural resources in Minahasa made Manado a strategic port for European traders sailing to and from the spice island of Maluku. Although they had sporadic contacts with Minahasa, the Spanish and Portuguese influence was limited by the power of the Ternate sultanate.

The Portuguese and Spaniards left reminders of their presence in the north in subtle ways. Portuguese surnames and various Portuguese words not found elsewhere in Indonesia, like garrida for an enticing woman and buraco for a bad man, can still be found in Minahasa. In the 1560s the Portuguese Franciscan missionaries made some converts in Minahasa.

The Spanish had already set themselves up in the Philippines and Minahasa was used to plant coffee that came from South America because of its rich soil. Manado was further developed by Spain to become the center of commerce for the Chinese traders who traded the coffee in China. With the help of native allies the Spanish took over the Portuguese fortress in Amurang in the 1550s, and Spanish settlers also established a fort at Manado, so that eventually Spain controlled all of the Minahasa. It was in Manado where one of the first Indo-Eurasian (Mestizo) communities in the archipelago developed during the 16th century. The first King of Manado (1630) named Muntu Untu was in fact the son of a Spanish Mestizo.

Spain renounced her possessions in Minahasa by means of a treaty with the Portuguese in return for a payment of 350,000 ducats. Minahasan rulers sent Supit, Pa&#x27;at and Lontoh (their statues are located in Kauditan, about 30 km to Bitung) where they made an alliance treaty with the Dutch. Together eventually gained the upper hand in 1655, built their own fortress in 1658 and expelled the last of the Portuguese a few years later.

By the early 17th century the Dutch had toppled the Ternate sultanate, and then set about eclipsing the Spanish and Portuguese. As was the usual case in the 1640s and 50s, the Dutch colluded with local powers to throw out their European competitors. In 1677 the Dutch occupied Pulau Sangir and, two years later, the Dutch governor of Maluku, Robert Padtbrugge, visited Manado. Out of this visit came a treaty with the local Minahasan chiefs, which led to domination by the Dutch for the next 300 years although indirect government only commenced in 1870.

The Dutch helped unite the linguistically diverse Minahasa confederacy, and in 1693 the Minahasa scored a decisive military victory against the Bolaang to the south. The Dutch influence flourished as the Minahasans embraced European culture and Christian religion. Missionary schools in Manado in 1881 were among the first attempts at mass education in Indonesia, giving their graduates a considerable edge in gaining civil service, military and other positions of influence.

Relations with the Dutch were often less than cordial (a war was fought around Tondano between 1807 and 1809) and the region did not actually come under direct Dutch rule until 1870. The Dutch and the Minahasans eventually became so close that the north was often referred to as the 12th province of the Netherlands. A Manado – based political movement called Twaalfde Provincie even campaigned for Minahasa&#x27;s integration into the Dutch state in 1947.

Portuguese activity apart, Christianity became a force in the early 1820s when a Calvinist group, the Netherlands Missionary Society, turned from an almost exclusive interest in Maluku to the Minahasa area. The wholesale conversion of the Minahasans was almost complete by 1860. With the missionaries came mission schools, which meant that, as in Ambon and Roti, Western education in Minahasa started much earlier than in other parts of Indonesia. The Dutch government eventually took over some of these schools and also set up others. Because the schools taught in Dutch, the Minahasans had an early advantage in the competition for government jobs and places in the colonial army. Minahasans remain among the educated elite today.

====Armed forces====

A relatively large number of Minahasans pursued professional military careers in the colonial army (KNIL). Next to the South Moluccan Ambonese, the Minahasa Menadonese were also considered a martial race and therefore particularly competent and trustworthy as soldiers. As KNIL soldiers the Minahasans fought alongside the Dutch to subdue rebellions in other parts of the archipelago, such as for instance the Java War of 1825–1830.

As a large percentage of Minahasans was formally equalised to the European legal class, young men were also obliged to serve as conscripts when mandatory military service for Europeans was introduced in 1917. Older men (as off 32) were obliged to join the Home guard (Dutch: Landstorm).

During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies in WWII many Menadonese soldiers were held captive as POW&#x27;s.

=== Republic of Indonesia ===

The Japanese occupation of 1942–45 was a period of deprivation, and the Allies bombed Manado heavily in 1945. During the Revolution for independence that followed, there was bitter division between pro-Indonesian Unitarians and those favoring Dutch-sponsored federalism. The appointment of a Manadonese Christian, Sam Ratulangi, as the first republican governor of eastern Indonesia, was decisive in winning Minahasan support for the republic. A contra-revolution such as the Republik Maluku Selatan one in the Moluccas was averted.

As the young republic lurched from crisis to crisis, Jakarta&#x27;s monopoly over the copra trade seriously weakened Minahasa&#x27;s economy. As in Sumatra, there was a general feeling that the central government was inefficient, development was stagnating and money was being plugged into Java. Circumstances favored the spread of communism.

Illegal exports flourished and in June 1956 Jakarta ordered the closure of Manado port, the busiest smuggling port in the republic. Local leaders refused and Jakarta backed down. Soon Permesta rebels confronted the central government with demands for political, economic and regional reform. Jakarta responded by bombing Menado city in February 1958, and then invading the Minahasa in June 1958, but were only able to end the Permesta revolt in 1961.

====Permesta====

In March 1957, the military leaders of both southern and northern Sulawesi launched a confrontation with the central government, with demands for greater regional autonomy. They demanded more local development, a fairer share of revenue, help in suppressing the Kahar Muzakar rebellion in Southern Sulawesi, and a cabinet of the central government led jointly by Sukarno and Hatta. At least initially the &#x27;Permesta&#x27; (Piagam Perjuangan Semesta Alam) rebellion was a reformist rather than a separatist movement.

Negotiations between the central government and the Sulawesi military leaders prevented violence in southern Sulawesi, but the Minahasan leaders were dissatisfied with the agreements and the movement split. Inspired, perhaps, by fears of domination by the south, the Minahasan leaders declared their own autonomous state of North Sulawesi in June 1957. By this time the central government had the situation in southern Sulawesi pretty much under control but in the north they had no strong local figure to rely upon and there were rumors that the United States, suspected of supplying arms to rebels in Sumatra, was also in contact with the Minahasan leaders.

The possibility of foreign intervention finally drove the central government to seek military support from southern Sulawesi. Permesta forces were driven out of central Sulawesi, Gorontalo, Sangir island and from Morotai in Maluku (from whose airfield the rebels had hoped to fly bombing raids on Jakarta). The rebels&#x27; few planes (supplied by the US and flown by Filipino, Taiwanese and US pilots) were destroyed. US policy shifted, favoring Jakarta, and in June 1958 central government troops landed in Minahasa. The Permesta rebellion was finally put down in mid-1961.

The effect of both the Sumatran and Sulawesi rebellions was to strengthen exactly those trends the rebels had hoped to weaken. Central authority was enhanced at the expense of local autonomy, radical nationalism gained over pragmatic moderation, the power of the communists and Sukarno increased while that of Hatta waned, and Sukarno was able to establish guided democracy in 1959. Five years after, Sukarno signed Law No. 13, creating the new province of North Sulawesi as enacted by the People&#x27;s Representative Council, ending a long dream of a province of their own for the Minahasa.

After the fall of New Order, the Indonesian government under B.J. Habibie has adopted policies to strengthen local autonomy, the very idea that Permesta fought for.


== Culture ==

Ancient Minahasa society was both competitive and egalitarian. Important &quot;walian&quot; (religious shaman) were often female and Minahasa culture does not show any particular discrimination against women. Important decisions concerning the community were made democratically. Owing to the virtual equality in birth a person&#x27;s rise in status was mainly dependent on personal achievements and the expression of personal virtues.

Leadership positions and higher status were acquired via two main mechanisms: the deployment of wealth and the show of bravery. The first was achieved via &#x27;status selematans&#x27;, ceremonial feasts called &quot;foso,&quot; and the latter originally via successful headhunting.

Headhunting helped the warrior gain a religious concept called &quot;keter&quot;, which is similar to the Malay term &quot;semangat&quot; and means &#x27;soul/spirit substance&#x27;. This spiritual and physical force is expressed as courage, eloquence, virility and fertility. Even without the actual practice of headhunting and other old traditions and customs these core elements of original Minahasa culture are still held in high regard. To this day the deployment of wealth, bravery, obstinacy and the eloquence of verbal resistance are important to social mobility in the Minahasa.

Minhasa dead were buried in &quot;waruga&quot;, a type of sarcophagus, until the practice was outlawed by the Dutch.

Although after the Dutch came to Minahasa and after the treaty of 1699 between the Dutch and the Minahasan people, most Minahasan people. especially the upperclass and the ones living in Manado, slowly adopted European and Dutch culture and heavily westernized. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Minahasan people had completely adopted a more European culture, clothing and lifestyle until the revival of ancient Minahasan culture in the late 20th century. Although even until today there are some Minahasan who are more Dutch or European cultured. This makes the Minahasan people a unique group of people among other Indonesians. And it was described that Minahasa itself is a lonely outpost of Western culture and Christianity, a bastion of loyalty to colonial power. The Minahasan are the subject of a study called Stranger King theory.

=== Religion ===


The Minahasan indigenous religion is Malesung with Tonaas Walian as their leader.

In 1907, Firma P.W.M Trap, Leiden, Holland published a Bible in the Tontemboan language, a language of Minahasa. It was edited by M. Adriani-Gunning and J. Regar.

At 93% of the population, the Minahasa Regency has one of highest proportions of Christianity in Indonesia. It has the highest density of church buildings in Indonesia, with approximately one church for every 100m road. This is due to a successful missionary campaign by European Christians in Northern Sulawesi.

=== Cuisine ===

Minahasan cuisine is very spicy, and can feature ingredients not typically found in other parts of Indonesia. For example, dog (RW, short for &quot;rintek wuuk&quot;, or &quot;fine hair&quot; in Tontemboan), cat (&quot;tusa&quot;&#x27;, also known as &quot;eveready&quot; because of the cat logo used by the battery), forest rat, and fruit bat (&quot;paniki&quot;), python snake or the local called it patola are commonly eaten. Other than these exotic meats, seafoods are abundant in Manado and other port cities in North Sulawesi. Popular fish such as &quot;cakalang&quot; (skipjack tuna), tuna, red snapper, and &quot;tude&quot; (mackerel). Cakalang fufu, the smoked skipjack tuna is a popular dish of Bitung fishing town. The provincial capital Manado is often referred to as Kota Tinutuan, in reference to a popular local dish: a rice porridge made with corn, smoked fish, greens, and chilies. Known outside the province as &quot;Bubur Manado&quot;, &quot;tinutuan&quot; is supposed to improve health and vitality.

Another popular minahasan cuisine is rica-rica and dabu-dabu. Rica-rica is dishes usually fish or meat, cooked in spicy red chili, shallots, garlic, and tomato, while dabu-dabu is a type of condiment similar to sambal, made of chopped chilli, shallots, and green tomato mixed with a little vinegar or lime juice. Another vegetables is &quot;sayur bunga papaya&quot;, papaya flower buds sauteed with shallots, chilli and green tomato.

=== Dance ===

&quot;Kabasaran&quot; is the fierce and famous Minahasan wardance which reminds of the old Minahasa warrior societies. The dancers wear red garments which in the old times was a color exclusive for the accomplished headhunter. This dance is similar to the Moluccan &quot;cakalele&quot; wardance.

Another famous dance is the &quot;katrili&quot; dance that&#x27;s still widely performed in Minahasa. The &quot;katrili&quot; dance is originally a Portuguese folk dance and was adopted into Minahasan society. The dancer would use a European style ball dress for the ladies and usually a formal European attire for the men, usually consisting of a plain shirt a vest dress or dancing shoes and a wide brimmed hat (a fedora or a slouch hat).

=== Music ===
Native Minahasan music includes percussions such as gong, drum and &quot;kolintang&quot;. Minahasa music is highly influenced by that of the European colonials; their festivals feature large marching bands made up of clarinets, saxophones (source), trumpets, trombones, and tubas, all constructed out of local bamboo, which form the basis of a song genre known as &quot;musik bambu&quot;.

=== Languages ===

In Minahasa, five distinct languages are spoken: Tonsawang, Tontemboan, Toulour, Tonsea and Tombulu. In 1996, the Summer Institute of Linguistics in Dallas, United States published the &quot;North Sulawesi Language Survey&quot; by Scott Merrifield and Martinus Salea. It gives an overview of the classification and distribution of the languages, based on a detailed study of the phonology and vocabulary.

Influences of Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch can be found in Manado Malay:

&quot;Chair&quot; in Indonesian is &quot;kursi&quot;, in Manado Malay it is called &quot;kadera&quot; (&quot;cadeira&quot; – Portuguese word for &quot;chair&quot;).

&quot;Horse&quot; in Indonesian is &quot;kuda&quot;, a word of Sanskrit origin. In the town of Tomohon, a horse is called &quot;kafalio&quot; (&#x27;cavalo&quot; – Portuguese&#x27;, &quot;caballo&quot; – Spanish).

While there is not much known about the origin of ideogramatical Minahasa writing system, currently the orthography used for indigenous Minahasan languages closely matches that used for Indonesian.

<doc id="655377" wikidata="Q1371488" url="?curid=655377" title="Nagoum Yamassoum">
<text>Nagoum Yamassoum (born 1954) is a Chadian politician who was Prime Minister of Chad from 1999 to 2002 and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs from 2003 to 2005. He is from the district of Grande Sido in the region of Moyen Chari.

==Early life and education==
Yamassoum received a doctorate degree in political science from the University of Bordeaux in France, with a thesis entitled &quot;Contribution à l&#x27;étude des stratégies et techniques d&#x27;influence des États-Unis et de l&#x27;Union soviétique en Afrique sub-saharienne&quot; (A contribution to the study of American and Soviet strategies and techniques of influence in sub-Saharan Africa). His thesis was accepted in 1988. He has also written several works on the foreign policy of African states. In 1980, he published a work on the stance of Muammar Gaddafi in international relations, called &quot;La Politique extérieure du colonel Kadhafi&quot; (The foreign policy of Colonel Gaddafi). He also specifically studied the politics of Chad, including an analysis of the political repercussions of strikes against François Tombalbaye in N&#x27;Djamena during the years 1971 and 1972.

==Political career==
In the 1996 presidential election, Yamassoum directed President Idriss Déby&#x27;s campaign. After serving as President of the Constitutional Council, he was named Prime Minister of Chad on December 13, 1999; he had also previously served as Minister of Education and Minister of Culture. He served as Prime Minister until June 12, 2002, when he resigned and was replaced by Haroun Kabadi. In June 2003, when Kabadi&#x27;s government resigned and a new government led by Moussa Faki took office, Yamassoum was appointed as the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs. He left that position in August 2005 when a cabinet reshuffle occurred.

Yamassoum was appointed as chairman of the Board of the Hydrocarbons Company of Chad (&quot;Societe des Hydrocarbures du Tchad&quot;, SHT) in November 2007. Later, as Secretary-General of the Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS), Yamassoum was entrusted with leading the ruling party into 2011, a major election year—both parliamentary and presidential elections were planned. Critics argued that he lacked popularity with the party base. He was replaced as Secretary-General by Haroun Kabadi in January 2011, before the elections were held.

Yamassoum was subsequently appointed as President of the Constitutional Council. He headed the court when it validated the results of the April 2016 presidential election, in which Déby won re-election in the first round, on 4 May 2016.

In 2019, he became the first chairman of the newly created Central African Financial Market Supervisory Commission, a position he held until 2023.

<doc id="655378" wikidata="Q2459549" url="?curid=655378" title="Tulpehocken Creek (Pennsylvania)">
<text>Tulpehocken Creek is a tributary of the Schuylkill River in southeastern Pennsylvania in the United States, and during the American Canal Age, once provided nearly half the length of the Union Canal linking the port of Philadelphia, the largest American city and the other communities of Delaware Valley with the Susquehanna basin and the Pennsylvania Canal System connecting the Eastern seaboard to Lake Erie and the new settlements of the Northwest Territory via the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio Rivers at Pittsburgh.

An important transportation route in the early United States, the creek drains a limestone hill country area of Berks County south of the Appalachian Mountains and is considered one of the finest trout streams in southeastern Pennsylvania. The valley of the creek was known in colonial times as the Tulpehocken, stretching west of Reading. It was inhabited by the Lenape and was a destination for early German-speaking settlers. The name comes from a Lenape word &quot;Tulpewikaki&quot;, meaning &quot;land of turtles&quot;. It is a designated Pennsylvania Scenic River. Major tributaries include the Cacoosing Creek, Spring Creek and Northkill Creek.

==Description==
Tulpehocken Creek rises in eastern Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, and flows generally east, in a winding course, through Myerstown, entering Berks County, passing north of Womelsdorf. At Womelsdorf it turns abruptly north, then flows southeast, through the Blue Marsh Lake reservoir and joins the Schuylkill at Reading.

In the 1720s, the creek&#x27;s valley, like many in those days of dependence upon water power with a poor transportation infrastructure system, was a destination for early Swiss and Palatine settlers, who used the creek for extensive milling operations. In the 19th century, as it had for the light canoes of the Susquehannock and Delaware peoples, it provided an important early transportation route with the building in 1828 of the Union Canal along the river, connecting from its headwaters to those of Quittapahilla Creek in Lebanon County.


The proposed canal, again surveyed in the 1790s as the private stock corporation Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company and its successor, the Union canal taken together with the Schuylkill Canal (1822) running W-E from Reading to Philadelphia (allowing large shipments of coal to Philadelphia), provided one of only two water routes between the Susquehanna River and the Delaware River. The other was the Chesapeake and Delaware canal. Using the canal, manufacturies in Philadelphia and New Jersey could ship goods west to the newly settled lands west of the gaps of the Allegheny, out to the midwest. The Union canal and the Schuylkill Canal companies were private stock companies and worked with the State built Pennsylvania Canal to tranship grain to Philadelphia. The improvements along Tulpehocken Creek by engineering navigations of the two companies provided nearly half the length of the final Union Canal completed in 1828.

The creek is impounded for flood control above Reading by the earthen Blue Marsh Dam (see Blue Marsh State Park) completed in 1979 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to form the Blue Marsh Lake reservoir. The bottom-release design of the dam allows for the discharge of a cold water at a constant temperature, resulting in an ideal habitat for rainbow trout and brown trout, which are stocked annually in the stream.

<text>HMS &quot;Matapan&quot; (D43) was a later or 1943 fleet destroyer of the Royal Navy (RN). She was named after the Battle of Cape Matapan between the Royal Navy and the Regia Marina, which ended in a decisive victory for the RN force, resulting in the destruction of three cruisers and two destroyers of the Italian Navy and was a heavy blow to the Italians. So far, she has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear that name.

She was placed in reserve on completion of her sea trials and would remain in such a state for a lengthy period of time, ultimately seeing service in the 1970s as a sonar trials ship. In the process she outlived all her fleetmates in Royal Navy service.

==Operational history==

===Completion and reserve===

&quot;Matapan&quot; was built by John Brown &amp; Company. She was launched on 30 April 1945 and finally completed on 5 September 1947.

The ship undertook her builders and acceptance sea trials over a period of two weeks, during which she steamed for a total of 150 hours, arriving at Chatham on 22 September, where she was de-stored. &quot;Matapan&quot; was initially laid up in Gillingham Reach on the River Medway from 28 October 1947 and was subsequently towed to Devonport on 20 July 1948, where she was prepared for preservation in long-term reserve. She was to remain moored in the River Tamar for the next 20 years.

===Conversion to Sonar Trials Ship===

In 1961 &quot;Matapan&quot; was first earmarked for conversion to a sonar trials ship, to replace . It appears that lack of money to pay for the necessary work, may be the reason why this was delayed for so long.

Advances in Soviet nuclear submarine performance during the 1960s rendered the existing NATO sonar equipment, which were based on analogue technology of World War II origin and had limited range, obsolescent. In 1968 the Admiralty issued a draft Staff Requirement for the Type 2016 hull sonar, which was intended to replace not only the widely used Type 184, but other types of specialist sonars, such as the Types 170, 176 and 177. Type 2016 had an effective range of up to in calm conditions in coastal waters, and up to in deep water, compared to for the Type 177. It used pre-formed digital beams at lower frequencies than previous types, that could track many more targets, whilst using fewer ratings to process the information. The drawback of the use of much lower frequencies however, was the need for a much longer array. The urgency of the need led to the plan to convert &quot;Matapan&quot; being revived, as a test bed for the new equipment.

On 5 January 1970, &quot;Matapan&quot; was towed to Portsmouth where she began her conversion, that resulted in her appearance becoming radically different from when she was launched in 1945. To house the x arrays required on either side of the keel, required the addition of a deep skeg on the bottom of her hull, which would increase her draught to and increase her displacement to 3835 tons. Additionally, a large bulbous sonar dome was added to her bow. All of her armament was removed and a new deckhouse and bridge were added forward, along with a plated foremast to house additional radars. Towards the stern, she was fitted with a second funnel to vent the exhaust gases from the generators needed to power the sonar, and a helicopter flight deck on a deckhouse aft. The ship was also re-wired and fitted with new operations and control rooms, and additional accommodation for scientific staff. The reconstruction work was completed in July 1972 and she began her sea trials.

===Service as Sonar Trials Ship 1973–1977===

Upon completion of her sea trials, &quot;Matapan&quot; entered active service for the very first time, commissioned on 2 February 1973, joining the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment (AUWE), based in Portland. Her trials were conducted initially in British coastal waters, where the sonar operators found that their new equipment was very loud and required the use of ear defenders.

During 1976 she operated in the Atlantic and Caribbean, undertaking trials with the United States Navy, including operating with the submarine, . During these exercises it was reported by P.O.Moore (Petty Officer, Torpedo and Anti-Submarine Instructor) that: &quot;The crew of USS Tullibee, claimed that having our sonar ping them was like having a metal bucket on your head and someone hitting it with a sledgehammer.&quot;

Late in her career, &quot;Matapan&quot; also undertook testing of an alternative Towed Array Sonar, Type 2031, which offered the improved performance of the Type 2016, without the cost and space needs of the hull mounted type. The Type 2016 however, had already had a major influence on future warship evolution, as the Royal Navy&#x27;s new Type 22 frigate was designed to mount the Type 2016, which resulted in a step change in hull size, in comparison to previous frigate designs, and ultimately it saw service in the larger warships of the Royal Navy, including the s and Type 42 destroyers. The towed array Type 2031 and its successor, the Type 2087, manufactured by Thales, have now become the standard equipment of the Royal Navy Type 23 frigates.

===Final days===

&quot;Matapan&quot; was decommissioned in August 1977 and laid up at Portsmouth. On 18 May 1979 she was sold to H.K.Vickers and was broken up at Blyth in Northumberland.

== Early life and education ==
Seyoum was born on 25 January 1949 in Tigray, Ethiopia, as &quot;Ambaye Mesfin&quot;. He later changed from &quot;Ambaye&quot; to &quot;Seyoum&quot; as a &quot;nom de guerre&quot;. He attended Agazi Secondary School in Adigrat and Bahir Dar Polytechnic Institute from which he received a diploma in industrial chemistry in 1971. He studied international law at the University of Amsterdam. In May 2010, he was awarded a doctorate of letters from Great Lakes University of Kisumu in Kenya.

== Career ==

=== Political career ===
He was one of the founders of the Tigray Peoples&#x27; Liberation Front (TPLF). Seyoum served as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) in the 1980s. He was a member of the Marxist–Leninist League of Tigray (MLLT) and composed songs to honor the organization. On 23 March 2013, Seyoum resigned from the TPLF Central Committee at its 11th meeting.

He was also an executive member of the Central Committee of the EPRDF. He was influential in the Eritrean Ethiopian war and on 18 June 2000, Seyoum Mesfin, and his Eritrean counterpart, Haile Woldetensae, signed a peace agreement ending the war. On 28 December 2004, Mesfin made a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York on the policy in the region, in particular the relationship of Ethiopia to Eritrea and Somalia. In 2007, Seyoum indicated that Eritrea had breached the agreements that ended its war and Ethiopia might end all or part of those agreements. He was also a member of the House of Peoples&#x27; Representatives, representing Adigrat.

<text>Grant Henry Hill (born October 5, 1972) is an American professional basketball executive and former player who is a co-owner of the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and a part-owner of Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer (MLS) and Orlando Pride of the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL). He is also part of an ownership group that purchased the Baltimore Orioles in 2024. Hill also works as a basketball analyst for CBS and Turner Sports.

A four-year player at Duke University, Hill was touted as one of the greatest college basketball players ever. In the NBA, he played for the Detroit Pistons, the Orlando Magic, the Phoenix Suns, and the Los Angeles Clippers, mostly at the small forward position. Hill is a seven-time NBA All-Star, a five-time All-NBA selection, and a three-time winner of the NBA Sportsmanship Award. In 2018, he was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.

The 1994 ACC Player of the Year, a two-time NCAA All-American, and a two-time NCAA champion, Hill is generally considered one of the best ever to play for the Duke Blue Devils.

After graduating in 1994, Hill was selected by the Pistons with the third overall pick in the NBA draft. He was the co-winner of the 1995 NBA Rookie of the Year Award with Jason Kidd. Early in his NBA career, Hill was widely considered one of the best all-around players in the game, often leading his team in points, rebounds and assists. In his first six seasons in the NBA, Hill averaged 21.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game and made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team five times. 

An ankle injury in 2000 changed the trajectory of his career. It plagued him for several years, led to a March 2003 surgery that was followed by life-threatening complications, and forced him to miss the entire 2003–04 season. In 2005, Hill made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team as a member of the Magic. He played in the Western Conference Finals in 2010 with the Phoenix Suns. In the 12 seasons after his ankle injury, Hill averaged 13.1 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game. On June 1, 2013, Hill announced his retirement from the NBA. 

In 2015, Hill and Tony Ressler were part of an ownership group that purchased the Atlanta Hawks. In 2023, Hill and his wife, Tamia became part owners of MLS club Orlando City and NWSL club, Orlando Pride.

==College career==

When the time came to choose a college, Hill&#x27;s mother told the Fox Sports documentary &quot;Beyond the Glory&quot;, that she wanted him to attend Georgetown, while his father preferred the University of North Carolina. Hill decided to attend Duke University, playing four years with the Blue Devils and winning national titles in 1991 and 1992. Duke became the first Division I program to win consecutive titles since UCLA in 1966–73. Despite losing two of the biggest contributors on the Blue Devils, Christian Laettner (in 1992) and Bobby Hurley (each of whom went on to play in the NBA), Hill led Duke to the championship game once again in 1994, but lost to the Arkansas Razorbacks. Hill won the Henry Iba Corinthian Award as the nation&#x27;s top defensive player in 1993, and in 1994 he was the ACC Player of the Year. During his collegiate career, Hill became the first player in ACC history to collect more than 1,900 points, 700 rebounds, 400 assists, 200 steals, and 100 blocked shots. As a result of his successful college career, he became the eighth player in Duke history to have his jersey number (33) retired. After his freshman season at Duke, Hill played on the bronze medal-winning U.S. team at the 1991 Pan American Games, held in Havana, Cuba. As an amateur, Hill was also part of the select team of college players that prepared and scrimmaged against the eventual U.S. men&#x27;s basketball team (&quot;Dream Team&quot;) for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.

Hill also is widely known for his role in the Hail Mary play in the NCAA tournament regional final against Kentucky in 1992, which is considered by many to be one of the greatest college basketball games of all time. With Duke down 103–102 in overtime and 2.1 seconds remaining after Kentucky&#x27;s Sean Woods hit a floater, an unguarded Hill heaved the inbounds pass 75 feet across the court into the hands of Laettner, who dribbled once and spun before pulling up to make the game-winning jumper from just outside the free-throw line as time expired. Hill later produced a film, &quot;Duke 91 &amp; 92: Back to Back&quot; about the team&#x27;s consecutive wins and this game-winning play. In 2016, Hill was inducted into the Duke Sports Hall of Fame

Touted as one of the best players in Duke history, many went as far as to say that Hill was one of the greatest college basketball players of his era. In 2002, Hill was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men&#x27;s basketball team honoring the fifty greatest players in ACC History.

==Professional career==

===Detroit Pistons (1994–2000)===
Hill was drafted by the Detroit Pistons with the third pick in the NBA draft after graduating from Duke in 1994. He generally played the small forward position during his NBA career. In his first season, he averaged 19.9 points, 6.4 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.77 steals per game, and became the first Pistons rookie since Isiah Thomas in 1981–82 to score 1,000 points. Hill ended up sharing NBA Rookie of the Year Award honors with Jason Kidd of the Dallas Mavericks, becoming the first Piston since Dave Bing in 1966–67 to win the award. Hill also won the &quot;Sporting News&quot; Rookie of the Year Award. He was named to the all-NBA First Team in 1997, and All-NBA Second Teams in 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2000. Hill also regularly played in the NBA All-Star Game, where he made history by being the first rookie to lead an NBA All-Star fan balloting in (1994–95) with 1,289,585 votes, narrowly defeating Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. Also, he became the first rookie in any of the four major professional sports leagues to lead all-star fan voting.

In his second season (1995–96), he once again led the All-Star fan balloting, this time edging Michael Jordan (Jordan&#x27;s first All-Star game after returning since retiring in 1993). During the 1995–96 season, Hill showcased his all-round abilities by leading the NBA in triple-doubles (10). He also won a gold medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta as a member of the U.S. men&#x27;s basketball team, where he had the team&#x27;s fifth-highest scoring average (9.7) and led the team in steals (18). In 1996–97 season, Hill averaged 21.4 points, 9.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.8 steals per game. He became the first player since Larry Bird in 1989–90 to average 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists in a season, an accomplishment that had not been duplicated until Russell Westbrook averaged a triple-double in the 2016–17 NBA season. Once again, Hill led the league in triple-doubles, where his 13 triple-doubles represented 35 percent of the league&#x27;s triple-double total that season. He was the league&#x27;s Player of the Month for January and was also awarded NBA&#x27;s IBM Award, given to the player with the biggest statistical contributions to his team. He finished third in MVP voting, behind Karl Malone and Michael Jordan.

Much like Scottie Pippen with the Bulls, Hill assumed the role of a &quot;point forward&quot; in Detroit, running the Pistons&#x27; offense. As a result, between the 1995–96 and 1998–99 NBA seasons, Hill was the league leader in assists per game among non-guards all four seasons. In the lockout-shortened 1999 season, as he led his team in points, rebounds and assists for the third time, Hill joined Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor as the only players in NBA history at the time to lead their teams in scoring, rebounding and assists more than once. Hill and Chamberlain were the only two players in league history to lead their teams in points, rebounds, and assists per game three times. Hill was selected to play in the 1998 FIBA World Championship, but in the end, no NBA players played in this tournament due to the lockout.

In the 1999–2000 season, Hill averaged 25.8 points while shooting 49% from the field, the season&#x27;s third-highest scoring average, behind MVP Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Allen Iverson. He averaged 6.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game. However, despite Hill&#x27;s accomplishments in Detroit, the Pistons never made it far in the playoffs, either losing in the first round (1996, 1997 and 1999), or missing the playoffs entirely in the 1994–95 and 1997–98 seasons. The 2000 playoffs would be no different. On April 15, 2000, 7 days before the start of the playoffs, Hill sprained his left ankle in a game against the Philadelphia 76ers. He continued to play until the first-round playoff series against the Miami Heat, in which his injured ankle got worse, and Hill was forced to leave halfway through game 2. Eventually, the Heat swept the Pistons, 3–0. Hill was initially selected for the 2000 Olympics U.S. team, but could not play due to the ankle injury. That ankle injury would prove to be a major liability for many years to come.

After the first six seasons of his career, before the ankle injury, Hill had amassed a total of 9,393 points, 3,417 rebounds, and 2,720 assists. Oscar Robertson, Bird, Luka Doncic and LeBron James are the only four players in league history to eclipse these numbers after their first six seasons.

===Orlando Magic (2000–2007)===
As an unrestricted free agent, Hill had planned to sign with the Orlando Magic. On August 3, 2000, however, a sign-and-trade deal allowed Hill to receive a slightly more lucrative contract while Detroit received at least some compensation for losing him. The Pistons signed Hill to a seven-year, $92.8 million contract and traded him to Orlando for Chucky Atkins and Ben Wallace. The Magic hoped he would team up with budding superstar Tracy McGrady, who had been signed away from the Toronto Raptors at that time, to return Orlando among the NBA elite. But Hill was hampered by ankle injuries, playing in only four games in his first season with the Magic, 14 games in his second and 29 in his third. He was forced to sit out his &quot;entire&quot; fourth year with Orlando (2003–04). Despite missing so much time due to injury during his first seasons in Orlando, Hill still provided solid production when he was able to play, averaging 18.0 points, 8.8 rebounds, and 5.2 assists per 36 minutes during the 2002–03 NBA season. Meanwhile his former team, the Pistons, who had defeated the Magic in the 2003 playoffs, but ended up losing to the New Jersey Nets in the Eastern Conference Finals, won the championship the following year in 2004.

In March 2003, Hill underwent a major surgical procedure in which doctors re-fractured his ankle and realigned it with his leg bone. Five days after the surgery was performed, Hill developed a 104.5 °F (40.3 °C) fever and convulsions and was rushed to a hospital. Doctors removed the splint around his ankle and discovered that Hill had contracted a potentially fatal methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) infection. He was hospitalized for a week and had to take intravenous antibiotics for six months.

In the 2004–05 season Hill, though hampered by a bruised left shin that caused him to miss several games, started and played 67 games for the Magic. By then, the Magic had traded away McGrady for Steve Francis, another ball-dominant guard, in what was viewed as one of the biggest trades of the decade. Hill was named the Eastern Conference player of the week for the week between November 15–21, 2004. Over the season, Hill averaged 19.7 points per game on a .509 field goal percentage. Fans voted him an All-Star starter again, and he led the Eastern Conference All-Star Team to a victory over the West. Also, after the season, Hill was awarded the Joe Dumars Trophy presented to the NBA Sportsmanship Award Winner.

During the 2005–06 season Hill was once again injured frequently as nagging groin injuries kept him sidelined for much of the first half of the season, limiting him to 21 games. He got a sports hernia that was caused by uneven pressure on Hill&#x27;s feet while he was running, due to concerns that he could re-aggravate the injury on his left ankle if it got too much pressure. Hill underwent surgery for the hernia and stated that he would consider retirement if he had to get another surgery.

In the 2006–07 season Hill returned from injuries despite numerous rumors surrounding his retirement. Hill received ankle rotation therapy from specialists in Vancouver, British Columbia, during the off-season, and stated that he had regained much motion in his left ankle. Hill returned to the Magic lineup, starting at the shooting guard position. Despite having problems with injuries to his left knee and a tendon in his left ankle, Hill managed to play 65 games, two short of the highest number of games he played over a single season as a member of the Magic. He finished the season with averages of 14.4 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. This season would see Hill return to the playoffs for the first time since 2000, his first playoff appearance with the Magic. The 8th seed Magic would meet Hill&#x27;s old team, the Detroit Pistons, in the first round. The Pistons&#x27; vast playoff experience would prevail over the inexperienced Magic, who had not seen significant post-season action for some years, and despite having some close games, the series would end with a 4–0 Pistons sweep, leaving Hill undecided on whether to return for the 2007–08 season with the Magic, sign with another team or retire.

===Phoenix Suns (2007–2012)===

Hill became an unrestricted free agent on July 1, 2007. On July 5 Hill&#x27;s agent, Lon Babby, said Hill intended to sign with the Phoenix Suns on July 11 (the first day free agents can officially sign contracts). Hill earned $1.83 million for 2007–08 with a $1.97 million player option for the next year. Hill was named captain along with Steve Nash. Hill was permitted by Suns Ring of Honor member, Alvan Adams, to wear his familiar No. 33 with the Suns. Hill adapted well to the Suns&#x27; up-tempo style, averaging double figures in points as a key role player for Phoenix in the early months of the 2007–08 season. He played in the team&#x27;s first 34 games before an emergency appendectomy on January 9, 2008, sidelined him for two weeks. Despite being bothered by multiple injuries throughout the season, Hill had his first 70-game season since leaving Detroit, averaging 13.1 ppg, 5.0 rpg, and 2.9 apg in the process.

Playing for the Phoenix Suns in the 2008–2009 season, Hill appeared in all 82 games for the first time in his career and averaged 12.0 ppg, 4.90 rpg, and 2.3 apg, scoring 27 points and 10 rebounds in the Suns&#x27; season finale.

On July 10, 2009, the Associated Press reported that Hill decided to re-sign with the Phoenix Suns for a 2-year deal, despite an offer from the New York Knicks for the full mid-level exception and the Boston Celtics offering Hill the bi-annual exception. The first year of the contract is believed to be worth around $3 million with the second year at Hill&#x27;s option.

In 2010, the Phoenix Suns advanced to the Western Conference Semifinals, marking Hill&#x27;s first playoff series victory, and making him the first NBA player in history to win his first playoff series after 15 years in the league. After sweeping the San Antonio Spurs 4–0, the Suns then moved to the Western Conference Finals to face the Los Angeles Lakers, but lost in six games (4–2).

In 2010, he was chosen as the tenth-smartest athlete in sports by &quot;Sporting News&quot;.

On June 8 Hill exercised his option for the 2010–11 season. The Suns underwent two major roster changes in 2010–11. During the pre-season teammate Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire left for New York while Hedo Türkoğlu, Josh Childress and Hakim Warrick joined the Suns; within a year they also were traded for three other players. Hill became one of seven all-time NBA players to average 13 or more points at 38 years of age or older. On January 15, 2011, Hill passed the 16,000 career points milestone in a win over the Portland Trail Blazers.

On December 9, 2011, Hill decided to stay with the Phoenix Suns for one year, accepting a $6.5 million contract. By the end of the 2011–12 season, Hill had reached 17,000 career points, ending the season 78th on the all-time NBA scoring list (82nd NBA/ABA), 79th in career assists (83rd), and 66th in career steals (71st).

===Los Angeles Clippers (2012–2013)===

After his contract with the Suns expired, Hill was pursued by multiple contenders, including the Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, Portland Trail Blazers, and the Oklahoma City Thunder. On July 18, 2012, Hill signed a contract with the Clippers. Hill suffered a bruised bone in his right knee in the preseason which kept him out for three months. He then made his debut with the Clippers on January 12, 2013, against the Orlando Magic. During the 2012–13 season, he played only 29 games, averaging 3.2 ppg and 1.7 rpg in 15.1 mpg. The Clippers finished 56–26, fourth-best in the Western Conference, and won the Pacific Division for the first time in franchise history. However, the Clippers fell to the Memphis Grizzlies in a six-game series in the first round.

===Retirement===
On June 1, 2013, Hill announced his retirement from professional basketball after 19 seasons in the NBA.

<doc id="655426" wikidata="Q3118392" url="?curid=655426" title="Seattle General Strike">
<text>The Seattle General Strike was a five-day general work stoppage by 65,000 workers in the city of Seattle, Washington from February 6 to 11, 1919. The goal was to support shipyard workers in several unions who were locked out of their jobs when they tried to strike for higher wages. Most other local unions joined the walk-out, including members of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The national offices of the AFL unions were opposed to the shutdown. Local, state and federal government officials, the press, and much of the public viewed the strike as a radical attempt to subvert American institutions.

The strike&#x27;s demand for higher wages came within months of the end of World War I, the original justification for the wage controls. From 1915 to 1918, Seattle had seen a big increase in union membership, and some union leaders were inspired by the Russian Revolution of 1917. Some commentators blamed the strike on Bolsheviks and other radicals inspired by &quot;un-American&quot; ideologies, making it the first expression of the anti-left sentiment that characterized the Red Scare of 1919 and 1920.

==Background==
In these years, more workers in the city were organized in unions than ever before. There was a 400 percent increase in union membership from 1915 to 1918. At the time, workers in the United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, were becoming increasingly radicalized, with many in the rank and file supportive of the recent revolution in Russia and working toward a similar revolution in the United States. In the fall of 1919, for instance, Seattle longshoremen refused to load arms destined for the anti-Bolshevik White Army in Russia and attacked those who attempted to load them.

The arrival of the Russian steamship &quot;Shilka&quot; in Seattle on December 24, 1917 added to the thought of Bolshevik involvement. The ship had been damaged and thrown off course in a storm and limped its way into the port almost out of fuel, food and fresh water. The U.S. Attorney in Seattle was tipped off by an &quot;informant&quot; that the ship was coming and it was going to &quot;aid the enemy.&quot; The enemy at this time would have been the labor parties threatening a strike. Many believed that its arrival signified a Bolshevik connection with the labor unrest in Seattle. A lot of rumors came about because of this ship&#x27;s arrival. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer ran a front-page article about an I.W.W. ship being held that contained over a hundred thousand dollars to help I.W.W. members get out of jail. This article proved to be false as the search of the vessel by local law enforcement turned up nothing of significance. A first-hand account of a sailor aboard the ship claimed that there was no evidence found on board because the only contentious material was some flyers in a briefcase that were carried off of the ship upon its arrival. Another passenger that arrived with the ship was arrested for taking part in labor talks with one of the unions in the area. Although there was never any concrete evidence connecting the &quot;Shilka&quot; to the labor parties of Seattle, there was enough to show that the labor parties at the least had the support of Bolshevik Russia. There was a lot of fear of the Bolsheviks because it was known that they had been hoping for a revolution in the Western world in order to support Russia by pooling resources.

Most unions in Seattle were officially affiliated with the AFL, but the ideas of ordinary workers tended to be more radical than their leaders. A local labor leader from the time discussed the politics of Seattle&#x27;s workers in June 1919:

I believe that 95 percent of us agree that the workers should control the industries. Nearly all of us agree on that but very strenuously disagree on the method. Some of us think we can get control through the Cooperative movement, some of us think through political action, and others think through industrial action.

Another journalist described the spread of propaganda relating to the Russian Revolution:

For some time these pamphlets were seen by hundreds on Seattle&#x27;s streetcars and ferries, read by men of the shipyards on their way to work. Seattle&#x27;s businessmen commented on the phenomenon sourly; it was plain to everyone that these workers were conscientiously and energetically studying how to organize their coming to power. Already, workers in Seattle talked about &quot;workers&#x27; power&quot; as a practical policy for the not far distant future.
==Strike==

A few weeks after the November 1918 armistice ended World War I, unions in Seattle&#x27;s shipbuilding industry demanded a pay increase for unskilled workers. They formed the Seattle Metal Trades Council, made up of delegates from twenty-one different craft unions; there were seventeen at the time of the first strike vote. At the time of the General Strike, these separate unions no longer made separate agreements with the yard-owners; a single blanket-agreement was made at intervals by the Metal Trades Council for all the crafts comprising it. In August 1917, the workers had succeeded in establishing a uniform wage scale for one third of the metal tradesmen working in the city. At the time of the general strike, James Taylor was president of the Council.

In an attempt to divide the ranks of the union, the yard owners responded by offering a pay increase only to skilled workers. The union rejected that offer and Seattle&#x27;s 35,000 shipyard workers went on strike on January 21, 1919.

Controversy erupted when Charles Piez, head of the Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFC), an enterprise created by the federal government as a wartime measure and the largest employer in the industry, sent a telegram to the yard owners threatening to withdraw their contracts if any increase in wages were granted. The message intended for the Metal Trades Association, the owners, was accidentally delivered to the Metal Trades Council, the union. The shipyard workers responded with anger directed at both their employers and the federal government which, through the EFC, seemed to be siding with corporate interests.

The workers immediately appealed to the Seattle Central Labor Council for a general strike of all workers in Seattle. Members of various unions were polled, with almost unanimous support in favor–even among traditionally conservative unions. As many as 110 locals officially supported the call for a general strike to begin on February 6, 1919, at 10:00 am. Among the strikers were war veterans who wore their uniforms as they went on strike.

==Life during the strike==
A cooperative body made up of rank and file workers from all the striking locals were formed during the strike, called the General Strike Committee. It acted as a &quot;virtual counter-government for the city.&quot; The committee organized to provide essential services for the people of Seattle during the work stoppage. For instance, garbage that would create a health hazard was collected, laundry workers continued to handle hospital laundry, and firemen remained on duty. Exemptions to the stoppage of labor had to be passed by the Strike Committee, and authorized vehicles bore signs to that effect. In general, work was not halted if doing so would endanger lives.

In other cases, workers acted on their own initiative to create new institutions. Milk wagon drivers, after being denied the right by their employers to keep certain dairies open, established a distribution system of 35 neighborhood milk stations. A system of food distribution was also established, which throughout the strike committee distributed as many as 30,000 meals each day. Strikers paid twenty-five cents per meal, and the general public paid thirty-five cents. Beef stew, spaghetti, bread, and coffee were offered on an all-you-can-eat basis. 

Army veterans created an alternative to the police in order to maintain order. A group called the &quot;Labor War Veteran&#x27;s Guard&quot; forbade the use of force and did not carry weapons, and used &quot;persuasion only.&quot; Peacekeeping proved unnecessary. The regular police forces made no arrests in actions related to the strike, and general arrests dropped to less than half their normal number. Major General John F. Morrison, stationed in Seattle, claimed that he had never seen &quot;a city so quiet and orderly.&quot; The methods of organization adopted by the striking workers bore resemblance to anarcho-syndicalism, perhaps reflecting the influence of the Industrial Workers of the World in the Pacific Northwest, though only a few striking locals were officially affiliated with the IWW.

==Radical visions==

Revolutionary pamphlets littered the streets of the city. One called &quot;Russia Did It&quot; proclaimed: &quot;The Russians have shown you the way out. What are you going to do about it? You are doomed to wage slavery till you die unless you wake up, realize that you and the boss have nothing in common, that the employing class must be overthrown, and that you, the workers, must take over the control of your jobs, and through them, the control over your lives instead of offering yourself up to the masters as a sacrifice six days a week, so that they may coin profits out of your sweat and toil.&quot;

In an editorial in the &quot;Seattle Union Record&quot;, a union newspaper, pro-Soviet activist Anna Louise Strong, although not a union member tried to use the general strike&#x27;s power and potential to have the workers seize the industries of Seattle:

Newspapers across the country reprinted excerpts from Strong&#x27;s editorial.

==End of the general strike==

Three simultaneous movements brought the strike to an end: Mayor Ole Hanson increased the police and military forces available to enforce order, though there was no disorder, and possibly to take the place of striking workers. Union officials, especially those more senior and those at higher levels of the labor movement, feared that using the general strike as a tactic would fail and set back their organizing efforts. Union members, perhaps seeing the strength of the forces arrayed against them, perhaps mindful of their union leaders concerns began to go back to work. The General Strike Committee attributed the end of the strike to pressure from international union officers and the difficulty of continuing to live in the shut-down city.

Mayor Hanson had federal troops available and stationed 950 sailors and marines across the city by February 7. He added 600 men to the police force and hired 2,400 special deputies, students from the University of Washington for the most part. On February 7, Mayor Hanson threatened to use 1,500 police and 1,500 troops to replace striking workers the next day, but the strikers assumed this was an empty threat and were proved correct. The Mayor continued his rhetorical attack on February 9, saying that the &quot;sympathetic strike was called in the exact manner as was the revolution in Petrograd.&quot; Mayor Hanson told reporters that &quot;any man who attempts to take over the control of the municipal government functions will be shot.&quot;

The international offices of some of the unions and the national leadership of the AFL began to exert pressure on the General Strike Committee and individual unions to end the strike. Some locals gave in to this pressure and returned to work. The executive committee of the General Strike Committee, pressured by the AFL and international labor organizations, proposed ending the general strike at midnight on February 8, but their recommendation was voted down by the General Strike Committee. On February 8, some streetcar operators returned to work and restored some critical city transportation services. Seattle&#x27;s main department store reopened as well. Then teamsters and newsboys returned to work. On February 10, the General Strike Committee voted to end the general strike on February 11 and by noon on that day it was over. It stated its reasons: &quot;Pressure from international officers of unions, from executive committees of unions, from the &#x27;leaders&#x27; in the labor movement, even from those very leaders who are still called &#x27;Bolsheviki&#x27; by the undiscriminating press. And, added to all these, the pressure upon the workers themselves, not of the loss of their own jobs, but of living in a city so tightly closed.&quot;

The city had been effectively paralyzed for five days, but the general strike collapsed as labor reconsidered its effectiveness under pressure from senior labor leaders and their own obvious failure to match the Mayor&#x27;s propaganda in the war for public opinion. The shipyard strike, in support of which the general strike had been called, persisted.

==Aftermath==
Immediately following the general strike&#x27;s end, thirty-nine IWW members were arrested as &quot;ringleaders of anarchy&quot;.

Seattle Mayor Ole Hanson took credit for ending the strike and was hailed by some of the press. He resigned a few months later and toured the country giving lectures on the dangers of &quot;domestic Bolshevism.&quot; He earned $38,000 in seven months, five times his annual salary as mayor. He agreed that the general strike was a revolutionary event. In his view, the fact that it was peaceful proved its revolutionary nature and intent. He wrote:

The so-called sympathetic Seattle strike was an attempted revolution. That there was no violence does not alter the fact... The intent, openly and covertly announced, was for the overthrow of the industrial system; here first, then everywhere... True, there were no flashing guns, no bombs, no killings. Revolution, I repeat, doesn&#x27;t need violence. The general strike, as practised in Seattle, is of itself the weapon of revolution, all the more dangerous because quiet. To succeed, it must suspend everything; stop the entire life stream of a community... That is to say, it puts the government out of operation. And that is all there is to revolt—no matter how achieved.

Between the strike&#x27;s announcement and beginning, on February 4, the U.S. Senate voted to expand the work of its Overman Judiciary Subcommittee from investigating German spies to Bolshevik propaganda. The Committee launched a month of hearings on February 11, the day the strike collapsed. Its sensational report detailed Bolshevik atrocities and the threat of domestic agitators bent on revolution and the abolition of private property. The labor radicalism represented by the Seattle General Strike fit neatly into its conception of the threat American institutions faced.

<doc id="655444" wikidata="Q1105898" url="?curid=655444" title="Satish Kumar">
<text>Satish Kumar (born 9 August 1936) is an Indian British activist and speaker. He has been a Jain monk, nuclear disarmament advocate and pacifist.&quot; &quot;Now living in England, Kumar is founder and Director of Programmes of the Schumacher College international center for ecological studies, and is Editor Emeritus of &quot;Resurgence &amp; Ecologist&quot; magazine. His most notable accomplishment is the completion, together with a companion, E. P. Menon, of a peace walk of over 8,000 miles in June 1962 for two and a half years, from New Delhi to Moscow, Paris, London, and Washington, D.C., the capitals of the world&#x27;s earliest nuclear-armed countries. He insists that reverence for nature should be at the heart of every political and social debate.

Defending criticism that his goals are unrealistic, he has said,

== Early life ==
Kumar was born in Sri Dungargarh, Rajasthan, India. At the age of 9, he left his family and became a Jain monk. At 18, after reading a book by Mahatma Gandhi, he ran away from the mendicant order, to become a student of Vinoba Bhave, an eminent disciple of Gandhi and his nonviolence and land reform ideas.

== Peace walk ==
Inspired by Bertrand Russell&#x27;s civil disobedience against the atomic bomb, in June 1962 Kumar and his friend E. P. Menon decided to dedicate themselves to undertaking a peace walk from India to the four capitals of the nuclear world, Moscow, Paris, London, and Washington D.C., and decided to carry no money on their trip. They called it a &#x27;Pilgrimage for peace&#x27; and it took two and a half years.

Bhave gave the young men two &#x27;gifts&#x27;. One was to be penniless wherever they walked. The other was to be vegetarian. They first travelled through Pakistan, where they met great kindness from a country with a huge historic conflict and antipathy towards India. Leaving Pakistan via the Khyber Pass, they continued through Afghanistan, Iran, Armenia, Georgia, and the Caucasus Mountains, reaching Moscow, then Paris, London, and Washington, D.C. Travelling on foot and carrying no money, Kumar and his companion would stay with anyone who offered them food or shelter.

While on their way to Moscow they met two women outside a tea factory. After explaining what they were doing one of the women gave them four packets of tea, one to be delivered to each of the leaders of the four nuclear powers and to also deliver a message, &quot;when you think you need to press the button, stop for a minute and have a fresh cup of tea&quot;. This further inspired their journey and became in part the reason for it. They eventually delivered &#x27;peace tea&#x27; to the leaders of four of the nuclear powers. The journey is chronicled in Kumar&#x27;s book &quot;No Destination: Autobiography of a Pilgrim&quot;.

== Professional career ==

=== Editor ===
Between 1973 and 2016, Kumar was editor of &quot;Resurgence &amp; Ecologist&quot; (combining the former &quot;Resurgence&quot; magazine, which had been described as the artistic and spiritual flagship of the green movement, with &quot;The Ecologist&quot;). He contributed an essay to &quot;The Society for Curious Thought&quot; entitled &quot;Focus on Food&quot;. He has also been a contributor to the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Thought for the Day&quot; strand on the &quot;Today&quot; programme, and also appeared on Desert Island Discs. Kumar was interviewed by Richard Dawkins in his &#x27;Slaves to Superstition&#x27; episode of the documentary &quot;The Enemies of Reason&quot;, investigating the prevalence of unscientific beliefs in modern society. He also made a film, &quot;Earth Pilgrim&quot;, for BBC2&#x27;s Natural History Series.

=== &quot;We Are One&quot; ===
Kumar was one of the contributors to the book, &quot;We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples&quot;, released in October 2009. The book explores the culture of peoples around the world, portraying both its diversity and the threats it faces. It contains a collection of statements from tribal people, photographs, and essays from international authors, campaigners, politicians, philosophers, poets, artists, journalists, anthropologists, environmentalists and photojournalists. The royalties from the sale of this book go to the indigenous rights organization, Survival International.

== Family life ==
Satish Kumar is the father of two children, a girl and a boy, by his wife in India.
Kumar, a recipient of the Jamnalal Bajaj International Award, settled in England in 1973. He lives a simple life in Hartland, Devon, with his partner June Mitchell and their two children.

== Politics ==

Prior to the 2015 UK general election, he was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party&#x27;s Caroline Lucas.

<text>The Dene people () are an Indigenous group of First Nations who inhabit the northern boreal, subarctic and Arctic regions of Canada. The Dene speak Northern Athabaskan languages and it is the common Athabaskan word for &quot;people&quot;. The term &quot;Dene&quot; has two uses:

* Most commonly, &quot;Dene&quot; is used narrowly to refer to the Athabaskan speakers of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut in Canada who form the Dene Nation: the Chipewyan (Denesuline), Tłı̨chǫ (&quot;Dogrib&quot;), Yellowknives (T&#x27;atsaot&#x27;ine), Slavey (Deh Gah Got&#x27;ine or Deh Cho), Sahtu (Sahtúot’ine), and Gwichʼin (Dinjii Zhuh).

* &quot;Dene&quot; is sometimes also used to refer to all Northern Athabaskan speakers, who are spread in a wide range all across Alaska and northern Canada.
* The Dene people are known for their oral storytelling. 

== Location ==
Dene are spread through a wide region. They live in the Mackenzie Valley (south of the Inuvialuit), and can be found west of Nunavut. Their homeland reaches to western Yukon, and the northern part of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Alaska and the southwestern United States.
Dene were the first people to settle in what is now the Northwest Territories. In northern Canada, historically there were ethnic feuds between the Dene and the Inuit. In 1996, Dene and Inuit representatives participated in a healing ceremony at Bloody Falls to reconcile the centuries-old grievances.

Behchokǫ̀, Northwest Territories is the largest Dene community in Canada.

== Ethnography ==

The Dene include six main groups:
*Chipewyan (Denesuline), living east of Great Slave Lake, and including the Sayisi Dene living at Tadoule Lake, Manitoba.
*Tłı̨chǫ (Dogrib), living between Great Slave and Great Bear Lakes.
*Yellowknives (T&#x27;atsaot&#x27;ine), living north of Great Slave Lake.
*Slavey (Deh Gah Got&#x27;ine or Deh Cho), living southwest of Great Slave Lake and into Alberta and British Columbia.
*Sahtu (Sahtúot’ine), including the Locheux, Nahanni, and Bear Lake peoples, living along the Mackenzie River (Deh Cho) near Great Bear Lake.
*Gwichʼin (Dinjii Zhuh), in the Gwich&#x27;in Settlement Region.

Although the above-named groups are what the term &quot;Dene&quot; usually refers to in modern usage, other groups who consider themselves Dene include:
* Tsuutʼina (Tsuu T&#x27;ina), a.k.a. the Sarcee, currently located near Calgary, Alberta.
* The Dane-zaa (Danezaa, Dunne-za, or Tsattine) of northeastern British Columbia and neighbouring regions of northwestern Alberta.
* The Tahltan, Kaska Dena, and Sekani peoples of the northern area of the British Columbia Interior. Another group in this region, the Tsetsaut, lived in the Portland Canal area of the northernmost BC Coast near the border with Alaska. They are now extinct.
* The Dakelh (Carrier) peoples of the northern and central British Columbia Interior, and the Wetʼsuwetʼen, a Dakelh branch
* The Tsilhqotʼin peoples of the eponymous Chilcotin Country of the central British Columbia Interior
* The extinct Nicola Athapaskans, or Stuwix (&quot;strangers&quot; in the Shuswap language), migrated south from northern BC into the Nicola Valley region in the late 18th century and were absorbed into the Nicola people, an alliance of Nlaka&#x27;pamux and Syilx (Okanagan peoples).
* The Tanana Athabaskans and other peoples of Yukon and Alaska are also considered to be Dene, which is to say part of the family of Athapaskan-speaking peoples.

In 2005, elders from the Dene People decided to join the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) seeking recognition for their ancestral cultural and land rights.

The largest population of Chipewyan language (Dënesųłinë́ or Dëne) speakers live in the northern Saskatchewan village of 
and the adjoining Clearwater River Dene Nation. In 2011 the combined population was 3389 people. The Dënesųłinë́ language is spoken by 89% of the residents.

== Notable Dene ==

<text>North Rocks is a suburb straddling the Hills District and the North Shore of Parramatta within Greater Western Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia, located north-west of the Sydney central business district. Following the amalgamation of council areas in 2016, the majority of North Rocks falls into the council area of the City of Parramatta. Streets north of the M2 Hills Motorway are within The Hills Shire.

==History==
The name &quot;North Rocks&quot; dates back to the beginning of the settlement at Parramatta and is older even than the name of the city itself, which at first was called Rosehill. In 1789 Governor Phillip reserved large areas to the north and west of Rosehill for the use of Government stock - the present Northmead and Westmead. The reserve to the north was described as extending as far as &#x27;the North Rocks&#x27;. The area was also known as Jerusalem Rocks.

North Rocks (Hunts and Darling Mills Creeks) was originally occupied by the Burramattagal clan (burra - eels and fish, matta – place of fresh running water) who were part of the Darug nation.

North Rocks was once considered as the haunt of convict bolters and bushrangers and regarded as an unsavoury area. One noted incident was the hold-up of Dr Sherwin in 1830 by John Macnamara and William Dalton, which resulted in the ex-convicts&#x27; demise. 
The North Rocks were a massive sandstone outcrop, which terminated the ridge on the south side of Hunts Creek. These rocks so dominated the landscape and were such prominent features that they gave their name to the locality but were not preserved. In 1841 when it was decided to build a new gaol at Parramatta, a contractor bought the Rocks as they consisted of the best sandstone in the district - and were very conveniently situated. His tender was accepted, and much of the North Rocks became gaol walls and flagstones in 1844. Further inroads were made on what was left when the wall of masonry was erected in 1855-56 which held back the waters of Lake Parramatta. Much stone was needed for the dam, as the wall is about long and is fifteen feet thick at the base.

A &quot;North Rocks&quot; Post Office first opened on 1 February 1894; it was renamed &quot;Forrester&quot; later that year, &quot;Maraylya&quot; in 1921 and closed in 1970. The current Post Office opened on 1 November 1921.

Prior to North Rocks being rezoned around 1958, it housed around 40 farms, including peach and nectarine orchards, poultry farms and piggeries. When the area was rezoned, one of many new housing estates was named Lynwood Estate.

North Rocks came to public attention on 21 July 2023, when a wild car chase lasting almost an hour came to an end as a Hyundai Sonata displaying Queensland number plates crashed into a set of traffic lights. One driver and a passenger were soon taken into custody by police officers.

==Commercial area==
North Rocks Shopping Centre and the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children school are located around North Rocks Road. The shopping centre was constructed during the 1970s and features a Coles Supermarket and Kmart discount department store and more than 70 speciality shops. It was a Westfield Group operation until 2015, when it was sold to Challenger for $127 million. A small group of shops is also located on the opposite side, around the intersection of North Rocks Road and Lawndale Avenue.

North Rocks Markets, a trash and treasure market, is run every Sunday by the local Rotary Club by gold coin donation at the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children. The market incorporates a variety of stalls covering new and second-hand items, food, and a computer market and has operated at various locations in the area over 20 years.

There is a light industrial area towards North Parramatta in the area around Loyalty Road, which includes industrial businesses such as Unilever, Rexona and Officeworks and many other businesses in various industrial estates.

==Transport==

At the 2016 census, only 16.8% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 69.1% by car (either as a driver or as a passenger).

The M2 Hills Motorway runs through North Rocks, and there is access to the motorway from Barclay Road in North Rocks, Pennant Hills Road in Carlingford and Windsor Road in Baulkham Hills. Public transport to, from and throughout the area is provided by bus.

===Train===

North Rocks does not have a railway station. However, train services are accessible from nearby Epping, Castle Hill and Parramatta railway stations.

===Bus===
The Barclay Road M2 Bus Station provides services to the City and Castle Hill as well as services to Macquarie Park, Blacktown and Norwest Business Park. The Barclay Road M2 bus to the city takes 22 minutes. Sydney Buses provides links from Parramatta railway station to Epping railway station through different parts of North Rocks, although both converge at North Rocks Shopping Centre. There are also very limited services to Beecroft railway station.

==Schools==
===Public===
* North Rocks Public School (which has an Opportunity Class);
*Burnside Public School;
* Muirfield High School is a comparatively small high school with around 850 students. A defining feature of the school is its agricultural program run out of the Barclay farm. Muirfield has run an agricultural display at the Castle Hill Show since 1992. In 2006 the school won the award for &quot;Best School Display&quot;. Issues arising from drought resulted in the School withdrawing from the show in 2007. In 2010 Muirfield High School was invited to participate in the first Sydney Royal Easter Show Schools Fruit and Vegetable Display, where the school was awarded 2nd place.

North Rocks also boasts Muirfield Golf Club, a picturesque and parkland style 18-hole Golf Course and club facilities on Barclay Road. There are also local softball, soccer, rugby clubs and the Murri-Yanna Track in Bidjigal Reserve which can be accessed from Whitbread Place. North Rocks was also the host to the 1976 Skateboard Winter Olympics.

==Parks and reserves==
North Rocks features a number of parks and reserves, such as Hunts Creek Reserve, which features Balaka Falls, a scenic waterfall. Bidjigal Reserve, which includes a towering eucalypt forest, weathered sandstone cliffs, sparkling creeks and sheltered rainforest gullies, surrounds the north and west periphery of the North Rocks border. Fauna includes koala, swamp wallaby, echidna, sugar gliders and eastern water dragon. Platypus were regularly seen up until the installation of the sewer in the mid-1970s, but none since. The diversity of birds is well known in Bidjigal Reserve with 127 species being documented. Rare insectivorous species such as wrens and thornbills have been recorded and the more common species of kookaburras and crimson rosellas seem to be doing well. In recent years, there has also been an increase in numbers of sulphur-crested cockatoos and rainbow lorikeets. The powerful owl, Australia&#x27;s largest owl also breeds in the reserve and can be heard hooting throughout North Rocks at night. Many of these bird species can be seen throughout North Rocks.

<text>Peter Killian Gallagher (born August 19, 1955) is an American actor. Since 1980, he has played roles in numerous Hollywood films. He is best known for starring as Sandy Cohen in the television drama series &quot;The O.C.&quot; from 2003 to 2007, and recurring roles in television such as Deputy Chief William Dodds on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit, &quot; Stacey Koons on the Showtime comedy-drama &quot;Californication&quot;, Nick on the Netflix series &quot;Grace &amp; Frankie&quot;, and Director of Clandestine Services (DCS) Arthur Campbell on &quot;Covert Affairs&quot;. He also is known for his roles in the films &quot;Bob Roberts&quot; (1992), &quot;The Player&quot; (1992), &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (1993), &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999), &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; (2002), and &quot;Palm Springs&quot; (2020). In musical theatre, his best-known role is that of Sky Masterson in the 1992 Broadway revival of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;.

== Early life ==
Gallagher was born in New York City. His mother, Mary Ann (née O&#x27;Shea), was a bacteriologist, and his father, Thomas Francis Gallagher, Jr., was an advertising executive. Gallagher is the youngest of their three children. He is of Irish Catholic background and was raised in Armonk, New York. Gallagher graduated from Tufts University, where he was active in theater, appearing in such shows as Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Company&quot; and singing with the all-male &quot;a cappella&quot; group the Beelzebubs. He studied acting at the William Esper Studio and with Mira Rostova.

== Career ==
Gallagher appeared on Broadway with Glenn Close in Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;The Real Thing&quot; and made his feature film debut in the Taylor Hackford film &quot;The Idolmaker&quot;, but first achieved fame for his role in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;sex, lies, and videotape&quot; (1989). He also starred as Sky Masterson in the 1992 Broadway hit revival of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;.

Gallagher played a potential career threat to Tim Robbins&#x27;s studio executive in &quot;The Player&quot; (1992); the comatose fiancé of Sandra Bullock in &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot; (1995); a major real estate salesman having an affair with Annette Bening in &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999); a media executive in &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; (2002); and a political reporter exposing media ethics during a presidential debate in &quot;The Last Debate&quot;.

From 2003 to 2007, Gallagher starred as Sandy Cohen, a Jewish public defender and corporate lawyer, on the Fox television show &quot;The O.C.&quot; He hosts an annual award ceremony named &quot;The Sandy Cohen Awards&quot; or &quot;The Sandys&quot;, which, in honor of his character on &quot;The O.C.&quot;, gives a scholarship to a law school student at UC Berkeley who wants to become a public defender.

Gallagher released an album titled &quot;7 Days in Memphis&quot; in 2005, on the Sony BMG label. This includes a studio recording of his performance of &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up On Me&quot; (originally by Solomon Burke), which was featured in an episode of &quot;The O.C.&quot; He also has a video for his single &quot;Still I Long For Your Kiss&quot;, in which he starred with his TV-wife Kelly Rowan.

In 2005, Gallagher received the P.T. Barnum Award from Tufts University for his exceptional work in the field of media and entertainment. In 2007, Gallagher received the &quot;Light on the Hill&quot; award at Tufts University. The award is given to notable alumni from Tufts who have demonstrated ambition, achievement, and active citizenship.

From February 13 through July 5, 2015, Gallagher starred on Broadway in &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot; although he missed several performances in late February due to illness.

In 2020 Gallagher played Mitch Clarke, who had progressive supranuclear palsy, in a regular role in the first season of &quot;Zoey&#x27;s Extraordinary Playlist&quot;. Though his character died in the season 1 finale, Gallagher appeared in several episodes of the second season and the Christmas special &quot;Zoey&#x27;s Extraordinary Christmas&quot;.

In 2021, Gallagher took part in the television series &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; as Dr. David Hamilton.

From 2018 through 2022, Gallagher appeared in four seasons of the Netflix series &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot; as Nick, the boyfriend of Jane Fonda&#x27;s character Grace.

In 2024, Gallagher is set to return to Broadway, in a new play based on the life of Delia Ephron, titled &quot;Left on Tenth&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Gallagher is married to Paula Harwood and has two children, James and Kathryn. His daughter Kathryn is an actress and singer.

<text>The Sahtú or [[Slavey|North Slavey]] (historically called &quot;Hare&quot; or &quot;Hareskin Indians&quot;) are a Dene First Nations people of the Athabaskan-speaking ethnolinguistic group living in the vicinity of Great Bear Lake (&quot;Sahtú&quot;, the source of their name), Northwest Territories, Canada. The Sahtú peoples live in Colville Lake, Deline, Fort Good Hope, Norman Wells and Tulita which form the Sahtu Region of the NWT. The Dene of the region are represented by the Sahtu Dene Council who, in 1993, signed the Sahtu Dene and Metis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement. Sahtú groups include the &quot;Hare Dene&quot; (K&#x27;ahsho Got&#x27;ine District, today: Colville Lake and Fort Good Hope), &quot;Bear Lake Dene&quot; (Déline District), and &quot;Mountain Dene&quot; (Tulit&#x27;a District). They call themselves also &quot;Ɂehdzo Got’ı̨ne&quot; (Trap People).

==Ethnography==
An early description of Sahtú cultures is given in Alexander Mackenzie&#x27;s journal of his voyage down the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean in 1789.

Although there are close interrelationships among the Dene communities, they are culturally and linguistically distinct. The &quot;K’ahsho Got’ine (Hare(skin) Dene)&quot; are now centred in Fort Good Hope and Colville Lake. The &quot;Shita Got’ine (Mountain Dene)&quot; have joined with the &quot;K’áálǫ Got’ine (Willow Lake Dene)&quot; (they lived around K’áálô Tué – ″Willow Lake″, today known as Brackett Lake) in the community of Tulit’a. The &quot;Sahtúot’ine (Sahtú Dene or Great Bear Lake Dene)&quot; are named after Sahtú/Great Bear Lake, and are based in Deline. Métis people, descendants of relationships established between Dene people and fur traders, reside in all five communities of the region. The Hareskin Dene called themselves &quot;K&#x27;a so Got’ine/Katoo Got’ine&quot; (&quot;big willow people&quot;) or &quot;K’ahsho Got’ine/K&#x27;áshot’ Got’ine&quot; (″big-arrowhead-people″, mistranslated as Hareskin people, an English rendering of &quot;Gahwié Got’ine&quot; – ″Rabbit(skin) People″).

The Déline community of the Sahtú Dene experienced great loss during Canada&#x27;s participation in the Manhattan Project. The need for radioactive materials, (such as radium), to create atomic weapons was met with the deposits mined from the Eldorado Mine at Port Radium on Great Bear Lake. The Sahtú Dene were hired to transport the ore containing radium from the Northwest Territories to be processed in Ontario or the United States. Since much of the uranium that existed in Europe was under Nazi control, the radium deposits in Canada were vital to the creation of the first atomic bombs. Unaware of the radiation&#x27;s effects, the Sahtú Dene used cloth sacks to transport the ore.

The number of deaths caused by radiation is disputed by the Government of Canada. The government report says that the people of Deline did not handle yellowcake but sulfur powder. The level of exposure to uranium ore without modern safety standards is expected to cause a small number of excess cancer deaths. 

Ultimately, the devastating effects of radiation poisoning impacted the Déline community severely. A 1999 documentary by Peter Blow entitled &quot;Village of Widows&quot; detailed the experiences of the Sahtú Dene.

== Today&#x27;s Sahtu Dene First Nations ==
Sahtu Dene Council
* Behdzi Ahda&#x27; First Nation (headquartered in Colville Lake (&quot;K&#x27;áhbamį́túé&quot; – ″ptarmigan net place″), ancestral homeland of the &quot;K&#x27;ahsho Got&#x27;ine (Hare(skin) Dene)&quot;, the surrounding area is still inhabited by them, reserve: Colville Lake Settlement, Population: 219)
* Délı̨nę First Nation (Deline (&quot;Délınę&quot;) – ″Where the Water Flows&quot;, pronounced ′day-li-neh′, located near the headwaters of the Bear River (&quot;Sahtu De&quot;), where it rushes out of Great Bear Lake to the Mackenzie River, a place nearby where the lake seldom freezes over was a fishing place for the &quot;Sahtúot’ine/Sahtugotine (Bear Lake Dene)&quot;, reserve: Fort Franklin Settlement, Population: 981, Sahtú Dene families are often related to &quot;K&#x27;ahsho Got&#x27;ine (Hare(skin Dene)&quot;, Gwich’in and &quot;Shita Got&#x27;ine (Mountain Dene)&quot; peoples. The people of Great Bear Lake had to be hardy and resourceful to survive in the past. Within living memory, they lived a nomadic life, following fish and game with the seasons. Many still supplement their diets by hunting, fishing and trapping at least part of the time. Homes often feature a traditional lodge or tipi used to smoke meat and fish. In contrast, many of these same homes today are equipped with satellite dishes to pull in North American television.)
* Fort Good Hope First Nation (also known as &quot;K’asho Gotine Dene Band&quot; or&quot;K’asho Go’tine Community Council&quot;), headquartered in Fort Good Hope (or the Charter Community of K&#x27;asho Got&#x27;ine), called &quot;Rádeyîlîkóé&quot; – &quot;Where the Rapids Are&quot; by the local &quot;K&#x27;ahsho Got&#x27;ine (Hare(skin) Dene)&quot;, is located on a peninsula between Jackfish Creek and the east bank of the Mackenzie River, about 145 km (90 mi) northwest of Norman Wells, reserve: Fort Good Hope Settlement, Population: 869)
* Tulita Dene First Nation (&quot;Tulita Band Council&quot;, also known as &quot;Begade Shotagotine First Nation&quot;, headquartered in Tulit&#x27;a – &quot;Where the two Rivers Meet&quot;, which was formerly known as Fort Norman, reserve: Fort Norman Settlement, Population: 670) – they are as &quot;Begade Shotagotine (eng)&quot;, &quot;Begaa Deh Shuh Tah Got’ie (North Slavey)&quot; or as &quot;Begaee Shuhagot&#x27;ine (South Slavey variety)&quot; also members of the Dehcho First Nations of the South Slavey

==Language==
Sahtú speak the North Slavey language, which belongs to northwestern Canada group of Northern Athabaskan languages.

==Notable Sahtu people==

<text>The EICAR Anti-Virus Test File or EICAR test file is a computer file that was developed by the European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research (EICAR) and Computer Antivirus Research Organization to test the response of computer antivirus programs. Instead of using real malware, which could cause real damage, this test file allows people to test anti-virus software without having to use a real computer virus.

Anti-virus programmers set the EICAR string as a verified virus, similar to other identified signatures. A compliant virus scanner, when detecting the file, will respond in more or less the same manner as if it found a harmful virus. Not all virus scanners are compliant, and may not detect the file even when they are correctly configured. Neither the way in which the file is detected nor the wording with which it is flagged are standardized, and may differ from the way in which real malware is flagged, but should prevent it from executing as long as it meets the strict specification set by EICAR.

The use of the EICAR test string can be more versatile than straightforward detection: a file containing the EICAR test string can be compressed or archived, and then the antivirus software can be run to see whether it can detect the test string in the compressed file. Many of the AMTSO Feature Settings Checks are based on the EICAR test string.

== Design ==
The file is a text file of between 68 and 128 bytes that is a legitimate .com executable file (plain x86 machine code) that can be run by MS-DOS, some work-alikes, and its successors OS/2 and Windows (except for 64-bit due to 16-bit limitations). The EICAR test file will print &quot;EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!&quot; when executed and then will stop. The test string was written by noted anti-virus researchers Padgett Peterson and Paul Ducklin and engineered to consist of ASCII human-readable characters, easily created using a standard computer keyboard. It makes use of self-modifying code to work around technical issues that this constraint imposes on the execution of the test string.

The EICAR test string reads

The third character is the capital letter &#x27;O&#x27;, not the digit zero.

== Adoption ==
According to EICAR&#x27;s specification the antivirus detects the test file only if it starts with the 68-byte test string and is not more than 128 bytes long. As a result, antiviruses are not expected to raise an alarm on some other document containing the test string. The test file can still be used for some malicious purposes, exploiting the reaction from the antivirus software. For example, a race condition involving symlinks can cause antiviruses to delete themselves.

<doc id="655458" wikidata="Q2704796" url="?curid=655458" title="National Space Development Agency of Japan">
<text>The , or NASDA, was a Japanese national space agency established on October 1, 1969 under the National Space Development Agency Law only for peaceful purposes. Based on the Space Development Program enacted by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), NASDA was responsible for developing satellites and launch vehicles as well as launching and tracking them. 

The first launch vehicles of NASDA (N-I, N-II, and H-I) were partially based on licensed technology from the United States, particularly the Delta rocket family. The H-II was the first liquid fuel rocket to be fully developed in Japan.

Hideo Shima, chief engineer of the original Shinkansen &quot;bullet train&quot; project, served as Chief of NASDA from 1969 to 1977.

On October 1, 2003, NASDA merged with the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) and the National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan (NAL) into one Independent Administrative Institution: the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).

SL-J was partially funded by Japan through NASDA; this cooperative Japanese-American mission launched a NASDA astronaut into Earth orbit using the Space Shuttle in 1992.

Work on the Japanese Experiment Module at ISS, and also HOPE-X, was started under NASDA and inherited by JAXA.

<text>Carlingford () is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Carlingford is north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of City of Parramatta. Carlingford sits at the meeting point of Northern Sydney and Western Sydney sitting on both sides of Pennant Hills Road which generally acts as a divider of the two regions. While being part of City of Parramatta, it is sometimes referred to as being part of the Hills District.

==History==

===Aboriginal contact===
References to Aboriginal people in the Carlingford historical record in the 18th, 19th and into the 20th century remain limited to a handful of third-party observations, reinterpreted in modern day. There are many historical ambiguities and uncertainties around clan, language and cultural groups of the area.

The people of what is now known as Carlingford at the time of the arrival of the First Fleet at Port Jackson in 1788 were the Wallumedegal or Wallumattagai people. The people were observed to live in the area bounded approximately by the Parramatta River in the south, the Lane Cove River in the east, the Parramatta area in the west and ranged north for an uncertain distance. The Wallumedegal appear to have been of the Eora language group. The clan name seems to have been derived from &quot;wallumai&quot;, the snapper fish, combined with &quot;matta&quot;, a word used in association with &#x27;place&#x27; or sometimes &#x27;waterplace&#x27;.

Evidence of fire-stick burn off (whereby native vegetation is cleared through fire to create grasslands) along the northern banks of the Parramatta River were observed in February 1788 by an exploring boat party headed by Captain John Hunter and Lieutenant William Bradley in such places which became known as Kissing Point and Meadowbank. The grasslands created by the Aboriginals&#x27; burn off encouraged animals to graze and enhanced the ease of hunting and gathering. Around and above these pastures backing up into the Carlingford area were thick, tall stands of Blue Gum High Forest.

Aboriginal people in the Parramatta area began moving to new areas soon after the arrival of the colonists at Port Jackson. A military post was established at Parramatta in November 1788 which resulted in a group of Burramattagal people moving into Wallumedegal area at Kissing Point. The impact of illness on local people in the immediate years after arrival has been considered to be due to smallpox. Increasingly this belief is questioned as to the feasibility of such an illness being carried for 15 months at sea.

Early land grants in the Carlingford area in the 1790s included those to Cox, Mobbs and Arndell. Around 1800 about 100 Aboriginal people were noted as living around Cox&#x27;s Brush Farm on the Carlingford-Eastwood border. By 1827 the numbers of Aboriginal people in the area were observed to have dropped considerably.

===Colonial period 1788–1900===

====Etymology====
The name Carlingford came into use officially on 16 July 1883 for the name of the post office located at Mobbs Hill. There are varying accounts of how the name Carlingford was suggested. One version was that local Frederick Cox heard one of his employees describe similarities between Mobbs Hill and the town of Carlingford, County Louth, located in the east of Ireland, on the present day border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Alternatively, and perhaps a happy alignment with the former version, was that Carlingford was named in honour of Lord Carlingford, who was the British Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies 1847–1860.

Prior to 1883 the locality was known under various names and lacked any clear boundaries. The fluidity in district names in the colonial period reflected changes in the patterns of land use and access to the area as the process of colonisation proceeded. Names of nearby areas were sometimes vaguely associated with what became Carlingford and even after that name was settled usage remained fluid for a time.

The Ponds referred from 1791 to the nearby valley (later known as Dundas Valley).

The Eastern Farms (east of Parramatta) in 1792 to what became the Ryde district.

The Northern Boundary broadly referred to the limits of settlement north of Parramatta and could be used variably to include areas later known as North Rocks, Carlingford, Pennant Hills or North Parramatta.

The Field of Mars Common was established in 1804 in the area to the north west of what was to become Carlingford and the parish of the same name was established in 1821. The name Field of Mars too was used loosely to cover anywhere from Ermington to Epping including Carlingford.

North Brush was also used variously to identify the bush north of the Parramatta River covering what is now known as West Ryde, Eastwood, Carlingford and Dundas. Brush Farm on the later border between Carlingford and Eastwood took its name from this usage and was applied to the estate (c. early 1800s) and then the house on the land (c.1820s).

Mobbs Hill was named after the Mobbs family whose land was nearby.

Pennant Hills referred variously to the ridge from Dundas to Mobbs Hill, the quarry in what is now Dundas Valley and the Government wharf at Ermington (1817). Pennant Hills was used in naming the location of St Paul&#x27;s Church built on Mobbs Hill in 1850 and the associated denominational school which commenced around the same time. The school occupied purpose built premises next to the church from 1872 (demolished in the 1970s). When the new public school opened in the same building in January 1883 it was called Pennant Hills South Public School, changing its name to Carlingford Public School in 1887, shortly before moving into new premises across the road. By that date, the name Carlingford had become associated with the locality up to North Rocks and Pennant Hills referred to the area beyond. However, when the railway line opened from Clyde to the Carlingford district in April 1896 the station was called Pennant Hills (the station being on Pennant Hills Road) but was later changed to Carlingford in August 1901.

There was another Carlingford railway station earlier on. When the main northern railway line opened in September 1886 what was to become Epping Station (name adopted in July 1899) was called Field of Mars, then Carlingford (adopted in April 1887) with the area between it and the Carlingford district to the west known as East Carlingford after the post office of that name opened in October 1890. The Epping area had also been referred to formerly as Barren Ridges.

====Orchard country====
The need for food and economic development in the colony expanded white settlement to Parramatta in late 1788. Over the 1790s land grants for farms in the Parramatta area extended to what is now known as the Carlingford district, Kissing Point, North Brush, The Ponds, Field of Mars. Grants were given to Cox, Mobbs, Arndell and others.

Hard labour was required to clear land of the thick bush and then to cultivate, fence and provide housing. Many struggled with low yields of grain, lack of pig, sheep and cattle stock and isolation. Land ownership often turned over many times with larger land owners moving in during the early 1800s including Holt, Barrington, Randal, Kent, Samuel Marsden and John Macarthur.

Fruit growing had become the primary industry in the area by the 1830s as the larger estates were divided into smaller tenant or owner occupied holdings and a second wave of settlers moved into the area. Orange, other citrus, stone fruit, apple and pear orchards were common interspersed with crops such as potatoes and peas. Familiar names in the district, often from a convict background, had set down roots including the Mobbs, Eyles, Spurway, Sonter and other families.

Other economic activity in the district included timber getting from around 1817 with the government convict sawmill operating until about 1830 at the Pennant Hills Sawing Establishment at Barren Ridges (Epping). Timber was hauled to the Pennant Hills Wharf opened in 1817 at Ermington on the Parramatta River. Timber continued to be cut by private contractors into the 20th century. The Pennant Hills blue metal quarry at Dundas was also active from the 1830s.
A public telephone and telegraph service at the Carlingford Post Office began in December 1892 and gas mains were entering the district around the same time.

On the eve of Federation, Carlingford was struggling through the great 1890s economic depression but was poised to once again become a prosperous agricultural district. It had a private railway to take goods to market, &#x27;... a public school with 235 scholars and staff of six teachers, telephone and money order office, two lines of coaches, five stores, and blacksmith and baker&#x27;s shop&#x27;.

===After Federation 1901===

====Early century====

The newly federated nation of Australia was at war when it came into existence on 1 January 1901, with some local men away serving for the British in the Second Anglo-Boer war in South Africa. Locally the failing private railway from Clyde to Pennant Hills had been taken over by the state government. With the latter station renamed Carlingford, the line reopened on 1 August 1901. 

Alongside existing orchards, new nurseries and market gardens began to increase in number. While Carlingford was still distinctly rural, technological change in the district continued with the establishment of the Pennant Hills Wireless Telegraphy Station in 1912, extension of telephone lines, and the arrival of electric power in 1922. Additionally the area saw the laying of reticulated water mains in 1908, the creation of a metropolitan water storage reservoir on Mobbs Hill in 1916, and the installation of a public drinking-water fountain in the middle of the road at Mobbs Hill in 1911. The area also underwent a transition from horse drawn road transport to motorized, which led to the removal of the Mobbs Hill drinking fountain 1929 as it had become a hazard to the increased volume of motorized traffic. A Mechanics&#x27; Institute and Memorial Hall, designed by Sydney architect and Carlingford resident Lord Livingstone Ramsay, was opened at Mobbs Hill in 1924 (demolished 1987) and was the centre of many social events, political rallies, fetes and school activities.

The 1930s Great Depression contracted economic activity and the people of Carlingford struggled on. Owners of farms had relatively easier access to food than labourers.
====Children&#x27;s homes====
In April 1923 the Wesley Central Mission/ City Central Methodist Mission established the Dalmar Children&#x27;s Homes on of land near Marsden Road in the eastern end of the suburb. The property eventually had many cottages, together with a hospital, an orchard and vegetable gardens. The land is now the site of the Alan Walker Retirement Village.

The suburb was also home to several homes for children operated by the Anglican Diocese of Sydney since the 1920s: The Church of England Boys&#x27; Home, Church of England Girls&#x27; Home, and the Havilah Children&#x27;s Home, Tress Manning Temporary Care, and Field Cottage. Land owned by the homes has since been developed for housing, with street names such as Trigg, Marella, Carramar, Buckland and Lisgar reflecting the names of individual houses or Anglican Home Mission Society services. Boys&#x27; Home buildings and grounds are now the regional base and Sydney Australia Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Girls&#x27; Home property in the south of the suburb has become, since 1974, Anglicare&#x27;s Kingsdene Special School for severely to profoundly intellectually disabled children, as well as the American International School.
====Urbanization====

As Sydney rapidly expanded, following World War II, Carlingford underwent rapid urbanization. James Ruse Agricultural High School, established in 1959, is a testament to the agricultural history of Carlingford as well as the rapid pace of urbanisation; which soon made the school, and its large farm, somewhat of an anomaly amongst the 1970s and 1980s housing which dominate the suburb. Soon after James Ruse there followed upper-end housing. An example of which is Carlingford&#x27;s Calinda Manse, a nine bedroom property. More recently, in the 1990s, the government policy of urban consolidation has seen the development of high-density units and apartment blocks around the town centre and the train station. There have also been redevelopments of older houses into medium-density townhouses, and duplex housing.

In 1961, the memorial was unveiled, and stands as a prominent feature in Carlingford, passed by thousands of motorists along Pennant Hills Road each day.

The first large shopping centre opened in 1965 as the Carlingford Village on a former orchard and nursery site. After redevelopment in the 1970s it was renamed Carlingford Court. Additional redevelopments of the centre occurred in the late 1990s with further changes when the Myer department store closed on 31 March 2006. The old 19th century and early 20th century shops and houses on the corner of Pennant Hills and Marsden Roads at Mobbs Hill were demolished in the 1970s, and &quot;The Orchard&quot; shopping centre was built on the site, and after later redevelopment it was renamed as Carlingford Village.

The rural guise of the district has largely disappeared: rapid urbanisation, subdivision, population growth and advent of car clogged roads has changed the area completely.

==Heritage==
The Carlingford and nearby district hosts a wide range of built and natural heritage sites. These include Aboriginal cultural sites, houses, public buildings, churches, gardens, regeneration sites, industrial, war memorials, road infrastructure and former farm sites. Some of these are formally listed on the NSW State Heritage Register or identified in the NSW State Inventory. Several are also appear on the Register of the National Estate. As with much of suburban Sydney, many sites have been destroyed through years of development or neglect.

A handful of Carlingford and district&#x27;s heritage sites include:

Carlingford was a favourite spot for the Northwood Group of landscape painters. In the 1930s-1940s this social group would gather to paint outdoors and included Lloyd Rees, Roland Wakelin, John Santry, Marie Santry and George Lawrence. Wakelin completed a number of paintings inspired by the district. Three include: &quot;Carlingford Pastoral&quot; (1935) incorporates built heritage elements of the Mobbs Hill landscape – two water reservoirs, St Paul&#x27;s Church and the church hall; &quot;Afternoon, Carlingford&quot; (1949) inspired by Carlingford hills, houses and farms; similarly, &quot;House at Carlingford&quot; (1950) was inspired by the locale&#x27;s buildings and land.

==Commercial areas==
The major Carlingford shopping and commercial areas are located on Pennant Hills Road. The main, two small to medium-sized shopping centres are Carlingford Court and Carlingford Village, (which has a JUSCO). 
There are several shopping strips across the suburb, including but not limited to; on the corner of Pennant Hills Rd and Marsden Road (&#x27;at the top&#x27; of Mobbs Hill), on Pennant Hills Road near Carlingford Railway Station (&#x27;at the bottom&#x27; of Mobbs Hill), on Mobbs Lane, to the north on Carmen Drive, and Carlingford North shops off North Rocks Rd near Pennant Parade.

Carlingford Court (opened in 1965 as &quot;Carlingford Village&quot;) on the corner of Pennant Hills and Carlingford Roads is a medium-sized suburban shopping centre featuring supermarkets, department and variety stores, and specialty shops.

Carlingford Village (opened in the 1970s as &quot;The Orchard&quot; shopping centre) on the corner of Pennant Hills and Marsden Roads on top of Mobbs Hill includes many Asian food outlets.

==Transport==
Much of Carlingford has relatively limited public transport access, which is reflected in the low public transport patronage by commuters. At the 2011 census, 18.1% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 64.1% by car (either as driver or as passenger).

=== Roads ===

At the 2011 census, 64.1% of employed people travelled to work by car: 59.5% as driver and 4.3% as passenger. The Cumberland Highway, a major north–south route through greater Sydney, intersects Carlingford in the form of Pennant Hills Road. As well, many motorists commuting from the Hills District and the growing north-west areas of Sydney travel through Carlingford to the city.

The M2 Hills Motorway, part of the Sydney orbital road, runs through northern Carlingford providing a route to the city and North Sydney. Since the Westlink M7 Motorway was finished, completing the Sydney Orbital, it has replaced the Cumberland Highway as the north–south national highway.

The area of Carlingford to the east of Pennant Hills Road and North of Carlingford Road, was built mostly in the years, post World War II. There is an area of streets named after famous North African battle fields.

===Buses===
There are several bus routes through Carlingford. Major bus stations are located at Carlingford Court Shopping Centre, Carlingford Railway Station and Oakes Road M2 bus stop.

=== Rail ===

Carlingford railway station was the terminus of the Carlingford Line on the Sydney Trains network. The Carlingford Line, which opened on 20 April 1896 as a private railway, then as a public line on 1 August 1901, was a mostly single-track line. Trains operated as all stops services to Clyde railway station every 30 or 60 minutes, before terminating where passengers would then have to change for a train service to the city. Consequently, the service had low patronage. As part of the CityRail Clearways Project, a passing loop was promised for the Carlingford Line with two services per hour all day to become effective in 2010. This was however scrapped in the 2008 mini-budget.

A conversion of the Camellia to Carlingford section of the Carlingford railway line to light rail was announced in 2015 as part of the Parramatta Light Rail project. On 5 January 2020, the railway line shut down between Clyde and Carlingford railway stations to commence construction of the Parramatta Light Rail Project, due to be opened in late 2024. A bus service, Route 535, running all stops between Parramatta railway station and ex-Carlingford Railway Station, was introduced as a measure to replace the rail service during the construction.

The light rail station opened in 20 December 2024, serving as the terminus for the L4 Westmead &amp; Carlingford line.

<text>Stern&#x27;s was a regional department store chain serving the U.S. states of New York and New Jersey. The chain was in business for more than 130 years. 

In 2001, Stern&#x27;s parent company Federated Department Stores opted to retire the Stern&#x27;s brand. Most of the stores were immediately converted to Stern&#x27;s corporate sibling Macy&#x27;s, with others liquidated and reopened as Bloomingdale&#x27;s.

==History==
Stern Brothers was founded in 1867 by Isaac, Louis and Benjamin Stern, sons of German Jewish immigrants. In that year, they began selling dry goods in Buffalo, New York. From these humble beginnings, the Stern Brothers became an important merchandising family in New York City.

In 1868, they moved to New York City and opened a one-room store at 367 Sixth Avenue. In 1879, the store was again relocated to larger quarters at 110 West 23rd Street. Outgrowing the store at 110 West 23rd Street, Stern Brothers erected a new structure at the same location which became the new flagship store in 1878. It was noted for its cast-iron facade at 32 to 36 West 23rd Street and 23 to 35 West 22nd Street.

The building was designed by Henry Fernbach. It was enlarged according to a design by W.M. Schinckel in 1892. The enormous, six-story building was executed in the Renaissance Revival style. W.M. Schinckel&#x27;s typically 19th century addition tripled the dimensions of the original structure on the eastern portion of the site. The tall central section of this addition animates the long and delicately detailed facade. The company&#x27;s monogram is still located above the central arch. (This structure is still in use today. The first floor houses a Home Depot, while the upper floors are showrooms.). Many members of the Stern family worked in this store, which carried both luxury goods and merchandise for the working classes. It was an elegant store noted for its fashionable clothes. Ladies from all over the city came to Stern Brothers for their Paris fashions. This enterprise was distinguished by its elegant door men in top hats and the generous and friendly service of the Sterns themselves.

Stern Brothers was a family business. The family for decades ran the store and family members filled the many positions in the store. However, Robert (1888-1954), the son of founder Issac Stern, changed his last name to Stearns and founded the investment bank Bear Stearns in 1923.

It was not uncommon for customers to be greeted by the brothers themselves. The family was joined by Arthur D. Brandeis in 1914. His daughter, Aliss Ruth had married Irving C. Stern, one of the directors of Stern Brothers and son of founder Louis Stern. Brandeis was president of J. L. Brandeis and Sons of Omaha, Nebraska, the biggest department store west of Chicago.

In 1913, Stern Brothers moved farther uptown and built a new flagship store near Fifth Avenue and West 42nd Street across from Bryant Park. The new store had nine floors with the buying offices located in the basement. Stern&#x27;s catered to the Carriage Trade and had a separate entrance for customers like the Goulds and Astors. Since the store was near the Theater District, many up and coming stars worked in the store. The busy hours of the store were between 11am to 2pm, when local workers from the area were on their lunch break.

Stern&#x27;s was purchased by Allied Stores in 1951. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, sales began to decline as most white New Yorkers moved to the suburbs. Stern&#x27;s closed its flagship in New York in 1969 and moved their corporate headquarters to their store in Paramus, New Jersey&#x27;s Bergen Mall, which became the flagship. At that time Stern&#x27;s owner, Allied Stores Stern&#x27;s merged the division with it Quackenbush division in Paterson, New Jersey. There was a second Quackenbush store in the Preakness section of Wayne, New Jersey; in the same year that Stern&#x27;s moved its base to New Jersey it opened a second location in Wayne that served as the fourth anchor for the newly constructed Willowbrook Mall. Eventually the downtown Paterson store was closed. Stern&#x27;s opened a new full line store in the Woodbridge Center Mall in 1971. Additional stores followed at Middlesex Mall, Essex Green, Seaview Square Mall, Ocean County Mall amongst others. The store briefly entered the Philadelphia market acquiring several locations of Gimbels Philadelphia division.

<text>Manhattan Mall was an indoor shopping mall at 33rd Street and Sixth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. There are entrances to the New York City Subway&#x27;s station and the PATH&#x27;s station on the second basement level.

The mall replaced the former flagship store of the Gimbels department store chain, which operated from 1910 to 1986. It opened in 1989 as a shopping center called A&amp;S Plaza and was rebranded Manhattan Mall in 1995. Stern&#x27;s department store occupied the anchor store space from 1995–2001. The upper floors were converted into office space in the 2000s decade, with the mall focusing on the first, second, and two basement levels instead. JCPenney operated the large anchor store from 2007 to 2020.

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City in 2020, most of the remaining stores departed, and the location became a dead mall. As of mid-2022, the mall area functions primarily as an expanded lobby for the offices of 100 West 33rd Street, allowing office tenants direct access from Sixth Avenue as well as the subway station. Lenscrafters is the only retail store remaining inside the mall.

==History==
The structure was originally built as the flagship of the Gimbels department store chain. It was designed by famed architect Daniel Burnham and opened on September 29, 1910. The store was located in the cluster of large department stores that surrounded Herald Square, in Midtown Manhattan. It offered of selling space. A major selling point was its many doors leading to the Herald Square New York City Subway station. On the other hand, by the time Gimbels closed in 1986, the store had the highest rate of &quot;shrinkage&quot;, or shoplifting losses, in the world. Doors also opened to a pedestrian passage under 33rd Street, connecting Penn Station to the 34th Street (New York City Subway) and 33rd Street (PATH) stations. This Gimbels Passageway was closed in the 1990s for security reasons during a period of high crime.

Gimbels closed in 1986. After a renovation, the structure reopened in 1989 as A&amp;S Plaza, anchored by an A&amp;S department store. The mall was originally 13 stories high, but difficult access to upper floors made the whole mall a financial failure.

A&amp;S closed in 1995 and the anchor store became Stern&#x27;s after Federated Department Stores took acquisition of the brand. The structure was renamed Manhattan Mall, due to the closure of A&amp;S. Stern&#x27;s closed in 2001, after Federated Department Stores decided to discontinue the brand. Unlike other Stern&#x27;s stores, the Manhattan Mall location was not converted to a Macy&#x27;s. Instead, the anchor store was divided into smaller spaces, including a Steve &amp; Barry&#x27;s and a relocated food court. The upper ten levels were converted to office space shortly after the closure of Stern&#x27;s.

Venture bought the building in 1999 for $135 million and sold it to Vornado Realty Trust in 2006 for $689 million.

On April 18, 2007, JCPenney announced that it would open a anchor store on the lower levels of the mall. It was the first JCPenney store in Manhattan. The mall&#x27;s food court, which contained the only Arby&#x27;s restaurant in Manhattan at the time, along with retailers such as Steve &amp; Barry&#x27;s, Brookstone and Nine West were closed in 2008 to make way for the new store. The store officially opened on July 31, 2009. On July 7, 2020, JCPenney closed permanently as part of a plan to close 151 stores nationwide. As of November 2021, clothing store Aeropostale moved into the former Express in the front of the mall having an external entrance, leaving LensCrafters as the last store in the mall. The mall has closed to foot traffic and LensCrafters is only accessible by appointment.

<text>The European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research (EICAR) was founded in 1991 as an organization aiming to further antivirus research and improving development of antivirus software. Recently EICAR has furthered its scope to include the research of malicious software (malware) other than computer viruses and extended work on other information security topics like content security, Wireless LAN security, RFID and information security awareness. EICAR also organizes international security conferences most years, as well as a number of working groups or &#x27;task forces&#x27;.

==Acronym==

&quot;EICAR&quot; was originally an abbreviation for &quot;European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research&quot;, but the organisation no longer uses that full title, and now regards &quot;EICAR&quot; as a self-standing name, as it has expanded into a broader range of IT Security work than just antivirus research.

==EICAR test file==

EICAR, in collaboration with CARO (Computer AntiVirus Research Organization), developed the EICAR test file: a 68-byte file with a .com extension, which is a harmless executable string that tests the integrity of anti-virus software.

<doc id="655499" wikidata="Q109982" url="?curid=655499" title="Herald Square">
<text>Herald Square is a major commercial intersection in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City, formed by the intersection of Broadway, Sixth Avenue (officially Avenue of the Americas), and 34th Street. Named for the now-defunct &quot;New York Herald&quot;, a newspaper formerly headquartered there, it also gives its name to the surrounding area. The bow tie-shaped intersection consists of two named sections: Herald Square to the north (uptown) and Greeley Square to the south (downtown).

==Description==

Herald Square proper is the north end of the square between West 34th and 35th streets. The old &quot;New York Herald&quot; Building was located on the square. The square contains a huge mechanical clock whose mechanical structures were constructed in 1895 by the sculptor Antonin Jean Carles. The monument, known as the James Gordon Bennett Monument, consists of the Goddess of Wisdom, Minerva with her owls in front of a bell, flanked by two bell ringers mounted on a Milford pink granite pedestal. The monument&#x27;s bell was designed to chime on the hour. The two seven-foot-tall bronze laborers, nicknamed Stuff and Guff give the appearance of ringing the bell with their mallets, while in actuality is rung by mallets located behind the bell. The figures and the clock were originally part of the 1894 New York Herald Building that was located at the square. Prior to the demolition of the building in 1921, the figures were removed and reinstalled in the Square in 1940.

Greeley Square lies between West 32nd and 33rd streets between Broadway and Sixth Avenue, and is taken up almost entirely by a triangular park. It is named after Horace Greeley, who was the publisher of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Herald&#x27;s&quot; rival newspaper. (The two papers later merged to form the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;.) There is a statue of Greeley inside the park, created in 1890 by Alexander Doyle. The small park is planted with trees and shrubbery, enclosed by a wrought-iron fence, and provided with inviting chairs, tables and a restaurant kiosk.

Herald and Greeley squares stand today as rest areas for the thousands of shoppers that flood the neighborhood, as a lunchroom for thousands of midtown office workers, and as a stage for product launches, musical performances, and photo and film shoots.

==Shopping==
The area around Herald Square along Broadway and 34th Street is a retail hub. The most notable attraction is Macy&#x27;s Herald Square, the flagship department store for Macy&#x27;s, the largest Macy&#x27;s store in the United States. In 2007, Macy&#x27;s, Inc. moved its corporate headquarters to that store after changing the corporation&#x27;s name from Federated. Macy&#x27;s&#x27; archrival Gimbels was also located in the neighborhood until 1984; in 1986 that building became the Manhattan Mall. Other past retailers in the area included E.J. Korvette, Stern&#x27;s, and Abraham &amp; Straus. J.C. Penney opened its first Manhattan flagship store in August 2009 at the former A&amp;S location inside the Manhattan Mall. The square is roughly equidistant between Madison Square to the south, and Times Square to the north. Greeley Square&#x27;s south side borders Koreatown, at West 32nd Street.

==Transportation==
The area is served by the New York City Subway&#x27;s 34th Street–Herald Square station, which is serviced by the . Additionally, the 33rd Street station on the PATH&#x27;s , , and trains serves the southern part of Herald Square.

==Renovation==

Since 1992, Herald and Greeley Squares have been cared for by the 34th Street Partnership, a Business Improvement District (BID) operating over 31 blocks in midtown Manhattan. The 34th Street Partnership provides sanitary and security services, maintains a horticultural program that includes trees, gardens, and planters, and produces events, product launches, and photo shoots. 34th Street Partnership also added movable chairs, tables, and umbrellas, to the parks. In 1999, the parks were completely renovated by the 34th Street Partnership. Two years later, the partnership added the city&#x27;s first Automated Pay Toilets in the two squares, one in each square. Since 2008, each square has had a food kiosk operated by sandwich, soup, and salad shop . In 2009, the 34th Street Partnership converted the parks&#x27; Automated Pay Toilets into free public facilities, a rarity in New York City.

With the introduction of &quot;Broadway Boulevard&quot;, a 2009 project by the New York City Department of Transportation to increase pedestrian space on the segment of Broadway between 35th and 42nd Streets, the passive space provided by Herald and Greeley Squares more than doubled, radically changing the character of the area. The two blocks of Broadway between 33rd and 35th Streets were completely closed to vehicular traffic, and were made pedestrian-only with bike lanes. The 34th Street Partnership filled the newly pedestrianized space with chairs, tables, umbrellas, and free public programs such as chess tables, dance lessons, and exercise classes. As of April 2013, the boulevard had been redesigned. Because of the popularity of the pedestrian plaza and bike lanes in Herald and Greeley Squares, the plaza was redesigned again in 2019. Another block of Broadway between 32nd and 33rd Street was shut to vehicular and bike traffic, while 33rd Street between Broadway and Sixth Avenue was reopened, and the bike lane through Greeley Square was relocated from Broadway to Sixth Avenue. The Greeley Square restroom was restored in 2020.

==In popular culture==
Numerous songs refer to Herald Square, such as: George M. Cohan&#x27;s song &quot;Give My Regards to Broadway&quot; (1904), which includes the lyrics &quot;remember me to Herald Square&quot;; Andrew B. Sterling and Harry Von Tilzer&#x27;s song &quot;Take Me Back to New York Town&quot; (1907); Billy Joel&#x27;s song &quot;Rosalinda&#x27;s Eyes&quot; (1978); and Freedy Johnston&#x27;s song &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; (1994).

Herald Square is the terminus for the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, broadcast nationally by NBC-TV.

<text>Want One is the third studio album by the Canadian-American singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright, released through DreamWorks Records on September 23, 2003. The album was produced by Marius de Vries and mixed by Andy Bradfield, with Lenny Waronker as the executive in charge of production. &quot;Want One&quot; spawned two singles: &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What It Is&quot;, which peaked at number 74 on the UK Singles Chart, and &quot;Oh What a World&quot;. The album charted in three countries, reaching number 60 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number 130 in France, and number 77 in the Netherlands.

&quot;Want One&quot; features guest vocals from Martha Wainwright, Joan Wasser, Teddy Thompson and Linda Thompson, as well as a banjo solo on &quot;14th Street&quot; by Wainwright&#x27;s mother Kate McGarrigle. For the album, Wainwright won the award for Outstanding Music Artist at the 15th GLAAD Media Awards, won Best New Recording and received a nomination for Best Songwriter at the OutMusic Awards, and was nominated for the 2004 Shortlist Music Prize.

It was the first part of what was intended to be a double album called &quot;Want&quot;. The second part, &quot;Want Two&quot;, was released the following year. &quot;Want One&quot; was later repackaged along with &quot;Want Two&quot; as a two-disc set titled &quot;Want&quot; and was released on November 28, 2005 in the UK to coincide with Wainwright&#x27;s tour.

==Promotion==
===Singles===
&quot;Want One&quot;&#x27;s first single was &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What It Is&quot;, released in a slim-line jewel case on July 26, 2004 in the UK. It included two B-sides: &quot;L&#x27;absence&quot; (a French aria from Hector Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Les nuits d&#x27;été, op. 7&quot;) and &quot;14th Street&quot;, both of which were recorded live at The Fillmore in San Francisco in March 2004. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What It Is&quot; appeared on the UK Singles Chart for one week, entering on August 7, 2004 and reaching its peak position at number 74. &quot;Oh What a World&quot; was the second single from the album, released digitally via iTunes and 7digital in the UK on November 8, 2004. Promotional copies were distributed to radio stations.

===Other forms of promotion===
The album was released as a double vinyl promo, retaining the original artwork. Vinyl was never pressed for commercial outlets at the time of release and these promo copies sell for over $75 US in the secondary market. While no official music videos were produced to promote the album, live videos of &quot;Beautiful Child&quot; and &quot;Vibrate&quot; were made available for download on iTunes. A thirty-second commercial which contained audio samples of &quot;Oh What a World&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What It Is&quot; aired on television just prior to the album&#x27;s release. &quot;Vibrate&quot; and &quot;Natasha&quot; featured in season two of &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;.

Wainwright made several television appearances in 2003, including the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on June 27 (&quot;Dinner at Eight&quot;), &quot;The Sharon Osbourne Show&quot; on November 4 (&quot;Vibrate&quot;), Letterman&#x27;s show again on October 6 (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What It Is&quot;), &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on November 11 (&quot;Vibrate&quot;), and &quot;Breakfast with the Arts&quot; on December 21 (&quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; and &quot;Spotlight on Christmas&quot;). 2004 television appearances included &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; on March 3 (&quot;Gay Messiah&quot;), &quot;The Vicki Gabereau Show&quot; on April 9 (&quot;Dinner at Eight&quot;), &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; on May 14 (&quot;Vibrate&quot;), and &quot;The Frank Skinner Show&quot; on November 4 (&quot;Oh What a World&quot;). Wainwright also appeared on &quot;Play&quot;, CNN&#x27;s &quot;Headline News&quot; and a local airing of Central Park SummerStage to promote &quot;Want One&quot;. &quot;Live at the Fillmore&quot;, which contained songs from &quot;Want One&quot; and later accompanied the release of &quot;Want Two&quot;, originally aired as a special on the cable television network Trio in May 2004.

==Songs==
The album&#x27;s opener, &quot;Oh What a World&quot;, has been described as a, &quot;choir of harmonies building to a full orchestra that finds Wainwright leading what can only be described as a masterpiece of horns, harmonies and hope&quot;. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What It Is&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;climbs to a soaring Beatles-esque climax of train rides&quot;. Wainwright revealed the source and meaning of the song:

&quot;Vicious World&quot;, which features &quot;soft, Björkian keyboards and twinkling electronic sounds&quot; and &quot;sounds like it&#x27;s got about 350 multi-tracked vocals&quot;, has been characterized by Wainwright as &quot;one of those happy/sad songs&quot;, referring to the song&#x27;s joyous sound but negative lyrics. Wainwright said the following of &quot;Movies of Myself&quot;, with its &quot;straight-ahead bounce, drum-led clip, and aberrant guitar crunch&quot;:

&quot;Slant Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Sal Cinquemani described &quot;Go or Go Ahead&quot; as a &quot;multi-tiered, emotionally-charged epic that could pass for a paranoid Radiohead song&quot;.

&quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; is one of many songs from the Wainwright family about inter-familial strife. It was composed in response to a fight with Rufus&#x27;s father, acclaimed singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III. The two had recently finished a photo shoot for Rolling Stone and were eating together when Rufus joked that his success had gotten his father back into the magazine. This escalated into a very heated exchange. Rufus composed the song later that night; its title refers to the meal and makes reference to the fight in the lyrics. It also recounts his father leaving the family when Rufus was young. Though unreleased as a single in the U.S., Rufus performed the song on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on October 6, 2013.

==Album references==
The title of the first track comes from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, in which the Wicked Witch of the West screams &quot;Oh, what a world! What a world!&quot; as she is melting away. Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot; is musically referenced throughout the track. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What It Is&quot; contains several allusions to the American sitcom &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, specifically the opening theme song, with phrases such as &quot;Take a step that is new&quot;, &quot;...thinks Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, and &quot;So I knock on the door&quot;. The lyrics &quot;Taking the Santa Fe and the Atchison, Topeka&quot; is a reference to Judy Garland&#x27;s 1946 musical film &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot;, which itself contains a reference to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway with the song &quot;On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe&quot;. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What It Is&quot; also mentions several geographic locations, including Calais, Dover, Poland, Limbo, and Lower Manhattan.

The flute arrangement in &quot;Vicious World&quot; is a reference to Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;. &quot;Movies of Myself&quot; mentions a &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; edition by Jesus as well as &quot;an old piece of bacon never eaten by Elvis&quot;, referring to a story that Wainwright heard about someone who purchased a framed piece of bacon on eBay that at one time belonged to musician Elvis Presley. &quot;Go or Go Ahead&quot; contains celestial and mythological references, from angels, stars, planets, and Mars to vampires and Medusa (along with the phrase &quot;Look in her eyes&quot;), a female chthonic monster that turns onlookers to stone.

&quot;Vibrate&quot; references pop star Britney Spears and fairy tale character Pinocchio, while &quot;14th Street&quot; refers to the nursery rhyme about Little Bo Peep. The latter also has the phrase &quot;And there&#x27;ll be rainbows&quot;, referring to Judy Garland&#x27;s classic ballad &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. &quot;Natasha&quot; was written for and about Wainwright&#x27;s friend, actress Natasha Lyonne, who has had public struggles with substance abuse and health problems.

The album&#x27;s title track, &quot;Want&quot;, alludes to Wainwright&#x27;s parents Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle, and mentions musicians John Lennon and Leonard Cohen as well as &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; cast members John Lithgow and Jane Curtin. In &quot;11:11&quot;, &quot;Put away your posies, I&#x27;m gonna have a drink before we ring around the rosies&quot; refers to the nursery rhyme &quot;Ring Around the Rosie&quot;, which is commonly said to be about the black plague. The last verse, which mentions &quot;something burning&quot; in Manhattan, alludes to the September 11 attacks and the collapse of the World Trade Center towers. &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; was written about a disagreement Wainwright and his father had at a photo shoot for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The song contains an allusion to the Biblical story of David and Goliath with the phrase &quot;I&#x27;m gonna take you down with one little stone&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Overall, reception of the album was positive. AllMusic&#x27;s Zac Johnson described the album as &quot;another set of obscenely lush and opulent pop operettas... meticulously layered and richly textured, with full orchestral passages and many-throated harmonies&quot;. After praising the album, Johnson concluded that Wainwright &quot;could be singing lists of names out of the phone book and it would still be more exciting and inventive than 99 percent of the other albums out there&quot;. Wainwright&#x27;s style caused Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant&quot; to draw comparisons to a giant peacock&#x27;s kaleidoscopic tail, and he insisted that producer Marius de Vries &quot;[kept] the singer&#x27;s opulent poperas and lush ballads in check while bringing them to a new level of lovely pageantry&quot;. Cinquemani also asserted that &quot;Want One&quot; had a &quot;balanced mix of rollicking rock operas&quot; and &quot;quiet piano ballads&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Marc Weingarten characterized the album as a &quot;gorgeous meditation on emotional displacement&quot;, with &quot;clever, gently ironic wordplay&quot;. In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Fricke called the album a record of &quot;breathtaking, eccentric opulence&quot; and a &quot;loving nod to the vocal and poetic gifts he inherited from his parents&quot;, folk musicians Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle. Fricke concluded: &quot;With the sumptuous honesty of &quot;Want One&quot;, their son is now his own man&quot;.

However, the album did receive some criticism, mostly pertaining to its lavish and decadent style. &quot;Blender&quot;&#x27;s RJ Smith called Wainwright&#x27;s &quot;carnival-esque piano playing... so thick, the music all but drowns in pretty surfaces&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; mostly complimented &quot;Want One&quot;, though its review revealed a preference for the simpler tracks like &quot;Want&quot; and &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot;, &quot;when it&#x27;s just him and his piano&quot;. The review also criticized &quot;Movies of Myself&quot;, describing the song as having &quot;plaintive vocals [that] jar against stadium-rock guitars and dubious Eighties keyboards&quot;. Contrastingly, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s review singles out &quot;Vibrate&quot;, &quot;Natasha&quot;, &quot;Pretty Things&quot;, and &quot;Want&quot; for being &quot;simply too sparse to offer any real substance&quot;.

&quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; in particular has received two other prominent raves. In 2010, while promoting the release of a live double album, David Bowie praised &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; as &quot;the best&quot; father/son song he knew, calling Rufus &quot;simply one of the great writers.&quot; In 2011, in &quot;Planet Word&quot;, author and BBC producer John-Paul Davidson, in a discussion of poetry and song, called &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; &quot;no finer expression of an argument between a son and a father who abandoned him.&quot;

==Charts==
&quot;Want One&quot; debuted at No. 60 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Wainwright&#x27;s highest position on the chart until the release of his fifth studio album, &quot;Release the Stars&quot; (2007). The album reached peak positions of No. 130 in France and No. 77 in the Netherlands. &quot;Want One&quot; won Wainwright the award for Outstanding Music Artist at the 15th GLAAD Media Awards, an awards ceremony created by the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to recognize and honor the mainstream media for their fair representations of the gay community. The album also won the award for Best New Recording and earned Wainwright a nomination for Best Songwriter at the OutMusic Awards. &quot;Want One&quot; was nominated for the 2004 Shortlist Music Prize.

In 2006, both &quot;Want One&quot; and &quot;Want Two&quot; were included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, and two years later &quot;Out&quot; ranked &quot;Poses&quot; No. 50 and &quot;Want One&quot; No. 80 on their &quot;100 Greatest, Gayest Albums&quot; list. &quot;Want&quot; is featured in Toby Creswell&#x27;s 2006 book, &quot;1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories and Secrets Behind Them&quot;. The album was recognized as one of the &quot;50 best albums of the decade&quot; by &quot;Paste&quot; in 2009, appearing as No. 16 on the list.

<text>Kvenland, known as &quot;Cwenland&quot;, &quot;Qwenland&quot;, &quot;Kænland&quot;, and similar terms in medieval sources, is an ancient name for an area in Fennoscandia and Scandinavia. Kvenland, in that or nearly that spelling, is known from an Old English account written in the 9th century, which used information provided by Norwegian adventurer and traveler Ohthere, and from Nordic sources, primarily Icelandic. A possible additional source was written in the modern-day area of Norway. All known Nordic sources date from the 12th and 13th centuries. Other possible references to Kvenland by other names and spellings are also discussed here.

==Old English Orosius==
A Norwegian adventurer and traveler named Ohthere visited England around 890 CE. King Alfred of Wessex had his stories written down and included them in his Old English version of a world history written by the Romano-Hispanic author Orosius. Ohthere&#x27;s story contains the only contemporary description about Kvenland that has survived from the 9th century:
[Ohthere] said that the Norwegians&#x27; () land was very long and very narrow ... and to the east are wild mountains, parallel to the cultivated land. Finnas inhabit these mountains ... Then along this land southwards, on the other side of the mountain (&quot;sic&quot;), is Sweden ... and along that land northwards, Kvenland (). The Kvens () sometimes make depredations on the Northmen over the mountain, and sometimes the Northmen on them; there are very large [freshwater] amongst the mountains, and the Kvens carry their ships over land into the meres, and thence make depredations on the Northmen; they have very little ships, and very light.

As is emphasized in the text, Ohthere&#x27;s account was an oral statement, made to King Alfred, and the section dealing with Kvenland takes up only two sentences. Ohthere&#x27;s information on Kvens may have been second-hand, since, unlike in his other stories, Ohthere does not emphasize his personal involvement in any way. Ohthere&#x27;s method of locating Kvenland can be interpreted to mean that Kvenland was located in and around the northern part of the modern-day Sweden and in the mid-western part of the modern-day Finland, when the difference in the Viking compass is taken into consideration (see more further below). Other, somewhat later sources call the land adjacent to the northern part of Norway &quot;Finnmark.&quot;

Ohthere&#x27;s may be a reference to the Sami people, but not all historians agree on this. Although Ohthere does not give any name for the area where his &quot;Finnas&quot; lived, he gives a lengthy description of their lives in and around Northern Norway, without mentioning Kvens.

Ohthere&#x27;s mention of the &quot;large [freshwater] meres&quot; and of the Kvens&#x27; boats are of great interest. The meres are said to be &quot;amongst the mountains&quot;, the words used in the text being . Ohthere may be referring to the Southern Norwegian lake district, which is also referred to in &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;. This way, the reference would have included Lake Mjøsa, an area which is known to have been inhabited at that time: the Orkneyinga saga tells how these inhabitants were attacked by men from Kvenland.

The mention of the &quot;very light ships&quot; (boats) carried overland has a well-documented ethnographic parallel in the numerous portages of the historical river and lake routes in Fennoscandia and Northern Russia. According to the philologist Irmeli Valtonen, &quot;[the] text does not give us a clear picture where the &quot;Cwenas&quot; are to be located though it seems a reasonable conclusion that they lived or stayed somewhere in the modern-day areas of Northern Sweden or Northern Finland.&quot;

The name &quot;Kven&quot; briefly appears later in King Alfred&#x27;s &quot;Orosius&quot;. The Kven Sea is mentioned as the northern border for the ancient Germany, and Kvenland is mentioned again, as follows:
... the Swedes () have to the south of them the arm of the sea called East (), and to the east of them Sarmatia (), and to the north, over the wastes, is Kvenland (), to the northwest are the nomadic people (), and the Norwegians () are to the west.

The Viking compass is believed to have had a 45-degree rotation of cardinal points. If the territories listed in King Alfred&#x27;s &quot;Orosius&quot; are examined with that in mind, the Norwegians would be to the northwest of Sweden, and the nomadic people would be to the north. These points are correct after rotation based on the difference between the Viking and modern compasses. Kvenland is then situated to the northeast of Sweden and might be placed somewhere around the present-day Swedish Norrland or the western part of the present-day Finland. The information of Kvenland being situated &quot;over the wastes&quot;, northwards from the Viking-period &quot;Sweden&quot; (corresponding roughly to the south-central part of present-day Sweden) matches the idea of Kvenland extending to Norrland. There is no &quot;Finland&quot; mentioned anywhere either in the original or the updated version of Orosius&#x27; history.

==&quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot; and &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;==

Three medieval Icelandic accounts discuss Kvenland. They are &quot;Egils saga&quot; and the more legendary &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot; and &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;. According to &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot;, Kvens made sacrifices to Thorri, who &quot;ruled over Gothland, Kvenland (Kænlandi) and Finland.&quot; According to &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;, Fornjót was &quot;a king&quot; who &quot;reigned over Gotland, which we now know as Finland and Kvenland.&quot;

A DNA study conducted on the prehistoric skeletal remains of four individuals from Gotland supports the area having been ethnically interconnected with Finland and Kvenland during the primeval era, just as suggested by &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot; and &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;:
&quot;The hunter-gatherers show the greatest similarity to modern-day Finns&quot;, says Pontus Skoglund, an evolutionary geneticist at Uppsala University in Sweden.

Recent archaeological discoveries made in Finland have further emphasized the close ties between Gotland and modern-day Finland during the primeval era. In the late spring of 2013, a Merovingian period (600–800 AD) silver plate, believed to be a piece of a sword scabbard, was discovered in Rautjärvi, Finland. The origin of the silver plate has been traced to Gotland, based on its style of ornamentation. According to Jukka Luoto of the Museum of South Karelia, &quot;this indicates that these areas have independently conducted trade with Gotland.&quot;

&quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; contains a realistic description of Nór traveling from Kvenland to Norway. Based on the saga&#x27;s internal chronologies, this would have happened around the 6th or 7th century CE, but the dating is very insecure. Locations of Kvenland, Finland and Gotland are given rather exactly:
&quot;to the east of the gulf that lies across from the White Sea (Gandvík); we call that the Gulf of Bothnia (Helsingjabotn).&quot;

The saga is correct in placing the Gulf of Bothnia &quot;across&quot; (i.e., &quot;on the other side of&quot; the isthmus between the two seas) from the White Sea. The saga does not say that Kvenland was on the coast, but just east of the Gulf.

This is how Nór started his journey to Norway:
But Nor, his brother, waited until snow lay on the moors so he could travel on skis. He went out from Kvenland and skirted the Gulf, and came to that place inhabited by the men called Sami (Lapps); that is beyond Finnmark.

Having traveled for a while, Nór was still &quot;beyond Finnmark.&quot; After a brief fight with the Lapps, Nór continued:
But Nor went thence westward to the Kjolen Mountains and for a long time they knew nothing of men, but shot beasts and birds to feed to themselves, until they came to a place where the rivers flowed west of the mountains. — Then he went up along the valleys that run south of the fjord. That fjord is now called Trondheim.
Starting somewhere on the eastern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, Nór had either gone all the way up and around the Gulf, or skied across; it was winter, and the gulf might have been frozen. Nór ended up attacking the area around Trondheim in central Norway and later the lake district in the south, conquering the country and uniting it under his rule. There is no mention of Kvenland after that. Again only a handful of words are devoted to Kvenland, mainly telling where it was.

Nór&#x27;s journey from Kvenland to Norway is missing from &quot;Hversu&quot;, which in fact does not even mention that Nór came from Kvenland at all, only stating: &quot;Norr had great battles west of the Keel&quot;. The journey may have been lifted from some other context and added to &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; in a later phase by an unknown author who wanted to make the saga more adventurous.

==&quot;Egil&#x27;s saga&quot;==
&quot;Egils saga&quot; is an epic Icelandic saga possibly by Snorri Sturluson (1179–1241 CE), who may have written it between 1220 and 1240 CE. While authorship of the sagas is unclear, it is generally accepted that Snorri Sturluson, who was a powerful politician, a diplomat for the Royal House of Norway and a man of letters, was not the author of the sagas, but was rather collecting very old stories that had been transmitted orally for many centuries. The saga covers a long period, starting in Norway in 850 CE and ending around 1000 CE. It contains a short description of Egil&#x27;s uncle Thorolf Kveldulfsson co-operating with a Kvenland king, Faravid, against invading Karelians. Rather accurate geographical details about Kvenland&#x27;s location are given in chapter XIV:
Finmark is a wide tract; it is bounded westwards by the sea, wherefrom large firths run in; by sea also northwards and round to the east; but southwards lies Norway; and Finmark stretches along nearly all the inland region to the south, as also does Hålogaland outside. But eastwards from Namdalen (Naumdale) is Jämtland (Jamtaland), then Hälsingland (Helsingjaland) and Kvenland, then Finland, then Karelia (Kirialaland); along all these lands to the north lies Finmark, and there are wide inhabited fell-districts, some in dales, some by lakes. The lakes of Finmark are wonderfully large, and by the lakes there are extensive forests. But high fells lie behind from end to end of the Mark, and this ridge is called Keels.

Like &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot;, &quot;Egils saga&quot; clearly separates Finland and Kvenland, listing them as neighboring areas. However, Finland is not listed in any of the saga&#x27;s surviving versions, indicating that it might be a later addition by someone who did not recognize Kvenland any more. The saga says &quot;eastwards from Namdalen is Jämtland&quot;, but actually the direction is southeast. Also Hälsingland is southeast, not east, of Jämtland. Since it is widely assumed that the Viking compass had a 45 degree rotation of cardinal points, the saga&#x27;s &quot;east&quot; seems to correspond to the contemporary southeast.

In chapter XVII Thorolf goes to Kvenland again:
That same winter Thorolf went up on the fell with a hundred men; he passed on at once eastwards to Kvenland and met king Faravid.
Had Thorolf gone up to the mountains around his homeland Namdalen and then straight &quot;eastwards&quot;, i.e., southeast, he would have first reached Jämtland and then Hälsingland. These are the same lands that were listed earlier in the saga. If the passage about going &quot;southwest&quot; is taken literally and directly, continuing from Hälsingland across the Gulf of Bothnia Thorolf would have arrived in the southwestern tip of present-day Finland, the center of Finland&#x27;s Viking period population (see map).
Again, as with &quot;Ohthere&quot;, Finns and Kvens are not discussed at the same time. The saga tells how Norwegians taxed the Finns, but there is no indication in the saga that the Kvens would have competed with the Norwegians for control of the Finns or lived near or among them. Much debate has taken place concerning whether the saga provides truthful information of Iron Age Kvenland by mentioning that the Kvens had a real-sounding &#x27;king&#x27; and a &#x27;law&#x27; to divide the loot. The saga places the confrontation of Norwegians and Karelians in the 9th century.

==Other sources==
Besides Old English &quot;Orosius&quot;, &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot;, &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; and &quot;Egil&#x27;s saga&quot;, Kvenland or Kvens are very briefly mentioned in four Icelandic texts from the same era. One of the texts may have been written in Norway.
&quot;Norna-Gests þáttr&quot; has a brief mention of the king of Denmark and Sweden, Sigurd Hring (ruling in the mid-8th century), fighting against the Curonians and the Kvens:
Sigurd Ring () was not there, since he had to defend his land, Sweden (), since Curonians () and Kvens () were raiding there.
&quot;Historia Norwegiae&quot; was written sometime between 1160 and 1175 CE in an unknown location. It contains a list of peoples in the North:
But towards north many pagan tribes—alas!—stretch from the east behind Norway, namely Karelians () and Kvens (), Horned Finns () and both peoples of Bjarmia (). But what tribes dwell behind them, have we no certainty.

===&quot;Icelandic Annals&quot;===
The Icelandic Annals have a late mention of Kvens clearly active in the North. Around 1271 CE, the following is said to have happened:
Then Karelians () and Kvens () pillaged widely in Hålogaland ().

==Possible other sources==
In some pre-medieval and medieval texts, it is not clear which groups of people the authors are referring to by the titles used. According to historians, terms used for either the Kvens, Finns and/or Sami in texts written during the 1st millennium AD include the following:

* &quot;Aeni&quot;, &quot;Aeningia&quot; (in reference to &quot;Fenningia&quot;) – by Pliny the Elder c. 77 AD;
* &quot;Fenni&quot;, &quot;Sitones&quot; – by Publius (or Gaius) Cornelius Tacitus, c. 98;
* &quot;Phinnoi&quot; – by Ptolemy, c. 150;
* &quot;Qwnio&quot;, Qwens – by Ulfilas (in Gothic: Wulfila), c. 352;
*&quot; Finni&quot;, &quot;Finnaithae&quot;, &quot;Screrefennae&quot;, &quot;Vinoviloth&quot;, &quot;Adogit&quot; – by Jordanes, c. 550;
* &quot;Finnas&quot;, &quot;Scriðefinnas&quot; – in Widsith, c. 600;
* &quot;Skridfinnar&quot;, &quot;Winnili&quot; – by Paul the Deacon, c. 790;
* &quot;Finnas&quot;, &quot;Cwenas&quot; – by Ohthere of Hålogaland, c. 888;
* &quot;Finnas&quot;, &quot;Cwenas&quot;, &quot;Qwen&quot; (&quot;Qwensae&quot;) – by King Alfred the Great of Wessex, c. 890.

In the Old Norse language the word &quot;Finn&quot; () referred to the Finnish people, though, and maybe the Sami people as well; the word has the same meaning in Bokmål (one of the two official standards of the Norwegian language). &quot;Skridfinne&quot; (&quot;skiing Finn or moving Finns&quot;) and &quot;finne&quot; might also refer to the Sami people, in both the other Scandinavian languages, Latin () and Greek (&quot;/&quot;) during mediaeval times. 

===&quot;Germania&quot;===

According to Finnish historian Kyösti Julku the Germanic tribe Sitones mentioned in Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Germania&quot; in 98 CE lived in the area in northern Fennoscandia claimed to be &quot;Kvenland&quot;, saying &quot;There can be no confusion about the geographical location of the Sitones.&quot;

==Different interpretations==

===Kvenland and Kainuu===
Kvenland has generated many theories about its origin, the location of Kvenland east of the Bay of Bothnia has, however, been an unchanging feature of most interpretations since the 17th century, when the Swedish historians Johannes Messenius and Olaus Rudbeckius first noted the concept of Kvenland in Old Norse sources. In 1650, Professor Michael Wexionius from Turku became the first to associate Kvenland with the Finnish &quot;Kainuu&quot;. In the 18th century the Finnish historian Henrik Gabriel Porthan, among others, focused attention on the &quot;Ohthere&quot; passage mentioning the &quot;Cwenas&quot;. Whereas Porthan suggested that the ancient Kvens may have been Swedish, many others came to view the Kvens as an ancient Finnish tribe.

Nowadays Kainuu is a name of an inland province in northeastern Finland. In the past the name Kainuu was often used of the more western coastal area around the Bay of Bothnia, even up to the 19th century. In the early &quot;Umesaami&quot; dictionaries the terms &quot;Kainolads&quot; and &quot;Kainahalja&quot; described Norwegian and Swedish men and women respectively.

===Kvenland and Pohjola===

In a theory somewhat closely related to the Kainuu theory, Kvenland has also been associated with the legendary Pohjola. Pohjola is an other-worldly country in Finnish mythology, ruled by a fierce witch called Louhi. Pohjola is best known from the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, a 19th-century Finnish work of epic poetry compiled by Elias Lönnrot from Karelian and Finnish oral folklore and mythology, collected largely in the Finnish region of Kainuu.

Different interpretations of the origins of the mythical Pohjola exist. Some include parts of Lapland and the ancient Kainuu (same as Kvenland according to common view today) in Kalevala&#x27;s Pohjola. Some point out a similarity with the name &quot;Pohjanmaa&quot; (Ostrobothnia in English), a region in western Finland.

===Other interpretations===
An original view has been provided by a Finnish historian and Helsinki University professor, Matti Klinge, who has placed Kvenland/Kainuu not only in southern Finland, but around the Baltic Sea as a kind of Finnish-Swedish &quot;maritime confederation&quot;. Klinge has presented a hypothesis of Kvenland as a naval power on the Baltic, located on both the present-day Finnish and Swedish sides of the Gulf of Bothnia as well as in some of the surrounding areas. The folklorist and professor of literature Väinö Kaukonen calls it &quot;fantastic fabulation&quot; and a &quot;dream-wish&quot;. However, Professor Emeritus in Archeology at the University of Turku, Unto Salo has also concluded that &quot;Kvens/Kainulainens&quot; were men of Satakunta in Southern Finland. There is archeological evidence linking Satakunta and Lapland (for example types of skis) but skipping the areas between which suggests that expeditions were undertaken from Satakunta to the North during the late Viking Age. Further, toponomy suggests that there were regular routes used by the people of Satakunta to get to the North. Lastly, haapio, a type of a very light dugout boat was used extensively in Satakunta and would have been ideal for such expeditions. Unto Salo speculates that the name Haaparanta (&quot;Aspen shore&quot;) in the Northern Sweden (county of Norrbotten) would have been given due to presence of asps needed to build haapios.
Originally Kvenland was more likely situated in the Southern-Ostrobothnia but when this habitation disappeared in the early 9th century for unknown reasons, the Norwegians continued to apply the term Kven to the men of Satakunta and Häme who inherited the Northern trade and taxation. 

===Woman Land===

Different views exist of why ancient scholars have made references to Kvenland as an area dominated by women. Some have suggested that there may have been misinterpretations of terminology. Whatever the etymological origin of the element &quot;kven&quot;, it effortlessly translates to &quot;woman&quot; in Old Norse. Proto-Germanic , , and for &#x27;woman&#x27; developed into , , , , , and in Old Norse. It is plausible that this led learned speakers of Old Norse to identify Kvenland with the land of the Amazons in Greek legend; Adam of Bremen, for example, often mentions Amazons in writing of the far North.

Among sources used in the related debate by historians is the following statement of Tacitus from c. 98 CE:

&quot;Upon the Suiones, border the people Sitones; and, agreeing with them in all other things, differ from them in one, that here the sovereignty is exercised by a woman. So notoriously do they degenerate not only from a state of liberty, but even below a state of bondage.&quot;

According to a view shared by many historians, the term &quot;Sitones&quot; (Kvens) shares etymological roots with Sigtuna, which much later had a Latin spelling . According to &quot;Disas saga&quot;, the Sitones were ruled by a queen. According to a common view, the &quot;queen&quot; of the Sitones either derives from or is a possible linguistic confusion of an Old Norse term used for &#x27;woman&#x27;, which shares linguistic origins with the term used in reference to the Kvens. According to Thomas William Shore, the English language term &quot;queen&quot; derives from the term , a spelling used for the Kvens e.g. by Wulfila in c. 352 CE and King Alfred the Great of Wessex in c. 890 CE. In 1075 AD, in &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot;, the German chronicler Adam of Bremen calls Kvenland Women&#x27;s Land, stating the following:

Meanwhile Swedes (), who had expelled their bishop, got a divine revenge. And at first King&#x27;s son called Anund, whose father had sent him to enlarge his kingdom, after arriving to Women&#x27;s Land (), whom we consider to be Amazons, was killed along with his army from poison, that they had mixed to the spring water. (III 15)

&quot;After that come the Swedes () that rule wide areas up until the &quot;Land of Women&quot; (). Living east of these are said to be Wizzi, Mirri, Lamiy, Scuti and Turci up until the border of Russia ().&quot; (IV 14) 

In the related debate references are sometimes also made to the Finnish epic &quot;Kalevala&quot;, according to which Pohjola was ruled by a woman called Louhi or . The ancient Norse knew the Northern ruler-goddesses by the names (singular: &quot;gýgr&quot;) and (singular: ). There is also a reference to a northern land of women in an Icelandic manuscript from the 14th century, which describes a (&#x27;woman land&#x27;).

===Different theories on the origins of the Kvens===
In 1958, a Finnish historian, politician and University of Helsinki professor, Kustaa Vilkuna, suggested that Kainuu or Kvenland was originally in Southern Finland, on the Gulf of Bothnia and covering just northern Southwest Finland and coastal Satakunta. A small local area called Kalanti ( in Swedish) would have been a remnant of the earlier name Kvenland. Because of the trading and tribute-taking expeditions as well as settlement expansion of the kainulaiset, the territorial concept of Kainuu was gradually moved northward.

Another mid-20th-century historian, Professor Jalmari Jaakkola, considered the Kvens or as long-range hunters and tribute-takers coming from Upper Satakunta, from the inland region surrounding the present-day city of Tampere. This theory was supported by Professor Armas Luukko.

In 1979, Professor Pentti Virrankoski of the University of Turku presented a hypothesis according to which Kainuu was originally the sedentary Iron Age settlement in Southern Ostrobothnia. After the settlement was supposedly destroyed by tribal warfare during the early 9th century, the &quot;&quot; became dispersed along the western coasts of Finland, leaving only place-names and some archaeological finds as permanent traces.

In 1980, the University of Oulu professor Jouko Vahtola pointed out that there is no evidence of the name &quot;Kainuu&quot; being of Western Finnish origin and considered it to have Eastern Finnish roots. However, he suggested a common Germanic etymology for the names Kainuu and Kvenland. Like most of his predecessors, Vahtola viewed Kainuu/Kvenland as the name of the coastal Ostrobothnia, meaning roughly &quot;low-lying land&quot;. Based on the archaeological knowledge of the north, Vahtola did not believe that there was a separate Iron Age tribe called Kvens. He considered the Kvens to be mainly Tavastians hunting and trading in northern Ostrobothnia, thus partially reproducing the view of Jaakkola and Luukko (Upper Satakunta being a part of traditional Tavastia). This theory is nowadays widely adopted in Finland, Sweden and Norway, and it is cited in many studies and popular works.

In 1995 the Finnish linguist Jorma Koivulehto gave support for the theory of common etymological roots of the names &quot;Kainuu&quot; and &quot;Kvenland&quot;. He suggests a new etymology meaning roughly &quot;marine gap-land&quot;, the &quot;marine gap&quot; being the northern sea-route on the Bothnian Gulf.

Increasing archaeological fieldwork in northern Finland has cast some doubts on the idea of Kvenland having almost no sedentary settlements. Encouraged by the new findings, Professor Kyösti Julku of Oulu University presented a theory of the Kvens being early permanent Finnish inhabitants of Northern Finland and Norrbotten (a part of modern-day Sweden).

Some Swedish historians have suggested that the ancient Kvens were actually a Scandinavian and not a Finnish group, but these views have little support nowadays. The Swedish archaeologist Thomas Wallerström suggests that the Kvens/ was a collective name for several Finnic groups participating in the west-east fur-trade, not just southern Finns but ancestors of Karelians and Vepsians as well. In this case, the land of the Kvens would have extended from the Bothnian Gulf in the west to the Lake Onega in the east.

==Kvenland and Kvens later in historical time==

In 1328, Tälje Charter () – the oldest known record written in Swedish – mention the Birkarls (). Based on the information revealed, the Birkarls then inhabited areas, e.g., in Northern Hälsingland, which covered the western coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, and from there all the way up and around the gulf to Oulu River. Tälje Charter is a state treaty ratified between the Kvens and the Swedish crown, in which the king of Sweden guarantees the Birkarl Kvens trading and tax-collecting rights as chief enforcement officers, bailiffs (Swedish term: ), in the North.

In his 1539 map Carta Marina, Swedish Olaus Magnus places Birkarl Kvens () on the Norwegian North Atlantic coast, roughly in the middle in between the archipelago of Lofoten and the modern-day city of Tromsø. In his 1555 &quot;Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus&quot; (A Description of the Northern Peoples), he also mentions both terms: the Finnish traders who commuted between and inhabited the general area of Tornio and the modern-day area of Norway are said to have been called &quot;Kvens&quot;. The earliest remaining Norwegian tax records, stored at the National Archival Services of Norway (), dating to the mid-16th century, also mention Kvens.

Today, the term &quot;Kven&quot; is used in Norway in reference to the descendants of Finnish-speaking people who have inhabited or migrated to the present-day area of Norway anytime before World War II. Migration waves from the 16th century onward have brought Finnish settlers to Northern Norway from the modern-day areas of Northern Sweden and Northern Finland, mostly from the northern coastal areas of the Bay of Bothnia.

==&quot;Kvenland theory&quot;==
Since the 1990s claims have arisen, primarily among some Tornedalians, that Kvens (Tornedalians and Norwegian Kvens) are in fact not only &quot;an&quot; indigenous population, but &quot;the&quot; indigenous population of northern Fennoscandia. These claims coincide with struggles with Sámi over rights to hunting, fishing and reindeer herding in the areas inhabited by both groups. While it is hard to prove without a doubt, a relationship between the ancient Kvens and modern Tornedalians and Kvens is generally believed. The claim that the Sámi are not indigenous is however widely discredited.

The National Association of Swedish Tornedalians (&quot;STR-T&quot;) supports the recognition of Tornedalians, Kvens and Lantalaiset as an indigenous population, but denies the claim that the Sámi are not indigenous. Likewise the Norwegian Kven Organization (&quot;Ruijan kveeniliito&quot;) recognises the indigineity of the Sámi peoples.

<text>Patrick Dacre Trevor-Roper (7 June 1916 – 22 April 2004) was a British eye surgeon, author and pioneer gay rights activist, who played a leading role in the campaign to decriminalise homosexuality in the UK. 

==Life and career==
He was born in Northumberland, the son of a doctor, and the brother of historian Hugh Trevor-Roper. He was educated at Charterhouse, the University of Cambridge and the Westminster Medical School. During his education he bunked next to leading eye surgeon E F King in the hospital air raid shelter, and was inspired by him to pursue ophthalmology. During World War II he served in the Royal New Zealand Army Medical Corps in the Mediterranean. After the war he became a specialist in ophthalmic surgery, and divided his working life between work in public hospitals and a lucrative private practice in London.

In 1945, Trevor-Roper&#x27;s friends Edward Sackville-West, artist and art dealer Eardley Knollys and the music critic Desmond Shawe-Taylor jointly bought Long Crichel House, a Georgian rectory in Long Crichel, Dorset. Trevor-Roper lived there for a time and along with his friends established &quot;one of the last great post-war salons, hosting guests including Sybil Colefax, Anthony Asquith, Graham Sutherland, Lord Berners, Nancy Mitford, Benjamin Britten, Laurie Lee, Ben Nicolson, Cecil Day-Lewis and Graham Greene.&quot;

In 1955 Trevor-Roper agreed to appear as a witness before the Wolfenden Committee which had been appointed by the British government to investigate, among other things, whether male homosexuality should remain a crime. He was one of only three men who could be found to appear as openly gay witnesses before the Committee. The others were the journalist Peter Wildeblood, who had been convicted of a homosexual offence, and Carl Winter, director of the Fitzwilliam Museum. Trevor-Roper and Winter came forward to counteract the bad impression they felt Wildeblood would make.

Trevor-Roper told the Wolfenden Committee that the majority of gay men led normal and well-adjusted lives, posed no threat to children or public morality, and that homosexuality was not a physical or mental illness. He pointed out that the existing laws did nothing but encourage blackmailers. He argued that the age of consent should be lowered to 16, and told the committee that many young gay men committed or attempted suicide because of isolation or depression induced by homophobia.

These were highly controversial views in the 1950s. Trevor-Roper&#x27;s testimony helped persuade the Committee to recommend that male homosexuality should be decriminalised, which was finally done, after a long political struggle, in 1967.

Trevor-Roper remained an active gay rights activist, campaigning in particular for the abolition of the discriminatory age of consent laws. The 1967 law set the age of consent for male homosexuals at 21, while the heterosexual age of consent was 16. When the AIDS epidemic appeared in the early 1980s, Trevor-Roper was one of the founders of the Terrence Higgins Trust, the United Kingdom&#x27;s leading AIDS service organisation, which held its first meeting at his home.

The other cause to which Trevor-Roper devoted himself was better access to ophthalmic medicine, both in the United Kingdom and in African countries. He campaigned successfully for the repeal of British laws which prevented the sale of cheap spectacles, against the resistance of the opticians&#x27; lobby. In 1983, he helped finance Peter Risdon in his successful challenge to the opticians&#x27; monopoly in the UK, a challenge that led directly to the legalisation of the sale of reading glasses without prescription. He founded the Haile Selassie Eye Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and assisted in the founding of similar hospitals in Nigeria and Sierra Leone.

Trevor-Roper was a lover of architecture and active in heritage conservation causes in the United Kingdom at a time when this was not a fashionable cause. He was a founding Trustee of the Spitalfields Historic Buildings Trust and his house was used as the office for the Thirties Society, later the Twentieth Century Society which he helped to found.

In his 1970 book &quot;The World Through Blunted Sight&quot;, he explored how faulty or failing eyesight affected the style and technique of writers and artists. Looking at the effects of myopia, cataracts, colour blindness, squints and total blindness he speculated on what the impact would have been on artists had they worn glasses.

Trevor-Roper was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2003 and with cancer in 2004, and died in April of that year. He was survived by Herman Chan, his partner of many years.

<doc id="655537" wikidata="Q610315" url="?curid=655537" title="Kven people">
<text>Kvens (; ; ; ; ) are a Balto-Finnic ethnic group indigenous to the northern regions of Norway, Sweden, Finland and parts of Russia. In 1996, Kvens were granted minority status in Norway, and in 2005 the Kven language was recognized as a minority language in Norway.

== Name ==
There is a theory among some academic groups that due to the discrimination and suppression by the Norwegian authorities the term &quot;Kven&quot; became derogatory in the late 19th century. Therefore, many Kvens preferred to be called &quot;kainulaiset&quot;. But with the revitalization of the Kven culture in the 1970s, Kvens themselves started using the term. However, even in the 1990s there was a debate whether the Norwegian terms , , or (respectively a Finnish person, Finnish, and of Finnish origin) should be used instead. However, today the term &quot;Kven&quot; is accepted and used, for example, in the name of the Kven organization in Norway, &quot;Norske Kveners Forbund&quot;.

== Demographics ==
The Kvens were registered as a separate group in the Norwegian censuses in the period 1845 to 1930. From the 18th century the Kvens started to comprise a significant part of the population in Northern Norway. In 1845 13.3% of the population in Finnmark, and 3.2% in Troms, considered themselves as Kvens. In 1854 the numbers increased to respectively, 19.9% and 7.0%. The peak was in 1875, with respectively 24.2% and 7.7%. The ratios were reduced to respectively 20.2% and 3.7%, in 1890, and 13.8% and 2.0% in 1900 (all numbers from). In the 1930 census there were 8,215 registered Kvens in Troms and Finnmark. In 1950, 1,439 people reported that they used the Finnish language, in Troms (58 people) and Finnmark (1,381 people).

In 2001, the number of Kvens was estimated to be about 10,000 to 15,000 in a parliamentary inquiry on national minorities in Norway. However, estimating the number of Kvens is difficult since there is no official definition of a Kven. Therefore, other studies have estimated the number of Kvens to be about 50,000–60,000, based on the criteria that at least one grandparent spoke Kven. But many of these may consider themselves to be Norwegian or Sami or a combination.

== History ==
Danish/Norwegian tax records from the 16th century already list some Kvens living in North Norway. Also, the famous map of Scandinavia by Olaus Magnus from 1539 shows a possible Kven settlement roughly in between today&#x27;s Tromsø and Lofoten named &quot;Berkara Qvenar&quot;. Kvens of this time are often connected to the birkarl organization in northern Sweden. In some early documents Kvens are also grouped together with the Sami people, who are the indigenous people of Central and Northern Norway.

== Language ==
The Kven language is a Finnic language. 

Kven differs from Finnish since the Kven population was in effect isolated from other Finnish-speaking people. The Kven language has come to incorporate many Norwegian loanwords, and Finnish words that are no longer used in Finland are still used. In a 2005 government report, the number of people speaking Kven in Norway was estimated to be between 2,000 and 8,000, depending on the criteria used.

Finnish is the preferred language of instruction among the Kvens. 90% of the kids in the county of Troms and Finnmark that had a right to choose between Finnish and Kven chose Finnish.

== Ethnic controversies ==
In the 1990s there was a debate among Kvens whether they should be considered as an ethnic group of their own, or whether they were Finnish Norwegians. As well, during the process of legal recognition of the Kven language, there was a debate as to whether it should be considered an actual language or merely a dialect of Finnish, and whether the Kven language or Kven dialect of Finnish should be taught in schools.

Kven and Sami people share a common history of Norwegianization. However, post-Norwegianization policies have treated them differently. Sami people have been recognized as the indigenous people in Northern Norway. They have their own schools and parliament, and they elect three of the six members for the board of &quot;Finnmark Estate&quot; (the organization owning about 95% of the land in the county of Finnmark). Some Kvens believe the distribution of rights and public funds has favored the Sami people too much, whereas on the Sami side there are people who think the Norwegian minority politics and public funding should focus mostly on the Sami people.

Lately, the Norwegian Kven Organization has attempted to get the Kvens recognized, similarly to the Sami people, as an indigenous people in Norway. This has made it important for some Kvens to show that their history stretches further back in time than commonly believed. There has been some recent unofficial adoption of the word &quot;Kainu&quot; as the new name for &quot;Kven&quot;, in accordance with the hypotheses put forward by Finnish historians Jouko Vahtola and Kyösti Julku. Vahtola has hypothesized that words &quot;Kven&quot; and &quot;Kainu(u)&quot; are interchangeable.

In 2018, The Storting commissioned The Truth and Reconciliation Commission to lay the foundation for recognition of the experiences of the Kven subject to Norwegianization and the subsequent consequences.

== Modern recognition ==
The Kven flag was hoisted at the Kiruna City Hall in Sweden on 16 March 2013, at 11:00, in celebration and honour of the first annual Day of the Kvens. Hereafter, that date is meant to be recognised wider in the Kven communities of the north and by others as well.

The date for the occasion was chosen from the signing in 1328 of a state treaty between Sweden and the Birkarls, known as Tälje Charter (&quot;Tälje stadga&quot; in Swedish). In that treaty, the king of Sweden guaranteed them their trading rights in the north (translation from Latin last printed in 1995, Wallerström, page 48).

In the past, the Kven language spoken in Norway was considered a dialect of Finnish, much like the Finnic Meänkieli language spoken in northern Sweden. Today, both are officially recognised minority languages in the areas where the languages are spoken. Finnish, Meänkieli and Sami are all officially recognised minority languages in the Kiruna Municipality in Sweden.

== Culture and media ==
=== Ruijan Kaiku ===

 is a bi-lingual newspaper (Kven/Finnish and Norwegian) that is published in Tromsø, Norway. Currently one issue is published each month. The newspaper writes mostly about Kven issues, and about the work of strengthening Finnish language and culture in Norway. In addition the paper has stories about other Finnish organizations in Norway, and about other Finnish minorities in the Nordic and surrounding countries. The newspaper&#x27;s Chief editor is Liisa Koivulehto.

=== Baaski festival ===
&quot;&quot; is a Kven culture festival held in Nordreisa Municipality. The first festival was in June 2007, but it is intended to be an annual event. The responsible organizers is Nordreisa municipality, and the first festival director was Johanne Gaup.

=== Kven costume ===
While the Kven costume (&quot;Kväänipuku&quot;) was only &#x27;designed&#x27; in the 1990s and beginning of the 2000s it builds on older Kven fashions and is intended to strengthen Kven identity. Much of it is in a simple white colour, which beyond its historical use serves as a reminder of the reputed cleanliness of the Kvens. The silver-ware is likewise an important part of Kven clothing and the position of &quot;kvensølvesmed&quot; (Norwegian for &#x27;kven silver smith&#x27;) is an important one.

=== Kadonu Loru ===
&quot;Kadonu Loru&quot; is the only pop music single ever recorded in the Kven language. It is based on an old Kven nursery rhyme about making sausages. The artists are Karine Jacobsen and Kine Johansen respectively from Børselv and Lakselv. The single was published by Iđut.

== Organisations and institutions ==
=== The Norwegian Kven organization ===

The Norwegian Kven Organization ( in Kven/Finnish and in Norwegian) was established in 1987, and has currently about 700 members. The organization has local branches in: Skibotn, Børselv, Nord-Varanger, Tana, Lakselv, Alta, northern Troms, Tromsø, and Østlandet.

The tasks of the organisation include working for a government report about the history and rights of the Kven population, improving the media coverage of Kven issues, and for the Norwegian government to establish a secretary () for Kven issues. In addition, reading and writing classes at the beginner to advanced level, establishing a Kven kindergarten, and to incorporate the Kven language in all education levels in Norway. Also, to establish a Kven culture fund, road and other signs in Kven, Kven names in official maps, and museums and centers for Kven language and culture.

=== The Kven Finn Association ===
Kven Finn Association or Kveeni Suomi Liitto in Finnish and Kvensk Finsk Riksforbund in Norwegian is an NGO who works for the rights of the Kven and Finn people in Norway. It was founded together with similar organizations in Sweden and Finland in 1999, that jointly uses the name Kvenlandsförbundet (Kveenimaayhistys). Kvenlandsförbundet created the Kvenflagg. The Kven Finn Association as a part of Kvenlandsförbundet is administrating the participation of the Kven people at the Finno-Ugric World Congress. 

The organization reports to international bodies on how Norway is living up to various International Law conventions. The organization is very much concerned about the discrimination the Norwegian authorities are directing towards the Kvens/FInns and the Saami. 100:1 in favour of the Saami in economic terms, at least. 

Furthermore, the government&#x27;s bad treatment of Finnish as the de-facto ethnic language for the Kvens/Finns. In this regard, the Kven Finn Association has started a grant for young students in high school to motivate more young people to learn Finnish (Finnish, Kven, or even Meänkieli).

The Kven Finn Association has local chapters all over Norway and is also active regarding reviving the folk music traditions and documenting the history of Finnish speaking people throughout Fennoscandinavia.

=== The Kven institute ===

The Kven institute ( in Kven/Finnish and in Norwegian) is a center for Kven culture and language located in Børselv in Porsangi Municipality (Porsanger) in Norway.

===Kven Language Board===
The Kven Language Board that was established in April 2007. It consists of the leader Irene Andreassen, Terje Aronsen, Prof. Anna Riitta Lindgren, Assoc. Prof. Eira Söderholm, and Pia Lane. The first task is to create a standard for written Kven language.

=== Halti kvenkultursenter ===
Halti kvenkultursenter is located in Nordreisa Municipality.

=== Ruija Kven museum ===
The Ruija Kven Museum is located in Vadsø.

<doc id="655546" wikidata="Q207848" url="?curid=655546" title="Arnica montana">
<text>Arnica montana, also known as wolf&#x27;s bane, leopard&#x27;s bane, mountain tobacco and mountain arnica, is a moderately toxic European flowering plant in the daisy family Asteraceae that has a large yellow flower head. The names &quot;wolf&#x27;s bane&quot; and &quot;leopard&#x27;s bane&quot; are also used for another plant, &quot;Aconitum&quot;, which is extremely poisonous.

&quot;Arnica montana&quot; has been used as a herbal medicine, but there is insufficient clinical evidence for its therapeutic use, and it is toxic when taken internally or applied to injured skin.

==Description==

&quot;Arnica montana&quot; is a flowering plant about tall aromatic fragrant, herbaceous perennial. Its basal green ovate leaves with rounded tips are bright coloured and level to the ground. In addition, they are somewhat downy on their upper surface, veined and aggregated in rosettes. By contrast, the upper leaves are opposed, spear-shaped and smaller which is an exception within the Asteraceae. The chromosome number is 2n=38.

The flowering season is between May and August (Central Europe). The flower heads are composed of orange-yellow disc florets in the centre which are externally bordered by 10 to 15 yellow ray florets. The achenes have a one-piece rough pappus which opens in dry conditions. &quot;Arnica montana&quot; is a hemicryptophyte, which helps the plant to survive the extreme overwintering condition of its habitat. In addition, &quot;Arnica&quot; forms rhizomes, which grow in a two-year cycle: the rosette part grows at its front while its tail is slowly dying.

==Taxonomy==
The Latin specific epithet &quot;montana&quot; refers to mountains or coming from mountains.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Arnica montana&quot; is widespread across most of Europe. It is absent from the Celtic Isles and the Italian and Balkan peninsulas. In addition, it is considered extinct in Hungary and Lithuania. &quot;Arnica montana&quot; grows in nutrient-poor siliceous meadows or clay soils. It mostly grows on alpine meadows and up to nearly . In more upland regions, it may also be found on nutrient-poor moors and heaths. However Arnica does not grow on lime soil, thus it is an extremely reliable bioindicator for nutrient poor and acidic soils. It is rare overall, but may be locally abundant. It is becoming rarer, particularly in the north of its distribution, largely due to increasingly intensive agriculture and commercial wildcrafting (foraging). Nevertheless, it is cultivated on a large scale in Estonia.

==Chemical constituents==

The main constituents of &quot;Arnica montana&quot; are essential oils, fatty acids, thymol, pseudoguaianolide sesquiterpene lactones and flavanone glycosides. Pseudoguaianolide sesquiterpenes constitute 0.2–0.8% of the flower head of &quot;Arnica montana&quot;. They are the toxin helenalin and their fatty esters. 2,5-Dimethoxy-p-cymene and thymol methyl ether are the primary components of essential oils from both the plant&#x27;s roots and rhizomes. The quality and chemical constitution of the plant substance Arnicae flos can be monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Arnica montana&quot; is propagated from seed. Generally, 20% of seeds do not germinate. For large scale planting, it is recommended to raise plants first in a nursery and then to transplant them in the field. Seeds sprout in 14–20 days but germination rate depends highly on the seed quality. Planting density for &quot;Arnica montana&quot; is of 20 plants/m2 such that the maximum yield density will be achieved in the second flowering season. While &quot;Arnica montana&quot; has high exigencies of soil quality, analyses should be done before any fertilizer input.

The flowers are harvested when fully developed and dried without their bract nor receptacles. The roots can be harvested in autumn and dried as well after being carefully washed.

&quot;Arnica montana&quot; is sometimes grown in herb gardens.

==Use in herbal medicine==
&quot;Arnica montana&quot; has been used as a herbal medicine. When used as a topical medication in a gel at 50% concentration, &quot;A. montana&quot; was found to have the same effectiveness (albeit with possibly worse side effects) as a 5% ibuprofen gel for treating the symptoms of hand osteoarthritis. A 2014 review found that &quot;A. montana&quot; was ineffective at concentrations of 10% or less for pain, swelling, and bruises. A 1998 review of homeopathic &quot;A. montana&quot; (all homeopathic preparations, as normal, were so diluted that they contained none of the plant) found it is no more effective than a placebo.

===Toxicity===
The US Food and Drug Administration has classified &quot;Arnica montana&quot; as an unsafe herb because of its toxicity. It should not be taken orally or applied to broken skin where absorption can occur. &quot;Arnica&quot; irritates mucous membranes and may elicit stomach pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. It may produce contact dermatitis when applied to skin.

&quot;Arnica montana&quot; contains the toxin helenalin, which can be poisonous if large amounts of the plant are eaten or small amounts of concentrated Arnica are used. Consumption of &quot;A. montana&quot; can produce severe gastroenteritis, internal bleeding of the digestive tract, raised liver enzymes (which can indicate inflammation of the liver), nervousness, accelerated heart rate, muscular weakness, and death if enough is ingested. Contact with the plant can also cause skin irritation. In the Ames test, an extract of &quot;A. montana&quot; was found to be mutagenic.

==Market==
The demand for &quot;A. montana&quot; is 50 tonnes per year in Europe, but the supply does not cover the demand. The plant is rare; it is protected in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and in some regions of Switzerland. France and Romania produce &quot;A. montana&quot; for the international market. Changes in agriculture in Europe during the last decades have led to a decline in the occurrence of &quot;A. montana&quot;. Extensive agriculture has been replaced by intensive management.

<doc id="655563" wikidata="Q1663054" url="?curid=655563" title="Ingestion">
<text>Ingestion is the consumption of a substance by an organism. In animals, it normally is accomplished by taking in a substance through the mouth into the gastrointestinal tract, such as through eating or drinking. In single-celled organisms, ingestion takes place by absorbing a substance through the cell membrane.

Besides nutritional items, substances that may be ingested include medication (where ingestion is termed oral administration), recreational drugs, and substances considered inedible, such as foreign bodies or excrement. Ingestion is a common route taken by pathogenic organisms and poisons entering the body.

Ingestion can also refer to a mechanism picking up something and making it enter an internal hollow of that mechanism, e.g. &quot;a grille was fitted to prevent the pump from ingesting driftwood&quot;.

==Pathogens==
Some pathogens are transmitted via ingestion, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Most commonly, this takes place via the faecal-oral route. An intermediate step is often involved, such as drinking water contaminated by faeces or food prepared by workers who fail to practice adequate hand-washing, and is more common in regions where untreated sewage is common. Diseases transmitted via the fecal-oral route include hepatitis A, polio, and cholera.

Some pathogenic organisms are typically ingested by other routes. 
* Larvae of the parasite &quot;Trichinella&quot; encyst within muscles and are transmitted when a new host eats the infected flesh of a former host animal.
* The parasite &quot;Dracunculus&quot; is ingested in drinking water, which is contaminated with larvae released as the parasite emerges from the host&#x27;s skin.
* The bacterium &quot;Salmonella&quot; most commonly infects humans via consumption of undercooked eggs.

==Foreign objects==

Disk batteries, also called button cells, are often mistakenly ingested, particularly by children and the elderly. They may be mistaken for a medication pill because of their size and shape, or they may be swallowed after being held in the mouth while the battery is being changed. Battery ingestion can cause medical problems including blocked airway, vomiting, irritability, persistent drooling, and rash (due to nickel metal allergy).

==Abnormal ingestion==
Pica is an abnormal appetite for non-nutritive objects or for food items in a form not normally eaten, such as flour. Coprophagia is the consumption of feces, an abnormal ingestive behavior common in some animals.

<text>The Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science (MSMS) is Mississippi&#x27;s only public residential high school for academically gifted students and is located in Columbus, Mississippi, United States, on the campus of the Mississippi University for Women. A member of the National Consortium for Secondary STEM Schools, it is a statewide public magnet school.

Tenth-grade students are selected to attend through a competitive application process that includes standardized test scores, a written application, and an interview. The school enrolls students in the last two years of high school graduating over 100 students each year. In 2021, the school produced 21 National Merit Semifinalists. While the main academic focus of MSMS is mathematics and science, humanities, particularly history, literature, and art are also emphasized.

==History==
Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science was founded in 1987 by appropriations from the Mississippi Legislature and was the fourth public, residential high school for academically gifted students created in the United States.

As a public, residential high school, drawing students from all over the state, MSMS has occasionally struggled for existence. The property tax has been the sole form of finance for most schools in Mississippi. However, MSMS which draws students from all over the state, cannot levy a millage tax as a source of funding. It relies on grants as well as state, student, and alumni contributions.

Starting in 2008, the Mississippi Legislature required MSMS and its sister school, the Mississippi School of the Arts, to charge students $500 per semester for room and board costs, making them the only public schools in the state that charge students to attend. However, if a student is eligible for free or reduced lunch in their home district, then this fee is waived.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, MSMS transitioned to an online-learning environment, beginning at the end of March 2020, using Zoom and other telecommunications services. During the 2020–2021 academic year, the school utilized a hybrid learning environment, allowing some students to remain virtual while others attended in-person classes and lived on campus with quarantining restrictions.

<doc id="655569" wikidata="Q934089" url="?curid=655569" title="Rodion Raskolnikov">
<text>Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov (pre-reform Russian: ; post-reform ) is the fictional protagonist of the 1866 novel &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. The name Raskolnikov derives from the Russian &quot;raskolnik&quot; meaning &quot;schismatic&quot; (traditionally referring to a member of the Old Believer movement). The name &quot;Rodion&quot; comes from Greek and indicates an inhabitant of Rhodes.

Raskolnikov is a young ex-law student living in extreme poverty in Saint Petersburg. He lives in a tiny garret which he rents, although due to a lack of funds has been avoiding payment for quite some time. He sleeps on a couch using old clothes as a pillow, and due to lack of money eats very rarely. He is handsome and intelligent, though generally disliked by fellow students. He is devoted to his sister (Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikova) and his mother (Pulkheria Alexandrovna Raskolnikova).

==Plot ==

An impoverished student with a conflicted idea of himself, Raskolnikov (Rodya as his mother calls him) decides to kill a corrupt pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, with whom he has been dealing, with the idea of using the money to start his life all over, and to help those who are in need of it. It is later revealed that he also commits the murder as justification for his pride, as he wants to prove that he is &quot;exceptional&quot; in the way Napoleon was. He commits the murder, but he is so nervous during the crime that he makes a few mistakes, and he is afraid that he will be caught.

Raskolnikov finds a small purse on Alyona Ivanovna&#x27;s body, which he hides under a rock without checking its contents. After he confesses to the destitute, pious prostitute Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladova, she guides him towards turning himself in to the police. Raskolnikov is sentenced to exile in Siberia, accompanied by Sofya Semyonovna, where he experiences a psychological and spiritual rebirth.

==Cinema and television==
In film, Raskolnikov was portrayed for the first time by Derwent Hall Caine in the 1917 silent film directed by Lawrence B. McGill. Gregori Chmara portrayed him in another silent adaptation &quot;Raskolnikov&quot;, directed by Robert Wiene (1923). He was portrayed by Peter Lorre in Josef von Sternberg&#x27;s Hollywood film version (1935), by John Hurt in a 1979 BBC mini-series adaptation, by Patrick Dempsey in a 1998 television movie, and by Georgy Taratorkin (1969), John Simm (2002), and Crispin Glover (2002). The character of Michel in Robert Bresson&#x27;s &quot;Pickpocket&quot; (1959) is based on Raskolnikov. Paul Schrader, who wrote &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), was in turn inspired by Bresson&#x27;s Michel character to create Travis Bickle, Robert De Niro&#x27;s antihero. Woody Allen&#x27;s 2005 British psychological thriller &quot;Match Point&quot; is partly intended as a debate with &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;: protagonist Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is seen early on reading the book and identifying with Raskolnikov, and ultimately murders two people, a crime for which he narrowly escapes justice.

<text>The Commodore SX-64, also known as the Executive 64, or VIP-64 in Europe, is a portable, briefcase/suitcase-size &quot;luggable&quot; version of the popular Commodore 64 home computer and the first color portable computer.

The SX-64 features a built-in five-inch composite monitor and a built-in 1541 floppy drive. It weighs (). The machine is carried by its sturdy handle, which doubles as an adjustable stand. It was announced in January 1983 and released eleven months later in December 1983, at $995 USD ().

== Description ==
Aside from its built-in features and different form factor, there are several other differences between the SX-64 and the regular C64. The default screen color is changed to blue text on a white background for improved readability on the smaller screen. This can cause compatibility problems with programs that assume the C64&#x27;s default blue background. The default device for load and save operations is changed to the floppy drive.

The Datasette (cassette) port and RF port were omitted from the SX-64. Because it has a built-in disk drive and monitor, Commodore did not perceive a need for a tape drive or television connector. However, the lack of a Datasette port poses a problem for a number of C64 Centronics parallel printer interfaces, since several popular designs &quot;borrowed&quot; their +5V power supply from the port. This was not an issue for later interfaces which were supplied with an AC adapter power supply, or those which can use the +5V line supplied by the Centronics port (Pin #18) on the printer itself, if the printer implements it. Alternatively, a +5V supply is also available from the joystick ports.

The audio/video port is still present, so an external monitor can still be used; it displays the same content as the built-in monitor. Differences, electrically and in placement on the board, means that there are compatibility problems with some C64 cartridges.

The original SX-64&#x27;s (built in) power supply limits the machine&#x27;s expandability.

Compatibility with Commodore RAM Expansion Units varies. Early SX-64 power supplies cannot handle the extra power consumption from the REU. The physical placement of the cartridge port can prevent the REU from seating properly. The 1700 and 1750, 128K and 512K units intended for the C128, are said to work more reliably with the SX-64 than the 1764 unit that was intended for the regular C64. Some SX-64 owners modify Commodore REUs to use an external power supply in order to get around the power supply issues.
IDE64 is also non-compatible at the present time. When it is powered up, the screen sends out the C64 breadbin &quot;blue&quot; background with the typical codice_1, and immediately under the codice_2 prompt a statement of codice_3 is displayed.

A version of the SX-64 with dual floppy drives, known as the DX-64, was announced, but the press reported by early 1985 that plans for its release had been suspended. A few have been reported to exist , but it is very rare. Instead of an extra floppy drive, a modem could also be built in above the first drive. Some hobbyists installed a second floppy drive themselves in the SX-64&#x27;s empty drive slot. Later models of the SX-64 use the larger power supply intended for use with the DX-64.

At around the same time the SX-64 was announced in January 1983, a version with a monochrome screen called the SX-100 was announced. Despite releasing plans by June 1983, it was never released.

==History==
The SX-64 did not sell well, and its failure has been variously attributed to its small screen, excessive weight (), poor marketing, and smaller business software library than that of its competitors, which included the Osborne 1 and Kaypro II (Zilog Z80 CPU, CP/M OS) and Compaq Portable (16-bit CPU, MS-DOS).

The exact number of SX-64 sold from 1984 to 1986, when it was discontinued, is unknown. The serial numbers of over 130 SX-64s from series GA1, GA2, GA4, GA5 and GA6, with serial numbers ranging over 49,000 for series GA1, 1,000 for GA2, 17,000 for GA4, 11,000 for GA5, and 7,000 for GA6 have been reported

Some would-be buyers waited instead for the announced DX-64, which never became widely available due to the slow sales of the SX-64, creating a Catch 22 situation similar to that endured by Osborne after announcing an improved version of its computer. The SX-64 did however gain a following with user groups and software developers, who could quickly pack and unpack the machine to use for copying software or giving demonstrations.

==Reception==
&quot;Ahoy!&quot; favorably reviewed the SX-64, stating that the keyboard was better than the 64&#x27;s, the monitor &quot;isn&#x27;t hard to read at all&quot;, and the disk drive was durable enough for travel. While criticizing the lack of any provision for internal or external battery power, the magazine concluded that the average $750–800 retail price was &quot;worth every penny!&quot;.

== Technical information ==
Like the Commodore 64, except for the following differences:
* Built-in storage: drive (internal version of the Commodore 1541)
* Built-in display: 5&quot; inch () composite color monitor (CRT)
* Keyboard: Separate unit, connected by cord to CPU unit
* Cartridge port: Placed on top of CPU unit, w/spring-loaded fold-in lid, cartridges inserted vertically (vs horizontally into back of C64)
* I/O connectors:
** Serial &quot;488&quot; interface (rear)
** Video out connector (rear)
** User Port (rear)
** Cartridge Port (beneath two spring-loaded flaps on the case top)
** No Datassette interface
** No RF modulator &amp; connector
** Non-standard 25-pin keyboard connector below right side of front panel. The connectors are similar but not identical to D-subminiature connectors and notoriously hard to find today
** Standard three-prong IEC C14 AC power connector (vs C64 DIN plug to &quot;power brick&quot; PSU)
* Power supply: Internal unit with transformer and rectifiers (vs external C64 PSU)
* Extra features: Floppy disk storage compartment above disk drive which could be used to build in an extra floppy drive or compatible sized modem
