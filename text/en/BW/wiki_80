<text>Álvaro Alberto Espinoza Ramírez (born February 19, 1962) is a Venezuelan former shortstop in Major League Baseball. He batted and threw right-handed.

==Early life==
Born in Valencia, Carabobo, he graduated from Pedro Gual High School where he played baseball, soccer and basketball.

==Playing career==
As a young prospect, Espinoza was let go by the Houston Astros system. But he went on to have twelve decent seasons with the Minnesota Twins (1984–1986), New York Yankees (1988–1991), Cleveland Indians (1993–1996), New York Mets (1996) and Seattle Mariners (1997).

Although a free swinger, Espinoza was a good bat handler and contact hitter. His game was to simply put the ball in play and not try to hit for power. As a baserunner, he had average speed.

Probably, he was not among the most gifted athletes ever to play shortstop, but he positioned himself extremely well and got to many balls that might have eluded some flashier shortstops. A sure-handed fielder, he had a strong throwing arm and found many ways to turn a double play, as well as his concentration and knowledge of the game were his main assets.

In a 12-season career, Espinoza hit a .254 average with 22 home runs and 201 RBI in 942 games, including 252 runs, 105 doubles, nine triples, and 13 stolen bases.

Espinoza&#x27;s was one of New York Yankees public address announcer Bob Sheppard&#x27;s favorite names to announce.

He was also noted for his bubble gum hat antics, as well as other practical jokes he and teammate Wayne Kirby used to play on the 1995 Cleveland Indians.

==Coaching career==
Following his playing career after the 1997 season, Espinoza turned to coaching. In 1998, he worked with the Montreal Expos as their minor league infield coordinator.

Hired by the Los Angeles Dodgers organization, Espinoza made his managerial debut in 1999 and guided Class-A Vero Beach to a 48–85 record in the Florida State League. He spent 2000 and 2001 as the Dodgers Minor League Roving Infield Coordinator.

In 2002, Espinoza was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates and then named their infield Instructor in 2004.

<text>Kirschwasser (, , ; German for &#x27;cherry water&#x27;), or just Kirsch (; the term used in Switzerland and France, less so in Germany), is a clear, colourless brandy from Germany, Switzerland, and France, traditionally made from double distillation of morello cherries. It is now also made from other kinds of cherries. The cherries are fermented completely, including their stones. Unlike cherry liqueurs and cherry brandies, &quot;Kirschwasser&quot; is not sweet. It is sometimes distilled from fermented cherry juice.

==Serving==
&quot;Kirschwasser&quot; is usually drunk neat. It is traditionally served cold in a very small glass and is taken as an apéritif. It is an important ingredient in fondue. People in the German-speaking region where it originated usually serve it after dinner, as a digestif.

&quot;Kirschwasser&quot; is used in some cocktails, such as the Ladyfinger, the Florida, and the Rose.

High-quality &quot;kirschwasser&quot; should be served around , warmed by the hands as with brandy.

==Origin and production==

Because morellos were originally grown in the Black Forest regions of Germany, &quot;kirschwasser&quot; is believed to have originated there. &quot;Kirschwasser&quot; is colourless because it is either not aged in wood or was aged in barrels made of ash. It may have been aged in paraffin-lined wood barrels or earthenware vessels. Rivals in producing high quality &quot;&quot;Kirsch&quot; is Switzerland and Alsace; the latter even has a &quot;kirschwasser&quot; route, and other quality cherry-production, German-speaking areas like South Tyrolia.
In France and English-speaking countries, clear fruit brandies are known as &quot;eau de vie&quot;. The European Union sets a minimum of 37.5% ABV (75 proof) for products of this kind; &quot;kirschwasser&quot; typically has an alcohol content of 40%–50% ABV (80–100 proof). About 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of cherries go into the making of a 750  ml bottle of &quot;kirschwasser&quot;.

One French variety, &quot;Kirsch de Fougerolles&quot;&quot;,&quot; and two Swiss varieties, Zuger Kirsch and Rigi Kirsch, have been certified as &quot;appellation d&#x27;origine protégée&quot; (AOP).

==Chemical composition==
Compared with brandy or whisky, the characteristic features of &quot;kirsch&quot; are that it contains relatively large quantities of higher alcohols and compound ethers, and the presence in this spirit of small quantities of hydrogen cyanide, partly as such and partly in combination as benzaldehyde-cyanohydrin, to which the distinctive flavour of kirsch is largely due.

==Food==

&quot;Kirsch&quot; is used in some cakes, notably traditional German (Black Forest gateau), and .

It is also sometimes used in Swiss fondue and the dessert, cherries jubilee.

Kirsch can also be used as a filling of chocolates. A typical kirsch chocolate consists of no more than one milliliter of kirsch, surrounded by milk or (more usually) dark chocolate with a film of hard sugar between the two parts, which acts as an impermeable casing for the liquid content and compensates for the lack of sweetness typical of &quot;kirsch&quot;. Manufacturers include Swiss chocolatiers Lindt &amp; Sprüngli and Camille Bloch.

<doc id="654128" wikidata="Q12544101" url="?curid=654128" title="Novelty">
<text>Novelty (derived from Latin word &quot;novus&quot; for &quot;new&quot;) is the quality of being new, or following from that, of being striking, original or unusual. Novelty may be the shared experience of a new cultural phenomenon or the subjective perception of an individual.

From the meaning of being unusual usage is derived the concept of the novelty dance (a type of dance that is popular for being unusual or humorous); the novelty song (a musical item that capitalizes on something new, unusual, or a current fad); the novelty show (a competition or display in which exhibits or specimens are in way some novel); and novelty architecture (a building or other structure that is interesting because it has an amusing design). It is also this sense that applies to a novelty item, a small manufactured adornment, toy or collectible. These, in turn are often used as promotional merchandise in marketing. The chess term, novelty, is used for a move in chess which has never been played before in a recorded game.

The term can have pejorative sense and refer to a mere &quot;innovation&quot;. However, novelty in patent law is part of the legal test to determine whether an invention is patentable. A novelty effect is the tendency for performance to initially improve when new technology is instituted.

<doc id="654131" wikidata="Q449525" url="?curid=654131" title="Chas Chandler">
<text>Bryan James &quot;Chas&quot; Chandler (18 December 1938 – 17 July 1996) was an English musician, record producer and manager, best known as the original bassist in The Animals, for which he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. He also managed the band Slade, and Jimi Hendrix, about whom he was regularly interviewed until his death in 1996.

==Early life==
Bryan James Chandler was born in Heaton, Newcastle. After leaving school, he worked as a turner in the Tyneside shipyards. He became the bass player with The Alan Price Trio in 1962.

== Career ==

===The Animals===
After Eric Burdon joined the band, the Alan Price Trio was renamed The Animals. Chandler&#x27;s bass lines were rarely given critical attention but some, including the opening riff of the group&#x27;s 1965 hit &quot;We Gotta Get Out of This Place&quot; subsequently received praise. Chandler was also the most prominent of the group&#x27;s backing vocalists and did occasional songwriting with Burdon. In 1966, despite commercial success, Chandler became disillusioned with the lack of money, recalling that, &quot;We toured non-stop for three years, doing 300 gigs a year and we hardly got a penny.&quot;

==== Reunions ====
In 1977, Chandler played and recorded with the original members of The Animals during a brief reunion and he joined them again for a further revival in 1983, at which point he sold his business interests, in order to concentrate on being a musician.

Chandler, with all but lead singer Eric Burdon of the classic members, was present at the band&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

===Jimi Hendrix and Slade===
After The Animals underwent personnel changes in 1966, Chandler turned to becoming a talent scout, artist manager, and record producer. During his final tour with The Animals, Chandler saw a then-unknown Jimi Hendrix play in Cafe Wha?, a Greenwich Village, New York City, nightclub. At the time Hendrix was performing under the name Jimmy James. In September, Chandler convinced Hendrix to accompany him to Britain, which was made possible with the help of Michael Jeffery, who suggested that he revert to his actual name, and later suggested naming the band the Jimi Hendrix Experience. In Britain, Chandler recruited bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell as the other members of the Experience. Chandler&#x27;s enthusiasm helped fuel Hendrix during the early days, but halfway through the recording of Hendrix&#x27;s third album in 1968, &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; personality clashes and creative tensions led to the end of their professional relationship.

Chandler was a key figure in Hendrix&#x27;s rise to critical and commercial success. Chandler provided the young musician with living accommodations and financed the Experience&#x27;s first single &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, before they had a recording contract. He was also instrumental in introducing Hendrix to Eric Clapton. It was through this introduction that Hendrix was given the opportunity to play with Clapton and Cream on stage. It was Chandler&#x27;s idea for Hendrix to set his guitar on fire, which made national news when this idea was used at a concert at the Finsbury Park Astoria Theatre and subsequently at the Monterey Pop festival. Hendrix&#x27;s sound engineer Eddie Kramer later recalled that Chandler was very hands-on with the first two Hendrix albums, adding that &quot;he [Chandler] was his [Hendrix&#x27;s] mentor and I think it was very necessary.&quot;

By 1968, Chandler had become frustrated with the recording sessions for Hendrix&#x27;s album &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot;, saying they were self-indulgent. He left management services in the hands of Jeffery during the following year. Chandler then managed and produced the British rock band Slade for 12 years, during which they achieved six number one chart hits in the UK. Chandler and Slade parted company following the failure of the single &quot;Knuckle Sandwich Nancy&quot; in May 1981. He would, however negotiate their RCA contract which lasted for four new albums.

===Expansion of music industry interests===
Chandler bought IBC Studios which he renamed Portland Recording Studios, after the studio address of 35 Portland Place, London and ran it for four years until he sold it to Don Arden. Chandler also ran a series of record labels from the studios including Barn Records, Six of the Best and Cheapskate Records. He formed a music publishing agency, as well as a production company and management companies. He also had a brief stint in which he produced the US rock group Horsepower, founded by in 1978.

===Other business ventures===
During the early 1990s, he helped finance the development of Newcastle Arena, a 10,000 seat sports and entertainment venue which opened in 1995.

==Personal life==
Chandler married twice and had a son by his first wife and a son and two daughters by his second wife Madeleine.

Chandler stood tall.

==Death==
Chandler died of an aortic aneurysm at Newcastle General Hospital on 17 July 1996.

== Honours ==
* Chandler was posthumously inducted into Hollywood&#x27;s Rock Walk of Fame in May 2001 as a member of The Animals.
* Chandler&#x27;s former home at 35 Second Avenue, Heaton, hosts a blue plaque placed on the wall by Newcastle City Council, which reads: &quot;Chas Chandler 1938–1996. Founder member of the &#x27;Animals&#x27;. Manager of Jimi Hendrix &amp; Slade. Co-founder of Newcastle Arena. Lived in this house 1938–1964.&quot;

<text>Hal Evan Sutton (born April 28, 1958) is an American professional golfer, currently playing on the PGA Tour Champions, who achieved 14 victories on the PGA Tour, including the 1983 PGA Championship (a major championship) and the 1983 and 2000 Players Championships. Sutton was also the PGA Tour&#x27;s leading money winner in 1983 and named Player of the Year.

==Professional career==
Born and raised in Shreveport, Louisiana, Sutton was a promising player at its Centenary College, and was named &quot;Golf Magazine&quot;&#x27;s 1980 College Player of the Year. At Centenary, Sutton won 14 golf tournaments, was an All American, led the Gents to the NCAA Tournament, and finished ninth nationally. He quickly established himself as one of the PGA Tour&#x27;s top young stars in the early 1980s. His first win was at the 1982 Walt Disney World Golf Classic in a playoff with Bill Britton after the two had tied at 19-under-par 269 after 72 holes.

Sutton&#x27;s most notable year came in 1983, when he won the Tournament Players Championship in March, followed by his only major title, the PGA Championship at Riviera in August. He entered into a long drought shortly thereafter, going from 1987 to 1994 without a PGA Tour victory. He nearly lost his tour card late in the string, maintaining it only by using a one-time-only exemption for players in the top 50 of the all-time PGA Tour career money list. After this disappointing eight years, Sutton rejuvenated his career in 1995 with a win at the B.C. Open.

In 1998, Sutton won the Valero Texas Open and the prestigious Tour Championship to finish fifth on the PGA Tour money list. Other than his spectacular 1983 season, Sutton had his best year to date in 2000 by beating Tiger Woods in the final group of The Players Championship to win. He also had an additional win to that—the Greater Greensboro Chrysler Classic two starts later. He would go on to finish fourth on the PGA Tour money list. In 2001, Sutton made the cut in 22 of 26 events with one victory at the Shell Houston Open at TPC at The Woodlands and a season winnings total of $1.7 million.

Sutton ranked in the top 10 of the Official World Golf Rankings for over 50 weeks from their debut in 1986 to 1987 and then again for over 50 weeks between 1999 and 2001. He has reached the top five of the rankings.

After playing on four U.S. Ryder Cup teams (1985, 1987, 1999, 2002), he was named non-playing captain of the team for 2004. The competition, played at Oakland Hills Country Club, saw Europe beat the US by 18½ to 9½ points. Inevitably, Sutton came in for some criticism of his performance as captain, especially for his decision to pair Tiger Woods with Phil Mickelson on the first day of play.

In 2007, Sutton received the Payne Stewart Award for his charitable efforts, which include the establishment of the Christus Schumpert Sutton Children&#x27;s Hospital in his hometown of Shreveport. He also teamed up with Louisianans Kelly Gibson and David Toms to raise more than $2 million in aid to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita victims. Sutton was also awarded the Omar N. Bradley Spirit of Independence Award in 2004 and the Golf Writers Association of America&#x27;s 2006 Charlie Bartlett Award with Gibson and Toms for their relief efforts.

Sutton became eligible to play on the Champions Tour in April 2008 and his best finish is a tie for third at the Outback Steakhouse Pro-Am in 2009.

==Personal life==
Sutton is a Republican, having donated money to several GOP causes. He has four children.

<text>Kenneth Edward Batcher (December 27, 1935 – August 22, 2019) was an American academic who was emeritus professor of Computer Science at Kent State University. He also worked as a computer architect at Goodyear Aerospace in Akron, Ohio for 28 years.

==Background==
Kenneth Edward Batcher was born on December 27, 1935 in Queens, New York, to Lois and Ralph Batcher. His parents met at Iowa State University and later relocated to New York City after graduation. His father, Ralph R. Batcher, was the Chief Engineer of The A. H. Grebe Radio Company until its bankruptcy in 1932.

Batcher graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School, and then from Iowa State University with B.E. degree in 1957. In 1964, Batcher received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois.

Batcher died in Stow, Ohio on August 22, 2019, at the age of 83.

==Career and achievements==
Among the designs he worked on at Goodyear were the:

* Massively Parallel Processor (16,384 custom bit-serial processors {8 to a chip} organized in a SIMD 128 x 128 processor array with additional CPU rows for fault-tolerance) which was located at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and is now in the Smithsonian. This unit predates Danny Hillis&#x27; Thinking Machines Corporation&#x27;s Connection Machine
* The Goodyear STARAN associative processor arrays, a version of which (called ASPRO) was found in the US Navy Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye radar planes.

Batcher published several technical papers and owns 14 patents of his own. &quot;He discovered two parallel sorting algorithms: the odd-even mergesort and the bitonic mergesort&quot;. He is also a discoverer of scrambling data method in a random access memory which allows accesses along multiple dimensions. These memories were used in the STARAN and the MPP parallel processors.

==Awards==
In 1980, he received an &quot;Arnstein Award&quot; presented by Goodyear Aerospace Corporation for technical achievement.

In 1990, Batcher was awarded the ACM/IEEE Eckert-Mauchly Award for his pioneering work on parallel computers. He holds 14 patents.

In 2007, Batcher was awarded the IEEE Seymour Cray Computer Engineering Award; &quot;For fundamental theoretical and practical contributions to massively parallel computation, including parallel sorting algorithms, interconnection networks, and pioneering designs of the STARAN and MPP computers.&quot;

Batcher is credited with discovering two important parallel sorting algorithms: the odd-even mergesort and the bitonic mergesort.

Batcher is known for his half-serious, half-humorous definition that &quot;A supercomputer is a device for turning compute-bound problems into I/O-bound problems.&quot;

<text>Wade Jeremy William Robson (born 17 September 1982) is an Australian dancer and choreographer. He began performing as a dancer at age five, and has directed music videos and world tours for pop acts such as NSYNC and Britney Spears. Robson was the host and executive producer of &quot;The Wade Robson Project&quot;, which aired on MTV in 2003. In 2007, he joined the Fox television dance series &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; as a guest judge and choreographer. He won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography for the dance number &quot;Ramalama (Bang Bang)&quot; of &quot;So You Think You Can Dance.&quot;

When Robson was a child, he was befriended by the pop singer Michael Jackson. In 1993, when Jackson was first accused of child sexual abuse, Robson, aged 10, told police that nothing sexual had happened between them. In 2005, during Jackson&#x27;s trial, Robson stated under oath that Jackson had never behaved inappropriately. However, in 2013, Robson reversed his position and filed a late creditor claim and a civil lawsuit against the Jackson estate, saying that Jackson had abused him from 1990 to 1997, when Robson was aged between seven and 14. His case is currently before a California court as &quot;Robson v. MJJ Productions&quot;. He detailed his allegations in the 2019 documentary &quot;Leaving Neverland&quot;.

==Career==
===Early career===
Robson was in a talent troupe called Johnny Young&#x27;s Talent School, and the group did 14 shows a week, usually at venues like shopping malls. When he was nine, Robson moved to the United States with his mother and sister. Michael Jackson assisted them in the move and recruited Robson to appear in three music videos: &quot;Black or White&quot;, &quot;Jam&quot;, and &quot;Heal the World&quot;.

At the age of 11, Robson had an agent. Along with friend DeWayne Turrentine, he formed the hip-hop duo Quo and by the end of the year released an album on Jackson&#x27;s MJJ Music label through Epic/SME Records. The following year, he was teaching dance classes in Hollywood. He formed a troupe of dancing children, which performed internationally. He received his first choreography job for the R&amp;B group Immature at 14. The job led to others for artists such as Britney Spears. Clients were sometimes reluctant to take direction from Robson, a self-described &quot;skinny little white kid&quot;. When Spears first interviewed Robson to choreograph her tour, she exclaimed, &quot;He&#x27;s a friggin&#x27; baby!&quot;; she had expected him to be in his 30s or 40s.

During the late 1990s, while still a teenager, Robson choreographed Spears&#x27;s Pepsi commercials, including one which aired during Super Bowl 35. He choreographed the performance by NSYNC and Spears at the 1999 Video Music Awards and he co-directed Spears&#x27;s 1999–2000 world tours as well as NSYNC&#x27;s 2000 &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; Tour. In 2001, he choreographed Spears&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m a Slave 4 U&quot; video and was choreographer and director of NSYNC&#x27;s 2001 PopOdyssey Tour. In the NSYNC music video &quot;Pop&quot;, Robson had to fill in for NSYNC member Joey Fatone during several of the dance sequences because of an injury that Fatone sustained at an NSYNC concert the night before the video shoot. That same year, he directed Spears&#x27;s Dream Within a Dream Tour.

Robson and NSYNC&#x27;s Justin Timberlake partnered in 2001, co-writing the hit singles &quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Gone&quot;, and &quot;See Right Through You&quot; on NSYNC&#x27;s final album &quot;Celebrity&quot;. Robson had initially written &quot;Celebrity&quot; for his own album, but was persuaded to let NSYNC record it instead. They also co-wrote Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;What It&#x27;s Like to Be Me&quot;, on which Timberlake sang backing vocals. The song&#x27;s copyright is held jointly by Robson&#x27;s and Timberlake&#x27;s respective companies, WaJeRo Sound and Tennman Tunes.

===Professional career===
Robson was the creator and host of MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Wade Robson Project&quot;, a talent search competition for hip-hop dancers. The program was sponsored by Juice Batteries. In 2002, Robson was named one of &quot;Dance Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;25 to Watch&quot;.

Dance clothing company Power T Dance developed a line of name-brand consumer dance shoes with Robson. The shoes were distributed in the U.S. through the Ralph Libonati Co. Robson appeared as himself in the 2004 urban dance film &quot;You Got Served&quot;, which won Best Dance Sequence (Feature Film) at the 2004 American Choreography Awards. Robson joined several other choreographers, such as Mia Michaels and Shane Sparks, on the PULSE Tour, a series of nationwide weekend workshops designed to give dancers the chance to train under top choreographers.
In 2007, Robson began choreographing the American Idols LIVE! Tour. He also choreographed both group and partner pieces for the second and third seasons of &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;. In September 2007, Robson was awarded a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography for the dance number &quot;Ramalama (Bang Bang)&quot; on Season 2 of &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;.

Robson was awarded his second Primetime Emmy Award in 2008 on Season 3 of &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; for the jazz routine &quot;Humming Bird and the Flower&quot;. The show&#x27;s executive producer Nigel Lythgoe called it &quot;absolutely genius, brilliant, and one of those routines that we will remember on this series for a very long time&quot;.

Robson said he and his wife Amanda were hired by singer Britney Spears to direct and choreograph her tour The Circus Starring Britney Spears. Rehearsals were set to begin in January 2009. Robson and his wife were replaced by Jamie King. Spears&#x27;s team said that Robson had only been hired to choreograph the promotional tour for her album 2008 &quot;Circus&quot;, which ended in Japan in December 2008.

Robson choreographed the animated film &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot;, released in 2011. He was set to direct &quot;Step Up Revolution&quot; (released in 2012), but dropped out for personal reasons. He was replaced by Scott Speer.

== Michael Jackson ==
When Robson was five, he met the American singer Michael Jackson, who was touring Australia. Two years later, when Robson visited the US with his family to perform with Johnny Young&#x27;s Talent School in Disneyland, California, Jackson invited the family to stay with him at his home, Neverland Ranch, also in California. Robson appeared in Jackson&#x27;s music videos.

In 2005, after Jackson was charged with child sexual abuse, Robson testified in his defense, saying he had slept in Jackson&#x27;s bedroom several times but had never been molested. Jackson was acquitted. After Jackson&#x27;s death in 2009, Robson said: &quot;His music, his movement, his personal words of inspiration and encouragement and his unconditional love will live inside of me forever.&quot;

In 2013, Robson reversed his position and filed a lawsuit against Jackson&#x27;s estate. He said that Jackson had sexually abused him on two visits to the US and after he moved with his family to the US, when Robson was aged between seven and 14. Robson said his earlier denial was due to Jackson&#x27;s &quot;complete manipulation and brainwashing&quot;, and that his change of story was provoked by becoming a father and experiencing nervous breakdowns. The allegations by Robson and another man, James Safechuck, are the focus of the 2019 documentary &quot;Leaving Neverland&quot;.

In 2017, Robson&#x27;s lawsuit was dismissed as the statute of limitations had expired. It was revived in 2019 after a new law gave those who allege childhood sexual abuse longer to file lawsuits. The case was dismissed again in April 2021, when a judge ruled that Jackson&#x27;s companies had no legal duty to protect Robson. This ruling was overturned in August 2023 in a decision in &quot;Safechuck v. MJJ Productions&quot;, clearing the way for a trial.

==Personal life==
Robson dated Michael Jackson&#x27;s niece Brandi, the daughter of Jackie Jackson, for seven years. Brandi stated in &quot;Neverland Firsthand: Investigating the Michael Jackson Documentary&quot;, a documentary made in response to &quot;Leaving Neverland&quot;, that she and Robson met as children during a photoshoot with Michael Jackson. Robson asked Jackson to set the two up. The two were friends for ten years prior to the beginning of their relationship. Brandi also said that Robson cheated on her with Britney Spears during Spears&#x27; 1999–2001 tour, ending the pair&#x27;s relationship, as well as the relationship between Spears and former boyfriend, Justin Timberlake, which implies that Timberlake wrote &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; about Spears cheating on him with Robson. Spears confirmed that her affair with Robson did happen, but Timberlake has not commented on these rumours. Robson also dated dancer Mayte Garcia from 2000 until 2001.

<text>A trip sitter—sometimes known as a sober sitter, spotter, or co-pilot—is a term used by recreational or spiritual drug users to describe a person who remains sober to ensure the safety of the drug user while they are under the influence of a drug; they are especially common with first-time experiences or when using psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants. This practice can be seen as a means of harm reduction.

A trip sitter is sometimes called a psychedelic guide or guide, although this term is more often used to describe someone who takes an active role in guiding a drug user&#x27;s experiences; a sitter merely stands by to discourage bad trips and handle emergencies, but otherwise does not take on an active role. Guides are more common among spiritual users of entheogens. Psychedelic guides were strongly encouraged by Timothy Leary and the other authors of &quot;The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;. Trip sitters are also mentioned in the Responsible Drug User&#x27;s Oath. 

Some sources recommend a sitter be present when certain drugs are used, regardless of the user&#x27;s experience or comfort with the substance. A sitter may be necessary for users of &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot; for example because the drug can sometimes cause both disorientation and a desire to move about.

While the presence of a responsible, knowledgeable trip sitter or guide will reduce the risks of drug use, it is not a guarantee that a bad trip will not occur, nor that the drug user will remain free of physical or mental harm.

==Who trip-sits==

In some cases, a trip sitter may be a medical professional, such as the nurses used in psychedelic research or a therapist who performs psychedelic psychotherapy. Sometimes, a tripper will ask another, more experienced user to sit for them. However, the most common trip sitter is a friend or family member whom the drug user trusts.

Although an ideal sitter is one who is both personally experienced with the substance being used, as well as one trained to deal with any potential psychological or medical crisis that may arise, arguably the most important qualities may be the willingness to help, the responsibility needed to stay sober enough to be fully present, and the ability to be relaxed, accepting, and not interfere with the experience beyond the wishes of the user. A sitter should be willing to research the substance in question, and understand when to call for professional medical assistance. 

Especially when using a short-acting substance such as smoked DMT or Salvia divinorum, it may be possible for two people to take turns, with one being the sitter while the other takes the psychedelic.

==Common duties==
A responsible trip sitter assists a drug user before, during, and after their experience; it is their responsibility to help the user by making sure they drink enough water, assisting them in moving around when needed, and generally doing whatever necessary to ensure their comfort throughout the trip.

===Before use===
The responsible trip sitter will thoroughly research the substance which will be ingested (as well as the users) in order to answer all potential questions the user may have, and to prepare for any potential crisis situations it may cause. They may have first hand experience of the drug beforehand, but this is not required, with a number of sitters choosing to the culture but not the chemical. The sitter will discuss this research in detail with the user; it is also considered important to talk to the user about any ground rules for the session, how to handle any emergencies that may arise, and what, if any, guidance will be wanted during the trip. 
A trip sitter will also frequently help a drug user create a healthy set and setting for the experience. They do this by making sure the user&#x27;s surroundings are comfortable and orderly, adjusting lighting, temperature, and music (if any) to suit the desired tone of the trip, and overall doing whatever they can to maximize the user&#x27;s openness to the experience and minimize their fear.

===During the psychedelic experience===

A sitter typically remains present for the entire experience. In some cases, they may actively guide the experience of the user by adjusting their environment or through guided meditation or visualization. In other cases, they stay uninvolved except when the user has questions, fears, or needs for which the sitter can provide (such as making sure the user drinks enough water). Assistance in facing fears may be especially necessary if the experience turns into a bad trip. In order to maintain the immediate well-being of the drug user, it is important for the sitter to know what situations they can or cannot handle on their own, and when to call for professional medical assistance.

Although the sitter may be called upon to intervene during a difficult situation, bad trip, or medical crisis, the mere presence of a caring sitter is often enough to keep a user comfortable and even enable deeper exploration of the drug&#x27;s effects. The experience of being present during an especially powerful experience, such as when the user reaches new insight into themselves or their beliefs about the nature of the universe, is reportedly quite rewarding.

===After the trip===

A sitter may help the drug user to integrate or understand their experiences when the experience is complete. Just as they did before, and during the trip, they may reassure the user about any fears or worries that have occurred. This discussion may take place immediately after the drug&#x27;s effects have worn off, or they may wait until a later date.

==Online services==
The chatroom TripSit, where volunteers offer guidance to people having bad drug experiences, attempts to fulfill a similar function.

<doc id="654149" wikidata="Q671079" url="?curid=654149" title="Troopship">
<text>A troopship (also troop ship or troop transport or trooper) is a ship used to carry soldiers, either in peacetime or wartime. Troopships were often drafted from commercial shipping fleets, and were unable to land troops directly on shore, typically loading and unloading at a seaport or onto smaller vessels, either tenders or barges.

Attack transports, a variant of ocean-going troopship adapted to transporting invasion forces ashore, carry their own fleet of landing craft. Landing ships beach themselves and bring their troops directly ashore.

==History==
Ships to transport troops were used in antiquity. Ancient Rome used the navis lusoria, a small vessel powered by rowers and sail, to move soldiers on the Rhine and Danube.
The modern troopship has as long a history as passenger ships do, as most maritime nations enlisted their support in military operations (either by leasing the vessels or by impressing them into service) when their normal naval forces were deemed insufficient for the task. In the 19th century, navies frequently chartered civilian ocean liners, and from the start of the 20th century painted them gray and added a degree of armament; their speed, originally intended to minimize passage time for civilian user, proved valuable for outrunning submarines and enemy cruisers in war. even rammed and sank a U-boat during one of its wartime crossings. Individual liners capable of exceptionally high speed transited without escorts; smaller or older liners with poorer performance were protected by operating in convoys.

Most major naval powers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries provided their domestic shipping lines with subsidies to build fast ocean liners capable of conversions to auxiliary cruisers during wartime. The British government, for example, aided both Cunard and the White Star Line in constructing the liners , , and RMS &quot;Britannic&quot;. However, when the vulnerability of these ships to return fire was realized during World War I most were used instead as troopships or hospital ships.

 and were two of the most famous converted liners of World War II. When they were fully converted, each could carry well over 10,000 troops per trip. &quot;Queen Mary&quot; holds the all-time record, with 15,740 troops on a single passage in late July 1943, transporting a staggering 765,429 military personnel during the war.

==World War II==
Large numbers of troopships were employed during World War II, including 220 &quot;Limited Capacity&quot; Liberty ship conversions, 30 Type C4 ship-based , a class of 84 Victory ship conversions, and a small number of Type-C3-S-A2 ship-based dedicated transports, and 15 classes of attack transports, of which some 400 alone were built.

* The modified Liberties were capable of transporting up to 450, 550, or 650 (sources vary) troops or prisoners-of-war. Modifications included installation of bunks stacked five deep on the forward , additional shower and head facilities, two additional diesel-powered generators, and installation of two more Oerlikon 20-mm automatic cannons.
* 30 Type C4 ship-based , the largest carrying over 6,000 passengers.
* A class of Victory ship-based dedicated troopship was developed late in World War II. A total of 84 such VC2-S-AP2 hull conversions was completed.
* A class of Type C3 ship – comprising mainly C3-S-A2 and C3-S-A3 hulls – was also converted to dedicated troopships, capable of carrying 2,100 troops, was also developed.
* At least 15 classes of attack transport, consisting of at least 400 ships specially equipped for landing invasion forces rather than general troop movement.

===Designation===
The designation HMT (Her/His Majesty&#x27;s Transport) would normally replace RMS (Royal Mail Ship), MV (Motor Vessel) or SS (Steamship) for ships converted to troopship duty with the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy. The United States used two designations: WSA for troopships operated by the War Shipping Administration using Merchant Marine crews, and USS (United States Ship) for vessels accepted into and operated by the United States Navy. Initially, troopships adapted as attack transports were designated AP; starting in 1942 keel-up attack transports received the designation APA.

&quot;HMT&quot; was also used, for a while, to designate &quot;Hired Military Transport.&quot;

==Post-World War II==
In the era of the Cold War, the United States designed the ship so that she could easily be converted from a liner to a troopship, in case of war. More recently, and were requisitioned by the Royal Navy to carry British soldiers to the Falklands War. By the end of the twentieth century, nearly all long-distance personnel transfer was done by airlift in military transport aircraft.

<doc id="654150" wikidata="Q1105343" url="?curid=654150" title="Cocktail glass">
<text>A cocktail glass is a stemmed glass with an inverted cone bowl, mainly used to serve straight-up cocktails. The term &quot;cocktail glass&quot; is often used interchangeably with martini glass, despite their differing slightly. Today, the glass is used to serve a variety of cocktails, such as the martini and its variations (Gibson, French martini, vodka martini, espresso martini, appletini), Manhattan, Brandy Alexander, pisco sour, Negroni, cosmopolitan, gimlet, and the grasshopper.

== History ==
Invented in the late 19th century, its form derives from the fact that all cocktails are traditionally served chilled and contain an aromatic element. Thus, the stem allows the drinker to hold the glass without affecting the temperature of the drink, an important aspect due to the lack of added ice which in other drinks serves to cool the drink, and the wide bowl places the surface of the drink directly under the drinker&#x27;s nose, ensuring the aromatic element has the desired effect. In the modern day, cocktail glasses without stems are common; however, these glasses warm very quickly, a phenomenon the original stem addressed.

== Martini glass ==

Although the terms &quot;cocktail glass&quot; and &quot;martini glass&quot; are often used interchangeably, a martini glass is slightly larger, with a more conical rather than rounded shape, features a longer stem, and has a wider rim.

Despite a popular story that says the martini glass was invented during Prohibition so that in the case of a raid on a speakeasy, the large rim allowed the drink to be easily disposed of, the martini glass was formally introduced in the 1925 Paris Exhibition as a modernist take on the Champagne coupe, and wasn&#x27;t originally used as it is today: in films of the 1920s it is shown to be used to hold champagne, like the coupe. However, despite the design taking influence from the geometric aesthetics of the era&#x27;s architecture, interiors and furnishings, it was designed less for aesthetics and more for functionality – with the longer stem reducing the warming effect of body heat upon the contents of the glass, and the widened brim increasing surface area, supposedly allowing the gin, the main ingredient in martinis, to release its bouquet. Steeply sloping sides prevent ingredients separating, and also serve to support a toothpick or olives on a cocktail skewer.

The martini glass has somewhat fallen out of favour in modern times due to its tendency to spill drinks, and the coupe is sometimes used instead.

== Sizes ==
A standard cocktail glass contains , though originally they were around in size. Oversized cocktail glasses, ranging in capacity from to large glasses of or more are available.

<text>An antagonist is a character in a story who is presented as the main enemy or rival of the protagonist and is often depicted as a villain.

==Etymology==
The English word antagonist comes from the Greek ἀνταγωνιστής – &quot;antagonistēs&quot;, &quot;opponent, competitor, villain, enemy, rival,&quot; which is derived from &quot;anti-&quot; (&quot;against&quot;) and &quot;agonizesthai&quot; (&quot;to contend for a prize&quot;).

==Types==
===Heroes and villains===

The antagonist is commonly positioned against the protagonist and their world order. While narratives often portray the protagonist as a hero and the antagonist as a villain, like Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort in &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, the antagonist does not always appear as the villain. In some narratives, like Light Yagami and L in &quot;Death Note&quot;, the protagonist is a villain and the antagonist is an opposing hero.

Antagonists are conventionally presented as making moral choices less savory than those of protagonists. This condition is often used by an author to create conflict within a story. This is merely a convention, however. An example in which this is reversed can be seen in the character Macduff from &quot;Macbeth,&quot; who is arguably morally correct in his desire to fight the tyrant Macbeth, the protagonist.

Examples from television include J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman) from &quot;Dallas&quot; and Alexis Colby (Joan Collins) from &quot;Dynasty&quot;. Both became breakout characters used as a device to increase their shows&#x27; ratings.

===Other characters===
Characters may be antagonists without being evil – they may simply be injudicious and unlikeable for the audience. In some stories, such as &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, almost every character other than the protagonist may be an antagonist. Another example of this occurring is through Javert in Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, in which Javert displays no malicious intent, but instead represents the rigid and inflexible application of the law, even when it leads to moral and ethical dilemmas.

===Aspects of the protagonist===

An aspect or trait of the protagonist may be considered an antagonist, such as morality or indecisiveness.

===Non-personal===
An antagonist is not always a person or people. In some cases, an antagonist may be a force, such as a tidal wave that destroys a city; a storm that causes havoc; or even a certain area&#x27;s conditions that are the root cause of a problem. An antagonist may or may not create obstacles for the protagonist.

Societal norms or other rules may also be antagonists.

==Usage==
An antagonist is used as a plot device, to set up conflicts, obstacles, or challenges for the protagonist. Though not every story requires an antagonist, it often is used in plays to increase the level of drama. In tragedies, antagonists are often the cause of the protagonist&#x27;s main problem, or lead a group of characters against the protagonist; in comedies, they are usually responsible for involving the protagonist in comedic situations.

== Antagonist-design techniques ==
Author John Truby argues that a true opponent not only wants to prevent the hero from achieving his desire but is competing with the hero for the same goal. According to John Truby, &quot;It is only by competing for the same goal that the hero and the opponent are forced to come into direct conflict and to do so again and again throughout the story.&quot;

<text>Ulrich Alexander Fox (born July 24, 1969) is a Bahamian-Canadian actor and former basketball player. He played in the National Basketball Association for the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers, and played college basketball for the North Carolina Tar Heels. He was the owner of the eSports franchise Echo Fox until his departure from the franchise in October 2019.

His acting credits include roles in &quot;Oz&quot;, &quot;He Got Game&quot;, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;, &quot;The Game&quot;, &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, &quot;Meet the Browns&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;Mr. Box Office&quot;, &quot;Sin City Saints&quot;, &quot;Krystal&quot;, &quot;Sharknado&quot;, &quot;Greenleaf&quot;, &quot;Morning Show Mysteries,&quot; &quot;All Rise&quot; and &quot;Holes&quot;.

==Early life==
Ulrich Alexander Fox was born on July 24, 1969, in Toronto, Canada, the son of Dianne Gerace, who was an Olympic high jumper and women&#x27;s pentathlete, and Ulrich Fox. His father is Bahamian and his mother is Canadian of Italian and Scottish descent. Fox&#x27;s family moved to his father&#x27;s native Bahamas when Fox was young. He attended Kingsway Academy in Nassau. Despite never playing organized basketball before, he went to a summer camp and became a member of the high school&#x27;s basketball team, the Saints. Fox also played high school basketball in Warsaw, Indiana. After two seasons (1984–1986) at Warsaw, Fox was projected to have a very successful senior season. Just before his senior season, the Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA) ruled that he had no more high school eligibility left (due to completing eight semesters between the Bahamas and Indiana) and was not allowed to participate in any further IHSAA games. Despite not playing his senior season, Fox was voted onto the Indiana All-Star team in 1987. He then went on to star collegiately at the University of North Carolina.

==Professional career==
===Boston Celtics (1991–1997)===
Fox was selected by the Boston Celtics in the first round (24th pick overall) of the 1991 NBA draft. As a member of the Celtics, Fox became the first rookie starter on opening night since Larry Bird in 1979 and made the 1992 NBA All-Rookie Second Team after averaging 8 points per game. By the 1995–96 season, Fox became the team&#x27;s starting small forward and achieved double-figure scoring. He recorded career highs of 15.4 points a game and 2.2 steals a game (fifth in the league) and made 101 three-point field goals in the 1996–97 season.

===Los Angeles Lakers (1997–2004)===

In the summer of 1997, the Celtics released Fox, and he signed with the Los Angeles Lakers. He played and started in all 82 games during the 1997–98 season, averaging 12 points per game. In the playoffs, he tallied 10.9 points a game as the Lakers advanced to the Western Conference Finals before losing to the Utah Jazz. In the 1998–99 season, the Lakers acquired All-Star small forward Glen Rice. Fox primarily served as his backup during the next two seasons.

In the 1999–2000 season playoffs, Fox played all 23 games as the Lakers advanced to the 2000 NBA Finals against the Indiana Pacers. In the Finals, Fox averaged 6.7 points, including 11 in the Lakers&#x27; game 1 victory. In game 6, with the Lakers leading the series 3–2, Fox hit a critical three-pointer in the fourth quarter to help the Lakers&#x27; final rally as they won the game and the NBA title, Fox&#x27;s first.

Following the departure of Glen Rice, Fox started 77 of 82 games in the 2000–01 season, posting an average of 9.6 points a game while shooting 39% from three-point range. In the playoffs, Fox started in all 16 games as the Lakers swept through the first three rounds and reached the 2001 NBA Finals against the Philadelphia 76ers. Fox scored 19 points in the Lakers&#x27; game 1 loss; the 76ers were led by Allen Iverson&#x27;s 48 points. The Lakers would win the next four games of the series, securing their second straight championship. In the fifth game, Fox contributed with 20 points, and hit all three of his three-point field goal attempts.

In the 2001–02 season, Fox played and started in all 82 games in the regular season and in all of the Lakers&#x27; 19 playoff games. The Lakers faced a grueling 7-game series against the Sacramento Kings, with Fox scoring 13 points in the Lakers&#x27; game 7 victory in Sacramento.

In the 2002 NBA Finals against the New Jersey Nets, Fox averaged 9.8 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 1.5 steals as the Lakers swept the Nets in 4 games to win their third straight NBA title. In the beginning of the 2002 season, Fox was suspended 6 games after fighting with Sacramento Kings player Doug Christie in the preseason. In the 2002–03 season, Fox started in 75 of 76 games but suffered an ankle injury that kept him out of the last two games of the first round against the Minnesota Timberwolves and the entire Western Conference Semi-final series against the San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs defeated the Lakers 4–2. Fox missed 40 games in the 2003–04 season due to a foot injury, but started in 34 of 38 games while active. He would only start in 3 of 16 playoff games as the Lakers advanced to the 2004 NBA Finals but lost to the Detroit Pistons in 5 games. In 56 career NBA playoff games, Fox averaged 6.1 points per game, 2.6 rebounds, and 1.8 assists. Following the 2003–04 season, Fox was traded back to the Celtics in a deal that brought Chucky Atkins to the Lakers, but opted to retire instead of suiting up for the Celtics. During his 13-year NBA career, Fox earned more than $34 million in salary.

At the time, ESPN quoted Fox as saying of trying to balance his acting career with his sports career that, &quot;I mean, Penny Marshall is courtside. You got Jack (Nicholson) and Denzel (Washington). The head of the William Morris Agency is there. (Ally McBeal creator) David E. Kelley comes to some games ... I want to jump into conversations with them, but I&#x27;m working!&quot;

In addition to &quot;Oz&quot;, Fox appeared in three more television series in the year 2003. On the first season of the crime drama &quot;1-800-Missing&quot; starring Vivica A.

In 2011, Fox played the role of Bernadette&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Glenn in &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; episode &quot;The Love Car Displacement&quot;. In an article about his appearance, &quot;TV Guide&quot; quoted Fox as saying about his role, &quot;It&#x27;s all in Glenn&#x27;s head now. &#x27;How am I losing to this guy? He&#x27;s smarter than me ... I love that they turned the &#x27;threatening ex&#x27; on its ear. At the end of the day, I have more insecurity about my intellect and am constantly fighting to be accepted intellectually and be seen for more than my looks and my size. I want to appear intelligent and prove my intelligence. That&#x27;s where I&#x27;m battling with him.&quot;

In 2011, Fox also played a suspect on the crime drama &quot;Body of Proof&quot; and in 2012 he played the character Andre Carson on the series &quot;Franklin &amp; Bash&quot;. He also played the recurring role of Winston on &quot;Single Ladies&quot; and Andrew Thompson in the series &quot;Mr. Box Office&quot;.

He was a special guest judge during season 4 of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;. And in 2017, Fox was a contestant on the &quot;Chopped&quot; Star Power actors competition. Fox came in second place.

==Professional gaming==

In 2015, Fox and partner Amit Raizada acquired professional &quot;League of Legends&quot; team Gravity Gaming of the North American League of Legends Championship Series, re-branding it to Echo Fox.

In April 2019 Echo Fox confirmed to ESPN that Amit Raizada, one of its co-founders, had used racist language multiple times, including in a confrontation with Fox.

In response, Riot Games, which operates the LCS, launched an investigation. It ordered Echo Fox to remove Razaida, or it would have to sell its spot in the LCS within 60 days, saying &quot;hate speech, threats, and bigotry have no place in the LCS.&quot; Riot Games came up with an agreement to end Echo Fox&#x27;s participation in the LCS, eventually resulting in Evil Geniuses acquiring the team&#x27;s spot. With Echo Fox unable to remove Razaida, Fox notified Echo Fox shareholders that he would be exiting the organization as soon as he could facilitate a transaction. In an email, obtained by Dexerto, Fox said: &quot;the recent outrageous and abhorrent display of pure racism made by a significant Echo Fox shareholder as well as threats to my family have made it impossible for me to continue remain associated with the company.&quot;

In a statement in November 2019, Fox confirmed he had left the organization. &quot;On the [basketball] court and in the business world, teammates are everything and there must be unity and a shared sense of purpose in order to succeed. In the case of Echo Fox, the significant difference of values, ethics and commitment to integrity was very problematic and damaging&quot;, Fox said.

==Personal life==
Fox has a son with Kari Hillsman, a woman he dated while playing basketball for the Boston Celtics. His son is an avid gamer and got his father into the eSports world.

Fox eloped with American actress/singer Vanessa Williams in the summer of 1999 in the Caribbean. They had another ceremony in September 1999 in New York City. They have a daughter. In August 2004, Fox filed for divorce from Williams. Fox and Williams&#x27; split, however, was amicable enough for the two of them to work onscreen together several years later on the television show &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;.

Fox and actress Eliza Dushku dated from October 2009 to June 2014.

Fox was mistakenly reported to have been among the passengers killed in a helicopter crash alongside his former teammate Kobe Bryant in Calabasas, California on January 26, 2020; these claims were contradicted by Fox and his family.

<text>Directional sound refers to the notion of using various devices to create fields of sound which spread less than most (small) traditional loudspeakers. Several techniques are available to accomplish this, and each has its benefits and drawbacks. Ultimately, choosing a directional sound device depends greatly on the environment in which it is deployed as well as the content that will be reproduced. Keeping these factors in mind will yield the best results through any evaluation of directional sound technologies.

Systems which guide evacuees during an emergency by the emission of pink noise to the exits are often also called &quot;directional sound&quot; systems.

== Basic theory ==
In all wave-producing sources, the directivity of any source, at maximum, corresponds to the size of the source compared to the wavelengths it is generating: The larger the source is compared to the wavelength of the sound waves, the more directional beam results . The specific transduction method has no impact on the directivity of the resulting sound field; the analysis relies only on the aperture function of the source, per the Huygens–Fresnel principle.

The ultrasonic devices achieve high directivity by modulating audible sound onto high frequency ultrasound. The higher frequency sound waves have a shorter wavelength and thus don&#x27;t spread out as rapidly. For this reason, the resulting directivity of these devices is far higher than physically possible with any loudspeaker system. However, they are reported to have limited low-frequency reproduction abilities. See sound from ultrasound for more information.

== Speaker arrays ==

While a large loudspeaker is naturally more directional because of its large size, a source with equivalent directivity can be made by utilizing an array of traditional small loudspeakers, all driven together in-phase. Acoustically equal to a large speaker, this creates a larger source size compared to wavelength, and the resulting sound field is narrowed compared to a single small speaker. Large speaker arrays have been used in hundreds of arena sound systems to mitigate noise that would ordinarily travel to adjoining neighborhoods, along with limited applications in other applications where some degree of directivity is helpful, such as museums or similar display applications that can tolerate large speaker dimensions.

Traditional speaker arrays can be fabricated in any shape or size, but a reduced physical dimension (relative to wavelength) will inherently sacrifice directivity in that dimension. The larger the speaker array, the more directional, and the smaller the size of the speaker array, the less directional it is. This is fundamental physics, and cannot be bypassed, even by using phased arrays or other signal processing methods. This is because the directivity pattern of any wave source is the Fourier Transform of the source function. Phased array design is, however, sometimes useful for beamsteering, or for sidelobe mitigation, but making these compromises necessarily reduces directivity.

Acoustically, speaker arrays are essentially the same as sound domes, which have also been available for decades; the size of the dome opening mimics the acoustic properties of a large speaker of the same diameter (or, equivalently, a large speaker array of the same diameter). Domes, however, tend to weigh much less than the weight of comparable speaker arrays (15 lbs vs. 37 lbs, per the manufacturer&#x27;s websites), and are far less expensive.

Other types of large speaker panels, such as electrostatic loudspeakers, tend to be more directional than small speakers, for the same reasons as above; they are somewhat more directional only because they tend to be physically larger than most common loudspeakers. Correspondingly, an electrostatic loudspeaker the size of a small traditional speaker would be non-directional. 

The directivity for various source sizes and shapes is given in. The directivity is shown to be a function only of the source size and shape, not of the specific type of transducer used.

<doc id="654162" wikidata="Q2464934" url="?curid=654162" title="Marcie">
<text>Marcie is a fictional character featured in the long-running syndicated daily and Sunday comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; by Charles M. Schulz.

Marcie is a studious girl who is sometimes depicted as being terrible at sports. She is friends with the tomboyish, athletic Peppermint Patty, who gets annoyed at Marcie when she calls her &quot;sir&quot;, and she has a mostly unrequited crush on the underdog Charlie Brown.

Marcie has appeared outside the comic strip in numerous &quot;Peanuts&quot; television specials, cinematic films, theatrical plays, and video games.

==History==
Marcie made her first appearance in the daily strip from July 20, 1971, but her name wasn&#x27;t mentioned until the strip from October 11. The character was modeled after Elise Gallaway, the roommate of Patty Swanson, Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s cousin and the inspiration for the Peppermint Patty character.

Schulz never gave Marcie a surname in the comic strip. However, she has been given two surnames in animated features. In the 1994 animated special &quot;You&#x27;re In the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown&quot;, Marcie&#x27;s surname is given as &quot;Johnson&quot;.

Marcie is spotlighted in her first special, &quot;Snoopy Presents: One-of-a-Kind Marcie&quot;, which premiered August 18, 2023, on Apple TV+.

=== Appearance ===
Marcie wears round glasses with opaque lenses and wears her dark brown (sometimes black) hair in a short bob style. In the animated specials, she also wears an orange T-shirt (colored red in the Apple TV+ specials and &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;). She and Peppermint Patty were the only girls in the strip to wear a T-shirt and shorts.

===Personality===
Marcie is best friends with Peppermint Patty, constantly addressing her as &quot;sir&quot; (she called her &quot;sir&quot; in her first line in the strip). Originally, Peppermint Patty kept telling Marcie to stop calling her that but eventually grows accustomed to it. Initially, Peppermint Patty addresses Marcie as &quot;dorky&quot; and, when talking to others, refers to her as &quot;my weird friend from camp&quot;. While Peppermint Patty refers to Charlie Brown as &quot;Chuck&quot;, Marcie usually calls him &quot;Charles&quot;. Marcie is very intelligent and does well in school (a contrast with Peppermint Patty), but sometimes says that she is pressured by her parents&#x27; expectation of her to do well in school, and even that despite her young age, they have already chosen her college.

== Voice actors ==
Marcie has been played by many voice actors in animated &quot;Peanuts&quot; productions.

<doc id="654168" wikidata="Q410943" url="?curid=654168" title="Receptor antagonist">
<text>A receptor antagonist is a type of receptor ligand or drug that blocks or dampens a biological response by binding to and blocking a receptor rather than activating it like an agonist. Antagonist drugs interfere in the natural operation of receptor proteins. They are sometimes called blockers; examples include alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. In pharmacology, antagonists have affinity but no efficacy for their cognate receptors, and binding will disrupt the interaction and inhibit the function of an agonist or inverse agonist at receptors. Antagonists mediate their effects by binding to the active site or to the allosteric site on a receptor, or they may interact at unique binding sites not normally involved in the biological regulation of the receptor&#x27;s activity. Antagonist activity may be reversible or irreversible depending on the longevity of the antagonist–receptor complex, which, in turn, depends on the nature of antagonist–receptor binding. The majority of drug antagonists achieve their potency by competing with endogenous ligands or substrates at structurally defined binding sites on receptors.

==Etymology==
The English word antagonist in pharmaceutical terms comes from the Greek ἀνταγωνιστής – &quot;antagonistēs&quot;, &quot;opponent, competitor, villain, enemy, rival&quot;, which is derived from &quot;anti-&quot; (&quot;against&quot;) and &quot;agonizesthai&quot; (&quot;to contend for a prize&quot;). Antagonists were discovered in the 20th century by American biologist Bailey Edgren.

==Receptors==
Biochemical receptors are large protein molecules that can be activated by the binding of a ligand such as a hormone or a drug. Receptors can be membrane-bound, as cell surface receptors, or inside the cell as intracellular receptors, such as nuclear receptors including those of the mitochondrion. Binding occurs as a result of non-covalent interactions between the receptor and its ligand, at locations called the binding site on the receptor. A receptor may contain one or more binding sites for different ligands. Binding to the active site on the receptor regulates receptor activation directly. The activity of receptors can also be regulated by the binding of a ligand to other sites on the receptor, as in allosteric binding sites. Antagonists mediate their effects through receptor interactions by preventing agonist-induced responses. This may be accomplished by binding to the active site or the allosteric site. In addition, antagonists may interact at unique binding sites not normally involved in the biological regulation of the receptor&#x27;s activity to exert their effects.

The term &quot;antagonist&quot; was originally coined to describe different profiles of drug effects. The biochemical definition of a receptor antagonist was introduced by Ariens and Stephenson in the 1950s. The current accepted definition of receptor antagonist is based on the receptor occupancy model. It narrows the definition of antagonism to consider only those compounds with opposing activities at a single receptor. Agonists were thought to turn &quot;on&quot; a &quot;single&quot; cellular response by binding to the receptor, thus initiating a biochemical mechanism for change within a cell. Antagonists were thought to turn &quot;off&quot; that response by &#x27;blocking&#x27; the receptor from the agonist. This definition also remains in use for physiological antagonists, substances that have opposing physiological actions, but act at different receptors. For example, histamine lowers arterial pressure through vasodilation at the histamine H1 receptor, while adrenaline raises arterial pressure through vasoconstriction mediated by alpha-adrenergic receptor activation.

Our understanding of the mechanism of drug-induced receptor activation and receptor theory and the biochemical definition of a receptor antagonist continues to evolve. The two-state model of receptor activation has given way to multistate models with intermediate conformational states. The discovery of functional selectivity and that ligand-specific receptor conformations occur and can affect interaction of receptors with different second messenger systems may mean that drugs can be designed to activate some of the downstream functions of a receptor but not others. This means efficacy may actually depend on where that receptor is expressed, altering the view that efficacy at a receptor is receptor-independent property of a drug.

==Pharmacodynamics==
===Efficacy and potency===

By definition, antagonists display no efficacy to activate the receptors they bind. Antagonists do not maintain the ability to activate a receptor. Once bound, however, antagonists inhibit the function of agonists, inverse agonists, and partial agonists. In functional antagonist assays, a dose-response curve measures the effect of the ability of a range of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an agonist. The potency of an antagonist is usually defined by its &quot;half maximal inhibitory concentration&quot; (i.e., IC50 value). This can be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration of antagonist needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum biological response of an agonist. Elucidating an IC50 value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar efficacies, however the dose-response curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar. The lower the IC50 the greater the potency of the antagonist, and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to inhibit the maximum biological response. Lower concentrations of drugs may be associated with fewer side-effects.
===Affinity===
The affinity of an antagonist for its binding site (Ki), i.e. its ability to bind to a receptor, will determine the duration of inhibition of agonist activity. The affinity of an antagonist can be determined experimentally using Schild regression or for competitive antagonists in radioligand binding studies using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. Schild regression can be used to determine the nature of antagonism as beginning either competitive or non-competitive and Ki determination is independent of the affinity, efficacy or concentration of the agonist used. However, it is important that equilibrium has been reached. The effects of receptor desensitization on reaching equilibrium must also be taken into account. The affinity constant of antagonists exhibiting two or more effects, such as in competitive neuromuscular-blocking agents that also block ion channels as well as antagonising agonist binding, cannot be analyzed using Schild regression. Schild regression involves comparing the change in the dose ratio, the ratio of the EC50 of an agonist alone compared to the EC50 in the presence of a competitive antagonist as determined on a dose response curve. Altering the amount of antagonist used in the assay can alter the dose ratio. In Schild regression, a plot is made of the log (dose ratio-1) versus the log concentration of antagonist for a range of antagonist concentrations. The affinity or Ki is where the line cuts the x-axis on the regression plot. Whereas, with Schild regression, antagonist concentration is varied in experiments used to derive Ki values from the Cheng-Prusoff equation, agonist concentrations are varied. Affinity for competitive agonists and antagonists is related by the Cheng-Prusoff factor used to calculate the Ki (affinity constant for an antagonist) from the shift in IC50 that occurs during competitive inhibition. The Cheng-Prusoff factor takes into account the effect of altering agonist concentration and agonist affinity for the receptor on inhibition produced by competitive antagonists.

==Types==
===Competitive===

Competitive antagonists bind to receptors at the same binding site (active site) as the endogenous ligand or agonist, but without activating the receptor. Agonists and antagonists &quot;compete&quot; for the same binding site on the receptor. Once bound, an antagonist will block agonist binding. Sufficient concentrations of an antagonist will displace the agonist from the binding sites, resulting in a lower frequency of receptor activation. The level of activity of the receptor will be determined by the relative affinity of each molecule for the site and their relative concentrations. High concentrations of a competitive agonist will increase the proportion of receptors that the agonist occupies, higher concentrations of the antagonist will be required to obtain the same degree of binding site occupancy. In functional assays using competitive antagonists, a parallel rightward shift of agonist dose–response curves with no alteration of the maximal response is observed.

Competitive antagonists are used to prevent the activity of drugs, and to reverse the effects of drugs that have already been consumed. Naloxone (also known as Narcan) is used to reverse opioid overdose caused by drugs such as heroin or morphine. Similarly, Ro15-4513 is an antidote to alcohol and flumazenil is an antidote to benzodiazepines.

Competitive antagonists are sub-classified as reversible (&quot;surmountable&quot;) or irreversible (&quot;insurmountable&quot;) competitive antagonists, depending on how they interact with their receptor protein targets. Reversible antagonists, which bind via noncovalent intermolecular forces, will eventually dissociate from the receptor, freeing the receptor to be bound again. Irreversible antagonists bind via covalent intermolecular forces. Because there is not enough free energy to break covalent bonds in the local environment, the bond is essentially &quot;permanent&quot;, meaning the receptor-antagonist complex will never dissociate. The receptor will thereby remain permanently antagonized until it is ubiquitinated and thus destroyed.

===Non-competitive===

A non-competitive antagonist is a type of insurmountable antagonist that may act in one of two ways: by binding to an allosteric site of the receptor, or by irreversibly binding to the active site of the receptor. The former meaning has been standardised by the IUPHAR, and is equivalent to the antagonist being called an &quot;allosteric antagonist&quot;. While the mechanism of antagonism is different in both of these phenomena, they are both called &quot;non-competitive&quot; because the end-results of each are functionally very similar. Unlike competitive antagonists, which affect the amount of agonist necessary to achieve a maximal response but do not affect the magnitude of that maximal response, non-competitive antagonists reduce the magnitude of the maximum response that can be attained by any amount of agonist. This property earns them the name &quot;non-competitive&quot; because their effects cannot be negated, no matter how much agonist is present. In functional assays of non-competitive antagonists, depression of the maximal response of agonist dose-response curves, and in some cases, rightward shifts, is produced. The rightward shift will occur as a result of a receptor reserve (also known as spare receptors) and inhibition of the agonist response will only occur when this reserve is depleted.

An antagonist that binds to the active site of a receptor is said to be &quot;non-competitive&quot; if the bond between the active site and the antagonist is irreversible or nearly so. This usage of the term &quot;non-competitive&quot; may not be ideal, however, since the term &quot;irreversible competitive antagonism&quot; may also be used to describe the same phenomenon without the potential for confusion with the second meaning of &quot;non-competitive antagonism&quot; discussed below.

The second form of &quot;non-competitive antagonists&quot; act at an allosteric site. These antagonists bind to a distinctly separate binding site from the agonist, exerting their action to that receptor via the other binding site. They do not compete with agonists for binding at the active site. The bound antagonists may prevent conformational changes in the receptor required for receptor activation after the agonist binds. Cyclothiazide has been shown to act as a reversible non-competitive antagonist of mGluR1 receptor. Another example of a non-competitive is phenoxybenzamine which binds irreversibly (with covalent bonds) to alpha-adrenergic receptors, which in turn reduces the fraction of available receptors and reduces the maximal effect that can be produced by the agonist. 
===Uncompetitive===
Uncompetitive antagonists differ from non-competitive antagonists in that they require receptor activation by an agonist before they can bind to a separate allosteric binding site. This type of antagonism produces a kinetic profile in which &quot;the same amount of antagonist blocks higher concentrations of agonist better than lower concentrations of agonist&quot;. Memantine, used in the treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, is an uncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor.

===Silent antagonists===

Silent antagonists are competitive receptor antagonists that have zero intrinsic activity for activating a receptor. They are true antagonists, so to speak. The term was created to distinguish fully inactive antagonists from weak partial agonists or inverse agonists.

===Partial agonists===
Partial agonists are defined as drugs that, at a given receptor, might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy. Although they are agonists, partial agonists can act as a competitive antagonist in the presence of a full agonist, as it competes with the full agonist for receptor occupancy, thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone. Clinically, their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity. Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial agonist will ensure that it has a constant, weak level of activity, whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels. In addition, it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists. E.g. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, binds with weak morphine-like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence.

===Inverse agonists===
An inverse agonist can have effects similar to those of an antagonist, but causes a distinct set of downstream biological responses. Constitutively active receptors that exhibit intrinsic or basal activity can have inverse agonists, which not only block the effects of binding agonists like a classical antagonist but also inhibit the basal activity of the receptor. Many drugs previously classified as antagonists are now beginning to be reclassified as inverse agonists because of the discovery of constitutive active receptors. Antihistamines, originally classified as antagonists of histamine H1 receptors have been reclassified as inverse agonists.

==Reversibility==
Many antagonists are reversible antagonists that, like most agonists, will bind and unbind a receptor at rates determined by receptor-ligand kinetics.

Irreversible antagonists covalently bind to the receptor target and, in general, cannot be removed; inactivating the receptor for the duration of the antagonist effects is determined by the rate of receptor turnover, the rate of synthesis of new receptors. Phenoxybenzamine is an example of an irreversible alpha blocker—it permanently binds to α adrenergic receptors, preventing adrenaline and noradrenaline from binding. Inactivation of receptors normally results in a depression of the maximal response of agonist dose-response curves and a right shift in the curve occurs where there is a receptor reserve similar to non-competitive antagonists. A washout step in the assay will usually distinguish between non-competitive and irreversible antagonist drugs, as effects of non-competitive antagonists are reversible and activity of agonist will be restored.

Irreversible competitive antagonists also involve competition between the agonist and antagonist of the receptor, but the rate of covalent bonding differs and depends on affinity and reactivity of the antagonist. For some antagonists, there may be a distinct period during which they behave competitively (regardless of basal efficacy), and freely associate to and dissociate from the receptor, determined by receptor-ligand kinetics. But, once irreversible bonding has taken place, the receptor is deactivated and degraded. As for non-competitive antagonists and irreversible antagonists in functional assays with irreversible competitive antagonist drugs, there may be a shift in the log concentration–effect curve to the right, but, in general, both a decrease in slope and a reduced maximum are obtained.

<text>Heidesheim am Rhein is an &quot;Ortsbezirk&quot; (borough) of the town Ingelheim am Rhein in the Mainz-Bingen district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Before July 2019, it was a separate municipality belonging to the former &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; (a kind of collective municipality) Heidesheim am Rhein, of which it was the administrative seat. Heidesheim was one of the biggest municipalities in Rhenish Hesse.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===

Heidesheim lies in northern Rhenish Hesse, on the so-called Rhine Knee, west of the state capital, Mainz. The municipal area reaches in the north up to the middle of the Rhine&#x27;s navigational lane, which here reaches one of its greatest breadths, comprising even the &quot;Königsklinger Aue&quot; (an island, although its name identifies it as a floodplain). At the bank behind the floodwall, at an elevation of some 82 m, it abuts a sandy plain which is used especially for growing asparagus and which is also covered in fruit trees. Just behind the floodwall is the outlying centre of Heidenfahrt. From here, before the channelling work on the &quot;Mariannenaue&quot; (floodplain) was broadened towards the east, there was once a ferry link to Erbach. The community core of Heidesheim itself lies some 2 km from the Rhine&#x27;s banks, in a location safe from floodwaters at the foot of the Rhenish Hesse hill country. The municipal area stretches on from there up the north slope of these hills, reaching 2 km east of the municipality&#x27;s centre an elevation of 207 m above sea level. Wherever gaps in the fruit trees allow it, there is a broad view over the Rhine into the Rheingau, all the way to the western part of the Taunus’s main ridge, the Rheingau Range (&quot;Rheingaugebirge&quot;) with the &quot;Kalte Herberge&quot; and the &quot;Hallgarter Zange&quot; (mountains) as its highest elevations in the centre. In the east, near Uhlerborn, on the boundary with Budenheim, Heidesheim has a share of one of Rhenish Hesse&#x27;s few wooded areas.

As of late 2006 Heidesheim has a population of 7,195, and covers and area of 17.56 km².

=== Constituent communities ===

Heidesheim&#x27;s &quot;Ortsteile&quot; are Heidesheim, Heidenfahrt and Uhlerborn.

=== Neighbouring municipalities ===

Clockwise from the north, these are Eltville am Rhein (on the Rhine&#x27;s right, or north, bank), Budenheim, Mainz’s outlying centres of Gonsenheim and Finthen, the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; of Nieder-Olm, the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; of Gau-Algesheim and the town of Ingelheim

== History ==

Many finds from prehistory and early historical times confirm that Heidesheim am Rhein&#x27;s municipal area was settled as early as the New Stone Age (5500 to 2200 BC). Most have been chance finds. In Roman times, north of today&#x27;s community core, stood an extensive &quot;villa rustica&quot;, which was forsaken after the Germanic invasions in the early 5th century. Within its walls was built Saint George&#x27;s Chapel (&quot;Sankt Georgskapelle&quot;), around which, after the mid 7th century, Frankish settlers came to live. The municipality&#x27;s name is said to go back to an estate owned by a Frankish nobleman called Heisino.

The place had its first documentary mention as &quot;Heisinisheim&quot; or &quot;Hasinisheim&quot; in donations to the Lorsch Abbey, the earliest of which purports to date from 762, although in actuality it can only be traced back to some time between September in one of the years between 765 and 768. The earliest confirmed date is 5 July 768. All together, the Lorsch codex catalogues ten endowments for the Lorsch Abbey in Heidesheim between 765 or 768 and 794, of which however none crops up in later documents. This circumstance leads to the inference that Lorsch had already traded or sold its holdings in Heidesheim by the time the Codex was transferred to parchment between 1183 and 1195.

A wider array of documents referring to Heidesheim only comes to light about 1150. The Altmünster Abbey at Mainz then had at its disposal extensive landholdings and half the tithes. Whether these stemmed from the Rhine Counts (&quot;Rheingrafen&quot;), as one always reads, has yet to be confirmed. Besides this, in 1145, the first holding in Walsheim (a vanished village near Heidenfahrt) passed to Eberbach Abbey, laying the groundwork for the &quot;Sandhof&quot; (see Culture and sightseeing: Buildings below). Eventually, in 1158, the Lords of Winternheim were mentioned, who later named themselves after the castle, Burg Windeck, as the Lords of Winterau. Besides these three parties, who dominate the historical records, other Mainz monastic foundations and resident families held lands and rights here.

While the Lords of Winternheim began work on Burg Windeck in the earlier half of the 12th century, the actual settlement around Saint George&#x27;s Chapel apparently remained unfortified, or at least not amply so: when Archbishop Conrad of Wittelsbach was getting himself ready in 1200 to build Mainz&#x27;s city wall up again after it had been razed on Emperor Friedrich I&#x27;s orders in 1163, he obliged many villages in the outlying countryside to build their own respective sections. The Heidesheim dwellers had to contribute, arm and maintain five merlons, for which they enjoyed protection, defence, market rights and free buying and selling in the city.

Besides landholdings and income, Altmünster had the Heidesheim &quot;Vogtei&quot; and thereby sovereign rights over the village. Over the course of the centuries, the &quot;Vogtei&quot; passed through many holders’ hands: That it was held after 1250 by the Lords of Biegen, who gave it back to Altmünster on 13 February 1285 is clearly not so. The relevant document refers not to Heidesheim, but rather to Hattenheim in the Rheingau. Against this is that the Abbey appointed Werner von Winterau and his male heirs village &quot;Vögte&quot; on 31 January 1326. The lordly house of Winterau died out before 12 April 1372, on which day a Wilhelm von Scharpenstein was avouched as &quot;Vogt&quot;. From him the &quot;Vogtei&quot; passed on 14 July 1385 in inheritance along the male line to Dietrich Huth von Sonnenberg.

On 17 January 1414, the Archbishop of Mainz John II of Nassau documented that the abbess and convent of Altmünster at Mainz had transferred one third of the court at Heidesheim to the Archbishopric. Outside this arrangement were the &quot;Vogtei&quot; with all its appurtenances, the income and the landholdings that were part of the convent&#x27;s estate. This was confirmed in writing to the convent for all time by the Archbishop with the cathedral deacon&#x27;s and the cathedral capitular&#x27;s consent. Moreover, Altmünster was henceforth to be freed of all contributions and levies imposed by the Archbishop or the cathedral capitular. Both pledged henceforth to protect and defend the convent with all its holdings and rights – particularly the remaining two thirds of the court at Heidesheim Der Mainzer und Magdeburger Erzbischof Kardinal Albrecht von Brandenburg bestätigte die Verfügung seines Vorgängers am 22. Oktober 1522.

Such deals, under which Mainz ecclesiastical and monastic foundations yielded sovereign rights, which they could hardly assert through their own power, to the Archbishop against assurance and protection of their ownership rights were often struck in the time that followed. In Heidesheim&#x27;s case, this transfer led to the Archbishop&#x27;s &quot;Amtmann&quot; appearing alongside the Altmünster convent&#x27;s &quot;Vogt&quot;. Men known to have served as Archiepiscopal &quot;Amtmänner&quot; after 1414 on are, in 1481 Johann Langwerth von Simmern, and from 1565 to 1584 Mainz cathedral cantor Heinrich von Stockheim. Known &quot;Vögte&quot; from that same time are, from 1468 to 1489 Philipp von Stockheim, and from 1489 to 1524 Count Emmerich of Nassau and his male heirs, from 1524 to 1537 Ritter (“Knight”, or perhaps “Sir”) Rabe von Liebenstein, from 1537 to 1553 Hans Sifrid vom Oberstein, and from 1553, first Konrad, and then Hans Georg von Bicken. That the &quot;Amtmann&quot; and &quot;Vogt&quot; often annoyed each other can be seen in two trials fought by Heinrich von Stockheim and Hans Georg von Bicken before the Imperial Chamber Court.

When Hans Georg von Bicken found out that he would keep being denied inheritance along the male line, he asked Archbishop of Mainz Wolfgang von Dalberg on 10 November 1598 to change the Heidesheim &quot;Vogtei&quot;, which had been transferred to him and his cousins as a non-heritable fief, into a heritable fief. His request was never answered. Thus, when he died about 1608, the &quot;Vogtei&quot; passed back to Altenmünster. The convent seized the day: On advice that in these hard times they could no longer fulfil the demands that the remaining two thirds of the sovereign rights in Heidesheim required of them, the abbess and convent offered the Elector this two-thirds share. In return, the Archbishop – as had been done in 1414 and 1522 – was to protect holdings, rights and income in the village. The Archbishop accepted the transfer with the specified conditions on the very same day, which suggests that the matter had been being discussed for quite some time.

The year 1609 was a watershed in the municipality&#x27;s history. Altenmünster now only held patronage rights at Saint Philip&#x27;s and Saint James&#x27;s Parish Church; the convent could still suggest priests and bellringers, who had to be confirmed by the Archbishop. Furthermore, in spiritual matters, the archiepiscopal vicariate general was responsible, while in worldly matters Heidesheim was under an Electoral deputy. The offices of monasterial &quot;Vogt&quot; and Electoral &quot;Amtmann&quot; were forgone. Eventually, the Electoral Chamber gave out Windeck Castle – until then the &quot;Amtmann’s&quot; seat – as a heritable asset.

==== Saint George’s Chapel ====

===== Antiquity and Middle Ages =====

The &quot;Sankt Georgskapelle&quot; (Saint George&#x27;s Chapel) – in Heidesheim&#x27;s north between the railway line and the Autobahn from Mainz to Koblenz – is “built in the fully preserved space of a Roman&quot; villa rustica &quot;…of which today still…two walls going up under the roof, in parts with original painting on the jointing outside and wall plaster inside, are preserved.”

The chapel&#x27;s roughly 1,500-year building history has led to its beginnings being uncovered only bit by bit: Long were those sought – not least of all because of Bishop Sidonius&#x27;s patronage – in Frankish times. According to more recent investigations, one may presume that there was “in it a late-Antiquity country church” of the Bishop of Mainz, that not least of all because of that can be acknowledged “as an especially vital centre of Roman-Christian tradition”. “The chapel can be said to be…Rhenish Hesse’s oldest established religious structure”.

After 650, Frankish settlers came to live around Saint George&#x27;s Chapel. Their descendants expanded the chapel in the late 10th and early 11th century with an apse; at this time the triumphal arch imposts were built in. Further expansions came about 1200 – from this time may stem the consecrational inscription on the lintel of the walled-up door on the south façade: “GEWEIHT AM 23. APRIL”, Saint George&#x27;s Day (the first two words mean “consecrated on the”). At this time, Saint George&#x27;s was the parish church.

Saint George&#x27;s and its parish priest held title to a fourth of all incoming tithes in Heidesheim. From the Middle Ages two documents are known in which Saint George&#x27;s Chapel is mentioned. Both stem from documents that have come down from the Eberbach Monastery, and both deal with whether the &quot;Sandhof&quot; owed the priest the aforesaid tithe. While Provost Otto von Mariengreden could claim his entitlement between April and June from 1185 to 1196 as Heidesheim&#x27;s priest, an arbitrary ruling from 23 December 1278 under reference to Pope Alexander III (who had died in 1181) lays down in writing that Eberbach owed Erkenbold – “Priest of Saint George’s Church in Heisensheim” – no tithes from the &quot;Sandhof&quot;.

Once the village had been moved from the Rhine Plain onto the slope of the Dinkberg and Saint Philip&#x27;s and Saint James&#x27;s Parish Church had been built, Saint George&#x27;s Chapel lost its status as parish church, although it was not thereby forsaken. Rather, at roughly the same time, the apse was replaced with an enclosed quire. In the 15th century came further extensive conversions. That pilgrimages had begun as early as the Middle Ages is made plain by later accounts.

===== Modern times =====

After the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Saint George&#x27;s Chapel was held by Imperial Baron Philipp Erwein von Schönborn (d. 1668), who moved his family&#x27;s landholdings from the Taunus to the Middle Rhine and the Main. He acquired it because of the Altmünster Convent&#x27;s fourth of the tithes that were tied to it, of which sometime earlier – the exact circumstances are still unclear – Heidesheim&#x27;s parish priest had been stripped by the Convent, which was furthermore towards the end of, or just after, the Thirty Years&#x27; War – as almost always – in need of money. The priest&#x27;s livelihood was later disputed by the Convent, making his financial position anything but better.

In a description of the municipality put together by a Heidesheim priest between 1667 and 1677 and found in Johann Sebastian Severus&#x27;s (d. 1797) &quot;Dioecesis Moguntina&quot;, it says of Saint George&#x27;s Chapel:“Also standing on the field of Heidesheim is a chapel of Saint George, built in the beginning as a building with mean stonework, later expanded because of the crowd of pilgrims streaming there and manifestly hallowed. … After Saint George’s feast here in the village is, as ever, festively celebrated, the local community proceeds there in a festive Rogation procession and attend festive Mass and sermon. In the same way dwellers of Budenheim and Finthen come here on the Rogation days (the three days before Assumption, also used for the whole week).

“As an endowment this chapel enjoys the fourth part of all tithes. And in the year 1665, it was built anew by Baron Philipp Erwein von Schönborn, who is bound as its owner to pay the priest of Heidesheim each year at Saint George’s feast for Mass and sermon two &quot;Gulden&quot;, but the choristers three &quot;Gulden&quot;. From these alms the first vespers in the chapel are also to be defrayed.”

The Heidesheim dwellers kept true to Saint George&#x27;s Chapel through the centuries: when it was being rebuilt in 1665 they transported the lumber from the Rhine to the chapel and set it up there. And when the chapel burnt down again in 1776, Father Michael Priester pressed for the archiepiscopal vicariate general to work towards getting the Count of Schönborn to build it anew. Witnessing the church&#x27;s Baroque décor is a statue of Saint George, which today is kept in the Heidesheim Catholic parish hall.
When France annexed the Rhine&#x27;s left bank in 1797, Saint George&#x27;s Chapel passed to the state. The tithes were abolished, and the pilgrimages suspended. When it was announced that the job of tearing the chapel down was to be auctioned to the highest bidder, the Heidesheim dwellers sprang to the chapel&#x27;s defence: The president of the church board, the mayor and the parish priest asked the prefect of the department of Donnersberg, Jeanbon St. André, to relinquish Saint George&#x27;s Chapel to the Church. The motion was granted.

Thereafter it became still around Saint George&#x27;s Chapel. In the legendary handbook by Georg Dehio, the reader seeks it in vain. And in 1934, Ernst Krebs wrote:“Thus now still stands Saint George’s sanctuary so lonely and forlorn there below as it did hundreds of years ago, and if one enters the church’s humble interior, one feels in this room as if sent back to a vanished time and only a train abruptly roaring by destroys the illusion and recalls the gap that divides the beginnings of the old place of worship from the present.

Even in the new edition of Dehio&#x27;s handbook supplied by Ernst Gall, Saint George&#x27;s Chapel is missing. Only in the third edition published in 1972 does one find an appraisal:“Alone in the field northern Heidesheim, near the former Mainz-Bingen Roman road: hall structure with plain enclosed quire and profiled triumphal arch pillars, probably 10th century (cf. the imposts of the hall church in Nieder-Ingelheim). In the south wall walled-up portal with consecrational inscription on the lintel. West portal and window changed in the 15th century. Remnants of Baroque décor.”.

The public esteem for the oldest and most important building in Heidesheim that has been steadily growing since then is something for which the Heidesheim Saint George&#x27;s Chapel Promotional Association (&quot;Förderverein St. Georgskapelle Heidesheim e.V. &quot;), above all, is to be thanked. Since 1984 it has tirelessly set itself to restoring the building. Today the chapel looks to be in a worthy state both inside and outside, although there is yet much work to be done. It is once again being used for church services. In the coming years, the Association will be undertaking digs in the area around the chapel and thereby promoting the scientific opening of the Roman &quot;villa rustica&quot; and the Frankish settlement bound up with it.

==== Windeck Castle ====

===== The Lords of Winternheim and Lords of Winterau =====

Windeck Castle (&quot;Burg Windeck&quot;) lies in the municipality&#x27;s north, south of the railway station. For centuries it stood on the village&#x27;s northern edge – whence its name Wintereck or Windeck (&quot;Ecke&quot; means “corner” or “edge” – and is cognate with the latter – in German). The widely held notion that the castle was built in or about the year 1209 is something that needs to be set right. Herdegen I of Winternheim might have built the four-sided defensive tower in the middle before 1150. The arbitrary ruling from 1209, on the other hand, mentions “lands and buildings” that his like-named son, Herdegen II, “has taken away from the Brothers of Eberbach in Heidesheim and upon which he has built his house’s wall and moat”. In 1209, then, it was a castle zone expansion that was being discussed; the castle itself was already standing.

A notice from the years 1211 to 1234 shows that there was a further castle zone expansion. At that time, Herdegen – most likely a son of Herdegen II, and thereby the third who went by this name – and a man named Embricho – possibly this Herdegen&#x27;s brother – from Eberbach Monastery “the part of a vineyard on which they built their castle’s moat”. Windeck might have looked much as Karl Bronner has reconstructed it no later than that: in the centre the four-sided tower with entrance and wooden parapet eight metres high, girded by an inner wall with a moat and an outer wall, through which flowed either the Sülzbach or the flood channel. Between the walls stood living and working buildings. The core may only have served as a refuge, as suggested by the tower&#x27;s limited land area and its difficult access.

Whether the Lords of Winternheim came from Groß-Winternheim or Klein-Winternheim cannot be answered without further investigation. In 1235 they were named for the first time as the Lords of Winterau and thereby by the name that they bore in the time that followed. Father Hermann Bär has carefully uttered the assumption hitherto held up as certainty that the Lords’ estate before the middle of the 13th century passed by way of a daughter of the house temporarily to the Lords of Leien. In so doing he refers to a document by which the brothers Philipp, Friedrich and Heinrich of Leien ceded for themselves and their heirs all rights at the &quot;Sandhof&quot; to Eberbach Monastery, which for its part forwent all levies that it had imposed on them and their father.

Hermann Bär and those who follow him, though, have something working against them: First, it is unclear whether in the document in question it actually says &quot;milites in Leien&quot;, as it might rather be a question of an abbreviation mark over one of the I&#x27;s, which would yield &quot;milites in Leheim&quot; instead. Thus it is with a later remark on the back of the document. Therefore, it has not been determined what rights the document was dealing with at all. Whatever the truth, the Lords of Winterau had already ceded the &quot;Vogtei&quot; rights that they had held over nine and a half &quot;Hufen&quot; of the &quot;Sandhof&quot; to the monks of Eberbach in 1209. Above all, though, Herdegen III of Winterauis named as a witness in documents issued in 1242 and 1255.

The Lords of Winterau owned and lived at Windeck Castle from their beginnings before 1150 up until the family died out in the latter half of the 14th century. In 1326 the Convent of Altmünster at Mainz enfeoffed them with its &quot;Vogtei&quot; in Heidesheim. In a judgment from 12 April 1372, Wilhelm von Scharpenstein is named as &quot;Vogt&quot; of the court of Heidesheim and a &quot;hern Wernher selgen von Wynthirauwe&quot; is named as his neighbour. The word &quot;selgen&quot; there means “late” – the House of Winterau was no more.

===== 15th to 20th century =====

To whom Windeck Castle passed once the Lords of Winterau were gone is shrouded in darkness. Perhaps it ended up with the Altmünster Convent, which might then have passed it on in 1414, together with a third of the Heidesheim court, to Archbishop of Mainz John II of Nassau. In 1481, the archiepiscopal &quot;Amtmann&quot; of Heidesheim, Johann Langwert von Simmern, lived at the castle. His successor, Heinrich von Stockheim, had his own seat built after 1577 in the form of the &quot;Schlossmühle&quot; (“Castle Mill”). Whether his successor moved back into the castle is uncertain. Whatever happened, Windeck was still owned by the Court Chamber (&quot;Hofkammer&quot;), which then granted Samuel Becker, the cellarmaster (winemaker) at the Martinsburg (a now vanished castle) at Mainz the castle, the estate and the eighth of the Heidesheim tithes that came along with those in 1629, as a heritable holding.

In the description of the Parish of Heidesheim drawn up sometime between 1667 and 1677 in Johann Sebastian Severus&#x27;s &quot;Dioecesis Moguntina&quot;, it says:“On the edge of the village towards the Rhine one beholds farther away the castle house at the Wintereck which in the year 1626 Samuel Beck, chief cellarmaster at Mainz, acquired for himself and his family along with the forest, meadows, fields and cereal tributes for 800 &quot;Gulden&quot; and today has outfitted with an appealing building and fruit trees. Towards the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the notorious cavalry general Johann von Werth is said to have lived at the castle. After 1650, it ended up with the Barons of Bockenheim, who thereafter held it for roughly 150 years on a heritable lease. The family had entitlement to pewage and burial in the parish church.

When the French occupied Electoral Mainz on 21 October 1793, Windeck Castle, as an ecclesiastical and noble holding, was seized. The von Bockenheim family emigrated to Austria. Only Katharina Elisabeth von Bockenheim stayed in Heidesheim, where in 1844 she died at the great age of 95. The Windeck was auctioned off sometime in 1802 or 1803 as state property. The new owner was a Wackernheim townsman named Radicke. His widow handed the property on to the Mainz businessmen Reinach and Popp, who in the second fourth of the 19th century kept a tannery there. In the 1860s, the family Krebs acquired the Windeck. Otto Krebs ran a winery in it with an inn. After 1908, beginning with Christmas, the Evangelical parish held its church services in the hall on the ground floor. In 1984, the castle was, as once before, a private home.

At the time of the Lords of Winterau, the castle&#x27;s outer girding wall enclosed an extensive area, as still witnessed today by the cadastral names &quot;Hinter den Ziunen&quot; or &quot;Hinter den Zäunen&quot; (“Behind the Fences”) and &quot;In der Zingel&quot; or &quot;In der Ringmauer&quot; (“In the Girding Wall”). After the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the citizens of Heidesheim began to use this wall as a quarry, tearing it down in the process. Andreas Trauttner&#x27;s 1754 map shows the Windeck already in the shape seen today. The originally open area between the tower and the inner wall is covered by a gabled roof and thus used as a stately home stretching across the north, east and southeast around the tower. In the southwest and west, the wall has been levelled, through which the tower on the building&#x27;s western edge rises. It is likely that Samuel Beck gave it this shape after 1626. The ogival-arch portal and the large-scale crossbar windows (windows divided by cross-shaped spars into groups of four windows) in Gothic Revival style stem from the time after 1860, as does the room layout inside. The outbuildings shown in the cadastral plans from 1812 and from 1841 to 1843 have disappeared.

When the municipality of Heidesheim acquired Windeck Castle in 1993, it was in a state of ruin. Since then, the municipality has undertaken great pains to bring the building into a respectable state: First, the elaborate roof framework and the roof, and then the entrance doors and windows were renovated. The building was newly plastered, given a coat of Mainz red from the Late Middle Ages, and the tower was decorated in natural colours. Finally, a staircase was built into the tower, which leads up to the former roof level with its impressive view. In its efforts to raise the Windeck from its ruins, the municipality is tirelessly and enthusiastically supported by the club &quot;Heimatmuseum Burg Windeck e.V.&quot;. Volunteer helpers take care of this still considerable property.

==== The Castle Mill ====

===== The Lords of Winterau, of Stockheim and of the Leyen (1317-1793) =====

The Castle Mill (&quot;Schlossmühle&quot;) lies at Heidesheim&#x27;s southwest edge at the foot of the cadastral area of Sommerau. There Sir Werner of Winterau owned land that he bequeathed to his sons in his will of 16 August 1317. Ernst Krebs has presumed that on the Castle Mill&#x27;s lands was a farm whose land was already being worked by Sir Werner&#x27;s forebear Herdegen II. That he moved from there to the castle in 1209 does not make sense – on 27 October 1577, Hans Georg von Bicken (d. 1608) sold Heinrich von Stockheim (d. 1588) the Castle Mill area. Hans Georg von Bicken, from the family Bicken, was the Electoral Mainz vicegerent (&quot;Vitztum&quot;) in the Rheingau and &quot;Vogt&quot; of the Mainz Convent of Altmünster in Heidesheim; Heinrich von Stockheim was cathedral cantor at Mainz, povost of Saint Alban&#x27;s Abbey there and Electoral &quot;Amtmann&quot; in Heidesheim.

In the years that followed, Heinrich von Stockheim had the still-preserved Renaissance building and the adjoining chapel tower built on the site of a simple mill building. They served him as an official seat and a dwelling. At the same time the main building housed a mill that with surrounding barns and stables formed an economic hub of extensive lands and of rich revenues, which Heinrich von Stockheim acquired in Heidesheim beginning in 1565.

In the description of the Parish of Heidesheim drawn up sometime between 1667 and 1677 in Johann Sebastian Severus&#x27;s &quot;Dioecesis Moguntina&quot;, it says of the Castle Mill:“Incidentally, an important mill is vaunted – with a great house, barns and stalls, garden and other appurtenances. It was built in 1577 by a member of the family Stockheim, who was cathedral cantor in Mainz and village &quot;Amtmann&quot;.”

The Castle Mill remained in Heinrich von Stockheim&#x27;s heirs’ ownership until Kurt von Lützow and his son Ernst Christoph sold the &quot;Stockheimische Wohnhaus&quot; on 28 September 1677 along with appurtenances, holdings and revenue in Heidesheim, Framersheim, Gau-Bickelheim and Selzen (near Alzey) to Elector of Mainz Damian Hartard von der Leyen (d. 1678) and his heirs. Thereafter the property found itself owned by the Lords – beginning in 1711 Counts – of the Leyen, who administered their scattered holdings on the Moselle and the Rhine first from Koblenz and beginning in 1773 from Blieskastel (Saarpfalz) and gave out the Castle Mill on a heritable lease. Information about the time from 1677 to 1793 is promised by the contents of the archives of the (beginning in 1806) Princes of the Leyen, which in 1995 ended up in the Rhineland-Palatinate Main State Archive in Koblenz, but hitherto not much of this information has been forthcoming.

===== The dark 19th century, Krebs, Schön, Schmidt (1793-1920) =====

From the end of the 18th on into the latter half of the 19th century, the Castle Mill&#x27;s ownership history raises more questions than it answers: on 21 October 1793, French Revolutionary troops occupied Electoral Mainz; on 4 November 1797, France annexed the Rhine&#x27;s left bank; on 9 February 1801 the German Empire ceded the area to France in the Treaty of Lunéville. Noble and ecclesiastical holdings were seized for the French State and publicly auctioned. Whether or not the Castle Mill met with this fate, it was restored on 25 June 1804 by Napoleon to Count Philipp Franz von der Leyen (d. 1829), and he later sold it – no later than 1820 – when the prince was getting rid of his last holdings on the Middle Rhine, only to acquire Schloss Waal (a castle in Ostallgäu) a few years later.

The archives of the Princes of the Leyen are yielding as little about the upheavals of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars as about the time before this, and as for the decades that followed, no information is forthcoming about the Castle Mill. Although the cadastral plans from 1812 and 1841 to 1843 offer a scale drawing of the property, they say nothing about the castle&#x27;s owners. The municipality&#x27;s cadastral register lays down in writing on 26 July 1865 that the estate owners were August Krebs (d. 1905?) and his wife Elisabeth, &quot;née&quot; Schmahl, who had acquired the Castle Mill by way of trade – from whom it is unknown.

Karl Sturm reports that Klara Fauerbach owned a &quot;notarielle Beurkundung&quot; (“notarized certification”) about 1970 according to which her grandfather August Krebs “bought the Castle Mill property on 4 February 1870 for 22,000 &quot;Gulden&quot; from Franz Hembes, mayor and estate owner in Ober-Olm, who had earlier acquired it from the miller Michael Hembes for 20,000 &quot;Gulden&quot;. According to information from Mrs. Fauerbach, her grandparents were then in possession of the property until 1905…”. Since the buying and selling dates and the circumstances of the transaction are at odds with the official data in the cadastral register, the whole business must be approached with caution.

August Krebs ran on the lands, besides agricultural operations, three mills: one sawmill, which was most likely housed in the southwest in the area bordering the &quot;Praumenmühle&quot; (not one of his mills), a gristmill, which without doubt was housed in the main building, and an oil mill, which might have been found in the little quarrystone building in the north leaning against the property&#x27;s west perimeter wall and dating from before 1841. As the J. Schmitt steam mill in Mainz-Mombach expanded in the early years of the 20th century, the traditional watermills in the area became ever less profitable, and August Krebs&#x27;s mills shut down as surely as the rest. It is likely that they stopped running with his death.

On 17 June 1918 August Krebs&#x27;s heirs sold the Castle Mill for 48,000 paper marks or 38,400 gold marks to the Wiesbaden engineer Michael Schön and his wife Maria Susanna, &quot;née&quot; Zahn. They sold it again only a year later, on 25 June 1919 for 62,500 paper marks or 19,437 gold marks – and 50 Pfennigs – to the Wiesbaden master painter Karl Schmidt and his wife Luise, &quot;née&quot; Krüger, who provided the rather shabby building with a coat of paint, but less than a year later they sold it again, on 7 May 1920 for 180,000 paper marks or 15,822 gold marks, to the Wiesbaden court apothecary Max Holländer.

The prices that Michael Schön and Karl Schmidt paid for the Castle Mill and for which they sold it bespeak their use of the property at the end of the First World War in the run on tangible assets or for speculation. Neither took any measures to move his household to Heidesheim, and instead let the building. Not so Max Holländer; for health reasons he was obliged to flee the Wiesbaden climate and move with his wife into the Castle Mill. Wealth was obviously something that he did not lack.

===== Max and Sofie Holländer (1920-1929) Max and Johanna Hollander (1930-1938) =====

In the years after 1920 to 1929 Max and Sofie Holländer shaped the ruined Castle Mill into a true jewel. In 1929 Max and Sofie Hollander divorced and in 1930 Max Hollander married Johanna Hollander. In 1934, Nikolaus Haupt reported in the municipality&#x27;s newssheet about the renovation:“It was carried out from the mighty cellar vaults with the foundation, which here and there is more than two metres thick, up to the loft and it was worked in a radical way. From the three-floor loft, the lower floor was also expanded into dwelling rooms. The important works were performed almost wholly by Heidesheim tradesmen. In the main it is a matter of artistic wall and ceiling coverings, which are made to match the building’s character and which have already enjoyed much attention and approval from professionals. The works are an honorific attestation for former applied arts student and now master joiner Peter Schlitz’s mastery and achievement here.

“In the left wing beside the main building’s entrance is found the former Castle Chapel, a rectangular room with two dainty cross vaults resting in the middle on a column. Even this the owner has in mind to have converted to its former purpose. The property thus represents as a whole through the renovation and careful handling an important jewel within the municipality of Heidesheim.”

In 1938, when Max Holländer had to accept that as a Jew he could no longer remain in Germany, he announced:“Castle property on the Rhine for sale immediately, Near Mainz! Renaissance building under conservation! Enthusiast’s item! Rarity value! The property, some 5 minutes away from the railway station – Basel-Holland, Frankfurt-Paris lines – forms a complete whole in one plan, utterly enclosed, and comprises over 11 000 m² estate area, built-up area, orchard and vegetable garden (choice fruit, almond trees, choice chestnuts), 2 work buildings supplied by heat from the house. The property has its own spring flowing through it, so that the garden is watered with its own water. The spring can also be used to generate electric power.

“The castle, a Renaissance building from the time about 1160, in finished quarrystones with quoins at the corners, steep slate roof and high Renaissance gables, contains the following: In the cellar: vaulted stock cellar, wine cellar, heating cellar with coke cellar (water heating); on the ground floor: entrance hall, reception room, 4 spacious rooms, 2 maids’ rooms, adjoining bath for household servants, WC; on the first floor: 4 spacious livingrooms, 2 kitchen rooms, 1 ironing room, WC; on the second floor: 5 spacious livingrooms/bedrooms, bath, WC; in the loft: floor space (woodwork made of heavy oak); 1 side building contains: washkitchen, gardener’s dwelling, storage space; 1 stable building contains: stable (for horses and cattle, swine), garage, hay floor; 1 further side building contains: chicken coop, equipment room – electric lighting, gas, sewerage, bath, in the rooms running warm and cold water, heating, telephone, radio at hand.

“Of high artistic and historical worth is the tasteful interior décor, which also matches the castle’s building style, of individual rooms with wall and ceiling coverings made of wood, in parts velvet covering on the room walls, as well as the genuine-style furnishings, which also fit the house’s character, of individual rooms. With much artistic taste and finest style sensitivity the owner has decorated the property. Wonderful master paintings, much genuine carpets and much more complete the whole image of this property, whose uniqueness and cultural-historical worth is marked by the fact that the castle has been placed under conservation…”

It was not enough that Max and Sofie and Johanna Holländer supplied work to Heidesheim craftsmen in economically hard times; they had to further prove themselves worthy, and this they did lavishly: Max Holländer – if not wholly selflessly – had the Grabenstraße (road) paved at his own expense, on which his chauffeur drove him to Wiesbaden each morning and back in the evening. And at Christmastime, Mrs. Hollander went with a basket on her arm down the Grabenstraße, to give gifts out to the children. Older fellow citizens remember today: “a good-hearted woman!” The impositions against the couple as Jews that had been happening since 1933 grew even worse:

After the Second World War, Johanna Holländer reported that already in May 1933, the Bingen Gestapo were extorting money from her husband and her. One month later the mayor of Heidesheim arrested Max Holländer, whom his driver had denounced, and transferred him to Osthofen concentration camp. After a few weeks, he was moved to the prison there, where his wife was also being held. After almost ten weeks, both were allowed to betake themselves, under police supervision, to a sanatorium in Bad Nauheim. In late September 1933, the Mainz regional court acquitted the couple.

Beginning on 1 April 1934, Max and Johanna Holländer lived once again at the Castle Mill. The municipal administration&#x27;s chicanery, though, steadily grew. In 1938 the couple wanted to sell the property pu blicly (see above) – too late. On 10 November 1938 – the day after Kristallnacht – Max and Johanna Holländer were sitting on packed cases when the Gestapo and municipal officials violently forced their way into the Castle Mill, arrested Max Holländer and took him to the Town Hall. There, the mayor, a councillor and a notary forced him under duress to donate his whole estate to the municipality.

At the same time the couple had to give notice in Heidesheim of their departure and go to Wiesbaden on the next train. There, Max Holländer was arrested at the railway station and taken to Buchenwald concentration camp. Released after 14 days, the couple managed to emigrate in late May 1939. Their way led through the Philippines to New York, where on 10 December 1941, Max Holländer died.

===== Municipality of Heidesheim (1938-1956) =====

As early as 11 November 1938, the day after Max and Johanna Holländer&#x27;s arrest, there appeared an article in the Gau-Algesheim, Heidesheim and Wackernheim community newssheet under the headline “An Old Historical Building in Ownership of Municipality of Heidesheim”; it could hardly have been full of more hypocrisy and spite:“The Castle Mill – the oldest building of the Municipality of Heidesheim – passed on 10 November as a donation into the ownership of the Municipality of Heidesheim. Yesterday, 12:45, the owner up to now, Max Holländer, made the building over to the municipality’s ownership through a provisional agreement – of his own free will and influenced by no party. And thus has the long-fostered wish for the property one day to pass to the municipality become reality. Holländer for a long time had the thought of putting the building at the disposal of the Municipality of Heidesheim.”

On the Sunday after Max and Johanna Holländer had been driven out – 20 November 1938 – the municipality opened the Castle Mill with admission at ten Pfennigs so that the citizens could themselves get an idea of the opulence in which the Jews “splurged”, while ethnic Germans were starving. More than 1,000 people gathered. So big was the throng that the spectacle was repeated the next Sunday “by popular demand”.

Thereafter it became oddly quiet about the Castle Mill. Obviously the municipality knew that it had started nothing right with its long yearned-for property, the more so as the Bingen district office brought the donation into doubt, since it was against Nazi principles – if such things could be said to exist – to accept gifts from Jews. Only in 1940 were the ownership relationships clarified, when the Municipality of Heidesheim paid 3,930 Reichsmark into “emigrant” Max Holländer&#x27;s frozen account, thus changing the apparent donation into a sale. The municipality, though, had long before let out the Castle Mill to the military authorities in Mainz for dwelling purposes. There followed bombed-out families and refugees from Mainz – all in all up to eight parties.

After the end of the Second World War, Johanna Holländer filed suit – obviously from New York – on 20 May 1949 for compensation. In the case of the Castle Mill she sought to get it back and to be paid damages in the amount of DM100,000. Once she had come back to Wiesbaden, the embittered woman pursued the case doggedly and forcefully. When on 22 July 1954 the Fifth Civil Chamber of the Mainz Regional Court awarded her the Castle Mill and damages amounting to DM49,400 together with 4% interest since 20 May 1949, she launched an appeal.

The case was long and drawn out and ended in a settlement, which after a series of expert opinions and various crime scene visits was drawn up on 19 November 1956 after being suggested by the Chief Magistrate presiding at the Third Civil Senate of the Koblenz Chief State Court. Johanna Holländer got the Castle Mill back together with the originally sought damages of DM100,000 and 4% interest since 20 May 1949. Together with the cost of the legal battle, the Municipality of Heidesheim had roughly DM150,000 to bear in costs.

===== Johanna Holländer and C. H. Boehringer Sohn (1956-present) =====

On 26 April 1957, Mayor Joseph Dillmann made a declaration of bankruptcy in the municipality&#x27;s newssheet:“After the speech by the municipality’s legal representative before municipal council, it has after due consideration and with a heavy heart accepted the settlement. Given the municipality’s weak legal position, however, the legal dispute, which went on for 7 years, can no longer be further pursued. The damage sum is only a substitute for the damages that the municipality must answer for; the Castle Mill remains the plaintiff’s property. The damage award comprises the compensation of the damage in buildings, gardening facilities and lost use.

“Through this financial burden the municipality’s budgetary economy is being put before some burdensome challenges. Nevertheless, the challenges necessary for the municipality’s further development must be continued. The damage sum can only be covered through the assumption of a short-term municipal credit. Amortization and interest payment must be dealt with out of the regular budget. An increase in property and business tax to 200 or 300 percent of the average state rates therefore cannot be avoided.”

And then came the late confession:“Perhaps those who are also responsible will recognize the injustice in which they – perhaps unwittingly – have been complicit, and that they have brought the municipality untold harm. It is needless to want to gloss over anything. It was a crime and the whole municipality must bear the consequences. Unfortunately, the main culprit cannot be held liable for compensation, since he owns nothing.”

The rest of the story can be told quickly: Whether Johanna Holländer ever saw the Castle Mill again is questionable. She had whatever still seemed usable fetched from the property. It was rather little, for the wood panelling had been used in the years of need after the war as firewood, and the velvet coverings on the walls had been made into children&#x27;s clothing. Besides that she settled for the income from the ongoing rental that the utterly ruined property was still bringing in.

Johanna Holländer died sometime before 29 January 1969. On this day the Castle Mill was entered in the Heidesheim register as belonging to her heirs: half went to each of the State League of Jewish Communities in Hesse (&quot;Landesverband der Jüdischen Gemeinde in Hessen&quot;) and Irgim Olèg Merkaz Europa in Tel Aviv. They could do little with the property and were glad when on 11 March 1970 it was sold off to Heidesheim building entrepreneur Theodor Kiese. Only a fortnight later, he passed it on to the Ingelheim pharmaceutical firm C. H. Boehringer Sohn.

C. H. Boehringer Sohn had the thoroughly run-down property renovated from the ground up as a representative residence for a member of the company&#x27;s board. When work had already proceeded to a great extent, the main and side buildings burnt down to the foundations and outer walls on 1 September 1971. The question of guilt was never settled. Under the monument authority&#x27;s strict conditions, C. H. Boehringer Sohn built the Castle Mill anew. From 1976 to 2000, the main building was used for presentations and seminars. Since 2000 it has housed the office of the business association&#x27;s and shareholders’ foundations: Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds, foundation for basic medical research; Boehringer Ingelheim Stiftung; and Geschwister Boehringer Ingelheim, foundation for the humanities.

=== Regular events ===

On the first Sunday in May, the kermis (church consecration festival, locally known as the &quot;Kerb&quot;) is held. The first Sunday in October is the time for the Harvest Festival (&quot;Erntedankfest&quot;) with a major parade, an exhibition of fruits and agricultural products and visits from partner towns in France and Germany.

=== Clubs ===

Like many German villages and small towns, Heidesheim is home to many associations, clubs and groups, in German known as &quot;Vereine&quot;. They are a major part of civic life and cover many aspects of people&#x27;s leisure time:

1. Sports association with many divisions, e.g. soccer, hockey, athletics, tennis
2. Choirs: men&#x27;s, ladies’ and children&#x27;s choirs, church choirs and mixed choirs
3. Marching bands offer regular concerts, perform at local and regional festivities and provide extensive training for young people aspiring to master musical instruments.
4. Church youth and adult groups cover all ages and both sexes. Examples are KJG and KFD
5. Special interest clubs exist for dog owners, poultry, chess, the preservation of historical monuments (especially Saint George&#x27;s Chapel), photography, and so on.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Transport ===

Heidesheim lies on the Autobahn A 60, which can be reached through interchanges 16 (west) and 17 (east).

Through the two railway stations &quot;Uhlerborn&quot; and &quot;Heidesheim (Rheinhessen)&quot;, there are two connections to local rail transport on the West Rhine Railway (KBS 470). The two nearest long-distance railway stations are Bingen and Mainz Hauptbahnhof.

Heidesheim is also linked to the Ingelheim/Mainz bus system (route 620), which runs to Ingelheim in the west and to Budenheim, Mainz Mombach and Mainz Hauptbahnhof in the east, therefore fundamentally following the same route as the train. Thus far there is still no direct bus link to the neighbouring Mainz constituent communities of Gonsenheim and Finthen. There are initiatives, though.

=== Established businesses ===

In the Uhlerborn commercial area are found a gardening centre (Dehner), two supermarkets (Aldi, Edeka) and two bakeries. Moreover, there are a printshop, a carpentry shop, a building firm and a few smaller businesses.

<doc id="654172" wikidata="Q6275191" url="?curid=654172" title="Jones Day">
<text>Jones Day is an American multinational law firm based in Washington, D.C. As of 2023, it is one of the largest law firms in the United States, with 2,302 attorneys, and among the highest-grossing in the world with revenues of $2.5 billion. Founded in 1893, the firm was originally headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. It has represented over half of the companies in the Fortune 500, including Goldman Sachs, General Motors, McDonald&#x27;s, and Bridgestone. Jones Day has also represented the campaign of current president Donald Trump.

Many attorneys from Jones Day have served as federal officials or judges, including U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, former White House Counsel Don McGahn, former U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, former Federal Trade Commission chairwoman Deborah Platt Majoras, and U.S. court of appeals judges Jeffrey Sutton, Gregory G. Katsas, Timothy B. Dyk, Chad Readler, and Eric E. Murphy.

Jones Day has historically focused on corporate law, but has increasingly shifted to aiding the Republican Party and the American conservative movement since 2000. This shift began when Stephen Brogan became managing partner of Jones Day in 2003. Subsequently, the firm increasingly took on ideologically charged cases and causes. During the Barack Obama administration, Jones Day challenged the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The firm also served as outside counsel for the Trump 2016 and Trump 2020 campaigns.

== History ==
Jones Day was founded in Cleveland in 1893 as Blandin &amp; Rice by two partners, Edwin J. Blandin and William Lowe Rice. Frank Ginn joined the firm in 1899, and it changed its name to Blandin, Rice &amp; Ginn. Rice was murdered in August 1910. In 1912, Thomas H. Hogsett joined the firm as partner, and it became Blandin, Hogsett &amp; Ginn that year, and Tolles, Hogsett, Ginn &amp; Morley a year later after the retirement of Judge Blandin and the addition of partners Sheldon H. Tolles and John C. Morley. After Morley retired, in 1928, the firm adopted the name Tolles, Hogsett &amp; Ginn.

In its early years, the firm was known for representing major industries in the Cleveland area, including Standard Oil and several railroad and utility companies.

In November 1938, then managing partner Thomas Jones led the merger of Tolles, Hogsett &amp; Ginn with litigation-focused firm Day, Young, Veach &amp; LeFever to create Jones, Day, Cockley &amp; Reavis. The merger was effective January 1, 1939. The firm&#x27;s Washington, D.C., office was opened in 1946, becoming the firm&#x27;s first office outside Ohio. In 1967, the firm merged with D.C. firm Pogue &amp; Neal to become Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue.

Jones Day has a reputation for representing companies against labor unions.

===International expansion===
The international expansion of Jones Day began in 1986 when the firm merged with boutique law firm Surrey &amp; Morse, a firm of 75 attorneys with international offices in New York City, Paris, London, and Washington, D.C. In the following years, the firm expanded to Hong Kong, Brussels, Tokyo, Taipei, and Frankfurt.

=== Republican Party and conservative politics ===
Jones Day has historically focused on corporate law, but has increasingly shifted to aiding the Republican Party and the American conservative movement since the 2000. This shift began when Stephen Brogan became managing partner of Jones Day in 2003. Subsequently, the firm increasingly took on ideologically charged cases and causes. During the Barack Obama administration, Jones Day challenged the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

During the first Donald Trump administration, Jones Day helped the administration to dismantle the administrative state, combat early voting, and place a citizenship question on the census. The firm provided services to Donald Trump for his personal legal problems, as well as helped the Donald Trump 2016 campaign amid investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election. This defense included trying to control which documents to hand over to investigators and which staff members to make available for interviews.

Jones Day partner Don McGahn, who was previously a member of the Federal Election Commission, served as counsel for the 2016 Trump presidential campaign and was later nominated to serve as Trump&#x27;s White House Counsel. As of March 2017, at least 14 Jones Day attorneys had been appointed to work for the Trump administration.

Jones Day was outside counsel for the Trump 2016 and Trump 2020 campaigns. From 2015 to November 2020, Jones Day received more than $20 million in fees from the Trump campaigns. Jones Day earned more than $4.5 million for Trump 2020 campaign work between January 1, 2019 and August 31, 2020.

In 2020, Jones Day was hired by Trump in his legal fight to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Joe Biden. The firm worked for Trump in trying to have courts toss out Pennsylvania mail votes. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jones Day &quot;was giving voice — and legal backing — to the president’s unsubstantiated fear-mongering about the possibility of an election tainted by fraud.&quot; However, the firm said it &quot;is not representing President Trump, his campaign, or any affiliated party in any litigation alleging voter fraud.&quot; Jones Day also said it &quot;is not representing any entity in any litigation challenging or contesting the results of the 2020 general election&quot; and that &quot;media reports to the contrary are false.&quot; According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jones Day&#x27;s post-election justifications for its role in the 2020 election &quot;blurred a basic fact: Jones Day and its lawyers were trying to stop votes from being counted, all in an effort to serve the client.&quot;

After Trump left office, Jones Day hired a significant number of former Trump administration lawyers, including Don McGahn and Noel Francisco.

When Trump became president again in January 2025, the Trump administration hired Jones Day partner Brett Shumate to lead its Civil Division. One of Shumate&#x27;s first actions was to defend an executive order by Trump that sought to rescind birthright citizenship. Shumate said that Trump&#x27;s order was constitutional to which Senior U.S. District Judge John Coughenour said, &quot;Frankly, I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar could state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order. It just boggles my mind.&quot;

== Operations ==

As of 2018, Jones Day was the fifth largest law firm in the U.S. and the 13th highest grossing law firm in the world. It is currently headquartered in Washington, D.C.

=== Compensation ===
The firm compensates each associate (after their first year) uniquely, based on the quality of their work and jurisdiction. Unlike many peer firms, Jones Day does not pay a year-end or mid-year bonus, compensating associates entirely with salary. Its attorneys&#x27; salaries are not public and are not determined solely by class year. The firm has long said that its &quot;black box&quot; compensation system breeds collegiality, and that its associates—even though they are not paid a bonus—generally earn the same as, or more than, associates at other major firms. New associates have a starting salary of US$225,000. Some associates have said that they are under-compensated compared to their peers at other firms, sometimes by tens of thousands of dollars, and that their compensation is much lower than what they were promised when they interviewed.

== Notable clients and cases ==
The firm&#x27;s attorneys have argued more than 40 cases before the United States Supreme Court. Some of the firm&#x27;s notable clients and cases include:

<doc id="654173" wikidata="Q1436229" url="?curid=654173" title="Campus radio">
<text>Campus radio (also known as college radio, university radio or student radio) is a type of radio station that is run by the students of a college, university or other educational institution. Programming may be exclusively created or produced by students, or may include program contributions from the local community in which the radio station is based. Sometimes campus radio stations are operated for the purpose of training professional radio personnel, sometimes with the aim of broadcasting educational programming, while other radio stations exist to provide alternative to commercial broadcasting or government broadcasters.

Campus radio stations are generally licensed and regulated by national governments, and have very different characteristics from one country to the next. One commonality between many radio stations regardless of their physical location is a willingness—or, in some countries, even a licensing requirement—to broadcast musical selections that are not categorized as commercial hits. Because of this, campus radio has come to be associated with emerging musical trends, including genres such as punk and new wave, alternative rock, indie rock, underground metal and hip hop, long before those genres become part of the musical mainstream. Campus radio stations also often provide airplay and promotional exposure to new and emerging local artists.

Many campus radio stations carry a variety of programming including news (often local), sports (often relating to the campus), and spoken word programming as well as general music. Often the radio format is best described as a freeform, with much creativity and individualism among the disc jockeys and show hosts. Some of these radio stations have gained critical acclaim for their programming and are considered by the community in which they are embedded to be an essential media outlet.

== Transmission ==
While the term &quot;campus radio&quot; implies full-power AM or FM transmission, a significant number of stations transmit with low-power broadcasting, closed circuit, and carrier current systems, in some cases to on-campus listeners only. Many universities and college stations today also broadcast via the internet, either as an additional outlet for their licensed stations or in lieu of obtaining a government-issued license. In addition, college programming is distributed through local cable television systems on cable FM or on the second audio programs of TV radio stations. 

==Campus radio around the world==
===Argentina===
The first (and one of the most popular) campus radio in Argentina&#x27;s history is LR11 Radio Universidad Nacional de La Plata, which belongs to the Universidad Nacional de La Plata. It was inaugurated on 5 April 1924 as an element of scientific dissemination and university extension, and it is the first university radio station in the world.

The most famous campus/college radio in the country, FM Radio Universidad (&quot;University Radio&quot;), is an Argentine radio station based in the city of Rosario, belonging to the National University of Rosario (UNR). It was created in 1994, and it has a strong focus on programs covering national/international news and current political topics of discussion, as well as AOR musical segments. The station transmits on 103.3 MHz.

===Brunei Darussalam===
UBD FM is the first university-based radio station in Brunei Darussalam. The student-run organization operates under the Educational and Technology Center of the Universiti Brunei Darussalam and was established in 2008.

===Canada===

In Canada, radio stations are regulated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), which provides that &quot;a campus radio station is a radio station owned or controlled by a not-for-profit organization associated with a post-secondary educational institution&quot;. The CRTC distinguishes two types of campus radio: &quot;instructional&quot; (for training of professional broadcasters) and &quot;community-based campus&quot; (programming provided by volunteers who are not training to be professionals). The community-based radio format is the predominant one, colloquially known as &quot;campus-community radio.&quot; In recent years, some community-based campus radio stations, including CFFF-FM in Peterborough and CJMQ-FM in Sherbrooke, have in fact had their CRTC licenses formally reclassified from campus radio to community radio.

Campus radio stations broadcasting at full power are assigned a permanent frequency and call letters and, aside from a requirement not to compete directly with commercial radio stations, are full players in the Canadian broadcasting spectrum. Campus radio stations in Canada are more commonly associated with universities than with colleges, although some colleges also have licensed campus radio stations. As well, some institutions maintain unlicensed campus radio operations which broadcast only by closed circuit, cable FM or Internet streaming. Also see United States section for more general information.

Canada&#x27;s oldest community-based campus radio station is CFRC at Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, which has been on the air since 1923; it began as a commercial radio station and a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation affiliate but became the country&#x27;s first university-owned station in 1942 and fully transitioned to a campus radio station in 1957. CJRT-FM, a campus radio station of the instructional type, has been on air since 1949.

The CRTC places responsibilities upon campus radio stations in Canada through the use of &quot;conditions of license&quot; that radio stations must follow in order to keep broadcasting. Campus radio stations, for example, are expected to be leaders in the Canadian content system which mandates a minimum number of Canadian musical selections throughout the day. The minimum Canadian content required for a campus station is 35%. Individual programs have their own requirements which depend on a particular program&#x27;s content category. Generally, for popular music programs (pop, rock, dance, country-oriented, acoustic, and easy listening), hosts must play a minimum of 35% Canadian content. Programs featuring Special Interest Music (concert, folk-oriented, world, blues, jazz, non-classic religious, and experimental) must have at least 12% Canadian content. In early 2005, Humber College&#x27;s radio station CKHC-FM became the first broadcast radio station in Canada to air 100% Canadian content. Other requirements generally made of campus radio stations include quotas of non-hit, folk, and ethnic musical selections as well as spoken word programming.

Most campus radio stations in Canada are members of the National Campus and Community Radio Association.

On 23 January 2012, the CRTC announced it would be eliminating instructional radio stations.

===Denmark===
There are five student radio stations in Denmark related to the largest universities in Denmark.
Only the town of Roskilde has a university and no permanent radio, but every year the five existing student radio stations work together in producing 10 days of radio on the Roskilde festival.
The project is a cooperation between all the student radios organized by the cooperation organization called DDS and could be considered a temporary radio station.

The five student radio stations in Denmark are listed below with the city they relate to in Denmark.
* Universitetsradioen in Copenhagen
* XFM Lyngby in Lyngby
* Odense studenterradio in Odense
* Arhus studenterradio in Århus
* Aalborg studenterradio in Aalborg

All the radios broadcast radio in local frequencies on FM in their related city. XFM actually has two departments one in Copenhagen and one in Lyngby and is the only radio who has two broadcast licenses.

The only one of the radio stations which broadcasts radio directly on campus is Aalborg student radio. As many of the American student radio Aalborg has speaker directly on the university where they can broadcast radio to the students cad Campus Rdio AAU.

===France===
Radio Campus France is a national, non-profit radio broadcasting network grouping 22 public college radio stations located in the largest French cities. Acting as an umbrellas for college radio in French public Universities, it proves that there is strength in numbers, and that music, technology and education are natural bedfellows. Not just a collection of disparate elements, Radio Campus is a vocal leader in the areas of digital broadcasting, keeping tabs on the development of terrestrial radio, as well as developing new network interfaces for radio stations across the nation to share content. With a broad music program, the playlist is powered by the passion of fans, and heralds a modern way for groups to interact in the social web. Whether through their support of regular residency shows from the likes of Beats In Space, or Warp Records, or broadcasting live from Gilles Peterson&#x27;s Worldwide Festival in Sete, it is the love of the music which connects the listeners, and that makes Radio Campus a unique and special group indeed.

===India===
Community groups in India, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have been campaigning for permission to set up &quot;community radio&quot; (CR) radio stations since the late 1990s.

News, as of November 2006, has it that the India cabinet decided to grant permission to non-profit organizations and educational institutions to set up community radio stations. The cabinet decision will allow civil society and voluntary organizations, state agriculture universities and institutions, Krishi Vigyan Kendras or agricultural science centers, registered societies and autonomous boards, and public trusts registered under Societies Act to start community radio stations. Broadcast Engineering Consultants of India is a government-owned corporation that helps setup of Community FM radio stations in India.

Ravi Shankar Prasad, the then Minister for Information and Broadcasting in the government, told India&#x27;s upper house of parliament the Rajya Sabha on 22 December 2003, that four organizations including Jammu University and Kashmir University were found ineligible for grant of license as per the laid down guidelines. The minister also ruled out any review of the policy despite limited response to the non-commercial, low-powered FM radio scheme which former information and broadcasting minister Sushma Swaraj had said would &quot;revolutionize&quot; radio broadcast in the country.

Radio enthusiast Alokesh Gupta saying: &quot;The announcement of the Government was to have seen 1000 radio stations by December 2003. Instead administrative wrangling came in the way of implementing the project as colleges spent time running around for licenses and approval from four ministries — Home Affairs, Communications &amp; Information &amp; Broadcasting — as they took their time processing applications.&quot;

On 2 February 2004, Anna University in Chennai unveiled the country&#x27;s first campus radio station, Anna FM. Radio Ujjas in Kutch (in the western state of Gujarat) is one such CR and gets its funding from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Central Government. Similarly, a community-based radio programme titled Panchayat Vani (People&#x27;s Voice) was recently broadcast on All India Radio (AIR), Darbhanga, Bihar. The campus radio station Gyanvaani has also been licensed.

Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences established a community radio station, Radio Adan (90.4 MHz) in 2008, which brings together experts, students, farmers, and local population, through various popular programmes, focussing on agriculture, education, employment, women empowerment, child marriage, health and culture.

Pune University is the first university in the state of Maharashtra to have an FM radio station. The University of Pune&#x27;s FM Radio inaugurated on 1 May 2005, has been named as Vidyavani. It covers a wide range of subjects, focusing specifically on the requirements of students of various departments and affiliated colleges. It reaches an area around the campus within eight-km radius.

Unsuccessful attempts have been also made to start CR without obtaining any permission. The small village of Orvakal in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh (South India) launched &quot;Mana Radio&quot; (Our Radio) in November 2002. This project run under the aegis of the Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty used a tiny transmitter that covered a radius of half a kilometer to enable rural women members of self-help groups. Four months later, officials from the Central Government brought in police to seize the equipment and declared the broadcasts illegal.

The Government policy to permit educational institutions to have their own FM Channels at low-frequency levels emerged in mid-December 2002, as a result of years of campaigning by activists and a strongly worded Supreme Court judgment directing the opening up of the airwaves.

A unique experiment in using media technologies, especially radio, for development and empowerment of marginalized, rural communities is the community radio initiative &quot;Chalo Ho Gaon Mein&quot; a programme that is broadcast once a week on AIR Daltonganj in the Palamu district of Jharkhand, eastern India. This radio programme is supported by the National Foundation for India and produced by Community representatives, of Alternative for India Development (AID), a non-governmental organization. School of Communication of Manipal also has its own campus radio.

Ravenshaw Radio 90.4 MHz is Odisha state&#x27;s first campus community radio station (CRS) of Ravenshaw University in Cuttack, Odisha. It started broadcasting in April 2011.

According to the terms of the campus broad license, a number of aspects are disallowed from broadcasts. This includes anything that offends good taste or decency, contains criticism of friendly countries, contains an attack on religion, contains anything obscene, defamatory, false, and suggestive innuendos and half-truths, likely to encourage or incite violence, contains anything affecting the integrity of the nation, criticizes, maligns or slanders any individual in person, encourages superstition or blind belief, denigrates women, denigrates children, or presents or depicts or suggests as desirable the misuse of drugs, alcohol, narcotics, and tobacco.

Belfield FM, University College Dublin.

Belfield FM is University College Dublin&#x27;s student radio station. The station began broadcasting in 1990. It was initially run as a part of the UCD Students&#x27; Union, under the remit of the entertainments office, before becoming an independent entity within the Students&#x27; Union. Belfield FM disaffiliated with the SU at the end of the 2011/2012 college year, and is now run independently within the UCD Societies Council framework. The station forms part of UCD&#x27;s &#x27;Student Media Network&#x27;, along with &quot;The University Observer&quot; and &quot;The College Tribune&quot;. The station is run by volunteer staff and contributors, and broadcasts on week-days as well as hosting a coterie of Podcasts on their Mixcloud account.

===Israel===
Campus radio also exists in Israel, where several colleges, universities, and high schools have successful programs. One of the most famous is Kol HaCampus (Voice of the Campus/Campus Voice), broadcast out of Tel Aviv on 106 MHz. More information can be found with the Israeli Broadcasting Authority. Another college radio station is the Hebrew University&#x27;s in Jerusalem, broadcasting mostly indie and alternative music.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, campus radio is generally referred to as &#x27;student radio&#x27;.

Founded in 1960, the University of Hertfordshire&#x27;s Campus Radio Hatfield (now Crush Radio) was the UK&#x27;s first student radio station, though it was a pirate radio station. This was followed by the first legal station, Radio Heslington (now University Radio York) in 1967, Swansea University&#x27;s Action Radio (now Xtreme Radio) in 1968, Stirling University&#x27;s University Radio Airthrey (now Air3 Radio) from 1970, University of Essex&#x27;s University Radio Essex in 1971, and Loughborough University&#x27;s Loughborough Campus Radio in 1973.

Some student radio stations operate on the FM waveband for short periods at a time under the Restricted Service Licence scheme, while others choose to broadcast full-time on the AM waveband using an LPAM license. There are only five UK student radio stations permitted to broadcast all year on LPFM. These are Xpression FM (Exeter), Radio Roseland (Truro, Cornwall), Storm FM (Bangor), Bailrigg FM (Lancaster) and 1386 HCR (Halesowen College). None of these licenses provides for a reception area greater than four kilometres from the point of transmission. To counteract these license restrictions and, in the case of AM broadcasts, poor quality audio, many radio stations simulcast on the Internet.

The UK Student Radio Association works on behalf of more than fifty UK-based member radio stations to further their development, encourage and facilitate communication between member radio stations and links to the commercial radio industry, and lobby for the membership&#x27;s interests on both a regional and national level. The association organises and hosts the annual Student Radio Awards in conjunction with BBC Radio 1.

===United States===

College radio (as it is generally known in the United States) became commonplace in the 1960s when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began issuing class D licenses for ten-watt radio stations to further the development of the then new FM band. Some colleges had already been broadcasting for decades on the AM band, often originating in physics experiments in the early 20th century.

One of the first college radio stations in the country is WRUC from Union College in Schenectady, New York. Its first experimental audio broadcasts under the call sign 2YU were in 1916. Regular programing for the public under call sign 2ADD began in 1920. WHUS, (the UConn HUSkies), the radio station of the University of Connecticut went on the air as WABL, a 100-watt AM radio station, in 1922 with two steel towers serving as the radio station&#x27;s antennae. In 1925 power increased to 500-watts and the call letters changed to WCAC (Connecticut Agricultural College, at that time the name of the university). Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida started WDBO (Way Down By Orlando) in 1924. WDBO was given away by Rollins College in 1926. College radio returned to Rollins College when the FM radio station, WPRK began broadcasting on 10 December 1952.

Most of the FM radio stations received higher-class licenses than ten watts, typically a few hundred watts. A few got several kilowatts, and a small handful got licenses in the range of tens of thousands, sometimes reaching up to maximum-power 100-kilowatt outlets. WRAS 88.5 FM and WREK 91.1 FM in Atlanta are the most powerful college radio stations, operating at 100,000 watts. WDAV 89.9 FM in Davidson, North Carolina also operates at 100,000 watts, although the Davidson College administration now controls this station instead of students. Still, due to strict class D regulations, some radio stations were prohibited from a wattage upgrade for possible signal interference with adjacent radio stations, such as KWUR 90.3 FM interfering with KWMU 90.7 FM in St. Louis, Missouri. KTUH 90.3 FM in Honolulu, Hawaii has had many increases in its wattage since they started broadcasting at 10 watts as a Non-commercial educational FM radio station in 1969. In 1984 KTUH received permission from the board of regents to increase to 100 watts of power. More recently, in 2001, KTUH began transmitting at 3000 watts of power. KTUH is heard on an island wide frequency in Honolulu, Hawaii from 90.1 FM, as well as online at KTUH.ORG and on digital cable channel 866.

The earliest college radio stations carried news, intercollegiate sports, and music along with educational shows and sometimes distance learning courses. In the latter portion of the 20th century, many U.S. radio stations played what came to be known as &quot;college rock&quot; (later known as alternative rock), a type of rock music that had not yet hit the mainstream. Most radio stations have now diversified, with many following a very commercial-like music rotation during the weekdays, and having specialty shows on evenings and weekends. A few radio stations still employ a freeform programming.

College radio stations are typically considered to be public radio radio stations in the way that they are funded by donation and grants, but as a radio format the term &quot;Public radio&quot; generally refers to classical music, jazz, and news. A more accurate term is community radio, as most staff are volunteers, although many radio stations limit staff to current or recent students instead of anyone from the local community.

By the late 1970s, FM had taken off, and competition for channels for new radio stations was intensifying. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) and the newly founded National Public Radio (NPR) convinced the FCC that local low-power radio stations were somehow detrimental to broadcasting, and class D licenses were no longer issued for applications made after 1979, except for broadcast translators to repeat NAB and NPR members&#x27; radio stations. Making matters worse for the college stations, they were demoted to secondary status, meaning that they could be forced to downgrade or go silent if a full-power station chose to upgrade or to relocate closer to the college station.

Many radio stations were forced to upgrade their facilities at considerable expense. Many other radio stations were eventually forced off the air, because they could not afford the upgrades at all, or not in time to avoid being locked in by other expanding radio stations. There have also been instances where college radio stations have been forced off the air either temporarily or permanently by the school&#x27;s administration.

Many college radio stations in the U.S. also carry syndicated programming, such as that of National Public Radio and affiliated regional networks. Some radio stations have had student programming taken off the air by the administration in favor of other uses, such as WWGC and KTXT. The original WGST was the subject of an involuntary takeover which saw the state&#x27;s board of regents sell the radio station as &quot;surplus&quot; property.

A few radio stations have been added to the airwaves as the result of LPFM licensing in the U.S. One example of a Campus Radio station licensed as an LPFM is WIUX-LP of Indiana University, which is able to cover the entire city with its LPFM signal and is competitive in listenership numbers to nearby higher-powered commercial radio stations. Another example of this is WDSW-LP at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi. WDSW-LP fully covers its community with a AAA/roots driven format unserved by other local broadcasters.

A number of campus radio stations in the US are available using alternate means such as streaming audio over the internet. Though continuing to broadcast traditionally over the air at 88.5FM, William Penn University&#x27;s station KWPU in Oskaloosa, IA streams using RadioBOSS. Other such examples are WPTS-FM at the University of Pittsburgh, WJHU at Johns Hopkins University, and KUTU at Utah Tech University. Some stations use both traditional and internet radio platforms, such as Loyola University Chicago&#x27;s WLUW, Lewis University&#x27;s WLRA, University of Michigan&#x27;s WCBN and Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University&#x27;s WIKD-LP. Michigan State University&#x27;s WDBM, University of Minnesota&#x27;s KUOM, University of Wisconsin–Madison&#x27;s WSUM, Elizabethtown College&#x27;s WWEC, and Davidson College&#x27;s WALT 1610 all broadcast via online streaming internet radio.

In 2006, the University of the Republic from Uruguay got the permits to host its own radio in the frequency 89.1 FM, which is controlled by its own team and students.

<doc id="654179" wikidata="Q5089376" url="?curid=654179" title="Cheese-eating surrender monkeys">
<text>&quot;Cheese-eating surrender monkeys&quot;, sometimes shortened to &quot;surrender monkeys&quot;, is a pejorative term for French people. The term was coined in 1995 by Ken Keeler, a writer for the television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and has entered two Oxford quotation dictionaries.

== Origin ==
The term &quot;cheese-eating surrender monkeys&quot; first appeared in &#x27;Round Springfield&quot;, an April 1995 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, an American animated television show. In the episode, budget cuts at Springfield Elementary School force the school&#x27;s Scottish janitor, Groundskeeper Willie, to teach French. Expressing his disdain for French people, he says in a heavy Scottish burr to the class: &quot;Bonjourrrrrrrrr, you cheese-eating surrender monkeys!&quot;

On the episode&#x27;s audio commentary, executive producer Al Jean said the line was &quot;probably&quot; written by &quot;The Simpsons&quot; staff writer Ken Keeler. In a February 2012 interview, Keeler confirmed that he coined the term; he said he considers it his best contribution to the show. Al Jean commented that the staff did not expect the term to become widely used and never intended it as any kind of genuine political statement.

When Round Springfield&quot; was dubbed for a French audience, the line became &quot;Rendez vous, singes mangeurs de fromage&quot; (&quot;Surrender, cheese-eating monkeys&quot;).

== Later use and impact ==
In 2005 Ned Sherrin selected the term for inclusion in the third edition of the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations&quot;. It is also included in the 2007 &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations&quot;.

=== Political ===
The term gained political traction in the US, especially in right-wing circles, when Jonah Goldberg, a columnist for the &quot;National Review&quot; magazine, used it in the title of an April 1999 column on the &quot;Top Ten Reasons to Hate the French&quot;. In the run up to and during the Iraq War, Goldberg reprised it to criticize European nations and France in particular for not joining the Coalition of the Willing, the United States-led invasion and occupation of Iraq.

In 2005, Nigel Farage used the phrase in a debate with Tony Blair over the United Kingdom&#x27;s financial contributions to the European Union, in which Farage contrasted Blair with Jacques Chirac, whom Farage praised for standing up for the French people, while accusing Blair of failing to do the same for the British people.

Ben Macintyre of &quot;The Times&quot; wrote in August 2007 that it is &quot;perhaps the most famous&quot; of the coinages from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and it &quot;has gone on to become a journalistic cliché&quot;. The &quot;New York Post&quot; used it (as &quot;Surrender Monkeys&quot;) as the headline for its December 7, 2006, front page, referring to the Iraq Study Group, and its recommendation that American soldiers be withdrawn from Iraq by January 2008.

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; (November 2010) cited it in relation to Anglo-French military cooperation. In August 2013, &quot;The Independent&quot; suggested an evolution away from the term, in a headline about French-American relations over the Syrian Civil War.

On 6 March 2014, opposition Leader Bill Shorten used the term in the Australian Parliament. He called the Government of Australia &quot;the cheese-eating surrender monkeys of Australian jobs&quot;. When asked to withdraw the comment, Shorten claimed he borrowed the line from an American politician, whom he could not name. On 28 July 2014, Australia&#x27;s Immigration Minister Scott Morrison used it to describe the Labor and Greens position on asylum seekers.

=== Other uses ===
Anthony Bourdain described fellow chef Patrick Clark in his book &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; (2000) as follows: &quot;He was kind of famous; he was big and black; most important, he was an American, one of us, not some cheese-eating, surrender specialist Froggie.&quot;

Jeremy Clarkson used it on &quot;Top Gear&quot; in June 2003, describing the handling of the Renault Clio V6. He later used it in a 4 June 2006 episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot;, to describe the manufacturers of the Citroën C6. Later on in the television show, (Series 13, Episode 5) Clarkson describes the other French drivers as &quot;cheese-eating sideways monkeys&quot;, referring to the fact that the other drivers were overtaking him while sliding sideways.

<text>Ruppert Sanderson Jones (born March 12, 1955) is an American former Major League Baseball center fielder. He was the first player selected in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft by the Seattle Mariners.

==Kansas City Royals==
Jones was born in Dallas and moved to California as a pre-teen. He played baseball, basketball and football at Berkeley High School in Berkeley, California, earning all-East Bay honors in each sport. He received scholarship offers to play football at Arizona State University, Oregon State University and the University of California, but opted to focus on baseball as he considered himself a better outfielder than wide receiver.

He was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the third round of the 1973 Major League Baseball draft. After three seasons in their farm system, in which he batted .287 with 38 home runs and 173 runs batted in, Jones went into Spring training 1976 competing for the open outfield job in right field. Though he had a decent Spring, he was beaten out by Tom Poquette, and reassigned to triple A Omaha just as the regular season was set to begin.

After batting .262 with nineteen home runs and 73 RBIs in half a season with the Omaha Royals, Jones earned a call up to the majors for the second half of the 1976 season. He was the hero of his second major league game, going two-for-five and driving in three runs to lead the Royals to an 8–3 victory over the Chicago White Sox. For the season, he batted .216 with one home run and seven RBIs as a fourth outfielder and left-handed bat off the bench.

==Seattle Mariners==
Royals manager Whitey Herzog called Jones one of the top three prospects in his team&#x27;s organization, and realized that they were likely to lose Jones when he was left unprotected in the 1976 expansion draft. However, given the amount of young talent in the organization, Jones did not fit the team&#x27;s future plans, and was thereby left unprotected. Actor Danny Kaye, who was part owner of the Seattle Mariners, called Jones&#x27; name as the first overall pick in the expansion draft.

Jones&#x27; power and range in center field immediately made him a fan favorite in Seattle. He was batting .256 with seventeen home runs and fifty RBIs at the All-Star break to be named the first ever All-Star representative of the club at the 1977 game. He ended the season at .263 with 24 home runs and 76 RBIs to be named the 1977 Topps Rookie All-Star center fielder.

On May 16, 1978, Jones tied a major league record for outfielders with twelve putouts in an extra innings game against the Detroit Tigers. His 1978 season was interrupted by an appendectomy in mid June. He returned in late July, but managed just a .214 batting average the rest of the way. For the season he batted .235 with six home runs and 46 RBIs.

He returned healthy in 1979, and established career highs in runs (109), hits (166), triples (9), RBIs (78) and stolen bases (33) while playing a full 162 game schedule. He became the first Mariner to have at least fifteen home runs and stolen bases before the All-Star break; no Mariner would do so again for nineteen years. Following the season, he was traded to the New York Yankees with pitcher Jim Lewis for Rick Anderson, Jim Beattie, Juan Beníquez and Jerry Narron. He left the Mariners with the club record for most runs scored in a season (109 in 1979) and he is tied for club records for runs and walks in a game.

==New York Yankees==
Jones was batting .223 with nine home runs and 42 RBIs playing center and batting second in the Yankees&#x27; line-up when he separated his shoulder on August 25, 1980 crashing into the outfield wall in Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum chasing a Tony Armas fly ball. The Yankees won 103 games that season to win the American League East, however, Jones was unable to appear in the post-season as his injury required season ending surgery. He sued A&#x27;s owner Charlie Finley after the season.

At one point during the Winter Meetings, Jones was rumored to be heading to the Boston Red Sox in a rare Yankees–Red Sox deal. However, following the Yankees&#x27; signing of Dave Winfield as a free agent, the deal fell through. Instead, he was dealt to the San Diego Padres the following Spring with Joe Lefebvre, Tim Lollar and Chris Welsh for Jerry Mumphrey and John Pacella.

==San Diego Padres==
The Padres finished in last place in both halves of the strike shortened 1981 season. For his part, Jones batted .249 and tied for the team lead with 53 runs scored. He was batting .312 with eleven home runs and fifty RBIs at the 1982 All-Star break to earn the second All-Star nod of his career. He was the Padres&#x27; sole representative despite the fact that San Diego was in second place in the National League West at the time. In his only at-bat, he led off the third inning with a triple, and scored on a Pete Rose sacrifice fly. Jones was a fan favorite on the 1982 Padres, and Padre Yellow &quot;Rupe&#x27;s Troops&quot; T-shirts were a frequent sight during the season.

Jones appeared in 133 games for the Padres in 1983, the fewest he&#x27;d played in a full season uninterrupted by injury. He was a free agent at the end of the season, and when the Padres acquired Carmelo Martínez from the Chicago Cubs at the Winter meetings, Jones became expendable.

==Detroit Tigers==
Jones spent Spring training 1984 with the Pittsburgh Pirates, but failed to make the club. A week into the season, he signed with the Detroit Tigers. He began the season assigned to triple A with the Evansville Triplets; a .313 batting average, nine home runs and 45 RBIs earned him a call up to the majors by the beginning of June. He spent the rest of the season platooning with Larry Herndon in left field and occasionally spelling a day off for Chet Lemon in center. Perhaps his most indelible moment of his season in Detroit came on June 24, when he cleared the right field roof of Tiger Stadium with a shot off Milwaukee Brewers right-hander Tom Tellmann. For the season, Jones batted .284 with 37 RBIs and nine home runs. Six of which came at Tiger Stadium to earn him the nickname &quot;Rooftop&quot; Ruppert.

The 1984 Tigers won 104 games and coasted into the post-season. Jones went hitless in eight at-bats in the American League Championship Series and World Series (in which he faced off against the Padres), winning the Series with the Tigers. He became a free agent at the end of the season. The Tigers believed that he was a part-time player at this stage of his career, and were only willing to pay him as such. After some bitter negotiation between Jones and the Tigers organization, he signed with the California Angels.

==California Angels==
Jones served as a fourth outfielder and designated hitter his first season in California. His 21 home runs were second only to Reggie Jackson. He and Jackson switched roles in 1986, with Jackson assuming DH duties and Jones earning most of his playing time in right field. The Angels won the American League West that year, earning Jones his second trip to the post-season, but lost the 1986 American League Championship Series to the Boston Red Sox in heart-breaking fashion. Jones collected three hits in the ALCS, scoring four runs and driving in two.

His role became far more diminished in 1987 as he didn&#x27;t even log his first plate appearance until the eighth game of the season. He ended up with eight home runs and 28 RBIs in just 213 plate appearances.

==1988 season==
Jones was invited to the Milwaukee Brewers&#x27; Spring training camp in Tucson, Arizona as a non-roster invitee in 1988. Though he hit well, he failed to make the club. He signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers in the beginning of May, and earned American Association &quot;Player of the Week&quot; honors his second week with the Oklahoma City 89ers. His stay in Oklahoma City, however, was brief. After fifty games, he left for Japan, signing with the Hanshin Tigers. He returned to Oklahoma City in 1989, but with a torn rotator cuff and a torn labrum, he called it quits after 27 games.

==Personal life==
Jones is divorced from the mother of his daughter and son (Gabrielle and Ranon Jones), and has been married to his second wife, Betty, since 1997. He lives in Rancho Bernardo, California, a suburb of San Diego, California, and works with The Boon Group, a third-party administrator that sells employee benefits and administrative services to government contractors. He and former major league pitcher Dave Stewart coach the Easton As, a San Diego–based Travel Ball Team for ages thirteen and fourteen.

<doc id="654191" wikidata="Q1393073" url="?curid=654191" title="Five hindrances">
<text>In the Buddhist tradition, the five hindrances (; Pali: &quot;&quot;) are identified as mental factors that hinder progress in meditation and in daily life. In the Theravada tradition, these factors are identified specifically as obstacles to the jhānas (stages of concentration) within meditation practice. Contemporary Insight Meditation teachers identify the five hindrances as obstacles to mindfulness meditation.

Within the Mahayana tradition, the five hindrances are obstacles to samadhi. They are part of the two types of obstructions (Sanskrit: āvaraṇa), i.e. the obstacles to Buddhahood. The two types of obstructions are afflictive obstructions (Sanskrit: kleśāvaraṇa, which include the standard five hindrances) and cognitive obstructions (jñeyāvaraṇa, which can only be removed by bodhisattvas). 

The classic list of five hindrances is:

# Sensory desire (&quot;kāmacchanda&quot;): seeking for pleasure through the five senses of sight, sound, smell, taste and physical feeling.
# Ill-will (&quot;vyāpāda&quot;; also spelled &quot;byāpāda&quot;): feelings of hostility, resentment, hatred and bitterness.
# Sloth-and-torpor (&quot;thīna-middha&quot;): half-hearted action with little or no effort or concentration.
# Restlessness-and-worry (&quot;uddhacca-kukkucca&quot;): the inability to calm the mind and focus one&#x27;s energy.
# Doubt (&quot;vicikiccha&quot;): lack of conviction or trust in one&#x27;s abilities.

==Etymology==
According to Gil Fronsdal, the Pali term &quot;nīvaraṇa&quot; means covering. Fronsdal states that these hindrances cover over: the clarity of our mind, and our ability to be mindful, wise, concentrated, and stay on purpose.

According to Rhys Davids, the Pali term &quot;nīvaraṇa&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;nivāraṇa&quot;) refers to an obstacle or hindrance only in the ethical sense, and is usually enumerated in a set of five.

==In Pali Literature==

===In the Pali Canon===
In the Pali Canon&#x27;s Samyutta Nikaya, several discourses juxtapose the five hindrances with the seven factors of enlightenment (&quot;bojjhanga&quot;). For instance, according to SN 46.37, the Buddha stated:

Anālayo underlines:

Anālayo further supports this by identifying that, in all extant Sanskrit and Chinese versions of the Satipatthana Sutta, only the five hindrances and seven factors of enlightenment are consistently identified under the &quot;dhamma&quot; contemplation section; contemplations of the five aggregates, six sense bases and Four Noble Truths are not included in one or more of these non-Pali versions.

In terms of gaining insight into and overcoming the Five Hindrances, according to the Satipatthana Sutta, the Buddha proclaimed:

Each of the remaining four hindrances are similarly treated in subsequent paragraphs.

The Buddha gives the following analogies in the &quot;Samaññaphala Sutta&quot; (DN 2, &quot;The Fruits of the Contemplative Life&quot;):

Similarly, in the &quot;Sagārava Sutta&quot; (SN 46.55), the Buddha compares sensual desire with looking for a clear reflection in water mixed with lac, turmeric and dyes; ill will with boiling water; sloth-and-torpor with water covered with plants and algae; restlessness-and-worry with wind-churned water; and, doubt with water that is &quot;turbid, unsettled, muddy, placed in the dark.&quot;

===From post-canonical Pali literature===
According to the first-century CE exegetic &quot;Vimuttimagga&quot;, the five hindrances include all ten fetters: sense desire includes any attachment to passion; ill will includes all unwholesome states of hatred; and, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry, and doubt include all unwholesome states of infatuation. The Vimuttimagga further distinguishes that &quot;sloth&quot; refers to mental states while &quot;torpor&quot; refers to physical states resultant from food or time or mental states; if torpor results from food or time, then one diminishes it through energy; otherwise, one removes it with meditation. In addition, the Vimuttimagga identifies four types of doubt: 
* doubt regarding self is a hindrance to tranquility;
* doubt regarding the Four Noble Truths and three worlds is a hindrance to insight;
* doubt regarding the Triple Gem is a hindrance to both tranquility and insight;
* doubt regarding places and people is a hindrance to &quot;non-doctrinal&quot; things;
* doubt regarding the Discourses is a hindrance to solitude.

According to Buddhaghosa&#x27;s fifth-century CE commentary to the Samyutta Nikaya (&quot;&quot;), one can momentarily escape the hindrances through jhanic suppression or through insight while, as also stated in the &quot;Vimuttimagga&quot;, one eradicates the hindrances through attainment of one of the four stages of enlightenment (see Table 1).

The five mental factors that counteract the five hindrances, according to the Theravada tradition:
# &quot;vitakka&quot; (&quot;applied thought&quot;, &quot;coarse examination&quot;) counteracts sloth-torpor (lethargy and drowsiness)
# &quot;vicāra&quot; (&quot;sustained thought&quot;, &quot;precise investigation&quot;) counteracts doubt (uncertainty)
# &quot;pīti&quot; (rapture, well-being) counteracts ill-will (malice)
# &quot;sukha&quot; (non-sensual pleasure) counteracts restlessness-worry (excitation and anxiety)
# &quot;ekaggatā&quot; (one-pointedness, single-pointed attention) counteracts sensory desire

== Mahāyāna ==
Mahāyāna Buddhist thought focuses on the concept of the &quot;āvaraṇas&quot; (Sanskrit, “obstruction” or “hindrance”; Tibetan: &quot;sgrib pa&quot;; Chinese: &quot;zhang&quot;) refers to impediments on the path to Buddhahood. Mahāyāna Buddhism recognizes two primary types of &quot;āvaraṇa&quot;: 

* Afflictive Obstructions (Kleśāvaraṇa): These arise from defilements such as anger, envy, and ignorance, which result in unwholesome actions. They can be overcome by Śrāvakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and beginner Bodhisattvas through antidotes (&quot;pratipakṣa&quot;) and lead to freedom from rebirth.
* Cognitive Obstructions (Jñeyāvaraṇa): These stem from misconceptions about reality, such as reifying imaginary phenomena, and result in pride, wrong views, and discrimination. Only advanced bodhisattvas can overcome these obstacles, attaining complete understanding of emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;) and compassion (&quot;karuṇā&quot;) while accumulating merit (&quot;puṇya&quot;).

Afflictive obstructions hinder liberation, while cognitive obstructions block omniscience. Buddhas alone transcend both, achieving complete insight into all objects of knowledge. In Yogācāra sources, cognitive obstructions are linked to mistaken perceptions and conceptualizations. These are addressed through advanced practices on the Bodhisattva path, including mastery of the six perfections (&quot;pāramitās&quot;).

According to Xuanzang&#x27;s &quot;Cheng Weishi Lun&quot; (&quot;Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi&quot;), there are ten specific &quot;āvaraṇas&quot; which correspond to the stages of the Bodhisattva path (&quot;daśabhūmi&quot;). These are: 

# Obstruction of common delusions (&quot;prithagjanatvāvaraṇa&quot;): Overcome through generosity.
# Obstruction of deluded conduct (&quot;mithyāpratipattyāvaraṇa&quot;): Addressed by morality.
# Obstruction of dullness (&quot;dhandhatvāvaraṇa&quot;): Resolved with patience.
# Obstruction of subtle afflictions (&quot;sūkṣmakleśasamudācārāvaraṇa&quot;): Countered by effort.
# Obstruction of the lesser nirvāṇa ideal (&quot;hīnayānaparinirvāṇāvaraṇa&quot;): Overcome through meditative absorption.
# Obstruction of coarse characteristics (&quot;sthūlanimittasamudācārāvaraṇa&quot;): Addressed by wisdom.
# Obstruction of subtle characteristics (&quot;sūkṣmanimittasamudācārāvaraṇa&quot;): Overcome by expedient means.
# Obstruction of continued activity in the immaterial realm (&quot;nirnimittābhisaṃskārāvaraṇa&quot;): Resolved through vows.
# Obstruction of reluctance to save others (&quot;parahitacaryākāmanāvaraṇa&quot;): Countered by spiritual power.
# Obstruction of incomplete mastery over all phenomena (&quot;dharmasvāśitāpratilambhāvaraṇa&quot;): Addressed by omniscience.

<doc id="654193" wikidata="Q4129560" url="?curid=654193" title="Molbo story">
<text>A Molbo story is a Danish folktale of the &quot;town of fools&quot; type about the people of Mols, who live in eastern Jutland near the town of Ebeltoft. In these tales the Molboes are portrayed as a simple folk, who act foolishly while attempting to be wise. 

==History==
&quot;Molbohistorier&quot; (Molbo stories) were handed down by generations of Danes before finally appearing in print. Christian Elovius Mangor, who by permission of the Danish monarch Christian VII had started a printing press in Viborg, published the first collection, &quot;Tales of the well-known Molboes&#x27; wise and brave actions&quot;, in 1771. A second edition followed in 1780. Over the years Molbo stories have been published in books for adults and children in several languages, including Danish, Norwegian and English. Similar narratives are found in other cultures. England, for instance, has &quot;Lazy Jack&quot; and &quot;The Wise Men of Gotham.&quot; In Finland there are stories about the people of Hölmölä (Hölmöläiset).

In 1898 the operetta &quot;Molboerne&quot; (The People of Mols) by composer and lyricist Herman Petersen premiered in Copenhagen. The work not only had a memorable score but also references to Molbo stories, such as &quot;The Stork in the Grain Field&quot; and &quot;The Mixed Legs&quot;.

Norway, which for nearly three centuries was part of the kingdom of Denmark-Norway, received many cultural influences from Denmark. Consequently, Molbo stories are known in both Denmark and Norway, and the word “Molbo” is used in both countries as a term of disparagement. The expression &quot;Molbo politics&quot; is prohibited when speaking from the rostrum in Norway&#x27;s parliament.

==The Stork in the Grain Field==

From &quot;Tales of the well-known Molboes&#x27; wise and brave actions&quot;, 1771

One summer, when the grain was high in the field, the Molbo people had been visited by a stork. It had acquired the nasty habit of strutting back and forth on their fields to catch frogs. And it was bad news, because the Molbo people were very afraid that it would trample all the grain down on the field. They talked together for a long time back and forth about... how to chase it away. In the end, they agreed that the shepherd should go into the field and drive the stork out.

But just as he stood and was about to enter the grain, they discovered that he had such big and wide feet, and then they were afraid that he would step on more grain than the stork. There they stood - . Finally one of them got a good idea! He suggested that the shepherd should be carried into the field, then he could not tread down the grain. They all thought that was good advice. So they lifted the field gate and set the shepherd on it; ... and then eight men carried him into the corn, so that he could chase the stork out. That way, the shepherd did not trample down traces in the grain field with his big feet.
The Wise Men of Chelm used a similar trick to prevent the city &quot;shammes&quot; to trample the beautiful fresh show in the early morning.

The &quot;Motif-Index of Folk-Literature&quot; includes the motif J2100: Remedies worse than the disease

==The Headless Man==

:The Molboes have a long way to the forest so they must rise early to collect wood. One morning some of them drove to the forest to bring home a tree they had bought. But on the way the one who drove first happened to lose his axe, and when the others saw that, they thought he threw it away on purpose, so they threw away their axes as well. Now, as they stood in the forest, they had nothing with which to chop, they didn&#x27;t know what to do at all, and they certainly didn&#x27;t want to come home empty-handed. Finally one of them had the brilliant idea to pull the tree down; but as they hadn&#x27;t brought a rope, one of them had to climb the tree and lay his head in the cleavage between two branches then the others were to pull his legs until the tree yielded. Very well, they pulled and they pulled, and eventually they all fell backwards, including the chap they had been pulling, only he had no head. This they couldn&#x27;t fathom, they went searching and searching, but no, they didn&#x27;t find the head, because it was stuck in the tree. Well, that couldn&#x27;t be helped, now it was time to return home. And so they laid the headless man in the wagon and took him home to his wife and asked if she was sure that her husband had brought his head when he left home this morning. &quot;I can&#x27;t remember that right now!&quot;, said the wife; but then she thought for a while: &quot;Oh yes, he did bring his head!&quot; she said. &quot;He ate cabbage with it this morning before he left.&quot;

A similar story is known for the dwellers of Fünsing.

<text>Jermaine Lee O&#x27;Neal Sr. (born October 13, 1978) is an American former professional basketball player. A center/power forward, he had a successful high school career and declared his eligibility for the 1996 NBA draft straight out of high school. O&#x27;Neal, at just 17 years of age, was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the 17th overall pick, and played his first professional game at 18. At the time, he was the youngest player to ever play an NBA game.

O&#x27;Neal was unable to break into the first team in Portland and was traded to the Indiana Pacers in 2000. In his eight seasons with the team, he was voted an NBA All-Star six times, made the All-NBA teams three times, and was voted the NBA Most Improved Player in the 2001–02 season. O&#x27;Neal also helped Indiana reach the NBA playoffs six times, including the Eastern Conference Finals in the 2003–04 season. O&#x27;Neal was traded to the Toronto Raptors before the 2008–09 season began, and later played for the Miami Heat, the Boston Celtics and the Phoenix Suns. O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s final NBA season was the 2013–14 season, which he spent with the Golden State Warriors.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Neal was born in Columbia, South Carolina. He and his older brother, Clifford, were raised by their mother, Angela Ocean. Ocean worked hard to support her sons and left her children largely to their own devices. O&#x27;Neal found his love for athletics at a young age. Tall and quick, he enjoyed both American football and basketball, but basketball was his favorite sport. Two of his basketball heroes are Hakeem Olajuwon and Bill Russell; O&#x27;Neal often marveled at Olajuwon&#x27;s approach to the game, while he loved watching Russell&#x27;s video highlights of his duels with Wilt Chamberlain.

== High school career ==
Each summer, O&#x27;Neal would play for an AAU team and impressed onlookers with his athleticism and his ability to handle the ball with both hands. By the time he turned 14, the O&#x27;Neal—now a confident guard who could drain three-pointers—entered Eau Claire High School of the Arts as a freshman in 1992. In his first meeting with basketball coach George Glymph, he made the bold promise to become the best player in the school&#x27;s history. While O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s first season was hardly noteworthy (he even played as quarterback for the Eau Claire team) things changed when he grew five inches over the next year and a half, and he was inspired to develop into a defensive powerhouse like his idol, Bill Russell. Glymph built his team&#x27;s defense around O&#x27;Neal, and Eau Claire featured one of the most imposing frontcourts around. With O&#x27;Neal averaging 18 points, 12 rebounds and 9 blocks a game, Eau Claire captured its third straight 3A state title in 1995.

The following July, the 16-year-old was able to raise his profile yet again. At an ABCD summer basketball camp, he outplayed Tim Thomas, a rising star at that time. Before long, recruiting letters from various top colleges came pouring in. O&#x27;Neal, however, also faced great pressure off the court. That same year, the District Attorney contemplated prosecuting him for rape after he and his 15-year-old girlfriend were found partially nude in bed together by her father. The DA eventually did not prosecute O&#x27;Neal, but as the latter struggled to cope with the pressure on and off the court, Glymph stepped in, introducing discipline to his life and keeping his feet to the ground. At the same time, O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s mother had met a new man, Abraham Kennedy, who also guided O&#x27;Neal along.

In his senior season at Eau Claire, O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s averages of 22.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 5.2 blocks per game ensured that he was voted First Team All-State, South Carolina&#x27;s Player of the Year and &quot;Mr. Basketball&quot;. Named to USA Today&#x27;s All-USA Basketball Team, he earned a spot in the McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game as well. Despite being one of the nation&#x27;s top prospects, O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s future in college basketball was uncertain. He scored poorly on the SATs, and Glymph advised against him making the leap to the NBA. But it was only a year before that another South Carolinian—future NBA All-Star Kevin Garnett—had made a seamless transition from high school to the NBA, and O&#x27;Neal thought he could emulate Garnett.

==Professional career==

===Portland Trail Blazers (1996–2000)===
O&#x27;Neal was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers as the 17th pick in the 1996 NBA draft. The rookie was surrounded by veterans and emerging stars who could show him the ropes in Portland; forming the frontcourt with him were Arvydas Sabonis, Rasheed Wallace and Cliff Robinson. After missing the first 17 games with a bone contusion in his knee, O&#x27;Neal made his debut against the Denver Nuggets in December. At 18 years, one month and 22 days, he became the youngest player to play in an NBA game (a mark that was later eclipsed by Andrew Bynum). O&#x27;Neal also became the youngest player at 18 years, three months and eleven days to score 20 points in a game on January 22, 1997, against the Seattle SuperSonics.

==== 1996–97 season ====
Portland was mediocre in the first half of the campaign, but came to form as the playoffs approached and managed to finish third in the Pacific Division with a 49–33 win–loss record. While fans at the Rose Garden harbored thoughts of an upset against the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round of the playoffs, the Trail Blazers succumbed in four games. In O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s first season, he appeared in a total of 45 games in the regular season, averaging 4.1 points and 2.8 rebounds per game. For the most part, however, he came off the bench and only averaged 10.2 minutes a game. O&#x27;Neal doubted for a while if he had made the right decision to skip college—he watched with envy as good friend and fellow prep-to-pro draftee Kobe Bryant was enjoying a good rookie season—but he remained confident that the best had yet to come.

==== 1997–98 season ====
Despite his optimism, O&#x27;Neal found it difficult to break into the first team the following season. Brian Grant was acquired from free agency and new coach Mike Dunleavy Sr. planned to use Sabonis, Wallace and Grant as the starting frontcourt, while the presence of veteran Gary Trent also further reduced the sophomore&#x27;s chances. Thus, O&#x27;Neal was not given meaningful minutes in the early part of the campaign, although he showed glimpses of his potential with occasional double double performances when he returned from an early-season injury. Portland eventually produced a similar win–loss record as the preceding season with 46 wins, finishing fourth in the division. In the playoffs, Dunleavy opted to go with a more youthful lineup: before the trade deadline, he had acquired point guard Damon Stoudamire, as well as forwards Carlos Rogers and Walt Williams. The move was designed to bolster the team&#x27;s chances in the playoffs against teams that were bigger and more physical. Nevertheless, for the second time in two years, the Trail Blazers were eliminated by the Lakers in four games in the first round. And just like the season before, O&#x27;Neal hardly featured for Portland, playing only three minutes in one game.

==== 1998–99 season ====
The 1998–99 season was initially disrupted for several months following an impasse in the collective bargaining negotiations. In the end, the league scaled down to a 50-game schedule, and Portland capitalized on the shortened campaign. Boasting one of the league&#x27;s most balanced squads that also had strength in depth, the Trail Blazers chalked up an impressive 35–15 record and topped the division. Dunleavy—who would later be named NBA Coach of the Year—led his club into the playoffs aiming to capture the franchise&#x27;s first NBA title since 1977. After sweeping the Phoenix Suns 3–0 in the first round, Portland defeated the Utah Jazz 4–2 to set up a showdown with the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals. In game 2, a 3-pointer by Sean Elliott in the closing seconds gave the Spurs an 86–85 win and propelled San Antonio to win the series (the Spurs went on to win the NBA championship). O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s disappointment at losing in the Conference Finals was compounded by the fact that his regular-season minutes had dropped to fewer than 10 a game for the first time, and that his contributions to the team were mostly insignificant, to begin with. He was having increasing doubts about his NBA career.

==== 1999–00 season ====
However, in an unexpected move, Portland showed their willingness to invest in O&#x27;Neal by offering him a four-year contract worth $24 million. However, the new deal did not translate into more playing time for the power forward in the 1999–2000 season. Portland acquired Detlef Schrempf, Scottie Pippen, and Steve Smith during the 1999 offseason, which meant that O&#x27;Neal was once again consigned to the bench. His statistics remained unimpressive, averaging 3.9 points and 3.3 rebounds per game during the regular season. In the meantime, the Trail Blazers continued to build on the success of their previous campaign. They notched 59 wins in the regular season, and defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Utah Jazz en route to reaching the Western Conference Finals. Up against recent perennial rivals the Los Angeles Lakers, the team relinquished a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter of the pivotal game 7, and lost 89–84. O&#x27;Neal was not heavily involved in any of this action, however. With back-to-back Conference Finals disappointments coupled with a lack of playing time, he soon announced his intention to be traded. The Trail Blazers relented in the end and sent him to the Indiana Pacers alongside Joe Kleine in exchange for NBA All-Star Dale Davis.

===Indiana Pacers (2000–2008)===

==== 2000–01 season: First season with the Pacers ====
The trade was greeted with surprise by the Indiana fans as the Pacers had just come off an appearance in the 2000 NBA Finals, and the trade involved losing a quality player for an unproven commodity in O&#x27;Neal. The Pacers roster also saw the departures of Mark Jackson, Rik Smits and Chris Mullin, and even coach Larry Bird stepped down. All of this meant that O&#x27;Neal arrived in Indianapolis facing intense pressure and scrutiny.
When O&#x27;Neal arrived at his new club, new coach Isiah Thomas—who had pushed for the O&#x27;Neal/Davis trade—told him that he simply needed to work harder on his game to succeed. At that time, Indiana was rebuilding and still revolved around veteran All-Star Reggie Miller. O&#x27;Neal turned out to be a revelation for his new club and it was not long before he established himself as a key player for his new team. Starting in 80 of the 81 regular-season games he played in for the 2000–01 season, his statistics improved significantly as he averaged 12.9 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. The big man helped his team to a 41–41 record and the eighth playoff seed; he also led the league in total blocks (228, a franchise record), and led the Eastern Conference in double-doubles. O&#x27;Neal kept up his form into the playoffs as well, averaging almost 9.8 points and 12.5 boards a game in the first round against the Philadelphia 76ers, although the series was short-lived as the latter emerged victorious in four games.

==== 2001–02 season: First All-Star and Most Improved Player ====

The 2001–02 season proved to be the breakthrough season for O&#x27;Neal as he earned a trio of honors: winning the NBA Most Improved Player Award, being named an NBA All-Star, and making the All-NBA Third Team (becoming the second Pacer in history to do so after Reggie Miller). Leading his team in scoring (19.0) and rebounding (10.5), he chalked up 39 double-doubles, which was third best in the conference and eighth best in the league. Indiana recorded 42 wins and qualified for the playoffs once again as the eighth seed, where they faced one of the hottest teams in the league at that time, the New Jersey Nets. The Pacers lost the series in 5 games, despite forcing overtime twice. The Nets decided to put Kenyon Martin on O&#x27;Neal after the latter put up a 30-point, 11-rebound performance in game 1, and they succeeded by limiting him to just 17.2 points and 7.6 rebounds per game for the rest of the series. As the Pacers reflected on yet another premature end to the postseason, they knew that O&#x27;Neal was next in line to succeed the 36-year-old Miller as the new face of the franchise. At the same time, the Pacers seemed to have found players in Brad Miller, Ron Artest, Al Harrington and Jamaal Tinsley who complemented O&#x27;Neal. Indiana was on the brink of becoming a legitimate threat in the East.

==== 2002–03 season: Franchise player====
The Pacers started the 2002–03 season well, winning 14 of their first 16 games, and had the best record in the East by the time the All-Star break arrived. The same team from the year before was playing better than ever, but the season fell apart in the latter half. For one, Brad Miller got injured and Indiana lost one of their most versatile players. Defensive lynchpin Artest suffered from too many emotional outbursts and this further hurt the Pacers, who could only finish the season 48–34. On his part, O&#x27;Neal kept up his All-Star numbers, averaging 20.8 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, being only one of three players in the NBA that year to pull off a 20/10. He was voted Eastern Conference Player of the Month twice, in January and April, and would go on to be named to the All-NBA Third Team again by the season&#x27;s end. With no momentum heading into the playoffs, however, the Pacers were eliminated 4–2 by the underdog Boston Celtics, marking a first-round elimination for the third year in a row. Off the court, the team had also been facing family problems. Brad Miller&#x27;s father-in-law and Tinsley&#x27;s mother died during the season, and just before the playoffs, O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s stepfather attempted suicide. When the season ended, O&#x27;Neal tried to keep his focus on basketball and considered the possibility of joining another team since he was now a free agent. The San Antonio Spurs, led by two-time NBA champion Tim Duncan, looked an interesting proposition as perennial All-Star David Robinson had just retired. Much as it was tempting for O&#x27;Neal to make the switch, he opted not to uproot his family and signed a seven-year, $126 million contract with the Pacers. Even so, the offseason produced a few surprises for O&#x27;Neal when Isiah Thomas was replaced by Rick Carlisle, and Brad Miller left for the Sacramento Kings. Indiana was undergoing rebuilding yet again.

==== 2003–04 season: Best record in the NBA and franchise record ====
Despite all the changes, O&#x27;Neal spearheaded the Pacers to a league-best 61–21 record in the 2003–04 season. He remained a constant double-double threat, averaging 20.1 points and 10.0 rebounds a game in the regular season. He also continued to rack up individual honors, making his third All-Star trip and being named to the All-NBA Second Team. He finished third in NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting. Artest was instrumental to the team&#x27;s success too as he enjoyed a breakthrough season, netting his first All-Star berth as well as the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. In the playoffs, Indiana gained revenge from the preceding season by sweeping Boston in the first round, before defeating the Miami Heat in the next. That sent them back to the Eastern Conference Finals for the sixth time in 11 years, where they were disposed of by eventual NBA champions Detroit Pistons. In the series-deciding sixth game, O&#x27;Neal endured a sprained knee and managed to tally 20 points and 10 rebounds, but Richard Hamilton&#x27;s inspired play ensured a close victory for the Pistons.

==== 2004–05 season: Suspension and career high in scoring====
The Pacers looked to build on their previous campaign in the 2004–05 season, but all their plans came apart on November 19. In a game against the Pistons at The Palace of Auburn Hills, a brawl named &quot;The Malice at the Palace&quot; broke out that spilled into the stands, after a fan threw a drink on Indiana Pacer Ron Artest. O&#x27;Neal was one of the Pacers who fought with two fans who came onto the court; he ran to defend teammate Ron Artest and punched one of the fans in the head so hard that teammate Scot Pollard and sportscaster Jim Gray feared that O&#x27;Neal would kill the fan. As he and his Pacer teammates left the court, many enraged fans threw snacks, drinks, and even a folding chair at O&#x27;Neal. In response to O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s actions during the brawl, NBA Commissioner David Stern suspended him for 25 games; teammates Artest and Stephen Jackson were suspended for the rest of the season and 30 games, respectively. Following an appeal just before Christmas, O&#x27;Neal won a ten-game reduction in his sentence, but this did not mitigate the damage that Indiana had already suffered. Stripped of three of its core players, the team hobbled to a 44–38 record and the sixth seed. O&#x27;Neal appeared in only 44 games, his lowest total ever with Indiana. Although his scoring average improved to 24.3 points per game, his rebounding dropped and he was no longer the same intimidating presence on defense. Things worsened when he sprained his right shoulder in March and played sparingly for the remainder of the regular season, while hoping to recover in time for the playoffs. The Pacers drew the Celtics in the first round, and managed to salvage their season by winning the series 4–3. O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s offensive output dropped, and he shot poorly from the field. When the Pacers met the Pistons in the semifinals, they were eliminated in six games.

==== Battling injuries and missing playoffs (2005–08) ====
O&#x27;Neal continued his battle against injuries during the 2005–06 season, and played in only 51 games. Nevertheless, he averaged a team-high 20.1 points and 9.3 rebounds a game. and was voted by the fans as the starting forward for the Eastern Conference All-Star team (he was later replaced by Gilbert Arenas due to injury). The Pacers entered the playoffs as the sixth seed. They eventually lost to the New Jersey Nets in six games.

O&#x27;Neal missed 13 more games in the 2006–07 season as the Pacers missed the playoffs altogether. O&#x27;Neal continued to miss huge amounts of time, especially towards the end of the season, as the Pacers struggled to compete. O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s production and stats declined as well. He had two years and $44 million left on his deal. The Pacers were looking to move the huge contract. On June 25, 2008, it was reported that O&#x27;Neal and the 41st pick in the 2008 NBA draft, Nathan Jawai would be sent to Toronto for T. J. Ford, Rasho Nesterovič, Maceo Baston and the 17th pick in the 2008 NBA draft (Roy Hibbert). The trade was finalized on July 9, 2008.

===Toronto Raptors (2008–2009)===
O&#x27;Neal was given jersey #6 for the Raptors since his number with the Pacers (#7) was already owned by Andrea Bargnani. While he was expected to combine with Toronto&#x27;s three-time All-Star Chris Bosh to form a strong frontcourt and provide greater rebounding and interior defense for the Raptors, O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s arrival was dwarfed by the Elton Brand signing pulled off by division rivals Philadelphia. O&#x27;Neal wasted no time in imposing his style on his new team: in the season opener at Philadelphia, he pointed to hecklers in the home crowd after making a dunk; in the team&#x27;s second game, Toronto&#x27;s center blocked a dunk from Golden State&#x27;s Brandan Wright and thereafter waved a finger in disapproval. Even so, it took O&#x27;Neal some time to find his offensive game: he reached the 20-point mark just twice in his first 23 games, before notching three straight thereafter. By the All-Star break, injuries had ruled the big man out for almost a quarter of Toronto&#x27;s games, while Bargnani regained his starting spot with a streak of solid performances. This, coupled with the Raptors entering the break placed 14th in the conference and 13 games under .500, Toronto General Manager Bryan Colangelo looked to move O&#x27;Neal to bring in a wing player and free up salary space.

On February 13, 2009, O&#x27;Neal and Jamario Moon were traded to Miami for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks; the latter two had been traded to Miami a year earlier for Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. In his 41 games as a Raptor, O&#x27;Neal averaged 13.5 points, 7 rebounds and 2 blocks per game.

===Miami Heat (2009–2010)===

The Heat went 7–5 in O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s first 12 games with his new club—including a victory over the Raptors at the Air Canada Centre—as they looked to secure the fourth seed for the playoffs. The Heat eventually concluded the regular season with a 43–39 record and was seeded fifth. In the first round of the playoffs, the Atlanta Hawks defeated the Heat in seven games.

In the 2009–10 season, O&#x27;Neal started in all 70 games he played in and produced numbers identical to his career averages. Miami concluded the regular season as the fifth seed for the playoffs, and were up against the Boston Celtics. Boston won the series 4–1.

===Boston Celtics (2010–2012)===

On July 14, 2010, O&#x27;Neal signed a two-year deal with the Boston Celtics. He had a difficult season with his new team, missing 58 regular-season games with left knee and left wrist injuries, playing only 24 games and started in 10 of them, averaging 5.4 points, 3.7 rebounds and 1.3 blocks in 18.0 minutes per game. O&#x27;Neal came back in the starting line-up for the 2011 NBA playoffs. Boston (third seed) faced the New York Knicks in the first round. O&#x27;Neal had a good series, especially in game 1 with 12 points and 5 blocks. Boston swept the Knicks, but lost to the eventual Eastern Conference champions, the Miami Heat, in the second round in five games.

On April 20, 2012, he was waived by the Celtics following season-ending wrist surgery. In 25 games, he averaged 5.0 points, 5.4 rebounds and 1.7 blocks per game.

=== Phoenix Suns (2012–2013) ===
On August 15, 2012, O&#x27;Neal signed a one-year contract with the Phoenix Suns. O&#x27;Neal cited the Suns&#x27; training staff as a major factor in his decision to sign with the team. He has been considered the leader around the locker room to replace the likes of Steve Nash and Grant Hill. As a result, O&#x27;Neal became a new captain of the team along with Jared Dudley.

On November 21, 2012, O&#x27;Neal scored 17 points off of 7 of 9 shooting off the bench to help defeat the Portland Trail Blazers 114–87. Two days later, O&#x27;Neal would record his first double-double with the Suns by scoring 13 points and grabbing 11 rebounds in a close 111–108 overtime victory over the New Orleans Hornets.

On January 23, 2013, O&#x27;Neal was sidelined by an irregular heartbeat. O&#x27;Neal would return on February 5, 2013, against the Memphis Grizzlies before the All-Star break.

On February 27, 2013, O&#x27;Neal scored 22 points and grabbed 13 rebounds in a 105–101 overtime victory against the San Antonio Spurs. In March 2013, O&#x27;Neal took time off from the team to be with his daughter, Asjia, who underwent surgery to repair a leaky heart valve.

=== Golden State Warriors (2013–2014) ===
On July 23, 2013, O&#x27;Neal signed with the Golden State Warriors. On December 13, 2013, O&#x27;Neal underwent surgery to repair a torn ligament in his right wrist. He returned to action on February 4, 2014.

Feeling exhausted, O&#x27;Neal decided to sit out the 2014–15 NBA season. Despite receiving interest from several teams during the season, O&#x27;Neal remained out of action and instead decided to focus on his family. In February 2016, O&#x27;Neal noted that he had not yet officially retired from the NBA.

==National team career==
Following his breakout season in 2000–01, O&#x27;Neal earned a spot on Team USA for the 2001 Goodwill Games. The Americans won all of their five games and the gold medal, and O&#x27;Neal led the team in blocks and shooting percentage, while finishing second in points and rebounds. The 2002 NBA Most Improved Player was selected to represent his nation again in the 2002 World Basketball Championship which was held in Indianapolis. This time round, the Americans had a lackluster tournament, and could only finish sixth. O&#x27;Neal averaged 7.3 points and 4.5 rebounds over eight games. The next year, Team USA staged a comeback in the 2003 Tournament of the Americas. Winning all ten of its games and the gold medal, the team qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics. O&#x27;Neal featured in every game in that tournament, averaging 11.2 points and 6.2 rebounds per contest. While he was earmarked as a core member of the team that would compete in the Olympics, a knee injury prevented him from participating in the games.

<doc id="654212" wikidata="Q659704" url="?curid=654212" title="Mols">
<text>Mols is a small Danish gathering of hilly peninsulas in the southern part of the larger peninsula of Djursland on the east coast of Jutland. The largest peninsulas of Mols comprise Skødshoved to the west, and Helgenæs to the east. 

Mols&#x27; largest town is Ebeltoft, a town on the coast, noted for its historical town centre. Some residents of Mols or Ebeltoft will argue that Ebeltoft is not a town of Mols. The usually accepted compromise is that Ebeltoft is the market town of Mols, although not geographically situated in present-day Mols.

Hills in Mols rise to 137 metres, high by Danish standards. The highest points are Agri Bavnehøj (137 m), Trehøje (127 m) and Stabelhøjene (135 m &amp; 133 m). In 2008 this hilly area, Mols Bjerge (&quot;bjerge&quot; translates to &quot;mountains&quot;), was declared one of the first Danish national parks. It has unspoiled country, farms, rolling hills that descend to the sea, and very few large resorts.

People of Mols, called Molboer, are the subjects of &quot;Molbohistorier&quot; – ethnic stories told by the townsfolk of Aarhus and Ebeltoft to ridicule rural people. Three of the better-known stories are &quot;The Stork in the Corn&quot;, &quot;The Thirsty Tree&quot;, and &quot;Black Pudding&quot;.

== Tourism ==
Tourism is important on Mols, with many summer rentals, marinas and a total of twenty-two popular sandy beaches in the general area of Djursland, all of which are public as almost all of Denmark&#x27;s coastline. Denmark and Mols are not densely populated, compared to central Europe, making the area uncrowded. The summer climate is mild, and it seldom gets unpleasantly hot. Situated on the eastern side of Jutland, and part of the small shallow Kattegat sea separating Denmark and Sweden, the seawater warms up fast in the summer and the coastlines are not exposed to rough tides and waves as normally experienced on the Jutlandic west coast.

<text>Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (), commonly abbreviated as TEDA () is the main free market zone in Binhai, Tianjin, China. It was formed in late 1984.

==History==
The area was created in late 1984. Since 1997, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM, the former Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade) started a comprehensive appraisal on investment environment of all national-level development zones which covers eight major indicators like overall economic strength, infrastructure, operation cost, human resources and supply, society and environment, facilitation for technology innovation, management system building, and development and efficiency. For 12 consecutive years, TEDA topped the list. It is a leading investment spot and the Asia-Pacific at large.

TEDA, pronounced nearly the same in Mandarin Chinese, is a vast area by the seaside. It contains a port, business buildings, urban residential areas, and an extensive transportation network. TEDA also contains the TEDA Football Stadium, used by Tianjin&#x27;s football team, Tianjin Teda FC. The stadium was finished in 2004.

The area&#x27;s largest bridge is the Haihe toll bridge.

==Location==

Located in the Binhai New Area of Tianjin Municipality, TEDA is around 40 minutes from downtown Tianjin, 30 minutes from the Tianjin Binhai International Airport and 5 minutes away from the Tianjin Port. The Binhai Mass Transit rapid transit system was introduced in 2004 to reduce travel time between Tianjin downtown and TEDA.

There is an increasing expatriate population in TEDA, supported by the International School of Tianjin which is accredited by both WASC and CIS. The school Teda International School was established in 1995. Teda International School offers a curriculum based on United States standards. The school is authorized by the College Board to offer the Advanced Placement (AP) program, and examinations, and is an authorized SAT and TOEFL testing center.

TEDA is also home to the Tianjin TEDA Maple Leaf International School (TTMLIS), formerly called Harbor View School. TTMLIS is a member of Maple Leaf Education Systems, whose flagship school is located in the Dalian Development Area of the city of Dalian, Liaoning.

==Economy==
According to Benchmarkia, the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area has the highest total investment among all industrial parks worldwide. Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holding Corporation has its corporate headquarters in the TEDA.

<text>The Advocate is an American LGBTQ magazine, printed bi-monthly and available by subscription. &quot;The Advocate&quot; brand also includes a website. Both magazine and website have an editorial focus on news, politics, opinion, and arts and entertainment of interest to lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender, and queer people (LGBTQ) people. The magazine, established in 1967, is the oldest and largest LGBTQ publication in the United States and the only surviving one of its kind that was founded before the 1969 Stonewall riots in Manhattan, an uprising that was a major milestone in the LGBTQ rights movement. On June 9, 2022, Pride Media was acquired by Equal Entertainment LLC.

==History==

&quot;The Advocate&quot; was first published as a local newsletter by the activist group Personal Rights in Defense and Education (PRIDE) in Los Angeles. The newsletter was inspired by a police raid on a Los Angeles gay bar, the Black Cat Tavern, on January 1, 1967, and the demonstrations against police brutality in the months following that raid. Richard Mitch (using the pseudonym &quot;Dick Michaels&quot;) and Bill Rau (under the name &quot;Bill Rand&quot;) joined PRIDE and, along with Aristide Laurent and artist Sam Winston, transformed the newsletter into a newspaper titled &quot;The Los Angeles Advocate&quot;. The first issue bore a cover date of September 1967, and was sold for 25 cents in gay bars in Los Angeles. By early 1968, PRIDE was struggling to stay viable and Mitch and Rau paid the group one dollar for ownership of the paper in February of that year. In 1969 the newspaper was renamed &quot;The Advocate&quot; and distributed nationally. By 1974, Mitch and Rau were printing 40,000 copies for each issue.

The newspaper attracted the attention of David B. Goodstein, an investment banker from San Francisco who bought the publication in 1974. Under Goodstein&#x27;s direction, &quot;The Advocate&quot; transformed into a bi-weekly national news magazine covering events important to the LGBT community, including the gay rights movement, along with arts and culture. Goodstein also worked toward reducing sex-oriented advertisements in favor of more mainstream sponsors.

Goodstein and Rob Eichberg created &quot;The Advocate Experience&quot;. Loosely based on the then-popular EST (Erhardt Seminars Training), it was a two-weekend, all-day series of extensive self-realization workshops to bring self-acceptance, awareness and tolerance within the LGBT community. Goodstein and Eichberg facilitated the workshops for much of their duration. Goodstein&#x27;s later editorials strongly opposed state intervention during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. He argued even though &quot;our lifestyle can become an elaborate suicidal ritual... our safety and survival depends on each of us and our individual behaviour&quot;, as opposed to government public health regulations.

Soon after Goodstein&#x27;s death in 1985, the magazine was transformed from a tabloid-size newspaper format in two sections (with the second section carrying sexually explicit advertisements) to a standard magazine format, beginning with the October 1, 1985 issue. Breakthroughs in straight celebrity covers came under the flamboyant command of editor in chief, Richard Rouilard in the 1980s and early 1990s. After his death from AIDS, this editorial trend continued successfully with editor in chief Jeff Yarbrough. It was during this time that the magazine stopped carrying sexually explicit advertisements, and in 1992 it launched a sister publication, &quot;Advocate Classifieds&quot;. Under the leadership of its first female editor in chief, Judy Wieder, (1996–2002; editorial director, 2002–2006), &quot;The Advocate&quot; brought in a variety of voices, won numerous mainstream publishing awards, and set records for newsstand sales, circulation, and advertising. Wieder and her staff&#x27;s coming-out interviews with such diverse gay luminaries as Ellen DeGeneres, George Michael, Liz Smith, Gore Vidal, Chaz Bono, Jim McGreevey, Melissa Etheridge and Rob Halford garnered the magazine much television exposure and helped to lift the status of &quot;The Advocate&quot; interviews as well as the visibility of the publication.

&quot;The Advocate&quot; changed hands through a series of mergers and acquisitions, first unsuccessfully with PlanetOut in 2006, and later with Here Media. In a cost-cutting move in 2008, Here Media, conceding that &quot;The Advocate&quot; print edition could no longer compete with local weekly LGBT newspapers and the Internet for hard news, switched the magazine from a bi-weekly to a monthly publication cycle. Starting in 2010, Here Media consolidated the distribution for &quot;The Advocate&quot; and &quot;Out&quot; magazines. &quot;The Advocate&quot; print version continues to be published and is available enclosed with &quot;Out&quot; as a combination package via subscription. In 2010 there were press reports of freelance writers not being paid for their work. &quot;The Advocate&quot; is no longer produced in-house at Here Media but by Grand Editorial for Here Media. Grand Editorial is a contractor based in Brooklyn, New York City that also produces &quot;Out&quot;. Publication frequency has been reduced to bi-monthly with six issues per year.

In 2017, Here Media sold its magazine operations to a group led by Oreva Capital, who renamed the parent company Pride Media.

Zach Stafford served as the editor in chief in 2019, the first Black person to hold that role in the magazine&#x27;s 50+ year history. In February 2020, Tracy E. Gilchrist was named editor in chief of &quot;The Advocate&quot; brand. Neal Broverman was named editor in chief of Advocate.com. Diane Anderson-Minshall will continue in the role of Global Chief Content Creator and President.

On June 9, 2022, after OUT acquisition, Mark Berryhill was named CEO of equalpride. Joe Lovejoy is CFO and Mike Kelley is President of Global Growth and Development. Neal Broverman was named editorial director of equalpride and Desiree Guerrero serves as editor in chief of The Advocate, while Alex Cooper serves as editor in chief of advocate.com.

==Comics==
&quot;The Advocate&quot; provided a venue for several noteworthy LGBT cartoonists in the 1970s and 1980s. Early in its history, the publication ran single-panel gag cartoons by Joe Johnson featuring effeminate Miss Thing and beefy Big Dick, and &quot;Gayer Than Strange&quot; by Sean. After these were discontinued, &quot;It&#x27;s a Gay Life&quot; by Donelan debuted in 1977 and ran for 15 years. Howard Cruse&#x27;s strip &quot;Wendel&quot; appeared from 1983 to 1989, transitioning from a single tabloid-size page to two magazine-size pages when the publication changed format. &quot;Leonard and Larry&quot; by Tim Barela and &quot;Servants to the Cause&quot; by Alison Bechdel also appeared briefly during the late 1980s.

==Podcast==
&quot;The Advocate&quot; produces a podcast called &quot;LGBTQ&amp;A&quot;, created and hosted by Jeffrey Masters. The &quot;LGBTQ&amp;A&quot; podcast features interviews with notable LGBTQ figures such as Pete Buttigieg, Laverne Cox, Lili Reinhart, Roxane Gay and Trixie Mattel. The series features a range of LGBTQ guests including activists, politicians, and members of the entertainment industry.

==Awards and accolades==
In January 2014 &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; cited three &quot;Advocate&quot; covers in its feature, &quot;23 Magazine Covers That Got It Right When Depicting Powerful Women&quot;: February 2011 (featuring Hillary Clinton), February 2012 (Nancy Pelosi) and January 2013 (Tammy Baldwin, .com edition). &quot;The Advocate&quot; won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Magazine Overall Coverage in 2020. In 2021, it won the GLAAD Media Award in the Outstanding Online Journalism Article category for the article &quot;Gay Men Speak Out After Being Turned Away from Donating Blood During Coronavirus Pandemic: &#x27;We are Turning Away Perfectly Healthy Donors.

<doc id="654223" wikidata="Q1135322" url="?curid=654223" title="Modbus">
<text>Modbus or MODBUS is a client/server data communications protocol in the application layer. It was originally designed for use with programmable logic controllers (PLCs), but has become a &quot;de facto&quot; standard communication protocol for communication between industrial electronic devices in a wide range of buses and networks.

Modbus is popular in industrial environments because it is openly published and royalty-free. It was developed for industrial applications, is relatively easy to deploy and maintain compared to other standards, and places few restrictions on the format of the data to be transmitted.

The Modbus protocol uses serial communication lines, Ethernet, or the Internet protocol suite as a transport layer. Modbus supports communication to and from multiple devices connected to the same cable or Ethernet network. For example, there can be a device that measures temperature and another device to measure humidity connected to the same cable, both communicating measurements to the same computer, via Modbus.

Modbus is often used to connect a plant/system supervisory computer with a remote terminal unit (RTU) in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Many of the data types are named from industrial control of factory devices, such as ladder logic because of its use in driving relays: a single-bit physical output is called a &quot;coil&quot;, and a single-bit physical input is called a &quot;discrete input&quot; or a &quot;contact&quot;.

It was originally published by Modicon in 1979. The company was acquired by Schneider Electric in 1997. In 2004, they transferred the rights to the Modbus Organization which is a trade association of users and suppliers of Modbus-compliant devices that advocates for the continued use of the technology.

==Protocol description==

Modbus standards or buses include:
* TCP/IP over Ethernet
* Asynchronous serial communication in a wide range of standards, technologies: EIA/TIA-232-E, EIA-422, EIA/TIA-485-A, fiber, radio frequency...
* MODBUS PLUS, a high speed token passing network.

To support Modbus communication on a network, many modems and gateways incorporate proprietary designs (refer to the diagram: &quot;Architecture of a network for Modbus communication&quot;). Implementations may deploy either wireline or wireless communication, such as in the ISM radio band, and even Short Message Service (SMS) or General Packet Radio Service (GPRS).

=== PDU and ADU ===
Modbus defines &quot;client&quot; which is an entity that initiates a transaction to request any specific task from its &quot;request receiver&quot;. The client&#x27;s &quot;request receiver&quot;, which the client has initiated the transaction with, is then called &quot;server&quot;. For example, when a Microcontroller unit (MCU) connects to a sensor to read its data by Modbus on a wired network, e.g RS485 bus, the MCU in this context is the client and the sensor is the server. In former terminology, the client was named master and the server named slave.

Modbus defines a protocol data unit (PDU) independently to its lower layer protocols in its protocol stack. Mapping MODBUS protocol on specific buses or networks requires some additional fields, defined as the application data unit (ADU). The ADU is formed by a &quot;client&quot; inside a Modbus network when the client initiates a transaction. Contents are:
* PDU = Function code + data
* ADU = Additional address + PDU + error check

The ADU is officially called a &quot;Modbus frame&quot; by the Modbus Organization, although &quot;frame&quot; is used as the data unit in the data-link layer in the OSI and TCP/IP model (while Modbus is an application layer protocol).

PDU max size is 253 bytes. ADU max size on RS232/RS485 network is 256 bytes, and with TCP is 260 bytes.

For data encoding, Modbus uses a big-endian representation for addresses and data fields. Thus, for a 16-bit value, the most significant byte is sent first. For example, when a 16-bit register has value 0x1234, byte 0x12 is sent before byte 0x34.

&quot;Function code&quot; is 1 byte which gives the code of the function to execute. Function codes are integer values, ranging from 1 to 255, and the range from 128 to 255 is for exception responses.

The data field of the PDU has the address from 0 to 65535 (not to be confused with the address of the Additional address field of ADU). The data field of the PDU can be empty, and then has a size of 0. In this case, the server will not request any information and the function code defines the function to be executed. If there is no error during the execution process, the data field of the ADU response from server to client will include the data requested, i.e. the data the client previously received. If there is any error, the server will respond with an exception code.

=== Modbus transaction and PDU ===
A Modbus transaction between client and server includes:

* Step 1: Client initiates a request with PDU = Function code + data request
* Step 2: Server receives the request from client. Server will then read/parse the function code, get the address of the data field of the PDU, then get this data field value and finally perform the action based on the function code. If there is no error during those steps, server will respond with PDU = Function code + data response. As long as there is no error during those steps, the server&#x27;s responding function code will also be the function code sent from the client. If there is any error during those steps, the server will respond with PDU = Exception Function code + Exception code (Reference to PDU mb_excep_rsp_pdu defined below).
* Step 3: Client receives the response and ends the transaction.

Based on that, Modbus defines 3 PDU types:
* MODBUS Request PDU, mb_req_pdu
* MODBUS Response PDU, mb_rsp_pdu
* MODBUS Exception Response PDU, mb_excep_rsp_pdu

:mb_req_pdu = Function code (1 byte) + request data (n bytes)

::&quot;request data&quot; field&#x27;s size depends on the function code and usually includes values like variable values, data offset, and sub-function codes.

:mb_rsp_pdu = Function code (1 byte) + response data (n bytes)
::As in mb_req_pdu, &quot;response data&quot; field&#x27;s size depends on the function code and usually includes values like variable values, data offset, and sub-function codes.

:mb_excep_rsp_pdu = Exception Function code (1 byte) + exception code (1 byte)
::&quot;Exception Function code&quot; = Function code (1 byte) + 0x80. &quot;Exception Function code&quot; is equal to the Function code, except that its MSB is set to 1.
::Exception code (1 byte) of mb_excep_rsp_pdu is defined in the MODBUS Exception Codes table.

=== Modbus data model ===
Modbus defines its data model based on a series of tables of four primary types:

For each of the primary tables, the protocol allows individual selection of 65536 data items,
and the operations of read or write of those items are designed to span multiple consecutive
data items up to a data size limit which is dependent on the transaction function code.

== Function code ==
Modbus defines three types of function codes: Public, User-Defined and Reserved.

=== Public function codes ===
Note: Some sources use terminology that differs from the standard; for example &quot;Force Single Coil&quot; instead of &quot;Write Single Coil&quot;.

==== Function code 01 (read coils) as an example of public function code ====
Function code 01 (read coils) allows reading the state from 1 to 2000 coils of a remote device. mb_req_pdu (request PDU) will then have 2 bytes to indicate the address of the first coil to read (from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF), and 2 bytes to indicate the number of coils to read. mb_req_pdu defines coil address by index 0, i.e the first coil has address 0x0. On a successful execution, mb_rsp_pdu will return one byte to note the function code (0x01), followed by one byte to indicate the number of data bytes it is returning (n), which will be the number of coils requested by mb_req_pdu, divided by 8 bits per byte, and rounded up. The remainder of the response will be the specified number (n) of data bytes. That is, the mb_req_pdu and mb_rsp_pdu of function code 01 will take the following form:

:mb_req_pdu:
:* Function code: 0x01 (1 byte)
:* Starting Address (1st coil address to read): From 0x0000 to 0xFFFF (2 bytes)
:* Quantity of coils to read: Range from 1 to 2000 (0x7D0) (2 bytes)

:mb_rsp_pdu:
:* Function code: 0x01 (1 byte)
:* Byte count: 1 byte (n=quantity of coils/8, rounded up)
:* Coil Status: n bytes

For instance, mb_req_pdu and mb_rsp_pdu to read coils status from 20-38 will be:

:mb_req_pdu:
:* Function code: 0x01
:* Starting Address High byte: 0x00
:* Starting Address Low byte: 0x13
:* Quantity of Outputs High byte: 0x00
:* Quantity of Outputs Low byte: 0x13
::Starting Address (2 bytes) is 0x0013, (or 19 in decimal) which is the 20th coil.
::Quantity of Outputs (2 bytes) is 0x0013, (or 19 in decimal) which corresponds to 19 values of status of coils 20th to 38th.

:mb_rsp_pdu:
:* Function code: 0x01
:* Byte Count: 0x03
:* Outputs status 27-20: 0xCD
:* Outputs status 35-28: 0x6B
:* Outputs status 38-36: 0x05
::As 19 coils (20-38) are required, 3 bytes is used to indicate the coil&#x27;s state. So that Byte Count is 0x03. States of coil from 20 to 27 is 0xCD, which is 1100 1101 in binary. So coil 27 is MSb, and coil 20 is LSb. Same for coil 28 to 35. With coil from 36 to 38, the state will be 0x05, which is 0000 0101. Coil 38 state is the 3rd bit (count from the right), i.e 1, coil 37 is 0, and coil 36 state is LSb bit, i.e. 1. 5 left bits are all 0.

=== User-defined function codes ===
User-Defined Function Codes are function codes defined by users. Modbus gives two range of values for user-defined function codes: 65 to 72 and 100 to 110. Obviously, user-defined function codes are not unique.

=== Reserved function codes ===
Reserved Function Codes are function codes used by some companies for legacy product and are not available for public use.

==Exception responses==
When a client sends a request to a server, there can be four possible events for that request:

* If server receives the request and execute successfully, server will return a normal response.
* If server cannot receive the request as having communication channel error, server will not response anything to the client. Client will then have the timeout request error.
* If server receives the request and detect an error on the communication channel (e.g parity, LRC, CRC), server will not response anything to the client. Client will then have the timeout request error.
* If server receives the request and is unable to execute it (e.g client requests to read a non-existent register), server will return an &quot;exception response&quot; to client to indicate the nature of the error.
Exception response message includes two other fields when compared to a normal response message:

* Function Code: Function code&#x27;s MSB bit of Exception is 1. This will make this function code 0x80 higher than then request message function code.
* Data: Server returns the exception code inside the Data field. This field defines the nature of the error.

All Modbus exception code:
== Modbus over Serial Line protocol ==
Modbus standard also defines Modbus over Serial Line, a protocol over the data link layer of the OSI model for the Modbus application layer protocol to be communicated over a serial bus. Modbus Serial Line protocol is a master-slave protocol which supports one master and multiple slaves in the serial bus. With Modbus protocol on the application layer, client/server model is used for the devices on the communication channel. With Modbus over Serial Line, &quot;client&quot; role is implemented by &quot;master&quot;, and the &quot;server&quot; role is implemented by &quot;slave&quot;.

The organization&#x27;s naming convention inverts the common usage of having multiple clients and only one server. To avoid this confusion, the RS-485 transport layer uses the terms &quot;node&quot; or &quot;device&quot; instead of &quot;server&quot;, and the &quot;client&quot; is not a &quot;node&quot;.

A serial bus for Modbus over Serial Line can have a maximum of 247 slaves communicating with one master. Those slaves have a unique address ranging from 1 to 247 (decimal value). The master doesn&#x27;t need to have an address. The communication process is initiated by the master, as only it can initiate a Modbus transaction. A slave will never transmit any data or perform any action without a request from the master, and slaves cannot communicate with each other.

In Modbus over Serial Line, the master initiates requests to the slaves in &quot;unicast&quot; or &quot;broadcast&quot; modes. In &quot;unicast mode&quot;, the master will initiate a request to a single slave with a specific address. Upon receiving and finishing the request, the slave will respond with a message to the master. In this mode, a Modbus transaction includes two messages: one request from the master and one reply from the slave. Each slave must have a unique address (from 1 to 247) to be addressed independently for the communication. In &quot;broadcast mode&quot;, the master can send a request to all the slaves, using the broadcast address 0, which is the address reserved for broadcast exchanges (and not the master address). Slaves must accept broadcast exchanges but must not respond.
The mapping of PDU of Modbus to the serial bus of Modbus over Serial Line protocol results in Modbus Serial Line PDU.

Modbus Serial Line PDU = Address + PDU + CRC (or LRC)

With PDU = Function code + data

* Address is slave address
* PDU is defined identically to the PDU of Modbus Application protocol
* The Error check field with CRC/LRC: The error check methods depend on the protocol versions of the MODBUS over Serial Line, whether it is &quot;Modbus RTU&quot; or &quot;Modbus ASCII&quot;.

On the physical layer, MODBUS over Serial Line performs its communication on bit by RS485 or RS232, with TIA/EIA-485 Two-Wire interface as the most popular way. RS485 Four-Wire interface is also used. TIA/EIA-232-E (RS232) can also be used but is limited to point-to-point short-range communication. MODBUS over Serial Line has two transmission modes &quot;RTU&quot; and &quot;ASCII&quot; which are corresponded to two versions of the protocol, known as &quot;Modbus RTU&quot; and &quot;Modbus ASCII&quot;.

=== Modbus RTU ===
Modbus RTU (Remote Terminal Unit), which is the most common implementation available for Modbus, makes use of a compact, binary representation of the data for protocol communication. The RTU format follows the commands/data with a cyclic redundancy check checksum as an error check mechanism to ensure the reliability of data. A Modbus RTU message must be transmitted continuously without inter-character hesitations. Modbus messages are framed (separated) by idle (silent) periods. Each byte (8 bits) of data is sent as 11 bits:

* 1 start bit
* 8 bit data/message, least significant bit sent first
* 1 bit parity
* 1 stop bit

The default is even parity, while odd or no parity may be implemented as additional options.

A Modbus RTU frame then will be:

The CRC calculation is widely known as CRC-16-MODBUS, whose polynomial is &quot;x&quot;16 + &quot;x&quot;15 + &quot;x&quot;2 + 1 (normal hexadecimal algebraic polynomial being codice_1 and reversed codice_2).

Example of a Modbus RTU frame in hexadecimal: codice_3 (CRC-16-MODBUS calculation for the 5 bytes from codice_4 to codice_5 gives codice_6, which is transmitted least significant byte first).

To ensure frame integrity during the transmission, the time interval between two frames must be at least the transmission time of 3.5 characters, and the time interval between two consecutive characters must be no more than the transmission time of 1.5 characters. For example, with the default data rate of 19200 bit/s, the transmission times of 3.5 (t3.5) and 1.5 (t1.5) 11-bit characters are:

formula_1

formula_2

For higher data rates, Modbus RTU recommends to use the fixed values 750 μs for t1.5 and 1.750 ms for t3.5.

=== Modbus ASCII ===
Modbus ASCII makes use of ASCII characters for protocol communication. The ASCII format uses a longitudinal redundancy check checksum. Modbus ASCII messages are framed by a leading colon (&quot;:&quot;) and trailing newline (CR/LF).

A Modbus ASCII frame includes:

Address, Function, Data, and LRC are ASCII hexadecimal encoded values, whereby 8-bit values (0–255) are encoded as two human-readable ASCII characters from the ranges 0–9 and A–F. For example, a value of 122 (7A16) is encoded as two ASCII characters, &quot;7&quot; and &quot;A&quot;, and transmitted as two bytes, codice_7 (3716, ASCII value for &quot;7&quot;) and codice_8 (4116, ASCII value for &quot;A&quot;).

LRC is calculated as the sum of 8-bit values (excluding the start and end characters), negated (two&#x27;s complement) and encoded as an 8-bit value. For example, if Address, Function, and Data are 247, 3, 19, 137, 0, and 10, the two&#x27;s complement of their sum (416) is −416; this trimmed to 8 bits is 96 (256 × 2 − 416 = 6016), giving the following 17 ASCII character frame: codice_9. LRC is specified for use only as a checksum: because it is calculated on the encoded data rather than the transmitted characters, its &#x27;longitudinal&#x27; characteristic is not available for use with parity bits to locate single-bit errors.

== Modbus Messaging on TCP/IP ==

=== Modbus TCP ===
&quot;Modbus TCP&quot; or &quot;Modbus TCP/IP&quot; is a Modbus variant used for communications over TCP/IP networks, connecting over port 502. It does not require a checksum calculation, as lower layers already provide checksum protection.

Modbus TCP nomenclature is the same as for the Modbus over Serial line protocol, as any device which send out a Modbus command, is the &#x27;client&#x27; and the response comes from a &#x27;server&#x27;.

The ADU for Modbus TCP is officially called &quot;Modbus TCP/IP ADU&quot; by the Modbus organization and is also called &quot;Modbus TCP frame&quot; by other parties. 

MODBUS TCP/IP ADU = MBAP Header + Function code + Data 

Where MBAP - which stands for MODBUS Application Protocol header - is the dedicated header used on TCP/IP to identify the MODBUS Application Data Unit. 

The MBAP Header contains the following fields: 
&quot;Unit identifier&quot; is used with Modbus TCP devices that are composites of several Modbus devices, e.g. Modbus TCP to Modbus RTU gateways. In such a case, the unit identifier is the Server Address of the device behind the gateway.

A MODBUS TCP/IP ADU/Modbus TCP frame format then will be:
====Example of a Modbus TCP/IP ADU/Modbus TCP frame in hexadecimal==== 

codice_10 

* codice_11 and codice_12 : With transaction ID = 0x1234 (2 bytes) as a &quot;unique number&quot; to be identified between the Modbus TCP client/server, the transaction ID High byte is 0x12 and transaction ID Low byte is 0x34
* codice_13 and codice_13 : Protocol identifier high byte and low byte
* codice_13 and codice_16 : Length high byte and low byte. The length is 6 bytes which includes: unit identifier (slave address) (1 byte), function code (1 byte), high byte of the register address to read (1 byte), low byte of the register address to read (1 byte) and data (2 bytes = high byte and low byte of the number of registers to read)
* codice_17 : Unit identifier (slave address)
* codice_18 : Function code (Read Multiple Holding Registers)
* codice_13 and codice_17 : high byte and low byte of the register address to read. The register address to read in this case is codice_21.
* codice_13 and codice_17 : high byte and low byte of the number of registers to read. The number of registers to read in this case is codice_21. (i.e 1 register)

=== Other Modbus protocol versions over TCP/IP ===

*&quot;Modbus over TCP/IP&quot;, &quot;Modbus over TCP&quot;, or &quot;Modbus RTU/IP&quot; – a variant that differs from Modbus TCP in that a checksum is included in the payload, as with Modbus RTU.
* &quot;Modbus over UDP&quot; – some have experimented with using Modbus over UDP on IP networks, which removes the overhead of TCP.

==Other Modbus protocol versions==
Besides the widely used Modbus RTU, Modbus ASCII and Modbus TCP, there are many variants of Modbus protocols:
* &quot;Modbus Plus&quot; (&quot;Modbus+&quot;, &quot;MB+&quot;, or &quot;MBP&quot;) – Modbus Plus is proprietary to Schneider Electric, though it is unpublished rather than patented, and unlike the other variants, it supports peer-to-peer communications between multiple clients. Despite the name, Modbus Plus is not a variant of Modbus. It is a different protocol, involving token passing. It requires a dedicated co-processor to handle fast HDLC-like token rotation. It uses twisted pair at 1 Mbit/s and includes transformer isolation at each node, which makes it transition/edge-triggered instead of voltage/level-triggered. Special hardware is required to connect Modbus Plus to a computer, typically a card made for the ISA, PCI, or PCMCIA bus. Modbus Plus is normally implemented using a custom chipset available only to partners of Schneider.
* &quot;Pemex Modbus&quot; – an extension of standard Modbus with support for historical and flow data. It was designed for the Pemex oil and gas company for use in process control and never gained widespread adoption.
* &quot;Enron Modbus&quot; – another extension of standard Modbus developed by Enron with support for 32-bit integer and floating-point variables, and historical and flow data. Data types are mapped using standard addresses. The historical data serves to meet an American Petroleum Institute (API) industry standard for how data should be stored.

Data models and function calls are identical for the first four variants listed above; only the encapsulation is different. However the variants are not interoperable, nor are the frame formats.

===JBUS mapping===
Another &quot;de facto&quot; protocol closely related to Modbus appeared later, and was defined by PLC maker April Automates, the result of a collaborative effort between French companies Renault Automation and Merlin Gerin et Cie in 1985: JBUS. Differences between Modbus and JBUS at that time (number of entities, server stations) are now irrelevant as this protocol almost disappeared with the April PLC series, which AEG Schneider Automation bought in 1994 and then made obsolete. However, the name JBUS has survived to some extent.

JBUS supports function codes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 15, and 16 and thus all the entities described above, although numbering is different:
* Number and address coincide: entity #&quot;x&quot; has address &quot;x&quot; in the data frame.
* Consequently, entity number does not include the entity type. For example, holding register #40010 in Modbus will be holding register #9, at address 9 in JBUS.
* Number 0 (and thus address 0) is not supported. The server should not implement any real data at this number and address, and it can return a null value or throw an error when requested.

==Limitations==
* Since Modbus was designed in the late 1970s to communicate to programmable logic controllers, the number of data types is limited to those understood by PLCs at the time. Large binary objects are not supported.
* No standard way exists for a node to find the description of a data object, for example, to learn that a register value represents a temperature between 30 and 175 degrees.
* Since Modbus is a client/server (formerly master/slave) protocol, there is no way for a field device to get data by the event handler mechanism (except over Ethernet TCP/IP, called open-mbus) as the client node must routinely poll each field device and look for changes in the data. This consumes bandwidth and network time in applications where bandwidth may be expensive, such as over a low-bit-rate radio link.
* Modbus is restricted to addressing 247 devices on one data link, which limits the number of field devices that may be connected to a parent station (again, Ethernet TCP/IP is an exception).
* Modbus protocol itself provides no security against unauthorized commands or interception of data.

<text>Grosse Pointe is a group of five adjacent suburbs in the Detroit metropolitan area on the shore of Lake St. Clair. From southwest to northeast, they are:

*Grosse Pointe Park
*Grosse Pointe
*Grosse Pointe Farms
*Grosse Pointe Shores (incorporated in 2009 from the remnants of two townships: Grosse Pointe Township in Wayne County and Lake Township in Macomb County)
*Grosse Pointe Woods

The terms &quot;Grosse Pointe&quot; or &quot;the Pointes&quot; are ordinarily used to refer to the entire area, referencing all five individual communities, with a total population of about 46,000. The Grosse Pointes altogether are 10.4 square miles, bordered by Detroit on the south and west, Lake St. Clair on the east and south, Harper Woods on the west of some portions, and St. Clair Shores on the north. The cities are in eastern Wayne County, except for a very small section in Macomb County. The Pointes begin six miles (10 km) northeast of downtown Detroit and extend several miles northeastward, in a narrow swath of land, to the edge of Wayne County. The name &quot;Grosse Pointe&quot; derives from the size of the area, and its projection into Lake St. Clair.

Grosse Pointe is a suburban area in Metro Detroit, sharing a border with northeast Detroit&#x27;s historic neighborhoods. Grosse Pointe has many famous historic estates along with remodeled homes and newer construction. Downtown Grosse Pointe, along Kercheval Avenue from Neff to Cadieux, nicknamed &quot;The Village,&quot; serves as a central business district for all five of the Grosse Pointes, although each of them (except Grosse Pointe Shores) has several blocks of retail. Downtown Detroit is just over seven miles (11 km) west of this downtown area, accessed by Jefferson Avenue, or several other cross-streets.

The north–south area along Lake St. Clair generally coincides with the boundaries of the two public high schools. The southern areas (basically south and west of Moross Road) feature retail districts.

==History==


Grosse Pointe, recognized for its historic reputation for scenery and landscape, has grown from a colonial outpost and a fertile area for small orchard owners and farmers to a coastal community with prime real estate chosen for grand estates.

The Grosse Pointes were first settled by French farmers in the 1750s after the establishment of the French Fort Pontchartrain. Members of the British Empire began arriving around the time of the Revolutionary War. In the 19th century, Grosse Pointe continued to be the site of lakefront ribbon farms: long narrow farms that each adjoin the lake, useful for irrigation and early transportation needs. Beginning in the 1850s, wealthy residents of Detroit began building second homes in the Grosse Pointe area, and soon afterward, hunting, fishing, and golf clubs appeared. Some grand estates arose in the late 19th century, and with the dawn of the automobile after 1900, Grosse Pointe became a preferred suburb for business executives in addition to a retreat for wealthy Detroiters. By the 1930s, most of the southern and western areas of Grosse Pointe contained established neighborhoods, with remaining gaps and the northern sections such as Grosse Pointe Woods developing after the 1930s.

In 1960, it was revealed that realtors in suburban Grosse Pointe ranked prospective home buyers by using a point system with categories such as race, nationality, occupation, and “degree of swarthiness.” Southern Europeans, Jews, and Poles required higher rankings than Northwestern European people in order to move into the community, while Asians and Blacks were excluded from living in Grosse Pointe altogether. Private detectives were used to investigate potential residents’ backgrounds. The revelation of this practice moved the state corporation and securities commissioner to issue a regulation to bar the licensing of real estate brokers who discriminated on the basis of race, religion, or national origin. Public hearings brought the national attention to the real estate discrimination situation in Detroit, which resulted in the expansion of open housing activity in the city.

A passenger rail line that connected Detroit to Mt. Clemens along the shore was operational by the late 1890s, making Grosse Pointe more accessible. As the automobile became the primary method of transportation and the rail line was decommissioned, the vista of what became Lake Shore Drive gradually improved. Lakeside estates are accessed from Lake Shore Drive and Jefferson Avenue.

Over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries, Grosse Pointe has gained a reputation as a notable American suburb; entrepreneurial leadership, recreational activities afforded by the Great Lakes waterway, an international border with Canada, and a focus on quality of education contributed to the successful development of the region. The Russell Alger Jr. House, at 32 Lake Shore Dr., serves as the Grosse Pointe War Memorial community center. Grosse Pointe contains fifteen recognized Michigan historical markers.

==Culture and contemporary life==

&quot;The Village&quot;, concentrated along Kercheval Avenue in Grosse Pointe, serves as a central business district for the five Pointes with traditional street-side shopping. The Village had its own Sanders Candy and Dessert Shop, founded by Frederick Sanders Schmidt, who opened a store Detroit in 1875. This location was closed in 2020. The Village has become a vibrant district with the emergence of mixed-use developments (more information at the Grosse Pointe page). Grosse Pointe Farms is home to &quot;The Hill&quot; district, located on a small bluff, which includes offices, stores, restaurants, and the main branch of the public library. Near its &quot;Cabbage Patch&quot; district, Grosse Pointe Park has retail and restaurants on multiple cross-streets, as well as a farmer&#x27;s market held weekly during the warm months. Grosse Pointe Woods&#x27; main business district lies along one of its main roads, Mack Avenue.

The recreational lifestyle historically associated with Grosse Pointe has given rise to many private clubs. The Country Club of Detroit in Grosse Pointe Farms features a notable classic course, tennis, and traditional amenities. The Grosse Pointe Yacht Club, at the intersection of Vernier Road and Lakeshore Drive on Lake St. Clair, is an acclaimed boating club. The Grosse Pointe Club, also called the &quot;Little Club,&quot; is a highly exclusive, historic club on the lakefront, on a site where wealthy Detroiters and Grosse Pointers have gathered for recreation since its organization in 1885, when Grosse Pointe was a cottage-town. The Lochmoor Club is another club in Grosse Pointe which has an expansive golf course and other amenities. The Hunt Club is the equestrian club of Grosse Pointe. It houses an impressive number of horses and stables for the suburban area.
Many prominent Detroiters, members of the Ford family, including Edsel Ford (son of Henry Ford) and his wife, Eleanor Clay Ford, as well as Henry Ford II (grandson of Henry Ford), have chosen to reside in Grosse Pointe. The Edsel and Eleanor Ford House, at 1100 Lake Shore Drive, is open to the public for guided tours.

Each city has at least one municipal park along Lake St. Clair. The landlocked Grosse Pointe Woods has its park at the southern tip of St. Clair Shores, adjacent to Grosse Pointe Shores. Access to each of these parks is restricted to residents of its municipality, causing occasional controversy among residents of both Grosse Pointe and other neighborhoods in Metro Detroit. Jefferson Avenue, a major thoroughfare in Detroit, becomes Lakeshore Drive between Grosse Pointe Farms and Grosse Pointe Shores, and is the scenic carriageway of all five Grosse Pointes, after skirting the eastern neighborhoods of Detroit. Lakeshore Drive was featured on HGTV&#x27;s television program &quot;Dream Drives&quot; and in the films &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot; and &quot;Gran Torino&quot;.

The region is home to University Liggett School, Michigan&#x27;s oldest independent school, and two public high schools: Grosse Pointe South High School and Grosse Pointe North High School, which are the termini of the Grosse Pointe Public School System.

Newspapers and community organizations generally serve all five cities, as do the public library and school system, but municipal services are separate. &quot;The Grosse Pointe News&quot;, on a weekly basis, and the &quot;Grosse Pointe Times&quot;, on a semi-weekly basis, publish local news, though the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; and &quot;The Detroit News&quot; provide the majority of regional, national and international news.

==Architecture==

Grosse Pointe has a significant collection of historic architecture as well as some newer mansions. Albert Kahn designed the Edsel &amp; Eleanor Ford House (1927) at 1100 Lakeshore Dr. in Grosse Pointe. Rose Terrace (1934–1976), the mansion of Anna Thompson Dodge, once stood at 12 Lakeshore Dr. in Grosse Pointe. Designed by Horace Trumbauer as a Louis XV styled château, Rose Terrace was an enlarged version of the firm&#x27;s Miramar in Newport, Rhode Island. A developer, the highest bidder for Rose Terrace, demolished it in 1976 to create an upscale neighborhood. This gave a renewed sense of urgency to preservationists. The Dodge Art Collection from Rose Terrace may be viewed at the Detroit Institute of Arts. The Italian Renaissance styled Russell A. Alger House (1910), at 32 Lakeshore Dr., by architect Charles A. Platt serves as the Grosse Pointe War Memorial. Many noted architects designed works in Grosse Pointe including Albert Kahn, Marcel Breuer, Marcus Burrowes, Chittendon and Kotting, Crombie &amp; Stanton, Wallace Frost, Robert O. Derrick, John M. Donaldson, Louis Kamper, August Geiger, William Kessler, Hugh T. Keyes, George D. Mason, Charles A. Platt, Leonard Willeke, Eliel and Eero Saarinen, Field, Hinchman, and Smith, William Buck Stratton, and Minoru Yamasaki. Included below are examples of some of Grosse Pointe&#x27;s many historic structures.

<text>Thomas &quot;Blind Tom&quot; Wiggins (May 25, 1849June 14, 1908) was an American pianist and composer. He had numerous original compositions published and had a lengthy and largely successful performing career throughout the United States. During the 19th century, Wiggins was one of the best-known American performing pianists and one of the best-known Black musicians.

==Early life==
Wiggins was born Thomas Greene on the Wiley Edward Jones Plantation in Harris County, Georgia. Blind at birth, he was sold in 1850 along with his enslaved parents, Charity and Domingo &quot;Mingo&quot; Wiggins, to a Columbus, Georgia lawyer, General James Neil Bethune. Bethune was &quot;the first [newspaper] editor in the south to openly advocate secession&quot;. Wiggins&#x27;s name was variously reported as &quot;Thomas Greene Bethune&quot;, &quot;Thomas Wiggins&quot;, or &quot;Thomas Bethune&quot;; his name was changed due to his slave status. The headstone at his grave reads &quot;Thomas Greene Wiggins&quot;.

Because Tom was blind, he could not perform work normally demanded of slaves. Instead, he was left to play and explore the Bethune plantation. At an early age, Tom showed an interest in the piano after hearing the instrument played by Bethune&#x27;s daughters. By age four, he reportedly had acquired some piano skills by ear, and gained access to the piano. By age five, Tom reportedly had composed his first tune, &quot;The Rain Storm&quot;, after a torrential downpour on a tin roof. With his skills recognized by General Bethune, Tom was permitted to live in a room attached to the family house, equipped with a piano. Neighbor Otto Spahr, reminiscing about Tom in the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; in 1908 (as reproduced in &quot;The Ballad of Blind Tom&quot;, by Deirdre O&#x27;Connell), observed: &quot;Tom seemed to have but two motives in life: the gratification of his appetite and his passion for music. I don&#x27;t think I exaggerate when I state that he made the piano go for twelve hours out of twenty-four.&quot;

As a child, Tom began to echo the sounds around him, repeating accurately the crow of a rooster or the singing of a bird. If he was left alone in the cabin, Tom was known to begin beating on pots and pans or dragging chairs across the floor in an attempt to make any kind of noise. By the age of four, Tom was able to repeat conversations up to 10 minutes in length but was barely able to adequately communicate his own needs, resorting to grunts and gestures.

Another example of Tom&#x27;s extraordinary abilities was shown after he was taken to a political rally in 1860 in support of Democratic presidential candidate Stephen Douglas. Years after he had attended this speech, he was still able to repeat it while capturing the tone and mannerisms of Douglas. Additionally, he was able to recreate the heckles and cheers of the crowd with remarkable precision.

Bethune hired out &quot;Blind Tom&quot; from the age of eight years to concert promoter Perry Oliver, who toured him extensively in the US, performing as often as four times a day and earning Oliver and Bethune up to $100,000 a year, an enormous sum for the time, &quot;equivalent to $1.5 million/year [in 2004], making Blind Tom undoubtedly the nineteenth century&#x27;s most highly compensated pianist&quot;. General Bethune&#x27;s family eventually made a fortune estimated at $750,000 at the hands of Blind Tom. Oliver marketed Tom as a &quot;Barnum-style freak&quot; advertising the transformation from animal to artist. In the media, Tom was frequently compared to a bear, baboon, or mastiff.

Bethune hired professional musicians to play for Tom, who could faithfully reproduce their performances, often after a single listening. Eventually he learned a reported 7,000 pieces of music, including hymns, popular songs, waltzes, and classical repertoire.

==Professional career==

There are conflicting historical accounts of Blind Tom&#x27;s first public performance, some indicating he was as young as three. One account from 1857 indicates that he had been performing publicly for several years. Newspaper reviews and audience reactions were favorable, prompting General Bethune to undertake a concert tour with Tom around their home state of Georgia. Tom later toured the South with Bethune or accompanied by hired managers, though their travels and bookings were sometimes hampered by the north–south hostilities which were drawing the nation towards Civil War. In 1860, Blind Tom performed at the White House before President James Buchanan; he was the first African-American to give a command performance at the White House. Mark Twain attended many of Blind Tom&#x27;s performances over several decades and chronicled the proceedings.

On- and off-stage, Tom often referred to himself in the third person (e.g., &quot;Tom is pleased to meet you&quot;). His piano recitals were augmented by other talents, including uncanny voice mimicry of public figures and nature sounds. He also displayed a hyperactive physicality both onstage and off. A letter written in 1862 by a soldier in North Carolina described some of Tom&#x27;s eccentric capabilities: &quot;One of his most remarkable feats was the performance of three pieces of music at once. He played &#x27;Fisher&#x27;s Hornpipe&#x27; with one hand and &#x27;Yankee Doodle&#x27; with the other and sang &#x27;Dixie&#x27; all at once. He also played a piece with his back to the piano and his hands inverted.&quot; At concerts, skeptics attempted to confirm if Tom&#x27;s performance replications were mere trickery; their challenge took the form of having Tom hear and repeat two new, uncirculated compositions. Tom did so perfectly. The &quot;audience challenge&quot; eventually became a regular feature of his concerts.

Supposedly, Tom&#x27;s talents profited the Confederacy during the Civil War. His most famous piece, &quot;The Battle of Manassas&quot;, is the story of the Confederate Army&#x27;s 1861 victory at the Battle of Bull Run. As a result, many black newspapers refused to celebrate him, pointing out that he served to reinforce negative stereotypes about African-American individuals and that he was only a source of profit for slaveholders.

The Emancipation Proclamation in 1862 freed all slaves in the Confederate states; all US slaves were not freed until the Thirteenth Amendment passed in December 1865. In 1866, at age 16, Tom was taken on a European concert tour by General Bethune, who collected testimonials about Tom&#x27;s natural talents from composer-pianist Ignaz Moscheles and pianist-conductor Charles Hallé. These were printed in a booklet, &quot;The Marvelous Musical Prodigy Blind Tom&quot;, and used to bolster Tom&#x27;s international reputation.

In 1875, General Bethune transferred management of Blind Tom&#x27;s professional affairs to his son John Bethune, who accompanied Tom on tour around the U.S. for the next eight years. Beginning in 1875, John brought Blind Tom to New York each summer. While living with John in a boarding house on the Lower East Side, Tom added to his repertoire under the tutelage of Joseph Poznanski, who also transcribed new compositions by Tom for publication. Many of these were, at Tom&#x27;s insistence, published under such pseudonyms as Professor W.F. Raymond, J.C. Beckel, C.T. Messengale, and Francois Sexalise.

Tom&#x27;s piano-playing behavior, both during practice and performance, was eccentric. &quot;We had two pianos in one room&quot;, Poznanski told the &quot;Washington Post&quot; in 1886 (as recounted in O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s biography). &quot;I would play for him and he would get up, walk around, stand on one foot, pull his hair, knock his head against the wall, then sit down and play a very good imitation of what I had played with additions to it. His memory was something prodigious. He never forgot anything.&quot; This led some critics to dismiss Tom as a novelty act, a &quot;human parrot.&quot; Novelist Willa Cather, writing in the &quot;Nebraska State Journal&quot;, called Tom &quot;a human phonograph, a sort of animated memory, with sound producing power.&quot;

John Steinbeck has compared the main character in a short story of his, &quot;Johnny Bear&quot;, to Blind Tom.

No original recordings of Blind Tom appear to exist. His sheet music is available, but only a small number of musicians have ever recorded his original songs.

==Custody battle==

In 1882, John Bethune married his landlady, Eliza Stutzbach, who had demonstrated a knack for mollifying Tom&#x27;s sometimes volatile temperament. However, shortly after their marriage, John Bethune embarked on an extended tour of the U.S. with Tom, in effect abandoning Eliza. When Bethune returned home eight months later, his wife filed for divorce. The couple split up—John took Tom—but a bitter legal squabble ensued, with Eliza hounding John for financial support, a claim that the courts usually adjudicated in John&#x27;s favor. After John Bethune died in a railway accident in 1884, Tom was returned—over Eliza&#x27;s objections—to the care of General Bethune (now living in Virginia). Eliza sued General Bethune for custody, with Tom&#x27;s elderly mother Charity enjoined by Eliza&#x27;s attorney as a party in the plaintiff&#x27;s suit. After a protracted custody battle in several courts, in August 1887 Tom was awarded to Eliza, who moved Tom back to New York. Charity accompanied them with the understanding that she would benefit financially from Tom&#x27;s earnings. However, after it became apparent that Eliza did not intend to honor any financial obligations to Charity, Tom&#x27;s mother returned to Georgia.

Tom continued performing and touring for a number of years under the management of Eliza and her attorney (and later husband) Albrecht Lerche. Tom was on tour in western Pennsylvania in May 1889 on the day of the Johnstown Flood, and rumor spread that he was among the casualties. Despite his continued appearances on the U.S. concert circuit, the rumor persisted for years, with some observers expressing skepticism that the Blind Tom who appeared in concert after 1889 was the &quot;real Blind Tom&quot;.

In this phase of his career, Tom usually introduced himself onstage in the third person, imitating the pronouncements of his various managers from years past. He talked about his mental state with a characteristic lack of self-awareness. He had been diagnosed as &quot;non compos mentis&quot; by a doctor, and in his foggy netherworld the phrase was a matter of personal pride. Willa Cather described the poignance of one such concert: &quot;It was a strange sight to see him walk out on stage with his own lips—another man&#x27;s words—introduce himself and talk quietly about his own idiocy. There was insanity, a grotesque horribleness about it that was interestingly unpleasant. One laughs at the man&#x27;s queer actions, and yet, after all, the sight is not laughable. It brings us too near to the things that we sane people do not like to think of.&quot;

Tom was still traveling, and presumably still performing, in 1894. On July 5 of that year, he arrived in Grand Junction, Colorado, on his way eastward from California. The trainmen at that place were on strike against the railroads as part of the Pullman Strike, and Tom was stuck in town until July 9, when he continued eastward via the Colorado Midland Railroad.

After being dogged by incessant legal challenges to her custodianship of Tom, Eliza took Tom off the concert circuit in the mid-1890s.

==Later years==
Tom spent the next ten years as a ward of Eliza and her husband, who divided their time between New York City and New Jersey&#x27;s Navesink Highlands. In 1903, Eliza arranged for Tom to appear on the popular vaudeville circuit, beginning with Brooklyn&#x27;s Orpheum Theater. He spent almost a year performing in vaudeville, before his health began to deteriorate. It is believed that Tom experienced a stroke (described in some reports as &quot;partial paralysis&quot;) in December 1904, which ended his public performing career.
After the death of her husband, Eliza relocated to Hoboken, New Jersey, with Tom. They kept out of public view, though neighbors could hear Tom&#x27;s piano playing at all hours of the day and night. Tom experienced a major stroke in April 1908, and died the following June. He was 59 years old. Tom was buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, New York.

==Posthumous recognition==
The people of Columbus, Georgia, raised a commemorative headstone for Tom in 1976. He was the subject of a play titled &quot;HUSH: Composing Blind Tom Wiggins&quot;, by Robert Earl Price, which was performed on the Atlanta stage with Del Hamilton as director.

Between 1970 and 2000, Dr. Geneva Handy Southall wrote a three-volume thesis titled &quot;Blind Tom: The Black Pianist Composer; Continuously Enslaved&quot;; it was published by Scarecrow Press in 2002.

In 1981, Tom was the subject of a film, &quot;Blind Tom: The Story of Thomas Bethune&quot;, directed by Mark W. Travis.

In 1999 John Davis recorded an album of Tom&#x27;s original compositions on a CD entitled &quot;John Davis Plays Blind Tom&quot;. The CD package included essays by Amiri Baraka, Ricky Jay and Oliver Sacks.

In 2006, Reagan Grimsley published an article about preserving the sheet music of Blind Tom for future generations. Titled &quot;Discovering &quot;Blind&quot; Tom Wiggins: Creating Digital Access to Original Sheet Music at the Columbus State University Archives&quot;, it appeared in Music Reference Quarterly.

A full-length biography, &quot;The Ballad of Blind Tom&quot;, by Deirdre O&#x27;Connell was published by Overlook Press in 2009.

Andre T. Regan&#x27;s 2013 documentary, &quot;The Last Legal Slave in America&quot;, documents the life and times of Blind Tom.

The Elton John song &quot;The Ballad of Blind Tom&quot;, from his 2013 album &quot;The Diving Board&quot;, is about Blind Tom.

Blind Tom Wiggins is the subject of a novel, &quot;The Song of the Shank&quot;, (2014) by Jeffrey Reynard Allen.

Blind Tom Wiggins is also the subject in a sequence of poems in &quot;Olio&quot; (2016) by Tyehimba Jess.

In 2019, Blind Tom was featured on a mural depicting the history of performing and visual arts in New Braunfels, Texas as part of the city&#x27;s 175th anniversary celebration.

<text>Memphis Theological Seminary is an ecumenical seminary of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in Memphis, Tennessee. Although it is affiliated with the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, it accepts and trains ministerial candidates from other denominations as well. Besides the traditional Master of Divinity (MDiv), Memphis Theological Seminary also grants the Master of Arts in Christian Ministry (MACM) with concentrations in Social Justice, Christian Education, and Chaplaincy, as well as the Doctor of Ministry (DMin). It also administers the Cumberland Presbyterian denomination&#x27;s Program of Alternate Studies or PAS.

== History ==
MTS is a continuation of the Cumberland Presbyterian Theological School, which was originally started in McLemoresville, Tennessee in 1852. It was moved from the campus of Bethel College in McKenzie, Tennessee, to Memphis in 1964.

The school was moved into the Newburger House, which was constructed in 1912 for Judge Joseph Newburger. The residence was designed by the prominent Memphis architectural firm of Hanker and Cairns. 

== Organization ==
The president is Jody Hill. The seminary is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS) and the Commission on Colleges and Schools of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). The seminary is also approved by the University Senate of the United Methodist Church to educate United Methodist theological students.

The seminary is located in Midtown Memphis at the corner of Union Avenue and East Parkway, across town from the denominational Cumberland Presbyterian Center in Cordova, Tennessee.

<text>Johan Philip Lansberge (25 August 1561 – 8 December 1632) was a Flemish Calvinist Minister, astronomer and Mathematician. His name is sometimes written Lansberg, and his first name is sometimes given as Philip or Johannes Philippus. He published under the Latin name Philippus Lansbergius.

He is best known as the author of a set of astronomical tables, &quot;Tabulae motuum coelestium perpetuæ&quot;, for predicting planetary positions. These were later found to contain certain errors, in part because he (erroneously) did not accept Kepler&#x27;s discovery of elliptical orbits. He served as a Protestant clergyman.

Martinus Hortensius was one of his students, and Landsberge subsequently collaborated with his former pupil.

He was born in Ghent in modern-day Belgium in 1561. He grew up in France and studied in England. After the Fall of Antwerp in 1585, he moved to the northern part of the Netherlands. He stayed in Leiden for a short time, and then he went to Goes to become a preacher. Lansbergen lived there until 1613. In that year, he was fired because he did not agree with a mayoral election. The fifty-two-year-old Lansbergen decided to move to Middelburg to devote himself to astronomical research, which he did until the end of his life.

Lansbergen supported the heliocentric theory of Copernicus, who claimed that the Earth revolves around the Sun. This theory was controversial in both Catholic and Protestant circles, where the geocentric theory had been more widely held.

He married Sara Lievaerts in 1586 and they had six sons and four daughters. He had a great reputation, because of his rare knowledge and expertise. Not only in matters of the church, but even more in mathematics and physics. In 1611, his son Pieter (1587) became a preacher in Goes. Jacob, another son, moved to Goes as well, but became a medical doctor. Lansbergens&#x27; oldest son, also called Philippus, was a preacher in Kloetinge and died there in 1647.

Lansbergen wrote several books. One of those, &quot;Considerations about the daily and yearly movements of the Earth&quot;, became a best-seller. One could say that Lansbergen was the first Dutch author that wrote a popular book about the movements of the planets around the Sun.

Kepler and Galileo, who lived in the same period, were very interested in the work of Lansbergen. Based on his tables, they could predict the movements of the planets more accurately.

Lansbergen probably lived in the &quot;Spanjaardstraat&quot; in Middelburg. He had frequent contacts with sympathizers, like the Dutch poet Jacob Cats. Cats wrote three poems about the &quot;very wise, famous, and honored Philippus Lansbergen&quot;.

He died in Middelburg in December 1632.

The Philippus Lansbergen Public Observatory in Middleburg is named after him, and so is the lunar crater Lansberg.

<text>A pyramidal peak, sometimes called a glacial horn in extreme cases, is an angular, sharply pointed mountain peak which results from the cirque erosion due to multiple glaciers diverging from a central point. Pyramidal peaks are often examples of nunataks.

==Formation==
Glaciers, typically forming in drainages on the sides of a mountain, develop bowl-shaped basins called cirques (sometimes called &#x27;corries&#x27; – from Scottish Gaelic [kʰəɾə] (a bowl) – or s). Cirque glaciers have rotational sliding that abrades the floor of the basin more than walls and that causes the bowl shape to form. As cirques are formed by glaciation in an alpine environment, the headwall and ridges between parallel glaciers called arêtes become more steep and defined. This occurs due to freeze/thaw and mass wasting beneath the ice surface. It is widely held that a common cause for headwall steepening and extension headward is the crevasses known as bergschrund that occur between the moving ice and the headwall. Plucking and shattering can be seen here by those exploring the crevasses. A cirque is exposed when the glacier that created it recedes.

When three or more of these cirques converge on a central point, they create a pyramid-shaped peak with steep walls. These horns are a common shape for mountain tops in highly glaciated areas. The number of faces of a horn depends on the number of cirques involved in the formation of the peak: three to four is most common. Horns with more than four faces include the Weissmies and the Mönch. A peak with four symmetrical faces is called a &quot;Matterhorn&quot; (after the Matterhorn, a mountain in the Alps).

The peak of a glacial horn will often outlast the arêtes on its flanks. As the rock around it erodes, the horn gains in prominence. Eventually, a glacial horn will have near vertical faces on all sides. In the Alps, &quot;horn&quot; is also the name of very exposed peaks with slope inclinations of 45-60° (e.g. Kitzbüheler Horn).

<text>Amanda Walsh is a Canadian actress, writer, and former VJ for the Canadian television station MuchMusic.

==Early life==
Walsh was born in Rigaud, Quebec. She went to Hudson High School, in Hudson, Quebec.

==Career==
Walsh began working as a professional actor at age 12. She has dabbled in sketches and stand-up comedy, with numerous TV appearances. She won a gold medal win at the 2000 Improv Games in Quebec as a member of the &quot;8 People&quot; troupe. She is a graduate from John Abbott College, Creative Arts program.

===MuchMusic===
Walsh was encouraged to apply for the position of a MuchMusic VJ by one of the channel&#x27;s producer while waiting tables in Hudson, Quebec. She applied and got the job, becoming the youngest VJ in MuchMusic history at the age of nineteen. She has hosted or co-hosted many programmes including &quot;Much Top Tens&quot;, &quot;Electric Circus&quot;, &quot;MuchOnDemand&quot;, &quot;Fandemonium&quot; and others. She left MuchMusic in 2004 to pursue an acting career.

===2000s work===
Walsh made appearances on TV shows such as &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, and also had a minor role in the film &quot;Disturbia&quot;. In 2005, she starred opposite David Boreanaz in the movie &quot;These Girls&quot;, based on the play by Vivienne Laxdale. The movie was shown at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. She had a small role in the movie &quot;Stardom (2000)&quot; playing an overenthusiastic VJ on a parody of the Canadian music channel MuchMusic.

After moving to Los Angeles, Walsh got a starring role in the ABC mid-season replacement &quot;Sons &amp; Daughters&quot;, which premiered in March 2006. &quot;Sons &amp; Daughters&quot; was a semi-improvisational sitcom. The show was canceled, with only eleven episodes created. Her portrayal of Katie in the unaired pilot for the sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; was not well-received. However, the character was re-written and Walsh was replaced by Kaley Cuoco (as Penny) in the second pilot.

In 2007, she had a role in the ABC movie &quot;Full of It&quot; as Vicki Sanders. In 2008, Walsh had a role in the Internet series &quot;The Remnants&quot; with Ze Frank. She can be seen in the 2009 comedy film &quot;Ghosts of Girlfriends Past&quot;. In 2010, she appeared in ABC Family&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Briefcase&quot; playing Hilary Duff&#x27;s best friend Joanne. She was cast as the lead in the pilot episode for The CW&#x27;s dramedy &quot;Danni Lowinski&quot;. She made appearances in the TV shows &quot;Grimm&quot;, &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; and &quot;NCIS&quot;. In 2014–2015, she appeared in ten episodes of the TV show &quot;Lost Girl&quot; as Elizabeth Helm/Zee. In 2017, she appeared in the second season of &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot; in the central role of Suzie Boreton. The show was canceled at the end of the season.

Walsh became one of the story editors for the Canadian TV comedy &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot; and wrote one of the episodes for season 1. Walsh then had a role in the 2022 film &quot;Doula&quot;. Walsh appeared in season three of the Canadian drama &quot;Pretty Hard Cases&quot;.

<text>Good Eats is an American television cooking show, created and hosted by Alton Brown, which aired in North America on Food Network and later Cooking Channel. Likened to television science educators Mr. Wizard and Bill Nye, Brown explores the science and technique behind the cooking, the history of different foods, and the advantages of different kinds of cooking equipment. The show tends to focus on familiar dishes that can easily be made at home, and also features segments on choosing the right appliances, and getting the most out of inexpensive, multi-purpose tools. Each episode has a distinct theme, which is typically an ingredient or a certain cooking technique, but may also be a more general theme such as Thanksgiving. In the tenth anniversary episode, Brown stated that the show was inspired by the idea of combining Julia Child, Mr. Wizard, and Monty Python. On May 11, 2011, Brown confirmed that the series would come to an end, ceasing production at episode 249. &quot;Good Eats&quot; is the third longest running Food Network series, behind &quot;30 Minute Meals&quot; and &quot;Barefoot Contessa&quot;.

In 2018, Cooking Channel premiered a spin-off, &quot;Good Eats: Reloaded&quot;, which combines footage from past episodes with new segments commenting on advances in cooking science and knowledge that had occurred since the original airdate. In 2019, the series was revived, with a new season on Food Network in August 2019. A second season of the revival was produced but in July 2021, Brown announced that &quot;Good Eats: The Return&quot; would not be returning for a third season.

==Format==
The show had a distinct visual style involving Dutch angles and shots from cameras placed inside and on various items in the kitchen, including the ovens, refrigerator, and microwave oven. In some episodes, Brown and other actors play various characters to tell the story of the food. For example, in the episode &quot;The Big Chili,&quot; Brown played a cowboy trying to rustle up the ideal pot of chili. In the episode &quot;Give Peas a Chance&quot; (a parody of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;), Brown plays a Father Merrin-like character who tries to convince a &quot;possessed&quot; child to eat (and like) peas. In other episodes Brown is simply himself, but interacts with fictional characters such as his eggplant- and tomato-wielding neighbor Mr. McGregor, or a city councilman who refuses to eat fudge. He also uses various makeshift teaching aids to demonstrate scientific concepts. They also feature many episodes where the ingredients themselves are portrayed by actors, represented by an agent who uses Brown to &quot;gussy up&quot; these foods for mainstream appeal.

Episodes of &quot;Good Eats&quot; typically began with an introductory monologue or skit that leads into the phrase &quot;good eats.&quot; The show often closed with the phrase as well. For the first several seasons, Brown himself would say the words &quot;good eats.&quot; Since approximately season seven, however, Brown avoids saying &quot;good eats&quot; at the end of the intro, stopping just short and allowing the main title graphics to complete the phrase.

Episodes were primarily set in the (fictional) kitchen of Brown&#x27;s house, although his actual home kitchen was used in &quot;Give Peas a Chance.&quot; In seasons 1–4, the episodes were shot in the actual home kitchen of Brown&#x27;s original partners in the Atlanta, Georgia, area. In season 5, taping moved to the new home of the show&#x27;s Line Producer (Dana Popoff) and Director of Photography (Marion Laney), in which they built a much larger and more versatile kitchen for taping. A section of the island was built for the show and placed on wheels, so it can be moved (or removed) for various shots, and a grid of pipe was hung from the ceiling, for easier placement of cameras and microphones. Starting with season 7, the show moved, this time to an exact replica of the previous kitchen and surrounding areas of the home, built on a sound stage. In the &quot;Behind the Eats&quot; special, Brown said that complaints by Popoff&#x27;s neighbors (not adjacent neighbors but at the end of the block) prompted the move. The stove top and the sink are the only functioning pieces in this kitchen. Many of the other appliances have even had part of their backs removed, so shots of Brown can be taken from inside cabinets, ovens, and refrigerators. This change was generally not known until after season 7 started airing when the house used in season 5–6 was put on eBay for sale. It was then revealed that they had moved. It is generally thought that in the &quot;Q&quot; episode on barbecue that was taped in Brown&#x27;s Airstream trailer, when Brown says that they are &quot;building the set for Good Eats: The Motion Picture&quot; this is in reality a reference to the new house set. The set was not officially unveiled on the show as a set until &quot;Curious Yet Tasty Avocado Experiments.&quot;

Incidental music during the show is typically a variation of the show&#x27;s theme, which in turn was inspired by music from the film &quot;Get Shorty&quot;. There are dozens of variations of the theme played throughout, crossing all genres of music, including the keypad tones in &quot;Mission: Poachable&quot; and nearly every incidence where a countdown of ten seconds is used. New music is composed for each episode by Patrick Belden of Belden Music and Sound. Brown met Belden while working on other projects before Brown&#x27;s culinary training.

Each episode also featured tidbits, text pieces containing trivia related to the food or cooking technique featured in the episode. These are always shown just before ad breaks, and are often shown between major transitions in location or cooking action. The information presented is usually notes about the history of the food or technique, helpful cooking hints, or technical or scientific information which would be too detailed or dry to include as part of the show&#x27;s live content.

During the show&#x27;s first seasons, at the end of each episode Brown would give a summary of the important points covered during the episode; these points would be shown on the screen as he talked. These summaries still appear in later seasons from time to time, but rarely have the textual accompaniment. Brown also traveled to food manufacturing facilities frequently in the first few seasons to talk with experts about the foods being featured. In later seasons, he still visits farms, groves, and other places food is grown as well as processing plants and other factories, but less frequently.

Beginning in season 9, episodes have been recorded in high definition, and these episodes also appear on Food Network HD.

==Cast and crew==
A staple feature of &quot;Good Eats&quot; is the presence of several recurring characters who play important roles on the show, from Brown&#x27;s relatives and neighbors to various . In season 9, the episode &quot;Behind the Eats&quot; offered a backstage look at the show&#x27;s production and revealed the origin of several characters. In the episode, Brown stated that all of the show&#x27;s staff members have appeared on camera at some point.

Several members of Brown&#x27;s real-life family have appeared on the show. His mother had a walk-on part; his daughter, Zoey, has appeared in several episodes; and his late grandmother, &quot;Ma&quot; Mae Skelton, co-hosted the biscuit episode &quot;The Dough Also Rises.&quot; Even his Basset Hound and iguana have shown up in a couple of episodes. However, his then-wife DeAnna (who is also the show&#x27;s executive producer) has never appeared in an episode, though she was mentioned in &quot;Where There&#x27;s Smoke, There&#x27;s Fish.&quot; Specialists who hold real-life positions commonly appeared as themselves to provide Brown with useful information on the topic at hand.

===Recurring characters===

====Fictional====
====Real====
Brown plays other roles from time to time, often consisting of him explaining something in the foreground while another Alton Brown demonstrates in the background (similar to the technique used to present B.A. Brown). Sometimes he participates in an on-screen skit to re-enact such topics as cavemen discovering cooking techniques, while providing a voice-over narrative. At other times Brown talks to another character played by himself, with the camera cutting between the two as each delivers his lines, for instance, when he is (also) playing a Government Agent.

==History==
Two pilot episodes for &quot;Good Eats&quot; (&quot;Steak Your Claim&quot; and &quot;This Spud&#x27;s For You&quot;) aired on the Chicago, Illinois, PBS affiliate WTTW-TV in July 1998.

The show was discovered by Food Network when an executive saw a clip of the show on the Eastman Kodak website which used the clip to showcase a new type of film stock sold by the company. The show was picked up in July 1999 by Food Network, which then owned exclusive rights to the show. The back catalog of shows were added to the repeat rotation of sister network Cooking Channel in the fall of 2011, and Brown announced that his contract with Food Network had expired and moved to Cooking Channel in 2011. 

New episodes aired on Wednesdays in the late evenings from 1999 to 2007, when they were moved to Mondays at 8 p.m. From July 9, 2007, until summer 2009, at least two different episodes aired each weeknight (8 p.m. and 11 p.m., along with late-night replays at 2 a.m.), with a third airing on Wednesday nights at 8:30 p.m.; additional episodes were occasionally added (usually coinciding with a Food Network series or event).

On October 10, 2009, &quot;Good Eats&quot; celebrated its 10th anniversary with an hour-long live stage show aired on the Food Network. Guests included Ted Allen of &quot;Food Detectives&quot; and &quot;Chopped&quot;. One of the demonstrations in the show proved that a fire extinguisher was not a unitasker, as Brown constantly repeated in regular episodes that the fire extinguisher was the only unitasker in the kitchen.

On the January 4, 2010, episode, &quot;Good Eats&quot; revealed Brown&#x27;s changed eating habits that led to his losing in 9 months. Brown emphasized that he was not on a diet in the modern American sense of the word (a temporary change in eating habits), but in the original Greek meaning (a permanent shift). Brown went on to describe a regimen that prescribes certain healthful foods with specific degrees of regularity (daily, once every two days, etc.) while proscribing unhealthy foods. Prescribed foods included breakfast every day (usually a fruit smoothie), oily fish, whole grains, etc. The episode comically claimed the entire story was in Brown&#x27;s new book, &quot;Buff Like Me&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Good Eats&quot; was nominated for the James Beard Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Best T.V. Food Journalism Award&quot; in 2000, and the series earned a Peabody Award in 2006. &quot;Rarely has science been taught on TV in such an entertaining – and appetizing – manner as it is in Alton Brown&#x27;s goofy, tirelessly inventive series.&quot;

In 2011, Brown was given the James Beard Award for Best TV Food Personality for his work on &quot;Good Eats&quot;.

==End of the first run==
On May 9, 2011, Brown announced via his Twitter that he was &quot;retiring&quot; the show after 249 episodes, and there would be three new one-hour episodes to be produced and premiered in 2011. The back catalog of shows were added to the repeat rotation of sister network Cooking Channel in the fall of 2011, and Brown announced that his contract with Food Network had expired and moved to Cooking Channel in 2011.

The crew of the show with their families were shown at the end of the first hour-long episodes (&quot;Right On Q&quot;) eating BBQ while Brown narrated that truly a BBQ is just an event meant to be shared with friends and family. In the special Thanksgiving episode of 2011, &quot;Reromancing the Bird,&quot; favorite characters of the show—sister Marsha, niece Marsha Jr., neighbor Chuck, the southerner Uncle Colonel Bob Boatwright, the food agent Sid, Frances Andersen portraying Uncle Bob&#x27;s nurse, and the Dungeon Master—reappeared for a last time as a final tribute to their contribution to the show. At the end of the final episode, for the first time in years, Brown did not finish the show with the line &quot;see you next time on Good Eats.&quot; Instead, he said, &quot;Stay dark, America,&quot; snapped his fingers, and the screen went dark.

The final episode of &quot;Good Eats&quot;, titled &quot;Turn on the Dark,&quot; was aired February 10, 2012. Brown announced via Facebook earlier that day at approximately 2:00 p.m. EST:

When asked about the end of the show on the August 29, 2012, episode of &quot;The Nerdist Podcast&quot;, Brown stated &quot;I&#x27;ve put &quot;Good Eats&quot; into cryogenic holding. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s gone. I didn&#x27;t shoot it in the head, I didn&#x27;t kill it, but after 13 solid years of production, I needed a break.&quot;

In an interview with Larry King, Brown said &quot;I crossed the 250-episode line, and I realized that I was tired. It was a very stressful show to make; it was completely scripted, we did between 300 and 600 pages of research. I can only do 22 a year, because they were very involved. We shot them like movies, single-camera I crossed that line, and I also kind of saw the writing on the wall, I think, which was that the era of the instructional or educational culinary show was frankly coming to an end in primetime. I think I saw that primetime food shows were going to go to competitions and reality. I would have rather put it out to pasture than be cancelled.&quot;

==&quot;Good Eats: The Return&quot; and &quot;Good Eats: Reloaded&quot;==
Brown addressed the future of &quot;Good Eats&quot; at the end of a video he posted to his official Facebook page on July 16, 2015. In response to fan questions, Brown replied: &quot;You want to see &quot;Good Eats&quot; again? Get in touch with the Food Network. Tell them you want it. Tell them I sent you.&quot;

On Alton&#x27;s 2016 book tour, he stated &quot;Good Eats&quot; will have a &quot;sequel,&quot; and it would be released the next year on the Internet.

On September 3, 2017, at the annual Dragon Con convention in Atlanta, Georgia, Alton Brown announced the successor of &quot;Good Eats&quot;. The new 30-minute show, then titled &quot;Good Eats: Return of the Eats&quot;, would air on the Food Network while additional content would be available online. Brown made the announcement while surrounded by several members of the production and on-air teams responsible for &quot;Good Eats&quot;, including Vickie Eng, Widdi Turner, and Lucky Yates. &quot;Return of the Eats&quot; was to debut in 2018, but was pushed back to 2019. On June 3, 2019, Brown announced via social media that the show, now titled &quot;Good Eats: The Return&quot;, would debut Sunday, August 25, at 10 pm ET. The first episode was, however, premiered early on Food Network&#x27;s official YouTube channel on August 21, 2019, before its television debut. The episode reached number one on the worldwide YouTube trending list within hours.

On October 15, 2018, Cooking Channel premiered a spin-off series, &quot;Good Eats: Reloaded&quot;, featuring Brown revisiting 13 past episodes of the series with new scenes and recipes reflecting advancements in techniques and knowledge since their original airings. The second season, spotlighting and re-working 13 more episodes, premiered on April 13, 2020.

On August 6, 2020, Brown announced on Facebook that a new season of &quot;Good Eats: The Return&quot; had begun production, with new episodes due out either in late 2020 or early 2021. This second season premiered as a Discovery+ exclusive in early 2021, but by June 2021 had started airing on Food Network alongside a special Alton-led &quot;Chopped&quot; tournament called &quot;Alton&#x27;s Maniacal Baskets&quot;. A special one-hour Halloween-themed episode, &quot;The House That Dripped Chocolate&quot;, aired on October 8, 2020. On July 13, 2021, the final episodes of &quot;Good Eats: The Return&quot; aired on Food Network; Brown commented on his Facebook page that these episodes would not only be the end of &quot;Good Eats: The Return&quot; but the conclusion of all &quot;Good Eats&quot; programming.

==Merchandise==

===Books===
American publishers Stewart, Tabori and Chang released three separate volumes compiling the bulk of recipes featured on the television show. All of the recipes were transcribed and updated by Alton Brown. The first book, &quot;Good Eats: The Early Years&quot; was released in October 2009 and featured an original cover art by illustrator Michael Koelsch. It covered the first 80 episodes. The second book, &quot;Good Eats 2: The Middle Years&quot; was released a year later in October 2010 and featured an original cover art by illustrator Jim Salvati depicting Brown in a James Bond spoof. It covered episodes 81 through 164 and was packaged with a bonus DVD. The third book, &quot;Good Eats 3: The Later Years&quot;, was released another year later in October 2011 and featured an original cover art by illustrator Michael Koelsch depicting Brown in an Indiana Jones spoof. It covered episodes 165 through 249.

In early 2011, the first two books were packaged into a boxed set titled &quot;Good Eats: Two-Volume Set - Episodes 1 Through 164&quot;. In October 2013, all three books were packaged into an updated boxed set titled &quot;Good Eats: Three-Volume Set - The Complete Episodes&quot;.

In June 2021, on an episode of his &quot;QQ&quot; online series, he said he was putting the finishing touches on the manuscript of what he called &quot;the fourth and final &quot;Good Eats&quot; book&quot;, which will presumably cover recipes from &quot;Turn on the Dark&quot; (the final original &quot;Good Eats&quot; episode which was not included in &quot;The Later Years&quot; for some reason) and both seasons of &quot;Good Eats: The Return&quot;.

<text>In Mahayana Buddhism, bodhicitta (&quot;aspiration to enlightenment&quot; or &quot;the thought of awakening&quot;) is the mind (citta) that is aimed at awakening (bodhi) through wisdom and compassion for the benefit of all sentient beings. 

Bodhicitta is the defining quality of the Mahayana bodhisattva (a being striving towards Buddhahood) and the act of giving rise to bodhicitta (&quot;bodhicittotpāda)&quot; is what makes a bodhisattva a bodhisattva. Bodhicitta is the generative cause of a bodhisattva&#x27;s eventual Buddhahood. The &quot;Daśabhūmika Sūtra&quot; explains that the arising of bodhicitta is the first step in the bodhisattva&#x27;s career. 

==Etymology==
Etymologically, the word is a combination of the Sanskrit words bodhi and citta. &quot;Bodhi&quot; means &quot;awakening&quot; or &quot;enlightenment&quot;. &quot;Citta&quot; derives from the Sanskrit root &quot;cit&quot;, and means &quot;that which is conscious&quot; (i.e., mind or consciousness). &quot;Bodhicitta&quot; may be translated as &quot;awakening mind&quot; or &quot;mind of enlightenment&quot;. It is also sometimes translated as &quot;the thought of enlightenment.&quot;

== Definition ==

=== Indian sources ===
The term bodhicitta is defined and explained in different ways by different Mahayana Buddhist sources. According to Paul Williams, the basic meaning of bodhicitta in Indian sources (such as Atisha&#x27;s &quot;Bodhipathapradipa&quot;) is the lofty motivation to &quot;strive to bring a complete end to all the sufferings of others along with their own suffering...This bodhicitta results from deep compassion (&quot;karuna&quot;) for the suffering of others.&quot;

According to the &quot;Bodhisattvabhumi&quot;, the bodhisattva who gives rise to bodhicitta thinks thus:

O may I obtain supreme and perfect Enlightenment, promote the good of all beings, and establish them in the final and complete nirvana and in the Buddha-knowledge! 

Thus, according to the &quot;Bodhisattvabhumi&quot;, bodhicitta has two objects of thought or themes (&quot;alambana&quot;): &quot;bodhi&quot; and the good of the living beings (&quot;sattv-ārtha&quot;). 

Similarly, in the Ornament of Realization (&quot;Abhisamayālaṁkāra&quot;), bodhicitta is defined as follows:

The arising of the mind [of awakening] is a desire for perfect, complete Bodhi, for the sake of others (Skt. cittotpādaḥ parārthāya samyaksambodhikāmatā) 

According to Indian sources, the bodhicitta aspiration provides incalculable merit (such as good rebirths, a weakening of the defilements, increased mindfulness and luck). Bodhicitta is what makes someone a Mahayana bodhisattva, a child of the Buddha. Thus, the Indian Buddhist author Shantideva (8th century) writes in his &quot;Bodhicaryavatara&quot;:

Those who long to transcend the hundreds of miseries of existence, who long to relieve creatures of their sorrows, who long to enjoy many hundreds of joys, must never abandon bodhicitta. When bodhicitta has arisen in him, a wretch, captive in the prison of existence, he is straightway hailed son of the Sugatas [the Buddhas], to be revered in the worlds of gods and men.

According to Paul Williams, &quot;bodhicitta&quot; in early Mahāyāna works was less well defined and meant a &quot;certain state of mind&quot; characteristic of a bodhisattva. 

The cultivation of bodhicitta plays a significant role in Mahāyāna liturgies, particularly in ceremonies where one takes the bodhisattva precepts. Within these texts, two distinct types of bodhicitta are identified. The first, known as &quot;conventional bodhicitta&quot; (samvrti), refers to the mental aspiration of a bodhisattva to attain enlightenment, as previously explained. The second, called &quot;ultimate bodhicitta&quot; (paramartha), denotes a mind that directly perceives either emptiness or the inherent enlightenment / buddha-nature within the mind itself.

Regarding the second aspect, some Mahayana sources discuss bodhicitta not as something that must be generated, but as something which is latent in all beings, something that is already there. This is linked to the idea of the inherently pure luminous mind (prakrtipariśuddhacitta). Thus, the &quot;Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi-sūtra&quot; states: “Knowing one’s own mind according to reality is BODHI, and bodhicitta is the innately pure mind that is originally existent.”

=== Modern definitions ===
According to the 14th Dalai Lama, bodhicitta is:

the aspiration to bring about the welfare of all sentient beings and to attain buddhahood for their sake - is really the distilled essence, the squeeze juice, of all the Buddha&#x27;s teachings, because ultimately, the Buddha&#x27;s intention is to lead all sentient beings to perfect enlightenment.

Some modern East Asian authors on Buddhism, such as D.T. Suzuki and M. Anesaki, define bodhicitta as an immanent inner awakening. For example, Anesaki writes that bodhicitta is &quot;the primordial essence of our mind, which in itself consists in the supreme bodhi.&quot;

According to Zoketsu Norman Fischer, bodhicitta is a spontaneous wish to attain enlightenment motivated by great compassion for all sentient beings, accompanied by a falling away of the attachment to the illusion of an inherently existing self.

Fischer adds that bodhicitta, along with the mind of great compassion (&quot;mahakaruna&quot;), motivates one to attain enlightenment Buddhahood, as quickly as possible and benefit infinite sentient beings through their emanations and other skillful means. Bodhicitta is a felt need to replace others&#x27; suffering with bliss. Since the ultimate end of suffering is nirvana, bodhicitta necessarily involves a motivation to help others to awaken (to find &quot;bodhi&quot;).
== Types and stages of bodhicitta ==

=== Indian sources ===
Indian Mahayana sources also developed different models which described different forms and levels of bodhicitta. 

According to the &quot;Bodhisattvabhumi,&quot; there are two main stages of the development of bodhicitta: 

* a kind of bodhicitta which can be lost
* the permanent kind of bodhicitta which cannot be lost and leads directly to enlightenment.

Furthermore, according to Shantideva (and other sources), there are two types of bodhicitta from a practical perspective:

* bodhicitta which is a wish or aspiration (Sanskrit: &quot;bodhipranidhicitta&quot; or &quot;pranidhicittotpada&quot;), this is when a bodhisattva makes a aspiration or &quot;bodhisattva vow&quot; (bodhisattva praṇidhāna) to become a Buddha for the sake of all beings. This is compared to making the decision to start on a journey.
* active bodhicitta (&quot;bodhiprasthanacitta&quot; or &quot;prasthanacittotpada&quot;) which consists of actually practicing the path in line with one&#x27;s intent, which like actually undertaking a journey
According to the &quot;Buddhāvataṃsaka Sūtra,&quot; there are also said to be three types of bodhicitta:

* herder bodhicitta, in which a bodhisattva strives to deliver beings to awakening first (like a herder lets all their sheep in the pen first)
* ferryman bodhicitta, in which they travel to and enter enlightenment together with the beings they are ferrying 
* king-like bodhicitta, in which the bodhisattva reaches awakening first, and then helps others to reach that goal

=== In Tibetan Buddhism ===
A common Tibetan Buddhist distinction is that between relative and absolute (or ultimate) bodhicitta. &quot;Relative bodhicitta&quot; is a state of mind in which the practitioner works for the good of all beings as if it were their own. &quot;Absolute bodhicitta&quot; is the wisdom of shunyata (śunyatā, a Sanskrit term often translated as &quot;emptiness&quot;, though the alternatives &quot;vast expanse&quot; or &quot;openness&quot; or &quot;spaciousness&quot; probably convey the idea better to Westerners).

In his book &quot;Words of My Perfect Teacher&quot;, the Tibetan Buddhist teacher Patrul Rinpoche describes the three degrees of bodhicitta as taught in the Avatamsaka Sutra, claiming that shepherd-like is best.

Some bodhicitta practices emphasize the absolute (e.g. vipaśyanā), while others emphasize the relative (e.g. metta), but both aspects are seen in all Mahāyāna practice as essential to enlightenment, especially in the Tibetan practices of tonglen and lojong. Without the absolute, the relative can degenerate into pity and sentimentality, whereas the absolute without the relative can lead to nihilism and lack of desire to engage other sentient beings for their benefit.

==Cultivation==
Mahāyāna Buddhist practice focuses on the Bodhisattva path, at this path begins with the arousing of bodhicitta. The arising of bodhicitta or the generation of it (as well as the mind generated in this process) is called &quot;bodhicittotpāda&quot; (Sanskrit; Chinese: 發菩提心, fa puti xin; Jp. hotsubodaishin; Tibetan: byang chub kyi sems bskyed pa), that is, the arising (&quot;utpāda&quot;) of bodhicitta.

Mahāyāna Buddhism teaches that the broader motivation of achieving one&#x27;s own enlightenment &quot;in order to help all sentient beings&quot; is the best possible motivation one can have for any action, whether it be working in one&#x27;s vocation, teaching others, or even making an incense offering. Thus, the bodhisattva&#x27;s Six Perfections (Pāramitās) of Buddhism only become true &quot;perfections&quot; when they are done with the motivation of bodhicitta. This means that any act, such as the action of giving (Skt. dāna) can be done in a mundane sense, or it can be a pāramitā if it is conjoined with bodhicitta. Bodhicitta is the primary positive factor to be cultivated.

===Practices===
The Mahāyāna tradition provides specific methods for the intentional cultivation of both absolute and relative bodhicitta. This cultivation is considered to be a fundamental aspect of the path to Buddhahood. Practitioners of the Mahāyāna make it their primary goal to develop genuine uncontrived bodhicitta, which remains within their mindstreams continuously without having to rely on conscious effort. This is assisted by numerous methods, contemplation, rituals and meditations, such as: relying on a spiritual friend, taking refuge in the three jewels, and contemplating the defects of samsara (cyclic existence), the benefits of arousing bodhicitta (as well as the downsides of abandoning it), and developing spiritual qualities such as faith (sraddha), mindfulness and wisdom (prajña).

Numerous Mahāyāna texts outline various causes and conditions that foster the development of &quot;bodhicitta&quot;. The &quot;Bodhisattvabhūmi&quot; identifies four primary conditions (&quot;adhipatipratyaya&quot;) for generating &quot;bodhicitta&quot;: 

# Witnessing an extraordinary miracle (&quot;ṛddhi-prātihārya&quot;) performed by a buddha or bodhisattva,
# Hearing teachings on enlightenment (&quot;bodhi&quot;) or doctrines directed at bodhisattvas (&quot;bodhisattva-piṭaka&quot;),
# Recognizing the potential extinction of the dharma and striving to preserve the true dharma (&quot;saddharma&quot;),
# Perceiving the suffering caused by afflictions (&quot;kleśa&quot;) in sentient beings and feeling compassion for them.
Another list is provided in Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on the Bodhisattva Vow&quot; (&quot;Fa putixinjing lun&quot;):

# Contemplating the buddhas, 
# Contemplating the inherent dangers (&quot;ādīnava&quot;) of the body, 
# Cultivating compassion (&quot;karuṇā&quot;) for sentient beings, 
# Aspiring for the supreme result or fruit (&quot;phala&quot;), i.e. Buddhahood

According to Ulrich Pagel, numerous Mahāyāna sūtras, like the &quot;Bodhisattvapiṭaka,&quot; see the arising of &quot;bodhicitta&quot; (&quot;bodhicittotpāda&quot;) as an ongoing process which must be constantly refurbished (rather than as a static event which only happens once). At the outset of his &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra&quot;, Candrakīrti likens compassion (&quot;karuṇā&quot;) to a seed, water, and crops, emphasizing its significance at every stage of the bodhisattva’s journey. Compassion is crucial at the beginning, as it initiates the bodhisattva’s path; in the middle, as it sustains the practitioner and prevents regression into the limited nirvāṇa of an arhat; and at the end, where it manifests as the ceaseless, spontaneous actions of a fully enlightened being for the benefit of others. &quot;Karuṇā&quot; is thus regarded as the root of &quot;bodhicitta&quot; because the arising and enduring presence of &quot;bodhicitta&quot; depend on the strength of &quot;mahākaruṇā&quot;, or profound empathy for the suffering of all beings. To cultivate bodhicitta then, it is important to cultivate compassion.

A common practice in various Mahāyāna Buddhist traditions is to recite bodhisattva vows and aspiration prayers or chants which help give rise to bodhicitta. One popular chant in India and presently throughout the Mahayana world is the &quot;Bhadracaripraṇidhāna&quot; (&quot;Vows of Good Conduct&quot;) or &quot;Ārya-samantabhadra-caryā-praṇidhāna-rāja&quot; (&quot;The Royal Vow to follow the Noble Course of Conduct of Samantabhadra&quot;), a verse aspiration prayer which appears at the end of some versions of the &quot;Avatamsaka sutra&quot;. This text, originally an independent set of verses, is cited in numerous sources and was known to figures like Bhavya, Śantideva, and Kamalaśīla.

One short prayer for bodhicitta which is very popular in Tibetan Buddhism was composed by the Indian paṇḍita Dīpaṁkaraśrījñāna (Atiśa): 

=== East Asian Buddhism ===
According to the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;, a key treatise in East Asian Buddhism, there are three forms of arising of bodhicitta: arising from faith, arising from understanding and practice, and arising from realization.

Jingying Huiyuan (523–592), in his &quot;Dasheng Yizhang&quot; (Compendium on the Purport of Mahāyāna), categorizes the generation of bodhicitta into three types:

# generation of the mind based on characteristics, where the bodhisattva, seeing the nature of &quot;saṃsāra&quot; and &quot;nirvāṇa&quot;, develops aversion to &quot;saṃsāra&quot; and strives for &quot;nirvāṇa&quot;; 
# generation of the mind beyond characteristics, where the bodhisattva understands the non-duality between &quot;saṃsāra&quot; and &quot;nirvāṇa&quot; and transcends the perception of their distinct qualities; 
# generation of the mind based on truth, where the bodhisattva recognizes the original nature of awakening as identical to their own mind and returns to their original mind.

In East Asian traditions, a common method of developing bodhicitta is by reciting Sramana Zhiyi&#x27;s four-fold bodhisattva vow formula, which is:

There is also a bodhicitta mantra which is recited in some traditions of Chinese esoteric Buddhism and Shingon. The Sanskrit mantra is:

Oṃ Bodhicittam Utpādayāmi (Om I aspire to develop the Awakened mind). 

=== Tibetan methods ===
Among the many methods for developing uncontrived bodhicitta given in Tibetan Mahāyāna teachings are:
* A. So as to arouse Bodhicitta, the main aspect, the Four Immeasurables (Brahmavihara) contemplation and practice:
** Immeasurable Loving-Kindness (Maitrī),
** Immeasurable Compassion (Karunā),
** Immeasurable Joy in the Good Fortune of Others (Muditā),
** Immeasurable Equanimity (Upekṣā) and
* B. So as to aspire Bodhicitta:
** The Lojong (&quot;mind training&quot;) practices:
*** Others as equal to self: Exchanging self and others: (Tonglen) the Sending and Receiving while breathing practice,
*** Others as more important: Viewing all other sentient beings as having been our mothers in infinite past lives, and feeling gratitude for the many occasions on which they have taken care of us.
* C. So as to apply Bodhicitta and achieve enlightenment:
** The repeated Pāramitās practice cycle: 1) Generosity, 2) Virtue, 3) Patience, 4) Effort, 5) Meditation, and 6) Insight.

In Lojong&#x27;s 59 slogans, Point Two: The main practice, which is training in absolute and relative bodhicitta.
: A. &quot;Absolute Bodhicitta&quot;
:Slogan 2. Regard all dharmas as dreams; although experiences may seem solid, they are passing memories.
:Slogan 3. Examine the nature of unborn awareness.
:Slogan 4. Self-liberate even the antidote.
:Slogan 5. Rest in the nature of alaya, the essence, the present moment.
:Slogan 6. In post-meditation, be a child of illusion.

: B.&quot;Relative Bodhicitta&quot;
:Slogan 7. Sending and taking should be practiced alternately. These two should ride the breath (aka. practice Tonglen).
:Slogan 8. Three objects, three poisons, three roots of virtue—the 3 objects are friends, enemies and neutrals. The 3 poisons are craving, aversion and indifference. The 3 roots of virtue are the remedies.
:Slogan 9. In all activities, train with slogans.
:Slogan 10. Begin the sequence of sending and taking with yourself.

When only realizing Śūnyatā, the practitioner might not benefit others, so the Mahayana path unites emptiness and compassion, this keeps from falling into the two limits and remaining on the middle way. Traditionally, Bodhisattvas practice meditative concentration at the beginning toward attaining the noble one&#x27;s wisdom level, then the main practice becomes benefiting others spontaneously, unlike other paths that might discontinue benefiting others.

All the conducive causes and auspicious conditions should be complete for bodhicitta to properly arise. After continued training, these qualities can arise in the mind without contrivance.

The two main traditions in taking the Bodhicitta vows are: 1) Nagarjuna&#x27;s profound view chariot and, 2) Asanga&#x27;s vast conduct chariot. After which this is guarded with what to avoid, and what to adopt.

The practice can be divided into three parts: 1) mind training, 2) arousing bodhicitta, and 3) training in what to adopt and what to avoid. These can be called the 1) preliminary practice, 2) main practice, and 3) concluding practice. The preliminary practice is training in the four boundless qualities. The main practice is arousing Bodhicitta and taking vows. The concluding practice is training in what to adopt and guarding without fail against what to avoid.

The Ancient Tibetan school preliminary practice cycle in the Samantabhadra to Longchenpa to Jigme Lingpa&#x27;s lineage of the Excellent Part to Omniscience: Vast Expanse Heart Essence. Invocation; Confession; Faith with Refuge: Mind Series Bodhichitta nature in the channels, inner air, and; Mandala of essence, nature, and compassion; Generation: Illusory perceptions like the moon reflecting in the water. Follow like Manjushree to dedicate with the aspiration to realize the innermost meaning and realize to attain Buddhahood as a spiritual warrior.

==== Two practice lineages ====
Tibetan Buddhists maintain that there are two main ways to cultivate Bodhichitta, the &quot;Seven Causes and Effects&quot; that originates from Maitreya and was taught by Atisha, and &quot;Exchanging Self and Others,&quot; taught by Shantideva and originally by Manjushri.

According to Tsongkhapa the seven causes and effects are thus:
#recognizing all beings as your mothers;
#recollecting their kindness;
#the wish to repay their kindness;
#love;
#great compassion;
#wholehearted resolve;
#bodhichitta.

According to Pabongka Rinpoche the second method consists of the following meditations:
#how self and others are equal;
#contemplating the many faults resulting from self-cherishing;
#contemplating the many good qualities resulting from cherishing others;
#the actual contemplation on the interchange of self and others;
#with these serving as the basis, the way to meditate on giving and taking (tonglen).

===Universality===
The practice and realization of bodhicitta are independent of sectarian considerations, since they are fundamentally a part of the human experience. Bodhisattvas are not only recognized in the Theravāda school of Buddhism, but in all other religious traditions and among those of no formal religious tradition. The present fourteenth Dalai Lama, for instance, regarded Mother Teresa as one of the greatest modern bodhisattvas.

<text>Sherman Alexander Hemsley (February 1, 1938 – July 24, 2012) was an American actor. He was known for his roles as George Jefferson on the CBS television series &quot;All in the Family&quot; (1973–1975; 1978) and &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; (1975–1985), Deacon Ernest Frye on the NBC series &quot;Amen&quot; (1986–1991), and B. P. Richfield on the ABC series &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;. Hemsley also played Judge Carl Robertson on the NBC series &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;. For his work on &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, Hemsley was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award. Hemsley also won an NAACP Image Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Comedy Series or Special (&quot;The Jeffersons&quot;) in 1982.

==Biography==
===Early life, education and service===
Hemsley was born and raised in South Philadelphia by his mother, who worked in a lamp factory. Hemsley did not meet his father until he was 14. Hemsley graduated from Barrat Middle School. For high school, Hemsley attended Central High School for ninth grade and Bok Technical High School for tenth. Hemsley dropped out of school after the tenth grade and joined the United States Air Force, where he served for four years.

On leaving the Air Force, Hemsley returned to Philadelphia, where he worked for the United States Postal Service during the day while attending the Academy of Dramatic Arts at night. He then moved to New York, continuing to work for the post office during the day while working as an actor at night. He starred as Gitlow in the early 1970s Broadway musical &quot;Purlie&quot;.

===Career===
====Stage====
 Hemsley performed with local groups in Philadelphia before moving to New York to study with Lloyd Richards at the Negro Ensemble Company. Shortly after, he joined Vinnette Carroll&#x27;s Urban Arts Company appearing in these productions: &quot;But Never Jam Today&quot;, &quot;The Lottery&quot;, &quot;Old Judge Mose is Dead&quot;, &quot;Moon on a Rainbow Shawl&quot;, &quot;Step Lively Boys&quot;, &quot;Croesus&quot;, and &quot;The Witch&quot;. Hemsley made his Broadway debut in &quot;Purlie&quot; and toured with the show for a year. In the summer of 1972, Hemsley joined the Vinnette Carroll musical &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother Me, I Can&#x27;t Cope&quot; ensemble in Toronto, followed a month later in the American Conservatory Theater production at the Geary Theater. In this production, Hemsley performed the solos &quot;Lookin&#x27; Over From Your Side&quot; in Act I and &quot;Sermon&quot; in Act II.

===Work with Norman Lear===
 While Hemsley was on Broadway with &quot;Purlie&quot;, Norman Lear called him in 1971 to play the recurring role of George Jefferson in his new sitcom, &quot;All in the Family&quot;. Hemsley was reluctant to leave his theatre role; Lear told him he would hold the role open for him (another actor, Mel Stewart, played his brother during this time). Hemsley joined the cast two years later. The characters of Hemsley and co-star Isabel Sanford were occasional supporting roles in &quot;All in the Family&quot;, then were given their own spin-off, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, in 1975. &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; proved to be one of Lear&#x27;s most successful series, enjoying a run of eleven seasons through 1985.

====1980s, 1990s, and 2000s====
Hemsley continued to work steadily after the show&#x27;s cancellation, largely typecast in George Jefferson-like roles. He teamed with the sitcom&#x27;s original cast members when &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; moved to Broadway for a brief run. Hemsley later joined the cast of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Amen&quot; in 1986 as Deacon Ernest Frye, a church deacon. The sitcom enjoyed a run of five seasons, ending in 1991. Hemsley then was a voice actor in the ABC live-action puppet series &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;, where he played Bradley P. Richfield, the boss of the main character, Earl. The series ran four seasons, ending in 1994. In 1995, Hemsley made four appearances in the sitcom &quot;Sister, Sister&quot; as Tia and Tamera Mowry&#x27;s grandfather. In 1996, he had the lead role in the TV comedy series &quot;Goode Behavior&quot;, which lasted for one season.

Hemsley then cut back on his acting career, although Isabel Sanford and he occasionally appeared together in the mid to late 1990s and in the early 2000s, reprising their popular roles in guest appearances on such television series as &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;; in commercials for The Gap, Old Navy, and Denny&#x27;s; and at dry cleaning conventions. He also starred with Sanford in a touring company of &quot;The Real Live Jeffersons&quot; stage show in the 1990s. Sanford and he made a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Sprung&quot; (1997). They continued to work together on occasion until Sanford&#x27;s health declined prior to her death in 2004. In 2001, Hemsley appeared as a contestant on the &quot;Celebrity Classic TV Edition&quot; special of ABC&#x27;s hit primetime quiz show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; and won $125,000 for his charity. Hemsley also made a voice appearance as himself in the Seth MacFarlane animated comedy &quot;Family Guy&quot; in 2005. He appeared in the film &quot;American Pie Presents: The Book of Love&quot; (2009). In 2011, he reprised his role as George Jefferson for the final time, alongside Marla Gibbs as Florence Johnston, on &quot;Tyler Perry&#x27;s House of Payne&quot;. Hemsley was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 2012.

===Music career===
In 1989, Hemsley, who had been a jazz keyboardist, released a single, &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Kick in the Head.&quot; This was followed in 1992 by &quot;Dance&quot;, an album of rhythm and blues music. He appeared on &quot;Soul Train&quot; around the time of the record&#x27;s release and also performed the song &quot;Eyes in the Dark&quot;. Hemsley also was an enthusiastic fan of many 1970s progressive rock bands, including Yes (which prompted a lengthy funk rock collaboration with Jon Anderson that remains unreleased as of 2024), Gentle Giant, Gong, and Nektar.

==Personal life==
Unlike the characters he played, Hemsley was a shy and intensely private man, described by some as reclusive. He avoided the Hollywood limelight and little of his personal life was public knowledge beyond the facts that he never married and he had no children. In 2003, however, Hemsley granted a rare video interview to the Archive of American Television. &quot;[Playing George Jefferson] was hard for me, but he was the character. I had to do it.&quot;

==Death==
Hemsley died at his home in El Paso, Texas on July 24, 2012, at age 74 due to superior vena cava syndrome, a complication associated with lung and bronchial carcinomas. He had a malignant mass in one of his lungs for which chemotherapy and radiation had been recommended, according to the El Paso County Texas Medical Examiner&#x27;s report.
===Aftermath===

On August 28, 2012, an El Paso news anchor interviewed Flora Isela Enchinton, the sole beneficiary of Hemsley&#x27;s will, who said that the two were friends and had been business partners for more than two decades. During this time she lived with Hemsley and his friend Kenny Johnston. Enchinton told the Associated Press that Hemsley never mentioned any relatives. &quot;Some people come out of the woodworkthey think Sherman, they think money&quot;, Enchinton told AP. &quot;But the fact is that I did not know Sherman when he was in the limelight. I met them when they [Hemsley and Johnston] came running from Los Angeles with not one penny, when there was nothing but struggle.&quot;

A Philadelphia man named Richard Thornton claimed to be Hemsley&#x27;s brother and the true heir to his estate. After contesting the will, Thornton halted progress on funeral arrangements, and as a result, Hemsley&#x27;s body remained at the San Jose Funeral Home in El Paso and unburied for months. On November 9, 2012, the legal battle over Hemsley&#x27;s body ended when Judge Patricia Chew ruled in favor of Enchinton. A military funeral was planned for Hemsley. He was interred at Fort Bliss National Cemetery in his adopted hometown of El Paso.

<doc id="654312" wikidata="Q736888" url="?curid=654312" title="Punta Umbría">
<text>Punta Umbría is a town and municipality in the province of Huelva, part of the Spanish autonomous community of Andalusia. It is a fishing village located on the banks of the Rio Odiel river and across the water from the capital, Huelva. It is surrounded by extensive salt marshes and faces Isla Saltes.

The &quot;Punta&quot; in its name comes from the long point going out to the sea from the beach. During World War II, it was the location where the body of a supposed British Major carrying false top secret documents was washed up. This was part of a disinformation exercise by the British secret service known as Operation Mincemeat.

The Odiel river meets the Atlantic Ocean at Punta Umbria Beach, a 3.8 km urban beach which has been awarded a Blue Flag for its high standards of cleanliness and excellent facilities.

<text>Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752 (2004), is a case argued in the Supreme Court of the United States on 21 April 2004. The question the case presented relates to Presidential foreign affairs and foreign trade actions exempt from environmental-review requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Air Act. Specifically, the question is whether those actions &quot;are&quot; subject to those requirements as a result of a rulemaking action concerning motor carrier safety by the federal agency with responsibility for that type of safety.

<text>Isabel Sanford (born Eloise Gwendolyn Sanford; August 29, 1917 – July 9, 2004) was an American stage, film, and television actress and comedian best known for her role as Louise &quot;Weezy&quot; Mills Jefferson on the CBS sitcoms &quot;All in the Family&quot; (1971–1975) and &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; (1975–1985). In 1981, she became the second African-American actress to win a Primetime Emmy Award after Gail Fisher and the first African-American actress to win for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

==Early life==
Sanford was born Eloise Gwendolyn Sanford on August 29, 1917, in Harlem, New York City, to Josephine (née Perry) and James Edward Sanford. She was the youngest of seven children and was the only child to survive beyond infancy. Sanford&#x27;s mother Josephine was devoutly religious and insisted that her daughter attend church every Sunday, and occasionally made her attend on weeknights. As a teenager, Sanford aspired to be an actress, but her mother discouraged her dream, as she felt that show business was &quot;the road to degradation.&quot; Sanford disobeyed her mother and began performing at local clubs. She also performed at amateur night at The Apollo Theater. After graduating high school, Sanford joined Harlem&#x27;s American Negro Theater and The Star Players. She made her professional stage debut in 1946 in &quot;On Strivers Row&quot;, and appeared in several off-Broadway productions while also working as a keypunch operator at IBM. In 1945, Sanford married house painter William Edward &quot;Sonny&quot; Richmond, with whom she had three children. Their marriage was tumultuous (a euphemism of the time for domestic violence), and they later separated.

==Career==
In 1960, Sanford withdrew money from her retirement fund, boarded a bus with her three children, left her husband in New York, and moved to Los Angeles. Soon after her arrival, she was asked to join the national production of &quot;Here Today&quot; by actress Tallulah Bankhead. In 1965, she made her Broadway debut in James Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;The Amen Corner&quot;. This role led to her being cast in the 1967 film &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;. In the film, she was credited as Isabell Sanford, playing the role of the maid &quot;Tillie Binks.&quot; Her performance was noted and earned good reviews, despite limited screen time. She caught the attention of major Hollywood players, including Norman Lear, who cast Sanford in the role of Louise Jefferson in &quot;All in the Family&quot;. Sanford and her TV husband Sherman Hemsley were so popular that Norman Lear decided to spin off the characters into their own weekly series &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;. Sanford was initially reluctant to commit to working on a weekly series, as she was already working steadily, but decided to accept the offer. &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; premiered in January 1975, and was an immediate hit with audiences, ultimately running for 11 seasons. For her role in the series, Sanford earned five Golden Globe Award nominations and seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations. She won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 1981, making her the first African-American actress to win in that category and remained the only African-American actress to do so until 2023-24 when Quinta Brunson achieved this feat for her role as Janine Teagues on &quot;Abbott Elementary&quot;.

After &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;&#x27; cancellation in 1985, Sanford continued her career with guest-starring roles in television and film. In January 1987, she starred in her own sitcom, &quot;Isabel&#x27;s Honeymoon Hotel&quot;, which aired five days a week in syndication. The series was created to showcase Sanford&#x27;s comedic skills, but it failed to attract an audience and was quickly cancelled. In the 1990s, Sanford mainly appeared in television guest appearances and cameo appearances in movies. She appeared on &quot;Dream On&quot;, &quot;Living Single&quot;, &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot;, &quot;In the House&quot;, &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot;, and &quot;Hearts Are Wild&quot;. In 1996, she played a supporting role in the action movie &quot;Original Gangstas&quot;, starring blaxploitation film stars Fred Williamson, Pam Grier, Jim Brown, and Richard Roundtree. Isabel Sanford appeared in Kojak Season 1 Episode 14 &quot;Die Before They Wake&quot; in 1974.

Sanford later reprised her role as Louise Jefferson in a touring company of &quot;The Real Live Jeffersons&quot; stage show in the mid-1990s alongside Sherman Hemsley. She and Hemsley also made a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Sprung&quot;, and guest-starred in &quot;The Parkers&quot;, &quot;Mafia!&quot;, and two episodes of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;. The two also appeared in a series of advertisements for Denny&#x27;s and Old Navy. In January 2004, Sanford received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contribution to the television industry. She made her final television appearance the following month as an animated version of herself in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Milhouse Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore.&quot;

==Personal life==
Sanford married house painter William Edward &quot;Sonny&quot; Richmond in 1945. The couple had three children—two sons (Sanford K. Richmond and Eric Richmond) and a daughter (Pamela Richmond Ruff) before separating in 1960. Following the separation, Sanford and the children moved to Los Angeles. Richmond remained in New York and died later that same year.

==Death==
In September 2003, Sanford underwent preventive surgery on her carotid artery. In the ensuing months, her health steadily declined. She was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on July 4, 2004, where she died five days later at the age of 86. Her publicist attributed it to unspecified natural causes. She was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles. For her contribution to the television industry, Isabel Sanford has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7080 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>James Henry Brady (June 12, 1862 – January 13, 1918) was an American Republican politician from the U.S. state of Idaho. He served as the state&#x27;s eighth governor from 1909 to 1911 and a United States senator for nearly five years, from 1913 until his death.

==Early years==
Born in Indiana County, Pennsylvania, at age three, Brady moved with his parents to Johnson County, Kansas. He was educated in public schools, and graduated from Leavenworth Normal College in Kansas.

Brady taught school, worked in the real estate business, and as editor of a newspaper. He moved to Idaho in 1895 at age thirty-three, and became successful in the water power and irrigation industries.

==Political career==
Brady was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1900, and chairman of the Idaho Republican Party in 1904 and 1908. He was named a delegate to the Republican National Committee again in 1908 and 1916.

Elected governor in 1908, Brady lost his bid for re-election in 1910, and returned to the private sector until he was elected to the U.S. Senate in January 1913, chosen by the Idaho Legislature to replace Kirtland Perky, who was appointed after Weldon Heyburn&#x27;s death in October 1912. In 1914, Brady became the first elected to the Senate from Idaho by direct popular vote, defeating former Democratic governor James H. Hawley and a handful of minor party candidates. Idaho&#x27;s senior senator, William Borah, went before the voters for the first time four years later in 1918, and was easily re-elected to a third term.

While in office, Brady suffered a heart attack, and died two weeks later in Washington, D.C., on January 13, 1918. He was cremated and his ashes deposited in the James H. Brady Memorial Chapel of Mountain View Cemetery in Pocatello.

==Legacy==
Brady&#x27;s great-grandson, Jerry Brady, was the 2002 and 2006 Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Idaho.

<text>Mount Wutai, also known by its Chinese name Wutaishan and as is a sacred Buddhist site at the headwaters of the Qingshui in Shanxi Province, China. Its central area is surrounded by a cluster of flat-topped peaks or mesas roughly corresponding to the cardinal directions. The north peak (Beitai Ding or Yedou Feng) is the highest ( from sea) and is also the highest point in North China.

As host to over 53 sacred monasteries, Mount Wutai is home to many of China&#x27;s most important monasteries and temples. It was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2009 and named a AAAAA tourist attraction by China&#x27;s National Tourism Administration in 2007.

==Significance==
Mount Wutai is one of the Four Sacred Mountains in Chinese Buddhism. Each of the mountains is viewed as the bodhimaṇḍa () of one of the four great bodhisattvas. Wǔtái is the home of the Bodhisattva of wisdom, Mañjuśrī or &quot;&quot; () in Chinese. Mañjuśrī has been associated with Mount Wutai since ancient times. Paul Williams writes:

Wutai was the first of the mountains to be identified and is often referred to as &quot;first among the four great mountains&quot;. It was identified on the basis of a passage in the &quot;Avataṃsaka Sūtra&quot;, which describes the abodes of many bodhisattvas. In this chapter, Mañjuśrī is said to reside on a &quot;clear cold mountain&quot; in the northeast. This served as charter for the mountain&#x27;s identity and its alternate name &quot;Clear Cool Mountain&quot; ().

The bodhisattva is believed to frequently appear on the mountain, taking the form of ordinary pilgrims, monks, or most often unusual five-colored clouds.

Reflecting regional rivalries between Buddhist centers, 9th-century Chan Buddhism master Linji Yixuan criticized the prominence of Wutai in Tang dynasty China. According to the posthumously compiled &quot;Línjì yǔlù&quot;, Linji Yixuan once said, “There‘s a bunch of students who seek Mañjuśrī on Mount Wutai. Wrong from the start! There‘s no Mañjuśrī on Mount Wutai.” His campaign was however not successful, and even after the Tang era Mount Wutai “continued to thrive as perhaps the single most famous Buddhist sacred site in China.”

Mount Wutai has an enduring relationship with Tibetan Buddhism. It was historically sacred to Taoist pilgrims on the Silk Road in the 10th century as well.

Mount Wutai is home to some of the oldest wooden buildings in China that have survived since the era of the Tang dynasty (618–907). This includes the main hall of Nanchan Temple and the East Hall of Foguang Temple, built in 782 and 857, respectively. They were discovered in 1937 and 1938 by a team of architectural historians including the prominent early 20th-century historian Liang Sicheng. The architectural designs of these buildings have since been studied by leading sinologists and experts in traditional Chinese architecture, such as Nancy Steinhardt. Steinhardt classified these buildings according to the hall types featured in the &quot;Yingzao Fashi&quot; Chinese building manual written in the 12th century.

In 2008, there were complaints from local residents that, in preparation for Mount Wutai&#x27;s bid to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site, they were forced from their homes and relocated away from their livelihoods.

==Major temples==
Nanchan Temple () is a large Zen temple in Mount Wǔtái, first built in the Yuan dynasty. The whole temple comprises seven terraces, divided into three parts. The lower three terraces are named Jile Temple (); the middle terrace is called Shande Hall (); the upper three terraces are named Youguo Temple (). Other major temples include Xiantong Temple, Tayuan Temple and Pusading Temple.

Other important temples inside Mount Wutai include Shouning Temple, Bishan Temple, Puhua Temple, Dailuo Ding, Qixian Temple, Shifang Tang, Shuxiang Temple, Guangzong Temple, Youguo Temple, Guanyin Dong, Longhua Temple, Luomuhou Temple, Jinge Temple, Zhanshan Temple, Wanfo Ge, Guanhai Temple, Zhulin Temple, Jifu Temple, Jihe Temple, and Gufo Temple.

Outer Mount Wutai temples include Yanqing Temple, Nanchan Temple, Mimi Temple, Foguang Temple, Yanshan Temple, Zunsheng Temple, and Guangji Temple. A giant statue of Maha Manjushree was presented to the Buddhists of China by foreign minister of Nepal Ramesh Nath Pandey in 2005.

==Transportation==
The Wutaishan Airport in nearby Dingxiang County opened in December 2015.

== Honors ==
In April 2020, it was selected into the &quot;2020 World Famous Summer Mountains List&quot;.

In April 2020, it was selected into the &quot;2020 China&#x27;s Famous Summer Mountains List&quot;.

In September 2022, the planation surface of Mount Wutai was selected into the list of the most beautiful geological relics in Shanxi Province.

== Climate ==

<text>A hoard or &quot;wealth deposit&quot; is an archaeological term for a collection of valuable objects or artifacts, sometimes purposely buried in the ground, in which case it is sometimes also known as a cache. This would usually be with the intention of later recovery by the hoarder; hoarders sometimes died or were unable to return for other reasons (forgetfulness or physical displacement from its location) before retrieving the hoard, and these surviving hoards might then be uncovered much later by metal detector hobbyists, members of the public, and archaeologists.

Hoards provide a useful method of providing dates for artifacts through association as they can usually be assumed to be contemporary (or at least assembled during a decade or two), and therefore used in creating chronologies. Hoards can also be considered an indicator of the relative degree of unrest in ancient societies. Thus conditions in 5th and 6th century Britain spurred the burial of hoards, of which the most famous are the Hoxne Hoard, Suffolk; the Mildenhall Treasure, the Fishpool Hoard, Nottinghamshire, the Water Newton hoard, Cambridgeshire, and the Cuerdale Hoard, Lancashire, all preserved in the British Museum. 

Prudence Harper of the Metropolitan Museum of Art voiced some practical reservations about hoards at the time of the Soviet exhibition of Scythian gold in New York City in 1975. Writing of the so-called &quot;Maikop treasure&quot; (acquired from three separate sources by three museums early in the twentieth century, the Berliner Museen, the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, and the Metropolitan Museum, New York), Harper warned:
Such &quot;dealer&#x27;s hoards&quot; can be highly misleading, but better understanding of archaeology amongst collectors, museums and the general public is gradually making them less common and more easily identified.

== Classification ==

Hoards may be of precious metals, coinage, tools or less commonly, pottery or glass vessels. There are various classifications depending on the nature of the hoard:

A founder&#x27;s hoard contains broken or unfit metal objects, ingots, casting waste, and often complete objects, in a finished state. These were probably buried with the intention to be recovered at a later time.

A merchant&#x27;s hoard is a collection of various functional items which, it is conjectured, were buried by a traveling merchant for safety, with the intention of later retrieval.

A personal hoard is a collection of personal objects buried for safety in times of unrest.

A hoard of loot is a buried collection of spoils from raiding and is more in keeping with the popular idea of &quot;buried treasure&quot;.

Votive hoards are different from the above in that they are often taken to represent permanent abandonment, in the form of &quot;purposeful deposition&quot; of items, either all at once or over time for ritual purposes, &quot;without intent to recover them&quot;. Furthermore, votive hoards need not be &quot;manufactured&quot; goods, but can include organic amulets and animal remains. Votive hoards are often distinguished from more functional deposits by the nature of the goods themselves (from animal bones to diminutive artifacts), the places buried (being often associated with watery places, burial mounds and boundaries), and the treatment of the deposit (careful or haphazard placement and whether ritually destroyed/broken).

Valuables dedicated to the use of a deity (and thus classifiable as &quot;votive&quot;) were not always permanently abandoned. Valuable objects given to a temple or church become the property of that institution, and may be used to its benefit.

<doc id="654349" wikidata="Q2342896" url="?curid=654349" title="Kenzo Suzuki">
<text>is a Japanese professional wrestler. He is perhaps best known for his appearances with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), in Mexico with Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) and in the United States with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), where he was a one-time WWE Tag Team Champion in the latter company. He currently performs for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) under the ring name Kenso, where he is a one-time World Tag Team Champion and a one-time Gaora TV Champion.

==Early career==
Suzuki was a rugby union player, playing at the international level for Japan prior to his professional debut as a wrestler in January 2000.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (2000–2003)===
Suzuki debuted on January 4, 2000, at New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW)&#x27;s Wrestling World 2000 event at the Tokyo Dome, losing to Manabu Nakanishi. Later that year, Suzuki won NJPW&#x27;s Young Lion Cup tournament, defeating Shinya Makabe. He also won Rookie of the Year honors from NJPW in the same year. Following this, he would go on to win the Young Lion Tournament after defeating Hiroshi Tanahashi in the finals, later forming a tag team with Tanahashi known as The Kings of the Hills.

In 2003, Suzuki resigned from NJPW, choosing to follow his mentor and trainer, Riki Choshu, to Choshu&#x27;s World Japan promotion. Later in the year, he left to wrestle in the United States. It is speculated that he was forced to resign because a wrestler he was helping to train, Giant Ochiai, died while training on his watch. As a result, this led to Suzuki venturing to the United States&#x27; independent circuit, where he worked for the Major League Wrestling (MLW) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotions during 2003 before ultimately quitting World Japan, citing a lack of competition within the latter promotion.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2004–2005)===
In 2004, Suzuki signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and was assigned to their developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in February. Originally, Suzuki was scheduled to debut on the Raw brand in May under the ring name &quot;Hirohito&quot;. He was to be presented as the grandson of Emperor Michi Hirohito, who ruled Japan during World War II. He would portray a Japanese patriot, holding anti-American views and wanting revenge on America for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, the gimmick was dropped after the first vignette aired on the April 19, 2004 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;. Suzuki and his wife, Hiroko, reportedly told Vince McMahon directly that it would be extremely offensive in Japan and cause big problems for the company doing future business there. Suzuki also told Bruce Prichard that Emperor Hirohito was not as beloved in Japan as they thought. 

Suzuki and Hiroko were instead moved to the SmackDown! brand. Suzuki used his given name and Hiroko was used as his geisha valet. Their real-life marriage was not mentioned on television. Together, they made their television debut on the June 10 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, where Suzuki defeated Scotty 2 Hotty. Suzuki then began a short feud with Billy Gunn, which ended with Suzuki defeating Gunn at The Great American Bash. On the July 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Suzuki, René Duprée, and Booker T defeated John Cena in a 3-on-1 elimination match. on the July 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Suzuki competed in an 8-man elimination match for the vacant United States Championship, which was won by Booker T. On the September 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Suzuki, Duprée and Booker T lost to Cena, Rob Van Dam and Rey Mysterio.

On the September 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Suzuki and Duprée defeated Paul London and Billy Kidman to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. During the title reign, Suzuki adopted a comedic pro-American gimmick that saw him poorly sing popular songs. At No Mercy, Suzuki and Duprée successfully defended their titles against Rob Van Dam and Rey Mysterio. After continued weeks of feuding, Suzuki and Duprée lost the titles to Van Dam and Mysterio on the December 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. They failed to regain the titles in a rematch at Armageddon.

Suzuki entered a feud with John Cena over the United States Championship. On the January 6, 2005, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Suzuki challenged United States Champion John Cena to a battle rap. He then challenged Cena for the championship on the January 13 and January 27 episodes of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, but was unsuccessful in both attempts.

Suzuki entered the Royal Rumble match as the sixth entrant, but was eliminated by Rey Mysterio. His final WWE match came on the February 26 episode of &quot;Velocity&quot; where he lost to Booker T. In the following months, Suzuki suffered a collapsed lung. He returned to Ohio Valley Wrestling to continue his recovery. Suzuki and Hiroko were traded to Raw during the 2005 Draft Lottery. However, the pair were released from their contracts on July 6, 2005, before ever making an appearance on the brand.

===Hustle and Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (2005–2006)===
After leaving WWE, Suzuki returned to Japan, where he began performing for Hustle and wrestled in a number of humorous matches against the likes of Liosazer and Razor Ramon HG. In addition to Hustle, Suzuki also began performing for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) alongside fellow WWE alumnus Mark Jindrak, who began performing as Marco Corleone. Together, they were put into a feud with Shocker and Universo 2000, which led to Suzuki and Corleone losing a hair vs. hair match on June 12 and thus being forced to have their heads shaved. Following this, Suzuki was used sparingly before eventually leaving CMLL.

===AAA (2007–2010, 2015)===
On March 13, Suzuki was seen on AAA after jumping from the rival CMLL. He is a part of the Legion Extranjera with Konnan as the ring leader. On July 7, Suzuki lost his hair in the main event of AAA&#x27;s Triplemanía XV. Sean Waltman was also in the match with his fiancee, Alicia Webb. Suzuki has been an active member of Konnan&#x27;s Legion Extranjera since his debut and he had an opportunity for the AAA Mega Championship against Cibernético. He has teamed up with the returning Electroshock who is also a member of the Legion Extranjera. They have feuded with La Parka and Octagón. As of Triplemania XVI he has received a mini who accompanied him to the ring for a six-man tag match teaming with Electroshock and Bobby Lashley to take on Chessman, La Parka, and the returning Silver King. Suzuki&#x27;s team won in the end. Suzuki was part of the 2009 Rey de Reyes, losing to La Parka on March 15.

After Triplemania XVII, Konnan&#x27;s Legion Extranjera lost control of AAA; Konnan was suspended from Mexican wrestling for an indefinite time. At this time Legion Extranjera was dissolved leaving only Electroshock, Chessman, and Suzuki. Suzuki made an alliance with El Oriental and they formed their own team with Sugi San getting victories in their debut. They would lose to the Psycho Circus at Verano de Escandalo. In December 2009, Suzuki re-joined La Legión Extranjera before leaving the promotion in mid-2010.

Suzuki returned to AAA on May 24, 2015, when he, Masamune and Tiger Mask III formed a trio for the Lucha Libre World Cup. They were defeated in the first round of the tournament by Team MexLeyendas (Blue Demon Jr., Dr. Wagner Jr. and El Solar).

===Dragon Gate (2007)===
On November 7, 2007, Suzuki made his debut in Dragon Gate as the surprise member of the Muscle Outlaw&#x27;z unit. He came out to Anthony W. Mori&#x27;s entrance theme to trick the Typhoon unit into believing one of their own betrayed them. Suzuki competed in a six-man tag team match with new teammates Genki Horiguchi and Yasushi Kanda against Cima, Dragon Kid, and Ryo Saito that resulted in a disqualification loss for his team after assaulting the referee. Afterward, he and the rest of the MO&#x27;z assaulted Dragon Kid and removed the ring ropes to be used against him. This set up a match between Suzuki and Dragon Kid at the big November 25 show in Osaka. He faced on November 18 Kenichiro Arai in Fukuoka in his first match for the promotion.

===All Japan Pro Wrestling (2010–present)===

On July 25, 2010, Suzuki, disguised under a La Parka mask, made his debut for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), helping the Voodoo Murders put Keiji Mutoh through a table. Afterwards, Suzuki unmasked himself, adopted the ring name Kenso and joined the heel group, which also included his former tag team partner René Duprée. On November 20, 2010, Kenso entered the World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League, teaming with fellow Voodoo Murders member Kono. After winning six out of their eight round robin stage matches, Kenso and Kono finished first in the group and on December 7 defeated Ryota Hama and Suwama in the finals to win the 2010 World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League. Kenso and Kono received their shot at the World Tag Team Championship on January 3, 2011, but were defeated by the defending champions, Akebono and Taiyō Kea. Shortly afterwards Kenso left the Voodoo Murders, turning face and on February 13, 2011, defeated Kono and Akebono in a three-way match to become the number one contender to the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, held by Suwama. On March 21 Kenso failed in his challenge for the AJPW Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. On June 19, Kenso and The Great Muta defeated Akebono and Ryota Hama to win the vacant World Tag Team Championship. After losing the title to Dark Cuervo and Dark Ozz on October 23, Muta turned on Kenso. The turn was part of a storyline, where other AJPW wrestlers did not take Kenso seriously and refused to team with him as part of his Kenso Kakumei (&quot;Kenso Revolution&quot;) stable. After failed attempts to form new partnerships with Kaz Hayashi and Great Sasuke, Kenso announced on November 18, 2013, that he had decided to join Go Shiozaki&#x27;s new Xceed stable. However, in the two&#x27;s first match together three days later, Kenso turned on Shiozaki and announced he was forming a new heel stable named Dark Kingdom (DK) with foreigners Bambi Killer and D&#x27;Lo Brown. On April 23, 2014, Kenso introduced AJPW outsiders Bear Fukuda, Kengo Mashimo, Kenichiro Arai, Mitsuya Nagai and Takeshi Minamino as the newest members of DK, proclaiming this the &quot;real beginning&quot; of the stable. On December 14, Kenso won his first singles title in AJPW, when he defeated Kotaro Suzuki for the Gaora TV Championship. He lost the title to Sushi in his fourth defense on June 4, 2015. On July 31, it was announced that Kenso would begin freelancing following the expiration of his AJPW contract. He would, however, continue working for AJPW as a freelancer.

<text>Andrea Jane Corr (born 17 May 1974) is an Irish musician and actress. Corr debuted in 1990 as the lead singer of the Celtic folk rock and pop rock group The Corrs along with her three elder siblings Caroline, Sharon and Jim. Aside from singing lead vocals, Corr plays the tin whistle, the mandolin, the ukulele and the piano.

With the others, Corr has released seven studio albums, two compilation albums, one remix album and two live albums. Corr has also pursued a solo career, releasing her debut album, &quot;Ten Feet High&quot;, in 2007. The album moved away from the sound of the Corrs and features a dance-pop sound. Her next album, released on 30 May 2011, was entirely made up of covers of songs that were important to her when younger.

Corr is involved in charitable activities. She has played charity concerts to raise money for the Pavarotti &amp; Friends Liberian Children&#x27;s Village, Freeman Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, the victims of the Omagh bombing in Northern Ireland and The Prince&#x27;s Trust in 2004. She is an ambassador for the Nelson Mandela&#x27;s &quot;46664&quot; campaign, raising awareness towards AIDS in Africa. During the Edinburgh Live 8 on 2 July 2005 The Corrs performed &quot;When the Stars Go Blue&quot; alongside Bono to promote the Make Poverty History campaign. Along with her siblings, she was appointed an honorary M.B.E. in 2005 by Queen Elizabeth II for her contribution to music and charity.

==Early years==
Andrea Corr was born to Gerry Corr, a supervisor of a payroll unit of the Irish Electricity Supply Board (the E.S.B.), and his wife, Jean, a housewife. She is the youngest of the five Corr children. Older brother Gerard was killed when he was only three years old in a road accident before she and her sister Caroline were born. Andrea discussed the devastating death with Ryan Tubridy on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; aired by RTÉ Entertainment.

The family was raised in Dundalk, Ireland. Gerry and Jean had their own band, Sound Affair, which played songs by ABBA and The Eagles in local pubs in Dundalk where they would often bring along their children.

With the encouragement of her parents, Andrea took up the tin whistle and was taught the piano by her father. Throughout their teenage years, she and her siblings would often practice in Jim&#x27;s bedroom at a house he had rented. Andrea sang lead vocals, Sharon played the violin and both Caroline and Jim played keyboards. Andrea took part in school plays at her school, Dundalk&#x27;s Dun Lughaidh Convent.

==Career==
===The Corrs===

In 1990, Corr and her siblings formed a quartet called The Corrs. Their career launched in 1991 when they auditioned for the film &quot;The Commitments&quot; in which Andrea gained a speaking role as Sharon Rabbitte. John Hughes noticed the quartet when they auditioned for the movie, and agreed to become their manager. The Corrs signed with Atlantic Records in 1995 and travelled to North America to record their debut album &quot;Forgiven, Not Forgotten&quot;. The album featured six instrumental selections among its Celtic-influenced tracks. When released, it was successful in Ireland, Australia, Japan, and Spain. The album reached platinum status in the United Kingdom and Australia, and quadruple platinum in Ireland, which made it one of the most popular debuts by an Irish group.

Following on from the success of their debut album, they released &quot;Talk on Corners&quot; and &quot;In Blue&quot; in 1997 and 2000 respectively. Originally &quot;Talk on Corners&quot; met with lukewarm success, until a remix version was released, when it topped the charts in many countries, and reached platinum status in the United Kingdom and Australia. &quot;In Blue&quot; moved towards mainstream pop, placing heavy emphasis on electronic synthesisers. It was successful, and was No. 1 in its first sales week in the UK, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria and debuted at No. 2 in France and Norway. It climbed to the top position during its second week in Sweden and Spain.

During the production of &quot;In Blue&quot;, their mother, Jean, died while waiting for a lung transplant in the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, UK. She was laid to rest at St. Patrick&#x27;s cemetery in Dundalk. Bono, Larry Mullen, Brian Kennedy and Paul Brady were among the attendees. &quot;No More Cry&quot;, written by Andrea and Caroline Corr for the album, was dedicated to their father hoping to help with his grief.

In 2003, Andrea recorded &quot;Time Enough For Tears&quot;, a song written by Bono and Gavin Friday for the film &quot;In America&quot;. This track was featured on The Corrs&#x27; 2004 album &quot;Borrowed Heaven&quot;. &quot;Borrowed Heaven&quot; was dedicated to their late mother, Jean, and their father, Gerry. The band also dedicated their 2005 tribute album &quot;Home&quot; to their deceased mother. The band covered many traditional Irish songs taken from their mother&#x27;s songbook to commemorate their 15 years as a band.

In an interview with Chris Evans in June 2015, Andrea confirmed that The Corrs were working on a new album and would play the BBC Radio 2 &#x27;Live in Hyde Park&#x27; festival. Their sixth studio album, &quot;White Light&quot;, was released on 27 November 2015, and was accompanied by a world tour.

In 2017 they released their latest album to date Jupiter Calling, produced by T-Bone Burnett.

===Solo career===
While her siblings were on hiatus to raise their families, Andrea launched a solo career. She released her first album, &quot;Ten Feet High&quot;, on 25 June 2007. It was produced by Nellee Hooper, who has worked with Gwen Stefani and Madonna; Bono was an executive producer. Her first single, &quot;Shame on You&quot; was an up-tempo pop song about men and women going to war and leaving behind partners they may never see again. It received positive reviews from music critics; IndieLondon described the song as a &quot;slick package&quot; that was &quot;polished, well produced and with a message that&#x27;s difficult to ignore&quot;. &quot;Losing Today&quot;&#x27;s David Adair gave the song a strong review, writing that Corr&#x27;s vocals were &quot;crisp and uplifting&quot;. Liverpool&#x27;s &quot;Daily Post&quot; gave the song a three-star rating, commenting that it was &quot;deceptively upbeat&quot;, which masked its &quot;heavier message about conscription and war&quot;.

In 2011 she released her second solo album &quot;Lifelines&quot;. This album contains covers of song by the likes John Lennon, Donna Summer, The Velvet Underground and more.

In 2020 she released an EP called &quot;Christmas Songs&quot;.
The EP contains 4 classical Christmas songs and one original song titled Begin Again.

In 2025, Corr participated in the sixth series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Snail&quot;. She was eliminated in the sixth episode alongside Grayson Perry as &quot;Kingfisher&quot;.

===Acting===
Andrea Corr entered the film industry in 1991 with Alan Parker&#x27;s film &quot;The Commitments&quot;, in which she had a speaking part as Sharon Rabbitte. In 1996, Parker was directing the film version of the rock opera &quot;Evita&quot; which starred Madonna. He was so keen on having Andrea in the film that he cast her as Juan Peron&#x27;s mistress, where she performed part of &quot;Hello and Goodbye&quot;. Corr provided the singing voice for Kayley, opposite Bryan White (Garrett) in Warner Brothers&#x27; first fully animated film, 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Quest for Camelot&quot;.

Corr resumed her acting career in 2003 where she was cast as Anne in &quot;The Boys from County Clare&quot;. The film was not a commercial success, but she won the &quot;Film Discovery Jury Award&quot; for Best Actress in the US Comedy Arts Festival and was nominated for Best Actress in the IFTA Awards. During the Corrs&#x27; hiatus she was featured in the 2005 film &quot;The Bridge&quot; and the 2006 film &quot;Broken Thread&quot;. Corr appeared as Christina in the play &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot; staged at The Old Vic theatre in London from February until May 2009 .

She played the title role in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; by Alan Stanford at the Gate Theatre in Dublin which opened on 9 November 2010.

=== Book ===

In 2018 she wrote and released a book, titled &quot;Barefoot Pilgrimage&quot;. In this she writes about her youth, the warmth of her family, and about The Corrs.

==Charitable activities==
Andrea Corr and her siblings have played charity concerts to raise money for the Pavarotti &amp; Friends Liberian Children&#x27;s Village, Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, the victims of the Omagh bombing in Northern Ireland, and The Prince&#x27;s Trust in 2004. They are also ambassadors for the Nelson Mandela&#x27;s &quot;46664&quot; campaign, where they performed live to raise awareness towards AIDS in Africa. During the Edinburgh Live 8 on 2 July 2005 The Corrs performed &quot;When the Stars Go Blue&quot; alongside Bono to promote the Make Poverty History campaign. In recognition for their charity performances, The Corrs were made Honorary Members of the Order of the British Empire in 2005 by Queen Elizabeth II.

Corr also partook in a tribute single to the late member of The Dubliners, Ronnie Drew, called &quot;The Ballad of Ronnie Drew.&quot; The song was released on 19 February 2008 and was performed by a number of famous Irish musicians. This included members of U2, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Christy Dignam of Aslan, Robert Hunter of the Grateful Dead, who wrote the song, Kíla, Christy Moore, Moya Brennan, Shane MacGowan, Bob Geldof, Damien Dempsey, Gavin Friday, Iona Green, Jerry Fish, Paul Brady, Paddy Casey, Mick Pyro, Mundy, Chris de Burgh, Ronan Keating, Jack L, Eleanor Shanley, Mary Black, Declan O&#x27;Rourke, Mary Coughlan, Joe Elliott of Def Leppard, The Dubliners themselves and The Chieftains.
The single was written to originally include Ronnie himself but was changed to be a tribute to him as his health was declining. Proceeds from sale of the single went to The Irish Cancer Society at the request of Drew himself. The song was performed live on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; aired by RTÉ Entertainment on 22 February with Ronnie Drew in attendance as an audience member, and entered the Irish Single Charts at No. 2.

On 10 October 2010, Corr, amongst others, contributed to the Kirsty MacColl tribute concert held at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire to commemorate MacColl&#x27;s birthday and raise money for charity. She also wrote and sang the song &quot;Oh Brother&quot; on the album &quot;Music of Ireland – Welcome Home&quot;.

On 30 November 2012, Corr lent her support to Kate Winslet&#x27;s Golden Hat Foundation together with Tim Janis, Sarah McLachlan, Loreena McKennitt, Hayley Westenra, performing on &quot;The American Christmas Carol&quot; concert in Carnegie Hall.

<text>Caroline Georgina Corr (born 17 March 1973) is an Irish singer and drummer for the Celtic folk rock band the Corrs. In addition to the drums, she plays the &quot;bodhrán&quot;, &quot;cajón&quot;, percussions and piano.

The Corr siblings were appointed honorary MBEs in 2005, in recognition of their music and charitable work, which has raised money for the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne, victims of the Omagh Bombing and other charities.

== Early life ==
Corr was born on 17 March, 1973 (Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day) in Dundalk, Ireland, to Jean and Gerry Corr. Corr has four siblings: an older sister Sharon Corr, older brother Jim Corr and a younger sister Andrea Corr. Their older brother Gerard was killed when he was three years old in a road accident before she and her sister Andrea were born. Caroline was brought up in a Catholic household and was sent to the same school, Dun Lughaidh Convent, as her sisters.

Her parents played ballads and folk tunes in local bands, and formed their own band called &quot;Sound Affair&quot;. Jean sang and Gerry played the keyboards and they performed covers of songs by various famous bands. Caroline and her siblings were exposed to music from a very young age, and travelled with Jean and Gerry to gigs in the family car.

Caroline was taught the piano by her father Gerry at a very early age like her other siblings. She also learnt the bodhrán by watching videos of traditional Irish musicians playing it. The violin was originally intended for Caroline to play but she showed no interest and instead Sharon took up the violin lessons. Caroline learned how to play the drums with the help of a former boyfriend who gave her the lessons. From then on, her drum skills were self taught.

She performed No Frontiers, a cover of a Jimmy MacCarthy song, on The Corrs Unplugged along with her sister Sharon.

In 2020, Corr was part of an Irish collective of female singers and musicians called &quot;Irish Women in Harmony&quot;, that recorded a version of Dreams in aid of the charity &quot;SafeIreland&quot;, which deals with domestic abuse which had reportedly risen significantly during the COVID-19 lockdown.

== Career ==


== Personal life ==
Corr married Frank Woods, a property developer and boyfriend of many years, on 22 August 2002, in Majorca, Spain. Their first child, Jake Gerard Woods, was born on 12 February 2003. The boy was named after Caroline&#x27;s late brother, Gerard Corr Jr., who was hit by a car while retrieving a football in the road. The couple&#x27;s first daughter, Georgina Woods, was born on 11 October 2004. This led to Corr taking some time off from the band&#x27;s activities. On 1 December 2006 she welcomed a second daughter, Ryanne Andrea Woods, her third child with Frank. The couple separated in October 2020.

==Honours and awards==
In April 2002, she was awarded the Rory Gallagher Musician Award at the Hot Press Irish Music Awards held at held at the BBC&#x27;s Blackstaff studios in Belfast.

<text>Retrogradation is the landward change in position of the front of a river delta with time. This occurs when the mass balance of sediment into the delta is such that the volume of incoming sediment is less than the volume of the delta that is lost through subsidence, sea-level rise, and/or erosion. As a result, retrogradation is most common:
*during periods of sea-level rise which results in marine transgression. This can occur during major periods of global warming and the melting of continental ice sheets.
*with extremely low sediment input.

<doc id="654357" wikidata="Q455748" url="?curid=654357" title="Rodrigo Rato">
<text>Rodrigo de Rato y Figaredo (born 18 March 1949) is a businessman and politician who served in the Council of Ministers of Spain from 1996 to 2004. He also served as the ninth managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from 2004 to 2007 and the president of Bankia from 2010 to 2012.

Rato was arrested on 16 April 2015 for alleged fraud, embezzlement and money laundering. His case was still awaiting trial a year later when his name appeared in the Panama Papers. Despite his prior assurances that he did not own companies in tax havens, apparently he used two offshore companies to avoid taxes on millions of euros kept overseas. It has been alleged that he owes taxes to both the Spanish and Panamanian governments.

On 23 February 2017, Rato was found guilty of embezzlement of about 100,000 euros (in the so-called case &quot;black cards&quot;) and sentenced to 4½ years&#x27; imprisonment. In September 2018, the sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Spain, and Rato entered prison on 25 October 2018.

==Early life and education==
Rodrigo de Rato was born in Madrid, into a rich textile-owning family from Asturias. He is the great-grandson of politician Faustino Rodríguez-San Pedro y Díaz-Argüelles and the son of businessman Ramón Rato who was jailed in 1967 for tax evasion to Switzerland through his Banco Siero, and of Aurora Figaredo Sela. Both the Rato and the Figaredo sides of his family owned industries and nobility titles. Rato attended a Jesuit school Our Lady of Remembrance College, Madrid before studying law in the Complutense University.

In 1971 Rato went to University of California, Berkeley, and received an MBA in 1974 from the Haas School of Business.

==Career==
===Early beginnings===
In 1975 Rato became involved in the family business, first in Fuensanta, an Asturian mineral water company, and then in two Madrid construction firms. He also became involved in expanding the &quot;Cadena Rato&quot; chain of radio stations.

In 1977 Rato joined the newly formed Popular Alliance (AP), a party containing former ministers of Franco, founded by Manuel Fraga, a close personal friend of his father. In December 1979 Rato was elected to the national executive committee, and became secretary of the AP economic commission. In February 1981 he became one of the party&#x27;s five Secretaries-General, and was considered to be their economic expert. He supported tight controls on public spending, and an emphasis on the supply side of economics. In October 1982 he won election as an AP member of the Congress of Deputies for Cádiz in spite of having no connection to this Andalucian town. He represented the area until 1989 and subsequently represented Madrid from 1989 to 2000.

The 1982 election handed a loss to the AP, and marked the beginning of the long rule of the PSOE and Felipe González. Until 1984 Rato was the Secretary of the parliamentary group. He then became their economic affairs spokesman where he impressed the party with his attacks on the PSOE&#x27;s economic policies. He was seen to be on the liberal wing of the party.

When Fraga resigned from the leadership in December 1986 Rato backed Miguel Herrero y Rodríguez de Miñón who lost the leadership race to Antonio Hernández Mancha, but managed to keep his positions within the party. During these years he also continued his business career in Aguas de Fuensanta; having previously been the CEO of the company from 1978 to 1982, he served as chairman from 1985 to 1991. In June 1989 Fraga again became interim President after the generally acknowledged failure of the leadership of Hernández Mancha. The party became the slightly more inclusive People&#x27;s Party (PP). Rato was given shared responsibility over the elections with Francisco Álvarez-Cascos Fernández, the new party Secretary General. He was a close supporter of José María Aznar, who was voted as the new PP leader on 4 September.

On 29 October, the PP lost the general election, though his role in the campaign gave him national prominence. Afterwards he was appointed party spokesman. On 2 April 1990 his father sold the family stake in &quot;Cadena Rato&quot; for 5 billion pesetas. In June 1991 he stopped being President of Fuensanta, but remained on the board until 1993. On 6 June that year the PP lost another general election to PSOE. In the 12th National Congress in January 1996 he was confirmed as one of the three vice secretaries of the party.

===Minister of Economy and vice president===

Then on 3 March 1996 the PP won the general election. On 4 May Aznar became Prime Minister of Spain, and on 6 May Rato became both second Vice President and Minister of Economy and Finance. On 12 March 2000 the PP won again, this time with an absolute majority. His ministries were reorganised, and he gave all his responsibilities to Cristóbal Montoro Romero who became Minister of Finance. In his second term he had to fend off various charges of incompatibility between his public office and his private business interests.

===Managing Director of the IMF===

Rato became the managing director of the IMF on 7 June 2004, taking over from Anne Krueger, who had been acting as temporary Managing Director after Horst Köhler, who at that time was nominated (and later elected) President of Germany, resigned the post 4 March 2004.

In June 2007 Rato announced that he would resign from his post the following October, citing personal reasons. On 28 September 2007, the International Monetary Fund&#x27;s 24 executive directors elected former French Minister for Economics, Finance, and Industry, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, over former Czech Prime Minister Josef Tošovský, to be the new managing director in succession to Rato.

==Career in the private sector==
===Bankia===
Rato assumed the presidency of Caja Madrid in 2010, a public savings bank based in the Community of Madrid, and after a merger with other six saving banks he assumed the presidency of the new group now called Bankia. On 7 May 2012, he resigned amid growing concerns about the solvency of the bank. Although the core capital ratio was 10,4%, the Popular Party Government planned to lend about 8 billion euro to the bank to increase its solvency, as was done before throughout Europe (e.g. ING and Northern Rock crisis). Due to his political ties to the governing PP, which decided to inject the funds, Rato resigned. He had his salary cut from €2.3 million to €600,000 annually in 2011 due to new laws for rescued banks.

===Other activities===
* International Airlines Group (IAG), Member of the Board of Directors
* Mapfre, Member of the Board of Directors (2010–2012)

==Arrest and conviction==
On 4 July 2012, Rato, along with 30 other former members of the board of directors of Bankia, were charged with accounting irregularities. Bloomberg Businessweek listed Rato as the worst CEO in 2012. In 2011, Bankia had announced profits of €309 million; after Rato resigned, the figure was amended to €3 billion in losses. In October 2014, it became known that between 24 October 2010 to 28 November 2011, Rato made 519 purchases with a secret corporate credit card, spending a total of €99,041. Among these purchases he spent in one day were €3,547 in alcoholic beverages and €1,000 in shoes, along with 16 cash withdrawals of more than €1,000, most of them during the last months of his presidential term.

After a hearing 17 October 2014, the Spanish High Court judge Fernando Andreu assigned civil responsibility for the credit card abuse to Rodrigo Rato and Miguel Blesa. Rato was ordered to pay a bond of €3 million, and was expelled from the People&#x27;s Party (PP).

The case went to court in 2016. On 23 February 2017, Rato was convicted and sentenced to four and a half years in prison. In September 2018, the sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Spain, and Rato entered prison on 25 October 2018. He was held in solitary confinement under the FIES regime. In 2020, the High Court acquitted Rato in a separate trial over falsifying accounts and other charges in the listing of Bankia when he was the bank’s chairman. It later granted him a semi-release which allowed him to serve the rest of his sentence in partial liberty.

In December 2024, Rato was sentenced to a four-year jail term over tax crimes, corruption and money laundering committed in Spain during his tenure as head of Bankia. He was also fined more than two million euros and ordered to return 568,413 euros to Spain&#x27;s tax authorities. Rato said he would appeal.

== Personal life ==
Rodrigo Rato he has been married to journalist and editor-in-chief of the newspaper &quot;El Pais&quot; Alicia Gonzalez since 2015.

<doc id="654358" wikidata="Q2747070" url="?curid=654358" title="Kevin Millar">
<text>Kevin Charles Millar (; born September 24, 1971) is an American former professional baseball first baseman and outfielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) and is a current analyst for MLB Network and NESN. He played in MLB for the Florida Marlins, Boston Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles, and Toronto Blue Jays from 1998 through 2009. He is currently a host along with Siera Santos and Ryan Dempster on the MLB Network show &quot;Intentional Talk&quot;, and (as of March 2018) the show&#x27;s companion audio podcast &quot;Intentional Talk: Caught Listening&quot;.

==Early life==
Millar was born in Los Angeles. He played baseball for University High School in West Los Angeles, which won the 3-A City title in 1988 under coach Frank Cruz, during his junior year. He graduated from Hart High School in Santa Clarita, California. He attended and played college baseball for Los Angeles City College and later Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas. Under the tutelage of Coach Jim Gilligan, Millar and the Cardinals prospered. For two seasons, Millar was a key part of Lamar&#x27;s return to prominence in collegiate baseball. In 1992, Lamar went 32–21, posting the NCAA&#x27;s biggest turnaround with a 14-victory improvement over the 1991 season. Millar led the Cardinals that season in runs (41), hits (56), home runs (13) and runs batted in (50), and he earned All-Sun Belt Conference honors. After the 1992 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League.

The next season, Millar helped lead the Cardinals to a 44–18 record, to the SBC regular-season and tournament championships, and also to a berth in the NCAA&#x27;s Central I Regional on the campus of Texas A&amp;M in College Station. Lamar would be quickly eliminated in two games, with a 6–1 loss against UCLA, followed by a 10-5 finish against Texas A&amp;M.

==Professional career==
In 1993, Millar began his professional career with the Saint Paul Saints of the Northern League. He batted .260 with five home runs and 30 RBI in 63 games. On September 20, 1993, Millar&#x27;s contract was purchased by the Florida Marlins.

===Replacement player===
Millar was a replacement player during the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, when he played with the replacements in early 1995 and therefore, he is barred from membership in the Major League Baseball Players Association.

===Florida Marlins (1998–2002)===
From 1997 to 1999, during games encompassing several minor league stints, Millar set the record for most consecutive games reaching base with 71 (although this statistic only began to be formally tracked in the minors in 1996). This record was tied in 2003 by future Red Sox teammate Kevin Youkilis. Millar&#x27;s contract was purchased by the Marlins at the start of the 1998 season and he made his major league debut for Florida on April 11, 1998, against the Pittsburgh Pirates, finishing the game 1-for-2 with a walk after appearing as a pinch hitter in the sixth inning. The Marlins went on to lose the game, 7–6. He would appear in only one more game before spending the rest of the season in the minor leagues with the Triple-A Charlotte Knights, where he batted .326 with four home runs and 15 RBI. Millar played with the Marlins until the end of the 2002 season.

===Boston Red Sox (2003–2005)===
After the 2002 season, the Marlins sold Millar to the Chunichi Dragons of the Japanese Central League. In order for the transaction to be completed, he first had to clear the waivers requested by the Marlins, but the Red Sox broke an unwritten rule and blocked the deal with a waiver claim. Millar had signed a two-year, $6.2 million contract with the Dragons in January 2003, but in an unprecedented deal brokered by MLB, the Marlins later repaid the money that the Dragons had paid for Millar, and the Red Sox paid a similar sum to the Marlins in return for Millar. On February 15, 2003, Millar was officially traded to the Red Sox. His clubhouse presence and offensive production helped spark the Red Sox to the 2003 American League Championship Series and the 2004 World Series.

During the 2003 playoffs, Millar began using the phrase &quot;Cowboy Up&quot;, and in 2004 referred to his team as &quot;idiots&quot; to keep teammates loose during the stretch run to the World Series Championship.

Millar had a lead-off walk in the ninth inning of Game 4 of the 2004 ALCS against the Yankees, which, along with Dave Roberts&#x27; steal of second base that inning and an RBI single by Bill Mueller, proved to be the turning point in the series. Prior to the game, Millar was caught on camera numerous times telling reporters and his teammates &quot;Don&#x27;t let the Sox win tonight&quot;, in reference to Game 4 and in reference to the fact that Pedro Martínez and Curt Schilling were scheduled as the starting pitchers Games 5 and 6, respectively.

On April 20, 2012, Millar, together with Pedro Martínez, gave a toast to Fenway Park on the 100th anniversary of the ballpark. Millar and Martinez stood on top of the home dugout and gave a toast that was the largest in history, according to the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;.

===Baltimore Orioles (2006–2008)===
Millar signed a one-year, $2.1 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles on January 12, 2006. During the season, he broke Rey Ordóñez&#x27;s record for most games played by any non-drafted player who started his career in the Independent Leagues during the Draft era. He finished his first season in Baltimore with a .272 average, 15 home runs, and 64 RBI in 132 games. After the season, Millar re-signed with the Orioles on a one-year, $2.75 million contract on December 2, 2006. The deal also included an option for the 2008 season.

Initially in Baltimore, he was not an everyday player. However, when Dave Trembley took over the team, he began to play more regularly.

On August 23, 2007, Millar reached base safely for the 50th consecutive game, setting a franchise record for the Orioles. On August 26, 2007, Millar&#x27;s streak came to an end at 52 games. It was the seventh-longest streak since 1957.
===Toronto Blue Jays (2009)===
On February 11, 2009, Millar signed a minor league deal with the Toronto Blue Jays as a non-roster invitee. He successfully made the roster, serving as a backup to first baseman Lyle Overbay.

After Alex Ríos was claimed off waivers, Millar switched his number from #30 to his former #15.

===Chicago Cubs (2010)===
On February 1, 2010, Millar agreed to a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs, with an invitation to spring training. However, on March 30, he was released by the Cubs after not making the major league team.

===First retirement===
Millar announced his retirement on April 21, 2010, though on April 27 on MLB Network Radio with Jim Duquette and Kevin Kennedy, he stated it was not official as he still wanted to play. Millar joined MLB Network as a studio analyst. On May 20, 2010, Millar also joined New England Sports Network (NESN) as a pregame and postgame analyst. On May 22, Millar made his debut for Fox Sports and its MLB on Fox Saturday telecasts. He served as a pregame, game break, and postgame analyst for its primetime games in the studio, as well as a fill-in color analyst for select games during the season.

===Return to baseball (St. Paul Saints)===
On May 5, 2010, Millar returned to baseball when he signed a contract with the St. Paul Saints of the American Association, the same team with which he started his career. His contract language also allowed him to leave the team to carry out his broadcasting duties. He played six games for the Saints in 2010, hitting .208 with no home runs and two RBIs.

On June 24, 2017, Millar was allowed a single at-bat for the Saints in a regular-season game versus the Winnipeg Goldeyes as part of a promotional night celebrating the Saints&#x27; 25th anniversary. Facing his first live pitching in seven years, Millar hit a two-run home run in the bottom of the second inning; the Saints went on to win the game, 8–6.

==Podcasting==
In 2018, Millar and Chris Rose began co-hosting the audio podcast &quot;Intentional Talk: Caught Listening&quot;, produced by MLB Network.

==Awards==
After the 2001 season, Millar was awarded the Charlie Hough Good Guy Award by the Florida chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America.

After the 2003 season, Millar was awarded the Jackie Jensen Award, which is presented each year by the Boston chapter of the BBWAA. The award is presented to the player who best exemplifies the spirit and desire of Jackie Jensen, the former Red Sox outfielder.

==Movie and television appearances==

Millar made an appearance (in actual game footage from Game 4 of the 2004 ALCS) in the movie &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; in which he walked and was lifted for a pinch runner, Dave Roberts, during the Red Sox rally in the bottom of the 9th inning.

Millar co-hosts the MLB Network show &quot;Intentional Talk&quot; with Siera Santos and Ryan Dempster. He repeatedly uses the phrase &quot;Got heeeem&quot; which has become a signature part of &quot;Intentional Talk&quot;.

In 2022, Millar became a broadcaster and analyst for the Boston Red Sox on NESN. On August 21, 2023 Millar gained national recognition for calling Red Sox player Adam Duvall&#x27;s three run home run and its location right before it occurred.

==Personal life==
Millar is married and has four children. Millar is the nephew of former major league outfielder Wayne Nordhagen.

<text>Sharon Helga Corr (born 24 March 1970), is an Irish singer-songwriter, musician, and television personality. She is best known as a member of the pop-rock band the Corrs, which she co-founded in 1990 with her elder brother Jim and younger sisters Caroline and Andrea. She plays the violin, piano and guitar, and sings backing vocals. She began learning the violin when she was six years old. She has played in national youth orchestras and is qualified to teach the violin.

The Corr siblings were appointed honorary MBEs in 2005 by Queen Elizabeth II in recognition of both their musical talent and their charitable work raising money for the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne, victims of the Omagh Bombing, and other charities. On 22 March 2019, Corr was awarded an honorary doctorate (DUniv) by the Open University, in recognition of her &quot;exceptional contribution to education and culture&quot;. The ceremony took place at the Barbican Centre, London.

In 2012, Corr was revealed as one of the coaches on the first series of the RTÉ talent show &quot;The Voice of Ireland&quot;.

==Career==

===2009–2012: &quot;Dream of You&quot;===
In July 2009, Corr was voted into first place in the Ms Twitter UK competition.

On 15 July 2009, Corr appeared on &quot;This Morning&quot;, having been booked by host Phillip Schofield via Twitter, to confirm the release of a new solo single and album. Her début single, &quot;It&#x27;s Not a Dream&quot;, was released on 29 August in Ireland and 31 August in the UK, with appearances at Isle of Wight, Glastonbury, and a number of other European music festivals. The album, &quot;Dream of You&quot;, was released on 13 September 2010 and comprises a number of self-penned tracks and select covers with Corr playing violin throughout. She was joined by longtime Corrs&#x27; sidemen Anthony (Anto) Drennan on lead guitar, Keith Duffy on bass, and Jason Duffy on drums, with orchestral arrangements by Fiachra Trench, a collaborator on four Corrs&#x27; albums.

Corr embarked on the Dream of You Tour on 19 August 2011 in Aberdeen and continued through the UK and Europe, with an Australian leg added in January 2012. While on the tour she introduced a newly written track, &quot;Edge of Nowhere&quot;, which will be included on her second album.

===2012–present: &quot;The Voice of Ireland&quot;, &quot;The Same Sun&quot; and &quot;The Fool and the Scorpion&quot;===
Corr was a coach on the first and second series of the RTÉ talent show &quot;The Voice of Ireland&quot;.

In an interview with the Maitland Mercury in February 2012, Corr revealed that she is piecing together her second solo record.

Corr finished writing the album in March 2012 and she said it may be called &quot;Catch the Moon&quot;. The title comes from the idea &quot;of when somebody comes into your life and they utterly change yours, that you would go to any lengths for them... so you would catch the moon.&quot; However, on 21 August 2013 it was announced that the new album would be titled &quot;The Same Sun&quot;. The lead single from the album, &quot;Take a Minute&quot;, peaked at No. 11 on the Irish charts and No. 20 in the France charts. Corr also embarked on The Same Sun Tour in late 2013, touring in The Netherlands, Germany, Brazil, and Indonesia. She performed in Indonesia at Jakarta Convention Center (JCC), Jakarta, Indonesia, on 24 September 2013 (WIB) as a special guest. She was also joined on tour by Yovie Widianto who was a special guest in Madrid, Spain, in November 2013. The tour continued throughout the United States during January and February 2014.

In 2015, The Corrs reunited, releasing the albums White Light. That album was followed up by Jupiter Calling in 2017.

Sharon released her third solo album, The Fool and the Scorpion on 24 September 2021. 
Promo for this album started in May with the announcement of a solo residency at Sala Clamores in Madrid, Spain. In May and June 2022, Sharon will embark on a UK tour supporting Jeff Beck, following her Spain and France gigs in January 2022.

==Personal life==
In 2001, Corr married Belfast barrister Robert Gavin Bonnar in Cratloe Church, County Clare. In a performance for BBC Radio 2, she stated, before performing the song, that she walked up the aisle to &quot;Along with the Girls&quot;, a traditional instrumental track that featured on the Corrs&#x27; first album, &quot;Forgiven, Not Forgotten&quot;. The couple met when she was shooting the video for &quot;Runaway&quot;. They had their first child, son Cathal (&quot;Cal&quot;) Robert Gerard, on 31 March 2006, and their second child, daughter Flori Jean Elizabeth, on 18 July 2007. The couple split in October 2019. After having children, she battled with social anxiety disorder and wrote about her anxiety problems on her solo album.

==Other recordings==
As well as &quot;No Frontiers&quot; with Caroline Corr, Sharon sings &quot;Dimming of the Day&quot; and the demo version of &quot;Goodbye&quot;. In 1999 she recorded violin parts for the Jean Michel Jarre track &quot;Rendez-vous à Paris&quot;, which was released in 2000 on the album &quot;Métamorphoses&quot;.

She also recorded two tracks in 2008 with the Welsh operatic singer Bryn Terfel, and &quot;Amarrado a Ti&quot; with the Spanish singer Alex Ubago in 2009.

<text>James Steven Ignatius Corr (born 31 July 1964) is an Irish musician, singer, songwriter and DJ. He is a member of the Irish folk/rock band the Corrs, the other members being his three younger sisters Andrea, Sharon and Caroline.

==Musical career==
Corr first took guitar lessons in his hometown of Dundalk, a large industrial town in County Louth. Corr plays acoustic and electric guitar as well as piano, keyboard, accordion and singing background vocals. He has also had an active role in the production aspects of all of The Corrs&#x27; albums to date, working with David Foster and Olle Romo on two separate albums.

==Charity work and recognition==
The Corr siblings were appointed as honorary MBEs in 2005 by Queen Elizabeth II, in recognition of their musical talents and also their charitable work which raised money for Freeman Hospital in Newcastle (where their mother was treated), victims of the Omagh Bombing, The Prince&#x27;s Trust, and other charities.

Jim and his sisters were also involved in the Live 8 series of concerts, performing at Edinburgh in mid-2005 alongside Bono and other acts such as Annie Lennox, Eddie Izzard and Bob Geldof. He also performed at Nelson Mandela&#x27;s &quot;46664&quot; concert in South Africa, to help raise awareness of the growing AIDS epidemic in Africa.

==Personal views==
Corr is a member of the 9/11 Truth Movement and operates a website on which he writes about the New World Order, including the notion that 11 September 2001, was an inside job. Following the death of Osama bin Laden in May 2011, Corr maintained that bin Laden had actually died in 2001. At some point in September 2015, all conspiracy related content was removed from his site and the URL began to redirect to the main Corrs website.

Corr opposed lifting Ireland&#x27;s constitutional ban on abortion in the 2018 Repeal the Eighth referendum.

In 2020, Corr posted on social media that he had attended an anti-lockdown and anti-mask protest during the COVID-19 pandemic organised by groups known as Health Freedom Ireland and Yellow Vests Ireland.

==Personal life==
Corr has a son, Brandon, with ex-fiancée Gayle Williamson, a former Miss Northern Ireland.

<doc id="654362" wikidata="Q2249285" url="?curid=654362" title="Vallis (planetary geology)">
<text>Vallis or valles (plural &quot;valles&quot; ) is the Latin word for &quot;valley&quot;. It is used in planetary geology to name landform features on other planets.

Scientists used &quot;vallis&quot; for old river valleys they discovered when they sent the first probes to Mars. The Viking Orbiters caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars; finding huge river valleys in many areas. Space craft cameras showed that floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometers. Some valles on Mars (Mangala Vallis, Athabasca Vallis, Granicus Vallis, and Tinjar Valles) clearly begin at graben. On the other hand, some of the large outflow channels begin in rubble-filled low areas, called chaos or chaotic terrain. It has been suggested that massive amounts of water were trapped under pressure beneath a thick cryosphere (layer of frozen ground), then the water was suddenly released, perhaps when the cryosphere was broken by a fault.

==Nirgal Vallis and sapping==

Nirgal Vallis is one of the longest valley networks on Mars. It is so large that it is found on more than one quadrangle. Scientists are not sure about how all the ancient river valleys were formed. There is evidence that instead of rain or snow, the water that formed the valleys originated underground. One mechanism that has been advanced is sapping. In sapping, the ground just gives away as water comes out. Sapping is common in some desert areas in America&#x27;s Southwest. Sapping forms alcoves and stubby tributaries. These features are visible in the picture from the Coprates quadrangle of Nigal Vallis taken with Mars Odyssey&#x27;s THEMIS.

== Kasei Valles ==
One of the most significant features of the Lunae Palus region, Kasei Valles is one of the largest outflow channels on Mars; like other outflow channels, it was carved by liquid water, probably during gigantic floods.

Kasei is about long. Some sections of Kasei Valles are wide. It begins in Echus Chasma, near Valles Marineris, and empties into Chryse Planitia, not far from where Viking 1 landed. Sacra Mensa, a large tableland divides Kasei into northern and southern channels.

Scientists suggest it was formed by several episodes of flooding and maybe by some glacial activity.
== Other valles in the Lunae Palus quadrangle ==

==Valles in the Syrtis Major quadrangle==
==Valles in the Hellas quadrangle==
== Lineated Floor Deposits ==

The floors of some channels have features called lineated floor deposits. They are ridged and grooved materials that seem to deflect around obstacles. Scientists believe they are ice-rich. Some glaciers on the Earth show such features. Lineated floor deposits may be related to lobate debris aprons, which have been proven to contain large amounts of ice. Reull Vallis, as pictured below, displays these deposits.
==Origin of Dao Vallis==
Dao Vallis begins near a large volcano, called Hadriaca Patera, so it is thought to have received water when hot magma melted huge amounts of ice in the frozen ground. The partially circular depressions on the left side of the channel in the image below suggests that groundwater sapping also contributed water.

<doc id="654373" wikidata="Q4409456" url="?curid=654373" title="White sugar">
<text>White sugar, also called table sugar, granulated sugar, or regular sugar, is a commonly used type of sugar, made either of beet sugar or cane sugar, which has undergone a refining process. It is nearly pure sucrose.

== Description ==
The refining process completely removes the molasses from cane juice or beet juice to give the disaccharide white sugar, sucrose. It has a purity higher than 99.7%. Its molecular formula is . White sugars produced from sugar cane and sugar beet are chemically indistinguishable: it is possible, however, to identify its origin through a carbon-13 analysis.

White sugar (and some brown sugar) produced from sugar cane may be refined using bone char by a few sugar cane refiners. Beet sugar has never been processed with bone char and is vegan. In modern times, activated carbon and ion-exchange resin may be used – see .

From a chemical and nutritional point of view, white sugar does not contain—in comparison to brown sugar—some minerals (such as calcium, potassium, iron and magnesium) present in small quantities in molasses. The only detectable differences are, therefore, the white color and the less intense flavor.

== Health Impacts ==
The overconsumption of white sugar (or any sugar) brings many health consequences. Such as heart disease, obesity, type-2 diabetes, and more. The CDC recommends limiting daily sugar consumption to less than 200 calories worth (about 12 teaspoons/48 grams) on a 2000 calorie diet.

<text>A fishing light attractor is a fishing aid that uses lights attached to a structure above water or suspended underwater to attract fish and members of their food chain. Fish are most attracted to true-green light colors, and LEDs do the best job of illuminating this color.

A fishing light attractor is a fishing aid that uses lights attached to structures above water or suspended underwater to attract fish and members of their food chain. Fish are typically most attracted to true-green light colors. 

Light attractors work by taking advantage of phototactic behavior exhibited by many species of fish that are either attracted by the light themselves, or have come to prey upon any phototactic invertebrates that are drawn by the light.

<text>Frederick Elwyn Elwyn-Jones, Baron Elwyn-Jones, (24 October 1909 – 4 December 1989), commonly known as Elwyn Jones, was a Welsh barrister and Labour politician.

==Background and education==
Elwyn Jones was born in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, and read history for a year at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, and then at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He spent time in Germany in the 1930s.

An acting bombardier in the Royal Artillery (Territorial Army), he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 23 December 1939. He ended his service as a major.

==Legal career==
Jones became a barrister and Recorder of Merthyr Tydfil. He was also a broadcaster and journalist. He served as junior British Counsel during the Nuremberg Trials, and led for the prosecution (Leading Prosecutor) at the Hamburg trial of Marshal Erich von Manstein in 1948. He was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1953.

In 1966, he led the prosecution of the Moors murderers, Ian Brady and Myra Hindley.

==Political career==
At the 1945 general election, he was elected as Labour Member of Parliament for Plaistow, east London. In 1950, he became MP for West Ham South, serving until 1974. In 1964, Elwyn Jones was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Attorney General (receiving the customary knighthood) by Harold Wilson, a post he held until 1970.

In February 1974, he was once again elected to Parliament, now for Newham South, but left the House of Commons soon afterwards when he was made a life peer. On 11 March, he was created &quot;Baron Elwyn-Jones, of Llanelli in the County of Carmarthen and of Newham in Greater London&quot;, with a change of his surname to &quot;Elwyn-Jones&quot;. The resulting by-election allowed Nigel Spearing to re-enter Parliament as he had lost the Acton seat in the February election. He served as Lord Chancellor from 1974 to 1979, under Harold Wilson and James Callaghan. In 1976 he was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour.

==Personal life==
In 1937, Jones married Pearl &quot;Polly&quot; Binder, an artist from Manchester. The couple had three children: Josephine, Lou and Dan. Josephine became a researcher on Jacob Bronowski&#x27;s TV series &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot; and married Francis Gladstone (a great-grandson of Prime Minister William Gladstone). Dan Jones is an artist, collector of children&#x27;s playground songs and human rights campaigner.

Elwyn-Jones&#x27;s brother Idris (1900–1971) was captain of the Wales rugby union team in 1925, and was an industrial chemist who became Director General of Research Development for the National Coal Board.

Elwyn-Jones died in December 1989, aged 80.

<doc id="654387" wikidata="Q2088417" url="?curid=654387" title="Distance geometry">
<text>Distance geometry is the branch of mathematics concerned with characterizing and studying sets of points based &quot;only&quot; on given values of the distances between pairs of points. More abstractly, it is the study of semimetric spaces and the isometric transformations between them. In this view, it can be considered as a subject within general topology.

Historically, the first result in distance geometry is Heron&#x27;s formula in 1st century AD. The modern theory began in 19th century with work by Arthur Cayley, followed by more extensive developments in the 20th century by Karl Menger and others.

Distance geometry problems arise whenever one needs to infer the shape of a configuration of points (relative positions) from the distances between them, such as in biology, sensor networks, surveying, navigation, cartography, and physics.

== Introduction and definitions ==
The concepts of distance geometry will first be explained by describing two particular problems.

=== First problem: hyperbolic navigation ===
Consider three ground radio stations A, B, C, whose locations are known. A radio receiver is at an unknown location. The times it takes for a radio signal to travel from the stations to the receiver, formula_1, are unknown, but the time differences, formula_2 and formula_3, are known. From them, one knows the distance differences formula_4 and formula_5, from which the position of the receiver can be found.

=== Second problem: dimension reduction===
In data analysis, one is often given a list of data represented as vectors formula_6, and one needs to find out whether they lie within a low-dimensional affine subspace. A low-dimensional representation of data has many advantages, such as saving storage space, computation time, and giving better insight into data.

=== Definitions ===
Now we formalize some definitions that naturally arise from considering our problems.

==== Semimetric space ====
Given a list of points on formula_7, formula_8, we can arbitrarily specify the distances between pairs of points by a list of formula_9, formula_10. This defines a semimetric space: a metric space without triangle inequality.

Explicitly, we define a semimetric space as a nonempty set formula_11 equipped with a semimetric formula_12 such that, for all formula_13,

# Positivity: formula_14   if and only if  formula_15.
# Symmetry: formula_16.

Any metric space is &quot;a fortiori&quot; a semimetric space. In particular, formula_17, the formula_18-dimensional Euclidean space, is the canonical metric space in distance geometry.

The triangle inequality is omitted in the definition, because we do not want to enforce more constraints on the distances formula_19 than the mere requirement that they be positive.

In practice, semimetric spaces naturally arise from inaccurate measurements. For example, given three points formula_20 on a line, with formula_21, an inaccurate measurement could give formula_22, violating the triangle inequality.

==== Isometric embedding ====
Given two semimetric spaces, formula_23, an isometric embedding from formula_11 to formula_25 is a map formula_26 that preserves the semimetric, that is, for all formula_13, formula_28.

For example, given the finite semimetric space formula_29 defined above, an isometric embedding from formula_11 to formula_17 is defined by points formula_32, such that formula_33 for all formula_10.

==== Affine independence ====
Given the points formula_32, they are defined to be affinely independent, iff they cannot fit inside a single formula_36-dimensional affine subspace of formula_37, for any formula_38, iff the formula_39&quot;-&quot;simplex they span, formula_40, has positive formula_39-volume, that is, formula_42.

In general, when formula_43, they are affinely independent, since a generic &quot;n&quot;-simplex is nondegenerate. For example, 3 points in the plane, in general, are not collinear, because the triangle they span does not degenerate into a line segment. Similarly, 4 points in space, in general, are not coplanar, because the tetrahedron they span does not degenerate into a flat triangle.

When formula_44, they must be affinely dependent. This can be seen by noting that any formula_39-simplex that can fit inside formula_17 must be &quot;flat&quot;.

==Cayley–Menger determinants==

Cayley–Menger determinants, named after Arthur Cayley and Karl Menger, are determinants of matrices of distances between sets of points.

Let formula_47 be &quot;n&quot; + 1 points in a semimetric space, their Cayley–Menger determinant is defined by

: formula_48

If formula_49, then they make up the vertices of a possibly degenerate &quot;n&quot;-simplex formula_40 in formula_17. It can be shown that the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional volume of the simplex formula_40 satisfies

: formula_53

Note that, for the case of formula_54, we have formula_55, meaning the &quot;0-dimensional volume&quot; of a 0-simplex is 1, that is, there is 1 point in a 0-simplex.

formula_47 are affinely independent iff formula_42, that is, formula_58. Thus Cayley–Menger determinants give a computational way to prove affine independence.

If formula_59, then the points must be affinely dependent, thus formula_60. Cayley&#x27;s 1841 paper studied the special case of formula_61, that is, any five points formula_62 in 3-dimensional space must have formula_63.

== History ==
The first result in distance geometry is Heron&#x27;s formula, from 1st century AD, which gives the area of a triangle from the distances between its 3 vertices. Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula, from 7th century AD, generalizes it to cyclic quadrilaterals. Tartaglia, from 16th century AD, generalized it to give the volume of tetrahedron from the distances between its 4 vertices.

The modern theory of distance geometry began with Arthur Cayley and Karl Menger. Cayley published the Cayley determinant in 1841, which is a special case of the general Cayley–Menger determinant. Menger proved in 1928 a characterization theorem of all semimetric spaces that are isometrically embeddable in the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space formula_64. In 1931, Menger used distance relations to give an axiomatic treatment of Euclidean geometry.

Leonard Blumenthal&#x27;s book gives a general overview for distance geometry at the graduate level, a large part of which is treated in English for the first time when it was published.

== Menger characterization theorem ==
Menger proved the following characterization theorem of semimetric spaces:A semimetric space formula_29 is isometrically embeddable in the formula_39-dimensional Euclidean space formula_64, but not in formula_68 for any formula_69, if and only if:

# formula_11 contains an formula_71-point subset formula_72 that is isometric with an affinely independent formula_71-point subset of formula_64;
# any formula_75-point subset formula_76, obtained by adding any two additional points of formula_11 to formula_72, is congruent to an formula_75-point subset of formula_64.
A proof of this theorem in a slightly weakened form (for metric spaces instead of semimetric spaces) is in.

== Characterization via Cayley–Menger determinants ==
The following results are proved in Blumethal&#x27;s book.

=== Embedding &quot;n&quot; + 1 points in the real numbers ===
Given a semimetric space formula_81 , with formula_82, and formula_83, formula_10, an isometric embedding of formula_85 into formula_64 is defined by formula_87, such that formula_33 for all formula_10.

Again, one asks whether such an isometric embedding exists for formula_90.

A necessary condition is easy to see: for all formula_91, let formula_92 be the &quot;k&quot;-simplex formed by formula_93, then

:formula_94

The converse also holds. That is, if for all formula_91,

:formula_96

then such an embedding exists.

Further, such embedding is unique up to isometry in formula_64. That is, given any two isometric embeddings defined by formula_98, and formula_99, there exists a (not necessarily unique) isometry formula_100, such that formula_101 for all formula_102. Such formula_103 is unique if and only if formula_104, that is, formula_98 are affinely independent.

=== Embedding &quot;n&quot; + 2 and &quot;n&quot; + 3 points ===
If formula_106 points formula_107 can be embedded in formula_64 as formula_109, then other than the conditions above, an additional necessary condition is that the formula_71-simplex formed by formula_111, must have no formula_71-dimensional volume. That is, formula_113.

The converse also holds. That is, if for all formula_91,

: formula_115

and

: formula_116

then such an embedding exists.

For embedding formula_117 points in formula_64, the necessary and sufficient conditions are similar:

# For all formula_91, formula_120;
#formula_121
# formula_122
#formula_123

=== Embedding arbitrarily many points ===
The formula_117 case turns out to be sufficient in general.

In general, given a semimetric space formula_29, it can be isometrically embedded in formula_64 if and only if there exists formula_127, such that, for all formula_91, formula_120, and for any formula_130,

#formula_121
#formula_122
#formula_123

And such embedding is unique up to isometry in formula_64.

Further, if formula_104, then it cannot be isometrically embedded in any formula_136. And such embedding is unique up to unique isometry in formula_64.

Thus, Cayley–Menger determinants give a concrete way to calculate whether a semimetric space can be embedded in formula_64, for some finite formula_39, and if so, what is the minimal formula_39.

==Applications==

There are many applications of distance geometry.

In telecommunication networks such as GPS, the positions of some sensors are known (which are called anchors) and some of the distances between sensors are also known: the problem is to identify the positions for all sensors. Hyperbolic navigation is one pre-GPS technology that uses distance geometry for locating ships based on the time it takes for signals to reach anchors.

There are many applications in chemistry. Techniques such as NMR can measure distances between pairs of atoms of a given molecule, and the problem is to infer the 3-dimensional shape of the molecule from those distances.

Some software packages for applications are:

*DGSOL. Solves large distance geometry problems in macromolecular modeling.
*Xplor-NIH. Based on X-PLOR, to determine the structure of molecules based on data from NMR experiments. It solves distance geometry problems with heuristic methods (such as simulated annealing) and local search methods (such as conjugate gradient minimization).
*TINKER. Molecular modeling and design. It can solve distance geometry problems.
*SNLSDPclique. MATLAB code for locating sensors in a sensor network based on the distances between the sensors.

<text>General Sir Banastre Tarleton, 1st Baronet (21 August 175415 January 1833) was a British military officer and politician. He is best known as the lieutenant colonel leading the British Legion at the end of the American Revolutionary War. He later served in Portugal and held commands in Ireland and England. 

During most of his service in North America, he led the British Legion, a provincial unit organised in New York in 1778. After returning to Great Britain in 1781 at the age of 27, Tarleton was elected to Parliament as a member for Liverpool. He served as a prominent Whig politician for 20 years. He was interested in military matters and opposed abolition of the slave trade.

== Early life ==
Banastre Tarleton was the third of seven children born to merchant John Tarleton (1718–1773) and his wife. His father had prospered in the West Indian sugar trade and also managed several slaving vessels. Tarleton’s &amp; Backhouse became one of the largest import-export companies in Britain. The family had trade interests throughout America and dealt in many cargoes, including slaves.

Tarleton was educated at Oxford, attending University College. He was further educated at Middle Temple, London, which, at that time, served as a college for the education of lawyers. In 1773 at the age of 19, he inherited £5,000 on his father&#x27;s death. He squandered almost all of it in less than a year on gambling and women, mostly at the Cocoa Tree club in London. 

In 1775 he purchased a commission as a cavalry officer (cornet) in the 1st Dragoon Guards (effective from 2 May 1775). He proved to be a gifted horseman and leader of troops. Owing to his abilities, he worked his way up through the ranks to lieutenant colonel without having to purchase any further commissions.

== American War of Independence ==
In December 1775, at the age of 21, the volunteer-soldier Banastre Tarleton sailed from Cork to North America, where the American War of Independence (1775–83) had broken out. Tarleton sailed with Lord Cornwallis as part of an expedition to capture the southern city of Charleston, South Carolina. After that expedition failed, at the Battle of Sullivan&#x27;s Island (28 June 1776), Tarleton went north to join the main British Army under command of General William Howe, in New York.

Under the command of Colonel William Harcourt, Tarleton, as a cornet, was part of a scouting party sent to gather intelligence on the movements of General Charles Lee, in New Jersey. On 13 December 1776, Tarleton surrounded a house in Basking Ridge, and forced Lee, still in dressing gown, to surrender, as he threatened to burn down the house. General Lee was taken to New York as a prisoner of war. He later was used in an exchange of prisoners.

In the course of the colonial war in North America, Cornet Tarleton&#x27;s campaign service during 1776 earned him the position of brigade major at the end of the year; he was twenty-two years old. He was promoted to captain on 13 June 1778. Major Tarleton was at the Battle of Brandywine and at other battles in the campaigns of 1777 and 1778. One such battle, in 1778, was an attack upon a communications outpost on Signal Hill in Easttown Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, which was guarded by troops commanded by Capt. Henry Lee III, of the Continental Army, who repulsed the British attack.

=== Capture of Charleston ===

After becoming commander of the British Legion, a force of American Loyalist cavalry and light infantry, Tarleton went to South Carolina at the beginning of 1780. There, the Legion supported Sir Henry Clinton in the siege operations that culminated in the British capture of Charleston. The siege and capture of the city were part of the British strategy in the southern military theatre meant to restore royal authority over the southern colonies of British North America.

=== Battle of Waxhaws ===


On 29 May 1780, Colonel Tarleton, with a force of 149 mounted soldiers, overtook a detachment of 350 to 380 Virginia Continentals, led by Colonel Abraham Buford. Buford rejected Tarleton&#x27;s invitation to surrender on essentially the same terms as the Charles Town garrison. The Continentals continued marching, not preparing for battle until they heard their rear guard in action. Only after sustaining many casualties did Buford order the American soldiers to surrender. Nonetheless, Tarleton&#x27;s forces ignored the white flag and massacred the soldiers of Buford&#x27;s detachment; 113 American soldiers were killed, 203 were captured, and 150 were severely wounded. The British army casualties were 5 soldiers killed and 12 soldiers wounded. From the perspective of the British Army, the affair of the massacre is known as the Battle of Waxhaw Creek. In that time, the American rebels used the phrase &quot;Tarleton&#x27;s quarter&quot; (shooting after surrender) as meaning &quot;no quarter offered&quot;.

Forty years later, Robert Brownfield, a surgeon’s mate in the Second South Carolina Regiment
at the time of the battle, wrote an account. He said that Colonel Buford raised the white flag of surrender to the British Legion, &quot;expecting the usual treatment sanctioned by civilized warfare&quot;; yet, while Buford called for quarter, Colonel Tarleton&#x27;s horse was shot with a musket ball, felling horse and man. On seeing that, the Loyalist cavalrymen believed that the Virginia Continentals had shot their commander – while they asked him for mercy. Enraged, the Loyalist troops attacked the Virginians and &quot;commenced a scene of indiscriminate carnage never surpassed by the ruthless atrocities of the most barbarous savages&quot;; in the aftermath, the British Legion soldiers killed wounded American soldiers where they lay.

Tarleton&#x27;s account, published in 1787, said that his horse had been shot from under him. His soldiers, thinking him murdered while the Continentals were asking for quarter, were vengeful until they could be brought under control.

Regardless of the extent to which they were true or false, the reports of British atrocities motivated Whig-leaning colonials to support the American Revolution. On 7 October 1780, at the Battle of Kings Mountain, South Carolina, soldiers of the Continental Army, having heard of the slaughter at Waxhaw Creek, killed American Loyalists who had surrendered after a sniper killed their British commanding officer, Maj. Patrick Ferguson.

=== Subsequent operations ===
In South Carolina, to deny resupply of food and horses, cause attrition and reduce reconnoitering, Tarleton&#x27;s British Legion were harried by Francis Marion, an American militia commander who practiced guerrilla warfare against the British. Throughout the campaigns, Tarleton was unable to capture him or thwart his operations. Marion&#x27;s local popularity among anti-British South Carolinians ensured continual aid and comfort for the American cause. In contrast, Colonel Tarleton alienated the colonial citizens with arbitrary confiscations of cattle and food stocks.

Tarleton materially helped Cornwallis to win the Battle of Camden in August 1780. On 22 August, he was promoted to major in the 79th Regiment of Foot (Royal Liverpool Volunteers). He defeated Thomas Sumter at Fishing Creek, aka &quot;Catawba Fords&quot;, but was less successful when he encountered the same general at Blackstock&#x27;s Farm in November 1780.

On 17 January 1781, Tarleton&#x27;s forces were virtually destroyed by American Brigadier General Daniel Morgan at the Battle of Cowpens. Tarleton and about 200 men escaped the battlefield.

Lieutenant Colonel William Washington commanded the rebel cavalry; to deprive the rebels of leadership he was targeted by the British commander and two of his men. Tarleton was stopped by Washington himself, who attacked him with his sabre, calling out, &quot;Where is now the boasting Tarleton?&quot; A cornet of the 17th, Thomas Patterson, rode up to strike Washington but was shot and killed by Washington&#x27;s orderly trumpeter.

Washington survived this assault and in the process wounded Tarleton&#x27;s right hand with a sabre blow, while Tarleton creased Washington&#x27;s knee with a pistol shot that also wounded his horse. Washington pursued Tarleton for sixteen miles, but gave up the chase when he came to the plantation of Adam Goudylock near Thicketty Creek. Tarleton was able to escape capture by forcing Goudylock to serve as a guide.
He was successful in a skirmish at Torrence&#x27;s Tavern while the British crossed the Catawba River (Cowan&#x27;s Ford Skirmish, 1 February 1781) and took part in the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in March 1781. With his men, Tarleton marched with Cornwallis into Virginia. There he carried out a series of small expeditions while in Virginia. Among them was a raid on Charlottesville, where the state government had relocated following the British occupation of the capital at Richmond. He was trying to capture Governor Thomas Jefferson and members of the Virginia General Assembly. The raid was partially foiled by the ride of Jack Jouett, with Jefferson and all but seven of the legislators escaping over the mountains. Tarleton destroyed arms and munitions and succeeded in dispersing the Assembly.

Tarleton was brevetted to lieutenant-colonel in the 79th Foot on 26 June 1781. After other missions, Cornwallis instructed Tarleton to hold Gloucester Point, during the Siege of Yorktown. On 4 October 1781, the French Lauzun&#x27;s Legion and the British cavalry, commanded by Tarleton, skirmished at Gloucester Point. Tarleton was unhorsed, and Lauzun&#x27;s Legion drove the British within their lines before being ordered to withdraw by the Marquis de Choisy. The Legion suffered three Hussars killed with two officers and eleven Hussars wounded. Fifty British were killed or wounded, including Tarleton. The British surrendered Gloucester Point to the French and Americans after the surrender at Yorktown in October 1781. He returned to Britain on parole, finished with this war at the age of 27.

== Return to England ==

Banastre Tarleton returned to England a hero: a triumphant veteran wounded in his country’s service. On his arrival “[in] Liverpool in 1782 after legendary exploits in the American war of independence, the church bells rang out and he was feted by admirers.” Knight expands on this:
=== Images everywhere ===

Tarleton sat for portraits by three leading artists in London: Reynolds, Gainsborough, and Cosway. Contrary to claims of Tarleton’s vanity, he did not pay to have them painted. 

Tarleton’s brother commissioned Sir Joshua Reynolds’ well-known painting of Banastre for their mother. “Colonel Tarleton” is regarded as one of the finest examples of Reynolds&#x27; work and portraiture in general. The full-length painting, at 236 × 145.5 cm (92.9 x 57.3 inches) is too tall to fit in many homes. Like Tarleton’s mark on the history of the war, the painting is larger than life. The National Gallery describes it:

 The pose disguises Tarleton’s mutilated right hand, of which he lost two fingers to a musket ball at the Battle of Guilford Court House. The flags are unidentified. The Reynolds painting was shown at the Royal Academy later in the year. 

Thomas Gainsborough’s equestrian portrait of Tarleton, an even larger canvas, was also exhibited in 1782. John Tarleton wrote to their mother in evident pride, “The picture of my Brother at Gainsborough&#x27;s will not measure with the frame less than 12 feet 6 inches.&quot; 

The portrait by the third artist, Richard Cosway, is on quite a different scale. During the late Georgian and Regency periods, Cosway became a sought-after miniaturist as well as receiving commissions for his full-sized portraits. He was the only artist ever appointed official painter to the Prince of Wales. Miniatures were the wallet photos of their era, meeting the need for images which could be transported easily, and it is for these which Cosway is most famous today. His miniature of Banastre Tarleton is in a private collection and a photograph of it is copyrighted.

Some good quality engravings of Tarleton exist, having met the popular interest in him. Most commonly, they were based on the Reynolds painting. Others likely arise from the Gainsborough. Some are inaccurate, perhaps imagined by the engraver. A few were coloured to show him in a red uniform, presumably to meet the expectations of some readers. 

Engravings were the basis for illustrations of Tarleton in books and magazines. Others were made for transfer printing on earthenware. There are examples of jugs with his likeness in museums on both sides of the Atlantic.

As a well-known person, politician, and member of the princely social circle, Tarleton was satirized. A caricature of him appeared in several Gilray prints, both as one of the group and as the main subject. L&#x27;Assemblée Nationale includes a figure in a Tarleton helmet.

=== Recriminations ===


The war wasn’t over after the capitulation at Yorktown, though most of the fighting was finished. Yet the war of words amongst soldiers and politicians was already under way. The London Morning Chronicle printed an anonymous letter castigating Tarleton on 9 August 1782. Lieutenant Roderick MacKenzie was probably the author. MacKenzie had been a junior officer of the 71st Regiment of Foot (Fraser’s Highlanders). He was wounded and captured at the Battle of Cowpens for which he blamed Tarleton. Agniel wrote “If one takes exception to the premise that Lieutenant MacKenzie loathed his commanding officer, it is entirely feasible to substitute any other verb which means roughly the same thing.” Babits noted “Lieutenant Roderick MacKenzie and others had clear bias and slanted their accounts to suit their own purposes...MacKenzie hated Banastre Tarleton…” Buchanan said Mackenzie “bore considerable personal animosity against Tarleton”.

Subsequent letters extended Mackenzie’s criticism to Cornwallis and Clinton, and continued to attack Tarleton for years. As the events of 1781, the year of the defeat at Cowpens and the surrender at Yorktown, were picked apart, the principal actors responded. Clinton’s account was first. He held that “none of the misfortunes of the very unfortunate campaign of 1781 can, with the smallest degree of justice, be imputed to me.” Cornwallis rebutted Clinton’s claims the same year. They continued to trade shots for years after the treaty was signed, attempting to prove themselves blameless for the loss of thirteen of the provinces in North America. Tarleton became a focus of the controversy due to the loss of the light infantry at Cowpens. However, according to Scotti, the criticism of Tarleton “was fuelled by resentment and jealousy.”

Tarleton defended himself in response to their publications and Mackenzie’s vendetta. The eventual result was Tarleton’s 1787 book, &quot;History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781 in the Southern Provinces of North America&quot;. Mackenzie followed by compiling his letters into a book, and explicitly criticised Tarleton’s account almost line by line. The &quot;Cornwallis Correspondence&quot; also included responses. Major George Hanger (Lord Coleraine) published a rebuttal to Mackenzie in his “Address to the Army”.

Of all the British documentation about the war, Tarleton’s &quot;History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781 in the Southern Provinces of North America&quot; has remained a resource for historians. The book questions decisions made by Cornwallis.

== Later military career==

Tarleton continued to serve in the British Army and was promoted to colonel on 22 November 1790, to major-general on 4 October 1794 and to lieutenant-general on 1 January 1801. Whilst on service in Portugal, Tarleton succeeded William Henry Vane, 3rd Earl of Darlington as colonel of the Princess of Wales&#x27;s Fencible Dragoons in 1799. Tarleton was appointed colonel of the 21st Light Dragoons on 24 July 1802. He was brevetted to general on 1 January 1812. He had hoped to be appointed to command British forces in the Peninsular War, but the position was instead given to Wellington. He held a military command in Ireland and another in England.

Tarleton had lost two fingers from a musket ball received in his right hand during the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in North Carolina, but &quot;his crippled hand was to prove an electoral asset&quot; back home. The condition of his hand is disguised in the pose of his 1782 portrait (shown in this article) by Sir Joshua Reynolds.

== Member of Parliament==
Tarleton first stood as a Whig candidate for Liverpool in the 1784 general election. He was narrowly defeated by Richard Pennant as the second MP of this borough constituency. In the 1790 general election Pennant was ahead in the poll, but withdrew in favour of Tarleton. With the exception of a single year, Tarleton was re-elected to the House of Commons until 1812. Throughout his tenure in Parliament, he generally voted with the Parliamentary opposition. He was also a supporter of Charles James Fox despite their opposing views on the British role in the American War of Independence.

Tarleton was known for speaking on military matters as well as opposing abolition of the slave trade. Thorne wrote &quot;most of his speeches in his first two sessions in the House assailed the &#x27;mistaken philanthropy&#x27; of abolishing the slave trade, which Liverpool Members were instructed to oppose.&quot;

== Appointments ==
He was appointed governor of Berwick and Holy Island in 1808.

On 23 January 1816, he was made a baronet; and in 1820 a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB).

== Personal life ==
Tarleton had a 15-year relationship with the actress and writer Mary Robinson, known as Perdita, the character she played to much acclaim. She was an ex-mistress of the Prince of Wales (future King George IV). Tarleton and Robinson had no children; in 1783 Robinson had a miscarriage. She was important to his parliamentary career, writing many of his speeches.

Tarleton ultimately married Susan Bertie, the young, illegitimate and wealthy daughter of the 4th Duke of Ancaster in 1798. Tarleton had no children with Bertie. Tarleton did however, father an illegitimate daughter in 1797, prior to his marriage. The child was named Banina Georgina (1797–1818), her mother being named simply as Kolina.

==Death==
Tarleton died in January 1833, at Leintwardine, Herefordshire.

== Legacy ==
=== Tarleton helmet ===

During the American War of Independence, Tarleton made popular a leather helmet with antique style applications and a fur plume (woolen for lower ranks) protruding far into the upper front side. It was based on the Continental European dragoon helmet that became popular in several other armies before it fell out of fashion. Sir Joshua Reynolds&#x27; portrait of Tarleton shows him wearing the helmet; it was worn by all ranks in the British Legion. Royal Horse Artillery troops wore the helmet until the end of the Napoleonic Wars, as did light dragoon regiments from about 1796 to 1812.

===Auction of captured battle flags===
In 2006, four Patriot regimental colours captured by Tarleton in 1779 and 1780 were auctioned by Sotheby&#x27;s in New York City. The flags sold for US$17.3 million at auction on Flag Day in the United States on 14 June 2006.

These battleflags are the last American Revolutionary War colours known to remain in British hands and the last such colours to remain in private hands anywhere. Banastre Tarleton bequeathed the trophies to his nephew Thomas Tarleton. They had remained in the family for nearly 250 years.

Lot 1 was the colour of the 2nd Continental Light Dragoons (Sheldon’s Dragoons), captured by the British Legion at Pound Ridge on 2 July 1779. It is the earliest surviving American flag of any kind with thirteen horizontal red and white stripes. Including its silver metallic fringe, the silk flag is 35 1/8 inches (hoist) x 38 ¾ inches (fly). In the centre, there is a square of red silk bordered in gold and black. On it is a painted badge of a winged dark storm cloud from which ten gold and orange thunderbolts are emanating. Below that is the motto “PAT:A CONCITA  FULM:NT NATI.”(roughly translated, “When their country calls, her sons answer in tones of thunder.”)

Lot 2 was the complete stand of three regimental colours of the 3rd Virginia Detachment. The British Legion, commanded by Tarleton, captured them at the Battle of Waxhaws on 29 May 1780. They are the only remaining intact stand of colours from the Revolution. The 50¼ inches (hoist) x 45 3/8 inches (fly) regimental flag is the oldest surviving American flag having a canton of five-pointed stars. It is of gold silk painted with a beaver felling a palmetto tree. Below that is the motto “Perseverando”. At the upper hoist is a blue silk canton with thirteen stars. It is very similar to No. 7 described in the 1778 inventory &quot;A Return of ye New Standards &amp; Division Colours for ye Army of ye United States of America In Possession of Major Jonathan Gostelowe, Comy. Mily. Stores.&quot;

=== Places named for Banastre Tarleton ===

* A house at the site of the skirmish in Easttown Township after the Battle of Brandywine came to be known as &quot;Tarleton.&quot; A school later based there was also named Tarleton.
* The &quot;General Tarleton Inn&quot; in Ferrensby, North Yorkshire, is named after him.
* A street, still in existence, was named for Banastre Tarleton—others for Howe and Rawdon—in Freetown, the Sierra Leone colony established by former slaves.

=== Representation in other media ===

* In the 1835 novel &quot;Horse-Shoe Robinson&quot; by John Pendleton Kennedy, a historical romance set against the Southern campaigns in the American War of Independence, fictional characters interact with the historic figure of Tarleton. He is depicted as a forceful martial character, sensitive to the duties of honour and chivalry.
* In the 1959–1961 American Disney television series &quot;The Swamp Fox&quot;, John Sutton portrayed Colonel Banastre Tarleton to Leslie Nielsen’s Francis Marion.
* In the novel &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Eagle&quot; by Bernard Cornwell (the first in the Richard Sharpe series), the novel&#x27;s main antagonist, Colonel Sir Henry Simmerson is said to be a cousin of Tarleton. He relies on his cousin&#x27;s political connections to support his position.
* In the 1986 film &quot;Sweet Liberty&quot; Tarleton is played by actor Michael Caine and portrayed to the history professor Michael Burgess&#x27; (Alan Alda) dismay as a romantic, dashing hero.
* In the 2000 film &quot;The Patriot&quot;, the fictitious Colonel William Tavington (played by Jason Isaacs) was based on Tarleton.
* In the 2006 film &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, Tarleton is played by Ciarán Hinds and is portrayed as a leading opponent of William Wilberforce’s abolition bill.

== Perceptions ==

Numerous tales about Tarleton exist, mostly to show him in a bad light. Verified facts are included in the biographical information above. Widespread but dubious stories are discussed here.

=== Slave Trade ===

Banastre Tarleton was not engaged in the slave trade. As a child in Liverpool, he benefited from his father’s mercantile business, which included chartering ships, some of which carried slaves. But, as an adult, he did not join the business.

Tarleton is not listed by the Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slavery, which is based at University College London, nor by the Slave Voyages database, begun at Emory University, now hosted at Rice University. Furthermore, unlike many of the Patriots he fought, Banastre Tarleton never owned slaves.

Nevertheless, after his election to Parliament in 1790, Tarleton often spoke against the abolition of the slave trade: &quot;most of his speeches in his first two sessions in the House assailed the &#x27;mistaken philanthropy&#x27; of abolishing the slave trade, which Liverpool Members were instructed to oppose.&quot;

=== Wounds ===

Lee claimed to have wounded Tarleton in Pennsylvania. William Washington was said to have wounded him at the Battle of Cowpens. Tilden reported that Tarleton had been wounded during the siege of Yorktown. According to Tarleton&#x27;s history of his service, he was only wounded once, at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. While his maimed hand was disguised in his famous portrait, he proudly showed it in politics as evidence of having served his country.

=== Raiders ===

The British Legion is occasionally referred to as “Tarleton’s Raiders“ in modern American sources. However, during its service in the American War of Independence, the British Legion was most often called Tarleton’s Legion. Lawrence Babits wrote of the unit’s formation:

Modern historians also use that name. For example, in Cavalry of the American Revolution, Jim Piecuch says “Dockerty’s statement provides clear evidence of Americans switching sides in the South and Continentals enlisting in Tarleton’s Legion.” In the same book, Scott Miskimon wrote “Before the Americans could bridle a single horse, Tarleton’s Legion charged…”

Thomas Raddall, the prolific writer on historical subjects, said of the British Legion: 

Only after the American Civil War was the British Legion sometimes called “Tarleton’s Raiders“ by analogy with some Confederate units of that war. Knight explained:

=== Epithets ===

In the United States, Banastre Tarleton is often disparaged as “Bloody Tarleton” or “Bloody Ban” in modern histories. But this label wasn’t used by his contemporaries. Scotti searched fruitlessly for examples of “Bloody Tarleton” before the twentieth century. He concluded “with some degree of certainty” that Robert Bass was an early writer to use the term. John Pancake varied it to “Bloody Ban” in 1985. Later, Scotti elaborated:

Knight agreed with that origin, saying
and
=== Social rejection by American officers ===

Several writers have said that, after the surrender, Tarleton was the sole British senior officer not invited to dinner with any American officers. Where a source is given, it is the 1860 book of George Washington Parke Custis, a step-grandson of General Washington. Custis wrote “Colonel Tarleton…was left out in the invitations to headquarters.” He bases this on an alleged meeting between Tarleton and Lieutenant Colonel John Laurens about military etiquette. Scotti searched many sources, in particular the writing of Laurens and the Marquis de La Fayette, to whom Custis claimed Tarleton first complained. He found no indication that any such meeting took place and considers the incident to be apocryphal. Supporting Scotti&#x27;s conclusion, a 1978 book about the end of the war, “The Campaign That Won America: The Story of Yorktown”, authored by Burke Davis, mentions only that “all the ranking British and German officers were invited”.

<doc id="654413" wikidata="Q397789" url="?curid=654413" title="Aguada, Puerto Rico">
<text>Aguada (; , ), originally San Francisco de Asís de la Aguada, is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico, located in the northwestern coastal valley region bordering the Atlantic Ocean, east of Rincón, south of Aguadilla, west of Moca; and north of Añasco and Mayagüez. It is part of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebastián Metropolitan Statistical Area. Aguada&#x27;s population is spread over 17 barrios and Aguada Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city).

== Etymology and nicknames ==
The name &quot;Aguada&quot; is a shortening of the town&#x27;s original name &quot;San Francisco de Asís de la Aguada.&quot; The word &quot;aguada&quot; literally translates to &quot;watery&quot; or &quot;watered down&quot; from Spanish, possibly a reference to the town&#x27;s strategic importance as a port in the Mona Passage and the Atlantic Ocean.

The municipality has many nicknames: &quot;La Villa de Sotomayor&quot; (&quot;Sotomayor&#x27;s Villa&quot;) is a reference to one of the town&#x27;s Spanish founders, Cristóbal de Sotomayor; &quot;La Ciudad del Descubrimiento&quot; (&quot;City of the Discovery&quot;) is a reference to the possibility that Christopher Columbus first landed in Puerto Rico at what is today the municipality&#x27;s territory; &quot;El Pueblo Playero&quot; translates to &quot;the beach town&quot; and &quot;La Ciudad del Vaticano&quot; (&quot;the Vatican&#x27;s City&quot;) which references the town&#x27;s early importance for Catholicism in the island.

==History==
A Taíno settlement called &quot;Aymamón&quot; was located close to the Culebrinas River.

&quot;Bahía de Aguada (Aguada Bay)&quot; in Aguada has historically been recognized as the location where Christopher Columbus first landed in Puerto Rico during his second voyage on 19 November 1493. However, it is believed by most historians that &quot;Bahía de Añasco (Añasco Bay)&quot; in the neighboring town of Añasco was the place of Columbus’ first landing and stay of two days in Puerto Rico before continuing to La Navidad, first European settlement in the Americas, in Haiti in Hispaniola. 

In July 1510, Cristóbal de Sotomayor received control of the area from Juan Ponce de León and renamed the town &quot;Villa de Sotomayor (Sotomayor Village)&quot;. However, in 1511 the settlement was attacked and burned by the local Taínos. That same year, the Spanish crown ordered a monastery be established in Puerto Rico, and the &quot;Ermita de Espinar&quot; was founded. The name of the area was then changed to &quot;San Francisco de Asís de la Aguada&quot;, since the friars were Franciscan. The monastery was finished in 1516. 

In 1526, King Charles I of Spain officially founded the Aguada settlement. However, in 1529, Taínos attacked the monastery killing the friars and burning the settlement. The Taínos, indigenous people of Puerto Rico, were believed to have practiced polytheism. As the Spanish began to colonize the Caribbean area, they wanted to convert the natives to Catholicism. The Caribs destroyed a church of Franciscans in Aguada and killed five of its members in 1579.

Still, Aguada resurfaced and became a stopover point for ships on their way to Spain from South America. On September 17, 1692, King Charles II of Spain emitted a Royal Decree declaring Aguada a &quot;village&quot; and assigning Captain Juan López de Segura as War Lieutenant and Ordinary Mayor of the &quot;Villa de San Francisco de Asís de la Aguada.&quot;

In 1737, Philip V, King of Spain, declared that all mail en route to Venezuela and other South American countries from Puerto Rico should exit from Aguada&#x27;s ports, leading to the area&#x27;s economic growth. Also, an increase in population has been attributed to possible desertions from foreign merchant ships.

Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Aguada was 10,581.

In the early years of the 20th century, two disasters affected the town of Aguada. First, a huge fire in 1912 destroyed most of the town buildings, including the old city hall, which contained all the city archives. On October 11, 1918, at an earthquake known as the San Fermín earthquake destroyed the church and other structures. At Rio Culebrinas, 1000 kg blocks of limestone from the wrecked Columbus monument were carried inland to distances of by waves high.

Hurricane María on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Aguada, with its strong winds and heavy rain. Infrastructure and an estimated 8,000 homes in Aguada were damaged or destroyed. Two police officers died when they were caught in the flooded Culebrinas River.

On July 16, 2023 a tornado touched down in Aguada, producing EF1 damage which included tearing a roof from a house and damage to power lines. The city is notorious for stormy weather. 

===Folklore===

 (The Aguada Shark Killer) is folklore that comes out of Aguada and was written around 1640. It tells of a young man who was accustomed to fighting sharks but was without his religious charm. When asked to demonstrate his shark-fighting capabilities to visiting Spanish dignitaries, he hesitated. All day and night he pondered whether he could fight a shark without his religious charm. Even though the Spaniards had increased their offer to 3 bars of gold the matador was hesitant. In the morning, as the shark came into the bay, the spectators who were gathered on the beach yelled in anticipation, and , as the young man was called, was unable to stop himself. He jumped into the open sea pursuing the shark and fought it with his bare hands. He was nearly killed and after receiving his prize of gold, vowed to never again fight a shark.

==Geography==
Aguada is located in the west coast of the island of Puerto Rico. It borders the Atlantic Ocean and Aguadilla on the north, Moca on the east, Añasco on the south, and Rincón on the west. Aguada is part of the Coastal Plains of the West, which features alluvial and fertile terrain. Although the terrain is mostly plain, there are some mountains to the south and southeast.

Among the mountains located in Aguada are the Atalaya Peak, located within the limits of Aguada and Rincón. Also, San Francisco Mountain, which is popularly known as the birth point of the Cordillera Central, and Cerro Gordo, peaking at .

===Water features===
Aguada&#x27;s hydrographic system is composed of the Río Culebrinas, Río Grande, Río Cañas, Río Culebra, Río Guayabo, and Río Ingenio. All of these rivers flow into the Mona Passage. According to a news article by Primera Hora, there are ten beaches in Aguada. Aguada has an area of 45.55 square miles and 14.62% are water bodies.

The types of &quot;sectores&quot; may vary, from normally &quot;sector&quot; to &quot;urbanización&quot; to &quot;reparto&quot; to &quot;barriada&quot; to &quot;residencial&quot;, among others.

===Special Communities ===

 (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion. A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Aguada: and in Guanaquilla barrio, in , and .

Although the precise location is disputed, the Aguada wells () is a plausible site for the actual event.

<text>Aguas Buenas (, ), popularly known as &quot;&quot;La Ciudad de las Aguas Claras&quot; or &quot;The City of Clear Waters&quot;&quot;, is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the Central Mountain Range, north of Cidra, south of Bayamón, Guaynabo and San Juan; east of Comerio; and north-west of Caguas. Aguas Buenas is spread over 9 &quot;barrios&quot; and Aguas Buenas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== Etymology and nicknames ==
The name &quot;Aguas Buenas&quot; translates to &quot;good waters&quot;. The town&#x27;s and municipality&#x27;s original names were Aguabuena (&quot;good water&quot;), originally a barrio or district of Caguas, and Aguas Claras (&quot;clear waters&quot;). These names and some of the municipality&#x27;s nicknames such as &quot;Ciudad de las Aguas Claras&quot; (&quot;city of clear waters&quot;) and &quot;Oasis de Puerto Rico&quot; (&quot;Puerto Rico&#x27;s oasis&quot;) are a reference to the number of natural water springs that can be found in the municipality, particularly those founds around the Aguas Buenas Cave and Caverns System Nature Reserve (Spanish: &quot;Reserva Natural Sistema de Cuevas y Cavernas de Aguas Buenas&quot;). In addition to &quot;aguasbonenses&quot;, citizens and residents of Aguas Buenas are often referred to as Mulos (&quot;mules&quot;) or Ñocos (&quot;amputees&quot;).

== History ==
Aguas Buenas was originally a sector of Caguas known as &quot;Aguabuena&quot;. In 1798, a group of residents started establishing their houses near some of the rivers in the area and started calling the sector &quot;Aguas Claras&quot;.

The quantity of residents incremented with time and on July 25, 1832, they organized a meeting and commissioned Francisco de Salas Torres and Ramón Díaz to do the necessary arrangements for the region to be declared a municipality. A resident, Julian López, offered part of his estate to be used for the construction of a town square, a church, the city hall, and the priest house.

The town was officially founded on May 25, 1838, and the name was changed to &quot;Aguas Buenas&quot;. Francisco de Salas Torres was declared the first mayor. Initially, the economy of the town relied on coffee plantations and commerce. At the end of the 19th century, the town&#x27;s population was close to 7,000.
