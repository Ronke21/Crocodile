<text>Donald Franciszek Tusk (born 22 April 1957) is a Polish politician and historian who has served as the prime minister of Poland since 2023, previously holding the office from 2007 to 2014. From 2014 to 2019 Tusk was President of the European Council, and from 2019 to 2022 he was the president of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). He co-founded the Civic Platform (PO) party in 2001 and has been its longtime leader, first from 2003 to 2014 and again since 2021.

Tusk has been officially involved in Polish politics since 1989, having co-founded multiple political parties, such as the free market–oriented Liberal Democratic Congress party (KLD). He first entered the Sejm in 1991 but lost his seat in 1993. In 1994, the KLD merged with the Democratic Union to form the Freedom Union. In 1997, Tusk was elected to the Senate and became its deputy marshal. In 2001, he co-founded another centre-right liberal conservative party, the PO, and was again elected to the Sejm, becoming its deputy marshal. Tusk stood unsuccessfully for President of Poland in the 2005 election and would also suffer defeat in the 2005 Polish parliamentary election.

Leading the PO to victory at the 2007 parliamentary election, he was appointed prime minister, and scored a second victory in the 2011 election, becoming the first Polish prime minister to be re-elected since the fall of communism in 1989. In 2014, he left Polish politics to accept appointment as president of the European Council. The Civic Platform would lose control of both the presidency and parliament to the rival Law and Justice (PiS) party in the 2015 Polish parliamentary election and 2015 Polish presidential election. Tusk was President of the European Council until 2019; although initially remaining in Brussels as leader of the EPP, he later returned to Polish politics in 2021, becoming leader of the Civic Platform again. In the 2023 election, his Civic Coalition won 157 seats in the Sejm to become the second-largest bloc in the chamber. Following the President-appointed Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki&#x27;s failure to secure a vote of confidence on 11 December, Tusk was elected by the Sejm to become prime minister for a third time. His cabinet was sworn in on 13 December, ending eight years of government by the PiS party.

Having been the longest-serving prime minister of the Third Republic, Tusk oversaw in his first term the reduction and digitization of the public sector, wishing to present himself as a pragmatic liberal realist and technocrat. In the lead-up to the co-organization by Poland of Euro 2012, he invested strongly in infrastructure, expanding the highway network at the cost of the rail sector. In his second term, various scandals, unfulfilled promises and a cooling of the economy in 2012–2014 as a result of his European debt crisis-related austerity policies led to a drop in public support. In the landscape dominated by the PiS after its electoral victories, as an influential holdout he opposed what he considered its democratic backsliding. Returning to power in 2023, he has focused on improving the rule of law and warming up relations between Poland and the EU. Since then, as PM, Tusk has continued aid to Ukraine after the Russian invasion. In 2024, he surprised the public with his appropriation of right-wing themes, such as opposition to illegal migration, prioritizing border security, going as far as to suspend the right of asylum for those who cross the Belarus–Poland border illegally.

==Early life==
Tusk was born in Gdańsk in northern Poland. He has Polish, German (maternal grandmother) and Kashubian (Donald Tusk describes himself as a Pole, Kashubian and European) ancestry. His father, Donald Tusk senior (1929–1972), was a carpenter whilst his mother, Ewa (née Dawidowska) Tusk (1934–2009), was a nurse. His maternal grandmother&#x27;s language was Danzig German. His paternal grandfather, Józef Tusk (1907–1987), was a railway official who around 1941–1942 was imprisoned at the Neuengamme concentration camp; in 1944, as a former citizen of the Free City of Danzig, he was forcibly conscripted by German authorities into the Wehrmacht. After four months, he deserted and joined the Polish Armed Forces in the West.

Tusk has described the city of his youth as &quot;a typical frontier town&quot; with &quot;many borders ... between ethnicities.&quot; This, together with his Kashubian ethnic ancestry and multilingual family, meant that he grew up with an awareness that &quot;nothing is simple in life or in history,&quot; which informed his adult political view that it is &quot;best to be immune to every kind of orthodoxy, of ideology and most importantly, nationalism.&quot; He has described his young life under communism as &quot;so hopeless&quot; due to the boredom and monotony, with &quot;no hope for anything to change.&quot; His young self was a &quot;typical hooligan&quot; who often got into fights – &quot;we would roam the streets, you know, cruising for a bruising.&quot;

Tusk credits his interest in politics to watching clashes between striking workers and riot police when he was a teenager. He enrolled at the University of Gdańsk to study history, and graduated in 1980. While studying, he was active in the Student Committee of Solidarity, a group that opposed Poland&#x27;s communist rule at the time.

==Early political career==
Tusk was one of the founders of the Liberal Democratic Congress (Kongres Liberalno-Demokratyczny KLD), which in the 1991 elections won 37 seats in the lower house of parliament. The KLD later merged with the Democratic Union (UD) to become the Freedom Union (UW). Tusk became deputy chairman of the new party, and was elected to the Senate in the next election in 1997. In 2001, he co-founded Civic Platform, and became deputy speaker in parliament after the party won seats in the year&#x27;s election.

==2005 Polish presidential election==
In the shade of the upcoming expiration of President Aleksander Kwaśniewski&#x27;s second term and his inability to stand for a third term, Tusk and Lech Kaczyński were the leading candidates for the presidential elections. Although both leading candidates came from the center-right, and their two parties had planned to form a coalition government following the parliamentary elections on 25 September, there were important differences between Tusk and Kaczyński. Tusk wanted to enforce a separation of church and state, favoured rapid European integration and supported a free-market economy. Kaczyński was very socially conservative, a soft Eurosceptic, and supported state intervention. Such differences led to the failure of POPiS coalition talks in late October. Jacek Protasiewicz headed his electoral campaign staff. Tusk&#x27;s campaign motto was &quot;President Tusk – A man with principles; We will be proud of Poland.&quot; In the election, Tusk received 36.6% of votes in the first round and then faced Kaczyński, who got 33.1% of votes in the first round.

In the second round, Tusk was defeated by Kaczyński.

One controversy during the election was the accusation that Tusk&#x27;s grandfather, Józef Tusk, had been a Nazi collaborator during WWII, having served in the German Wehrmacht during the war. The controversy, according to the BBC, &quot;is believed to have influenced some voters negatively.&quot;

==First Premiership (2007–2014)==
Tusk and his Civic Platform party emerged victorious in the 2007 Polish parliamentary election, defeating incumbent Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński&#x27;s Law and Justice party with about 42% of the vote to Law and Justice&#x27;s 32%. Tusk and his assembled cabinet were sworn in on 16 November, as he became the fourteenth prime minister of the Third Polish Republic.

In the 2011 Polish parliamentary election, Civic Platform retained their Parliamentary majority, giving Tusk a second term as prime minister and making him Poland&#x27;s first PM to win reelection since the fall of communism. In September 2014, leaders of the European Union voted unanimously by selecting Tusk as Herman van Rompuy&#x27;s successor for President of the European Council, which gave Poland its first European leadership position since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Tusk resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by Marshal of the Sejm Ewa Kopacz.

===Domestic policy===
During the 2007 parliamentary election campaign and initially, when he entered office, Tusk promised to continue the free market policies, streamline the bureaucracy, enact long-term stable governance, cut taxes to attract greater foreign business ventures, encourage Polish citizens living overseas to return to Poland, and privatize state-owned companies. Later in office, Tusk changed his views on the role of taxation in the functioning of the state and his government never cut any taxes. Instead, it raised VAT from 22% to 23% in 2011, increased the tax imposed on diesel oil, alcohol, tobacco and coal, and eliminated many tax exemptions. The number of people employed in public administration also grew considerably. By 2012, the value of foreign investments in Poland had not matched the peak level attained in 2006–07, before Tusk entered office. The number of Poles living abroad in 2013 was almost the same level as in 2007.

During his government, Tusk oversaw the austerity programme.

The construction of a more adequate and larger national road network in preparation for the UEFA 2012 football championships was a stated priority for Tusk&#x27;s government. On 27 October 2009, Tusk declared that he wanted to ban gambling partially. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, Tusk defended his government&#x27;s decision not to purchase swine flu vaccine, citing the lack of testing by pharmaceutical companies and its unavailability to be purchased freely through the market. Tusk criticized other nations&#x27; responses to the pandemic. &quot;The eagerness of some countries seems to be excessive and disproportionate to the real epidemiological situation,&quot; Tusk stated, referring to the pandemic&#x27;s relatively low fatality rate.

Tusk is moderately conservative on social issues. He is opposed to legalizing abortion on demand, believing that current Polish legislation on abortion at that time (which allowed for legal abortion only when the pregnancy threatens the woman&#x27;s life or health, when the fetus is seriously malformed, and when the pregnancy results from rape or incest) protected human life best. Tusk has publicly stated that he opposes euthanasia.

In June 2022, Tusk changed his stance on abortion, supporting a bill that would legalize abortion up to 12 weeks.

===Foreign policy===

In foreign policy, Tusk sought to improve relations severely damaged during the previous Kaczyński government, particularly with Germany and Russia. While he criticized the words of German politician Erika Steinbach with regard to her opinion over the expulsion of Germans from Poland following World War II, Tusk has stressed the need for warm relations with Berlin. Tusk also advocated a more realistic relationship with Moscow, especially in regard to energy policy. Under Tusk&#x27;s premiership, Russian bans on Polish meat and agricultural products were lifted, while Poland reversed its official policy of disagreement on a European Union-Russian partnership agreement.

During a speech delivered to the Sejm in the first weeks of his premiership, Tusk outlined a proposal to withdraw military units from Iraq, stating that &quot;we will conduct this operation keeping in mind that our commitment to our ally, the United States, has been lived up to and exceeded.&quot; The last Polish military units completed their withdrawal in October 2008.

In regard to U.S. plans of hosting missile defense shield bases in the country, Tusk hinted skepticism toward the project, saying that their presence could potentially increase security risks from Russia, and rejected U.S. offers in early July 2008. By August, however, Tusk relented, and supported the missile shield, declaring: &quot;We have achieved the main goal. It means our countries, Poland and the United States will be more secure.&quot; Following President Barack Obama&#x27;s decision to scrap and revise missile defense strategy, Tusk described the move as &quot;a chance to strengthen Polish-US co-operation in defense...&quot; He said: &quot;I took this declaration from President Obama very seriously and with great satisfaction.&quot;

Tusk announced that Polish soldiers would not take military action in Libya, although he voiced support for the 2011 military intervention in Libya and pledged to offer logistical support.

Contrary to the condemnation of foreign governments and the leadership of the European Union, Tusk supported Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán in his efforts of implementing a new controversial constitution. Tusk stated that the Hungarian constitution&#x27;s democratic controversies were &quot;exaggerated&quot; and that Hungary had &quot;a European level standard of democracy.&quot; Tusk&#x27;s support for the Hungarian government garnered a rare show of solidarity with the opposition Law and Justice, which also publicly displayed support for Orbán&#x27;s efforts.

In early 2012, Tusk announced his support for committing Poland to signing the international Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). In response, websites for the Chancellery, Sejm and Presidency were hacked in mid-January. Following Anonymous&#x27;s claim of responsibility for the web attack, Tusk remained undeterred by internet protests, authorising the Polish ambassador in Japan to sign the agreement, yet promised that final legislation in the Sejm would not go ahead without assurances regarding freedom to access the Internet. Despite the government&#x27;s guarantees, mass protests erupted in late January, with demonstrations held in Warsaw, Kraków, Wrocław and Kielce. Further web attacks were reported on the website of Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski.

====European policy====

In continental policy, Tusk strongly supported greater political and economic integration within the European Union, strongly backing the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty, standing in stark contrast to President Lech Kaczyński&#x27;s vehement opposition. Tusk repeatedly stated his government&#x27;s intention in bringing Poland into the Eurozone. Originally wanting to introduce the euro by 2012, Tusk envisaged in 2009 a starting year of 2015 as &quot;a realistic and not overly-ambitious goal.&quot; However, during the European sovereign debt crisis, Tusk and his government displayed less optimism in joining the monetary union under contemporary economic circumstances, leading to Finance Minister Jan Vincent-Rostowski calling any move &quot;unthinkable.&quot; Despite not being a member of the eurozone, Tusk pressed that Poland, along with the other non-eurozone states of the EU, should be included in future euro financial negotiations.

Between July and December 2011, Poland under Tusk&#x27;s government presided over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Under its presidency tenure, Poland supported and welcomed Croatia&#x27;s entry into the European Union through the Treaty of Accession 2011.

While being a constituent member of the Weimar Triangle with fellow states Germany and France, Tusk showed displeasure over German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#x27;s and French President Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s dominating roles in eurozone negotiations, remarking to Italian newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; in January 2012 that &quot;this should not translate into a lasting political monopoly: things cannot be left to only two capitals of Europe.&quot;

===Constitutional reform===

After being elected prime minister, relations between Tusk and President Lech Kaczyński were often acrimonious due to different political ideologies and the constitutional role of the presidency. Using presidential veto powers, Kaczyński blocked legislation drafted by the Tusk government, including pension reform, agricultural and urban zoning plans, and restructuring state television.

In his premiership, Tusk has proposed various reforms to the Polish constitution. In 2009, Tusk proposed changes to the power of the presidency, by abolishing the presidential veto. &quot;The president should not have veto power. People make their decision in elections and then state institutions should not be in conflict,&quot; said Tusk. Tusk again reiterated his desire for constitutional reform in February 2010, proposing that the presidential veto be overridden by a simple parliamentary majority rather than through a three-fifths vote. &quot;Presidential veto could not effectively block the will of the majority in parliament, which won elections and formed the government,&quot; stated Tusk. Further constitutional reforms proposed by Tusk include reducing the Sejm from a membership of 460 to 300, &quot;not only because of its savings, but also the excessive number of members&#x27; causes blurring certain plans and projects.&quot; Similarly, Tusk proposed radical changes to the Senate, preferring to abolish the upper house altogether, yet due to constitutional concerns and demands from the junior coalition Polish People&#x27;s Party partner, Tusk proposed reducing the Senate from 100 to 49, while including former presidents to sit in the Senate for political experience and expertise in state matters. Parliamentary immunity for all members of the Sejm and Senate would also be stripped, except for in special situations. In addition, Tusk proposed that the prime minister&#x27;s role in foreign policy decisions would be greatly expanded. By decreasing the president&#x27;s role in governance, executive power would further be concentrated in the prime minister, directly responsible to the cabinet and Sejm, as well as avoiding confusion over Poland&#x27;s representation at international or EU summits. The opposition conservative Law and Justice party deeply criticized Tusk&#x27;s constitutional reform proposals, opting in opposing legislation for the presidency to garner greater power over the prime minister.

In an interview with the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in January 2010, Tusk was asked if he considered running again as Civic Platform&#x27;s candidate for that year&#x27;s presidential election. Tusk replied that although the presidential election typically drew the most voters to the polls and remained Poland&#x27;s most high-profiled race, the presidency had little political power outside of the veto, and preferred to remain as prime minister. While not formally excluding his candidacy, Tusk declared that &quot;I would very much like to continue to work in the government and Civic Platform, because that seems to me to be the key element in ensuring success in the civilizational race in which we are engaged.&quot; A day after the interview, Tusk formally announced his intention of staying as prime minister, allowing his party to choose another candidate (and eventual winner), Bronisław Komorowski.

==President of the European Council (2014–2019)==

Tusk succeeded Herman Van Rompuy as President of the European Council on 1 December 2014. After assuming office, Tusk worked to promote a unified European response to Russia&#x27;s military intervention in Ukraine. Tusk made attempts to co-ordinate the EU&#x27;s response to the European migrant crisis, and warned illegal economic migrants not to come to Europe.
Ahead of the UK&#x27;s EU membership referendum Tusk warned of dire consequences should the UK vote to leave. After the UK voted to leave, he pursued a hard line on the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union stating that the country&#x27;s only real alternative to a &quot;hard Brexit&quot; is &quot;no Brexit.&quot; In September 2018, he caused controversy after his official Instagram account posted an image of himself handing a slice of cake to British Prime Minister Theresa May, with the caption &quot;A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries.&quot; In 2018, Tusk opposed the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany.

On 31 January 2017, Tusk wrote an open letter to 27 EU heads of state or government on the future of the EU before the Malta summit. In this letter, he stated the Trump administration presented a threat to the EU on a par with a newly assertive China, an aggressive Russia and &quot;wars, terror and anarchy in the Middle East and Africa.&quot;

On 9 March 2017, Tusk was re-elected for a second term to run until 30 November 2019. He received 27 of 28 votes; the one vote against him came from Beata Szydło, the Prime Minister of Poland. Tusk&#x27;s actions in the wake of the 2010 plane crash that killed then-Polish President Lech Kaczyński provoked opposition from Poland&#x27;s governing right-wing party—critics said that Tusk&#x27;s centrist government did not sufficiently investigate the cause of the crash. Szydło refused to sign the EU statement issued at the end of the council&#x27;s meeting in protest at Tusk&#x27;s reelection, though other EU leaders spoke in favor of him; Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands called him &quot;a very good president,&quot; and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and German chancellor Angela Merkel both made statements supporting the vote. Donald Tusk maintains there will be no winners from Brexit and the two years following the triggering of Article 50 will be a time of damage limitation.

In February 2018, Tusk urged Turkey &quot;to avoid threats or actions against any EU member and instead commit to good neighbourly relations, peaceful dispute settlement and respect for territorial sovereignty.&quot; Tusk also expressed concern over the Turkish invasion of northern Syria in 2018. In response to the death of Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died of organ failure while in government custody, Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker said in a joint statement that they had learned of Liu&#x27;s death &quot;with deep sadness.&quot;

On 6 February 2019, Tusk held talks with Irish Premier Leo Varadkar in Brussels to discuss Britain&#x27;s departure from the European Union, stating that there was a &quot;special place in Hell for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.&quot; Tusk opened his statement by saying there were 50 days to go until the UK&#x27;s exit from the EU: &quot;I know that still a very great number of people in the UK, and on the continent, as well as in Ireland, wish for a reversal of this decision. I have always been with you, with all my heart. But the facts are unmistakable. At the moment, the pro-Brexit stance of the UK Prime Minister, and the Leader of the Opposition, rules out this question. Today, there is no political force and no effective leadership for Remain. I say this without satisfaction, but you can&#x27;t argue with the facts.&quot;

On 24 August 2019 in Biarritz for the G7 Summit, Tusk addressed reporters regarding Brexit, stating &quot;one thing I will not cooperate on is no deal.&quot; He also said he hoped that Boris Johnson would not go down in history as &quot;Mr No Deal.&quot; In September 2019, Tusk said that the EU should open accession talks with both Albania and North Macedonia.

Tusk condemned the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria. He reprimanded Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for threatening to send millions of Syrian refugees to Europe and denounced the Turkish operation in northern Syria as destabilizing the region, which he demanded to halt.

Writing of his tenure as President of the European Council, LSE political scientist Sara Hagemann said &quot;he set the tone for a liberal and progressive agenda at a time of significant threat from populist and pro-Russian voices in Europe.&quot;

== Second premiership (2023–present) ==
===Return to Polish politics===

In July 2021, Donald Tusk returned to Warsaw, re-engaging actively in Polish politics as leader of Civic Platform. As of May 2022, Tusk was among the leading choices among opposition figures for the potential future prime minister role, according to a public poll. However, his overall net approval among the general population was reported as −24.4% in the same period. During his campaign, Tusk advocated for enhanced LGBT rights.

=== 2023 Polish parliamentary election ===
In the 2023 Polish parliamentary election, Tusk&#x27;s Civic Coalition finished as the second-largest bloc in the Sejm. Between them, Civic Coalition and two other opposition parties, Third Way and New Left, took 54% of the vote, winning enough seats to allow them to take power. On 10 November, Civic Coalition, New Left, the Polish People&#x27;s Party and Poland 2050 formally signed an agreement to support Tusk as their candidate for prime minister. President Andrzej Duda nominated PiS incumbent Mateusz Morawiecki for another term as prime minister. However, Morawiecki fell short of the support needed to stay in office, as PiS and its allies were 40 seats short of a majority. With this in mind, Tusk publicly announced the agreement before the new Sejm convened to show he and the opposition stood ready to govern. Morawiecki&#x27;s cabinet was sworn in on 27 November, but was widely expected to lose a confidence vote. Under the constitution, if Morawiecki did not win a confidence vote within two weeks of being sworn in, the Sejm had the right to designate its own nominee for prime minister, and Duda was required to appoint the person so designated. On paper, the four parties who signed the agreement had the votes to designate Tusk as the Sejm&#x27;s candidate. Morawiecki&#x27;s cabinet lost a vote of confidence in the Sejm on 11 December by 190 votes to 266. The Sejm subsequently nominated Tusk as its candidate for prime minister, by 248 votes in favor and 201 against. Tusk&#x27;s cabinet was sworn in on 13 December.

=== Domestic policy ===

Tusk&#x27;s second time in office has been far less conciliatory than his first term. One of his first moves in office involved dismissing the top executives from Telewizja Polska (the nominally independent public service broadcaster), which had been, for years, &quot;a propaganda machine for the PiS government&quot;. The move caused a sit-in from PiS supporters at the Telewizja Polska office, and in a spat between Tusk and President Duda, ended with the liquidation of the channel following Duda vetoing funds for it in 2023. Stanley Bill, who serves as a professor of Polish Studies at the University of Cambridge, stated that his motive could have quite possibly been personal, due to the fact TVP had been demonizing him for years under the PiS government.

In February 2024, responding to protests by European farmers, Tusk said he would push for changes to the European Green Deal. In March 2024, he insisted that Poland would go its own way &quot;without European coercion&quot;. In January 2025, he blamed the European Green Deal for high energy prices in the EU.

Tusk also oversaw the arrests of both Mariusz Kamiński and Maciej Wąsik, who had both been on trial for exceeding authority since 2015. President Duda had issued pardons to both of them, and they had continued to serve as ministers and members of the Sejm as the trials proceeded. The pardons became embroiled in a legal battle due to the pardoning taking place before the final verdict for both. Ultimately, the Supreme Court of Poland ruled that the pardons were not valid due to it occurring before sentencing. Both MPs ultimately took refuge in the Presidential Palace in an attempt to have Duda shield them from conviction after it was ordered they be arrested and placed in solitary confinement. Still, police entered the palace and arrested the two men. The episode highlighted growing tensions between the prime minister and the president.

In April 2024, Tusk opposed EU&#x27;s New Pact on Migration and Asylum, stating &quot;we will protect Poland against the relocation mechanism&quot;.

In October 2024, Tusk announced plans to temporarily suspend the right of migrants to seek asylum in Poland, citing abuses by people smugglers aided by Belarus and Russia. The plan, which is part of the government&#x27;s new migration strategy, initially proved controversial but ultimately met with approval from other EU leaders.

In January 2025, Tusk supported proposals to reduce benefits for Ukrainian refugees in Poland.

=== Foreign policy ===

On 22 January 2024, Tusk arrived in Kyiv, Ukraine on a working visit and met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He said that all those who chose neutrality in the Russo-Ukrainian War and did not support Ukraine deserved &quot;the darkest place in political hell.&quot; Tusk called for the West&#x27;s &quot;full mobilization.&quot; Tusk has also worked to attempt to strengthen inter-European strength in the face of Russia, proclaiming that &quot;There is no reason for the EU to be weaker than Russia&quot;. This comes after a string of comments former president and 2024 candidate Donald Trump made saying that he would let Russia do &quot;whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO countries who do not satisfy spending commitments.

In May 2024, Tusk criticized the International Criminal Court&#x27;s arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alongside Hamas leaders, saying, &quot;An attempt to show that the prime minister of Israel and the leaders of terrorist organizations are the same, and the involvement of international institutions in this, is unacceptable.&quot; The leaders of Israel and Hamas are suspected of committing war crimes in the Israel–Hamas war in Gaza.

In August 2024, Tusk stated that Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the European Union would not be possible without resolving the issue of Polish victims of the Volhynian Genocide and their proper remembrance echoing the words of Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz spoken a few days before at a press conference. The Prime Minister&#x27;s statement came as a reaction to the then-Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba who suggested that this issue should be left to historians.

In January 2025, Tusk guaranteed safe passage for senior Israeli officials to travel to an event marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz concentration camp by Soviet troops, despite an arrest warrant issued for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by the International Criminal Court.

==Personal life==
Donald Tusk married Małgorzata Sochacka in 1978. They have two children: a son, Michał and a daughter, Katarzyna. His son, Michal Tusk, worked as a spokesman and consultant for the OLT Express airline, a subsidiary of Amber Gold. The business later turned out to be a pyramid scheme operated during Donald Tusk&#x27;s tenure as prime minister. In 2017, Michal was questioned by a Polish parliamentary commission as a witness.

Tusk belongs to the Kashubian minority in Poland. In an interview with the Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; in December 2008, Tusk compared his own family history to the Jewish experience, describing the Kashubian minority as a people who, &quot;like the Jews, are people who were born and live in border areas and were suspected by the Nazis and by the Communists of being disloyal&quot;.

Tusk speaks four languages: Polish, Kashubian, German, and English. In 2014, at the time he became President of the European Council, he was criticized for his poor English skills and lack of knowledge of French. However, he underwent extensive language classes in advance of assuming the role of president, and rapidly mastered English. In January 2019, Tusk gave a seven-minute speech only in Romanian at the Romanian Athenaeum in Bucharest at the ceremony that marked the beginning of Romania&#x27;s EU Council Presidency. His delivery received loud applause. On 12 December 2019, Tusk published his memoir &quot;Szczerze&quot; (&quot;Honestly&quot;), based on his five-year-term as President of the European Council, which became a bestseller in Poland. He assumed the office of the President of the European People&#x27;s Party on 1 December 2019, a day after leaving office as President of the European Council. On 1 June 2022 he stepped down from the position and was replaced by Manfred Weber.

Tusk&#x27;s religious views became a matter of a debate during his presidential campaign in 2005. To avoid further speculation, just before the presidential elections Tusk requested a Catholic marriage ceremony with his wife Małgorzata, whom he had married in a civil ceremony 27 years earlier.

==Honours and awards==
The Charlemagne Prize of the city of Aachen was awarded to Tusk on 13 May 2010 for his merits in the further unification of Europe and for his role as a &quot;patriot and great European.&quot; He dedicated the prize to the people killed in a plane crash of a Polish Air Force Tu-154 in April 2010 including the Polish president Lech Kaczyński. The eulogy was given by German chancellor Angela Merkel.

In May 2012, he received the Walther-Rathenau-Preis &quot;in recognition for his commitment to European integration during Poland&#x27;s Presidency of the Council of the EU in the second half of 2011 and for fostering Polish–German dialogue.&quot; In her speech German chancellor Merkel praised Tusk as &quot;a farsighted European.&quot; In the same year, he also received the European Prize for Political Culture. In December 2017, he was awarded an honorary doctorate at the University of Pécs, Hungary, in recognition of Tusk&#x27;s &quot;achievements as a Polish and European politician, which are strongly connected with Hungarian, regional and European history.&quot; On 16 December 2018, Tusk was awarded an honorary doctorate at the TU Dortmund University, Germany, &quot;in recognition of his services to European politics and his contribution to the debate on European values.&quot; In 2019, he was awarded an honorary doctorate at the University of Lviv, Ukraine, which he accepted on the fifth anniversary of the Revolution of Dignity.

<doc id="648726" wikidata="Q888960" url="?curid=648726" title="Osric of Hwicce">
<text>Osric was a king of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of the Hwicce in the late 7th century, perhaps reigning jointly with his presumed brother Oshere.

Osric was probably a son of Eanhere, a previous King of the Hwicce, by
Osthryth, daughter of Oswiu of Northumbria. The only marriage recorded for Osthryth is that to Æthelred of Mercia, but an earlier marriage to Eanhere would explain why Osric and his brother Oswald are described as Æthelred&#x27;s &quot;nepotes&quot; — usually translated as nephews or grandsons, but here probably meaning stepsons.

Osric is claimed as the founder of two monastic houses, one at Bath (now Bath Abbey) and the other at Gloucester (now Gloucester Cathedral). In 676 Osric granted lands to Abbess Bertana to found a convent at Bath. The charter attesting this grant has been queried on several grounds of later editing and interpolation, but probably has an authentic basis.

The foundation charter of Gloucester Abbey survives in a medieval register of the abbey. It is not straightforward, but again is considered to have an authentic basis. The charter was apparently issued in the 670s by Æthelred, king of Mercia, and records his grant of lands at Gloucester and Pershore to two of his thegns, noblemen of the Hwicce, Osric and his brother Oswald. Osric&#x27;s share was at Gloucester, and he sought permission from Æthelred to found a monastery there.

The story of the abbey&#x27;s foundation continues in the register with the claim that Osric granted the land for the abbey to his sister Kyneburge (Cyneburh), the first abbess. H.P.R. Finberg however speculates that the Cyneburh in question was the widow of Oswald of Northumbria. Oswald was the elder brother of Oswiu and therefore the uncle of Queen Osthryth, who is said to have encouraged her aunt Cyneburh to enter a nunnery many years after Oswald&#x27;s death. Cyneburgh would therefore be the great-aunt of Osric, rather than his sister.

Though the charter of Gloucester treats Osric as a subordinate of Æthelred, the charter of Bath describes him as king of the Hwicce. He is also so described by Bede.

He may possibly be the Osric who witnessed a doubtful charter of Frithuwold, King of Surrey, dated 675.

Osric was buried at Gloucester Abbey beside Cyneburh, before the altar of St Petronilla; his remains now lie in a medieval tomb in the cathedral.

He seems to have been survived by his brother Oshere, and succeeded by a possible son Æthelmod (mentioned in charter S 1167).

<doc id="648742" wikidata="Q4913168" url="?curid=648742" title="Billy Pilgrim (duo)">
<text>Billy Pilgrim (often stylized billy pilgrim) is an American folk rock duo based in Atlanta, Georgia, composed of Andrew Hyra and Kristian Bush. The band&#x27;s name was taken from the time-traveling antihero of Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s novel &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;. The name was adopted in 1994; prior to that the duo simply billed itself as Andrew Hyra and Kristian Bush. The band has released two albums on a major record label (&quot;Billy Pilgrim&quot;, &quot;Bloom&quot;) and several independently. The songs &quot;Get Me Out Of Here&quot; and &quot;Sweet Louisiana Sound&quot; were released as singles.

==History==

Kristian Bush and Andrew Hyra (the brother of actress Meg Ryan) first began performing together in 1990 in Knoxville, Tenn. After about a year, they started recording their songs to tape. The self-release &quot;St. Christopher&#x27;s Crossing&quot; was recorded in two days in a studio in Knoxville, Tennessee and appeared in 1991 (credited to &quot;Andrew Hyra &amp; Kristian Bush&quot;) on cassette. The album was released on CD in 1992 when Amy Ray of Indigo Girls helped them with the release costs. Playing hundreds of shows in the Southeast, their effort was noticed and they proceeded to record their second album &quot;Words Like Numbers&quot; under the indie label Sister Ruby. After this they signed to Atlantic Records, naming the group Billy Pilgrim.

In 1993 Billy Pilgrim recorded their debut album &quot;Billy Pilgrim&quot; at Nickel and Dime Studios, with Don McCollister producing and Hugh Padgham mixing the record. The eponymous album was a moderate success when released in 1994. With the next album, &quot;Bloom&quot;, the band launched a fall tour, headlining larger venues than they had in the past. Yet in early 1996, the band was dropped by Atlantic. After releasing several albums through Internet only, the album &quot;In the Time Machine&quot; became their last effort to date, released on May 12, 2001. An update on the band&#x27;s website indicates that Billy Pilgrim are not currently active, but no official disbanding has been announced.

In 2016 Billy Pilgrim reunited during the annual Thanksgiving shows Kristian Bush gave in Decatur, Georgia. It was the first time in 15 years they shared the stage.

Their single &quot;Insomniac&quot; (written by Bush) has been a favorite of numerous a cappella groups.

They reunited for several shows in 2023 and in 2024 the duo played the Grand Old Opry. Their tour included three sold-out shows at Eddie&#x27;s Attic outside Atlanta, where the duo played frequently at the start. 

===Other projects===
Both Hyra and Bush have released solo albums and worked with other musicians. Bush formed the country music group Sugarland in 2002 with Jennifer Nettles and Kristen Hall (who left in 2006, reducing Sugarland to a duo). Hyra released a solo album, &quot;Lost Songs&quot;, in 2006 and another, &quot;Curios&quot;, in 2011. Hyra is now in a band with Brian Bristow called the Smokin&#x27; Novas.

<doc id="648748" wikidata="Q888529" url="?curid=648748" title="Halogenation">
<text>In chemistry, halogenation is a chemical reaction which introduces one or more halogens into a chemical compound. Halide-containing compounds are pervasive, making this type of transformation important, e.g. in the production of polymers, drugs. This kind of conversion is in fact so common that a comprehensive overview is challenging. This article mainly deals with halogenation using elemental halogens (). Halides are also commonly introduced using salts of the halides and halogen acids. Many specialized reagents exist for and introducing halogens into diverse substrates, e.g. thionyl chloride.

==Organic chemistry==
Several pathways exist for the halogenation of organic compounds, including free radical halogenation, ketone halogenation, electrophilic halogenation, and halogen addition reaction. The nature of the substrate determines the pathway. The facility of halogenation is influenced by the halogen. Fluorine and chlorine are more electrophilic and are more aggressive halogenating agents. Bromine is a weaker halogenating agent than both fluorine and chlorine, while iodine is the least reactive of them all. The facility of dehydrohalogenation follows the reverse trend: iodine is most easily removed from organic compounds, and organofluorine compounds are highly stable.

===Free radical halogenation ===

Halogenation of saturated hydrocarbons is a substitution reaction. The reaction typically involves free radical pathways. The regiochemistry of the halogenation of alkanes is largely determined by the relative weakness of the C–H bonds. This trend is reflected by the faster reaction at tertiary and secondary positions. 

Free radical chlorination is used for the industrial production of some solvents:

Naturally-occurring organobromine compounds are usually produced by free radical pathway catalyzed by the enzyme bromoperoxidase. The reaction requires bromide in combination with oxygen as an oxidant. The oceans are estimated to release 1–2 million tons of bromoform and 56,000 tons of bromomethane annually.

The iodoform reaction, which involves degradation of methyl ketones, proceeds by the free radical iodination.

===Fluorination===
Because of its extreme reactivity, fluorine () represents a special category with respect to halogenation. Most organic compounds, saturated or otherwise, burn upon contact with , ultimately yielding carbon tetrafluoride. By contrast, the heavier halogens are far less reactive toward saturated hydrocarbons.

Highly specialised conditions and apparatus are required for fluorinations with elemental fluorine. Commonly, fluorination reagents are employed instead of . Such reagents include cobalt trifluoride, chlorine trifluoride, and iodine pentafluoride.

The method electrochemical fluorination is used commercially for the production of perfluorinated compounds. It generates small amounts of elemental fluorine in situ from hydrogen fluoride. The method avoids the hazards of handling fluorine gas. Many commercially important organic compounds are fluorinated using this technology.

=== Addition of halogens to alkenes and alkynes ===

Unsaturated compounds, especially alkenes and alkynes, &quot;add&quot; halogens:
In oxychlorination, the combination of hydrogen chloride and oxygen serves as the equivalent of chlorine, as illustrated by this route to 1,2-dichloroethane:


The addition of halogens to alkenes proceeds via intermediate halonium ions. In special cases, such intermediates have been isolated.

Bromination is more selective than chlorination because the reaction is less exothermic. Illustrative of the bromination of an alkene is the route to the anesthetic halothane from trichloroethylene:

Iodination and bromination can be effected by the addition of iodine and bromine to alkenes. The reaction, which conveniently proceeds with the discharge of the color of , is the basis of the analytical method. The iodine number and bromine number are measures of the degree of unsaturation for fats and other organic compounds.

===Halogenation of aromatic compounds===

Aromatic compounds are subject to electrophilic halogenation:
This kind of reaction typically works well for chlorine and bromine. Often a Lewis acidic catalyst is used, such as ferric chloride. Many detailed procedures are available.
Because fluorine is so reactive, other methods, such as the Balz–Schiemann reaction, are used to prepare fluorinated aromatic compounds.

===Other halogenation methods===
In the Hunsdiecker reaction, carboxylic acids are converted to organic halide, whose carbon chain is shortened by one carbon atom with respect to the carbon chain of the particular carboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid is first converted to its silver salt, which is then oxidized with halogen:
:

Many organometallic compounds react with halogens to give the organic halide:
:

==Inorganic chemistry==
All elements aside from argon, neon, and helium form fluorides by direct reaction with fluorine. Chlorine is slightly more selective, but still reacts with most metals and heavier nonmetals. Following the usual trend, bromine is less reactive and iodine least of all. Of the many reactions possible, illustrative is the formation of gold(III) chloride by the chlorination of gold. The chlorination of metals is usually not very important industrially since the chlorides are more easily made from the oxides and hydrogen chloride. Where chlorination of inorganic compounds is practiced on a relatively large scale is for the production of phosphorus trichloride and disulfur dichloride.

<doc id="648753" wikidata="Q2232807" url="?curid=648753" title="Tonicization">
<text>In music, tonicization is the treatment of a pitch other than the overall tonic (the &quot;home note&quot; of a piece) as a temporary tonic in a composition. In Western music that is tonal, the piece is heard by the listener as being in a certain key. A tonic chord has a dominant chord; in the key of C major, the tonic chord is C major and the dominant chord is G major or G dominant seventh. The dominant chord, especially if it is a dominant seventh, is heard by Western composers and listeners familiar with music as resolving (or &quot;leading&quot;) to the tonic, due to the use of the leading note in the dominant chord. A tonicized chord is a chord other than the tonic chord to which a dominant or dominant seventh chord progresses. When a dominant chord or dominant seventh chord is used before a chord other than the tonic, this dominant or dominant seventh chord is called a secondary dominant. When a chord is tonicized, this makes this non-tonic chord sound temporarily like a tonic chord.

==Examples==
Using Roman numeral chord analysis, a chord labeled &quot;V/ii&quot; (colloquially referred to as &quot;five of two&quot;) would refer to the V chord of a different key; specifically, a key named after the ii chord of the original tonic. This would usually resolve to the ii chord (of the original key). In this situation, the ii has been tonicized.

For example, in a piece in the key of C major, the ii chord is D minor, because D is the second scale degree in a C major scale. The D is minor because to construct a triad over D using only the pitches available in the key of C major—i.e. no sharps, no flats—the triad must be minor—the individual notes D, F and A. The V/ii chord is composed of the pitches in a V chord in the key of ii (key of D minor). The pitches used in a V/ii in this example include the notes A, C# and E (creating an A major chord). In the key of D minor, an A major chord is the dominant chord. In the key of C major, C sharp is an accidental. One can often find examples of tonicization by looking for accidentals, as there are always accidentals involved in tonicization. However, it is important to note that the opposite is not true—just because there is an accidental does not mean that it is definitely a case of tonicization.

Only major and minor chords may be tonicized. Diminished chords and augmented chords cannot be tonicized because they do not represent stable key areas in Western music. For example, a B minor chord (B, D, F#) occurring in any of its closely related keys may be tonicized with an F# major chord (V/V) because B minor also represents a key area—the key of B minor. However, a B diminished chord (B, D, F) may not be tonicized because &quot;B diminished&quot; could not be a stable key area; there is no key area in Western classical music that has B, D, &amp; F—the pitches that make up the B diminished chord—as the first, third and fifth scale degrees, respectively. This holds true of all diminished and augmented chords.

Tonicizations may last for multiple chords. Taking the example given above with the chord progression V/ii → ii, it is possible to extend this sequence backwards. Instead of just V/ii → ii, there could be iv/ii → V/ii → ii (additionally, thinking about the last chord in the sequence: ii, as i/ii, it becomes clear why the phrase &quot;temporary tonic&quot;—see above—is often used in relation to tonicization). Though perceptions vary as a general rule if a chord is treated as the tonic for longer than a phrase before returning to the previous key area, then the treatment is considered a modulation to a new key.

==Modulation==
In a song in C major, if a composer treats another key as the tonic (for example, the ii chord, D minor) for a short period by alternating between A7 (the notes A, C#, E and G) and D minor, and then returns to the tonic (C major), this is a tonicization of the key of D minor. However, if a song in C major shifts to the key of D minor and stays in this second, new key for a significant period, then this is usually considered to be a modulation to the new key (in this case, from C major to D minor). In effect, D minor has become the new key of the song.

&quot;A secondary dominant is like a miniature modulation; for just an instant, the harmony moves out of the diatonic chords of the key.&quot;

<doc id="648755" wikidata="Q2324874" url="?curid=648755" title="Underdark">
<text>The Underdark is a fictional setting which has appeared in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing campaigns and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;-based fiction books, including the Legend of Drizzt series by R. A. Salvatore. It is described as a vast subterranean network of interconnected caverns and tunnels, stretching beneath entire continents and forming an underworld for surface settings. &quot;Polygon&quot; called it &quot;one of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;″s most well-known realms&quot;.

==Use in campaign settings==
The Underdark featured prominently in the campaign settings &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; and the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;. The concept of a dungeon that spanned a planet was first introduced by Gary Gygax in his D-series of game modules and at the end of the G-series. The Underdark was described in detail in the 1986 manual &quot;Dungeoneer&#x27;s Survival Guide&quot;, by Doug Niles. It was also part of the &quot;Eberron&quot; campaign setting, in which it was called Khyber and was home to evil beings driven deep into the caverns at the end of the age of demons. Wolfgang Baur, who previously wrote the Underdark adventure &quot;Kingdom of the Ghouls&quot; for the Greyhawk setting, also introduced the Underdark in &quot;Empire of the Ghouls&quot; to the third-party Midgard setting from Kobold Press.

A review for &quot;Pyramid&quot; refers to the Underdark as &quot;one of the most well known facets of the Forgotten Realms&quot;. Much of the literary attention for this deep underworld stemmed from the sourcebooks and accessories for the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; setting, including R.A. Salvatore&#x27;s novels about the fictional character Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden.

The Underdark was also the setting for the expansion pack to the computer game &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; called &quot;Hordes of the Underdark&quot;, which featured the port city of Lith My&#x27;athar, and the mysterious Seer.

==Features==
The Underdark is a subterranean realm of enormous size inhabited by many different types of creatures such as drow, mind flayers, and aboleths. It extends far beyond the dungeons created by surface dwellers, and consists of caverns, tunnels and large complexes.

===Environment===
The fictional Underdark&#x27;s physical characteristics are based upon conditions in real-world caverns deep underground, except at immense size. Within the context of a game, the Underdark is extremely dangerous, especially to non-native characters and creatures. There are also the usual dangers associated with caverns: claustrophobia, poor air circulation, floor/ceiling collapses and getting lost.

There is no light except for occasional patches of phosphorescent fungus; most Underdark inhabitants either have highly developed senses other than sight or have developed darkvision. Food can be extremely difficult to find, and much of the natural vegetation is poisonous. In addition, potable water is hard to locate.

In the Forgotten Realms setting, the Underdark is permeated with a magical energy the drow call &quot;faerzress&quot;, which is used as a source of energy by the native plant life and which interferes with scrying and teleportation spells.

===Araumycos===
In the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; setting, Araumycos (Dwarvish, literally meaning &quot;Great Fungus&quot;) is an enormous fungal growth in the Upper Underdark under the continent of Faerûn. It is a single organism living beneath the High Forest between one and three miles under the surface, immune to magic and resistant to psionic energy. Araumycos will sometimes attack intruders with poison, spores, and manifestations that resemble oozes and slimes.

Araumycos houses many other fungal creatures. Travel within it is difficult since many passages and caves are blocked by it and damage regenerates quickly.

===Inhabitants===
The Underdark is home to many predators, races and fantasy monsters, most of which are hostile. These include:

* Aboleths
* Beholders
* Drow (dark elves)
* Duergar (gray dwarves)
* Dwarves
* Fomorian
* Illithids (Mind Flayers)
* Hook horrors
* Kuo-toa
* Myconids (Fungus-men)
* Pech
* Svirfneblin (Deep Gnomes)
* Troglodyte

There is no unified underground government since each individual city-state has a different form of rule. The Underdark economy deals primarily in armor, exotic goods, magic, slaves, timber and weapons. The ethical code of many indigenous races tends toward evil or neutral.

In the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, R.A. Salvatore created the drow &quot;Underdark&quot; city Menzoberranzan.

Parts of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn&quot; and &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot; take place in the Underdark, and &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; featured journeys through the Underdark. An expansion pack based on the &quot;Underdark&quot; setting was released for the &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; game series, titled &quot;Neverwinter Nights: Hordes of the Underdark&quot;. The tilesets which came with the &quot;Hordes of the Underdark&quot; expansion pack were used in several persistent worlds, most notably &quot;Escape from the Underdark&quot;.

<text>The mustang is a free-roaming horse of the Western United States, descended from horses brought to the Americas by the Spanish conquistadors. Mustangs are often referred to as wild horses, but because they are descended from once-domesticated animals, they are actually feral horses. The original mustangs were Colonial Spanish horses, but many other breeds and types of horses contributed to the modern mustang, now resulting in varying phenotypes. Some free-roaming horses are relatively unchanged from the original Spanish stock, most strongly represented in the most isolated populations.

In 1971, the United States Congress recognized that &quot;wild free-roaming horses and burros are living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West, which continue to contribute to the diversity of life forms within the Nation and enrich the lives of the American people.&quot; The free-roaming horse population is managed and protected by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

Controversy surrounds the sharing of land and resources by mustangs with the livestock of the ranching industry, and also with the methods by which the BLM manages their population numbers. The most common method of population management used is rounding up excess population and offering them to adoption by private individuals. There are inadequate numbers of adopters, so many once free-roaming horses now live in temporary and long-term holding areas with concerns that the animals may be sold for horse meat. Additional debate centers on the question of whether mustangs—and horses in general—are a native species or an introduced invasive species in the lands they inhabit.

==Etymology and usage==
Although free-roaming Mustangs are called &quot;wild&quot; horses, they descend from feral domesticated horses.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;), the English word &quot;mustang&quot; was likely borrowed from two essentially synonymous Spanish words, (or ) and . English lexicographer John Minsheu glossed both words together as &#x27;strayer&#x27; in his dictionary of 1599. Both words referred to livestock defined as &#x27;wild, having no master&#x27;. was used since the 13th century, while is attested from the late 15th.

 referred originally to beasts of uncertain ownership distributed by the powerful transhumant merino sheep ranchers&#x27; guild in medieval Spain, called the Mesta (). The name of the Mesta derived ultimately from the , referring to the common ownership of the guild&#x27;s animals by multiple parties. The &quot;OED&quot; states that the origin of is &quot;obscure&quot; but notes the is attested from the 15th century. In Spanish, mustangs are named . By 1936, the English &#x27;mustang&#x27; had been loaned back into Spanish as .

&quot;Mustangers&quot; () were cowboys () who caught, broke, and drove free-ranging horses to market in the Spanish and later American territories of what is now northern Mexico, Texas, New Mexico, and California. They caught the horses that roamed the Great Plains, the San Joaquin Valley of California, and later the Great Basin, from the 18th century to the early 20th century.

==Characteristics and ancestry==

The original mustangs were Colonial Spanish horses, but many other breeds and types of horses contributed to the modern mustang, resulting in varying phenotypes. Mustangs of all body types are described as surefooted and having good endurance. They may be of any coat color. Throughout all the Herd Management Areas managed by the Bureau of Land Management, light riding horse type predominates, though a few horses with draft horse characteristics also exist, mostly kept separate from other mustangs and confined to specific areas. Some herds show the signs of the introduction of Thoroughbred or other light racehorse-types into herds, a process that also led in part to the creation of the American Quarter Horse.
The mustang of the modern west has several different breeding populations today which are genetically isolated from one another and thus have distinct traits traceable to particular herds. Genetic contributions to today&#x27;s free-roaming mustang herds include assorted ranch horses that escaped to or were turned out on the public lands, and stray horses used by the United States Cavalry. For example, in Idaho some Herd Management Areas (HMA) contain animals with known descent from Thoroughbred and Quarter Horse stallions turned out with feral herds. The herds located in two HMAs in central Nevada produce Curly Horses. Others, such as certain bands in Wyoming, have characteristics consistent with gaited horse breeds.
Many herds were analyzed for Spanish blood group polymorphism (commonly known as &quot;blood markers&quot;) and microsatellite DNA loci. Blood marker analysis verified a few to have significant Spanish ancestry, namely the Cerbat Mustang, Pryor Mountain Mustang, and some horses from the Sulphur Springs HMA. The Kiger Mustang is also said to have been found to have Spanish blood and subsequent microsatellite DNA confirmed the Spanish ancestry of the Pryor Mountain Mustang.

Horses in several other HMAs exhibit Spanish horse traits, such as dun coloration and primitive markings. Genetic studies of other herds show various blends of Spanish, gaited horse, draft horse, and pony influences.

Height varies across the west, however, most are small, generally , and not taller than , even in herds with draft or Thoroughbred ancestry.
Some breeders of domestic horses consider the mustang herds of the west to be inbred and of inferior quality. However, supporters of the mustang argue that the animals are merely small due to their harsh living conditions and that natural selection has eliminated many traits that lead to weakness or inferiority.

The now-defunct American Mustang Association developed a breed standard for those mustangs that carry morphological traits associated with the early Spanish horses. These include a well-proportioned body with a clean, refined head with wide forehead and small muzzle. The facial profile may be straight or slightly convex. Withers are moderate in height, and the shoulder is to be &quot;long and sloping&quot;. The standard considers a very short back, deep girth and muscular coupling over the loins as desirable. The croup is rounded, neither too flat nor goose-rumped. The tail is low-set. The legs are to be straight and sound. Hooves are round and dense. Dun color dilution and primitive markings are particularly common among horses of Spanish type.

==History==
===1493–1600===

Modern horses were first brought to the Americas with the conquistadors, beginning with Columbus, who imported horses from Spain to the West Indies on his second voyage in 1493. Horses came to the mainland with the arrival of Cortés in 1519. By 1525, Cortés had imported enough horses to create a nucleus of horse-breeding in Mexico.

One hypothesis held that horse populations north of Mexico originated in the mid-1500s with the expeditions of Narváez, de Soto or Coronado, but it has been refuted. Horse breeding in sufficient numbers to establish a self-sustaining population developed in what today is the southwestern United States starting in 1598 when Juan de Oñate founded Santa Fe de Nuevo México. From 75 horses in his original expedition, he expanded his herd to 800, and from there the horse population increased rapidly.

While the Spanish also brought horses to Florida in the 16th century, the Choctaw and Chickasaw horses of what is now the southeastern United States are believed to be descended from western mustangs that moved east, and thus Spanish horses in Florida did not influence the mustang.

===17th- and 18th-century dispersal===

Native American people readily integrated use of the horse into their cultures. They quickly adopted the horse as a primary means of transportation. Horses replaced the dog as a pack animal and changed Native cultures in terms of warfare, trade, and even diet—the ability to run down bison allowed some people to abandon agriculture for hunting from horseback.

Santa Fe became a major trading center in the 1600s. Although Spanish laws prohibited Native Americans from riding horses, the Spanish used Native people as servants, and some were tasked to care for livestock, thus learning horse-handling skills. Oñate&#x27;s colonists also lost many of their horses. Some wandered off because the Spanish generally did not keep them in fenced enclosures, and Native people in the area captured some of these estrays. Other horses were traded by Oñate&#x27; settlers for women, or food and other goods. Initially, horses obtained by Native people were simply eaten, along with any cattle that were captured or stolen. But as individuals with horse-handling skills fled Spanish control, sometimes with a few trained horses, the local tribes began using horses for riding and as pack animals. By 1659, settlements reported being raided for horses, and in the 1660s the &quot;Apache&quot; were trading human captives for horses. The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 also resulted in large numbers of horses coming into the hands of Native people, the largest one-time influx in history.

From the Pueblo people, horses were traded to the Apache, Navajo and Utes. The Comanche acquired horses and provided them to the Shoshone. The Eastern Shoshone and Southern Utes became traders who distributed horses and horse culture from New Mexico to the northern plains. West of the Continental Divide, horses distribution moved north quite rapidly along the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains, skirting desert regions such as the Great Basin and the western Colorado Plateau. Horses reached what today is southern Idaho by 1690. The Northern Shoshone people in the Snake River valley had horses in 1700. By 1730, they reached the Columbia Basin and were east of the Continental divide in the northern Great Plains. The Blackfeet people of Alberta had horses by 1750. The Nez Perce people in particular became master horse breeders, and developed one of the first distinctly American breeds, the Appaloosa. Most other tribes did not practice extensive amounts of selective breeding, though they sought out desirable horses through acquisition and quickly culled those with undesirable traits. By 1769, most Plain Indians had horses.

In this period, Spanish missions were also a source of stray and stolen livestock, particularly in what today is Texas and California. The Spanish brought horses to California for use at their missions and ranches, where permanent settlements were established in 1769. Horse numbers grew rapidly, with a population of 24,000 horses reported by 1800. By 1805, there were so many horses in California that people began to simply kill unwanted animals to reduce overpopulation. However, due to the barriers presented by mountain ranges and deserts, the California population did not significantly influence horse numbers elsewhere at the time. Horses in California were described as being of &quot;exceptional quality&quot;.

In the upper Mississippi basin and Great Lakes regions, the French were another source of horses. Although horse trading with native people was prohibited, there were individuals willing to indulge in illegal dealing, and as early as 1675, the Illinois people had horses. Animals identified as &quot;Canadian&quot;, &quot;French&quot;, or &quot;Norman&quot; were located in the Great Lakes region, with a 1782 census at Fort Detroit listing over 1000 animals. By 1770, Spanish horses were found in that area, and there was a clear zone from Ontario and Saskatchewan to St. Louis where Canadian-type horses, particularly the smaller varieties, crossbred with mustangs of Spanish ancestry. French-Canadian horses were also allowed to roam freely, and moved west, particularly influencing horse herds in the northern plains and inland northwest.

Although horses were brought from Mexico to Texas as early as 1542, a stable population did not exist until 1686, when Alonso de León&#x27;s expedition arrived with 700 horses. From there, later groups brought up thousands more, deliberately leaving some horses and cattle to fend for themselves at various locations, while others strayed. By 1787, these animals had multiplied to the point that a roundup gathered nearly 8,000 &quot;free-roaming mustangs and cattle&quot;. West-central Texas, between the Rio Grande and Palo Duro Canyon, was said to have the most concentrated population of feral horses in the Americas. Throughout the west, horses escaped human control and formed feral herds, and by the late 1700s, the largest numbers were found in what today are the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico.

===19th century===

An early 19th-century reference to mustangs by American sources came from Zebulon Pike, who in 1808 noted passing herds of &quot;mustangs or wild horses&quot;. In 1821, Stephen Austin noted in his journal that he had seen about 150 mustangs.

Estimates of when the peak population of mustangs occurred and total numbers vary widely between sources. No comprehensive census of feral horse numbers was ever performed until the time of the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 and any earlier estimates, particularly prior to the 20th century, are speculative. Some sources simply state that &quot;millions&quot; of mustangs once roamed western North America. In 1959, geographer Tom L. McKnight suggested that the population peaked in the late 1700s or early 1800s, and the &quot;best guesses apparently lie between two and five million&quot;. Historian J. Frank Dobie hypothesized that the population peaked around the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848, stating: &quot;My own guess is that at no time were there more than a million mustangs in Texas and no more than a million others scattered over the remainder of the West.&quot; J. Edward de Steiguer questioned Dobie&#x27;s lower guess as still being too high.

In 1839, the numbers of mustangs in Texas had been augmented by animals abandoned by Mexican settlers who had been ordered to leave the Nueces Strip. Ulysses Grant, in his memoir, recalled seeing in 1846 an immense herd between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande in Texas: &quot;As far as the eye could reach to our right, the herd extended. To the left, it extended equally. There was no estimating the number of animals in it; I have no idea that they could all have been corralled in the state of Rhode Island, or Delaware, at one time.&quot; When the area was ceded to the U.S. in 1848, these horses and others in the surrounding areas were rounded up and trailed north and east, resulting in the near-elimination of mustangs in that area by 1860.

Farther west, the first known sighting of a free-roaming horse in the Great Basin was by John Bidwell near the Humboldt Sinks in 1841. Although John Charles Fremont noted thousands of horses in California, the only horse sign he spoke of in the Great Basin, which he named, was tracks around Pyramid Lake, and the natives he encountered there were horseless. In 1861, another party saw seven free-roaming horses near the Stillwater Range. For the most part, free-roaming horse herds in the interior of Nevada were established in the latter part of the 1800s from escaped settlers&#x27; horses.

=== 20th century ===
In the early 1900s, thousands of free-roaming horses were rounded up for use in the Spanish–American War and World War I.

By 1920, Bob Brislawn, who worked as a packer for the U.S. government, recognized that the original mustangs were disappearing, and made efforts to preserve them, ultimately establishing the Spanish Mustang Registry. In 1934, J. Frank Dobie stated that there were just &quot;a few wild [feral] horses in Nevada, Wyoming and other Western states&quot; and that &quot;only a trace of Spanish blood is left in most of them&quot; remaining. Other sources agree that by that time, only &quot;pockets&quot; of mustangs that retained Colonial Spanish Horse type remained.

By 1930, the vast majority of free-roaming horses were found west of Continental Divide, with an estimated population between 50,000 and 150,000. They were almost completely confined to the remaining United States General Land Office (GLO)-administered public lands and National Forest rangelands in the 11 Western States. In 1934, the Taylor Grazing Act established the United States Grazing Service to manage livestock grazing on public lands, and in 1946, the GLO was combined with the Grazing Service to form the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which, along with the Forest Service, was committed to removing feral horses from the lands they administered.

By the 1950s, the mustang population dropped to an estimated 25,000 horses. Abuses linked to certain capture methods, including hunting from airplanes and poisoning water holes, led to the first federal free-roaming horse protection law in 1959. This statute, titled &quot;Use of aircraft or motor vehicles to hunt certain wild horses or burros; pollution of watering holes&quot; popularly known as the &quot;Wild Horse Annie Act&quot;, prohibited the use of motor vehicles for capturing free-roaming horses and burros. Protection was increased further by the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 (WFRHABA).

The Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 provided for protection of certain previously established herds of horses and burros. It mandated the BLM to oversee the protection and management of free-roaming herds on lands it administered, and gave U.S. Forest Service similar authority on National Forest lands. A few free-ranging horses are also managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service, but for the most part they are not subject to management under the Act. A census completed in conjunction with passage of the Act found that there were approximately 17,300 horses (25,300 combined population of horses &quot;and&quot; burros) on the BLM-administered lands and 2,039 on National Forests.

=== 21st century ===

The BLM has established Herd Management Areas to determine where horses will be sustained as free-roaming populations. The BLM has established an Appropriate Management Level (AML) for each HMA, totaling 26,690 bureau-wide, but the on-range mustang population in August 2017 was estimated to have grown to over 72,000 horses, expanding to 88,090 in 2019.

More than half of all free-roaming mustangs in North America are found in Nevada (which features the horses on its State Quarter), with other significant populations in California, Oregon, Utah, Montana, and Wyoming. Another 45,000 horses are in holding facilities.

==Land use controversies==

===Prehistoric context===
The horse, clade Equidae, originated in North America 55 million years ago. By the end of the Late Pleistocene, there were two lineages of the equine family known to exist in North America: the &quot;caballine&quot; or &quot;stout-legged horse&quot; belonging to the genus &quot;Equus&quot;, closely related to the modern horse (&quot;Equus caballus&quot;) and &quot;Haringtonhippus francisci&quot;, the &quot;stilt-legged horse&quot;, which is not closely related to any living equine. At the end of the Last Glacial Period, the non-caballines went extinct and the caballines were extirpated from the Americas. Multiple factors that included changing climate and the impact of newly arrived human hunters may have been to blame. Thus, before the Columbian Exchange, the youngest physical evidence (macrofossils-generally bones or teeth) for the survival of Equids in the Americas dates between ≈10,500 and 7,600 years before present.

===Modern issues===

Due in part to the prehistory of the horse, there is controversy as to the role mustangs have in the ecosystem as well as their rank in the prioritized use of public lands, particularly in relation to livestock. There are multiple viewpoints. Some supporters of mustangs on public lands assert that, while not native, mustangs are a &quot;culturally significant&quot; part of the American West, and acknowledge some form of population control is needed. Another viewpoint is that mustangs reinhabited an ecological niche vacated when horses went extinct in North America, with a variant characterization that horses are a reintroduced native species that should be legally classified as &quot;wild&quot; rather than &quot;feral&quot; and managed as wildlife. The &quot;native species&quot; argument centers on the premise that the horses extirpated in the Americas 10,000 years ago are closely related to the modern horse as was reintroduced. Thus, this debate centers in part on the question of whether horses developed an ecomorphotype adapted to the ecosystem as it changed in the intervening 10,000 years.

The Wildlife Society views mustangs as an introduced species stating: &quot;Since native North American horses went extinct, the western United States has become more arid ... notably changing the ecosystem and ecological roles horses and burros play.&quot; and that they draw resources and attention away from true native species. A 2013 report by the National Research Council of the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine took issue with the view of the horse being a reintroduced native species stating that &quot;the complex of animals and vegetation has changed since horses were extirpated from North America&quot;. It also stated that the distinction between native or non-native was not the issue, but rather the &quot;priority that BLM gives to free-ranging horses and burros on federal lands, relative to other uses&quot;.

Mustang supporters advocate for the BLM to rank mustangs higher in priority than it currently does, arguing that too little forage is allocated to mustangs relative to cattle and sheep. Ranchers and others affiliated with the livestock industry favor a lower priority, arguing essentially that their livelihoods and rural economies are threatened because they depend upon the public land forage for their livestock.

The debate as to what degree mustangs and cattle compete for forage is multifaceted. Horses are adapted by evolution to inhabit an ecological niche characterized by poor quality vegetation. Advocates assert that most current mustang herds live in arid areas which cattle cannot fully utilize due to the lack of water sources. Mustangs can cover vast distances to find food and water; advocates assert that horses range 5–10 times as far as cattle to find forage, finding it in more inaccessible areas. In addition, horses are &quot;hindgut fermenters&quot;, meaning that they digest nutrients by means of the cecum rather than by a multi-chambered stomach. While this means that they extract less energy from a given amount of forage, it also means that they can digest food faster and make up the difference in efficiency by increasing their consumption rate. In practical effect, by eating greater quantities, horses can obtain adequate nutrition from poorer forage than can ruminants such as cattle, and so can survive in areas where cattle will starve.

However, while the BLM rates horses by animal unit (AUM) to eat the same amount of forage as a cow–calf pair (the baseline of 1.0 for the pair), studies of horse grazing patterns indicate that horses probably consume forage at a rate closer to 1.5 AUM. Modern rangeland management also recommends removing all livestock during the growing season to maximize re-growth of the forage. Year-round grazing by any non-native ungulate will degrade it, particularly horses whose incisors allow them to graze plants very close to the ground, inhibiting recovery.

==Management and adoption==
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) was tasked by Congress with protecting, managing, and controlling free-roaming horses and burros under the authority of the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 to ensure that healthy herds thrive on healthy rangelands under the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act. Difficulty arises because mustang herd sizes can multiply rapidly, increasing up to and possibly by over 20% every year, so population control presents a challenge. When unmanaged, population numbers can outstrip forage available, leading to starvation.

There are few predators in the modern era capable of preying on healthy adult mustangs, and for the most part, predators capable of limiting the growth of feral mustang herd sizes are not found in the same habitat as most modern feral herds. Although wolves and mountain lions are two species known to prey on horses and in theory could control population growth, in practice, predation is not a viable population control mechanism. Wolves were historically rare in, and currently do not inhabit, the Great Basin, where the vast majority of mustangs roam. While they are documented to prey on feral horses in Alberta, Canada, there is no known documentation of wolf predation on free-roaming horses in the United States. Mountain lions have been documented to prey on feral horses in the U.S., but in limited areas and small numbers, and mostly foals.

One of the BLM&#x27;s key mandates under the 1971 law and amendments is to maintain Appropriate Management Levels (AML) of wild horses and burros in areas of public rangelands where they are managed by the federal government. Control of the population to within AML is achieved through a capture program, although there are no specific guidelines or techniques used to round up mustangs. Most methods are quite stressful for the animals, even fatal. The BLM allows the use of trucks, ATVs, helicopters, and firearms to chase the horses into holding pens or &quot;traps&quot;. These methods have often resulted in extreme exhaustion, serious injuries, or even death to the horses. &quot;Bait&quot; traps are another common way mustangs are corralled, usually with hay or water being left in a camouflaged pen while varying types of trigger systems close gates behind the horses. Another, less destructive method uses a tamed horse, called a &quot;Judas horse&quot;, which has been trained to lead wild horses into a pen or corral. Once the mustangs are herded into an area near the holding pen, the Judas horse is released. Its job is then to move to the head of the herd and lead them into a confined area.
Since 1978, captured horses have been offered for adoption to individuals or groups willing and able to provide humane, long-term care. For decades this was after payment of a base adoption fee of $125, but in March 2019, in face of the mustang overpopulation, the BLM began paying people $1,000 to adopt a mustang. Adopted horses are still protected under the Act, for one year after adoption, at which point the adopter can obtain title to the horse. Horses that could not be adopted were to be humanely euthanized. Instead of euthanizing excess horses, the BLM began keeping them in &quot;long term holding&quot;, an expensive alternative that can cost taxpayers up to $50,000 per horse over its lifetime. On December 8, 2004, a rider amending the Wild and Free Roaming Horse and Burro Act was attached to an appropriation bill before the Congress by former Senator Conrad Burns. This modified the adoption program to also allow the unlimited sale of captured horses that are &quot;more than 10 years of age&quot;, or that were &quot;offered unsuccessfully for adoption at least three times&quot;. Since 1978, there had been specific language in the Act forbidding the BLM from selling the horses to those would take them to slaughter, but the Burns Amendment removed that language. In order to prevent horses being sold to slaughter, the BLM has implemented policies limiting sales and requiring buyers to certify they will not take the horses to slaughter. In 2017, the first Trump administration began pushing Congress to remove barriers to implementing both the option to euthanize and sell excess horses.

Despite efforts to try to increase the number of horses adopted, such as the Extreme Mustang Makeover, a promotional competition that gives trainers 100 days to gentle and train 100 mustangs so they may be adopted through auction, adoption numbers do not come close to finding homes for the excess horses. Ten thousand foals were expected to be born on range in 2017, whereas only 2500 horses were expected to be adopted. Alternatives to roundups for on range population control include fertility control, by PZP injection, culling, and natural regulation.

Captured horses are freeze branded on the left side of the neck by the BLM, using the International Alpha Angle System, a system of angles and alpha-symbols that cannot be altered. The brands begin with a symbol indicating the registering organization, in this case the U.S. government, then two stacked figures indicating the individual horse&#x27;s year of birth, then the individual registration number. Captured horses kept in sanctuaries are also marked on the left hip with four inch-high Arabic numerals that are also the last four digits of the freeze brand on the neck.

<text>John Berrien (November 19, 1711April 22, 1772) was a farmer and merchant from Rocky Hill, New Jersey. He was appointed a justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court in 1764 and was a trustee of the College of New Jersey, now Princeton University, for eleven years.

==Biography==
Berrien was born on November 19, 1711, at Newtown on Long Island, now known as Elmhurst, Queens. He was the grandson of Cornelius Jansen Berrien. His parents were Peter Berrien and Elizabeth Woodhull Edsall. 

After his first wife died, and they had no children. In 1759 he married again, to Lady Margaret Eaton. He and Margaret had a total of six children. Their son John Berrien (1759–1815) became a brigade major during the American Revolutionary War.

Although Berrien was a prosperous and prominent individual, on April 21, 1772, he drowned himself by jumping into the Millstone River. He was believed to have committed suicide, because of &quot;lunacy&quot;, as one account said at the time. His will divided his property equally among his wife and six children. He is buried in Princeton Cemetery.

His house Rockingham, near Rocky Hill, New Jersey was used by General George Washington as his last headquarters during the war. Congress leased it for Washington for three months while the legislators were in residence in Princeton. Washington wrote his final address to the army in 1783 while staying there.

<doc id="648777" wikidata="Q4493419" url="?curid=648777" title="Functional leadership model">
<text>Functional leadership theory (Hackman &amp; Walton, 1986; McGrath, 1962) is a theory for addressing specific leader behaviors expected to contribute to organizational or unit effectiveness. This theory argues that the leader&#x27;s main job is to see that whatever is necessary to group needs is taken care of; thus, a leader can be said to have done their job well when contributing to group effectiveness and cohesion.

Functional leadership theories are developed by studying successful leaders and identifying the actions and behaviors they show. Extensive studies with a large amount of data make it possible to correlate what leaders do, i.e., their actions or functions, with their successful results.

The Functional theory of leadership emphasizes how an organization or task is being led rather than who has been formally assigned a leadership role. In the functional leadership model, leadership does not rest with one person but rests on a set of behaviors by the group that gets things done. Any group member can perform these behaviors so that any member can participate in leadership.

One of the best-known and most influential functional theories of leadership, used in many leadership development programs, is John Adair&#x27;s &quot;Action-Centred Leadership&quot;.

John Adair developed a model of Action-Centred Leadership comprising 3 interlocking balls in a venn diagram arrangement, labelled Task, Team and Individual on the premise that:
* the Task can only be performed by the team and not by one person
* the Team can only achieve excellent task performance if all the individuals are fully developed
* the Individuals need the task to be challenged and motivated

Adair&#x27;s model challenged trait theory by focusing on what leaders do. He showed that leadership could be taught and did not depend on a person&#x27;s traits.

==The eight functions of leadership==

Adair noted the following 8 key functions for which team leaders are responsible. (Examples are given in brackets)

# Defining the task, (by setting clear objectives through SMART goals)
# Planning, (by looking at alternative ways to achieve the task and having contingency plans in case of problems)
# Briefing the team, (by creating the right team climate, fostering synergy, and making the most of each individual through knowing them well)
# Controlling what happens, (by being efficient in terms of getting maximum results from minimum resources)
# Evaluating results, (by assessing consequences and identifying how to improve performance)
# Motivating individuals, (by using both external motivators such as rewards and incentives as well as eliciting internal motivators on the part of each team player)
# Organizing people, (by organizing self and others through good time management, personal development, and delegation)
# Setting an example, (by recognizing that people observe their leaders and copy what they do).

==Criticism of the model==

Apparently some unknown people consider Adair&#x27;s Three Circles Model too simplistic and outdated as it was developed in the 1970s and yet the British Armed Forces (Army, Navy and Air Force), 50 years since its creation, still use it as the basis of all their leadership development programs.

==Implications for the nature versus nurture debate==

Whether leaders are born or made is part of the question of whether human behavior is due to nature or nurture. It is a short leap from functional leadership theory to the belief that if one person can do something, others can also learn to do it. The implication that leaders are made and not necessarily born with the necessary traits for leadership opened up the possibility of leadership development.

<doc id="648779" wikidata="Q645906" url="?curid=648779" title="Froth on the Daydream">
<text>Froth on the Daydream (, &quot;The Froth of Days&quot;) is a 1947 surrealist novel by French author Boris Vian. Although told as a linear narrative, the novel employs surrealism and contains multiple plot lines, including the love stories of two couples, talking mice, and a man who ages years in a week. One of the main plot lines concerns a newlywed man whose wife develops a rare and bizarre illness that can be treated only by surrounding her with flowers.

The book has been translated several times into English under different titles. Stanley Chapman&#x27;s translation is titled Froth on the Daydream (Rapp &amp; Carroll, 1967), John Sturrock&#x27;s is called Mood Indigo (Grove Press, 1968), and Brian Harper&#x27;s is named Foam of the Daze (TamTam Books, 2012). A 2014 edition based on the 2013 film adaptation and published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux is also titled &quot;Mood Indigo&quot;.

&quot;Froth on the Daydream&quot; has been adapted into three feature films, two music albums, and an opera.

==Plot==
In a surreal world where animals and inanimate objects reflect the emotions of humans, Colin is a wealthy young man with a resourceful and stylish valet, Nicholas, and a loyal best friend, Chick. Despite his significant fortune and luxurious lifestyle, Colin is desperate for a lover, even going so far as secretly pining for Chick&#x27;s girlfriend, Alyssum. Consequently, this overpowering desire compels Colin to instantly fall in love with Chloe, whom he meets at a friend&#x27;s party. After a whirlwind romance, Colin weds Chloe in a grand ceremony. Generously, Colin bequeaths a quarter of his fortune to Chick and Alyssum so they too may marry despite the former&#x27;s reluctance to do so.

During the honeymoon, Chloe falls ill with a mysterious disease that primarily consists of coughing and chest pain, and she and Colin are forced to end their trip early. Upon returning home, Chloe begins to feel better. However, her recovery is short-lived, and she faints during a shopping trip and her coughing fits return. She is eventually diagnosed with a water lily in the lung, a painful and rare condition that can be treated only by surrounding her with flowers. The expense of the treatment is large and Colin soon exhausts his funds, compelling him to undertake low-paying jobs in an effort to accumulate more money for Chloe&#x27;s remedy. As Chloe&#x27;s disease progresses, the apartments of Colin, Chick, and Nicholas all begin to decay, and Nicholas suddenly ages years in a single week.

Meanwhile, Chick&#x27;s obsession with a philosopher Jean-Paul Heartre causes him to spend all his money, effort and attention on collecting Heartre&#x27;s literature. Alyssum, who is resentful of Chick&#x27;s neglect of her in favor of his burgeoning collection, attempts to save him financially and renew his interest in her by persuading Heartre to stop publishing books, whom she kills when he refuses. She then seeks revenge upon the booksellers carrying Heartre&#x27;s works by murdering them and burning down their stores. Concurrently, Chick receives a surprise visit from the police for tax evasion and contraband tobacco smuggling. His refusal to turn over his Heartre books as payment for his crimes leads to his death from a gunshot fired by one of the policemen at the scene.

Ultimately, Colin struggles to provide flowers for Chloe to no avail, and his grief at her death is so strong that his pet mouse commits suicide to escape the gloom.

== Characters ==
* Colin is the amicable protagonist of &quot;Froth on the Daydream&quot;. At the age of 22, Colin has managed to amass a large amount of wealth, which enables him to elude employment and on which he spends on multiple luxuries. Initially, Colin experiences jealousy of his best friend Chick&#x27;s romantic relationship and longs for his own. However, this desire is quickly fulfilled by Chloe, whom he meets at his friend Isis&#x27; party. His loving yet impulsive nature is portrayed by his swift marriage to Chloe, which occurs only a short time after their first meeting. By the end of the novel, he is left devastated and broke after Chloe&#x27;s untimely death.
* Chloe is the girlfriend and later the wife of Colin, with whom she shares Isis as a mutual friend. She is instantly smitten by Colin and marries him soon after a whirlwind romance. During her honeymoon, she contracts a water lily in her lung, a rare disease that has only one cure: surrounding the patient with flowers. Despite her husband&#x27;s best efforts to provide her treatment, her health quickly deteriorates and she dies, leaving Colin heartbroken. She is based on Boris Vian&#x27;s first wife, Michelle.
* Chick is Colin&#x27;s devoted and affable best friend. He is an engineer, a career that does not provide him with the same amount of wealth as Colin. Despite his lower socioeconomic status, Chick regularly dines and spends time with Colin. He is currently in a romantic relationship with Alyssum, whom he wants to marry but fears doing so due to his lack of money and the disapproval of her parents. Throughout the novel, he develops an unhealthy obsession with a philosopher, Jean-Pulse Heartre, which compels the former to spend all of his income on the works of the latter. He is ultimately killed after refusing to hand over his Heartre collection to the police as payment for his crimes of tax evasion and contraband smuggling.
* Nicholas is the dedicated, diligent, and practical 29-year old servant of Colin. He is renowned for his unique dishes and astounding sense of wisdom. He is also Alyssum&#x27;s uncle. As Chloe&#x27;s illness worsens, he suddenly ages years in a week. 
* Alyssum (aka Alise in the original French edition) is Chick&#x27;s 18-year old girlfriend, whom he met at one of Heartre&#x27;s lectures. She is frustrated with Chick&#x27;s reluctance to marry her and his Heartre addiction, the latter of which causes him to ignore her. Eventually, she descends into a murderous rage after an unsuccessful attempt to convince Heartre to stop publishing books.
* Isis is an 18-year old socialite and the friend of Colin, Chick, Alyssum, and Chloe who hosts the fateful party where Colin and Chloe first meet and fall in love. She is also Nicholas&#x27; girlfriend.
* Jean-Pulse Heartre is a philosopher and author with whose works Chick becomes obsessed with collecting. He is a fictionalized version of French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, with whom Michelle Vian had an extramarital affair.
* Professor Gnawknuckle is a doctor and scientist who diagnoses Chloe&#x27;s disease.
* Father Phigga is the priest who officiates Colin and Chloe&#x27;s wedding ceremony. After Chloe&#x27;s death, he refuses to officiate her funeral due to Colin&#x27;s lack of funds.
* The Kissitwell Brothers are made up of twins Coriolanus and Pegasus. They work as page-boys at numerous weddings, including Colin and Chloe&#x27;s, and have adopted homosexuality to advance their careers. Despite their steady income, the brothers have ceased to take their work seriously.

==Themes and symbolism==
It is widely believed that Chloe&#x27;s illness is a metaphor for cancer and terminal illness. A possible parallel between Chloe&#x27;s disease and the chronic heart condition Boris Vian suffered from throughout his life has also been speculated.

Colin&#x27;s copious spending on Chloe&#x27;s treatment and his relentless job search for more money represent the financial struggle many families face with paying for their loved ones&#x27; treatments and medical bills. His desperation to keep his wife alive and his grief and depression after her death symbolize the emotional and psychological anguish faced by individuals who know or have lost someone to terminal illness. Ultimately, Colin&#x27;s actions and fate at the end of the novel demonstrate that cancer not only devastates the life of the patient – it also does the same to the lives of the people surrounding him or her.

Meanwhile, Chick&#x27;s compulsive fixation on Jean-Pulse Heartre is a metaphor for drug addiction. His subsequent neglect of Alyssum and the rapid depletion of his funds on Heartre&#x27;s works both reflect common characteristics shared among the majority of drug addicts.

The physical deterioration of the apartments of Colin, Nicholas, and Chick mirrors the depression and gradual loss of hope brought about by a persistent disease, and Nicholas&#x27; sudden ageing represents trauma and stress.

Jean-Pulse Heartre is a spoonerism of the French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s name. Throughout the novel, there are references to various works by Sartre, but like the philosopher&#x27;s name, Boris Vian played with words to make new titles for &quot;works&quot; by Heartre. For example, sometimes Vian used a synonym, such as &quot;Le Vomi&quot; (Sartre&#x27;s original, &quot;La Nausée&quot;), while other times he created titles that served as homonyms to those of original Sartre works, such as &quot;La Lettre et le Néon&quot; (The Letter and Neon), a pun on &quot;L&#x27;Être et le Néant&quot; (Being and Nothingness).

== Background and publication history ==

Boris Vian finished writing the novel in the spring of 1946. The book sold poorly when it was published in 1947 as &quot;L&#x27;écume des jours&quot; under his birth name, Vian, rather than under his more famous pseudonym, Vernon Sullivan.

The work was first published in English as &quot;Froth on the Daydream&quot; in November 1967. Other published English translations title the work &quot;Foam of the Daze&quot; and &quot;Mood Indigo&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
Following its debut in France, &quot;Froth on the Daydream&quot; received little notice in the press and underperformed in sales. It garnered more attention after the publication of the first English translation in 1967. Over the years, the novel has received mostly positive reviews and is considered to be one of Vian&#x27;s best works.

In his review for &quot;The Independent&quot;, David Evans described &quot;Froth on the Daydream&quot; as &quot;a mad, moving, beautiful novel.&quot; In another positive review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, James Sallis stated, &quot;This [&quot;Froth on the Daydream]&quot; is a great novel...beneath are a host of ambiguities, digressions, levels of meaning. Not quite beneath, actually, for subtexts keep erupting to the surface. It is in many ways a novel built of eruptions.&quot; In her critique, Ruby Millar reported &quot;Froth on the Daydream&quot; as &quot;a book in which every line has a bite&quot; and also commended Chapman&#x27;s translation. English writer and translator John Sturrock praised the novel for being &quot;the most consistent and balanced of all of Boris Vian&#x27;s novels&quot;, and John Whitley of &quot;Sunday Times&quot; commended it for being &quot;as timeless as &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot; or even &quot;La Princesse de Clèves&quot;.&quot;

Meanwhile, in a mixed review for &quot;Review of Contemporary Fiction&quot;, Thomas Hove observed that &quot;sometimes Vian&#x27;s absurdist style creates an emotionally distant effect&quot;, but later asserted that &quot;Froth on the Daydream&#x27;s&quot; &quot;final chapters sustain a powerful note of sadness for two young loves ruined by mortality, rival intellectual obsessions, and a repressive work ethic.&quot;

In another lukewarm evaluation written for &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; in 1969, Nina Bernstein, a Harvard University undergraduate student at the time who later became a journalist, described &quot;Froth on the Daydream&quot; as &quot;a disappointment&quot; and subsequently predicted, &quot;It&#x27;s unlikely that Vian&#x27;s novels will become particularly popular in this country: they&#x27;re very French, and they suffer in translation.&quot; She also observed that the &quot;puns and word games (unfortunately badly translated) shade into black humor which at the novel&#x27;s end becomes a Kafkaesque surrealism that we find frightening rather than funny&quot; and dismissed Colin and Chloe&#x27;s romance as &quot;simple to the point of banality.&quot; However, at the end of her review, Bernstein acknowledged that &quot;Froth on the Daydream&quot; &quot;has a magic no heavy-handed translator can counteract. It&#x27;s effective on so many levels that reading it is more than a pleasant pastime – it&#x27;s like an initiation into Vian&#x27;s way of responding to reality. And a very powerful one, too.&quot;

== Accolades ==
&quot;Froth on the Daydream&quot; was #10 on the &quot;Le Monde&quot;&#x27;s 100 Books of the Century list, which was compiled by the French retailer Fnac and the French daily newspaper &quot;Le Monde.&quot; To assemble the list, both companies polled 17,000 people on the question &quot;Which books have remained in your memory?&quot; in the spring of 1999.

<text>Treasure Planet is a 2002 American animated science fiction adventure film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is a science fiction adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s adventure novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1883), and it is the third retelling of the story in an outer space setting, following the Bulgarian film &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; (1982) and the Italian miniseries &quot;Treasure Island in Outer Space&quot; (1987). It is the third Disney adaptation of the novel, following &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1950) and &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot; (1996). In the film&#x27;s setting, spaceships are powered by solar sails and resemble the 18th-century sailing vessels of the original &quot;Treasure Island&quot;.

The film was directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, both of whom also produced the film with Roy Conli, from a screenplay written by Clements, Musker, and Rob Edwards, and a story conceived by the directors and the writing team of Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. The film features the voices of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brian Murray, David Hyde Pierce, Martin Short, Roscoe Lee Browne, Emma Thompson, Michael Wincott, Laurie Metcalf, and Patrick McGoohan in his final feature role. The musical score was composed by James Newton Howard, while some songs were written and performed by John Rzeznik. It marks Clements and Musker&#x27;s first non-musical film since &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (1986). The duo pitched the concept for the film during production of another Disney animated feature they wrote and directed, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989). After they finished their work on &quot;Hercules&quot; (1997), development of the film officially began. It employs a novel technique of hand-drawn 2D traditional animation set atop 3D computer animation. With a budget of $140 million, it is the most expensive traditionally animated film to date.

&quot;Treasure Planet&quot; premiered in Paris, France and the Cinerama Dome in Los Angeles on November 6 and 17, 2002, respectively, and received a wide theatrical release on November 27. It was the first film to be released simultaneously in regular and IMAX theaters. The film was a box-office failure, earning $109 million worldwide against a budget of $140 million, but received generally positive reviews from critics and audiences. It was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards but lost to &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (2001). The film has gained a cult following.

== Plot ==

On the planet of Montressor, young Jim Hawkins is enchanted by stories of space pirate Captain Flint and his ability to strike suddenly and disappear without a trace, hiding his loot on the fabled &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;. Twelve years later, Jim grows into an aloof troublemaker after his father abandons the family. One day, Billy Bones crashes his spaceship near the inn that Jim and his mother Sarah run together. Before Billy dies, he gives Jim a sphere and warns him to &quot;beware the cyborg&quot;. A group of pirates attack and destroy the inn, while Jim flees with Sarah and their dog-like friend, Dr. Delbert Doppler. At Doppler&#x27;s house, the three discover that the sphere contains a holographic star map leading to the location of Treasure Planet.

To help Jim search for the treasure, Doppler commissions the ship &quot;RLS Legacy&quot;, commanded by feline Captain Amelia and stone-skinned first mate Mr. Arrow. The ship&#x27;s motley crew seem to be heavily influenced by cook John Silver, whom Jim suspects is the cyborg Bones warned him about. Under the supervision of Silver and his shape-shifting pet Morph, Jim works in the ship&#x27;s galley, and he and Silver form a tenuous father-son relationship. When the ship encounters a supernova devolving into a black hole, Jim secures the crew&#x27;s lifelines. A ruthless arachnid crew member named Scroop secretly cuts Arrow&#x27;s lifeline, sending him into the black hole. As the &quot;Legacy&quot; escapes the shockwaves, Scroop blames an improperly secured lifeline for Arrow&#x27;s death. Silver, realizing the truth, comforts Jim.

After reaching Treasure Planet, Jim discovers that the crew are pirates led by Silver, and a mutiny erupts. As Doppler, Amelia, and Morph flee in a lifeboat, Jim retrieves the map. Silver, who cannot bring himself to shoot Jim, allows him to escape with the others. Another pirate shoots down the lifeboat, injuring Amelia.

Jim discovers that the &quot;map&quot; is Morph in disguise, with the real map still on the ship. The four meet B.E.N., a navigational robot who once belonged to Flint and is now missing his primary memory circuit. Jim, Morph, and B.E.N. secretly return to the &quot;Legacy&quot; and retrieve the map. Scroop fights them, but B.E.N. inadvertently disables the artificial gravity, allowing Jim to kick Scroop overboard into deep space.

Jim&#x27;s group, upon returning to camp, finds the pirates holding Amelia and Doppler hostage. Silver forces Jim to use the map, which directs them to the huge portal that Flint used to conduct his raids. Its holographic controls allow it to open to any location in the known universe. Jim, realizing that Treasure Planet is actually a giant piece of machinery with the treasure sealed inside its core, directs the portal to open to the planet&#x27;s treasure room. While the pirates enter and begin collecting the loot, Jim finds the skeleton of Flint, holding B.E.N.&#x27;s missing circuit in its hand. After Jim re-installs the circuit, B.E.N. suddenly remembers that Flint rigged the planet to self-destruct if anyone entered the treasure chamber. The planet begins collapsing; Silver attempts to escape with a boatload of treasure, but abandons it to save Jim. The survivors board the &quot;Legacy&quot;, which becomes damaged and unable to go fast enough to escape the planet&#x27;s impending destruction. Jim rigs a makeshift sailboard and rides ahead, setting the portal to Montressor Spaceport, and Doppler steers the &quot;Legacy&quot; through the portal to safety.

Jim finds Silver below decks and allows him to escape. As a farewell gift, Silver gives Jim Morph, and a handful of treasure he had put in his pocket. Back on Montressor, Jim uses the treasure to help Sarah rebuild their inn, with B.E.N. becoming a waiter. Doppler and Amelia marry and have children together, and Jim, having matured under Silver&#x27;s mentorship, accepts Amelia&#x27;s offer to become a cadet at the Interstellar Academy.

The film also features a cast including Tony Jay as the narrator, Austin Majors as Jim&#x27;s younger self, and Jane Carr as Benbow Inn costumer Mrs. Dunwitty. The RLS &quot;Legacy&quot; crew also includes Corey Burton as Onus and Mike McShane as Hands.

== Production ==

=== Development ===
&quot;Treasure Planet&quot; took roughly four and a half years to create, but the concept for &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; (which was called &quot;Treasure Island in Space&quot; at the time) was originally pitched by Ron Clements in 1985 at the &quot;Gong Show&quot; meeting wherein he and John Musker also pitched &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. The pitch was rejected by Michael Eisner, who knew Paramount Pictures was developing a &quot;Star Trek&quot; sequel with a &quot;Treasure Island&quot; angle (which eventually went unproduced). The idea was pitched again in 1989 following the release of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, but the studio still expressed a lack of interest. Following the release of &quot;Aladdin&quot;, the idea was pitched for a third time, but Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was the chief of Walt Disney Studios at the time, &quot;just wasn&#x27;t interested&quot; in the idea. During this time Katzenberg wanted the duo to work on &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; which the company was attempting to adapt. Angered at the rejection, Clements and Musker approached Feature Animation chairman Roy E. Disney who backed the filmmakers and made his wishes known to Eisner, who in turn agreed that the studio should produce the movie. In 1995, their contract was re-negotiated to allow them to commence development on &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; when &quot;Hercules&quot; reached completion. 
Since Musker and Clements wanted to be able to move &quot;the camera around a lot like Steven Spielberg or James Cameron,&quot; the delay in production was beneficial since &quot;the technology had time to develop in terms of really moving the camera.&quot; Principal animation for the film began in 2000 with roughly 350 crew members working on it. In 2002, Roy Conli estimated that there were around 1,027 crew members listed in the screen credits with &quot;about four hundred artists and computer artists, about a hundred and fifty musicians and another two hundred technologists&quot;. According to Conli, Clements wanted to create a space world that was &quot;warm and had more life to it than you would normally think of in a science fiction film&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;stainless steel, blue, smoke coming from the bowels of heavily pipe laden&quot; treatment of science fiction. In order to make the film &quot;fun&quot; by creating more exciting action sequences and because they believed that having the characters wear space suits and helmets &quot;would take all the romance out of it&quot;, the crew created the concept of the &quot;Etherium&quot;, an &quot;outer space filled with atmosphere&quot; and the characters wear 18 century clothing much like in the original Treasure Island.

Several changes were made late in the production to the film. The prologue of the film originally featured an adult Jim Hawkins narrating the story of Captain Flint in first person, but the crew considered it too &quot;dark&quot; and felt that it lacked character involvement, so it was changed and instead narrated by Tony Jay. The crew also intended for the film to include a sequence showing Jim working on his solar surfer and interacting with an alien child, which was intended to show Jim&#x27;s more sensitive side and as homage to &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. Because of the intention to begin the film with a scene of Jim solar surfing, the sequence had to be cut.

=== Writing ===
Writer Rob Edwards stated that &quot;it was extremely challenging&quot; to take a classic novel and set it in outer space, and that they did away with some of the science fiction elements (&quot;things like the metal space ships and the coldness&quot;) early on. Edwards goes on to say that they &quot;did a lot of things to make the film more modern&quot; and that the idea behind setting the film in outer space was to &quot;make the story as exciting for kids now as the book was for kids then&quot;.

With regard to adapting the characters from the book to film, Ron Clements mentioned that the Jim Hawkins in the book is &quot;a very smart, very capable kid&quot;, but they wanted to make Jim start out as &quot;a little troubled kid&quot; who &quot;doesn&#x27;t really know who he is&quot; while retaining the aforementioned characteristics from the original character. This change was made after Joe Ranft suggested the idea. The &quot;mentor figures&quot; for Jim Hawkins in the novel were Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey, whom John Musker described as &quot;one is more comic and the other&#x27;s very straight&quot;; these two characters were fused into Dr. Doppler. Clements also mentions that though the father-son relationship between Jim Hawkins and John Silver was present &quot;to some degree&quot; in the book, they wanted to emphasize it more in the film.

Terry Rossio, who worked on the script, later argued the filmmakers made a crucial mistake turning Jim Hawkins into an adolescent. &quot;&quot;Treasure Island&quot;, the book, is a boy&#x27;s adventure, about a young cabin boy who matches wits with a crew of bloodthirsty pirates. All of the key scenes are made more dramatic by the fact that it&#x27;s a young kid who is in danger... &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; made the kid into a young man. Which dilutes the drama of all the situations, start to finish... Instead of being an amazing and impressive kid, he became a petulant unimpressive teen.&quot;

=== Casting ===

Casting director Ruth Lambert held a series of casting auditions for the film in New York, Los Angeles, and London, but the crew already had some actors in mind for two of the major characters. The character of Dr. Doppler was written with David Hyde Pierce in mind, and Pierce was given a copy of the &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; script along with preliminary sketches of the character and the film&#x27;s scenic elements while he was working on Pixar&#x27;s &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (1998). He stated that &quot;the script was fantastic, the look was so compelling&quot; that he accepted the role. Jeff Goldblum and Hugh Grant were also considered before Pierce secured the part. Likewise, the character of Captain Amelia was developed with the idea that Emma Thompson would be providing her voice. &quot;We offered it to her and she was really excited,&quot; Clements said. Musker said, &quot;This is the first action adventure character that Emma has ever played and she was pregnant during several of the sessions. She was happy that she could do all this action and not have to train for the part&quot; There were no actors initially in mind for the characters of John Silver and Jim Hawkins; Brian Murray (John Silver) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Jim Hawkins) were signed after months of auditions. Gordon-Levitt stated that he was attracted to the role because &quot;it&#x27;s a Disney animated movie and Disney animated movies are in a class by themselves,&quot; and that &quot;to be part of that tradition is unbelievable to me&quot;. Musker mentioned that Gordon-Levitt &quot;combined enough vulnerability and intelligence and a combination of youthfulness but incompleteness&quot; and that they liked his approach. Patrick McGoohan was cast as Billy Bones at the suggestion of Corey Burton who played the smaller role of Onus in the film after having done an impression of him for a temp track. It marked the last and posthumous film of his career.

Among the big-name actors, only Pierce and Short had experience with voice acting prior to the making of &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;. Conli explained that they were looking for &quot;really the natural voice of the actor&quot;, and that sometimes it was better to have an actor with no experience with voice work as he utilizes his natural voice instead of &quot;affecting a voice&quot;. The voice sessions were mostly done without any interaction with the other actors, but Gordon-Levitt expressed a desire to interact with Murray because he found it difficult to act out most of the scenes between Jim Hawkins and John Silver alone.

=== Design ===

While designing for &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;, the crew operated on rule they call the &quot;70/30 Law&quot; (an idea that art director Andy Gaskill has credited to Ron Clements), which meant that the overall look of the film&#x27;s artwork should be 70% traditional and 30% sci-fi. The overall look of &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; was based on the art style promoted by illustrators associated with the Brandywine School of Illustration (such as Howard Pyle and N.C. Wyeth), whose illustrations have been described by the film&#x27;s crew as being the &quot;classic storybook illustration,&quot; having a painterly feel to it, and being composed of a warm color palette.

There were around forty animators on the crew, and were further divided into teams; for example, sixteen animators were assigned to Jim Hawkins because he appeared on the screen the most, and twelve were assigned to John Silver. To ensure &quot;solidity&quot; in illustration and personality, each major character in the film had a team of animators led by one animation supervisor. Conli mentioned that the personalities of the supervisors affected the final character, citing Glen Keane (the supervisor for John Silver) as well as John Ripa (the supervisor for Jim Hawkins) as examples. The physical appearance, movements, and facial expressions of the voice actors were infused into the characters as well.

When asked if they drew inspiration from the previous film adaptations of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; for the character designs, Glen Keane said he disliked looking at previous portrayals of a character to &quot;clear his mind of stereotypes&quot;, but that he drew some inspiration for the manner by which Silver spoke from actor Wallace Beery, whom he &quot;loved because of the way he talked out of the side of his mouth.&quot; For the characterization and design for Jim Hawkins, John Ripa cited James Dean as an important reference because &quot;there was a whole attitude, a posture&quot; wherein &quot;you felt the pain and the youthful innocence&quot;, and he also cited the film &quot;Braveheart&quot; because &quot;there are a lot of close-ups on characters...who are going through thought processes, just using their eyes.&quot;

Animators also used maquettes, small statues of the characters in the film, as references throughout the animation process. Character sculptor Kent Melton mentioned that the first Disney film to use maquettes was &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940), and that this paved the way to the formation of an entire department devoted to character sculpting. Keane noted that maquettes are not just supposed to be &quot;like a mannequin in a store&quot;, but rather has to be &quot;something that tells you [the character&#x27;s] personality&quot; and that maquettes also helped inspire the way actors would portray their roles.

The animators took &quot;Deep Canvas&quot;, a technology which they had initially developed for &quot;Tarzan&quot; (1999), and came up with a process they called &quot;Virtual Sets&quot;, wherein they created entire 360 degree sets before they began staging the scenes. They combined this process with traditionally-drawn characters in order to achieve a &quot;painted image with depth perception&quot; and enabled the crew to place the camera anywhere in the set and maneuver it as they would maneuver a camera for a live-action film. In order to test how a computer-generated body part (specifically John Silver&#x27;s cyborg arm) would mesh with a traditionally animated character, the crew took a clip of Captain Hook from &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953) and replaced his arm with the cyborg arm.

=== Animation === 
One of the film&#x27;s goals was to blend different mediums of animation into one film to have such a seamless finish to the point the viewer could not tell the difference between what was two-dimensional hand drawing or computer-generated 3D animations and environments. For the animation of the &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;, there are three main elements that were essential to the production of this film. The traditional 2D character animation that Disney is known for, three-dimensional character animation, and the computer-generated or CG environments.

===Music and sound===

The &quot;70/30 Law&quot; of &quot;70% traditional and 30% sci-fi&quot; was not only applied to the visual designs for the film, but also for the sound effects and music. Sound designer Dane Davis mentioned that he and his team &quot;scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms&quot; in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to &quot;avoid sounding slick or sci-fi&quot;. The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep Short&#x27;s natural voice because everything they tried &quot;affected his comedy&quot;, and &quot;the last thing you want to do in a story like this is affect performances&quot;.

The music from the film is largely orchestral in nature, although it includes two moderately successful pop singles (&quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; and &quot;Always Know Where You Are&quot;) from The Goo Goo Dolls frontman John Rzeznik and British pop-rock group, BBMak. Both songs were written and performed by John Rzeznik in the film, but BBMak recorded &quot;Always Know Where You Are&quot; for the soundtrack. The score was composed by James Newton Howard, who said that the score is &quot;very much in the wonderful tradition of Korngold and Tiomkin and Steiner.&quot; The score has been described as a mixture of modern &quot;classical style&quot; music in the spirit of &quot;Star Wars&quot; and Celtic music. Scottish fiddler Alasdair Fraser is credited as the co-composer of the track &quot;Silver Leaves&quot;, and is also listed as a soloist in the film&#x27;s credits. Walt Disney Records released the film&#x27;s soundtrack album on November 19, 2002. Jerry Goldsmith was also considered to compose the score.

== Marketing ==
In April 2002, a teaser trailer for &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; was officially released online. It would then debut in theaters within the next few weeks, starting with &quot;Spider-Man&quot; on May 3, 2002, followed by &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; two weeks later. Before and during its theatrical run, &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; had promotional support from McDonald&#x27;s, Pepsi-Cola, Dreyer&#x27;s, and Kellogg&#x27;s. McDonald&#x27;s included promotional items such as action figures and puzzles in their Happy Meals and Mighty Meals, Pepsi-Cola placed promotional film graphics onto the packaging of a number of their soft drinks (Mountain Dew, Code Red, Sierra Mist, Mug Root Beer, Orange Slice, and Lipton Brisk), Dreyer&#x27;s used their delivery truck panels to promote ice cream flavors inspired by the film (such as &quot;Galactic Chocolate&quot; and &quot;Vanilla Treasure&quot;), and Kellogg&#x27;s included film-branded spoons in their cereal boxes.

Hasbro released a lineup of &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; action figures and toys.

A novelization was published by Puffin Books.

== Release ==

=== Theatrical ===
&quot;Treasure Planet&quot; held its world premiere in Paris, France on November 6, 2002. It premiered in the US at Cinerama Dome in Hollywood on November 17, 2002, The film is &quot;the first major studio feature&quot; to be released in regular and IMAX theaters simultaneously; this was done in the light of the success of Disney films that were re-released in IMAX format, such as &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;. Dick Cook, then-chairman of Walt Disney Studios, expressed the hope that it would be a good way to distinguish themselves during the competitive holiday season.

===Home media===
&quot;Treasure Planet&quot; was released on VHS and DVD in the United States and Canada by Walt Disney Home Entertainment on April 29, 2003. The DVD includes behind-the-scenes featurettes, a visual commentary, deleted scenes, teaser and theatrical trailers, the music video for the song &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; by John Rzeznik, and a virtual tour of the RLS Legacy.

== Reception ==
===Box office===
&quot;Treasure Planet&quot; grossed over $12 million on its debut weekend, ranking at fourth place behind &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, James Bond&#x27;s &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, and Disney&#x27;s own &quot;The Santa Clause 2&quot;. During the five-day Thanksgiving holiday weekend, the film grossed just $16.5 million. The film ended up grossing $38.1 million domestically and $71.4 million internationally for a $109.5 million worldwide gross. Its failure became apparent early on, as Disney&#x27;s Buena Vista Distribution arm reduced its fourth-quarter earnings by $47 million within a few days of the film&#x27;s release. In 2014, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; listed the film as one of the most expensive box office failures of all time.

===Critical response===
&quot;Treasure Planet&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that of critics have given the film a positive review based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critics consensus states &quot;Though its characterizations are weaker than usual, &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; offers a fast-paced, beautifully rendered vision of outer space.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 60 out of 100 based on 30 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, who gave it 4 stars out of 5, stated that the film &quot;boasts the purest of Disney raptures: It unites the generations, rather than driving them apart&quot;. Leah Rozen of &quot;People&quot; stated that the film &quot;has imagination, humor aplenty and moves briskly&quot;, and that &quot;the animation, combining traditional and digital techniques, is ravishing.&quot; Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; said that the film&#x27;s most noteworthy feature is &quot;the artful way it combines the futuristic and the retro&quot;, and went on to say that the film does not have the &quot;charm of &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;&quot; nor the &quot;dazzling artistry of &quot;Spirited Away&quot;&quot;, but concluded that &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; is &quot;a capable and diverting holiday season adventure for a family audience.&quot; Kim Hollis of Box Office Prophets stated that &quot;there&#x27;s plenty to recommend the film – the spectacular visuals alone make &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; a worthwhile watch,&quot; though expressing disappointment because she felt that the characters were &quot;not all that creatively rendered&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it 2.5 stars out of 4; he felt that a more traditional take on the story would have been &quot;more exciting&quot; and &quot;less gimmicky&quot;. Andy Klein of &quot;Daily Variety Gotham&quot; complained about the script, describing it as &quot;listless&quot; and remarked, &quot;If only its script were as amusing as its visuals.&quot; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as &quot;less an act of homage than a clumsy and cynical bit of piracy&quot;, and went on to say that it is &quot;not much of a movie at all&quot; and a &quot;brainless, mechanical picture&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the film as &quot;all cutesy updated fripperies and zero momentum.&quot;

In 2020, Petrana Radulovic, writing for &quot;Polygon&quot;, praised the characters of Jim and Silver, as well as the &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; sequence and stated, the film &quot;is a visual delight, a time capsule of the early 2000s in a way that perhaps no other animated movie of the era is. It boldly, unapologetically pushes the visual limits of genre expectation in a way no Disney movie has since.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===

The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature along with &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;, &quot;Ice Age&quot; and &quot;&quot;, but all four films lost to &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (2001). It was also nominated for a number of Annie Awards.
==Cancelled franchise==
Before &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; premiered in cinemas, Thomas Schumacher, then-president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, mentioned the possibilities of having direct-to-video releases for &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; as well as a television series. He stated that they already had &quot;a story and some storyboards and concepts up and a script for what a sequel to [&quot;Treasure Planet&quot;] could be,&quot; and that they also had a &quot;notion&quot; of what the series would be.

Director Jun Falkenstein and screenwriter Evan Spiliotopoulos began early development on &quot;Treasure Planet 2&quot;. In the sequel, Jim Hawkins and Kate, his love interest and classmate at the Royal Interstellar Academy, must team with Long John Silver to stop the villainous Ironbeard from freeing the inmates of Botany Bay Prison Asteroid. Gordon-Levitt and Murray were set to reprise their roles as Hawkins and Silver and Willem Dafoe was going to voice Ironbeard. Tommy Walter was asked to write and perform songs for the film. However, the sequel was canceled when &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; did poorly at the box office.

Following the box office failure of &quot;&quot; (2001), Disneyland planned a second attempt to revive its Submarine Voyage ride with a &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; theme. These plans were scrapped due to the film experiencing the same financial performance as its predecessor. The attraction ultimately reopened in 2007 as the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage, themed to the 2003 Disney/Pixar animated film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;.

== Video games ==
Several &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; video games were released. In October 2002, Disney Interactive released the naval strategy game &quot;Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon&quot; for the PC, while in November, Sony Computer Entertainment released two separate &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; 3D platform action video games for the PlayStation (developed by Magenta Software) and PlayStation 2 (developed by Bizarre Creations). Bizarre Creations used Softimage&#x27;s XSI engine for modeling, texturing and animation, and released a Making-of video on their Facebook page in 2008. A Game Boy Advance game based on the film was also released.

A series of games collectively called &quot;Disney&#x27;s Treasure Planet: Training Academy&quot; (or &quot;Disney&#x27;s Treasure Planet Collection&quot;) was also released in 2002. It was composed of three games (&quot;Broadside Blast&quot;, &quot;Treasure Racer&quot;, and &quot;Etherium Rescue&quot;), and players with all three games could unlock a fourth game (&quot;Ship Shape&quot;).

Jim Hawkins and John Silver also appear as playable characters in the video game &quot;Disney Heroes: Battle Mode&quot;.

=== Reception ===
The game was met with mixed to negative reception upon release. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 66.43% and 68 out of 100 for the Game Boy Advance version; 64% and 61 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; and 57.14% and 44 out of 100 for the PlayStation version.

== Legacy ==
On November 27, 2022, Disney D23 posted on Twitter: &quot;It has been 20 years since Jim Hawkins rattled the stars in 
@DisneyAnimation&#x27;s Treasure Planet! Happy anniversary to this stellar film!&quot; A limited commemorative pin was also released by the company for the anniversary as well as a Sketchbook Ornament. Many members of the crew who worked on the film including directors John Musker and Ron Clements, composer James Newton Howard as well as actor Corey Burton also celebrated its anniversary by partaking in a 3-hour livestream on YouTube on &quot;The Tammy Tuckey Show.&quot; The event had been organised ahead of time.

<doc id="648787" wikidata="Q418088" url="?curid=648787" title="Aryl halide">
<text>In organic chemistry, an aryl halide (also known as a haloarene) is an aromatic compound in which one or more hydrogen atoms directly bonded to an aromatic ring are replaced by a halide (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine). Aryl halides are distinct from haloalkanes (alkyl halides) due to significant differences in their methods of preparation, chemical reactivity, and physical properties. The most common and important members of this class are aryl chlorides, but the group encompasses a wide range of derivatives with diverse applications in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and materials science.

==Classification according to halide==

===Aryl fluorides===
Aryl fluorides are used as synthetic intermediates, e.g. for the preparation of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and liquid crystals. The conversion of diazonium salts is a well established route to aryl fluorides. Thus, anilines are precursors to aryl fluorides. In the classic Schiemann reaction, tetrafluoroborate is the fluoride donor:
In some cases, the fluoride salt is used:

Many commercial aryl fluorides are produced from aryl chlorides by the Halex process. The method is often used for aryl chlorides also bearing electron-withdrawing groups. Illustrative is the synthesis of 2-fluoronitrobenzene from 2-nitrochlorobenzene:

===Aryl chlorides===
Aryl chlorides are the aryl halides produced on the largest scale commercially: 150,000 tons/y in the US alone (1994). Production levels are decreasing owing to environmental concerns. Chlorobenzenes are used mainly as solvents. 

Friedel-Crafts halogenation or &quot;direct chlorination&quot; is the main synthesis route. Lewis acids, e.g. iron(III) chloride, catalyze the reactions. The most abundantly produced aryl halide, chlorobenzene, is produced by this route:
Monochlorination of benzene is accompanied by formation of the dichlorobenzene derivatives. Arenes with electron donating groups react with halogens even in the absence of Lewis acids. For example, phenols and anilines react quickly with chlorine and bromine water to give multihalogenated products. Many detailed laboratory procedures are available. For alkylbenzene derivatives, e.g. toluene, the alkyl positions tend to be halogenated by free radical conditions, whereas ring halogenation is favored in the presence of Lewis acids. The decolouration of bromine water by electron-rich arenes is used in the bromine test.

The oxychlorination of benzene has been well investigated, motivated by the avoidance of HCl as a coproduct in the direct halogenation:
This technology is not widely used however.

The Gatterman reaction can also be used to convert diazonium salts to chlorobenzenes using copper-based reagents. Owing to high cost of diazonium salts, this method is reserved for specialty chlorides.

===Aryl bromides===
The main aryl bromides produced commercially are tetrabromophthalic anhydride, decabromodiphenyl ether, and tetrabromobisphenol-A. These materials are used as flame retardants. They are produced by direct bromination of phenols and aryl ethers. Phthalic anhydride is poorly reactive toward bromine, necessitating the use of acidic media.

The Gatterman reaction can also be used to convert diazonium salts to bromobenzenes using copper-based reagents. Owing to high cost of diazonium salts, this method is reserved for specialty bromides.

===Aryl iodides===
Synthetic aryl iodides are used as X-ray contrast agents, but otherwise these compounds are not produced on a large scale. Aryl iodides are &quot;easy&quot; substrates for many reactions such as cross-coupling reactions and conversion to Grignard reagents, but they are much more expensive than the lighter, less reactive aryl chlorides and bromides.

Aryl iodides can be prepared by treating diazonium salts with iodide salts. Electron-rich arenes such as anilines and dimethoxy derivatives react directly with iodine.

Aryl lithium and aryl Grignard reagents react with iodine to give the aryl halide:
This method is applicable to the preparation of all aryl halides. One limitation is that most, but not all, aryl lithium and Grignard reagents are produced from aryl halides.

==Classification according to aryl group==

===Halobenzenes and halobenzene derivatives===

Although the term &quot;aryl halide&quot; includes halogenated derivatives of any aromatic compound, it commonly refers to halobenzenes, which are specifically halogenated derivatives of benzene. Groups of halobenzenes include fluorobenzenes, chlorobenzenes, bromobenzenes, and iodobenzenes, as well as mixed halobenzenes containing at least two different types of halogens bonded to the same benzene ring. There are also many halobenzene derivatives.

===Halopyridines===
Halopyridines are based on the aromatic compound pyridine. This includes chloropyridines and bromopyridines. Chloropyridines are important intermediates to pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

===Halogenated naphthalenes===
Halogenated naphthalenes are based on naphthalene. Polychlorinated naphthalenes were used extensively from the 1930s to 1950s in cable and capacitor production, due to their insulating, hydrophobic, and flame retardant properties, but they have since been phased out for this use due to toxicity, environmental persistence, and introduction of new materials.

==Aryl halides in nature==
The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are aryl iodides. A tetraiodide, T4 is biosynthesised by electrophilic iodination of tyrosine derivative. Synthetic T4 is one of the most heavily prescribed medicines in the U.S.

Many chlorinated and brominated aromatic compounds are produced by marine organisms. Chloride and bromide ions in ocean waters are the source of the halogens. Various peroxidase enzymes (e.g., bromoperoxidase) catalyze the formation of these natural aryl chlorides and bromides. Numerous are derivatives of electron-rich rings found in tyrosine, tryptophan, and various pyrroles. Some of these natural aryl halides exhibit useful medicinal properties.


==Structural trends==
The C-X distances for aryl halides follow the expected trend. These distances for fluorobenzene, chlorobenzene, bromobenzene, and methyl 4-iodobenzoate are 135.6(4), 173.90(23), 189.8(1), and 209.9 pm, respectively.

==Reactions==
===Substitution===
Unlike typical alkyl halides, aryl halides typically do not participate in conventional substitution reactions. Aryl halides with electron-withdrawing groups in the &quot;ortho&quot; and &quot;para&quot; positions, can undergo SNAr reactions. For example, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene reacts in basic solution to give a phenol.

Unlike in most other substitution reactions, fluoride is the best leaving group, and iodide the worst. A 2018 paper indicates that this situation may actually be rather common, occurring in systems that were previously assumed to proceed via SNAr mechanisms.

===Benzyne===
When treated with strong base, some aryl halides often react via the intermediacy of benzynes. Benzyne is an intermediate in the reaction of chlorobenzene with strongly basic reagents such as potassium amide, even at -33 °C. It is also implicated in the conversion of chlorobenzene to phenol using sodium hydroxide, which requires high temperatures.

===Organometallic reagent formation===
Aryl halides react with metals, generally lithium or magnesium, to give organometallic derivatives that function as sources of aryl anions. By the metal-halogen exchange reaction, aryl halides are converted to aryl lithium compounds. Illustrative is the preparation of phenyllithium from bromobenzene using &quot;n&quot;-butyllithium (&quot;n&quot;-BuLi):
: C6H5Br + BuLi → C6H5Li + BuBr

Direct formation of Grignard reagents, by adding the magnesium to the aryl halide in an ethereal solution, works well if the aromatic ring is not significantly deactivated by electron-withdrawing groups.

===Other reactions===
The halides can be displaced by strong nucleophiles via reactions involving radical anions. Alternatively aryl halides, especially the bromides and iodides, undergo oxidative addition, and thus are subject to Buchwald–Hartwig amination-type reactions.

=== Biodegradation ===
&quot;Rhodococcus phenolicus&quot; is a bacterium that degrades dichlorobenzene as sole carbon sources.

==Applications==

The aryl halides produced on the largest scale are chlorobenzene and the isomers of dichlorobenzene. One major but discontinued application was the use of chlorobenzene as a solvent for dispersing the herbicide Lasso. Overall, production of aryl chlorides (also naphthyl derivatives) has been declining since the 1980s, in part due to environmental concerns. Triphenylphosphine is produced from chlorobenzene:
:3 C6H5Cl + PCl3 + 6 Na → P(C6H5)3 + 6 NaCl

Some prominent herbicides are aryl chlorides.
Several chlorobenzene derivatives are used as pigments and dyes..

Aryl bromides are widely used as fire-retardants. A prominent member is tetrabromobisphenol-A, which is prepared by direct bromination of the diphenol.

<text>The Windham Textile and History Museum is a museum in Willimantic, Connecticut, in the New England region of the United States. It is currently located in Main St.

== Exhibits ==
Its main focus is the Willimantic Linen Company&#x27;s Willimantic mill, later purchased by the American Thread Company and closed in 1985. The museum is located in the former company store building.

The museum features the Brooke Shannon Antique Sewing Machine Room, which is a room which features replica sewing machines from the factory in the late-19th century. Other exhibits include a re-creation of the manager&#x27;s office, a replica of the boarding houses in the 1880s. A tour of the mill property is part of the tour, but access inside in not included due to most of the mill being on private property. There are many other displays that feature what was life like during the turn of the century at the mill in Willimantic.

<doc id="648793" wikidata="Q332169" url="?curid=648793" title="Troy Brown">
<text>Troy Fitzgerald Brown (born July 2, 1971) is an American professional football coach and former player who serves as an offensive assistant for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). He played as a wide receiver and return specialist for 15 seasons in the NFL, spending his entire career with the Patriots. Brown played college football at Marshall University and was selected by the Patriots in the eighth round of the 1993 NFL draft. During his New England tenure, he was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2001 and was a member of the franchise&#x27;s first three Super Bowl-winning teams. In 2020, Brown rejoined the Patriots as an offensive assistant. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2010. Brown also was inducted to the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Early life==
Brown attended Blackville–Hilda High School in Blackville, South Carolina. He was discouraged from playing football, as he was thought too small, beginning at 5&#x27;6&quot;, 135 lbs. Still, he lettered in football and track and field. His high school team won a state championship in 1988 with a 14–1 record.

==College career==
Brown attended Lees–McRae College before it became a 4-year college in 1989–1990. In college, Brown was a standout wide receiver, punt returner, and kickoff returner for Marshall University, leading the Division I-AA in both kickoff and punt return average in 1991, a year in which he and quarterback Todd Donnan tied a record by combining for a 99-yard pass play against Virginia Military Institute. The following year, Marshall claimed its first national championship with Brown as its primary wide receiver and returner. In the championship game, Brown sealed the win by intercepting a Hail Mary Youngstown State pass in the final seconds of the game.

His career kickoff return average (29.69 yards per return) still stands as an NCAA record, as do his four kickoff returns for touchdowns. He scored one touchdown for every eight times he touched the football.

In 2006, Brown was given a distinguished alumni award by his alma mater, Marshall.

==Professional career==
Brown was drafted by the Patriots out of Marshall in the eighth round of the 1993 NFL draft (198th overall). He was waived as a final cut in the 1994 pre-season by head coach Bill Parcells but was re-signed on October 19, 1994. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1995 season that he started seeing time as a wide receiver, recording 14 catches for 159 yards. The next season in 1996, when the New England Patriots reached the Super Bowl, he recorded 21 catches for 222 yards. In 1997, he recorded 41 catches for 607 yards and 6 touchdowns despite being behind both Terry Glenn and Shawn Jefferson on the depth chart at receiver as well as competing with Ben Coates and Vincent Brisby for catches. In 1998, he resumed his duties as a punt returner.

His first year as a starter was 2000, when he recorded 83 catches for 944 yards and 4 touchdowns. In 2001 he, alongside Tom Brady, led the Patriots to their first ever Super Bowl championship, recording 101 catches during the season for 1,199 yards and 5 touchdowns, setting the franchise record for receptions and earning his first and only trip to the Pro Bowl. He also returned 29 punts for 413 yards and 2 touchdowns, giving him a league-leading 14.2 yards per return average. During the AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the playoffs that season, Brown returned a crucial punt for a touchdown which provided the winning margin, adding to the two he returned for touchdowns during the regular season. He also scooped up a blocked field goal attempt in that game, and made a lateral pass to teammate Antwan Harris, which completed a second special teams touchdown. In 2002, he recorded 97 receptions for 890 yards and 3 touchdowns. In 2003, he had 40 catches for 472 yards, helping his team back to Super Bowl XXXVIII.

In 2004, he had only 17 receptions, but contributed in what was originally an emergency role on defense, ranking second on the team in interceptions with three. He was topped in this category only by Eugene Wilson. Further demonstrating his versatility, during the 2006 preseason he lined up as an emergency quarterback; when questioned as to why Brown had appeared there, the head coach of the Patriots, Bill Belichick, joked that he had lined Brown up there &quot;to develop his legend&quot;.

Brown was released by the Patriots on March 1, 2005, for salary cap reasons, but he signed a new contract with them on May 23, 2005. He signed despite a better financial deal from the New Orleans Saints. In the 2005 season, he recorded 39 receptions for 466 yards.

On July 17, 2007, Brown reached an agreement with the New England Patriots for a 15th season, making him the second longest-playing Patriot at the time behind Steve Grogan; both have since been surpassed by Tom Brady. On July 28, he was placed on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list, but was activated on November 27.

In addition to playing offense and defense with success, Brown is the Patriots&#x27; all-time leading punt returner with 252 returns for 2,625 yards and 3 touchdowns. He is third all-time in Patriots history in receptions (557) and third all-time in receiving yards (6,366). He still holds the Super Bowl record for most punt returns in a career with 8.

Brown is the only player in NFL history with at least 550 receptions, 250 punt returns, and an interception.

===2006 AFC divisional playoffs===
A memorable moment for Brown came in a 2006 AFC Divisional Playoff game, when the Patriots met the favored San Diego Chargers. With 5 minutes left in the game, the Patriots were down 21–13 and facing 4th and 5. Tom Brady threw his third interception of the game, to the Chargers&#x27; Marlon McCree. Brown, making what teammate Tedy Bruschi described as a &quot;quick mental switch&quot; from offensive to defensive player, instinctively ripped the ball out of McCree&#x27;s grasp. The fumble was subsequently recovered by the Patriots Reche Caldwell, giving them a new set of downs. New England went on to tie the score with a touchdown and a two-point conversion, and then won the game on a 31-yard field goal. Brown also caught 5 passes for 39 yards in the game.

===Legacy===
Brown is a fan favorite among many Patriots fans due to his style of play and years of dedication to his team. His punt return in the 2001 AFC Championship along with numerous big plays throughout his Patriots career culminated in his induction into the Patriots Hall of Fame at Patriots Place.

===Retirement===
On March 13, 2008, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that the Patriots would not offer Brown a contract for the 2008 season. On September 25, 2008, Brown officially retired from professional football during a press conference alongside Patriots owner Robert Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick. He finished his playing career as the all-time leader for the New England Patriots in receptions with 557.

On June 4, 2012, it was announced that Brown was elected to the Patriots Hall of Fame by fan vote, beating out former head coach Bill Parcells and safety Fred Marion.

==Coaching==
At the beginning of the 2019 NFL season, he began coaching in an unofficial capacity with the New England Patriots, assisting wide receivers coach Joe Judge, who was often busy with his other role as special teams coordinator. In addition in 2016 he was a part of the Bill Walsh Minority Coaching Fellowship working with the Patriots.

In 2020 it was officially announced that Brown was on the Patriots coaching staff. He would be serving as the teams running backs/kick returners coach.

In 2021, Brown was announced as the wide receivers/kick returners coach.

In 2024, Brown was moved to a skills development role.

===Business===
Brown is an investor in and spokesman for the Narragansett Brewing Company.

==Personal life==
Brown currently resides in Huntington, West Virginia, where a portion of West Virginia Route 10 was designated Troy Brown Way. Brown and his ex-wife Kimberly (who works as a chemist for the United States Army Corps of Engineers), have two sons, Sir&#x27;mon and Saanjay.

He works with various charities through the Troy Brown Fantasy Football Camp. He also worked with the Bartrum Brown Football Camp from 2001 through 2011.

<doc id="648798" wikidata="Q3677292" url="?curid=648798" title="Five economic tests">
<text>The five economic tests were the criteria defined by the UK treasury under Gordon Brown that were to be used to assess the UK&#x27;s readiness to join the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union (EMU), and so adopt the euro as its official currency. In principle, these tests were distinct from any political decision to join.

The five tests were as follows:

#Are business cycles and economic structures compatible so that we and others could live comfortably with euro interest rates on a permanent basis?
#If problems emerge is there sufficient flexibility to deal with them?
#Would joining EMU create better conditions for firms making long-term decisions to invest in Britain?
#What impact would entry into EMU have on the competitive position of the UK&#x27;s financial services industry, particularly the City&#x27;s wholesale markets?
#In summary, will joining EMU promote higher growth, stability and a lasting increase in jobs?

In addition to these self-imposed criteria the UK would also have had to have met the European Union&#x27;s economic convergence criteria (&quot;Maastricht criteria&quot;) before being allowed to adopt the euro. One criterion is two years&#x27; membership of ERM II, of which the UK was never a member. Under the Maastricht Treaty, the UK was not obliged to adopt the euro.

When the Brown government was voted out of office in the 2010 general election, the tests ceased to be government policy.

==History of the tests==
The five tests were designed in 1997, shortly after the Labour Party replaced the Conservatives in government, by former Chancellor Gordon Brown and his then special adviser Ed Balls. A popular story about the circumstances of Brown&#x27;s and Balls&#x27; development of the tests, which has since been discredited, is that it took place in the back of a taxi while Brown was in the United States. Despite this uncertain pedigree, the International Monetary Fund deemed them to be &quot;broadly consistent with the economic considerations that are relevant for assessing entry into a monetary union.&quot;

The UK Treasury is responsible for assessing the tests. It first did so in October 1997, when it was decided that the UK&#x27;s economy was neither sufficiently converged with that of the rest of the EU, nor sufficiently flexible, to justify a recommendation of membership at that time. The government pledged to reassess the tests early in the next Parliament (which began in June 2001), and published a revised assessment of the five tests in June 2003. This assessment ran to around 250 pages and was backed up by eighteen supporting studies, on subjects such as housing, labour market flexibility, and the euro area&#x27;s monetary and fiscal frameworks.

The conclusions were broadly similar; the Treasury argued that:
# There had been significant progress on convergence since 1997, but there remained some significant structural differences, such as in the housing market.
# While UK flexibility had improved, they could not be confident that it is sufficient.
# Euro membership would increase investment, but only if and flexibility were sufficient.
# The City of London, Britain&#x27;s financial centre, would benefit from Eurozone membership.
# Growth, stability and employment would increase as a result of euro membership, but only if convergence and flexibility were sufficient.

On the basis of this assessment, in May–June 2003, the government ruled out UK membership of the euro for the duration of the Parliament. Since the Labour government was re-elected in 2005, the debate on the European Constitution and subsequent Treaty of Lisbon upstaged that on the euro. Gordon Brown, in his first press conference after succeeding Tony Blair as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 2007, ruled out membership for the foreseeable future, saying that the decision not to join had been right for Britain and for Europe. However, in late 2008, José Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Commission, averred, saying that UK leaders were seriously considering the switch amidst the financial crisis. Brown later denied this.

One of the underlying issues that stand in the way of monetary union is the structural difference between the UK housing market and those of many continental European countries. Although home ownership in Britain is near the European average, variable rate mortgages are more common, making the retail price index in Britain more influenced by interest rate changes.

<doc id="648800" wikidata="Q1295235" url="?curid=648800" title="Edén Pastora">
<text>Edén Atanacio Pastora Gómez (November 15, 1936 or January 22, 1937 – June 16, 2020) was a Nicaraguan politician and guerrilla who ran for president as the candidate of the Alternative for Change (AC) party in the 2006 general elections. In the years prior to the fall of the Somoza regime, Pastora was the leader of the Southern Front, the largest militia in southern Nicaragua, second only to the FSLN (Sandinista National Liberation Front) in the north. Pastora was nicknamed &quot;Comandante Cero&quot; (&quot;Commander Zero&quot;).

His group was the first to call itself &quot;Sandinistas&quot;, and was also the first to accept an alliance with the FSLN, the group that was to become more popularly identified by the name. At the end of 1982, a few years after the revolutionary victory, Pastora became disillusioned with the government of the FSLN, and formed the Democratic Revolutionary Alliance (ARDE) with the object of confronting the &quot;pseudo-Sandinistas&quot; politically and militarily.

As of 2010, he was reconciled with the FSLN and held a ministerial post in the government of Daniel Ortega. His role in a border dispute with Costa Rica and allegations of environmental damage to territory claimed by that country led to legal indictment by the government of Costa Rica.

==Sandinista==

Pastora was born in Ciudad Darío. When he was seven, Pastora&#x27;s father was killed in a boundary dispute. While in high school with the Jesuits in Granada, he first learned about Augusto César Sandino through his Panamanian history teacher. He began his rebel career when he decided that the government of Anastasio Somoza Debayle was corrupt and formed the southern Nicaraguan ARDE from local peasant farmers (called campesinos) and aboriginal tribes living according to more traditional ways.

On December 27, 1974, an FSLN commando unit, headed by Pastora, burst into the house of Josè Maria Castillo, president of the Banco Central, and took his guests hostage (including two relatives of the dictator Somoza). Three days later, thanks to the Managua archbishop&#x27;s intermediation, the hostages were released, in exchange for a million dollars and the freedom of some political prisoners. Castillo was the only victim of the action.

Pastora allied himself with the FSLN in the mid-1960s. He became a rebel guerrilla and was the mastermind behind the August 1978 standoff in the Nicaraguan National Palace, in which he and 19 FSLN commandos disguised as members of Somoza&#x27;s National Guard stormed the Palace, disarming or killing the real Nicaraguan National Guard members. Among the hostages taken were members of the Nicaraguan Congress, which was in session at the time of the attack, and Somoza&#x27;s half brother, José Somoza. Members of the commando used numbers as codenames, with Pastora as Zero, and Dora María Téllez as Commander &quot;two&quot; leading to a lasting identification of Eden as Comandante Cero and Dora Maria as Commander &quot;two.&quot;

The operation infuriated Somoza and was considered one of the turning points in the insurgency. Originally organized to free FSLN members imprisoned by the regime — among the prisoners being Daniel Ortega and Tomás Borge — the raid marked an uncontested victory for the FSLN. After negotiating a USD$500,000 deal with Somoza and Cardinal Miguel Obando, Pastora, Ortega and other released prisoners left for Cuba, where he claimed to have been a &quot;prisoner&quot; lavished with women and luxury, but not allowed to leave the country until Martín Torrijos, the son of then Panamanian strongman Omar Torrijos and Pastora&#x27;s personal friend, voiced his concern and went to Cuba to rescue him personally.

Pastora was put in command of the FSLN&#x27;s Southern Front, advancing on the town of Rivas from bases in Costa Rica. In reaction to Pastora&#x27;s widely held reputation, Somoza sent his best troops against him and as a consequence the Southern Front made little headway while suffering heavy casualties. However, the Southern Front contributed to the Sandinista victory by tying down over 2,000 heavily equipped Nicaraguan National Guard forces, as Somoza remained fixated on stopping Pastora, even as major cities fell to the rebels.

==Contra==

Pastora became disenchanted with the turn of the revolution when most of the Sandinista leaders moved to the luxury residences of Managua; he felt the leadership was doing too little to benefit the &quot;campesinos&quot; and aboriginal tribes he represented and was overly concerned with propagating ideological consistency in a poorly concealed bid to consolidate Ortega&#x27;s political power. Pastora turned against the Sandinista regime. He once again began military operations in southern Nicaragua, loosely federated with northern forces which, composed mostly of highly paid former National Guard members and some Miskito Indians, were collectively referred to as the Contras. From a military standpoint, Pastora&#x27;s efforts contributed much less than did forces in the north.

Pastora also received less support from the US government; whether his performance was a result or cause of this disparity is subject to debate. Military achievements aside, the presence of Pastora, a former FSLN revolutionary hero, among the Contras, helped the public image of the Contras abroad and provided a sort of public-relations counterweight to the bad reputation accorded to the FDN faction (mostly led by ex-National-Guard &quot;Somocistas&quot;). However, Pastora soon lost whatever popularity he might have had among common Nicaraguans as he adopted the strategy of the northern Contras, committing human rights abuses while mostly avoiding direct encounters with the Nicaraguan military.

In 1984, Pastora was apparently the intended target of the La Penca bombing, which killed four people at a press conference he was holding. He was seriously wounded.

Pastora became disillusioned with Nicaragua and became a refugee in Costa Rica during the 1990s, where he became a citizen. Later, however, he returned to Nicaragua.

==Later years==
Pastora since opened a shark fishing business in San Juan del Norte on the San Juan River along the border with Costa Rica.

He was seen at a Sandinista demonstration over the slow certification of winners in the November 5, 2000 municipal elections.

Álvaro Pardo made a documentary about Pastora in 2006 called &quot;Edén Pastora - Comandante Cero&quot;. It portrays Pastora&#x27;s return to the political arena of Nicaragua when he was nominated as a candidate for the mayor of Managua.

Pastora ran for president in the general election of 2006. He finished in fifth place, with 0.29% of the vote. In 2008, Pastora announced that he had become reconciled with the current FSLN and pledged support for the government of Daniel Ortega. He is quoted as saying, &quot;this government is making a revolution, one-eyed or lame, but it is a revolution.&quot; As of 2010, he held the title of Minister of Development of the Rio San Juan Basin.

In November 2010, in perhaps the most publicized Costa Rican arrest warrant issued in years, prosecutors in northern Caribbean canton of Pococí announced that Pastora, now 73 years old, had been indicted for severe environmental damage caused in the eastern Limón Province near the Río San Juan that the Republic of Nicaragua claims to be a part of their territory. In a taunt taken at face value by many in the international media, Pastora (and the Nicaraguan Government) based his arguments not on official maps but on faulty border information obtained from Google Maps. Pastora and his soldiers invaded the Caleros Island in order to create a channel connecting the San Juan River with the Atlantic Ocean. The government of Costa Rica, which disputes ownership of the island with Nicaragua, holds that this has caused irreparable ecological destruction.

In April 2015 photos show the now 78-year-old Pastora watching as the canal that provoked the international incident was filled with sand. He is well above the ground watching from a ladder lashed to trees.

==Personal life and death==
Pastora had three failed marriages. Lamenting about the interpersonal strains that occur in the life of a revolutionary, Pastora said: &quot;The first thing we revolutionaries lose is our wives. The last thing we lose is our lives. In between our women and our lives, we lose our freedom, our happiness, our means of living.&quot;

Pastora died at a military hospital in Managua on June 16, 2020, at the age of 83. The cause of death was reported variously as either respiratory failure or a heart attack. While hospitalized, Pastora was also treated for symptoms of COVID-19, although his grandson said he was not tested for the coronavirus.

<doc id="648803" wikidata="Q257211" url="?curid=648803" title="Mirjana Marković">
<text>Mirjana &quot;Mira&quot; Marković (, ; 10 July 1942 – 14 April 2019) was a Serbian politician, academic and the wife of Yugoslav and Serbian president Slobodan Milošević.

She was the leader of the far-left Yugoslav United Left (JUL) which governed in coalition with Milošević&#x27;s Socialist Party of Serbia in the aftermath of the Bosnian War. She was reported to have huge influence over her husband and was increasingly seen as the power behind the throne. Among her opponents, she was known as The Red Witch and the Lady Macbeth of Belgrade.

Marković was accused of abuse of office, inciting several associates to allocate a state-owned apartment for her grandson’s nanny in September 2000. She was indicted in December 2002 and fled Belgrade on 23 February 2003. In June 2018, she was declared guilty &quot;in absentia&quot; by a court in Belgrade, and sentenced to a year&#x27;s imprisonment, but the verdict was overturned on appeal in March 2019.

Marković lived under political asylum in Moscow, Russia, from February 2003 until her death in 2019.

==Life==
===Early life===
Marković was the daughter of Moma Marković and Vera Miletić, who were both fighting for the Yugoslav Partisans at the time of her birth. Her aunt was Davorjanka Paunović, private secretary and alleged mistress of Josip Broz Tito. Her mother Vera was captured by German troops and allegedly released sensitive information, under torture. She was then executed in the Banjica concentration camp by the Nazis.

Marković met Slobodan Milošević when they were in high school together. They married in 1965. The couple had two children, son Marko and daughter Marija, who founded TV Košava in 1998 and was its owner until the overthrow of Milošević on 5 October 2000.

===Education and career===
Marković held a Ph.D. in sociology and taught the subject at the University of Belgrade. Later, she became an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

She was considered to be the only person her husband trusted, her influence being considered a source for the increase in Milošević strong anti-western rhetoric and actions. &quot;She invented him&quot;, Milošević biographer Slavoljub Đukić told the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; in 1998. &quot;There has never been such a powerful woman in the history of Serbia as Mirjana Marković. And she has been fatal for Serbia.&quot; As the leader of her own political party, Yugoslav United Left she held some political influence. Marković was largely responsible for erecting the Eternal Flame monument, shortly before the overthrow of Milošević in 2000. She was believed, though not formally accused, of being involved in the murders of her husband&#x27;s political rivals including the Serbian politician Ivan Stambolić, Milošević&#x27;s former mentor, in 2000, and the journalist Slavko Ćuruvija the previous year. &quot;Milošević has never had any political ideas of his own&quot;, Stambolić said in 2000. &quot;They&#x27;ve all been hers.&quot; She wrote a political column in the weekly Serbian magazine &quot;Duga&quot; during the sequence of wars in the 1990s. Observers read it for any coded messages. In the old Yugoslavia, she once wrote &quot;Serbs, Muslims and Croats were able to live side by side&quot;, though her husband and his associates presided over its destruction.

Marković was the author of many books, which were translated and sold in Canada, Russia, China, and India.

===Political views===
Marković&#x27;s political views tended to be hard-line Communist. Although she often claimed that she agreed with her husband on everything, Milošević seems to have had fewer authoritarian tendencies than Marković.

Marković reportedly had little respect for the Bosnian Serb leaders. Vojislav Šešelj appeared before a court on 18 June 1994 to face charges of breaking microphone cables in Parliament. He read a statement, saying, &quot;Mr. Judge, all I can say in my defense is that Milošević is Serbia&#x27;s biggest criminal.&quot; Marković replied by calling Šešelj a &quot;primitive Turk who is afraid to fight like a man, and instead sits around insulting other people&#x27;s wives.&quot; Radovan Karadžić was apparently unable to telephone Milošević because Marković would not tolerate his calls.

Commenting on her husband&#x27;s arrest to face war crimes charges, Marković stated:

===Asylum in Russia and death===
Pursued by legal authorities, Marković settled in Russia in 2003. The authorities of Serbia issued an arrest warrant for her on fraud charges which was circulated via Interpol, but the Russian authorities refused to arrest her.

In March 2012, a collection of her columns for &quot;Pravda&quot; from 2007 to 2008, as well as for online portal &quot;Sloboda&quot; from 2010 to 2011, titled &quot;Destierrada e imperdida&quot; was published in Belgrade by &quot;Treći milenijum&quot;, a publishing house owned by Hadži Dragan Antić.

After the 2012 elections, a government minister, Milutin Mrkonjić of the Socialist Party (which he co-founded with Milošević) said that Marković and her son were welcome to return. In June 2018, Marković was found guilty &quot;in absentia&quot; of real estate fraud charges, and sentenced to a year in prison. The Serbian Appeals Court in March 2019 rejected her conviction, finding it unsound, and ordered a new trial.

Marković underwent several surgeries, and died in Moscow on 14 April 2019. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported her death was caused by complications due to pneumonia. Her body was cremated and interred in Požarevac alongside her husband on 20 April 2019.

<doc id="648807" wikidata="Q411412" url="?curid=648807" title="Rofecoxib">
<text>Rofecoxib is a COX-2-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It was marketed by Merck &amp; Co. to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain conditions, migraine, and dysmenorrhea. Rofecoxib was approved in the US by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 1999, and was marketed under the brand names Vioxx, Ceoxx, and Ceeoxx. Rofecoxib was available by prescription in both tablets and as an oral suspension.

Rofecoxib gained widespread use among physicians treating patients with arthritis and other conditions causing chronic or acute pain. Worldwide, over 80 million people were prescribed rofecoxib at some time.

In September 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use. Merck withdrew the drug after disclosures that it withheld information about rofecoxib&#x27;s risks from doctors and patients for over five years, allegedly resulting in between 88,000 and 140,000 cases of serious heart disease. Rofecoxib was one of the most widely used drugs ever to be withdrawn from the market. In the year before withdrawal, Merck had sales revenue of US$2.5 billion from Vioxx.

In 2005, the FDA issued a memorandum concluding that risks for serious cardiovascular (CV) events seem to be as great for nonselective NSAIDs as for COX-2–selective agents such as rofecoxib, according to long-term, controlled clinical trials. Based on data up to 2015, the FDA reasserted the likelihood of an increased risk of serious adverse CV events from COX-2–selective and nonselective NSAIDs, dependent on dose and duration.

In November 2017, Massachusetts-based Tremeau Pharmaceuticals announced its plan to return rofecoxib (TRM-201) to market as a treatment for hemophilic arthropathy (HA). Tremeau announced that the FDA had granted an orphan designation for TRM-201 (rofecoxib) for the treatment of HA, and that they had received FDA feedback on their development plan. HA is a degenerative joint disease caused by recurrent intra-articular bleeding. It is the largest cause of morbidity in patients with hemophilia and has no currently approved treatment options in the United States. Traditional NSAIDs are avoided in this population due to their effects on platelet aggregation and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, and high potency opioids are the current standard of care in treating HA.

==Mode of action==

Cyclooxygenase (COX) has two well-studied isoforms, called COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 mediates the synthesis of prostaglandins responsible for protection of the stomach lining, while COX-2 mediates the synthesis of prostaglandins responsible for pain and inflammation. By creating &quot;selective&quot; NSAIDs that inhibit COX-2, but not COX-1, the same pain relief as traditional NSAIDs is offered, but with greatly reduced risk of fatal or debilitating peptic ulcers. Rofecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor, or &quot;coxib&quot;.

Though the class of coxibs includes several agents, degrees of COX-2 selectivity vary among them, with celecoxib (Celebrex) being the least COX-2 selective, and rofecoxib (Vioxx), valdecoxib (Bextra), and etoricoxib (Arcoxia), being highly COX-2 selective.

At the time of its withdrawal, rofecoxib was the only coxib approved in the United States with clinical evidence of its superior gastrointestinal adverse effect profile over conventional NSAIDs. This was largely based on the VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The therapeutic recommended dosages were 12.5, 25, and 50 mg with an approximate bioavailability of 93%. Rofecoxib crossed the placenta and blood–brain barrier, and took 1–3 hours to reach peak plasma concentration with an effective half-life (based on steady-state levels) around 17 hours. The metabolic products are cis-dihydro and trans-dihydro derivatives of rofecoxib which are primarily excreted through urine.

== Efficacy ==
Rofecoxib was approved by the FDA to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain conditions, migraine, and dysmenorrhea. When it was marketed, it gained widespread acceptance among physicians treating patients with arthritis and other conditions causing chronic or acute pain.

=== Premenstrual acne ===
A 2003 placebo-controlled, small, short-term study in India of 80 women with premenstrual acne vulgaris, were given rofecoxib or placebo for two cycles of 10 days suggest that &quot;rofecoxib is effective in the management of premenstrual acne.

===Fabricated efficacy studies===
On March 11, 2009, Scott S. Reuben, former chief of acute pain at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Mass., revealed that data for 21 studies he had authored for the efficacy of the drug (along with others such as celecoxib) had been fabricated, overstating the analgesic effects of the drugs. No evidence has been found that Reuben colluded with Merck in falsifying his data. Reuben was also a former paid spokesperson for the drug company Pfizer (which owns the intellectual property rights for marketing celecoxib in the United States). The retracted studies were not submitted to either the FDA or the European Union&#x27;s regulatory agencies prior to the drug&#x27;s approval. Drug manufacturer Merck had no comment on the disclosure.

==Side effects==

In addition to the reduced incidence of gastric ulceration, rofecoxib exhibits no effect on bleeding time or platelet aggregation, even at supratherapeutic doses.  Aside from these features, rofecoxib exhibits a similar adverse-effect profile to other NSAIDs.

===Heart and blood vessels===

====VIGOR study and publishing controversy====
The VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, conducted by Bombardier, et al., compared the efficacy and adverse-effect profiles of a supratherapeutic dose of rofecoxib (50 mg/day) vs. a common dose of naproxen (500 mg/BID), had indicated a significant four-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, relative risk 0.25) over a mean duration of 9 months. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. No significant difference in the mortality from cardiovascular events was seen between the two groups, nor did any significant difference occur in the rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and naproxen treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. The difference in overall risk was by the patients at higher risk of heart attack, i.e. those meeting the criteria for low-dose aspirin prophylaxis of secondary cardiovascular events (previous myocardial infarction, angina, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or coronary artery bypass).

Merck&#x27;s scientists interpreted the finding as a protective effect of naproxen, telling the FDA that the difference in heart attacks &quot;is primarily due to&quot; this protective effect. The Martin Report excused senior management by stating they believed they were victims of Pfizer&#x27;s alleged manipulation of test results to promote their product as a safer alternative. Some commentators have noted that naproxen would have to be three times as effective as aspirin to account for all of the difference, and some outside scientists warned Merck that this claim was implausible before VIGOR was published. No evidence has since emerged for such a large cardioprotective effect of naproxen, although a number of studies have found protective effects similar in size to those of aspirin.

The results of the VIGOR study were submitted to the US FDA in February 2001. In September 2001, the FDA sent a warning letter to the CEO of Merck, stating, &quot;Your promotional campaign discounts the fact that in the VIGOR study, patients on Vioxx were observed to have a four- to five-fold increase in myocardial infarctions (MIs) compared to patients on the comparator nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Naprosyn (naproxen).&quot; This led to the introduction, in April 2002, of warnings on Vioxx labeling concerning the increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack and stroke).

Months after the preliminary version of VIGOR was published in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; in November 2000, the journal editors learned that certain data reported to the FDA were not included in the &quot;NEJM&quot; article. Several years later, when they were shown a Merck memo during the depositions for the first federal Vioxx trial, they realized that these data had been available to the authors months before publication. The editors wrote an editorial accusing the authors of deliberately withholding the data. They released the editorial to the media on December 8, 2005, before giving the authors a chance to respond. &quot;NEJM&quot; editor Gregory Curfman explained that the quick release was due to the imminent presentation of his deposition testimony, which he feared would be misinterpreted in the media. He had earlier denied any relationship between the timing of the editorial and the trial. Although his testimony was not actually used in the December trial, Curfman had testified well before the publication of the editorial.

The editors charged that &quot;more than four months before the article was published, at least two of its authors were aware of critical data on an array of adverse cardiovascular events that were not included in the VIGOR article.&quot; These additional data included three additional heart attacks, and raised the relative risk of Vioxx from 4.25-fold to 5-fold. All the additional heart attacks occurred in the group at low risk of heart attack (the &quot;aspirin not indicated&quot; group) and the editors noted that the omission &quot;resulted in the misleading conclusion that there was a difference in the risk of myocardial infarction between the aspirin indicated and aspirin not indicated groups.&quot; The relative risk for myocardial infarctions among the aspirin not indicated patients increased from 2.25 to 3 (although it remained statistically insignificant). The editors also noted a statistically significant (two-fold) increase in risk for serious thromboembolic events for this group, an outcome that Merck had not reported in the &quot;NEJM&quot;, though it had disclosed that information publicly in March 2000, eight months before publication.

The authors of the study, including the non-Merck authors, responded by claiming that the three additional heart attacks had occurred after the prespecified cutoff date for data collection, thus were appropriately not included. (Using the prespecified cutoff date also meant that an additional stroke in the naproxen population was not reported.) Furthermore, they said that the additional data did not qualitatively change any of the conclusions of the study, and the results of the full analyses were disclosed to the FDA and reflected on the Vioxx warning label. They further noted that all of the data in the &quot;omitted&quot; table were printed in the text of the article. The authors stood by the original article.

&quot;NEJM&quot; stood by its editorial, noting that the cutoff date was never mentioned in the article, nor did the authors report that the cutoff for cardiovascular adverse events was before that for gastrointestinal adverse events. The different cutoffs increased the reported benefits of Vioxx (reduced stomach problems) relative to the risks (increased heart attacks).

Some scientists have accused the &quot;NEJM&quot; editorial board of making unfounded accusations. Others have applauded the editorial. Renowned research cardiologist Eric Topol, a prominent Merck critic, accused Merck of &quot;manipulation of data&quot; and said &quot;I think now the scientific misconduct trial is really fully backed up&quot;. Phil Fontanarosa, executive editor of the prestigious &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot;, welcomed the editorial, saying &quot;this is another in the long list of recent examples that have generated real concerns about trust and confidence in industry-sponsored studies&quot;.

On May 15, 2006, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that a late-night email, written by an outside public relations specialist and sent to &quot;Journal&quot; staffers hours before the Expression of Concern was released, predicted that &quot;the rebuke would divert attention to Merck and induce the media to ignore the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;″s own role in aiding Vioxx sales.&quot;

&quot;Internal emails show the &quot;New England Journal&quot;&#x27;s expression of concern was timed to divert attention from a deposition in which Executive Editor Gregory Curfman made potentially damaging admissions about the journal&#x27;s handling of the Vioxx study. In the deposition, part of the Vioxx litigation, Dr. Curfman acknowledged that lax editing might have helped the authors make misleading claims in the article.&quot; The &quot;Journal&quot; stated that &quot;NEJM&quot;″s &quot;ambiguous&quot; language misled reporters into incorrectly believing that Merck had deleted data regarding the three additional heart attacks, rather than a blank table that contained no statistical information; &quot;the &quot;New England Journal&quot; says it didn&#x27;t attempt to have these mistakes corrected.&quot; Investigations revealed that Merck had several years worth of information suggesting an elevated risk of cardiac events, and Vice President Edward Scolnick took much of the blame for the suppression of this information.

The FDA reviewers were aware of the potential for cardiovascular risk in 1999and it was argued that Merck had manipulated their EKG tests one week after the external review board provided their consultation to specifically exclude high risk factors from the trial subjects to avoid finding effect then predated the changes to their trials to almost three months earlier.

====Alzheimer&#x27;s disease====
In 2000 and 2001, Merck conducted several studies of rofecoxib aimed at determining if the drug slowed the onset of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Merck has placed great emphasis on these studies on the grounds that they are relatively large (almost 3000 patients) and compared rofecoxib to a placebo rather than to another pain reliever. These studies found an elevated death rate among rofecoxib patients, although the deaths were not generally heart-related. However, they did not find any elevated cardiovascular risk due to rofecoxib. Before 2004, Merck cited these studies as providing evidence, contrary to VIGOR, of rofecoxib&#x27;s safety.

====APPROVe study====
In 2001, Merck commenced the APPROVe (Adenomatous Polyp PRevention On Vioxx) study, a three-year trial with the primary aim of evaluating the efficacy of rofecoxib for the prophylaxis of colorectal polyps. Celecoxib had already been approved for this indication, and it was hoped to add this to the indications for rofecoxib, as well. An additional aim of the study was to further evaluate the cardiovascular safety of rofecoxib.

The APPROVe study was terminated early when the preliminary data from the study showed an increased relative risk of adverse thrombotic cardiovascular events (including heart attack and stroke), beginning after 18 months of rofecoxib therapy. In patients taking rofecoxib, versus placebo, the relative risk of these events was 1.92 (rofecoxib 1.50 events vs placebo 0.78 events per 100 patient years). The results from the first 18 months of the APPROVe study did not show an increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, overall and cardiovascular mortality rates were similar between the rofecoxib and placebo populations.

In summary, the APPROVe study suggested that long-term use of rofecoxib resulted in nearly twice the risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke compared to patients receiving a placebo.

====Other studies====
Preapproval phase III clinical trials, like the APPROVe study, showed no increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events for the first 18 months of rofecoxib usage (Merck, 2004). Others have pointed out that &quot;study 090&quot;, a preapproval trial, showed a three-fold increase in cardiovascular events compared to placebo, a seven-fold increase compared to nabumetone (another NSAID), and an eight-fold increase in heart attacks and strokes combined compared to both control groups. Although this was a relatively small study and only the last result was statistically significant, critics have charged that this early finding should have prompted Merck to quickly conduct larger studies of rofecoxib&#x27;s cardiovascular safety. Merck notes that it had already begun VIGOR at the time Study 090 was completed. Although VIGOR was primarily designed to demonstrate new uses for rofecoxib, it also collected data on adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Several very large observational studies have also found elevated risk of heart attack from rofecoxib. For example, a recent retrospective study of 113,000 elderly Canadians suggested a borderline statistically significant increased relative risk of heart attacks of 1.24 from Vioxx usage, with a relative risk of 1.73 for higher-dose Vioxx usage. (Levesque, 2005). Another study, using Kaiser Permanente data, found a 1.47 relative risk for low-dose Vioxx usage and 3.58 for high-dose Vioxx usage compared to current use of celecoxib, though the smaller number was not statistically significant, and relative risk compared to other populations was not statistically significant. (Graham, 2005).

Furthermore, a more recent meta-study of 114 randomized trials with a total of 116,000+ participants, published in JAMA, showed that Vioxx uniquely increased risk of renal (kidney) disease, and heart arrhythmia.

====Other COX-2 inhibitors====
In 2005, the FDA issued a memo concluding that along with the other approved COX-2 selective NSAIDs available at the time (i.e., celecoxib, and valdecoxib), rofecoxib was associated with an increased risk of serious adverse cardiovascular events compared to placebo. They also noted that the available data did not permit a rank ordering of these drugs with regard to cardiovascular risk.

Only Celebrex (generic name is celecoxib) is still available for purchase in the United States.

Regulatory authorities worldwide now require warnings about cardiovascular risk of COX-2 inhibitors still on the market. For example, in 2005, EU regulators required the following changes to the product information and/or packaging of all COX-2 inhibitors:

* Contraindications stating that COX-2 inhibitors must not be used in patients with established ischaemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular disease (stroke), and also in patients with peripheral arterial disease
* Reinforced warnings to healthcare professionals to exercise caution when prescribing COX-2 inhibitors to patients with risk factors for heart disease, such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia (high cholesterol levels), diabetes and smoking
* Given the association between cardiovascular risk and exposure to COX-2 inhibitors, doctors are advised to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration of treatment

====Other NSAIDs====
Since the withdrawal of Vioxx it has come to light that there may be negative cardiovascular effects with not only other COX-2 inhibitiors, but even the majority of other NSAIDs. It is only with the recent development of drugs like Vioxx that drug companies have carried out the kind of well executed trials that could establish such effects and these sort of trials have never been carried out in older &quot;trusted&quot; NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, diclofenac and others. The possible exceptions may be aspirin and naproxen due to their anti-platelet aggregation properties.

Analyses in 2011 and 2013 by McGettigan and the Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists (CNT) Collaborators, respectively, demonstrated that the risk of serious CV events was a dose dependent effect of COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs, with the possible exception of naproxen, and high therapeutic doses of nonselective NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen 2400 mg/day, diclofenac 150 mg/day) carried similar CV risk when compared to a combined group of therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses of COX-2 selective  NSAIDs (such as rofecoxib).

In 2014, Patrono and Baigent, summarizing all of the currently available data in a review article in Circulation, concluded that with the exception of GI toxicity, neither the efficacy nor the major cardiorenal complications of COX-2 selective NSAIDs appear to be influenced by their level of COX-2 selectivity. They concluded that the CV risk associated with NSAIDs was dependent on dose and duration.

This conclusion was further reinforced by the 2016 results of the celecoxib PRECISION trial, which showed no difference in CV event rates between the COX-2 selective NSAID celecoxib and the non-selective NSAIDs ibuprofen and naproxen.

==Withdrawal==
Due to the findings of its own APPROVe study, Merck publicly announced its voluntary withdrawal of the drug from the market worldwide on September 30, 2004.

In addition to its own studies, on September 23, 2004, Merck apparently received information about new research by the FDA that supported previous findings of increased risk of heart attack among rofecoxib users (Grassley, 2004). One FDA analyst estimated that, based upon his mathematical model, Vioxx may have caused between 88,000 and 139,000 heart attacks, 30 to 40 percent of which were probably fatal, in the five years the drug was on the market. Senior FDA officials were quick to note, however, that this estimate was based solely on a mathematical model, and must be interpreted with caution.

On November 5, 2004, the medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot; published a meta-analysis of the available studies on the safety of rofecoxib (Jüni &quot;et al.&quot;, 2004). The authors concluded that, owing to the known cardiovascular risk, rofecoxib should have been withdrawn several years earlier. &quot;The Lancet&quot; published an editorial which condemned both Merck and the FDA for the continued availability of rofecoxib from 2000 until the recall. Merck responded by issuing a rebuttal of the Jüni &quot;et al.&quot; meta-analysis that noted that Jüni omitted several studies that showed no increased cardiovascular risk.

===Merck-sponsored &quot;Martin Report&quot;, 2006===
In 2005, Merck spent $21 million US to retain John S. Martin Jr., a former US District Judge for the Southern District of New York, and colleagues at Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP, to investigate Vioxx study results and communications conducted by Merck. The report, which Merck called the &quot;Martin Report&quot;, was published in February 2006. The report found that Merck&#x27;s senior management acted in good faith, and that the confusion over the clinical safety of Vioxx was due to the sales team&#x27;s overzealous behavior. The report that was filed gave a timeline of the events surrounding Vioxx and stated that Merck intended to operate honestly throughout the process. Any mistakes that were made regarding the mishandling of clinical trial results and withholding of information were described as the result of oversight, not malicious behavior. The report did conclude that the Merck&#x27;s marketing team exaggerated the safety of Vioxx and replaced truthful information with sales tactics. Merck was satisfied with the findings of the report it had commissioned, and promised to consider the recommendations. The report was criticised in the press as self-serving. Merck insisted that the report was independent and Merck &quot;had no effect at all on the findings and the conclusions&quot;. Merck hoped that the report would improve public perception of Merck.

==FDA position==
In 2005, advisory panels in both the US and Canada encouraged the return of rofecoxib to the market, stating that Rofecoxib&#x27;s benefits outweighed the risks for some patients. The FDA advisory panel voted 17-15 to allow the drug to return to the market despite being found to increase heart risk. The vote in Canada was 12-1, and the Canadian panel noted that the cardiovascular risks from rofecoxib seemed to be no worse than those from ibuprofen—though the panel stated that further study was needed for all NSAIDs to fully understand their risk profiles. Notwithstanding these recommendations, Merck has not returned rofecoxib to the market.

Following the 2005 FDA Advisory Committee, the FDA issued a memo concluding that data from large long-term controlled clinical trials do not clearly demonstrate that COX-2 selective agents (including rofecoxib) have a greater risk of serious cardiovascular events than non-selective NSAIDs.

In 2015, the FDA reinforced this conclusion, stating that the available data support a dose and duration dependent class effect of an increased risk of serious adverse cardiovascular events for COX-2 selective and non-selective NSAIDs.

==Litigation==
By March 2006, there were over 10,000 cases and 190 class actions filed against Merck over adverse cardiovascular events associated with rofecoxib and the adequacy of Merck&#x27;s warnings. The first wrongful death trial, &quot;Rogers v. Merck&quot;, was scheduled in Alabama in the spring of 2005, but was postponed after Merck argued that the plaintiff had falsified evidence of rofecoxib use.

On August 19, 2005, a jury in Texas voted 10–2 to hold Merck liable for the death of Robert Ernst, a 59-year-old man who allegedly died of a rofecoxib-induced heart attack. Merck argued that the death was due to cardiac arrhythmia, which had not been shown to be associated with rofecoxib use. The jury awarded Carol Ernst, widow of Robert Ernst, $253.4 million in damages. This award was capped at no more than US$26.1 million because of punitive damages limits under Texas law. Merck appealed and the verdict was overturned in 2008.
On November 3, 2005, Merck won the second case &quot;Humeston v. Merck&quot;, a personal injury case, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The plaintiff experienced a mild myocardial infarction and claimed that rofecoxib was responsible, after having taken it for two months. Merck argued that there was no evidence that rofecoxib was the cause of Humeston&#x27;s injury and that there is no scientific evidence linking rofecoxib to cardiac events with short durations of use. The jury ruled that Merck had adequately warned doctors and patients of the drug&#x27;s risk.

The first federal trial on rofecoxib, &quot;Plunkett v. Merck&quot;, began on November 29, 2005, in Houston. The trial ended on December 12, 2005, when Judge Eldon E. Fallon of U.S. District Court declared a mistrial because of a hung jury with an eight to one majority, favoring the defense. Upon retrial in February 2006 in New Orleans, where the Vioxx multidistrict litigation (MDL) is based, a jury found Merck not liable, even though the plaintiffs had the &quot;NEJM&quot; editor testify as to his objections to the VIGOR study.

On January 30, 2006, a New Jersey state court dismissed a case brought by Edgar Lee Boyd, who blamed Vioxx for gastrointestinal bleeding that he experienced after taking the drug. The judge said that Boyd failed to prove the drug caused his stomach pain and internal bleeding.

In January 2006, &quot;Garza v. Merck&quot; began trial in Rio Grande City, Texas. The plaintiff, a 71-year-old smoker with heart disease, had a fatal heart attack three weeks after finishing a one-week sample of rofecoxib. On April 21, 2006 the jury awarded the plaintiff $7 million compensatory and $25 million punitive. The Texas Courts of Appeals in San Antonio later ruled Garza&#x27;s fatal heart attack probably resulted from pre-existing health conditions unrelated to his taking of Vioxx, thus reversing the $32 million jury award.

On April 5, 2006, a jury held Merck liable for the heart attack of 77-year-old John McDarby, and awarded McDarby $4.5 million in compensatory damages based on Merck&#x27;s failure to properly warn of Vioxx safety risks. After a hearing on April 11, 2006, the jury also awarded Mr. McDarby an additional $9 million in punitive damages. The same jury found Merck not liable for the heart attack of 60-year-old Thomas Cona, a second plaintiff in the trial, but was liable for fraud in the sale of the drug to Cona.

In March 2010, an Australian class-action lawsuit against Merck ruled that Vioxx doubled the risk of heart attacks, and that Merck had breached the Trade Practices Act by selling a drug which was unfit for sale.

By November 2007 Merck announced that it agreed on a mass tort settlement of $4.85 billion between Merck and the lawyers of 27,000 individual lawsuits with a try-every-case strategy as opposed to a class action lawsuit if &quot;85 percent of the plaintiffs sign up&quot;. After the settlement, the lawyers for the case disputed the $315 million awarded in legal fees. Ultimately, the judge determined how the fees would be awarded to the plaintiff&#x27;s attorneys. Judge Eldon E. Fallon of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana additionally ordered the plaintiff lawyers to cap their fees at 32% of the settlement amount.

The above dispute over lawyer fees has caused scholars and observers to consider tort reform throughout the country. Articles on the subject include &quot;The Vioxx Litigation: A Critical Look at Trial Tactics, the Tort System, and the Roles of Lawyers in Mass Tort Litigation&quot; and &quot;10 Years of Tort Reform in Texas Bring Fewer Suits, Lower Payouts.&quot;

In November 2011, Merck announced a civil settlement with the US Attorney&#x27;s Office for the District of Massachusetts, and individually with 43 US states and the District of Columbia, to resolve civil claims relating to Vioxx. Under the terms of the settlement, Merck agreed to pay two-thirds of a previously recorded $950 million reserve charge in exchange for release from civil liability. Litigation with seven additional states remains outstanding. Under separate criminal proceedings, Merck pleaded guilty to a federal misdemeanor charge relating to the marketing of the drug across state lines, incurring a fine of $321.6 million.

==Possible return to market==
In November 2017, Massachusetts-based Tremeau Pharmaceuticals announced its plan to return rofecoxib (TRM-201) to market as a treatment for hemophilic arthropathy (HA). Tremeau announced that the FDA had granted an orphan designation for TRM-201 (rofecoxib) for the treatment of HA, and that they had received FDA feedback on their development plan. HA is a degenerative joint disease caused by recurrent intra-articular bleeding. It is the largest cause of morbidity in patients with hemophilia and has no currently approved treatment options in the United States. Traditional NSAIDs are avoided in this population due to their effects on platelet aggregation and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, and high potency opioids are the current standard of care in treating HA.

In March 2019 Tremeau announced that they had hired as chief development officer a former Merck employee who had been a product development team leader and also was responsible for executive oversight for numerous clinical trials for the COX-2 inhibitor VIOXX (rofecoxib). Tremeau also announced an upcoming clinical trial for rofecoxib and were seeking investigators.

On February 15, 2022, California-based BriOri Biotech announced that it had been issued a patent covering topical formulations of rofecoxib.

<text>Daniello Bartoli (; 12 February 160813 January 1685) was an Italian Jesuit writer and historiographer, celebrated by the poet Giacomo Leopardi as the &quot;Dante of Italian prose&quot;

==Ferrara==

He was born in Ferrara. His father, Tiburzio was a chemist associated with the Este court of Alfonso II d&#x27;Este. When the papacy refused to recognize his illegitimate successor the court moved in 1598 under Cesare d&#x27;Este, Duke of Modena. During the Cinquecento and due to a host of writers including Ariosto and Tasso Renaissance Ferrara was the literary capital of Italian letters along with Florence, whereas the language of papal Rome was humanist Latin. His identity as a Ferrarese and a Lombard is touted in the pseudonym, &quot;Ferrante Longobardi&quot; which he used to sustain his independence from the linguistic tyranny of Florence in &quot;Il torto ed il diritto del &quot;Non si può&quot;&quot; (1655).

==Vocation and Studies==

Daniello was the youngest of three sons and barely fifteen when embraced a vocation to the Society of Jesus in 1623. Debarred by his superiors because of his manifest literary talents from the missions in the Indies he would later describe, he attained high distinction in science and letters. After a novitiate of two years at Novellara, Bartoli resumed his studies in Piacenza in 1625. In Parma (1626–29) he completed his philosophate and (1629–34) he taught grammar and rhetoric to the boys of the Jesuit collegio. Under Jesuit scientists Giovanni Battista Riccioli and Niccolo Zucchi the young Bartoli, together with his younger contemporary Francesco Maria Grimaldi was involved in noteworthy experiments and discoveries of the planetary heavens. Bartoli along with Zucchi is credited as having been one of the first to see the equatorial belts on the planet Jupiter on May 17, 1630. And in his old age he would return to the world of science. He was ordained a priest in 1634 and continued his studies in Milan and Bologna. In his thirties he was an esteemed preacher delivering the Lenten sermons at the principal Jesuits churches of Italy including Ferrara, Genoa, Florence and Rome. While in Ferrara he also published a collection of poems under the name of a nephew, as the Jesuits in Italy were not allowed to publish poetry. In his first published work he will quote from a number of these, anonymously. At 35 Bartoli pronounced his final vows as a professed Jesuit in Pistoia on July 31, 1643. In 1645 his treatise on the man of letters, L&#x27;huomo di lettere difeso ed emendato catapulted him to national celebrity and international fame as a leading contemporary writer of the High Baroque age. For the rest of the century his treatise was considered a masterpiece of erudition and eloquence. It became a staple of the Italian printing industry and was much sought after and translated. During the process of her conversion to Roman Catholicism at the hands of the Jesuits in the 1650s Christina, Queen of Sweden specifically requested a copy of this celebrated work be sent to her in Stockholm. Heading to preach in Palermo he survived a shipwreck off Capri in 1646, but lost the manuscripts of his sermons. Because of his growing fame his superiors put an end to his decade as an itinerant preacher and brought him permanently to the order&#x27;s headquarters in Rome. In 1648 his was appointed Jesuit historiographer and spent the next four decades writing his great history, as well as moral, spiritual and scientific treatises.

==Baroque Rome==
The remarkable success of Bartoli&#x27;s literary debut coincided with the triumph of the High Baroque in Rome and it serves as a testament to the formative role of the Italian Jesuits as cultural entrepreneurs meditating between the sacred and the profane elements of the age. &quot;L&#x27;huomo di lettere&quot; (1645) became a cultural &quot;vademecum&quot; for the aspirations of a new generation of humanist intellectuals. Its eloquence and erudition found a lively balance between devotion to antiquity and consciousness of the modern. In Italy it was a bestseller. During the decades of Bartoli&#x27;s life that followed, the work had editions and reprints nearly annually in Rome, Bologna, Florence, Milan and especially Venice. In the same period there were translations in French, German, English, Latin, Spanish and later Dutch. But history was his main task as a Jesuit man of letters. As such Bartoli represents the shift from the preceding Latin humanist historiography of Niccolò Orlandini and Francesco Sacchini to the illustrious Jesuit prose tradition he established in Italian when he undertook the official history of the first century of the Society of Jesus (1540). His monumental &quot;Istoria della Compagnia di Gesu&quot; (Rome, 1650–1673), in 6 folio vols. is the longest Italian classic. It begins with an authoritative, if somewhat ponderous, biography of the founder Ignatius Loyola. Particularly fascinating and exotic are his histories of Francis Xavier and the Jesuit missions in the East which describe India and the opening of the East, L&#x27;Asia (1653) in eight books. A shorter work on Akbar the Great and Rodolfo Acquaviva came out in 1653 and was added to the third edition of L&#x27;Asia in 1667. Part II of the first corner of the world he completed was Japan, Il Giappone (1660) in five books, and the Part III on China, La Cina appeared in four books (1663). To these he opened his projected Europa with the missions on the Jesuits in England, L&#x27;Inghilterra (1667) and a final work on the opening years of the order in the Italy of St. Ignatius, Diego Laynez and Francis Borgia, L&#x27;Italia (1673). With these histories he alternated treatises on language use, &quot;Del torto e del diritto del non si può&quot; and moral works like &quot;La Ricreazione del savio&quot;. In the 1660s the Lyons Jesuit Louis Janin, translator of L&#x27;huomo di lettere issued Latin translations of these histories. From 1671 to 1674 Bartoli served as Rector of the Collegio Romano in recognition of his international prestige as a writer. Indefatigible in his final years Bartoli produced 4 Jesuit biographies and three scientific treatises on pressure, sound, coagulation. His several works of spiritual reflection were brought together a folio edition, &quot;Le Morali&quot; in 1684. His final work, &quot;Pensieri sacri&quot; went to press after his death in Rome, January 13, 1685.

During the early nineteenth century, of Leopardi and of Manzoni, Bartoli became the literary paragon as a master of prose style. Outstanding among the numerous printings and anthologies of his works from that period is the standard octavo edition of his complete works beautifully printed by Giacinto Marietti, Turin, 1825-1842 in 34 volumes.

<text>Fredy Perlman (1934–1985) was an American author, publisher, and activist. His best-known work, &quot;Against His-Story, Against Leviathan!&quot;, retells the historical rise of state domination (and domination generally) through a poetic investigation of the Hobbesian metaphor of the Leviathan.

== Early life ==

Perlman was born August 20, 1934, in Brno, Czechoslovakia, to Henry and Martha Perlman. His family immigrated first to Cochabamba, Bolivia to escape the Holocaust and later to the United States. Perlman received a master&#x27;s degree from Columbia University and a PhD from University of Belgrade. He married Lorraine Nybakken in January 1958.

== Career ==

His best-known work, &quot;Against His-Story, Against Leviathan&quot; (1983) rewrites the history of humanity as a struggle of free people resisting being turned into &quot;zeks&quot; (a Soviet term for forced labour that Perlman borrowed from The Gulag Archipelago) by Leviathans (a term used by Thomas Hobbes for the sovereign nation-state). The book influenced the anarcho-primitivist author John Zerzan. Philosopher John P. Clark states that &quot;Against His-Story, Against Leviathan!&quot; describes Perlman&#x27;s critique of what he saw as &quot;the millennia-long history of the assault of the technological megamachine on humanity and the Earth.&quot; Clark also notes the book discusses &quot;anarchistic spiritual movements&quot; such as the Yellow Turban movement in ancient China and the Brethren of the Free Spirit in medieval Europe.

== Death ==

Perlman died on July 26, 1985, while undergoing heart surgery in Detroit&#x27;s Henry Ford Hospital. He was survived by his wife and a brother.

<text>&quot;&quot; (&quot;To the Barricades&quot;) was one of the most popular songs of the Spanish anarchists during the Spanish Civil War. &quot;&quot; is sung to the tune of &quot;Whirlwinds of Danger&quot; (&quot;Warszawianka&quot;), composed by Józef Pławiński. The lyrics written by Valeriano Orobón Fernández in 1936 were partly based on the original Polish lyrics by Wacław Święcicki.

&quot;The Confederation&quot; referred to in the final stanza is the anarcho-syndicalist CNT ( — &quot;National Confederation of Labor&quot;), which at the time was the largest labour union, the main anarchist organisation in Spain, and from 1936 to 1939 were a major force opposing Francisco Franco&#x27;s military coup against the Spanish Republic.

<doc id="648828" wikidata="Q408801" url="?curid=648828" title="Celecoxib">
<text>Celecoxib, sold under the brand name Celebrex among others, is a COX-2 inhibitor and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It is used to treat the pain and inflammation in osteoarthritis, acute pain in adults, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, painful menstruation, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. It may also be used to decrease the risk of colorectal adenomas in people with familial adenomatous polyposis. It is taken by mouth. Benefits are typically seen within an hour.
Common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. Serious side effects may include heart attacks, strokes, gastrointestinal perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney failure, and anaphylaxis. Use is not recommended in people at high risk for heart disease. The risks are similar to other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Use in the later part of pregnancy or during breastfeeding is not recommended.
Celecoxib was patented in 1993 and came into medical use in 1999. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 93rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Celecoxib is indicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, acute pain, musculoskeletal pain, painful menstruation, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and to reduce the number of colon and rectal polyps in people with familial adenomatous polyposis. It may be used in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis who are older than two years of age and weigh more than 10 kg (22 lb).

For postoperative pain, it is more or less equal to ibuprofen. For pain relief, it is similar to paracetamol (acetaminophen) at 3990 mg per day, which is the first line treatment for osteoarthritis.

Evidence of effects is not clear as several studies done by the manufacturer have not been released for independent analysis.

===Familial adenomatous polyposis===
It has been used to reduce colon and rectal polyps in people with familial adenomatous polyposis, but it is not known if it decreases rates of cancer, so it is not a good choice for this reason.

==Adverse effects==
* Cardiovascular events: NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk of serious (and potentially fatal) adverse cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke. Risk may be increased with duration of use or pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors or disease. Individual cardiovascular risk profiles should be evaluated before prescribing. New-onset hypertension or exacerbation of hypertension may occur (NSAIDs may impair response to thiazide or loop diuretics), and may contribute to cardiovascular events; monitor blood pressure and use with caution in patients with hypertension. Celecoxib may cause sodium and fluid retention, so its use in patients with edema or heart failure warrants caution. Long-term cardiovascular risk in children has not been evaluated. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient goals, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events; alternative therapies should be considered for patients at high risk. The increased risk is about 37%.
* Gastrointestinal events: NSAIDs may increase the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration, bleeding, and perforation (may be fatal). These events may occur at any time during therapy and without warning. Use caution with a history of GI disease (bleeding or ulcers), concurrent therapy with aspirin, anticoagulants and/or corticosteroids, smoking, use of alcohol, and the elderly or debilitated patients. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient goals, to reduce the risk of GI adverse events; alternate therapies should be considered for patients at high risk. When used concomitantly with ≤325 mg of aspirin, a substantial increase in the risk of gastrointestinal complications (e.g., ulcer) occurs; concomitant gastroprotective therapy (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) is recommended. The increased risk is about 81%.
* Hematologic effects: Anemia may occur; monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in people on long-term treatment. Celecoxib does not usually affect prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, or platelet counts; it does not inhibit platelet aggregation at approved doses.

People with a prior history of ulcer disease or GI bleeding require special precautions. Moderate to severe liver impairment or GI toxicity can occur with or without warning symptoms in people treated with NSAIDs.

In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy.

===Allergy===
Celecoxib contains a sulfonamide moiety and may cause allergic reactions in those allergic to other sulfonamide-containing drugs. This is in addition to the contraindication in people with severe allergies to other NSAIDs. However, it has a low (reportedly 4%) chance of inducing cutaneous reactions among persons who have a history of such reactions to aspirin or nonselective NSAIDs. NSAIDs may cause serious skin adverse events, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis; events may occur without warning and in patients without prior known sulfa allergy. Use should be discontinued at the first sign of rash (or any other hypersensitivity).

===Heart attack and stroke===
A 2013 meta-analysis of hundreds of clinical trials found that coxibs (the class of drugs that includes celecoxib) increase the risk of major cardiovascular problems by about 37% over placebo. In 2016, a randomized trial provided strong evidence that treatment with celecoxib is not more likely to result in poor cardiovascular outcomes than treatment with naproxen or ibuprofen. As a result, in 2018 an FDA advisory panel concluded that celecoxib poses no greater risk for causing heart attacks and strokes than the commonly-used NSAIDs ibuprofen or naproxen and recommended that the FDA consider changing its advice to physicians regarding celecoxib&#x27;s safety.

The COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (Vioxx) was removed from the market in 2004 due to its risk. Like all NSAIDs on the US market, celecoxib carries an FDA-mandated &quot;black box warning&quot; for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risk. In February 2007, the American Heart Association warned that with respect to &quot;patients with a prior history of or at high risk for cardiovascular disease... use of COX-2 inhibitors for pain relief should be limited to patients for whom there are no appropriate alternatives, and then, only in the lowest dose and for the shortest duration necessary.&quot;

In 2005, a study published in the &quot;Annals of Internal Medicine&quot; found that cardiovascular effects of COX-2 inhibitors differ, depending on the drug. Other COX-2-selective inhibitors, such as rofecoxib, have significantly higher myocardial infarction rates than celecoxib. In April 2005, after an extensive review of data, the FDA concluded it was likely &quot;that there is a &#x27;class effect&#x27; for increased CV risk for all NSAIDs&quot;. In a 2006 meta-analysis of randomized control studies, the cerebrovascular events associated with COX-2 inhibitors were examined, but no significant risks were found when compared to nonselective NSAIDs or placebos.

===Drug interactions===
Celecoxib undergoes metabolism primarily by the enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, but it also interacts with CYP2D6, inhibiting its activity without being metabolized by it. The CYP2C9 gene exhibits considerable genetic variability, with common polymorphisms, such as rs1799853 and rs1057910, linked to reduced enzyme activity and altered pharmacokinetics of celecoxib. Additionally, the influence of CYP2D6 on celecoxib metabolism is inconsistent, with its effect varying depending on the individual’s CYP2C9 genetic profile.

Caution must be exercised with concomitant use of 2C9 inhibitors, such as fluconazole, which can greatly elevate celecoxib serum levels. If used concomitantly with lithium, celecoxib increases lithium plasma levels. If used concomitantly with warfarin, celecoxib may result in an increased risk of bleeding complications. The risk of bleeding and gastric ulcers also increases further when selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are used in combination with celecoxib. The drug may increase the risk of kidney failure with angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, such as lisinopril, and diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide.

==Mechanism of action==

===Anti-inflammatory===
A highly selective reversible inhibitor of the COX-2 isoform of cyclooxygenase, celecoxib inhibits the transformation of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin precursors. Therefore, it has analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Nonselective NSAIDs (such as aspirin, naproxen, and ibuprofen) inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2. Inhibition of COX-1 (which celecoxib does not inhibit at therapeutic concentrations) inhibits the production of prostaglandins and the production of thromboxane A2, a platelet activator. COX-1 is traditionally defined as a constitutively expressed &quot;housekeeping&quot; enzyme and plays a role in the protection of the gastrointestinal mucosa, kidney hemodynamics, and platelet thrombogenesis. COX-2, on the contrary, is extensively expressed in cells involved in inflammation and is upregulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides, cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters. Celecoxib is approximately 10-20 times more selective for COX-2 inhibition over COX-1. It binds with its polar sulfonamide side chain to a hydrophilic side pocket region close to the active COX-2 binding site. In theory, this selectivity allows celecoxib and other COX-2 inhibitors to reduce inflammation (and pain) while minimizing gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions (e.g. stomach ulcers) that are common with nonselective NSAIDs.

===Anti-cancer===
For its use in reducing colon polyps, celecoxib affects genes and pathways involved in inflammation and malignant transformation in tumors, but not normal tissues.

Celecoxib binds to Cadherin-11 (which may explain the reduction in cancer progression).

==Structure-activity relationship==

The Searle research group found the two appropriately substituted aromatic rings must reside on adjacent positions about the central ring for adequate COX-2 inhibition. Various modifications can be made to the 1,5-diarylpyrazole moiety to deduce the structure-activity relationship of celecoxib. A para-sulfamoylphenyl at position 1 of the pyrazole was found to have a higher potency for COX-2 selective inhibition than a para-methoxyphenyl (see structures 1 and 2, below). In addition, a 4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl or 4-sulfamoylphenyl is known to be necessary for COX-2 inhibition. For instance, replacing either of these entities with a –SO2NHCH3 substituent diminishes COX-2 inhibitory activity as noted with a very high inhibitory concentration-50 (see structures 3 – 5). At the 3-position of the pyrazole, a trifluoromethyl or difluoromethyl provides superior selectivity and potency compared to a fluoromethyl or methyl substitution (see structures 6 – 9).

Celecoxib is compound 22; the 4-sulfamoylphenyl on the 1-pyrazol substituent is required for COX-2 inhibition and the 4-methyl on the 5-pyrazol system has low steric hindrance to maximising potency, while the 3-trifluoromethyl group provides superior selectivity and potency. To explain the selectivity of celecoxib, it is necessary to analyze the free energy of binding difference between the drug molecule and COX-1 compared to COX-2 enzymes. The structural modifications highlight the importance of binding to residue 523 in the side binding pocket of the cyclooxygenase enzyme, which is an isoleucine in COX-1 and a valine in COX-2. This mutation appears to contribute to COX-2 selectivity by creating steric hindrance between the sulfonamide oxygen and the methyl group of Ile523 that effectively destabilizes the celecoxib-COX-1 complex.

==History==
It was initially marketed by Pfizer for arthritis. Celecoxib and other COX-2 selective inhibitors, valdecoxib, parecoxib, and mavacoxib, were discovered by a team at the Searle division of Monsanto led by John Talley.

Two lawsuits arose over the discovery of celecoxib. Daniel L. Simmons of Brigham Young University (BYU) discovered the COX-2 enzyme in 1988, and in 1991, BYU entered into a collaboration with Monsanto to develop drugs to inhibit it. Monsanto&#x27;s pharmaceutical division was later purchased by Pfizer, and in 2006, BYU sued Pfizer for breach of contract, claiming Pfizer did not properly pay contractual royalties back to BYU. A settlement was reached in April 2012, in which Pfizer agreed to pay $450 million. Other important discoveries in COX-2 were made at University of Rochester, which patented the discoveries. When the patent was issued, the university sued Searle (later Pfizer) in a case called, &quot;University of Rochester v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co.&quot;, 358 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The court ruled in favor of Searle in 2004, holding in essence that the university had claimed a method requiring, yet provided no written description of, a compound that could inhibit COX-2, and therefore the patent was invalid.

According to the National Academy of Sciences, Philip Needleman, who was vice president of Monsanto in 1989 and president of Searle in 1993 oversaw research into COX-2 that led to the development of the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib (Celebrex). He became senior executive vice president and chief scientist of Pharmacia from 2000 to 2003. Celecoxib was discovered and developed by G. D. Searle &amp; Company and was approved by the FDA on 31 December 1998. It was co-promoted by Monsanto Company (parent company of Searle) and Pfizer under the brand name Celebrex. Monsanto merged with Pharmacia, from which the Medical Research Division was acquired by Pfizer, giving Pfizer ownership of Celebrex. The drug was at the core of a major patent dispute that was resolved in Searle&#x27;s favor (later Pfizer) in 2004. In &quot;University of Rochester v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co.&quot;, 358 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the University of Rochester claimed that United States Pat. No. 6,048,850 (which claimed a method of inhibiting COX-2 in humans using a compound, without actually disclosing what that compound might be) covered drugs such as celecoxib. The court ruled in favor of Searle, holding in essence that the university had claimed a method requiring, yet provided no written description of, a compound that could inhibit COX-2, and therefore the patent was invalid.

After the withdrawal of rofecoxib from the market in September 2004, celecoxib enjoyed a robust increase in sales. However, the results of the APC trial in December of that year raised concerns that Celebrex might carry risks similar to those of rofecoxib, and Pfizer announced a moratorium on direct-to-consumer advertising of Celebrex soon afterward. Sales reached $2 billion in 2006. Before its availability in generic form, it was one of Pfizer&#x27;s &quot;best-selling drugs, amounting to more than $2.5 billion in sales [by 2012], and was prescribed to 2.4 million&quot; people in 2011. By 2012, 33 million Americans had taken celecoxib.

Pfizer resumed advertising Celebrex in magazines in 2006, and resumed television advertising in April 2007 with an unorthodox, -minute advertisement which extensively discussed the adverse effects of Celebrex in comparison with other anti-inflammatory drugs. The ad drew criticism from the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, which called the ad&#x27;s comparisons misleading. Pfizer responded to Public Citizen&#x27;s concerns with assurances that they are truthfully advertising the risk and benefits of Celebrex as set forth by the FDA.

==Society and culture==

===Fabricated efficacy studies===
Pfizer and its partner, Pharmacia presented findings from their study that Celebrex was &quot;better in protecting the stomach from serious complications than other drugs.&quot; This became Celebrex&#x27;s main selling point. However, following federal investigations it was revealed that Pfizer and Pharmacia &quot;only presented the results from the first six months of a year-long study rather than the whole thing.&quot; These partial results were then published in The Journal of the American Medical Association. In 2001, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released the full results of the Pfizer and Pharmacia study which showed that they had withheld crucial data. By 2012, a federal judge unsealed &quot;thousands of pages of internal documents and depositions&quot; in a &quot;long-running securities fraud case against Pfizer.&quot;

In March 2009, Scott S. Reuben, former chief of acute pain at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Massachusetts, revealed that the data for 21 studies he had authored for the efficacy of the drug (along with others such as Vioxx) had been fabricated. The analgesic effects of the drugs had been exaggerated. Reuben was also a former paid spokesperson for Pfizer. Although from 2002 to 2007 Pfizer underwrote much of Dr. Reuben&#x27;s research and &quot;many of his trials found that Celebrex and Lyrica, Pfizer drugs, were effective against postoperative pain,&quot; Pfizer was not aware of the fraudulent data. None of the retracted studies were submitted to either the US Food and Drug Administration or the European Union&#x27;s regulatory agencies before the drug&#x27;s approval. Although Pfizer issued a public statement declaring, &quot;It is very disappointing to learn about Dr. Scott Reuben&#x27;s alleged actions. When we decided to support Dr. Reuben&#x27;s research, he worked for a credible academic medical center and appeared to be a reputable investigator&quot;, the documents unsealed in 2012, revealed that by February 2000, Pharmacia employees had devised a strategy to present the findings.

=== Brand names ===
Pfizer markets celecoxib under the brand name Celebrex, and it is available as oral capsules containing 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg of celecoxib.

It is legally available in many jurisdictions as a generic under several brand names. In the US, celecoxib was covered by three patents, two of which expired on 30 May 2014, and one of which (US RE44048) was due to expire 2 December 2015. On 13 March 2014, that patent was found to be invalid for double patenting. Upon the patent expiry on 30 May 2014, the FDA approved the first versions of generic celecoxib.

In the US, Celebrex is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer.

==Research==

===Psychiatry===
On the theory that inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of major mental disorders, celecoxib has been trialed for a number of psychiatric disorders, including major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.

====Bipolar disorder====
A meta-analysis considering trials of celecoxib as an adjunctive treatment in bipolar disorder was inconclusive citing low evidence quality.

===Familial adenomatous polyposis===
It has been used to reduce colon and rectal polyps in people with familial adenomatous polyposis, but it is not known if it decreases rates of cancer, so it is not a good choice for this reason.

===Cancer prevention===
The use of celecoxib to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer has been investigated, but neither celecoxib nor any other drug is indicated for this use. Small-scale clinical trials in very high-risk people (belonging to FAP families) showed celecoxib can prevent polyp growth. Hence, large-scale randomized clinical trials were undertaken. Results show a 33 to 45% polyp recurrence reduction in people treated with celecoxib each day. However, serious cardiovascular events were significantly more frequent in the celecoxib-treated groups. Aspirin shows a similar (and possibly larger) protective effect, has demonstrated cardioprotective effects and is significantly cheaper, but no head-to-head clinical trials have compared the two drugs.

===Cancer treatment===
Different from cancer prevention, cancer treatment is focused on the therapy of tumors that have already formed and have established themselves inside the patient. Many studies are going on to determine whether celecoxib might be useful for this latter condition. However, during molecular studies in the laboratory, it became apparent that celecoxib could interact with other intracellular components besides its most famous target, COX-2. The discovery of these additional targets has generated much controversy, and the initial assumption that celecoxib reduces tumor growth primarily by the inhibition of COX-2 became contentious.

Certainly, the inhibition of COX-2 is paramount for the anti-inflammatory and analgesic function of celecoxib. However, whether inhibition of COX-2 also plays a dominant role in this drug&#x27;s anticancer effects is unclear. For example, a recent study with malignant tumor cells showed celecoxib could inhibit the growth of these cells &quot;in vitro&quot;, but COX-2 played no role in this outcome; even more strikingly, the anticancer effects of celecoxib were also obtained with the use of cancer cell types that do not even contain COX-2. Karen Seibert and colleagues have published research showing antiangiogenic and antitumor activity of celecoxib in animal models.

Additional support for the idea that other targets besides COX-2 are important for celecoxib&#x27;s anticancer effects has come from studies with chemically modified versions of celecoxib. Several dozen analogs of celecoxib were generated with small alterations in their chemical structures. Some of these analogs retained COX-2 inhibitory activity, whereas many others did not. However, when the ability of all these compounds to kill tumor cells in cell culture was investigated, the antitumor potency did not at all depend on whether or not the respective compound could inhibit COX-2, showing the inhibition of COX-2 was not required for the anticancer effects. One of these compounds, 2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib, which entirely lacks the ability to inhibit COX-2, actually displayed stronger anticancer activity than celecoxib.

<text>The Cabinet counties are ten counties in the southern part of the U.S. state of Michigan named after President Andrew Jackson and people who served in his Cabinet. The Michigan Territorial legislature created twelve counties on October 29, 1829, naming eight of them after members of the recently elected Jackson&#x27;s cabinet. Cass County was also created in 1829 and named for Lewis Cass, the Territorial Governor at the time. Cass later served in Jackson&#x27;s Cabinet, making a case for it to be included as a cabinet county. Livingston County was created in 1833 and named for Edward Livingston, Jackson&#x27;s Secretary of State at the time.

The generally accepted reason for the naming of these counties after Jackson Administration members is that the Michigan Territory was trying to gain support of these officials in its border dispute with Ohio over the Toledo Strip.

In one of his last acts in office, Jackson signed the 1837 bill making Michigan the 26th state.

<doc id="648835" wikidata="Q720027" url="?curid=648835" title="Bill Belichick">
<text>William Stephen Belichick ( ; born April 16, 1952) is an American football coach who is the head football coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Widely regarded as one of the greatest head coaches of all time, he holds numerous coaching records, including the record of most Super Bowl wins (six) as a head coach, all with the New England Patriots, along with two more during his time as the defensive coordinator of the New York Giants, for a record eight combined total Super Bowl victories as coach and coordinator. A renowned American football historian, Belichick is often referred to as a &quot;student of the game&quot; with a deep knowledge of the intricacies of each player position. During his tenure with the Patriots, Belichick was a central figure as the head coach and &quot;de facto&quot; general manager during the franchise&#x27;s dynasty from 2001 to 2019.

Belichick is a descendant of the Bill Parcells coaching tree. He began his coaching career in 1975 as an assistant for the Baltimore Colts and became the defensive coordinator for New York Giants head coach Bill Parcells by 1985. Parcells and Belichick won two Super Bowls together before Belichick left to become the head coach of the Cleveland Browns in 1991. He remained in Cleveland for five seasons but was fired following the team&#x27;s 1995 season. Belichick rejoined Parcells, first in New England where the team lost Super Bowl XXXI, and later with the New York Jets. After being named head coach of the Jets, Belichick resigned after only one day on the job to accept the head coaching job for the Patriots on January 27, 2000. In 24 seasons under Belichick, the Patriots won 17 AFC East division titles, made 13 appearances in the AFC Championship Game, and appeared in nine Super Bowls, with a record six wins. Overall, Belichick has won eight Super Bowl titles (the most of any individual in NFL history) and finished as runner-up four times from his combined time as an assistant and head coach.

At the time Belichick left the Patriots, he was the NFL&#x27;s longest-tenured active head coach. Belichick has the most playoff coaching wins all-time with 31 and ranks third in regular season coaching wins in the NFL with 302. He is also in second place for combined regular season and postseason wins, and also second place for most regular season coaching wins with one franchise. Belichick is one of only three head coaches who have won six NFL titles. He was named the AP NFL Coach of the Year for the 2003, 2007, and 2010 seasons. Belichick has also been selected to the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team, NFL 2010s All-Decade Team, as well as the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team.

==Early life and education==
Belichick was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 16, 1952, the son of Jeannette (née Munn) and Steve Belichick.

Belichick was named after College Football Hall of Fame coach Bill Edwards, who was his godfather. He is of Croatian ancestry; his paternal grandparents, Marija Barković and Ivan Biličić, emigrated from Draganić in 1897 and settled in Monessen, Pennsylvania, having changed their names to Mary and John Belichick at the suggestion of immigration officers.

Belichick was raised in Annapolis, Maryland, where his father was an assistant football coach at the United States Naval Academy. Belichick has said his father is one of his most important football mentors, and Belichick often studied football with him. Bill reportedly learned to break down game films at a young age by watching his father and the Navy staff do their jobs. Belichick graduated from Annapolis High School in 1970, where he was a classmate of Sally Brice-O&#x27;Hara, who would later become the Vice Commandant of the Coast Guard. While there, Belichick played football and lacrosse, with the latter being his favorite sport. Belichick enrolled at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, for a postgraduate year, with the intention of improving his grades and test scores to be admitted into a quality college. The school honored Belichick 40 years later by inducting him into its Athletics Hall of Honor in 2011.

Belichick attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where he played center and tight end. In addition to being a member of the football team, Belichick played lacrosse and squash, serving as the captain of the lacrosse team during his senior season. A member of Chi Psi fraternity, Belichick earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics in 1975. Eventually, he was part of the inaugural induction class into the university&#x27;s Athletics Hall of Fame in spring 2008.

==Coaching career==

===Early coaching positions===
After graduating, Belichick took a $25-per-week job as an assistant to Baltimore Colts head coach Ted Marchibroda in 1975. In 1976, Belichick joined the Detroit Lions as their assistant special teams coach before adding tight ends and wide receivers to his coaching duties in 1977. Belichick was dismissed along with head coach Tommy Hudspeth and the rest of the coaching staff on January 9, 1978. He spent the 1978 season with the Denver Broncos as their assistant special teams coach and defensive assistant while also serving as director of films.

===New York Giants (1979–1990)===
In 1979, Belichick began a 12-year stint with the New York Giants alongside head coach Ray Perkins as a defensive assistant and special teams coach. Belichick added linebackers coaching to his duties in 1980 and was named defensive coordinator in 1985 under head coach Bill Parcells, who had replaced Perkins in 1983. The Giants won Super Bowl XXI and Super Bowl XXV following the 1986 and 1990 seasons. Belichick&#x27;s defensive game plan from the New York Giants&#x27; 20–19 upset of the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV has been placed in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

===Cleveland Browns (1991–1995)===
From 1991 until 1995, Belichick was the head coach of the Cleveland Browns. During his tenure in Cleveland, Belichick compiled a 36–44 record, leading the team to the playoffs in 1994, his only winning year with the team. Coincidentally, Belichick&#x27;s lone playoff victory during his Browns tenure was achieved against the New England Patriots, who were coached by former Giants head coach Bill Parcells, in the Wild Card Round during that postseason. In Belichick&#x27;s final season in Cleveland, the Browns finished 5–11 despite starting 3–1. One of his most controversial moves was cutting quarterback Bernie Kosar midway through the 1993 season. Kosar was signed by the Dallas Cowboys two days later and won a Super Bowl with the Cowboys in Super Bowl XXVIII as a backup. In November 1995, in the middle of the ongoing football season, Browns owner Art Modell had announced he would move his franchise to Baltimore after the season. After first being given assurances that he would coach the new team that would later become the Baltimore Ravens, Belichick was instead fired on February 14, 1996, a week after the shift was officially announced.

In the 2013 episode of &quot;A Football Life&quot; on the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, many sports journalists who had covered the Browns at the time had said that in retrospective, Belichick had laid the groundwork for the Ravens success in the ensuing decades including their win in Super Bowl XXXV (with Cleveland holdovers Matt Stover and Rob Burnett still with the team at that point), setting up the infrastructure by giving recently retired tight end Ozzie Newsome his first front-office job and had planned on drafting Ray Lewis in the 1996 NFL Draft if Belichick and the team stayed in Cleveland. (Indeed, the newly-christened Ravens did draft Lewis, who went on to a 17-year Hall of Fame career with the team.) Those who had covered the Browns went on to state that if the original Browns had stayed in Cleveland, Belichick would have seen his work through. For his part, Belichick stated that he was able to learn from some mistakes he had made with the Browns while largely sticking to his blueprint from Cleveland when resurrecting the Patriots, such as factoring in off-the-field issues that can affect performance. Among those interviewed, the general consensus was that Belichick&#x27;s failure in Cleveland had more to do with Modell&#x27;s financial struggles (even paying a young Scott Pioli only $14,000/year--equivalent to $32,447 in 2024--as a scout) that eventually led the NFL to force the sale of the Ravens to Steve Bisciotti than Belichick&#x27;s own doing.

===New England Patriots (1996)===
After his dismissal by the Cleveland Browns, Belichick served under Parcells again as assistant head coach and defensive backs coach with the New England Patriots for the 1996 season. The Patriots finished with an 11–5 record and won the AFC Championship over the Jacksonville Jaguars, but they lost to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI amid rumors of Parcells&#x27;s impending defection.

===New York Jets (1997–1999)===
Belichick had two stints as the head coach of the New York Jets without ever coaching a game.

In February 1997, Belichick, who had been an assistant coach under Bill Parcells with the New York Giants and New England Patriots, was named the Jets interim head coach while the Jets and Patriots continued to negotiate compensation to release Parcells from his contract with the Patriots and allow Parcells to coach the Jets. Six days later, the Patriots and Jets reached an agreement that allowed Parcells to coach the Jets, and Belichick became the team&#x27;s assistant head coach and defensive coordinator.

When Parcells stepped down as head coach after the 1999 season, he had already arranged with team management to have Belichick succeed him. However, Belichick was the Jets&#x27; head coach for only one day. On January 4, 2000, when Belichick was introduced as head coach to the media—the day after his hiring was publicized—he turned it into a surprise resignation announcement. Before taking the podium, Belichick scrawled a resignation note on a napkin that read, in its entirety, &quot;I resign as HC of the NYJ.&quot; He then delivered a half-hour speech explaining his resignation to the assembled press corps.

Soon after this bizarre turn of events, Belichick was introduced as the Patriots&#x27; 12th full-time head coach, succeeding the recently fired Pete Carroll. The Patriots had inquired to the Jets about permission to interview him for their vacant spot at head coach just prior to Parcells stepping down. Parcells and the Jets claimed that Belichick was still under contract to the Jets, and demanded compensation from the Patriots. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue agreed, and the Patriots gave the Jets a first-round draft pick in 2000 in exchange for the right to hire Belichick.

===Return to New England (2000–2023)===
Soon after hiring Belichick, owner Robert Kraft gave him near-complete control over the team&#x27;s football operations, making him the &quot;de facto&quot; general manager as well. Until 2009, Belichick split many of the duties normally held by a general manager on other clubs with player personnel director Scott Pioli, though Belichick had the final say on football matters. Pioli left for the Kansas City Chiefs after the 2008 season.

The Patriots went 5–11 in the 2000 regular season and missed the playoffs.

==== First three Super Bowl wins: 2001–2004====

In 2001, the Patriots went 11–5 in the regular season, and in the playoffs defeated the Oakland Raiders (in the &quot;Tuck Rule Game&quot;) and Pittsburgh Steelers on the way to the Super Bowl. In Super Bowl XXXVI, Belichick&#x27;s defense held the St. Louis Rams&#x27; offense, which had averaged 31 points during the season, to 17 points, and the Patriots won on a last-second field goal by Adam Vinatieri. The win was the first Super Bowl championship in Patriots history.

The following season (2002)—the first in Gillette Stadium—the Patriots went 9–7 and missed the playoffs. New England finished with the same record as the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins, but the Jets won the AFC East title as a result of the third tiebreaker (record among common opponents).

The Patriots&#x27; 2003 season started with a 31–0 loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 1, a few days after they released team defensive captain Lawyer Milloy. However, they dominated through the remainder of the season to finish 14–2, setting a new franchise record for wins in a season. In the final week of the regular season, the Patriots avenged their loss to the Bills by the same 31–0 score. They defeated the Tennessee Titans in the divisional round of the playoffs. Playing against the Indianapolis Colts and Co-MVP Peyton Manning in the AFC Championship Game (Steve McNair of the Titans was also Co-MVP), the Patriots recorded four interceptions, and advanced to Super Bowl XXXVIII, where they defeated the Carolina Panthers 32–29 on a late Adam Vinatieri field goal. Belichick was awarded the NFL Coach of the Year Award.

In 2004, the Patriots once again finished with a 14–2 record, and they defeated the Indianapolis Colts in the divisional round of the playoffs. They opened the season at 6–0, which combined with the 15 straight wins to end the previous season, gave New England 21 consecutive victories to break the record for most wins in a row formerly held by the Miami Dolphins with 18 straight victories in the 1972 and 1973 seasons. They defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game. In Super Bowl XXXIX, the Patriots beat the Philadelphia Eagles and became only the second team to win three Super Bowls in four years. Belichick is the only coach to accomplish the feat as the Dallas Cowboys had two head coaches in the stretch they won three of four from 1992 to 1995.

==== Perfect regular season and Brady&#x27;s injury: 2005–2009 ====

With a new defensive coordinator in Eric Mangini and no named offensive coordinator, the Patriots went 10–6 in the 2005 season and defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wild Card Round before losing to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round. Earlier, with a season-opening win over the Oakland Raiders, Belichick notched his 54th win with the Patriots, passing Mike Holovak as the winningest coach in Patriots history.

The Patriots finished with a 12–4 record in the 2006 season and defeated the New York Jets by a score of 37–16 in the Wild Card Round. They then beat the San Diego Chargers the next week in the Divisional Round, before losing to the eventual Super Bowl XLI champion Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship by a score of 38–34. The Patriots led 21–3 midway through the second quarter, but the Colts mounted one of the great comebacks in playoff history.

In 2007, Belichick led the Patriots to the first perfect regular season since the introduction of the 16-game regular season schedule in 1978, only the fourth team to do so in National Football League history after the 1934 and 1942 Chicago Bears and 1972 Miami Dolphins. In the Divisional Round of the playoffs, they defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars by a score of 31–20. In the AFC Championship, the Patriots defeated the San Diego Chargers by a score of 21–12. The Patriots were upset in Super Bowl XLII 17–14 by the New York Giants, his former team, due to the defense allowing a famous play to David Tyree near the end of regulation. The Patriots&#x27; failure to attain a &quot;perfect season&quot; (undefeated and untied, including playoffs) preserved the Miami Dolphins as the sole team to do so, having finished their 1972 regular season at 14–0 and having won three games in the playoffs. Only two other teams in professional football have recorded a perfect season—the 1948 Cleveland Browns (14–0) of the then All-America Football Conference and the 1948 Calgary Stampeders (12–0) of the Canadian Football League. No team in the former American Football League ever had a perfect season.

During the Patriots&#x27; 2008 season-opener against the Kansas City Chiefs, quarterback Tom Brady sustained a season-ending injury in the first quarter. Backup quarterback Matt Cassel was named the starter for the remainder of the season. However, with a win in Week 2, the Patriots broke their own record for regular season wins in a row with 21 (2006–08). After losing over 12 players to the injured reserve list, including Rodney Harrison, Adalius Thomas, and Laurence Maroney, the Patriots still managed their league-leading eighth consecutive season with a winning record, going 11–5. However, the Patriots, who finished second in the AFC East, missed the playoffs for the first time since 2002, losing on tiebreakers to the Miami Dolphins (who won the division on the fourth tiebreaker, better conference record) and the Baltimore Ravens (who beat out the Patriots for the last playoff spot due to a better conference record). The 1985 Denver Broncos are the only other 11-win team to miss the playoffs in a 16-game season.

In 2009, with a fully healthy Tom Brady back as the starting quarterback, Belichick was able to guide the Patriots to yet another AFC East division title with a 10–6 record. However, the Patriots lost to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round.

====Spygate====

In an incident dubbed &quot;Spygate&quot;, on September 9, 2007, NFL security caught a Patriots video assistant taping the New York Jets&#x27; defensive signals from the sidelines, which is not an approved location. The NFL rules state: &quot;No video recording devices of any kind are permitted to be in use in the coaches&#x27; booth, on the field, or in the locker room during the game.&quot; Jets coach Eric Mangini, a former Patriots assistant, tipped off league officials that the Patriots might have been filming their signals. After the game, the Jets formally complained to the league.

On September 13, the NFL fined Belichick $500,000—the largest fine ever imposed on a coach in the league&#x27;s 87-year history, and fined the Patriots $250,000. Additionally, the Patriots forfeited their first-round draft pick in the 2008 NFL draft. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, a former employee of the Jets, said that he fined the Patriots as a team because Belichick exercises so much control over the Patriots&#x27; on-field operations that &quot;his actions and decisions are properly attributed to the club.&quot; Goodell considered suspending Belichick but decided that taking away draft picks would be more severe in the long run. Gary Myers, a columnist for New York&#x27;s &quot;Daily News&quot; columnist, stated Belichick should have been suspended by Goodell for the Patriots&#x27; next game against the Jets.

Belichick later issued the following statement:

The sanctions against Belichick were the harshest imposed on a head coach in league history until the New Orleans Saints&#x27; Sean Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 season for covering up a scheme in which bounties were paid for deliberately knocking opponents out of games.

Following the incident and its fallout, Belichick led the Patriots to a perfect 16–0 regular season record, and was awarded the 2007 NFL Coach of the Year Award, as voted on by the Associated Press.

==== Making five Super Bowls and winning three, Gronkowski, and &quot;We&#x27;re on to Cincinnati&quot;: 2010–2019 ====
In the 2010 season, Belichick and the Patriots finished with a 14–2 record for the top seed in the AFC. However, their postseason ended quickly with a 28–21 loss to the New York Jets in the divisional round.

In the 2011 season, the Patriots topped the AFC with a 13–3 record. Following a victory over the Denver Broncos in the divisional round of the playoffs, the Patriots won the AFC Championship game, beating the Baltimore Ravens 23–20 when the Ravens failed to score a touchdown and Baltimore&#x27;s kicker, Billy Cundiff, missed a routine 32-yard field goal attempt to tie the game and send it into overtime. This sent New England to their fifth Super Bowl under Belichick. In Super Bowl XLVI, the Patriots lost in the Super Bowl XLII rematch to the New York Giants by a score of 21–17.

On September 26, 2012, following a 31–30 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Belichick was fined $50,000 for grabbing a replacement official&#x27;s arm while asking for more specific clarity on a ruling after Baltimore had narrowly converted a last-second field goal attempt to secure the win. The Patriots finished the 2012 regular season with a 12–4 record. In the divisional round of the playoffs, they defeated the Houston Texans by a score of 41–28 and made it to the AFC Championship Game, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl XLVII champion Baltimore Ravens by a score of 28–13, ending their season.

The Patriots began the 2013 season with much upheaval on the offensive side of the ball with the injury of Rob Gronkowski, the arrest and subsequent release of Aaron Hernandez, the departures of Wes Welker to the Denver Broncos and Danny Woodhead to the San Diego Chargers in free agency, and the release of Brandon Lloyd. To replace them, the Patriots signed Danny Amendola in free agency, drafted rookies Aaron Dobson and Josh Boyce, and signed undrafted rookie free agent Kenbrell Thompkins. The team finished the season with a 12–4 record, winning the AFC East and securing a playoff berth and a first-round bye, seeding second in the AFC standings. In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 43–22. They lost to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game by a score of 26–16.

In the 2014 season, Belichick&#x27;s Patriots started 2–2. At a mid-week press conference following a 41–14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Belichick famously uttered, &quot;We&#x27;re on to Cincinnati&quot; (referring to the Patriots&#x27; next opponent), several times in response to follow-up questions and criticisms of his team, Brady in particular. Ultimately, they recorded a 12–4 record for the third straight season. In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 35–31. During the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 45–7. They reached Super Bowl XLIX, where they defeated the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 28–24. With his fourth championship as head coach, Belichick tied Chuck Noll for most Super Bowl wins by a head coach.

In the 2015 season, the Patriots recorded a 12–4 record for the fourth straight season. They defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round by a score of 27–20. During the AFC Championship Game, the Patriots narrowly lost to the eventual Super Bowl 50 champion Denver Broncos by a score of 20–18.

In the 2016 season, the Patriots recorded a 14–2 record, which earned them the #1 seed for the AFC playoffs. In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Houston Texans by a score of 34–16. During the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers by a score of 36–17. They reached Super Bowl LI, where they defeated the Atlanta Falcons in a comeback victory by a score of 34–28 in overtime. The Patriots were down 28–3 at one point in the third quarter. With the victory, Belichick won his record fifth Super Bowl title as a head coach.

In the 2017 season, the Patriots went 13–3, setting an NFL record eighth consecutive 12-or-more-win seasons, capturing their ninth consecutive AFC East title and their 15th of the last 17 seasons. They defeated the Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round by a score of 35–14 and the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game by a score of 24–20, claiming their second consecutive AFC title, while also extending their record of consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances with seven. Super Bowl LII was Belichick&#x27;s eighth title game as head coach and his eleventh overall in any capacity, which was also the Patriots&#x27; tenth appearance, all extending NFL records. &quot;The Ringer&quot; wrote that Belichick&#x27;s &quot;team is different from many of New England&#x27;s famous teams from the previous decade: The first iteration of the Patriots dynasty relied on defense. This year, they are 29th in yards allowed (though fifth in points allowed) and instead have perfected the art of situational football.&quot; The latter Patriots teams were noted for mounting late comebacks in playoff games. However, the Patriots fell to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII, 41–33, as Eagles quarterback Nick Foles repeated his dominant NFC Championship Game performance and led Philadelphia to victory in a high-scoring game. The Patriots were down early, as they had been in most of their Super Bowl wins. However, they could not make a comeback this time, although they came very close. Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham strip-sacked Tom Brady to get the ball back with about two minutes to go in the fourth quarter. The Patriots did get the ball again before the end of the game, but they ran out of time to score.

In the 2018 season, the Patriots went 11–5, failing to win 12 or more games for the first time since 2009. Despite this, they still captured their 10th consecutive AFC East title and their 16th of the last 18 years. They defeated the Los Angeles Chargers in the Divisional Round by a score of 41–28 and the Kansas City Chiefs during the AFC Championship Game 37–31 in a tough overtime game in Kansas City to advance to their third straight Super Bowl. In Super Bowl LIII, the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13–3 to give Belichick his sixth Super Bowl championship as a head coach and his eighth overall to have the most Super Bowl rings in NFL history. His six championships matched both George Halas and Curly Lambeau for most championships as a head coach. The Patriots&#x27; defense held the high-scoring Rams offense to only 260 total yards.

On May 13, 2019, Belichick announced that he would assume another role as the Patriots&#x27; defensive coordinator starting the 2019 season. On October 27, 2019, with the Patriots&#x27; win over the Cleveland Browns, Belichick obtained his 300th win, regular and postseason combined, as a head coach. The Patriots finished the 2019 regular season with a 12–4 record, winning their 11th consecutive AFC East title. However, the Patriots were defeated in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs by the Tennessee Titans, led by former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel, by a score of 20–13.

====Brady&#x27;s departure, Cam Newton, Mac Jones, and final years in New England: 2020–2023 ====
Following the departure of Tom Brady to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Belichick and the Patriots were faced with an uncertain quarterback situation for the first time in nearly two decades. During the offseason, the Patriots signed former Carolina Panthers starter Cam Newton for the 2020 NFL season. The off-season routines and schedules, as well as the normal processes of regular season were severely disrupted by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the unanticipated difficulties and challenges of the pandemic, the Patriots were in the hunt for a playoff spot until late in the season, ultimately finishing 7–9. The 2020 season was Belichick&#x27;s first losing season since his first year in New England.

In the 2021 NFL draft, the Patriots selected quarterback Mac Jones with the 15th overall pick. After Jones and Newton competed for the starting job during the preseason, Belichick made the decision to release Newton and name Jones the starter for the upcoming season. During Week 4, Brady&#x27;s Tampa Bay Buccaneers visited the Patriots in his first trip to Gillette Stadium since signing with the Buccaneers. A missed 56-yard field goal by Patriots kicker Nick Folk allowed Tampa Bay to narrowly escape with a 19–17 victory. Immediately after the game, Brady and Belichick shared a quick embrace on the field before Brady greeted his former teammates and other members of the Patriots organization. Though fans criticized Belichick for his lack of warmth displayed towards his former quarterback, the two privately spoke at length in the Buccaneers locker room following the match. Belichick helped lead the Patriots to a 10–7 record in 2021. The team fell to the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round by a score of 47–17.

In the 2022 season, despite starting quarterback Mac Jones being injured in Week 3 and subsequently missing three more weeks, the Patriots remained in the hunt for a playoff spot until the last week, finishing with a record of 8–9.

During Week 4 of the 2023 season, the Patriots lost to the Dallas Cowboys by a score of 38–3. In doing so, Belichick suffered the worst loss of his coaching career (35 points). The following week, the Patriots lost to the Saints by a score of 34–0, giving Belichick his worst home loss of his career. Two weeks later, New England upset the Buffalo Bills 29–25 to earn Belichick his 300th career regular season win as an NFL head coach. After a Week 10 10–6 loss to the Indianapolis Colts in Germany and subsequent bye week, Belichick named Bailey Zappe the team&#x27;s starting quarterback. In Belichick&#x27;s final game with New England, the Patriots lost to the New York Jets 17–3, snapping the team&#x27;s 15-game winning streak over the Jets. The Patriots finished the season with a 4–13 record, the team&#x27;s worst in Belichick&#x27;s 24 seasons as head coach.

On January 11, 2024, Belichick and the Patriots mutually agreed to part ways. On January 15, Belichick was interviewed by the Atlanta Falcons for their head coaching position, but ultimately did not get the job as the Falcons hired Raheem Morris instead.

====Overall record in New England====
Under Belichick, the Patriots had a regular-season record of 266–121–0 over 24 seasons. Belichick is the most successful coach in Patriots history; his 266 wins with the franchise are more than quadruple those of runner-up Mike Holovak. Belichick also compiled a 30–12 record in the playoffs with New England, including a 6–3 record in Super Bowls. He led the Patriots to 17 divisional titles, including five consecutive titles from 2003 to 2007 and eleven consecutive titles from 2009 to 2019. This streak of 11 consecutive playoff appearances is the most in NFL history for any team.

=== North Carolina Tar Heels (2025–present) ===
On December 11, 2024, Belichick was named the 35th head football coach of the North Carolina Tar Heels football team. This would be Belichick&#x27;s first time coaching at the collegiate level. He will reportedly earn $10 million annually, with the first three years guaranteed, and $3.5 million in annual incentives.

==Media career==
While still serving as head coach for the Patriots in 2019, Belichick appeared as one of three main analysts, alongside host Rich Eisen and Cris Collinsworth, for the &quot;NFL 100 All-Time Team&quot; series on NFL Network, serving as a voter, in addition to providing his analysis of each member&#x27;s significance and breaking down tape of highlight plays. Belichick was chosen in these roles due to his exceptional knowledge of American football, to the extent that he and fellow former head coach John Madden were specifically assigned to look over film of the earliest players selected to the team. Belichick was awarded a Sports Emmy in 2021 for his contributions to the series.

After mutually parting ways with the Patriots in 2024, Belichick, while still declaring himself an active head coach, officially agreed to appear every Monday afternoon during the 2024 NFL season with ESPN&#x27;s &quot;The Pat McAfee Show&quot;, first appearing as an analyst on the show during its &quot;5th Annual Draft Spectacular&quot;, covering the 2024 NFL draft, following a guest appearance weeks prior.

Peyton Manning revealed during the Netflix special &quot;The Roast of Tom Brady&quot; that Belichick would join another ESPN program, joining the Manning brothers (Peyton and Eli) in the &quot;Manningcast&quot;, an alternate live television broadcast of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. A week afterward, Manning stated during an appearance on &quot;The Pat McAfee Show&quot; that Belichick would appear on every &quot;Manningcast&quot; broadcast during the 2024 season.

During the offseason, Belichick visits other football programs to learn from their experiences. For example, he has studied the Navy run offense, sought Bill Walsh (in past years) to understand more about the San Francisco 49ers as an organization and the West Coast offense as a system, and spent time with Jimmy Johnson to learn about drafting and contract negotiations. Belichick also learned about defensive backs from Bill Cowher and wanted to hire Cowher as an assistant, though Cowher opted to stay loyal to Marty Schottenheimer.

The track record of Belichick&#x27;s coaching tree has been characterized as poor. Former assistant coaches under Belichick had a combined 208–296–1 () record as head coaches of their own teams through November 28, 2020, and a number of them ended their brief tenures as head coaches by being fired midseason. As of the end of the 2020 season, the only members of this coaching tree to have career NFL head coaching records above .500 were former coaches Groh (9–7) and O&#x27;Brien (52–48 during season, 2–4 in playoffs).

==Personal life==
Nick Saban and Belichick are good friends. In 2007, when Belichick spoke about their relationship, he said: &quot;Two successful Croats in the same division of NFL. You must admit, you don&#x27;t see that every day.&quot; In May 2018, President Donald Trump appointed Belichick to be a member of his Council on Sports, Fitness &amp; Nutrition.

Belichick has an Alaskan Klee Kai dog named Nike. Interest in the breed surged after Nike made an appearance on camera during the 2020 NFL draft.

Belichick has dual Croatian/American citizenship. He received Croatian citizenship on June 3, 2024, in Banski dvori in Zagreb from the Croatian prime minister Andrej Plenković. He was also special guest of the association football friendly match on Stadion Rujevica between Croatia and North Macedonia.

=== Family ===
Belichick was married to Debby Clarke from 1977 to 2006. They have three children. Their daughter Amanda played lacrosse at Wesleyan University, and she is the head women&#x27;s lacrosse coach at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts in July 2015. Their son Stephen played lacrosse and football at Rutgers University, served as an assistant coach with the Patriots, and is currently the defensive coordinator for the University of North Carolina. Their son Brian is an assistant coach with the Patriots.

Starting in 2007, Belichick was in a relationship with Linda Holliday, the executive director of the Bill Belichick Foundation. The relationship ended in 2023. 

In June 2024, it was reported that Belichick was in a relationship with Jordon Hudson, a 24-year-old former cheerleader and 2024 Miss Maine USA pageant first runner-up. The two reportedly met on a flight in 2021 and have been dating since 2023.

=== Declined Presidential Medal of Freedom ===
On January 10, 2021, &quot;Politico&quot; reported then-President Donald Trump planned to award Belichick the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Belichick indicated that he was flattered to be considered for the honor, but declined the award in a statement issued the next day. His statement referenced the January 6 United States Capitol attack, which the House of Representatives had accused Trump of provoking when it impeached him for the second time of his presidency, and cited Belichick&#x27;s &quot;great reverence for our nation&#x27;s values, freedom and democracy&quot; in light of that event. A number of Massachusetts politicians, including Senator Ed Markey and Representative Jim McGovern, had previously called on him to decline after news of the award became public.

<doc id="648845" wikidata="Q347613" url="?curid=648845" title="Valdecoxib">
<text>Valdecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used in the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and painful menstruation and menstrual symptoms. It is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor. It was patented in 1995.

Valdecoxib was manufactured and marketed under the brand name Bextra by G. D. Searle &amp; Company as an anti-inflammatory arthritis drug. It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on November 20, 2001, to treat arthritis and menstrual cramps, and was available by prescription in tablet form until 2005 when the FDA requested that Pfizer withdraw Bextra from the American market. The FDA cited &quot;potential increased risk for serious cardiovascular (CV) adverse events,&quot; an &quot;increased risk of serious skin reactions&quot; and the &quot;fact that Bextra has not been shown to offer any unique advantages over the other available NSAIDs.&quot;

In 2009, Bextra was at the center of the &quot;largest health-care fraud settlement and the largest criminal fine of any kind ever.&quot; Pfizer paid a $2.3 billion civil and criminal fine. Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, a Pfizer subsidiary, violated the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for misbranding Bextra &quot;with the intent to defraud or mislead.&quot;

A water-soluble and injectable prodrug of valdecoxib, parecoxib, is marketed in the European Union under the tradename Dynastat.

==Uses until 2005==
In the United States, the FDA approved valdecoxib for the treatment of osteoarthritis, adult rheumatoid arthritis, and primary dysmenorrhea.

Valdecoxib was also used off-label for controlling acute pain and various types of surgical pain.

==Side effects and withdrawal from market==
On April 7, 2005, Pfizer withdrew Bextra from the U.S. market on recommendation by the FDA, citing an increased risk of heart attack and stroke and also the risk of a serious, sometimes fatal, skin reaction. This was a result of recent attention to prescription NSAIDs, such as Merck&#x27;s Vioxx. Other reported side effects were angina and Stevens–Johnson syndrome.

Pfizer first acknowledged cardiovascular risks associated with Bextra in October 2004. The American Heart Association soon after was presented with a report indicating patients using Bextra while recovering from heart surgery were 2.19 times more likely to suffer a stroke or heart attack than those taking placebos.

In a large study published in &quot;The Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; in 2006, valdecoxib appeared less adverse for renal (kidney) disease and heart arrhythmia compared to Vioxx, but elevated renal risks were slightly suggested.

==2009 settlement for off-label uses promotions==
On September 2, 2009, the United States Department of Justice fined Pfizer $2.3 billion after one of its subsidiaries, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company, pleaded guilty to marketing four drugs, including Bextra, &quot;with the intent to defraud or mislead.&quot; Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn admitted to criminal conduct in the promotion of Bextra, and agreed to pay the largest criminal fine ever imposed in the United States for any matter, $1.195 billion. A former Pfizer district sales manager was indicted and sentenced to home confinement for destroying documents regarding the illegal promotion of Bextra. In addition, a regional manager pleaded guilty to distribution of a misbranded product, and was fined $75,000 and 24 months on probation.

The remaining $1 billion of the fine were paid to resolve allegations under the civil False Claims Act case and is the largest civil fraud settlement against a pharmaceutical company. Six whistleblowers were awarded more than $102 million for their role in the investigation. Former Pfizer sales representative John Kopchinski acted as a qui tam relator and filed a complaint in 2004 outlining the illegal conduct in the marketing of Bextra. Kopchinski was awarded $51.5 million for his role in the case because the improper marketing of Bextra was the largest piece of the settlement at $1.8 billion.

== Analytical methods ==

Several HPLC-UV methods have been reported for valdecoxib estimation in biological samples like human urine. Valdecoxib has analytical methods for bioequivalence studies, metabolite determination, estimation of formulation, and an HPTLC method for simultaneous estimation in tablet dosage form.

<doc id="648860" wikidata="Q1889346" url="?curid=648860" title="Banjo ukulele">
<text>The banjo ukulele, also known as the banjolele or banjo uke, is a four-stringed musical instrument with a small banjo-type body and a fretted ukulele neck. The earliest known banjoleles were built by John A. Bolander and by Alvin D. Keech, both in 1917.

The instrument achieved its greatest popularity in the 1920s and 1930s, and combines the small scale, tuning, and playing style of a ukulele with the construction and distinctive tone of a banjo, hence the name. Its development was pushed by the need for vaudeville performers to have an instrument that could be played with the ease of the ukulele, but with more volume. 

==Construction and tuning==

In terms of overall construction, banjo ukuleles parallel banjos, though on a smaller scale. They are always fretted. Most are built of wood with metal accoutrements, although the mid-century &quot;Dixie&quot; brand featured banjo ukuleles made from solid metal.

The banjo ukulele neck typically has sixteen frets, and is the same scale length as a soprano or, less commonly, concert or tenor-sized ukulele. Banjo ukuleles may be open-backed, or may incorporate a resonator.

Banjo ukulele heads were traditionally made of calf skin, but most modern instruments are fitted with synthetic heads. Some players prefer the natural skin heads for a more traditional tone. Tightening or loosening the drum head, through adjusting the tension hooks fitted around the outside of the drum, results in a change in tone. The head typically has a firm tension. Tightening it so that it is rock hard to the touch gives a bright sound with good note distinction, but less bass response. Loosening it so it is softer, yet still tight enough to keep the bridge in place with the tension of the strings, results in a warmer, less bright sound. The bridge floats on the head and is held in place by the tension of the strings.

Like standard ukuleles, banjo ukuleles were originally outfitted with gut strings. Nylon strings are now typically used, sometimes with a wound third string.

The banjolele is commonly tuned G–C–E–A (&quot;C Tuning&quot;) or A–D–F♯–B (&quot;D Tuning&quot;), with a re-entrant 4th string. The A–D–F♯–B tuning often produces a more strident tone, and is used for this reason. Both of these tunings are known as &quot;my dog has fleas&quot; tunings (fifth, tonic, major third, major sixth).

==Popular culture==
The banjo ukulele was the instrument played by British comedian George Formby (1904–1961), who developed his own style of playing in accompaniment to his comic songs. His name is associated with the instrument more than that of any other musician.

Other artists to make eminent use of the banjolele were Wendell Hall and Roy Smeck in the United States, and Billy &quot;Uke&quot; Scott in Great Britain.

In P.G. Wodehouse&#x27;s 1934 novel &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot;, valet Jeeves is driven to resign over his employer Bertie Wooster&#x27;s decision to take up the banjo ukulele.

In Season 2 of &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;, prison guard O&#x27;Neill excitedly tells Caputo about his purchase of a banjo ukulele. He later plays it for a group of nuns.

British comedian Peter Sellers was a banjo ukulele player and recorded &quot;New York Girls&quot; with Steeleye Span

Queen member Brian May used a banjo ukulele in the song &quot;Bring Back That Leroy Brown&quot;, which appeared on their third album &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot;. He also used one to compose &quot;Good Company&quot; for their album &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, although on the recording he used a regular ukulele.

George Harrison favored the instrument in his later years, using it in several recordings. For example, he played it on his song &quot;Any Road&quot;.

Recent users of the banjo ukulele have included Jeff Claus of The Horse Flies, Alan Randall, Andy Eastwood, comedian Frank Skinner, Mr. B The Gentleman Rhymer, and &quot;Steven Universe&quot; creator Rebecca Sugar. The instrument can be heard in the theme song to the television show &quot;Arrested Development&quot;.
In the 1959 hotrod-monster movie &quot;The Giant Gila Monster&quot;, protagonist Chase Winstead (Don Sullivan) plays the banjolele and sings, first to his little sister who has a disability, and later in front of a bunch of kids at a sock hop shortly before a monster attacks the hall.

<doc id="648867" wikidata="Q217621" url="?curid=648867" title="Picris">
<text>Picris (oxtongues) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1753.

&quot;Picris&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, such as the grass moth &quot;Diasemia reticularis&quot;. &quot;Schinia cardui&quot; feeds exclusively on &quot;P. hieracioides&quot;.

The genus is widespread across Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Picris&quot; is from the Greek meaning &#x27;bitter&#x27;, in reference to the bitter taste of some species in the genus.

==Description==
Erect annual to perennial taprooted herbs, mostly branching, stem and leaves bearing stiff bristly hairs, with rather large, usually corymbose or paniculate heads of yellow flowers.

==Taxonomy==
===Taxonomic history===
The genus &quot;Picris&quot; was first validly described by Linnaeus in 1753 with the genus being accepted by a number of secondary sources including Plants of the World Online. Linnaeus initially described four species with &quot;P. hieracioides&quot;, &quot;P. echioides&quot;, &quot;P. pyrenaica&quot; and &quot;P. asplenioides&quot;. In 1913, Britton and Brown proposed &quot;P. asplenioides&quot; as the type species for the genus. Subsequently, in 1930, Hitchcock and Green alternatively proposed &quot;P. hieracioides&quot; as the type species. The Hitchcock and Green proposal was adopted by in 1975 and accepted by in 1992. Lack argued that Linnaeus never saw &quot;P. asplenioides&quot; which Linnaeus regarded as an obscure species and no specimen could be found in the Linnean Herbarium. For this reason Lack concluded that &quot;P. hieracioides&quot; should be designated as the type species.

In 1794, the German botanist Conrad Moench described the genus &quot;Medicusia&quot; and the species &quot;M. aspera&quot;. This genus has not been accepted and is considered a synonym of &quot;Picris&quot;. &quot;M. aspera&quot; has also been determined to be a synonym of &quot;P. rhagadioloides&quot;.

<text>Brunon Synak (23 October 1943 – 18 December 2013) was a Kashubian sociologist, politician and local government activist. He was Chairman of the Main Board of the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association.

== Life history ==

=== Childhood and education ===

Brunon Synak was born on 23 October 1943 in Podjazy in the Sulęczyno commune. His father, Ambroży Synak, was the director of a local mill, and his mother, Helena née Kotłowska, took care of the children and the household. Having finished his education at the primary school of Podjazy, in 1957 Brunon Synak was admitted to the Pedagogical High School in Kościerzyna, where he passed the Polish end-of-school examination (&quot;matura&quot;) in 1962. Then he undertook work as a teacher in the primary school of Borek Kamienny. In 1963, he continued his education in the Teacher&#x27;s School of Physical Education in Gdańsk (which was later transformed into the Academy of Physical Education and Sport in Gdańsk). During his stay at the School, he began studying pedagogy at the Higher Pedagogical School in Gdańsk and was actively involved in the Scientific Sociological Circle of the Department of Sociology. Having obtained the vocational title of the Master, in 1969 he was employed as the factory&#x27;s sociologist in the Radio Factory &quot;Radmor&quot; of Gdynia. After a year&#x27;s work at the enterprise, he undertook PhD studies at the Institute of Sociology of the University of Warsaw. Under the supervision of professor Stefan Nowakowski, he wrote his doctoral dissertation focusing on the life and financial situation of the elderly in the country. In 1973, he defended his PhD dissertation.

=== Scientific work ===

Having obtained the doctoral degree, he was employed at the Department of Sociology of the University of Gdańsk, the Director of which was then professor Bolesław Maroszek. Synak many times stayed at the University in Turk which had signed a contract of cooperation with his University. In 1983, he participated in a trip of the members of the Scientific Sociological Circle to the University of Tromsø. Apart from that, he cooperated with and was a scientific intern of the University of Aberdeen, the University of Cambridge, and the Free University of Berlin. At the same time, in 1983, he obtained the degree of assistant professor. In 1989, as a result of a division of the Department of Sociology, he became the Director of the Department of General Sociology. He held this position for many years. On 27 December 1993, he obtained the degree of professor of humanities.
In the years 1988–1989, Brunon Synak presided over the Gdańsk branch of the Polish Sociological Society. In his scientific work, he focused mainly on concepts related to social gerontology, which touched upon, inter alia, the situation of the elderly in the countryside environments and the influences of the transformation processes. He researched the countryside environment in the Gdańsk Pomerania, where he focused mainly on the changes on the countryside areas under the influence of the processes of migration, urbanization, the situation of elderly farmers, generation conflicts, the social advancement of the youth. In 1986, he joined the research team (including Marek Latoszek and Olgierd Sochacki) conducting, for the first time as wide in range, field research in Kashubia under a draft title &quot;Ethnicity as a structural factor of local communities&quot; (&quot;Etniczność jako czynnik strukturalny społeczności lokalnych&quot;). The results led to publishing, in 1990, the sociological monograph &quot;Kashubians&quot; (&quot;Kaszubi&quot;). In 1991, Brunon Synak and other researchers were awarded the Stolem Medal for this monograph by &quot;Pomorania&quot; Student Organization. In 2012, his contribution in this area was appreciated again - he was awarded the Jan Heweliusz Scientific Prize of the City of Gdańsk (&quot;Nagroda Naukowa Miasta Gdańska im. Jana Heweliusza&quot;).
Brunon Synak held also administrative positions at the University of Gdańsk; he was a member of the rectorial council for many years. In 1984, he was appointed to the position of the Pro-rector for Student Affairs, from which he resigned, together with other representatives of the University authorities, in the name of solidarity with Rector Karol Taylor. Taylor was dismissed from his position after he, together with his co-employees, participated in the funeral of the student Marcin Antonowicz who had been fatally beaten by the Citizen&#x27;s Militia of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic. He became a member of the rectorial council again in 1990, when he was appointed to the position of the Pro-rector for Teaching Affairs (later the name of the position was changed into Pro-rector for Educational Affairs). Under the supervision of Rector Zbigniew Grzonka, he prepared a programme of a reform of the previous manner of teaching at the University of Gdańsk. Although the programme was accepted, it was not fully implemented. He continued holding the position of Pro-rector in the next term (his candidature was passed with one vote). During the presidential campaign in 1995, with regard to journalists&#x27; questions as to the authenticity of Aleksander Kwaśniewski&#x27;s declaration of having a degree of higher education, he stated that in the light of the documents of the University, the politician had not graduated from higher education studies.
Brunon Synak was also a lecturer at the Academy of Tourism and Hotel Management (&quot;Wyższa Szkoła Turystyki i Hotelarstwa&quot;) in Gdańsk.

=== Political and local-governmental activity ===

In 1969, he was admitted to the then-ruling Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza, PZPR&quot;). Later he justified the decision with conformism. After the events of August 1980, he became a member of the University branch of the Solidarity Trade Union (&quot;Niezależny Samorządny Związek Zawodowy &quot;Solidarność&quot;),&quot; whom he was up to 2006. He resigned from membership in the PZPR after the declaration of martial law in 1981.

In the elections of 1998, he was elected from the Electoral Action Solidarity list for the freshly established Pomeranian local government (&quot;sejmik&quot;). In 2002, he was reelected for the second term from a joint list of the Civic Platform (&quot;Platforma Obywatelska, PO&quot;) and Law and Justice (&quot;Prawo i Sprawiedliwość, PiS&quot;) (as a candidate of the Civic Platform). He was then appointed the Chairman of &quot;sejmik&quot;. He became the initiator of actions stressing the heritage and diversity of the Pomeranian province (&quot;województwo&quot;) - devoting subsequent years to particular cultural subregions of the province. In 2006, from the list of the Civic Platform, he was elected for the third term and again became the Chairman. In 2010 he decided to pull back political activity, mainly on account of his progressive illness.
As part of over-regional activity, in the years 2000–2004, Brunon Synak presided over the Baltic Sea States Subregional Co-operation Conference. He also participated in the works of the Committee of Regions of the European Union, was a Deputy Chairman of a fraction of the European People&#x27;s Party in the RC. In 2004, he was a candidate for the European Parliament and gained almost 34 thousand votes.

=== Activity in the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association ===

In 1985, he became a member of the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association. Soon, he was elected a member of the Main Board of the organisation. He was there responsible for cooperation with and taking care of &quot;Pomorania&quot; Student Organisation, for which the Association is an umbrella organisation. On 5 December 1998, he was elected the Chairman of the Main Board of the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association (in 2000, the position was renamed as the Chairman of the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association). He held this position for the next two terms until December 2004. During his management, field structures of the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association in Kashubia developed but at the same time, branches in Kociewie and Bory Tucholskie went into decline. As a result of his actions, the buildings of the Kashubian People&#x27;s University (&quot;Kaszubski Uniwersytet Ludowy&quot;) in Wieżyca and Starbienino became the Association&#x27;s ownership. In February 2004, it was decided to establish the &quot;Kashubian People&#x27;s University&quot; Foundation, and on 8 May that year, Brunon Synak became the first Chairman of the Council of the Foundation.
When he presided over the Association, Brunon Synak strived for elements of Kashubian culture and language to be present during the service and liturgy. In October 2004, he initiated the Kashubian trip to Rome to pray for the beatification of bishop Konstantyn Dominik. For the first time in the history of St Peter&#x27;s Basilica in the Vatican, a mass was said with elements of the liturgy in the Kashubian language. During his presiding over the Association, in June 1999, the first Convention of Kashubians took place in Chojnice. At that time, works on the Act of 2005 on National and Ethnic Minorities and Regional Languages were in progress.

== Publications ==

Brunon Synak has published ca. 250 scientific works. His first book, a changed version of his doctoral dissertation, was &quot;Problems of Old Farmers&quot; (&quot;Problemy starych rolników&quot;), published in 1976. In 2010, he published a book &quot;My Kashubian Path&quot; (&quot;Moja kaszubska stegna&quot;), in which autobiographical threads are included with reference to his own thoughts on the fate of Kashubians from the end of WW II to the current times.

== Awards and distinctions ==

Under President Bronisław Komorowski&#x27;s decision of 8 November 2010, Brunon Synak was appointed a Knight of the Order of Polonia Restituta &quot;for outstanding contribution to the development of territorial government in Poland, for achievements in scientific and didactic work&quot;. In 2011, he was a laureate of the honourable distinction &quot;For Contribution to the Pomeranian Voivodeship&quot; (&quot;Za Zasługi dla Województwa Pomorskiego&quot;). For his activity in support of the development and upgrading of the Kashubian identity, in 2008, he was awarded the Florian Ceynowa Medal &quot;Awakener of Kashubians&quot; (&quot;Budziciel Kaszubów&quot;).

<text>West Bay, originally known as Bridport Harbour, is a small harbour settlement and resort on the English Channel coast in Dorset, England, sited at the mouth of the River Brit approximately south of Bridport. The area is part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site.

The harbour at West Bay is not a natural landscape feature and it has a long history of having been silted up, blocked by shingle and damaged by storms, and each time repairs, improvements and enlargements have subsequently been made. The harbour has been moved twice: it was originally inland, then was moved to the coast beside the East Cliff, then was moved again along the coast to the west, where it is located today.

The previous main commercial trade of the harbour—exporting Bridport&#x27;s ropes and nets—declined in the second half of the 19th century. When the railway arrived in 1884, attempts were made to provide the settlement with the facilities of a resort, and today West Bay has a mixed economy of tourism and fishing.

==History==

Bridport historically needed a harbour to export its principal products, rope and nets. Originally the harbour was about inland, close to the town, and its exit to the sea—the river mouth—was east of its current position. The Anglo-Saxons and Normans struggled to keep the harbour open because the river mouth repeatedly silted up and was blocked by shingle from Chesil Beach, so eventually a system of sluices was devised to help keep it clear.

In 1388 John Huderesfeld, a local merchant, started building a new harbour and levied a toll on goods loaded and unloaded. The toll was a market privilege granted to him for three years as a result of his petition that finishing the construction would not be possible without aid. After completion in 1395 a customs officer was employed full-time as trade grew. The new harbour prospered for fifty years until winter storms and an outbreak of Black Death damaged respectively its structure and trade, so in 1444 construction of a new harbour commenced—prompted by an indulgence granted by the Bishop of Sarum—and on its completion the harbour again prospered.

By the 18th century the small harbour was ill-equipped to deal with the increasing size of ships, plus the problems of silting and storm damage had never been fully resolved, so in 1740 work commenced on building another new harbour to the west. This is the site of the harbour as seen today. Two piers, extending as far as the low tide mark, were constructed to house the harbour. The river was also diverted to run between the piers. The work cost £3,500 and was undertaken by John Reynolds of Cheshire. It was supposed to have taken only two years, but the new harbour didn&#x27;t open officially until 1744. It could hold forty sailing ships. 
Shipbuilding yards were set up west of the new harbour. They constructed a variety of vessels including frigates, cutters, schooners, brigantines, barques and fishing smack. The first registered launch was the 270 ton brig &quot;Adventurer&quot; in 1779, the last was the &quot;Lilian&quot; exactly a century later. The largest launch was the 1,002 ton &quot;Speedy&quot; in 1853. At one point the yards employed 300 men. In 1823, to accommodate further increases in trade, the basin of the harbour was enlarged eastwards and the old harbour gates were replaced by a sluice. As well as exporting Bridport&#x27;s ropes, the harbour also imported raw materials such as gravel, coal and timber. By 1830 over 500 vessels were using the harbour each year.

Around 1865 the wooden piers were rebuilt in stone and the sluices were rebuilt. Despite these improvements however, trade at the harbour had begun to decline. Bridport&#x27;s rope and nets were in less demand, and sailing ships were being supplanted by steam-powered vessels. In addition, the Great Western Railway&#x27;s Bridport Railway had reached Bridport in 1857, and started taking the harbour&#x27;s trade. The amount of harbour dues taken showed the extent of the decline: in 1881 they amounted to only 10% of those collected half a century before.
The railway was extended from Bridport to Bridport Harbour in 1884. The railway company named the new harbour station West Bay, as part of an effort to rebrand the harbour as a resort. Local businessmen—including the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers and the Earl of Ilchester—funded the extension. Subsequently, they established the West Bay Building Company to build villas and lodging houses for visitors. Only a terrace of ten lodging houses—Pier Terrace—was completed, designed by the Arts and Crafts Movement architect Edward Schroeder Prior in 1885. In 1942, because the terrace had an appearance reminiscent of some northern French ports, West Bay was used as a training ground for the Dieppe Raid. The terrace remains a prominent feature of the harbourside.

Between 1919 and 1930, coinciding with increased car ownership and personal mobility, new housing was built on the hillslope to the west of the harbour, on the landward side of West Cliff. The railway line between West Bay and Bridport closed to passengers in 1930, and operated for goods services only until its final closure in 1962. The station however was restored in the 1980s, and two old railway coaches have been installed on a short length of relaid track. In the second half of the 20th century further residential and tourism-related development occurred around the harbour and old shipbuilding area: new houses were built, old buildings were converted into cafés and shops, and several car parks were created.

At the start of the 21st century, as part of a new coastal defence scheme, the harbour&#x27;s west pier was replaced and the east pier rebuilt; the work was completed in March 2005. The new west pier is named the Jurassic Pier. The scheme extended the facilities of the harbour, with a new slipway and outer harbour. This has enabled the harbour to be used on the 50% of days when southerly swell conditions occur, which previously was not possible. After the construction work a small regeneration scheme was implemented, with new housing—called Quay West—built on the west side of the harbour, on part of the old shipyard area.

==Government==

For elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, West Bay is within the West Dorset parliamentary constituency.

In local government, Dorset Council is responsible for services such as highways, public transport, strategic planning, environmental services and environmental health, tourism and leisure, economic development, local planning and development control, and social services. For elections to the council, West Bay is in the Bridport electoral ward.

At the parish level, West Bay is mostly within the South ward of Bridport Parish, though small areas also lie within the parishes of Symondsbury and Burton Bradstock. The parish authority for Bridport is Bridport Town Council, which is responsible for supplementing local government services and promoting and representing the town. The South ward is represented by nine councillors.

==Geography and geology==

West Bay is situated at the mouth of the River Brit on the English Channel coast. It is south of Bridport and west-northwest of Weymouth and lies within the Dorset unitary authority area. The coast at West Bay forms part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site which stretches for and includes most of the Dorset coastline. West Bay also lies within the Dorset National Landscape.

West Bay is sited on deposits of river alluvium that indicate a former estuary. There are beaches and cliffs on either side of the harbour. The beaches were previously of a similar size—in terms of their seaward extent—but now East Beach is considerably larger, due to accumulation of finer sediment. East Beach is also designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and forms one end of Chesil Beach, a barrier beach which extends southeast for toward the Isle of Portland.

The cliffs to the east of the harbour are composed of Bridport Sand Formation and Inferior Oolite, while immediately to the west they are Frome Clay (Upper Fullers Earth) and Forest Marble. The Bridport Sands deposits were laid down in the Toarcian Age toward the end of the Early Jurassic; they are arranged horizontally with clear banding visible alternating between harder and softer material. The cliff&#x27;s distinctive colour is a result of oxidisation of fine pyrite grains, resulting in limonite. The Frome Clay and Forest Marble of the West Cliff are younger and were formed in the Bathonian Age of the Middle Jurassic. The section of the West Cliff closest to the harbour has been engineered as part of coastal defence management; large protective boulders on the foreshore are backed by a sea wall, promenade and artificial grass-covered slope.

There are several geological faults in the West Bay area. The Eype Mouth Fault, resulting from movement late in the Cimmerian Orogeny (but probably originating in the Jurassic), has a vertical displacement of and is aligned east-west, emerging on the coast obliquely in West Cliff. It is intersected in the Brit Valley by the Mangerton Strike-Slip Fault, a later movement—probably Paleogene or Neogene—which is aligned roughly northeast-southwest.
===Coastal defence management===
The coast at West Bay is an eroding landscape, with various processes involved. The coastline faces southwest—the direction of the prevailing winds—toward the Atlantic Ocean, where the fetch length is over , resulting in the potential for large and destructive swell waves. The 18th-century construction of the harbour piers interrupted the natural transport of protective sediment along the shore, reducing the size of the West Beach and enabling the sea to more easily cause damage. The West Cliff is subject to the non-marine processes of slipping and mass slumping, caused by the clay sliding over lower layers and possibly exacerbated by faults within it. The East Cliff is protected to a degree by the East Beach, though it is still eroded by wave attrition and pounding at its base, resulting in rock falls.

Over the decades various initiatives have been put in place to try and protect property and livelihoods. A sea wall was constructed behind the West Beach in 1887, then was rebuilt in 1982. The first section of the West Cliff—and the houses behind it—was protected in 1969 with construction of rock piles, a further sea wall, and artificial sloping of the cliff face. In 1986 the East Beach was artificially raised with extra shingle to a height of above Ordnance Datum; subsequent management by the Environment Agency has involved regular monitoring and replenishment of this shingle barrier.

Despite such measures, serious storm damage or flooding events occurred seven times between 1974 and 1996. Assessments by structural engineers in 2001 concluded that, without remedial action, there was a 50% chance of a major failure of the old piers and sea walls within five years. The recent West Bay Coastal Defence and Harbour Improvements Scheme (construction of the Jurassic Pier and outer harbour) is the latest attempt to solve these problems.

===Cliff falls===
The production team of &quot;Broadchurch&quot; was criticised by the West Bay coastguards in June 2014 for filming too close to the edge of East Cliff. Severe weather and recent rock-slides left the cliffs unstable, and a coastguard volunteer said the production team should have used stakes, safety lines, harnesses, and helmets. A spokesperson for the &quot;Broadchurch&quot; production defended the film crew, noting that the production team had received all necessary filming permits, had visited the site numerous times to ensure safety, and taken other reasonable health and safety precautions.

In 2019, a 1,000-tonne cliff fall at East Cliff was caught on the Environment Agency&#x27;s CCTV. A group of walkers were nearby at the time but were not injured.

==Economy==
West Bay is a centre for fishing, tourism (focused on boats and the beach) and geology.
===Tourism and leisure===
Fishing trips are available in the summer, including deep sea fishing. Boats can also be hired to row up the River Brit towards Bridport. The harbour has a secure boat park, holding up to seventy boats and entered via an electronic fob system; it is located behind the George Hotel and operates a waiting-list system.

The West Bay area has a number of local caravan and camping sites, as well as hotels and B&amp;Bs, both in the bay area and the surrounding villages such as Burton Bradstock. The West Bay harbour area has many kiosks serving various types of menus, including traditional fish and chips, often with locally caught fish. Near the harbour area are three pubs, each serving food. The Station Kitchen is a restaurant in the old West Bay station which includes a World War One ambulance train carriage.

The Bridport and West Dorset Golf Club, situated on top of the east cliff, has a full 18-hole course.

The West Bay Discovery Centre is a small museum located in the historic (Grade II listed) former Methodist Church telling the history of West Bay.

==Filming location==
West Bay beach was used in the introduction to the BBC television series &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot; and for location filming in the television series &quot;Harbour Lights&quot;. The town, harbour, and beach were used as locations in &quot;The Navy Lark&quot; and the 2013 ITV series &quot;Broadchurch&quot;. The West Bay and Bridport area experienced an increase in visitor numbers following transmission of &quot;Broadchurch&quot;; in one survey of sixty tourism-related local businesses, over three-quarters of respondents stated that trade had increased in 2013, and nearly half of these attributed this to &quot;Broadchurch&quot;. Very short portions of the second and third series were also filmed in the area.

<text>A nationwide census, known as Census 2001, was conducted in the United Kingdom on Sunday, 29 April 2001. This was the 20th UK census and recorded a resident population of 58,789,194.

The 2001 UK census was organised by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in England and Wales, the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). Detailed results by region, council area, ward and output area are available from their respective websites.

==Organisation==
Similar to previous UK censuses, the 2001 census was organised by the three statistical agencies, ONS, GROS, and NISRA, and coordinated at the national level by the Office for National Statistics. The Orders in Council to conduct the census, specifying the people and information to be included in the census, were made under the authority of the Census Act 1920 in Great Britain, and the Census Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 in Northern Ireland. In England and Wales these regulations were made by the Census Order 2000 (SI 744/2000), in Scotland by the Census (Scotland) Order 2000 (SSI 68/2000), and in Northern Ireland by the Census Order (Northern Ireland) 2000 (SRNI 168/2000).

The census was administered through self-completion forms, in most cases delivered by to households and communal establishments in the three weeks before census night on 29 April. For the first time return by post was used as the main collection method, with enumerators following up in person where the forms were not returned. The postal response rate was 88% in England and Wales, 91% in Scotland, and 92% in Northern Ireland. A total of 81,000 field staff were employed across the UK (70,000 in England and Wales, 8,000 in Scotland and 3,000 in Northern Ireland). The census was conducted at the height of the foot-and-mouth crisis, which led to extra precautions being adopted by the field staff, and suggestions that the census may have to be postponed. However, it was reported that the disease outbreak did not affect the effectiveness of the collection process.

The census was estimated to cost £259m over its 13-year cycle from the start of planning in 1993 to the delivery of final results in 2006. Printing of the 30 million census forms was subcontracted to Polestar Group, and processing of the returned census forms was subcontracted to Lockheed Martin in a contract worth £54m. The forms were initially scanned into digital format, then read with OMR and OCR, with manual entry where the automatic process could not read the forms. The forms were then pulped and recycled, and the digital copies printed onto microfilm for storage and release after 100 years. Once the data were returned to the statistics agencies it underwent further processing to ensure consistency and to impute missing values.

==Enumeration==
The overall response rate for the census, that is the proportion of the population who were included on a census form, was estimated to be 94% in England and Wales, 96.1% in Scotland and 95.2% in Northern Ireland. This was due to a number of factors: households with no response, households excluding residents from their returns, and addresses not included in the enumeration. In Manchester for example 25,000 people from 14,000 addresses were not enumerated because the address database was two years out of date. The Local Authority with the lowest response was Kensington and Chelsea with 64%. Hackney had the next lowest response at 72%. Out of all local authorities, the ten lowest response rates were all in London. The results still represent 100 per cent of the population, however, because some individuals not completing their forms were instead identified by census enumerators, and through the use of cross-matching with a follow-up survey.

==One Number Census==
The results from the 2001 census were produced using a methodology known as the One Number Census. This was an attempt to adjust the census counts and impute answers to allow for estimated under-enumeration measured by the Census Coverage Survey (sample size 320,000 households), resulting in a single set of population estimates.

==Religion==
Although the 1851 census had included a question about religion on a separate response sheet, whose completion was not compulsory, the 2001 census was the first in Great Britain to ask about the religion of respondents on the main census form. An amendment to the 1920 Census Act (the Census (Amendment) Act 2000) was passed by Parliament to allow the question to be asked, and to allow the response to this question to be optional. The inclusion of the question enabled the Jedi census phenomenon to take place in the United Kingdom. In England and Wales 390,127 people stated their religion as Jedi, as did 14,052 people in Scotland.
The percentages of religious affiliations were:
* Christian: 72.0%
* Muslim: 3%
* Hindu: 1%
* Sikh: 0.6%
* Jewish: 0.5%
* Buddhist: 0.3%
* Any other religion: 0.3%
15% declared themselves of no religion (including Jedi at 0.7%, more than those who declared themselves as Sikh, Jewish or Buddhist) and 8% did not respond to the question.

==Ethnicity==

===Results===
The census ethnic groups included White (White British, White Irish, Other White), Mixed (White and Black Caribbean, White and Black African, White and Asian, Other Mixed), Asian or Asian British (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Other Asian), Black or Black British (Black Caribbean, African, Other Black) and Chinese or Other Ethnic Group.

Since the UK census relies on self-completion, the composition of the other ethnic group category is not fixed. Analysis by the Office for National Statistics of the 220,000 people in England and Wales who ticked the other ethnic group box in the 2001 census reveals that 53 per cent were born in the Far East, 10 per cent in the UK, 10 per cent in the Middle East, and 7 per cent in Africa. People could write in an ethnic group under the &#x27;other&#x27; heading. 26 per cent did not specify an ethnicity, but of the remainder 23 per cent wrote Filipino, 21 per cent Japanese, 11 per cent Vietnamese, 11 per cent Arab, 6 per cent Middle Eastern and 4 per cent North African.

===English identity===

Controversy surrounding the classification of ethnic groups began as early as 2000, when it was revealed that respondents in Scotland and Northern Ireland would be able to check a box describing themselves as Scottish or Irish, an option not available for English respondents. With an absence of an English tick-box, the only other tickbox available was &quot;white-British&quot;, &quot;Irish&quot;, or &quot;other&quot;. However, if &#x27;English&#x27; was written in under the &quot;any other white background&quot; it was not clear whether it would be counted as an ethnic group in same the way as the Welsh. Following criticism, English was included as a tick-box option in the 2011 census.

===Welsh identity===

It is sometimes claimed that the 2001 census revealed that two-thirds of the population of Wales described themselves as of Welsh nationality. In fact, the 2001 census did not collect any information on nationality. Controversy surrounding the classification of ethnic group began as early as 2000, when it was revealed that respondents in Scotland and Northern Ireland would be able to check a box describing themselves as Scottish or Irish, an option not available for Welsh respondents. Prior to the census, &quot;Plaid Cymru&quot; backed a petition calling for the inclusion of a Welsh tickbox and for the National Assembly for Wales to have primary law-making powers and its own National Statistics Office. With an absence of a Welsh tickbox, the only other tickbox available was &quot;white-British&quot;, &quot;Irish&quot;, or &quot;other&quot;.

===Cornish identity===
For the first time in a UK census, those wishing to describe their ethnicity as Cornish were given their own code number (06) on the 2001 UK census form, alongside those for people wishing to describe themselves as English, Welsh, Irish or Scottish. About 34,000 people in Cornwall and 3,500 people in the rest of the UK wrote on their census forms in 2001 that they considered their ethnic group to be Cornish. This represented nearly 7% of the population of Cornwall. Various Cornish organisations were campaigning for the inclusion of the Cornish tick box on the next census in 2011.

<text>The co-princes of Andorra are jointly the heads of state () of the Principality of Andorra, a landlocked microstate lying in the Pyrenees between France and Spain. Founded in 1278 by a treaty between the bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix, this unique diarchical arrangement has persisted through the Middle Ages to the present. Currently, the bishop of Urgell (Joan Enric Vives i Sicília) and the president of France (Emmanuel Macron) serve as Andorra&#x27;s co-princes, following the transfer of the count of Foix&#x27;s claims to the Crown of France and, subsequently, to the head of state of the French Republic. Each co-prince appoints a personal representative. The bishop co-prince is currently being represented by Josep Maria Mauri and the French co-prince by Patrick Strzoda.

==Origin and development of the co-principality==
Tradition holds that Charlemagne granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for their fighting against the Moors. The feudal overlord of this territory was at first the count of Urgell. In 988, however, the count, Borrell II, gave Andorra to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in Cerdanya. The Bishop of Urgell, based in Seu d&#x27;Urgell, has ruled Andorra ever since.

Before 1095, Andorra did not have any type of military protection, and since the bishop of Urgell knew that the count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys, he asked for help from the lord of Caboet. In 1095, the lord and the bishop signed a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra. Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the viscount of Castellbò, and both became viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya. Their daughter, Ermessenda, married Roger Bernat II, the French count of Foix. They became, respectively, Count and Countess of Foix, Viscount and Viscountess of Castellbò and Cerdanya, and also co-sovereigns of Andorra (together with the bishop of Urgell).

In the 11th century, a dispute arose between the bishop of Urgell and the count of Foix. The conflict was mediated by Aragon in 1278, and led to the signing of the first paréage, which provided that Andorra&#x27;s sovereignty be shared between the count and the bishop. This gave the principality its territory and political form, and marked the formal commencement of Andorra&#x27;s unique monarchical arrangement.

Through inheritance, the Foix title to Andorra passed to the kings of Navarre. After Henry III of Navarre was crowned Henry IV of France, he issued an edict in 1607 establishing the king of France and the Bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra. In 1812–13, the First French Empire under Napoleon annexed Catalonia and divided it into four départements, with Andorra forming part of the district of Puigcerdà (department of Sègre). Following the defeat of Napoleon, a royal decree reversed this annexation, and Andorra reverted to its former independence and political state. The French head of state—whether king, emperor, or president—has continued to serve as a co-prince of Andorra ever since.

==Recent history==

On 12 July 1934, Andorra&#x27;s monarchical system was challenged by an adventurer named Boris Skossyreff, who issued a proclamation in Urgell declaring himself &quot;Boris I, King of Andorra&quot;. Though initially enjoying some support within Andorra&#x27;s political establishment, he was ultimately arrested by Spanish authorities on 20 July 1934 after declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell (who had refused to relinquish his own claim to the principality). Skossyreff was expelled, and was never considered to have been the Andorran monarch in any legal sense.

Before 1993, Andorra had no codified constitution, and the exact prerogatives of the co-princes were not specifically defined in law. In March 1993, a Constitution was approved by a vote of the Andorran people and signed into law by the two reigning co-princes at the time: Bishop Joan Martí Alanis and President François Mitterrand. It clarified the continuance of the unique Andorran diarchy, and also delineated the precise role and prerogatives of the two co-princes. Prior to adoption of the Constitution, Andorra paid in odd-numbered years a tribute of approximately $460 to the French ruler, while on even-numbered years, it paid a tribute of approximately $12 to the Spanish bishop, plus six hams, six cheeses, and six live chickens. This medieval custom was subsequently abandoned in 1993.

In 2009, French president Nicolas Sarkozy threatened to abdicate as French co-prince if the principality did not change its banking laws to eliminate its longstanding status as a tax haven.

In 2014, Joan Enric Vives i Sicília said that he would abdicate as bishop of Urgell and co-prince of Andorra if the Andorran Parliament passed a law legalizing abortion. The bishopric would then be held in abeyance at least until the law had been promulgated, so that no cleric would have to sign it. This would make Andorra the second country (after Belgium) where a head of state refused to sign a law legalizing abortion without preventing the law&#x27;s promulgation.

==Contemporary political role==

The Constitution of Andorra carefully defines the exact role and prerogatives of the co-princes of Andorra today. The constitution establishes Andorra as a &quot;parliamentary coprincipality&quot;, providing for the Bishop of Urgell and the president of France to serve together as joint heads of state. The constitution distinguishes between which powers they may exercise on their own (Article 46), and which require the countersignature of the head of the Andorran government, or the approval of the &quot;Síndic General&quot;, the Andorran legislature (Article 45).

Powers the co-princes may exercise on their own include:
*Joint exercise of the &quot;prerogative of grace&quot; (the power to pardon);
*Each co-prince may appoint one member of the Superior Council of Justice and one member of the Constitutional Tribunal;
*Establishment of such services as they deem necessary to fulfil their constitutional prerogatives, and appointment of individuals to fulfil these services;
*Requesting a preliminary judgement about the constitutionality of proposed laws, or of international treaties;
*Agreeing to the text of any international treaty, prior to submitting it for parliamentary approval;
*Bringing a case before the Constitutional Tribunal in the event of any conflict over the exercise of their constitutional prerogatives.

Powers the co-princes may exercise in conjunction with the head of government include:
*Calling for elections or referendums in accordance with constitutional provisions;
*Appointing the head of government in accordance with constitutional provisions;
*Dissolve the General Council (the Andorran legislature) prior to the expiration of its current term (but not until at least one year has passed since the prior election);
*Accrediting diplomatic representatives from Andorra to foreign states, and receive credentials of foreign representatives to Andorra;
*Appointing office-holders in accordance with appropriate constitutional provisions;
*Sanctioning and enacting laws in accordance with constitutional provisions;
*Granting formal consent to international treaties, once ratified by the General Council.

Each co-prince is granted an annual allowance by the General Council to dispose of as he or she sees fit. Each appoints a personal representative in Andorra, and in the case of incapacitation of one of them, the constitution provides for the other prince to govern in his or her absence, with the concurrence of the Andorran head of government or the General Council.

Certain treaties require the participation of the co-princes (or their designated representatives) in their negotiation process as well as their final approval; these are detailed in Articles 66 and 67 of the constitution.

The co-princes jointly retain the right to propose amendments to the constitution; this same right rests with the General Council. They have no veto power over legislation passed by the General Council, though they do retain a veto over certain international treaties, as described above.

== Vacancy ==
In case of vacancy of either co-prince, Andorra &quot;recognizes the validity of the interim procedures foreseen by their respective statuses, in order for the normal function of Andorran institutions not to be interrupted&quot;.

<text>Face/Off is a 1997 American science fiction action film directed by John Woo, from a screenplay by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary. It stars John Travolta as an FBI agent and Nicolas Cage as a terrorist, who undergo an experimental surgery to swap their faces and identities.

The film co-stars Joan Allen, Gina Gershon, and Alessandro Nivola, and features Dominique Swain, Nick Cassavetes, Harve Presnell, Colm Feore, CCH Pounder, and Thomas Jane in supporting roles. Principal photography began on January 4, 1997 in Los Angeles, and wrapped on April 1. The film score was composed by John Powell.

&quot;Face/Off&quot; was the first Hollywood film in which Woo was given major creative control. It earned critical acclaim for the performances by Cage and Travolta and its stylized action sequences. The film earned $245 million worldwide, making it the 11th highest-grossing film of 1997, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Sound Effects Editing (Mark Stoeckinger and Per Hallberg) at the 70th Academy Awards.

Since its release, the film gained a strong cult following and it is considered by many as one of Woo&#x27;s best films.

==Plot==
FBI Special Agent Sean Archer survives an assassination attempt by Castor Troy, a terrorist-for-hire, but the bullet kills his son Michael. Archer then engages in an extended vendetta against Troy. It culminates, six years later, in his team ambushing Troy, who is with his younger brother and accomplice, Pollux, on a remote desert airstrip. Troy goads Archer by saying he knows of a bomb that is located somewhere in Los Angeles and is set to explode in a few days. But before Archer can learn more, Troy is knocked unconscious and falls into a coma. Pollux, in custody, affirms that the bomb is real but refuses to reveal its location.

In secret, Archer reluctantly undergoes a highly experimental face transplant procedure by Dr. Malcolm Walsh to take on Castor Troy&#x27;s face, voice, and appearance. Archer-as-Troy is taken to the same high-security prison where Pollux is being held in order to obtain information on the bomb&#x27;s location. Troy unexpectedly awakens from his coma and discovers that his face is missing. He calls his gang, and they force Dr. Walsh to transplant Archer&#x27;s face onto him. Meanwhile, Archer successfully learns the location of the bomb from Pollux before being informed shortly thereafter he has a visitor. Anticipating a reunion with his colleagues and a return to his normal life, Archer instead finds Troy wearing his face. Upon revealing he has murdered everyone else who knows about the face transplant, Troy gleefully informs Archer that he looks forward to running his FBI career into the ground and ravishing his wife. An enraged Archer proceeds to strangle him only for the guards to beat him down and take him back to his cell.

Pollux is freed when he willingly tells Troy-as-Archer of the bomb&#x27;s location, and Troy subsequently disarms the bomb. Troy earns admiration from the FBI office and becomes close to Archer&#x27;s wife Eve and daughter Jamie, whom Archer had been neglecting while seeking to avenge the death of his son. Back at the prison, Archer-as-Troy escapes after staging a riot and retreats to Troy&#x27;s headquarters. There, he meets Sasha, the sister of Troy&#x27;s primary drug kingpin Dietrich Hassler, and her son Adam, who reminds him of Michael. Archer discovers that Adam is Troy&#x27;s son. Meanwhile, Troy learns of Archer&#x27;s escape and hastily assembles a team to raid his headquarters.

The raid turns into a bloodbath and many FBI agents and several members of Troy&#x27;s gang (including Dietrich and Pollux) are killed. However, Archer, Sasha, and Adam all manage to escape. In the aftermath of the raid, Archer&#x27;s supervisor, Director Victor Lazarro, angrily lambasts Troy-as-Archer for the unnecessary bloodshed he caused. Troy, still furious over Pollux&#x27;s death, murders Lazarro and is subsequently promoted to acting director in his place. Meanwhile, after taking Sasha and Adam to a safe location, Archer-as-Troy approaches Eve and convinces her to test Troy-as-Archer&#x27;s blood to confirm his identity. After testing the blood and being convinced that the man wearing her husband&#x27;s face is in fact an imposter, Eve tells Archer that Troy will be vulnerable at Lazarro&#x27;s funeral.

At the ceremony, Troy has taken Eve hostage. Sasha arrives, and a gunfight ensues; Sasha manages to save Eve after taking a bullet. Archer promises a dying Sasha that he will take care of Adam and raise him away from criminal life before taking off after Troy. Subsequently, Troy briefly takes Jamie hostage, but she escapes by stabbing him with the butterfly knife that he lent her earlier for self-defense.

Following the confrontation at the church, Troy reaches the docks and commandeers a speedboat while Archer commandeers one of his own to continue the pursuit. The chase ends when Archer forces Troy to the shore in a collision. With their boats grounded, the two proceed to fight to the death. Upon gaining the upper hand in the struggle, Archer manages to corner Troy at gunpoint with a speargun but Troy stops him from shooting by grabbing the firing mechanism. While admitting defeat, Troy-as-Archer proceeds to cut off his face so that Archer-as-Troy will be doomed to wear Troy&#x27;s face forever. Before he can finish, Archer kicks Troy in the groin, causing him to lose his grip on the gun and allowing Archer to finally kill him.

Backup agents arrive and address Archer by his name, having been convinced by Eve of Archer&#x27;s true identity. After the face transplant surgery is reversed, Archer returns home, where he adopts Adam into his family, keeping his promise to Sasha.

==Production==
&quot;Face/Off&quot; was written by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary in 1990 as a spec script. They were inspired to write it after a mutual friend injured themself in a hang-gliding accident. The injury required the friend’s face to be removed and reconstructed before being re-added onto their body. Werb and Colleary were also inspired by the film &quot;White Heat&quot; to create a plot where the main character survived a prison riot. &quot;Face/Off&quot; initially had a futuristic setting. &quot;Face/Off&quot; was optioned to Joel Silver and Warner Bros. in 1991. The option expired in 1994 and the project was purchased by Paramount Pictures. American director and producer Rob Cohen was originally set to direct the film but when the project was in a turnaround Cohen left to direct &quot;Dragonheart&quot; (1996). John Woo became attached in 1996. Various actor pairings were considered for the parts of Sean Archer and Castor Troy, such as Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Douglas and Harrison Ford, and Alec Baldwin and Bruce Willis.

Johnny Depp wanted to play Sean Archer but passed on the role after reading the script. John Woo instead hired John Travolta and Nicolas Cage to play those characters. Michael Douglas served as an executive producer. Werb and Colleary have cited &quot;White Heat&quot; (1949) as an influence on the plot. In preparation, Woo watched &quot;Seconds&quot; (1966) directed by John Frankenheimer. With an $80 million production budget, &quot;Face/Off&quot; made heavy use of action set pieces including several violent shootouts and a boat chase filmed in the Los Angeles area. The boat scene at the end of the film was shot in San Pedro. Calling the brothers Castor and Pollux is a reference to Greek mythology; Castor and Pollux are the twins transformed by the ancient Greek god Zeus into the constellation Gemini.

==Music==

The &quot;Face/Off&quot; soundtrack was released by Hollywood Records on July 1, 1997, the week following the film&#x27;s release. This was the first film to be composed by John Powell and the score was produced by Hans Zimmer.

Several pieces of music and songs were used in the film but not included in the soundtrack. These include:
* &quot;Hallelujah&quot; from oratorio &quot;Messiah&quot; – George Frideric Handel
* Pamina&#x27;s Aria &quot;Ach, ich fühl&#x27;s&quot; from &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; – Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
* &quot;Prelude in D-flat, Op. 28, No. 15&quot; (&quot;Raindrop&quot;) – Frédéric Chopin
* &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Bag&quot; – James Brown
* &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; (Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg) – Olivia Newton-John
* &quot;Christiansands&quot; – Tricky
* &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose Your Head&quot; – INXS
* &quot;&quot;Miserere mei, Deus&quot; (VV.1-4 &amp; 17-20)&quot; – Gregorio Allegri

It went on to become the 11th highest domestic and 14th worldwide grossing film of 1997, earning a domestic total of $112,276,146 and $133,400,000 overseas for a total of worldwide gross of $245,676,146.

===Critical response===
The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes records that 93% of 95 critical reviews were positive, with an average rating of 7.80/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;John Travolta and Nicolas Cage play cat-and-mouse (and literally play each other) against a beautifully stylized backdrop of typically elegant, over-the-top John Woo violence.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 82 out of 100 from 26 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The role reversal between Travolta and Cage was a subject of praise, as were the stylized, violent action sequences. Critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four and remarked the basic plot concept was &quot;utterly absurd&quot;, but Woo&#x27;s inventive direction along with clever performances made the film entertaining: &quot;Here, using big movie stars and asking them to play each other, Woo and his writers find a terrific counterpoint to the action scenes: All through the movie, you find yourself reinterpreting every scene as you realize the &#x27;other&#x27; character is &#x27;really&#x27; playing it.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Peter Travers said of the film, &quot;You may not buy the premise or the windup, but with Travolta and Cage taking comic and psychic measures of their characters and their own careers, there is no resisting &quot;Face/Off&quot;. This you gotta see.&quot; Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; said that the film &quot;isn&#x27;t just a thrill ride, it&#x27;s a rocket into the thrilling past, when directors could scare you with how much emotion they packed into a movie&quot;.

Barbara Shulgasser of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; called the movie &quot;idiotic&quot; and argued that &quot;Woo is clearly an imaginative man, and there is no doubt that he can concoct six ways to do any given piece of business... a good director would choose the best of the six ways and put it in his movie. Woo puts all six in. If you keep your eyes closed during a Woo movie and open them every six minutes, you&#x27;ll see everything you need to know to have a perfectly lovely evening at the cinema.&quot;
The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing (Mark Stoeckinger and Per Hallberg) at the 70th Academy Awards, but lost to another Paramount film &quot;Titanic&quot;. &quot;Face/Off&quot; also won Saturn Awards for Best Director and Best Writing, and the MTV Movie Awards for Best Action Sequence (the speedboat chase) and Best On-Screen Duo for Travolta and Cage.

It has been labelled as part of the &quot;holy trinity&quot; of Nicolas Cage action films, along with &quot;Con Air&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Rock&quot; (1996). In 2022, Cage said the film had &quot;aged beautifully&quot;.

&quot;Face/Off&quot; is said to have inspired &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;. However, &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; director Andrew Lau wanted to have a more realistic situation; instead of a physical face change, Lau wanted to have the characters swap identities. The concept of &quot;bian lian&quot; or &quot;change face&quot;, a technique traditionally used in Chinese opera, may have been used here to depict the fluid and seamless morph of Chen and Lau&#x27;s characters&#x27; identities between the &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; sides. &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; in turn has spawned several adaptations, notably &quot;The Departed&quot; directed by Martin Scorsese, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

==Sequel==
Paramount Pictures announced in September 2019 plans to remake &quot;Face/Off&quot; with a new cast. David Permut would be executive producer, with Neal Moritz to produce and Oren Uziel to write. In February 2021, it was reported that Adam Wingard would direct and the film would be a sequel to the first film.

<doc id="648923" wikidata="Q1111312" url="?curid=648923" title="Colorado National Monument">
<text>Colorado National Monument is a National Park Service unit near the city of Grand Junction, Colorado. Sheer-walled canyons cut deep into sandstone and granite–gneiss–schist rock formations. This is an area of desert land high on the Colorado Plateau, with pinyon and juniper forests on the plateau. The park hosts a wide range of wildlife, including red-tailed hawks, golden eagles, ravens, jays, desert bighorn sheep, and coyotes. Activities include hiking, horseback riding, road bicycling, and scenic drives; a visitor center on the west side contains a natural history museum and gift shop. There are scenic views from trails, Rim Rock Drive, which winds along the plateau, and the campground. Nearby are the Book Cliffs and the largest flat-topped mountain in the world, the Grand Mesa.

The monument&#x27;s feature attraction is &quot;Monument Canyon&quot;, which runs the width of the park and includes rock formations such as Independence Monument, the Kissing Couple, and Coke Ovens. The monument includes , much of which has been recommended to Congress for designation as wilderness.

==Park history==
The area was first explored by John Otto, who settled in Grand Junction in the early 20th century. Prior to Otto&#x27;s arrival, many area residents believed the canyons to be inaccessible to humans. Otto began building trails on the plateau and into the canyons. As word spread about his work, the Chamber of Commerce of Grand Junction sent a delegation to investigate. The delegation returned praising both Otto&#x27;s work and the scenic beauty of the wilderness area, and the local newspaper began lobbying to make it a National Park. A bill was introduced and carried by the local Representatives to the U.S. Congress and Senate but a Congressional slowdown in the final months threatened the process. To ensure protection of the canyons President William Howard Taft (who had visited the area) stepped in and used the highest powers available to him via the Antiquities Act and presidential proclamation to declare the canyons as a national monument.
The area was established as Colorado National Monument on May 24, 1911. Otto was hired as the first park ranger, drawing a salary of $1 per month. For the next 16 years, he continued building and maintaining trails while living in a tent in the park.

A herd of bison was introduced and maintained from 1925 to 1983. After a failed effort to introduce elk, Otto obtained two cows and one bull. The herd grew to as many as 45 animals, but generally the herd was kept at about 20-25 animals.

The park became more well known in the 1980s partly due to its inclusion as a stage of the major international bicycle race, the Coors Classic. The race through the park became known as &quot;The Tour of the Moon&quot;, due to the spectacular landscapes the race passed through on Rim Rock Drive.

The issue of national park status has arisen time and again, usually during bust cycles brought on by the uranium industry and later oil and gas. As of June, 2014 Congressman Scott Tipton and Senator Mark Udall have carried the process closer to fruition than any other representatives since the initial effort in 1907. The two Representatives appointed an 18-member committee of locals to study the issue and learn the facts in 2011. After a groundswell of support from local residents and business owners, the Representatives then appointed a committee of five local residents to write draft legislation. The draft legislation was announced and released in early 2014. A public comment period on the draft legislation began soon after with an end date of June 29. Documentary producer Ken Burns (&quot;National Parks: America&#x27;s Best Idea&quot;) weighed in of the effort, endorsing national park status for the Colorado National Monument. Burns compared the area to Seward, Alaska, which overcame opposition to create Kenai Fjords National Park. Burns said Seward locals came to refer to Kenai Fjords National Park as a &quot;permanent pipeline&quot;.

==Climate==
Ecologically, Colorado National Monument sits on a large area of high desert in Western Colorado, though under the Köppen climate classification, it, like neighbouring Grand Junction, is temperate semi-arid. Summers are hot and dry while winters cold with some snow. Temperatures reach on 6.0 days, on 62.3 days, and remain at or below freezing on 12.9 days annually.

==Trails==
The Monument contains many hiking trails, with lengths and difficulties to suit all tastes. Summer storms can cause flash floods as well as dangerous trail conditions. Rattlesnakes are found on the Monument, and rough terrain exists everywhere, but most trails are well-maintained. Winter cross-country skiing is occasionally possible on trails such as the Liberty Cap Trail.

Serpents Trail, perhaps the most popular, follows the route of the original road to the top of the Monument. This trail is accessible by parking lots at both ends, both located off Rim Rock Drive. Serpents Trail provides views of both the Monument itself and the Grand Valley below. One of the shortest trails, also popular, is Devil&#x27;s Kitchen. The trailhead is located near the eastern entrance of the park on Rim Rock Drive. This trail is about 1 mile long, and ends in a sandstone grotto.

Liberty Cap trail starts from the valley floor and climbs to the rim of the Monument. Liberty Cap itself is an ancient sand dune, and provides a beautiful view of the Grand Valley. Corkscrew Trail, closed for many years but reopened in mid-2006, branches off the Liberty Cap and skirts a small canyon and cliffs that cannot be seen from the valley floor. This trail, the only loop trail on the Monument, is about 3 miles long and features a less rigorous climb than Liberty Cap.

Monument Canyon trail follows Monument Canyon for about 5 miles. This trail is often hiked up-and-back, and provides close-up views of Independence Monument, the Colorado National Monument&#x27;s most distinct feature, as well as a formation named Kissing Couple. The lower trailhead is accessible from CO 340 (Broadway).

No Thoroughfare Trail starts at the bottom of No Thoroughfare Canyon, near the east entrance. As the name implies, there is no official trail to the top of this canyon. The dead-end trail goes a few miles into the canyon, and up-and-back hiking is required. Some hikers have found a way to get through the entire canyon, but after a certain point the trail becomes difficult and unmarked. No Thoroughfare Canyon does have small waterfalls during the spring runoff, but is dry for most of the year.

Colorado National Monument was rated in 2017 as the best campsite in Colorado in a 50-state survey conducted by Msn.com.

==Historic preservation==
Many of the early visitor facilities at Colorado National Monument were designed by the National Park Service and constructed by the Public Works Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps. Several of these areas have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of this and in consequence of their adherence to the National Park Service Rustic design standards of the time. The entire Rim Rock Drive is a National Historic District, as well as the Serpents Trail, the Devils Kitchen Picnic Shelter, and three places in the Saddlehorn area: the Saddlehorn Caretaker&#x27;s House and Garage, Saddlehorn Comfort Station, and the Saddlehorn Utility Area Historic District. The Visitor Center complex is also included as an example of the Mission 66 program.

==Geology==
The park&#x27;s geologic record preserves three different groups of rock and sediment. The oldest rocks are Early to Middle Proterozoic gneiss and schist, including the Ute Canyon Stock. Overlying these, and separated by an angular unconformity, are mostly horizontally bedded Mesozoic sedimentary rocks, including the cliff-forming Wingate Sandstone. Overlying these are various types of Quaternary unconsolidated deposits such as alluvium, colluvium, and dunes. The sedimentary rocks are folded into monoclines by several faults, including the Redlands Thrust Fault.

<text>LS-DYNA is an advanced general-purpose multiphysics simulation software package developed by the former Livermore Software Technology Corporation (LSTC), which was acquired by Ansys in 2019. While the package continues to contain more and more possibilities for the calculation of many complex, real world problems, its origins and core-competency lie in highly nonlinear transient dynamic finite element analysis (FEA) using explicit time integration. LS-DYNA is used by the automobile, aerospace, construction and civil engineering, military, manufacturing, and bioengineering industries.

== History ==

LS-DYNA originated from the 3D FEA program DYNA3D, developed by Dr. John O. Hallquist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in 1976. DYNA3D was created in order to simulate the impact of the Full Fuzing Option (FUFO) or &quot;Dial-a-yield&quot; nuclear bomb for low altitude release (impact velocity of ~ 40 m/s). At the time, no 3D software was available for simulating impact, and 2D software was inadequate. Though the FUFO bomb was eventually canceled, development of DYNA3D continued. DYNA3D used explicit time integration to study nonlinear dynamic problems, with the original applications being mostly stress analysis of structures undergoing various types of impacts. The program was initially very simple largely due to the lack of adequate computational resources at the time. A two-dimensional version of the same software was developed concurrently. In 1978 the DYNA3D source code was released into the public domain without restrictions after a request from France.

In 1979 a new version of DYNA3D was released which was programmed for optimal performance on the CRAY-1 supercomputers. This new release contained improved sliding interface treatment which was an order of magnitude faster than the previous contact treatment. This version also eliminated structural and higher order solid elements of the first version, while including element-wise integration of the integral difference method developed in 1974.

The 1982 release included nine additional material models which allowed for new simulations, such as explosive-structure and soil-structure interactions. The release also permitted the analysis of structural response due to penetrating projectiles. Improvements in 1982 further boosted the execution speed by about 10 percent. Hallquist was the sole developer of DYNA3D until 1984, when he was joined by Dr. David J. Benson. In 1986, many capabilities were added. The added features included beams, shells, rigid bodies, single surface contact, interface friction, discrete springs and dampers, optional hourglass treatments, optional exact volume integration, and VAX/VMS, IBM, UNIX, COS operating system compatibility. At this point, DYNA3D became the first code to have a general single surface contact algorithm.

Metal forming simulation and composite analysis capabilities were added to DYNA3D in 1987. This version included changes to the shell elements, and dynamic relaxation. The final release of DYNA3D in 1988 included several more elements and capabilities.

By 1988 LLNL had sent approximately 600 tapes containing simulation software. Hallquist had consulted for nearly 60 companies and organizations on the use of DYNA3D. As a result, at the end of 1988 Livermore Software Technology Corporation (LSTC) was founded to continue the development of DYNA3D in a much more focused manner, resulting in LS-DYNA3D (later shortened to LS-DYNA). Releases and support for DYNA3D were thus halted. Since then, LSTC has greatly expanded the capabilities of LS-DYNA in an attempt to create a universal tool for most simulation needs.

In 2019, LSTC was acquired by Ansys, Inc.

== Typical uses ==

Nonlinear means at least one (and sometimes all) of the following complications:
* Changing boundary conditions (such as contact between parts that changes over time)
* Large deformations (for example the crumpling of sheet metal parts)
* Nonlinear materials that do not exhibit ideally elastic behavior (for example thermoplastic polymers)

Transient dynamic means analyzing high speed, short duration events where inertial forces are important. Typical uses include:
* Automotive crash (deformation of chassis, airbag inflation, seatbelt tensioning, ...)
* Explosions (underwater mines, shaped charges, ...)
* Manufacturing (sheet metal stamping, ...)

== Characteristics ==

LS-DYNA consists of a single executable file and is entirely command-line driven. Therefore, all that is required to run LS-DYNA (besides some licensing infrastructure) is a command shell, the appropriate executable for the computer&#x27;s architecture, an input file, and enough free disk space to store the results.
Input files use a simple ASCII format and thus can be prepared using any text editor. Many third-party simulation environments integrate some LS-DYNA preprocessing capabilities. LSTC also develops its own preprocessor, LS-PrePost, which is freely distributed, runs without a license, and can also be used for viewing and postprocessing simulation results.
Licensees of LS-DYNA automatically have access to all of the program&#x27;s capabilities, from simple linear static mechanical analysis up to advanced thermal and flow solving methods. Furthermore, they have full use of LSTC&#x27;s LS-OPT software, a standalone design optimization and probabilistic analysis package with an interface to LS-DYNA.

=== Capabilities ===

LS-DYNA&#x27;s potential applications are numerous and can be used in many fields. LS-DYNA is not limited to any particular type of simulation. In a given simulation, any of LS-DYNA&#x27;s many features can be combined to model a wide variety of physical events.
However the main strength of the software lies in highly nonlinear simulations of high-speed events, preferably involving the deformation of sheet metal. (For example a car crashing into a traffic barrier.) Several variants of algorithms and multiphysics expansions were added to use these core capabilities in special fields. (For example the deep drawing of steel sheets by electromagnetic forces or by explosives.)

One example of a simulation that involved a unique combination of several features is the NASA JPL Mars Pathfinder landing, which simulated the gas and fabric of inflating airbags around the spaceship, and the subsequent impact and bouncing of the assembly on the martian soil.

<doc id="648931" wikidata="Q16938327" url="?curid=648931" title="Pre-engagement ring">
<text>A pre-engagement ring, sometimes referred to as a friendship ring or promise ring, is a ring given as a gift to a romantic partner to signify a commitment to a monogamous relationship, often as a precursor to an engagement ring. A heterosexual couple typically has the man presenting a ring or both exchanging rings, though women may present one as well. They may be worn on any finger due to not being as serious as an engagement ring, though they are sometimes worn on a necklace. These rings are typically purchased by those who are too young to get engaged to their partner or by a partner or partners who do not want to rush into marriage. While similar concepts have been employed in the past, the concept of pre-engagement rings came into prominence starting in the 1970s. It gained further prominence in the late 2000s when celebrities began to use pre-engagement rings (as well as purity rings) such as the Jonas Brothers, Selena Gomez, and Priyanka Chopra.

==Appearance==
Designs of pre-engagement rings may vary, featuring hearts, an entangled design, and other designs. However, any design can be used for a pre-engagement ring. The bands may be made of a variety of materials, including titanium, silver, and gold. Less common inexpensive materials may be used, such as wood, glass, ceramic, bone, plastic, jade, quartz or any other type of gemstone band ring. Birthstones are also commonly used. The ring or rings may be engraved with one or both of the names of those in the relationship, and potentially their nickname(s).

==Custom==
A pre-engagement ring, sometimes referred to as a friendship ring or promise ring, is given to a romantic partner as a show of a commitment to a monogamous relationship as a precursor to an engagement ring. It is advised to be given only after about six months to a year of a relationship. In a heterosexual couple, the man is typically the one to give the ring, though it is not uncommon for the woman to give as well. Some couples may also exchange pre-engagement rings. They can be worn on any finger, but those symbolizing pre-engagement rings are generally worn on the left ring finger. When a person gets married, if they still have their pre-engagement ring, they may switch the ring to their right ring finger. Because it is not an official engagement, the ring may be worn on any finger. It is also not uncommon for someone to wear a pre-engagement ring on a necklace. They are considered more of a fashion accessory than an engagement or wedding ring are. Costs for pre-engagement rings are almost always cheaper than an engagement ring due to the lower commitment and age of the giver and recipient. Pre-engagement rings are often worn by people who are too young to actually get engaged but want to commit to their relationship. However, they may also be used by couples who do not wish to rush into marriage.

Pre-engagement rings are common in Brazil, and are sometimes worn by couples while they are dating. It is called a commitment ring (or anel de compromisso).

==History==

Similar concepts to pre-engagement rings have appeared at various points in history. One such example is posie rings, which were engraved with romantic poems in 16th century England. Another example were acrostic rings, which spelled out a word in gemstones such as &quot;regard&quot; using a ruby, emerald, garnet, amethyst, another ruby, and a diamond. Claddagh rings are another similar kind of ring. The term &#x27;promise ring&#x27; entered the &quot;jewelry dictionary&quot; in the 1970s.

==Impact==
Pre-engagement rings entered prominence in the late 2000s and early 2010s. One of the reasons for the increased prominence is the use by celebrities, including the Jonas Brothers, Jordin Sparks, Teyana Taylor, and Selena Gomez. Some companies have made franchise-branded pre-engagement rings, such as Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;-branded promise rings. The rings feature Belle and &#x27;Her Beast&#x27; on the boy&#x27;s ring and Beast and &#x27;His Beauty&#x27; on the girl&#x27;s.

Writer Nicole Fabian-Weber mocked the concept of pre-engagement rings in an article about Justin Bieber&#x27;s gift of a pre-engagement ring to then-girlfriend Selena Gomez. Writer Pascale Day expressed bemusement at the idea of a pre-engagement ring. She expressed confusion as to what it was and commented that &#x27;pre-engagement&#x27; is just &quot;being in a relationship.&quot; Writer Ana Gabriela Verotti Farah commented that due to the relative newness of the custom in Brazil in 2003, it resulted in trivialization by couples, especially young ones.&#x27;

<doc id="648940" wikidata="Q2395085" url="?curid=648940" title="Easter Offensive">
<text>The Easter Offensive, also known as the 1972 spring–summer offensive (&#x27;) by North Vietnam, or theRed Fiery Summer(&#x27;) as romanticized in South Vietnamese literature, was a military campaign conducted by the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN, the regular army of communist North Vietnam) against the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN, the regular army of South Vietnam) and the United States military between 30 March and 22 October 1972, during the Vietnam War.

This conventional invasion (the largest invasion since 300,000 Chinese troops had crossed the Yalu River into North Korea during the Korean War) was a radical departure from previous North Vietnamese offensives. The offensive was designed to achieve a decisive victory, which even if it did not lead to the collapse of South Vietnam, would greatly improve the North&#x27;s negotiating position at the Paris Peace Accords.

The U.S. high command had been expecting an attack in 1972 but the size and ferocity of the assault caught the defenders off balance, because the attackers struck on three fronts simultaneously, with the bulk of the PAVN. This first attempt by North Vietnam to invade the south since the Tet Offensive of 1968, became characterized by conventional infantry–armor assaults backed by heavy artillery, with both sides fielding the latest in technological advances in weapons systems.

In the I Corps Tactical Zone, North Vietnamese forces overran the ARVN’s defensive positions in a month-long battle and captured Quảng Trị city, before moving south in an attempt to seize Huế. The PAVN similarly eliminated frontier defense forces in the II Corps Tactical Zone and advanced towards the provincial capital of Kon Tum, threatening to open a way to the sea, which would have split South Vietnam in two. Northeast of Saigon, in the III Corps Tactical Zone, PAVN forces overran Lộc Ninh and advanced to assault the capital of Bình Long Province at An Lộc.

The campaign can be divided into three phases: April was a month of PAVN advances; May became a period of equilibrium; in June and July the South Vietnamese forces counter-attacked, culminating in the recapture of Quảng Trị City in September. On all three fronts, initial North Vietnamese successes were hampered by high casualties, lack of fuel and the increasing application of U.S. and South Vietnamese air power. One result of the offensive was the launching of Operation Linebacker, the first sustained bombing of North Vietnam by the U.S. since November 1968. Although South Vietnamese forces withstood their greatest trial thus far in the conflict, as well as thwarting North Vietnam&#x27;s goal of large territorial gains, the North Vietnamese accomplished two important goals: they had gained valuable territory within South Vietnam from which to launch future offensives and they had obtained a better bargaining position at the peace negotiations being conducted in Paris.

Despite repulsing the PAVN offensive, the ARVN victory was ultimately achieved with massive us air support, continueing its dependence on US firepower.

==Background==

===Planning===

In the wake of the failed South Vietnamese Operation Lam Son 719, the Hanoi leadership began discussing a possible offensive during the 19th Plenum of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers&#x27; Party in early 1971. Convinced that they had destroyed South Vietnam&#x27;s best units during Lam Son 719, by December, the Politburo had decided to launch a major offensive early in the following year. 1972 would be a U.S. presidential election year, and the possibility of affecting the outcome was enticing and there was increasing anti-war sentiment among the population and government of the U.S. With American troop withdrawals, South Vietnamese forces were stretched to breaking point along a border of more than and the poor performance of ARVN troops in the offensive into Laos promised an easy victory.

This decision marked the end of three years of political infighting between two factions within the Politburo: those members grouped around Trường Chinh, who favored following the Chinese model of continued low-intensity guerrilla warfare and rebuilding the north, and the &quot;southern firsters&quot; around Defense Minister Võ Nguyên Giáp, supported by First Party Secretary Lê Duẩn (both of whom supported the Soviet model of big offensives). The failure of the Tet Offensive of 1968 had led to a downgrading of Giáp&#x27;s influence, but the victory achieved over South Vietnamese forces during the Laotian incursion brought Giáp&#x27;s strategy back into the ascendant. Lê Duẩn was given responsibility for planning the operation but Giáp never rose to his former prominence, dealing chiefly with logistical matters and the approval of operational planning. The officer entrusted with the conduct of the offensive was the PAVN chief of staff, General Văn Tiến Dũng.

The central questions then became where and with what forces the offensive would be launched and what its goals were to be. North Vietnam had used the border regions of Laos and Cambodia as supply and manpower conduits for a decade and a demilitarized zone (DMZ) that separated the two Vietnams. There, the line of communication would be shortest and forces could be concentrated where &quot;the enemy is weakest...violent attacks will disintegrate enemy forces...making it impossible for him to have enough troops to deploy elsewhere.&quot; This was an important consideration, since the northern thrust would serve to divert South Vietnamese attention and resources, while two other attacks were to be launched: one into the Central Highlands, to cut the country in two and another eastwards from Cambodia to threaten Saigon.
The offensive was given a title steeped in Vietnamese history. In 1773, the three Tây Sơn brothers (so-called because of the place of their origin) united a Vietnam divided by civil war and social unrest. The youngest brother, Nguyễn Huệ, then defeated an invading Chinese army on the outskirts of Hanoi in 1788.

The campaign eventually employed the equivalent of 14 divisions. There was the distinct possibility of destroying or at least crippling large elements of the ARVN; possibly deposing of South Vietnamese President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu; convincing the U.S. as to the hopelessness of continued support to the South and demonstrating the failure of Vietnamization. The prospect of seizing a South Vietnamese provincial capital, which could then be proclaimed as the seat of the Provisional Revolutionary Government, was also enticing. The attitude of the North Vietnamese leadership was illustrated in an article in a 1972 party journal: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter whether the war is promptly ended or prolonged...Both are opportunities to sow the seeds; all we have to do is to wait for the time to harvest the crop.&quot;

The northern leadership was taken aback during the summer of 1971, when an announcement was made that U.S. President Richard Nixon would visit the People&#x27;s Republic of China, on a diplomatic mission before May 1972. The Chinese placated the suspicions of their ally, by reassuring North Vietnam that even more military and economic aid would be forthcoming in 1972. The Soviet Union, perceiving the growing antagonism between the People&#x27;s Republic and North Vietnam, sought to widen the rift by also agreeing to &quot;additional aid without reimbursement&quot;, for North Vietnam&#x27;s military forces.

These agreements led to a flood of equipment and supplies necessary for a modern, conventional army. This included 400 T-34, T-54 and Type 59 (a Chinese version of the T-54) medium and 200 PT-76 light amphibious tanks, hundreds of anti-aircraft missiles, including the shoulder-fired, heat-seeking SA-7 Strela (called the Grail in the West), anti-tank missiles, including the wire-guided AT-3 Sagger and heavy-caliber, long-range artillery. To man the new equipment, 25,000 North Vietnamese troops received specialized training abroad, 80 percent of them in the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe. A contingent of high-level Soviet military personnel also arrived in Vietnam and stayed until March 1972 in preparation for the offensive.

===Miscalculation===
During late 1971, U.S. and South Vietnamese intelligence estimates of communist intentions were mixed. An offensive was expected, but intelligence as to its timing, location, and size were confusing. The communists had mounted the Tet Offensive in 1968, but it had been conducted mainly by Vietcong (VC) in the initial phase, which had been destroyed in the process. Without VC support, a large-scale PAVN offensive was considered highly unlikely. A PAVN thrust across the DMZ was also considered unlikely. Past infiltration and offensive operations had been conducted through and from Laotian and Cambodian territory and a DMZ offensive would be a blatant violation of the Geneva Agreement, which North Vietnam was adamant in defending.

In December, intelligence became conclusive that PAVN units supporting Khmer Rouge operations in Cambodia began returning to the border areas. In Laos and Cambodia, there was also an unusual expansion of infiltration. In North Vietnam, there was a noticeable increase in military recruitment. In January, Defense Intelligence Agency officers briefed Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird to state that PAVN would attack after the Tết holidays and that the offensive would involve the widespread use of armored forces. Laird was unconvinced and told the U.S. Congress in late January that a large communist offensive &quot;was not a serious possibility&quot;

U.S. and South Vietnamese intelligence services had no consensus as to communist intentions, but Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), was suspicious and sent several reconnaissance teams into the Mụ Giạ and Ban Karai Pass areas and discovered a buildup of PAVN forces and equipment. MACV then decided that the North Vietnamese were preparing for an offensive in the central highlands and the northern provinces of South Vietnam. The brunt of an attack would be borne by South Vietnamese forces since the U.S. strength had been reduced to 69,000 troops, most of whom were in support roles and the number was to be reduced to 27,000 by 30 November.

The U.S. commander, General Creighton W. Abrams, was convinced an offensive was likely but was also convinced that the attack would begin during or near the Tết holidays, at the beginning of the year. He notified Admiral Thomas Moorer, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that the North Vietnamese might attempt to &quot;duplicate the effects of the 1968 offensive, perhaps by a limited operation aimed less at inflicting defeat on the battlefield than in influencing American public opinion.&quot; The consensus at MACV was that such an offensive would be launched against II Corps, in the Central Highlands. When the offensive did not occur, he and his headquarters were ridiculed in the American press for crying wolf. The moment of crisis seemed to have passed, and by the end of March, allied forces that had been standing by had returned to pacification efforts. U.S. Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker left for Nepal, and General Abrams went to Thailand to spend the Easter holiday with his family.
The ARVN units upon which the initial North Vietnamese attack was to fall included the 1st and 3rd Divisions in Quảng Trị and Thừa Thiên Provinces and the 2nd Division, further south. The force was supplemented by two brigades of Marines (the 147th and 258th), the 51st Infantry Regiment, the 1st Ranger Group and Regional and Popular Forces, approximately 30,000 men. The units were in static defensive positions and lacked adequate mobile reserves.

Bearing the initial brunt of the attack would be the 3rd Division, which had been created in October 1971 and was located in an arc of outposts near the DMZ, to replace departing American troops. To create the new unit, the 1st Division (arguably ARVN&#x27;s best unit) was stripped of its 2nd Regiment and the 11th Armored Cavalry was brought up from the I Corps reserve. Both units were experienced, well-trained, well-equipped, and well-led. The 3rd Division&#x27;s other two regiments, the 56th and 57th were made up of recaptured deserters, men released from jail, and regional and provincial forces. It was led by cast-off officers and sergeants from other units. Like other ARVN units at this stage of the conflict, the division suffered from a dearth of American advisors, who then served only at regimental, brigade, and divisional headquarters.

Because of the general belief that the North Vietnamese would not violate the sacrosanct boundary, the unit was stationed in the relatively &quot;safe&quot; area directly below the DMZ. The division was commanded by newly promoted Brigadier General Vũ Văn Giai, the former deputy commander of the 1st Division. The I Corps commander, Lieutenant General Hoàng Xuân Lãm, was an officer who epitomized the indecision and the ineffectiveness of Saigon&#x27;s command structure, as had been discovered all too blatantly during Operation Lam Son 719. Lãm concentrated on administrative matters and left tactical decisions to his subordinate commanders. Considering the circumstances, that was a workable solution only as long as his division commanders encountered no major difficulties.

U.S. intelligence had been squabbling over a possible PAVN attack across the DMZ attack during the months preceding the offensive. DIA analysts &quot;cautiously&quot; predicted such a contingency, but the CIA downplayed the possibility. General Lãm&#x27;s American advisors agreed with his assessment that a blatant North Vietnamese violation of the Geneva Accord was unlikely.

When the weekend of Easter 1972 arrived, General Giai had planned to rotate the operational areas of his 56th Regiment (along the central DMZ) with the 2nd Regiment (around the artillery base at Camp Carroll in the west). Because of a truck shortage, the units were moved simultaneously and became hopelessly intermixed and disorganized. At 11:30 on 30 March, both unit headquarters shut down their radios, for the exchange of operational areas. With communications fragmented, its units entangled, and the weather bad enough to prevent aerial operations, the 3rd Division offered the massed PAVN forces to the north an irresistible target.

==Offensive==

===I Corps – Quảng Trị===
The offensive began at noon on 30 March 1972, when an intense artillery barrage rained down on the northernmost ARVN outposts in Quảng Trị Province.

Two PAVN divisions (the 304th and 308th – approximately 30,000 troops) supported by more than 100 tanks (in 2 Regiments) then rolled over the Demilitarized Zone to attack I Corps, the five northernmost provinces of South Vietnam. The North Vietnamese 308th Division and two independent regiments assaulted the &quot;ring of steel&quot;, the arc of ARVN firebases just south of the DMZ.

From the west, the 312th, including an armoured regiment, moved out of Laos along Route 9, past Khe Sanh, and into the Quảng Trị River Valley. Significantly, allied intelligence had failed to predict both the scale of the offensive and the method of attack, giving PAVN &quot;the inestimable benefit of shock effect, a crucial psychological edge over defenders who had expected something quite different.&quot;
On 1 April, South Vietnamese General Giai, ordered a withdrawal of the 3rd Division south of the Cửa Việt/Thach Han River in order for his troops to reorganize. The following morning, ARVN armoured elements held off a PAVN offensive briefly when the crucial Highway QL-1 bridge over the Cửa Việt River at Đông Hà was blown up by Capt. John Ripley, adviser to the 3rd Vietnamese Marine Battalion. The initial PAVN units were then joined by the 320B and 325C Divisions.

Simultaneously, the 324B Division moved out of the A Sầu Valley and advanced directly eastward toward Fire Bases Bastogne and Checkmate, which protected the old imperial capital of Huế from the west.

The North Vietnamese advance had been timed to coincide with the seasonal monsoon, whose cloud ceilings negated many U.S. airstrikes. PAVN advance elements were soon followed by anti-aircraft units armed with new ZSU-57-2 tracked weapon platforms and man-portable, shoulder-fired Grail missiles, which made low-level bombing attacks hazardous.

Camp Carroll, an artillery firebase halfway between the Laotian border and the coast, was the linchpin of the South Vietnamese northern and western defense line and was the strongest obstacle to the North Vietnamese before Quảng Trị City. The camp was cut off and surrounded. On 2 April, Colonel Pham Van Dinh, commander of the 56th ARVN Regiment, surrendered the camp and his 1,500 troops. Later in the day, ARVN troops abandoned Mai Loc, the last western base. This allowed North Vietnamese forces to cross the Cam Lộ bridge, 11 kilometers to the west of Đông Hà. PAVN then had almost unrestricted access to western Quảng Trị Province north of the Thạch Hãn River.
On 21 April, Abrams notified the U.S. Secretary of Defense that

In summary...the pressure is mounting and the battle has become brutal...the senior military leadership has begun to bend and in some cases to break. In adversity, it is losing its will and cannot be depended upon to take the measures necessary to stand and fight.

The PAVN advance was slowed by delaying actions for three weeks, and the South Vietnamese launched several counterattacks, but on the morning of 27 April, the North Vietnamese came on again, launching multi-pronged attacks against Đông Hà (which fell on the following day) and advancing to within 1.5 kilometers of Quảng Trị City. General Giai had planned a staged withdrawal from the city to consolidate south of the Thạch Hãn, but bewildered by conflicting orders from Lãm and Giai, most ARVN formations splintered and then collapsed, conceding most of the province north of the city.

On 29 April, Giai ordered a general retreat to the Mỹ Chánh River, thirteen kilometers to the south. U.S. military advisors in Quảng Trị called for emergency helicopter extraction and, on 1 May 132 survivors were evacuated from Quảng Trị, including 80 U.S. soldiers.

The exodus of ARVN forces was joined by tens of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians fleeing from the fighting. As the mass of humanity jostled and shoved its way south on Highway 1, it presented an inviting target for North Vietnamese artillerists. They were soon joined by PAVN infantry, who moved by the flank to attack the column. ARVN units, with no leadership and all unit cohesion gone, could muster no defense. Meanwhile, to the west, Fire Support Bases Bastogne and Checkmate had fallen after staunch ARVN defense and massive B-52 bomber strikes, which inflicted heavy casualties.

Giai evacuated the last of his forces from Quảng Trị City, which fell to PAVN forces on 2 May. That same day General Lam was summoned to Saigon for a meeting with President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. He was relieved of command of I Corps and replaced by Lieutenant General Ngô Quang Trưởng, commander of IV Corps. Trưởng&#x27;s mission was to defend Huế, minimize further losses, and retake captured territory. Although saddled with raw troops and constantly countermanded by his superiors, General Giai had conducted a reasonably good defense. Even Trưởng pleaded his case with Thiệu, wanting to keep Giai in command of the 3rd Division. It was in vain. Giai, who was to be made the scapegoat for the collapse, was tried for &quot;desertion in the face of the enemy&quot;, and sentenced to five years in prison.

===I Corps – Huế===

Hoping to break the stalemate that was developing on the northern front, Lieutenant General Trần Văn Quang, commander of the B-4 Front, attacked on 1 April west from the A Shau Valley toward Huế with the 324B Division. Spoiling attacks by the ARVN 1st Division, however, threw off the timetable.

On 28 April 29 and 803rd PAVN Regiments seized Firebase Bastogne, the strongest anchor on Huế&#x27;s western flank. This made Firebase Checkmate untenable, and it too was evacuated that night. This exposed Huế to a direct thrust along Route 547. On 2 May PAVN forces south of Huế tried to surround the city.
The PAVN also attempted to press their attack southward down Highway 1 and across the Mỹ Chánh River to Huế, but, fortunately for the South Vietnamese, after Trưởng took command, the 1st and Marine Divisions were reinforced by the 2nd and 3rd Brigades of the Airborne Division (which now totaled three brigades), and the reorganized 1st Ranger Group, raising the ARVN manpower total to 35,000. Also fortuitous was a one-week clearing of the weather, which allowed the application of massive U.S. bombing.

The PAVN advance was halted on 5 May at the Mỹ Chánh Line.

===I Corps – Counteroffensive===

By mid-May, Trưởng felt strong enough to go on the offensive in a series of limited attacks, feints, and raids codenamed &quot;Song Than&quot; (Tsunami) that were planned to throw the North Vietnamese off balance, enlarge the defensive perimeter around Huế, and deny the enemy time and space to maneuver. Between 15 and 20 May, Firebases Bastogne and Checkmate were recaptured.

PAVN forces then launched another attempt to take the city on 21 May, losing 18 tanks and approximately 800 men in the process.

On 25 May a second North Vietnamese assault managed to cross the My Chanh River, but ARVN defenders put up ferocious resistance, forcing their enemy back across on 29 May. This was the last serious assault on the defenses of Huế. Major General Frederick J. Kroesen, senior U.S. advisor in I Corps, believed that the fall of Quảng Trị should have heralded the fall of Huế, but the North Vietnamese did not exploit their opportunity quickly enough. &quot;That he failed completely to take advantage of the moment must be classed as another great blunder of the Quảng Trị campaign.&quot;

By mid-June, clearing weather allowed more accurate aerial bombardment and shelling from U.S. warships offshore. On the 14th, Trưởng briefed President Thiệu and MACV on his planned counterattack to retake Quảng Trị Province. Thiệu was not convinced, preferring a smaller-scale operation. The persistent Trưởng finally convinced the president, emphasizing that such an effort would be possible &quot;employing the superior firepower of our American ally.&quot; Thiệu finally approved the concept.

Trưởng launched Operation &quot;Lam Son 72&quot; on 28 June.

The 1st Division continued its westward push toward Laos while the Airborne and Marine Divisions, the 1st Ranger Group, and the 7th Armored Cavalry moved north to retake Quảng Trị. The Airborne Division led the way and, utilizing airmobile end-runs and the North Vietnamese were slowly levered out of their defensive positions. The division then advanced to the outskirts of Quảng Trị City within ten days, but then President Thieu intervened in the operation. Trưởng had planned to bypass the city and push on quickly to the Cua Viet River, thereby isolating any PAVN defenders. Thiệu, however, now demanded that Quảng Trị be taken immediately, seeing the city as &quot;a symbol and a challenge&quot; to his authority.

It was not going to be an easy task for General Trưởng. The ARVN assault bogged down in the outskirts and the North Vietnamese, apprised of the plans for the offensive, moved the 304th and 308th Divisions to the west to avoid the U.S. airpower that was about to be unleashed upon Quảng Trị.

The defense of the city and its walled citadel was left to PAVN replacement units and militia. One participant recalled : &quot;The new recruits came in at dusk. They were dead by dawn... No one had time to check where they were from, or who was their commander.&quot; Others described the defense as a &quot;senseless sacrifice&quot; and referred to Quảng Trị as &quot;Hamburger City&quot;. Nevertheless, the PAVN units stationed within the citadel were well dug in, had the advantage of terrain and mass artillery support. An ARVN early victory was denied, and the fighting continued unabated.

On 11 July, the ARVN Airborne Division and South Vietnamese Marines launched a heli-borne assault supported by U.S. Marine helicopter squadrons HMM-164, HMM-165 and U.S. Army&#x27;s Troop F, 4th Cavalry north and east of the city which would cut the last remaining road and force the PAVN to reinforce and resupply across the Thach Han River, making them vulnerable to air strikes. After a vicious, three-day battle against the 48th Regiment of the 320B PAVN Division broke and withdrew.

On 27 July, the ARVN Marine Division was ordered to relieve the Airborne units as the lead element in the battle. But progress was slow, consisting of vicious house-to-house fighting and incessant artillery barrages by both sides. In September, the final assault to capture the heavily defended citadel was launched; it was finally taken on 16 September. Trưởng&#x27;s forces then advanced to the southern bank of the Thach Han River, where they halted, exhausted and depleted by heavy casualties and unable to push on to Đông Hà.

During July, American aircraft flew 5,461 tactical sorties and 2,054 B-52 strikes and operated 5 aircraft carriers to support the counteroffensive.

===III Corps – An Lộc===
The initial wave of the offensive was followed on 5 April by a PAVN advance out of Cambodia into Bình Long Province, northeast of Saigon. Its targets were the towns and airfields at Lộc Ninh, Quần Lợi, and An Lộc. The possible initial goals of the offensive in III Corps remain unclear, but probably began as probes that, if successful, could be easily reinforced.

The invasion was launched from Cambodian Base Area 708 by the B-2 Front&#x27;s 5th PAVN/VC Division and 203rd Armoured Regiment, which advanced down Highway 9 toward the border outpost of Loc Ninh. There, the 2,000 men of the ARVN 9th Regiment and a battalion of Rangers beat back five separate infantry/armor assaults before collapsing under the attack on 7 April. The North Vietnamese then isolated the 25th Division in neighboring Tây Ninh Province by sending two regiments to attack its forward outposts.

Sensing that the provincial capital of An Lộc would be the next target, the III Corps commander, Lieutenant General Nguyễn Văn Minh dispatched the 5th Division to hold the town. They were reinforced by two battalions of the Ranger Group (on 7 April) and by two additional infantry battalions (on 10 and 11 April). The 21st Division, which had been stationed in the Mekong Delta, was rushed to Chơn Thành Camp to join a regiment of the 9th Division as a relief force. All forces in the area were placed under the command of Brigadier General Lê Văn Hưng, commander of the 5th Division.
The move was fortuitous for the South Vietnamese, since PAVN forces were indeed proceeding eastward toward An Lộc. Simultaneously, the PAVN 7th Division bypassed the town and moved south along Highway 13 to block any relief effort launched from Chơn Thành. The North Vietnamese had decided that An Lộc, with its close proximity to Saigon, would be proclaimed as the capital of the Provisional Revolutionary Government, but even if they had been able to seize the town, they would never have been able to hold it. American air power would have made such an eventuality impossible.
By 13 April, An Lộc was surrounded and under a combined artillery, armored, and infantry attack by the 9th PAVN/VC Division. PAVN forces advanced on the town through a deluge of rockets, bombs, and napalm delivered by U.S. and South Vietnamese aircraft supported by massed artillery, tank, and small arms fire. Inside the town, the contingent of U.S. advisors became essential to the defense, serving as a separate staff organizing fire and air support, logistics, and intelligence. Colonel William Miller, the senior U.S. advisor, was not happy with General Hung&#x27;s continuous reluctance to launch counterattacks and his reliance on U.S. air power to defeat the North Vietnamese. His hesitation and lack of motivation prompted Miller to report that: &quot;He is tired – unstable – irrational – irritable – inadvisable – and unapproachable.&quot;

The attacks persisted and PAVN forces eventually battered their way into the town, seizing the airfield and reducing the ARVN perimeter to about a square kilometer. During another assault on the 21st, PAVN tanks actually forced their way through the defense perimeter but were held at bay and then destroyed by anti-tank weapons and helicopter gunships. PAVN infantry did, however, manage to seize most of the northern sector of the town, where they began digging in (often right across the street from the ARVN defenders). The initial shock of ARVN troops instilled by North Vietnamese armor was soon abated when they discovered that, because the supporting infantry failed to advance with the tanks, they became easy prey for anti-tank weapons. On other occasions, the opposite would occur, with massed infantry assaults moving forward without armored support. This failure of tactical coordination was one of PAVN&#x27;s prime weaknesses during the offensive, and one that the allies were quick to exploit.

As a result of his failure to seize the town quickly, the commander of the 9th Division was officially reprimanded and local command was handed over the senior officer of the 5th PAVN/VC Division. Besides the lack of coordination, the major difficulty for the PAVN was the rain of ordnance delivered upon them by incessant air strikes, which further reduced manpower and made resupply difficult.

After the failure of the assault on 21 April, the battle devolved into a siege, with the North Vietnamese pounding An Lộc and its defenders with 1,200 to 2,000 mortar, rocket, and artillery rounds per day. An Lộc was completely surrounded and could only be resupplied by air, a situation made more difficult by the loss of the airfield. Resupply was accomplished, however, by 448 aerial missions which managed to deliver 2,693 tons of air-dropped food, medical supplies, and ammunition, supported by the US Army&#x27;s &quot;549th QM (AD/Airborne)&quot; (QuarterMaster, Air Delivery/Airborne) Rigger Company, which had been rapid-deployed from Okinawa in early April.

From 22 April to 10 May, the tactical situation remained stable at what the &quot;Paris Match&quot; was calling &quot;a Verdun or a Stalingrad&quot; in III Corps.

On the morning of 11 May, another PAVN assault was launched after being preceded by an artillery bombardment that fired over 8,300 shells into a defense perimeter that had shrunk to a mere by before the day was over. PAVN forces again forced their way into An Lộc, but the effort collapsed in the face of tremendous aerial attack, which cost the North Vietnamese 40 tanks and over 800 men. The reasons for the failure were not hard to discern. Beginning at 05:30 that morning and continuing for the next 25 hours, the U.S. Air Force delivered a B-52 strike every 55 minutes to support the defense. For the next three days, each time PAVN troops assembled to resume the attack, they were bombed in their assembly areas.

The climactic attack on An Lộc was launched on 14 May, when the North Vietnamese attacked directly into the teeth of the ARVN defense. The failed assault was described by Colonel Walt Ulmer, the 5th Division&#x27;s senior advisor: &quot;they were simply trying to pile on and pile on and pile on. They frittered away an awful lot of manpower.&quot;

A relief effort had been launched by the 21st ARVN Division, but it never arrived at An Lộc. For three weeks the division crept northward along Highway 13 but it was held up by constant delaying actions by smaller PAVN forces. Although the division never reached its goal, it inadvertently supported the beleaguered city by eventually diverting almost all of the elements of the 7th PAVN Division from the fighting.

Although North Vietnamese forces remained in the area and continued to shell An Lộc heavily, the impetus of their offensive was over. By 12 June, the last PAVN forces were driven from the city and its environs and over 1,000 ARVN wounded were evacuated. Slowly, the decimated North Vietnamese units faded away to the north and west as others covered their withdrawal. On 18 June, the headquarters of III Corps declared the siege to be over. The Saigon government claimed that 12,500 South Vietnamese soldiers had been killed or wounded at An Lộc. American sources claimed that 25,000 PAVN or NLF troops had been killed or wounded during the action, although those numbers could never be confirmed.

===II Corps – Kon Tum===

The objective of PAVN forces during the third phase of the &quot;Nguyen Hue Offensive&quot; was to seize the cities of Kon Tum and Pleiku, thereby overrunning the Central Highlands. This would then open the possibility of proceeding east to the coastal plains, splitting South Vietnam in two. The highlands offensive was preceded by VC diversionary operations that opened on 5 April in coastal Bình Định Province, which aimed at closing Highway 1, seizing several ARVN firebases, and diverting South Vietnamese forces from operations further west. North Vietnamese forces, under the command of Lieutenant General Hoàng Minh Thảo, commander of the B-3 Front, included the 320th and 2nd PAVN Divisions in the highlands and the 3rd PAVN Division in the lowlands – approximately 50,000 men.

Arrayed against them in II Corps were the ARVN 22nd and 23rd Divisions, two armored cavalry squadrons, and the 2nd Airborne Brigade, all under the command of Lieutenant General Ngô Du. It had become evident as early as January that the North Vietnamese were building up for offensive operations in the tri-border region and numerous B-52 strikes had been conducted in the area in hopes of slowing the build-up. ARVN forces had also been deployed forward toward the border in order to slow the PAVN advance and allow the application of airpower to deplete North Vietnamese manpower and logistics. The Bình Định offensive, however, threw General Du into a panic and almost convinced him to fall for the North Vietnamese ploy and divert his forces from the highlands.

John Paul Vann, director of the U.S. Second Regional Assistance Group, reassured Du that it was only a ruse and to remain ready for the main blow, which he was convinced would come from western Laos. Vann, although a civilian, had been granted the unique authority to command all U.S. military advisors within his region. Vann worked day and night, using his extensive civilian and military contacts to channel U.S. support (especially air support) to the region. Major General John G. Hill Jr., Du&#x27;s senior military advisor, described Vann&#x27;s extraordinary actions: &quot;The rest of us organized around Vann&#x27;s personal efforts and concentrated on getting the resources marshalled to take advantage of the leadership he was exerting with the Vietnamese.&quot;

To counter the possible threat from the west, Du had deployed two regiments of the 22nd Division to Tân Cảnh and Đắk Tô Base Camp and two armored squadrons to Ben Het.

On 12 April, the 2nd PAVN Division, elements of the 203rd Tank Regiment, and several independent regiments of the B-3 Front attacked the outpost at Tan Canh and the nearby Đắk Tô base. When the ARVN armor moved out of Ben Het toward Đắk Tô, it was ambushed and destroyed. The overwhelmed South Vietnamese defense northwest of Kon Tum quickly disintegrated, placing the command of III Corps in a quandary. With the remainder of the 22nd Division covering the coast there were few forces left to defend the provincial capital of Kon Tum.

The North Vietnamese southern advance inexplicably halted for three crucial weeks. While the northern crisis waned, however, General Du began to unravel, finding it increasingly difficult to make decisions. Vann gave up all pretext of South Vietnamese command, took over himself, and openly issued orders. He placed responsibility for the defense of the city of Kon Tum on the shoulders of Colonel Lý Tòng Bá, commander of the 23rd Division. Vann then used massive B-52 strikes to hold the North Vietnamese at arm&#x27;s length and reduce their numbers while he managed to find additional troops with which to stabilize the situation.

By 14 May, North Vietnamese forces had reached Kon Tum and launched their main assault. The 320th PAVN Division, the 1st and 141st Regiments of the 2nd PAVN Division, and elements of the 203rd Tank Regiment attacked the city from the north, south, and west. By the time of the assault, the city mustered a defensive force that consisted of the 23rd Division and several Ranger groups. Their three-week delay cost the North Vietnamese dearly. By 14 May, the worst of the fighting in I and II Corps was over and a majority of the B-52s were free to concentrate on the Central Highlands. During the North Vietnamese attack, the positions of the 44th and 45th ARVN Regiments crumbled and were overrun, but a well-placed B-52 strike landed directly on the PAVN attackers at the point of the breakthrough. The next morning, when the South Vietnamese returned to their former positions unopposed, 400 bodies were discovered, along with seven destroyed tanks.

At Vann&#x27;s insistence, a personnel shake-up took place in III Corps when President Thieu replaced Du with Major General Nguyễn Văn Toàn, whose outwardly confident and assertive nature was the complete opposite of Du&#x27;s. The actions at Kon Tum for the following two weeks became characterized by massed PAVN assaults that were lashed by B-52, tactical air, and helicopter gunship attacks. ARVN troops then counterattacked over the remains of the attacking wave. On 26 May, four North Vietnamese regiments supported by armored forces managed to punch a hole in the defense, but their advance was halted by U.S. helicopters firing the new TOW missiles. During the following three days of fighting, 24 North Vietnamese T-54 and PT-76 tanks were destroyed by TOWs and the breach was sealed.

With the aid of the U.S. and Republic of Vietnam Air Forces and despite severe losses, ARVN managed to hold Kon Tum during the remainder of the battle. Aerial resupply was supported by the US Army&#x27;s &quot;549th QM (AD)&quot; (QuarterMaster, Air Delivery) Rigger Company, which had been rapid-deployed from Okinawa in early April. By early June, the PAVN faded back to the west, leaving behind over 4,000 dead on the battlefield. It was estimated by U.S. intelligence that total PAVN casualties in the Central Highlands during the offensive totaled between 20,000 and 40,000 troops. John Vann did not have time to savor his victory. While returning to Kon Tum from a briefing in Saigon on 9 June, he was killed in a helicopter crash.

In late July the ARVN 22nd Division, now commanded by Brigadier General Phan Dinh Niem, in cooperation with Bình Định Province RF/PF forces, retook Hoài Nhơn and Tam Quan district towns and reestablished communications on Highway 1 north to the southern boundary of Quảng Ngãi Province.

===Southern Cambodia and IV Corps===

On 22 March the PAVN 101D Regiment, 1st Division attacked the ARVN 42nd Ranger Group outpost at Kompong Trach 15 km north of the Cambodia-South Vietnam border. Fighting continued until the end of April as each side reinforced. The PAVN 1st Division eventually seized Kompong Trach but had suffered heavy losses which impacted its later operations in IV Corps.

On 7 April PAVN/VC local main force units, the 18B, 95B, D1 and D2 Regiments began attacks in the Mekong Delta, initially in Chương Thiện Province. As the ARVN 21st Division and the 15th Regiment, 9th Division had been deployed to III Corps to reinforce the fighting at An Lộc, the PAVN/VC were initially able to have some success against isolated RF/PF outposts.

On 18 May elements of the PAVN 52D and 101D Regiments, 1st Division attacked Kiên Lương, the fighting continued for ten days before ARVN Rangers and armored forces succeeded in forcing the PAVN to withdraw towards the Cambodian border.

On 23 May following fighting between the PAVN 207th Regiment and ARVN Ranger and armored forces in Cambodia, 15 km north of Cai Cai, the ARVN captured documents indicating plans for PAVN infiltration into northern Kiến Tường Province and subsequent attacks against Mộc Hóa. Subsequent intelligence showed that the PAVN 5th Division which had been beaten at An Lộc was moving into the Elephant&#x27;s Foot () area of Cambodia and would then move into Base Area 470 in the Plain of Reeds. The ARVN 7th Division deployed to the Elephant&#x27;s Foot area to engage PAVN forces and with strong U.S. air support inflicted severe losses on the PAVN units there. However, despite their losses two regiments from the PAVN 5th Division and the 24th and Z18 Regiments pushed towards Base Area 470 and by early July six PAVN regiments were located in northern Định Tường Province.

In late June after 22 days of fighting the ARVN 7th Division recaptured Kompong Trabek and cleared Route QL-1 (Cambodia) to Neak Loeung, however the PAVN recaptured the area when the 7th Division was withdrawn back into IV Corps in July to counter the PAVN/VC threat to Route QL-4, the vital supply line between the Delta&#x27;s ricebowl and Saigon. With the return of the ARVN 21st Division and 15th Regiment, 9th Division to IV Corps and continuous pounding from the air by U.S. tactical air and B-52&#x27;s, the ARVN was able to mount a series of operations in Định Tường Province and Base Area 470 that forced the PAVN/VC to reduce their operations and disperse into smaller units or withdraw into Cambodia.

While not as dramatic as the fighting on the other fronts of the Easter Offensive, IV Corps had managed to prevent the PAVN/VC from cutting Route QL-4 or seriously disrupting pacification efforts in the Mekong Delta while sharing nearly half of its forces with III Corps and I Corps.

==Air support, &quot;Freedom Train&quot;, and &quot;Linebacker&quot;==

The North Vietnamese had timed their offensive well by having it coincide with the end of the annual winter monsoon when low cloud cover and rain provided a blanket under which the offensive could proceed without interference by allied aerial attack. Air strikes were possible only by all-weather fighters or bombers, which could deliver their ordnance accurately through the cloud cover by radar direction or LORAN.

These missions were conducted by aircraft assigned to the U.S. Seventh Air Force and Seventh/Thirteenth Air Force in South Vietnam and Thailand or by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Task Force 77, offshore in the South China Sea. Besides the weather the most serious problem facing the Americans was that the drawdown of U.S. forces during the previous four years had included valuable ground support aircraft and their maintenance crews. By the spring of 1972, the U.S. Air Force had only three squadrons of F-4 Phantoms and one of A-37 Dragonflys available in the Republic of Vietnam, a total of 76 aircraft. Another 114 fighter-bombers were stationed at various bases in Thailand, while 83 B-52 Stratofortress heavy bombers were located at U-Tapao RTAFB and at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. Task Force 77 had four carriers assigned to it, but only two, and , were on station at the onset of the offensive. Their air wings totaled 140 strike aircraft.

To rectify the aircraft shortage, from 7 April to 13 May 176 F-4s and 12 F-105 Thunderchiefs were transferred from air bases in the Republic of Korea and the continental U.S. to Thailand during Operation &quot;Constant Guard&quot; I-IV. Between 5 February and 23 May, the Strategic Air Command (SAC) reinforced Guam during Operation &quot;Bullet Shot&quot; with a further 124 bombers, bringing the total available in-theater to 209. The Seventh Fleet was also beefed up by the addition of five aircraft carrier groups, including those of the , , , , and . This made five carriers available at any one time to conduct aerial operations. The Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) at this time consisted of nine squadrons of A-1 Skyraiders, A-37s, and F-5 Freedom Fighters, a total of 119 strike aircraft. There were also two squadrons of AC-47 or AC-119 fixed-wing gunships, totaling of 28 aircraft.

The weather conditions made early ground support haphazard, and these difficulties were compounded by North Vietnamese anti-aircraft units, which advanced behind the front line elements. PAVN moved 85 and 100 mm radar-directed batteries south of the DMZ and, on 17 February 81 SA-2 Guideline missiles were launched from the DMZ area, downing three F-4s. This heralded the farthest southern advance of SA-2 units thus far during the conflict. This classic high-low anti-aircraft coverage made aerial attacks extremely hazardous, especially when it was enhanced by the new shoulder-fired Grail.

The loss of the northern firebases early in the offensive in I Corps made U.S. naval gunfire the primary source of artillery support in that area. U.S. Marine Corps gunfire observers were then assigned to fly with forward air controllers, providing coordinates for shore targets. At the height of the offensive three U.S. cruisers and 38 destroyers were providing naval gunfire support.

With clearing weather the number of aircraft sorties soared. Between April and June there were 18,000 combat sorties flown to support the ARVN defense, 45 percent by the U.S. Air Force, 30 percent by the Navy and Marine Corps, and 25 percent by the VNAF. B-52s flew an additional 2,724 sorties. Ten U.S. and six VNAF aircraft were lost to SAM or anti-aircraft fire.

On 4 April, reacting to the ferocity of the offensive, President Nixon authorized tactical airstrikes from the DMZ north to the 18th parallel, the southern panhandle of North Vietnam. This supply interdiction effort was the first systematic bombing carried out in North Vietnam proper since the end of Operation Rolling Thunder in November 1968. Airstrikes north of the 20th parallel were authorized on 5 April under the cover name Operation &quot;Freedom Train&quot;. The first B-52 strike of the new operation was conducted on 10 April. President Nixon then decided to up the ante by targeting Hanoi and Haiphong. Between 1 May and 30 June, B-52s, fighter-bombers, and fixed-wing gunships had carried out 18,000 sorties over North Vietnam and suffered 29 aircraft losses.

On 8 May Nixon authorized the launching of Operation Pocket Money, the aerial mining of Haiphong and other North Vietnamese ports. Nixon had taken a gamble that the Soviet Union, with which he was conducting negotiations for a strategic arms limitation treaty (SALT I), would withhold a negative reaction in return for improved relations with the West. He was correct. The People&#x27;s Republic of China also muted any overt response to the escalatory measures for the same reason. Emboldened, Nixon decided to launch Operation &quot;Linebacker&quot; a systematic aerial assault on North Vietnam&#x27;s transportation, storage, and air defense systems on 10 May. During &quot;Linebacker&quot;, the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps lost 104 aircraft in combat, while they claimed the North Vietnamese opponents lost 63.

==Aftermath==
At the conclusion of the ARVN counteroffensive, both sides were exhausted but considered their efforts to have been successful. The South Vietnamese and the Americans believed the policy of Vietnamization to have been validated, the internal weaknesses of the South Vietnamese command structure, which had been rectified somewhat during the emergency, reappeared once it had passed. During the Easter offensive, more than 25,000 South Vietnamese civilians had been killed and almost a million became refugees, 600,000 of whom were living in camps under government care. American casualties in combat for all of 1972 totaled 300 killed, most during the offensive.

Hanoi had committed 14 divisions and 26 independent regiments to the offensive and had suffered approximately 100,000 casualties and lost almost all of its armored forces committed (134 T-54s, 56 PT-76s and 60 T-34s). In return, part of the territory gained in the initial months of fighting was lost back to South Vietnam (the battle for Quang Tri city lasted 81 days with South Vietnam eventually gaining control of the city in September as well as the majority of Quang Tri province). However the PAVN did hold territory at the end of the offensive as well as the western fringes of the II and III Corps sectors. In total around 10% of the country. It is believed that the North Vietnamese leadership had both underestimated the fighting ability of the ARVN, which, by 1972, had become one of the best-equipped armies in the world, and failed to grasp the destructiveness of American air power against an enemy fighting a conventional battle. Combined with these strategic errors, PAVN commanders had also thrown away their local numerical superiority by making frontal attacks into heavy defensive fire and suffered massive casualties as a consequence. However, by its own estimate, the PAVN had also dealt the most severe blow in the entire war, with over 200,000 ARVN casualties, a third of the ARVN&#x27;s forces. This claim is disputed and countered by US and South Vietnamese numbers, and they claimed the North Vietnamese lost much of their armor and equipment and as many as 100,000 troops. None of North Vietnam&#x27;s strategic aims for the offensive were completely achieved. However, the offensive also allowed Viet Cong irregulars and political agents to make a return through the gaps in the defensive lines, which had been torn open during the offensive. Hanoi wasted no time in making use of what little ground it had gained. The North Vietnamese immediately began to extend their supply corridors from Laos and Cambodia into South Vietnam. The PAVN rapidly expanded port facilities at the captured town of Đông Hà, and within a year, over 20 percent of the materiel destined for the southern battlefield was flowing across its docks.

The ARVN suffered 39,587 dead in the same period, while American military deaths that year were 759, per U.S. military records. For the PAVN, the offensive was very costly. General Trần Văn Trà, writing about the offensive ten years after the fact, stated, &quot;Our troops were exhausted and their units in disarray. We had not been able to make up losses. We were short of manpower as well as food and ammunition.&quot;

The ARVN always had problems keeping men in the ranks, corruption and incompetence among officers was endemic. On May 1972, general Creighton Abrams fumed at ARVN complaints that they lacked arms and equipment. He said: &quot;“The ARVN haven’t lost their tanks because the enemy tanks knocked them out. The ARVN lost their tanks because goddamn it, they abandoned them. And, shit, if they had the Josef Stalin 3 [tank], it wouldn’t have been any better.”&quot; He likewise harangued President Thieu and Saigon’s chief of staff - Cao Van Vien: &quot;“Equipment is not what you need. You need men that will fight... You’ve got all the equipment you need... You lost most of your artillery because it was abandoned.”&quot;

In Paris, the peace negotiations continued, but this time, both sides were willing to make concessions. The chief American negotiator, Henry Kissinger, offered a ceasefire, recognition of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam by the Saigon government, and the total American withdrawal from South Vietnam as incentives. For the United States, getting North Vietnam to finally recognize South Vietnam&#x27;s government as a legitimate body was crucial to any deal in Paris. For North Vietnam, the terms were enough to meet the criteria for victory that Hanoi&#x27;s leaders had established before the offensive.

The only obstacle to a settlement was Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, whose government would have to assent to any agreement. The intransigence of Thiệu and his demand for the U.S. not to abandon his nation after any agreement, as well as new demands by Hanoi, caused the stalling of peace talks in December. That led Nixon to launch Operation Linebacker II, a bombing campaign aimed at North Vietnam&#x27;s transport network, especially around Hanoi and Haiphong. This bombing campaign lasted from 18 Dec to 29 Dec 1972. Despite this, in the Paris Peace Accords, signed in January 1973, the terms were favorable to North Vietnam., confirmed that North Vietnamese troops and support would remain in South Vietnam in the areas that they occupied, while all fighting was to be stopped by the signatory parties on both sides. With the U.S. committed to disengagement (and after threats from Nixon that Thiệu would be abandoned if he did not agree), Thiệu had little choice but to accede.

<doc id="648942" wikidata="Q1139972" url="?curid=648942" title="Cricket statistics">
<text>Cricket is a sport that generates a variety of statistics.

Statistics are recorded for each player during a match, and aggregated over a career. At the professional level, statistics for Test cricket, one-day internationals, and first-class cricket are recorded separately. However, since Test matches are a form of first-class cricket, a player&#x27;s first-class statistics will &quot;include&quot; their Test match statistics – but not vice versa. Nowadays records are also maintained for List A and Twenty20 limited over matches. These matches are normally limited over games played domestically at the national level by leading Test nations. Since one-day internationals are a form of List A limited over matches, a player&#x27;s List A statistics will &quot;include&quot; their ODI match statistics – but not vice versa.

==General statistics==
* Matches (Mat/M/Mts): Number of matches played. (also Played (Pl).)
* Catches (Ct): Number of catches taken.
* Stumpings (St): Number of stumpings made (as a wicket-keeper).

==Batting statistics==
* Innings (I): The number of innings in which the batsman actually batted.
* Not outs (NO): The number of times the batsman was not out at the conclusion of an innings they batted in.1
* Runs (R): The number of runs scored.
* 4&#x27;s: The number of 4&#x27;s the batsmen has scored.
* 6&#x27;s: The number of 6&#x27;s the batsmen has scored.
* Highest score (HS/Best): The highest score ever made by the batsman.
* Batting average (Ave): The total number of runs divided by the total number of innings in which the batsman was out. Ave = Runs/[I – NO] (also Avge or Avg.)
* Centuries (100): The number of innings in which the batsman scored one hundred runs or more.
* Half-centuries (50): The number of innings in which the batsman scored fifty to ninety-nine runs (centuries do not count as half-centuries as well).
* Balls faced (BF or B): The total number of balls received, including no-balls but not including wides.
* Strike rate (SR): The average number of runs scored per 100 balls faced. (SR = [100 * Runs]/BF)
* Run rate (RR): The average number of runs a batsman (or the batting side) scores in an over of 6 balls.
* Net run rate (NRR): A method of ranking teams with equal points in limited overs league competitions.
* Runs Per Wicket Ratio (RpW ratio): The number of runs scored per wicket lost, divided by the number of runs conceded per wicket taken. It is a method of ranking teams with equal points in the league table of the World Test Championship.

1 Batsmen who are not required to bat in a particular innings (due to victory or declaration) are not considered &quot;Not Out&quot; in that innings. Only the player/s who have taken to the crease and remained there until the completion of an innings, are marked &quot;Not Out&quot; on the scorecard. For statistical purposes, batsmen who retire due to injury or illness are also deemed not out, while batsmen who retire for any other reason are deemed out, except in exceptional circumstances (in 1983 Gordon Greenidge, not out on 154, departed a Test match to be with his daughter, who was ill and subsequently died – he was subsequently deemed not out the only such decision in the history of Test cricket).

==Bowling statistics==
* Overs (O or OV): The number of overs bowled. The notation is (x.y), meaning x completed overs plus y legal balls in the current over have been bowled. 
* Balls (B): The number of balls bowled. Overs is more traditional, but balls is a more useful statistic because the number of balls per over has varied historically (and even within a single match, can vary due to umpire miscounting).
* Maiden overs (M): The number of maiden overs (overs in which the bowler conceded zero runs) bowled.
* Runs (R): The number of runs conceded.
* Wickets (W): The number of wickets taken.
* Bowling analysis (BA or OMRW): A shorthand notation consisting of a bowler&#x27;s Overs, Maidens, Runs conceded and Wickets taken (in that order), usually for a single innings but sometimes for other periods. For example, an analysis of 10–3–27–2 would indicate that the player bowled ten overs, of which three were maidens, conceded 27 runs and took two wickets.
* No-balls (Nb): The number of no-balls bowled.
* Wides (Wd): The number of wides bowled.
* Bowling average (Ave): The average number of runs conceded per wicket. (Ave = Runs/W)
* Strike rate (SR): The average number of balls bowled per wicket taken. (SR = Balls/W)
* Economy rate (Econ): The average number of runs conceded per over. (Econ = Runs/Overs bowled).
* Best bowling (BB): The bowler&#x27;s best bowling performance, defined as firstly the greatest number of wickets, secondly the fewest runs conceded for that number of wickets. (Thus, a performance of 7 for 102 is considered better than one of 6 for 19.)
** BBI stands for Best Bowling in Innings and only gives the score for one innings. (If only the BB rate is given it&#x27;s considered the BBI rate.)
** BBM stands for Best Bowling in Match and gives the combined score over 2 or more innings in one match. (For limited-overs matches with one innings per side, this score is equal to the BBI or BB.)
* Five wickets in an innings (5w): The number of innings in which the bowler took at least five wickets. Four wickets in an innings (4w), the number of innings in which the bowler took &quot;exactly&quot; four wickets, is sometimes recorded alongside five wickets, especially in limited overs cricket.
* Ten wickets in a match (10w): The number of matches in which the bowler took at least ten wickets; recorded for Tests and first-class matches only.

==Dynamic and graphical statistics==

The advent of saturation television coverage of professional cricket has provided an impetus to develop new and interesting forms of presenting statistical data to viewers. Television networks have thus invented several new ways of presenting statistics. The advent of T20 cricket has contributed to this as well.

These include displaying two-dimensional and even three-dimensional plots of shot directions and distances on an overhead view of a cricket field, commonly referred to as a Wagon-Wheel. Other forms include graphs of run scoring and wicket taking numbers plotted against time or balls bowled over a career or within a match. These graphics can be changed dynamically through a computer-controlled back-end, as statistics evolve during a game. Commonly used graphics, especially during a limited-over match, are a worm graph, called so, for the worm-like appearance of the teams&#x27; score progression as the overs progress; and; a Manhattan Chart, called so, for its resemblance to the Manhattan skyline.

==Notation==

The asterisk (the * symbol) is used to mean different things in different contexts:
* In the context of the two batsmen currently out in the field, it is used to indicate which of them is the striker.
* For a batsman who appears in a scorecard (i.e. in an assessment of the batting performance of all batsmen on his team), it is used to indicate that the batsman finished not out in the innings.
* In a team lineup, the captain has an asterisk placed after his name.

Parentheses (or numbers presented in smaller font next to other numbers) generally indicate number of balls:
* For a bowler, the number of overs they have bowled is sometimes placed in parentheses next to their number of wickets taken and runs conceded i.e. 3–45 (5.2) indicates 5.2 overs have been bowled.
* For a batsman, they indicate the number of balls faced i.e. 20 (33) means 20 runs scored from 33 deliveries.

A slash or dash between two numbers usually indicates that one of the numbers is the number of runs, and the other number is the number of wickets:
* 3/21 for a bowler means 3 wickets taken but 21 runs conceded. (See bowling analysis.)
* 100–3 for a team means 100 runs scored for 3 wickets lost. (Australia reverses this order.)

Innings are sometimes shortened to &quot;inns&quot; or &quot;inn&quot; i.e. 2nd inns of a Test match.

<text>United Technologies Corporation (UTC) was an American multinational conglomerate headquartered in Farmington, Connecticut. It researched, developed, and manufactured products in numerous areas, including aircraft engines, aerospace systems, HVAC, elevators and escalators, fire and security, building automation, and industrial products, among others. UTC was also a large military contractor, getting about 10% of its revenue from the U.S. government. In April 2020, UTC merged with the Raytheon Company to form Raytheon Technologies, later renamed RTX Corporation.

==History==

===Pre-1970s===
===1970s and 1980s===
In 1974, Harry Jack Gray left Litton Industries to become the CEO of United Aircraft. He pursued a strategy of growth and diversification, changing the parent corporation&#x27;s name to United Technologies Corporation (UTC) in 1975 to reflect the intent to diversify into numerous high tech fields beyond aerospace. (The change became official on May 1, 1975.) The diversification was partially to balance civilian business against any overreliance on military business. UTC became a mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A)–focused organization, with various forced takeovers of unwilling smaller corporations. The next year (1976), UTC forcibly acquired Otis Elevator. In 1979, Carrier Refrigeration and Mostek were acquired; the Carrier deal was forcible, while the Mostek deal was a white knight move against hostile takeover designs by Gould.

At one point, the military portion of UTC&#x27;s business, whose sensitivity to &quot;excess profits&quot; and boom/bust demand drove UTC to diversify away from it, actually carried the weight of losses incurred by the commercial M&amp;A side of the business. Although M&amp;A activity was not new to United Aircraft, the M&amp;A activity of the 1970s and 1980s was higher-stakes and arguably unfocused. Rather than aviation being the central theme of UTC businesses, high tech (of any type) was the new theme. Some Wall Street watchers questioned the true value of M&amp;A at almost any price, seemingly for its own sake.

Mostek was sold in 1985 to the French electronics company Thomson.

In 2007, UTC opened the Hawk Works, a Rapid Prototyping and Military Derivatives Completion Center (RPMDCC) located west of the Elmira-Corning Regional Airport in Big Flats, New York.

In March 2008, UTC made a $2.63 billion bid to acquire Diebold, a Canton, Ohio based manufacturer of banking and voting machines. Diebold rejected the buyout bid as inadequate.

In April 2010, UTC announced that it was investing €15 million ($20 million) to set up the United Technologies Research Centre Ireland at University College Cork’s Tyndall National Institute which would carry out research on energy and security systems.

In June 2012, it was discovered that UTC sold military technology to the Chinese. For pleading guilty to violating the Arms Export Control Act and making false statements, United Technologies and its subsidiaries were fined $75 million.
In February 2013, UTC Power was sold to ClearEdge Power.

In October 2014, Toshiba and United Technologies made a deal to expand their joint venture outside Japan.
In February 2016, UTC subsidiary Carrier Air Conditioner announced to employees at its Indianapolis and Huntington plants, that Carrier is moving manufacturing to Mexico: &quot;The best way to stay competitive and protect the business for long-term is to move production from our facility in Indianapolis to Monterrey, Mexico. &quot; In December, Carrier agreed to keep the Indianapolis plant open, keeping 700 jobs in Indianapolis. The plant in Huntington, Indiana would still close their doors, leaving 700 employees jobless.

In June 2019, United Technologies announced the intention to merge with defense contractor Raytheon to form Raytheon Technologies Corporation. The combined company, valued at more than $100 billion after planned spinoffs, would be the world&#x27;s second-largest aerospace-and-defense company by sales behind Boeing. Although UTC was the nominal survivor, the merged company was headquartered at legacy Raytheon&#x27;s former base in Waltham, Massachusetts. The merger was completed in April 2020.

<text>Visual acuity (VA) commonly refers to the clarity of vision, but technically rates an animal&#x27;s ability to recognize small details with precision. Visual acuity depends on optical and neural factors. Optical factors of the eye influence the sharpness of an image on its retina. Neural factors include the health and functioning of the retina, of the neural pathways to the brain, and of the interpretative faculty of the brain.

The most commonly referred-to visual acuity is &quot;distance acuity&quot; or &quot;far acuity&quot; (e.g., &quot;20/20 vision&quot;), which describes someone&#x27;s ability to recognize small details at a far distance. This ability is compromised in people with myopia, also known as short-sightedness or near-sightedness. Another visual acuity is &quot;near acuity&quot;, which describes someone&#x27;s ability to recognize small details at a near distance. This ability is compromised in people with hyperopia, also known as long-sightedness or far-sightedness.

A common optical cause of low visual acuity is refractive error (ametropia): errors in how the light is refracted in the eye. Causes of refractive errors include aberrations in the shape of the eye or the cornea, and reduced ability of the lens to focus light. When the combined refractive power of the cornea and lens is too high for the length of the eye, the retinal image will be in focus in front of the retina and out of focus on the retina, yielding myopia. A similar poorly focused retinal image happens when the combined refractive power of the cornea and lens is too low for the length of the eye except that the focused image is behind the retina, yielding hyperopia. Normal refractive power is referred to as emmetropia. Other optical causes of low visual acuity include astigmatism, in which contours of a particular orientation are blurred, and more complex corneal irregularities.

Refractive errors can mostly be corrected by optical means (such as eyeglasses, contact lenses, and refractive surgery). For example, in the case of myopia, the correction is to reduce the power of the eye&#x27;s refraction by a so-called minus lens.

Neural factors that limit acuity are located in the retina, in the pathways to the brain, or in the brain. Examples of conditions affecting the retina include detached retina and macular degeneration. Examples of conditions affecting the brain include amblyopia (caused by the visual brain not having developed properly in early childhood) and by brain damage, such as from traumatic brain injury or stroke. When optical factors are corrected for, acuity can be considered a measure of neural functioning.

Visual acuity is typically measured while fixating, i.e. as a measure of central (or foveal) vision, for the reason that it is highest in the very center. However, acuity in peripheral vision can be of equal importance in everyday life. Acuity declines towards the periphery first steeply and then more gradually, in an inverse-linear fashion (i.e. the decline follows approximately a hyperbola). The decline is according to &quot;E&quot;2/(&quot;E&quot;2+&quot;E&quot;), where &quot;E&quot; is eccentricity in degrees visual angle, and &quot;E&quot;2 is a constant of approximately 2 degrees. At 2 degrees eccentricity, for example, acuity is half the foveal value.

Visual acuity is a measure of how well small details are resolved in the very center of the visual field; it therefore does not indicate how larger patterns are recognized. Visual acuity alone thus cannot determine the overall quality of visual function.

== Definition ==

Visual acuity is a measure of the spatial resolution of the visual processing system. VA, as it is sometimes referred to by optical professionals, is tested by requiring the person whose vision is being tested to identify so-called optotypes – stylized letters, Landolt rings, pediatric symbols, symbols for the illiterate, standardized Cyrillic letters in the Golovin–Sivtsev table, or other patterns – on a printed chart (or some other means) from a set viewing distance. Optotypes are represented as black symbols against a white background (i.e. at maximum contrast). The distance between the person&#x27;s eyes and the testing chart is set so as to approximate &quot;optical infinity&quot; in the way the lens attempts to focus (far acuity), or at a defined reading distance (near acuity).

A reference value above which visual acuity is considered normal is called 6/6 vision, the USC equivalent of which is 20/20 vision: At 6 metres or 20 feet, a human eye with that performance is able to separate contours that are approximately 1.75 mm apart. Vision of 6/12 corresponds to lower performance, while vision of 6/3 to better performance. Normal individuals have an acuity of 6/4 or better (depending on age and other factors).

In the expression 6/x vision, the numerator (6) is the distance in metres between the subject and the chart and the denominator (x) the distance at which a person with 6/6 acuity would discern the same optotype. Thus, 6/12 means that a person with 6/6 vision would discern the same optotype from 12 metres away (i.e. at twice the distance). This is equivalent to saying that with 6/12 vision, the person possesses half the spatial resolution and needs twice the size to discern the optotype.

A simple and efficient way to state acuity is by converting the fraction to a decimal: 6/6 then corresponds to an acuity (or a Visus) of 1.0 (see &quot;Expression&quot; below), while 6/3 corresponds to 2.0, which is often attained by well-corrected healthy young subjects with binocular vision. Stating acuity as a decimal number is the standard in European countries, as required by the European norm (EN ISO 8596, previously DIN 58220).

The precise distance at which acuity is measured is not important as long as it is sufficiently far away and the size of the optotype on the retina is the same. That size is specified as a visual angle, which is the angle, at the eye, under which the optotype appears. For 6/6 = 1.0 acuity, the size of a letter on the Snellen chart or Landolt C chart is a visual angle of 5 arc minutes (1 arc min = 1/60 of a degree), which is a 43 point font at 20 feet. By the design of a typical optotype (like a Snellen E or a Landolt C), the critical gap that needs to be resolved is 1/5 this value, i.e., 1 arc min. The latter is the value used in the international definition of visual acuity:

Acuity is a measure of visual performance and does not relate to the eyeglass prescription required to correct vision. Instead, an eye exam seeks to find the prescription that will provide the best corrected visual performance achievable. The resulting acuity may be greater or less than 6/6 = 1.0. Indeed, a subject diagnosed as having 6/6 vision will often actually have higher visual acuity because, once this standard is attained, the subject is considered to have normal (in the sense of undisturbed) vision and smaller optotypes are not tested. Subjects with 6/6 vision or &quot;better&quot; (20/15, 20/10, etc.) may still benefit from an eyeglass correction for other problems related to the visual system, such as hyperopia, ocular injuries, or presbyopia.

== Measurement ==

Visual acuity is measured by a psychophysical procedure and as such relates the physical characteristics of a stimulus to a subject&#x27;s percept and their resulting responses. Measurement can be taken by using an eye chart invented by Ferdinand Monoyer, by optical instruments, or by computerized tests like the FrACT.

Care must be taken that viewing conditions correspond to the standard, such as correct illumination of the room and the eye chart, correct viewing distance, enough time for responding, error allowance, and so forth. In European countries, these conditions are standardized by the European norm (EN ISO 8596, previously DIN 58220).

== History ==
== Physiology ==
Daylight vision (i.e. photopic vision) is subserved by cone receptor cells which have high spatial density (in the central fovea) and allow high acuity of 6/6 or better. In low light (i.e., scotopic vision), cones do not have sufficient sensitivity and vision is subserved by rods. Spatial resolution is then much lower. This is due to spatial summation of rods, i.e. a number of rods merge into a bipolar cell, in turn connecting to a ganglion cell, and the resulting unit for resolution is large, and acuity small. There are no rods in the very center of the visual field (the foveola), and highest performance in low light is achieved in near peripheral vision.

The maximum angular resolution of the human eye is 28 arc seconds or 0.47 arc minutes; this gives an angular resolution of 0.008 degrees, and at a distance of 1 km corresponds to 136 mm. This is equal to 0.94 arc minutes per line pair (one white and one black line), or 0.016 degrees. For a pixel pair (one white and one black pixel) this gives a pixel density of 128 pixels per degree (PPD).

6/6 vision is defined as the ability to resolve two points of light separated by a visual angle of one minute of arc, corresponding to 60 PPD, or about 290–350 pixels per inch for a display on a device held 250 to 300 mm from the eye.

Thus, visual acuity, or resolving power (in daylight, central vision), is the property of cones.
To resolve detail, the eye&#x27;s optical system has to project a focused image on the fovea, a region inside the macula having the highest density of cone photoreceptor cells (the only kind of photoreceptors existing in the fovea&#x27;s very center of 300 μm diameter), thus having the highest resolution and best color vision. Acuity and color vision, despite being mediated by the same cells, are different physiologic functions that do not interrelate except by position. Acuity and color vision can be affected independently.

The grain of a photographic mosaic has just as limited resolving power as the &quot;grain&quot; of the retinal mosaic. To see detail, two sets of receptors must be intervened by a middle set. The maximum resolution is that 30 seconds of arc, corresponding to the foveal cone diameter or the angle subtended at the nodal point of the eye. To get reception from each cone, as it would be if vision was on a mosaic basis, the &quot;local sign&quot; must be obtained from a single cone via a chain of one bipolar, ganglion, and lateral geniculate cell each. A key factor of obtaining detailed vision, however, is inhibition. This is mediated by neurons such as the amacrine and horizontal cells, which functionally render the spread or convergence of signals inactive. This tendency to one-to-one shuttle of signals is powered by brightening of the center and its surroundings, which triggers the inhibition leading to a one-to-one wiring. This scenario, however, is rare, as cones may connect to both midget and flat (diffuse) bipolars, and amacrine and horizontal cells can merge messages just as easily as inhibit them.

Light travels from the fixation object to the fovea through an imaginary path called the visual axis. The eye&#x27;s tissues and structures that are in the visual axis (and also the tissues adjacent to it) affect the quality of the image. These structures are: tear film, cornea, anterior chamber, pupil, lens, vitreous, and finally the retina. The posterior part of the retina, called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is responsible for, among many other things, absorbing light that crosses the retina so it cannot bounce to other parts of the retina. In many vertebrates, such as cats, where high visual acuity is not a priority, there is a reflecting tapetum layer that gives the photoreceptors a &quot;second chance&quot; to absorb the light, thus improving the ability to see in the dark. This is what causes an animal&#x27;s eyes to seemingly glow in the dark when a light is shone on them. The RPE also has a vital function of recycling the chemicals used by the rods and cones in photon detection. If the RPE is damaged and does not clean up this &quot;shed&quot; blindness can result.

As in a photographic lens, visual acuity is affected by the size of the pupil. Optical aberrations of the eye that decrease visual acuity are at a maximum when the pupil is largest (about 8 mm), which occurs in low-light conditions. When the pupil is small (1–2 mm), image sharpness may be limited by diffraction of light by the pupil (see diffraction limit). Between these extremes is the pupil diameter that is generally best for visual acuity in normal, healthy eyes; this tends to be around 3 or 4 mm.

If the optics of the eye were otherwise perfect, theoretically, acuity would be limited by pupil diffraction, which would be a diffraction-limited acuity of 0.4 minutes of arc (minarc) or 6/2.6 acuity. The smallest cone cells in the fovea have sizes corresponding to 0.4 minarc of the visual field, which also places a lower limit on acuity. The optimal acuity of 0.4 minarc or 6/2.6 can be demonstrated using a laser interferometer that bypasses any defects in the eye&#x27;s optics and projects a pattern of dark and light bands directly on the retina. Laser interferometers are now used routinely in patients with optical problems, such as cataracts, to assess the health of the retina before subjecting them to surgery.

The visual cortex is the part of the cerebral cortex in the posterior part of the brain responsible for processing visual stimuli, called the occipital lobe. The central 10° of field (approximately the extension of the macula) is represented by at least 60% of the visual cortex. Many of these neurons are believed to be involved directly in visual acuity processing.

Proper development of normal visual acuity depends on a human or an animal having normal visual input when it is very young. Any visual deprivation, that is, anything interfering with such input over a prolonged period of time, such as a cataract, severe eye turn or strabismus, anisometropia (unequal refractive error between the two eyes), or covering or patching the eye during medical treatment, will usually result in a severe and permanent decrease in visual acuity and pattern recognition in the affected eye if not treated early in life, a condition known as amblyopia. The decreased acuity is reflected in various abnormalities in cell properties in the visual cortex. These changes include a marked decrease in the number of cells connected to the affected eye as well as cells connected to both eyes in cortical area V1, resulting in a loss of stereopsis, i.e. depth perception by binocular vision (colloquially: &quot;3D vision&quot;). The period of time over which an animal is highly sensitive to such visual deprivation is referred to as the critical period.

The eye is connected to the visual cortex by the optic nerve coming out of the back of the eye. The two optic nerves come together behind the eyes at the optic chiasm, where about half of the fibers from each eye cross over to the opposite side and join fibers from the other eye representing the corresponding visual field, the combined nerve fibers from both eyes forming the optic tract. This ultimately forms the physiological basis of binocular vision. The tracts project to a relay station in the midbrain called the lateral geniculate nucleus, part of the thalamus, and then to the visual cortex along a collection of nerve fibers called the optic radiation.

Any pathological process in the visual system, even in older humans beyond the critical period, will often cause decreases in visual acuity. Thus measuring visual acuity is a simple test in accessing the health of the eyes, the visual brain, or pathway to the brain. Any relatively sudden decrease in visual acuity is always a cause for concern. Common causes of decreases in visual acuity are cataracts and scarred corneas, which affect the optical path, diseases that affect the retina, such as macular degeneration and diabetes, diseases affecting the optic pathway to the brain such as tumors and multiple sclerosis, and diseases affecting the visual cortex such as tumors and strokes.

Though the resolving power depends on the size and packing density of the photoreceptors, the neural system must interpret the receptors&#x27; information. As determined from single-cell experiments on the cat and primate, different ganglion cells in the retina are tuned to different spatial frequencies, so some ganglion cells at each location have better acuity than others. Ultimately, however, it appears that the size of a patch of cortical tissue in visual area V1 that processes a given location in the visual field (a concept known as cortical magnification) is equally important in determining visual acuity. In particular, that size is largest in the fovea&#x27;s center, and decreases with increasing distance from there.

=== Optical aspects ===
Besides the neural connections of the receptors, the optical system is an equally key player in retinal resolution. In the ideal eye, the image of a diffraction grating can subtend 0.5 micrometre on the retina. This is certainly not the case, however, and furthermore the pupil can cause diffraction of the light. Thus, black lines on a grating will be mixed with the intervening white lines to make a gray appearance. Defective optical issues (such as uncorrected myopia) can render it worse, but suitable lenses can help. Images (such as gratings) can be sharpened by lateral inhibition, i.e., more highly excited cells inhibiting the less excited cells. A similar reaction is in the case of chromatic aberrations, in which the color fringes around black-and-white objects are inhibited similarly.

== Expression ==
Visual acuity is often measured according to the size of letters viewed on a Snellen chart or the size of other symbols, such as Landolt Cs or the E Chart.

In some countries, acuity is expressed as a simple fraction, and in some as a decimal number. Using the metre as a unit of measurement, (fractional) visual acuity is expressed relative to 6/6. Otherwise, using the foot, visual acuity is expressed relative to 20/20. For all practical purposes, 20/20 vision is equivalent to 6/6. In the decimal system, acuity is defined as the reciprocal value of the size of the gap (measured in arc minutes) of the smallest Landolt C, the orientation of which can be reliably identified. A value of 1.0 is equal to 6/6.

LogMAR is another commonly used scale, expressed as the (decadic) logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (MAR), which is the reciprocal of the acuity number. The LogMAR scale converts the geometric sequence of a traditional chart to a linear scale. It measures visual acuity loss: positive values indicate vision loss, while negative values denote normal or better visual acuity. This scale is commonly used clinically and in research because the lines are of equal length and so it forms a continuous scale with equally spaced intervals between points, unlike Snellen charts, which have different numbers of letters on each line.

A visual acuity of 6/6 is frequently described as meaning that a person can see detail from away the same as a person with &quot;normal&quot; eyesight would see from 6 metres. If a person has a visual acuity of 6/12, they are said to see detail from away the same as a person with &quot;normal&quot; eyesight would see it from away.

The definition of 6/6 is somewhat arbitrary, since human eyes typically have higher acuity, as Tscherning writes, &quot;We have found also that the best eyes have a visual acuity which approaches 2, and we can be almost certain that if, with a good illumination, the acuity is only equal to 1, the eye presents defects sufficiently pronounced to be easily established.&quot; Most observers may have a binocular acuity superior to 6/6; the limit of acuity in the unaided human eye is around 6/3–6/2.4 (20/10–20/8), although 6/3 was the highest score recorded in a study of some US professional athletes. Some birds of prey, such as hawks, are believed to have an acuity of around 20/2; in this respect, their vision is much better than human eyesight.

When visual acuity is below the largest optotype on the chart, the reading distance is reduced until the patient can read it. Once the patient is able to read the chart, the letter size and test distance are noted. If the patient is unable to read the chart at any distance, they are tested as follows:

=== Legal definitions ===
Various countries have defined statutory limits for poor visual acuity that qualifies as a disability. For example, in Australia, the Social Security Act defines blindness as:

In the US, the relevant federal statute defines blindness as follows:

A person&#x27;s visual acuity is registered documenting the following: whether the test was for distant or near vision, the eye(s) evaluated and whether corrective lenses (i.e. glasses or contact lenses) were used:
* Distance from the chart
** D (distant) for the evaluation done at .
** N (near) for the evaluation done at .
* Eye evaluated
** OD (Latin &quot;oculus dexter&quot;) for the right eye.
** OS (Latin &quot;oculus sinister&quot;) for the left eye.
** OU (Latin &quot;oculi uterque&quot;) for both eyes.
* Usage of spectacles during the test
** cc (Latin &quot;cum correctore&quot;) with correctors.
** sc: (Latin &quot;sine correctore&quot;) without correctors.
* Pinhole occluder
** The abbreviation PH is followed by the visual acuity as measured with a pinhole occluder, which temporarily corrects for refractive errors such as myopia or astigmatism.
** PHNI means no improvement of visual acuity using a pinhole occluder.
So, distant visual acuity of 6/10 and 6/8 with pinhole in the right eye will be: DscOD 6/10 PH 6/8. Distant visual acuity of count fingers and 6/17 with pinhole in the left eye will be: DscOS CF PH 6/17. Near visual acuity of 6/8 with pinhole remaining at 6/8 in both eyes with spectacles will be: NccOU 6/8 PH 6/8.

&quot;Dynamic visual acuity&quot; defines the ability of the eye to visually discern fine detail in a moving object.

== Measurement considerations ==
Visual acuity measurement involves more than being able to see the optotypes. The patient should be cooperative, understand the optotypes, be able to communicate with the physician, and many more factors. If any of these factors is missing, then the measurement will not represent the patient&#x27;s real visual acuity.

Visual acuity is a subjective test meaning that if the patient is unwilling or unable to cooperate, the test cannot be done. A patient who is sleepy, intoxicated, or has any disease that can alter their consciousness or mental status, may not achieve their maximum possible acuity.

Patients who are illiterate in the language whose letters and/or numbers appear on the chart will be registered as having very low visual acuity if this is not known. Some patients will not tell the examiner that they do not know the optotypes, unless asked directly about it. Brain damage can result in a patient not being able to recognize printed letters, or being unable to spell them.

A motor inability can make a person respond incorrectly to the optotype shown and negatively affect the visual acuity measurement.

Variables such as pupil size, background adaptation luminance, duration of presentation, type of optotype used, interaction effects from adjacent visual contours (or &quot;crowding&quot;) can all affect visual acuity measurement.

=== Testing in children ===
The newborn&#x27;s visual acuity is approximately 6/133, developing to 6/6 well after the age of six months in most children, according to a study published in 2009.

The measurement of visual acuity in infants, pre-verbal children and special populations (for instance, disabled individuals) is not always possible with a letter chart. For these populations, specialised testing is necessary. As a basic examination step, one must check whether visual stimuli can be fixated, centered and followed.

More formal testing using preferential looking techniques use &quot;Teller acuity&quot; cards (presented by a technician from behind a window in the wall) to check whether the child is more visually attentive to a random presentation of vertical or horizontal gratings on one side compared with a blank page on the other side – the bars become progressively finer or closer together, and the endpoint is noted when the child in its adult carer&#x27;s lap equally prefers the two sides.

Another popular technique is electro-physiologic testing using visual evoked (cortical) potentials (VEPs or VECPs), which can be used to estimate visual acuity in doubtful cases and expected severe vision loss cases like Leber&#x27;s congenital amaurosis.

VEP testing of acuity is somewhat similar to preferential looking in using a series of black and white stripes (sine wave gratings) or checkerboard patterns (which produce larger responses than stripes). Behavioral responses are not required and brain waves created by the presentation of the patterns are recorded instead. The patterns become finer and finer until the evoked brain wave just disappears, which is considered to be the endpoint measure of visual acuity. In adults and older, verbal children capable of paying attention and following instructions, the endpoint provided by the VEP corresponds very well to the psychophysical measure in the standard measurement (i.e. the perceptual endpoint determined by asking the subject when they can no longer see the pattern). There is an assumption that this correspondence also applies to much younger children and infants, though this does not necessarily have to be the case. Studies do show the evoked brain waves, as well as derived acuities, are very adult-like by one year of age.

For reasons not totally understood, until a child is several years old, visual acuities from behavioral preferential looking techniques typically lag behind those determined using the VEP, a direct physiological measure of early visual processing in the brain. Possibly it takes longer for more complex behavioral and attentional responses, involving brain areas not directly involved in processing vision, to mature. Thus the visual brain may detect the presence of a finer pattern (reflected in the evoked brain wave), but the &quot;behavioral brain&quot; of a small child may not find it salient enough to pay special attention to.

A simple but less-used technique is checking oculomotor responses with an optokinetic nystagmus drum, where the subject is placed inside the drum and surrounded by rotating black and white stripes. This creates involuntary abrupt eye movements (nystagmus) as the brain attempts to track the moving stripes. There is a good correspondence between the optokinetic and usual eye-chart acuities in adults. A potentially serious problem with this technique is that the process is reflexive and mediated in the low-level brain stem, not in the visual cortex. Thus someone can have a normal optokinetic response and yet be cortically blind with no conscious visual sensation.

== &quot;Normal&quot; visual acuity ==
Visual acuity depends upon how accurately light is focused on the retina, the integrity of the eye&#x27;s neural elements, and the interpretative faculty of the brain. &quot;Normal&quot; visual acuity (in central, i.e. foveal vision) is frequently considered to be what was defined by Herman Snellen as the ability to recognize an optotype when it subtended 5 minutes of arc, that is Snellen&#x27;s chart 6/6-metre, 20/20 feet, 1.00 decimal or 0.0 logMAR. In young humans, the average visual acuity of a healthy, emmetropic eye (or ametropic eye with correction) is approximately 6/5 to 6/4, so it is inaccurate to refer to 6/6 visual acuity as &quot;perfect&quot; vision. On the contrary, Tscherning writes, &quot;We have found also that the best eyes have a visual acuity which approaches 2, and we can be almost certain that if, with a good illumination, the acuity is only equal to 1, the eye presents defects sufficiently pronounced to be easily established.&quot;

6/6 is the visual acuity needed to discriminate two contours separated by 1 arc minute – 1.75 mm at 6 metres. This is because a 6/6 letter, E for example, has three limbs and two spaces in between them, giving 5 different detailed areas. The ability to resolve this therefore requires 1/5 of the letter&#x27;s total size, which in this case would be 1 minute of arc (visual angle). The significance of the 6/6 standard can best be thought of as the lower limit of normal, or as a screening cutoff. When used as a screening test, subjects that reach this level need no further investigation, even though the average visual acuity with a healthy visual system is typically better.

Some people may have other visual problems, such as severe visual field defects, color blindness, reduced contrast, mild amblyopia, cerebral visual impairments, inability to track fast-moving objects, or one of many other visual impairments and still have &quot;normal&quot; visual acuity. Thus, &quot;normal&quot; visual acuity does not imply normal vision. The reason visual acuity is very widely used is that it is easily measured, its reduction (after correction) often indicates some disturbance, and that it often corresponds with the normal daily activities a person can handle, and evaluates their impairment to do them (even though there is heavy debate over that relationship).

== Other measures ==
Normally, visual acuity refers to the ability to resolve two separated points or lines, but there are other measures of the ability of the visual system to discern spatial differences.

Vernier acuity measures the ability to align two line segments. Humans can do this with remarkable accuracy. This success is regarded as&quot; hyperacuity&quot;. Under optimal conditions of good illumination, high contrast, and long line segments, the limit to vernier acuity is about 8 arc seconds or 0.13 arc minutes, compared to about 0.6 arc minutes (6/4) for normal visual acuity or the 0.4 arc minute diameter of a foveal cone. Because the limit of vernier acuity is well below that imposed on regular visual acuity by the &quot;retinal grain&quot; or size of the foveal cones, it is thought to be a process of the visual cortex rather than the retina. Supporting this idea, vernier acuity seems to correspond very closely (and may have the same underlying mechanism) enabling one to discern very slight differences in the orientations of two lines, where orientation is known to be processed in the visual cortex.

The smallest detectable visual angle produced by a single fine dark line against a uniformly illuminated background is also much less than foveal cone size or regular visual acuity. In this case, under optimal conditions, the limit is about 0.5 arc seconds or only about 2% of the diameter of a foveal cone. This produces a contrast of about 1% with the illumination of surrounding cones. The mechanism of detection is the ability to detect such small differences in contrast or illumination, and does not depend on the angular width of the bar, which cannot be discerned. Thus as the line gets finer, it appears to get fainter but not thinner.

Stereoscopic acuity is the ability to detect differences in depth with the two eyes. For more complex targets, stereoacuity is similar to normal monocular visual acuity, or around 0.6–1.0 arc minutes, but for much simpler targets, such as vertical rods, may be as low as only 2 arc seconds. Although stereoacuity normally corresponds very well with monocular acuity, it may be very poor, or absent, even in subjects with normal monocular acuities. Such individuals typically have abnormal visual development when they are very young, such as an alternating strabismus, or eye turn, where both eyes rarely, or never, point in the same direction and therefore do not function together.

Another test, including Visual acuity (EVTS/OptimEyes), uses targets which change in size, contrast, and viewing time. This test was developed by Daniel M. Laby with colleagues and uses item response theory to calculate a vision performance score (core score). This specific test of visual function has been shown to correlate to professional sports performance.

== Motion acuity ==

The eye has acuity limits for detecting motion. Forward motion is limited by the &quot;subtended angular velocity detection threshold&quot; (SAVT), and horizontal and vertical motion acuity are limited by lateral motion thresholds. The lateral motion limit is generally below the looming motion limit, and for an object of a given size, lateral motion becomes the more insightful of the two, once the observer moves sufficiently far away from the path of travel. Below these thresholds subjective constancy is experienced in accordance with the Stevens&#x27; power law and Weber–Fechner law.

=== Subtended angular velocity detection threshold (SAVT) ===
There is a specific acuity limit in detecting an approaching object&#x27;s looming motion. This is regarded as the subtended angular velocity detection threshold (SAVT) limit of visual acuity. It has a practical value of 0.0275 rad/s. For a person with SAVT limit of formula_1, the looming motion of a directly approaching object of size , moving at velocity , is not detectable until its distance is

formula_2

where the term is omitted for small objects relative to great distances by small-angle approximation.

To exceed the SAVT, an object of size moving as velocity must be closer than ; beyond that distance, subjective constancy is experienced. The SAVT formula_1 can be measured from the distance at which a looming object is first detected:

formula_4

where the term is omitted for small objects relative to great distances by small-angle approximation.

The SAVT has the same kind of importance to driving safety and sports as the static limit. The formula is derived from taking the derivative of the visual angle with respect to distance, and then multiplying by velocity to obtain the time rate of visual expansion ().

=== Lateral motion ===
There are acuity limits (formula_1) of horizontal and vertical motion as well. They can be measured and defined by the threshold detection of movement of an object traveling at distance and velocity orthogonal to the direction of view, from a set-back distance with the formula
formula_6
Because the tangent of the subtended angle is the ratio of the orthogonal distance to the set-back distance, the angular time rate (rad/s) of lateral motion is simply the derivative of the inverse tangent multiplied by the velocity (). In application this means that an orthogonally traveling object will not be discernible as moving until it has reached the distance

formula_7

where formula_1 for lateral motion is generally ≥ 0.0087 rad/s with probable dependence on deviation from the fovia and movement orientation, velocity is in terms of the distance units, and zero distance is straight ahead. Far object distances, close set-backs, and low velocities generally lower the salience of lateral motion. Detection with close or null set-back can be accomplished through the pure scale changes of looming motion.

=== Radial motion ===
The motion acuity limit affects radial motion in accordance to its definition, hence the ratio of the velocity to the radius must exceed formula_1:
formula_10

Radial motion is encountered in clinical and research environments, in dome theaters, and in virtual-reality headsets.

<text>Hartshorn is the antler of male red deer.

==Derivatives==
Various nitrogen compounds were made from hartshorn shavings:
* Oil of hartshorn is a crude chemical product obtained from the destructive distillation of deer antlers.
* Salt of hartshorn refers to ammonium carbonate, an early form of smelling salts and baking powder obtained by dry distillation of oil of hartshorn.
* Spirit of hartshorn (or spirits of hartshorn) is an archaic name for aqueous ammonia. Originally, this term was applied to a solution manufactured from the hooves and antlers of the red deer, as well as those of some other animals. The aqueous solution was colorless and pungent, consisting of about 28.5 percent ammonia. It was used chiefly as a detergent, for removing stains and extracting certain vegetable coloring agents, and in the manufacture of ammonium salts. Later, the term was applied to the partially purified similar products of the action of heat on nitrogenous animal matter generally. Finally, the term was applied to any aqueous solution of ammonia.

== Uses ==
=== Medicine ===
Hartshorn jelly or a decoction of burnt hartshorn in water was used to treat diarrhea. The coal of hartshorn, called calcinated hartshorn, was used as an absorbent, as well as in the treatment of dysentery. &quot;Salt of hartshorn&quot; (ammonium carbonate) was used as a for treatment of fevers, and as a smelling salt. Hartshorn was used to treat insect bites, sunstroke, stye, and snakebites.

===Baking===
&quot;Hartshorn salt&quot;, also known as &quot;hartshorn&quot;, &quot;baker&#x27;s ammonia, ammonium carbonate&quot; and &quot;ammonium bicarbonate&quot; is used as a leavening agent in baked goods in place of yeast, baking soda and baking powder. It was more popular in the 1700s and prior as a forerunner of the modern baking powder but is still used today in traditional German, Swiss, Polish, Dutch and Nordic recipes such as

* amoniaczki and drömmar (Polish and Swedish sugar cookies)
* loftkökur (Icelandic chocolate cookies)
* hafrakex (Icelandic oatmeal cookies)
* Basler Leckerli (Swiss &amp; German citrus gingerbread)
* Biscoff (Dutch, Belgian &amp; German illustrated Christmas cookies, aka windmill cookies or Speculaas) 
* Springerle (German illustrated Christmas crackers)
* lefse (Norwegian tortillas)

A half-teaspoon of hartshorn salt can substitute for one teaspoon of baking powder, and this is commonly done in Americanized recipes. However hartshorn salt is different from baking powder in that the goods baked with hartshorn salt are crispier, retain intricate designs better, and can be kept out in the open air for longer without becoming stale or hard.

Hartshorn salt and freshly-baked goods made from it smell of ammonia. When heated, the ammonia and carbon dioxide gases are released, and the smell eventually dissipates. The use of hartshorn may turn some ingredients green, such as sunflower seeds.

====Safety concerns====
Ammonia released during the baking process reacts with glucose and fructose to form intermediate molecules that in turn, react with asparagine (an amino acid found in nuts, seeds, and whole grains) to form acrylamide, a carcinogen.

<doc id="648959" wikidata="Q5866552" url="?curid=648959" title="History of Somerset">
<text>Somerset is a historic county in the south west of England. There is evidence of human occupation since prehistoric times with hand axes and flint points from the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras, and a range of burial mounds, hill forts and other artefacts dating from the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages. The oldest dated human road work in Great Britain is the Sweet Track, constructed across the Somerset Levels with wooden planks in the 39th century BCE.

Following the Roman Empire&#x27;s invasion of southern Britain, the mining of lead and silver in the Mendip Hills provided a basis for local industry and commerce. Bath became the site of a major Roman fort and city, the remains of which can still be seen. During the Early Medieval period Somerset was the scene of battles between the Anglo-Saxons and first the Britons and later the Danes. In this period it was ruled first by various kings of Wessex, and later by kings of England. Following the defeat of the Anglo-Saxon monarchy by the Normans in 1066, castles were built in Somerset.

Expansion of the population and settlements in the county continued during the Tudor and more recent periods. Agriculture and coal mining expanded until the 18th century, although other industries declined during the industrial revolution. In modern times the population has grown, particularly in the seaside towns, notably Weston-super-Mare. Agriculture continues to be a major business, if no longer a major employer because of mechanisation. Light industries are based in towns such as Bridgwater and Yeovil. The towns of Taunton and Shepton Mallet manufacture cider, although the acreage of apple orchards is less than it once was.

==Palaeolithic and Mesolithic==
The Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods saw hunter-gatherers move into the region of Somerset. There is evidence from flint artefacts in a quarry at Westbury that an ancestor of modern man, possibly Homo heidelbergensis, was present in the area from around 500,000 years ago. There is still some doubt about whether the artefacts are of human origin but they have been dated within Oxygen Isotope Stage 13 (524,000 – 478,000 BP). Other experts suggest that &quot;many of the bone-rich Middle Pleistocene deposits belong to a single but climatically variable interglacial that succeeded the Cromerian, perhaps about 500,000 years ago. Detailed analysis of the origin and modification of the flint artefacts leads to the conclusion that the assemblage was probably a product of geomorphological processes rather than human work, but a single cut-marked bone suggests a human presence.&quot; Animal bones and artefacts unearthed in the 1980s at Westbury-sub-Mendip, in Somerset, have shown evidence of early human activity approximately 700,000 years ago.

&quot;Homo sapiens sapiens&quot;, or modern man, came to Somerset during the Early Upper Palaeolithic. There is evidence of occupation of four Mendip caves 35,000 to 30,000 years ago. During the Last Glacial Maximum, about 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, it is probable that Somerset was deserted as the area experienced tundra conditions. Evidence was found in Gough&#x27;s Cave of deposits of human bone dating from around 12,500 years ago. The bones were defleshed and probably ritually buried though perhaps related to cannibalism being practised in the area at the time or making skull cups or storage containers.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.plosone.org&quot;&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Somerset was one of the first areas of future England settled following the end of Younger Dryas phase of the last ice age c. 8000 BC. Cheddar Man is the name given to the remains of a human male found in Gough&#x27;s Cave in Cheddar Gorge. He is Britain&#x27;s oldest complete human skeleton. The remains date from about 7150 BC, and it appears that he died a violent death. Somerset is thought to have been occupied by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from about 6000 BCE; Mesolithic artefacts have been found in more than 70 locations. Mendip caves were used as burial places, with between 50 and 100 skeletons being found in Aveline&#x27;s Hole. In the Neolithic era, from about 3500 BCE, there is evidence of farming.

At the end of the last ice age the Bristol Channel was dry land, but later the sea level rose, particularly between 1220 and 900 BC and between 800 and 470 BCE, resulting in major coastal changes. The Somerset Levels became flooded, but the dry points such as Glastonbury and Brent Knoll have a long history of settlement, and are known to have been occupied by Mesolithic hunters. The county has prehistoric burial mounds (such as Stoney Littleton Long Barrow), stone rows (such as the circles at Stanton Drew and Priddy) and settlement sites. Evidence of Mesolithic occupation has come both from the upland areas, such as in Mendip caves, and from the low land areas such as the Somerset Levels. Dry points in the latter such as Glastonbury Tor and Brent Knoll, have a long history of settlement with wooden trackways between them. There were also &quot;lake villages&quot; in the marsh such as those at Glastonbury Lake Village and Meare. One of the oldest dated human road work in Britain is the Sweet Track, constructed across the Somerset Levels with wooden planks in the 39th century BC, partially on the route of the even earlier Post Track.

==Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages==
There is evidence of Exmoor&#x27;s human occupation from Mesolithic times onwards. In the Neolithic period people started to manage animals and grow crops on farms cleared from the woodland, rather than act purely as hunter gatherers. It is also likely that extraction and smelting of mineral ores to make tools, weapons, containers and ornaments in bronze and then iron started in the late Neolithic and into the Bronze and Iron Ages.

The caves of the Mendip Hills were settled during the Neolithic period and contain extensive archaeological sites such as those at Cheddar Gorge. There are numerous Iron Age Hill Forts, which were later reused in the Dark Ages, such as Cadbury Castle, Worlebury Camp and Ham Hill. The age of the henge monument at Stanton Drew stone circles is unknown, but is believed to be from the Neolithic period. There is evidence of mining on the Mendip Hills back into the late Bronze Age when there were technological changes in metal working indicated by the use of lead. There are numerous &quot;hill forts&quot;, such as Small Down Knoll, Solsbury Hill, Dolebury Warren and Burledge Hill, which seem to have had domestic purposes, not just a defensive role. They generally seem to have been occupied intermittently from the Bronze Age onward, some, such as Cadbury Camp at South Cadbury, being refurbished during different eras. Battlegore Burial Chamber is a Bronze Age burial chamber at Williton which is composed of three round barrows and possibly a long, chambered barrow.

The Iron Age tribes of later Somerset were the Dobunni in north Somerset, Durotriges in south Somerset and Dumnonii in west Somerset. The first and second produced coins, the finds of which allows their tribal areas to be suggested, but the latter did not. All three had a Celtic culture and language. However, Ptolemy stated that Bath was in the territory of the Belgae, but this may be a mistake. The Celtic gods were worshipped at the temple of Sulis at Bath and possibly the temple on Brean Down. Iron Age sites on the Quantock Hills, include major hill forts at Dowsborough and Ruborough, as well as smaller earthwork enclosures, such as Trendle Ring, Elworthy Barrows and Plainsfield Camp.

==Roman==
Somerset was part of the Roman Empire from 47 AD to about 409 AD. However, the end was not abrupt and elements of Romanitas lingered on for perhaps a century.

Somerset was invaded from the south-east by the Second Legion &quot;Augusta&quot;, under the future emperor Vespasian. The hillforts of the Durotriges at Ham Hill and Cadbury Castle were captured. Ham Hill probably had a temporary Roman occupation.
The massacre at Cadbury Castle seems to have been associated with the later Boudiccan Revolt of 60–61 AD. The county remained part of the Roman Empire until around 409 AD.

The Roman invasion, and possibly the preceding period of involvement in the internal affairs of the south of England, was inspired in part by the potential of the Mendip Hills. A great deal of the attraction of the lead mines may have been the potential for the extraction of silver.

Forts were set up at Bath and Ilchester. The lead and silver mines at Charterhouse in the Mendip Hills were run by the military. The Romans established a defensive boundary along the new military road known the Fosse Way (from the Latin &quot;fossa&quot; meaning &quot;ditch&quot;). The Fosse Way ran through Bath, Shepton Mallet, Ilchester and south-west towards Axminster. The road from Dorchester ran through Yeovil to meet the Fosse Way at Ilchester. Small towns and trading ports were set up, such as Camerton and Combwich. The larger towns decayed in the latter part of the period, though the smaller ones appear to have decayed less. In the latter part of the period, Ilchester seems to have been a &quot;civitas&quot; capital and Bath may also have been one. Particularly to the east of the River Parrett, villas were constructed. However, only a few Roman sites have been found to the west of the river. The villas have produced important mosaics and artifacts. Cemeteries have been found outside the Roman towns of Somerset and by Roman temples such as that at Lamyatt. Romano-British farming settlements, such as those at Catsgore and Sigwells, have been found in Somerset. There was salt production on the Somerset Levels near Highbridge and quarrying took place near Bath, where the Roman Baths gave their name to Bath.

Excavations carried out before the flooding of Chew Valley Lake also uncovered Roman remains, indicating agricultural and industrial activity from the second half of the 1st century until the 3rd century AD. The finds included a moderately large villa at Chew Park, where wooden writing tablets (the first in the UK) with ink writing were found. There is also evidence from the Pagans Hill Roman Temple at Chew Stoke. In October 2001 the West Bagborough Hoard of 4th century Roman silver was discovered in West Bagborough. The 681 coins included two denarii from the early 2nd century and 8 Miliarense and 671 Siliqua all dating to the period AD 337 – 367. The majority were struck in the reigns of emperors Constantius II and Julian and derive from a range of mints including Arles and Lyons in France, Trier in Germany and Rome.

In April 2010, the Frome Hoard, one of the largest-ever hoards of Roman coins discovered in Britain, was found by a metal detectorist. The hoard of 52,500 coins dated from the 3rd century AD and was found buried in a field near Frome, in a jar below the surface. The coins were excavated by archaeologists from the Portable Antiquities Scheme.

==Sub-Roman period==
This is the period from about 409 AD to the start of Saxon political control, which was mainly in the late 7th century, though they are said to have captured the Bath area in 577 AD. Initially the Britons of Somerset seem to have continued much as under the Romans but without the imperial taxation and markets. There was then a period of civil war in Britain though it is not known how this affected Somerset. The Western Wandsdyke may have been constructed in this period but archaeological data shows that it was probably built during the 5th or 6th century. This area became the border between the Romano-British Celts and the West Saxons following the Battle of Deorham in 577 AD. The ditch is on the north side, so presumably it was used by the Celts as a defence against Saxons encroaching from the upper Thames Valley. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the Saxon Cenwalh achieved a breakthrough against the British Celtic tribes, with victories at Bradford-on-Avon (in the &quot;Avon Gap&quot; in the Wansdyke) in 652 AD, and further south at the Battle of Peonnum (at Penselwood) in 658 AD, followed by an advance west through the Polden Hills to the River Parrett.

The Saxon advance from the east seems to have been halted by battles between the British and Saxons, for example; at the siege of Badon Mons Badonicus (which may have been in the Bath region e.g. at Solsbury Hill), or Bathampton Down. During the 5th, 6th and 7th centuries, Somerset was probably partly in the Kingdom of Dumnonia, partly in the land of the Durotriges and partly in that of the Dobunni. The boundaries between these is largely unknown, but may have been similar to those in the Iron Age. Various &quot;tyrants&quot; seem to have controlled territories from reoccupied hill forts. There is evidence of an elite at hill forts such as Cadbury Castle and Cadbury Camp; for example, there is imported pottery. Cemeteries are an important source of evidence for the period and large ones have been found in Somerset, such as that at Cannington, which was used from the Roman to the Saxon period. The towns of Somerset seem to have been little used during that period but there continued to be farming on the villa sites and at the Romano-British villages.

There may have been effects from plague and volcanic eruption during this period as well as marine transgression into the Levels.

The language spoken during this period is thought to be Southwestern Brythonic, but only one or two inscribed stones survive in Somerset from this period. However, a couple of curse tablets found in the baths at Bath may be in this language. Some place names in Somerset seem to be Celtic in origin and may be from this period or earlier, e.g. Tarnock. Some river names, such as Parrett, may be Celtic or pre-Celtic. The religion of the people of Somerset in this period is thought to be Christian but it was isolated from Rome until after the Council of Hertford in 673 AD when Aldhelm was asked to write a letter to Geraint of Dumnonia and his bishops. Some church sites in Somerset are thought to date from this period, e.g., Llantokay Street.

Most of what is known of the history of this period comes from Gildas&#x27;s &quot;On the Ruin of Britain&quot;, which is thought to have been written in Durotrigan territory, possibly at Glastonbury.

The earliest fortification of Taunton started for King Ine of Wessex and Æthelburg, in or about the year 710 AD. However, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle this was destroyed 12 years later.

==Early Medieval==

This is the period from the late 7th century (for most of Somerset) to 1066, though for part of the 10th and 11th centuries England was under Danish control. Somerset, like Dorset to the south, held the West Saxon advance from Wiltshire/Hampshire back for over a century, remaining a frontier between the Saxons and the Romano-British Celts.

The Saxons conquered Bath following the Battle of Deorham in 577, and the border was probably established along the line of the Wansdyke to the north of the Mendip Hills. Then Cenwalh of Wessex broke through at Bradford-on-Avon in 652, and the Battle of Peonnum possibly at Penselwood in 658, advancing west through the Polden Hills to the River Parrett. In 661 the Saxons may have advanced into what is now Devon as a result of a battle fought at Postesburh, possibly Posbury near Crediton.

Then in the period 681–85 Centwine of Wessex conquered King Cadwaladr and &quot;advanced as far as the sea&quot;, but it is not clear where this was. It is assumed that the Saxons occupied the rest of Somerset about this time. The Saxon rule was consolidated under King Ine, who established a fort at Taunton, demolished by his wife in 722. It is sometimes said that he built palaces at Somerton and South Petherton but this does not seem to be the case. He fought against Geraint in 710. In 705 the diocese of Sherborne was formed, taking in Wessex west of Selwood. Saxon kings granted land in Somerset by charter from the 7th century onward. The way and extent to which the Britons survived under the Saxons is a debatable matter. However, King Ine&#x27;s laws make provision for Britons. Somerset originally formed part of Wessex and latter became a separate &quot;shire&quot;. Somersetshire seems to have been formed within Wessex during the 8th century though it is not recorded as a name until later. Mints were set up at times in various places in Somerset in the Saxon period, e.g., Watchet.

Somerset played an important part in defeating the spread of the Danes in the 9th century. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 845 Alderman Eanwulf, with the men of Somersetshire (Sumorsǣte), and Bishop Ealstan, and Alderman Osric, with the men of Dorsetshire, conquered the Danish army at the mouth of the Parret. This was the first known use of the name Somersæte. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that in January 878 the King Alfred the Great fled into the marshes of Somerset from the Viking&#x27;s invasion and made a fort at Athelney. From the fort Alfred was able to organize a resistance using the local militias from Somerset, Wiltshire and Hampshire.

Viking raids took place for instance in 987 and 997 at Watchet and the Battle of Cynwit. King Alfred was driven to seek refuge from the Danes at Athelney before defeating them at the Battle of Ethandun in 878, usually considered to be near Edington, Wiltshire, but possibly the village of Edington in Somerset. Alfred established a series of forts and lookout posts linked by a military road, or Herepath, so his army could cover Viking movements at sea. The Herepath has a characteristic form which is familiar on the Quantocks: a regulation 20 m wide track between avenues of trees growing from hedge laying embankments. The Herepath ran from the ford on the River Parrett at Combwich, past Cannington hill fort to Over Stowey, where it climbed the Quantocks along the line of the current Stowey road, to Crowcombe Park Gate. Then it went south along the ridge, to Triscombe Stone. One branch may have led past Lydeard Hill and Buncombe Hill, back to Alfred&#x27;s base at Athelney. The main branch descended the hills at Triscombe, then along the avenue to Red Post Cross, and west to the Brendon Hills and Exmoor. A peace treaty with the Danes was signed at Wedmore and the Danish king Guthrum the Old was baptised at Aller. &quot;Burhs&quot; (fortified places) had been set up by 919, such as Lyng. The Alfred Jewel, an object about 2.5 inch long, made of filigree gold, cloisonné-enamelled and with a rock crystal covering, was found in 1693 at Petherton Park, North Petherton. Believed to have been owned by Alfred the Great it is thought to have been the handle for a pointer that would have fit into the hole at its base and been used while reading a book.

Monasteries and minster churches were set up all over Somerset, with daughter churches from the minsters in manors. There was a royal palace at Cheddar, which was used at times in the 10th century to host the Witenagemot, and there is likely to have been a &quot;central place&quot; at Somerton, Bath, Glastonbury and Frome since the kings visited them. The towns of Somerset seem to have been in occupation in this period though evidence for this is limited because of subsequent buildings on top of remains from this period. Agriculture flourished in this period, with a re-organisation into centralised villages in the latter part in the east of the county.

In the period before the Norman Conquest, Somerset came under the control of Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and his family. There seems to have been some Danish settlement at Thurloxton and Spaxton, judging from the place-names. After the Norman Conquest, the county was divided into 700 fiefs, and large areas were owned by the crown, with fortifications such as Dunster Castle used for control and defence.

This period of Somerset&#x27;s history is well documented, for example in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; and Asser&#x27;s &quot;Life of Alfred&quot;.

==Later Medieval==

This is the period from 1066 to around 1500. Following the defeat of the Saxons by the Normans in 1066, various castles were set up in Somerset by the new lords such as that at Dunster, and the manors was awarded to followers of William the Conqueror such as William de Moyon and Walter of Douai. Somerset does not seem to have played much part in the civil war in King Stephen&#x27;s time, but Somerset lords were main players in the murder of Thomas Becket.

A good picture of the county in 1086 is given by Domesday Book, though there is some difficulty in identifying the various places since the hundreds are not specified. The total population given for the county, which had different boundaries to those today, was 13,399, however this only included the heads of households, so with their families this may have been around 67,000. Farming seems to have prospered for the next three centuries but was severely hit by the Black Death which in 1348 arrived in Dorset and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread mortality, perhaps as much as 50% in places. It re-occurred, resulting in a change in feudal practices since the manpower was no longer so available.

Reclamation of land from marsh in the Somerset Levels increased, largely under monastic influence. Crafts and industries also flourished, the Somerset woollen industry being one of the largest in England at this time. &quot;New towns&quot; were founded in this period in Somerset, i.e. Newport, but were not successful. Coal mining on the Mendips was an important source of wealth while quarrying also took place, an example is near Bath.

The towns grew, again often by monastic instigation, during this period and fairs were started. The church was very powerful at this period, particularly Glastonbury Abbey. After their church burnt down, the monks there &quot;discovered&quot; the tomb of &quot;King Arthur&quot; and were able rebuild their church. There were over 20 monasteries in Somerset at this period including the priory at Hinton Charterhouse which was founded in 1232 by Ela, Countess of Salisbury who also founded Lacock Abbey. Many parish churches were re-built in this period. Between 1107 and 1129 William Giffard the Chancellor of King Henry I, converted the bishop&#x27;s hall in Taunton into Taunton Castle. Bridgwater Castle was built in 1202 by William Brewer. It passed to the king in 1233 and in 1245 repairs were ordered to its motte and towers. During the 11th century Second Barons&#x27; War against Henry III, Bridgwater was held by the barons against the King. In the English Civil War the town and the castle were held by the Royalists under Colonel Sir Francis Wyndham. Eventually, with many buildings destroyed in the town, the castle and its valuable contents were surrendered to the Parliamentarians. The castle itself was deliberately destroyed in 1645.

During the Middle Ages sheep farming for the wool trade came to dominate the economy of Exmoor. The wool was spun into thread on isolated farms and collected by merchants to be woven, fulled, dyed and finished in thriving towns such as Dunster. The land started to be enclosed and from the 17th century onwards larger estates developed, leading to establishment of areas of large regular shaped fields. During this period a Royal Forest and hunting ground was established, administered by the Warden. The Royal Forest was sold off in 1818.

In the medieval period the River Parrett was used to transport Hamstone from the quarry at Ham Hill, Bridgwater was part of the Port of Bristol until the Port of Bridgwater was created in 1348, covering of the Somerset coast line, from the Devon border to the mouth of the River Axe. Historically, the main port on the river was at Bridgwater; the river being bridged at this point, with the first bridge being constructed in 1200 AD. Quays were built in 1424; with another quay, the &quot;Langport slip&quot;, being built in 1488 upstream of the Town Bridge. A Customs House was sited at Bridgwater, on West Quay; and a dry dock, launching slips and a boat yard on East Quay. The river was navigable, with care, to Bridgwater Town Bridge by vessels. By trans-shipping into barges at the Town Bridge the Parrett was navigable as far as Langport and (via the River Yeo) to Ilchester.

==Early Modern==

This is the period from around 1500 to 1800. In the 1530s, the monasteries were dissolved and their lands bought from the king by various important families in Somerset. By 1539, Glastonbury Abbey was the only monastery left, its abbot Richard Whiting was then arrested and executed on the orders of Thomas Cromwell. From the Tudor to the Georgian times, farming specialised and techniques improved, leading to increases in population, although no new towns seem to have been founded. Large country houses such as at Hinton St George and Montacute House were built at this time.

The Bristol Channel floods of 1607 are believed to have affected large parts of the Somerset Levels with flooding up to above sea level. In 1625, a House of Correction was established in Shepton Mallet and, today, HMP Shepton Mallet is England&#x27;s oldest prison still in use.

During the English Civil War, Somerset was largely Parliamentarian, although Dunster was a Royalist stronghold. The county was the site of important battles between the Royalists and the Parliamentarians, notably the Battle of Lansdowne in 1643 and the Battle of Langport in 1645. The castle changed hands several times during 1642–45 along with the town. During the Siege of Taunton it was defended by Robert Blake, from July 1644 to July 1645. This war resulted in castles being destroyed to prevent their re-use.

In 1685, the Duke of Monmouth led the Monmouth Rebellion in which Somerset people fought against James II. The rebels landed at Lyme Regis and travelled north hoping to capture Bristol and Bath, puritan soldiers damaged the west front of Wells Cathedral, tore lead from the roof to make bullets, broke the windows, smashed the organ and the furnishings, and for a time stabled their horses in the nave. They were defeated in the Battle of Sedgemoor at Westonzoyland, the last battle fought on English soil. The Bloody Assizes which followed saw the losers being sentenced to death or transportation.

The Society of Friends established itself in Street in the mid-17th century, and among the close-knit group of Quaker families were the Clarks: Cyrus started a business in sheepskin rugs, later joined by his brother James, who introduced the production of woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes. C&amp;J Clark still has its headquarters in Street, but shoes are no longer manufactured there. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the United Kingdom.

The 18th century was largely one of peace and declining industrial prosperity in Somerset. The Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and Northern England spelt the end for most of Somerset&#x27;s cottage industries. However, farming continued to flourish, with the Bath and West of England Agricultural Society being founded in 1777 to improve methods. John Billingsley conducted a survey of the county&#x27;s agriculture in 1795 but found that methods could still be improved.

Arthur Wellesley took his title, Duke of Wellington from the town of Wellington. He is commemorated on a nearby hill with a large, spotlit obelisk, known as the Wellington Monument.

In north Somerset, mining in the Somerset coalfield was an important industry, and in an effort to reduce the cost of transporting the coal the Somerset Coal Canal was built; part of it was later converted into a railway. Other canals included the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, Westport Canal, Grand Western Canal, Glastonbury Canal and Chard Canal. The Dorset and Somerset Canal was proposed, but very little of it was ever constructed.

==Late Modern==

The 19th century saw improvements to Somerset&#x27;s roads with the introduction of turnpikes and the building of canals and railways. The usefulness of the canals was short-lived, though they have now been restored for recreation. The railways were nationalised after the Second World War, but continued until 1965, when smaller lines were scrapped; two were transferred back to private ownership as &quot;heritage&quot; lines.

In 1889, Somerset County Council was created, replacing the administrative functions of the Quarter Sessions.

The population of Somerset has continued to grow since 1800, when it was 274,000, particularly in the seaside towns such as Weston-super-Mare. Some population decline occurred earlier in the period in the villages, but this has now been reversed, and by 1951 the population of Somerset was 551,000.

Chard claims to be the birthplace of powered flight, as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian aeronautical pioneer John Stringfellow first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. North Petherton was the first town in England (and one of the few ever) to be lit by acetylene gas lighting, supplied by the &quot;North Petherton Rosco Acetylene Company&quot;. Street lights were provided in 1906. Acetylene was replaced in 1931 by coal gas produced in Bridgwater, as well as by the provision of an electricity supply.

Around the 1860s, at the height of the iron and steel era, a pier and a deep-water dock were built, at Portishead, by the Bristol &amp; Portishead Pier and Railway to accommodate the large ships that had difficulty in reaching Bristol Harbour. The Portishead power stations were coal-fed power stations built next to the dock. Construction work started on Portishead &quot;A&quot; power station in 1926. It began generating electricity in 1929 for the Bristol Corporation&#x27;s Electricity Department. In 1951, Albright and Wilson built a chemical works on the opposite side of the dock from the power stations. The chemical works produced white phosphorus from phosphate rock imported, through the docks, into the UK. The onset of new generating capacity at Pembroke (oil-fired) and Didcot (coal-fired) in the mid-1970s brought about the closure of the older, less efficient &quot;A&quot; Station. The newer of the two power stations (&quot;B&quot; Station) was converted to burn oil when the Somerset coalfields closed. Industrial activities ceased in the dock with the closure of the power stations. The Port of Bristol Authority finally closed the dock in 1992, and it has now been developed into a marina and residential area.

During the First World War hundreds of Somerset soldiers were killed, and war memorials were put up in most of the towns and villages; only a few villages escaped casualties. There were also casualties – though much fewer – during the Second World War, who were added to the memorials. The county was a base for troops preparing for the 1944 D-Day landings, and some Somerset hospitals still date partly from that time. The Royal Ordnance Factory ROF Bridgwater was constructed early in World War II for the Ministry of Supply. It was designed as an Explosive ROF, to produce RDX, which was then a new experimental high-explosive. It obtained water supplies from two sources via the Somerset Levels: the artificial Huntspill River which was dug during the construction of the factory and also from the King&#x27;s Sedgemoor Drain, which was widened at the same time. The Taunton Stop Line was set up to resist a potential German invasion, and the remains of its pill boxes can still be seen, as well as others along the coast. A decoy town was constructed on Black Down, intended to represent the blazing lights of a town which had neglected to follow the black-out regulations. Sites in the county housed Prisoner of War camps including: Norton Fitzwarren, Barwick, Brockley, Goathurst and Wells. Various airfields were built or converted from civilian use including: RNAS Charlton Horethorne (HMS Heron II), RAF Weston-super-Mare, RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron), Yeovil/Westland Airport, RAF Weston Zoyland, RAF Merryfield, RAF Culmhead and RAF Charmy Down.

Exmoor was one of the first British National Parks, designated in 1954, under the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act. and is named after its main river. It was expanded in 1991 and in 1993 Exmoor was designated as an Environmentally Sensitive Area. The Quantock Hills were designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in 1956, the first such designation in England under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The Mendip Hills followed with AONB designation in 1972.

Hinkley Point A nuclear power station was a Magnox power station constructed between 1957 and 1962 and operating until ceasing generation in 2000. Hinkley Point B is an Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) which was designed to generate 1250 MW of electricity (MWe). Construction of Hinkley Point B started in 1967. In September 2008 it was announced, by Électricité de France (EDF), that a third, twin-unit European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) power station known as Hinkley Point C is planned, to replace Hinkley Point B which was due for closure in 2016, but has now has its life extended until 2022.

Somerset today has only two small cities, Bath and Wells, and only small towns in comparison with other areas of England. Tourism is a major source of employment along the coast, and in Bath and Cheddar for example. Other attractions include Exmoor, West Somerset Railway, Haynes Motor Museum and the Fleet Air Arm Museum as well as the churches and the various National Trust and English Heritage properties in Somerset.

Agriculture continues to be a major business, if no longer a major employer because of mechanisation. Light industries take place in towns such as Bridgwater and Yeovil. The towns of Taunton and Shepton Mallet manufacture cider, although the number of apple orchards has reduced.

In the late 19th century the boundaries of Somerset were slightly altered, but the main change came in 1974 when the county of Avon was set up. The northern part of Somerset was removed from the administrative control of Somerset County Council. On abolition of the county of Avon in 1996, these areas became separate administrative authorities, &quot;North Somerset&quot; and &quot;Bath and North East Somerset&quot;. The Department for Communities and Local Government was considering a proposal by Somerset County Council to change Somerset&#x27;s administrative structure by abolishing the five districts to create a Somerset unitary authority. The changes were planned to be implemented no later than 1 April 2009. However, support for the county council&#x27;s bid was not guaranteed and opposition among the district council and local population was strong; 82% of people responding to a referendum organised by the five district councils rejected the proposals. It was confirmed in July 2007 that the government had rejected the proposals for unitary authorities in Somerset, and that the present two-tier arrangements of Somerset County Council and the district councils will remain.

<doc id="648960" wikidata="Q2822789" url="?curid=648960" title="Borrowed chord">
<text>A borrowed chord (also called mode mixture, modal mixture, substituted chord, modal interchange, or mutation) is a chord borrowed from the parallel key (minor or major scale with the same tonic). Borrowed chords are typically used as &quot;color chords&quot;, providing harmonic variety through contrasting scale forms, which are major scales and the three forms of minor scales. Chords may also be borrowed from other parallel modes besides the major and minor mode, for example D Dorian with D major. The mixing of the major and minor modes developed in the Baroque period.

Borrowed chords are distinguished from modulation by being brief enough that the tonic is not lost or displaced, and may be considered brief or transitory modulations and may be distinguished from secondary chords as well as altered chords. According to Sheila Romeo, &quot;[t]he borrowed chord suggests the sound of its own mode without actually switching to that mode.&quot;

== Common borrowed chords ==

Sheila Romeo explains that &quot;[i]n theory, any chord from any mode of the scale of the piece is a potential modal interchange or borrowed chord. Some are used more frequently than others, while some almost never occur.&quot;

In the minor mode, a common borrowed chord from the parallel major key is the Picardy third.

In the major mode, the most common examples of borrowed chords are those involving the , also known as the lowered sixth scale degree. These chords are shown below, in the key of C major.

The next most common involve the and . These chords are shown below.


Chord progressions may be constructed with borrowed chords, including two progressions common in rock music, I–VII–VI–VII, common everywhere, and I–VI–IV (), used by bands like Genesis, Yes, and Nirvana. VII is from Mixolydian and VI is found in both Aeolian and Phrygian. The VII–I cadence with VII substituting for V is common, as well as II–I, III–I, and VI–I. In popular music, the major triads on the lowered third (III), sixth (VI) and seventh (VII) scale degrees are common.

Borrowed chords have typical inversions or common positions, for example ii6 and ii, and progress in the same manner as the diatonic chords they replace except for VI, which progresses to V(7).

<text>Xero (also styled as Zero or Xiro) were an Australian punk rock and new wave band formed in 1978 in Brisbane, Queensland. They were fronted by mainstay member, Irena Luckus on lead vocals, keyboards and guitar before disbanding in 1983.

== History ==

Zero were formed in Brisbane in 1977 with the initial line-up of Peter Adams on guitar and vocals; Chris Anderson on guitar and vocals; Jude Clarkin on bongos; Barbara Hart on saxophone and flute; John Hunt on bass guitar; Irena Luckus on vocals, keyboard and guitar; and Debbie Penny on drums. By 1978, now including Vic Allen, Deborah Thomas and Lindy Morrison, the band travelled across New South Wales by train, playing gigs in Canberra (in a large, very cold hall) and Newcastle (in a local pub). In 1979 the group settled as a four-piece with Luckus, Morrison, John Willsteed and Michael O&#x27;Connell, and among a number of significant gigs, opened for The Cure in support of that group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot;. The Go-Betweens Robert Forster was an occasional guest, and when Morrison left in September 1980 to join Forster and Grant McLennan, O&#x27;Connell also left, moving to Sydney to play in a number of bands. Zero then became Xiro, and decided on the Roland DR-55 as a suitable drummer replacement.

Xiro issued two different four-track extended plays, &quot;Half the Profits&quot; and &quot;Religious Wars&quot;, on audio cassette in mid-1980. They supported The Cure again in 1981, with guest and future Xero drummer Steven Pritchard. Luckus and Willsteed were then joined by Clare McKenna on drums to become Xero and entered a period of intense song-writing in their Fortitude Valley practice rooms, and performing at various Brisbane venues. In 1982 Xero recorded a six-track extended play, &quot;Lust in the Dust&quot;, at Basement Studios, Brisbane with the line-up of Luckus, Tony Childs on bass guitar; John Willsteed on bass guitar, guitar, casio keyboards and vocals; and Steven Pritchard on drums.

Xero split in 1983 when Luckus left Brisbane to relocate to France. Later, Morrison and Willsteed were members of fellow Brisbane group, the Go-Betweens. O&#x27;Connell and Willsteed were both members of the Apartments. They have reformed for gigs since then, initially in 1986.

<text>The Lowndean chair of Astronomy and Geometry is one of the two major Professorships in Astronomy (alongside the Plumian Professorship) and a major Professorship in Mathematics at Cambridge University. It was founded in 1749 by Thomas Lowndes, an astronomer from Overton in Cheshire.

The original bequest stated that the holder must give two courses of twenty lectures each year, one in astronomy, and the other in geometry, and spend at least six weeks making astronomical observations.

Originally the holder was elected by a committee consisting of the Lord Chancellor, the Lord President of the Privy Council, the Lord Privy Seal, the Lord Steward of the Household, and the Lord High Treasurer of the First Lord of the Treasury.

By the 20th century, the electors had changed to comprise the most senior scientists in the United Kingdom: the President of the Royal Society, the President of the Royal Astronomical Society, the Astronomer Royal, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, and the Lucasian, Sadleirian, and Plumian Professors.

Notwithstanding the title, a professor can be chosen who specializes solely or chiefly in only one, rather than both, of the subjects of astronomy and geometry.
