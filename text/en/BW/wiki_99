<text>Linda Darlene Kasabian (; June 21, 1949 – January 21, 2023) was an American woman known for being a member of the Manson Family, a cult led by Charles Manson in late-1960searly-1970s California. She was present at both the Tate–LaBianca murders committed by the cult members in 1969, but received legal immunity for her testimony as a key witness in District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi&#x27;s prosecution of Manson and his followers.

==Early life==
Linda Darlene Drouin was born in Biddeford, Maine, on June 21, 1949, and raised in the New England town of Milford, New Hampshire. Her father, Rosaire Drouin, was a construction worker of French-Canadian ancestry. Her mother, Joyce Taylor, was a homemaker. They struggled financially in a working-class home. Her parents often did not get along, and her father eventually left when she was still a young child. Both of her parents remarried a short time later, and her father moved to Miami, Florida. She was the eldest child, and her mother Joyce has remarked that with so many younger children and stepchildren to care for, she was not able to devote the necessary attention to her teenage daughter. &quot;I didn&#x27;t have time to listen to her problems. A lot of what has happened to Linda is my fault&quot;, she has admitted.

As a child, Kasabian was described by friends, neighbors, and teachers as intelligent, a good student but a &quot;starry-eyed romantic&quot;. She was regarded as kind and shy but &quot;forced to grow up too soon&quot;. She dropped out of high school and ran away from home at the age of sixteen due to conflict with her stepfather, Jake Byrd, whom she claimed mistreated both her and her mother. Kasabian traveled to the West Coast, &quot;looking for God&quot;. At the age of 16, she married Robert Peaslee, a high school classmate, but divorced a short time later. She briefly moved to Miami and tried to reconnect with her father, who was working as a bartender, but they again drifted apart before long. 

She then traveled to Boston, remarried, and gave birth to a daughter in 1968. When her second marriage, to Armenian American Robert Kasabian, began to sour, Linda and her baby daughter Tanya returned to New Hampshire to live with her mother. Later, Robert Kasabian contacted Linda and invited her to meet him in Los Angeles. He wanted her to join him and a friend, Charles &quot;Blackbeard&quot; Melton, on a sailing trip to South America. Linda, who was hoping for a reconciliation with Robert, returned to Los Angeles to live with him in Topanga Canyon.

==Introduction to the Manson Family==

By the time she became pregnant with her second child, Kasabian was feeling neglected by her husband Robert Kasabian, who had ultimately left her behind for the South American sailing trip. Through Melton she met Catherine Share, who told Kasabian about an idyllic ranch outside Los Angeles where a commune of hippies were establishing a &quot;hole in the earth&quot; paradise to escape an anticipated race war which they referred to as &quot;Helter Skelter.&quot; To Kasabian, the ranch situation sounded like the Hopi legends that she had read about as a girl, and she was intrigued. In early summer, 1969, she decided against attending a July 4 Malibu &quot;love-in&quot; and instead—daughter Tanya in tow—joined Share and traveled to the Spahn Ranch in the Chatsworth area outside Los Angeles, where she met Charles Manson and soon became a member of his &quot;Family&quot;.

Kasabian was welcomed by group members, who greeted her with professions of peace and love and assurances that she and her daughter would be cared for, provided she proved loyal. Kasabian became privy to various events and statements that later proved to be important to the criminal case. During her first night with the family, she met and had sexual relations with the high-ranking Manson follower Tex Watson. Both of them have described their initial encounter as very intense. Watson persuaded Kasabian to steal a sum of money from her ex-husband&#x27;s friend, Charles Melton.

Kasabian was then introduced to Manson. According to Kasabian, she thought he looked magnificent in his buckskin clothing, and that he seemed to be Christ-like. Manson talked with her about why she had come to the ranch, and after &quot;feeling her legs&quot;, he accepted her. That night, Manson and Kasabian had sex in a Spahn Ranch cave. She thought that Manson could &quot;see right through her&quot; and that he was perceptive of her issues with her stepfather and her feelings of being &quot;disposable&quot; to the people in her life and to the world in general, as recorded in her trial testimony:

Kasabian claimed she adopted the attitude toward Manson that the other ranch girls held: &quot;We always wanted to do anything and everything for him.&quot; She began joining family members on their &quot;creepy crawls&quot;, quietly sneaking into random homes in Los Angeles to steal money while the occupants slept. These and other criminal activities were the means by which the members of the Manson family supported themselves, and Kasabian was willing to participate.

== Involvement with murders ==

On August 8, 1969, Kasabian claimed Manson directed her to gather a knife, a change of clothing and her driver&#x27;s license, then to accompany three other members of the Manson family, Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, and Patricia Krenwinkel and do what Watson told her to. They drove to 10050 Cielo Drive. Kasabian stated she saw Watson shoot and kill Steven Parent, a teenager who had come to visit the caretaker, William Garettson. Watson then ordered Kasabian to remain outside the residence, and she stood by the car while Watson, Atkins, and Krenwinkel entered the house and killed Jay Sebring, Wojciech Frykowski, Abigail Folger, and the eight-months pregnant Sharon Tate.

Kasabian testified that at one point she heard the &quot;horrible screams&quot; of the victims and left the car. &quot;I started to run toward the house, I wanted them to stop. I knew what they had done to that man [Parent], that they were killing these people. I wanted them to stop.&quot; Approaching the house from the driveway, Kasabian was met by Frykowski, who was running out the front door. Kasabian said in her testimony, &quot;There was a man just coming out of the door and he had blood all over his face and he was standing by a post, and we looked into each other&#x27;s eyes for a minute, and I said, &#x27;Oh, God, I am so sorry. Please make it stop.&#x27; But then he just fell to the ground into the bushes.&quot; Then Watson repeatedly stabbed Frykowski and hit him in the head with a gun butt. Kasabian tried to stop the murderers by claiming that she heard &quot;people coming&quot; onto the Tate property, but Atkins insisted that it was &quot;too late&quot;. According to Watson and Atkins, Kasabian stood rooted to the front lawn, watching with a horrified expression as her companions committed murder. Kasabian testified that, while in a state of shock, she ran toward the car, started it up, and considered driving away to get help, but then became concerned for her daughter back at the Spahn Ranch.

The next night, Manson, Leslie Van Houten, and Clem Grogan joined the quartet because, according to Kasabian, Manson felt the deed the night before had been performed sloppily. They drove to the LaBianca residence. Inside, Watson, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten murdered Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. When asked why she went out with the group again, knowing this time that murders would occur, Kasabian claimed that when Manson asked her to go with them she was &quot;afraid to say no.&quot;

==Witness for the prosecution==
Several members of the &quot;family&quot; were arrested following a raid on the Spahn Ranch in October for car theft. The police were not aware at that time that those whom they were arresting for auto theft were the murderers of Sharon Tate and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. The investigations of these were already in progress, along with the intensive news media coverage of the murders. After being informed that a warrant for her arrest had been issued, Kasabian turned herself in to New Hampshire authorities in early December. Kasabian was offered immunity from prosecution in exchange for turning state&#x27;s evidence.

There have been reports that Kasabian wanted to tell her story to the prosecutors, with or without any kind of deal, to &quot;get it out of my head&quot;, as chief prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi described it, but that her attorney, Gary Fleischman, insisted that she remain silent until the district attorney made an offer of immunity. Kasabian, who was then pregnant with her second child, agreed to the immunity offer.

However, though Kasabian had been an accomplice to the murders (their driver and lookout), and she had not prevented the crimes or contacted the police or the sheriff afterwards, she had not entered either residence nor was she thought to have physically participated in any of the murders. She had been described as reluctant and extremely upset during the events of both nights, even challenging Manson (&quot;Charlie, I am not you, I cannot kill anybody.&quot;) and she was the only member of the group to express remorse and sympathy for the victims. When taken back to the Tate residence to help reconstruct the crime there, Kasabian reportedly suffered an emotional breakdown.

Taking the witness stand, Kasabian was the chief witness for the prosecution, and she tearfully recounted the murders in vivid detail. She related to the trial jury all that she had seen and heard during her stay with the Manson family and during the commission of the murders. Her testimony was considered to be the most dramatic segment of the very long trial, and it received an unprecedented amount of news media coverage. During the trial, unjailed members of the Manson family led a campaign of intimidation against Kasabian in an effort to prevent her from testifying. The actual defendants in the crime constantly disrupted her testimony with a blizzard of dramatic courtroom theatrics. Manson ran a finger across his throat, glaring at Kasabian as she testified, an act he repeated during the testimony of other prosecution witnesses.

Susan Atkins also repeatedly whispered to Kasabian across the courtroom, &quot;You&#x27;re killing us!&quot; to which Kasabian responded, &quot;I am not killing you, you have killed yourselves.&quot; Manson notoriously interrupted Kasabian&#x27;s testimony by holding up a copy of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; newspaper to the jury with the headline &quot;Manson Guilty, Nixon Declares&quot; referring to President Richard Nixon&#x27;s statements to the press about the pre-verdict trial. He apparently hoped that this stunt would result in a mistrial, which the defense argued for but lost. Judge Charles H. Older refused to allow the defendants to legally benefit from the antics.

During Kasabian&#x27;s cross-examination, Manson&#x27;s defense lawyer Irving Kanarek showed her large color crime-scene photographs of the Tate murders. Kasabian&#x27;s emotional reaction was in stark contrast to the other Family members. Manson and Krenwinkel&#x27;s defense attorney Paul Fitzgerald later asserted that Kanarek&#x27;s tactic—meant to discredit Kasabian—was a grave error that completely backfired and exonerated the state&#x27;s primary witness. Composing herself enough to look up from the color photo of the dead, bloodied Sharon Tate, Kasabian shot a look across the courtroom to the defendants. &quot;How could you do that?&quot; she asked. The female defendants laughed. Manson&#x27;s defense attorney Kanarek asked Kasabian how she could be so certain, considering her LSD use, that she had not participated in the gruesome act. &quot;Because I don&#x27;t have that kind of thing in me, to do something so animalistic&quot;, she replied.

Although the Manson Family murder trials lasted nine months, with testimony from numerous witnesses (including several other former Family members), Kasabian&#x27;s testimony more than anything else, according to Bugliosi, led to the convictions of Manson, Watson, Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten.

===Penalty phase===
On January 25, 1971, the defendants were found guilty on all counts by the jury, leading to the penalty phase of the trial, which decided the punishments of the convicted. Various female witnesses, including the defendants and other loyal Family members (all of whom carved bloody Xs into their foreheads as a sign of their allegiance to Manson), testified that Kasabian, rather than Manson, had masterminded the crimes. The trial jury completely rejected their testimony. Over the years, these accusations have been publicly repudiated by many of the former Family members who originally offered the tale, including Catherine Share (in 1997), Susan Atkins (in 1977), and particularly Tex Watson, who in 1978 described those allegations as &quot;patently ridiculous.&quot;

==Life after trial==
The news media coverage of the Manson trial had made Linda Kasabian a well-known figure by the time the sentences had been handed down, with opinions about her ranging from sympathetic to hostile. Kasabian shortly returned to New Hampshire with her husband and her children, seeking to escape the glare of the media and raise her children quietly. She lived on a commune of hippies for a time and later worked as a cook. Kasabian was called back to Los Angeles County several times after the first trial: she was a witness against Tex Watson in his separate trial in 1971 and also against Leslie Van Houten in her two retrials in 1977.

Kasabian was later detained for numerous traffic violations until an automobile accident left her partially disabled. Though she had severed all of her ties with the Manson family, the Secret Service kept her under surveillance for a time after Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme, another former Manson associate, attempted to assassinate U.S. President Gerald Ford in 1975. Kasabian was the target of scorn from the few remaining Family members.

Over the years, Kasabian avoided and refused most news media attention. Her only appearance between 1969 and 2008 was an interview with the syndicated American television program &quot;A Current Affair&quot; in 1988.

Later, Cineflix, a production company in the United Kingdom and Canada, produced a docu-drama called &quot;Manson&quot;, in which Kasabian appeared, telling her story in complete detail for the first time. This program was broadcast in the UK on August 10, 2009 and also in the United States on September 7, 2009 and again on July 20, 2013 on the History Channel. In this interview, Kasabian recounts her four weeks spent with the Manson &quot;family.&quot;

In a September 2, 2009, live interview on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, Kasabian recounted her memories of the murders at Sharon Tate&#x27;s home. To help her maintain her now-quiet life, Kasabian wore a disguise provided by the program. She told Larry King during the interview that after the trial she had been in need of, but had never obtained, &quot;psychological counseling&quot; and that during the previous 12 years, she had been &quot;on a path of healing and rehabilitation&quot;. When asked about the degree of remorse she felt for her participation in the crimes, Kasabian said she felt as though she took on all the guilt that &quot;no one else [who was involved in the crimes] felt guilt for.&quot;

From the late 1980s, Kasabian lived in the Tacoma, Washington area, using the last name &quot;Chiochios&quot;. In a 2016 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article on the current status of Manson Family members still living, it was said she had been &quot;living in near-poverty&quot;. In his 2016 book &quot;Sharon Tate and the Manson Murders&quot;, author Greg King recounted an October 1996 police raid by the Tacoma, Washington police department where Kasabian and her daughter, Quanu, had been arrested after &quot;rock cocaine and a large bundle of cash in a dresser drawer&quot; were discovered along with a semi-automatic handgun and ammunition. According to King, Kasabian&#x27;s daughter was tried and found guilty of possession of controlled substances and sentenced to serve time in a Washington state prison.

Kasabian died in Tacoma on January 21, 2023, at the age of 73.

<doc id="659190" wikidata="Q430297" url="?curid=659190" title="Fixed stars">
<text>In astronomy, the fixed stars () are the luminary points, mainly stars, that appear not to move relative to one another against the darkness of the night sky in the background. This is in contrast to those lights visible to naked eye, namely planets and comets, that appear to move slowly among those &quot;fixed&quot; stars. The fixed stars includes all the stars visible to the naked eye other than the Sun, as well as the faint band of the Milky Way. Due to their star-like appearance when viewed with the naked eye, the few visible individual nebulae and other deep-sky objects also are counted among the fixed stars. Approximately 6,000 stars are visible to the naked eye under optimal conditions.

The term &quot;fixed stars&quot; is a misnomer because those celestial objects are not actually fixed with respect to one another or to Earth. Due to their immense distance from Earth, these objects appear to move so slowly in the sky that the change in their relative positions is nearly imperceptible on human timescales, except under careful examination with modern instruments, such as telescopes, that can reveal their proper motions. Hence, they can be considered to be &quot;fixed&quot; for many purposes, such as navigation, charting of stars, astrometry, and timekeeping.

Due to the large distances of astronomical objects, human vision is unable to perceive the three-dimensional depth of outer space, giving the impression that all stars and other extrasolar objects are equidistant from the observer. In the astronomical tradition of Aristotelian physics which spanned from ancient Greece to early scientific Europe, the fixed stars were believed to exist attached on a giant celestial sphere, or firmament, which revolves daily around Earth. Hence it was known as the &quot;sphere of fixed stars&quot;, which acted as the supposed limit of the whole universe. For many centuries, the term &quot;fixed stars&quot; was a synonym for that celestial sphere.

Many ancient cultures observed new stars now called novas, which provided some clue the heavens were not completely unchanging, but as novae fade in few weeks or months, the phenomenon was not understood then, as well as of comets. In European scientific astronomy, evidence that disproved the firmament was gathered gradually. The Copernican Revolution of the 1540s fueled the idea held by some philosophers in ancient Greece and the Islamic world that stars were actually other suns, possibly with their own planets. The definitive discovery of proper motion was announced in 1718, and parallax was suspected in the 1670s but shown definitively in the 1830s. Other cultures (such as Chinese astronomy) either never had a belief in a sphere of fixed stars, or constructed it in different ways. (See .)

People in many cultures have imagined that the brightest stars form constellations, which are apparent pictures in the sky seeming to be persistent, being deemed also as &quot;fixed&quot;. That way, constellations have been used for centuries, and still are today, to identify regions of the night sky by both professional and amateur astronomers.

== Astronomical models which included fixed stars ==

=== Pythagoreans ===
Pythagorean philosophers held a number of different views on the structure of the universe, but each included a sphere of fixed stars as its boundary. Philolaos (c. 5th cent. BC) proposed a universe which had at its center a central fire, invisible to man. All of the planets, the Moon, Sun, and stars rotated about this central fire, with the Earth being the nearest object to it. In this system, the stars are contained in the furthest sphere, which also rotates, but too slowly for motion to be observed. The motion of the stars is instead explained by the motion of the Earth about the central fire.

Another Pythagorean, Ecphantos of Syracuse (c. 400 BC) proposed a system quite similar to that of Philolaos, but without a central fire. Instead, this cosmos was centered on the Earth, which remained stationary but rotated on an axis, while the Moon, Sun, and planets revolved about it. This system&#x27;s final boundary was a fixed sphere of stars, and the perceived motion of the stars was thought to be caused by the rotation of the Earth.

=== Plato ===
Plato&#x27;s (c. 429-347 BC) universe was centered on a completely stationary Earth, constructed with a series of concentric spheres. The outer sphere of this system consisted of fire and contained all of the planets (which according to Plato, included the Moon and Sun). The outermost portion of this sphere was the location of the stars. This sphere of fire rotated about the Earth, carrying the stars with it. The belief that the stars were fixed in their place in the sphere of fire was of great importance to all of Plato&#x27;s system. The stars&#x27; position was used as a reference for all celestial motions and used to create Plato&#x27;s ideas of planets possessing multiple motions.

=== Eudoxus of Cnidus ===
Eudoxus, a student of Plato, was born around 400 BC. A mathematician and an astronomer, he generated one of the earliest sphere-centric models of the planet systems, based on his background as a mathematician. Eudoxus&#x27;s model was geocentric, with the Earth being a stationary sphere at the center of the system, surrounded by 27 rotating spheres. The farthest sphere carried stars, which he declared to be fixed within the sphere. Thus, though the stars were moved around the Earth by the sphere which they occupied, they themselves did not move and were therefore considered fixed.

=== Aristotle ===
Aristotle, who lived from 384 to 322 BC studied and published similar ideas to Plato, and based on the Eudoxus&#x27; system, but he improved on them through his books &quot;Metaphysics&quot; and &quot;On the Heavens&quot; written around 350 BC. He claimed that all things have some way of moving, (including &quot;heavenly bodies,&quot; or planets,) but he denies that the movement could be caused by a vacuum, because then the objects would move much too fast and without sensible directions. He stated that everything was moved by something and started exploring a concept similar to gravity. He was one of the first to argue (and prove) that the Earth was round, drawing on observations of eclipses and the movements of the other planets relative to the Earth. He proceeded to conclude that most planets navigated in a circular motion.

His cosmos was geocentric, with the Earth at the center, surrounded by a layer of water and air, which was in turn surrounded by a layer of fire which filled the space until reaching the Moon. Aristotle also proposed a fifth element called &quot;aether,&quot; which is purported to make up the Sun, the planets, and the stars. However, Aristotle believed that while the planets rotate, the stars still remain fixed. His argument was that if such a massive body was moving, there must surely be evidence that is noticeable from the Earth. However, one cannot hear the stars moving, nor can they really see their progress, so Aristotle concludes that while they may be shifted by the planets, they do not move themselves. He writes in &quot;On the Heavens&quot;, &quot;If the bodies of the stars moved in a quantity either of air or of fire...the noise which they created would inevitably be tremendous, and this being so, it would reach and shatter things here on earth&quot;. His theory that the stars may be carried but were fixed and do not autonomously move or rotate was widely accepted for a time.

=== Aristarchus of Samos ===
Aristarchus (3rd cent. BC), proposed an early heliocentric universe, which would later inspire the work of Copernicus. In his model, the Sun, entirely stationary, laid at the center, and all planets revolved around it. Beyond the planets was the sphere of fixed stars, also motionless. This system presented two more unique ideas in addition to being heliocentric: the Earth rotated daily to create day, night, and the perceived motions of the other heavenly bodies, and the sphere of fixed stars at its boundary were immensely distant from its center. This massive distance had to be assumed due to the fact that stars were observed to have no parallax, which can only be explained by geocentricity or immense distances which create a parallax too small to be measured.

=== Claudius Ptolemy ===
Ptolemy, 100-175 AD, summarized ideas about the cosmos through his mathematical models and his book &quot;Mathematical Syntaxis&quot;, much more commonly known as the &quot;Almagest.&quot; It was written around 150 AD, and Ptolemy declared that the stars&#x27; placement in relation to each other and distances apart remained unchanged by the rotation of the heavens. He utilized a method using eclipses to find the star distances and calculated the distance of the Moon based on parallax observations. Shortly after, he wrote a follow-up called &quot;Planetary Hypotheses.&quot;

Ptolemy used and wrote about the geocentric system, drawing greatly on traditional Aristotelian physics, but using more complicated devices, known as deferent and epicycles he borrowed from previous works by geometer Apollonius of Perga and astronomer Hipparchus of Nicaea. He declared that the stars are fixed within their celestial spheres, but the spheres themselves are not fixed. The rotations of these spheres thus explain the subtle movements of the constellations throughout the year.

=== Martianus Capella ===
Martianus Capella (fl. c. 410–420) describes a modified geocentric model, in which the Earth is at rest in the center of the universe and circled by the Moon, the Sun, three planets and the stars, while Mercury and Venus circle the Sun, all surrounded by the sphere of fixed stars.
His model was not widely accepted, despite his authority; he was one of the earliest developers of the system of the seven liberal arts, the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy), that structured early medieval education. Nonetheless, his single encyclopedic work, &quot;De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii&quot; (&quot;On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury&quot;), also called &quot;De septem disciplinis&quot; (&quot;On the seven disciplines&quot;) was read, taught, and commented upon throughout the early Middle Ages and shaped European education during the early medieval period and the Carolingian Renaissance.

=== Nicolaus Copernicus ===
Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) created a heliocentric system composed of orbs carrying each of the heavenly bodies. The final orb in his model was that of the fixed stars. This final orb was the largest of his cosmos, in both diameter and thickness. This orb of stars is entirely fixed, as the stars are embedded in the sphere, and the sphere itself is immobile. The perceived motion of the stars, therefore, is created by the daily rotation of the Earth about its axis.

=== Tycho Brahe ===
Tycho Brahe&#x27;s (1546-1601) system of the universe has been called &quot;geo-heliocentric&quot; due to its twofold structure. At its center lies the stationary Earth, which is orbited by the Moon and Sun. The planets then revolve about the Sun while it revolves about the Earth. Beyond all of these heavenly bodies lies a sphere of fixed stars. This sphere rotates about the stationary Earth, creating the perceived motion of the stars in the sky. This system has an interesting feature in that the Sun and planets cannot be contained in solid orbs (their orbs would collide), but yet the stars are represented as being contained in a fixed sphere at the boundary of the cosmos.

=== Johannes Kepler ===
Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) was a devoted Copernican, following Copernicus&#x27;s models and ideas yet developing them. He was also an assistant of Tycho Brahe, and he could access his patron&#x27;s accurate measurements in his observational database. Kepler&#x27;s &quot;Mysterium cosmographicum&quot; (1596), a strong defense of the Copernican system, still pictures an image labelling the outmost celestial sphere as &quot;Sphaera Stellar Fixar&quot;, Latin for sphere of fixed stars, following the long-held belief in such sphere.

This view was later superseded in his book &quot;Astronomia nova&quot; (1609), where he established his laws of planetary motion, the mathematical basis for his own &quot;Rudolphine Tables&quot;, which are working tables from which planetary positions could be shown. Kepler&#x27;s laws were the tipping point in finally disproving the old geocentric (or Ptolemaic) cosmic theories and models, what was backed by the first uses of telescope by his contemporary Galileo Galilei, also an advocate of Copernicus.

== Estimated radius ==
First Greeks, as many other ancient cultures, thought of sky as it was a giant dome-like structure only a few meters above the highest mountains. The myth of Atlas tells that this Titan held the whole heavens on his shoulders.

Around 560 BC, Anaximander was the first to present a system where the celestial bodies turned at different distances. But erroneously, he thought the stars were closer to Earth (about 9 to 10 times the Earth&#x27;s size) than the Moon (18-19 times) and the Sun (27-28 times). Nonetheless, later Pythagorians as Philolaus around 400 BC, also conceived a universe with orbiting bodies, thus assuming the fixed stars were, at least, a bit farther than the Moon, the Sun and the rest of the planets.

Meanwhile, circa 450 BC Anaxagoras was the first philosopher to consider the Sun as a huge object (larger than the land of Peloponnesus), and consequently, to realize how far from Earth it might be. He had suggested that the Moon is rocky, thus opaque, and closer to the Earth than the Sun, giving a correct explanation of eclipses. As far as the Sun and the Moon were conceived as spherical bodies, and as they do not collide at solar eclipses, this implies than the outer space should have some certain, indeterminate, depth.

Eudoxus of Cnidus, in around 380 BC, devised a geometric-mathematical model for the movements of the planets based on (conceptual) concentric spheres centered on Earth, and by 360 BC Plato claimed in his &quot;Timaeus&quot; that circles and spheres were the preferred shape of the universe, and that the Earth was at the centre and the stars forming the outermost shell, followed by planets, the Sun, and the Moon.

Around 350 BC Aristotle modified Eudoxus&#x27; model by supposing the spheres were material and crystalline. He was able to articulate the spheres for most planets, however, the spheres for Jupiter and Saturn crossed each other. Aristotle solved this complication by introducing an unrolled sphere. By all these devices, and even assuming the planets were star-like, single points, the sphere of the fixed stars should implicitly be farther than previously thought.

Around 280 BC, Aristarchus of Samos offered the first definite discussion of the possibility of a heliocentric cosmos, and by geometrical means he estimated the Moon&#x27;s orbital radius at 60 Earth radii, and its physical radius as one-third that of the Earth. He made an inaccurate attempt to measure the distance to the Sun, but sufficient to assert that the Sun is much bigger than Earth and it is much further away than the Moon. So the minor body, the Earth, must orbit the major one, the Sun, and not the opposite. This reasoning led him to assert that, as stars do not show evident parallax viewed from Earth along a single year, they must be very, very far away from the terrestrial surface and, assuming they were all at the same distance from us, he gave a relative estimation.

Following the heliocentric ideas of Aristarcus (but not explicitly supporting them), around 250 BC Archimedes in his work &quot;The Sand Reckoner&quot; computes the diameter of the universe centered around the Sun to be about (in modern units, about 2 light years, , ).

In Archimedes&#x27; own words:

Around 210 BC, Apollonius of Perga shows the equivalence of two descriptions of the apparent retrograde motions of planets (assuming the geocentric model): one using eccentrics and another deferent and epicycles.

In the following century, measures of the sizes and distances of the Earth and the Moon improved. Around 200 BC Eratosthenes determined that the radius of the Earth is roughly . Circa 150 BC Hipparchus used parallax to determine that the distance to the Moon is roughly , nearly matching Aristarchus. This imposed a minimum radius for the sphere of fixed stars at center-to-center Earth to Moon distance plus the Moon&#x27;s radius (approx. 1/3 Earth radius), plus the width of the Sun (it being, at least, the same that the Moon), plus the indeterminate thickness of the planets&#x27; spheres (believed to be thin, anyway), for a total about . This was around 24,500,000 times lower than Archimedes&#x27; computation.
Around 130 AD, Ptolemy adopted Apollonius&#x27; epicycles in his geocentric model. Epicycles are described as an orbit within an orbit. For example, looking at Venus, Ptolemy claimed that it orbits the Earth, and as it orbits the Earth, it also orbits the original orbit riding a second, minor local sphere. (Ptolemy emphasised that the epicycle motion does not apply to the Sun.) This device necessarily enlarges each of the celestial spheres, thus making the outer sphere of the fixed stars yet larger.

When scholars applied Ptolemy&#x27;s epicycles, they presumed that each planetary sphere was exactly thick enough to accommodate them. By combining this nested sphere model with astronomical observations, scholars calculated what became generally accepted values at the time for the distances to the Sun: about , and to the edge of the universe: about , still around 130,000 times less than Archimedes.

Ptolemy&#x27;s methods, written in his &quot;Almagest&quot;, were accurate enough to keep them largely undisputed for more than 1,500 years. But by the European Renaissance, the possibility that such a huge sphere could complete a single revolution of 360° around the Earth in only 24 hours was deemed improbable, and this point was one of the arguments of Nicholas Copernicus for leaving behind the centuries-old geocentric model.

The highest upper bound ever given was by Jewish astronomer Levi ben Gershon (Gersonides) who, circa 1300, estimated the distance to the fixed stars to be no less than 159,651,513,380,944 Earth radii, or about 100,000 light-years in modern units. This was an overestimate; although in the actual universe there are stars farther than that distance, both in the Milky Way (about three times wider) and all the external galaxies, the closest star from Earth (other than the Sun) is Proxima Centauri at about 4.25 light-years only.

==In other cultures==
===In Nordic mythology===
The attempts to explain the universe stem from observations of the objects found in the sky. Different cultures historically have various stories to provide an answer to the questions of what they are seeing. Norse mythology originates from northern Europe, around the geographical location of modern-day region of Scandinavia and northern Germany. The Norse mythology consists of tales and myths derived from Old Norse, which was a Northern German language from the Middle Ages. There is a series of manuscript texts written in Old Norse which contain a collection of [35] poems written from oral tradition. Among historians there seems to be speculation of the specific dates of the poems written, however, the estimated record of the texts is around the beginning of the thirteenth century. Although the oral tradition of passing down tales existed long before the advent of text manuscripts and print versions.

Among surviving texts there is mention of the mythological god, Odin. Scholars have recounted the tale of the Αesir Gods creation myth which includes the idea of fixed stars found within the teleology of the tale. Padaric Colum has written a book, &quot;The Children of Odin&quot;, which in much detail reiterates the story of how the Aesir gods brought the giant named Ymir to his demise and created the world from his body, affixing sparks from the fiery Muspelheim, or the &quot;fixed stars,&quot; to the dome of the sky, which was the skull of Ymir. The Norse creation myth is one of several cases which treated stars as being fixed to a sphere beyond the earth. Later scientific literature shows astronomical thought which kept a version of this idea until the seventeenth century.

== Developing western astronomy ==

Western astronomical knowledge was based on the traditional thoughts from philosophical and observational inquiries of Greek Antiquity. Other cultures contributed to thought about the fixed stars including the Babylonians, who from the eighteenth to the sixth century BC constructed constellation maps. Maps of the stars and the idea of mythological stories to explain them were largely being acquired all over the world and in several cultures. One similarity between them all was the preliminary understanding that the stars were fixed and immobile in the universe.

This understanding was incorporated into theorized models and mathematical representations of the cosmos by philosophers like Anaximander and Aristotle from the Ancient Greeks. Anaximander proposed this original (and erroneous) order of the celestial objects above the Earth: first a nearest layer with the fixed stars plus planets, then another layer with the Moon, and finally an outer one with the Sun. To him, the &quot;stars&quot;, as well as the Sun and Moon, were apertures of &quot;wheel-like condensations filled with fire&quot;. All other later models of the planetary system show a celestial sphere containing fixed stars on the outermost part of the universe, its edge, within it lie all the rest of the moving luminaires.

Plato, Aristotle and other like Greek thinkers of antiquity, and later the Ptolemaic model of the cosmos showed an Earth-centered universe. Ptolemy was influential with his heavily mathematical work, the &quot;Almagest&quot;, which attempts to explain the peculiarity of stars that moved. These &quot;wandering stars&quot;, planets, moved across the background of fixed stars which were spread along a sphere surrounding encompassing the universe. This geocentric view was held through the Middle Ages, and was later countered by subsequent astronomers and mathematicians alike, such as Nicolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler, who challenged the long-standing view of geocentrism and constructed a Sun-centered universe, this being known as the heliocentric system. The tradition of thought which appears in all of these systems of the universe, even with their divergent mechanisms, is the presence of the sphere of fixed stars.
In the sixteenth century, a number of writers inspired by Copernicus, such as Thomas Digges, Giordano Bruno and William Gilbert argued for an indefinitely extended or even infinite universe, with other stars as distant suns, paving the way to deprecate the Aristotelian sphere of the fixed stars. (This was a revival of beliefs held by Democritus, Epicurus, and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi).

The studies of the heavens were revolutionized with the invention of the telescope. First developed in 1608, Galileo Galilei heard about it and made a telescope for himself. He immediately noticed that the planets were not, in fact, perfectly smooth, a theory formerly put forth by Aristotle. He continued to examine the skies and constellations and soon knew that the &quot;fixed stars&quot; which had been studied and mapped were only a tiny portion of the massive universe that lay beyond the reach of the naked eye. When in 1610 he aimed his telescope to the faint strip of the Milky Way, he found it resolves into countless white star-like spots, presumably farther stars themselves.

The development of Isaac Newton&#x27;s laws, published in his work &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; in 1687, raised further questions among theorists about the mechanisms of the heavens: the universal force of gravity suggested that stars could not simply be fixed or at rest, as their gravitational pulls cause &quot;mutual attraction&quot; and therefore cause them to move in relation to each other.

The term &quot;Solar System&quot; entered the English language by 1704, when John Locke used it to refer to the Sun, planets, and comets as a whole. By then it had been established beyond doubt, thanks to increased telescopic observations plus Keplerian and Newtonian celestial mechanics, that planets are other worlds, and stars are other distant suns, so the whole Solar System is actually only a small part of an immensely large universe, and definitively something distinct.

==&quot;Fixed stars&quot; not fixed==

Astronomers and natural philosophers before divided the lights in the sky into two groups. One group contained the &quot;fixed stars&quot;, which appear to rise and set but keep the same relative arrangement over time, and show no evident stellar parallax, which is a change in apparent position caused by the orbital motion of the Earth. The other group contained the naked eye planets, which they called &quot;wandering stars&quot;. (The Sun and Moon were sometimes called stars and planets as well.) The planets seem to move forward and back, changing their position over short periods of time (weeks or months). They always seem to move within the band of stars called the zodiac by Westerners. The planets can also be distinguished from fixed stars because stars tend to twinkle, while planets appear to shine with a steady light.

However, fixed stars show parallax. It can be used to find the distance to nearby stars. This motion is only apparent; it is the Earth that moves. This effect was small enough not to be accurately measured until the 19th century, but from about 1670 and onward, astronomers such as Jean Picard, Robert Hooke, John Flamsteed, and others began detecting motion from the stars and attempting measurements. These movements amounted to significant, if almost imperceptibly small, fractions. The first successful stellar parallax measurements were done by Thomas Henderson in Cape Town, South Africa from 1832 to 1833, where he measured the parallax of and distance to one of the closest stars ― Alpha Centauri. Henderson did not publish these observations until 1839, after Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel published his parallax observations and distance estimate to 61 Cygni in 1838. 

The fixed stars exhibit real motion as well, however. This motion may be viewed as having components that consist in part of motion of the galaxy to which the star belongs, in part of rotation of that galaxy, and in part of motion peculiar to the star itself within its galaxy. In the case of star systems or star clusters, the individual components even move with respect to each other in a non-linear manner.

Relative to the Solar System, this real motion of a star is divided into &quot;radial&quot; motion and &quot;proper motion&quot;, with &quot;proper motion&quot; being the component across the line of sight. In 1718 Edmund Halley announced his discovery that the fixed stars actually have proper motion. Proper motion was not noticed by ancient cultures because it requires precise measurements over long periods of time to notice. In fact, the night sky today looks very much as it did thousands of years ago, so much so that some modern constellations were first named by the Babylonians.

A typical method to determine proper motion is to measure the position of a star relative to a limited, selected set of very distant objects that exhibit no mutual movement, and that, because of their distance, are assumed to have very small proper motion. Another approach is to compare photographs of a star at different times against a large background of more distant objects. The star with the largest known proper motion is Barnard&#x27;s Star.

Radial velocity of stars, and other deep-space objects, can be revealed spectroscopically thru the Doppler-Fizeau effect, by which the frequency of the received light decreases for objects that were receding (redshift) and increases for objects that were approaching (blueshift), when compared to the light emitted by a stationary object. William Huggins ventured in 1868 to estimate the radial velocity of Sirius with respect to the Sun, based on observed redshift of the star&#x27;s light.

The phrase &quot;fixed star&quot; is technically incorrect, but nonetheless it is used in an historical context, and in classical mechanics. When used as a visual reference for observations, they usually are called background stars or simply distant stars, still retaining the intuitive meaning of they being &quot;fixed&quot; in some practical sense.

==In classical mechanics==

In Newton&#x27;s time the fixed stars were invoked as a reference frame supposedly at rest relative to absolute space. In other reference frames either at rest with respect to the fixed stars or in uniform translation relative to these stars, Newton&#x27;s laws of motion were supposed to hold. In contrast, in frames accelerating with respect to the fixed stars, in particular frames rotating relative to the fixed stars, the laws of motion did not hold in their simplest form, but had to be supplemented by the addition of fictitious forces, for example, the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force.

As we now know, the fixed stars are not &quot;fixed&quot;. The concept of inertial frames of reference is no longer tied to either the fixed stars or to absolute space. Rather, the identification of an inertial frame is based upon the simplicity of the laws of physics in the frame, in particular, the absence of fictitious forces.

Law of inertia holds for Galilean coordinate system which is a hypothetical system relative to which fixed stars remain fixed.

== In relational mechanics ==
:&quot;References for this section:&quot;

Fixed stars can be observed outside the view of classical mechanics and the view of relational mechanics. Relational quantum mechanics is a field theory that is a part of classical mechanics that dictates only the evolution of distances between particles and not their motion. The formation of this field theory gives solutions to the criticisms made by Leibniz and Mach of Newton&#x27;s mechanics. As Newton relied on absolute space, relational mechanics does not. Describing fixed stars in terms of relational mechanics agrees with Newtonian mechanics.

The use of privileged frames (Newtonian Frame) allows for the observation of Keplerian orbits for the motion of the planets; however, the observation of individual evolutions does not hold value in relational mechanics. An individual evolution can be distorted by changing the frame to which the position and velocity of an individual evolution are considered not observable. The observables in relational mechanics are the distance between the particles and the angles of the straight lines that joins the particles. Relational equations deal with the evolution of observation variables because they are independent of frames and can calculate a given evolution of distances that individual evolutions can describe from different frames. This can only mean that gauge symmetry employs mechanics with the essential relational feature that Leibniz claimed.

Leibniz and Mach criticized the use of absolute space to validate Newtonian frames. Leibniz believed in the relation of the bodies as opposed to individual evolutions relative to metaphysically defined frames. Mach would criticize Newton&#x27;s concept of absolute acceleration, stating that the shape of the water only proves the rotation with respect to the rest of the universe. Mach&#x27;s criticism was later taken up by Einstein, stating &quot;Mach&#x27;s principle,&quot; the idea that inertia is determined by the interaction with the rest of the universe. Relational mechanics can be referred to as a Machian theory.

The reformation of mechanics in the 20th century was ripe with relational principles. The laws of mechanics combine potential and kinetic variables, which in this case, the potential is already relational because it contains distances between the particles. The Newtonian kinetic energy contained individual velocities that were attempted to be reformulated into relative velocities and the possibility of distances. However, these attempts led to many opposing concepts to inertia that were not supported, to which many agreed that the basic premise of Newtonian kinetic energy should be preserved.

The evolution of distances between particles does not require inertial frames to show themselves but instead uses them as coordinates for particles. The two different laws of mechanics are conceptually different. An example would be the isolation of a subsystem where Newton&#x27;s law would describe its evolution in terms of absolute, initial, and final conditions. Relational mechanics would describe its evolution in terms of internal and external distances, so even if the system is &quot;isolated,&quot; its evolution will always be described by the relation of the subsystem to the rest of the universe.

<doc id="659194" wikidata="Q6205032" url="?curid=659194" title="Jeremy Taylor (singer)">
<text>Jeremy Taylor (born 24 November 1937 in Newbury, Berkshire) is a retired English folk singer and songwriter who has spent much of his life in South Africa, originally as a teacher of English at St. Martin&#x27;s School, Rosettenville in southern Johannesburg. Since 1994, he has lived in Wales and France. After attending the University of Oxford, Taylor became a folk singer in South Africa, remembered for his single &quot;Ag Pleez Deddy&quot;.

Much of his success came from songs that started in live performances, incorporating comedy. Taylor performed songs that questioned social problems in apartheid South Africa.

== Musical career ==

=== South Africa ===
Taylor began performing in clubs and coffee-bars such as the &quot;Cul de Sac&quot; in Hillbrow, Johannesburg in the 1960s, and succeeded with the comedic song &quot;The Ballad of the Southern Suburbs&quot; [of Johannesburg], also known as &quot;Ag Pleez Deddy&quot;, in 1962. The song, written for the stage show &quot;Wait a Minim!,&quot; was a surprise hit. In performance in Chicago, he explained that while teaching South African children English, he was &quot;enchanted&quot; by their patois and their lust for American and European consumer products like Pepsi Cola, Canada Dry, Eskimo Pie, popcorn and chewing gum, and films like &quot;Tarzan&quot;.

Taylor mimicked their accent in the song, in which a child begs his father to take him to different places and buy these treats. It was frowned upon by parents and the government because the song mixed English and Afrikaans – a practice of which the Nationalist government disapproved, feeling all languages should be kept &quot;pure&quot;. This was one reason Taylor was required to leave the country. This mixing of languages led to Taylor&#x27;s songwriting being described as &quot;doing for South African English what [David] Kramer was doing for Afrikaans&quot;.

However, it remained popular with children in South Africa, selling more than any Elvis Presley single in South Africa. Also in the early sixties he contributed to the successful musical revue &quot;Wait a Minim!&quot;, performing several of his own compositions. His archival material was donated to the Hidden Years Music Archive preserved by the Documentation Centre for Music, Stellenbosch University, in 2017.

=== Folk music ===
After returning to Britain in 1964 to perform in &quot;Wait a Minim!&quot; in the West End, he joined the British folk music circuit and appeared on television. Later in the 1960s, he taught at Eton College while a political exile.

Taylor had his own series of six folk-style shows entitled &quot;Jeremy Taylor&quot;, supported by the house band Telephone Bill and the Smooth Operators, broadcast between 15 May and 19 June 1980 from the BBC Television Theatre, London. The guests included Barbara Dickson, Alan Price, Spike Milligan, Kenny Baker, Pam Ayres, Peter Skellern and Isla St Clair. After befriending folk-rock singer-songwriter Cat Stevens, and his friend and guitarist, Alun Davies, Taylor helped Stevens translate one of his songs, &quot;O Caritas&quot;, into Latin for an album, &quot;Catch Bull at Four&quot;. One of Taylor&#x27;s albums was produced by Davies. Davies guested on a couple of the songs, but was uncomfortable with playing two roles on another person&#x27;s album, saying to &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;You can&#x27;t put yourself in two places at once and get the best results.&quot;

== Popular work ==

Some of Taylor&#x27;s popular songs are: &quot;Jobsworth&quot;, &quot;Huberta, the hippopotamus&quot;, &quot;The Pot Song&quot;, &quot;Mrs Harris&quot; and &quot;Prawns in the Game&quot;. His &quot;Piece of Ground&quot; was recorded in the United States by Miriam Makeba. However, his albums never reached most of the American music audience.

He was a long-term collaborator and performer with Spike Milligan, and recorded a live album with him entitled &quot;Spike Milligan and Jeremy Taylor: An Adult Entertainment&quot;. This was recorded at Cambridge University on 2 December 1973 and released as a double LP entitled &quot;Spike Milligan with Jeremy Taylor Live at Cambridge University&quot;. It was later re-issued as a two-CD set.

He continued to write songs and perform into the 21st century, in the United Kingdom, France and in the United States. In 2005 he recorded an album in Chicago, &quot;Live in Chicago&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Benham&quot; (Destroyer No. 49/DD-49) was an built for the United States Navy prior to the American entry into World War I. The ship was the first U.S. Navy vessel named in honor of Rear Admiral Andrew E. K. Benham.

&quot;Benham&quot; was laid down by William Cramp &amp; Sons of Philadelphia in March 1912 and launched in March 1913. The ship was a little more than in length, just over abeam, and had a standard displacement of . She was armed with four guns and had eight 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes. &quot;Benham&quot; was powered by a pair of steam turbines that propelled her at up to .

After her January 1914 commissioning, she assisted her sister ship when that ship suffered an explosion in one of her fire rooms in April. After a period in reserve, &quot;Benham&quot; served on Neutrality Patrol duty. As a part of that duty in October 1916, she was one of several U.S. destroyers sent to rescue survivors from five victims of German submarine off the Lightship Nantucket. She picked up officers and crew from a Dutch cargo ship before the U-boat sank it. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, &quot;Benham&quot; was sent overseas to patrol the Irish Sea out of :Queenstown, Ireland. &quot;Benham&quot; made several unsuccessful attacks on U-boats. During her overseas service, &quot;Benham&quot; was rammed by and nearly sunk.

Upon returning to the United States after the war in January 1919, &quot;Benham&quot; was placed in reduced commission. After alternating periods of activity and time in reserve, &quot;Benham&quot; was decommissioned at Philadelphia in July 1922. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in March 1935 and ordered scrapped in April.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Benham&quot; was authorized in March 1911 as the third of four ships of the , which was almost identical to the s authorized at the same time. Construction of the vessel—like her three sister ships—was awarded to William Cramp &amp; Sons of Philadelphia which laid down her keel on 14 March 1912. On 22 March 1913, &quot;Benham&quot; was launched by sponsor Edith Wallace Benham, daughter of the ship&#x27;s namesake, Andrew Ellicot Kennedy Benham. The ship was the first U.S. Navy vessel named in honor of the American admiral. As built, the destroyer was in length, abeam, and drew . The ship had a standard displacement of and displaced when fully loaded.

&quot;Benham&quot; had two steam turbines that drove her two screw propellers, and an additional pair triple-expansion steam engines, each connected to one of the propeller shafts, for cruising purposes. Four oil-burning boilers powered the engines, which could generate , moving the ship at the design speed of ; &quot;Benham&quot; exceeded her contracted speed in her trials in December 1913, when she averaged over five runs off the Delaware Breakwater.

&quot;Benham&quot;″s main battery consisted of four /50 caliber Mark 9 guns, with each gun weighing in excess of . The guns fired armor-piercing projectiles at . At an elevation of 20°, the guns had a range of . In early 1917, &quot;Benham&quot;″s single guns were replaced with twin guns on an experimental basis. However, before &quot;Benham&quot; departed for overseas service during World War I, her original single gun mounts had been restored. &quot;Benham&quot; was also equipped with four twin mount torpedo tubes.

==Pre-World War I==
USS &quot;Benham&quot; was commissioned into the U.S. Navy on 20 January 1914. In February and March, &quot;Benham&quot; conducted a shakedown cruise to the West Indies and, in April, began operations out of Hampton Roads, Virginia. On 6 April, &quot;Benham&quot; and sister ships and were exercising off the North Carolina coast, about off the Diamond Shoals lightship. An explosion ripped through the forward fire room on &quot;Aylwin&quot;, injuring three men. &quot;Benham&quot; loaded the three wounded sailors and sped to the naval hospital at Norfolk, Virginia, while &quot;Parker&quot; took on the remainder of &quot;Aylwin&quot;″s crew. One of the injured men died on &quot;Benham&quot; before landfall was made in Virginia; another died a short time later. &quot;Aylwin&quot; remained afloat but, unmanned, was towed into Norfolk by &quot;Parker&quot; and U.S. Navy tug . The crews of all three destroyers raised $250 to help defray funeral expenses for the widow of one of the men. In July, the &quot;Benham&quot; went into reserve at the New York Navy Yard. She came back into active service on 21 December 1914.

In August 1916, the U.S. Navy conducted what &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the &quot;greatest war game undertaken by the American Navy.&quot; In the scenario, a &#x27;Blue&#x27; force defended the East Coast of the United States against a &#x27;Red&#x27; force attempting an amphibious landing. &quot;Benham&quot;, scouting for the Blue force, was the first to spot the inbound Red transports and their escorts, but an attack on the transports by the Red force was repulsed, leading to a Blue victory.

Prior to the entrance of the United States into World War I, she served on Neutrality Patrol duty, trying to protect American and neutral-flagged merchant ships from interference by British or German warships and U-boats. In the course of performing those duties, &quot;Benham&quot; was at Newport, Rhode Island, in early October 1916. At 05:30 on 8 October, wireless reports came in of a German submarine stopping ships near the Lightship Nantucket, off the eastern end of Long Island. After an SOS from the British steamship &quot;West Point&quot; was received at about 12:30, Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves ordered &quot;Benham&quot; and other destroyers at Newport to attend to survivors. The American destroyers arrived on the scene about 17:00 when the U-boat, under the command of &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Hans Rose, was in the process of stopping the Holland America Line cargo ship . Shortly after, &quot;U-53&quot; stopped the British passenger ship . As Rose had done with three other ships &quot;U-53&quot; had sunk earlier in the day, he gave passengers and crew aboard &quot;Blommersdijk&quot; and &quot;Stephano&quot; adequate time to abandon the ships before sinking the pair. In total, 226 survivors from &quot;U-53&quot;″s five victims were rescued by the destroyer flotilla. &quot;Benham&quot; picked up the captain of and crewmen from &quot;Blommersdijk&quot; for transport to Newport.

==World War I==
After the United States entered World War I on 6 April 1917, &quot;Benham&quot; was one of the first group of destroyers chosen for anti-submarine duty in European waters. She departed Tompkinsville, New York on 17 May and arrived in Queenstown, Ireland on 24 May. Four days later, the destroyer began the first of many tours of duty at sea hunting U-boats and shepherding convoys to their destinations.

Her first encounter with U-boats came on 13 July when she was apparently attacked by two submarines. They launched a total of three torpedoes at &quot;Benham&quot;, but she and her convoy evaded them. The destroyer then drove them away with a depth charge attack. On 30 July, while she was on her way to Queenstown, the destroyer spied the wake of another torpedo some from her. Immediately, she charged to the attack with guns and depth charges. Later, her crew sighted air bubbles and oil on the surface. The British Admiralty commended her for probable damage to a German U-boat. The destroyer continued her patrols out of Queenstown until June 1918 when she moved to Brest, France, her base of operations through the end of the war.

In September 1917, during her European wartime service, &quot;Benham&quot; was rammed by the British HMS &quot;Zinnia&quot;. The event is not mentioned in the &quot;Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships&quot;; the extent of the damage to both ships is unknown.
A photograph from the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Naval History &amp; Heritage Command website shows a nearly sunken &quot;Benham&quot; moored between two ships.

==Postwar==
On 21 December 1918, &quot;Benham&quot; put to sea from Brest for the last time and began the voyage back to the United States. Rejoining the Atlantic Fleet at the beginning of 1919, the warship participated in the annual fleet maneuvers held in Cuban waters and then made a cruise to the Azores in May. Upon her return to the United States that summer, she was placed in ordinary at Norfolk on 28 June. Active again in 1921, she patrolled the eastern seaboard until assigned duty as plane guard and tender to the Atlantic Fleet Air Squadrons. That duty terminated in May 1922, and she stood into Philadelphia on 12 May to prepare for inactivation.

&quot;Benham&quot; was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 7 July 1922. The ship was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 8 March 1935, and, on 23 April, was ordered scrapped at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.

<text>Justin Matthew King CBE (born 17 May 1961) is an English businessman. He was the CEO of J Sainsbury plc, parent company of the supermarket chain Sainsbury&#x27;s, for ten years before stepping down in July 2014.

King was previously Director of Food at Marks and Spencer and has held senior positions at Asda. King was involved in the introduction of Häagen-Dazs ice cream to the UK and has worked for Pepsi-Cola International and Mars.

==Early life==
Raised in Dorridge just outside Solihull, the son of a petrochemical company salesman, he was schooled at Tudor Grange Grammar School (grammar school which became a comprehensive whilst he attended) in Solihull.

King undertook a degree in Business Administration at the University of Bath, graduating in 1983.

In 2009, he was also awarded an Honorary DBA (Doctor of Business Administration) from the University of Bath.

==Career==
After graduating, King went to work for Mars, becoming production shift manager on Galaxy chocolate.

King joined PepsiCo from 1989, being based in the Middle East, then moved to Grand Metropolitan in 1990, where he helped launch Häagen-Dazs ice-cream in the UK as managing director. He moved to Asda in 1994 and became managing director of the hypermarkets division. King moved to Marks &amp; Spencer in 2001, where he managed the M &amp; S food division.

===Sainsbury&#x27;s===
King joined Sainsbury&#x27;s on 29 March 2004, and was seen as the company&#x27;s last chance to win back market share from its rivals and remain independent – the previous CEO, Sir Peter Davis, failed to halt the supermarket&#x27;s slide in market position despite a £3 billion investment in infrastructure. He was offered £675,000 a year salary. King&#x27;s annual salary at Sainsbury&#x27;s was £900,000, coupled with a bonus package between £3-£6million annually.

Shortly after joining Sainsbury&#x27;s, King authorised the removal of the Colleague Christmas Bonus award. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported: &quot;The new chief executive of ailing supermarket chain J Sainsbury ran into his first controversy yesterday as it emerged that he has been awarded free shares worth more than £500,000 in the same week as he has axed the £100 Christmas bonus paid to staff.&quot; The removal of the bonus was a contentious issue, given its consistent payment for 25 years and also given that this was the year Sir Peter Davis received disputed bonus payments.

In October 2004, King launched his recovery programme for the company under the banner &quot;Making Sainsbury&#x27;s Great Again&quot;. In January 2008 Sainsbury&#x27;s announced twelve consecutive quarters of sales growth and achieved its target to grow sales by £2.5 billion, 3 months ahead of schedule.

In September 2005, in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; King discussed the dominance of principal rival Tesco. While steering clear of calls for a Competition Commission inquiry into the No.1 UK supermarket, King did call for changes in planning laws to prevent Tesco from achieving a 40% market share. As of 2005 Tesco had more potential development projects than that of Sainsbury, Asda and Morrisons combined. King also criticised Tesco CEO Terry Leahy for questioning the accuracy of Taylor Nelson Sofres market data. Leahy has argued that TNS overestimates the size of his company&#x27;s market share.

He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to the retail industry.

King announced in January 2014 that he would be leaving his post as CEO in July 2014, with the company&#x27;s Group Commercial Director Mike Coupe being announced as his successor.

===Manor Racing===

In March 2015, King was appointed interim chairman of the Manor Marussia F1 Team later Manor Racing.

==Personal life==
He lives in the village of Harbury, just south of Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. A self-admitted petrol-head, King traded his Maserati Quattroporte for a Lexus LS600h L in March 2008 on environmental grounds.

King is an ambassador for The Scout Association. In 2007, he received an honorary doctorate from Bournemouth University.

In April 2011, King gave half his shares in Sainsbury&#x27;s to his wife Claire for &quot;financial planning purposes&quot;. She divorced him three months later, after 21 years of marriage.

Their son Jordan King is a racing driver, who competed in Formula Three and in Formula 2 until moving to the IndyCar Series for 2018.

<text>Tektronix, Inc., historically widely known as Tek, is an American company best known for manufacturing test and measurement devices such as oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and video and mobile test protocol equipment. Originally an independent company, it is now a subsidiary of Fortive, a spinoff from Danaher Corporation.

== History ==
=== 1946–1954 ===

The company traces its roots to the electronics revolution that immediately followed World War II. It was founded in December 1945 as Tekrad. The name was similar to that of a California company, Techrad, so in 1946, the four partners, Howard Vollum, Jack Murdock and Miles Tippery, who had both served in the Coast Guard, and accountant Glenn McDowell, formed Tektronix, Inc. Each contributed an initial $2,600 for equal shares.

Howard Vollum had graduated in 1936 from Reed College with a degree in physics and a keen interest in oscilloscopes, then worked as a radio technician at Jack Murdock&#x27;s Murdock Radio and Appliance Company (M.J. Murdock Company) prior to the outbreak of war, during which he served in the Signal Corps. Following the founding of Tektronix, Vollum invented the world&#x27;s first triggered oscilloscope in 1946, a significant technological breakthrough. This oscilloscope—refined and developed by Tektronix—was the model 511 produced from 1947 to 1953. The model 511 was a triggered-sweep oscilloscope. The first oscilloscope with a true time-base was the Tektronix Model 513.

The leading oscilloscope manufacturer at the time was DuMont Laboratories. DuMont pioneered the frequency-synch trigger and sweep. Allen DuMont personally tried the 511 at an electronics show and was impressed, but when he saw the price of $795 (equivalent to $ today), which was about twice as much as his equivalent model, he told Howard Vollum at the show that they would have a hard time selling many.

Tektronix was incorporated in 1946 with its headquarters at SE Foster Road and SE 59th Avenue in Portland, Oregon, just six blocks from Murdock&#x27;s first family home. In 1947 there were 12 employees. Four years later, in 1951, Tektronix had 250 employees. Murdock and Vollum were known humanitarians and sought to operate their business as one might run a large and caring family. In 1978, Tektronix was named by authors Robert Levering and Milton Moskowitz, et al., as among &quot;The 100 best companies to work for in America&quot; in their book of the same name.

By 1950, the company began building a manufacturing facility in Washington County, Oregon, at Barnes Road and the Sunset Highway and, by 1956, had expanded the facility to . The company then moved its headquarters to this site, following an employee vote.

A detailed story of Howard Vollum and Jack Murdock along with the products that made Tektronix a leader in oscilloscopes can be found at the Museum of Vintage Tektronix Equipment.

=== 1955–1969 ===
In 1956, a large property in Beaverton became available, and the company&#x27;s employee retirement trust purchased the land and leased it back to the company. Construction began in 1957 and on May 1, 1959, Tektronix moved into its new Beaverton headquarters campus, on a site which came to be called the Tektronix Industrial Park.
In the late 1950s (1957–58), Tektronix set a new trend in oscilloscope applications that would continue into the 1980s. This was the introduction of the plug-in oscilloscope. Starting with the 530 and 540 series oscilloscopes, the operator could switch in different horizontal sweep or vertical input plug-ins. This allowed the oscilloscope to be an adaptable test instrument. Later Tektronix added plug-ins to have the scope operate as a spectrum analyzer, waveform sampler, cable tester and transistor curve tracer. The 530 and 540 series also ushered in the delayed trigger, allowing to trigger between a sweep rather than at the beginning. This allows more stable triggering and better waveform reproduction.

In 1961, Tektronix sold its first (possibly the world&#x27;s first practical) completely portable oscilloscope, the model 321. This oscilloscope could run on AC line (power mains) or on rechargeable batteries. It also brought the oscilloscope into the transistor age (only a Nuvistor ceramic tube was used for the vertical amp input). A year and a half later, the all-transistor model 321A came out.

The 560 series introduced the rectangular CRT to oscilloscopes. In 1964 Tektronix made an oscilloscope breakthrough: the world&#x27;s first mass-produced analog storage oscilloscope, the model 564. Hughes Aircraft Company is credited with the first working storage oscilloscope (the model 104D) but it was made in very small numbers and is extremely rare today.

In 1966, Tektronix brought out a line of high-frequency full-function oscilloscopes called the 400 series. The oscilloscopes were packed with features for field work applications. These scopes were outstanding performers often preferred over their laboratory bench models. The first models were the 422, a 16 MHz bandwidth and the 453, a 50 MHz bandwidth model. The following year the 454, a 150 MHz portable. These models put Tektronix well ahead of their competitors for years. The US military contracted with Tektronix for a model 453 &quot;ruggedized&quot; for field servicing. The 400 series models would continue to be popular choices in the 1970s and &#x27;80s. In addition the styling of the 400 series would be copied by Tektronix&#x27;s competitors. 400 series oscilloscopes were still being used as of 2013.

=== 1970–1985 ===

The company&#x27;s initial public offering, when it publicly sold its first shares of stock, was on September 11, 1963. In 1974, the company acquired in Wilsonville, Oregon where it built a facility for its imaging group. By 1976, the company employed nearly 10,000, and was the state&#x27;s largest employer. Tektronix&#x27;s 1956 expansion and, in 1962, Electro Scientific Industries&#x27; similar move to Washington County and expansion are credited with fostering the development of a large high-tech industry in Washington County, a number of firms which collectively are often referred to as the &quot;Silicon Forest&quot;.

For many years, Tektronix was the major electronics manufacturer in Oregon, and in 1981, its U.S. payroll peaked at over 24,000 employees. Tektronix also had operations in Europe, South America and Asia. European factories were located in Saint Peter&#x27;s, Guernsey (then in the European Free Trade Association) until 1990, Hoddesdon (Hertfordshire, UK) and Heerenveen, Netherlands (then in the European Common Market). Some oscilloscopes marketed in Europe and the UK were sold under the brand name Telequipment but many in the UK used the Tektronix brand name in the 1960s and &#x27;70s.

For many years, Tektronix operated in Japan as Sony-Tektronix, a 50-50 joint venture of Sony Corporation and Tektronix, Inc; this was due to Japanese trade restrictions at the time. Since then, Tektronix has bought out Sony&#x27;s share and is now the sole owner of the Japanese operation. Under the Sony-Tektronix name, the 300 series oscilloscopes were lightweight and totally portable. They replaced the model 321/321A oscilloscopes. Examples of the Sony/Tektronix models were 314, 323, 335 and 370.
During the early 1970s, Tektronix made a major design change to their oscilloscopes. The 5000 and 7000 series oscilloscopes maintained the plug-in capabilities that originally started with the 530 and 540 series; however, the choice of plug-ins was even greater. These scopes used custom designed integrated circuits fabricated by Tektronix. The CRTs were all rectangular and were all fabricated by Tektronix. These oscilloscopes provided on screen controls setting. The 5000 series was the general purpose line while the 7000 series were capable of a wide variety of applications and could accept as many as 4 plug-ins. One model, the 7104 (introduced 1978), was a true 1 GHz bandwidth oscilloscope.
Beginning with the firm&#x27;s first cathode ray oscilloscopes, Tektronix has enjoyed a leading position in the test and measurement market. Although its equipment was expensive, it had performance, quality, and stability. Most test equipment manufacturers built their oscilloscopes with off-the-shelf, generally available components. But Tektronix, in order to gain an extra measure of performance, used many custom-designed or specially-selected components. They even had their own factory for making ultra-bright and sharp CRT tubes. Later on, they built their own integrated circuit manufacturing facility in order to make custom ICs for their equipment.

Tektronix instruments contributed significantly to the development of computers, test, and telecommunications equipment and to the advancement of research and development in the high-technology electronics industry generally.

As time went on, Tektronix fabricated more and more of their electronic parts. This led to very specialized skills and talents which in time led to employees forming new businesses. Some former Tektronix employees left to create other successful &quot;Silicon Forest&quot; companies. Spin-offs include Mentor Graphics, Planar Systems, Floating Point Systems, Cascade Microtech, Merix Corporation, Anthro Corporation and Northwest Instrument Systems (NWIS) – later renamed to MicroCase. Even some of the spin-offs have created spin-offs, such as InFocus. As Tektronix fabricated more specialized parts, they spread out their product base to include logic analyzers, digital multimeters and signal generators. The TM500 and TM5000 rack mount series was born featuring custom designed test instruments chosen by the buyer.

During this period, Tektronix acquired what were sold as the 8000 and 8002 Microprocessor Development System (MDS), the 8000 being a software development system running editors and cross-compilers with twin floppy disk storage, while the 8002 could be fitted with real-time emulators for several processors including the 8080, Z80 and 6502. These were later replaced by the 8540/8550/8560. The 8550 was a standalone development system capable of being fitted with real time emulation hardware for several different processors. The 8560 emerged just after Bell Labs were able to sell UNIX commercially, and ran a mildly modified version of Version 7 UNIX, called TNIX, supporting 4 or 8 (depending on how many I/O processor cards were fitted) serial terminals, with a special High-Speed Input/Output, based on RS-422, to connect to a remote 8540. There was a hard drive of about 34MB, later increased, and a variable amount of RAM depending on the processor card fitted, which was either a DEC LSI11-23+ or a LSI11-73, which had a wider address bus as well as a higher clock speed. The final upgraded variant was the 8562. The 8540, of which several could be connected to the 8560, contained emulation hardware similar to that available for the 8550, including RAM cards, Trigger Trace Analyser, 1 or 2 processor emulator cards, each with external probe, etc. The 8540 had no software development capability, but worked with the 8560, or other systems such as a VAX, which would provide the software development environment. It was unique in its day, in that the serial terminal could be connected to the 8540, on the bench, or to the 8560, and would pass UNIX commands automatically to the 8560, which passed emulator commands back to the 8540 for execution, completely transparently. Thus a complete compile, link, load and emulate session could be run from a UNIX shell script, a facility probably not seen on any development system since. The 8540/8550/8560 supported many 8-bit and 16-bit microprocessor types, with a change of emulator cards and probes, and installation of assembler and possibly compiler software, and did not require any particular code to be linked in to the user&#x27;s code to facilitate register tracing at breakpoints, a shortcoming of the only real alternative multi-manufacturer MDS of that era, by HP. However, an impressive feature was that by including a special instruction sequence, typically a double NOP followed by a call to a specific address, the emulator would generate a &quot;Service Call&quot; to take whatever action the user required, and continue execution. This for example could allow UNIX to write variables to a log file as commanded by the running program on the emulated microprocessor.

It is not clear at present why Tektronix eventually withdrew from the MDS business, as their products were highly regarded.

=== 1986–2006 ===

Tektronix began to face big challenges to its business structure. In the 1980s, Tektronix found itself distracted with too many divisions in too many markets. This led to decreasing earnings in almost every quarter. A period of layoffs, top management changes and sell-offs followed. In 1994, Tektronix spun off its printed circuit board manufacturing operation as a separate company, Merix Corp., headquartered in Forest Grove, Oregon.
Eventually, Tektronix was left with its original test and measurement equipment. Upon his promotion in 2000, the current CEO, Richard H. &quot;Rick&quot; Wills, carefully limited corporate spending in the face of the collapsing high-tech bubble. This led the way for Tektronix to emerge as one of the largest companies in its product niche, with a market capitalization of $3 billion as of April 2006. However, this failed to prevent it from becoming an acquisition target, and Tektronix was acquired by Danaher Corporation in 2007.

With the advancement in signal sampling techniques and digital processing, oscilloscope manufacturers found a new horizon in the market: the ability to sample the signal and digitize it for real time viewing or digitally store it for future use and maintain the integrity of the waveform. In addition a computer can be integrated with the scope to store many waveforms or instruct the scope to do further analysis. Color-enhanced waveforms can be produced for ease in identification.

Tektronix was heavily involved with designing digital sampling oscilloscopes. In the mid-1980s, they quickly replaced their analog oscilloscopes. Their 400, 5000 and 7000 series oscilloscopes were replaced with a new generation of digital oscilloscopes with storage capability, the 11000 and TDS series. The 11000 series were large rack mount laboratory models with large a flat CRT face and had touch screen, multiple color, and multiwaveform display capability. They were still plug-in units and could accept the older 7000 series 7- plug-ins and the new 11000 series 11A- plug-ins. The TDS series replaced the 300 and 400 series portable line. They had the same panel layout but with enhanced storage and measuring capabilities. During this period Tektronix would also expand its test equipment line to logic analyzers, signal generators etc.

By the mid-1990s the use of the CRT was dropped and Tektronix started using LCD panels for display. The 11000 series would be replaced by the MSO (Mixed Signal Oscilloscope) which featured a color active matrix LCD. The TDS continued but with LCD panels starting with the TDS-210. In the TDS models, the lower priced models replaced the last of the 2000 series analog scopes and featured monochrome display while the higher end models were color LCD models which were more like the older 400 series scopes in performance. Spinoffs of the TDS was the TBS storage scope series. Later Tektronix would replace the 200 mini oscilloscopes with the TH series hand held digital oscilloscopes. All TDS and spinoff series with LCD display are totally portable (light weight and can run AC or on batteries).

=== 2007–present ===
On November 21, 2007, Tektronix was acquired by Danaher Corporation for . Prior to the acquisition, Tektronix traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &quot;TEK&quot;, the nickname by which Tektronix is known to its employees, customers, and neighbors. On October 15, 2007, Danaher Corporation tendered an offer to acquire Tektronix for cash a share, which equated to a valuation of approximately . The deal closed five and a half weeks later, with 90 percent of TEK shares being sold in the tender offer.
Also, as part of its acquisition by Danaher, the Communications Business division of Tektronix was spun off into a separate business entity under Danaher, Tektronix Communications.

The digital oscilloscope line that was introduced in the 1990s (MSO, TDS, TH series) are still being manufactured in some form.

On February 1, 2016, Tektronix introduced a new logo design, replacing a logo that had been in use since 1992, and indicated a shift in strategy to offer measurement products tailored for specific fields such as computing, communications and automotive. Danaher spun off several subsidiaries, including Tektronix, in 2016 to create Fortive.

Tektronix Video, commonly known for their waveform monitors, was merged with Telestream via an agreement with Fortive on April 25, 2019.

Production of oscilloscopes has moved to China in recent years.

<text>The Academy of the Hebrew Language (, &quot;ha-akademyah la-lashon ha-ivrit&quot;) was established by the Israeli government in 1953 as the &quot;supreme institution for scholarship on the Hebrew language in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem of Givat Ram campus.&quot;

Its stated aims are to assemble and research the Hebrew language in all its layers throughout the ages; to investigate the origin and development of the Hebrew tongue; and to direct the course of development of Hebrew, in all areas, including vocabulary, grammar, writing, spelling, and transliteration.

Since 2022, the Academy has been headed by Aharon Maman. It is composed of 42 members, in addition to having members who serve as academic advisors, as well as honorary members. Every person is entitled to query the Academy on language matters and to receive a formal reply.

==History==

The Academy replaced the Hebrew Language Committee (&quot;Vaʻad ha-lashon ha-ʻIvrit&quot;) established in 1890 by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, who was its first president. As Hebrew became the spoken language in Palestine and was adopted by the educational system, the Hebrew Language Committee published bulletins and dictionaries. It coined thousands of words that are in everyday use today.

Its successor, the Academy of the Hebrew Language, has continued this mission of creating new Hebrew words to keep up modern usage.

Although the academy&#x27;s business is creating new words from Hebrew roots and structures to replace loanwords derived from other languages, its own name is a loanword, &quot;akademya.&quot; It addresses this irony on its English website.

The Academy&#x27;s mission, as defined in its constitution, is &quot;to direct the development of Hebrew in light of its nature&quot; (). The Academy sets standards for modern Hebrew grammar, orthography, transliteration, and punctuation based on the historical development of the language. It also writes a Hebrew Historical Dictionary.

==Organization==
The plenum consists of 42 members. In addition, the Academy employs 8 academic advisors, among them respected scholars of language, linguistics, Judaic studies, and Bible. It also has 9 honorary members. The Academy&#x27;s decisions are binding on all governmental agencies, including the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation.

<text>Hasliberg is a Swiss municipality in the Interlaken-Oberhasli administrative district in the canton of Bern. Hasliberg is situated on a south-west facing terrace above the valley of the river Aare. The four villages spread out along this terrace are, from west to east, Hohfluh, Wasserwendi, Goldern and Reuti.

Hasliberg has become a popular destination for winter sports. An international boarding school, the Ecole d&#x27;Humanité, is located in Goldern.

==History==

Hasliberg is first mentioned in 1358 as &quot;Hasle an dem berge&quot;. The name is derived from the Old High German &quot;hasal&quot; &quot;hazel&quot;. After 1834 it was known as &quot; Hasleberg&quot;. Since 1923 the spelling has been Hasliberg.

A few, scattered Roman coins were found in the municipality, but the earliest known settlement dates back to the Middle Ages. During the Middle Ages Hasliberg was part of the Vogtei of Oberhasli and the parish of Meiringen. In 1334 the entire Oberhasli Vogtei was acquired by Bern. For most of their history, the residents of Hasliberg raised crops in the valleys, raised cattle and horses in seasonal alpine herding camp and produced cheeses from the milk. Beginning in the 14th century they began to mine iron ore from the surrounding hills and mountains. Blast furnaces were built in the Mühletal, and many residents cut timber or produced charcoal for the furnaces. They also made a small amount of money from traffic over the Brünig Pass. Beginning in the High Middle Ages, the Hasliberg often fought with the neighboring municipalities of Lungern and Kerns over grazing land in the high alpine meadows.

In 1528 the municipality, along with the entire Canton of Bern, adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and the chapel in Wasserwendi was demolished. Hasliberg joined the Reformed parish of Meiringen. In 1939 a Reformed church was built in Hohfluh and in 1967 it finally became the parish church for the municipality. A Catholic chapel opened in the village in 1977.

The farmers of the area organized into Bäuerten or farming communities quite early. The oldest Bäuert charter dates from 1555 and defines obligations and work assignments as well as meadow borders and grazing schedules. The current municipality was created in 1834 by combining the land and residents of several Bäuerten. During the 19th century, the population grew quickly. However, limited arable land forced many residents to take up cottage industries such as silk or linen weaving or wood carving. Others emigrated to the other countries, especially the United States. Construction of the Brünig railway line in 1888 and the road over to Meiringen in 1890 provided an influx of money and tourists. The Health Spa Brünig-Hasliberg opened in Hohfluh and by 1912 there were over 600 hotel rooms in the municipality.

Global tension leading up to the war and World War I in 1914 devastated the Hasliberg tourism industry. The Schweizerhof hotel became a mothers convalescent home and is now a rehabilitation clinic. The Viktoria in Reuti became a training center of the Protestant Church in Switzerland. The Schweizer Glaubensmission (Swiss Faith Mission) acquired the Bellevue in Hohfluh. In 1946 the Ecole d&#x27; Humanité established a boarding school in Goldern. After World War II, tourism returned to Hasliberg. A number of hotels opened and many second or vacation homes were built. Today tourism revenue provides the majority of the municipal income.

<doc id="659240" wikidata="Q2006048" url="?curid=659240" title="Unkei">
<text>Unkei (;  – 1223) was a Japanese sculptor of the Kei school, which flourished in the Kamakura period. He specialized in statues of the Buddha and other important Buddhist figures. Unkei&#x27;s early works are fairly traditional, similar in style to pieces by his father, Kōkei. However, the sculptures he produced for the Tōdai-ji in Nara show a flair for realism different from anything Japan had seen before. Today, Unkei is the best known of the Kei artists, and many art historians consider him its &quot;most distinguished member&quot;.

==Career==
Many extant works are said to be his, but the first that can be attributed to him with any certainty is a Dainichi Nyorai at Enjō-ji in Nara (1176).

Unkei was a devout Buddhist, and records from 1183 (Heian period end) show that he transcribed two copies of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; with the aid of two calligrapher monks and a woman sponsor named Akomaro. In the works&#x27; colophon, Unkei gives the names of all involved in performing the ritual obeisance (&quot;raihai&quot;) during the project&#x27;s duration; the list includes Unkei himself and several members of his school. Unkei further records that he tallied the lines copied at the end of each day and then had devotees bow three times and chant the &quot;august title&quot; (likely &quot;daimoku&quot;) and the &quot;nembutsu&quot; for each one. In all, Unkei records that &quot;During the copying, the above persons bowed fifty thousand times and [chanted] the &quot;nenbutsu&quot; one hundred thousand times, and the august title of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, one hundred thousand times.&quot;
In 1203, Unkei worked with Kaikei, two other master sculptors, and 16 assistants to create two guardian figures for the gates of the Nandaimon (Great South Gate) of Tōdai-ji in Nara. The statues, known as the Kongō Rikishi or Niō, are 26 feet tall. The team finished the figures in 72 days using the &quot;yosegi&quot; technique of sculpting various pieces of wood separately and then combining them for the finished product.

Sometime between 1208 and 1212, Unkei sculpted a figure of a &quot;Miroku Butsu&quot; (Sanskrit: Maitreya Buddha) at Tōdai-ji, along with several accompanied figures. These included two bodhisattva, the Shitennō (Four Heavenly Kings), and a pair of Indian &quot;rakan&quot; (Sanskrit: arhats) named Muchaku and Seshin. Only the Miroku Butsu and rakan still stand today. After the completion of these works and others at the Kōfuku-ji, Unkei moved the Kei school&#x27;s headquarters to Kyoto.

Unkei was chiefly acting in Kyoto and Nara. However, he traveled to Kamakura sometimes to do commissions for high-ranking samurai and administrators of the shogunate.

A late 12th century sculpture of Dainichi Nyorai, attributed to Unkei, sold at auction at Christie&#x27;s on March 18, 2008 for US$14.37 million, making it the most expensive Japanese art ever sold.

==Style==
Unkei&#x27;s early works are similar in style to those of his father, Kōkei, and contemporary, Kaikei. They are fairly traditional and show a certain delicateness. The works Unkei sculpted around 1210 for the Hokuendō (North Octagonal Hall) at Tōdai-ji, on the other hand, are indicative of his fully developed style. By this time, Unkei had begun to stress realism over tradition and solid, muscular forms over ephemeral, delicate ones.

Unkei&#x27;s &quot;Miroku Butsu&quot; is in the tradition of previous Buddha figures, including those of his father and ultimately Tori Busshi. Like the works of those sculptors, the Buddha is depicted as seated and backed by an intricate halo. However, Unkei&#x27;s work features further strides toward realism. Crystal inlays cause the eyes to shine, and details are carved deeply and in new detail. Furthermore, Unkei&#x27;s work does not follow the canon of proportions established by Jōchō in the Heian period. Unkei&#x27;s figure instead has a long torso that does not match the distance between the figures knees (a style used by sculptors for the preceding 150 years). Despite this, Unkei&#x27;s Buddha does not look unbalanced or unwieldy. Rather, it is a lifelike Buddha who seems kind and empathic. In essence, Unkei created a new style of sculpture.

This new realism is especially evident in Unkei&#x27;s non-Buddha statuary. His Kongō Rikishi guardians stand contrapposto with dramatic stances. Their musculature, though anatomically incorrect, is well detailed, making them appear to be in mid-movement. These &quot;Niō&quot; reflect the warrior lifestyle and samurai ideals to which Unkei was exposed in Kamakura.

Unkei&#x27;s &quot;rakan&quot; figures, Mujaku and Seshin, take this realism to an even higher level, making the figures appear almost portrait-like. Both statues sport priestly vestments that frame their bodies realistically. They stand life-size and alone and are fully sculpted in the round as if intended to be viewed from any angle. Mujaku is depicted as a thin man manipulating some sort of holy, cloth-wrapped object. He appears reserved and reflective. Seshin, in contrast, is depicted in mid conversation, gesturing and speaking, an extroverted counterweight to the solemn Mujaku. The men are shown as specific people, not simply members of a stock type.

Due to the collaborative nature of sculpture in this period, it is difficult to determine exactly how much of this innovation can be credited to Unkei personally. Regardless of who was responsible, this new style was adopted by Unkei&#x27;s followers and descendants, including his sons Tankei, Kōun, Kōben, and Kōshō, and carried on until the mid-Kamakura period. Kōben and Kōshō especially would take Unkei&#x27;s style to new extremes.

<text>Frank Oliver Howard (August 8, 1936 – October 30, 2023), nicknamed &quot;Hondo&quot;, &quot;the Washington Monument&quot; and &quot;the Capital Punisher&quot;, was an American professional baseball player, coach, and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played most of his career for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Washington Senators/Texas Rangers franchises. One of the most physically intimidating players in the sport, Howard was tall and weighed between , according to former Senators/Rangers trainer Bill Zeigler.

Howard was named the National League&#x27;s Rookie of the Year in for the Dodgers. He twice led the American League in home runs, and total bases and once each in slugging percentage, runs batted in, and walks. Howard was a four-time MLB All-Star. He hit 382 career home runs and was inducted into the Washington Nationals Ring of Honor after his retirement.

==Early life==
Frank Oliver Howard was born on August 8, 1936, in Columbus, Ohio, to John and Erma Howard, the third of six children. His father was a machinist for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and had played semi-professional baseball, later on encouraging his son&#x27;s interest in the game.

Howard attended South High School in Columbus, Ohio, and Ohio State University, where he played college baseball and college basketball for the Ohio State Buckeyes. He was an All-American in both basketball and baseball. He averaged 20.1 points and 15.3 rebounds per game in 1957, and was drafted the following year by the Philadelphia Warriors of the National Basketball Association.

==Professional career==
===Los Angeles Dodgers===

Howard instead signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers organization in 1958 for a $108,000 signing bonus ($ in current dollar terms). Howard spent the 1958 season with the Green Bay Bluejays of the Class B Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League. He led the league with 37 home runs and 119 runs batted in (RBIs). The Dodgers briefly promoted him to the major leagues after his minor league season, and he hit his first MLB home run on his 29th at bat. He then began the 1959 season with the Victoria Rosebuds of the Double-A Texas League, and he hit .356 with 27 home runs and 79 RBIs in 261 at-bats before the Dodgers again promoted Howard to the major leagues. He batted .105 in 19 at bats for the Dodgers before they demoted him to the Spokane Indians of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League on July 1. In 76 games for Spokane, Howard had a .319 average, 16 home runs, and 47 RBIs across 295 at bats. He won &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Minor League Player of the Year Award.

Howard began the 1960 season in Spokane, and was promoted to the Dodgers after batting .371 in 26 games. He succeeded former Brooklyn Dodger All-Star Carl Furillo as Los Angeles&#x27; right fielder in 1960. He was named the NL&#x27;s Rookie of the Year after batting .268 with 23 home runs and 77 RBIs. His teammates gave him the nickname &quot;Hondo&quot; after the character in a John Wayne film. He missed the beginning of the 1961 season due to a chipped bone in the thumb on his right hand. He became a platoon outfielder, starting 72 games and batting .296 with 15 home runs.

In , Howard batted .296 with 31 home runs and finished among the NL&#x27;s top five players in RBIs (119) and slugging (.560). He won the NL Player of the Month award in July with a .381 average, 12 home runs, and 41 RBIs. The season ended with the Dodgers and San Francisco Giants tied for first place. In the three-game pennant playoff that followed Howard had only a single in 11 at-bats and struck out three times against Billy Pierce in the first game, including the final out; but he had a run and an RBI in the second contest, an 8–7 win. The Giants took the pennant in three games, but Howard ended up ninth in the MLB Most Valuable Player award voting.

In , Howard&#x27;s production dropped off to a .273 average, 28 homers, and 64 RBIs; but the Dodgers won the pennant, and his upper-deck solo home run off Whitey Ford broke a scoreless tie in the fifth inning of Game 4 of the World Series, helping Los Angeles to a 2–1 win and a sweep of the New York Yankees. He batted .226 with 24 home runs in 1964.

===Washington Senators===
On December 4, 1964, the Dodgers traded Howard, Phil Ortega, Pete Richert, and Dick Nen to the Washington Senators for Claude Osteen, John Kennedy, and cash. Howard went from a fourth outfielder with Los Angeles to an every day player with the Senators. In 1965, his first season in Washington, he batted .289 with 21 home runs in 143 games. In 1967, Howard hit 36 home runs, third in the AL behind Harmon Killebrew and Carl Yastrzemski. During a one-week stretch from May 12–18, 1968, Howard hit 10 home runs in 20 at bats. He hit 13 home runs in 16 games. Howard finished the season leading the AL with 44 home runs, a .552 slugging percentage and 330 total bases, and was second to Ken Harrelson with 106 RBIs; he made his first of four consecutive All-Star teams that year. Beginning in 1968, Howard appeared semi-regularly at first base in order to limit the wear and tear of playing the outfield daily. With the Senators, Howard received the nickname &quot;the Capitol Punisher&quot;.

Ted Williams became manager of the Senators in 1969, and he helped Howard to become a more patient hitter. He encouraged Howard to lay off the first fastball he saw, and work pitchers deeper into the count, advice which resulted in Howard&#x27;s walk totals nearly doubling and 45 fewer strikeouts the first year. A year later, Howard added 32 more walks to lead the AL with 132.

In 1969, Howard hit 48 home runs (one behind Killebrew&#x27;s league lead), 111 runs (second in the AL to Reggie Jackson), a .296 batting average, and a .574 slugging mark. The Senators had their best year ever, 86–76, but still finished far behind the Baltimore Orioles in the Eastern Division. He again led the AL with 340 total bases, the most ever by a Washington player, and added 111 RBIs; his fourth-place finish in the MVP vote was the highest of his career. In , he led the AL both in home runs (44) and RBI (126); his 132 walks in that year also topped the league. On September 2, he received three intentional walks from flamethrowing southpaw Sam McDowell—two of them to lead off an inning. McDowell moved to play second base when Howard came up to bat in the eighth inning. He came in fifth in the 1970 MVP race, and received one first-place vote.

Howard hit the last regular-season home run for the Senators in RFK Stadium in his final at bat on September 30, 1971, off Yankees pitcher Mike Kekich. After waving to the cheering fans, Howard tossed his hat into the stands, and blew a kiss to the crowd.

After the game he said, &quot;What can a guy do to top this? A guy like me has maybe five big thrills in his lifetime. Well, this was my biggest tonight. I&#x27;ll take it to the grave with me. This was Utopia. I can&#x27;t do anything else like it. It&#x27;s all downhill the rest of the way.&quot;

===Later career===
The Senators moved to Dallas/Fort Worth in , becoming the Texas Rangers. Howard hit the first ever home run for the Rangers, but batted only .244 with nine home runs in 95 games before his contract was sold to the Detroit Tigers in August for the $20,000 waiver price. He platooned with Norm Cash at first base and batted .242. He was not eligible for the Tigers&#x27; 1972 postseason roster as he reported to the Tigers after the September 1 deadline. As the Tigers&#x27; designated hitter in 1973, Howard batted .256 with 12 home runs and 29 RBIs. The Tigers released Howard after the season.

Unable to find a job in the majors in 1974, Howard signed to play in Japan&#x27;s Pacific League for the Taiheiyo Club Lions. In his first at bat there he hurt his back on a swing, and never played again. In 16 major league seasons Howard batted .273 with 382 home runs.

===As manager and coach===
Following his retirement as a player, the Milwaukee Brewers hired Howard to manage Spokane for the 1976 season.

Howard was the hitting coach and then the first base coach for the Brewers from 1977 to 1980 for managers Alex Grammas and George Bamberger before being named manager of the San Diego Padres prior to the 1981 season. The Padres finished in last place in both halves of that strike-shortened season, and Howard was fired. Their 41–69 overall record was MLB&#x27;s worst that season, with their .373 winning percentage the lowest in the Padres&#x27; history since they were 52–110 (.321) in their inaugural season in 1969.

Howard became the first base coach with the New York Mets in 1982, where Bamberger was the manager, and took over as manager after Bamberger&#x27;s resignation in June 1983. Howard managed the last 116 games of the 1983 season. The Mets finished in last place and the Mets did not retain Howard as manager. Instead, he returned as the first base coach the following season.

Howard rejoined Bamberger with the Brewers as their hitting and first base coach in 1985 and was fired after the 1986 season. He became a first base coach for the Seattle Mariners in 1987. Howard was the hitting and first base coach for the New York Yankees from 1989 to 1993, the first base coach for the Mets from 1994 to 1996, and the bench coach for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays from 1998 to 1999. From 2000 to 2008, he worked for the Yankees as a player development instructor.

The Washington Nationals inducted Howard in their Ring of Honor in August 2016.

==Personal life==
Howard was married twice. His first marriage was to Carol Johanski, a secretary who worked at the &quot;Green Bay Press-Gazette&quot;. The couple met and married in 1958 and settled in Green Bay, Wisconsin, going on to raise six children before divorcing. In 1991, Howard married his second wife, Donna.

Howard died on October 30, 2023, at a hospital in Aldie, Virginia, of complications from a stroke. He was 87. His body is interred at Allouez Catholic Cemetery in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

<text>(&quot;The Deluded Bridegroom, or The Rivalry of Three Women for One Lover&quot;) is a two-act opera buffa, K. 430, composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart between 1783 and 1784. However, the opera was never completed and only a 20-minute fragment from act 1 exists.

==Performance history==
Mozart had originally planned to have the opera performed by a seven-member Italian troupe in Vienna. Although it was once thought that Lorenzo Da Ponte might have been the author of the libretto, scholarship by Alessandra Campana has established that the libretto was written by an unknown Italian poet for Domenico Cimarosa&#x27;s opera &quot;Le donne rivali&quot;, which he composed for the Rome carnival season of 1780. According to Neal Zaslaw, Cimarosa&#x27;s librettist may have been Giuseppe Petrosellini, the house poet of the Teatro Valle where &quot;Le donne rivali&quot; premiered. (Petrosellini was also the probable librettist of Mozart&#x27;s earlier opera &quot;La finta giardiniera&quot;). For &quot;Lo sposo deluso&quot;, Mozart had the characters in &quot;Le donne rivali&quot; expanded from five to seven, renamed the original five, and established the cast of singers for whom he would be writing. It is unclear why he abandoned the work, although Zaslaw has proposed that it was a combination of the difficulties presented by re-writing and adapting the libretto for the Viennese audience and the fact that in 1785, Da Ponte had finally come through with the libretto for &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;.

The first known performance of material from &quot;Lo sposo deluso&quot; dates from 15 November 1797, six years after Mozart&#x27;s death. Mozart&#x27;s widow, Constanze, arranged for the overture and opening quartet to be performed at the Estates Theatre in Prague during a concert highlighting the musical debut of their youngest son, Franz Xaver Mozart.

In 1991, the 200th anniversary of Mozart&#x27;s death, Opera North premièred &quot;The Jewel Box&quot;, a pasticcio opera devised by Paul Griffiths. This used the existing pieces from &quot;Lo sposo deluso&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;oca del Cairo&quot; as well as arias written by Mozart for insertion into operas by Anfossi, Piccini and Cimarosa, among others. (The programme was an imagined reconstruction of a 1783 pantomime in which Mozart and Aloysia Weber are said to have taken part.)

In 2006, the 250th anniversary of Mozart&#x27;s birth, the fragment of &quot;Lo sposo deluso&quot; received several performances, including:
*Bampton Classical Opera&#x27;s revival of &quot;The Jewel Box&quot;.
*The Salzburg Festival&#x27;s double bill of &quot;Lo sposo deluso&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;oca del Cairo&quot;, and other arias written by Mozart in a programme titled &quot;Rex tremendus&quot;, conceived and staged by Joachim Schlöme with the Camerata Salzburg conducted by Michael Hofstetter. (This performance is preserved on DVD, see Recordings)

==Roles==
Note that the opera was unfinished and never premiered as such. The singers&#x27; names given in the table below are those for whom Mozart wrote the roles and who were to have sung in its premiere.

The setting is a seaside villa near Livorno.

The cast is nearly identical to that of the first &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;. Benucci was the first Figaro. Storace the first Susanna. Mandini the first Count Almaviva, and Bussani the first Bartolo. Both Mandini and Bussani started as tenors but by this time they were a baritone and a bass respectively.

==Existing pieces from the opera==
*Overtura – an upbeat, presto instrumental piece which develops into a more lethargic pensive mood
*Quartetto – &quot; (Pulcherio, Papparelli, Bettina, Don Asdrubale)
*Aria (fragment) – &quot; (Eugenia)
*Aria (fragment) – &quot; (Pulcherio)
*Terzetto – &quot; (Papparelli, Don Asdrubale, Eugenia)

<text>Iseltwald is a village and municipality on the southern shore of Lake Brienz in the Bernese Oberland region of Switzerland. Politically, the municipality is located in the Interlaken-Oberhasli administrative district of the canton of Bern.

==History==

Iseltwald is first mentioned in 1146 as &quot;Iseltwalt&quot;.

During the Middle Ages, a castle was built on the peninsula near the village for the Lords of Matten. In 1146, King Conrad III gave Interlaken Monastery one quarter of the village. Over the following years, the monastery attempted to expand their power in the village. After the Swiss Confederation gained de facto independence from the House of Habsburg, the monastery remained a strong supporter of the Austrian dynasty. The monastery launched several raids into Unterwalden to support Habsburg ambitions. In response, in 1342, troops from Unterwalden attacked and burned Iseltwald. A few years later, in 1348-49, the village unsuccessfully rebelled against the monastery. In 1528, the city of Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and began imposing it on the Bernese Oberland. Iseltwald joined many other villages and the monastery in an unsuccessful rebellion against the new faith. After Bern imposed its will on the Oberland, they secularized the monastery and annexed all the monastery lands.

Since 1948 it has been part of the large parish of Gsteig bei Interlaken in Gsteigwiler.

The traditional local economy relied on fish from Lake Brienz, farming in the valleys and seasonal alpine herding and farming in the alpine meadows. A glass blowing factory opened between 1680 and 1696 and operated until 1715. Beginning in 1871, tourists began coming across the lake on steam ships. However, there was only one large road into the village until 1988. Today the local economy is based on tourism, agriculture, fishing and timber harvesting.

<text>Didacticism is a philosophy that emphasises instructional and informative qualities in literature, art, and design. In art, design, architecture, and landscape, didacticism is a conceptual approach that is driven by the urgent need to explain.

==Overview==
The term has its origin in the Ancient Greek word διδακτικός (&quot;didaktikos&quot;), &quot;pertaining to instruction&quot;, and signified learning in a fascinating and intriguing manner.

Didactic art was meant both to entertain and to instruct. Didactic plays, for instance, were intended to convey a moral theme or other rich truth to the audience. During the Middle Age, the Roman Catholic chants like the &quot;Veni Creator Spiritus&quot;, as well as the Eucharistic hymns like the &quot;Adoro te devote&quot; and &quot;Pange lingua&quot; are used for fixing within prayers the truths of the Roman Catholic faith to preserve them and pass down from a generation to another. In the Renaissance, the church began a syncretism between pagan and the Christian didactic art, a syncretism that reflected its dominating temporal power and recalled the controversy among the pagan and Christian aristocracy in the fourth century. An example of didactic writing is Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on Criticism&quot; (1711), which offers a range of advice about critics and criticism. An example of didacticism in music is the chant &quot;Ut queant laxis&quot;, which was used by Guido of Arezzo to teach solfege syllables. 

Around the 19th century the term &quot;didactic&quot; came to also be used as a criticism for work that appears to be overburdened with instructive, factual, or otherwise educational information, to the detriment of the enjoyment of the reader (a meaning that was quite foreign to Greek thought). Edgar Allan Poe called didacticism the worst of &quot;heresies&quot; in his essay &quot;The Poetic Principle&quot;.

<text>Salix caprea, known as goat willow, [[pussy willow]] or great sallow, is a common species of willow native to Europe and western and central Asia.

==Description==
It is a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching a height of , rarely to 13 m.

The leaves are 3–12 cm long and from 2–8 cm wide, broader than most other willows.

The flowers are soft silky, and silvery 3-7-cm-long catkins are produced in early spring before the new leaves appear; the male and female catkins are on different plants (dioecious). The male catkins mature yellow at pollen release, the female catkins mature pale green.

The fruit is a small capsule 5–10 mm long containing numerous minute seeds embedded in fine, cottony hairs. The seeds are very small (about 0.2 mm) with the fine hairs aiding dispersal; they require bare soil to germinate.

The two varieties are:
*&quot;S. c.&quot; var. &quot;caprea&quot; - lowland regions throughout the range, leaves thinly hairy above, densely hairy below, 5–12 cm long, stipules persistent until autumn
*&quot;S. c.&quot; var. &quot;sphacelata&quot; (Sm.) Wahlenb. (syn. &quot;S. caprea&quot; var. &quot;coaetanea&quot; Hartm.; &quot;S. coaetanea&quot; (Hartm.) Floderus) - high altitudes in the mountains of central and northern Europe (Alps, Carpathians, Scotland, Scandinavia), leaves densely silky-hairy on both sides, 3–7 cm long, stipules early deciduous. In western Norway there are trees of S. c. var &#x27;Sphacelata&#x27; that are 18–20 meters tall and have mostly single trunks.

==Name==
The Latin specific epithet &quot;caprea&quot; means &quot;goat&quot;. This, and the common name goat willow, probably derive from the first known illustration of the species in Hieronymus Bock&#x27;s 1546 &quot;Herbal&quot;, where the plant is shown being browsed by a goat. The species was historically also widely used as a browse for goats, to which Bock&#x27;s illustration may refer.

==Ecology==
&quot;S. caprea&quot; occurs both in wet/damp environments, such as riverbanks and lake shores, and in drier sites, wherever bare soil becomes available due to ground disturbance.

Hybrids with several other willow species are common, notably with &quot;Salix cinerea&quot; (&quot;S. × reichardtii&quot;), &quot;Salix aurita&quot; (&quot;S. × multinervis&quot;), &quot;Salix viminalis&quot; (&quot;S. × smithiana&quot;), and &quot;Salix purpurea&quot; (&quot;S. × sordida&quot;). Populations of &quot;S. caprea&quot; often show hybrid introgression.

Unlike almost all other willows, pure specimens do not take root readily from cuttings; if a willow resembling the species does root easily, it is probably a hybrid with another species of willow.

The leaves are used as a food resource by several species of Lepidoptera, and are also commonly eaten by browsing mammals. Willows are very susceptible to gall inducers, and the midge &quot;Rhabdophaga rosaria&quot; forms the camellia gall on &quot;S. caprea&quot;.

==Cultivation and uses==
A small number of cultivars have been selected for garden use. The most common is &quot;S. caprea&quot; &#x27;Kilmarnock&#x27;, discovered by James Smith, with stiffly pendulous shoots forming a mop-head; it is a male clone. A similar female clone is &quot;S. caprea&quot; &#x27;Weeping Sally&#x27;. As they do not form a leader, they are grafted on erect stems of other willows; the height of these cultivars is determined by the height at which the graft is made. Plants can also be grown from greenwood cuttings, which make attractive creeping mounds. Hardwood cuttings are often difficult to root.

Both tannin and salicin can be extracted from goat willow bark. The tree is not considered a good source of timber, as its wood is both brittle and known to crackle violently if burned.

As with the closely related &quot;Salix discolor&quot; (American pussy willow), it is also often grown for cut flowers. See Pussy willow for further cultural information, which applies to both species.

In North Europe it has been fairly common to make willow flutes from goat willow cuttings.

In Germany, Hungary, north of Slovakia, Poland and Ukraine, the just-opened catkins are used like the olive branches on Palm Sunday.

<text>Elizabeth Blodgett Hall (November 16, 1909 – July 18, 2005) was an administrator of both secondary and college level institutions. She was a pioneer and innovator of the &#x27;early college&#x27; model of post-secondary education.

==Early life==
Hall was born on November 16, 1909, in New York City, New York as the only child of Thomas Harper Blodgett and Margaret Carroll Kendrick. As a young girl she attended the Ethical Culture School, before her family moved to the Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts. Hall was raised in Great Barrington, and in 1928 she graduated from Miss Hall&#x27;s School in nearby Pittsfield.

In 1928, Hall attended her father&#x27;s alma mater, Knox College, for one year. While raising her four children and commuting from the suburbs, she became one of the first older adults to study at Radcliffe College, where she graduated in 1946.

==Career==
From 1949 to 1963 she was headmistress for Concord Academy, an independent college preparatory school in Concord, Massachusetts. During her time there, Mrs. Hall was responsible for developing Concord Academy into a demanding college preparatory school.

In 1964 on the grounds of her family&#x27;s Great Pine Farm, Hall founded Simon&#x27;s Rock with financial support from a family foundation established by her mother. The school was designed as an early college, accepting students coming from their sophomore or junior years of high school and usually before receiving high school diplomas. The first class at Simon&#x27;s Rock entered in 1966. Hall served as the school&#x27;s president from 1964 to 1972. In 1979 Simon&#x27;s Rock became affiliated with Bard College. Hall served on the Simon&#x27;s Rock Board of Overseers and the Board of Trustees of Bard College. In 1996 she was named an emerita member of both boards.

== Personal life ==
On September 13, 1930, Hall married Livingston Hall at St. James Episcopal Church in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. They had four children.
Hall died July 18, 2005, at the age of 95 in Canaan, Connecticut.

==Legacy==
Hall earned a reputation as a capable educational administrator and pioneer who was able to successfully translate her vision into an innovative and sustainable institution. In recognition for her leadership at Concord Academy and Simon&#x27;s Rock, Hall received the Distinguished Alumna Award from Miss Hall&#x27;s School &quot;for the leadership to guide a fledgling girls&#x27; school from obscurity to national prominence, for the vision to create a new and almost totally original institution, for the dedication, perseverance, and philanthropic commitment to turn that dream into a reality, and for her devotion to the betterment of young people&quot;.

<doc id="659291" wikidata="Q39708" url="?curid=659291" title="Salix purpurea">
<text>Salix purpurea, the purple willow, purpleosier willow, or purple osier, is a species of willow native to most of Europe and north to the British Isles, Poland, and the Baltic States, and Turkey, the Caucasus, and northwestern Africa.
It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1–3 m (rarely to 5 m) tall, with purple-brown to yellow-brown shoots, turning pale grey on old stems. The leaves are 2–8 cm (rarely to 12 cm) long and 0.3–1 cm (rarely 2 cm) wide; they are dark green above, glaucous green below, and unusually for a willow, are often arranged in opposite pairs rather than alternate. The flowers are small catkins 1.5-4.5 cm long, produced in early spring; they are often purple or red in colour, hence the name of the species (other willows mostly have whitish, yellow or green catkins).

Four subspecies and forms are accepted.
*&quot;Salix purpurea&quot; subsp. eburnea&quot; – Sardinia
*&quot;Salix purpurea&quot; f. &quot;gracilis&quot; – Belgium, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, and Spain
*&quot;Salix purpurea&quot; subsp. &quot;leucodermis&quot; – Turkey
*&quot;Salix purpurea&quot; subsp. &quot;purpurea&quot; – Europe, the Caucasus, Turkey, and northwestern Africa

It is replaced further east in Asia by the closely related species &quot;Salix sinopurpurea&quot; (syn. &quot;S. purpurea&quot; var. &quot;longipetiolatea&quot;).

The weeping cultivar &#x27;Pendula&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. As with several other willows, the shoots, called withies, are often used in basketry. The wood of this and other willow species is used in making cricket bats.

<text>Amy Irving (born September 10, 1953) is an American actress and singer, who worked in film, stage, and television. Her accolades include an Obie Award, and nominations for two Golden Globe Awards and an Academy Award.

Born in Palo Alto, California, to actors Jules Irving and Priscilla Pointer, Irving spent her early life in San Francisco before her family relocated to New York City during her teenage years. In New York, she made her Broadway debut in &quot;The Country Wife&quot; (1965–1966) at age 13. Irving subsequently studied theater at San Francisco&#x27;s American Conservatory Theater and at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art before making her feature film debut in Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Carrie&quot; (1976), followed by a lead role in the 1978 supernatural thriller &quot;The Fury&quot; (1978).

In 1980, Irving appeared in a Broadway production of &quot;Amadeus&quot; and the film &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot; (1980). She was cast in Barbra Streisand&#x27;s musical epic &quot;Yentl&quot; (1983), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 1988, she received an Obie Award for her Off-Broadway performance in a production of &quot;The Road to Mecca&quot;, and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for her performance in the comedy &quot;Crossing Delancey&quot; (1988).

Irving went on to appear in the original Broadway production of &quot;Broken Glass&quot; (1994) and the revival of &quot;Three Sisters&quot; (1997). In film, she starred in the ensemble comedy &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; (1997), and reprised her role as Sue Snell in &quot;The Rage: Carrie 2&quot; (1999) before co-starring opposite Michael Douglas in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s crime-drama &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000). She subsequently appeared in the independent films &quot;Thirteen Conversations About One Thing&quot; (2001) and &quot;Adam&quot; (2009). From 2006 to 2007, she starred in the Broadway production of &quot;The Coast of Utopia&quot;. In 2018, she reunited with Soderbergh, appearing in a supporting role in his horror film &quot;Unsane&quot;.

==Early life==
Irving was born on September 10, 1953, in Palo Alto, California. Her father was film and stage director Jules Irving (born Jules Israel) and her mother is former actress Priscilla Pointer. Her brother is writer and director David Irving and her sister, Katie Irving, is a singer and teacher of deaf children. Irving&#x27;s father was of Russian-Jewish descent, and one of Irving&#x27;s maternal great-great-grandfathers was also Jewish. Irving was raised in her mother&#x27;s faith of Christian Science, and her family observed no religious traditions.

She spent her early life in San Francisco, California, where her father co-founded the Actor&#x27;s Workshop, and where she was active in local theater as a child. She attended the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and appeared in several productions there. She also trained at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. As a teenager, Irving relocated with her family to New York City, where her father was appointed the director of the Lincoln Center Repertory Theater. There, Irving graduated from the Professional Children&#x27;s School. She made her Off-Broadway debut at age 17 in &quot;And Chocolate on Her Chin&quot;.

==Career==
Irving&#x27;s first stage appearance was at nine months old in the production &quot;Rumplestiltskin&quot; where her father brought her on the stage to play the part of his child who he trades for spun gold. Then at age two, she portrayed a bit-part character (&quot;Princess Primrose&quot;) in a play which her father directed. She had a walk-on role in the 1965–66 Broadway show &quot;The Country Wife&quot; at age 12. Her character was to sell a hamster to Stacy Keach in a crowd scene. The play was directed by family friend Robert Symonds, the associate director of the Lincoln Center Repertory Theater, and who later became her stepfather after her father died and her mother remarried. Within six months of returning to Los Angeles from London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in the mid-1970s, Irving was cast in a major motion picture and was working on various TV projects such as guest spots in &quot;Police Woman&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, and a lead role in the mini-series epic &quot;Once an Eagle&quot; opposite veterans Sam Elliott and Glenn Ford, and a young Melanie Griffith. She played Juliet in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the Los Angeles Free Shakespeare Theatre in 1975, and returned to the role at the Seattle Repertory Theatre (1982–1983).
Irving auditioned for the role of Princess Leia in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which went to Carrie Fisher. She then starred in the Brian DePalma-directed films &quot;Carrie&quot; as Sue Snell (her mother was also in &quot;Carrie&quot;), and &quot;The Fury&quot; as Gillian Bellaver. In 1999, she reprised her role as Sue Snell in &quot;The Rage: Carrie 2&quot;. She starred with Richard Dreyfuss in 1980 in &quot;The Competition&quot;. Also in 1980, she appeared in &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot;, which also marked her on-screen singing debut. Both her and Dyan Cannon&#x27;s characters were country-and-western singers, and both actresses did their own singing in the film. In 1983, she featured in Barbra Streisand&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Yentl&quot;, for which she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In 1984, she co-starred in &quot;Micki + Maude&quot;. In 1988, she was in &quot;Crossing Delancey&quot; (for which she received a Golden Globe nomination). That same year, she also gave another singing performance in the live-action/animated film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, providing the singing voice for Jessica Rabbit. In 1997, she appeared in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot;. Irving also appeared in the TV show &quot;Alias&quot; as Emily Sloane, portrayed Princess Anjuli in the big-budget miniseries epic &quot;The Far Pavilions&quot; and headlined the lavish TV production &quot;&quot;. More recently Irving appeared in the films &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000), &quot;Tuck Everlasting&quot; (2002), &quot;Thirteen Conversations About One Thing&quot; (2002) and an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; in 2001.

Irving&#x27;s stage work includes on-Broadway shows such as &quot;Amadeus&quot; (replacing Jane Seymour due to pregnancy) at the Broadhurst Theatre for nine months, &quot;Heartbreak House&quot; with Rex Harrison at the Circle in the Square Theatre, &quot;Broken Glass&quot; at the Booth Theatre and &quot;Three Sisters&quot; with Jeanne Tripplehorn and Lili Taylor at the Roundabout Theatre.

<text>(&quot;The Goose of Cairo&quot; or &quot;The Cairo Goose&quot;, K. 422) is an incomplete Italian opera buffa in three acts, begun by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in July 1783 but abandoned in October. The complete libretto by Giambattista Varesco remains. Mozart composed seven of the ten numbers of the first act, plus some recitative, as well a sketch for a further aria; the extant music amounts to about 45 minutes.

The autograph manuscript of the opera is preserved in the Berlin State Library.

==Background==
Mozart&#x27;s correspondence shows he wanted to write a comic opera to a new text for the Italian company in Vienna. He had only just met Lorenzo Da Ponte, who would later pen the libretti for several of Mozart&#x27;s most successful operas, but Da Ponte was not available, so Mozart turned to Giambattista Varesco, librettist for Mozart&#x27;s earlier opera &quot;Idomeneo&quot;. Mozart&#x27;s urgent need of a poet is attested by his willingness to work with someone, who in his opinion had &quot;not the slightest knowledge or experience of the theatre&quot;. Eventually Mozart realized the hopelessness of the project and abandoned Varesco&#x27;s libretto after six months because of its silly ending, a farcical travesty of the Trojan Horse legend.

==Performance history==
Several versions have been prepared by adapting other music. The first performance (in concert) was in Frankfurt in April 1860 with numbers taken from &quot;Lo sposo deluso&quot; and some concert arias.

The first stage performance was given on 6 June 1867 in Paris at Louis Martinet&#x27;s Théâtre des Fantaisies-Parisiennes in a 2-act French adaptation, &quot;L&#x27;oie du Caire&quot;, by the Belgian librettist , who added a new conclusion, and a musical arrangement by the conductor, Charles Constantin, who orchestrated the music and added other pieces by Mozart to complete it.

Fragments from &quot;L&#x27;oca del Cairo&quot;, &quot;Lo sposo deluso&quot;, and &quot;Der Schauspieldirektor&quot; have been combined as &quot;Waiting for Figaro&quot;, performed in 2002 by the Bampton Classical Opera. In 1991, the in Berlin performed a combined version of &quot;L&#x27;oca del Cairo&quot; and &quot;Lo sposo deluso&quot; as &quot;Die Gans von Kairo&quot; with a new libretto by Peter Lund and additional compositions by . Lund added three muses commenting on the absurdity of the plot, highlighting the librettist&#x27;s arbitrariness and thus commenting on the historical events leading to the opera being left uncompleted.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
Don Pippo, a Spanish Marquess, keeps his only daughter Celidora locked up in his tower. She is betrothed to Count Lionetto, but her true love is Biondello, a wealthy gentleman. Biondello makes a bet with the Marquis that if he can rescue Celidora from the tower within a year he wins her hand in marriage.
He succeeds by having himself smuggled into the tower garden inside a large mechanical goose.

<text>Salix&quot; × &quot;fragilis, with the common names crack willow and brittle willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to Europe and Western Asia. It is native to riparian habitats, usually found growing beside rivers and streams, and in marshes and water meadow channels. It is a hybrid between &quot;Salix euxina&quot; and &quot;Salix alba&quot;, and is very variable, with forms linking both parents.

==Description==
&quot;Salix&quot; × &quot;fragilis&quot; is a medium-sized to large deciduous tree, which grows rapidly to (rarely to ) tall, with a trunk up to diameter, often multi-trunked, and an irregular, often leaning crown. The bark is dark grey-brown, coarsely fissured in older trees. The lanceolate leaves are bright green, 9–15 cm long and 1.5–3 cm wide, with a finely serrated margin; they are very finely hairy at first in spring, but soon become hairless.

The flowers are produced in catkins in early spring, and pollinated by insects. They are dioecious, with male and female catkins on separate trees; the male catkins are 4–6 cm long, the female catkins are also 4–6 cm long, with the individual flowers having either one or two nectaries. In late spring fruit capsules release numerous small cotton-tufted seeds. They are easily distributed by wind and moving water, and germinate immediately after soil contact.

==Taxonomy==
Carl Linnaeus first described a willow species as &quot;&quot;Salix fragilis&quot; in 1753. It was later discovered that Linnaeus was actually describing a species he had also called &quot;Salix pentandra&quot;. At least since the 1920s, botanists applied Linnaeus&#x27;s name &quot;Salix fragilis&quot; both to a pure species and to its hybrid with &quot;Salix alba&quot;. In 2005, it was proposed that &quot;Salix fragilis&quot; should be conserved for the pure species, with the hybrid called &quot;Salix&quot; × &quot;rubens&quot;. The alternative was to conserve &quot;Salix fragilis&quot; for the hybrid, with the pure species requiring a new name. After discussion, the decision was made by the Nomenclature Committee for Vascular Plants in 2009 to reject the first proposal and conserve &quot;Salix fragilis&quot;&quot; for the hybrid. Irina V. Belyaeva then described the previously unnamed parent species as &quot;Salix euxina&quot;, and designated a lectotype for the hybrid. The lectotype was shown by molecular evidence to be the hybrid between &quot;S. alba&quot; and &quot;S. euxina&quot;, the name of which is written as &quot;Salix&quot; × &quot;fragilis&quot; to show its hybrid status.

===Varieties===
&quot;S.&quot; × &quot;fragilis&quot; is very variable, with forms linking both parents. Some formally named varieties include the following. , none were accepted at this rank by Plants of the World Online, being treated as synonyms of the species. Clive A. Stace suggested some would be better treated as cultivars.
*&quot;S.&quot; × &quot;fragilis&quot; var. &quot;decipiens&quot; (&quot;S.&quot; × &quot;decipiens&quot; ) – assigned to &quot;S.&quot; × &quot;fragilis&quot; by Plants of the World Online and by Belyaeva, but to &quot;S.&quot; &quot;euxina&quot; by Stace
*&quot;S.&quot; × &quot;fragilis&quot; var. &quot;furcata&quot; – male tree with relatively wide leaves; of cultivated origin
*&quot;S.&quot; × &quot;fragilis&quot; var. &quot;fragilis&quot; – male and female trees known; leaves with even, well spaced teeth
*&quot;S.&quot; × &quot;fragilis&quot; var. &quot;glauca&quot; 
*&quot;S.&quot; × &quot;fragilis&quot; var. &quot;polyandra&quot; 
*&quot;S.&quot; × &quot;fragilis&quot; var. &quot;rubens&quot; 
*&quot;S.&quot; × &quot;fragilis&quot; var. &quot;russelliana&quot; – Bedford willow; female tree with long narrow leaves having somewhat uneven teeth; of cultivated origin
==Ecology==
The plant is commonly called crack willow or brittle willow because it is highly susceptible to wind, ice and snow damage. The name also derives from the twigs which break off very easily and cleanly at the base with an audible crack. Broken twigs and branches can take root readily, enabling the species to colonise new areas as broken twigs fall into waterways and can be carried some distance downstream. It is particularly adept at colonising new riverside sandbanks formed after floods. It also spreads by root suckers, expanding into pure &#x27;groves&#x27;.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Salix&quot; × &quot;fragilis&quot; is cultivated as a fast-growing ornamental tree. The cultivar &#x27;Russelliana&#x27; (syn. &quot;S.&quot; × &quot;fragilis&quot; var. &quot;russelliana&quot;) is by far the most common clone of crack willow in Great Britain and Ireland, very easily propagated by cuttings. It is a vigorous tree commonly reaching tall, with leaves up to 15 cm long. It is a female clone.

==Invasive species==
&quot;Salix&quot; × &quot;fragilis&quot; has escaped cultivation to become an invasive species in various parts of the world, including: all states and territories in Australia, New Zealand; the upper half of the United States;, South Africa and Brazil. In New Zealand it is listed on the National Pest Plant Accord, which means it cannot be sold or distributed. It can replace a habitat&#x27;s native plant species diversity by forming monospecific stands. As only the male plant is present in New Zealand no fruit is formed unless hybridised. Species spread is facilitated by stem fragmentation which are carried via waterways and nearby adult individuals. Control and management for habitat restoration projects often uses herbicides.

<doc id="659309" wikidata="Q932272" url="?curid=659309" title="Laurance Rockefeller">
<text>Laurance Spelman Rockefeller (May 26, 1910 – July 11, 2004) was an American businessman, financier, philanthropist, and conservationist. Rockefeller was the third son and fourth child of John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. As a trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, he provided venture capital for Intel, Apple Computer and many other successful start-ups. Rockefeller was known for his involvement in wilderness preservation, ecology and the protection of wildlife. His crusade was the establishing of a conservation ethic, and he was declared America&#x27;s leading conservationist by Lady Bird Johnson.

==Early life and marriage==
Rockefeller was born in New York City, as the fourth child of John Davison Rockefeller Jr. and Abigail Greene &quot;Abby&quot; Aldrich. His siblings were Abby, John III, Nelson, Winthrop, and David.

He graduated from Princeton University in 1932 and attended Harvard Law School for two years, until he decided he did not want to be a lawyer.

On August 22, 1934, in Woodstock, Vermont, Laurance married childhood friend Mary French, whose mother, Mary Montagu Billings French, was a friend of Laurance&#x27;s mother. When brother Nelson attended Dartmouth College, he shared a room with Mary&#x27;s brother. Mary was granddaughter of Frederick H. Billings, a president of Northern Pacific Railway.

Laurance and Mary had three daughters and a son. They are Laura Rockefeller Chasin, Marion Rockefeller Weber, Dr. Lucy R. Waletzky, and Laurance S. &quot;Larry&quot; Rockefeller Jr. He had eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.

==Business, philanthropy, interests==
In 1937, he inherited his grandfather&#x27;s seat on the New York Stock Exchange. He served as founding trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund for forty-two years, from its inception in 1940 to 1982; during this time he also served as president (1958–1968) and later its chairman (1968–1980) for twenty-two years, longer than any other leader in the Fund&#x27;s history. He was also a founding trustee of the Rockefeller Family Fund from 1967 to 1977.

He was a leading figure in the pioneering field of venture capital, founding a joint partnership with all five brothers and their only sister, Babs, in 1946. In 1969 this became the successful Venrock Associates, which provided important early funding for Intel and Apple Computer, amongst many other start-up technology companies, including many other firms involved in healthcare. Over the years his investment interests spread into the fields of aerospace, electronics, high temperature physics, composite materials, optics, lasers, data processing, thermionics, instrumentation and nuclear power. The family also had longstanding philanthropic ties, among them the Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller University, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.

Rockefeller&#x27;s major interest was in aviation; after the War, he became friendly with Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, who had triumphed in many dogfights over Europe. Rockefeller had learned to fly, and found Rickenbacker&#x27;s vivid accounts of an approaching boom in commercial air travel to be persuasive. Within a decade after Rockefeller&#x27;s considerable investment, Eastern Airlines had become the most profitable airline to emerge after World War II. He became its largest shareholder. He also funded the pivotal post-WWII military contractor McDonnell Aircraft Corp.

In 1966, Rockefeller was considered by President Lyndon B. Johnson for the position of Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, then a newly-formed agency. The position instead went to Robert C. Weaver, the first African American Cabinet member in American history.

Rockefeller was a longtime friend and associate of DeWitt Wallace, who with his wife in 1922 co-founded &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. Wallace, who was a major funder of the family&#x27;s Colonial Williamsburg, appointed Laurance as an outside director in the company. He wanted to ensure that it preserved its patriotic mission of informing and educating the public, along with support for national parks, one of Rockefeller&#x27;s primary interests.

Through his resort management company, Rockresorts, Inc., Rockefeller opened environmentally focused hotels at Caneel Bay on Saint John, United States Virgin Islands (1956; a favorite resort today for celebrities), some property of which was later turned over to the Virgin Islands National Park; in Puerto Rico, on Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands, and Hawaii, contributing to the movement now known as eco-tourism. The last of these, the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, was established in 1965 on the Kohala Coast of the island of Hawaii. Its most noted general manager was Adi Kohler, who later wrote the story of the construction of the famous hotel in his book &quot;Mr. Mauna Kea&quot; published by McKenna Publishing Group. While sailing past Virgin Gorda, Rockefeller spotted an idyllic half-mile crescent bay with what he dubbed &quot;wilderness beach&quot;. In 1958 planning and land acquisition began for what would become Little Dix Bay. The resort opened in 1964 and on January 18, 2014, Little Dix Bay celebrated its 50th anniversary. In 1993, the resort became part of Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts but remains true to Rockefeller&#x27;s vision of natural harmony and balance while offering an escape from the ordinary. Elsewhere in the US Virgin Islands Rockresorts developed the Carambola Resort on St. Croix on an incredible stretch of beach that was also famous for being the setting for the closing scene of the movie Trading Places. 

Rockefeller funded the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center at a critical juncture of its early development. He also funded William Irwin Thompson&#x27;s Lindisfarne Association, a think tank and retreat. He had a major involvement in the New York Zoological Society, along with support from other family members and philanthropies; he was a long-time trustee (1935–1986), president (1968–1971) and chairman (1971–1985).

In 1983, Laurance Rockefeller donated the primary funds to create The Mirror Theater Ltd, a New York-based theater company founded by Sabra Jones. The Mirror Theater Ltd is known for producing the 1983 Broadway play &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; at the Virginia Theatre and for the many plays performed by its Mirror Repertory Company.

Rockefeller also funded research of the PEAR lab, dealing with consciousness-based physical phenomena.

He also had an interest, gained via his mother Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, in Buddhism and Asian cultural affairs. He funded the research of Harvard Medical School Professor Dr. John E. Mack, author of &quot;Passport to the Cosmos&quot;. He also was reported to have supported the work of Dr. Steven M. Greer of the Disclosure Project. Rockefeller was also a patron to Roger A. Weir, specifically in relation to Weir&#x27;s research on Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

Rockefeller opposed the harsh punishments of the War on Drugs, including the &quot;Rockefeller Drug Laws&quot; that his older brother, Nelson, championed. He wrote to the New York Times in June 2002, &quot;Overly harsh laws and punishments have reduced faith in government, which is essential to the functioning of a democracy.&quot;

==UFOs==
In later life, Rockefeller became interested in UFOs. In 1993, along with his niece, Anne Bartley, the stepdaughter of Winthrop Rockefeller and the then-president of the &quot;Rockefeller Family Fund&quot;, he established the &quot;UFO Disclosure Initiative to the Clinton White House&quot;. They asked for all UFO information held by the government, including from the CIA and the US Air Force, to be declassified and released to the public. The first and most important test case where declassification had to apply, according to Rockefeller, was the Roswell UFO incident. In September 1994, the Air Force categorically denied the incident was UFO-related. Rockefeller briefed Clinton on the results of his initiative in 1995. Clinton did produce an Executive Order in late 1994 to declassify numerous documents in the National Archives, but this did not specifically refer to UFO-related files.

==Crop Pictograms==
Laurence Rockefeller funded the UK&#x27;s largest crop circle (pictograms) survey.

==Conservation==

He was noted for his involvement in conservation (Lady Bird Johnson in 1967 labeled him &quot;America&#x27;s leading conservationist&quot;) and the protection of wildlife and was chairman of the &quot;Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission&quot;. He was also a recipient of the Lady Bird Johnson Conservation Award. He served on dozens of federal, state and local commissions and advised every president since Dwight D. Eisenhower on issues involving recreation, wilderness preservation and ecology. He founded the American Conservation Association and supported many other environmental groups.

He funded the expansion of Grand Teton National Park and was instrumental in establishing and enlarging national parks in Wyoming, California, the Virgin Islands, Vermont, Maine and Hawaii. In his home state, New York, he expended further cash and influence to help establish parklands and urban open spaces. There, as an active member of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, he helped create a chain of parks that blocked the advance of urban sprawl.

In September 1991, he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for contributions to conservation and historic preservation. Awarded by President George H. W. Bush, it was the first time in the Medal&#x27;s history (since 1777) that it had been awarded for outdoor issues, effectively naming Rockefeller as &quot;Mr Conservation&quot;, who more than any other American had put this issue on the public agenda. Rockefeller said at the award presentation that nothing was more important to him than &quot;the creation of a conservation ethic in America&quot;.

In 1992 Rockefeller and his wife Mary donated their Woodstock, Vermont, summer home and farm to the National Park Service, creating a national park dedicated to the history of conservation, now called the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park. In 2001, Rockefeller transferred ownership of his landmark 1106-acre (4.5 km2) &quot;JY Ranch&quot; to the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. It was accepted by Vice President Dick Cheney on behalf of the Federal government (see External Links below).

<text>Mary-Louise Parker (born August 2, 1964) is an American actress. After making her Broadway debut as Rita in Craig Lucas&#x27; &quot;Prelude to a Kiss&quot; in 1990 (for which she received a Tony Award nomination), Parker came to prominence for film roles in &quot;Grand Canyon&quot; (1991), &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; (1991), &quot;The Client&quot; (1994), &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; (1994), &quot;A Place for Annie&quot; (1994), &quot;Boys on the Side&quot; (1995), &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Maker&quot; (1997). Among stage and independent film appearances thereafter, Parker received the 2001 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her portrayal of Catherine Llewellyn in David Auburn&#x27;s &quot;Proof&quot;, among other accolades. Between 2001 and 2006, she recurred as Amy Gardner in the NBC television series &quot;The West Wing&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2002. She received both a Golden Globe and a Primetime Emmy Award for her portrayal of Harper Pitt in the acclaimed HBO television miniseries &quot;Angels in America&quot; in 2003.

Parker went on to enjoy large success as Nancy Botwin, the lead character in the television series &quot;Weeds&quot;, which ran from 2005 to 2012 and for which she received three nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series between 2007 and 2009 and received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy in 2006.

Her later film appearances include roles in &quot;The Spiderwick Chronicles&quot; (2008), &quot;Red&quot; (2010), &quot;R.I.P.D.&quot; (2013), and &quot;Red 2&quot; (2013). Parker returned to Broadway in 2019 to star in &quot;The Sound Inside&quot;, for which she won her second Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. In 2022, she reprised the role of Li&#x27;l Bit, which she had originated off-Broadway in 1997, in &quot;How I Learned to Drive&quot; on Broadway, a performance which earned Parker her fifth Tony nomination. Since 2007, Parker has contributed articles to &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine and published her memoir, &quot;Dear Mr. You&quot;, in 2015. In 2017, she starred as Roma Guy on the ABC television miniseries &quot;When We Rise&quot;.

==Early life==
Parker was born in Columbia, South Carolina, the youngest of four children, to Caroline Louise (née Morell) and John Morgan Parker, a judge who served in the U.S. Army. Because of her father&#x27;s career, Parker spent parts of her childhood in South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas, as well as in Thailand, Germany, and France. She described her childhood as &quot;profoundly unhappy&quot;, noting that, &quot;My parents did everything they could; I had books, clothes, a home and a warm bed, but I was never happy.&quot; She graduated from Marcos de Niza High School in Tempe, Arizona. Parker majored in drama at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts and graduated in 1986.

==Acting career==
===1980s===
Parker got her start in acting with a role on the soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;. In the late 1980s, Parker moved to New York. After a few minor roles, she made her Broadway debut in a production of Craig Lucas&#x27; &quot;Prelude to a Kiss&quot;, playing the lead role of Rita, in 1990. She moved with the production when it transferred from its origin off-Broadway. Parker won the Clarence Derwent Award for her performance and was nominated for a Tony Award (although she did not play the role when the film was made). In 1989 she was in the film &quot;Longtime Companion&quot;, a film starring Campbell Scott, Bruce Davison and Dermot Mulroney about the emergence and devastation of the AIDS epidemic.

===1990s===
Parker starred with Kevin Kline in &quot;Grand Canyon&quot; (1991); with Kathy Bates, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Jessica Tandy in &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; (1991); with Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones in &quot;The Client&quot; (1994); with John Cusack in &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; (1994); and with Drew Barrymore and Whoopi Goldberg in &quot;Boys on the Side&quot; (1995), as a woman with AIDS. Parker&#x27;s next role was in a movie adaptation of another Craig Lucas play, &quot;Reckless&quot; (1995), alongside Mia Farrow, followed by Jane Campion&#x27;s &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1996), which also starred Nicole Kidman, Viggo Mortensen, Christian Bale, John Malkovich and Barbara Hershey. In addition, she appeared alongside Matthew Modine in Tim Hunter&#x27;s &quot;The Maker&quot; (1997).
Parker&#x27;s theater career continued when she appeared off-Broadway in Paula Vogel&#x27;s 1997 critical smash &quot;How I Learned to Drive&quot;, with David Morse. She received the 1997 Lucille Lortel Award, Outstanding Actress, and 1997 Obie Award, Performance for her performance.

In the late 1990s, she appeared in several independent films, including &quot;Let the Devil Wear Black&quot; and &quot;The Five Senses&quot;. She starred alongside Sidney Poitier in the 1999 movie &quot;The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn&quot;.

The production, directed by Mark Brokaw, earned Parker another nomination for a Tony Award for Best Actress in 2005.

In November 2005, Parker was the subject of a career exhibition at Boston University, where memorabilia from her career were donated to the university&#x27;s library. In 2006, Parker received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy, given by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, for her lead role in &quot;Weeds&quot;. In that category, she defeated the four leads of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. She dedicated the award to the late John Spencer, known for his work as Leo McGarry on &quot;The West Wing&quot;. After receiving the award, Parker stated: &quot;I&#x27;m really in favor of legalizing marijuana. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that controversial.&quot;

===2007–present===

In March 2007, Parker played the lead role in the television film &quot;The Robber Bride&quot;.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, this production was postponed to Manhattan Theater Club&#x27;s 2021–22 season. In 2023, Parker appeared in the music video for country music duo The Reklaws&#x27; song &quot;Honky Tonkin&#x27; About&quot; with Drake Milligan.

<text>Katič () and Sveta Neđelja () are two small islets on the Adriatic Sea, located opposite of the town of Petrovac in the Montenegrin municipality of Budva.

The Sveta Neđelja islet has a small church of the same name built upon it, and coupled with the Katič islet, makes an attraction for diving enthusiasts.

== Geography ==
Because the islets are virtually in the same straight line perpendicular to the coast, only one is visible from Petrovac city beach.

=== Katič ===
The inhabited island of Katič is about 0.9 km from the mainland. The island is small, with a surface-area of 0.010 km2. Its total coastal length is about 0.7 km and the dimensions of the island are approximately 0.20 km by 0.10 km (maximum width). The island is West - East oriented with coordinates (latitude, longitude) of the island&#x27;s center at 42°11&#x27;45.780&quot;, 18°56&#x27;8.4840&quot;.

=== Sveta Neđelja ===
Sveta Nedelya Island is closer to the Petrovac city beach than Katič, and is about 0.7km from the mainland. Sveta Neđelja is distinguished by a small, iconic church with the same name as the island. 

Similarly small with a surface-area of 0.010 km2, its total coastal length is about 0.8 km and the dimensions of the island are approximately 0.20 km by 0.10 km (maximum width). The island is West-southwest - East-northeast oriented with coordinates (latitude, longitude) of the island&#x27;s center at 42°11&#x27;51.2160&quot;, 18°56&#x27;9.9960&quot;.

<text>William Gaither Crudup (; born July 8, 1968) is an American actor. He was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead for his performance in &quot;Jesus&#x27; Son&quot; (1999). He went on to star in numerous high-profile films, including &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2000), &quot;Big Fish&quot; (2003), &quot;&quot; (2006), &quot;Watchmen&quot; (2009), &quot;Public Enemies&quot; (2009), &quot;The Stanford Prison Experiment&quot; (2015), &quot;Jackie&quot; (2016), and &quot;&quot; (2017), in both lead and supporting roles.

Crudup is a four-time Tony Award nominee, winning once for his performance in Tom Stoppard&#x27;s play &quot;The Coast of Utopia&quot; in 2007. He has also starred in the streaming television series &quot;Gypsy&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Morning Show&quot; (2019–present), which earned him two Primetime Emmy Awards and two Critics&#x27; Choice Television Awards, and &quot;Hello Tomorrow!&quot; (2023). In June 2023, he married British actress Naomi Watts.

==Early life==
Crudup was born in Manhasset, New York. His parents, Georgann (née Gaither) and Thomas Henry Crudup III divorced during his childhood, and later remarried, before divorcing a second time. Crudup has spoken of his late father, who died in 2005, as an &quot;incessant gambler and hustler salesman&quot; who continuously sought &quot;to hit the jackpot&quot; throughout his life.

On his father&#x27;s side, he is a descendant of Congressman Josiah Crudup of North Carolina. His maternal grandfather was William Cotter &quot;Billy&quot; Gaither, Jr., a well-known Florida trial lawyer, and his maternal grandmother later remarried to Episcopal bishop James Duncan.

The middle-born of three brothers, Crudup&#x27;s brothers, Tommy and Brooks, are both producers. He left New York with his family when he was about eight years old, first living in Texas, then in Florida. He graduated from Saint Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 1986.

Crudup attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he received an undergraduate degree, and he continued his passion for acting with the undergraduate acting company, LAB! Theatre. He also acted for UNC-STV&#x27;s most popular show, General College. He was a member of the Beta chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon. He then studied at New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts graduate acting program, where he earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1994.

==Career==
===Film and television===
Crudup began acting in films such as 1996&#x27;s &quot;Sleepers&quot;, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Inventing the Abbotts&quot;, and 1998&#x27;s &quot;Without Limits&quot;, where he played the role of running legend and Olympian Steve Prefontaine. His first role in an animated feature was in 1999&#x27;s English release of &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;, in which he starred as Ashitaka. He then played lead guitarist Russell Hammond from Stillwater, the fictional band at the center of Cameron Crowe&#x27;s &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2000). In 2006&#x27;s &quot;The Good Shepherd,&quot; he played British spy Arch Cummings, a stand-in for Kim Philby. The same year, he played a supporting role in &quot;&quot;.

Crudup stars in the Apple TV+ series &quot;The Morning Show&quot;, for which he won a Primetime Emmy Award in 2020 and 2024 and a Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award in 2020 and 2023.

===Stage===

A year after graduating from Tisch, Crudup made his debut on Broadway in the Lincoln Center Theater production of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot;.

Crudup received a 2002 Tony Award nomination for Best Actor in a Play for his performance as the title character in &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; on Broadway, as well as a 2005 nomination for his role as Katurian in the Broadway production of &quot;The Pillowman&quot;, also starring Jeff Goldblum, which closed on September 18, 2005. From October 2006 through May 2007, he was featured in the first two parts of &quot;The Coast of Utopia&quot; by Tom Stoppard at Lincoln Center, playing literary critic Vissarion Belinsky, for which he received a 2007 Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play.

He starred in &quot;The Metal Children&quot;, an off-Broadway play written and directed by Adam Rapp in 2010.

In 2011, Crudup received a Tony Award nomination for Featured Actor in a Play for his role in the Broadway revival of &quot;Arcadia&quot;.

In August 2013, he co-starred with Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart in the Harold Pinter play &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; as well as in &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre. The shows transferred to The Cort Theatre in New York City, where they ran in repertory until March 2014.

In November 2017, he starred in the world premiere of David Cale&#x27;s one-man play &quot;Harry Clarke&quot; at Vineyard Theatre. It moved to the Minetta Lane Theatre the following spring.

===Other work===
From 1998 to 2005, Crudup was the narrator for the U.S. television ad campaign &quot;Priceless&quot; for Mastercard. In the ads, the narrator (Crudup) lists the prices of two goods or services, then lists some third, intangible benefit gained from those purchases and concludes, &quot;priceless&quot;. He said in 2005 that appearing in the ads &quot;changed my life&quot;, in that they gave him the financial freedom to pursue the acting work that he wanted to do.

He appeared as Zartan in the 2009 parody video &quot;The Ballad of G.I. Joe&quot; on the website Funny or Die.

==Personal life==
From 1996 to November 2003, Crudup was in a relationship with actress Mary-Louise Parker. She was seven months pregnant with their son, William Atticus Parker, born in January 2004, when Crudup ended their relationship and began dating actress Claire Danes. Crudup and Danes separated in 2006. In 2017, Crudup began dating British actress Naomi Watts, after the two met on the set of the Netflix drama series &quot;Gypsy&quot;. The couple married in New York City in June 2023. In June 2024, Watts and Crudup celebrated their nuptials in a second ceremony surrounded by their family in Mexico.

<doc id="659316" wikidata="Q169352" url="?curid=659316" title="Zeami Motokiyo">
<text>(c. 1363 – c. 1443), also called , was a Japanese aesthetician, actor, and playwright.

His father, Kan&#x27;ami Kiyotsugu, introduced him to Noh theater performance at a young age, and found that he was a skilled actor. Kan&#x27;ami was also skilled in acting and formed a family theater ensemble. As it grew in popularity, Zeami had the opportunity to perform in front of the Shōgun, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. The Shōgun was impressed by the young actor and began to compose a love affair with him. Zeami was introduced to Yoshimitsu&#x27;s court and was provided with an education in classical literature and philosophy while continuing to act. In 1374, Zeami received patronage and made acting his career. After the death of his father in 1385, he led the family troupe, a role in which he found greater success.

Zeami mixed a variety of Classical and Modern themes in his writing, and made use of Japanese and Chinese traditions. He incorporated numerous themes of Zen Buddhism into his works and later commentators have debated the extent of his personal interest in Zen. The exact number of plays that he wrote is unknown, but is likely to be between 30 and 50. He wrote many treatises about Noh, discussing the philosophy of performance. These treatises are the oldest known works on the philosophy of drama in Japanese literature, but did not see popular circulation until the 20th-century.

After the death of Yoshimitsu, his successor Ashikaga Yoshimochi was less favorable to Zeami&#x27;s drama. Zeami successfully sought out patronage from wealthy merchants and continued his career under their support. He became well-known and well-respected in Japanese society. Ashikaga Yoshinori became hostile toward Zeami after becoming Shōgun in 1429. Yoshinori held Zeami&#x27;s nephew Onnami in high regard, and disagreed with Zeami&#x27;s refusal to declare Onnami his successor as leader of his troupe. Possibly due to this disagreement, though a variety of competing theories have been advanced, Yoshinori sent Zeami into exile to Sado Island. After Yoshinori&#x27;s death in 1441, Zeami returned to mainland Japan, where he died in 1443.

==Early life==
Zeami was born in 1363 near Nara and was known as Kiyomoto as a child. A later genealogy mentions his mother as the daughter of a priest and a military official, but it is not deemed reliable. His father Kanami led a theater troupe which primarily performed in the Kyoto region, before becoming popular in the late 1360s and early 1370s. As they became better-known, Kanami&#x27;s troupe began to perform in Daijogi. Zeami acted in the troupe and was considered attractive and highly skilled.

Ebina no Naami, an adviser of the Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, booked the troupe to perform for the Shōgun, who was then 17 years old. The shōgun was very powerful politically and was a patron of the arts. He was impressed by the troupe, and patronized Kanami. The troupe began to focus on the entertainment value of performance, rather than its religious significance. It had been a form of entertainment associated with the country, but with Yoshimitsu&#x27;s support it became associated with the upper class. The Shōgun was highly attracted to Zeami, which proved controversial among aristocrats because of Zeami&#x27;s lower-class background. Yoshimitsu regularly invited Kanami and Zeami to the court, and Zeami accompanied him to events. Due to his connection with the Shōgun, Zeami was provided with a classical education by court statesman and poet Nijo Yoshimoto. Nijo was renowned for his skill as a Renga and taught Zeami about literature, poetry, and philosophy. This type of education was very unusual for an actor: due to their lower-class backgrounds, actors received little education.

==Career==

Zeami received patronage in 1374, which was then an uncommon honor for an actor. Patronage allowed him to become a vocational artist and he began to lead the troupe after his father&#x27;s death in 1385. The troupe became successful during his tenure as a leader. While leading the troupe, he wrote the first Japanese treatises on pragmatic aesthetics.

Zeami adhered to a formalist writing process: he began with a topic, determined the structure, and finished by writing the lyrics. The number of plays that he wrote is uncertain, and is estimated to be around 50 or 60. His intellectual interests were eclectic and he was a proficient writer of Renga. &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot; was the source of several of his best known plays. He integrated Japanese and Chinese ancient poetry into his drama. Contemporary dramatists Doami and Zoami had a significant influence on him, earning recognition in his treatises. He spoke particularly well of Zoami, but his shift toward Yugen and away from Monomane may have been because of Doami&#x27;s influence. He mixed popular dance, drama, and music with classical poetics and thus broadened and popularized the classical tradition. In his earlier work, he used Zen illustrations, creating new Zen words and using established Zen words out of context. Many of the themes he used are present in other schools of Buddhism. Japan was dominated by a focus on Zen culture then, and he was registered at a Zen temple and was a friend of a well-known Zen priest. In 1422, he became a lay monk.

One of the most important performances of Zeami&#x27;s career occurred in 1394. At that time, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu visited the Kasuga shrine in Nara and Zeami performed during the visit. It was a significant political event, so Zeami was likely a well known artist then. He gave two significant performances for the Shōgun in 1399, one of which could have been attended by Emperor Go-Komatsu.

Zeami found Yoshimitsu to be a difficult patron, and was rivaled by Inuo, a Sarugaku actor, for the favor of the Shōgun. Though Yoshimitsu died in 1408, and new Shōgun, Yoshimochi, was indifferent to Zeami and preferred the dengaku work of Zoami, Zeami&#x27;s career remained strong due to his connections with the urban commercial class. Due to his status as a well respected public figure, he had access to a number of patrons. He eventually reached the stature of a celebrity and wrote a significant amount between 1418 and 1428.

==Plays==
Authorship of noh plays is a complex issue and often a matter of debate. Many plays have been attributed to Zeami, and he was known to be involved in revising and transmitting many others. Some plays are decisively known to have been written by him. His plays have been passed down through generations of Kanze leaders, as a result they have been revised and reworked from various leaders. The following are universally attributed to Zeami: 

* Akoya no Matsu, currently not in the noh repertoire
* Atsumori
* Hanjo
* Izutsu, probably written in the late 1420s or early 1430s
* Kinuta, probably written in the early 1430s
* Matsukaze, using a section by Kan&#x27;ami
* Saigyo Zakura
* Sekidera Komachi
* Tadanori
* Takasago
* Yamanba
* Yashima

==Treatises==
Zeami produced 21 critical writings over a period of roughly four decades. His treatises discuss the principles of Noh. He sought to inform his colleagues of the most important aspects of theater, discussing the education of the actor, character acting, music, and physical movement. They also discussed broader themes, such as how life should be lived. The treatises were intended for a small circle of his colleagues, since the troupes were hereditary and such information was traditionally passed down between generations. He desired to facilitate this process to ensure continued patronage for the troupe.

===Fūshikaden===
Zeami wrote several treatises on drama, the first of which was the , known colloquially as . It is the first known treatise on drama in Japan; though similar treatises were written by Japanese Buddhist sects and poets, this is the Noh treatise. J. Thomas Rimer suggests that Zeami&#x27;s education in Renga poetry provided him with the idea. It notably includes a thorough analysis of jo-ha-kyū, which Zeami viewed as a universal concept. His first treatise includes much of his father&#x27;s views of Noh.

===Kakyo===
The treatise &quot;Kakyo&quot; was written later and describes Zeami&#x27;s personal views. Though &quot;Fushikaden&quot; discusses flowers at length, &quot;Kakyo&quot; deals with spiritual beauty and contains discourses on the voice of the actor and the actors&#x27; minds. A possible interest in Zen has been credited with this shift by some scholars. The change in his age between his first and last works also appears to have significantly affected his perspective. He spent a significant amount of time writing &quot;Kakyo&quot; and gave the completed work to his son Motomasa, Zeami&#x27;s son Motoyoshi had previously transcribed Zeami&#x27;s treatise &quot;Reflections on Art&quot;.

==Decline==
After Ashikaga Yoshinori became the Shōgun, he demonstrated a deeper disdain for Zeami than his predecessors had, though the origins of his feelings are unknown. Speculation has centered on Zeami&#x27;s association with Masashige and the theory that Zeami was a restorationist. In 1967, the Kanze-Fukudu genealogy was found and gave credence to the idea that politics contributed to Yoshinori&#x27;s treatment of Zeami. The genealogy showed that a brother of Zeami&#x27;s mother was a supporter of the southern court against the Ashikaga Shogunate. Yoshinori is sometimes seen as eccentric, and it has been speculated that he punished Zeami because he did not enjoy his performances. (Yoshinori preferred colorful plays that involved actors portraying demons; these types of plays were seldom found in Zeami&#x27;s repertoire.) Yoshinori, who enjoyed Monomane, preferred Onnami, as his performances included demons. Zeami had been close with his Onnami and they had performed together. Zeami had been unsure whether any of his sons would be able to lead the troupe after his death, so he paid special attention to Onnami&#x27;s development. Motomasa, however, began to lead the troupe in 1429. That year, though Motomasa and Onnami each performed for Yoshinori during a 10-day festival Yoshinori forbade Zeami to appear at the Sentō Imperial Palace, possibly due to his refusal to provide Onnami with his complete writings. The next year, the music directorship of the Kiyotaki shrine was transferred from Motomasa to Onnami. That year Zeami&#x27;s son Motoyoshi retired from acting to serve as a Buddhist priest. That same year Motomasa died; it has been speculated that he was murdered. Though he had lost political favor, Zeami continued to write prolifically.

Onnami inherited the leadership of Zeami&#x27;s Kanze school. The appointment was made by the Shogunate, although the troupes were traditionally hereditary. Zeami initially opposed Onnami&#x27;s leadership of the troupe, but he eventually acquiesced. Zeami believed that his line had died with Motomasa, but Onnami felt that he continued the line. Zeami gave his completed works to Konparu Zenchiku, rather than to Onnami.

==Sado Island==
In 1434, Zeami was exiled to Sado Island. He completed his last recorded work two years later, providing a detailed first-person account of his exile. In the account he conveys a stoic attitude toward his misfortunes. Little is known about the end of his life, but it was traditionally believed that he was pardoned and return to the mainland before his death. Zeami died in 1443 and was buried in Yamato. His wife died a short time later.

==Legacy==
Zeami is known as the foremost writer of Noh and the artist who brought it to its classical epitome. Scholars attribute roughly 50 plays to him, many of which have been translated into European languages. The contemporary versions of his plays are sometimes simplified. Some of his plays are no longer extant, and roughly 16 exist only in the form of rare manuscripts.

There are few extant biographical documents of Zeami, the lack of solid information about his life has led to a significant amount of speculation. Some common themes in the speculation are that Zeami could have been a spy, a Ji sect priest, or a Zen master.

Zeami&#x27;s treatises were not widely available after his death; only the upper-class warriors were able to gain access to them. In 1908, several of the treatises were discovered at a used books store in Japan. They gained wider circulation after this discovery but a complete set was not published until 1940. Zeami&#x27;s plays have been continually performed in Japan since they were first written.

A crater on the planet Mercury was named after Zeami in 1976.

<text>Jamestown is the capital city of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, located on the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is also the historic main settlement of the island and is on its north-western coast. Before the development of the port at Rupert&#x27;s Bay, it was the island&#x27;s only port and the centre of the island&#x27;s road and communications network. It was founded when colonists from the English East India Company settled on the island in 1659 and was briefly occupied by the Dutch East India Company in 1673 before being recaptured. Many of the buildings built by the East India Company in the 18th century survive and give the town its distinctive Georgian flavour.

The city briefly hosted Napoleon in 1815 during his exile on St. Helena and later served as a base for the Royal Navy&#x27;s efforts to suppress the slave trade. It had no role during the First World War and only played a minor role during the Second World War.

==History==
Jamestown was founded in 1659 by the East India Company and is named after James, Duke of York, the future King James II of England. A fort, originally named the Castle of St John, was quickly built and, with the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, the fort was renamed James Fort, the town Jamestown and the valley James Valley. The fort and associated gun batteries dominated James Bay and were sporadically improved over the years. In January 1673 the Dutch East India Company briefly seized control of the island until the English East India Company recaptured it in May. Since then the town has been continuously inhabited under English and then British rule.

After his defeat in the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815 and the subsequent occupation of Paris, the Emperor of the French, Napoleon, surrendered to the British and was exiled to St Helena. He arrived on 21 October aboard the 74-gun ship and resided at the Briars in Jamestown for several months until he was transferred to Longwood House in a more remote part of the island in December. Jamestown was chosen to host a vice admiralty court and a naval base for British efforts to stop the slave traffic between Africa and the Americas. Captured slave ships were often brought to Jamestown to be sold and their cargos were off-loaded in Rupert&#x27;s Valley. By the time that the naval station was closed in the 1870s, an estimated 25,000 slaves had been rescued, although about 5,000 died shortly after arrival and were buried in Rupert&#x27;s Valley. Their graves, long lost, were rediscovered in 2006 in conjunction with preliminary digging for the airport. A team of archaeologists arrived in mid-2008 to excavate the graves. Some of the finds from the excavations are on exhibit at the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool, England.

The island was too isolated to play any role in the First World War and only played a minimal one during the Second World War. The oil tanker RFA &quot;Darkdale&quot; was sunk by the in James Bay on 22 October 1941 with only nine of the 50-man crew surviving. She had been sent to St Helena a few months earlier to refuel ships operating in the South Atlantic. The wreck continued to leak small amounts of oil until June 2015 when the Ministry of Defence sent a team of divers to pump out all the remaining oil.

==Geography and description==

The city is built on igneous rock in the James Valley, sandwiched between steep cliffs. It is therefore rather long and thin. The walls of the valley are rough and steep, and rockfalls have been a problem, although now minimised by netting. A small stream, the &quot;Run&quot;, runs through the valley. The city is commonly divided into lower and upper parts, depending on the distance up James Valley. Being the island&#x27;s main port (and with the Saint Helena Airport only receiving its first scheduled flight in October 2017) the city is still currently the main entrance to the island to visitors. Despite not being connected to Jamestown proper by road, Rupert&#x27;s Valley, the next valley north, is also part of the city. It houses much of the island&#x27;s infrastructure, such as its power station and associated fuel storage, and a one-ship wharf was completed in June 2016.

The city has over 100 listed buildings, mostly from the Georgian era. Main Street has been described as &quot;one of the best examples of unspoilt Georgian architecture anywhere in the world.&quot; Many buildings are built out of local volcanic rock. St James&#x27; Church dates from 1772 and is the oldest Anglican church in the Southern Hemisphere. Another of the city&#x27;s prominent features is Jacob&#x27;s Ladder, a staircase of 699 steps, built in 1829 to connect Jamestown to the former fort on Ladder Hill. The ladder is very popular with tourists, is lit at night and a timed run takes place there every year, with people coming from all over the world to take part. The Museum of Saint Helena is situated in Jamestown, one of two museums on the island (the other being Longwood House).

==Formal status==

Jamestown is formally a city, a status granted by Queen Victoria in 1859, and its full name is the &quot;City of James Town&quot;. It is also one of the 8 districts (administrative divisions) and is the capital of both the island of Saint Helena and the British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. The Castle, one of the oldest buildings in the city, is one of the main government buildings.

==Climate==
Jamestown features a tropical hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BWh&quot;) with essentially consistent temperatures throughout the year. Despite the fact that the city has a desert climate, its temperatures are moderated by the adjacent ocean and cold currents therein, leading to a cool climate for the deep tropical latitude. As a result, it seldom gets very hot in Jamestown. The temperature in the Jamestown area is some warmer than the rest of the island, because of the difference in altitude. While Jamestown receives less than of rainfall per year, the higher parts of the island are also wetter than the city, which lies on the drier coast and in a sheltered location. The highlands above Jamestown receive up to per year of precipitation and are lush with vegetation. The surrounding waters can be quite rough at times, and there is a sea wall to protect the settlement.

==Population==

As of 2016, the district Jamestown had 629 residents, a significant decline since the 2008 population of 714. The city&#x27;s population has been shrinking and it is no longer the largest settlement on the island, having been surpassed by Half Tree Hollow, Saint Paul&#x27;s and Longwood.

==Education==
As a British territory, the island follows the British education system. There is one primary school, serving children ages four to eleven, in Jamestown, Pilling Primary School, which was created by the amalgamation of Jamestown First School and Pilling Middle School in September 2007. The island&#x27;s only secondary school is Prince Andrew School in Saint Paul&#x27;s.

==Religion==

The Anglican Parish of St. James is one of the three parishes of the Diocese of St Helena on the island. St James&#x27; Church is the primary church in the parish and is the oldest Anglican Church in the southern hemisphere; the present building was put up in 1772. There are 3 daughter churches: St John&#x27;s, in Upper Jamestown, St Mary&#x27;s, the Briars, and St Michael&#x27;s, in Rupert&#x27;s Valley. The sole Catholic Church in St Helena, Sacred Heart Church, is located in Jamestown; as is a Baptist church.

<doc id="659318" wikidata="Q1061040" url="?curid=659318" title="Champ Bailey">
<text>Roland &quot;Champ&quot; Bailey Jr. (born June 22, 1978) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs, where he earned consensus All-American honors, and was selected by the Washington Redskins in the first round of the 1999 NFL draft.

In 2004, Bailey was traded to the Denver Broncos, where he played for ten seasons until he was released in early 2014, following the Broncos Super Bowl XLVIII loss. Bailey signed with the New Orleans Saints shortly afterward but was released before the start of the regular season. In October 2014, Bailey announced his retirement from the NFL after 15 seasons. He was selected to 12 Pro Bowls in his career, the most ever for a cornerback. He holds the current NFL record for most passes defended, with 203. In 2019, he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. Bailey is widely considered to be one of the greatest cornerbacks in NFL history.

==Early life==
Bailey was born in Fort Campbell, Kentucky and grew up in Folkston, Georgia, where he was a three-sport athlete (football, basketball, track) at Charlton County High School. His two brothers, Ronald and Boss Bailey, also played football at Charlton County and the University of Georgia. Champ&#x27;s first two seasons at Georgia overlapped with Ronald&#x27;s last two seasons; Champ then played his final season alongside Boss. Ronald went on to sign with the NFL&#x27;s Dallas Cowboys but suffered a career-ending injury. Boss played linebacker in the NFL for the Detroit Lions from 2003 to 2007, then joined Champ on the Denver Broncos in 2008.

At Charlton County High School, Bailey recorded 3,573 rushing yards, 58 rushing touchdowns, 13 100-yard rushing games, and 1,211 passing yards on 74 completions. On defense he recorded eight interceptions, while on special teams he returned 26 kickoffs for 731 yards and 22 punts for 318 yards. His total offensive yardage was 5,855 with 394 points scored. He still holds school records for season rushing yards (1,858), season rushing touchdowns (28), season scoring (180), and single-game rushing (417 yards), while also tying the record for single-game rushing touchdowns.

==College career==
Bailey received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Georgia, where he played for the Georgia Bulldogs football team from 1996 to 1998. He was regarded as one of college football&#x27;s greatest multiple threats (offense, defense, and special teams) in his three seasons as a Bulldog. In his final year at Georgia, he registered 52 tackles (four for losses), three interceptions, seven passes deflected, 47 catches for 744 yards (15.8 avg.), five touchdowns, 84 yards rushing on 16 carries, 12 kickoff returns for 261 yards and four punt returns for 49 yards. He averaged 103.5 all-purpose yards per game and logged 957 plays (547 defense, 301 offense, and 109 special teams) on the way to earning consensus first-team All-America and first-team All-Southeastern Conference honors and claiming the Bronko Nagurski Trophy as the nation&#x27;s top defensive player. Against the Virginia Cavaliers in the Peach Bowl, he caught three passes for 73 yards, including a 14-yard touchdown, rushed three times for nine yards, returned five kickoffs for 104 yards, returned a punt 12 yards, and posted two tackles and one pass defended at cornerback. In three years at Georgia, he played 33 games (24 starts) and recorded 147 total tackles, two fumble recoveries, one forced fumble, eight interceptions and 27 passes defended. He was an All-SEC first-team selection as a sophomore, starting every game at left cornerback and one game at wide receiver.

===Track and field===
Bailey was also a standout track and field athlete at Georgia; he ran the 55 meters and 60 meters, recording personal bests of 6.35 seconds and 6.85 seconds, respectively. He also competed in long jump and triple jump.

Bailey set a school indoor long jump record in 1998 of to finish third at the SEC Indoor Track and Field Championships.

==Professional career==
===Washington Redskins===
Bailey was selected with the seventh overall pick in the first round of the 1999 NFL draft by the Redskins. He was the first ever drafted player to come from his hometown of Folkston, Georgia.

On July 24, 1999, Bailey signed a 5-year, $12 million contract including a $2 million signing bonus. Bailey quickly established a reputation as one of the league&#x27;s best defensive backs. He was a large presence on the Redskins defense and benefited from time spent with eventual Hall of Fame cornerback teammates Deion Sanders and Darrell Green. After the 2003 season, Bailey&#x27;s contract with the Redskins expired and he threatened to boycott training camp if the club exercised the franchise tag. In a surprising move, the Redskins gave Bailey permission to seek a trade.

===Denver Broncos===
Prior to the 2004 season, Bailey was traded to Denver along with a second-round draft pick for Clinton Portis.

On September 12, 2004, during the NFL&#x27;s opening Sunday Night Football game of the season against the Kansas City Chiefs, Bailey intercepted his first pass as a Denver Bronco.

On January 14, 2006, in a Divisional Round playoff game against the defending champion New England Patriots, he broke the record for the longest non-scoring play in NFL history at the time. With the Patriots near the goal line, he intercepted a pass from quarterback Tom Brady in the end zone and returned it 100 yards to the New England one-yard line before he was tackled by New England&#x27;s Benjamin Watson.

In 2006, Bailey had 10 interceptions (tied for best in the NFL with Patriots cornerback Asante Samuel) and did not give up a touchdown during the season. Bailey, San Diego Chargers running back LaDainian Tomlinson and Miami Dolphins defensive end Jason Taylor were unanimous choices for the NFL All-Pro team. Following the season&#x27;s conclusion, Bailey finished second in voting for NFL Defensive Player of the Year.

In 2009, Bailey did not allow a touchdown in 80 passes thrown his way that year, played on 98% of the snaps and remained one of the best-tackling cornerbacks in the game.

On September 15, 2009, Bailey was chosen for the Broncos 50th Anniversary team by the Denver community. This team was honored during the halftime show of the Legacy game versus the Patriots on October 11.

In 2010, Bailey matched up against some of the NFL&#x27;s best wideouts. He held Dwayne Bowe to no catches on 2 targets. The Arizona Cardinals only completed 3 passes on him for 19 yards in a game where he matched up with Larry Fitzgerald. Bailey was selected to play in his record-breaking 10th Pro Bowl. No cornerback in NFL history has been to more. He was ranked 48th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.

It was announced on February 22, 2011, by the Broncos vice president of football operations, John Elway, that Bailey was re-signed to a 4-year contract.

During the 2012 offseason, Bailey was named the 46th-best player in the NFL by the league&#x27;s network, NFL Network.

In 2012, Bailey was named an All-Pro for the 8th time of his career and was selected to the 2013 Pro Bowl. The Pro Bowl selection was his 12th, extending the record he set for trips by a cornerback, and tied the record for most Pro Bowls played, along with Randall McDaniel and Will Shields. On December 6, 2012, Bailey recorded the 52nd and final interception of his career, picking off Carson Palmer in a 26–13 victory on Thursday Night Football over the Oakland Raiders. 

During the 2012 AFC Divisional Round against the Baltimore Ravens, Bailey was beaten woefully multiple times on deep routes by Ravens wide receiver Torrey Smith, who totaled 98 yards for two touchdowns on three catches as Baltimore would go on to win in dramatic fashion 38–35 in double overtime, en route to eventually winning Super Bowl XLVII. Bailey’s struggles against Smith led to the initial speculation on the effectiveness of the aging 34-year-old cornerback.

During the 2013 offseason, Bailey was named the 53rd-best player in the NFL by his peers on the league&#x27;s network, NFL Network.

During the course of the 2013 season, while not making his season debut until Week 7 at the Indianapolis Colts, Bailey was limited to a career-low 5 games with a foot injury; however, Bailey returned in time for the playoffs and held his own when fellow cornerback, Chris Harris, was ruled out for the remainder of the season after a torn ACL. Bailey played in his first Super Bowl at Super Bowl XLVIII in which he had 4 tackles in a 43–8 loss to the Seattle Seahawks.

On March 6, 2014, the Denver Broncos released Bailey.

===New Orleans Saints===
On April 4, 2014, Champ Bailey signed a two-year, $7 million contract with the New Orleans Saints. Bailey failed to make the final roster and was released by the team on August 30, 2014.

===Retirement===
Bailey announced his retirement from professional football on October 18, 2014.
On November 14, 2014, it was announced that Bailey would sign a one-day contract with Denver to allow him to officially retire as a Bronco.

===Pro Football Hall of Fame===
On February 2, 2019, Bailey was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. He was enshrined on August 3, 2019, during a ceremony in Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.

== Personal life ==
Bailey married his wife, Jessica, at the Pelican Hill resort in Newport Beach, California in 2014.

Bailey was inducted into the Kentucky Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2019.

<text>In complexity theory, PP, or PPT is the class of decision problems solvable by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time, with an error probability of less than 1/2 for all instances. The abbreviation PP refers to probabilistic polynomial time. The complexity class was defined by Gill in 1977.

If a decision problem is in PP, then there is an algorithm for it that is allowed to flip coins and make random decisions. It is guaranteed to run in polynomial time. If the answer is YES, the algorithm will answer YES with probability more than 1/2. If the answer is NO, the algorithm will answer YES with probability less than 1/2. In more practical terms, it is the class of problems that can be solved to any fixed degree of accuracy by running a randomized, polynomial-time algorithm a sufficient (but bounded) number of times.

Turing machines that are polynomially-bound and probabilistic are characterized as PPT, which stands for probabilistic polynomial-time machines. This characterization of Turing machines does not require a bounded error probability. Hence, PP is the complexity class containing all problems solvable by a PPT machine with an error probability of less than 1/2.

An alternative characterization of PP is the set of problems that can be solved by a nondeterministic Turing machine in polynomial time where the acceptance condition is that a majority (more than half) of computation paths accept. Because of this some authors have suggested the alternative name &quot;Majority-P&quot;.

==Definition==
A language &quot;L&quot; is in PP if and only if there exists a probabilistic Turing machine &quot;M&quot;, such that
* &quot;M&quot; runs for polynomial time on all inputs
* For all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;L&quot;, &quot;M&quot; outputs 1 with probability no less than 1/2
* For all &quot;x&quot; not in &quot;L&quot;, &quot;M&quot; outputs 1 with probability strictly less than 1/2.

Alternatively, PP can be defined using only deterministic Turing machines. A language &quot;L&quot; is in PP if and only if there exists a polynomial &quot;p&quot; and deterministic Turing machine &quot;M&quot;, such that
* &quot;M&quot; runs for polynomial time on all inputs
* For all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;L&quot;, the fraction of strings &quot;y&quot; of length &quot;p&quot;(|&quot;x&quot;|) which satisfy &quot;M(x,y)&quot; = 1 is greater than 1/2
* For all &quot;x&quot; not in &quot;L&quot;, the fraction of strings &quot;y&quot; of length &quot;p&quot;(|&quot;x&quot;|) which satisfy &quot;M(x,y)&quot; = 1 is less than 1/2.

In this definition, the string &quot;y&quot; corresponds to the output of the random coin flips that the probabilistic Turing machine would have made.

In both definitions, &quot;less than&quot; can be changed to &quot;less than or equal to&quot; (see below), and the threshold 1/2 can be replaced by any fixed rational number in (0,1), without changing the class.

==PP vs BPP==
BPP is a subset of PP; it can be seen as the subset for which there are efficient probabilistic algorithms. The distinction is in the error probability that is allowed: in BPP, an algorithm must give correct answer (YES or NO) with probability exceeding some fixed constant c &gt; 1/2, such as 2/3 or 501/1000. If this is the case, then we can run the algorithm a number of times and take a majority vote to achieve any desired probability of correctness less than 1, using the Chernoff bound. This number of repeats increases if &quot;c&quot; becomes closer to 1/2, but it does not depend on the input size &quot;n&quot;.

More generally, if &quot;c&quot; can depend on the input size formula_1 polynomially, as formula_2, then we can rerun the algorithm for formula_3 and take the majority vote. By Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality, this gives us a BPP algorithm.

The important thing is that this constant &quot;c&quot; is not allowed to depend on the input. On the other hand, a PP algorithm is permitted to do something like the following:
* On a YES instance, output YES with probability 1/2 + 1/2&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the length of the input.
* On a NO instance, output YES with probability 1/2 − 1/2&quot;n&quot;.

Because these two probabilities are &quot;exponentially&quot; close together, even if we run it for a &quot;polynomial&quot; number of times it is very difficult to tell whether we are operating on a YES instance or a NO instance. Attempting to achieve a fixed desired probability level using a majority vote and the Chernoff bound requires a number of repetitions that is exponential in &quot;n&quot;.

==PP compared to other complexity classes==

PP includes BPP, since probabilistic algorithms described in the definition of BPP form a subset of those in the definition of PP.

PP also includes NP. To prove this, we show that the NP-complete satisfiability problem belongs to PP. Consider a probabilistic algorithm that, given a formula &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) chooses an assignment &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; uniformly at random. Then, the algorithm checks if the assignment makes the formula &quot;F&quot; true. If yes, it outputs YES. Otherwise, it outputs YES with probability formula_4 and NO with probability formula_5.

If the formula is unsatisfiable, the algorithm will always output YES with probability formula_6. If there exists a satisfying assignment, it will output YES with probability at least
formula_7
(exactly 1/2 if it picked an unsatisfying assignment and 1 if it picked a satisfying assignment, averaging to some number greater than 1/2). Thus, this algorithm puts satisfiability in PP. As SAT is NP-complete, and we can prefix any deterministic polynomial-time many-one reduction onto the PP algorithm, NP is included in PP. Because PP is closed under complement, it also includes co-NP.

Furthermore, PP includes MA, which subsumes the previous two inclusions.

PP also includes BQP, the class of decision problems solvable by efficient polynomial time quantum computers. In fact, BQP is low for PP, meaning that a PP machine achieves no benefit from being able to solve BQP problems instantly. The class of polynomial time on quantum computers with postselection, PostBQP, is equal to PP (see #PostBQP below).

Furthermore, PP includes QMA, which subsumes inclusions of MA and BQP.

A polynomial time Turing machine with a PP oracle (PPP) can solve all problems in PH, the entire polynomial hierarchy. This result was shown by Seinosuke Toda in 1989 and is known as Toda&#x27;s theorem. This is evidence of how hard it is to solve problems in PP. The class #P is in some sense about as hard, since P#P = PPP and therefore P#P includes PH as well.

PP strictly includes uniform TC0, the class of constant-depth, unbounded-fan-in boolean circuits with majority gates that are uniform (generated by a polynomial-time algorithm).

PP is included in PSPACE. This can be easily shown by exhibiting a polynomial-space algorithm for MAJSAT, defined below; simply try all assignments and count the number of satisfying ones.

PP is not included in SIZE(nk) for any k, by Kannan&#x27;s theorem.

==Complete problems and other properties==
Unlike BPP, PP is a syntactic rather than semantic class. Any polynomial-time probabilistic machine recognizes some language in PP. In contrast, given a description of a polynomial-time probabilistic machine, it is undecidable in general to determine if it recognizes a language in BPP.

PP has natural complete problems, for example, MAJSAT. MAJSAT is a decision problem in which one is given a Boolean formula F. The answer must be YES if more than half of all assignments &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; make F true and NO otherwise.

===Proof that PP is closed under complement===
Let &quot;L&quot; be a language in PP. Let formula_8 denote the complement of &quot;L&quot;. By the definition of PP there is a polynomial-time probabilistic algorithm &quot;A&quot; with the property that 

:formula_9

We claim that without loss of generality, the latter inequality is always strict; the theorem can be deduced from this claim: let formula_10 denote the machine which is the same as &quot;A&quot; except that formula_10 accepts when &quot;A&quot; would reject, and vice versa. Then 

:formula_12

which implies that formula_8 is in PP.

Now we justify our without loss of generality assumption. Let formula_14 be the polynomial upper bound on the running time of &quot;A&quot; on input &quot;x&quot;. Thus &quot;A&quot; makes at most formula_14 random coin flips during its execution. In particular the probability of acceptance is an integer multiple of formula_16 and we have:

:formula_17 

Define a machine &quot;A&quot;′ as follows: on input &quot;x&quot;, &quot;A&quot;′ runs &quot;A&quot; as a subroutine, and rejects if &quot;A&quot; would reject; otherwise, if &quot;A&quot; would accept, &quot;A&quot;′ flips formula_18 coins and rejects if they are all heads, and accepts otherwise. Then 

:formula_19
and
:formula_20

This justifies the assumption (since &quot;A&quot;′ is still a polynomial-time probabilistic algorithm) and completes the proof.

David Russo proved in his 1985 Ph.D. thesis that PP is closed under symmetric difference. It was an open problem for 14 years whether PP was closed under union and intersection; this was settled in the affirmative by Beigel, Reingold, and Spielman. Alternate proofs were later given by Li and Aaronson (see #PostBQP below).

==Other equivalent complexity classes==

===PostBQP===
The quantum complexity class BQP is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time on a quantum Turing machine. By adding postselection, a larger class called PostBQP is obtained. Informally, postselection gives the computer the following power: whenever some event (such as measuring a qubit in a certain state) has nonzero probability, you are allowed to assume that it takes place. Scott Aaronson showed in 2004 that PostBQP is equal to PP. This reformulation of PP makes it easier to show certain results, such as that PP is closed under intersection (and hence, under union), that BQP is low for PP, and that QMA is included in PP.

===PQP===
PP is also equal to another quantum complexity class known as PQP, which is the unbounded error analog of BQP. It denotes the class of decision problems solvable by a quantum computer in polynomial time, with an error probability of less than 1/2 for all instances. Even if all amplitudes used for PQP-computation are drawn from algebraic numbers, still PQP coincides with PP.

<text>Edward Hugh McDaniel (June 19, 1938 – April 18, 2002) was an American professional football player and professional wrestler better known by his ring name Wahoo McDaniel. He is notable for having held the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship five times. McDaniel was a major star in the American Wrestling Association and prominent National Wrestling Alliance affiliated promotions such as Championship Wrestling from Florida, Georgia Championship Wrestling, NWA Big Time Wrestling and, most notably, Jim Crockett Promotions.

McDaniel is often compared to his contemporary, Chief Jay Strongbow, due to both portraying similar Native American gimmicks.

==Early life==
McDaniel was born in the small town of Bernice, Louisiana, in 1938. His family was Choctaw-Chickasaw, and he was a member of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. His father Hugh, worked in the oil industry and moved to several towns before settling down in Midland, Texas. He attended Midland High School, where he was a track state champion in the shot put and second in the state in the discus. One of his baseball coaches, particularly for his Pony League team, was George H. W. Bush. The name &quot;Wahoo&quot; actually came from his father, who was known as &quot;Big Wahoo&quot;. Though he was a problematic teenager, he was recruited to the University of Oklahoma by Bud Wilkinson. While attending, he was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity and also a part of Wilkinson&#x27;s Sooners football program, where he holds the record for the longest punt at 91 yards.

==Professional football career==
McDaniel began his career as a professional football player in 1960 in the American Football League (AFL), playing for the Houston Oilers during their inaugural AFL Championship-winning season. He then played for the Denver Broncos between 1961 and 1963. After he started playing as a linebacker for the New York Jets in 1964, McDaniel started wearing a custom jersey which had the name &quot;Wahoo&quot; sewn on the back above jersey 54, and whenever he made a tackle as a Jet, the public address announcer would ask the crowd WHO made that tackle, in which the crowd would shout, &quot;Wahoo! Wahoo! Wahoo!&quot; After two seasons with the Jets, McDaniel went to the Miami Dolphins in 1966, and played with this team until his retirement after the 1968 season.

==Professional wrestling career==
While with the Houston Oilers, McDaniel also trained with NWA Amarillo wrestling promoter Dory Funk Sr. and became a professional wrestler as a way to supplement his income by the time he was traded to the Denver Broncos in 1961. After he was traded to the New York Jets in 1964, McDaniel began wrestling for Vincent J. McMahon&#x27;s World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). The promoter wanted him to play off his Native American heritage, thus he was given the moniker &quot;Chief&quot; Wahoo McDaniel. After he was traded to the Miami Dolphins in 1966, McDaniel began wrestling for Eddie Graham&#x27;s Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF). When his football career ended in 1969, McDaniel became a full-time wrestler; in his first year, McDaniel became involved in NWA Texas and won the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship.

While wrestling in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), McDaniel engaged in a feud with Superstar Billy Graham. Along with Johnny Valentine, Superstar Billy Graham was regarded as one of McDaniel&#x27;s earliest and bitter rivals. Between 1973 and 1974, McDaniel and Superstar would engage in numerous wrestling bouts in what was considered one of the AWA&#x27;s top-drawing feuds of the 1970s. Some of these bouts included Indian Strap Matches and also tag team matches which pitted McDaniel and The Crusher against Superstar and Ivan Koloff. In 1974, McDaniel came to Mid-Atlantic to wrestle for Jim Crockett Promotions and help build up the territory as a singles territory in a feud with a rival from Texas, Johnny Valentine. The feud evolved into a tag feud with McDaniel and Paul Jones taking on Valentine and Ric Flair, who McDaniel met in the AWA.

McDaniel and Valentine had a historical feud remembered for the sheer force of their punch/chop exchanges, both men widely known for their hard-hitting style. On June 29, 1975, McDaniel won the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship by defeating Valentine. In 1977, Johnny Valentine&#x27;s son Greg Valentine attacked McDaniel and broke his leg in an angle to establish Greg as Johnny&#x27;s successor. Valentine originally won the title on June 11, 1977, with McDaniel regaining it two months later. On September 7, 1977, Valentine regained the title at the WRAL-TV studio tapings, breaking McDaniel&#x27;s leg in the process. This angle is particularly remembered for a follow-up interview weeks later with Flair and Valentine throwing change at McDaniel, and Valentine asking him if he needed a custom-made wheelchair for his fat body. Valentine then infuriated fans (thus building up the demand for a rematch) by parading around in T-shirts which read &quot;I Broke Wahoo&#x27;s Leg&quot; and &quot;No More Wahoo.&quot;

McDaniel also worked for World Championship Wrestling&#x27;s Slamboree 1993: A Legends&#x27; Reunion pay-per-view on May 23, 1993, where he teamed with Blackjack Mulligan and Jim Brunzell and fought Dick Murdoch, Don Muraco and Jimmy Snuka to a no-contest. At Slamboree on May 23, 1995, he defeated Murdoch. He also worked in independent shows until retiring in 1996.

==Personal life==
McDaniel was married four times to three different women. With his first wife, Monta Rae, he had two daughters, Nikki, born in June 1963 and living in Houston and Cindi, born in October 1965 and living in Azle, Texas. He also has four grandchildren, from Nikki Rowe (Dustin and Brittany)and from Cindi Blank (twins Morgan and Taylor as well as four great-grandchildren. Dustin has(Vayda and Bo Wayne), Morgan (Monroe) and Taylor (Rory). He was also an avid golfer and hunter.

McDaniel&#x27;s health started to deteriorate in the mid-1990s, which led to his retirement in 1996, and he eventually lost both kidneys in 2000. He was awaiting a kidney transplant when he suffered a stroke and died of complications from diabetes and kidney failure on April 18, 2002, in Houston, Texas. His body was cremated and his ashes are with his daughter Nikki in Houston, Texas.

<text>Dramatic monologue is a type of poetry written in the form of a speech of an individual character. M.H. Abrams notes the following three features of the &quot;dramatic monologue&quot; as it applies to poetry:
==Types of dramatic monologue==

One of the most important influences on the development of the dramatic monologue is romantic poetry. However, the long, personal lyrics typical of the Romantic period are not dramatic monologues, in the sense that they do not, for the most part, imply a concentrated narrative. Poems such as William Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;Tintern Abbey&quot; and Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Mont Blanc&quot;, to name two famous examples, offered a model of close psychological observation and philosophical or pseudo-philosophical inquiry described in a specific setting. The conversation poems of Samuel Taylor Coleridge are perhaps a better precedent. The genre was also developed by Felicia Hemans and Letitia Elizabeth Landon, beginning in the latter&#x27;s case with her long poem &quot;The Improvisatrice&quot;.

The novel and plays have also been important influences on the dramatic monologue, particularly as a means of characterization. Dramatic monologues are a way of expressing the views of a character and offering the audience greater insight into that character&#x27;s feelings. Dramatic monologues can also be used in novels to tell stories, as in Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, and to implicate the audience in moral judgements, as in Albert Camus&#x27; &quot;The Fall&quot; and Mohsin Hamid&#x27;s &quot;The Reluctant Fundamentalist&quot;.

== Examples ==

The Victorian period represented the high point of the dramatic monologue in English poetry.

*Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, published in 1842, has been called the first true dramatic monologue. After &quot;Ulysses&quot;, Tennyson&#x27;s most famous efforts in this vein are &quot;Tithonus&quot;, &quot;The Lotos-Eaters,&quot; and &quot;St. Simon Stylites,&quot; all from the 1842 &quot;Poems&quot;; later monologues appear in other volumes, notably &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;.
*Matthew Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Dover Beach&quot; and &quot;Stanzas from the Grand Chartreuse&quot; are famous, semi-autobiographical monologues. The former, usually regarded as the supreme expression of the growing scepticism of the mid-Victorian period, was published along with the latter in 1867&#x27;s &quot;New Poems.&quot;
*Robert Browning produced his most famous work in this form. While &quot;My Last Duchess&quot; is the most famous of his monologues, the form dominated his writing career. &quot;The Ring and the Book&quot;, &quot;Fra Lippo Lippi&quot;, &quot;Caliban upon Setebos&quot;, &quot;Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister&quot; and &quot;Porphyria&#x27;s Lover&quot;, as well as the other poems in &quot;Men and Women&quot; are just a handful of Browning&#x27;s monologues.

Other Victorian poets also used the form. Dante Gabriel Rossetti wrote several, including &quot;Jenny&quot; and &quot;The Blessed Damozel&quot;; Christina Rossetti wrote a number, including &quot;The Convent Threshold.&quot; Augusta Webster&#x27;s &quot;A Castaway,&quot; &quot;Circe&quot;, and &quot;The Happiest Girl in the World&quot;, Amy Levy&#x27;s &quot;Xantippe&quot; and &quot;A Minor Poet,&quot; and Felicia Hemans&#x27;s &quot;Arabella Stuart&quot; and &quot;Properzia Rossi&quot; are all exemplars of this technique. Algernon Charles Swinburne&#x27;s &quot;Hymn to Proserpine&quot; has been called a dramatic monologue vaguely reminiscent of Browning&#x27;s work. Some American poets have also written poems in the genre—famous examples include Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Raven&quot;.

Post-Victorian examples include William Butler Yeats&#x27;s &quot;The Gift of Harun al-Rashid&quot;, Elizabeth Bishop&#x27;s &quot;Crusoe in England&quot;, and T.S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; and &quot;Gerontion&quot;.

==Studies==
A major study of the dramatic monologue was published in 1977 by Alan Sinfield.

<text>An anesthetic (American English) or anaesthetic (British English; see spelling differences) is a drug used to induce anesthesia ⁠— ⁠in other words, to result in a temporary loss of sensation or awareness. They may be divided into two broad classes: general anesthetics, which result in a reversible loss of consciousness, and local anesthetics, which cause a reversible loss of sensation for a limited region of the body without necessarily affecting consciousness.

A wide variety of drugs are used in modern anesthetic practice. Many are rarely used outside anesthesiology, but others are used commonly in various fields of healthcare. Combinations of anesthetics are sometimes used for their synergistic and additive therapeutic effects. Adverse effects, however, may also be increased. Anesthetics are distinct from analgesics, which block only sensation of painful stimuli. Analgesics are typically used in conjunction with anesthetics to control pre-, intra-, and postoperative pain.

== Local anesthetics ==
=== Ester-based ===

* Benzocaine
* Cocaine (historical)
* Procaine
* Tetracaine (sometimes called Amethocaine)

=== Amide-Based ===

* Bupivacaine
* Cinchocaine(INN/BAN)/Dibucaine(USAN)
* Etidocaine
* Levobupivacaine
* Lidocaine
* Mepivacaine
* Prilocaine
* Ropivacaine

Local anesthetic agents prevent the transmission of nerve impulses without causing unconsciousness. They act by reversibly binding to fast sodium channels from within nerve fibers, thereby preventing sodium from entering the fibres, stabilising the cell membrane and preventing action potential propagation. Each of the local anesthetics has the suffix &quot;–caine&quot; in their names.

Local anesthetics can be either ester- or amide-based. Ester local anesthetics are generally unstable in solution and fast-acting, are rapidly metabolised by cholinesterases in the blood plasma and liver, and more commonly induce allergic reactions. Amide local anesthetics are generally heat-stable, with a long shelf life (around two years). Amides have a slower onset and longer half-life than ester anesthetics, and are usually racemic mixtures, with the exception of levobupivacaine (which is S(-) -bupivacaine) and ropivacaine (S(-)-ropivacaine). Although general rules exist for onset and duration of anesthesia between ester- or amide-based local anesthetics, these are properties are ultimately dependent on myriad factors including the lipid solubility of the agent, the concentration of the solution, and the p&quot;K&quot;a. Amides are generally used within regional and epidural or spinal techniques, due to their longer duration of action, which provides adequate analgesia for surgery, labor, and symptomatic relief. Some esters, such as benzocaine and tetracaine, are found in topical formulations to be absorbed through the skin.

Only preservative-free local anesthetic agents may be injected intrathecally.

Pethidine also has local anesthetic properties, in addition to its opioid effects.

== General anesthetics ==

=== Inhaled agents ===

* Desflurane (common)
* Enflurane (largely discontinued)
* Halothane (inexpensive, discontinued)
* Isoflurane (common)
* Methoxyflurane
* Nitrous oxide
* Sevoflurane (common)
* Xenon (rarely used)
Volatile agents are typically organic liquids that evaporate readily. They are given by inhalation for induction or maintenance of general anesthesia. Nitrous oxide and xenon are gases, so they are not considered volatile agents. The ideal volatile anesthetic should be non-flammable, non-explosive, and lipid-soluble. It should possess low blood gas solubility, have no end-organ (heart, liver, kidney) toxicity or side-effects, should not be metabolized, and should not irritate the respiratory pathways.

No anaesthetic agent currently in use meets all these requirements, nor can any anaesthetic agent be considered completely &quot;safe&quot;. There are inherent risks and drug interactions that are specific to each and every patient. The agents in widespread current use are isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, and nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is a common adjuvant gas, making it one of the most long-lived drugs still in current use. Because of its low potency, it cannot produce anesthesia on its own but is frequently combined with other agents. Halothane, an agent introduced in the 1950s, has been almost completely replaced in modern anesthesia practice by newer agents because of its shortcomings. Partly because of its side effects, enflurane never gained widespread popularity.

In theory, any inhaled anesthetic agent can be used for induction of general anesthesia. However, most of the halogenated anesthetics are irritating to the airway, perhaps leading to coughing, laryngospasm and overall difficult inductions. If induction needs to be conducted with an inhaled anesthetic agent, sevoflurane is often used due to a relatively low pungency, rapid increase in alveolar concentration, and a higher blood solubility than other agents. These properties allow for a less irritating and quicker induction as well as a rapid emergence from anesthesia compared to other inhaled agents. All of the volatile agents can be used alone or in combination with other medications to maintain anesthesia (nitrous oxide is not potent enough to be used as a sole agent).

Volatile agents are frequently compared in terms of potency, which is inversely proportional to the minimum alveolar concentration. Potency is directly related to lipid solubility. This is known as the Meyer-Overton hypothesis. However, certain pharmacokinetic properties of volatile agents have become another point of comparison. Most important of those properties is known as the blood/gas partition coefficient. This concept refers to the relative solubility of a given agent in blood. Those agents with a lower blood solubility (i.e., a lower blood–gas partition coefficient; e.g., desflurane) give the anesthesia provider greater rapidity in titrating the depth of anesthesia, and permit a more rapid emergence from the anesthetic state upon discontinuing their administration. In fact, newer volatile agents (e.g., sevoflurane, desflurane) have been popular not due to their potency (minimum alveolar concentration), but due to their versatility for a faster emergence from anesthesia, thanks to their lower blood–gas partition coefficient.

===Intravenous agents (non-opioid)===
While there are many drugs that can be used intravenously to produce anesthesia or sedation, the most common are:
* Barbiturates
** Amobarbital (trade name: Amytal)
** Methohexital (trade name: Brevital)
** Thiamylal (trade name: Surital)
** Thiopental (trade name: Penthothal, referred to as &quot;thiopentone&quot; in the UK)
* Benzodiazepines
** Diazepam
** Lorazepam
** Midazolam
* Etomidate
* Ketamine
* Propofol

Among the barbiturates mentioned above, thiopental and methohexital are ultra-short-acting and are used to induce and maintain anesthesia. However, though they produce unconsciousness, they provide no analgesia (pain relief) and must be used with other agents. Benzodiazepines can be used for sedation before or after surgery and can be used to induce and maintain general anesthesia. When benzodiazepines are used to induce general anesthesia, midazolam is preferred. Benzodiazepines are also used for sedation during procedures that do not require general anesthesia. Like barbiturates, benzodiazepines have no pain-relieving properties.

Etomidate is one of the most commonly used intravenous drugs employed to induce and maintain general anesthesia. It can also be used for sedation during procedures or in the ICU. Like the other agents mentioned above, it renders patients unconscious without producing pain relief. Compared to other IV agents, etomidate causes minimal depression of the cardiopulmonary system. Additionally, etomidate results in a reduction in intracranial pressure and cerebral blood flow. Because of these favorable physiological effects, was a favored agent in the ICU. However, etomidate has since been shown to produce adrenocortical suppression, resulting in decreased use to avoid an increased mortality rate in severely ill patients. Ketamine is infrequently used in anesthesia because of the unpleasant experiences that sometimes occur on emergence from anesthesia, which include &quot;vivid dreaming, extracorporeal experiences, and illusions.&quot; When it is used, it is often paired with a benzodiazepine such as midazolam for amnesia and sedation. However, like etomidate it is frequently used in emergency settings and with sick patients because it produces fewer adverse physiological effects. Unlike the intravenous anesthetic drugs previously mentioned, ketamine produces profound pain relief, even in doses lower than those that induce general anesthesia. Also unlike the other anesthetic agents in this section, patients who receive ketamine alone appear to be in a cataleptic state, unlike other states of anesthesia that resemble normal sleep. Ketamine-anesthetized patients have profound analgesia but keep their eyes open and maintain many reflexes.

== Intravenous opioid analgesic agents ==
While opioids can produce unconsciousness, they do so unreliably and with significant side effects. So, while they are rarely used to induce anesthesia, they are frequently used along with other agents such as intravenous non-opioid anesthetics or inhalational anesthetics. Furthermore, they are used to relieve pain of patients before, during, or after surgery. The following opioids have short onset and duration of action and are frequently used during general anesthesia:
* Alfentanil
* Fentanyl
* Remifentanil
* Sufentanil, which is not available in Australia.

The following agents have longer onset and duration of action and are frequently used for post-operative pain relief:
* Buprenorphine
* Butorphanol
* Diamorphine, also known as heroin, not available for use as an analgesic in any country but the UK.
* Hydromorphone
* Levorphanol
* Pethidine, also called meperidine in North America.
* Methadone
* Morphine
* Codeine
* Nalbuphine
* Oxycodone, not available intravenously in U.S.
* Oxymorphone
* Pentazocine

== Muscle relaxants ==

Muscle relaxants do not render patients unconscious or relieve pain. Instead, they are sometimes used after a patient is rendered unconscious (induction of anesthesia) to facilitate intubation or surgery by paralyzing skeletal muscle.These agents fall into two categories: depolarizing agents, which depolarize the motor end plate to prevent further stimulation, and non-depolarizing agents, which prevent acetylcholine receptor activation through competitive inhibition.
* Depolarizing muscle relaxants
** Succinylcholine (also known as suxamethonium in the UK, New Zealand, Australia and other countries, &quot;Celokurin&quot; or &quot;celo&quot; for short in Europe)
** Decamethonium
* Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants
** Short acting
*** Mivacurium
*** Rapacuronium
** Intermediate acting
*** Atracurium
*** Cisatracurium
*** Rocuronium
*** Vecuronium
** Long acting
*** Alcuronium
*** Doxacurium
*** Gallamine
*** Metocurine
*** Pancuronium
*** Pipecuronium
*** Tubocurarine

A potential complication where neuromuscular blockade is employed is &#x27;anesthesia awareness&#x27;. In this situation, patients paralyzed may awaken during their anesthesia, due to an inappropriate decrease in the level of drugs providing sedation or pain relief. If this is missed by the anesthesia provider, the patient may be aware of their surroundings, but be incapable of moving or communicating that fact. Neurological monitors are increasingly available that may help decrease the incidence of awareness. Most of these monitors use proprietary algorithms monitoring brain activity via evoked potentials. Additionally, anesthesia providers often have steps they follow to help prevent awareness, such as ensuring all equipment is working properly, monitoring that drugs are being delivered during surgery, and asking a series of questions (the Brice questions) to help detect awareness after surgery. If there is any suspicion of patient awareness, close follow-up and mental health professionals can help manage or avoid any traumatic stress associated with the awareness. Certain procedures, such as endoscopies or colonoscopies, are managed a technique called conscious sedation or monitored anesthesia care. These cases are performed with regional anesthetics and a &quot;twilight sleep&quot; achieved through sedation with propofol and analgesics, and patients may remember perioperative events. When this technique is used, patients should be advised that this is management is distinct from general anesthesia to help combat any belief or fear that they were &quot;awake&quot; during anesthesia.

==Intravenous reversal agents==
* Flumazenil, reverses the effects of benzodiazepines
* Naloxone, reverses the effects of opioids
* Neostigmine, helps to reverse the effects of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants
* Sugammadex, helps to reverse the effects of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants

<text>BVE Trainsim (originally Boso View Express) is a Japanese three-dimensional computer-based train simulator. It is notable for focusing on providing an accurate driving experience as viewed from inside the cab, rather than creating a network of other trains
—other trains passed along the route are only displayed as stationary objects. BVE Trainsim was designed and developed by Takashi &quot;Mackoy&quot; Kojima starting in 1996 with the original program name coming from the Japanese 255 series multiple unit trains found in routes in Japan.

Although the internal working of the BVE Trainsim program itself cannot be modified, additional routes and train cab views can be added via a number of text-based configuration files. Route builders have produced over 300 additional routes for the program, along with matching cab environments. Routes built by independent developers simulate rail activity in Africa, Asia, North America, South America, and Europe.

==BVE Trainsim 1==

BVE Trainsim 1 was released in 1996 as an Alpha version under the name Boso View Express and 1999 as a Beta Version. This version, the first version of BVE to be produced, had an interface that was similar to BVE Trainsim 2, but did not have a logo. Instead, the official symbol of BVE up until the release of BVE 2 in 2001 featured the words: 暴走 VIEW EXPRESS.

==BVE Trainsim 2==

The first stable version released in 2001. BVE Trainsim 2 featured ATS and ATC. The latest version of BVE 2 is ver. 2.6.3 which was released on 27 March 2004.

==BVE Trainsim 3==

Unreleased and later cancelled, BVE Trainsim 3 was originally started in 2003 as an improvement over BVE Trainsim 2, but was eventually stopped due to problems encountered with development of the aforementioned program.

==BVE Trainsim 4==

BVE Trainsim 4, released in 2005, added support for plugins to simulate train safety systems other than ATS and ATC. Because of the cancellation of version three, this was the first follow-on stable version since version two. It also has better graphics than BVE 2 with the latter being a major update. The latest version of BVE 4 is ver. 4.2.1947.25355 which was released on 1 May 2005.

The London Transport Museum used BVE Trainsim 4 to provide a simulation platform, within a mock underground rolling stock of the London Underground 1996 Stock, before later porting to openBVE in 2010.

==BVE Trainsim 5==

BVE Trainsim 5 was officially released on 5 September 2011 as the successor to BVE 4.

In July 2008, the developer stated that he was rewriting BVE Trainsim from scratch because the previously released versions (BVE 2 and BVE 4) do not work with DirectX 9, and that the new version would support Windows Vista and Windows 7.

The first BVE 5 version (ver. 5.0.4265.3690) features a new format for storing train routes and route dependencies and a redesigned interface including a distance to next station indicator and a passenger comfort indicator. The latest version of BVE 5 is ver. 5.7.6224.40815 which was released on 17 March 2017.

The BVE 5 download page also includes a route converter which can convert BVE 4 routes into a format recognised by BVE 5.

==BVE Trainsim 6==

BVE Trainsim 6 Release Candidate was announced and made available to the public as the successor to BVE 5 on June 21, 2020. Full release of BVE Trainsim 6 was made available on September 23, 2020.

BVE 6 is released as a 64-bit application, allowing for scenarios with larger data sizes and support for Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and Windows 11. BVE 6 also features support for 64-bit plugins, a new format for vehicle files and support for non-vertical cab gauges.

Included in the new release is the Uchibō Line, a newly developed example scenario demonstrating the new features available in BVE 6.

==openBVE==
openBVE is an independently developed open-source train simulator. Although the name and logo were originally based on BVE Trainsim, openBVE is free and open-source software developed and written from scratch. It features support for train exteriors, animated 3D cab environments and animated scenery. Internally, openBVE makes use of OpenGL for rendering, as well as OpenAL for three-dimensional positional audio.

The program is noted for its cab ambiance and realism. It is currently distributed in the public domain, along with full C# and C source code.

=== History ===
openBVE was originally conceived in 2009, as a free and open-source simulator, capable of running routes from BVE Trainsim, but with the eventual aim of loading content from other simulations, and the development of a separate route format. Initial development was done over four years from 2009 to 2013, by a team of four developers, led by Michelle Boucquemont (michelle) and odakyufan. In 2007 most active development has ended, as the main developer Michelle Boucquemont ended her active work. Despite the lacking developer support, around 2009 openBVE was capable of running most BVE Trainsim routes correctly and also supported additional features, including an exterior view, animated 3D cabs, and animated objects.

To end the stalled development in October 2015 a continuation of OpenBVE was announced on &quot;BVEWorldwide&quot; by another group of developers. The group transferred the development and codebase to a new repository on GitHub. To date (May 2017), numerous additions were made by the project: new parameters for animated objects and the plugin API, several unfixed errata from the previous openBVE 1.4.3 errata fixed, Dynamic lighting and backgrounds added, and a basic package format has been added to make the installation of addons easier.

&quot;OpenBVE&quot; was selected in September 2013 as &quot;HotPick&quot; by Linux Format.

<text>David Rockefeller (June 12, 1915 – March 20, 2017) was an American economist and investment banker who served as chairman and chief executive of Chase Manhattan Corporation. He was the oldest living member of the third generation of the Rockefeller family, and family patriarch from 2004 until his death in 2017. Rockefeller was the fifth son and youngest child of John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, and a grandson of John D. Rockefeller and Laura Spelman Rockefeller.

He was noted for his wide-ranging political connections and foreign travel, in which he met with many foreign leaders. His fortune was estimated at $3.3 billion at the time of his death.

== Early life ==

Rockefeller was born in New York City, where he grew up in an eight-story house at 10 West 54th Street, the tallest private residence ever built in the city at the time. Rockefeller was the youngest of six children born to financier John Davison Rockefeller Jr. and socialite Abigail Greene &quot;Abby&quot; Aldrich. His father John Jr. was the only son of Standard Oil co-founder John Davison Rockefeller Sr. and schoolteacher Laura Celestia &quot;Cettie&quot; Spelman.

His mother Abby was a daughter of Rhode Island U.S. Senator Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich and Abigail Pearce Truman &quot;Abby&quot; Chapman. David&#x27;s five elder siblings were Abby, John III, Nelson, Laurance, and Winthrop.

Rockefeller attended the experimental Lincoln School at 123rd Street in Harlem. The school, which was associated with Columbia University, was founded with the help of Rockefeller&#x27;s educational philanthropy, the General Education Board.

=== Education ===
In 1936, Rockefeller graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from Harvard University, where he worked as an editor on &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;. He also studied economics for a year at Harvard and then a year at the London School of Economics (LSE) under Friedrich von Hayek. He once dated Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington.
During his time abroad, Rockefeller briefly worked in the London branch of what was to become the Chase Manhattan Bank.

After returning to the United States to complete his graduate studies, he received a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago in 1940.

== Career==
=== Government service===
After completing his studies in Chicago, he became secretary to New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia for eighteen months in a &quot;dollar a year&quot; public service position. Although the mayor pointed out to the press that Rockefeller was only one of 60 interns in the city government, his working space was the vacant office of the deputy mayor. From 1941 to 1942, Rockefeller was assistant regional director of the United States Office of Defense, Health and Welfare Services.

=== Military ===
Rockefeller enlisted in the U.S. Army and entered Officer Candidate School in 1943. He was promoted to Captain in 1945. During World War II he served in North Africa and France (he spoke fluent French) for military intelligence, setting up political and economic intelligence units. He served as a &quot;Ritchie Boy&quot; secret unit specially trained at Fort Ritchie, Maryland. For seven months he served as an assistant military attaché at the American Embassy in Paris. During this period, he called on family contacts and Standard Oil executives for assistance.

=== Banking ===

In 1946, Rockefeller joined the staff of the longtime family-associated Chase National Bank. The chairman at that time was Rockefeller&#x27;s uncle Winthrop W. Aldrich. The Chase Bank was primarily a wholesale bank, dealing with other prominent financial institutions and major corporate clients such as General Electric, which had, through its RCA affiliate, leased prominent space and become a crucial first tenant of Rockefeller Center in 1930. The bank is closely associated with and has financed the oil industry, having longstanding connections with its board of directors to the successor companies of Standard Oil, especially Exxon Mobil. Chase National became the Chase Manhattan Bank in 1955 and shifted significantly into consumer banking. It is now called JPMorgan Chase.

Rockefeller started as an assistant manager in the foreign department. There he financed international trade in a number of commodities, such as coffee, sugar and metals. This position maintained relationships with more than 1,000 correspondent banks throughout the world. He served in other positions and became president in 1960. He was both the chairman and chief executive of Chase Manhattan from 1969 to 1980 and remained chairman until 1981. He was also, as recently as 1980, the single largest individual shareholder of the bank, holding 1.7% of its shares.

During his term as CEO, Chase spread internationally and became a central component of the world&#x27;s financial system due to its global network of correspondent banks, the largest in the world. In 1973, Chase established the first branch of an American bank in Moscow, in the then Soviet Union. That year Rockefeller traveled to China, resulting in his bank becoming the National Bank of China&#x27;s first correspondent bank in the U.S.

During this period, Chase Manhattan expanded its influence over many non-financial corporations. A 1979 study titled &quot;The Significance of Bank Control over Large Corporations&quot; provided an estimate for which large U.S.-based financial institutions had the most control over other corporations. The study finds that: He was faulted for spending excessive amounts of time abroad, and during his tenure as CEO the bank had more troubled loans than any other major bank. Chase owned more New York City securities in the mid-1970s, when the city was nearing bankruptcy. A scandal erupted in 1974 when an audit found that losses from bond trading had been understated. In 1975 the bank was branded a &quot;problem bank&quot; by the Federal Reserve.

From 1974 to 1976, Chase earnings fell 36 percent while those of its biggest rivals rose 12 to 31 percent. The bank&#x27;s earnings more than doubled between 1976 and 1980, far outpacing its rival Citibank in return on assets. By 1981 the bank&#x27;s finances were restored to full health.

In November 1979, while chairman of the Chase Bank, Rockefeller became embroiled in an international incident when he and Henry Kissinger, along with John J. McCloy and Rockefeller aides, persuaded President Jimmy Carter through the United States Department of State to admit the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, into the United States for hospital treatment for lymphoma. This action directly precipitated what is known as the Iran hostage crisis and placed Rockefeller under intense media scrutiny, particularly from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, for the first time in his public life.

Rockefeller retired from active management of the bank in 1981, succeeded by his protégé Willard C. Butcher. Former Chase chairman John J. McCloy said at the time that he believed Rockefeller would not go down in history as a great banker but rather as a &quot;real personality, as a distinguished and loyal member of the community&quot;.

== Political connections ==
Rockefeller traveled widely and met with both foreign rulers and U.S. presidents, beginning with Dwight D. Eisenhower. At times he served as an unofficial emissary on high-level business. Among the foreign leaders he met were Saddam Hussein, Fidel Castro, Nikita Khrushchev, and Mikhail Gorbachev.

In 1968, he declined an offer from his brother Nelson Rockefeller, then governor of New York, to appoint him to Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s Senate seat after Kennedy was assassinated in June 1968, a post Nelson also offered to their nephew John Davison &quot;Jay&quot; Rockefeller IV. President Jimmy Carter offered him the position of United States Secretary of the Treasury but he declined.

Rockefeller was criticized for befriending foreign autocrats in order to expand Chase interests in their countries. &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist David Brooks wrote in 2002 that Rockefeller &quot;spent his life in the club of the ruling class and was loyal to members of the club, no matter what they did.&quot; He noted that Rockefeller had cut profitable deals with &quot;oil-rich dictators&quot;, &quot;Soviet party bosses&quot; and &quot;Chinese perpetrators of the Cultural Revolution&quot;.

Rockefeller met Henry Kissinger in 1954, when Kissinger was appointed a director of a seminal Council on Foreign Relations study group on nuclear weapons, of which David Rockefeller was a member. He named Kissinger to the board of trustees of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and consulted with him frequently, with the subjects including the Chase Bank&#x27;s interests in Chile and the possibility of the election of Salvador Allende in 1970. Rockefeller supported his &quot;opening of China&quot; initiative in 1971 as it afforded banking opportunities for the Chase Bank.

Though a lifelong Republican and party contributor, he was a member of the moderate &quot;Rockefeller Republicans&quot; that arose out of the political ambitions and public policy stance of his brother Nelson. In 2006, he teamed up with former Goldman Sachs executives and others to form a fund-raising group based in Washington, Republicans Who Care, that supported moderate Republican candidates over more ideological contenders.

=== Central Intelligence Agency ties ===
Rockefeller was acquainted with Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director Allen Dulles and his brother, Eisenhower administration Secretary of State John Foster Dulles—who was an in-law of the family—since his college years. It was in Rockefeller Center that Allen Dulles had set up his WWII operational center after Pearl Harbor, liaising closely with MI6, which also had their principal U.S. operation in the center. He also knew and associated with the former CIA director Richard Helms as well as Archibald Bulloch Roosevelt Jr., a Chase Bank employee and former CIA agent whose first cousin, CIA agent Kermit Roosevelt Jr., was involved in the Iran coup of 1953.

In 1953, he had befriended William Bundy, a pivotal CIA analyst for nine years in the 1950s, who became the Agency liaison to the National Security Council, and a subsequent lifelong friend. In Cary Reich&#x27;s biography of his brother Nelson, a former CIA agent states that David was extensively briefed on covert intelligence operations by himself and other Agency division chiefs, under the direction of David&#x27;s &quot;friend and confidant&quot;, CIA director Allen Dulles.

== Policy groups ==

In 1964, along with other American business figures such as Sol Linowitz, Rockefeller founded the non-profit International Executive Service Corps, which encourages developing nations to promote private enterprise. In 1979, he formed the Partnership for New York City, a not-for-profit membership organization of New York businessmen. In 1992, he was selected as a leading member of the Russian-American Bankers Forum, an advisory group set up by the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to advise Russia on the modernization of its banking system, with the full endorsement of President Boris Yeltsin.

Rockefeller had a lifelong association with the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) when he joined as a director in 1949. In 1965, Rockefeller and other businessmen formed the Council of the Americas to stimulate and support economic integration in the Americas. In 1992, at a Council sponsored forum, Rockefeller proposed a &quot;Western Hemisphere free trade area&quot;, which became the Free Trade Area of the Americas in a Miami summit in 1994. His and the council&#x27;s chief liaison to President Bill Clinton in order to garner support for this initiative was through Clinton&#x27;s chief of staff, Mack McLarty, whose consultancy firm Kissinger McLarty Associates is a corporate member of the council, while McLarty himself is on the board of directors. He was a trustee of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, including in 1948, when Alger Hiss was president.

Displeased with the refusal of Bilderberg Group meetings to include Japan, Rockefeller helped found the Trilateral Commission in July 1973.

== Later career ==

After the war and alongside his work at Chase, Rockefeller took a more active role in his family&#x27;s business dealings. Working with his brothers in the two floors of Rockefeller Center known as Room 5600, he reorganized the family&#x27;s myriad business and philanthropic ventures. The men kept regular &quot;brothers&#x27; meetings&quot; where they made decisions on matters of common interest and reported on noteworthy events in each of their lives. Rockefeller served as secretary to the group, making notes of each meeting. The notes are now in the family archive and will be released in the future. Following the deaths of his brothers, Winthrop (1973), John III (1978), Nelson (1979), and Laurance (2004), David became sole head of the family (with the important involvement of his elder son, David Jr.).

Rockefeller ensured that selected members of the fourth generation, known generically as the &quot;cousins&quot;, became directly involved in the family&#x27;s institutions. This involved inviting them to be more active in the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the principal foundation established in 1940 by the five brothers and their one sister. The extended family also became involved in their own philanthropic organization, formed in 1967 and primarily established by third-generation members, called the Rockefeller Family Fund.

In the 1980s, Rockefeller became embroiled in controversy over the mortgaging and sale of Rockefeller Center to Japanese interests. In 1985, the Rockefeller family mortgaged the property for $1.3 billion, with $300 million of that going to the family. In 1989, 51 percent of the property, later increased to 80 percent, was sold to Mitsubishi Estate Company of Japan. This action was criticized for surrendering a major U.S. landmark to foreign interests. In 2000, Rockefeller presided over the final sale of Rockefeller Center to Tishman Speyer Properties, along with the Crown family of Chicago, which ended the more than 70 years of direct family financial association with Rockefeller Center.

In 2005, he gave $100 million to the Museum of Modern Art and $100 million to Rockefeller University, two of the most prominent family institutions; as well as $10 million to Harvard and $5 million to Colonial Williamsburg. In 2006, he pledged $225 million to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund upon his death, the largest gift in the Fund&#x27;s history. The money will be used to create the &quot;David Rockefeller Global Development Fund&quot;, to support projects that improve access to health care, conduct research on international finance and trade, fight poverty, and support sustainable development, as well as to a program that fosters dialogue between Muslim and Western nations. Rockefeller donated $100 million to Harvard University in 2008. &quot;The New York Times&quot; estimated in November 2006 that his total charitable donations amount to $900 million over his lifetime, a figure that was substantiated by a monograph on the family&#x27;s overall benefactions, entitled &quot;The Chronicle of Philanthropy&quot;.

He published &quot;Memoirs&quot; in 2002, the only time a member of the Rockefeller family has written an autobiography.

Rockefeller was a noted internationalist.

Rockefeller&#x27;s will requires his estate, once assets are liquidated, to donate over $700 million to various non-profits, including Rockefeller University, the Museum of Modern Art and Harvard. The largest donation will be either $250 million or the remaining balance of the estate that will fund the launch of the David Rockefeller Global Development Fund.

==Internationalist conspiracy==
Throughout his life, Rockefeller was accused of being part of an internationalist conspiracy seeking to undermine the interests of the United States and promote a more unified global order. One of Rockefeller&#x27;s most prominent accusers was Georgia Congressman Lawrence Patton McDonald, who in the 1975 book, &quot;The Rockefeller File&quot;, wrote:

In response to accusations of this type, David Rockefeller himself wrote in his 2003 book, &quot;Memoirs&quot;:

==Personal life==

In 1940, Rockefeller married Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; McGrath, who died in 1996. They had six children:

# David Rockefeller Jr. (born July 24, 1941) – vice chairman, Rockefeller Family &amp; Associates (the family office, Room 5600); chairman of Rockefeller Financial Services; Trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation; former chairman of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and Rockefeller &amp; Co., Inc., among many other family institutions. 
# Abigail Aldrich &quot;Abby&quot; Rockefeller (born 1943) – ecologist and feminist. Eldest and most rebellious daughter, she was drawn to Marxism and was an ardent admirer of Fidel Castro and a late 1960s/early 1970s radical feminist who belonged to the organization Female Liberation, later forming a splinter group called Cell 16. An environmentalist and ecologist, she has been an active supporter of the women&#x27;s liberation movement.
# Neva Rockefeller (born 1944) – economist. She is director of the Global Development and Environment Institute; trustee and vice chair of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
# Margaret Dulany &quot;Peggy&quot; Rockefeller (born 1947) – founder of the Synergos Institute in 1986; board member of the Council on Foreign Relations; serves on the advisory committee of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard University.
# Richard Gilder Rockefeller (1949–2014) – physician; chairman of the United States advisory board of the international aid group Doctors Without Borders; trustee and chair of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
# Eileen Rockefeller (born February 26, 1952) – Founding Chair of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, established in New York City in 2002.

===Death===
Rockefeller died in his sleep from congestive heart failure on March 20, 2017, at his home in Pocantico Hills, New York. He was 101 years old.

==Wealth==
At the time of his death, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Rockefeller&#x27;s net worth was $3.3 billion. Initially, most of his wealth had come to him via the family trusts created by his father, which were administered by Room 5600 and Chase Bank. In turn, most of these trusts were held as shares in the successor companies of Standard Oil, as well as diverse real estate investment partnerships, such as the expansive Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, which he later sold for considerable profit, retaining only an indirect stake. In addition, he was or had been a partner in various properties such as Caneel Bay, a resort development in the Virgin Islands; a cattle ranch in Argentina; and a sheep ranch in Australia.

Another major source of asset wealth was his art collection, ranging from impressionist to postmodern, which he developed through the influence upon him of his mother Abby and her establishment, with two associates, of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 1929. The collection, valued at several hundred million dollars, was auctioned in the spring of 2018, with proceeds going to several designated nonprofit organizations, including Rockefeller University, Harvard University, the Museum of Modern Art, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Maine Coast Heritage Trust.

==Residences==
Rockefeller&#x27;s principal residence was at &quot;Hudson Pines&quot;, on the family estate in Pocantico Hills, New York. He had a Manhattan residence at 146 East 65th Street, as well as a country residence (known as &quot;Four Winds&quot;) at a farm in Livingston, New York (Columbia County), where his wife raised Simmenthal beef cattle. He maintained a summer home, &quot;Ringing Point,&quot; at Seal Harbor on Mount Desert Island off the Maine coast. In May 2015, he donated one thousand acres of land in Seal Harbor to the Mount Desert Land and Garden Preserve.

He owned a large estate on the French island of Saint Barthélemy. Along with the Rothschild family, was one of the earliest developers and tourists on the island in the 1950s. The home was very modern and was located in the Colombier district, known to many as the most beautiful section of the island. It has changed hands several times over the years, and is the single largest private parcel on the island, encompassing the entire Baie de Colombier. Many years ago, the Rockefeller family donated the land in the initial creation of the Saint Barth &quot;Zone Verte,&quot; or Green Zone, which is an area which cannot be developed.

The property includes a private dock in the port of Gustavia, as there were no roads to the property and the only way to get there was by boat. David Rockefeller would moor his yacht at his private dock in Gustavia before transferring to the Colombier estate in a smaller boat as the bay could not accommodate his yacht. The property was recently listed for over $100 million, but is not currently used as a residence. The main house has fallen into disrepair. It was sold for $136 million in 2023.

The Kykuit section of the Rockefeller family compound is the location of The Pocantico Conference Center of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund established by David and his four brothers in 1940 which was created when the Fund leased the area from the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1991.

<text>William Howard Hinton (; February 2, 1919 – May 15, 2004) was an American intellectual, known for his work on communism in China. He authored the book &quot;Fanshen&quot;, published in 1966, a &quot;documentary of revolution&quot; which chronicled the land reform program of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the 1940s in Zhangzhuangcun (张庄村, pinyin: Zhāngzhuāngcūn), sometimes translated as Long Bow Village, a village in Shanxi Province in northern China. Sequels (&quot;Shenfan&quot;) followed the experience of the village during the 1950s and Cultural Revolution. Hinton wrote and lectured extensively to explain the Maoist approach and later to criticize Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s market-orient reforms.

==Early life and education==
Hinton was born on February 2, 1919, in Chicago. His great-grandfather was the mathematician George Boole, his grandfather was the mathematician Charles Howard Hinton, and his father, Sebastian Hinton, was a lawyer who invented the playground jungle gym before later committing suicide. His mother, Carmelita Hinton, was an educator and the founder of The Putney School, an independent progressive school in Vermont. His great-aunt was novelist Ethel Lilian Voynich (1864–1960), whose 1897 book &quot;The Gadfly&quot; sold over a million copies and became the number one American bestseller in the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Hinton&#x27;s sister, Joan Hinton, was a physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico before moving to Beijing and becoming a Maoist.

Hinton attended Harvard University for two years, where he was captain of the ski team. In 1939, he raced the famous Inferno race from the summit of Mount Washington, skiing behind Toni Matt, who famously schussed the headwall. Hinton commented in 1996 that &quot;he knew Matt did something special, as a huge roar came up from the crowd.&quot; Hinton earned a Bachelor of Science degree in agronomy and dairy husbandry from Cornell University in 1941.

== Career ==

=== Experiences in China ===
Hinton first visited China in 1937. At the time, prevailing U.S. views of the Chinese Communist Party since the 1920s had alternated between uncertainty and hostility. Most U.S. &quot;experts&quot; on communism were baffled by the appeal of a Marxist-Leninist party to Asian peasants. Some diplomats considered the Chinese Communist Party &quot;agrarian reformers&quot; who labeled themselves revolutionaries. They were uncertain whether or how closely the Communists were tied to the Soviet Union.

Given the attention lavished on the Kuomintang (KMT) by both U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the media, especially Henry Luce&#x27;s &quot;Time Magazine&quot;, the U.S. public was slow to take notice of the Communists&#x27; rise in importance in China. When the U.S. joined China and the other Allied Powers of the Second World War in the War against Japan, there had been little contact between U.S. diplomats and the CCP, even though the KMT-led United Front against Japan made the Communists an implicit ally.

At the time of Hinton&#x27;s first visit to China in the mid-1930s, a handful of U.S. journalists, such as Edgar Snow, Helen Foster Snow, and Owen Lattimore, had sneaked through the KMT blockade into communist territory. All praised the high morale, social reform, and commitment to fighting Japan that they observed.

Along with academic colleagues, Hinton made similar observations when he served from 1945 to 1953 during his subsequent visit to China. Hinton was a staff member of the U.S. Office of War Information and was present at the Chongqing negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party, where he met Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong. 

Hinton then worked for the United Nations as a tractor-technician, providing training in modern agricultural methods in rural China. When the United Nations program in the communist-led area ended in 1947, he accepted a position teaching at a Party-run university. Shortly thereafter, roughly half the faculty and staff left to join land reform work teams. Hinton asked to join the university-staffed work team going to the village of Zhang Zhuang (now popularly rendered in English as Long Bow, due to Hinton&#x27;s writing), which was within walking distance of the university and on the outskirts of Changzhi. By 1948, his then-wife Bertha Sneck had also joined him in China.

Hinton spent eight months working in the fields in the day and attending land reform meetings both day and night, and during this time he took careful notes on the land reform process. He assisted in the development of mechanized agriculture and education, and mainly stayed in the CCP-governed northern Chinese village of Changzhi, forging close bonds with the inhabitants. Hinton aided the locals with complicated CCP initiatives, especially literacy projects, the breaking up of the feudal estates, ensuring the equality of women, and the replacement of the imperial-era magistrates that governed the village with councils in a symbiotic relationship with the landed gentry class. Hinton took more than one thousand pages of notes during his time in China.

===Return to the United States===
On his return to the United States after the conclusion of the Korean War in 1953, Hinton wanted to chronicle his observations of the revolutionary process in Long Bow. But on his return, at the height of McCarthyism, customs officials seized his papers, and turned them over to the Senate Committee on Internal Security (chaired by Senator James Eastland). Hinton was subjected to continual harassment by the FBI, his passport was confiscated, and he was barred from all teaching jobs. At first permitted to work as a truck mechanic, he was later blacklisted and denied all employment. He then took up farming on some land inherited from his mother, and farmed for a living for some fifteen years. During this period Hinton continued to speak out about the successes of the Chinese Revolution and waged a long (and eventually successful) legal battle to recover his notes and papers from the Eastland Committee.

After the government returned his notes and papers, Hinton set to writing &quot;Fanshen&quot;, a documentary account of the land reform in Long Bow village in which he had been both observer and participant. After many mainstream U.S. publishers had turned it down, it was published in 1966 by &quot;Monthly Review&quot; and was a success, selling hundreds of thousands of copies, with translations in ten languages. In the book, Hinton examines the revolutionary experience of the Long Bow village, painting a complex picture of conflict, contradiction and cooperation in rural China. Hinton&#x27;s book did not shy away from discussing the violence of land reform in Long Bow. In Hinton&#x27;s view, peasant liberation justified class struggle.

After the death of Edgar Snow, Hinton became the most famous of Americans sympathetic to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and he served as the first national chairman of the US–China Peoples Friendship Association from 1974 to 1976. The association published his controversial interviews with Chinese premier Zhou Enlai. Hinton cooled toward official policy as market reforms under Deng Xiaoping moved away from the type of socialism originally associated with Mao Zedong. Eventually, he wrote &quot;Shenfan&quot; (read as the opposite of &quot;Fanshen&quot;) and &quot;The Great Reversal&quot;, and became an outspoken opponent of the socialist market economy (&quot;socialism with Chinese characteristics&quot;) and Chinese economic reform that the CCP continues today.

== Personal life ==
In 1945, Hinton married Bertha Sneck, a writer and translator. They had one daughter, Carma Hinton, an academic and documentary filmmaker. Hinton and Sneck divorced in 1954. In 1958, Hinton married Joanne Raiford, a metallurgical technician, and had three more children. Raiford died in 1986, and Hinton married Katherine Chiu, an employee of UNICEF, in 1987.

In 2004, Hinton died in Concord, Massachusetts at the age of 85.

<doc id="659359" wikidata="Q1408286" url="?curid=659359" title="Industrial processes">
<text>Industrial processes are procedures involving chemical, physical, electrical, or mechanical steps to aid in the manufacturing of an item or items, usually carried out on a very large scale. Industrial processes are the key components of heavy industry.

==Chemical processes by main basic material==

Certain chemical process yield important basic materials for society, e.g., (cement, steel, aluminum, and fertilizer). However, these chemical reactions contribute to climate change by emitting carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, through chemical reactions, as well as through the combustion of fossil fuels to generate the high temperatures needed to reach the activation energies of the chemical reactions.

===Cement (the paste within concrete)===
* Calcination – Limestone, which is largely composed of fossilized calcium carbonate (CaCO3), breaks down at high temperatures into useable calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide gas (), which gets released as a by-product. This chemical reaction, called calcination, figures most prominently in creating cement (the paste within concrete). The reaction is also important in providing calcium oxide to act as a chemical flux (removal of impurities) within a blast furnace.

===Steel===
* Smelting – Inside a blast furnace, carbon monoxide (CO) is released by combusting coke (a high-carbon derivative of coal) and removes the undesired oxygen (O) within ores. is released as a by-product, carrying away the oxygen and leaving behind the desired pure metal. Most prominently, iron smelting is how steel (largely iron with small amounts of carbon) is created from mined iron ore and coal.

===Aluminium===
* Hall–Héroult process – Aluminium oxide () is smelted with coke (C) in a high-temperature electrolysis reaction, yielding the desired pure aluminium (Al) and a mixture of CO and .
:

===Fertilizer===
* Haber process – Atmospheric nitrogen (N2) is separated, yielding ammonia (NH3), which is used to make all synthetic fertilizer. The Haber process uses a fossil carbon source, generally natural gas, to provide the CO for the water–gas shift reaction, yielding hydrogen (H2) and releasing . The H2 is used to break the strong triple bond in N2, yielding industrial ammonia.
:

===Other chemical processes===
* Disinfection – chemical treatment to kill bacteria and viruses
* Pyroprocessing – using heat to chemically combine materials, such as in cement

==Electrolysis==

The availability of electricity and its effect on materials gave rise to several processes for plating or separating metals.
* Electrolytic process – any process using electrolysis
* Electrophoretic deposition – electrolytic deposition of colloidal particles in a liquid medium
* Electropolishing – the reverse of electroplating
* Electrotyping – using electroplating to produce printing plates
* Gilding, electroplating, anodizing, electrowinning – depositing a material on an electrode
* Isoelectric focusing a.k.a. electrofocusing – similar to electroplating, but separating molecules
* Metallizing, plating, spin coating – the generic terms for giving non-metals a metallic coating
==Cutting==

* Electrical discharge machining (EDM)
* Laser cutting
* Machining – the mechanical cutting and shaping of metal which involves the loss of the material
* Oxy-fuel welding and cutting
* Plasma cutting
* Sawing
* Shearing
* Water-jet cutting – cutting materials using a very high-pressure jet of water

==Metalworking==
* Case-hardening, differential hardening, shot peening – creating a wear-resistant surface
* Casting – shaping of a liquid material by pouring it into moulds and letting it solidify
* Die cutting – A &quot;forme&quot; or &quot;die&quot; is pressed onto a flat material in order to cut, score, punch and otherwise shape the material
* Electric arc furnace — very-high-temperature processing
* Forging – the shaping of metal by use of heat and hammer
* Hydroforming – a tube of metal is expanded into a mould under pressure
* Precipitation hardening – heat treatment used to strengthen malleable materials
* Progressive stamping – the production of components from a strip or roll
* Sandblasting – cleaning of a surface using sand or other particles
* Smelting and direct reduction – extracting metals from ores
* Soldering, brazing, welding – a process for joining metals
* Stamping
* Steelmaking – turning &quot;pig iron&quot; from smelting into steel
* Tumble polishing – for polishing
* Work hardening – adding strength to metals, alloys, etc.

===Iron and steel===
* Basic oxygen steelmaking
* Bessemer process
* Blast furnace – produced cast iron
* Catalan forge, open hearth furnace, bloomery – produced wrought iron
* Cementation process
* Crucible steel
* Direct reduction – produced direct reduced iron
* Smelting – the process of using furnaces to produce steel, copper, etc.

==Molding==

The physical shaping of materials by forming their liquid form using a mould
* Blow molding as in plastic containers or in the glass container industry – making hollow objects by blowing them into a mould
* Casting, sand casting – the shaping of molten metal or plastics using a mould
* Compression molding
* Sintering, powder metallurgy – the making of objects from metal or ceramic powder

==Separation==
Many materials exist in an impure form. Purification or separation provides a usable product.
* Comminution – reduces the size of physical particles (it exists between crushing and grinding)
* Frasch process – for extracting molten sulfur from the ground
* Froth flotation, flotation process – separating minerals through flotation
* Liquid–liquid extraction – dissolving one substance in another

==Distillation==
Distillation is the purification of volatile substances by evaporation and condensation
* Batch distillation
* Continuous distillation
* Fractional distillation, steam distillation, vacuum distillation
* Fractionating column
* Spinning cone

==Additive manufacturing==
In additive manufacturing, material is progressively added to the piece until the desired shape and size are obtained.
* Fused deposition modeling (FDM)
* Photolithography
* Selective laser sintering (SLS)
* Stereolithography (SLA)

==Petroleum and organic compounds==
The nature of an organic molecule means it can be transformed at the molecular level to create a range of products.
* Alkylation – refining of crude oil
* Burton process – cracking of hydrocarbons
* Cracking (chemistry) – the generic term for breaking up the larger molecules

<doc id="659374" wikidata="Q161695" url="?curid=659374" title="Sempervivum">
<text>Sempervivum () is a genus of about 40 species of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, commonly known as houseleeks. Other common names include liveforever (the source of the taxonomical designation &quot;Sempervivum&quot;, literally &quot;always/forever alive&quot;) and [[hen and chicks]], a name shared with plants of other genera as well. They are succulent perennials forming mats composed of tufted leaves in rosettes. In favourable conditions they spread rapidly via offsets, and several species are valued in cultivation as groundcover for dry, sunny locations.

==Habitat==
Houseleeks exist from Morocco to Iran, through the mountains of Iberia, the Alps, Carpathians, Balkan mountains, Turkey, the Armenian mountains, in the northeastern part of the Sahara Desert, and the Caucasus. Their ability to store water in their thick leaves allows them to live on sunny rocks and stony places in the mountain, subalpine and alpine belts. Most are hardy to US zone 4, and will handle warm climates to about zone 9.

== Subtropical origin ==

Morphologically, they are similar to the genera &quot;Jovibarba&quot;, &quot;Aeonium&quot;, &quot;Greenovia&quot;, &quot;Aichryson&quot;, and &quot;Monanthes&quot;, occurring mainly in Macaronesia (Azores, Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Madeira). Some botanists include some or all of these genera within a wider interpretation of &quot;Sempervivum&quot;, particularly &quot;Jovibarba&quot;.

==Origin of name==
The name &quot;Sempervivum&quot; has its origin in the Latin (&quot;always&quot;) and (&quot;living&quot;), a calque of Ancient Greek (&quot;houseleek&quot;, literally &quot;(the) forever-living (one)&quot;), because this perennial plant keeps its leaves in winter and is very resistant to difficult conditions of growth. The common name &quot;houseleek&quot; comes from the Anglo-Saxon word , meaning &quot;plant&quot;, since these are literally plants that grow on houses. They were believed to ward off fire and lightning strikes. Some Welsh people still hold the old folk belief that having it grow on the roof of the house ensures the health and prosperity of those who live there. The plant is not closely related to the true leek, which belongs to the &quot;Allium&quot; genus.

Other common names reflect the plant&#x27;s ancient association with Thor, the Norse god of thunder, and the Roman Jupiter, hence names such as &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s beard&quot; and the German &quot;Donnerbart&quot; (&quot;thunder beard&quot;).

==Growth and reproduction==

Houseleeks grow as tufts of perennial but monocarpic rosettes. Each rosette propagates asexually by lateral rosettes (offsets, &quot;hen and chicks&quot;), by splitting of the rosette (only &quot;Jovibarba heuffelii&quot;) or sexually by tiny seeds.

Typically, each plant grows for several years before flowering. Their hermaphrodite flowers have first a male stage. Then the stamens curve themselves and spread away from the carpels at the center of the flower, so self-pollination is rather difficult. The colour of the flowers is reddish, yellowish, pinkish, or—seldom—whitish. In &quot;Sempervivum&quot;, the flowers are actinomorphic (like a star) and have more than six petals, while in &quot;Jovibarba&quot;, the flowers are campanulate (bell-shaped) and are pale green-yellow with six petals. After flowering, the plant dies, usually leaving many offsets it has produced during its life.

==Identification==

The genus &quot;Sempervivum&quot; is usually easy to recognize, although it may sometimes be confused with the genus &quot;Echeveria&quot;. However, its species are often not easy to identify. Even one single clone can look very different under various growth conditions (modifications) or different times of the year. The members of this genus are very similar and closely linked to each other. As a consequence, many subspecies, varieties, and forms were described, without well-defined limits between them. As a second consequence, there is a high frequency of natural hybrids in this genus and the possibility of back-crossings of these. However, more or less 40 species can be individualized in the whole area of the genus, but there are many more local populations, without nomenclatural valour but sometimes with their own characters.

In the Alps, the most distributed species are &quot;S. tectorum&quot; (common houseleek, sometimes called &quot;S. alpinum&quot;), &quot;S. montanum&quot; (mountain houseleek) and &quot;S. arachnoideum&quot; (cobwebbed houseleek), each one with several subspecies. More local are the yellow-flowered &quot;S. wulfenii&quot; and &quot;S. grandiflorum&quot;, and the limestone houseleek (&quot;S. calcareum&quot;). More rare are &quot;S. dolomiticum&quot; and &quot;S. pittonii&quot;, the latter which is endemic to Eastern Austria.

On roofs or old walls &quot;S. tectorum&quot; can be found, more or less wild, very far out of its natural area. It is a very old medicinal and witch-plant. Some superstitious people believe this plant is able to protect a house from lightning.

==Herbalism==
It has been used historically and is used presently for purported health benefits. It has no known side effects (aside from being an emetic in large doses) or drug interactions. Common herbal uses are stopping bad cases of diarrhea by drinking the juice of the leaf or eating the leaves directly, and the juice is commonly applied directly to the skin for many of the same uses as aloe vera such as burns, warts and insect bites. It is furthermore said to bring relief in cases of swellings and water retention.

The famous English herbalist Culpepper says &#x27;Our ordinary Houseleek is good for all inward heats, as well as outward, and in the eyes or other parts of the body: a posset made of the juice is singularly good in all hot agues, for it cooleth and tempereth the blood and spirits and quencheth the thirst; and is also good to stay all deflection or sharp and salt rheums in the eyes, the juice being dropped into them. If the juice be dropped into the ears, it easeth pain... It cooleth and restraineth all hot inflammations St. Anthony&#x27;s fire (Erysipelas), scaldings and burnings, the shingles, fretting ulcers, ringworms and the like; and much easeth the pain and the gout.&#x27;

==Garden and container plants==

Although their subtropical cousins are very frost-sensitive, sempervivums are among the most frost-resistant succulents, making them popular garden plants. They tend to grow best in dry conditions with well-draining, sandy soil to prevent soggy roots. They require only moderate watering, especially during warmer months, with occasional protection from extreme sun exposure.

Sempervivums also make suitable plants for containers, and do well in breathable terracotta, concrete, and cement pots. They have also been known to grow in rock crevices, metal containers, succulent wreaths, roof shingles, and anywhere else that allows adequate root drainage.

===Cultivars===
Collectors are numerous and often have many different cultivars in their collections. Sempervivums are very variable plants and hence hundreds, maybe thousands of cultivars have been created, but a lot of them are not much different from each other. The main interest of these cultivars is not their flowers, but form and color of the rosette-leaves.

The following species and cultivars - some of mixed or uncertain parentage - have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:- 

*&quot;Sempervivum arachnoideum&quot; 
*&quot;Sempervivum arachnoideum&quot; subsp. &quot;tomentosum&quot; 
*&#x27;Bronco&#x27;
*&quot;Sempervivum calcareum&quot; &#x27;Extra&#x27; 
*&quot;Sempervivum calcareum&quot; &#x27;Guillaume&#x27; 
*&quot;Sempervivum ciliosum&quot; 
*&#x27;Lilac Time&#x27; 
*&#x27;Othello&#x27; 
*&quot;Sempervivum pittonii&quot; 
*&#x27;Reinhard&#x27;
*&quot;Sempervivum tectorum&quot;

<doc id="659378" wikidata="Q2992506" url="?curid=659378" title="Snake &amp; Crane Arts of Shaolin">
<text>Snake &amp; Crane Arts of Shaolin () is a 1978 Hong Kong martial arts film starring Jackie Chan and directed by Chen Chi-hwa. It was released by the Lo Wei Motion Picture Company, a subsidiary of Golden Harvest. Along with Tu Wi Ho, Chen was also the film&#x27;s stunt co-ordinator.

==Plot==
Hsu Ying Fung quickly makes it known (with some help) that he possesses the &quot;Eight Steps of the Snake and Crane&quot;, a martial arts manual illustrating the ultimate fighting style. The book was written by eight Shaolin masters shortly before their disappearance, and Hsu is suspected of killing them, or at least knowing what happened. In reality, Hsu is looking for the man responsible for the masters&#x27; disappearance, whom he will know by a certain mark.

After several fights, and encounters with the leaders of many fighting clans (all of whom want the book and are willing to offer a variety of things for it), Hsu is betrayed, hurt, and eventually captured. He escapes with an unlikely ally in tow, while the rest of the clan leaders, having put aside their differences, search high and low for him. Eventually Hsu finds the man with the mark, the other clan leaders learn the fate of the Shaolin masters, and in an epic fight involving the Snake and Crane style, Hsu defeats the villain.

== Biography ==
He was born at Lübeck on 9 October 1693 or 1694. After studying at the &quot;gymnasium&quot; of Lübeck, he entered the University of Kiel (1716), where he took his master&#x27;s degree in 1718. In 1719 he became assessor in the philosophical faculty at Kiel.

His first appearance in the field of literature was in a polemical tract against John Toland, &quot;Vindiciae antiquae christianorum disciplinae&quot; (1720), which was soon followed by a volume of &quot;Observationes sacrae&quot; (1721). These works, along with the reputation he had acquired as a lecturer and preacher, secured for him a call to the University of Helmstedt as professor ordinarius in 1723. The &quot;Institutiones Historiae Ecclesiasticae Novi Testamenti&quot; appeared in 1726, and in the same year he was appointed by the duke of Brunswick abbot of Marienthal, to which dignity and emolument the abbacy of Michaelstein was added in the following year.

Mosheim was much consulted by the authorities when the new University of Göttingen was being formed, especially in the framing of the statutes of the theological faculty, and the provisions in the process of making the theologians independent of the ecclesiastical courts. In 1747 he was made chancellor of the university. In 1748 he was responsible for the visit made by George II of Great Britain to his university. He died at Göttingen on 9 September 1755.

== Works ==
Among his other works were &quot;De rebus christianorum ante Constantinum commentarii&quot; (1753), &quot;Ketzer-Geschichte&quot; (2nd edition 1748), and &quot;Sittenlehre der heiligen Schrift&quot; (1737). His exegetical writings, characterized by learning and good sense, include &quot;Cogitationes in N. T. bc. select.&quot; (1726), and expositions of I Corinthians (1741) and the two Epistles to Timothy (1755). In his sermons (Heilige Reden) considerable eloquence is shown, and a mastery of style which justifies the position he held as president of the German Society.

There are two English versions of the &quot;Institutes&quot;, that of the Revd. Archibald Maclaine, published in 1765, and that of James Murdock (1832), which is the more correct. Murdock&#x27;s translation was revised and re-edited by James Seaton Reid in 1848, and by H. L. Hastings in 1892 (Boston). An English translation of the &quot;De rebus christianorum&quot; was published by Murdock in 1851. Maclaine&#x27;s translation, the &quot;Institutes&quot; were retitled &quot;An Ecclesiastical History: Ancient and Modern, from the Birth of Christ to the Beginning of the Eighteenth Century: in which The Rise, Progress And Variation of Church Power Are Considered In Their Connection With the State Of Learning And Philosophy, and The Political History of Europe During that Period&quot;, and Mosheim&#x27;s name was Anglicized as &quot;&quot;John Lawrence Mosheim&quot;, D.D., Chancellor of the University of Göttingen.”

His &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; provided a crucial source for Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,&quot; and Gibbon borrowed many of Mosheim&#x27;s arguments.

<text>Brian Norman Roger Rix, Baron Rix (27 January 1924 – 20 August 2016) was an English actor-manager, who produced a record-breaking sequence of long-running farces on the London stage, including &quot;Dry Rot&quot;, &quot;Simple Spymen&quot; and &quot;One for the Pot&quot;. His one-night TV shows made him the joint-highest paid star on the BBC. He often worked with his wife Elspet Gray and sister Sheila Mercier, who became the matriarch in &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot;.

After his first child was born with Down syndrome, Rix became a campaigner for disability causes, among others. He entered the House of Lords as a crossbencher in 1992 and was president of Mencap from 1998 until his death.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Rix was born in Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire, the youngest of four children. His father, Herbert Rix, and Herbert&#x27;s two brothers, ran the shipping company Robert Rix in Hull, founded by his grandfather. Rix had an interest in cricket and only wished to play for Yorkshire in his childhood. He did play for Hull Cricket Club when he was 16 (and after the war for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the Stage and the Lord&#x27;s Taverners). When he was being educated at the Quaker Bootham School, York, his ambitions changed.

His elder sister Sheila became an actress during his school days, and Rix himself developed the same ambition to go on the stage. All four Rix children had become interested in the theatre because of their mother, Fanny, who ran an amateur dramatic society and was the lead soprano in the local operatic society. All her children performed in the plays and two of them, Brian and Sheila, became professional actors. Sheila Mercier, as she became known, played Annie Sugden for more than 20 years in the Yorkshire TV soap opera &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; having worked regularly with her brother in the Whitehall farces in the 1950s and 1960s.

===Actor-manager===
Rix became a professional actor when he was 18, on deferment from service with the Royal Air Force, with Donald Wolfit&#x27;s Shakespeare Company. After only four months as a professional actor, he played Sebastian in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; at the St James&#x27;s Theatre in London. His deferment was extended and he gained his first weekly repertory experience with the White Rose Players at the opera house in Harrogate. From there he went into the Royal Air Force, eventually ending up as a volunteer Bevin Boy working down the coal mines near Doncaster.

After the war, Rix returned to the stage, forming his own theatre company in 1947 as an actor-manager, a career he was to pursue for the next 30 years. He ran repertory companies at Ilkley, Bridlington and Margate, and while at Bridlington, in 1949, he found the play that was to bring him notice – &quot;Reluctant Heroes&quot;, later adapted for a film version. In the same year, he became engaged to Elspet Gray, an actress in his company, and six months later they married. They were together, domestically and professionally, for 64 years, until her death in February 2013, appearing alongside each other in many of the television farces, a radio series and three of the theatre productions.

In 1950 the newly-weds toured together with &quot;Reluctant Heroes&quot; until Rix managed to persuade the Whitehall Theatre management that this army farce was the ideal play to follow the long-running &quot;Worm&#x27;s Eye View&quot;. It was a happy choice, for Rix&#x27;s productions ran there for the next 16 years, before he moved to the Garrick Theatre, breaking many West End records in the process. His farces for BBC Television also began at the Whitehall, enlarging Rix and Gray&#x27;s profile as well as that of the Whitehall Theatre.

During the next 18 years, Rix presented more than 90 one-night-only television farces on the BBC. These were often presented at Christmas or on other bank holidays with viewing figures often reaching 15 million. In the early 1960s, Rix was the highest-paid actor (along with Robert Morley) to appear on BBC television. Alongside the regulars from his theatre company, Rix appeared in these TV productions with such names as Dora Bryan, Joan Sims, Ian Carmichael, John Le Mesurier, Patrick Cargill, Fabia Drake, Sheila Hancock, Warren Mitchell, Thora Hird and Francis Matthews. Only a handful of the televised farces remain in the BBC archive, however. Rix also appeared in 11 films and though he felt these were less suited to his talents as a farceur, these also met with some box-office success.

====Whitehall Theatre (1950–1966)====
&quot;Reluctant Heroes&quot;, the first Whitehall farce, was by Colin Morris, later known for his dramatised television documentaries. During the four-year run of &quot;Reluctant Heroes&quot; at the Whitehall, Rix also sent out national tours of the play, generally with John Slater playing the dread Sergeant Bell, and always playing to packed houses. To give some sense of its popularity, at one time Rix had the play running at the Whitehall, three tours on the road and the film on release. Rix himself played the gormless north-country recruit, Horace Gregory, in both film and throughout the four-year run at the Whitehall, where his reputation for losing his trousers began. He subsequently lost them at least 12,000 times in the 26 years he was on stage in the farces; though he lost them less in the TV plays.

In the first two years at the Whitehall, Rix&#x27;s understudy was John Chapman, who also played a small part in Act 3, which ensured a long wait in the dressing room. To occupy his time, he began the first draft of the play that was to follow &quot;Heroes&quot;. &quot;Dry Rot&quot;, later filmed, was produced in 1954 with John Slater, Basil Lord and Rix himself in the cast and ran for nearly four years. When &quot;Dry Rot&quot; went on tour with John Slater in the lead, he was joined by two young actors, Ray Cooney and Tony Hilton.

Both became involved in Rix&#x27;s next production at the Whitehall, &quot;Simple Spymen&quot; (again by John Chapman) and had time to draft &quot;One for the Pot&quot;, which followed &quot;Simple Spymen&quot;. In all, seven playwrights were spawned by the Whitehall farces – Colin Morris, John Chapman, Ray Cooney, Tony Hilton, Clive Exton, Raymond/Charles Dyer and Philip Levene. Other writers of note who worked for Rix on television included Christopher Bond, John Cleese and Barry Took.

Ronald Bryden (in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;) wrote of Rix and his company in 1964 after the opening of the fifth Whitehall farce, &quot;Chase Me Comrade&quot;:

There they are: the most robust survivors of a great tradition, the most successful British theatrical enterprises of our time. Curious that no one can be found to speak up wholeheartedly for them – no one, that is, outside enthusiastic millions who have packed every British theatre where they have played. ... It&#x27;s particularly curious considering the current intellectual agitation for a theatre of the masses, a true working class drama. Everything, apparently, for which Joan Littlewood has struggled – the boisterous, extrovert playing, the integrated team-work, the Cockney irreverance of any unself-conscious, unacademic audience bent purely on pleasure – exists, patently and profitably at the Whitehall. Yet how many devout pilgrims to Stratford East have hazarded the shorter journey to Trafalgar Square to worship at the effortless shrine at the thing itself? How many Arts Council grants have sustained Mr Rix&#x27;s company? How many &quot;Evening Standard&quot; awards went to &quot;Dry Rot&quot;? How many theses have been written on the art of Colin Morris, John Chapman and Ray Cooney? The time has come surely to fill the gap.

Despite being described by Harold Hobson in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as &quot;The greatest master of farce in my theatre-going lifetime&quot; and numerous other plaudits from critics and audiences alike, no theatrical awards were ever forthcoming. Rix was always philosophical about his lack of recognition, accepting it as the fate of so many low comedians before him. Nevertheless, Rix and his company broke the record for the longest running farce team in London&#x27;s West End. In 1961 he gave a glass of champagne to every member of the audience who had watched &quot;Simple Spymen&quot;. The drink was served by many of the popular actors who had been with Rix in one of his productions – on stage, on television and in films – and was to celebrate the Whitehall Theatre team passing the record held by the Aldwych Theatre team. The Aldwych farces ran for 10 years, seven months and four days, while Rix went on for another 16 years. Rix also had a particularly long and fruitful relationship with the director Wallace Douglas and with the set designer, Rhoda Gray (Elspet&#x27;s sister), who created the setting for practically all of Rix&#x27;s productions, both in the theatre and on TV. The Whitehall was particularly small and cramped and Rhoda&#x27;s designs overcame the most difficult of obstacles.

====Post-Whitehall (1967–1977)====
In 1967, Rix moved on to the Garrick Theatre after the Whitehall Theatre lease expired. The larger stage gave him the opportunity to try his repertoire scheme. This was a similar idea to the way plays were presented at the National Theatre – that is several productions, each one being played on different days or weeks, thus giving the actors the chance to play a variety of roles – or even to have a night or two off. Rix tried with three farces – &quot;Stand By Your Bedouin&quot;, &quot;Uproar in the House&quot; and &quot;Let Sleeping Wives Lie&quot; – but as this was a commercial venture, without any state subsidy, it proved too expensive to run and Rix was forced to keep &quot;Let Sleeping Wives Lie&quot; on at the Garrick and transfer &quot;Uproar in the House&quot;, with Nicholas Parsons playing Rix&#x27;s role, to the Whitehall. &quot;Stand By Your Bedouin went&quot; into storage. &quot;Let Sleeping Wives Lie&quot; enjoyed a further two-year run with Leslie Crowther, Elspet Gray, Derek Farr, Andrew Sachs and Rix playing the lead roles. After the first year, Rona Anderson took over from Gray.

After &quot;Let Sleeping Wives Lie&quot; finished at the Garrick, it went on a short tour before opening for a summer season at the newly restored Playhouse in Weston-super-Mare. Rix played the first four weeks and then Leslie Crowther returned and played the last six. Meantime the cast of Rix&#x27;s next West End production commuted by train every day to rehearse in London, returning in the late afternoon for their evening performance. &quot;She&#x27;s Done It Again&quot;, opened at the Garrick to the best reviews Rix had ever enjoyed, but it had the shortest run of any of his productions to that date. Rix could never find an obvious reason for the production&#x27;s short run, for the play enjoyed a sell-out tour after the Garrick. His favoured explanation was that the play, funny as it was, might have seemed somewhat old-fashioned, as it was adapted by Michael Pertwee from a pre-war farce, &quot;Nap Hand&quot;, by Vernon Sylvaine and based upon the birth of Dionne quintuplets.

Rix&#x27;s next play, also by Pertwee, was &quot;Don&#x27;t Just Lie There, Say Something!&quot; with Alfred Marks (followed by Moray Watson) playing the libidinous government minister. Reviews were not as good as the previous play, but audiences kept coming and it ran for two years at the Garrick and then enjoyed another successful tour. Rix, who had never enjoyed touring, now hated the endless nights away from home, and was delighted when the play was turned first into a television series for HTV, &quot;Men of Affairs&quot; (with Warren Mitchell as the minister) and then into a film (starring himself, Leslie Phillips and Joanna Lumley). After that, during the Three-Day Week in 1973–74, came a relatively unsuccessful pantomime season in &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; at the New Theatre, Cardiff.

Rix was by now becoming tired of going on stage night after night, and sensing that he had reached the peak of his success, began to consider retiring from the stage. However, he performed in two more farces, &quot;A Bit Between the Teeth&quot; (with Jimmy Logan and Terence Alexander) at the Cambridge Theatre and then, back at the Whitehall, &quot;Fringe Benefits&quot; (with Terence Alexander and Jane Downs). After 26 years of almost continuous performance in the West End, on 8 January 1977, Rix gave his final performance to a packed house at the Whitehall Theatre.

===Later management career===
Having retired from performing, Rix joined Cooney-Marsh Ltd – a theatre-owning and production company – run by Ray Cooney, Laurie Marsh and Rix himself. Ably assisted by his former stage manager and now PA, Joanne Benjamin, Rix was responsible for obtaining productions for various West End theatres including the Shaftesbury, the Duke of York&#x27;s, the Ambassadors and the re-built Astoria which opened with the award-winning &quot;Elvis&quot;, starring P. J. Proby, Shakin&#x27; Stevens and Tim Whitnall. Rix and his partners were also responsible for re-opening the Billy Rose Theatre in New York City, renaming it the Trafalgar and opening with a big hit – &quot;Whose Life Is It Anyway?&quot;, starring Tom Conti. Whilst in this post, he also presented (with his daughter, Louisa) the BBC Television series &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;. This was the first British programme to be created specifically for people with a learning disability, and ran from 1978 until 1982.

Rix found being on the other side of the footlights increasingly frustrating, and in 1980 he became the Secretary-General of the National Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and Adults (shortly to become the Royal Society, later Mencap). He returned to performing and the stage intermittently in later years, playing Shakespeare on BBC Radio, doing a six-month run in a revival of &quot;Dry Rot&quot;, directing a play with Cannon and Ball, playing his favourite big band jazz on BBC Radio 2, and touring three one-night-only shows, one with his wife, which explored theatrical history and his own remarkable experiences of life.

===Arts Council (1986–1993)===
From 1986 to 1993, Rix served as chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain&#x27;s Drama Panel. He was also an active chair of the Arts Council Disability Committee raising the profile and perceived importance of arts and disability issues within Arts Council decision-making. In these roles he proved dynamic and progressive.

When Rix took office the Drama Panel was male-dominated, but by 1993 there was gender parity on the panel – paradoxically his female successor unbalanced it once more, again in favour of men. He achieved a significant shift in funding priorities; while maintaining support for national and regional building-based theatre companies, he actively supported the work of small-scale experimental touring companies – including theatre for young people and for the black and minority ethnic communities – and new writing projects.

His approach meant he was able to cut through bureaucratic constraints. Before Rix&#x27;s first budget-setting exercise for the Drama Panel (when what was available for all companies was a less than inflation uplift) panel members and other members of the Arts Council had intended to fund the British-Asian theatre company Tara Arts, but no-one had been able to source the sum required. Rix however boldly proposed that the biggest national companies were stood still, so releasing money not only to fund Tara, but also allow fresh small-scale developments, and then saw that this was delivered through Panel and Council. Such willingness to take on the establishment marked his term of office. A constant champion of the interests of drama companies and theatre-workers, Rix&#x27;s seven-year term of office meant that, even in a period of Thatcherite public-funding stringency, no theatre building for which he had responsibility was closed while the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds was able to open (succeeding the Leeds Playhouse) with vastly increased capacity. Meanwhile, the number of touring companies, which had been falling before his arrival, increased from 22 to 33.

In 1993 at a retreat at Woodstock, the Council agreed that the Drama budget should be disproportionately reduced in the face of across-the-board cuts to the Council&#x27;s budget and the money allocated to other less popular art forms. In the absence of specialist arts officers at the meeting, Rix was left isolated and he resigned as a matter of principle. This created a negative public reaction and shocked senior Council figures into realising their decision was unacceptable. After a campaign, led behind scenes by his Drama Director Ian Brown and publicly by Drama Panel members, the disproportionate cut was rescinded.

===Campaigner===
Rix and his wife, Elspet became involved in the world of learning disability, when in December 1951 the first of their four children was born. Their daughter, Shelley, was diagnosed with Down syndrome. There was no welfare support for the children affected and little education. The only offering the state made was a place in a Victorian era, run-down hospital where patients were left to their own devices for hours at a time. The Rixes were determined to improve the situation and became involved with charities campaigning on the issue. Among these roles, in the early 1960s, Rix became the first Chairman of the Special Functions Fundraising committee at the National Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and Adults, later known as Mencap. Both his personal experience and his leading position as a fundraiser in the field finally led to Rix applying for the job at Mencap and then when he retired in 1987 to him becoming chairman in 1988. In 1998, he became president, an office he held until he died.

====House of Lords====
Entering the House of Lords as a crossbencher in 1992, Rix campaigned ceaselessly on any legislation affecting people with a learning disability. He was one of the most regular attenders in the House and every year introduced numerous amendments to legislation, mainly that associated with health, social welfare and education. He found the length of time required to change legislation very frustrating. One example in 1994 was when Rix introduced a private member&#x27;s bill ensuring that local authorities would provide short-term breaks for carers and cared-for alike, on a reasonably timed basis. The bill easily passed through the Lords, but could not even achieve a first reading in the House of Commons.

Rix tried again when New Labour became the government in 1997, but again to no avail. Eventually, 12 years after Rix&#x27;s private member&#x27;s bill, short-term breaks sneaked through in an Education Bill, introduced by the then Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, Ed Balls. The extent of his involvement can be seen by looking at the some of other legislation altered in the same year as the Education Bill (2006). His amendments to the Childcare Bill extended statutory childcare provision for children with a disability from 16 to 18 years old, whilst changes to the Electoral Administration Bill lead to people with a learning disability being able to vote freely.

Rix discovered in the mid-1990s that the legislation regarding State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) had been altered under Margaret Thatcher. The original act had ensured that widows and widowers would receive the full SERPS addition to their state pension if their spouse died first. The change in legislation halved the amount received. Rix campaigned to restore the original payment and after a number of years arguing the point with the New Labour Government, he succeeded.

====Affiliated groups====
Amongst his many activities, he was the co-chairman (with Tom Clarke ) of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Learning Disability; chairman of the Rix Thompson Rothenberg (RTR) Foundation which provides small grants for projects serving people with a learning disability; and president of the grant making Normansfield and Richmond Foundation. He was also a constant supporter of the Rix Centre at the University of East London, which develops and disseminates tools and training for multi-media advocacy to enhance the lives of people with a learning disability. Rix also served as the first chairman of the Arts Council Monitoring Committee on Arts and Disability as well as founding and chairing the charity Libertas (working alongside Sir John Cox and Rix&#x27;s son, Jonathan) which produced dozens of audio guides for disabled people at museums, historical buildings and other places of interest. Subsequent legislation in which he played an important role made this charity redundant.

He was involved as chairman and president of Friends of Normansfield, President of the Roy Kinnear Memorial Trust, chairman and founder (with Dr David Towell of the King&#x27;s Fund) of the Independent Council for People with a Mental Handicap and was patron of RAIBC – the charity working for radio amateurs with disabilities. Rix also campaigned against smoking; having been a smoker for ten years, Rix gave up smoking on Boxing Day in 1950 when he lost his voice during a matinee of &quot;Reluctant Heroes&quot;. He subsequently became a passionate non-smoker and a founding member of Action on Smoking and Health (ASH).

===Personal life===
In 1949 he married the actress Elspet Gray. The couple had four children, the producer and children&#x27;s author Jamie Rix, Jonathan Rix (Professor of Participation and Learning Support at the Open University), actress Louisa Rix and Shelley Rix. Shelley was born with Down syndrome, and her father began to use his public profile to promote awareness and understanding of learning disabilities. Shelley died in July 2005 in Hounslow, Greater London. Elspet Gray died on 18 February 2013.

Rix became a radio ham at the age of 13 and became a life vice-president of the Radio Society of Great Britain in 1979. His call sign was G2DQU. He was also president of the Friends of Richmond Park. In 1970 he was President of the Lord&#x27;s Taverners and he continued his love of cricket as a member of the MCC and Yorkshire CCC. Rix was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions, in October 1961 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at a friend&#x27;s house in Surrey, and again in April 1977, when Andrews surprised him at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London. He was also a castaway on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on two occasions. The first was with Roy Plomley on 16 May 1960, which was also the first time a castaway was caught on film and broadcast the following evening. His second appearance was with Kirsty Young on 1 March 2009.

In August 2016, Rix announced that he was terminally ill, and called for the legalisation of voluntary euthanasia for those dying in severe pain. This was a significant departure from his previous position; in 2006 he had voted against the Assisted Dying Bill. He died on 20 August 2016 at Denville Hall in Northwood, London.

===Honours and awards===
Rix was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1977 Birthday Honours, and knighted in June 1986 for his services to charity. On his 68th birthday, 27 January 1992, he was created a life peer, becoming Baron Rix of Whitehall in the City of Westminster and of Hornsea in Yorkshire.

<text>One from the Modern is the fourth album by Ocean Colour Scene.

The album made a departure from the two previous albums &quot;Moseley Shoals&quot; and &quot;Marchin&#x27; Already&quot;, and is slower and sadder. It was panned by critics who accused it of being too commercial and labelled it &quot;dad rock&quot;. The album was dismissed by David Belcher of &quot;The Herald&quot;, who commented on its &quot;strangled vocals&quot; and &quot;cringe-worthy lyrics.&quot; Nicholas Barber writing for &quot;The Independent&quot; concurred saying: &quot;Much of the blame must rest on Simon Fowler. His mangled vocals and nonsense lyrics suggest that he doesn&#x27;t know what it is he wants to communicate.&quot;

The protest song &quot;Profit in Peace&quot; was the first single, with &quot;So Low&quot; and then a double release of &quot;I Am the News&quot;/&quot;July&quot;. The song &quot;Soul Driver&quot; is dedicated to Paul Weller, who mentored the band.

The album&#x27;s cover photograph was taken in the Yew Garden at Packwood House near Lapworth, Warwickshire, a National Trust Property.

<text>The first USS &quot;Gridley&quot; (DD-92) was a in the United States Navy during World War I. She was named in honor of Charles Vernon Gridley.

==History==
&quot;Gridley&quot; was launched by the Union Iron Works of San Francisco, California on 4 July 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Francis P. Thomas, the daughter of Captain Gridley. The destroyer was commissioned on 8 March 1919, Comdr. Frank Jack Fletcher in command.

After fitting out at the Mare Island Navy Yard, &quot;Gridley&quot; departed San Diego on 24 March 1919, transited the Panama Canal, and joined the Destroyer Force for maneuvers in Cuban waters. She then repaired briefly at Norfolk, Virginia, before putting into New York on 26 April 1919. &quot;Gridley&quot;″s first assignment was with a group of destroyers posted along the route of the Navy&#x27;s transatlantic seaplane flight. &quot;Gridley&quot; and her companions sent up smoke and flare signals to guide the intrepid flyers and with the help of the surface ships the aircraft NC-4 was successfully able to land in the dense fog at the Azores on 17 May 1919. Subsequently &quot;Gridley&quot; participated in the search for the aircraft NC-1, forced down in the fog, and then acted as guard ship on the last leg of NC-4&#x27;s historic flight, which was completed at Plymouth, England on 31 May 1919.

&quot;Gridley&quot; arrived at Brest, France on 31 May and spent the next two months in various ports of the Mediterranean transporting passengers and making goodwill visits. She arrived back at New York on 31 July. Operating out of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, &quot;Gridley&quot; embarked Major General Lejeune and Brigadier General Butler of the Marine Corps at Charleston on 2 September 1920, for an inspection tour of Caribbean bases and commands, including posts in Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Her passengers disembarked on 27 September 1920.

In the following years &quot;Gridley&quot; was active training officers and men of the Naval Reserve Force, operating out of Charleston, Newport, New York, and Philadelphia. She decommissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 22 June 1922 and remained inactive until her name was stricken from the Navy List on 25 January 1937. &quot;Gridley&quot;″s hulk was sold for scrapping on 19 April 1939.

<text>The Sage Group plc, commonly known as Sage, is a British multinational enterprise software company based in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. it is the UK&#x27;s second largest technology company, the world&#x27;s third-largest supplier of enterprise resource planning software (behind Oracle and SAP), the largest supplier to small businesses, and has 6.1 million customers worldwide. It has offices in 23 countries. The company is a patron of The Glasshouse, Gateshead music venue in Gateshead.

Sage is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
==History==

===1981 to 2000===
The company was founded by David Goldman, Paul Muller, and Graham Wylie in 1981 in Newcastle upon Tyne, to develop estimating and accounting software for small businesses.

A student at Newcastle University, Graham Wylie, took a summer job with an accountancy firm funded by a government small business grant to write software to help their record keeping. This became the basis for Sage Line 50. Next, hired by David Goldman to write some estimating software for his printing company, Campbell Graphics, Graham used the same accounting software to produce the first version of Sage Accounts. David was so impressed that he hired Graham and academic Paul Muller to form Sage, selling their software first to printing companies, and then to a wider market through a network of resellers.

In 1984, the company launched &quot;Sage software&quot;, a product for the Amstrad PCW word processor, which used the CP/M operating system. Sage software sales escalated in that year from 30 copies a month to over 300. The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1989.

In 1991, Sage acquired Dac Software, Inc., a pioneering American accounting software developer, from Insilco Corporation who were undergoing bankruptcy reorganization at the time. Dac Software were well known for their DacEasy software suite, which was one of the first integrated accounting software titles to retail for well under $100, when most of its competitors sold suites with equivalent functionality for thousands of US$.

In 1994, Paul Walker was appointed Chief Executive. In 1998, Sage&#x27;s Professional Accountants Division was established. In 1999, Sage entered FTSE 100 and launched a dedicated Irish division, based in Dublin as well as its e-business strategy. In that same year the UK acquisition of Tetra saw Sage enter the mid-range business software market.

Sage was the best-performing UK share in the 1990s, increasing in value by 28,000%.

===2000 to 2010===

In 2001, Sage acquired Interact Commerce Inc. and entered the CRM/contact management market and in 2002 Sage won &quot;Business of The Year&quot; in the National Business Awards. Also that year, Sage sponsored the new Music Centre in Gateshead for £6m – now known as Sage Gateshead – the largest ever UK arts/business sponsorship. Sage are one of two technology stocks listed on the FTSE 100 Index, the other being Micro Focus. In 2003, at age 43, Graham Wylie retired with 108.5 million shares in Sage worth £146m. He was rated Britain&#x27;s 109th richest person in the 2002 &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List.

Tony Hobson joined the Sage board of directors in June 2004 and became chairman in May 2007.

===2010 to present===
On 19 April 2010, Sage announced that its CEO, Paul Walker, had indicated an interest in stepping down from his position, which he had held for 16 years. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that his departure would lead to speculation over Sage&#x27;s mergers and acquisitions, which have been a key component to the group&#x27;s growth in the past 20 years.

Walker was one of the longest serving CEOs of an FTSE100 company. Walker left the company on 1 December 2010.

On 1 October 2010 Guy Berruyer became CEO of Sage Group; Berruyer had previously been CEO of Sage&#x27;s Mainland Europe &amp; Asia operations.

On 15 February 2013, Sage announced that Accel-KKR intended to buy Sage Nonprofit Solutions, its division that produced software designed for nonprofit organisations and governmental agencies.

In August 2014, Sage announced that Guy Berruyer would retire. Stephen Kelly, the UK government&#x27;s former chief operating officer, became group CEO in November 2014. In September 2014 the company announced the acquisition of PayChoice for $157 million. In 2016 Sage introduced their first AI offering, a chat bot named Pegg.

In March 2017, Sage Group acquired Compass, an analytics and benchmarking platform. In March 2017, Sage Group also acquired Fairsail, a Human Capital Management (HCM) cloud-based platform. In July 2017, Sage purchased Intacct for $850M.

On 31 August 2018, Sage announced that Stephen Kelly had stepped down as a director and CEO. On 2 November 2018, Steve Hare was appointed CEO. Hare had been chief financial officer of Sage since 2014 and had been interim COO following the departure of the previous CEO.

In 2020, Sage divested its Brazilian operations to the president of the local business, Jorge Carneiro. In the 2020s Sage began to integrate artificial intelligence into more of their products. In 2022 Sage launched a carbon accounting product, Sage Earth.

<text>Mechanical Wonder is the fifth album by Ocean Colour Scene. It peaked on the UK album chart at #7 and lasted four weeks in the top 75. To date, it is the last Ocean Colour Scene release to enter the top 10.

Simon Fowler wrote in the liner notes of the band&#x27;s greatest hits album &quot;Songs for the Front Row&quot; that the title referred to cars on the motorway. Live however, Simon Fowler often sings &quot;and the radio plays only fucking Radio 1&quot;, a possible reference to the lack of airplay the band get. The other single from the album was &quot;Up on the Downside&quot;, which fared better in the charts. The album was not a success, marking the end of the Britpop success of the band. After the failure of the album, the band decided to release themselves from their contract with their record label.

<doc id="659413" wikidata="Q111770" url="?curid=659413" title="Eddie Gray (footballer, born 1948)">
<text>Edwin Gray (born 17 January 1948) is a Scottish former football player and coach. Gray was a winger, who was an integral member of the legendary Leeds United team of the 1960s and 1970s, later twice becoming the club&#x27;s manager.

In 2000, Gray was voted as the third Greatest Leeds United player of all time, surpassed only by his club captain, Billy Bremner (No. 1) and John Charles (No. 2). He was also voted into the Greatest Leeds United team of all time. His two goals against Burnley in 1970 feature in Leeds United&#x27;s Greatest 100 goals – the second of which is widely regarded as the greatest Leeds United goal of all time and recently featured in &quot;The Times&quot; as one of the five greatest ever goals. On 9 May 2013, Gray was also appointed as Leeds United football Ambassador. Gray was also inducted into the English Hall of Fame on 25 September 2013 at an awards evening in Manchester.

Gray played in 12 full international games for Scotland between 1969 and 1977. Besides his two stints with Leeds, Gray also managed Whitby Town, Rochdale and Hull City during the 1980s.

He was appointed MBE in the 1983 Birthday Honours.

==Playing career==
Gray was born in Glasgow and brought up in the city&#x27;s Castlemilk district. He was a schoolboy international for Scotland. He had aspirations of signing for his boyhood team Celtic, but signed professional forms with Leeds United at the age of 16. He made his first team debut on New Year&#x27;s Day 1966, less than three weeks before his 18th birthday, and would go on to play for the club for almost 20 years. A winger in the classic mould, Gray was feted in world football for his ability to beat opposing full backs for skill, pace and thought. As the Leeds team grew in stature and experience through the 1960s, Gray became a vital component of the team.

In 1968, he was in the Leeds team which won the League Cup and the Fairs Cup double, scoring winning goals in both semi-finals, including a memorable individual goal against Brian Clough&#x27;s Derby County in the semi-final of the League Cup. However injury meant he missed the second leg of the Fairs Cup final. He was then an important part of the team that won League championship a year later, making 33 appearances and scoring five goals, during a season in which United scored a record number of championship points and lost only two matches along the way to conquering the title. However it was in 1970 that he would make his most famous appearance in a Leeds shirt.

The team was chasing a unique &quot;treble&quot; of League championship, FA Cup and European Cup with Gray in sparkling form. He had already scored what many fans of the club call the greatest goal ever by a Leeds player – a solo run past several Burnley players which involved flicks and dragbacks as he somehow got to a shooting position from a position on the goal-line well to the left of the goal – when his day came at Wembley for the 1970 FA Cup Final against Chelsea.

Gray&#x27;s marking full back was David Webb, a steady but undistinguished defender whom, for the 90 minutes and extra-time period, Gray tormented. Webb was repeatedly left on his backside or looking the wrong way as Gray ghosted past him, including one run where he cut inside onto his &#x27;weaker&#x27; right foot and crashed a shot against the crossbar. Though Leeds dominated the match, the game still ended 2–2 and a replay was required – Gray had taken the corner which had allowed Jack Charlton to open the scoring. In the replay, Chelsea changed tactics and put the more uncompromising Ron Harris on to Gray and as a result, the danger was snuffed out – Harris badly injured Gray with a brutal tackle to the back of the knee. Chelsea won 2–1 and, in a final twist, it was Webb who scored the winner. Leeds lost the League championship race to Everton and the European Cup semi-final to Celtic, thereby ended with nothing.

Gray&#x27;s frequent battles with injury started, and he missed more than half of the 1970–71 season, during which Leeds again snatched League championship defeat from the jaws of victory but won the Fairs Cup for the second time against Juventus. He found devastating form again for part of the 1971–72 season in which he was part of the team that destroyed Manchester United and Southampton consecutively at Elland Road, by scorelines of 5–1 and 7–0; the match footage of both games would become iconic. Later in the same season he featured in the team which won the 1972 FA Cup Final against Arsenal and featured again in the following cup final which Leeds surprisingly lost to Sunderland. He missed the controversial 1973 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final defeat to A.C. Milan, and missed most of the season in 1973–74 when Leeds won the League title again thanks to more injury woes. These injuries had become so frequent that when Brian Clough succeeded Don Revie at Leeds United, he began his first team meeting by stating that if Eddie Gray had been a horse, he would have been shot long ago.

His performance on the wing earned the famous tribute from Revie that &quot;when he plays on snow, he doesn&#x27;t leave any footprints&quot;. Gray played in the team which reached the 1975 European Cup Final in Paris, featuring in the home victory against the Spanish champions Barcelona in the semi-final, during which Gray tormented his marker de la Cruz and pushed Barcelona onto the back foot, allowing Leeds to dominate. However, he was left from the starting line up for the final by manager Jimmy Armfield, which Leeds would go on to lose controversially to Bayern Munich. Also featuring in this campaign was his younger brother Frank, who had likewise come through the ranks at Elland Road. This was the swansong of the great Don Revie team (Revie himself had left a year earlier to take over as England manager) and Gray&#x27;s teammates started to leave the club. By the early 1980s, Gray was the only player from any part of the Revie era still at the club (although Peter Lorimer and David Harvey would later make comebacks). Converted to left back, Gray prolonged his career and was in the side which was relegated under former teammate Allan Clarke in 1982.

Gray&#x27;s unfortunate injury record meant that his Scotland career was short and infrequent. He won just 12 caps and missed the 1974 FIFA World Cup through injury. In an era of hard men – Bremner, Harris, Smith, etc., Gray also had the distinction of never being booked in his career.

==Managerial career==
Gray then took over as player-manager at Leeds in 1982, following their relegation from the First Division. The club had to turn to a youth policy to rebuild the team, with the emergence of players like John Sheridan, Neil Aspin, Denis Irwin and Scott Sellars. After top half finishes in his first two seasons in charge, the 1984–85 season saw a push for promotion that was lost on the final day at Birmingham City. Following failure to gain promotion from the Second Division, Gray ended association with Leeds after 20 years, 561 games and 68 goals.

He would later manage Whitby Town. In 1986, Gray took over at Rochdale and in the 1986–87 season the club managed an escape from near-certain relegation from the Football League.

Gray took over at Hull City for season 1988–89, following the departure of Brian Horton the previous season. Hull managed to pull into mid-table and only five points short of the play-offs in February, and they reached the FA Cup fifth round where they lost to Liverpool. Only 1 win in the last 18 games meant that Hull finished fourth from bottom, yet clear of relegation danger, but the poor form led to his departure.

==Return to Leeds==
Gray continued his long standing association with Leeds United by joining the club as a Youth Team coach. His work with the youth set-up nurtured a terrific generation of Leeds players such as Harry Kewell, Ian Harte, Alan Smith and Jonathan Woodgate, who all went on to become first-team regulars. In 1997, Gray was promoted to Reserve Team Manager and the following year was made new manager David O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s assistant.

To the aggravation of Leeds supporters, Gray was forced to take a back step when Brian Kidd was promoted from Academy Manager to Head Coach and was given all coaching responsibilities. The fans made their support known for Gray through banners at matches, whilst at the same time verbally abusing Kidd. Both Gray and Kidd were relieved of their duties in 2003 when new manager Peter Reid took the reins.

When Reid left Leeds in 2003, Gray was charged with the task of trying to preserve their FA Premier League status, something which, under immense pressure, he could not do. Gray was then given a one-year football consultancy role at the club before joining BBC Radio Leeds as a matchday analyst. In 2008, the BBC lost their rights to the live radio broadcast of Leeds matches; as a result, Gray left BBC Radio Leeds and moved to the club&#x27;s official radio station, Yorkshire Radio.

On 9 May 2013, Gray was appointed Football Ambassador at Leeds United and would also remain in his role as Yorkshire Radio Co-Commentator. He is currently co-commentator alongside Thom Kirwin for Leeds United&#x27;s own TV and Radio Channel LUTV.

== Family football links ==
Eddie Gray&#x27;s son Stuart (who predeceased his father in 2024) followed into professional football, playing for Celtic, the team Eddie had supported as a boy. His nephew, Andy Gray, son of his brother Frank, was another professional footballer and also played for Leeds. Eddie&#x27;s great-nephew Archie currently plays for Tottenham Hotspur.

<text>Information-theoretic death is a term of art used in cryonics to define death in a way that is permanent and independent of any future medical advances, no matter how distant or improbable that may be. Because detailed reading or restoration of information-storing brain structures is beyond current technology, the term lacks practical importance in contemporary medicine.

<text>The American Saddlebred is a horse breed from the United States. Descended from riding-type horses bred at the time of the American Revolution, the American Saddlebred includes the Narragansett Pacer, Canadian Pacer, Morgan and Thoroughbred among its ancestors. Developed into its modern type in Kentucky, it was once known as the &quot;Kentucky Saddler&quot;, and used extensively as an officer&#x27;s mount in the American Civil War. In 1891, a breed registry was formed in the United States. Throughout the 20th century, the breed&#x27;s popularity continued to grow in the United States, and exports began to South Africa and Great Britain. Since the formation of the US registry, almost 250,000 American Saddlebreds have been registered, and can now be found around the world, with separate breed registries established in Great Britain, Australia, continental Europe, and southern Africa.

Averaging in height, Saddlebreds are known for their sense of presence and style, as well as for their spirited, yet gentle, temperament. They may be of any color, including pinto patterns, which have been acknowledged in the breed since the late 1800s. They are considered a gaited breed, as some Saddlebreds are bred and trained to perform four-beat ambling gaits, one being a &quot;slow gait&quot; that historically was one of three possible ambling patterns, and the much faster rack. 

Since the mid-1800s, the breed has played a prominent part in the US horse show industry, and is called the &quot;peacock of the horse world&quot;. They have attracted the attention of numerous celebrities, who have become breeders and exhibitors, and purebred and partbred American Saddlebreds have appeared in several films, especially during the Golden Age of Hollywood. Saddlebreds are mainly known for their performance in the show ring, but can also be seen in competition in several other English riding disciplines and combined driving, as well as being used as a pleasure riding horse. American Saddlebreds often compete in five primary divisions: Five-Gaited, Three-Gaited, Fine Harness, Park and Pleasure. In these divisions they are judged on performance, manners, presence, quality and conformation.

==Characteristics==
American Saddlebreds stand high, averaging , and weigh between . Members of the breed have well-shaped heads with a straight profile, long, slim, arched necks, well-defined withers, sloping shoulders, correct leg conformation, and strong level backs with well-sprung ribs. The croup is level with a high-carried tail. Enthusiasts consider them to be spirited, yet gentle, animals. Any color is acceptable, but most common are chestnut, bay, brown and black. Some are gray, roan, palomino and pinto. The first-known pinto Saddlebred was a stallion foaled in 1882. In 1884 and 1891, two additional pintos, both mares, were foaled. These three horses were recorded as &quot;spotted&quot;, but many other pinto Saddlebreds with minimal markings were recorded only by their base color, without making note of their markings. This practice continued into the 1930s, at which time breeders came to be more accepting of &quot;colored&quot; horses and began recording markings and registering horses as pinto. The Saddlebred has been called the &quot;world&#x27;s most beautiful horse&quot; by admirers, and is known as the &quot;peacock of the horse world&quot;. The United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) describes the Saddlebred as follows: &quot;He carries himself with an attitude that is elusive of description—some call it &quot;class&quot;, presence, quality, style, or charm. This superior air distinguishes his every movement.&quot;

Saddlebreds are popularly known as show horses, with horses being shown saddle seat in both three-gaited and five-gaited classes. The former are the three common gaits seen in most breeds, the walk, trot and canter. The latter includes the three regular gaits, plus two four-beat ambling gaits known as the slow gait and the rack. The slow gait is a four-beat gait in which the lateral pairs of legs leave the ground together, but strike the ground at different times, the hind foot connecting slightly before the forefoot. In the show ring, the gait should be performed with restraint and precision. Historically, the slow gait could be either the running walk, the stepping pace, or the fox trot. The modern five-gaited Saddlebred typically performs a stepping pace.

The rack is also a lateral four-beat gait, but with equal intervals between each footfall. In the show ring, the gait is performed with speed and action, appearing unrestrained. 

===Health concerns===
Lordosis, also known as swayback, low back or soft back, has been found to have a hereditary basis in Saddlebreds and a recessive mode of inheritance. The precise mutation has not yet been located, but researchers believe it to be somewhere on horse chromosome 20. Researching this condition may help more than just the Saddlebred breed as it may &quot;serve as a model for investigating congenital skeletal deformities in horses and other species.&quot; Horses with lordosis are generally healthy and unaffected by the condition, and are eligible to compete in many divisions, but a swayback must be penalized as a fault at shows, in addition to other conformation flaws. Due to the high head position common in the show ring, Saddlebreds can have impairments to the upper respiratory system, but it is rare.

==History==
The Saddlebred has origins in the Galloway and Hobby horses of the British Isles, animals sometimes called palfreys, which had ambling gaits and were brought to the United States by early settlers. These animals were further refined in America to become a now-extinct breed called the Narragansett Pacer, 
 a riding and driving breed known for its ambling and pacing gaits. When colonists imported Thoroughbreds to America, beginning in 1706, they were crossed with the Narragansett Pacer, which, combined with massive exports, ultimately led to the extinction of the Narragansett as a purebred breed. To preserve important bloodlines, Canadian Pacers were introduced instead. By the time of the American Revolution, a distinct type of riding horse had developed with the size and quality of the Thoroughbred, but the ambling gaits and stamina of the Pacer breeds. This animal was called the American Horse. Its existence was first documented in a 1776 letter when an American diplomat wrote to the Continental Congress asking for one to be sent to France as a gift for Marie Antoinette.

===19th century===
Other breeds which played a role in the development of the Saddlebred in the 19th century include the Morgan, Standardbred and Hackney. The Canadian Pacer had a particularly significant impact. The breed, originally of French origin, was also influential in the development of the Standardbred and Tennessee Walking Horse. The most influential Canadian Pacer on Saddlebred lines was Tom Hall, a blue roan stallion foaled in 1806. After being imported to the United States from Canada, he was registered as an American Saddlebred and became the foundation stallion of several Saddlebred lines. 
The American Horse was further refined in Kentucky, where the addition of more Thoroughbred blood created a taller and better-looking horse that became known as the Kentucky Saddler. There were originally seventeen foundation stallions listed by the breed registry, but by 1908 the registry decided to list only one and the remainder were identified as &quot;Noted Deceased Sires.&quot; Today, two foundation sires of the breed are recognized, both Thoroughbred crosses. The first was Denmark, son of an imported Thoroughbred, who for many years was the only recognized foundation stallion. His son, Gaines&#x27; Denmark, was in the pedigrees of over 60 percent of the horses registered in the first three volumes of the breed&#x27;s studbook. A second foundation sire was recognized in 1991, Harrison Chief. This sire was a descendent of the Thoroughbred Messenger, who is also considered a foundation stallion for the Standardbred breed.

During the American Civil War, American Saddlebreds were commonly used by the military, and known for their bravery and endurance. Many officers used them as mounts, and included in their numbers are General Lee&#x27;s Traveller, General Grant&#x27;s Cincinnati, General Sherman&#x27;s Lexington, and General Jackson&#x27;s Little Sorrell. Other generals who used them during the conflict include John Hunt Morgan and Basil W. Duke during his time with Morgan&#x27;s Raiders. Kentucky Saddlers were used during brutal marches with the latter group, and the historical record suggests that they held up better than horses of other breeds.

The American Saddlebred Horse Association was formed in 1891, then called the National Saddle Horse Breeders Association (NSHBA). Private individuals had produced studbooks for other breeds, such as the Morgan, as early as 1857, but the NSHBA was the first national association for an American-developed breed of horse. A member of Morgan&#x27;s Raiders, General John Breckinridge Castleman, was instrumental in forming the NSHBA. In 1899, the organization name was changed to the American Saddle Horse Breeders Association, clarifying the breed&#x27;s name as the &quot;American Saddle Horse,&quot; not simply &quot;Saddle Horse.&quot;

===20th century to present===

After World War I, the American Saddlebred began to be exported to South Africa, and it is now the most popular non-racing breed in that country. Saddlebred horse show standards continued to evolve through the 1920s, as the popularity of the breed grew. The Saddlebred industry slowed during World War II, but began to grow again post-war, with Mexico, Missouri earning the title &quot;Saddle Horse Capital of the World&quot;. Exports continued, and though attempts to begin a South African breed registry had started in 1935, it was not until 1949 that the Saddle Horse Breeders&#x27; Society of South Africa was formed. The 1950s saw continued growth of the Saddlebred breed, and The Lemon Drop Kid, a fine harness horse, became the first, and only, Saddlebred to appear on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. In the late 1950s, the Saddle Horse Capital became centered in Shelby County, Kentucky, largely due to the success of breeders Charles and Helen Crabtree, the latter a renowned equitation coach. Although individual Saddlebreds had been exported to Great Britain throughout the breed&#x27;s history, the first breeding groups were transported there in 1966. For the next three decades, enthusiasts worked to establish a breeding and showing platform for the breed in the UK.

In 1980, the name of the American Saddle Horse Breeder&#x27;s Association was changed to the American Saddlebred Horse Association (ASHA), membership was opened to non-breeders, and the group began to focus on breed promotion. In 1985, the ASHA became the first breed registry to have their headquarters at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, Kentucky. A decade later, in 1995, the United Saddlebred Association – UK was formed to register Saddlebreds in Great Britain, and acts as the British affiliate of the ASHA. Since the founding of the American registry, almost 250,000 horses have been accepted, with almost 3,000 new foals registered annually. It is the oldest still-functioning breed registry in the US. Most common in the eastern US, the breed is also found throughout North America, Europe, Australia, and in South Africa.

Located at the Kentucky Horse Park is the American Saddlebred Museum, which curates a large collection of Saddlebred-related items and artwork, as well as a 2,500-volume library of breed-related works. There are many magazines which focus on the American Saddlebred: &quot;Show Horse Magazine&quot;, &quot;Bluegrass Horseman&quot;, &quot;The National Horseman&quot;, &quot;Saddle and Bridle&quot;, and &quot;Show Horse International&quot;.

===Show ring history===
As a show horse, Saddlebreds were exhibited in Kentucky as early as 1816, and were a prominent part of the first national horse show in the United States, held at the St. Louis Fair in 1856. The Kentucky State Fair began running a World Championship show in 1917, offering a $10,000 prize for the champion five-gaited horse. Also in 1917, the American Horse Shows Association, now the United States Equestrian Federation, formed and began to standardize show formats and rules. In 1957, the American Saddlebred Pleasure Horse Association was formed to regulate English pleasure classes. Today, the most prestigious award in the breed industry is the American Saddlebred &quot;Triple Crown&quot;: winning the five-gaited championships at the Lexington Junior League Horse Show, the Kentucky State Fair World&#x27;s Championship Horse Show, and American Royal horse show; a feat that has only been accomplished by six horses.

The breed&#x27;s show history also paralleled major historical developments. Heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis, who owned and exhibited Saddlebreds into the 1940s, organized the first &quot;All-Negro&quot; horse show in Utica, Michigan, allowing greater opportunities for African-American people to exhibit horses at a time when there was significant racial segregation in the United States. Gas shortages in the 1970s and 1980s put pressure on the recreational dollar, and saw the growth of single breed shows at the expense of the multi-breed traditional horse show. At the beginning of the 21st century, the number of women showing Saddlebreds increased, with female competitors winning several world championships.

==Uses==
Today, the Saddlebred is exhibited in the United States in multiple divisions, including assorted in-hand classes; ridden in saddle seat classes for three- and five-gaited horses in both Park and pleasure classes, hunter country pleasure, and western pleasure; plus pleasure driving, fine harness, roadster harness classes. In five-gaited competition, they are shown with a full tail, often augmented with an artificial switch, and a full mane. Three-gaited horses are shown with a shaved off &quot;roached&quot; mane and a full tail. The trend of the three-gaited horse being presented with the hair at the top of their tails, an area called the dock, trimmed short, has fallen out of style over the past several decades. While use of a set tail in certain types of competition was common, today, tail sets are generally not allowed on the show grounds for horses in the Pleasure divisions, and horses with unset tails are not penalized in any division. Gingering is prohibited.

Outside of breed-specific shows, the Saddlebred is also promoted as suitable for competitive trail riding, endurance riding, dressage, combined driving, eventing, and show jumping. Some Saddlebreds are also suitable for fox hunting, cutting and roping. Because they are so closely affiliated with their traditional show ring competition, they are sometimes mistaken for warmbloods or Thoroughbred crosses when participating in other equine events. They are also suitable family horses used for trail and pleasure riding and ranch work.

===Film and celebrity affiliation===

Many film and television horses of the Golden Age of Hollywood were also Saddlebreds, including the horses used in lead roles in &quot;My Friend Flicka&quot;, &quot;National Velvet&quot;, &quot;Fury&quot; and one version of &quot;Black Beauty&quot;. A part-Saddlebred played the lead role in the TV series Mr. Ed, and a Saddlebred was used in a prominent role in &quot;Giant&quot;. In the 1990s, William Shatner, an actor and Saddlebred breeder, rode one of his own horses, a mare named Great Belles of Fire, in his role as James T. Kirk in &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;. Numerous other celebrities besides Shatner have been owners and exhibitors of the breed, including Clark Gable, Will Rogers, Joe Louis, and Carson Kressley.

<text>The American Belgian Draft is an American breed of draft horse. It derives from the draft horses of Belgium but, as a result of isolation and different selective breeding, became genetically distinct from them in the early part of the twentieth century. It is generally taller and less heavily built, and has a very different distribution of coat colors.

== History ==

The American Belgian derives from heavy draft horses of Ardennais, Brabant and Flemish stock imported from Belgium in the latter part of the nineteenth century and in the early years of the twentieth. A breed association, the American Association of Importers and Breeders of Belgian Draft Horses, was founded in 1887 in Wabash, Indiana. Imports ceased during the First World War, resumed in the 1930s, and ceased again when the Second World War broke out; Erwin F. Dygert of Iowa bought a horse from the last shipment made from Europe as the war was beginning.

From the 1920s the American Belgian was bred to be somewhat taller and lighter-bodied than the original European stock.

With the mechanization of agriculture in the post-war years, demand for draft horses fell sharply, and annual registrations of the American Belgian fell to a few hundred per year. Both numbers and demand gradually recovered, and it is now the most numerous breed of draft horse in the United States.

== Characteristics ==

The American Belgian is a large heavy horse; it is rather taller and more lightly built than the Belgian Brabant, more similar to the Flemish Horse. Some are very large: a stallion named Brooklyn Supreme is among the largest horses on record, and was of this breed, as was Big Jake, a gelding born in 2001, who while alive was listed by the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the tallest living horse.

The most usual color is light chestnut with a flaxen mane and tail, sometimes called &quot;sorrel&quot;; other possible coat colors are bay, black, gray, red bay and roan. The head is relatively small and well-shaped in comparison to that of other draft breeds.

The American Belgian Draft has a high incidence of junctional epidermolysis bullosa, an inherited genetic disorder that affects newborn foals, often resulting in death. A study conducted in 2001–2003 found 17.1% of Belgians tested in the US and Canada to be carriers. A polymerase chain reaction test for the disease became available in 2002; the Belgian Draft Horse Corp requires testing. Belgians are also at risk of chronic progressive lymphedema, which causes swelling in the lower legs.

== Uses ==
American Belgians are used as working animals and in pulling contests. They may also be shown or ridden.

<text>Bernard Leon Barker (March 17, 1917 – June 5, 2009) was a Watergate burglar and undercover operative in CIA-directed plots to overthrow Cuban leader Fidel Castro.

==Early life==
Barker was born in Havana, to a Russian American father of Jewish descent and a Cuban mother. Therefore, Barker was a dual citizen of Cuba and the United States. At the age of 16, Barker joined the ABC, a revolutionary group opposed to then president Gerardo Machado y Morales. It was during this period that he acquired the nickname &quot;Macho&quot;. Worried by these developments, Barker&#x27;s father sent him to live in the United States. In 1935 Barker became an American citizen, but he returned to Cuba in order to study at the University of Havana.

==World War II==
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, triggering US entry into World War II, Barker joined the United States Army Air Forces, where he became a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress crewman and a Second lieutenant bombardier. On his thirteenth combat mission, he was shot down on a bombing raid to Braunschweig, Germany, February 10, 1944. The Germans held him as a prisoner of war at Stalag Luft I in Barth. The Red Army liberated the camp on May 2, 1945.

==Undercover agent==
After the war, Barker returned to Cuba and joined the secret police under Fulgencio Batista. He was later recruited by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and worked for them as an undercover agent. He also did work for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He joined the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion.

==Joins White House plumbers==
In September 1971, his former CIA superior, E. Howard Hunt, recruited him for the &quot;Plumbers&quot;, the Nixon White House&#x27;s &quot;Special Investigations Unit&quot;. He was recruited by Hunt to find background information on Daniel Ellsberg. Ellsberg was under watch for leaking the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;, a series of articles featured in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1971 detailing U.S. government secrets concerning the Vietnam War&#x27;s history. Along with Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy, Barker broke into the office of Ellsberg&#x27;s psychiatrist, Dr. Lewis J. Fielding, in Los Angeles. The mission&#x27;s purpose was to find discrediting information on Ellsberg. The mission was completed, but largely unsuccessful in finding any damaging information about Ellsberg.

In 1972, Barker was one of the five burglars paid by the Committee to Re-elect the President (CRP), Nixon&#x27;s re-election campaign fundraising committee, for a break-in at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, and subsequently was convicted in the Watergate scandal. The others were Frank Sturgis, Virgilio Gonzalez, Eugenio Martinez and James McCord. Along with the other Watergate burglars, G. Gordon Liddy, and E. Howard Hunt, Barker was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, wiretapping, planting electronic surveillance equipment, and theft of documents. Hunt claimed that Barker gave testimony, corroborating his assertion to the Senate Watergate Committee, that the reason they broke in was they were told by Liddy to search for evidence of clandestine financial contributions being received from foreign powers, such as Cuba.

Barker also worked with CRP to get money which went into the Nixon campaign coffers off the books; it was via his bank account that $25,000 from Archer Daniels Midland Chief Executive Dwayne Andreas was obtained by CRP in violation of campaign finance laws.

On March 7, 1974, Barker, along with Ehrlichman, Charles Colson, Liddy, Martinez, and Felipe de Diego, was indicted for the Ellsberg burglary. Barker was released pending appeal after serving one year of a two-and-a-half to six-year sentence.

==Later life and death==
After Barker&#x27;s release from prison, he worked as a building inspector for the city of Miami, Florida, earning $18,512 per year. He chose early retirement in 1982 rather than fight proceedings seeking his dismissal for loafing on the job.

President Jimmy Carter denied him a pardon.

Barker died of lung cancer in his Miami home on June 5, 2009, aged 92. His fourth wife, Dora Maria Barker, survived him.

Barker was portrayed in &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, the 1976 film retelling the events of the Watergate scandal, by Henry Calvert.

<doc id="659458" wikidata="Q1232528" url="?curid=659458" title="Percheron">
<text>The Percheron is a breed of draft horse that originated in the Huisne river valley in western France, part of the former Perche province, from which the breed takes its name. Usually gray or black in color, Percherons are well-muscled, and known for their intelligence and willingness to work. Although their exact origins are unknown, the ancestors of the breed were present in the valley by the 17th century. They are believed to descend from war horses. Over time, they began to be used for pulling stagecoaches; and later, for agriculture and hauling heavy goods. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Arabian blood was added to the breed. Exports of Percherons from France rose exponentially in the late 19th century, and the first purely Percheron stud book was created in France in 1893.

Before World War I, thousands of Percherons were shipped from France to the United States, but after the war began, an embargo stopped shipping. The breed was used extensively in Europe during the war, with some horses being shipped from the United States back to France to help in the war effort. Beginning in 1918, Percherons began to be bred in the United Kingdom; in 1918, the British Percheron Horse Society (BPHS) was formed. After a series of name and studbook ownership changes, the current United States Percheron registry was created in 1934. In the 1930s, Percherons accounted for 70% of the draft horse population in the United States, but their numbers declined substantially after . However, the population began to recover; and, as of 2009, around 2,500 Percheron horses were registered annually in the United States alone. 

The breed is still used extensively for draft work; in France, they are also bred for horse meat. They have been crossed with several light horse breeds to produce both stock horses and sport horses. Purebred Percherons are used for forestry work and pulling carriages, as well as work under saddle, including competition in various English riding disciplines, including show jumping.

== Characteristics ==


Percherons are generally gray or black in coloring. The head has a straight profile, broad forehead, large eyes and long thin ears. The chest is deep and wide and the croup long and level. The legs are heavily muscled, and the lower legs have little or no feathering. Enthusiasts describe the temperament as alert, and members of the breed are considered intelligent, willing workers with good dispositions, and easy keepers. In the 19th century, they were known to travel up to a day at a trot.

The size considered ideal for the Percheron varies between countries. In France, height ranges from and weight from . Percherons in the United States generally stand between , with a range of . American Percherons average , and their top weight is around . In Great Britain, is the shortest acceptable height for stallions and for mares, while weights range from around for stallions and for mares. 

Horses in the French registry are branded on the neck with the intertwined letters &quot;SP&quot;, the initials of the &quot;Société Hippique Percheronne&quot;.

== History ==
The Percheron breed originated in the Huisne river valley in France, which arises in Orne, part of the former Perche province, from which the breed gets its name. Several theories have been put forth as to the ancestry of the breed, though its exact origins are unknown. One source of foundation bloodstock may have been mares captured by from the Bretons some time after 496 AD. Another may have been Barb horse cavalry stallions brought from Spain by Moors in the 8th century. The Moorish were defeated at the Battle of Poitiers in 732 AD, and some of their horses may have been taken by warriors from Perche. A final theory posits that the Percheron and the Boulonnais breed are closely related, and that the Boulonnais influenced the Percheron when they were brought to Brittany as reinforcements for the legions of Caesar. It is known that during the 8th century, Barb stallions were crossed with mares native to the area, and more Oriental horse blood was introduced by the Comte du Perche upon his return from the Crusades and expeditions into territory claimed by Spain. Further blood from Spanish breeds was added when Rotrou III imported horses from Castile. No matter the theory of origin, breed historians agree that the terrain and climate of the Perche area had the greatest influence on the development of the breed. A possible reference to the horse is made in the 13th-century romance &quot;Guillaume de Dole&quot;, in which the title character asks for &quot;the Count of Perche&#x27;s horse&quot; to be made ready, possibly indicating the &quot;&#x27;great horse,&#x27; which could accommodate an armored knight&quot; and was bred in the geographical setting of the poem.

During the 17th century, horses from Perche, ancestors of the current Percheron, were smaller, standing between high, and more agile. These horses were almost uniformly gray; paintings and drawings from the Middle Ages generally show French knights on mounts of this color. After the days of the armored knight, the emphasis in horse breeding was shifted so as to develop horses better able to pull heavy stage coaches at a fast trot. Gray horses were preferred because their light coloring was more visible at night. This new type of horse was called the &quot;Diligence Horse&quot;, because the stage coaches they pulled were named &quot;diligences&quot;. After the stage coach was replaced by rail, the modern Percheron type arose as a slightly heavier horse for use in agriculture and heavy hauling work, moving goods from docks to railway terminals.

=== 19th century ===

Arabian stallions were made available to Percheron breeders for use in breeding army mounts, beginning in 1760 at the royal stud at Le Pin. Between 1789 and the early 1800s, the Percheron was in danger of becoming extinct as horse breeding was suppressed during the French Revolution and its aftermath. Early histories of the breed point to two gray Arabian stallions from Le Pin, Godolphin and Gallipoly, as the blood that helped to restart Percheron breeding. However, later research found that Godolphin was a chestnut Arabian of ordinary conformation and no special worth, while Gallipoly was a gray saddle horse of unknown breeding. Modern breed historians contest that there was enough breeding stock left after the early 19th century to restart the breed without further Arabian influence, and state that it is unlikely that two horses of unremarkable breeding and conformation had a significant influence on the breed. Jean le Blanc, a founding stallion of the Percheron breed, was foaled in 1823. Today, all Percherons trace their ancestry to this stallion. At this time the breed also became larger, with horses from other French districts being imported to Perche to change the Percheron from a coach horse averaging to a draft horse averaging . The Percheron stud book was created in France in 1893. By 1910, French registrations had risen to almost 32,000 horses. Between 1880 and 1920, Percheron breeders in France exported horses all over the world, including South Africa, South America, Australia and North America.

==== In the United States and Great Britain ====
Percherons were first imported into the United States in 1839 by Edward Harris II of Moorestown, New Jersey. Only one of the initial four horses survived the ocean trip. Soon after, two stallions and two mares were imported; one mare died shortly after arrival and one stallion went blind and was retired within a year. Although the first importations of Percherons were less than successful, the remaining stallion owned by Edward Harris II, named Diligence, was credited with siring almost 400 foals. In 1851, three stallions were imported: , Louis and Gray Billy. Throughout their stud careers, each had significant influence on American draft horse stock. In the mid-19th century in the United States, Percheron stallions were crossed with homebred mares to improve the local stock, resulting in thousands of crossbred horses. After the American Civil War in the 1860s greatly reduced the number of horses, there was a significant need for large draft horses, especially in growing cities and in the expanding West. Large numbers of Percherons were imported to the United States beginning in the early 1870s, and they became popular with draft horse breeders and owners. In the 1880s, approximately 7,500 horses were exported to the United States. This extensive importation lasted until 1893, when the US experienced a financial panic, and virtually no Percheron imports occurred between 1894 and 1898. In addition, many existing horses were lost as people were too poor to purchase or care for large draft horses. In 1898, importations began again as abruptly as they had ceased, with an average of 700 horses a year imported between 1898 and 1905. In 1906 alone, over 13,000 horses were imported to the United States from France. In the American traveling circuses of the late 19th century and early 20th century, the Percheron was the most frequently seen draft horse. Drivers appreciated the breed&#x27;s agility, stamina and quick-footed gait.

In 1876, the Norman-Percheron Association was formed by a group of Percheron breeders in Chicago, and at the same time the stud book was begun. The Norman-Percheron Association was the United States&#x27; first purebred livestock association. In 1877, the word &quot;Norman&quot; was dropped from the name. Later, in the panic of 1893, the Percheron Association went bankrupt and ceased to function. In 1905, also in Chicago, Percheron breeders met again to reform as the Percheron Society of America. Since 1934, the group has been known as the Percheron Horse Association of America. At its height, the organization was the largest draft horse association in the world, in the early 20th century registering over 10,000 horses annually.

In the late 19th century, Percherons also began to be exported from the United States to Great Britain, where they were used to pull horse-drawn buses in large cities. The first Percherons imported to Britain included some of the thousands of crossbreds from the United States. In Britain, many of the horses, once they finished their bus-pulling career, were sold to farmers. Other imported horses were sold to the British Army, and in 1900, 325 horses were shipped to South Africa for use in the Boer War.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
In 1911, the French society restricted registration to horses with both parents already registered with the society. In the early 20th century, the Percheron was one of the four major draft horse breeds, along with the Belgian, the Clydesdale and the Shire. Breeders could sell their horses for significant amounts of money, especially in the United States and Canada, where breeding stock brought a premium price.

Prior to , a flourishing trade route for Percherons existed between Nogent-le-Rotrou, Le Havre and the United States. However, after the war began, an embargo was placed on French Percherons, disallowing them from exportation. Other than an exception in April 1916 to allow 59 horses to be shipped from France to the US, this embargo remained in place until the end of the war. The war took its toll on the Percheron breed as horses, fodder, and handlers were requisitioned for the fighting, and even after the embargo was lifted France did not have the quality or quantity of stock to fulfill the needs of American breeders. The embargo created a breeding boom in the US, replacing the previous practice of importing the majority of Percherons from France, and late in the war horses were shipped the other way – from the US to Europe – to supply those needed in the war. The lack of feathering on the Percheron&#x27;s lower legs made them easier to care for in the mud that they often worked in during wartime. Their quick trot on paved roads made them more versatile than motorized vehicles, and they were useful for work with guns and in forward units due to their calm temperaments.

Between 1918 and 1922, over 350 Percherons were imported to Britain from France and, combined with stock from the US and Canada, were used as breeding stock to establish the breed in the country. In 1918, the British Percheron Horse Society was formed. British breeders and owners continue to import Percherons from France, and also occasionally from Canada, when not prohibitively expensive.

By the 1930s, Percherons accounted for over 70 percent of the purebred draft horses in the United States, and all of the major land-grant universities maintained stables of Percherons. A 1930 census of horses found over 33,000 Percherons in the United States, with the next most popular breed, the Belgian, having a population of less than 10,000. One Percheron historian attributes this popularity to the breed&#x27;s &quot;strength, energy, activity, robustness and endurance&quot;. After , increasing mechanization prompted a decline in the Percheron population. In 1954, only 85 Percherons were registered in the US, a record low. The 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s were bad years for the US Percheron population, and breeding was reduced to only a few farms. These breeders kept the American population alive through these years, however, and the 1980s saw renewed interest in the breed.

In 1966, the French stud book was changed to include draft types from other areas of France that were closely related to the Percheron—including the horses of Berrichon, Nivernais, Marne, Augeron, Bourbonnais, Loire and Saône-et-Loire. French Percherons were also hit hard by the advent of mechanization, and between 1970 and 1990 focus was placed on breeding horses of greater mass for the meat market. The largest and heaviest stallions were selected for breeding. Beginning at the 1989 World Percheron Congress, French breeders realized that they needed a lighter breed for tourism, export to Japan for draft work, and other markets. In 1993, a trend of importing American stallions to France was started with the black stallion Silver Shadows Sheik. This stallion and others were used to create a more elegant, smaller and sleeker look in the French Percheron, while still retaining the traditional bone and foot structure. All the imported stallions were black, reviving the popularity of black Percherons in France. French breeders continue to import American-bred Percheron stallions in order to produce lighter foals, moving away from the heavier meat-type horses of the late 20th century. Also in 1993, the Société Hippique Percheronne anticipated the increasing tourist and exportation markets by prohibiting docking, which was not prohibited for other draft breeds until 1996. This was partly at the request of the Germans, and partly due to the influence of magazines such as &quot;Cheval&quot;.

In 1988, there were 1,088 Percherons in the United States, rising to 2,257 by 1998. As of 2009, the Percheron Horse Association of America had horses registered in all 50 states, and had nearly 3,000 members, with around 2,500 new horses being registered annually. The French &quot;Société Hippique Percheronne de France&quot; (Percheron Horse Society of France) registered between 750 and 885 horses in each year between 2007 and 2010.

=== Augeron ===
The Augeron, also known as Caen or Virois, was developed from the Percheron during the 19th century and was merged back into the Percheron in the 1960s. Bred mainly in the Pays d&#x27;Auge region, it previously had its own studbook, registered by the &quot;Société hippique du trait augeron&quot;. The status of the subtype has been repeatedly debated because of its origin from Percherons bred in Pays d&#x27;Auge, a breeding group that was modified from the original breed standard due to the influence of soil and climate over the years, creating the Augeron type. Augerons are light gray in color, tall, strong, well-built, and energetic. They stand in height, but those horses bred in Vire are known to be smaller than the standard.

In the 19th century, the existence of the Augeron population was, despite its popularity, generally ignored by authors. In Paris, they were named &quot;Caen&quot; and &quot;Virois&quot;, after their region of origin, although specialists included the &quot;Caen Virois&quot; breed with the Augeron in a 1904 text. In the 19th century, these horses were sold at fairs in Argences and Bayeux in Lower Normandy. They were noticed several times for their homogeneity, beauty, and high value. In 1858, Augerons were sold for between 600 and 1200 francs.

The &quot;Société hippique du trait augeron&quot;, or Augeron Horse Society, was formed in 1913 by breeders in Auge to record these horses in a breed registry. One reason for this lay in the desire to protect the cradle of breeding Percheron horses: only animals born near the Perche were entitled to registration in the studbook, and hence to use the name of &quot;Percheron&quot;. This limitation excluded several nearby populations of horses foaled outside of Perche, such as the &quot;Maine&quot; and the Augeron.

== Uses ==


The Percheron is the most famous and populous of all French draft breeds in the world today. They were used to improve both the Ardennes and Vladimir Heavy Draft horses, and to create the Spanish-Norman breed, a cross between the Andalusian and the Percheron. By the end of the 19th century, Percherons made up the majority of driving horses in Paris. The Percheron is still used extensively for draft work and, like other draft breeds, it is also used in France for meat production. Around the world, Percherons are used for parades, sleigh rides and hayrides, as well as being used to pull carriages in large cities. The largest team of working Percherons in Europe is found at Disneyland Paris, where the breed makes up 30 percent of the horses in the park and the horses work to pull trams on the main park street. One of the most famous horse teams in the United States is the Heinz hitch of Percherons, having appeared multiple times at the Tournament of Roses Parade.

In Great Britain, the Percheron is used for advertising and publicity, as well as forestry and farm work. They are crossbred with lighter horses by breeders of heavy hunters in order to increase size and improve disposition. Purebred Percherons are also ridden, and some have proven useful at show jumping. Crossbred Percherons have been used successfully in dressage. In both the Falkland Islands and northern Australia, Percherons have been crossed with local mares, primarily Criollos in the Falklands, to produce larger stock horses with greater stamina. These crossbred horses are used extensively in both the sub-Antarctic climate of the Falklands and the sub-tropical climate of Australia for working stock. In Australia they are also crossed with Thoroughbreds for use as mounted police horses.

In 1978, the first World Percheron Congress was held in Great Britain, and has been held annually ever since. Although the majority of the shows have been held in North America, four – in 1980, 1989, 2001 and 2011 – have been held in France. Each year, in July, the French national breed show is held in Haras du Pin.

Since the early 2000&#x27;s the United States Army&#x27;s Fort Sam Houston Caisson and Funeral Honors Platoon have used Percherons for pulling the casket-bearing military caisson during funeral details. As of 2019, the Fort Sam Houston Caisson Platoon had 11 working Percherons and one lighter horse used as the riderless horse in a funeral procession. In addition to funeral details, which they perform year round, the Caisson Percherons are routinely featured at the San Antonio Stock Show &amp; Rodeo and other United States Army recruiting events in the south Texas area.

<doc id="659479" wikidata="Q516725" url="?curid=659479" title="Suisei (spacecraft)">
<text>, originally known as Planet-A, was an uncrewed space probe developed by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (now part of the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA).

It constituted a part of the Halley Armada together with &quot;Sakigake&quot;, the Soviet Vega probes, the ESA &quot;Giotto&quot; and the NASA International Cometary Explorer, to explore Halley&#x27;s Comet during its 1986 sojourn through the inner Solar System.

==Spacecraft==
&quot;Suisei&quot; was identical in construction and shape to &quot;Sakigake&quot;, but carried a different payload: a CCD UV imaging system and a solar wind instrument.

The main objective of the mission was to take UV images of the hydrogen corona for about 30 days before and after Comet Halley&#x27;s descending crossing of the ecliptic plane. Solar wind parameters were measured for a much longer time period.

The spacecraft is spin-stabilized at two different rates (5 and 0.2 rpm). Hydrazine thrusters are used for attitude and velocity control; star and Sun sensors are for attitude control; and a mechanically despun off-set parabolic dish is used for long range communication.

==Launch==
&quot;Suisei&quot; was launched on August 18, 1985 by M-3SII launch vehicle from Kagoshima Space Center on M-3SII-2 mission. It was sent on an intercept course with Comet Halley, after which it would remain in a heliocentric orbit for later use as long as it was viable.

==Halley encounter==
&quot;Suisei&quot; began UV observations in November 1985, generating up to six images/day.

The spacecraft encountered Comet Halley at 151,000 km on sunward side during March 8, 1986, suffering only two dust impacts.

==Earth flyby==
Fifteen burns of &quot;Suisei&quot;″s 3 N motors during the period of April 5–10, 1987, yielded a 65 m/s velocity increase for a 60,000 km Earth gravity assist swingby on August 20, 1992, although the craft was then lost behind the Sun for the summer.

The hydrazine fuel was depleted on February 22, 1991. Preliminary tracking indicated a 900,000-km flyby had been achieved.

==Other planned encounters==
ISAS had decided during 1987 to guide &quot;Suisei&quot; to a November 24, 1998, encounter with 21P/Giacobini-Zinner, but due to depletion of the hydrazine, this, as well as plans to fly within several million kilometers of Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle on February 28, 1998, were cancelled.

<doc id="659488" wikidata="Q842813" url="?curid=659488" title="Snus">
<text>Snus (, ; ) is a Swedish tobacco product (in Scandinavia). It is consumed by placing a pouch of powdered tobacco leaves under the lip for nicotine to be absorbed through the oral mucosa. Snus, not to be confused with nicotine pouches, consists of ground up tobacco leaves, salt, an alkalizer (e.g. sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate) and (optionally) flavorings. The final product is sold as both loose tobacco, and in portions with the tobacco mixture contained in a small teabag-like pouch. 

The manufacturing process of snus differs from that of other oral tobacco products. Snus tobacco is heated and pasteurized rather than cured or fermented, resulting in a less harmful product which contains a lower concentration of TSNA carcinogens in comparison to other traditional tobacco products. Though research on the connection between snus and disease such as cancer is not conclusive, no associations between snus consumption and an increased risk of cancer have been found. 

The warning text &quot;causes cancer&quot; was removed from snus packaging in Sweden and other countries because current scientific evidence indicates that the cancer risk associated with snus is significantly lower than that of smoking. The shift in labeling aims to provide accurate information while still cautioning consumers about potential health concerns. 

Nicotine products in general have been linked to reproductive harms such as stillbirth, premature birth, and low birth weight. Conversely, non-tobacco-based nicotine pouches (also known as &quot;nic pouches&quot;) are classified as non-carcinogenic since nicotine itself is not a carcinogen. However, they are still harmful to cardiovascular health due to their nicotine content, and are associated with moderately higher risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and reproductive harms. The main causes for mortality from smoking including cardiovascular disease from the effects of smoke on vascular coagulation and blood vessel walls are not caused primarily by nicotine and hence not to be considered equal to the moderate cardiovascular health risks from nicotine pouches. The sale of tobacco-based snus is illegal in several countries, including Australia, New Zealand and all European Union (EU) countries except for Sweden. Non-tobacco nicotine pouches are presently not regulated at EU-level. It is the most common type of tobacco product in Sweden and Norway and is also available in Switzerland. Some European countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Estonia, allow the sale of non-tobacco-based snus. Snus is also available in the United States.

== Overview ==
Snus is made from air-dried/pasteurized tobaccos from various parts of the world. In earlier times, tobacco for making snus was laid out for drying in Scania and Mälardalen, Sweden. Later, Kentucky tobaccos were used. The ground tobacco is mixed with water, salt, an alkalizing agent such as Sodium Carbonate or Sodium Bicarbonate (E500), and aroma, and is prepared through heating under pressure. After the heating process, food grade aromas are typically added. In Sweden, snus is regulated as a food product and, for this reason, all ingredients are listed on the label of each individual package (can) of snus. Moist snus contains more than 50% water, and the average use of snus in Sweden is approximately 800 grams (16 units) per person each year. About 12% (1.1 million people) of the population in Sweden use snus. Unlike dipping tobacco and chew, most snus today does not undergo the fermentation process, but is instead steam-pasteurized. Pasteurization inhibits the growth of bacteria that facilitate the formation of tobacco-specific nitrosamines, while preserving the desired texture and mouthfeel of the snus. The absorption of nicotine, the desired primary alkaloid in tobacco, greatly depends on the nicotine content in the snus and the pH of the final product. A voluntary quality standard for snus products has been introduced (Gothiatek) that sets maximum levels for certain controversial constituents including nitrosamines, heavy metals, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Most manufacturers of Scandinavian type snus adhere to this standard.

Snus is sold in containers of various sizes, originally made of porcelain, wood, silver, or gold. Portioned snus usually comes in plastic tins of 20 to 24 portions, containing about 0.75 to 1 gram of snus each, while loose snus is mostly sold in wax coated cardboard containers with plastic lids (similar to dip snuff), at 42 g (50 g before 2008). Mini-portion and medium-portion snus are increasingly popular formats. Most of these products come in tins containing 20 portions, of either 0.65 or 0.5 grams each for a total of just under 13 or 10 grams, particularly with those for whom concealing their use of smokeless tobacco in places is of utmost importance.

Snus is available in two main types:
*Loose snus () is a moist powder that can be shaped into a cylindrical or spherical form using the fingertips or a specialized cylindrical device. This final product is commonly known as a (), , , or (slang). Some individuals, particularly long-time users, opt to simply pinch the tobacco and place it under their upper lip (known as a farmer&#x27;s pinch or living snus). However, the popularity of loose snus has gradually been overtaken by portioned alternatives. Nowadays, many snus users appreciate the discreet nature of these pre-portioned varieties.
*Portion snus () is a convenient and discreet form of snus that comes in small teabag-like sachets filled with moist powder. It is available in smaller quantities compared to loose powder snus. There are two varieties of portion snus:
** Original portion: This traditional form was introduced in 1973. The sachet material is moisturized during manufacturing, resulting in a brown, moist pouch.
** White portion: This form has a milder taste and slightly slower release. The sachet material is not moisturized during manufacturing, resulting in a white, dry pouch. The tobacco within the portion material has the same moisture content as original portion snus, but the nicotine and flavor are delivered somewhat slower due to the drier sachet. Notably, &quot;white portion&quot; refers to the style, not the color. Some white portion snus use a black material instead of white, yet are still considered &quot;white portion&quot;. Examples of such snus include General Onyx, Grovsnus Svart (Black), and Blue Ocean (Blue).
** The Stingfree portion is a patented pouch for snus and modern oral nicotine pouches, approved in the US and Europe. It features a protective side that effectively reduces the burning sensation and irritation on the user&#x27;s gum and oral mucosa. 

Portioned snus comes in three sizes: mini, normal/large, and maxi. The weights vary, but most packages disclose the net weight. Mini portions weigh around 0.5 g, normal portions weigh 0.8 to 1 g, and maxi portions weigh up to 1.7 g. Some brands offer regular and long versions of the normal size sachet.

The nicotine content varies among brands, with the most common strength being 8 mg per gram of tobacco. Stark and extra stark varieties have higher nicotine content, with stark varieties containing 11–14 mg and extra stark varieties containing up to 22 mg. Siberia brand has an &quot;Extremely Strong&quot; snus with 43 mg of nicotine per gram of tobacco, the highest available.

=== Usage ===
Snus is typically used by being placed under the upper lip. This is true for both loose snus and portion snus. The pris (pressed pellet of loose snus) or pouch is typically left in place for anywhere between 30 and 120 minutes. No spitting is required, but some (especially new users) may prefer to. 

Snus is not cured, so it can spoil much faster than cured tobacco. While tobacco-based snus is typically refrigerated for short term storage (up to a few months), it is typically frozen for longer term storage of a year or more. It can stay unrefrigerated for a week or more without spoilage. Some tobacco-based snus products are shipped very dry, so they have extended shelf life without needing any refrigeration. This makes them slower to initially &quot;drip&quot;, as there is no appreciable moisture in the packet.

===Differences to other oral tobacco products===
Some forms of tobacco consumed in the mouth may be categorized as:
;Swedish snus: A moist form of smokeless tobacco which is usually placed under the upper lip, and which does not result in the need for spitting. It is sold either as a moist powder known as loose snus, or packaged into pouches known as portion snus. Snus is often mildly flavored with food-grade smoke aroma, bergamot, citrus, juniper berry, herbs and/or floral flavors. Most Scandinavian snus is produced in Sweden and regulated as food under the Swedish Food Act.
;American snus: Available since the late 1990s, this is similar to the Scandinavian form, but usually has a lower moisture content and lower pH, resulting in lower bioavailability of nicotine than Scandinavian varieties, meaning less is available for absorption. American snus is often flavored, e.g., with spearmint, wintergreen, vanilla or fruit (e.g. cherry), and may contain sugar.
;Nasal snuff: Mostly English, German, and Scandinavian, this is referred to as in Swedish and in Norwegian, and as &quot;Scotch snuff&quot; in the US, is a dry, powdered form of snuff. It is insufflated – &quot;sniffed&quot; but not deeply &quot;snorted&quot; – through the nose. It is often mentholated or otherwise scented. 
;Chewing tobacco: North American and European product, also known as &quot;chew&quot; (or in some Southern US dialects as &quot;chaw&quot; or &quot;dip&quot;). It is tobacco in the form of short or long, loose leaf and stem strands (like pipe tobacco or longer), or less commonly of chopped leaves and stems compressed into blocks called plugs, or even finely ground pieces compressed into pellets. A few brands are cut into much finer loose strands, like cigarette rolling tobacco. Chew is placed between the cheek and the gums, or actively chewed. It causes copious salivation, especially when chewed, and due to its irritant (even nauseating) effect on the esophagus, this &quot;juice&quot; usually requires spitting. Chewing tobacco is a long-established North American form of tobacco (derived from traditional use of raw tobacco leaf by Indigenous peoples of the Americas), and is also legal in the European Union. Chewing tobacco is sometimes flavored, e.g. with wintergreen, apple, or cherry.
;Dipping tobacco: Also known as dip, spit tobacco or, ambiguously, as moist snuff, this is a common American form of tobacco. It is moist, and somewhat finely ground, but less so than snus. Dipping tobacco (so called because users dip their fingers into the package to pinch a portion to insert into the mouth) is placed between the lower lip or cheek and the gums; it is not used nasally. As with chewing tobacco, salivation is copious, and usually spat out. Dipping tobacco is usually flavored, traditionally with wintergreen or mint, though many other flavorings are now available, while some unflavored brands remain popular. Beginning in the mid-1980s, several brands have packaged American dipping tobacco in porous pouches like those used for many brands of Scandinavian and American snus.
;Chema: This Algerian product is a moist tobacco similar to Scandinavian snus in many respects. Outside of Algeria, it is most widely known as &quot;Makla&quot;, a name that originates from the Algerian brand &quot;Makla El Hilal&quot;, which first produced this type of smokeless tobacco during the French colonization. It is placed in the upper lip in a manner similar to snus; it differs in that it is more finely ground and has an even higher nicotine content and pH level. Sales within the European Union are legal due to its classification as a chewing tobacco. Its safety in comparison to snus has not been studied sufficiently.
;Naswar: A central Asian product which is a moist, powdered form of tobacco, often green and sometimes caked with the mineral lime and/or wood ash. It is used like dipping tobacco or put under the tongue, and is pungent and often heavily flavored, e.g. with culinary oils (cardamom, sesame), the fruit lime, menthol, etc.

Snus, dry snuff, and dipping tobacco are distinct products that some English speaking people may refer to as &quot;snuff&quot; but are all processed and used in very different ways, each with their own sets of risks.

=== Health risks ===
Various national and international health organizations stated that using snus is addictive, represents a health risk, has no safe level use, and is not a safe substitute for smoking. Using snus can cause a number of adverse health effects such as esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, cardiovascular disease and stroke. Snus can also cause adverse reproductive effects including stillbirth, premature birth, low birth weight. Nicotine in snus products that are used during pregnancy can affect how a baby&#x27;s brain develops in the womb.

Quitting snus use is as challenging as smoking cessation. There is no scientific evidence that using snus can help a person quit smoking, although widespread snus-usage is correlated with lower rates of smoking. 

==History==
Snus has a long history of use, reaching back to the 16th century and concentrated in Sweden. Its origin lies in an invention by Jean Nicot (1530–1600), a French diplomat residing in Portugal who cultivated tobacco in his garden, and was one of the pioneers in recognizing the medicinal properties of tobacco. Nicot is also the originor of the word nicotine. Nicot meticulously dried and ground the tobacco leaves into a fine powder, which could be inhaled as snuff. He presented this powder to Catherine de’ Medici (1519–1589), the Queen of France, in an effort to alleviate her migraines. The use of snuff quickly gained popularity among the French court and the upper-class citizens, becoming a fashionable trend. By the early 17th century, the practice of using nasal snuff had also spread to Sweden. 

Tobacco use became so prevalent in Sweden that in 1724, King Fredrik I issued a decree mandating that Swedes cultivate their own tobacco. Consequently, farmers and homesteaders started grinding their own locally grown tobacco. 

Due to manual laborers typically working outside where frequent use of a dry, finely ground nasal snuff is not convenient, they opted to crush their tobaccos into a paste-like consistency and allowed it to ferment in jars for several weeks. The final product was then portioned and placed under the lip for extended periods of time, eventually gaining popularity as snus.

Ettan is the still extant snus brand, which dates to 1822. Its founder, Jakob Fredrik Ljunglöf, introduced pasteurization into snus making, reducing production time by several weeks and preventing microbial contamination. In the years that followed, numerous manufacturers further improved of snus manufacturing, leading to the flourishing of many brands. Several of these brands from that era continue to exist.

In 1914, the Swedish parliament made the decision to nationalize the entire tobacco industry. This led to the transformation of numerous tobacco companies into the state-owned monopoly known as AB Svenska Tobakmonopolet. As a result, the number of available tobacco products decreased significantly from approximately four hundred local brands to just seventeen, although these were now distributed nationwide. Consequently, employment within the industry experienced a fifty percent decline. In the 1960s, Sweden decided to abolish the import and sales monopoly on tobacco. AB Svenska Tobaksmonopolet later merged with the match manufacturer Swedish Match and was listed on the stock market in 1996.

<text>Craiglockhart Hydropathic, now a part of Edinburgh Napier University and known as Craiglockhart Campus, is a building with surrounding grounds in Craiglockhart, Edinburgh, Scotland. As part of a large extension programme by the university in the early 2000s the original building and surrounding campus underwent significant restoration and modernisation; as a result, many of the original interior features of the building are no longer visible. The exterior of the building has been preserved. 

==Origins==
The estate in which the Hydropathic&#x27;s building lies was sold in 1773 to Alexander Monro, who was second of three generations to be Professor of Anatomy at the University of Edinburgh. It stayed in the Monro family for more than a hundred years.

==The Hydropathic and the War Hospital==
In 1877, the estate became the property of the Craiglockhart Hydropathic Company, who set about building a hydropathic institute. The Hydropathic was built in the Italian style by Architects Peddie &amp; Kinnear. Craiglockhart remained as a hydropathic, until the advent of the First World War. Between 1916 and 1919 the building was used as a military psychiatric hospital for the treatment of shell-shocked officers.

Probably the most famous patients of Craiglockhart were the poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, whose poems appeared in the hospital&#x27;s own magazine called &quot;The Hydra&quot;. Wilfred Owen was the editor of the magazine during his stay. Siegfried Sassoon was sent to Craiglockhart, as a response to his &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Declaration&quot;, an anti-war letter. He later wrote about his experiences at the hospital in his semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;Sherston&#x27;s Progress&quot;. There is now an area within the building that celebrates the life and work of both Sassoon and Owen and their meeting at Craiglockhart.

The best known of the doctors assigned there was W. H. R. Rivers. The Hospital featured in the 1991 book &quot;Regeneration&quot; by Pat Barker, and the 1997 film adaptation by the same name, in which the institution was known as Craiglockhart War Hospital.

==Later uses==
The building then became a convent for the Society of the Sacred Heart, before serving as a Catholic teacher training college. It then passed to the then Napier College, and was used by that institution and its successor, Napier Polytechnic; thus it is now part of Edinburgh Napier University. Much of the old building has been retained, and an extensive new wing has been built behind it to house the Business School.

Unwin started his career at the publishing firm of his step-uncle Thomas Fisher Unwin. In 1914, Stanley Unwin purchased a controlling interest in the firm George Allen and Sons, and established George Allen &amp; Unwin, later to become Allen and Unwin.

The company found success publishing authors such as Bertrand Russell, Sidney Webb, R. H. Tawney and Mahatma Gandhi.

In the 1930s, Unwin published two bestsellers by Lancelot Hogben: &quot;Mathematics for the Million&quot; and &quot;Science for the Citizen&quot;.

In 1936, J. R. R. Tolkien submitted &quot;The Hobbit&quot; for publication and Unwin paid his ten-year-old son Rayner Unwin a shilling to write a report on the manuscript. Rayner&#x27;s favourable response prompted Unwin to publish the book. Once the book became a success, Unwin asked Tolkien for a sequel, which eventually became the bestselling &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Tolkien had wanted to publish &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, but it was turned down for being &quot;too Celtic&quot;; it was finally published after his death by Allen &amp; Unwin in 1977.

In 1950, Unwin published another bestseller, Thor Heyerdahl&#x27;s &quot;The Kon-Tiki Expedition&quot;.

During his career Unwin was active in book trade organs such as the Publishers Association, the International Publishers Association and the British Council.

==Personal life==
Stanley Unwin was born on 19 December 1884 at 13 Handen Road, Lee, Lewisham, south-east London. His father was Edward Unwin (1840–1933) and his mother was Elizabeth Unwin (née Spicer). Edward Unwin was a printer whose father, Jacob Unwin, was the founder of the printing firm Unwin Brothers.

The publisher Thomas Fisher Unwin was his father&#x27;s youngest stepbrother, therefore Stanley Unwin&#x27;s step-uncle. The children&#x27;s author Ursula Moray Williams was his niece.

Unwin was a lifelong pacifist, and during the First World War, as a conscientious objector, he joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD).

Unwin died on 13 October 1968 and was honoured with a blue plaque at his birthplace.

<doc id="659505" wikidata="Q7462747" url="?curid=659505" title="Shaker scoop">
<text>A shaker scoop (sometimes called a shaker hood scoop or a shaker hood) is an automobile term for an air intake for combustion air that is mounted directly on top of the engine&#x27;s air cleaner and protrudes through a hole in the hood. Since it is fastened directly to the engine, it moves with the engine&#x27;s movement and vibration on its mountings, thus the &#x27;shaker&#x27; name.

==Design==
Like all such scoops, its purpose is to increase performance by a &#x27;ram air&#x27; effect, taking advantage of the vehicle&#x27;s speed to deliver high pressure, cool air to the engine over a shorter, less restrictive flow path. However, because engines draw air in hundreds of cubic feet per minute, scoops do not raise intake pressures significantly. Additional claimed benefits of a shaker hood include elevation to prevent water from being drawn on flooded terrain, being a source of cooler, denser air, and having a more direct path to the engine&#x27;s throttle plate.

===Aftermarket===

Hot rod and drag race enthusiasts have modified automotive engines to increase power via supercharger forced induction since the 1920s; in some cases, a blower scoop is added to the top of the supercharger as an aid to air intake.

A vehicle also can be equipped with an aftermarket engine-mounted scoop that is mounted directly to the carburetor and protrudes through the hood, which is known as a carb scoop. Carb scoops are sometimes mistaken for blower scoops, but the presence (or lack) of a belt to drive the supercharger is one way to distinguish these scoops. Both carb and blower scoops are sometimes called bugcatchers. Like the shaker scoop, both a blower scoop and a carb scoop will vibrate in response to engine motions because they are attached to the engine.

Some aftermarket scoops include butterfly valves, which act as secondary throttle bodies.
===Factory-fitted===

Larry Shinoda of Ford is credited with introducing the shaker hood scoop as a factory-fitted option and campaigning to make it functional, first available exclusively for the 1969 model year Mustang equipped with the 428 Cobra Jet engine; the option was expanded to other Ford Mustang engines for 1970 and imitated quickly by competitors Chrysler (1970 Plymouth &#x27;cuda and Dodge Challenger) and Pontiac (1970 Firebird Trans Am, which used a backwards-facing scoop to draw air from the high-pressure area at the base of the windshield). Some official Chrysler literature referred to this popular hood style as the &quot;Incredible Quivering Exposed Cold Air Grabber&quot;. This lengthy title has since been shortened by enthusiasts and collectors to the less tongue-twisting &quot;shaker hood&quot;.

In the 2000s, factory-fitted shaker scoops were reintroduced with the 2003 Ford Mustang Mach 1 and 2014 Dodge Challenger (&quot;Shaker&quot; and &quot;Mopar&quot; models). The 2003–04 Mustang Mach 1 was equipped with a model-specific 32-valve 4.6 L V-8 engine, to fill the performance gap between the less-powerful Mustang GT and the flagship Mustang SVT Cobra. For the 2014 model year, Dodge announced the shaker scoop Challengers as limited-production models at the SEMA show in November 2013; shaker scoop availability was extended in 2015. The shaker package was available through the 2023 model year, when the Challenger was discontinued.
==Examples==

Such scoops were fitted to a variety of cars, including:
* 1969 Ford Mustang Cobra Jet
* 1970 Boss 302 Mustang
* 1970 Plymouth Barracuda
* Dodge Challenger
* Ford Torino
* Pontiac GTO
* Pontiac Firebird Trans Am
* Pontiac Can Am Grand Am
* Ford Falcon XY GT Phase III
* 2004 Ford Mustang Mach 1

<doc id="659506" wikidata="Q636670" url="?curid=659506" title="Battle of Peachtree Creek">
<text>The Battle of Peachtree Creek was fought in Georgia on July 20, 1864, as part of the Atlanta Campaign in the American Civil War. It was the first major attack by Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood since taking command of the Confederate Army of Tennessee. The attack was against Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman&#x27;s Union army, which was perched on the doorstep of Atlanta. The main armies in the conflict were the Union Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas and two corps of the Confederate Army of Tennessee.

==Background==

Sherman had launched his grand offensive against the Army of Tennessee in early May. For more than two months, Sherman&#x27;s forces, consisting of the Army of the Cumberland, the Army of the Tennessee and the Army of the Ohio, sparred with the Confederate Army of Tennessee, then under the command of General Joseph E. Johnston. Although the Southerners gained tactical successes at the Battle of New Hope Church, the Battle of Pickett&#x27;s Mill, and the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, they were unable to counter Sherman&#x27;s superior numbers. Gradually, the Union forces flanked the Confederates out of every defensive position they attempted to hold. On July 8, Union forces crossed the Chattahoochee River, the last major natural barrier between Sherman and Atlanta.

Retreating from Sherman&#x27;s advancing armies, General Johnston withdrew across Peachtree Creek, just north of Atlanta, and laid plans for an attack on part of the Army of the Cumberland as it crossed Peachtree Creek. On July 17, he received a telegram from Confederate President Jefferson Davis relieving him from command. The political leadership of the Confederacy was unhappy with Johnston&#x27;s lack of aggressiveness and replaced him with Hood. In contrast to Johnston&#x27;s conservative tactics and conservation of manpower, Hood had a reputation for aggressive tactics and personal bravery on the battlefield. In fact he had already been maimed in battle twice within the past year, having personally led several assaults. Hood formally took command on July 18 and launched the attempted counter-offensive.

It was not until July 19 that Hood learned of Sherman&#x27;s split armies advancing for a swift attack from multiple directions. Thomas&#x27;s Army of the Cumberland was to advance directly towards Atlanta, while the Army of the Ohio under the command of Major General John M. Schofield, and the Army of the Tennessee under the command of Major General James B. McPherson quickly moved several miles towards Decatur so as to advance from the northeast. This was apparently an early premonition of Sherman&#x27;s general strategy of cutting Confederate supply lines by destroying railroads to the east. Thomas would have to cross Peachtree Creek at several locations and would be vulnerable both while crossing and immediately after, before they could construct breastworks.

Hood hoped to attack Thomas while his Army of the Cumberland was still in the process of crossing Peachtree Creek. Hood also sent forth the corps under Alexander P. Stewart and William J. Hardee to meet Schofield and McPherson. By so doing, the Southerners could hope to fight with rough numerical parity and catch the Northern forces by surprise. Hood thus sought to drive Thomas west, further away from Schofield and McPherson. This would have forced Sherman to divert his forces away from Atlanta.

==Opposing forces==
===Union===
===Confederate===
==Battle==

Throughout the morning of July 20, the Army of the Cumberland crossed Peachtree Creek and began taking up defensive positions. The XIV Corps, commanded by Major General John M. Palmer, took position on the right. The XX Corps, commanded by Major General Joseph Hooker (the former commander of the Army of the Potomac who had lost the Battle of Chancellorsville) took position in the center. The left was held by a single division (John Newton&#x27;s) of the IV Corps, as the rest of that corps had been sent to reinforce Schofield and McPherson on the east side of Atlanta. The Union forces began preparing defensive positions, but had only partially completed them by the time the Confederate attack began.

The few hours between the Union crossing and their completion of defensive earthworks were a moment of opportunity for the Confederates. Hood committed two of his three corps to the attack: Hardee&#x27;s corps would attack on the right, while the corps of General Stewart would attack on the left as the corps of General Benjamin Cheatham would keep an eye on the Union forces to the east of Atlanta.

Hood had wanted the attack launched at one o&#x27;clock, but confusion and miscommunication between Hardee and Hood prevented this from happening. Hood instructed Hardee to ensure that his right flank maintained contact with Cheatham&#x27;s corps, but Cheatham began moving his forces slightly eastward. Hardee too began side-stepping to the east to maintain contact with Cheatham, while Stewart began sliding eastward as well in order to maintain contact with Hardee. It was not until three o&#x27;clock that this movement ceased.

The Confederate attack was finally mounted at around four o&#x27;clock in the afternoon. On the Confederate right, Hardee&#x27;s men ran into fierce opposition and were unable to make much headway, with the Southerners suffering heavy losses. The failure of the attack was largely due to faulty execution and a lack of pre-battle reconnaissance.

On the Confederate left, Stewart&#x27;s attack was more successful. Two Union brigades were forced to retreat, and most of the 33rd New Jersey Infantry Regiment (along with its battle flag) were captured by the Rebels, as was a 4-gun Union artillery battery. Union forces counterattacked and after a bloody struggle, successfully blunted the Confederate offensive. Artillery helped stop the Confederate attack on Thomas&#x27; left flank.

A few hours into the battle, Hardee was preparing to send in his reserve, the division of General Patrick Cleburne, which he hoped would get the attack moving again and allow him to break through the Union lines. An urgent message from Hood, however, forced him to cancel the attack and dispatch Cleburne to reinforce Cheatham, who was being threatened by a Union attack and in need of reinforcements.

The Union lines had bent but not broken under the weight of the Confederate attack, and by the end of the day the Rebels had failed to break through anywhere along the line. Hood withdrew into defenses of Atlanta the following day, 21 July. Estimated casualties were 4,250 in total: 1,750 on the Union side and at least 2,500 on the Confederate.

==Appraisal==
Many historians have criticized the Confederacy&#x27;s tactics and execution, especially Hood&#x27;s and Hardee&#x27;s. Johnston, although fighting defensively, had already determined to counterattack at Peachtree Creek; in fact, the plan for striking the Army of the Cumberland as it began to cross Peachtree Creek has been attributed to him. His long rear-guard retreat from the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain is understandable, as Sherman used his numerical superiority for constant large flanking movements. Although he had lost an enormous amount of ground, Johnston had whittled Sherman&#x27;s numerical superiority from 2:1 to 8:5.

Replacing him with the brash Hood, practically on the eve of battle, has generally been regarded as a mistake. Hood, as well as several other generals, sent a telegram to Davis seeking a remand of the order, advising Davis that it would be &quot;dangerous to change the commander of this army at this particular time&quot;. Although Hood&#x27;s general plan was plausible, the federal forces being divided, the failure of the units to be formed and positioned prior to the Union river crossing, Hardee&#x27;s failure to commit his troops fully and Hood&#x27;s decision to continue the attack, when he had discovered he had lost his advantage, resulted in a severe and predictable defeat.

==Medals of Honor==
Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Hapeman was awarded the Medal of Honor for &quot;extraordinary heroism on 20 July 1864, while serving with 104th Illinois Infantry, in action at Peach Tree Creek, Georgia. With conspicuous coolness and bravery Lieutenant Colonel Hapeman rallied his men under a severe attack, re-formed the broken ranks, and repulsed the attack.&quot;

First Lieutenant Frank D. Baldwin, Company D, 19th Michigan Infantry, was awarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry at the Battle of Peachtree Creek, Georgia, July 20, 1864. Under a galling fire moved ahead of his own men, and singly entered the enemy&#x27;s line, capturing and bringing back two commissioned officers, fully armed, besides a guidon of a Georgia regiment.

Private Denis Buckley was awarded the Medal of Honor for &quot;extraordinary heroism on 20 July 1864, while serving with Company G, 136th New York Infantry, in action at Peach Tree Creek, Georgia, for capture of flag of 31st Mississippi (Confederate States of America).&quot;

==Legacy==

The battlefield is now largely lost to urban development. Tanyard Creek Park occupies what was near the center of the battle and contains several memorial markers. Peachtree Battle Avenue commemorates the battle. All are located in the western part of Buckhead, the northern section of the city which was annexed in 1952. The play &quot;Peachtree Battle&quot; is a comedy about life in the upscale area.

==In popular culture==

* The plot of the alternate history novel &quot;Shattered Nation: An Alternate History Novel of the American Civil War&quot;, by Jeffrey Evan Brooks, centers around the Battle of Peachtree Creek. In the novel, the Army of Tennessee fights the battle with Johnston, rather than Hood, in command.
* It was discovered, on &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, that Matthew Broderick&#x27;s great, great-grandfather, Robert Martindale, was killed in this battle.

<text>North Atlantic Drift is the sixth studio album by British rock band Ocean Colour Scene.

==Background==
Martin &#x27;Max&#x27; Hayes and the band co-produced every song, except for &quot;For Every Corner&quot;, which was produced solely by the former. They were assisted by Tim Roe (who also did additional engineering on &quot;When Evil Comes&quot;), Darren, Nash, Darren Blackwell, and Tom Webster. Hayes and Pete Craigie mixed the recordings.

==Composition==
Musically, the sound of &quot;North Atlantic Drift&quot; has been described as blues rock. The opening track &quot;I Just Need Myself&quot; is done in the style of the Faces, with percussion from Steve White. &quot;Oh Collector&quot; features guitar contributions from Kevin Rowe. The title track is political commentary on American cultural imperialism and its support by the UK government, particularly the then impending US-led invasion of Iraq, which was opposed by the majority of the British public. The Paul Weller-like &quot;Golden Gate Bridge&quot; is followed by the Phil Spector-indebted &quot;Make the Deal&quot;, with a string arrangement from Sonia Slaney. Duncan Mackay, James Hunt and Nichol Tompson appear on &quot;On My Way&quot;, playing trumpet, saxophone and trombone, respectively; it is followed by the folk-esque &quot;Second Hand Car&quot;. &quot;She&#x27;s Been Writing&quot;, which also featured a string arrangement from Slaney, includes vocal contribution from Linda Thompson. Dalbir Singh Rattan plays tabla on &quot;When Evil Comes&quot;, which ends with an atmospheric coda.

==Release==
&quot;I Just Need Myself&quot; was released as a single on 30 June 2003. Two versions were released on CD: the first with &quot;Will You Take Her Love&quot; and &quot;Me, I&#x27;m Left Unsure&quot;, and the second with &quot;Questions&quot; and &quot;I Want to See the Bright Lights&quot;.

The US version was released on 19 August 2003, and contained four bonus tracks: &quot;Will You Take Her Love&quot;, &quot;Me, I&#x27;m Left Unsure&quot;, &quot;Questions&quot;, and &quot;I Want to See the Bright Lights&quot;. &quot;Make the Deal&quot; was released as a single on 25 August 2003. Two versions were released on CD: the first with &quot;Perfect Stranger&quot; and &quot;I Never Believed It Too&quot;, while the other included &quot;We Rise&quot; and &quot;St. Cecelia&quot;. The 7&quot; vinyl version featured a Caged Baby remix of &quot;I Just Need Myself&quot; as the B-side.

Bassist Damon Minchella left the band in late 2003. &quot;Golden Gate Bridge&quot; was released as a single on 29 December 2003. The CD version featured live versions of &quot;Get Away&quot; and &quot;The Riverboat Song&quot;, while the DVD version included videos of live versions of &quot;Golden Gate Bridge&quot;, &quot;Second Hand Car&quot;, and &quot;The Day We Caught the Train&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;North Atlantic Drift&quot; was met with mixed-to-negative reviews from music critics. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that &quot;only the faithful would care [about a new album from Ocean Colour Scene], which is too bad, because it&#x27;s the best record they&#x27;ve done in a long time.&quot; He said that while there was not any &quot;great progression in the sound&quot;, the production &quot;isn&#x27;t nearly as claustrophobic as it was on its predecessor&quot;. &quot;Gigwise&quot; contributor Jamie Bowman wrote that the &quot;riffs and harmonies are still as comfortably worn as a pair of old Gazelles [shoes]&quot;. He highlted &quot;I Just Need Myself&quot; as &quot;show[ing] any sign of exuberance,&quot; as the remainder of the album was &quot;a stodgy mixture of endlessly recycled homespun tunesmithery.&quot; No Ripcord writer Peter Mattinson referred to the album &quot;a disappointment [...] and one that will be leapt upon by a lot of people. It&#x27;s fair to say that in years to come, this [...] chapter in Ocean Colour Scene&#x27;s history will be fairly well overlooked.&quot; John Dugan of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found the band to &quot;still practices the same retro naturalism and love for soul and psychedelia, but amid the trad modness it gives increasing attention to breezy pop ditties and neo-folk melodies.&quot;

Entertainment.ie reviewer Andrew Lynch wrote that other than the album being on a new album, &quot;it&#x27;s business as usual: mid-paced blues-rock, turgid Dadrock arrangements and lyrics so vague as to be absolutely meaningless.&quot; &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; writer Adie Nunn complimented three of the songs, &quot;[b]ut that’s where the praise (!) starts and ends, as they’re straight back into their retro mod-pop ways after that.&quot; &quot;The List&quot; Carolyn Rae wrote that the album would be enjoyed by fans of their last album, &quot;otherwise don&#x27;t except anything new.&quot; She went on further to say that &quot;[m]ost bands grow and mature as their career develops but OCS are firmly stuck in the same groove.&quot; David Sinclair of &quot;The Times&quot; opened his review by calling it &quot;all a bit sad. [... Nothing] can disguise the dog-eared sound of a band well past its sell-by date.&quot; The staff at &quot;Uncut&quot; simply stated &quot;Ocean Colour Scene are inextricably linked to a mid-’90s era which now seems hideously pass&quot;.

The first track, &quot;I Just Need Myself&quot; reached #13 in the charts, though the other two singles did less well but still charted inside the top 40.

<text>The Groucho Club is a private members&#x27; club founded in 1985 and located on Dean Street in London&#x27;s Soho. Its members are mainly drawn from the publishing, media, entertainment and arts industries.

The club&#x27;s facilities include three bars, two restaurants, a snooker room, an enclosed terrace, 17 bedrooms for members or their guests and four event rooms, which are available for hire.

==History==
The club opened on 5 May 1985. Its name is reference to Groucho Marx saying he did not want to be a member of any club that would have him.

The club was owned by Graphite Capital from 2006 to 2015, when it was sold to a group of investors led by Isfield Investments and Alcuin Capital Partners. In 2022, the Groucho Club was purchased through Manuela and Iwan Wirth&#x27;s Art Farm, which owns a group of boutique hotels and restaurants, for £40 million ($48.9 million).

In March 2024, the club announced that it would be opening its inaugural branch outside of London at Bretton Hall near Wakefield in Yorkshire.

In November 2024, the club&#x27;s license was suspended by Westminster City Council as a result of a criminal investigation.

==Members==

Anyone who is proposed by two existing members may apply for membership, but applications are favoured from those working in the creative side of media and the arts.

Prominent members of the club have included Cara Delevingne, Nick Grimshaw, Harry Styles, Caroline Flack, Jarvis Cocker, Lily Allen, Melvyn Bragg, Stephen Fry, Noel Gallagher, Luke Pasqualino and Rachel Weisz.

==Art==
The club has a large collection of contemporary art, curated by Nicki Carter, a graduate of Goldsmiths, University of London during the YBA period, erstwhile waitress and now the longest serving employee.

==The Groucho Club Maverick Award==
Launched in 2010 as &#x27;the antidote to other awards&#x27;, The Groucho Club Maverick Award celebrates people who have broken the mould in their field by challenging and making a significant contribution to culture and the arts in the previous 12 months, either in the UK or internationally.

<doc id="659540" wikidata="Q4010248" url="?curid=659540" title="Verso Books">
<text>Verso Books (formerly New Left Books) is a left-wing publishing house based in London and New York City, founded in 1970 by the staff of &quot;New Left Review&quot; (NLR) and includes Tariq Ali and Perry Anderson on its board of directors. According to its website, it&#x27;s the largest independent, radical publishing house in the English-speaking world, publishing one hundred books a year. &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; called it &quot;Anglo-America&#x27;s preeminent radical press,&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; called it &quot;a rigorously intelligent publisher.&quot;

==Operations==
In 1970, Verso Books began as a paperback imprint of New Left Books and became its sole imprint. It established itself as a publisher of nonfiction works on international politics. Verso Books has also periodically published fiction over its history.

On April 8, 2014 Verso began bundling DRM-free e-books with print purchases made through its website. Verso&#x27;s managing director and US publisher, Jacob Stevens, stated that he expected the new offer on the Verso website to contribute £200,000 to the publisher&#x27;s revenue in its first year helping to &quot;shake up how publishers relate to their readership, and help to support independent publishing&quot;.

In 2019, Verso Books launched a dedicated fiction imprint, Verso Fiction. The fiction editor, Cian McCourt, said, &quot;We want to publish bold, intelligent writing that&#x27;s politically astute, but not dogmatic or charmless.&quot; In an article titled, &quot;The best (and worst) fiction books of 2023,&quot; &quot;The Telegraph&quot; said of the imprint, &quot;But the gem has been Verso, our closest thing to a mainstream radical publisher. It’s building one of Britain’s most interesting fiction lists.&quot;

Verso Books titles are distributed in the United States by Penguin Random House. 

The publishing house is known to host many events in the United States and the UK, focusing on radical politics and history.

===Sexual harassment grievance===

In 2021, Verso was publicly accused of poorly handling an internal sexual harassment grievance brought by a former publicist employed in the company&#x27;s US office against its long-time publisher, Jacob Stevens. She described the incident in a Medium piece thus: &quot;He then said, of my hiring, &#x27;We needed someone nice to look at in the office besides Wes.&#x27;” She claims that this remark caused severe depression and self-harm. The board of directors responded with a public apology and updates on their sexual harassment policy. However, they likewise maintain that their procedures were properly followed, as determined by an independent review.

===Marston Book Services bankruptcy===

In September 2024, Verso launched a crowdfunding campaign via the website Kickstarter, in response to the bankruptcy of its UK distributor, Marston Book Services. UK-based United Independent Distributors, of which Marston was a subsidiary, had entered administration on 25 July 2024.

Verso expected that the revenue crowdfunding campaign would allow it to publish its planned Autumn 2024 catalogue and pay for expenses as it transitioned to a new distribution arrangement with Macmillan Distribution.

==Publications==
The publisher gained early recognition for translations of books by European thinkers and Continental philosophy, especially those from the Frankfurt School, and its affiliation with Marxist and neo-Marxist writers. Verso Books&#x27; best-selling title is the autobiography of Rigoberta Menchú, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992.

Verso has published books by Tariq Ali, Benedict Anderson, Robin Blackburn, Judith Butler, Noam Chomsky, C.L.R James, Mike Davis, Norman Finkelstein, Fredric Jameson, Edward Said, Max Shachtman, Rebecca Solnit, Nick Srnicek, Paul Feyerabend, Ellen Meiksins Wood, and Slavoj Žižek. Updated translations of Jean Baudrillard, Régis Debray, Jürgen Habermas, Rigoberta Menchú, and Paul Virilio have also been published through Verso.

By 2020, Verso Books had published over 1,800 titles.

<doc id="659564" wikidata="Q238963" url="?curid=659564" title="Gianna Beretta Molla">
<text>Gianna Beretta Molla (4 October 1922 – 28 April 1962) was an Italian Catholic pediatrician. Although aware of possible fatal consequences, Molla refused both an abortion and a hysterectomy during her pregnancy with her fourth child in order to preserve the child&#x27;s life. 

Molla&#x27;s medical career followed the teachings of the Catholic Church; she believed in following her conscience while coming to the aid of others who required assistance. Molla also dedicated herself to charitable work amongst the elderly and was involved in Catholic Action; she also aided the Saint Vincent de Paul group in their outreach to the poor and less fortunate.

Molla&#x27;s beatification was celebrated in 1994 and she was canonized as a saint a decade later in mid-2004 in Saint Peter&#x27;s Square.

==Life==
Gianna Beretta was born in Magenta on 4 October 1922, a Feast of Saint Francis of Assisi, as the tenth of 13 children (only eight survived into adulthood) to Maria de Micheli (c. 1887 - 1 May 1942) and Alberto Beretta (d. 1 September 1942), both members of the Third Order of Saint Francis. One of her siblings was the Servant of God Enrico Beretta (28 August 1916 – 10 August 2001). Beretta&#x27;s uncle was Monsignor Giuseppe Beretta and one relative was Father Giovanni Battista Beretta. Her other siblings were Giuseppe (a priest), Virginia, and Amalia (1910 – 22 January 1937). Her baptism was celebrated at the Basilica di San Martino on 11 October.

When she was three, the Berettas relocated to Bergamo, where she grew up. She made her First Communion on 4 April 1928 and her Confirmation in the Bergamo Cathedral on 9 June 1930 from Monsignor Luigi Maria Marelli. The Berettas moved to Genoa following her sister Amalia&#x27;s death in 1937 and sought residence in the Quinto al Mare neighborhood, where she attended school. She was an active participant in the parish of Saint Peter and Archbishop Mario Righetti had an active role in her spiritual formation until the Berettas returned to Bergamo in October 1941 to live with her maternal grandparents at San Vigilio. From 16 to 18 March 1938, she made the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius, but 1938 to 1939 saw a suspension in her studies when she was ill health.

In 1942, she began her studies in medicine in Milan. Outside of her schooling, she was active in the Azione Cattolica (Catholic Action) movement. Beretta received a medical diploma on 30 November 1949 from the Pavia college and in 1950, she opened an office in Mesero, close to her hometown, where she specialized in pediatrics. Beretta hoped to join her brother Giuseppe, a priest in the Brazilian missions, where she intended to offer gynecological services to poor women, but her chronic ill health made this impractical. Instead, she continued her practice. Beginning 7 July 1952, she specialized in pediatrics at the University of Milan.

In December 1954 she met Pietro Molla (1912 – 3 April 2010), an engineer, and the two became engaged the following 11 April. The pair later married on 24 September 1955 at the Basilica di San Martino, in Magenta. The pair visited Saint Peter&#x27;s Square as part of their honeymoon. Molla gave birth to four children:
* Pierluigi (b. 19 November 1956)
* Mariolina (11 December 1957 – 12 February 1964)
* Laura (b. 15 July 1959)
* Gianna (b. 21 April 1962)
Her sisters-in-law were Luigia (a nun) and Teresina (d. 1950).

In 1961, during the second month of her fourth and final pregnancy, Molla developed a fibroma on her uterus. The doctors gave her three choices following an examination: an abortion, a complete hysterectomy, or the removal of the fibroma alone.

Molla opted for the removal of the fibroma since she wanted to preserve her child&#x27;s life. She told the doctors that her child&#x27;s life was more important than her own. On the morning of Holy Saturday, 21 April 1962, Molla was sent to the hospital where her fourth child, Gianna Emanuela, was delivered via a Caesarean section. But Molla continued to have severe pain and died of septic peritonitis one week after giving birth, on the morning of Easter Saturday, 28 April. , her daughter Gianna Emanuela is a doctor of geriatrics.

Her husband wrote a biographical account of her life in April 1971 and dedicated it to his children. He often told Gianna Emanuela that her mother&#x27;s choice was one of conscience as both a loving mother and a doctor.

==Canonization==
The Cardinal Archbishop of Milan Giovanni Colombo promoted the opening of a canonization cause on 6 November 1972 and it took a step forward on 11 April 1978 when Colombo and sixteen other bishops filed a petition to Pope Paul VI asking for him to initiate the cause of canonization.

The beatification process was opened under Pope John Paul II on 15 March 1980 and Molla became titled as a Servant of God. Carlo Maria Martini presided over the cognitional process of investigation from 30 June 1980 until 21 March 1986, at which stage all documents were sent to Rome for inspection. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints were convinced the process completed to an appropriate degree and issued a decree of validation for the cognitional process on 14 November 1986. The postulation submitted the Positio dossier to the CCS later in 1989, after which a team of theologians assessed and approved it on 14 December 1990. The CCS soon followed on 18 June 1991. Molla became titled as Venerable on 6 July 1991 after John Paul II confirmed that she had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue.

Molla&#x27;s beatification, like all others, depended upon a miracle, often a healing, that science and medicine cannot seem to explain. One such case was investigated in Grajaú in Brazil from 30 November 1981 until 15 January 1982. Two additional supplementary processes were also held during this time, with the first spanning from 30 October 1986 to November 1986, and the other from 8 August 1987 until 2 November 1987. The CCS issued their decree of validation at the closure of these three investigations on 27 September 1991. The CCS members confirmed the findings of these two bodies on 17 November 1992. John Paul II issued his approval of this healing on 21 December 1992, and beatified Molla on 24 April 1994.

But a second miracle was needed for her to be elevated to sainthood. A case came to the postulation&#x27;s attention from Franca, Brazil, which promoted a diocesan investigation from 31 May to 1 August 2001. The closure of this investigation saw documents sent to the CCS, who validated the process on 22 February 2002. John Paul II granted the final approval on 20 December 2003, and formalization came at an ordinary consistory held on 19 February 2004. Molla was proclaimed as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church in Saint Peter&#x27;s Square on 16 May 2004.

Molla&#x27;s husband and their children were present at the canonization. It was the first time that a husband had ever witnessed his wife&#x27;s canonization.

===Miracles===
The miracle that led to her beatification involved a Protestant Brazilian woman Lucia Sylvia Cirilo who gave birth to a stillborn child on 22 October 1977. Cirilo was discharged from the hospital, but began suffering from severe pains within a week that forced her brother to take her to the Saint Francis of Assisi hospital in Grajaú, Maranhão on 9 November. The doctors found an unseen complication that caused a rectal-vaginal fistula, one that the hospital was not equipped to treat. She was told that she would need to be moved to the hospital at São Luís, but she believed that she would not survive the trip there. One of the nurses, Sister Bernardina de Manaus, was so distressed about this that she appealed for the intercession of Molla while looking at a small picture of her. The nun asked two other nurses to follow her lead and the group soon discovered that Cirilo&#x27;s pain had disappeared, leaving the doctors amazed at the fact that the fistula had healed in full.

The miracle that led to Molla&#x27;s canonization involved another Brazilian Catholic woman, Elizabeth Comparini Arcolino. She was sixteen weeks pregnant in 2000 when she sustained a tear in her placenta that drained her womb of all amniotic fluid. Her doctors told her that the child&#x27;s chances of survival were impossible because she was too early in her pregnancy. Arcolino said she appealed to the then-Blessed Molla asking for her intercession and was able to deliver her child in perfect health.

==Legacies==
The late Molla&#x27;s example was hailed as courageous by Catholics after her death. Pope Paul VI hailed her protection and love of life in his Angelus address on 23 September 1973.

Gianna Beretta Molla is the inspiration behind the Gianna Center in New York, the first Catholic health care center for women in New York dedicated to pro-life beliefs. Saint Gianna Beretta Molla is also the eponym of Saint Gianna&#x27;s Maternity Home in Warsaw, North Dakota.

In September 2015, the saint&#x27;s daughter Dr. Gianna Emanuela Molla read a letter before Pope Francis during the 2015 World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia. The letter, which her mother wrote to her father not long before their marriage, highlighted the Christian virtues of marriage and called him and herself as a couple to serve God in a &quot;saintly way&quot; through what she called &quot;the sacrament of love&quot;.

On November 1 (All Saints Day), 2019, Dr. Gianna Emanuela Molla was the featured guest at the University of Mary&#x27;s Candlelight Gala and granted permission (on behalf of the Molla family) for the university to name its flagship School of Health Sciences after her mother, entrusting the students and faculty to St. Gianna as patroness.

<text>The Grand Staircase is an immense sequence of sedimentary rock layers that stretches south from Bryce Canyon National Park and Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument, through Zion National Park, and into Grand Canyon National Park.

==Characterization==
In the 1870s, geologist Clarence Dutton first conceptualized this region as a huge stairway ascending out of the bottom of the Grand Canyon northward with the cliff edge of each layer forming giant steps. Dutton divided this layer cake of Earth history into five steps from the youngest (uppermost) rocks:
*Pink Cliffs 
*Grey Cliffs 
*White Cliffs 
*Vermilion Cliffs
*Chocolate Cliffs

Since then, modern geologists have further divided Dutton&#x27;s steps into individual rock formations.


Formations in the Grand Staircase starting with the youngest (uppermost) rocks:
*Claron Formation
*Kaiparowits Formation
*Wahweap Formation
*Straight Cliffs Formation
*Tropic Shale
*Dakota Sandstone
*Carmel Formation
*Temple Cap Formation
*Navajo Formation
*Kayenta Formation
*Moenave Formation
*Chinle Formation
*Moenkopi Formation
*Kaibab Limestone
*Toroweap Formation
*Coconino Sandstone
*Hermit Shale
*Supai Group
*Surprise Canyon Formation
*Redwall Limestone

*Bright Angel Shale
*Tapeats Sandstone

The major sedimentary rock units exposed in the Grand Canyon range in age from 200 million to 600 million years and were deposited in warm shallow seas and near-shore environments. The nearly 40 identified rock layers of Grand Canyon form one of the most studied geologic columns in the world. 

The oldest exposed formation in Zion National Park is the youngest exposed formation in the Grand Canyon – the ~240‑million-year-old Kaibab Limestone. The Bryce Canyon area to the northeast continues where the Zion area leaves off by presenting Cenozoic-aged rocks that are 100 million years younger. In fact the youngest formation seen in the Zion area is the oldest exposed formation in Bryce Canyon – the Dakota Sandstone. There are, however, shared rock units between all three, creating a super-sequence of formations that geologists call the Grand Staircase. Bryce Canyon&#x27;s formations are the youngest known units in the Grand Staircase. Younger rock units, if they ever existed, have been removed by erosion. 

These layers have undergone 5000 to 10,000 feet (1500 to 3000 m) of uplift starting about 66 million years ago with the Laramide orogeny which has increased the ability of the Colorado River to cut its channel to make individual plateaus out of the Colorado Plateaus region. The major canyons of the region did not start to form until about five to six million years ago when the Gulf of California opened up and thus lowered the river&#x27;s base level (its lowest point).

==Paleontology==
In the 1880s, many large dinosaur skeletons were excavated from southern Utah in regions north of the Grand Staircase. Following these discoveries there was little interest in further exploration. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries there has been greatly renewed interests in the strata of the Grand Staircase, particularly since the exposure and collection of new fossils in previously unexplored strata has a high probability of revealing fossil remnants of hitherto unseen species.

Southern Utah has continued to reward researchers owing to its climatological &quot;sweet spot&quot; for exposing fossil remnants for observation and collection at the surface. At locations south, in Arizona, the climate is so dry that erosion is relatively slow. Further north, the wetter climates encourage growth of forests, which destroy fossils by the actions of roots and soil bacteria. In southern Utah, there are enough strong and wet storms to cause episodic rapid erosion and the consequent exposure of fossil remains, but with insufficient annual average rainfall to support destructive, deep-rooted plant life.

<text>In Classical architecture and in art a term or terminal figure (: terms or termini) is a human head and bust that continues down as a square tapering pillar-like form. It is usually distinguished from a herm, which has a head and shoulders only, but the two words may be used rather loosely and interchangeably.

The god Terminus was the Etruscan and Roman deity of boundaries, and classical sources say that boundary markers often took the form of a half-figure of the god on a pillar, though ancient survivals in this form are extremely rare. 

In the architecture and the painted architectural decoration of the European Renaissance and the succeeding Classical styles, term figures are quite common. Often they represent minor deities associated with fields and vineyards and the edges of woodland, Pan and fauns and Bacchantes especially, and they may be draped with garlands of fruit and flowers.

Term figures were a particularly characteristic feature of the 16th-century style in furniture and carved interior decoration that is called Antwerp Mannerism. Ornament prints, such as a set of 20 School of Fontainebleau etchings from the 1540s usually given to Jean Mignon, disseminated the style through Germany and England. In these very fanciful Mannerist creations, many of the forms dip in and out of architectural and anatomical shapes.

<text>Commonly known as the Westcoaster, the Melbourne to Hobart Ocean Yacht Race also known as M2H commences from Port Phillip, Victoria and concludes in Hobart, Tasmania. It is run by the Ocean Racing Club of Victoria.

In 2007, to honour the 100th anniversary of the first sailing of the Rudder Cup, the ORCV broke with a 35-year tradition by redirecting the Melbourne to Hobart course for the “Westcoaster” to follow the Rudder Cup Melbourne to Launceston course to their finish line at Low Head near the mouth of the Tamar River and then on to Hobart but via Banks Strait and the East Coast of Tasmania. This proved to be a race with many unique navigational challenges. Unlike the other race down the East Coast, the course took competitors close in around the coastline. Many competitors called for the race to be repeated and so the Eastcoaster was born. The course over which the Eastcoaster race is run is slightly different from the initial 2007 race to eliminate the tidal influence of Low Head and Banks Strait. The race starts from Portsea and the first course is through the Heads. The fleet will then set a course past Cape Schank for Wilson&#x27;s Promontory.

<doc id="659597" wikidata="Q5578925" url="?curid=659597" title="Gold fingerprinting">
<text>Gold fingerprinting is a method used to identify and authenticate gold items by analyzing the unique composition of impurities or trace elements within the metal. While gold itself is an inert and relatively uniform element, gold found in natural or processed items often contains small amounts of other elements, such as silver or lead. These trace elements, which vary depending on the source and refining process, serve as a &quot;fingerprint&quot; for the gold. By comparing the elemental composition of a gold sample to databases of known sources, experts can determine where the gold was likely mined or processed. This technique is applied in fields such as archaeology, geology, and forensic science, as it provides insights into the provenance of historical artifacts, mined gold, or stolen items.

== Applications ==

Gold fingerprinting characterizes a gold sample or gold-containing item by analyzing its trace elements, identifying the sample by its mineralizing event and linking it to a specific mine or bullion source. Elements that are measured above detection limits can be used for gold fingerprinting and geochemical characterization. For this technique to be effective in identifying the origins of gold, a database of fingerprinted samples from mines and bullion sources is required.

This technique has been used to assert claims over stolen or relocated gold, even in instances where it has been salted—deliberately blended with gold from disparate origins. Beyond this, gold fingerprinting serves as a tool in identifying the often obscure provenance of gold artifacts.

==Method==
Electron microprobe (EMP), Synchrotron micro-XRF (SR-M-XRF), Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), Atomic emission spectrometry, x-ray fluorescence spectrometry with higher energy synchrotron radiation (SR-XFS) and Laser ablation-Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) are all methods of gold fingerprinting.

The most common method is LA-ICP-MS primarily because it is quasi-nondestructive, allowing for the preservation of the samples and convenient as samples require little to no preparation. Laser ablation allows for high spatial resolution sampling while the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry provides high sensitivity to identify extremely small amounts of trace elements within the gold. This method can also be conducted outside of a lab with the assistance of a portable device that uses a diode pumped solid state laser and fiber-optics, making fingerprinting more convenient as it eliminates the need for transfer of gold to a specific lab.

Advantages of LA-ICP-MS include reduced sample preparation, no sample size requirements, reduced spectral interference and increased sample throughput. Over the past 32 years, LA-ICP-MS has been used for archaeological, biological and forensic purposes. For example a group of gold foil fragments dating back to the 5th Century B.C.E. were analysized by LA-ICP-MS uncovering information on their manufacturing process, function and relationship to one another.

== Complications ==
LA-ICP-MS function optimally with gold particles greater than 60 μm in diameter to avoid any contamination during measurements. Although LA-ICP-MS has a lower detection limit, its overall precision was lower than other analysis techniques for trace element concentrations such as field emission-electron probe microanalysis (FE-EPMA) and synchrotron micro X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (SR-l-XRF). 

Due to the small size of gold (&lt;5μm-250μm) small fragments of minerals need to be separated from the gold before analysis can occur.

Gold fingerprinting has limitations including elemental fractionation (the non-sample related analyte) and calibration requires matrix-matched standards.

A few other problems exist that limit actual sourcing or provencancing of gold in relation to manufactured art objects. These problems include: a lack of an extensive database of elemental profiles in gold ores, the natural differences that coexist in ore geology and the difficulties of accurately analyzing trace elements. Also, trading, looting and re-melting of so called “precious” metal objects add to the problem of sourcing.

<text>Robert Evan Ornstein (August 21, 1942 – December 20, 2018) was an American psychologist, researcher and author.

He taught at the Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute, based at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco, and was professor at Stanford University and founder and chairman of the Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge (ISHK).

==Life==

===Early life and education===
Robert Evan Ornstein was born in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York, USA, and grew up in the city. He was twice high school math champion in a city-wide contest, and &quot;wavered between physics and poetry before compromising on psychology&quot; at the City University of New York&#x27;s Queens College.

In 1964 he was awarded a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology at Queens College, and went on to gain a PhD at Stanford University, California in 1968. His doctoral thesis was &quot;On the Experience of Time&quot;.

===Career===
Ornstein was involved in reconciling the scientific understanding of mind and consciousness with other scientific and cultural traditions. His work has been featured in a 1974 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article entitled &quot;Hemispheric Thinker&quot;.

In 1969 Ornstein founded the Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge (ISHK) an educational 501(c) (3) non-profit organization dedicated to cross-cultural understanding and to bringing important research on human nature to the general public, most recently The Human Journey website. He was the President of ISHK until his death.

Ornstein&#x27;s book &quot;The Right Mind&quot; deals with split-brain studies and other experiments or clinical evidence revealing the abilities of the right cerebral hemisphere.

He also wrote on the brain&#x27;s role in health in &quot;The Healing Brain&quot; with David Sobel of Kaiser Permanente; the way in which human consciousness is unable to understand the fast paced modern world in &quot;New World New Mind: Moving Toward Conscious Evolution&quot; with Paul Ehrlich; and the way in which our current consciousness has developed in &quot;The Axemaker&#x27;s Gift&quot;, with James Burke, a book that addressed the way in which Western culture has developed and our minds along with it.

Ornstein worked to reconcile the wisdom traditions of the East and science in &quot;The Psychology of Consciousness&quot; and was interested in promoting the modern Sufism of Idries Shah. Shah and Ornstein met in the 1960s.
Ornstein&#x27;s &quot;The Psychology of Consciousness&quot; (1972) was enthusiastically received by the academic psychology community, as it coincided with new interests in the field, such as the study of biofeedback and other techniques designed to achieve shifts in mood and awareness.

&quot;The Psychology of Consciousness&quot; and &quot;The Evolution of Consciousness&quot; introduced the two modes of consciousness of the left and right brain hemispheres and a critical understanding of how the brain evolved. Ornstein considered these, along with his latest book, &quot;God 4.0: On the Nature of Higher Consciousness and the Experience Called &quot;God&quot;&quot;, his most important writings. The three books together provide a fundamental reconsideration of ancient religious and spiritual traditions in the light of advances in brain science and psychology, exploring the potential and relevance of this knowledge to contemporary needs and to our shared future.

===Death===
Robert Ornstein died on December 20, 2018. He is survived by his wife, Sally Mallam; his brother Alan Ornstein; sister-in-law Rachel Hawk, and niece Jessie Ornstein.

<text>A sextet (or hexad) is a formation containing exactly six members. The former term is commonly associated with vocal ensembles (e.g. The King&#x27;s Singers, Affabre Concinui) or musical instrument groups, but can be applied to any situation where six similar or related objects are considered a single unit.

Musical compositions with six parts are sextets. Many musical compositions are named for the number of musicians for which they are written. If a piece is written for six performers, it may be called a &quot;sextet&quot;. Steve Reich&#x27;s &quot;Sextet&quot;, for example, is written for six percussionists. However, much as many string quartets do not include &quot;string quartet&quot; in the title (though many do), many sextets do not include &quot;sextet&quot; in their title. See: string sextet and piano sextet.

In jazz music a sextet is any group of six players, usually containing a drum set (bass drum, snare drum, hi-hat, ride cymbal), string bass or electric bass, piano, and various combinations of the following or other instruments: guitar, trumpet, saxophone, clarinet, trombone.

In heavy metal and rock music, a sextet typically contains, but is not restricted to, a lead vocalist, two guitarists, a bassist, drummer, and keyboardist.
