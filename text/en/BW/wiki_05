<text>The Renault 19 is a small family car that was produced by the French car manufacturer Renault between 1988 and 1996. In Turkey and in Argentina, production continued until 2000. The internal development code for the 19 was X53, with the five door receiving the &quot;B53&quot; chassis code, the three door being the &quot;C53&quot;, the Chamade the &quot;L53&quot;, and the Cabriolet the &quot;D53&quot;.

==Overview==
The R19 was presented in June 1988, with sales in the domestic French market beginning in September 1988. It was the replacement for the 9 and 11, both of which were ageing and outdated by the end of the 1980s. The R19 went on sale in right hand drive form for the British market in February 1989.

The R19 was styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro, featuring Renault&#x27;s new E-type (or &quot;Energy&quot;) 1.4 L engine and F type 1.7 L versions. Base models originally used the OHV C-type Cléon 1.2 and 1.4 L engines, depending on the market. While originally only available with an atmospheric diesel engine, a turbocharged version appeared in the beginning of 1992.

Intended to be Renault&#x27;s last numeric named car, the 19 ushered in a new naming policy, with the saloon versions of the 19 being known as the 19 Chamade, to distinguish them from the hatchbacks. The saloon version was launched in 1989. In many markets, the Chamade badge was dropped following the facelift of 1992, with some replacing it with the &quot;Europa&quot; tag. The 19 Chamade customers were more often men, more often married and more rural and older than R19 hatchback buyers.

In 1991, a convertible bodystyle built by Karmann was first shown; only a small number of these were built with the Phase I design as it was facelifted shortly thereafter. The convertible version went on sale in the beginning of 1992; it was only available with the two most powerful engine options. Although the R19&#x27;s exterior design (which was relatively conservative, like that of the Renault 9/11) received a muted response, it was praised for its interior comfort and handling.

For the fuel injected top versions, a four-speed automatic transmission became available in the fall of 1990. Lesser versions still made do with four- or five-speed manuals, or a three-speed automatic.

===Facelift===
In the summer of 1992, a revamped model was introduced with a substantially restyled front and rear, including a new dashboard and interior — although right-hand drive models retained the original dashboard from the Phase 1.

With the facelift, smaller &quot;Energy&quot; series units gradually replaced the old pushrod items, and 1.8 litre engines appeared at the top of the lineup, where they replaced the more powerful 1.7 units (the F3N). The R19 was sold in most of Europe until 1996, and was produced for some South American markets in Argentina until 2000 and for the Andean markets in Colombia until 2001.
Turkish production lasted a little longer than in the rest of Europe, also until the year 2000. The R19&#x27;s platform and running gear would continue to be used in its replacement, the first generation Renault Mégane, which lasted for seven years.

The Renault 19 was awarded the 1989 Car of the Year in Spain and Germany, 1990 Car of the Year in Ireland, and 1993 Car of the Year in Argentina. It was sold in limited numbers in Japan through the Yanase Import Dealerships. The name &quot;Chamade&quot; wasn&#x27;t used on Japanese-market saloons because it was deemed too similar to the Daihatsu Charade, so these were called &quot;Europa&quot; instead. San Fu Motors in Taiwan began building two versions of the R19 locally in early 1990, aiming for a monthly output of 1,000 cars.

The R19 did well in Germany, a market French carmakers always had a hard time cracking. It was the best selling imported car in West Germany in 1990 and then in re-united Germany from 1991 to 1994.

===16S===
The Renault 19 16S (16V in some countries) was first shown towards the very end of 1988. It was only actually added to the lineup in the autumn of 1990, and was the only Renault 19 with a 16 valve engine. It had a distinctive air inlet on the bonnet (this did not appear on the earliest models), a rear spoiler, 15 inch Speedline SL401 alloy wheels, side skirts, twin headlamps, Recaro bucket seats with optional leather trim, four in one exhaust manifold and Bendix ABS braking system with optional trip computer, aircon and electric sunroof. The &quot;S&quot; is for &quot;Soupapes&quot;, French for valves.

Its rev happy F7P engine, which, along with the advanced Renix ECU, made it faster and more fuel efficient compared to most competitors. The braking system was upgraded to include vented discs on the front and discs on the rear as well as an uprated lower suspension setup and front strut bar. Period tests praised the car&#x27;s handling on curvy roads but criticized its high speed stability and noise levels, in part due to very low gearing.

Phase 1 editions benefited from unique front and rear bumpers with front indicators relocated into the bumpers to allow for the twin headlamps, while the Phase 2 retained the original bumpers found throughout the range but added colour coded tops, rubber inserts, and a discreet lower splitter. All bodystyles were offered with the 16 valve engine at one time or another, but were not available in all markets.

The Phase 2 models gear ratios were also revised, to allow for the extra weight found in the safety equipment the later models carried. The last models (1995 to 1996) were called Executive and came with leather interior as standard.

Renault claimed an acceleration from 0 to of 8.2 seconds for the non-catalysed version with . This engine was only available in the Phase 1 model. The catalysed model boasted and a top speed of , and a claimed 0 to 100 km/h time of 8.9 seconds.
==Motorsport==
Renault Sport used the 19 in the British Touring Car Championship in 1993, driven by Alain Menu and Tim Harvey. The car proved uncompetitive except in wet conditions, and was replaced with the Laguna for the 1994 season.

<doc id="634619" wikidata="Q32680449" url="?curid=634619" title="Light railway">
<text>A light railway is a railway built at lower costs and to lower standards than typical &quot;heavy rail&quot;: it uses lighter-weight track, and may have more steep gradients and tight curves to reduce civil engineering costs. These lighter standards allow lower costs of operation, at the price of lower vehicle capacity.

== Narrow gauge ==
The precise meaning of the term &quot;light railway&quot; varies by geography and context.

In countries where a single standard gauge is dominant, the term light railway does not imply a narrow gauge railway. Most narrow gauge railways operate as light railways, but not all light railways need be narrow gauge. After Spooner&#x27;s development of steam haulage for narrow gauge railways, the prevailing view was that the gauge should be tailored according to the traffic: &quot;The nearer the machine is apportioned to the work it has to do the cheaper will that work be done.&quot;

From the 1890s, it was recognised that cost savings could also be made in the construction and operation of a standard gauge railway: &quot;light axle-loads and low speeds, not gauge, are the first condition of cheap construction and economical working. Gauge is quite a secondary factor.&quot; Break of gauge now became an important factor, and there was much concern over whether this would become an additional cost for the transshipment of goods, or whether this was over-emphasised compared to the amount of warehousing and handling needed anyway. The Irish railway system in particular became a good example of a broad gauge main line system with many independent narrow gauge, , light railway feeder branch lines.

==United States==
In the United States, &quot;light railway&quot; generally refers to an urban or interurban rail system, which historically would correspond to a streetcar network. The distinct term &quot;light rail&quot; was introduced in the 1970s to describe a form of urban rail public transportation that has a lower capacity and lower speed than a heavy rail or metro system, but which generally operates in exclusive rights-of-way, in contrast with streetcar systems which operate in shared road traffic with automobiles. Urban sprawl combined with higher fuel prices has caused an increase in popularity of these light rail systems in recent decades.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom &quot;light railway&quot; refers in its strictest sense to a railway built or operated under the Light Railways Act 1896 (59 &amp; 60 Vict. c. 48). That act, though, gives only a vague description; a better one is found from John Charles MacKay in the same year: &quot;A light railway is one constructed with lighter rails and structures, running at a slower speed, with poorer accommodation for passengers and less facility for freight. It can be worked with less stringent standards of signalling and safety practice. It is a cheap railway and a second class of railway.&quot; These terms are not pejorative, they simply recognise that the standards of main-line heavy railways are not needed in all situations. Their great advantage under UK law was that they avoided the need for an expensive act of Parliament before each new line; they only required a much simpler light railway order within the terms of the act.

The term is also used more generally of any lightly built railway with limited traffic, often controlled locally and running unusual or older rolling stock. A light railway is properly distinct from a tramway which operates under differing rules and may share a road. The term &quot;light railway&quot; is generally used in a positive manner.

Perhaps the most well-known caricature of a light railway is the film &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot;, made in 1953 as many of the light railways and other small branch lines were being closed. Despite the great public affection for these railways, very few were financially successful. Colonel H.F. Stephens was pivotal in the light railway world, and tried many techniques to make light railways pay, introducing some of the earliest railcars and also experimenting with a rail lorry built out of an old Model T Ford. Nevertheless, most light railways never made much money, and by the 1930s they were being driven out of business by the motor car. Although World War II resulted in a brief increase in the importance of these railways, very few lasted beyond the early 1950s. Those that survive today are generally heritage railways.

==Australia==
Queensland adopted a narrow gauge of in order to make construction of lines lighter and thus cheaper, though this initiated a break-of-gauge with other states. The cost savings were due to light rails, low axleloads and low speeds as much as due to the gauge.

Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia followed suit with the narrow gauge to reduce costs, though South Australia ended up with an inefficient two-gauge system which negated some of the supposed cost savings of the narrow gauge. New South Wales resisted calls to introduce narrow gauge, but did adopt pioneer lines with rails to reduce costs without the need for breaks-of-gauge.

There were a significant number of small and isolated mining and timber railway built to a variety of gauges and improvised standards.

There are still a large number of sugar cane tramways built to a common gauge, and sharing research and development into advanced features such as concrete sleepers, tamping machines, remotely controlled brake vans, and the like. There is little through traffic with mainline railways so that break-of-gauge is not a problem.

The Iron Knob Railway was legally a &quot;tramway&quot;, but operated 2,000-ton iron ore trams which were heavier than most railways.

==Japan==
Also in Japan, originally, &quot;light railway&quot; refers to a railway built or operated under the Light Railways Act enforced in 1909. The act in Japan also though gives only a vague description; the purpose of the act is for building railways easily with less stringent standards and at low cost.

The light railway concept in Japan is therefore similar to the UK and other countries. Many light railways were built for passengers or as military, industrial or forest railways in Japan, and in Japan&#x27;s colonies in Taiwan, Korea, Manchuria, Sakhalin and Micronesia. Some light railways were destroyed during World War II, especially in Okinawa. By the 1970s, most light railways in Japan had been driven out of business by the motor car. Some of the remaining lines survive in passenger service, and others have been restored as heritage railways.

==Taiwan==
Taiwanese push car railways used handcars on 762mm gauge rails to transport sugarcanes of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation to the mainline railways of the Taiwan Railway Administration or the processing plants of the Taiwan Sugar Cooperation for further production to turn the sugarcane to fine sugar.

==Industrial railways==
Many industrial railways were built to light railway standards. These may be of light and small construction, although the wagons carrying molten-steel in a steelworks can be several hundred tonnes in weight.

===Panama===

The Panama Canal construction used a heavy network of temporary railways in its construction to move vast quantities of soil from the excavations to the dams that were constructed.

==Military railways==
Light railways have been used in several wars, especially before the advent of the combustion engine and motor car. These have often connect depots some distance behind the front line with the front lines themselves. Some armies have Divisions of Engineers trained to operate trains. Sometimes they operate a branch line of their own so that they can practise track and bridge building (and demolition) without disturbing trains on the main line.

<text>Falcon Crest is an American prime time television soap opera created by Earl Hamner Jr. that aired for nine seasons on CBS from December 4, 1981, to May 17, 1990. The series revolves around the feuding factions of the wealthy Gioberti/Channing family in the California wine industry set in the fictitious Tuscany Valley, located northeast of San Francisco and modeled after the real Napa Valley.

Jane Wyman stars as Angela Channing, the tyrannical matriarch of the Falcon Crest Winery, opposite Robert Foxworth as Chase Gioberti, Angela&#x27;s nephew, and later David Selby as Richard Channing, the illegitimate son of Angela&#x27;s ex-husband. Other notable series regulars include Abby Dalton and Margaret Ladd as Angela&#x27;s daughters Julia and Emma, Lorenzo Lamas as Angela&#x27;s grandson Lance, Susan Sullivan as Chase&#x27;s wife Maggie, William R. Moses as their son Cole, and Ana Alicia as heiress Melissa Agretti.

Jane Wyman won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her role as Angela Channing out of two nominations. Lorenzo Lamas and Gina Lollobrigida were also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor/Actress.

==Production==
===Creation===
The show was created by Earl Hamner Jr., who had previously created &quot;The Waltons&quot;. Hamner wanted to create a family drama involving the wine industry entitled &quot;The Vintage Years&quot;. He offered Wyman the lead role of Angela Channing. She said, &quot;I told him I&#x27;d heard Barbara Stanwyck had turned it down. And he said that was an untrue rumor. It had never been offered to her.&quot; Hamner said he was looking for a &quot;sympathetic actress&quot; for the role. He called Wyman &quot;one of the legendary stars ... a great actress&quot;, and insisted that though she was the ex-wife of US President Ronald Reagan who was elected as president in 1980, her casting had nothing to do with her connection to Reagan. Hamner said Wyman was chosen to add credibility to the role, and noted &quot;The character is a harsh one. Miss Wyman&#x27;s nice-lady image gives Angie more dimension and sympathy.&quot;

Hamner&#x27;s concept was &quot;the flip side of &quot;The Waltons&quot;—this family was infected by wealth, whereas poverty had threatened his Depression story [in &quot;The Waltons&quot;]&quot;. After shooting the original pilot episode of the series, called &quot;The Vintage Years&quot; in the spring of 1981, featuring Wyman in a silver wig, the actress pushed for changes in Angela. Hamner had warned Wyman that the press would call Angela a female J. R. Ewing, the amoral oil baron from &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; lead-in series, &quot;Dallas&quot;, played by Larry Hagman. Not wanting her character to simply be a J.R. clone, Wyman said, &quot;I feel I&#x27;m representing all women in business. I may come off as a hard, tough character, but I want Angie to show she&#x27;s also capable of love.&quot;

CBS requested that Hamner make the show more like &quot;Dallas&quot;, which was the network&#x27;s biggest hit at that time, and the show was retooled and the pilot reshot. The script was rewritten and several cast members changed for what became &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;. The series first aired in December 1981, when CBS scheduled &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; at 10 pm on Friday nights, right after &quot;Dallas&quot;. The &quot;Dallas&quot;-&quot;Falcon Crest&quot; double bill proved lucrative for the network and &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; was a top-20 show in the Nielsen ratings for several years. Both shows (like &quot;The Waltons&quot;) were produced for CBS by the same company, Lorimar Productions.

Each episode of the series cost $1 million.

===Casting===
Opposite to Wyman, Robert Foxworth was cast as Chase Gioberti, Angela&#x27;s nephew, and later David Selby as Richard Channing, the illegitimate son of Angela&#x27;s ex-husband. Other notable series regular cast include Abby Dalton and Margaret Ladd as Angela&#x27;s daughters Julia and Emma, Lorenzo Lamas as Angela&#x27;s grandson Lance, Susan Sullivan as Chase&#x27;s wife Maggie, William R. Moses as their son Cole, and Ana Alicia as heiress Melissa Agretti.

The series also frequently cast former Hollywood royalty in guest roles: Lana Turner, Dana Andrews, Celeste Holm, Gina Lollobrigida, Kim Novak, Cliff Robertson, Cesar Romero, and Robert Stack all appeared on &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;. This aspect to the series seemed to be well-embraced by the producers, who at one stage instituted a rotating guest-star policy. Eddie Albert, Ursula Andress, Eve Arden, Roscoe Lee Browne, Leslie Caron and Lauren Hutton all made appearances during the 1987–1988 season, as did Rod Taylor, who would remain with the series until its end in 1990. After producer Jeff Freilich left the series at the end of the 1988 season, fewer special guest stars appeared to boost ratings, one of them being Susan Blakely in the final year.

Wyman reportedly had had a long-running feud with fellow movie star legend Lana Turner, which dated back years. The two actresses supposedly refused to speak to each other and the producers had to film their confrontational scenes separately and then edit them together. Turner appeared on &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot; in 1982 and emphatically denied the rumors of the reported feud. &quot;It&#x27;s a bunch of bull. It&#x27;s all publicity trying to drum up a feud between us. I adore Ms. Wyman. I respect her as a lady and an artist, and there is no feud.&quot; A few years after she appeared on the show, Turner stated that she believed Wyman was negative in demeanor because her ex-husband, Ronald Reagan, was elected president during the 1980s, something that Turner believed Wyman could not reconcile within herself.

In 1984, Sophia Loren was set to star in the role of Francesca Gioberti, Angela&#x27;s secret half-sister, who comes to the valley to threaten Angela&#x27;s control of Falcon Crest. Loren was to play 13 episodes, and producers promised a fabulous wardrobe and a dynamic character that would rival &quot;Dynasty&quot; Alexis Carrington. At the last minute, negotiations with Loren fell through and Gina Lollobrigida (a longtime rival of Loren&#x27;s) was then cast in the role, but only signed on for five episodes. Lollobrigida earned a Golden Globe nomination for her guest role. Three years earlier, Loren had also been Aaron Spelling&#x27;s first choice for the role of Alexis Carrington on &quot;Dynasty&quot;, but was passed over when she demanded too much money and the role instead went to Joan Collins.

According to &quot;Dallas&quot; creator David Jacobs, before auditioning for &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, Robert Foxworth turned down the role of J. R. Ewing on &quot;Dallas&quot; because he did not want to play such an unsympathetic character. The role ultimately went to Larry Hagman.

===Filming and locations===
Searching for a location to use as the principal backdrop for the show, Lorimar producers decided upon Spring Mountain Vineyard, a winery located in St. Helena, in California&#x27;s Napa Valley. This site contained the 1884 Victorian mansion &quot;Villa Miravalle&quot;, the exterior of which was used as the Falcon Crest mansion where Angela lived with her daughters and grandson, as well as the winery building which had just been constructed in the mid-1970s. As a tie-in, the Spring Mountain Winery also produced a &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; wine during the show&#x27;s run.

===Theme music===
&quot;Falcon Crest&quot;&#x27;s theme tune was composed by Bill Conti, who also composed the themes to &quot;Dynasty&quot;, &quot;The Colbys&quot; and &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;. Several variations of the main title theme were commissioned throughout the series&#x27; run. The most noticeable change to the main title theme was the version for season nine, which was done in a heavily synthetic, new-age style by musician Patrick O&#x27;Hearn. 
Stylistic changes were also made to the incidental music. During seasons 1 to 5, the music was performed by an orchestra in a classical style, composed mainly by Dana Kaproff and Peter Myers. Beginning midway through season 5, the background music became electronic-based and was performed by single artists using a synclavier, a high-tech programmable synthesizer; Mark Snow, who later composed the theme of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, was the main composer and performing musician from 1986 to 1988. During season 8, the music returned to a more classical style, before the composers returned to the electronic style for the final season with the score provided by new-age composer Patrick O&#x27;Hearn.

===Pilot episode===
A pilot episode for the series entitled &quot;The Vintage Years&quot; was filmed in the spring of 1981, but never aired. The character of Richard Channing was present in the original pilot, played by Michael Swan; this alternate Richard was Angela&#x27;s biological son fighting for his domineering mother&#x27;s favor. Abby Dalton&#x27;s character, Julia, was called Dorcas, Jane Wyman wore a grey wig as Angela, and Chase and Maggie were played by Clu Gulager and Samantha Eggar, respectively. Emma was not seen, but a subplot concerning a mysterious woman crying for her mother while locked away in one of the upstairs rooms was seen. Lamas, Moses, and Rose appeared in the same roles, and Chao-Li Chi&#x27;s character was named Lee Fong.

The pilot was written by Hamner and directed by Alexander Singer. Though never broadcast or released on DVD, it was made available for download on the AOL video-on-demand service In2TV in 2007.

==Cast and characters==
At the center of the action is Angela Channing (Jane Wyman), an overbearing, tyrannical matriarch who rules the Falcon Crest vineyards with an iron fist. When her brother Jason Gioberti (Harry Townes) dies from a fall in the winery, his son Chase Gioberti (Robert Foxworth) arrives to claim his inherited portion of Falcon Crest. The rivalry between Angela and Chase — whom Angela sees as an interloper — sets the tone for much of the series.

Surrounding Angela are her daughters, Julia (Abby Dalton) and Emma (Margaret Ladd), and her lazy playboy grandson, Lance Cumson (Lorenzo Lamas), who aids her in her battles against Chase. Julia is chief winemaker, though often feels oppressed by her domineering mother. Kind-natured Emma does not work in the family business, but is emotionally troubled. Julia&#x27;s son Lance loves money and yearns for power, but lacks Angela&#x27;s discipline and determination. Her ever-tightening grip on him eventually sends him to work for his grandfather&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The San Francisco Globe&quot;, although he soon returns to the fold. Aiding Angela in her quest for more power is her crooked lawyer, Phillip Erikson (Mel Ferrer), who would later become her second husband.

Chase&#x27;s wife Maggie (Susan Sullivan) is a freelance writer who later works at &quot;The New Globe&quot; newspaper; their grown son Cole (William R. Moses) works at the winery with Chase, and daughter Vickie (Jamie Rose, later Dana Sparks) is just finishing school. Eventually realizing that she would not gain control over Chase&#x27;s land anytime soon, Angela hopes to enlarge her empire by forcing Lance into an arranged marriage with Melissa Agretti (briefly played by Delores Cantú, later by Ana Alicia), heiress to the much-coveted Agretti Vineyards. Scheming Melissa becomes embroiled in a love triangle with Lance and Cole, even marrying Lance while pregnant with Cole&#x27;s child.

In the second season, a true rival for Angela arrives in the form of conniving Richard Channing (David Selby), the illegitimate son of Angela&#x27;s ex-husband Douglas Channing and Chase&#x27;s mother. He inherits most of his father&#x27;s shares in the family newspaper after Douglas dies, and uses his new wealth and power to seek retribution against both Angela and Chase for always treating him like an outcast. Richard crosses them at every turn and makes several attempts at gaining control of Falcon Crest.

==Series overview==
===Early seasons===
Despite its reputation as merely being &quot;&quot;Dallas&quot; with grapes&quot;, &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; soon found its niche among the primetime soap dramas of the 1980s, occupying the middle ground between the two genre extremes — being more glamorous than &quot;Dallas&quot;, yet not quite as outrageous as &quot;Dynasty&quot;. The distinctive location filming in the Napa Valley and the dry, wryly humorous tone of the scripts gave the series a personality of its own.

The rivalry between Angela, Chase, and Richard stayed at the core of the show for several years, as more romantic entanglements spun around them. Lance and Cole found themselves not only caught up in their family battles for control of Falcon Crest, but were also competing for Melissa&#x27;s affections.

Like its counterparts, &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; employed memorable end-of-season cliffhangers to boost ratings. The 1982–83 season ended with the resolution of a murder mystery &quot;whodunit&quot; plot (surrounding the death of Melissa&#x27;s father, Carlo Agretti) that had spanned most of the season. The killer was revealed in front of the entire cast, only to produce a handgun. Shots were fired as the camera panned away from the mansion, fading into the final scene of a rose-draped coffin being lowered into the ground, leaving the audience to wonder who had been killed.

The third-season cliffhanger in 1984 involved a plane crash carrying most of the major characters, resulting in three of their deaths. A bomb explosion which ended the fourth season left Richard and Maggie in peril, and an earthquake that rippled through the valley ended the fifth season. The cliffhanger of the sixth season put Chase, Melissa, Richard, newcomer Dan Fixx and Maggie&#x27;s baby in danger of drowning in the San Francisco Bay area. At the end of the seventh season, Melissa had finally wrested complete control of Falcon Crest away from Angela, while Richard was apparently murdered by &quot;The Thirteen&quot;, a powerful group of shady businessmen whom he had turned against.

&quot;Falcon Crest&quot; was a top ten series from 1982 to 1985 (peaking at No. 7 in the 1983–84 season), airing after &quot;Dallas&quot; on Friday nights at 10:00 p.m.

===Later seasons===
With the departures of many of the core cast, coupled with the shifting tastes of the public in the mid-1980s, ratings began to drop (as had ratings for all of the primetime soaps of that era). By the late 1980s, U.S. ratings were dominated by sitcoms and more realistic legal/crime dramas such as &quot;L.A. Law&quot; and &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;. During its eighth season, &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; gave &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; the title of &quot;Most Ruined Show&quot; (that season finished 52nd in the annual ratings). The series attempted to revitalize like &quot;Knots Landing&quot; had successfully done the previous year, but by the beginning of the ninth and final season in 1989, Angela, Lance, and Emma were the only three characters left from the original cast. Jane Wyman was absent for most of that season due to her own health concerns; storylines had Angela attacked and fall into a coma for several months. The final season then revolved around a battle between Richard and newcomer Michael Sharpe for control of Falcon Crest.

CBS executives made the decision to end &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; when ratings during the ninth season dropped to 63rd place. Jane Wyman returned to the series for the last three episodes. The show ended happily with a family wedding taking place on the grounds of the mansion. Taking a walk outside, Angela delivered a soliloquy (written by Wyman herself) that brought the series to a conclusion, mentioning past characters and events, but looking forward to the future. The final scene of the series shows her raising her glass to the land: &quot;A toast to you, Falcon Crest, and long may you live.&quot;

===Planned revival===
Following the relaunch of &quot;Dallas&quot; in 2012, it was reported that stars of &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; had been approached about appearing in a revival of their show. It was proposed that the series would focus on Cole Gioberti (William Moses) and Richard Channing (David Selby). However, plans for a new series never came to fruition.

===Turkish adaptation===

<text>Atorvastatin, sold under the brand name Lipitor among others, is a statin medication used to prevent cardiovascular disease in those at high risk and to treat abnormal lipid levels. For the prevention of cardiovascular disease, statins are a first-line treatment. It is taken by mouth.

Common side effects include joint pain, diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, and muscle pains. Serious side effects may include rhabdomyolysis, liver problems, and diabetes. Use during pregnancy may harm the fetus. Like all statins, atorvastatin works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme found in the liver that plays a role in producing cholesterol.

Atorvastatin was patented in 1986, and approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 109million prescriptions filled for over 27 million people. In Australia, it was one of the top ten most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023.

==Medical uses==
The primary uses of atorvastatin are for the treatment of dyslipidemia and for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

===Dyslipidemia===
* Hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson types IIa and IIb) to reduce total cholesterol, LDL-C, apo-B, triglycerides levels, and CRP as well as increase HDL levels.
* Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in children
* Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
* Hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson Type IV)
* Primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson Type III)
* Combined hyperlipidemia

===Cardiovascular disease===
* Primary prevention of heart attack, stroke, and need for revascularization procedures in people who have risk factors such as age, smoking, high blood pressure, low HDL-C, and a family history of early heart disease, but have not yet developed evidence of coronary artery disease.
* Secondary prevention of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, major coronary events, ischaemic heart disease and revascularization in people with established coronary artery disease. The effect is dose dependent and is amplified at higher doses. Close monitoring of liver function tests is required when high doses is used.
* Myocardial infarction and stroke prevention in people with type 2 diabetes

A 2014 meta-analysis showed high-dose statin therapy was significantly superior compared to moderate or low-intensity statin therapy in reducing plaque volume in people with acute coronary syndrome. The SATURN trial, which compared the effects of high-dose atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, also confirmed these findings.

===Kidney disease===
There is evidence from systematic review and meta-analyses that statins, particularly atorvastatin, reduce both decline in kidney function (eGFR) and the severity of protein excretion in urine, with higher doses having greater effect. Data are conflicting for whether statins reduce risk of kidney failure. Statins, including atorvastatin, before heart surgery do not prevent acute kidney injury.

Prior to contrast medium (CM) administration, pre-treatment with atorvastatin therapy can reduce the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) in people with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR &lt; 60mL/min/1.73m2) who undergo interventional procedures such as cardiac catheterisation, coronary angiography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A meta-analysis of 21 RCTs confirmed that high dose (80 mg) atorvastatin therapy is more effective than regular dose or low dose statin therapy at preventing CI-AKI. Atorvastatin therapy can also help to prevent in-hospital dialysis post CM administration, however there is no evidence that it reduces all-cause mortality associated with CI-AKI. Overall, the evidence concludes that statin therapy, irrespective of the dose, is still more effective than no treatment or placebo at reducing the risk of CI-AKI.

===Administration===
Statins (predominantly simvastatin) have been evaluated in clinical trials in combination with fibrates to manage dyslipidemia in people who also have type 2 diabetes, and a high cardiovascular disease risk; however, there is limited clinical benefit noted for most cardiovascular outcomes.

Statins with shorter half-lives are more effective when taken in the evening, so their peak effect occurs when the body&#x27;s natural cholesterol production is at its highest. A recent meta-analysis suggested that statins with longer half-lives, including atorvastatin, may also be more effective at lowering LDL cholesterol if taken in the evening. However, the only study included in the meta-analysis of atorvastatin in people with heart disease did not specifically investigate if morning or evening dosing was more effective for reducing LDL cholesterol. The trial did confirm that, irrespective of dosing time, atorvastatin is very effective at reducing total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and increasing HDL cholesterol levels. Hence, atorvastatin should be taken at the same time each day, at a time that is most convenient for the patient, so it does not compromise compliance.

===Specific populations===
* Geriatric: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin in healthy elderly subjects are higher than those in young adults. However, clinical data suggests there is a similar reduction of LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular events at any dose in this population and adults younger than 65 years of age.
* Pediatric: Pharmacokinetic data is not available for this population.
* Gender: Plasma concentrations are generally higher in women than in men, but there is no clinically significant difference in the extent of LDL reduction between men and women.
* Kidney impairment: Kidney disease has no statistically significant influence on plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and dose adjustment considerations should only be made in context of the patient&#x27;s overall health.
* Hemodialysis: Although there has been moderate-to-high quality of evidence to show the lack of clear and significant clinical benefits of statins (including atorvastatin at a dose of 20mg) minimizing non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality in adults on hemodialysis (including those with diabetes and/or pre-existing cardiovascular diseases) despite the clinically relevant reduction in total/LDL cholesterol levels, there is evidence that people undergoing hemodialysis who received moderate intensity statin therapy had a lower risk of all-cause mortality.
* However, data (post hoc analysis) on atorvastatin has revealed that it may still be beneficial in reducing combined cardiac events, cardiac and all-cause mortality in those with a higher baseline LDL cholesterol &gt;3.75 mmol/L. While the SHARP study suggested that LDL cholesterol-lowering treatments (e.g. statin/ezetimibe combination) are effective in reducing the risks of major atherosclerotic events in people with CKD including those on dialysis, the subgroup analysis of the people undergoing hemodialysis had revealed no significant benefits. Whether or not hemodialysis has any impact on the statin levels was not specifically addressed in these major trials.
* Liver impairment: Increased drug levels can be seen in people with advanced cirrhosis. Despite these concerns, a 2017 systematic review and analysis of available evidence has shown that statins, such as atorvastatin, are relatively safe to use in stable, asymptomatic cirrhosis and may even reduce the risk of liver disease progression and death.

==Contraindications==
* Active liver disease: cholestasis, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatitis, and jaundice
* Pregnancy: Atorvastatin is unlikely to cause fetal anomalies but may be associated with low birth weight and preterm labor.
* Breastfeeding: Small amounts of other statin medications have been found to pass into breast milk, although atorvastatin has not been studied specifically. Due to risk of disrupting a breastfeeding infant&#x27;s metabolism of lipids, atorvastatin is not regarded as compatible with breastfeeding.
* Markedly elevated CPK levels or if a myopathy is suspected or diagnosed after dosing of atorvastatin has begun. Very rarely, atorvastatin may cause rhabdomyolysis, and it may be very serious leading to acute kidney injury due to myoglobinuria. When rhabdomyolysis is suspected or diagnosed, atorvastatin therapy is discontinued immediately. The likelihood of developing a myopathy is increased by the co-administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, niacin, and azole antifungals.

==Side effects==

===Major===
* Type 2 diabetes is observed in a small number of people, and is an uncommon class effect of all statins. It appears it may be more likely in people who were already at a higher risk of developing diabetes before starting a statin due to multiple risk factors, for example raised fasting glucose levels. However, the benefits of statin therapy in preventing fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal coronary heart disease, and non-fatal myocardial infarction are significant. For most people the benefits of statin therapy far outweigh the risk of developing diabetes. A 2010 meta-analysis demonstrated that every 255 people treated with a statin for four years produced a reduction of 5.4 major coronary events and induced only one new case of diabetes.
* In some case and clinical studies mild muscle pain or weakness have been reported (around 3%), compared to a placebo. However, this increase was not related to statin therapy in 90% of cases in a large meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. In patients taking higher statin doses, a similarly low increase in muscle pain and weakness was present (5%) with no clear evidence of a dose-response relationship. Duration of treatment with atorvastatin is unlikely to increase the risk of muscle-related side effects as most occur within the first year of treatment, after which the risk is not increased further. The known cardiovascular benefits of atorvastatin over time outweigh the low risk of muscle-related side effects.
* Statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is rare, occurring in less than 0.1% of people who take statins. Statin induced rhabdomyolysis, as with other statin associated muscle symptoms, occurs most commonly in the first year of treatment but can occur at any time during treatment. Risk factors for statin induced rhabdomyolysis include older age, renal impairment, high dose statins and use of medications that reduce the breakdown of statins (such as CYP3A4 inhibitors) or fibrates.
* Persistent liver enzyme abnormalities (usually elevated in hepatic transaminases) have been documented. Elevations threefold greater than normal were recorded in 0.5% of people treated with atorvastatin 10 mg-80 mg rather than placebo. Usage instructions in package inserts for this statin define the requirement that hepatic function be assessed with laboratory tests before beginning atorvastatin treatment and repeated periodically as clinically indicated - usually a clinicians&#x27; judgement. Package inserts for this statin recommend actions should liver abnormalities be detected. Ultimately, this is the judgment of the prescribing physician.

===Common===
The following have been shown to occur in 1–10% of people taking atorvastatin in clinical trials:
* Joint pain
* Loose stools
* Indigestion
* Muscle pain
* Nausea

===Other===
* muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness
* lack of energy or extreme tiredness and weakness
* fever
* chest pain
* unusual bleeding or bruising
* loss of appetite
* pain in the upper right part of the stomach
* flu-like symptoms
* dark colored urine
* yellowing of the skin or eyes
* rash
* hives
* itching
* difficulty breathing or swallowing
* swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs
* hoarseness

==== Increased fasting blood glucose ====
Atorvastatin has been associated with a small increase in fasting blood glucose levels over a 2-year period, particularly in patients with Type 2 Diabetes, however evidence is conflicting and clinical significance of this increase has not been determined. Regular blood glucose monitoring may be advised in patients with Type 2 Diabetes.

==== Cognitive ====
There have been rare reports of reversible memory loss and confusion with all statins, including atorvastatin; however, there has not been enough evidence to associate statin use with cognitive impairment, and the risks for cognition are likely outweighed by the beneficial effects of adherence to statin therapy on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.

====Pancreatitis====
A 2012 meta-analysis found that statin therapy might reduce the risk of pancreatitis in people with normal or mildly elevated blood triglyceride levels.

====Erectile dysfunction====
Statins seem to have a positive effect on erectile dysfunction.

=== Interactions ===
Fibrates are a class of drugs that can be used for severe or refractory mixed hyperlipidaemia in combination with statins or as monotherapy. While studies have suggested that the combined use of statins and the fibrate drug class (such as gemfibrozil, fenofibrate) may increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, there is insufficient evidence to firmly establish this association with atorvastatin.

Co-administration of atorvastatin with one of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This is less likely to happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.

Antacids can rarely decrease the plasma concentrations of statin medications, but do not affect the LDL-C-lowering efficacy.

Niacin also is proved to increase the risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis.

Some statins may also alter the concentrations of other medications, such as warfarin or digoxin, leading to alterations in effect or a requirement for clinical monitoring. The increase in digoxin levels due to atorvastatin is a 1.2 fold elevation in the area under the curve (AUC), resulting in a minor drug-drug interaction. The American Heart Association states that the combination of digoxin and atorvastatin is reasonable. In contrast to some other statins, atorvastatin does not interact with warfarin concentrations in a clinically meaningful way (similar to pitavastatin).

Vitamin D supplementation lowers atorvastatin and active metabolite concentrations, yet synergistically reduces LDL and total cholesterol concentrations.

Grapefruit juice components are known inhibitors of intestinal CYP3A4. Drinking grapefruit juice with atorvastatin may cause an increase in Cmax and area under the curve (AUC). This finding initially gave rise to concerns of toxicity, and in 2000, it was recommended that people taking atorvastatin should not consume grapefruit juice &quot;in an unsupervised manner.&quot; Small studies (using mostly young participants) examining the effects of grapefruit juice consumption on mainly lower doses of atorvastatin have shown that grapefruit juice increases blood levels of atorvastatin, which could increase the risk of adverse effects. No studies assessing the impact of grapefruit juice consumption have included participants taking the highest dose of atorvastatin (80 mg daily), which is often prescribed for people with a history of cardiovascular disease (such as heart attack or ischaemic stroke) or in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease. People taking atorvastatin should consult with their doctor or pharmacist before consuming grapefruit juice, as the effects of grapefruit juice consumption on atorvastatin will vary according to factors such as the amount and frequency of juice consumption in addition to differences in juice components, quality and method of juice preparation between different batches or brands.

A few cases of myopathy have been reported when atorvastatin is given with colchicine.

==Mechanism of action==
As with other statins, atorvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Unlike most others, however, it is a completely synthetic compound. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the reduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, which is the rate-limiting step in hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. Inhibition of the enzyme decreases &quot;de novo&quot; cholesterol synthesis, increasing expression of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDL receptors) on hepatocytes. This increases LDL uptake by the hepatocytes, decreasing the amount of LDL-cholesterol in the blood. Like other statins, atorvastatin also reduces blood levels of triglycerides and slightly increases levels of HDL-cholesterol.

In people with acute coronary syndrome, high-dose atorvastatin treatment may play a plaque-stabilizing role. At high doses, statins have anti-inflammatory effects, incite reduction of the necrotic plaque core, and improve endothelial function, leading to plaque stabilization and, sometimes, plaque regression. There is a similar thought process with using high-dose atorvastatin as a form of secondary thrombotic stroke recurrence prevention.

===Pharmacodynamics===
The liver is the primary site of action of atorvastatin, as this is the principal site of both cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. It is the dosage of atorvastatin, rather than systemic medication concentration, which correlates with extent of LDL-C reduction. In a Cochrane systematic review the dose-related magnitude of atorvastatin on blood lipids was determined. Over the dose range of 10 to 80 mg/day total cholesterol was reduced by 27.0% to 37.9%, LDL cholesterol by 37.1% to 51.7% and triglycerides by 18.0% to 28.3%.

==Pharmacokinetics==
===Absorption===
Atorvastatin undergoes rapid absorption when taken orally, with an approximate time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of 1–2 h. The absolute bioavailability of the medication is about 14%, but the systemic availability for HMG-CoA reductase activity is approximately 30%. Atorvastatin undergoes high intestinal clearance and first-pass metabolism, which is the main cause for the low systemic availability. Administration of atorvastatin with food produces a 25% reduction in Cmax (rate of absorption) and a 9% reduction in AUC (extent of absorption), although food does not affect the plasma LDL-C-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin. Evening dose administration is known to reduce the Cmax and AUC by 30% each. However, time of administration does not affect the plasma LDL-C-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin.

===Distribution===
The mean volume of distribution of atorvastatin is approximately 381 L. It is highly protein bound (≥98%), and studies have shown it is likely secreted in human breastmilk.

===Metabolism===
Atorvastatin metabolism is primarily through cytochrome P450 3A4 hydroxylation to form active ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites, as well as various beta-oxidation metabolites. The ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites are responsible for 70% of systemic HMG-CoA reductase activity. The ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further metabolism via glucuronidation. As a substrate for the CYP3A4 isozyme, it has shown susceptibility to inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 to produce increased or decreased plasma concentrations, respectively. This interaction was tested &quot;in vitro&quot; with concurrent administration of erythromycin, a known CYP3A4 isozyme inhibitor, which resulted in increased plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. It is also an inhibitor of cytochrome 3A4.

===Excretion===
Atorvastatin is primarily eliminated via hepatic biliary excretion, with less than 2% recovered in the urine. Bile elimination follows hepatic and/or extrahepatic metabolism. There does not appear to be any entero-hepatic recirculation. Atorvastatin has an approximate elimination half-life of 14 hours. Noteworthy, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity appears to have a half-life of 20–30 hours, which is thought to be due to the active metabolites. Atorvastatin is also a substrate of the intestinal P-glycoprotein efflux transporter, which pumps the medication back into the intestinal lumen during medication absorption.

In hepatic insufficiency, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are significantly affected by concurrent liver disease. People with Child-Pugh Stage A liver disease show a four-fold increase in both Cmax and AUC. People with Child Pugh stage B liver disease show a 16-fold increase in Cmax and an 11-fold increase in AUC.

Geriatric people (&gt;65years old) exhibit altered pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin compared to young adults, with mean AUC and Cmax values that are 40% and 30% higher, respectively. Additionally, healthy elderly people show a greater pharmacodynamic response to atorvastatin at any dose; therefore, this population may have lower effective doses.

==Pharmacogenetics==
Several genetic polymorphisms may be linked to an increase in statin-related side effects with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLCO1B1 gene showing a 45 fold higher incidence of statin related myopathy than people without the polymorphism.

There are several studies showing genetic variants and variable response to atorvastatin. The polymorphisms that showed genome wide significance in Caucasian population were the SNPs in the apoE region; rs445925, rs7412, rs429358 and rs4420638 which showed variable LDL-c response depending on the genotype when treated with atorvastatin. Another genetic variant that showed genome wide significance in Caucasians was the SNP rs10455872 in the LPA gene that lead to higher Lp(a) levels which cause an apparent lower LDL-c response to atorvastatin. These studies were in Caucasian population, more research with a large cohort need to be conducted in different ethnicities to identify more polymorphisms that can affect atorvastatin pharmacokinetics and treatment response.

==Chemical synthesis==

The first synthesis of atorvastatin at Parke-Davis that occurred during drug discovery was racemic followed by chiral chromatographic separation of the enantiomers. An early enantioselective route to atorvastatin made use of an ester chiral auxiliary to set the stereochemistry of the first of the two alcohol functional groups via a diastereoselective aldol reaction.

Once the compound entered pre-clinical development, process chemistry developed a cost-effective and scalable synthesis. In atorvastatin&#x27;s case, a key element of the overall synthesis was ensuring stereochemical purity in the final drug substance, and hence establishing the first stereocenter became a key aspect of the overall design. The final commercial production of atorvastatin relied on a chiral pool approach, where the stereochemistry of the first alcohol functional group was carried into the synthesis—through the choice of isoascorbic acid, an inexpensive and easily sourced plant-derived natural product.

The &quot;atorvastatin calcium&quot; complex involves two atorvastatin ions, one calcium ion and three water molecules.

==History==
Bruce Roth, who was hired by Warner-Lambert as a chemist in 1982, had synthesized an &quot;experimental compound&quot; codenamed CI 981 – later called atorvastatin. It was first made in August 1985. Warner-Lambert management was concerned that atorvastatin was a me-too version of rival Merck &amp; Co.&#x27;s orphan drug lovastatin (brand name Mevacor). Mevacor, which was first marketed in 1987, was the industry&#x27;s first statin and Merck&#x27;s synthetic version – simvastatin – was in the advanced stages of development. Nevertheless, Bruce Roth and his bosses, Roger Newton and Ronald Cresswell, in 1985, convinced company executives to move the compound into expensive clinical trials. Early results comparing atorvastatin to simvastatin demonstrated that atorvastatin appeared more potent and with fewer side effects.

In 1994, the findings of a Merck-funded study were published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; concluding the efficacy of statins in lowering cholesterol proving for the first time not only that a &quot;statin reduced &#x27;bad&#x27; LDL cholesterol but also that it led to a sharp drop in fatal heart attacks among people with heart disease.&quot;

In 1996, Warner-Lambert entered into a co-marketing agreement with Pfizer to sell Lipitor, and in 2000, Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert for $90.2billion. Lipitor was on the market by 1996. By 2003, Lipitor had become the best selling pharmaceutical in the United States. From 1996 to 2012, under the trade name Lipitor, atorvastatin became the world&#x27;s best-selling medication of all time, with more than $125billion in sales over approximately 14.5years. and $13 billion a year at its peak, Lipitor alone &quot;provided up to a quarter of Pfizer Inc.&#x27;s annual revenue for years.&quot;

Pfizer&#x27;s patent on atorvastatin expired in November 2011.

== Society and culture ==
=== Economics ===
Atorvastatin is relatively inexpensive. Under provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in the United States, health plans may cover the costs of atorvastatin 10 mg and 20 mg for adults aged 40–75 years based on United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations. Some plans only cover other statins.

===Brand names===

Atorvastatin calcium tablets are sold under the brand name Lipitor. Pfizer also packages the medication in combination with other medications, such as atorvastatin/amlodipine.

Pfizer&#x27;s U.S. patent on Lipitor expired on 30 November 2011. Initially, generic atorvastatin was manufactured only by Watson Pharmaceuticals and India&#x27;s Ranbaxy Laboratories. Prices for the generic version did not drop to the level of other generics—$10 or less for a month&#x27;s supply—until other manufacturers began to supply the medication in May 2012.

In other countries, atorvastatin calcium is made in tablet form by generic medication makers under various brand names including Atoris, Atorlip, Atorva, Atorvastatin Teva, Atorvastatina Parke-Davis, Avas, Cardyl, Liprimar, Litorva, Mactor, Orbeos, Prevencor, Sortis, Stator, Tahor, Torid, Torvacard, Torvast, Totalip, Tulip, Xarator, and Zarator. Pfizer also makes its own generic version under the name Zarator.

In the US, Lipitor is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer.

===Medication recalls===
On 9 November 2012, Indian drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. voluntarily recalled 10-, 20- and 40-mg doses of its generic version of atorvastatin in the United States. The lots of atorvastatin, packaged in bottles of 90 and 500 tablets, were recalled due to possible contamination with very small glass particles similar to the size of a grain of sand (less than 1mm in size). The FDA received no reports of injury from the contamination. Ranbaxy also issued recalls of bottles of 10-milligram tablets in August 2012 and March 2014, due to concerns that the bottles might contain larger, 20-milligram tablets and thus cause potential dosing errors.

<doc id="634623" wikidata="Q2630106" url="?curid=634623" title="Lunar (series)">
<text>is a role-playing video game franchise created by Game Arts and Studio Alex. The series takes place on the titular moon, which orbits an uninhabitable planet known as &quot;The Blue Star&quot;.

The series began with &quot;&quot;, first released in 1992 for the Sega CD, and was followed by &quot;&quot; in 1994. Both titles received critical and commercial acclaim, later becoming the first and second-highest selling games on the platform in Japan respectively. Both games were later remade for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete&quot;. Further remakes of the first game were released for the Game Boy Advance and PlayStation Portable.

Spin-offs were also released, including &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

==Plot==
The &quot;Lunar&quot; stories take place on an inhabitable moon called Lunar, or &quot;The Silver Star&quot;, that orbits a planet known as &quot;The Blue Star&quot;. Thousands of years ago, the Blue Star was infected with evil by a dark god named Zophar. His evil corrupted the hearts of people, turning some into monsters to do his bidding. The survivors cried out to the patron-deity of the Blue Star, a Goddess named Althena, for help. She confronted Zophar in an epic battle, and was only able to stop him by using her powers of creation to seal him in another dimension, destroying nearly all life on the planet in the process.

Unable to restore the planet until several millennia had passed, Althena instead chose to transform the planet&#x27;s moon into an earthlike world, and transported the survivors there. These included not only humans but also a race of &quot;beast-men&quot;, and another race of elf-like beings skilled in wielding magic. The only elf-like being depicted in &quot;Lunar&quot; is Ghaleon, who is a confirmed member of the Vile Tribe in &quot;Lunar: Vane Hikuusen Monogatari&quot;, which is mysteriously classified here as a &quot;fourth race&quot;, despite there being only three. There was also a fourth race of people who would later come to be known as &quot;The Vile Tribe&quot; after they rejected Althena&#x27;s teachings. She was forced to banish them to an area of Lunar called &quot;The Frontier&quot;, a barren wasteland where even Althena&#x27;s magical power could not reach. They became enemies of Althena and her followers for thousands of years.

To protect Lunar, Althena created four intelligent Dragons – a white one, a red one, a blue one, and a black one – that each shared a part of her divine power. There are only four Dragons at any given time, though they are replaced over time with younger ones. Strangely, during their infancy, these dragons resemble talking, winged cats, until they claim the power of their predecessor and ascend to adulthood. The Dragons spend most of their time sleeping underground until they are needed.

Althena also decreed that there would be a champion called The Dragonmaster to lead Lunar&#x27;s heroes. This person would be anyone who managed to make their way to the hidden lairs of the Four Dragons, and pass their harrowing trials. There have been many Dragonmasters across the centuries, and many on Lunar have striven to achieve that title. The people of Lunar became very devoted to Althena, though many remember Lunar&#x27;s origins as only an old legend. The various &quot;Lunar&quot; games and manga cover different events in Lunar&#x27;s history.

==Games==
===Main series===
====&quot;The Silver Star&quot;====
Lunar: The Silver Star was first released on June 26, 1992, in Japan for the Sega CD. The game follows Alex, a young boy from a small town who dreams of one day becoming a great hero like his idol, Dragonmaster Dyne. Making use of the CD-ROM format, the game features CD-quality music, full motion video and voice acting. 

Working Designs handled the English localization, releasing the game in December 1993 in North America. It was a critical and commercial success, becoming the best selling title on the platform in Japan, and second highest-selling overall.

====&quot;Eternal Blue&quot;====
Lunar: Eternal Blue was first released on December 22, 1994, in Japan for the Sega CD. Taking place a thousand years after the events of the first game, it follows Hiro, a young adventurer, and Lucia, a girl from the far-away planet Blue Star, as they try to stop an evil, all-powerful being from destroying the world.

Compared to its predecessor, &quot;Eternal Blue&quot; features twice the text and over four times the amount of original animation. Working Designs handled the English localization once more, releasing the game in September 1995 in North America. While the game was well received, it sold less copies than &quot;The Silver Star&quot;, which was mostly attributed to it being a late release for the platform.

====&quot;Silver Star Story Complete&quot;====
Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete was first released on October 25, 1996, in Japan for the Sega Saturn. A version with higher-quality video via the Video CD card add-on was released a year later. The game is a remake of &quot;The Silver Star&quot; with an expanded scenario and improved graphics and sound. While the original Sega CD version included roughly ten minutes of animation, the remake features fifty minutes of new, fully animated cutscenes by Studio Gonzo.

The game was ported to the PlayStation on May 28, 1998, with an English release by Working Designs arriving a year later. A Windows version was released for the Japanese and Korean markets, with a North American release eventually scrapped. It received generally positive reviews.

Versions for iOS and Android were released in 2012 and 2024 respectively, as Lunar: Silver Star Story Touch. 

====&quot;Eternal Blue Complete&quot;====
Lunar: Eternal Blue Complete was first released on July 23, 1998, in Japan for the Sega Saturn. The game is a remake of &quot;Eternal Blue&quot; with an expanded scenario and improved graphics and sound, much like &quot;Silver Star Story Complete&quot; before it. A PlayStation version followed on May 27, 1999, with an English release by Working Designs arriving a year later, on December 15, 2000. It received generally positive reviews.

====&quot;Legend&quot;====
Lunar Legend was first released on April 12, 2002, in Japan for the Game Boy Advance. The game is a remake of &quot;The Silver Star&quot;, largely based on &quot;Silver Star Story Complete&quot;, with some alterations. The English localization was handled by Ubisoft, with the game releasing on December 10, 2002, in North America.

Due to limitations of the cartridge format, many features standard to the series such as voice acting and FMV were omitted, with the developers instead utilizing real-time cutscenes using larger, more detailed character sprites to tell the story. Still images taken directly from &quot;Silver Star Story Complete&quot;&#x27;s cutscenes appear at certain points during the game to give it a more cinematic feel. It received generally positive reviews.

====&quot;Silver Star Harmony&quot;====
Lunar: Silver Star Harmony was first released on November 12, 2009, in Japan for the PlayStation Portable. The game is a remake of &quot;The Silver Star&quot;. While it retains the animated cutscenes from &quot;Silver Star Story Complete&quot;, it features a new playable prologue, a more talkative main character, a remixed soundtrack, and newly recorded voice acting and English localization by Xseed Games. It received generally positive reviews.

====&quot;Remastered Collection&quot;====
Lunar Remastered Collection is an upcoming two-game remastered compilation which was announced on September 24, 2024 that is currently set to release on April 18, 2025. This collection contains &quot;Silver Star Story Complete&quot; and &quot;Eternal Blue Complete&quot;. It is set for release on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S, which will be produced by GungHo Online Entertainment.

===Spin-offs===
====&quot;Sanposuru Gakuen&quot;====
Lunar: Sanposuru Gakuen was first released on January 12, 1996, in Japan for the Game Gear. The game follows a young girl named Ellie and her best friend, Lena, as they leave their quiet lives in the town of Burg to enroll in a newly established magic school located on an island called Ien. A remake titled Mahō Gakuen Lunar! was released a year later for the Sega Saturn. 

While neither has received an official English release, a fan-translation patch for the Game Gear version was released in 2009.

====&quot;All the Lunar&quot;====
All the Lunar: Hyper Applications was first released in July 1999, in Japan for Windows. Rather than being a traditional game, the CD-ROM contains a variety of software for Windows-based operational systems, as well as wallpapers, art galleries and a digital daifugō card game with characters from &quot;Silver Star Story&quot; and &quot;Eternal Blue&quot;.

====&quot;Dragon Song&quot;====
Lunar: Dragon Song, known in Japan and Europe as Lunar Genesis, was first released on August 25, 2005, in Japan for the Nintendo DS. Taking place a thousand years before the events of &quot;The Silver Star&quot;, the game follows Jian Campbell, a young delivery boy and adventurer who must save the world from the rising menace of the Vile Tribe. Notably, it was the first game in the series to be released in Europe. It received mixed reviews

==Reception==

The &quot;Lunar&quot; series has spawned a variety of other works in the setting, including a manga series, two artbooks, as well as novelizations of &quot;The Silver Star&quot;, &quot;Magic School Lunar!&quot; and &quot;Eternal Blue&quot;. The console titles have generally been received very positively; the two PlayStation versions generally place well in considerations of the best games available for the system. The original two games, and their remakes, have reviewed very well, averaging between 82% and 91%, and with &quot;Eternal Blue&quot; generally agreed to be the highest-reviewed Sega CD title in the history of the platform. &quot;Lunar Dragon Song&quot;, however, was panned critically, with an aggregate rating of 58% on GameRankings.

===Sales===
The series has sold over one million copies, placing it among the best-selling Japanese role-playing game franchises.

Total sales of &quot;Lunar&quot; franchise 1,052,011:
* &quot;&quot; (Sega CD) 100,000 (Japan)
* &quot;&quot; (Sega CD) 89,480 (Japan)
* &quot;&quot; (Sega Saturn) 200,035 (original release) in Japan; 8,346 (MPEG Version) in Japan
* &quot;&quot; (Sega Saturn) 90,837 (Japan)
* &quot;&quot; (Sega Saturn) 15,999 (Japan)
* &quot;&quot; (PlayStation) 44,802 (Japan)
* &quot;&quot; (PlayStation) 53,983 (Japan)
* PlayStation releases 393,000 (US)
* &quot;Lunar Legend&quot; (Game Boy Advance) 13,506 (Japan)
* &quot;&quot; (Nintendo DS) 24,673 (Japan)
* &quot;&quot; (PSP) 17,350 (Japan)

==Abandoned sequel==
Since the release of the enhanced remakes of &quot;Lunar: Silver Star Story&quot; and &quot;Lunar 2: Eternal Blue&quot;, rumors have come and gone concerning the development of a game known only as &quot;Lunar 3&quot;. In a 1998 interview, Victor Ireland, president of Working Designs, stated that &quot;Lunar 3&quot; was in the design phase. However, no such game was ever revealed by Game Arts or Entertainment Software Publishing, the Japanese publisher of the series. At the time Ireland, as part of a feud with Sega of America, repeatedly brought up during interviews that Working Designs held the American publication rights to the &quot;Lunar&quot; series and would only publish the games for non-Sega consoles, even threatening to port the games to competing consoles themselves if they were released exclusively for Sega consoles in Japan.

<doc id="634625" wikidata="Q836862" url="?curid=634625" title="Installation (computer programs)">
<text>Installation (or setup) of a computer program (including device drivers and plugins), is the act of making the program ready for execution. Installation refers to the particular configuration of software or hardware with a view to making it usable with the computer. A soft or digital copy of the piece of software (program) is needed to install it. There are different processes of installing a piece of software (program). Because the process varies for each program and each computer, programs (including operating systems) often come with an &quot;installer&quot;, a specialised program responsible for doing whatever is needed (see below) for the installation. Installation may be part of a larger software deployment process.

Installation typically involves code (program) being copied/generated from the installation files to new files on the local computer for easier access by the operating system, creating necessary directories, registering environment variables, providing a separate program for un-installation etc. Because code is generally copied/generated in multiple locations, uninstallation usually involves more than just erasing the program folder. For example, registry files and other system code may need to be modified or deleted for a complete uninstallation.

==Overview==
Some computer programs can be executed by simply copying them into a folder stored on a computer and executing them. Other programs are supplied in a form unsuitable for immediate execution and therefore need an installation procedure. Once installed, the program can be executed again and again, without the need to reinstall before each execution.

Common operations performed during software installations include:
* Making sure that necessary system requirements are met
* Checking for existing versions of the software
* Creating or updating program files and folders
* Adding configuration data such as configuration files, Windows registry entries or environment variables
* Making the software accessible to the user, for instance by creating links, shortcuts or bookmarks
* Configuring components that run automatically, such as daemons or Windows services
* Performing product activation
* Updating the software versions
These operations may require some charges or be free of charge. In case of payment, installation costs means the costs connected and relevant to or incurred as a result of installing the drivers or the equipment in the customers&#x27; premises.

Some installers may attempt to trick users into installing junkware such as various forms of adware, toolbars, trialware or software of partnering companies. To prevent this, extra caution on what exactly is being asked to be installed is needed. The installation of additional software then can simply be skipped or unchecked (this may require the user to use the &quot;custom&quot;, &quot;detailed&quot; or &quot;expert&quot; version of the installation procedure).Such malicious conduct is not necessarily a decision by the software developers or their company but can also be an issue of external installers such as the Download.com installer by CNET.

==Zero-install and portable applications==
As mentioned earlier, some computer programs need no installation. This was once usual for many programs which run on DOS, the classic Mac OS, Atari TOS and AmigaOS. As computing environments grew more complex and fixed hard drives replaced floppy disks, the need for tangible installation presented itself. For example Commodore released the Installer for Amiga.

The modern applications that can be run without going through formal process of installation and, in particular, do not require modifications of the operating system, are sometimes referred to as zero-install. Zero-install can be achieved through multiple means:
* a &quot;normal&quot; solution is to collect the application and its components together, copy them to a fixed directory, and run from there. In the case of Windows OS this approach is occasionally referred to as an &quot;xcopy deployment&quot;;
* a browser-based approach;
* utilizing a specialized tool, like Zero Install.

The Linux distribution GoboLinux takes a similar approach (each applications gets its own directory structure), but still introduces the side-effects of the traditional Linux installation to maintain the backward compatibility with the standard Linux directory layout. Isolation of the OS from any changes required by the application can also be achieved through the application virtualization tools, like VMware ThinApp, Microsoft App-V, InstallFree Bridge.

A class of modern applications that do not need installation and are located on a detachable storage device are known as &quot;portable applications&quot;, as they may be moved around onto different computers and run. Similarly, there are &quot;live operating systems&quot;, which do not need installation and can be run directly from a bootable CD, DVD, USB flash drive or loaded over the network as with thin clients. Examples are AmigaOS 4.0, various Linux distributions, MorphOS or Mac OS versions 1.0 through 9.0. (See live CD and live USB.) Finally, web applications, which run inside a web browser, do not need installation.

==Types==
===Custom installation===
A custom installation allows the installer to choose to select components or parts that are required to be installed.
This is sometimes preferred as opposed to installing the full suite of software components. Some situations that require
the need for a custom install might be where only the basic components are required which are smaller in size instead of the
full components which may take up too much hard drive space.

===Attended installation===
On Windows systems, this is the most common form of installation. An installation process usually needs a user who attend it to make choices, such as accepting or declining an end-user license agreement (EULA), specifying preferences such as the installation location, supplying passwords or assisting in product activation. In graphical environments, installers that offer a wizard-based interface are common. Attended installers may ask users to help mitigate the errors. For instance, if the disk in which the computer program is being installed was full, the installer may ask the user to specify another target path or clear enough space in the disk. A common misconception is unarchivation, which is not considered an installation action because it does not include user choices, such as accepting or declining EULA.

===Silent installation===
A &quot;silent installation&quot; is an installation that does not display messages or windows during its progress. &quot;Silent installation&quot; is not the same as &quot;unattended installation&quot; (see below): All silent installations are unattended but not all unattended installations are silent. The reason behind a silent installation may be convenience or subterfuge. Malware and viruses can be installed silently when a person clicks on a link while working at a business they think is real but is a hacker&#x27;s program download. For normal users silent installation is not of much use, but in bigger organizations where thousands of users work, deploying the applications becomes a typical task and for that reason silent installation is performed so that the application is installed in the background without affecting the work of the user. Silent parameters can vary from software to software; if a software/application has silent parameters, it can be checked by &quot; &lt;software.exe&gt; /? &quot; or &quot; &lt;software.exe&gt; /help &quot; or &quot; &lt;software.exe&gt; -help &quot;.

Silently installing a software program can be used to deploy a program on networks in educational institutions, including primary and secondary education and universities, in addition to business, government, and corporate networks. The person managing the silent installation can choose to add a desktop shortcut, for example, to silently install Google Drive with a desktop shortcut:
GoogleDrive.exe --silent --desktop_shortcut=true
===Unattended installation===
Installation that is performed without user interaction during its progress or with no user present at all. One of the reasons to use this approach is to automate the installation of a large number of systems. An unattended installation either does not require the user to supply anything or has received all necessary input prior to the start of installation. Such input may be in the form of command line switches or an &quot;answer file&quot;, a file that contains all the necessary parameters. Windows XP and most Linux distributions are examples of operating systems that can be installed with an answer file. In unattended installation, it is assumed that there is no user to help mitigate errors. For instance, if the installation medium was faulty, the installer should fail the installation, as there is no user to fix the fault or replace the medium. Unattended installers may record errors in a computer log for later review.

===Headless installation===
Installation performed without using a computer monitor connected. In attended forms of headless installation, another machine connects to the target machine (for instance, via a local area network) and takes over the display output. Since a headless installation does not need a user at the location of the target computer, unattended headless installers may be used to install a program on multiple machines at the same time.

===Scheduled or automated installation===
An installation process that runs on a preset time or when a predefined condition transpires, as opposed to an installation process that starts explicitly on a user&#x27;s command. For instance, a system administrator willing to install a later version of a computer program that is being used can schedule that installation to occur when that program is not running. An operating system may automatically install a device driver for a device that the user connects. (See plug and play.) Malware may also be installed automatically. For example, the infamous Con ficker was installed when the user plugged an infected device to their computer.

===Clean installation===
A clean installation is one that is done in the absence of any interfering elements such as old versions of the computer program being installed or leftovers from a previous installation. In particular, the clean installation of an operating system is an installation in which the target disk partition is erased before installation. Since the interfering elements are absent, a clean installation may succeed where an unclean installation may fail or may take significantly longer.

===Network installation===
Network installation, shortened net install, is an installation of a program from a shared network resource that may be done by installing a minimal system before proceeding to download further packages over the network. This may simply be a copy of the original media but software publishers which offer site licenses for institutional customers may provide a version intended for installation over a network.

==Installer==

An &quot;installation program&quot; or &quot;installer&quot; is a computer program that installs files, such as applications, drivers, or other software, onto a computer. Some installers are specifically made to install the files they contain; other installers are general-purpose and work by reading the contents of the software package to be installed.

They exist both as &quot;standalone installer&quot; (or &quot;offline installer&quot;) &amp; &quot;web installer&quot; (or &quot;online installer&quot;), where the former allows for offline installation as it contains all installation files, whereas the latter needs to download files necessary for installation from the web at the time of installation.

The differences between a package management system and an installer are:
===Bootstrapper===
During an installation of a computer program, it is sometimes necessary to update the installer or package manager itself. To make this possible, a technique called bootstrapping is used. The common pattern for this is to use small executable files which update the installer and starts the real installation after the update. This small executable is called bootstrapper. Sometimes the bootstrapper installs other prerequisites for the software during the bootstrapping process too.

===Common types===

Cross-platform installer builders produce installers that run on Windows, macOS and Linux. An example is InstallAnywhere by Flexera Software, which is based on Java. An instance of native code is InstallAware Multi Platform by InstallAware Software, featuring build toolchains and a setup engine that runs without dependencies; it can also switch to console mode if a graphical user interface (GUI) cannot be displayed on Linux.

Windows NT family includes an installation API and an associated service called Windows Installer. Microsoft provides a minimum level of tools required to create installers using Windows Installer in the freely available Windows SDK, instead focusing on the API to allow developers and third parties to leverage it in creating custom installers. Third-party tools may supporting create installers using this API to speed the process. Examples include InstallShield (Flexera Software), WiX (Outercurve Foundation) and Advanced Installer. Installation authoring tools that do not rely on Windows Installer include Wise Installation Studio (Wise Solutions, Inc.), Installer VISE (MindVision Software), Visual Installer (SamLogic), NSIS, Clickteam, InnoSetup and InstallSimple. InstallAware for Windows Installer features a hybrid installation engine, whereby a setup may be executed using either the Windows Installer APIs, or directly through InstallAware&#x27;s native code setup engine. This hybrid engine also provides the capability to switch installation modes at runtime.

macOS includes Installer, a native package manager. macOS also includes a separate software updating application, Software Update, that only supports Apple and system software. Included in the Dock as of 10.6.6, and also in the Apple menu, the Mac App Store shares many attributes with the successful App Store for iOS devices, such as a similar app approval process, the use of Apple ID for purchases, and automatic installation and updating. Although the App Store is Apple&#x27;s preferred delivery method for macOS apps, previously purchased licenses cannot be transferred to the Mac App Store for downloading or automatic updating. Instead of an installer, many macOS applications distributed outside the Mac App Store use an Apple Disk Image (.dmg file) that contains an application bundle to be dragged and dropped into the Applications folder; those applications are described as drag-install applications. These often feature prominent installation instructions and a shortcut to the Applications folder; that style of drag-install application was invented and published by Iris Artin (formerly Ben Artin) during the development of Fetch 5 and subsequently gained wide adoption. Commercial applications for macOS may also use a third-party installer, such as the Mac version of Installer VISE (MindVision Software) or InstallerMaker (StuffIt).

===System installer===
A &quot;system installer&quot; is the software that is used to set up and install an operating system onto a device.

Windows Setup is the system installer of Microsoft Windows.

Examples of Linux system installers:

* Anaconda: used by CentOS, Fedora
* Calamares: used by multiple Linux distributions (incl. some Ubuntu flavors, Debian, and derivates)
* Debian-Installer (&quot;D-I&quot;): classic Debian installer (textual and graphical interfaces)
* Subiquity Ubuntu Server installer
* Ubiquity: Ubuntu Desktop installer (until 22.10)
* Ubuntu Desktop Installer: current Ubuntu Desktop installer (starting 23.04)
* YaST for SUSE-based projects

Another example is found in the Haiku operating system, which uses a utility called Haiku Installer to install itself onto a device after booting from a live CD or live USB.

<text>Carl Chun or Karl Friedrich Gustav Chun (1 October 1852 – 11 April 1914) was a German marine biologist who worked as a professor at the University of Königsberg (1883), Breslau (1891) and at Leipzig (1898). He was a pioneer of German oceanographic research, organizing the first deep-sea expedition aboard the &quot;SS Valdivia&quot; in 1898-99. He spent much of his life studying the collections made during the expedition, and was responsible for discovering many marine organisms, including the vampire squid.

== Life and work ==
Chun was born in Höchst, today a part of Frankfurt, where his father Gustav (1827–1907) was rector of the Weißfrauenschule. Chun went to the Lessing Gymnasium and became interested in zoology from an early age thanks to the Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt where he listened to lectures by Fritz Noll, Hermann Theodor Geyler, and Karl von Fritsch. He studied at the University of Göttingen and then at the University of Leipzig, receiving a doctorate in 1874. From 1878 to 1883 he was privat-docent of zoology and an assistant to Rudolf Leuckart. Chun became deeply interested in oceanic organisms and worked at the Naples Zoological Station where he studied and published a monograph on comb jellyfish under Anton Dohrn. He completed his habilitation in Leipzig (1878) and became a professor at the University of Königsberg (1883–1891). He moved to Breslau in 1891 and succeeded Leuckart at Leipzig in 1898.

Deep sea exploration had been popularized by the British &quot;Challenger Expedition&quot; (1872–1876) and the Germans, not to be left behind, funded Chun&#x27;s proposal made in 1897 at the meeting of the Deutsche Naturforscher und Aertze in Leipzig. He led the German deep sea expedition aboard the steamship &quot;SS Valdivia&quot; which left Hamburg on 1 August 1898. They visited Bouvetøya, the Kerguelen Islands, and other islands, before returning to Hamburg, where they arrived on 1 May 1899. The material collected was described in 24 volumes that were published until 1940 with more than 70 specialists involved including Sir John Murray of the Challenger expedition.

In 1888, Chun described seasonal vertical migration (SVM) of oceanic organisms which has a periodicity of ca. 1 year. Chun examined depth-stratified net samples from the Mediterranean Sea. He explained the seasonal disappearance of jellyfish and crustaceans from the upper pelagic layer of the ocean in terms of their migration to depths below 1000 m. In contrast to diel vertical migration (DVM) which occurs daily, SVM is still not well understood. He examined the distribution of phytoplankton with depth and demonstrated that although there were differences in distribution, they were not completely absent at any depth as had been claimed by the contemporary American zoologist Alexander Agassiz. Chun also examined adaptations of the Schizopod eye in relation to depth and light penetration under the sea. With depth, the eye adapted separate lateral and frontal regions. Chun was a specialist on cephalopods and plankton. He discovered and named the vampire squid (&quot;Vampyroteuthis infernalis&quot;, which means &quot;vampire squid from hell&quot;). Chun was also interested in making science accessible to larger audiences. He published in a popular narrative of the &quot;Valdivia&quot; expedition, &quot;Aus den Tiefen des Weltmeeres&quot; (1900) which captured the public imagination of the period.

Chun married Lily, the daughter of Karl Vogt, whom he first met while working at the Naples Zoological Station in 1884. They had two daughters Annie (b. 1885) who married Otto zur Strassen and Lily (born 1887) who became a social democrat and was married to the botanist Ernst Pringsheim Jr. Chun suffered for several years after a deer trophy fell off the wall onto him in November 1908. Shortly after recovering from the injury he developed a heart problem and died on 11 April 1914 in Leipzig, Germany, aged 61.

<doc id="634647" wikidata="Q5302542" url="?curid=634647" title="Dover test">
<text>The Dover test is an informal test and a journalistic phrase to describe whether the general population of the United States is supporting the participation of the United States in a war or other military action by the public reaction to returning war casualties. The test is usually used to support a partisan position concerning the United States government&#x27;s actions rather than to actually determine the level of public support for the war.

==Description==

The test&#x27;s name refers to Dover Air Force Base in Dover, Delaware in the United States. The base is home to the Department of Defense&#x27;s Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs. 50,000 U.S. casualties have arrived at this airport since 1955. An early use of the term &quot;Dover test&quot; was uttered by Senator John Glenn (D-Ohio) in 1994. The Dover test was also explicitly mentioned by Gen. Hugh Shelton in 1999, and again on January 19, 2000 when he said: 

The Dover test is not a formal test, and the consequences are difficult to measure. Some say that certain deduction from the tests can be attained, though. If the United States population continues to support the war after the news coverage, then the U.S. government has passed the Dover test, and continued warfare probably does not reduce the popularity of the government.

If the American population does not continue to support the war, then the government has failed the test, and continued warfare may reduce the popularity of the government. Differing factions may use reactions to the results to further their own motives. Subsequently, the test is used more often to support someone&#x27;s opinion or to question government actions than to actually determine the level of public support for the war.

==History==

===Early examples===
The return of American war casualties created difficulties for the U.S. government for the first time during the Vietnam War, where the public opinion changed against the war during the conflict. On December 21, 1989, during the invasion of Panama, President George Herbert Walker Bush prohibited media coverage of returning casualties, apparently angered by a split screen, showing him giving a news briefing on one half of the screen, and returning caskets on the other half. 

In the first Iraq War, the government banned media outlets from showing any returning deceased at Dover.

===Recent examples===
Operation Restore Hope in Mogadishu, Somalia, could be said to have failed the Dover test after the Battle of Mogadishu on October 3, 1993, when the mutilated bodies of US soldiers were shown on the news. Public support quickly fell and U.S. forces were soon withdrawn. During November 2000, the Clinton administration established a rule prohibiting any press coverage of returning US war casualties. However, this rule was rarely enforced. During the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, photos of returning war casualties were frequently shown on the news.

===Iraq war and post-occupation===
The Dover test was most recently mentioned by the press in regard to the invasion and occupation of Iraq. The Bush administration tried to avoid having to pass the Dover test by enforcing the rule from the end of the Clinton administration. Tami Silicio, a worker for a military contractor in Kuwait took photos of the coffins of returning casualties, which made their way to the front pages. Subsequently she and her husband were terminated by the contractor. Shortly thereafter a journalist from The Memory Hole requested casualty photos under the Freedom of Information Act, and received a number of pictures. Some photographs at the site were later identified as the coffins of Space Shuttle Columbia crewmembers, not military casualties. The Bush administration was displeased, and prohibited the further release of photos to the media.

<doc id="634653" wikidata="Q17052346" url="?curid=634653" title="Springtime for Hitler">
<text>Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp With Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden is a fictional musical play within a play in Mel Brooks&#x27; 1967 film &quot;The Producers&quot;, as well as the stage musical adaptation of the movie and the 2005 movie adaptation of the musical. It is a musical about Adolf Hitler, written by Franz Liebkind, an unbalanced Nazi originally played by Kenneth Mars (and later by Brad Oscar and Will Ferrell in the stage musical and the 2005 film, respectively).

In the original film, the play is chosen by the producer Max Bialystock and his accountant Leo Bloom in their fraudulent scheme to raise substantial funding by selling 25,000% of a play, then causing it to fail, and finally keeping all of the remaining money for themselves. To ensure that the play is a total failure, Max selects an incredibly tasteless script (which he describes as &quot;practically a love letter to Adolf Hitler&quot;), and hires the worst director he can find (Roger DeBris), a stereotypical homosexual and transvestite caricature. He casts an out-of-control hippie named Lorenzo St. Dubois, also known by his initials &quot;L.S.D.&quot;, in the role of Hitler (after he had wandered into the wrong theatre by mistake during the casting call – &quot;That&#x27;s our Hitler!&quot;).

== Synopsis ==

The play starts with the musical number, &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot;. Accompanied by dancing stormtroopers, who at one point form a Busby Berkeley–style swastika, the play immediately horrifies everyone in the audience except the author, and one lone viewer who breaks into applause—only for the latter to get pummeled by other disgusted theatergoers. As the audience begins to storm out of the theater, the first scene starts, with L.S.D. dressed up in full Nazi uniform and talking like a beatnik. The remaining audience starts to laugh, thinking that it is a satire, and those that had left return to the theater.

Franz, disgusted, goes behind the stage, unties the cable holding up the curtain and rushes out on stage, confronting the audience and ranting about the treatment of his beloved play. During his diatribe, there is a clank as someone strikes through the curtain, apparently with a pipe or hammer, hitting the steel Wehrmacht helmet that he is wearing. A moment later, in mid-rant, he exclaims &quot;OW!&quot; and falls over. The play continues, and the audience assumes that his performance was part of the act.

The play gets rave reviews from critics who mistakenly assume it was a work of satire, ensuring its success, as well as the conviction of the producers, once the fraudulent financing is discovered.

== Differences between versions ==
In the musical stage version of &quot;The Producers&quot; and the 2005 musical film based on it, the part of L.S.D. is not included and Hitler is played by the flamboyant director DeBris, who sings a solo, &quot;Heil Myself&quot;, reminiscent of Judy Garland. Author Liebkind is originally chosen by Max to play Hitler but due to an unfortunate accident, he breaks his leg (ironic as the term &#x27;break a leg&#x27; is used to mean &#x27;good luck&#x27; in the theater world) and Max then asks DeBris to play Hitler. The swastika choreography at the end is displayed to the audience via a large mirror that is raised, à la &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. In the climactic final chorus, the 2005 film orchestration quotes the climax of the invasion theme from the first movement of Dimitri Shostakovich&#x27;s Seventh symphony &quot;Leningrad&quot;, depicting the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union. 

In the musical version, Franz does not interrupt the play, but waits until after the performance to confront the producers, and then attempts to kill them under the accusation of breaking the Siegfried Oath by making a fool out of Hitler (&quot;He didn&#x27;t need our help!&quot;). He breaks his other leg while trying to run away from the police.

<doc id="634661" wikidata="Q913700" url="?curid=634661" title="Bridge over Troubled Water (song)">
<text>&quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; is a song by the American folk rock duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel, released in January 1970 as the second single from their fifth studio album, &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; (1970). It was written by Paul Simon and produced by Simon, Art Garfunkel and Roy Halee.

&quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; features lead vocals by Art Garfunkel and a piano accompaniment influenced by gospel music, with a &quot;Wall of Sound&quot;-style production. It was the last song recorded for the album, but the first completed. The instrumentation, provided by the Wrecking Crew, was recorded in California, while Simon and Garfunkel&#x27;s vocals were recorded in New York. Simon felt Garfunkel should sing solo, an invitation Garfunkel initially declined. Session musician Larry Knechtel performs piano, with Joe Osborn playing bass guitar and Hal Blaine on drums.

The song won five awards at the 13th Annual Grammy Awards in 1971, including Grammy Award for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. It is Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s most successful single, topping the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for six weeks, and was the No. 1 song on the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1970. It also hit number one in the United Kingdom, Canada, France and New Zealand. It reached the top five in eight other countries, eventually selling over six million copies worldwide. It became one of the most performed songs of the 20th century, covered by over 50 artists, including Elvis Presley, Aretha Franklin and Johnny Cash. It is ranked number 66 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

==Background==
&quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; was composed by Paul Simon in early 1969; the song came to him very quickly, so much so that he asked himself: &quot;Where did that come from? It doesn&#x27;t seem like me.&quot; The title concept was inspired by Claude Jeter&#x27;s line &quot;I&#x27;ll be your bridge over deep water if you trust in my name,&quot; which Jeter sang with his group, the Swan Silvertones, in the 1959 song &quot;Mary Don&#x27;t You Weep.&quot; According to gospel producer and historian Anthony Heilbut, Simon acknowledged his debt to Jeter in person, and handed Jeter a check. Simon named Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;O Sacred Head, Now Wounded&quot; as inspiration for parts of the melody. Simon wrote the song initially on guitar but transposed it to the piano to reflect the gospel influence and suit Garfunkel&#x27;s voice.

Simon told his partner, Art Garfunkel, that Garfunkel should sing it alone, the &quot;white choirboy way&quot;, though Simon adds harmony on the final verse. Garfunkel felt it was not right for him; he liked Simon&#x27;s falsetto on the demo and suggested that Simon sing. At the suggestion of Garfunkel and producer Roy Halee, Simon wrote an extra verse and a &quot;bigger&quot; ending, though he felt it was less cohesive with the earlier verses. The final verse was written about Simon&#x27;s then-wife Peggy Harper, who had noticed her first gray hairs (&quot;Sail on, silvergirl&quot;). It does not refer to a drug abuser&#x27;s hypodermic needle, as is sometimes claimed. The verse was Garfunkel&#x27;s idea, but Simon reportedly did not like it.

&quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; was the final track recorded for the album but the first completed, with an additional two weeks of post-production. Simon initially composed the song in G major, but arranger and composer Jimmie Haskell transposed the song to E-flat major to suit Garfunkel&#x27;s voice. The song&#x27;s instrumental parts were recorded in August 1969 in California, to make it easier for Garfunkel to go to Mexico to film &quot;Catch-22&quot;. Simon wanted a gospel piano sound, and hired session musician Larry Knechtel. Joe Osborn played two separate bass tracks, one high and the other low. A string section entering in the third verse completed the arrangement. The drums were played by Hal Blaine in an echo chamber to achieve a hall effect and Los Angeles session percussionist Gary Coleman played the Vibraphone. The arranger Ernie Freeman labelled his string arrangement as &quot;Like a Pitcher of Water&quot;.

Simon and Garfunkel returned to New York in November 1969 to record the vocals. The vocal style in &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; was inspired by Phil Spector&#x27;s technique in &quot;Old Man River&quot; by The Righteous Brothers. Simon said it sounded like the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot;, stating in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview: &quot;They are very similar songs, certainly in instrumentation.&quot;

As their relations frayed preceding their 1970 breakup, Simon began to experience regret for allowing Garfunkel to sing it solo:
==Personnel==
* Art Garfunkel – lead vocals
* Paul Simon – backing vocals
* Larry Knechtel – piano
* Joe Osborn – bass guitar
* Hal Blaine – drums and percussion
* Jimmie Haskell, Ernie Freeman – string arrangements

==Critical reception==
&quot;Billboard&quot; called it a &quot;beautiful, almost religious-oriented ballad&quot; whose &quot;performance and arrangement are perfect.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;set in parable, this love ballad carries a two-level interpretation&quot; and praised &quot;Garfunkel’s magnificent vocal performance and the material.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; predicted that the song would &quot;equal [the duo&#x27;s] &#x27;Boxer&#x27; success.&quot;

The song has also been lauded as one of the greatest by Simon &amp; Garfunkel. In 2017, &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the song one of the best by the duo, describing it as &quot;heart-stirring&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; similarly lauded the song in 2020, calling it &quot;a transcendent experience&quot; and ranking it as the best song by the group.

Despite the song&#x27;s five-minute length, Columbia decided to release &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; for play on pop radio. AM radio had previously played Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; in 1965, despite its running over the conventional three-minute playtime limit. This figured in Columbia&#x27;s decision to release the five-minute version of &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; as a single. It reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart on February 28, 1970, and stayed at the top of the chart for six weeks. &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; also topped the adult contemporary chart in the US for six weeks. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the No. 1 song for 1970.

The song was certified Gold for over one million copies in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America, and sold over six million copies worldwide.

== Awards ==
The single won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Contemporary Song, and Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals in the Grammy Awards of 1971, with its album also winning Album of the Year.

Franklin debuted her version on March 5, 1971, during her landmark three-night stint at San Francisco&#x27;s Fillmore West, which was later released as &quot;Aretha Live at Fillmore West&quot;. Eleven days later, she performed the song on television for the first time at the 13th Annual Grammy Awards, at which an already-disbanded Simon &amp; Garfunkel picked up five Grammy Awards for the song. Franklin&#x27;s Grammy performance was released decades later on the 1994 compilation &quot;Grammy&#x27;s Greatest Moments Volume III&quot;.

===Elvis Presley===

The song appears as the second song on the album&#x27;s first side and features both Reed and Atkins playing guitar trading lines back and forth with each other. The album and their rendition of the song received generally positive reviews with the former going on to win the 1971 Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance.

===Linda Clifford===
Linda Clifford, Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s protégée signed on his Curtom label, released an up-tempo disco version of &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; on her album &quot;Let Me Be Your Woman&quot; in March 1979. This epic version (10:20 in length) was produced by Gil Askey (jazz trumpet player and musical director for many Motown acts) and mixed by Jimmy Simpson, brother of Valerie Simpson from Ashford and Simpson. The song has two originalities, the first one being a 132 bpm tempo (considered the ideal tempo for disco dancing) when the Simon and Garfunkel original is 82 bpm and Aretha Franklin&#x27;s cover is 76 bpm. It was the first time that this song was covered with a fast tempo. It also has a highly original &quot;Brazilian cuica on a disco beat&quot; break. It became a US disco number 11, pop number 41, R&amp;B number 49 and UK number 28.

===P.J.B. featuring Hannah and Her Sisters version===
In 1991, P.J.B. featuring Hannah and Her Sisters, a UK group assembled by British songwriter, record producer and author Pete Bellotte and fronted by British singer Hannah Jones, released a dance cover of &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; which reached number 21 on the UK Singles Chart.

====Charts====
===Clay Aiken version===

After the final results were announced, RCA Records released the song as a double A-side single with &quot;This Is the Night&quot; in Canada in New Zealand; in the US, &quot;This Is the Night&quot; was credited as a solo release since it received a higher cumulative airplay audience. The double A-side charted at number one in both Canada and New Zealand, earning a sextuple-platinum sales certification in the former country and a platinum disc in the latter. On New Zealand&#x27;s year-end chart for 2003, the single was ranked at number 38.

====Charts====

A rewriting of the song with Cantonese lyrics (&quot;Many hearts prevail&quot; – :zh:滔滔千里心) was collectively sung by many Hong Kong singers for public shows in Hong Kong to raise funds after the Eastern China flood of 1991. In 2009 it was also used in the Artistes 88 Fund Raising Campaign for the victims of Typhoon Morakot.

<text>George Hastings, 4th Earl of Huntingdon (1540 – 30 December 1604) was an English nobleman.

He was a son of Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon and Catherine Pole, daughter of Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu and Jane Neville. He was a younger brother of Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, and older brother of Francis Hastings. He succeeded Henry as the 4th Earl.

He was High Sheriff of Leicestershire in 1571 and knight of the shire (MP) for Derbyshire in 1562 and Leicestershire in 1584–1587. He was invested as a knight in 1565. They lived at Gopsall and then Loughborough, both in Leicestershire.

He hosted Anne of Denmark and her children Prince Henry and Princess Elizabeth at Ashby-de-la-Zouch on 22 June 1603. Huntingdon was anxious for the queen to visit and enlisted the Earl of Shrewsbury&#x27;s steward Richard Bainbrigg and others to make his case that the royal party should come to Ashby Castle from Wollaton Hall.

He was succeeded by his grandson Henry Hastings, 5th Earl of Huntingdon.

He died in 1604.

==Marriage==
George married Dorothy Port, daughter and co-heiress of Sir John Port of Etwall, Derbyshire. They had five children:
*Francis Hastings, Baron Hastings (1560–1595), who was father to Henry Hastings, 5th Earl of Huntingdon.
*Henry Hastings (1562 – 5 October 1650).
*Sir Edward Hastings.
*Catherine Hastings. Married first Sir Walter Chetwynd and secondly Sir Edward Unton. Her second husband was a son of Edward Unton and Anne Seymour. Anne was a daughter of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, and Anne Stanhope.
*Dorothy Hastings, was a Maid of Honour at court. She married a Scottish courtier, James Stewart, a son of Walter Stewart of Blantyre. Her second husband was Robert Dillon, 2nd Earl of Roscommon.

<doc id="634671" wikidata="Q928112" url="?curid=634671" title="Pthreads">
<text>In computing, POSIX Threads, commonly known as pthreads, is an execution model that exists independently from a programming language, as well as a parallel execution model. It allows a program to control multiple different flows of work that overlap in time. Each flow of work is referred to as a &quot;thread&quot;, and creation and control over these flows is achieved by making calls to the POSIX Threads API. POSIX Threads is an API defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard &quot;POSIX.1c, Threads extensions (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995)&quot;.

Implementations of the API are available on many Unix-like POSIX-conformant operating systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Linux, macOS, Android, Solaris, Redox, and AUTOSAR Adaptive, typically bundled as a library libpthread. DR-DOS and Microsoft Windows implementations also exist: within the SFU/SUA subsystem which provides a native implementation of a number of POSIX APIs, and also within third-party packages such as &quot;pthreads-w32&quot;, which implements pthreads on top of existing Windows API.

==Contents==
pthreads defines a set of C programming language types, functions and constants. It is implemented with a codice_1 header and a thread library.

There are around 100 threads procedures, all prefixed codice_2 and they can be categorized into five groups:

*Thread management – creating, joining threads etc.
*Mutexes
*Condition variables
*Synchronization between threads using read write locks and barriers
*Spinlocks

The POSIX semaphore API works with POSIX threads but is not part of the threads standard, having been defined in the &quot;POSIX.1b, Real-time extensions (IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993)&quot; standard. Consequently, the semaphore procedures are prefixed by codice_3 instead of codice_2.

==Example==
An example illustrating the use of pthreads in C:
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

#define NUM_THREADS 5

void *perform_work(void *arguments){
 int index = *((int *)arguments);
 int sleep_time = 1 + rand() % NUM_THREADS;
 printf(&quot;Thread %d: Started.\n&quot;, index);
 printf(&quot;Thread %d: Will be sleeping for %d seconds.\n&quot;, index, sleep_time);
 sleep(sleep_time);
 printf(&quot;Thread %d: Ended.\n&quot;, index);
 return NULL;

int main(void) {
 pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];
 int thread_args[NUM_THREADS];
 int i;
 int result_code;
 //create all threads one by one
 for (i = 0; i &lt; NUM_THREADS; i++) {
 printf(&quot;In main: Creating thread %d.\n&quot;, i);
 thread_args[i] = i;
 result_code = pthread_create(&amp;threads[i], NULL, perform_work, &amp;thread_args[i]);
 assert(!result_code);

 printf(&quot;In main: All threads are created.\n&quot;);

 //wait for each thread to complete
 for (i = 0; i &lt; NUM_THREADS; i++) {
 result_code = pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
 assert(!result_code);
 printf(&quot;In main: Thread %d has ended.\n&quot;, i);

 printf(&quot;Main program has ended.\n&quot;);
 return 0;

This program creates five threads, each executing the function &quot;perform_work&quot; that prints the unique number of this thread to standard output. If a programmer wanted the threads to communicate with each other, this would require defining a variable outside of the scope of any of the functions, making it a global variable. This program can be compiled using the gcc compiler with the following command:
 gcc pthreads_demo.c -pthread -o pthreads_demo
Here is one of the many possible outputs from running this program.

In main: Creating thread 0.
In main: Creating thread 1.
In main: Creating thread 2.
In main: Creating thread 3.
Thread 0: Started.
In main: Creating thread 4.
Thread 3: Started.
Thread 2: Started.
Thread 0: Will be sleeping for 3 seconds.
Thread 1: Started.
Thread 1: Will be sleeping for 5 seconds.
Thread 2: Will be sleeping for 4 seconds.
Thread 4: Started.
Thread 4: Will be sleeping for 1 seconds.
In main: All threads are created.
Thread 3: Will be sleeping for 4 seconds.
Thread 4: Ended.
Thread 0: Ended.
In main: Thread 0 has ended.
Thread 2: Ended.
Thread 3: Ended.
Thread 1: Ended.
In main: Thread 1 has ended.
In main: Thread 2 has ended.
In main: Thread 3 has ended.
In main: Thread 4 has ended.
Main program has ended.
== POSIX Threads for Windows ==
Windows does not support the pthreads standard natively, therefore the Pthreads4w project seeks to provide a portable and open-source wrapper implementation. It can also be used to port Unix software (which uses pthreads) with little or no modification to the Windows platform. Pthreads4w version 3.0.0 or later, released under the Apache Public License v2.0, is compatible with 64-bit or 32-bit Windows systems.

The Mingw-w64 project also contains a wrapper implementation of &#x27;pthreads, winpthreads, which tries to use more native system calls than the Pthreads4w project.

Interix environment subsystem available in the Windows Services for UNIX/Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications package provides a native port of the pthreads API, i.e. not mapped on Win32 API but built directly on the operating system syscall interface.

<text>Ed Brubaker (; born November 17, 1966) is an American comic book writer, cartoonist and screenwriter who works primarily in the crime fiction genre. He began his career with the semi-autobiographical series &quot;Lowlife&quot; and a number of serials in the &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; anthology, before achieving industry-wide acclaim with the Vertigo series &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; and moving to the superhero comics such as &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Catwoman&quot;, &quot;The Authority&quot;, &quot;Captain America&quot;, &quot;Daredevil&quot; and &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;. Brubaker is best known for his long-standing collaboration with British artist Sean Phillips, starting with their Elseworlds one-shot &quot;&quot; in 2001 and continuing with a number of creator-owned series such as &quot;Criminal&quot;, &quot;Incognito&quot;, &quot;Fatale&quot;, &quot;The Fade Out&quot; and &quot;Kill or Be Killed&quot;.

He is also known for co-creating the Winter Soldier identity of Bucky Barnes with Steve Epting. Brubaker has won numerous awards for his comics work, including seven Eisner Awards, two Harvey Awards, an Ignatz Award, and a GLAAD Media Award. In addition to his work in comics, Brubaker served as the executive producer and co-writer of the 2019 Amazon series &quot;Too Old to Die Young&quot;, directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. 

==Early life==
Brubaker was the child of a Navy intelligence officer, and spent much of his childhood in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. From childhood he read comics that included Captain America and his sidekick Bucky Barnes, which were seminal in the storyline he would one day write when creating the Winter Soldier. Describing his affinity for Captain America&#x27;s sidekick thus, he has stated, &quot;I was a Navy brat, and he was an Army brat.&quot; As Bucky had been killed off before Brubaker began reading comics, he assumed that the character had met his demise in an elaborate, dramatic story, only to find that he had been unceremoniously killed in a single page of &quot;The Avengers&quot; #4, which Brubaker saw as an injustice, commenting, &quot;I was a 9-year-old kid, and I was horrified.&quot; His uncle was screenwriter John Paxton.

==Career==
===Early work===
Brubaker began his career in comics as a cartoonist, writing and drawing &quot;Pajama Chronicles&quot; for Blackthorne Publishing, &quot;Purgatory U.S.A.&quot; for Slave Labor Graphics and several short stories for various small-press anthologies. His most well-known work of the period is &quot;Lowlife&quot;, a semi-autobiographical series first published by Caliber and later moved to Aeon Press. For Caliber, Brubaker also co-edited an anthology publication titled &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot;.

In 1991, Brubaker wrote one of his earliest crime stories for the Dark Horse anthology series &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot;, which he would continue to contribute to intermittently throughout the decade. Among those contributions were the three-part serial &quot;An Accidental Death&quot;, a collaboration between Brubaker and artist Eric Shanower which garnered the two an Eisner Award nomination in 1993, a Godzilla short story and another tale under the &quot;Lowlife&quot; title, this time a romantic triangle explored through three stories with each depicting a different participant&#x27;s point-of-view. The latter story was collected by Alternative Comics into a standalone publication titled &quot;At the Seams&quot;, which in turn was nominated for Outstanding Graphic Novel or Collection at the 1997 Ignatz Awards. His other work for Alternative Comics, the humorous and experimental &quot;Detour&quot; #1, was to be the first issue of a series, though only one issue was published. &quot;Detour&quot; was nominated for the &quot;Best New Series&quot; Harvey Award in 1998.

Brubaker&#x27;s last work for &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; was &quot;The Fall&quot;, a five-part story illustrated by &quot;Berlin&quot; creator Jason Lutes about a convenience store clerk who gets involved in a ten-year-old murder mystery after he uses a stolen credit card. In 2001, all five parts were collected into a one-shot by Canadian publisher Drawn &amp; Quarterly. In 2004, IDW Publishing announced the first creator-owned project by Brubaker and artist Sean Phillips, a pirate-themed series titled &quot;Black Sails&quot;. The creators eventually decided to shelve the series in favor of &quot;Criminal&quot; (published under Marvel&#x27;s Icon imprint), and &quot;The Fall&quot; remained Brubaker&#x27;s last independent comics work until his move to Image in 2012.

===DC Comics===
In 1995, Brubaker was contacted by DC Comics to write a story about Prez for its &quot;mature readers&quot; imprint Vertigo, after being recommended to the editors by his &quot;An Accidental Death&quot; collaborator Eric Shanower (who was already attached to the project as the artist). The result—Brubaker&#x27;s first work for one of the two major American comic book publishers—was a one-shot titled &quot;Vertigo Visions: Prez&quot;, a broad political satire revamping the obscure 1970s Joe Simon creation. Brubaker continued to pitch various ideas to Vertigo but kept getting rejected until Shelly Roeberg asked him to pitch &quot;something [he] didn&#x27;t think Vertigo would publish&quot;, which ended up being &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot;. The 1999 series marked Brubaker&#x27;s first collaboration with two artists who would frequently work with him in later years: Michael Lark and Sean Phillips (who joined the project as the inker for issues #2–4). A slacker detective story set in San Francisco, &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; was critically acclaimed and brought Brubaker to the attention of Hollywood producers for the first time.

In late 2000, Brubaker signed an exclusive contract with DC Comics. That same year, he wrote his first mainstream superhero work, taking over &quot;Batman&quot; with issue #582 (Oct. 2000). Brubaker would continue writing various series starring Batman and his ancillary characters until late 2003, including contributions to inter-title crossover storylines such as &quot;Bruce Wayne: Murderer?&quot; and &quot;Bruce Wayne: Fugitive&quot;, as well as a stint on &quot;Detective Comics&quot; that was cut short due to an unspecified dispute with the editors. Also in 2000, Brubaker launched his second creator-owned property at Vertigo, the science fiction series &quot;Deadenders&quot; with artist Warren Pleece, which lasted 16 issues before its cancellation in 2001. Brubaker&#x27;s last work for Vertigo was &quot;Dead Boy Detectives&quot;, a four-issue &quot;The Sandman&quot; spin-off limited series illustrated by artist Bryan Talbot.

In 2001, Brubaker teamed up with artist Darwyn Cooke to revamp Catwoman, redesigning and redeveloping the character&#x27;s costume, supporting cast and modus operandi. The pair&#x27;s stint started with a four-part serial &quot;Trail of the Catwoman&quot;, published in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #759–762, in which private detective Slam Bradley attempts to investigate the death of Selina Kyle, a.k.a. Catwoman, and continued into the new &quot;Catwoman&quot; series which launched in late 2001. Brubaker stayed on the series until #37 (Jan. 2005). During this time, Brubaker and Marvel writer Brian Michael Bendis discussed co-writing a team-up tale between DC&#x27;s Batman and Marvel&#x27;s Daredevil. The two writers were enthusiastic about their ideas, which included a fight between Batman and Marvel villain Bullseye as well as another fight between Catwoman and Elektra. DC editors Matt Idelson and Bob Schreck were also enthusiastic, but DC Publisher Paul Levitz objected to the project due to a prior disagreement with Marvel&#x27;s Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada.

In 2002, Brubaker did his first work for Wildstorm, another DC imprint, penning the five-issue &quot;Wildcats&quot; spin-off &quot;Point Blank&quot;. The series, drawn by New Zealand artist Colin Wilson and starring Wildcats&#x27; member Grifter, took existing characters and concepts from the Wildstorm Universe and used them to set up Brubaker&#x27;s &quot;Sleeper&quot; series which debuted later that year. A collaboration with artist Sean Phillips, &quot;Sleeper&quot; starred Holden Carver, a secret agent who goes undercover in a supervillain&#x27;s powerful organization only to have his only contact in law enforcement fall into a coma. With the authorities believing him a dangerous criminal, Carver is caught between the two warring sides with unclear allegiances. Although &quot;Sleeper&quot; was a success with critics and fans on the Internet, the series underperformed commercially. In December 2003, in a unique publicity stunt conceived to help promote the first trade paperback collection of &quot;Sleeper&quot;, Brubaker organized an arm wrestling competition at San Francisco&#x27;s Isotope Comics. If participants were able to beat Brubaker at arm wrestling, they were awarded free signed comic books. According to Brubaker, he wrestled around 40–50 people and won most of the time, losing only to eight or nine contestants.

During the series&#x27; run, &quot;Sleeper&quot; also took part in the line-wide crossover &quot;Coup d&#x27;Etat&quot;, with Brubaker scripting the first issue of the eponymous limited series. &quot;Coup d&#x27;Etat&quot; featured a series of events that led the Authority, a powerful team of superhumans in the Wilstorm Universe, to take over the United States. Following the crossover, Brubaker and artist Dustin Nguyen produced the 12-issue &quot;The Authority: Revolution&quot; series which explored the ramifications of the team&#x27;s actions, while &quot;Sleeper&quot; was relaunched with the &quot;Season Two&quot; subtitle under the first volume&#x27;s creative team.

Brubaker&#x27;s last major project at DC was &quot;Gotham Central&quot;, co-created by Brubaker, writer Greg Rucka and artist Michael Lark. The series focused on the activities of the Gotham City Police Department, with writers either co-scripting storylines or alternating between the arcs. After Brubaker and Lark left the series due to their newly-signed exclusive contracts with Marvel, Rucka decided to discontinue the title, and &quot;Gotham Central&quot; was cancelled with issue #40 (Apr. 2006).

===Marvel Comics===

Brubaker&#x27;s first work for Marvel was volume five of the &quot;Captain America&quot; series. Paired with artist Steve Epting, Brubaker introduced new villains and resurrected the long-dead supporting character Bucky Barnes as &quot;the Winter Soldier&quot;. The relaunch was a commercial and critical success from its first issue, with its most well-known storyline involving the assassination of Steve Rogers and subsequent passing of the Captain America mantle to Bucky Barnes. Brubaker wrote &quot;Captain America&quot; for eight full years, from November 2004 to October 2012, alongside several spin-off titles and associated series based around the character, including the 2009 mini-series &quot;Captain America: Reborn&quot;, which featured the return of Rogers, the eight-issue &quot;The Marvels Project&quot; limited series, as well as &quot;Secret Avengers&quot;, an ongoing series that followed the adventures of the eponymous team formed in the aftermath of the company-wide crossover storyline &quot;Siege&quot;.

Brubaker&#x27;s workload at Marvel increased in 2006. He wrote two limited series, &quot;Books of Doom&quot; with artist Pablo Raimondi, retelling and expanding on the origin of Doctor Doom, and &quot;X-Men: Deadly Genesis&quot; with artist Trevor Hairsine, retconning the origins of the All-New, All-Different X-Men team that debuted in 1975. After finishing &quot;Deadly Genesis&quot; in July 2006, Brubaker became the regular writer of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, working with artists Billy Tan and Clayton Henry. In addition to that, he also took over &quot;Daredevil&quot;, having already planned his run with outgoing writer Brian Michael Bendis. Once again teaming up with his &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; and &quot;Gotham Central&quot; collaborator Michael Lark, Brubaker explored the ramifications of the character&#x27;s imprisonment which occurred at the close of Bendis&#x27; run. Another notable launch of the year was &quot;The Immortal Iron Fist&quot;, an ongoing series co-written by Brubaker and Matt Fraction which started in November 2006.

Also in 2006, Brubaker and artist Sean Phillips launched their first creator-owned series &quot;Criminal&quot;, published under Marvel&#x27;s Icon imprint. The title received generally positive reviews and its first arc, &quot;Coward&quot;, won the 2007 Eisner Award for Best New Series. In 2008, after two volumes of &quot;Criminal&quot;, Brubaker and Phillips took a break from the series to launch another Icon title, &quot;Incognito&quot;, which Brubaker described as being &quot;about a completely amoral guy with super-powers forced to pretend he&#x27;s a normal law-abiding citizen, because he&#x27;s in Witness Protection, and how that shapes what he becomes. It&#x27;s also a brutal noir twist on the super-hero/super-villain genre that delves more into their roots in the pulps, and it&#x27;s going to be pretty over-the-top and action-packed.&quot;

In February 2010, a controversy arose around &quot;Captain America&quot; #602, which depicted a group of anti-tax protesters, understood by some readers to be a Tea Party, which was characterized by the Falcon as exclusively white and racist group. Brubaker and Marvel&#x27;s Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada apologized for the matter, explaining that, although Brubaker did not intend the protesters to represent any particular real-life group, one of the signs depicted in the scene read, &quot;Tea Bag The Libs Before They Tea Bag YOU!&quot;. The slogan was not in Brubaker&#x27;s script and was instead added by letterer Joe Caramagna, who, under deadline pressures, used messages from signs he found online at the last minute. Quesada further assured that the error would not appear in future reprints of the issue. In an interview following the controversy Brubaker stated, &quot;I had to shut down my public email because I started getting death threats from, y&#x27;know, peaceful protesters.&quot;

===Image Comics===
In January 2012, Brubaker and Phillips launched &quot;Fatale&quot; at Image. The series was initially announced as a twelve-issue maxi-series but was upgraded to an ongoing title in November 2012. Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated that &quot;You can&#x27;t go wrong with a Brubaker/Phillips collaboration. Even so, &quot;Fatale&quot; is making a strong case for being the best of their projects.&quot; In October 2013, Brubaker signed a five-year contract to produce comics exclusively for Image. Under the terms of the deal, Image would publish any comic Brubaker brought to them without having to pitch it. Brubaker stated this arrangement was something he has always wanted. The first series released under this contract was &quot;The Fade Out&quot;, a Hollywood period piece made with frequent collaborator Sean Phillips.

Brubaker&#x27;s other projects for Image include &quot;Velvet&quot;, a spy series illustrated by his &quot;Captain America&quot; collaborator Steve Epting.

===Film and television work===
In March 2009, Brubaker premiered his web series &quot;Angel of Death&quot; on Crackle. Brubaker made a cameo appearance in the 2014 film &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot;, playing the Winter Soldier&#x27;s handler. In 2016, Brubaker joined the writing staff for HBO&#x27;s &quot;Westworld&quot;. He co-wrote the episode &quot;Dissonance Theory&quot; with Jonathan Nolan.

In 2019, Brubaker partnered with Nicolas Winding Refn to produce &quot;Too Old to Die Young&quot;, a 10-part neo-noir miniseries for Amazon. In 2022, it was announced that Brubaker would serve as head writer and executive producer on the animated series &quot;&quot;. In 2023, Brubaker&#x27;s and Sean Phillips comic book &quot;Criminal&quot; was announced to be in development at Amazon Prime Video with him serving as writer, executive producer and showrunner. A year later, in 2024, the series was officially ordered with Jordan Harper joining as co-showrunner and Phillips as executive producer.

====Criminal (2006-present)====
After collaborating on &quot;Sleeper&quot; for DC Comics, Brubaker and Sean Phillips took their partnership to Marvel to create &quot;Criminal&quot;. In 2016, the duo moved the series to Image Comics, producing a series of one-shots and original graphic novels, before launching a new ongoing series in 2019.
=====Trade paperbacks=====
=====Deluxe hardcovers=====
====Incognito (2008-2011)====
Following the success of &quot;Criminal&quot; with Marvel&#x27;s Icon imprint, &quot;Incognito&quot; was the second launch for Brubaker and Phillips. It told the story of Zack Overkill, who was placed in witness protection after informing on his supervillain boss. The series was reprinted by Image Comics in 2017.

====Fatale (2012-2014)====
With art from Phillips, and colors from Dave Stewart, &quot;Fatale&quot; is a part-pulp, part-horror story of a femme fatale, set between the 1950s and 1970s.

Brubaker said it came from trying to push himself creatively. &quot;It seemed like a bigger challenge to try to do three noir tales that are wound around a horror story examination of the idea of the femme fatale archetype.&quot;

====Velvet (2013-2016)====
Co-created with Captain America artist, Steve Epting, Brubaker said &quot;Velvet&quot; was &quot;A Cold War-era story about a spy that nobody sees coming, even—or especially—all the spies around her&quot;.

The story came to comics after being rejected as a television pitch. Brubaker said: &quot;The notes that we got from everybody were that she needed to be 25, and an agent-in-training learning from the cool male secret agent. I was just like &#x27;OK, this is... just appalling to me.&#x27; Rather than a character that had lived a real life, they wanted a woman 20 years younger, stripped of Velvet&#x27;s expertise and maturity.&quot;

====The Fade Out (2014-2016)====
Set in Hollywood 1948, Brubaker and Phillips&#x27; &quot;The Fade Out&quot; tells the story of a screenwriter who awakens in a room with a dead actor. Brubaker said: &quot;It&#x27;s all based on things that have happened. Not the murder itself and the coverup, but the details. The way that the FBI had informants and people fronting, pretending they were working for the studios.&quot;
====Kill Or Be Killed (2017-2018)====
Brubaker and Phillips combined to tell a 20-issue story in which a relatively normal art student turns into a gun-toting antihero. &quot;Kill Or Be Killed&quot; was described as &quot;Death Wish&quot; meets &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;.

====Reckless (2020-2022)====
Co-created with Phillips, &quot;Reckless&quot; is set in Los Angeles during the early 1980s. It tells the story of former FBI agent, Ethan Reckless, and projectionist Anna, with their crusade for payback on villains.

Brubaker&#x27;s inspiration was to wonder what a pulp hero would look like without &quot;all the blatant racism and sexism&quot; that was prevalent in the 1950s and 1960s version of the genre. The idea came out of the Covid-19 pandemic. &quot;(Sean and I) were both looking for some kind of escape. Something that we could throw ourselves into.&quot;
====Friday (2021-2024)====
Originally published on Panel Syndicate as an e-comic, &quot;Friday&quot; was co-created with Marcos Martin and Muntsa Vicente. The series was re-released as a trio of paperbacks by Image Comics.

<doc id="634686" wikidata="Q1759151" url="?curid=634686" title="Greg Rucka">
<text>Gregory Rucka (born November 29, 1969) is an American writer known for the series of novels starring his character Atticus Kodiak, the creator-owned comic book series &quot;Whiteout&quot;, &quot;Queen &amp; Country&quot;, &quot;Stumptown&quot; and &quot;Lazarus&quot;, as well as lengthy runs on such titles as &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; and &quot;Gotham Central&quot; for DC Comics, and &quot;Elektra&quot;, &quot;Wolverine&quot; and &quot;The Punisher&quot; for Marvel. He has written a substantial amount of supplemental material for a number of DC Comics&#x27; line-wide and inter-title crossovers, including &quot;&quot;, &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and &quot;&quot;. 

Rucka made his debut as a screenwriter with the screenplay for the 2020 film &quot;The Old Guard&quot;, based on his comic book series of the same name.

==Early life==
Greg Rucka was born in San Francisco and raised on the Monterey Peninsula of California, in an area known to the locals as &quot;Steinbeck Country&quot;. Rucka is Jewish. He first discovered comics at the Nob Hill Market in Salinas, California, where at age five, he first saw digest-sized black and white reprints of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby&#x27;s work on &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, which he convinced his mother to buy. He began writing at a young age, and at age 10, he won a county-wide short story contest. He graduated from Vassar College with an A.B. in English. He then enrolled in the University of Southern California&#x27;s Master of Professional Writing program, graduating with a Master of Fine Arts. He names Douglas Adams as his biggest influence.

Before becoming a professional fiction writer he worked in a number of other occupations, including house painting, restaurant work, emergency medical technician, security guard, technical writer, and fight choreographer.

==Career==
Rucka&#x27;s writing career began with the Atticus Kodiak series. Kodiak is a bodyguard whose jobs are rarely as uncomplicated as they at first appear. The series to date consists of &quot;Keeper&quot;, &quot;Finder&quot;, &quot;Smoker&quot;, &quot;Shooting at Midnight&quot;, &quot;Critical Space&quot;, &quot;Patriot Acts&quot;, and &quot;Walking Dead&quot;. These works garnered Rucka much critical acclaim and comparisons to the elite writers of crime/suspense fiction. The &quot;Atticus&quot; novels are notable for their realism and attention to detail, which is partly a product of Rucka&#x27;s fight training and experience as an EMT. He has written six non-Atticus books: &quot;Fistful of Rain,&quot; &quot;Alpha,&quot; &quot;Bravo,&quot; &quot;A Gentleman&#x27;s Game,&quot; &quot;Private Wars,&quot; and &quot;The Last Run&quot;; the latter three are tie-ins to his comic book series &quot;Queen &amp; Country&quot;.

In 1998, Rucka entered the comics industry with &quot;Whiteout&quot;, published through Oni Press. &quot;Whiteout&quot; focuses on a murder in an Antarctic base. It was followed by a sequel, &quot;&quot;.

The majority of Rucka&#x27;s work throughout the 2000s was for DC Comics, where he was involved with their main trinity of characters: Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. Rucka wrote Batman on a regular basis in the &quot;Detective Comics&quot; series following the events of &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&#x27;&quot;. He wrote the novelization of the year-long arc. While writing &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, he created a number of background characters that led to the co-creation of &quot;Gotham Central&quot; with co-writer Ed Brubaker. His Batman work includes such story arcs as &quot;Bruce Wayne: Murderer?&quot; and &quot;Bruce Wayne: Fugitive&quot;. as well as the &quot;Batman: Death and the Maidens&quot; limited series. From October 2003 to April 2006 he wrote &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; after having previously written the character in the &quot;Wonder Woman: The Hiketeia&quot; original graphic novel.

From 2002 to 2004, he did some work for Marvel, including the start of the third volume of &quot;Wolverine&quot;, &quot;Elektra&quot; and the mini-series &quot;Ultimate Daredevil and Elektra&quot;. He has worked for Image Comics. The first volume of his series &quot;Queen &amp; Country&quot; concluded in July 2007 with issue #32.

He co-wrote &quot;Countdown to Infinite Crisis&quot;, a one-shot and the official start of the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline, with Geoff Johns and Judd Winick. Rucka&#x27;s work on both &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; and &quot;Gotham Central&quot; ended in 2006. Although he was not involved in the main storyline of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, he did write The OMAC Project which built towards the event, focusing on Batman&#x27;s distrust of other superheroes. This led to the revival of &quot;Checkmate&quot;, a UN authority that oversaw superheroes including Sasha Bordeaux, an integral character of The OMAC Project. He was a co-writer on the weekly series &quot;52&quot;, which he co-wrote with Geoff Johns, Grant Morrison, and Mark Waid. This series chronicled in real-time the year following &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, and saw Rucka focus on Renee Montoya of &quot;Gotham Central&quot; and the creation of the new Batwoman, Kate Kane. Rucka returned to the Batwoman character frequently over the years in a &quot;52&quot; sequel &quot;The Crime Bible&quot; and &quot;Final Crisis: Revelations&quot; before returning to the character in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; with artist J. H. Williams III, as well as reviving Renee Montoya in the book&#x27;s second feature with artist Cully Hamner.

Rucka wrote the screenplay for the &quot;Crossfire&quot; segment in the direct-to-DVD anime &quot;&quot;, in which Crispus Allen, a character he created, appears. In 2009, Rucka and artist Eddy Barrows took over &quot;Action Comics&quot; as the title moved its focus from Superman to Kryptonian heroes Nightwing and Flamebird in the aftermath of the &quot;&quot; story arc. As well as writing &quot;Action Comics&quot;, Rucka co-wrote the main &quot;New Krypton&quot; 12 part series with &quot;Superman&quot; writer James Robinson.

At Wondercon 2010 Rucka announced he would part ways with DC Comics to focus on his own projects, in part because of DC&#x27;s failure to keep him on as writer of &quot;Wonder Woman: Earth One&quot; as promised. Rucka then wrote &quot;The Punisher&quot; for Marvel Comics.

On July 11, 2011, Rucka launched the webcomic &quot;Lady Sabre and the Pirates of the Ineffable Aether&quot;, a steampunk adventure series illustrated by Rick Burchett. New installments appear every Monday and Thursday. In May 2013, Rucka launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the publication of a print edition of &quot;Lady Sabre&quot;, and achieved their initial funding goal of $27,500 within eight hours.

He wrote the creator-owned series, &quot;Black Magick&quot;, which was drawn by Nicola Scott and published by Image Comics. The Rucka/Scott creative team produced a new &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; series for DC Comics in June 2016 as part of the DC Rebirth relaunch. Rucka concluded his run on &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; as of issue #25.

In 2017, Rucka wrote the creator-owned series &quot;The Old Guard&quot;, which was drawn by Leandro Fernandez, colored by Daniela Miwa and published by Image Comics. In March 2017, Skydance Media picked up the rights to adapt the comic into a film with the same name. Rucka wrote the film&#x27;s script. The film was released on Netflix in July 2020.

In July 2019, Rucka began writing the &quot;Lois Lane&quot; 12-issue limited series with artist Mike Perkins. In December 2019, Rucka began writing a second volume of &quot;The Old Guard&quot; called &quot;The Old Guard: Force Multiplied.&quot;

In August 2023 Netflix released &quot;Heart of Stone&quot;, an action-thriller starring Gal Gadot whose story was conceived by Rucka, and whose script was written by Rucka and Allison Schroeder.

==Appearances in media==
Rucka was featured as a character in the &quot;&quot; comic book mini-series &quot;&quot;, where he accidentally killed comics gossip columnist Rich Johnston while attempting to kill Joe Quesada over his perceived role in the cancellation of &quot;Gotham Central&quot;.

Rucka is one of several professional comics whose names were used for characters in an episode of the ninth season of the BBC police drama &quot;New Tricks&quot;.

==Personal life==
Rucka, his wife, author Jen Van Meter, and their two children, lived in Eugene, Oregon, and live in Portland, Oregon.

Rucka names &quot;The Conversation&quot;, &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; as his favorite films. He enjoys the music of Dexter Gordon, Lester Bowie, Joe Jackson, Warren Zevon, and Melissa Ferrick. His other hobbies include role-playing games, computer games, playing the guitar and collecting action figures.

<doc id="634687" wikidata="Q202654" url="?curid=634687" title="Pavlov's Dog (band)">
<text>Pavlov&#x27;s Dog is a 1970s progressive rock/AOR band formed in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1972. The name is a reference to the animal(s) used by Ivan Pavlov in his experimentation into classical conditioning.

==History==
===Early years and split===
Pavlov&#x27;s Dog was composed originally of vocalist David Surkamp, guitarist Steve Levin, keyboardists David Hamilton and Doug Rayburn, bassist Rick Stockton, drummer Mike Safron, and violinist Siegfried Carver (born Richard Nadler). Levin left the band during their inaugural year and was replaced by Steve Scorfina (formerly of REO Speedwagon). Carver departed the band following the release of the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Pampered Menial&quot;. &quot;Pampered Menial&quot; was briefly released in 1975 on ABC Records but then quickly re-issued by Columbia Records. The result was that two versions appeared in stores at roughly the same time. The album was produced by Sandy Pearlman and Murray Krugman, who had found success earlier in the decade producing Blue Öyster Cult.

For their second album &quot;At the Sound of the Bell&quot; (1976), Tom Nickeson was added to the line-up on guitar; he switched to keyboards following the departure of Hamilton. A raft of guest artists contributed to the album, including jazz saxophonist Michael Brecker and Roxy Music&#x27;s Andy Mackay. Bill Bruford played the drums on this album, due to the absence of Safron, and when Safron did not receive a promised credit on the album sleeve, he departed the band permanently and was replaced by Kirk Sarkisian. This line-up of the band remained until their dissolution in 1977.

The band recorded a third album in 1977, but due to poor sales of the first two albums, Columbia refused to release it, hastening the band&#x27;s split. The third album appeared as a bootleg in the 1980s, a limited edition pressed from stolen master tapes. It was released under the name &quot;The St. Louis Hounds&quot;, without Pavlov&#x27;s Dog being credited on the sleeve. The third album finally was titled &quot;Has Anyone Here Seen Sigfried?&quot;, remastered, appended with 10 bonus tracks of unreleased material from the 1970s, and released legally in 2007 by German label Rockville Music. The German label TRC bootlegged the album, under the title &quot;Third&quot;, but this version does not include the bonus tracks.

When the band split up in the late 1970s, Surkamp was rumored to be dead, although in fact he was working with Ian Matthews on a band named Hi-Fi. While living in Seattle, this group was successful on the club scene and recorded a 5-track live 12&quot; EP in 1981 entitled &quot;Hi-Fi Demonstration Record&quot;, a studio album in 1983 entitled &quot;Moods for Mallards&quot;, and a Christmas single &quot;It&#x27;s Almost Christmas&quot;. Records were released on the First American label and distribution was mostly limited to the Pacific Northwest. Label owner Jerry Dennon got into legal trouble with the US Justice Department as part of a master tape tax shelter scam. He pled guilty to tax fraud in May 1985, while continuing to proclaim his innocence.

===Reformation and return to music===
In 1990, Surkamp and Rayburn reformed the band and recorded &quot;Lost in America&quot; for US label Telectro Records, which was re-released worldwide by Rockville Music in 2007, after TRC had also bootlegged it in the late 1990s. Scorfina performed on some of the sessions for this album.

On June 26, 2004, a reunion concert featuring Surkamp, Safron, Rayburn, Stockton, Hamilton, and Scorfina took place in St. Louis, and in 2005 Surkamp and Safron reformed the band with Surkamp&#x27;s wife, Sara, on vocals and guitar, Ray Schulte on lead guitar, Royal Robbins on keyboards, Tim Duggen on bass, and Andrea Young on violin. This line-up toured Europe annually in 2005 and 2006, playing the 2006 Arrow Rock Festival in the Netherlands in front of 54,000 people.

After the 2006 tour, Schulte, Robbins and Duggen were replaced, and the new line-up was then: David Surkamp (vocals and guitar), Mike Safron (drums), Sara Surkamp (vocals and guitar), &quot;Bongo&quot; Bill Costello (mellotron), Bill Franco (lead guitar), David Karns (bass), Michael McElvain (keyboards) and Andrea Young (violin). This line-up played two tours in 2007, including the first tours in Greece and Crete in March 2007, and then touring Europe in the summer of 2007 playing venues such as Spirit of 66 in Verviers, BE as well as headlining both the Burg Herzberg Festival in 2007 (25,000 people). This coincided with the 2007 release of a solo album by Surkamp, &quot;Dancing on the Edge of a Teacup&quot;, by Rockville Music. The Burg Herzberg performance had also been filmed and recorded, but has not been released in any but bootlegged formats.

In 2008, David Karns, Bill Franco, Michael McElvain and Andrea Young were unable to return due to previous commitments (Karns and Franco playing with Anthony Gomes, Young playing with the Reverse Cowgirls and McElvain finishing his graduate music studies). To fill the spots, the Surkamps hired Phil Gomez (keyboards), Randy Hetlage (lead guitar), Abbie Hainz Steiling (violin), and saw the return of Rayburn, playing bass. This lineup again toured throughout Europe in 2008 playing many venues as well as the Woodstock Festival in Dornstadt (Germany) in 2008 (5,000 people).

In 2009 Doug Rayburn was unable to return, and Rick Steiling was brought in on bass. Also not returning were Phil Gomez and Randy Hetlage. Bill Franco was asked back on lead guitar and Nick Schlueter was brought in to handle keyboards and mellotron parts, reducing the lineup to seven members. This lineup toured Europe from 2009 through 2012, playing its most extensive tours to date including the band&#x27;s first dates in the U.K. and the Fiesta City Festival in Verviers, BE in 2012, sharing the stage with the legendary Blues Brothers Band (Steve Cropper, &quot;Blue&quot; Lou Marini, Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, et al.). During this time, Pavlov&#x27;s Dog recorded two shows in 2009 (Augsberg and Karlsruhe, the latter filmed), with the Augsberg show being released for the album &quot;Live and Unleashed&quot;. Also released was the studio album &quot;Echo &amp; Boo&quot; in 2010.

Bill Franco exited the band in May 2013, and after auditions, Amanda McCoy was brought in on lead guitar. Pavlov&#x27;s Dog again toured Europe in 2013, backing a re-release of &quot;Has Anyone Here Seen Sigfried?&quot; with the addition of live bonus tracks of the band with the lineups from 2007, 2011 and 2012. There was no Pavlov&#x27;s Dog tour in 2014, though David and Sara Surkamp went on a brief solo acoustic tour in the U.K. and Germany. During this time, Nick Schlueter exited the band, and after auditions, Nathan Jatcko was brought in on keyboards for the 2015 tour through Europe.

&quot;The Pekin Tapes&quot;, a collection of demos recorded in Pekin, Illinois, in 1973, was assembled from master tapes and released in 2014, also by Rockville Records. It was intended to be the band&#x27;s official debut album until ABC made them record &quot;Pampered Menial&quot;. The tapes were lost when the studio burned down, but surviving copies were discovered in a private inheritance.

Siegfried Carver died on May 30, 2009; he was 60 years old. Doug Rayburn died on September 21, 2012. Stockton died on February 17, 2015. Nathan Jatcko, the latter day keyboardist with the band, committed suicide on January 17, 2018. On January 31, 2021, the band announced the death of their former drummer and manager Manfred Ploetz. On October 3, 2022, the death of lead guitarist David Malachowski was announced. Subsequently, the &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot; 2022 fall tour which was to start in the same month in Europe, was postponed.

<text>Skiddaw is a mountain in the Lake District National Park in England. Its summit is traditionally considered to be the fourth-highest peak but depending on what topographic prominence is thought to be significant is also variously ranked as the third- and the sixth-highest in England. It lies just north of the town of Keswick, Cumbria, and dominates the skyline in this part of the northern lakes. It is the simplest of the Lake District mountains of this height to ascend (as there is a well-trodden tourist track from a car park to the north-east of Keswick, near the summit of Latrigg) and, as such, many walking guides recommend it to the occasional walker wishing to climb a mountain. This is the first summit of the fell running challenge known as the Bob Graham Round when undertaken in a clockwise direction.

The mountain lends its name to the surrounding areas of Skiddaw Forest and Back o&#x27; Skidda, and to the isolated Skiddaw House, situated to the east, formerly a shooting lodge and subsequently a youth hostel. It also provides the name for the slate derived from that region: Skiddaw slate. Skiddaw slate has been used to make tuned percussion musical instruments or lithophones, such as the Musical Stones of Skiddaw held at the Keswick Museum and Art Gallery.

==Topography==

The Northern Fells make up a roughly circular upland area approaching in width. At the centre is the marshy depression of Skiddaw Forest, a treeless plateau, or valley, at an elevation of about ; flowing outwards from here are the rivers that divide the area into three sectors. &quot;Forest&quot; is used here in its original sense, meaning land used for hunting, rather than a woodland. The south-western sector, between the Glenderaterra Beck and Dash Beck, contains Skiddaw and its satellites.

Skiddaw itself takes the form of a north–south ridge about long, with steep slopes to east and west. The ridge continues northwards over Broad End to Bakestall, a fell overlooking the Whitewater Dash waterfall. Further ridges fan out east and west from the southern end of Skiddaw. To the south-east are Skiddaw Little Man, Lonscale Fell and Latrigg, an easily accessible viewpoint for Keswick and Derwentwater. Beyond these fells are the Glenderaterra Beck and the Blencathra group. The south-western ridge curves round through 180 degrees to run north above the shore of Bassenthwaite Lake. This gives Skiddaw an &#x27;outer wall&#x27;, comprising Carl Side, Long Side and Ullock Pike, collectively referred to as Longside Edge. The final member of the Skiddaw Group is Dodd, a satellite of Carl Side.

Between Skiddaw and Longside Edge are the quiet valleys of Southerndale and Barkbethdale, separated by the spur of Buzzard Knott. These drain the western flanks of the fell to Bassenthwaite Lake. The eastern side of Skiddaw drains into Skiddaw Forest, much of the water reaching Candleseaves Bog. This marsh is the source of both the Dash Beck flowing north west to Bassenthwaite and the River Caldew, beginning its long journey north-eastward to the Solway Firth via Carlisle. Two smooth spurs on this eastern flank of Skiddaw, Sale How and Hare Crag, are listed in separate tops in some guidebooks. Sale How is also a Nuttall.

Skiddaw&#x27;s slopes are generally rounded and convex, looking from a distance as though a thick velvet blanket has been draped over a supporting frame. On the ridges the general terrain is of loose stones, but elsewhere all is grass and heather. Wainwright noted that &quot;Its lines are smooth, its curves graceful; but because the slopes are steep everywhere, the quick build-up of the “massif” from valley levels to central summit is appreciated at a glance — and it should be an appreciative glance, for such massive strength and such beauty of outline rarely go together.&quot;

==Geology==
The bedrock of Skiddaw, commonly known as Skiddaw Slate, is the Kirkstile Formation. This Ordovician rock is composed of laminated mudstone and siltstone with greywacke sandstone. At the summit this is overlain by scree and to the south are areas where the underlying Loweswater Formation surfaces.

==Summit==

The summit ridge bears a number of tops, which from north to south are known as North Top, High Man (the summit), Middle Top and South Top. All now bear cairns and a number of stone windshelters have been erected. Skiddaw has a subsidiary summit, Little Man, which lies about south-south-east of the main peak. Despite its limited independence, Wainwright listed it as a separate fell in his influential &quot;Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells&quot;, a convention which is often followed. Skiddaw Little Man has its own subsidiary summit, known as Lesser Man.

The view is as panoramic as might be expected, given Skiddaw&#x27;s topographic prominence. From High Man the north east quadrant is filled by the quiet fells of Back o&#x27;Skiddaw, with the Border hills, the Cheviots and the North Pennines behind them. To the south east are Blencathra, the Far Eastern Fells and the Helvellyn range; behind these are vistas of the Yorkshire Dales and Forest of Bowland. The Coniston Fells are visible directly to the south. On the other side of South Top is a fine view of the Scafells, Western and North Western Fells, with a portion of Snowdonia visible between Kirk Fell and Pillar. The Isle of Man is visible away, as are the Mourne Mountains away (on exceptionally clear days). The final quarter is taken up by the coastal plain and the distant Solway Firth, backed by the hills of Galloway such as Merrick and Criffel, and Broad Law in the Scottish Borders. Goat Fell on Arran can be seen at an angle of 313 degrees, away.

The most distant view is of Slieve Meelmore in the Mountains of Mourne in County Down, Northern Ireland, distant.

By moving to South Top a superb view of Borrowdale can be brought into sight.

==Ascents==

Many routes of ascent have been devised for Skiddaw; indeed, it is hard to devise a challenging approach in good conditions. The most popular tourist route starts from Keswick and first ascends behind Latrigg, before the climb continues over the slopes of Little Man to the summit. About of ascent can be saved by driving to the top of Gale Road and beginning from the public car park just behind the summit of Latrigg.

Another popular route (and the one recommended by Wainwright) is to follow Longside Edge, first ascending Ullock Pike, Longside and Carl Side before making the steep climb up from Carlside Col. Also from the north, a somewhat tougher alternative is to walk up Buzzard Knott between Southerndale and Barkbethdale: after crossing to the southern edge of the shoulder above Randel Crag ascend due east to the summit. Rather easier than either of these is the compass-walk due south from Cock Up (); reversing this route provides a safe descent, especially in bad weather. Scramblers may prefer simply to walk up Southerndale and climb Longside via a distinctive crevice seen easily from Skiddaw summit.

From the south-west at Millbeck, Carlside Col can be reached directly. A start from nearby Applethwaite can also be used to provide a variation to the tourist route. From the north-west a tough but picturesque ascent can be made to the northern end of Longside Edge before following the ridge route to the summit. Finally, ascents from due east are possible for the walker who first makes for Skiddaw House, a good distance from either Keswick, Threlkeld or Peter House. Once Skiddaw House is reached a fairly direct line is possible, climbing over either Sale How or Hare Crag.
From the north-east an unmarked but quite easy and fairly well-worn path starts at Whitewater Dash waterfall (on the Cumbrian Way) where the walker can follow the fence (along Birkett Edge just south of Dead Crags) past the Bakestall outcrop, and follow the fence until just before the unnamed top at . From the 831m top, a path leads directly to Skiddaw Man.

==Etymology==
Early forms of the name from the include &quot;Skythou&quot; in c.1260 and &quot;Skydehow&quot; in 1247. According to Eilert Ekwall, Skiddaw&#x27;s name is derived from the Old Norse elements &quot;skyti&quot; or &quot;skut&quot; + &quot;haugr&quot; meaning either &quot;archer&#x27;s hill&quot; or &quot;jutting crag hill&quot;. Diana Whaley likewise interprets it as &quot;the mountain with the jutting crag&quot;, but also offers the alternative that the first element may be a personal name or Old Norse &quot;skítr&quot; &#x27;dung, filth, shit&#x27;. Richard Coates suggests that &quot;it is possible that a Cumbric solution is to be sought.&quot;

==Skiddaw House==

Below Sale How is Skiddaw House, a stone building which has variously served as a shooting lodge, a shepherd&#x27;s bothy and a Youth Hostel. Its windbreak comprises the only trees in Skiddaw Forest, and it is reached by a long access track up the Dash Valley.
Built around 1829 by the Earl of Egremont, it was originally a keeper&#x27;s lodge: a base for grouse shooting and for the gamekeepers who managed the extensive land owned by Egremont in Skiddaw Forest.

Little is known of the house in the 19th century, but it was used by both gamekeepers and shepherds beyond 1860 and there were rooms for Egremont and the shooting parties. Canon Rawnsley, a founder of the National Trust, visited in about 1900 and mentions in one of his books the hospitality of the shepherd&#x27;s family at that time. Sir Hugh Walpole, author of the Lake District novel &quot;Rogue Herries&quot;, was a visitor in the 1920s and 30s and used the house as the scene, set in 1854, of the murder by Uhland.

These arrangements for accommodation continued until the early 1950s. Several families brought up their children there until they were able to go to school, but the longest tenure was possibly that of Pearson Dalton, a shepherd and bachelor from the Caldbeck area, who came to stay for a month in 1952 and left in 1969 aged 75. He lived there alone for five days a week, only going home for long weekends with his sister in Caldbeck, then returning on the Monday to resume his duties. By that time farming practices had changed and the house was no longer needed; it declined, although there was intermittent use by various schools and outdoor groups.

In 1986 the house was leased by John Bothamley, who had created the YHA Carrock Fell Hostel away; and eventually the building was handed over to the YHA. It closed in 2002 following a disagreement over the lease. In 2007 it re-opened as an independent hostel run by the Skiddaw House Foundation, under the YHA&#x27;s Enterprise franchising model.

==2024 purchase==
In 2024, of Skiddaw Forest was purchased by the Cumbria Wildlife Trust for £6.25m, as part of a long-term rewilding project, which the trust says will see the re-introduction of hen harriers, black grouse, water voles, aspen and rare upland bumblebees. The plan includes planting 300,000 native trees over of the site (but specifically excluding the summit of Skiddaw). The peat bogs that cover one third of the site will be rewetted by blocking drains and holding back water so that the peat remains saturated. The purchase was partly funded by a £5m grant from Aviva, with a public appeal being launched to raise the balance.

== Civil parish ==
Skiddaw was a civil parish, in 1931 the parish had a population of 5. On 1 April 1934 the parish was abolished and merged with Underskiddaw.

==In literature==

In &quot;A Stranger Minstrel&quot; (published 1800), Samuel Taylor Coleridge remarks on Skiddaw&#x27;s characteristic &quot;helm of cloud&quot;, and observes atmospheric effects and the play of sunlight across the landscape: &quot;yon small flaky mists that love to creep / Along the edges of those spots of light, / Those sunny islands on thy smooth green heights.&quot; Coleridge also mentioned Skiddaw in the valediction of his mnemonic poem &quot;Metrical Feet,&quot; which he addressed to his son Derwent, who had been born nearby; he wrote, &quot;Could you stand upon Skiddaw, you would not from its whole ridge / See a man who so loves you as your fond S.T. Coleridge.&quot;

Skiddaw is mentioned in the fourth book of John Keats&#x27;s poem &quot;Endymion&quot;:
&quot;…with all the stress / Of vision search&#x27;d for him, as one would look […] from old Skiddaw&#x27;s top, when fog conceals / His rugged forehead in a mantle pale, / With an eye-guess towards some pleasant vale / Descry a favourite hamlet faint and far.&quot;

Skiddaw is also mentioned in the final lines of the poem &quot;The Armada&quot; by Thomas Babington Macaulay, Lord Macaulay:
:&quot;Till Skiddaw saw the fire that burned on Gaunt&#x27;s embattled pile, 
:And the red glare on Skiddaw roused the burghers of Carlisle.&quot;

<doc id="634691" wikidata="Q1977515" url="?curid=634691" title="Neofunctionalism">
<text>Neofunctionalism is a theory of regional integration which downplays globalisation and reintroduces territory into its governance. Neofunctionalism is often regarded as the first European integration theory developed by Ernst B. Haas in 1958 as part of his PhD research on the European Coal and Steel Community. Neofunctionalism seeks to explain the European integration process and why states accept to become a part of supranational organization. Jean Monnet&#x27;s approach to European integration, which aimed at integrating individual sectors in hopes of achieving spillover effects to further the process of integration, is said to have followed the neofunctional school&#x27;s tack.

Ernst B. Haas, later declared the theory of neofunctionalism obsolete, a statement he revoked in his final book, after the process of European integration started stalling in the 1960s, when Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s &quot;Empty Chair&quot; politics paralyzed the institutions of the European Coal and Steel Community, European Economic Community, and European Atomic Energy Community. The theory was updated and further specified namely by Wayne Sandholtz, Alec Stone Sweet, and their collaborators in the 1990s and in the 2000s (references below). The main contributions of these authors was an employment of empiricism.

After the Maastricht Treaty, neo-functionalism evolved to include new perspectives: ‘legal integration theories,’ ‘institutionalist approaches,’ the ‘constructivist sociohistorical approach,’ and ‘neo-neo-functionalism.’ While not all of these approaches explicitly identify as neo-functionalist, they have refined the original theory to better explain the decision-making processes and the expansion of supranational governance within European integration. This reflects the continued relevance and adaptation of neo-functionalism in understanding how states engage with and support supranational organizations, particularly within the context of European integration.

Today, neofunctionalism is one of the best-known theories of European integration. In the last decades Haas&#x27; theory has been revived by several authors, who describe the neofunctionalist theoretical legacy left by him as able to speak directly to current EU studies and comparative regionalism, if it is seen as a dynamic theory that corresponds to established social scientific norms with disciplinary openness. Moreover, it frequently draws upon interdisciplinary perspectives, integrating insights from economics, psychology, and cultural studies to enrich the analysis of political phenomena, often using European integration as a primary laboratory for examining the social integration of political entities.

== Key theoretical arguments ==
Neofunctionalism describes and explains the process of regional integration with reference to how three causal factors interact:
* Growing economic interdependence between nations
* Organizational capacity to resolve disputes and build international legal regimes
* Supranational market rules that replace national regulatory regimes

Early neofunctionalist theory assumed a decline in importance of nationalism and the nation-state; it predicted that, gradually, elected officials, interest groups, and large commercial interests within states would see it in their interests to pursue welfarist objectives best satisfied by the political and market integration at a higher, supranational level. Haas theorized three mechanisms that he thought would drive the integration forward: positive spillover, the transfer of domestic allegiances and technocratic automaticity.
* Positive spillover effect is the notion that integration between states in one economic sector will create strong incentives for integration in further sectors, in order to fully capture the perks of integration in the sector in which it started.
* Increased number of transactions and intensity of negotiations then takes place hand in hand with increasing regional integration. This leads to a creation of institutions that work without reference to &quot;local&quot; governments.
* The mechanism of a transfer in domestic allegiances can be best understood by first noting that an important assumption within neofunctionalist thinking is of a pluralistic society within the relevant nation states. Neofunctionalists claim that as the process of integration gathers pace, interest groups and associations will transfer their allegiances away from national institutions towards the supranational European institutions. They will do this because they will, in theory, come to realise that these newly formed institutions are a better conduit through which to pursue their material interests.
* Greater regulatory complexity is then needed and other institutions on regional level are usually called for. This causes integration to be transferred to higher levels of decision-making processes.
* Technocratic automaticity described the way in which, as integration proceeds, the supranational institutions set up to oversee that integration process will themselves take the lead in sponsoring further integration as they become more powerful and more autonomous of the member states. In the Haas-Schmitter model, size of unit, rate of transactions, pluralism, and elite complementarity are the background conditions on which the process of integration depends.
* Just as Rosamond put it, political integration will then become an &quot;inevitable&quot; side effect of integration in economic sectors.

Neofunctionalism was modified and updated in two important books that helped to revive the study of European integration: &quot;European Integration and Supranational Governance&quot; (1998) by Wayne Sandholtz and Alec Stone Sweet, and &quot;The Institutionalization of Europe&quot; (2001) by Sandholtz, Stone Sweet, and Neil Fligstein. Sandholtz and Stone Sweet describe and assess the evolution of Neofunctionalist theory and empirical research in their 2009 paper, &quot;Neo-functionalism and Supranational Governance&quot;.

== Critiques of Neofunctionalism ==

=== Empirical level ===
Despite its profound insights in regional integration, neofunctionalism is widely criticized at an empirical level for failing to account the reality of the European Communities. Neofunctionalism predicts a progressive political integration, but such a development did not occur in the 1970s. The absence or the slow pace of regional integration in Western Europe throughout the 1970s and early 1980s has been the focus of the critique. The French boycott of the European institutions in the mid-1960s, led by then French President Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s &quot;Empty Chair&quot; policy, had led to recognize the importance of political leaders as constraints on the integration process. The neofunctionalists have acknowledged that &quot;de Gaulle has proved us wrong&quot;.

Haas also talked about &quot;spillback&quot;, a disintegrative equivalent to spillover. Brexit can be regarded as an example of spillback process in the EU. Neofunctionalist framework does not predict that a major country chooses to leave the EU. However, neofunctionalism scholars may argue that spillback processes are often followed by spillovers, that crises are opportunities to further integrate in the long run. As Jean Monnet famously puts in his memoirs, &quot;Europe will be forged in crises and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises&quot;.

=== Theoretical level ===
On theoretical grounds, Intergovernmentalism is a theory on European integration which rejects the neofunctionalist mechanisms of integration. Intergovernmentalism is an alternative theory of political integration that also aims to explain the integration process, where power in international organizations is possessed by the member-states and decisions are made unanimously. Independent appointees of the governments or elected representatives have solely advisory or implementational functions. Intergovernmentalism is used by most international organizations today. An alternative method of decision-making in international organizations is supranationalism.

The theory, initially proposed by Stanley Hoffmann (classical intergovernmentalism) and refined by Andrew Moravcsik (liberal intergovernmentalism) suggests that governments control the level and speed of European integration. Any increase in power at supranational level, Moravcsik argues, results from a direct decision by governments who make decisions based on a domestic agenda. The theory rejects the spillover-effect argument and the idea that supranational organisations wield political influence on par with that of national governments.

Neofunctionalists have criticized intergovernmentalism on theoretical grounds as well as on the basis of empirical evidence, which they claim demonstrates that intergovernmentalism is incapable of explaining the dynamics and trajectory of European integration.

<text>William Manuel Morris, Baron Morris of Handsworth (born 19 October 1938) is a former British trade union leader. He was General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union from 1992 to 2003, and the first black leader of a major British trade union.

Morris sat in the House of Lords, under the Labour Party whip, from 2006 to 2020.

==Early life==
Bill Morris was born in Manchester Parish, Jamaica. After the death of his father, William, a part-time policeman, his mother, Una, emigrated to England to find work settling in Handsworth, Birmingham. Morris joined her in the UK in 1954, finding work at a local car parts manufacturer, Hardy Spicer Engineering Ltd.

Morris married Minetta in 1957. His wife died in 1990. They have two sons.

==Trade union career==
Morris joined the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union in 1958, and became a shop steward in 1962. After serving on the TGWU General Executive Council (GEC) from 1972 to 1973, Bill Morris joined the union as a full-time official. He served as district officer of the Nottingham District from 1973 to 1976 and district secretary of the Northampton District from 1976 to 1979. In 1979, he became national secretary of the Passenger Services Trade Group, which was responsible for staff working for bus and coach companies. He was elected deputy general secretary on the 18 September 1985, working under general secretary Ron Todd.

Morris was elected general secretary when Ron Todd retired in 1992. He was re-elected in 1995, ahead of Jack Dromey. He remained in the post until his retirement on his 65th birthday, 19 October 2003, when he was succeeded as general secretary by Tony Woodley.

Morris was a member of the TUC General Council and executive committee from 1988 to 2003. He was appointed a non-executive director of the Bank of England in 1998. He was also a member of the Royal Commission on the Reform of the House of Lords from 1999 to 2000. He is a member of the Board of Governors of London South Bank University, a Trustee of the Open University Foundation, and the member of the Courts of the University of Northampton and the University of Bedfordshire. He was appointed as the first Chancellor of the University of Technology, Jamaica in 1999 and as Chancellor of Staffordshire University in 2004. He has been a member of the advisory councils of the BBC and IBA and a Commissioner of the Commission for Racial Equality. He chaired the Morris Inquiry into professional standards in the Metropolitan Police in 2004. He sits as a member of the Employment Appeal Tribunal. He is also a patron of the Refugee Council. In 1995 he refused to give union backing to 500 Liverpool dock workers who were sacked, claiming that it was an unofficial strike even though the union had failed to act on concerns relayed to the union in the lead up to the dispute, in effect leaving the dock workers to fight the cause themselves.

Morris is an independent non-executive Director of the England and Wales Cricket Board.

==House of Lords==
Morris was awarded the Order of Jamaica in 2002 and received a knighthood in the 2003 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. On 11 April 2006, it was announced that Morris would take a seat in the House of Lords as a working life peer, and he was gazetted as Baron Morris of Handsworth, of Handsworth in the County of West Midlands in June 2006. He served on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights.

In August 2014, Morris was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

He retired from the House of Lords on 21 July 2020.

<doc id="634695" wikidata="Q2329462" url="?curid=634695" title="Khufu and Khafre">
<text>In cryptography, Khufu and Khafre are two block ciphers designed by Ralph Merkle in 1989 while working at Xerox&#x27;s Palo Alto Research Center. Along with Snefru, a cryptographic hash function, the ciphers were named after the Egyptian Pharaohs Khufu, Khafre and Sneferu.

Under a voluntary scheme, Xerox submitted Khufu and Khafre to the US National Security Agency (NSA) prior to publication. NSA requested that Xerox not publish the algorithms, citing concerns about national security. Xerox, a large contractor to the US government, complied. However, a reviewer of the paper passed a copy to John Gilmore, who made it available via the sci.crypt newsgroup. It would appear this was against Merkle&#x27;s wishes. The scheme was subsequently published at the 1990 CRYPTO conference (Merkle, 1990).

Khufu and Khafre were patented by Xerox; the patent was issued on March 26, 1991.

==Khufu==

Khufu is a 64-bit block cipher which, unusually, uses keys of size 512 bits; block ciphers typically have much smaller keys, rarely exceeding 256 bits. Most of the key material is used to construct the cipher&#x27;s S-boxes. Because the key-setup time is quite time consuming, Khufu is not well suited to situations in which many small messages are handled. It is better suited to bulk encryption of large amounts of data.

Khufu is a Feistel cipher with 16 rounds by default (other multiples of eight between 8 and 64 are allowed). Each set of eight rounds is termed an &quot;octet&quot;; a different S-box is used in each octet. In a round, the least significant byte of half of the block is passed into the 8×32-bit S-box. The S-box output is then combined (using XOR) with the other 32-bit half. The left half is rotated to bring a new byte into position, and the halves are swapped. At the start and end of the algorithm, extra key material is XORed with the block (key whitening). Other than this, all the key is contained in the S-boxes.

There is a differential attack on 16 rounds of Khufu which can recover the secret key. It requires 243 chosen plaintexts and has a 243 time complexity (Gilbert and Chauvaud, 1994). 232 plaintexts and complexity are required merely to distinguish the cipher from random. A boomerang attack (Wagner, 1999) can be used in an adaptive chosen plaintext / chosen ciphertext scenario with 218 queries and a similar time complexity. Khufu is also susceptible to an impossible differential attack, which can break up to 18 rounds of the cipher (Biham &quot;et al.&quot;, 1999).

Schneier and Kelsey (1996) categorise Khafre and Khufu as &quot;even incomplete heterogeneous target-heavy Unbalanced Feistel Networks&quot;.

==Khafre==

Khafre is similar to Khufu, but uses a standard set of S-boxes, and does not compute them from the key. (Rather, they are generated from the RAND tables, used as a source of &quot;nothing up my sleeve numbers&quot;.) An advantage is that Khafre can encrypt a small amount of data very rapidly — it has good &quot;key agility&quot;. However, Khafre probably requires a greater number of rounds to achieve a similar level of security as Khufu, making it slower at bulk encryption. Khafre uses a key whose size is a multiple of 64 bits. Because the S-boxes are not key-dependent, Khafre XORs subkeys every eight rounds.

Differential cryptanalysis is effective against Khafre: 16 rounds can be broken using either 1500 chosen plaintexts or 238 known plaintexts. Similarly, 24 rounds can be attacked using 253 chosen plaintexts or 259 known plaintexts.

<text>The is a Japanese railway line connecting Toyohashi Station in Toyohashi, Aichi with Tatsuno Station in Tatsuno, Nagano, operated by Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central). The line links eastern Aichi Prefecture and southern Nagano Prefecture through northwestern Shizuoka Prefecture. It goes through steep mountains as well as cities such as Iida and Ina. The line was originally of four different private railway lines, the first of which opened in 1897.

The line has an unusually high number of so-called Hikyō stations, or &quot;hikyo-eki&quot;, which have since lost their nearby communities due to depopulation. There are 94 such stations along the route. The line has been described as the &quot;holy land for those who love touring hikyo-eki&quot;. The phrase was coined in 1999 by Takanobu Ushiyama and friends, for railroad stations that are isolated and little used.

Traveling the entire length of the 195.7 km (121.6 mi) line by local trains takes six hours.

==Basic data==
*Operators, distances:
**Central Japan Railway Company (Services and tracks)
***Toyohashi – Tatsuno: 195.7 km (121.6 mi)
**Japan Freight Railway Company (Services)
***Toyohashi – Toyokawa: 8.7 km (5.4 mi)
***Motozenkōji – Tatsuno: 61.9 km (38.5 mi)
*Double-tracked section: Toyohashi – Toyokawa
*Railway signalling:
**Toyokawa – Tatsuno: Special Automatic, a simplified automatic system.
*CTC center: Iida Operation Control Center

==Services==

The limited express runs between Toyohashi and Iida twice a day. The rapid runs between Iida and Okaya. Local service is generally divided into three parts by Hon-Nagashino and Tenryūkyō stations. The section near Toyohashi functions as commuter rail for the city, while the section between Hon-Nagashino and Tenryūkyō is a mountain railway with fewer passengers.

==History==

The Toyokawa Railway opened the section from Toyohashi to Toyokawa in 1897, extending the line to Omi in 1900. At the northern end, the Ina Electric Railway opened the Tatsuno to Ina-Matsushima section (electrified at 1,200 V DC) in 1909, extending the line to Tenryukyo in sections between 1911 and 1927. The Horaitera Railway opened the Omi to Mikawa-Kawai section in 1923, and electrified it at 1,500 V DC in 1925 in conjunction with the electrification of the Toyohashi to Omi section the same year. The Toyohashi to Toyokawa section was double-tracked the following year. The Sanshin Railway opened the Tenryukyo to Kadoshima section as an electrified (1,500 V DC) line in 1932, the Mikawa-Kawai to Toei section (and all subsequent stages) as an electrified line in 1933, and connected the two sections (completing the line) in 1936. All four companies were nationalised in 1943.

In 1955, the overhead line voltage of the Tatsuno to Tenryukyo section was increased to 1,500 V DC.

CTC signalling was commissioned on the line between 1983 and 1984, and freight services ceased in 1996.

===Former connecting lines===
* Hon-Nagashino Station: A 23 km line to Mikawa-Taguchi, electrified at 1,500 V DC, opened between 1930 and 1932. Two 762mm gauge forest railways connected to this line: the Damine forest railway, which connected at the station of the same name, consisted of a 19 km &#x27;main line&#x27; (including a tunnel) and a 7 km branch, operated between 1932 and 1960; the Taguchi forest railway connected at the terminus station, consisted of a 10 km &#x27;main line&#x27; and a 6 km branch, operated between 1934 and 1963. Both forest railways were notable for initially employing people and &quot;large dogs&quot; to haul the empty wagons upgrade, which then rolled downhill when loaded. The Mikawa-Taguchi line closed following flood damage in 1968.

===Proposed connecting line===
* Chubu-Tenryu Station: Construction started on a 35 km line to Tenryu-Futamata on the Hamanako Line in 1967. Proposed to involve 20 bridges and 14 tunnels, about 13 km of roadbed, and about 50% of the overall work had been completed when construction was abandoned in 1980.

<doc id="634747" wikidata="Q549418" url="?curid=634747" title="Kentucky coffeetree">
<text>The Kentucky coffee tree (Gymnocladus dioicus), also known as American coffee berry, Kentucky mahogany, nicker tree, and stump tree, is a tree in the subfamily Caesalpinioideae of the legume family Fabaceae, native to the Midwest, Upper South, Appalachia, and small pockets of New York in the United States and Ontario in Canada. The seed may be roasted and used as a substitute for coffee beans; however, unroasted pods and seeds are toxic. The wood from the tree is used by cabinetmakers and carpenters. It is also planted as a street tree.

From 1976 to 1994, the Kentucky coffeetree was the state tree of Kentucky, after which the tulip poplar was returned to that designation.

==Description==

The tree varies from 18 to 21 meters (60–70 feet) high with a spread of 12–15 meters (40–50 feet) and a trunk up to one meter (3 feet) in diameter. The tree grows at a medium rate with height increases of anywhere from 12&quot; to 24&quot; per year. A 10-year-old sapling will stand about 4 meters (13 feet) tall. It usually separates 3 to 4½ meters (10–15 feet) from the ground into three or four divisions which spread slightly and form a narrow pyramidal head; or when crowded by other trees, sending up one tall central branchless shaft to the height of 15–21 m (50–70 ft). Branches are stout, pithy, and blunt; roots are fibrous.

The Kentucky coffeetree is a moderately fast-growing tree, and male trees are often grown in parks and along city streets for ornamental purposes. The tree is typically fairly short-lived, healthy trees living from 100 to 150 years. The Kentucky coffeetree sheds its leaves early during the fall and appears bare for up to 6 months. The naked appearance of the tree is reflected through the Kentucky coffeetree&#x27;s Greek genus name, which means &quot;naked branch&quot;. Like the Sumac, branches are absent of fine spray; smaller branches are thick and lumpish. Because of the absence of smaller branches and its later leafing, the French in Canada named it Chicot, &quot;stubby&quot;. The expanding leaves are conspicuous because of the varied colors of the leaflets; the youngest are bright pink, while those which are older vary from green to bronze.

The bark is ash-gray and scaly, flaking similarly to black cherry, but more so. The trees are dioecious, and the fruit is a hard-shelled bean in heavy, woody, thick-walled pods filled with sweet, thick, gooey pulp. Pod length ranges from ; unfertilized female trees may bear miniature seedless pods. The beans are commonly thought to contain the toxin cytisine, although this has yet to be confirmed in a study.

* Bark: Tan or dark gray, deeply fissured, surface scaly, often with prominent narrow ridges. Branchlets at first coated with short reddish down.
* Wood: Light brown; heavy, strong, coarse-grained; durable in contact with the ground, takes a fine polish. Specific gravity, 0.6934; weight of cubic foot, .
* Winter buds: Minute, depressed in downy cavities of the stem, two in the axil of each leaf, the smaller sterile. Bud scales two, ovate, coated with brown tomentum and growing with the shoot, become orange green, hairy and about one inch long, before they fall.
* Leaves: Alternate, bipinnately compound, ten to fourteen pinnate, lowest pinnae reduced to leaflets, the other seven to thirteen foliate. One to three feet long, eighteen to twenty-four inches broad, by the greater development of the upper pairs of pinnae. Leaf stalks and stalks of pinnae, are terete, enlarged at base, smooth when mature, pale green, often purple on the upper side. Leaflets ovate, two to two and one-half inches long, wedge-shaped or irregularly rounded at base, with wavy margin, acute apex. They come out of the bud bright pink, but soon become bronze green, smooth and shining above. When full grown are dark yellow green above, pale green beneath. In autumn turn a bright clear yellow. Stipules leaf-like, lanceolate, serrate, deciduous.
*Winter twigs are very stout and dark reddish brown to green brown in color; the pith is very thick and salmon pink to brown in color. The terminal bud is absent, and the lateral buds are small, bronze in color, and appear to be partially sunken beneath the bark of the twig. The leaf scars are very large, heart shaped with 3 to 5 conspicuous bundle scars. The flowers are dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants). The female flowers are 8 to 12 inches long, greenish white in color, appear in early summer, and are quite fragrant. The male flowers are about half the size of the female flowers.
* Flowers: June. Dioecious by abortion, terminal, greenish white. Staminate flowers in a short raceme-like corymb three to four inches (75–100 mm) long, pistillate flowers in a raceme ten to twelve inches (250–300 mm) long.
* Calyx: Tubular, hairy, ten-ribbed, five-lobed; lobes valvate in bud, acute, nearly equal.
* Corolla: Petals five, oblong, hairy, spreading or reflexed, imbricate in bud.
* Stamens: Ten, five long and five short, free, included; filaments thread-like; anthers orange colored, ; in the pistillate flower small and sterile.
* Pistil: Ovary superior, sessile, hairy, contracted into a short style, with two stigmatic lobes; ovules in two rows.
* Fruit: Legume, six to ten inches (150–250 mm) long, one and one-half to two inches wide, somewhat curved, with thickened margins, dark reddish brown with slight glaucous bloom, crowned with remnant of the styles. Stalks an inch or two long. Seeds six to nine, surrounded by a thick layer of dark, sweet pulp.
* Rooting Habit, &quot;Tap Root in proportion like a carrot&quot;. A seedling tree grows many times in root length to its growth upward in height. The Kentucky coffee tree is not commonly offered in the nursery trade because the taproot makes the tree somewhat difficult to transplant. Being in the Legume family the roots fix nitrogen in the soil.
*Soil: Prefers rich, moist soils in floodplains, terraces, ravines, coves, and lower slopes.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Gymnocladus&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek (&quot;kládos&quot;) &quot;branch&quot; and (&quot;gumnós&quot;) &quot;naked&quot; and refers to the stout branchlets unclothed with small twigs.

It is one of five species in the genus &quot;Gymnocladus&quot;, and the only one native to North America; the other four being native to South, Southeast and Eastern Asia.

The name is sometimes hyphenated as &#x27;coffee-tree&#x27;; the form &#x27;coffeetree&#x27; here is as used officially by the United States Forest Service.

==Distribution==
The Kentucky coffeetree is considered a rare tree species. &quot;Rare species are those that are so uncommon that they should be monitored to determine whether their populations are becoming threatened.&quot; It is widely distributed, but rare.

The tree&#x27;s native range is limited, occurring from Southern Ontario, Canada and in the United States from Kentucky (where it was first encountered by Europeans) and Connecticut in the east, to Kansas, eastern Nebraska, and southeastern South Dakota in the west, to southern Wisconsin and Michigan in the north, and to northern Louisiana in the south. It is planted as an urban shade tree across the United States and eastern Canada, including California. It has a disjunct population in Central New York.

This tree usually occurs as widely dispersed individuals or small colonial groups with interconnected root systems. This tree is found in floodplains and river valleys but is also sometimes seen on rocky hillsides and limestone woods. In the northeastern part of its range, seemingly natural groves of this tree are actually associated with known prehistoric village sites. In some parts of its range, this tree may be used as an indicator of the presence of limestone or of calcareous soils.

The Kentucky coffeetree is considered an example of an evolutionary anachronism. The tough, leathery seed pods are too difficult for many extant animals to chew through (in addition to being poisonous) and they are too heavy for either wind or water dispersal. It has been hypothesized that the tree would have been browsed upon by now-extinct mammalian megafauna, which ate the pods and nicked the seeds with their large teeth, aiding in germination. This behavior is seen among African elephants eating &quot;Fabaceae&quot; relatives in Africa. Because of this, its prehistoric range may have been much larger than it has been in historical times. Today, in the wild, it only grows well in wetlands, and it is thought that only in such wet conditions can the seed pods rot away to allow germination in the absence of large herbivores.

==Uses==

===Cultivation===
&quot;Gymnocladus dioicus&quot; is considered well-suited to urban environments, as it is tolerant of poor soils, has extreme drought tolerance, and is not vulnerable to serious insect infestations or disease problems. It is cultivated by specialty tree plant nurseries as an ornamental tree for planting in gardens and parks. The peculiarly late-emerging and early-dropping leaves, coupled with the fact that the large leaves mean few twigs in the winter profile, make it a tree that is ideal for urban shading where winter sunlight is to be maximized (such as in proximity to solar hot-air systems).

It is often planted because of its unique appearance and interesting character. There are several Kentucky coffeetrees at Mount Vernon, in the gardens along the path leading up to the house of George Washington.

Trees prefer a rich moist soil, such as bottom lands. Their growth is largely unaffected by heat, cold, drought, insects, disease, road salt, ice, and alkaline soil.
Kentucky coffeetree is easy to grow from seed. Filing the seedcoat by hand with a small file, and then soaking the seeds in water for 24 hours will ensure rapid germination. Propagation is also easy from dormant root cuttings from December through March.

The Kentucky coffeetree is typically found on &quot;alluvial soils of river and flood plains and nearby terraces&quot;. Here it may be locally abundant and form large clonal colonies, reproducing by shoots sprouting from roots.

===Food===
The beans of the tree were eaten, after roasting, in the Meskwaki (Fox), Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) and Pawnee Native American cultures.

The Meskwaki also drank the roasted ground seeds in a hot beverage similar to coffee. The common name &quot;coffeetree&quot; derives from this latter use of the roasted seeds, which was imitated by settlers because it seemed a substitute for coffee, especially in times of poverty, similar to chicory. The European colonialists, however, considered it inferior to real coffee:

The roasted seeds can be eaten like sweet chestnuts. Usefully, the fruits can be collected and picked up from the tree or ground at any time during fall, winter, and spring.

====Toxicity====
Caution should be used when consuming, as unroasted or only partially roasted beans and pods are considered poisonous and are reputed to contain the alkaloid cytisine. The pods, preserved like those of the tamarind, can be eaten and are slightly aperient (laxative). Many sources claim that roasting the seeds for a certain length of time can reduce or eliminate the cytisine thought to be in them, but this is not based on scientific evidence. There are however, many anecdotal accounts of people drinking a coffee-like drink made from the seeds without suffering any adverse health effects, although most reported the taste to be unpleasant.

The plant is toxic to some animals and may intoxicate dogs.

===Culture===
In addition to use as a food, the seeds of Kentucky coffeetree were used by Native Americans for ceremonial and recreational purposes. Seeds were used as dice in games of chance that were common in eastern tribes. It is likely that indigenous community members carved patterns on coffeetree seeds used in ceremonial dice games, which also served to scarify the seeds and prepare them for germination. The seeds were also used in jewelry. The importance of the Kentucky coffeetree to Native Americans undoubtedly contributed to its dispersal.

&quot;Gymnocladus dioicus&quot; is used as a street tree as far north as Québec city, Québec. It resists harsh winters and de-icing salts.

===Woodworking===
The wood is used both by cabinetmakers and carpenters. It has very little sapwood.

==Notable specimens==

A specimen with a height of was referenced in La Turpinerie, commune of Geay, a short distance from the Charente in south-west France, growing in a typical calcareous soil (see Minutes of Congrès international de sylviculture de Paris, June 1900). Cut during the 20th century, it had a circumference of and was the tallest in the country at this time.

A Kentucky coffeetree, said to have been brought to the UK in 1812, stands in Mountsfield Park in the London Borough of Lewisham.

A Kentucky coffeetree found in the Will Rogers Park in Amarillo, Texas has been confirmed to be the largest of its kind in Texas. Texas A&amp;M Forest Service said, has a circumference of 92 inches, a height of 51 feet and a crown spread of 52 feet.

A Kentucky coffeetree lives in Rhode Island in the Roger Williams Park Zoo at 1000 Elmwood Avenue, Providence.

At the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama, 19 Kentucky coffeetrees are planted in the Apollo courtyard prior to entry into the museum.

In 2022, the Tree Board for the town of Hillsborough, North Carolina, selected a grove of Kentucky coffeetrees as its 2022 Treasure Tree. Originally the grove was mis-identified as a part of a program to remove invasive species, but the North Carolina Forest Service helped to confirm the proper identification of the trees.

The largest Kentucky coffeetree in New Hampshire, at 91 ft tall, is on the campus of Dartmouth College.

===Gold medal game===
==Gold medal game==
An exciting gold medal game saw Sweden force overtime by tying the score with less than two minutes to go. After a scoreless overtime, the winner was determined by a shootout. The first five rounds saw two players for each side make their penalty shots (Nedved and Kariya for Canada and Forsberg and Svensson for Sweden). In the sixth round, both Nedved and Svensson missed their shots. Forsberg then scored on Canadian goaltender Hirsch to start the seventh round. Kariya took Canada&#x27;s seventh round shot and was stopped by Swedish goaltender Salo—giving the Swedes the gold medal.

===Commemorative Swedish stamp===
In 1995, the Swedish postal service memorialized Forsberg&#x27;s game winning shootout goal by issuing a commemorative stamp. Because goaltender Corey Hirsch would not grant permission for his likeness to be used on the stamp, he was &#x27;disguised&#x27; by means of changing the color of his sweater and his player number.

<doc id="634759" wikidata="Q1959890" url="?curid=634759" title="Hausdorff paradox">
<text>The Hausdorff paradox is a paradox in mathematics named after Felix Hausdorff. It involves the sphere formula_1 (the surface of a 3-dimensional ball in formula_2). It states that if a certain countable subset is removed from formula_3, then the remainder can be divided into three disjoint subsets formula_4 and formula_5 such that formula_6 and formula_7 are all congruent. In particular, it follows that on formula_8 there is no finitely additive measure defined on all subsets such that the measure of congruent sets is equal (because this would imply that the measure of formula_7 is simultaneously formula_10, formula_11, and formula_12 of the non-zero measure of the whole sphere).

The paradox was published in &quot;Mathematische Annalen&quot; in 1914 and also in Hausdorff&#x27;s book, &quot;Grundzüge der Mengenlehre&quot;, the same year. The proof of the much more famous Banach–Tarski paradox uses Hausdorff&#x27;s ideas. The proof of this paradox relies on the axiom of choice. 

This paradox shows that there is no finitely additive measure on a sphere defined on &quot;all&quot; subsets which is equal on congruent pieces. (Hausdorff first showed in the same paper the easier result that there is no &quot;countably&quot; additive measure defined on all subsets.) The structure of the group of rotations on the sphere plays a crucial role here the statement is not true on the plane or the line. In fact, as was later shown by Banach, it is possible to define an &quot;area&quot; for &quot;all&quot; bounded subsets in the Euclidean plane (as well as &quot;length&quot; on the real line) in such a way that congruent sets will have equal &quot;area&quot;. (This Banach measure, however, is only finitely additive, so it is not a measure in the full sense, but it equals the Lebesgue measure on sets for which the latter exists.) This implies that if two open subsets of the plane (or the real line) are equi-decomposable then they have equal area.

<text>Johann Puch (, 27 June 1862 – 19 July 1914) was a Slovene inventor and mechanic who went on to become the founder of the Austrian Puch automobile plants, then one of the most significant vehicle producers in Europe.

==Biography==
Johann Puch was born on 27 June 1862 to Slovene peasants at house no. 79 in Sakušak near Ptuj (&quot;Pettau&quot;), part of Lower Styria, Slovenia. He was the son of the cottager Franz Puch and Agnes Ziserl Puch, and he was baptized &quot;Johann Puch&quot; the same day in Juršinci. The eldest son of nine children, he left his family home at the age of eight and at twelve apprenticed as a locksmith in Ptuj. Having finished his training in 1877, he moved to the Styrian capital Graz, where he did his military service and from 1885 worked for several employers. He concentrated on bicycle manufacturing and soon became a noted specialist. On 18 September 1889, he married Maria Anna Reinitzhuber at the cathedral in Graz.

In 1889 Puch travelled to a bicycle trade fair in Leipzig, where he concluded a contract with Thomas Humber&#x27;s cycle company. The same year he founded his first workshop in Graz and started to distribute &quot;Styria&quot; safety bicycles. His enterprise quickly expanded and in 1891 he founded the &quot;Johann Puch &amp; Comp.&quot; trading company with 34 employees, selling bicycles all over Austria-Hungary, as well as exporting to the United Kingdom and France. Racers on &quot;Styria&quot; bicycles were successful in long-distance road races, most notably Josef Fischer, winner of the first edition of Paris–Roubaix in 1896. At that time, Puch already employed more than 300 workers and sold about 6,000 bicycle per annum.

His achievements but also discrepancies with his affiliates led to the founding of his own manufacturing company in 1899, called &quot;Johann Puch - Erste steiermärkische Fahrrad-Fabriks-Actien Gesellschaft&quot; (First Styrian Bicycle Stock Company) in Graz. The company started producing motorcycles in 1903 and automobiles in 1904. By 1912 Puch&#x27;s factory employed 1,100 workers and manufactured 300 cars, 300 motorcycles and 16,000 bicycles per year. He retired in 1912 but remained honorary president of the company.

Up to 1914 Puch developed 21 different types of cars, and also lorries, buses, military and some other special vehicles, including sedan limousines for the imperial Habsburg family. He successfully obtained patents for more than 35 inventions and improvements. He died of a stroke while attending a horserace in Agram (&quot;Zagreb&quot;).

The Puch company manufactured vehicles for the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. Puch&#x27;s motorcycles and cars were successful in races and rallies all over Europe and carried his name among vehicle producers. From 1934 the tradition was continued by the Steyr-Daimler-Puch company in Graz and Vienna.

<text>Ecotypes are organisms which belong to the same species but possess different phenotypical features as a result of environmental factors such as elevation, climate and predation. Ecotypes can be seen in wide geographical distributions and may eventually lead to speciation. 

== Definition ==
In evolutionary ecology, an ecotype, sometimes called ecospecies, describes a genetically distinct geographic variety, population, or race within a species, which is genotypically adapted to specific environmental conditions.

Typically, though ecotypes exhibit phenotypic differences (such as in morphology or physiology) stemming from environmental heterogeneity, they are capable of interbreeding with other geographically adjacent ecotypes without loss of fertility or vigor.

==Summary==
An ecotype refers to organisms which belong to the same species but have different phenotypical characteristics as a result of their adaptations to different habitats. Differences between these two groups is attributed to phenotypic plasticity and are too few for them to be termed as wholly different species. Emergence of variants of the same species may occur in the same geographical region where different habitats provide distinct ecological niches for these organisms examples of these habitats include meadows, forests, swamps, and sand dunes. Where similar ecological conditions occur in widely separated places, it is possible for a similar ecotype to occur in the separated locations. An ecotype is different from a subspecies, which may exist across a number of different habitats. In animals, ecotypes owe their differing characteristics to the effects of a very local environment which has been hypothesized to lead to speciation through the emergence of reproductive barriers. Therefore, ecotypes have no taxonomic rank.

==Terminology==

Ecotypes are closely related to morphs or polymorphisms which is defined as the existence of distinct phenotypes among members of the same species. Another term closely related is genetic polymorphism; and it is when species of the same population display variation in a specific DNA sequence, i.e. as a result of having more than one allele in a gene&#x27;s locus.. In order to be classified as such, morphs must occupy the same habitat at the same time and belong to a panmictic population (whose members can all potentially interbreed). Polymorphism are maintained in populations of species by natural selection. In fact, Begon, Townsend, and Harper assert that

The notions &quot;form&quot; and &quot;ecotype&quot; may appear to correspond to a static phenomenon, however; this is not always the case. Evolution occurs continuously both in time and space, so that ecotypes or forms may qualify as distinct species in a few generations. Begon, Townsend, and Harper use an illuminating analogy on this:

Thus ecotypes and morphs can be thought of as precursory steps of potential speciation.

==Range and distribution==

Research indicates that sometimes ecotypes manifest when separated by great geographical distances as a result of genetic drift that may lead to significant genetic differences and hence variation. Ecotypes may also emerge from local adaptation of species occupying small geographical scales (&lt;1km), in such cases divergent selection due to selective pressure as a result of differences in microhabitats drive differentiation. Hybridization among populations may increase population gene flow and reduce the effects of natural selection.Hybridization here is defined as when different but adjacent varieties of the same species (or generally of the same taxonomic rank) interbreed, which helps overcome local selection. However other studies reveal that ecotypes may emerge even at very small scales (of the order of 10 m), within populations, and despite hybridization.

In ecotypes, it is common for continuous, gradual geographic variation to impose analogous phenotypic and genetic variation, a situation which leads to the emergence of clines. A well-known example of a cline is the skin color gradation in indigenous human populations worldwide, which is related to latitude and amounts of sunlight. Ecotypes may display two or more distinct and discontinuous phenotypes even within the same population. Ecological systems may have a species abundance that can be either bimodal or multimodal. Emergence of ecotypes may lead to speciation and can occur if conditions in a local environment change dramatically through space or time. 

== Ecotype and speciation ==

The birth of the term &#x27;ecotype&#x27; originally came from early interest in understanding speciation. Darwin argued that species evolved through natural selection from variations within population which he termed as &#x27;varieties&#x27;. Later on, through a series of experiments, Turresson studied the effect of the environment on heritable plant variation and came up with the term &#x27;ecotype&#x27; to denote differences between groups occupying distinct habitats. This, he argued, was a genotypical response of plants to habitat type and it denotes a first step toward isolating reproductive barriers that facilitate the emergence of &#x27;species&#x27; via divergence and, ultimately, genetic isolation. In his 1923 paper, Turesson states that variation among species in a population is not random, rather, it is driven by environmental selection pressure. For example, the maturity of &quot;Trifolium subterraneum&quot;, a clover which was found to correlate to moisture condition; when sown in low rainfall areas of Adelaide after a few years the population would consist of genotypes that produced seeds early in the season (early genotype), however in higher rainfall areas the clover population would shift to mid-season genotypes, differences among population of &quot;Trifolium subterraneum&quot; is in response to the selective action of the habitat. These adaptive differences were hereditary and would emerge in response to specific environmental conditions. Heritable differences is a key feature in ecotypic variation. Ecotypic variation is as a result of particular environmental trends. Individuals, which are able to survive and reproduce successfully pass on their genes to the next generation and establish a population best adapted to the local environment. Ecotypic variation is therefore described to have a genetic base, and are brought about by interactions between an individual&#x27;s genes and the environment. An example of ecotype formation that lead to reproductive isolation and ultimately speciation can be found in the small sea snail periwinkle, Littorina saxatilis. It is distributes across different habitats such as lagoons, salt marshes and rocky shores the range of distribution is from Portugal to Novaya Zemlaya and Svalbard and from North Carolina to Greenland. The polymorphic snail species have different heritable features such as size and shape depending on the habitat they occupy e.g. bare cliffs, boulders and barnacle belts. Phenotypic evolution in these snails can be strongly attributed to different ecological factors present in their habitats. For example, in coastal regions of Sweden, Spain and UK, &quot;Littorina saxatilis&quot; posses different shell shape in response to predation by crabs or waves surges. Predation by crabs, also called crab crushing, gives rise to snails with wary behavior having large and thick shells which can easily retract and avoid predation. Wave-surfs on the other hand, select for smaller sized snails with large apertures to increase grip and bold behavior. All this provide the basis for the emergence of different snail ecotypes. Snail ecotypes on the basis of morphology and behavior pass these characteristic on to their offspring.

==Examples==
* Tundra reindeer and woodland reindeer are two ecotypes of reindeer. The first migrate (travelling 5,000 km) annually between the two environments in large numbers whereas the other (who are much fewer) remain in the forest for the summer. In North America, the species &quot;Rangifer tarandus&quot; (locally known as caribou), was subdivided into five subspecies by Banfield in 1961. Caribou are classified by ecotype depending on several behavioural factors – predominant habitat use (northern, tundra, mountain, forest, boreal forest, forest-dwelling), spacing (dispersed or aggregated) and migration (sedentary or migratory). For example, the subspecies &quot;Rangifer tarandus caribou&quot; is further distinguished by a number of ecotypes, including boreal woodland caribou, mountain woodland caribou, and migratory woodland caribou (such as the migratory George River Caribou Herd in the Ungava region of Quebec).
* &quot;Arabis fecunda&quot;, a herb endemic to some calcareous soils of Montana, United States, can be divided into two ecotypes. The one &quot;low elevation&quot; group lives near the ground in an arid, warm environment and has thus developed a significantly greater tolerance against drought than the &quot;high elevation&quot; group. The two ecotypes are separated by a horizontal distance of about .
* It is commonly accepted that the Tucuxi dolphin has two ecotypes – the riverine ecotype found in some South American rivers and the pelagic ecotype found in the South Atlantic Ocean. In 2022, the common bottlenose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;), which had been considered to have two ecotypes in the western North Atlantic, was separated into two species by Costa et al. based on morphometric and genetic data, with the near-shore ecotype becoming &quot;Tursiops erebennus&quot; , described in the nineteenth century from a specimen collected in the Delaware River.
* The warbler finch and the Cocos Island finch are viewed as separate ecotypes. 
* The aromatic plant &quot;Artemisia campestris&quot; also known as the field sagewort grows in a wide range of habitats from North America to the Atlantic coast and also in Eurasia. It has different forms arccoding to the environment where it grows. One variety which grows on shifting dunes at Falstrebo on the coast of Sweden has broad leaves, and white hairs while exhibiting upright growth. Another variety that grows in Oland in calcareous rocks displays horizontally expanded branches with no upright growth. These two extreme types are considered different varieties. Other examples include &quot;Artemisia campestris var. borealis&quot; which occupies the west of the Cascades crest in the Olympic Mountains in Washington while &quot;Artemisia campestris var. wormskioldii&quot; grows on the east side. The Northern wormwood, &quot;var. borealis&quot; has spike like-inflorescences with leaves concentrated on the plant base and divided into long narrow lobes. Wormskiold&#x27;s northern wormwood, &quot;Artemisia campestris var. wormskioldii&quot; is generally shorter and hairy with large leaves surrounding the flowers.
* The Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;) has 20 different ecotypes in an area from Scotland to Siberia, all capable of interbreeding.
* Ecotype distinctions can be subtle and do not always require large distances; it has been observed that two populations of the same &quot;Helix&quot; snail species separated by only a few hundred kilometers prefer not to cross-mate, i.e., they reject one another as mates. This event probably occurs during the process of courtship, which may last for hours.

<text>The Hadamard transform (also known as the Walsh–Hadamard transform, Hadamard–Rademacher–Walsh transform, Walsh transform, or Walsh–Fourier transform) is an example of a generalized class of Fourier transforms. It performs an orthogonal, symmetric, involutive, linear operation on real numbers (or complex, or hypercomplex numbers, although the Hadamard matrices themselves are purely real).

The Hadamard transform can be regarded as being built out of size-2 discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs), and is in fact equivalent to a multidimensional DFT of size . It decomposes an arbitrary input vector into a superposition of Walsh functions.

The transform is named for the French mathematician Jacques Hadamard (), the German-American mathematician Hans Rademacher, and the American mathematician Joseph L. Walsh.

==Definition==

The Hadamard transform &quot;H&quot;&quot;m&quot; is a 2&quot;m&quot; × 2&quot;m&quot; matrix, the Hadamard matrix (scaled by a normalization factor), that transforms 2&quot;m&quot; real numbers &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; into 2&quot;m&quot; real numbers &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot;. The Hadamard transform can be defined in two ways: recursively, or by using the binary (base-2) representation of the indices &quot;n&quot; and &quot;k&quot;.

Recursively, we define the 1 × 1 Hadamard transform &quot;H&quot;0 by the identity &quot;H&quot;0 = 1, and then define &quot;H&quot;&quot;m&quot; for &quot;m&quot; &gt; 0 by:
formula_1
where the 1/ is a normalization that is sometimes omitted.

For &quot;m&quot; &gt; 1, we can also define &quot;H&quot;&quot;m&quot; by:
formula_2
where formula_3 represents the Kronecker product. Thus, other than this normalization factor, the Hadamard matrices are made up entirely of 1 and −1.

Equivalently, we can define the Hadamard matrix by its (&quot;k&quot;, &quot;n&quot;)-th entry by writing
formula_4

where the &quot;k&quot;&quot;j&quot; and &quot;n&quot;&quot;j&quot; are the bit elements (0 or 1) of &quot;k&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, respectively. Note that for the element in the top left corner, we define: formula_5. In this case, we have:
formula_6

This is exactly the multidimensional formula_7 DFT, normalized to be unitary, if the inputs and outputs are regarded as multidimensional arrays indexed by the &quot;n&quot;&quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot;&quot;j&quot;, respectively.

Some examples of the Hadamard matrices follow.
formula_8
where formula_9 is the bitwise dot product of the binary representations of the numbers i and j. For example, if formula_10, then formula_11, agreeing with the above (ignoring the overall constant). Note that the first row, first column element of the matrix is denoted by formula_12.

&quot;H&quot;1 is precisely the size-2 DFT. It can also be regarded as the Fourier transform on the two-element &quot;additive&quot; group of Z/(2).

The rows of the Hadamard matrices are the Walsh functions.

==Advantages of the Walsh–Hadamard transform==
=== Real ===
According to the above definition of matrix &quot;H&quot;, here we let &quot;H&quot; = &quot;H&quot;[&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;]
formula_13

In the Walsh transform, only 1 and −1 will appear in the matrix. The numbers 1 and −1 are real numbers so there is no need to perform a complex number calculation.

=== No multiplication is required ===
The DFT needs irrational multiplication, while the Hadamard transform does not. Even rational multiplication is not needed, since sign flips is all it takes.

=== Some properties are similar to those of the DFT ===
In the Walsh transform matrix, all entries in the first row (and column) are equal to 1.

sign change calculated 1st row 0

second row=1.

third row =2.



eighth row=7.formula_14

Discrete Fourier transform：
formula_15

In discrete Fourier transform, when m equal to zeros (mean first row), the result of DFT also is 1.
At the second row, although it is different from the first row we can observe a characteristic of the matrix that the signal in the first raw matrix is low frequency and it will increase the frequency at second row, increase more frequency until the last row.

If we calculate zero crossing:

 First row = 0 zero crossing
 Second row = 1 zero crossing
 Third row = 2 zero crossings
 Eight row = 7 zero crossings

==Relation to Fourier transform==

The Hadamard transform is in fact equivalent to a multidimensional DFT of size .

Another approach is to view the Hadamard transform as a Fourier transform on the Boolean group formula_16.
 Using the Fourier transform on finite (abelian) groups, the Fourier transform of a function formula_17 is the function formula_18 defined by
formula_19
where formula_20 is a character of formula_21. Each character has the form formula_22 for some formula_23, where the multiplication is the boolean dot product on bit strings, so we can identify the input to formula_24 with formula_23 (Pontryagin duality) and define formula_26 by
formula_27

This is the Hadamard transform of formula_28, considering the input to formula_28 and formula_24 as boolean strings.

In terms of the above formulation where the Hadamard transform multiplies a vector of formula_31 complex numbers formula_32 on the left by the Hadamard matrix formula_33 the equivalence is seen by taking formula_28 to take as input the bit string corresponding to the index of an element of formula_32, and having formula_28 output the corresponding element of formula_32.

Compare this to the usual discrete Fourier transform which when applied to a vector formula_32 of formula_31 complex numbers instead uses characters of the cyclic group formula_40.

==Computational complexity==
In the classical domain, the Hadamard transform can be computed in formula_41 operations (formula_42), using the fast Hadamard transform algorithm.

In the quantum domain, the Hadamard transform can be computed in formula_43 time, as it is a quantum logic gate that can be parallelized.

==Quantum computing applications==
The Hadamard transform is used extensively in quantum computing. The 2 × 2 Hadamard transform formula_44 is the quantum logic gate known as the Hadamard gate, and the application of a Hadamard gate to each qubit of an register in parallel is equivalent to the Hadamard transform 

===Hadamard gate===

In quantum computing, the Hadamard gate is a one-qubit rotation, mapping the qubit-basis states formula_45 and formula_46 to two superposition states with equal weight of the computational basis states formula_45 and formula_46. Usually the phases are chosen so that
&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;H=\frac

The much larger number of site patterns in column 0 reflects the fact that column 0 corresponds to transition differences, which accumulate more rapidly than transversion differences in virtually all comparisons of genomic regions (and definitely accumulate more rapidly in the hemoglobin pseudogenes used for this worked example). If we consider the site pattern AAGG it would to binary pattern 0000 for the second element of the Klein group bit pair and 0011 for the first element. in this case binary pattern based on the first element first element corresponds to index 3 (so row 3 in column 0; indicated with a single asterisk in the table). The site patterns GGAA, CCTT, and TTCC would be encoded in the exact same way. The site pattern AACT would be encoded with binary pattern 0011 based on the second element and 0001 based on the first element; this yields index 1 for the first element and index 3 for the second. The index based on the second Klein group bit pair is multiplied by 8 to yield the column index (in this case it would be column 24) The cell that would include the count of AACT site patterns is indicated with two asterisks; however, the absence of a number in the example indicates that the sequence alignment include no AACT site patterns (likewise, CCAG, GGTC, and TTGA site patterns, which would be encoded in the same way, are absent).

== Other applications ==
The Hadamard transform is also used in data encryption, as well as many signal processing and data compression algorithms, such as JPEG XR and MPEG-4 AVC. In video compression applications, it is usually used in the form of the sum of absolute transformed differences. It is also a crucial part of significant number of algorithms in quantum computing. The Hadamard transform is also applied in experimental techniques such as NMR, mass spectrometry and crystallography. It is additionally used in some versions of locality-sensitive hashing, to obtain pseudo-random matrix rotations.

<text>Karl Heinrich Emil Koch (6 June 1809 – 25 May 1879) was a German botanist. He is best known for his botanical explorations in the Caucasus region, including northeast Turkey. Most of his collections have today been lost. He is also known as the first professional horticultural officer in Germany.

==Biography==
He was born in Ettersburg near Weimar, Germany. He studied at the universities of Jena and Würzburg and taught, as privatdocent, at the University of Jena beginning 1834. He became an associate professor in 1836. He undertook a journey of research into southern Russia in 1836–38, and a second in 1843–44. The fruit of this second trip, in which he also visited Asia Minor, Great Armenia, the Caspian Sea, and the Caucasus Mountains, was his &quot;&quot;Wanderungen im Oriente, während der Jahre 1843 und 1844&quot; (1846).

After his second journey, he settled at the University of Berlin in 1847, where he was later appointed assistant professor. He was at the Berlin botanical gardens beginning in 1849. He became general secretary of the Berlin Horticultural Society (Verein zur Beförderung des Gartenbau, a Prussian state institution), in which capacity he published &quot;Wochenschrift für Gartnerei und Pflanzenkunde&quot; (1858–72). In 1859, he was appointed professor of the Agricultural High School in Berlin. He died in Berlin.

== Writings ==
Besides the travel book already mentioned, Koch wrote &quot;Reise durch Russland nach dem kaukasischen Isthmus&quot; (Trip through Russia and the Caucasian isthmus, Stuttgart, 1842–43), &quot;Fährtenabdrücke im bunten Sandstein&quot; (with Ernst Erhard Schmid, 1841), &quot;Hortus dendrologicus&quot; (Berlin, 1853–54), &quot;Dendrologie&quot;&quot; (Erlangen, 1869–72), and other works.

<text>Linköping Hockey Club, often known by its initials LHC, or colloquially among its fans as Cluben, is a Swedish professional ice hockey club from Linköping, founded in 1976. The home arena of the team is Saab Arena (formerly Cloetta Center) which accommodates 8,190 spectators.

Competing in the Swedish Hockey League (SHL; formerly Elitserien), the club is placed twelfth in the marathon standings for the top Swedish ice hockey league.

==History==

===1942–1975: The club&#x27;s roots===
In 1942, a group of football players of BK Kenty founded the ice hockey club BK Robbi, who mostly played friendlies against other local clubs on Stångån during the winter. The board of Kenty had first been hesitant to establish a hockey department, but in 1945, the two clubs merged following lengthy discussions. Being heavily dependent on weather conditions, Kenty only played 30 games in five seasons during the second half of the 1940s. By the end of the 1950s, Kenty had established itself in Division 2, the domestic second tier. Meanwhile, the club was also granted a permanent home ground at Folkungavallen, close to the city centre. In 1969, Kenty merged with another local club, IK Terra. In the 1970s, Kenty suffered from internal differences, since part of the club&#x27;s board wanted to financially prioritize football in favor of ice hockey.

===1976–1998: Foundation of LHC and rise to Elitserien===
Linköping HC was founded on 4 August 1976, as a spin-off from BK Kenty, and moved in to the newly-built indoor arena Stångebro Ishall. 

===1999–: Establishment in the top division===
Linköping HC first played in the Swedish Hockey League (SHL; formerly Elitserien) in the 1999–2000 season, and has been in the top division since the 2001–02 season. They have reached the playoffs eight times. LHC reached the final for the first time in 2006–07, where they lost to Modo Hockey. In the 2007–08 season, Linköping HC advanced to the final again, this time against HV71; they lost and won the silver medal.

<text>Marcos Scutaro, better known as Marco Scutaro, (; born October 30, 1975) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball infielder. He bats and throws right-handed. Scutaro made his major league debut with the New York Mets in 2002, and subsequently played for the Oakland Athletics, Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox, Colorado Rockies and San Francisco Giants. Scutaro was named the most valuable player of the 2012 National League Championship Series while with the Giants; he and the team then won the 2012 World Series over the Detroit Tigers.

Scutaro was one of the primary subjects of the 2005 documentary &quot;A Player to be Named Later&quot;.

==Early life==
Marcos Scutaro was born on October 30, 1975, in San Felipe, Venezuela. He is of Italian descent. He began playing baseball at age six.

==Professional career==

===Minor leagues===
Scutaro originally signed with the Cleveland Indians as an amateur free agent on July 26, 1994. As a teenager, Scutaro considered Cleveland infielder and fellow Venezuelan Omar Vizquel his favorite player and would often watch Vizquel at spring training.

Scutaro was traded by the Indians to the Milwaukee Brewers on August 30, 2000, as the player to be named later in a trade that had sent Kane Davis, Paul Rigdon and Richie Sexson to the Brewers for Jason Bere, Bob Wickman and Steve Woodard on July 28. Scutaro was in the 2005 documentary film &quot;A Player To Be Named Later&quot;, which followed players from Indianapolis Indians, the Triple-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers, for one season. He was waived at the start of the 2002 season by the Brewers, who needed to make room for Nelson Figueroa on its roster.

Scutaro was claimed off waivers by the New York Mets on April 5, 2002. He batted .319 with 22 doubles, seven home runs, 28 runs batted in and 48 runs scored in 97 games with the Triple-A Norfolk Tides in 2002. He was also selected to the International League squad for the Triple-A All-Star Game that summer.

===New York Mets (2002–2003)===

Scutaro&#x27;s first promotion to the majors came on July 19 when the Mets recalled him from the Tides to replace the injured Joe McEwing. Scutaro introduced himself to Mets manager Bobby Valentine that afternoon while the latter was eating lunch at the hotel in Cincinnati where the team was staying. Valentine reciprocated the greeting without knowing who Scutaro was. After completing his meal, Valentine inquired about why Scutaro was lingering. &quot;I just got called up&quot;, Scutaro responded.

===Oakland Athletics (2004–2007)===
Scutaro was again selected off waivers, this time by the Oakland Athletics, on October 9, 2003.

Scutaro landed a starting second baseman position after Mark Ellis had a season-ending shoulder injury during 2004 spring training.

In 2004, Scutaro reached career highs in batting average (.273), runs batted in (43), runs (50), hits (124), doubles (32), at bats (455) and games played (137). He played multiple positions during his four seasons in Oakland, including second base, shortstop, third base, left field and right field.

===Toronto Blue Jays (2008–2009)===

On November 18, 2007, Scutaro was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for minor league pitchers Kristian Bell and Graham Godfrey.

Scutaro was the Jays&#x27; third baseman for at least a month, after teammate Scott Rolen injured a finger, and then Scutaro returned to a starter&#x27;s role after teammate David Eckstein injured his right hip flexor on May 6. Shortly after Eckstein&#x27;s return, Eckstein and Blue Jays teammate Aaron Hill collided trying to catch a fly ball. Hill suffered from concussion-like symptoms, and Scutaro filled in at second base.

Scutaro was the starting shortstop for the Blue Jays in 2009, and had his best season to date, achieving career highs in almost every offensive category: 12 home runs, 60 runs batted in, 35 doubles, 235 total bases, 162 hits, 100 runs, 14 stolen bases, and 90 walks in 574 at-bats, all while playing slick defense all year.

===Boston Red Sox (2010–2011)===

On December 3, 2009, Scutaro agreed to a two-year, $11 million deal with the Boston Red Sox. The deal also included a third-year mutual option. On April 12, 2010, Scutaro recorded the first hit in Target Field history on a single up the middle in the first inning off Minnesota Twins starter Carl Pavano. Soon after, Scutaro was caught stealing second base, making him the first out recorded at the Twins&#x27; new ballpark.

In his first season with the team, Scutaro set a number of career highs, including games (150), at-bats (632), hits (174) and doubles (38) while suffering for much of the season with a right shoulder injury which forced him out of practice.

===Colorado Rockies (2012)===

On October 30, 2011, the Red Sox and Scutaro agreed to exercise their mutual contract option. Then, on January 21, 2012, Scutaro was traded to the Colorado Rockies for pitcher Clayton Mortensen.

===San Francisco Giants (2012–2014)===
On July 27, 2012, Scutaro was traded, along with cash considerations, to the San Francisco Giants for infielder Charlie Culberson. In a game against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium on August 8, 2012, Scutaro drove in a career high seven runs, including a grand slam. He hit .306 for the regular season, including .362 as a Giant, helping the Giants win the National League West title. He was awarded the NLCS MVP after tying the NLCS record with 14 hits and also batting .500 (14-for-28) with six runs scored and four runs batted in during the seven game series against the Cardinals. On October 28, in the tenth inning of Game 4 of the 2012 World Series, Scutaro drove in Ryan Theriot for the winning run, as the Giants swept the Detroit Tigers.

After the 2012 season, Scutaro and the Giants agreed to a three-year, $20 million contract, which became official on December 7, 2012. In 2013, Scutaro was the starting second baseman, with Tony Abreu and Nick Noonan as his main backups. In 81 games in the first half, Scutaro hit .316/.367/.400 with two home runs, 22 runs batted in and 37 runs, and he was named to the 2013 All-Star Game. Scutaro played his last game of 2013 on September 15, and was officially shut down on September 24. He underwent surgery on September 27 that inserted a pin in his left pinkie correcting his mallet finger, an injury he suffered on June 11 against the Pirates when he was hit by Tony Watson. In 127 games in 2013, he hit .297/.357/.369 with two home runs, 31 runs batted in and 57 runs.

Scutaro started the 2014 season on the disabled list with back problems. He played in five games in July before his back issues forced him to return to the disabled list for the remainder of the season. On December 19, 2014, Scutaro underwent back surgery that some reports indicated could end his career. The Giants designated him for assignment on January 21, 2015, and he was removed from the 40-man roster. On January 28, 2015, Scutaro was released by the Giants. The Giants re-signed Scutaro to a major league contract on June 17 and placed him on the 60-day disabled list. He continued to rehabilitate his injury with the Giants, not with the intention of playing, but &quot;in hopes of maintaining a quality of life and be pain-free with his family,&quot; according to the Giants.

==World Baseball Classic==
Because of his Italian heritage, Scutaro was given the option of playing for either Italy or Venezuela in the 2006 World Baseball Classic. He chose to play for Venezuela as a utility infielder. He again represented Venezuela in the 2009 World Baseball Classic and 2013 World Baseball Classic. Venezuela won the bronze medal in 2009, but in 2013 earned an early exit after a loss to Puerto Rico 6–3. However, Venezuela won against newcomers Spain to earn a direct qualification for the 2017 World Baseball Classic.

<text>Blaenavon () is a town and community in Torfaen county borough, Wales, high on a hillside on the source of the Afon Lwyd. It is within the boundaries of the historic county of Monmouthshire and the preserved county of Gwent. The population is 6,055.

Parts of the town and surrounding country form the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape, selected as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000.

== History ==



&quot;Blaenavon&quot; literally means &quot;head of the river&quot; or loosely &quot;river&#x27;s source&quot; in the Welsh language. Blaenavon grew around an ironworks opened in 1788 by the West Midlands industrialist Thomas Hill and his partners, Thomas Hopkins and Benjamin Pratt. The businessmen invested £40,000 into the ironworks project and erected three blast furnaces. Hopkins, as a result of operating the Cannock Wood Forge, Staffordshire, was in contact with skilled and experienced ironworkers, and managed to persuade many of them to migrate to Blaenavon to help establish the new ironworks. In 1836 Robert William Kennard formed the Blaenavon Coal and Iron Company, which subsequently bought the Blaenavon Ironworks.

Blaenavon House, a mansion constructed in 1798 by Thomas Hopkins, was repurposed as a hospital in 1924, supported by the subscriptions of local iron and coal workers. In the 1940s the hospital site was given by the then owners of the site, the National Coal Board, to the UK Ministry of Health; it was run as a cottage hospital until 1985. When the hospital closed the building was sold by the local authority and refurbished as a nursing home for the elderly. In 1995 the building was listed as a Grade 2 listed building. Following the closure of the nursing home in 2007, the building was left empty. It was badly vandalised and stripped of its lead work, slate roof and original interiors, and was placed on the Buildings At Risk register. In 2016 a fire caused severe damage to the ballroom wing and adjoining extension. The House was sold in 2017 to private owners and is currently undergoing restoration as a family home once again.

The Municipal Offices in Lion Street were the home of Blaenavon Urban District Council until local government reorganisation in 1974.

== Governance ==
Blaenavon is a community represented by Blaenavon Town Council and is an electoral ward of Torfaen County Borough Council. Blaenavon is twinned with Coutras in France.

== Geography ==
The town lies near the source of the Afon Lwyd river, north of Cwmbran.

== Demography ==
The population of Blaenavon has declined gradually at each ten-year census since the closure of the ironworks in 1900. It had fallen to 8,451 by 1961 and fell more rapidly after closure of the coal mine in 1980. Part of this decline was not emigration but a decrease in birth rate.

== Economy ==

The Blaenavon Coal and Iron Company developed the Big Pit coalworks with adjoining steel works particularly for rail manufacture. The steel-making and coal mining industries followed, boosting the town&#x27;s population to over 20,000 at one time before 1890. Since 1988, part of this site has been the Big Pit National Coal Museum.

== Culture and community ==
Government, publishers and mainly Welsh writers sought in 2003 to attract more visitors by introducing Blaenavon as Wales&#x27; second &quot;book town&quot; (the first being Hay-on-Wye on the English border). However, the project did not succeed. This can be attributed to a combination of the town&#x27;s remote location and the established competition from Hay. Many thriving community groups serve and improve the town, including Future Blaenavon, which has helped to create a community garden at the bottom of the town.

== Landmarks ==
Parts of the town and surrounding country form the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape, selected as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000. Attractions in the town include the Big Pit National Coal Museum (an Anchor Point of the European Route of Industrial Heritage), Blaenavon Ironworks, the Pontypool and Blaenavon Railway and Blaenavon World Heritage Centre. The town has a male voice choir, a town band, and many historical walks through the local mountains.

== Transport ==
A railway viaduct was constructed in 1790; the structure disappeared and was unearthed in a 2001 episode of the archaeology television programme &quot;Time Team&quot;. The Pontypool and Blaenavon Railway is a scenic attraction rich in geological and historical interest. Blaenavon lost both of its passenger railway stations — Blaenavon High Level station closed in 1941, and the last train from Blaenavon (Low Level) (to Newport via Pontypool Crane Street) ran in April 1962. The lower line had already been closed for more than a year before the Beeching Axe took place. The lower line&#x27;s passenger service was among many in Gwent (Monmouthshire) which Ministry of Transport de-classified papers reveal were axed because of rail congestion in the Newport area following the newly opened Llanwern steelworks.

== Education ==

* Blaenavon Heritage VC Primary School &amp; Nursery
*Busy Bees Nursery
Following Samuel Hopkins&#x27; death in 1815, his sister Sarah Hopkins of Rugeley, who had inherited much money from her late brother, erected Blaenavon Endowed School in his memory. Which has since been permanently closed. 

== Religious sites ==
St Peter&#x27;s Church was constructed in 1804, gifted to the parish by Thomas Hill and Samuel Hopkins.

== Sport ==

* Forgeside RFC
* Forgeside AFC
* Blaenavon RFC 
* Blaenavon Blues AFC
* Blaenavon Bowls Club

Blaenavon Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1906. The club closed in 1937.

== Notable people ==
Notable people born in Blaenavon include the Broadway and film actor E. E. Clive, award-winning mystery writer Dorothy Simpson, and international rugby union players Mark Taylor, Ken Jones (also an Olympic athlete), John Perkins, Chris Huish, Terry Cobner and Colin Evans (rugby)

Nick Thomas-Symonds, elected MP for Torfaen in 2015, was brought up in the town.

<text>In mathematics, the Bohr compactification of a topological group &quot;G&quot; is a compact Hausdorff topological group &quot;H&quot; that may be canonically associated to &quot;G&quot;. Its importance lies in the reduction of the theory of uniformly almost periodic functions on &quot;G&quot; to the theory of continuous functions on &quot;H&quot;. The concept is named after Harald Bohr who pioneered the study of almost periodic functions, on the real line.

Given a topological group &quot;G&quot;, the Bohr compactification of &quot;G&quot; is a compact &quot;Hausdorff&quot; topological group Bohr(&quot;G&quot;) and a continuous homomorphism

:b: &quot;G&quot; → Bohr(&quot;G&quot;)

which is universal with respect to homomorphisms into compact Hausdorff groups; this means that if &quot;K&quot; is another compact Hausdorff topological group and

:&quot;f&quot;: &quot;G&quot; → &quot;K&quot;

is a continuous homomorphism, then there is a unique continuous homomorphism

:Bohr(&quot;f&quot;): Bohr(&quot;G&quot;) → &quot;K&quot;

such that &quot;f&quot; = Bohr(&quot;f&quot;) ∘ b.

Theorem. The Bohr compactification exists and is unique up to isomorphism.

We will denote the Bohr compactification of &quot;G&quot; by Bohr(&quot;G&quot;) and the canonical map by

:formula_1

The correspondence &quot;G&quot; ↦ Bohr(&quot;G&quot;) defines a covariant functor on the category of topological groups and continuous homomorphisms.

The Bohr compactification is intimately connected to the finite-dimensional unitary representation theory of a topological group. The kernel of b consists exactly of those elements of &quot;G&quot; which cannot be separated from the identity of &quot;G&quot; by finite-dimensional &quot;unitary&quot; representations.

The Bohr compactification also reduces many problems in the theory of almost periodic functions on topological groups to that of functions on compact groups.

A bounded continuous complex-valued function &quot;f&quot; on a topological group &quot;G&quot; is uniformly almost periodic if and only if the set of right translates &quot;g&quot;&quot;f&quot; where

:formula_2

is relatively compact in the uniform topology as &quot;g&quot; varies through &quot;G&quot;.

Theorem. A bounded continuous complex-valued function &quot;f&quot; on &quot;G&quot; is uniformly almost periodic if and only if there is a continuous function &quot;f&quot;1 on Bohr(&quot;G&quot;) (which is uniquely determined) such that

:formula_3

==Maximally almost periodic groups==
Topological groups for which the Bohr compactification mapping is injective are called &quot;maximally almost periodic&quot; (or MAP groups). For example all Abelian groups, all compact groups, and all free groups are MAP. In the case &quot;G&quot; is a locally compact connected group, MAP groups are completely characterized: They are precisely products of compact groups with vector groups
of finite dimension.

<doc id="634785" wikidata="Q1040795" url="?curid=634785" title="Dissipation factor">
<text>In physics, the dissipation factor (DF) is a measure of loss-rate of energy of a mode of oscillation (mechanical, electrical, or electromechanical) in a dissipative system. It is the reciprocal of quality factor, which represents the &quot;quality&quot; or durability of oscillation.

==Explanation==
Electrical potential energy is dissipated in all dielectric materials, usually in the form of heat. In a capacitor made of a dielectric placed between conductors, the typical lumped element model includes a lossless ideal capacitor in series with a resistor termed the equivalent series resistance (ESR) as shown below. The ESR represents losses in the capacitor. In a good capacitor the ESR is very small, and in a poor capacitor the ESR is large. However, ESR is sometimes a minimum value to be required. Note that the ESR is &quot;not&quot; simply the resistance that would be measured across a capacitor by an ohmmeter. The ESR is a derived quantity with physical origins in both the dielectric&#x27;s conduction electrons and dipole relaxation phenomena. In dielectric only one of either the conduction electrons or the dipole relaxation typically dominates loss. For the case of the conduction electrons being the dominant loss, then

: formula_1

where

* formula_2 is the dielectric&#x27;s bulk conductivity,
* formula_3 is the lossless permittivity of the dielectric, and
* formula_4 is the angular frequency of the AC current &quot;i&quot;,
* formula_5 is the lossless capacitance.

If the capacitor is used in an AC circuit, the dissipation factor due to the non-ideal capacitor is expressed as the ratio of the resistive power loss in the ESR to the reactive power oscillating in the capacitor, or

: formula_6

When representing the electrical circuit parameters as vectors in a complex plane, known as phasors, a capacitor&#x27;s dissipation factor is equal to the tangent of the angle between the capacitor&#x27;s impedance vector and the negative reactive axis, as shown in the adjacent diagram. This gives rise to the parameter known as the loss tangent tan &quot;δ&quot; where

: formula_7

Alternatively, formula_8 can be derived from frequency at which loss tangent was determined and capacitance

: formula_9

Since the formula_10 in a good capacitor is usually small, formula_11, and formula_10 is often expressed as a percentage. 

formula_10 approximates to the power factor when formula_8 is far less than formula_15, which is usually the case.

formula_10 will vary depending on the dielectric material and the frequency of the electrical signals. In low dielectric constant (low-κ), temperature compensating ceramics, formula_10 of 0.1–0.2% is typical. In high dielectric constant ceramics, formula_10 can be 1–2%. However, lower formula_10 is usually an indication of quality capacitors when comparing similar dielectric material.

<text>John Howe (17 May 1630 – 2 April 1705) was an English Puritan theologian. He served briefly as chaplain to Oliver Cromwell.

==Life==
Howe was born at Loughborough. At the age of five he went to Ireland with his father, who had been ejected from his living by William Laud, but returned to England in 1641 and settled with his father in Lancaster. He studied at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and at Magdalen College, Oxford (B.A., 1650; M.A., 1652), where for a time he was fellow and college chaplain. At Cambridge he came under the influence of Ralph Cudworth and Henry More, from whom he probably received the Platonic tinge that marks his writings. About 1654 he was appointed to the perpetual curacy of Great Torrington, Devon. In this place, according to his own statement, he was engaged in the pulpit on fast days from nine to four, with a recess of fifteen minutes, during which the people sang. While on a visit to London in 1656 Oliver Cromwell prevailed upon him to preach at Whitehall, with the result that Howe, much against his preferences, became one of Cromwell&#x27;s chaplains. Upon Richard Cromwell&#x27;s retirement he returned to his former parish at Torrington. When the Act of Uniformity 1662 was passed he quit his church, but remained for some time in the neighbourhood, preaching in private houses. In this period he was cited before the Bishop of Exeter, his old friend Seth Ward, who vainly urged Howe to be reordained.

In 1666 Howe accepted the Five Mile Act, but with the limiting clause, &quot;so far as the laws of man are agreeable to the Word of God.&quot; In 1671 he became chaplain to Lord Massereene, of Antrim Castle, Ireland. Here he was a member of the Antrim Meeting, the precursor of the Presbyterian organization in Ireland. In 1676 he returned to London as the successor of Lazarus Seaman at Haberdashers&#x27; Hall. In 1685, on account of the greater severity shown to the dissenters, he accepted an invitation to accompany Lord Wharton to the Continent, and the year following settled at Utrecht. When James II issued his declaration for liberty of conscience in 1687 Howe returned to his old position in London. From this time till his death he took an active interest in current discussions on predestination, the Trinity, and conformity. In 1688 he headed a deputation of dissenting ministers in an address of welcome to William of Orange. He died in London.

<doc id="634792" wikidata="Q1341055" url="?curid=634792" title="Endurance (crater)">
<text>Endurance is an impact crater lying situated within the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle (MC-19) region of the planet Mars. This crater was visited by the &quot;Opportunity&quot; rover from May until December 2004. Mission scientists named the crater after the ship &quot;Endurance&quot; that sailed to the Antarctic through the Weddell Sea during the ill-fated 1914–1917 Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, considered to be the last expedition of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration organized by Ernest Shackleton.

The rover entered the crater interior on its 134th mission sol (June 15), and exited on the 315th sol (December 14). During this time it traversed various obstacles, steep inclines, and overcame large wheel slippage when driving over fine sand.

==Exploration by &quot;Opportunity&quot;==

After arriving at the crater, &quot;Opportunity&quot; performed a survey of the crater to plan the further steps in exploring the local geology. A site dubbed &quot;Karatepe&quot; was chosen to enter the crater and investigate the layering of the bedrock.

The picture to the right shows changes in the color of the bedrock layers. The layer &quot;A&quot; is closer to the rover and higher than the layers &quot;B&quot; to &quot;E&quot;. Texture and rock chemistry also differed with depth. Thus scientists infer that the age of these layers is following a similar pattern, with the higher layers being younger than the lower layers.

&quot;Opportunity&quot; then went farther down into the crater to investigate the sand dunes. Various rock outcrops were investigated while the rover descended. It was decided not to drive into the dunes, for fear the rover might get stuck permanently. Instead, &quot;Opportunity&quot; did some work on some rocks surrounding the dunes before heading back up to the rim of the crater. On the way, it encountered a boulder, nicknamed &#x27;Wopmay&#x27;, that provided inconclusive evidence that rocks near the bottom of the crater were affected by water before and after the crater formed.
The rover then headed off to Burns Cliff. 
Burns Cliff, named for the late mineralogist Roger Burns of MIT, was studied closely by &quot;Opportunity&quot;. High amounts of slippage prevented the rover from using its robotic arm, however high resolution imaging was conducted with the Pancam. It shows layers of sediment that might indicate deposition by a liquid. The layers in the cliff would later be followed south of the crater to identify it as a geologic formation, in this case the &quot;Burns Formation&quot;. These names are not official until made so by the International Astronomical Union.

Burns Cliff was the final science stop inside Endurance. The rover had some trouble making it out, noticing slippage, but prevailed. Leaving Endurance it headed for its heat shield where it would find the Meridiani Planum meteorite, which happened to be the first meteorite discovered on another planet.

==Wet history==
&quot;Opportunity&quot; spent about half a year exploring Endurance. During that time, data collected by the rover supplanted and greatly expanded on the history of water at Meridiani Planum, in addition to the confirmation that there had been liquid water here in ancient times. Endurance provided mission scientists with a cross-section of the bedrock on this part of Mars, showing that liquid water hadn&#x27;t flowed across the surface just once, but was of an episodic nature, and wasn&#x27;t permanently present, with floods periodically washing over the landscape, and then drying up again. Interpretation of the materials (such as sulfates) in Endurance&#x27;s evaporite outcrops led mission scientists to believe that this shallow sea was probably rather acidic in nature, but couldn&#x27;t rule out that life may have been present at some point.

Fenton came up with the band&#x27;s name and provided a large part of its musical direction; Phill Brown, the recording engineer on the band&#x27;s first album, quotes him as saying, &quot;I want a no-bullshit, working class band—I&#x27;ve had enough of all this pseudo peace crap.&quot; Due to this attitude, the band&#x27;s raucous sound and its revolutionary lyrics, they have been described as &quot;England&#x27;s first punk band&quot; (after Crushed Butler)

In 1970 the band recorded their first album, &quot;Third World War&quot;, which was released in 1971 on Fly Records. Largely, the themes of the album espoused far-left political sentiment. It featured Stamp on rhythm guitar and vocals, Avery on bass, Mick Lieber on lead guitars and Fred Smith (drums). Tony Ashton also added piano on some of the tracks, and Jim Price (trumpet and trombone) and Bobby Keyes (saxophone), American musicians who were playing with the Rolling Stones, provided some horn parts.

At the time the album was released, the band had yet to play live. In the summer of 1971 Avery, Fenton and Stamp reconfigured the group to get &quot;the &#x27;best&#x27; live grouping,&quot; which was Stamp, Avery, John Hawken on piano, John Knightsbridge on lead guitar, and Paul Olsen on drums. They toured Finland, playing 35 gigs in 30 days, and then went on to perform at a number of festivals across Europe. 1971 also saw the release of the band&#x27;s two singles, &quot;Ascension Day&quot;/&quot;Teddy Teeth Goes Sailing&quot; and &quot;A Little Bit Of Urban Rock&quot;/&quot;Working Class Man&quot;, both of which appeared on Fly Records.

By the time Third World War went into the studio in 1972 to record their second album the management at Fly Records were becoming unhappy with the band&#x27;s lack of commercial potential. Hoping to guide the group towards more mainstream acceptability, the label demanded the song &quot;Coshing Old Lady Blues&quot; be removed from the album. Fenton refused to release the album without that track, so &quot;Third World War II&quot; came out instead on The Who&#x27;s Track Records label. Personnel on the record was the touring group from the previous summer, except that Craig Collinge replaced Olsen on drums. During the recording of the album, Fenton ran out of money and could no longer pay the musicians, and once the record was finished the band broke up.

<text>Maerdy (, ) is a village and community (and electoral ward) in the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf, and within the historic county boundaries of Glamorgan, Wales, lying at the head of the Rhondda Fach Valley.

== History ==
&quot;Maerdy&quot; is a Welsh word meaning &quot;house of the slaves, and may indicate a medieval origin. The &quot;maer&quot; (steward) was usually appointed by the king; the &quot;maer biswail&quot; (literally the &quot;dung steward&quot;) was not as important and wielded less authority than the &quot;maer&quot; (&quot;Hen Gyfreithiau Cymreig&quot;, S. J. Williams). &quot;Maerdy&quot; was also used for a &#x27;summer dwelling&#x27; as well as for a &#x27;dairy farm&#x27; (GPC). The name is found in several locations throughout Wales. &#x27;Mardy&#x27; represents the local Gwentian dialect form of the written &quot;maerdy&quot;. 

The area grew from a farming community to town around the coal mining industry and the development of Mardy Colliery in the late 19th century, but its last pit (Mardy Main) shut in 1990. Maerdy was not originally an area of industrial confrontation, with the Cambrian mines of Pentre showing far more socialist ideals. This view would change by the mid to late 20th century when Maerdy became synonymous with working class syndicalism and solidarity. In the mid-twentieth century Maerdy was associated with the Communist Party of Great Britain and radical miners&#x27; leaders such as Arthur Horner and was known as &quot;Little Moscow&quot;. By the time of the Miners&#x27; strike in the 1980s, Maerdy was the location of one of the last working mines in the south Wales valleys, and the pictures of the returning miners once the strike was resolved was one of the defining moments of late 20th century Welsh history.

Maerdy has a number of memorials erected to remember events of significance and notable people. Near the Avon factory, a bridge has been constructed to remember Frank Owen of Pentre Road, who died fighting in the Spanish Civil War.

There is also a memorial in place to remember victims of the colliery disaster, placed in Maerdy Park, and is a coal Dram filled with coal from Maerdy Colliery. Also located in Maerdy park is a memorial dedicated to the memory of fallen World War I and World War II Soldiers.

A newer, updated War memorial has been erected adjacent to the Colliery memorial with the names of all the soldiers who died in both World War I and World War II.

In 2017, a memorial, known locally as the ‘Maerdy Gateway’ was created at the foot of the mountain road leading to neighbouring Aberdare. It consists of a pitwheel and a statue of a miner holding a child, wrapped in a traditional Welsh shawl, in memoriam and recognition of the area&#x27;s booming coal industry.

==Governance==
The Maerdy electoral ward is coterminous with the community and elects one county councillor to Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council. Since 1995 representation has flipped between the Labour Party and Plaid Cymru.

However, a 2018 review of electoral arrangements by the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales would see Maerdy ward merged with neighbouring Ferndale. The proposals would take effect from the 2022 council elections.

==Transport==
Between 1849 and 1856, the Taff Vale Railway opened the Maerdy Branch from , including a station at . Passenger services were withdrawn in 1964, and the line closed completely in August 1986 after coal from Mardy Colliery was raised through Tower Colliery.

In 2005, RCT council constructed the A4223 Porth and Lower Rhondda Fach Relief Road (Porth Bypass) follows the old railway line through Ynyshir, past Wattstown and on to Pontygwaith. The northern section forms a branch to the Taff Trail cycleway.

==Community Archives Wales==
A group of interested residents takes part in the Maerdy Archive Group which is affiliated with the Community Archives Wales scheme to teach local residents how to upload articles of their community&#x27;s history. The group has a large collection of photographs and ephemera about the development and expansion of the Maerdy area.
In 2002 the village was designated as a Communities First Area and a Partnership formed.

<doc id="634800" wikidata="Q846337" url="?curid=634800" title="Pink fairy armadillo">
<text>The pink fairy armadillo (Chlamyphorus truncatus) is the smallest species of armadillo, first described by Richard Harlan in 1825. The pink fairy armadillo is long, and typically weighs about . This solitary, desert-adapted animal is endemic to the deserts and scrub lands of central Argentina. The pink fairy armadillo is closely related to the only other fairy armadillo, the greater fairy armadillo.

Pink fairy armadillos have small eyes, silky yellowish white fur, and flexible dorsal shells that are attached to their bodies solely by thin dorsal membranes. Their spatula-shaped tails protrude from vertical plates at the blunt rear of their shells. They exhibit nocturnal and solitary habits and feed themselves largely on insects, worms, snails, and various plant parts. The pink fairy armadillo has a unique ability to bury itself in a matter of seconds, using its specialized claws to dig into sandy or loamy soils. This behavior helps protect the armadillo from predators and extreme temperatures, as well as conserve moisture in its arid habitat.

The conservation status of pink fairy armadillos is uncertain, and it is listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The decline in population for this species has generally been attributed to farming activities and predators including domestic dogs and cats. Pink fairy armadillos are found less commonly than they were a few decades ago, and the field sightings have been rare and incidental.

Individuals caught in the wild had a tendency to die during or a couple days after transport from their natural habitat to captive facilities. There is a sole record for the longevity of a pink fairy armadillo that was held in captivity more than four years; however, that particular case lacks scientific description.
Armadillos&#x27; evolutionary distinctiveness, combined with their restricted geographic range, ongoing threats, and rarity, make conservation extremely urgent for these species.

==Evolutionary origins==

At present, fairy armadillos have the least molecular data available among all families of armadillos. The subfamily Chlamyphorinae includes only two non-extinct species: &quot;Chlamyphorus truncatus&quot;, the pink fairy armadillo, and &quot;Calyptophractus retusus&quot;, the greater fairy armadillo. These two species are morphologically similar: both have notably reduced eyes and reinforced forearms that support enlarged digging claws. They are also one of the few mammals that lack visible external ears. Both species are specialized to a subterranean lifestyle which was developed in their ancestral lineage sometime between 32 and 17 Mya.

Both species have geographically separated distributions, and both are strictly nocturnal, but the details of their ecology and their population biology remain unknown. The similarities can be explained either by the presence of a shared common ancestry, which would place both species in the same clade (making them monophyletic), or by the result of adaptive convergence due to extreme selective pressures induced by their lifestyle (suggesting them to be diphyletic). A study in 2012 of several of their genes concluded that they were monophyletic, estimating the split between the two species to have occurred around 17 ± 3 Mya, around the transition between the Early Miocene and the Middle Miocene.

Both species are rare in the field and are fairly elusive, so the phylogenetic affinities of fairy armadillos have been tested only once. Research conducted in 2009 supported the idea that the three previously identified subfamilies Dasypodinae, Euphractinae, and Tolypeutinae of armadillos, which separated shortly after the Eocene-Oligocene transition, were monophyletic. Chlamyphorinae, the subfamily including the pink fairy armadillo, was found to show phylogenetic affinities with the clade Tolypeutinae. This was a significant step in defining the previously completely unknown phylogenetic position of this armadillo subfamily within Cingulata. Later, the separation of the fairy armadillo subfamily from their sister-group of Tolypeutinae was estimated to have occurred 32 ± 3 Mya.

Fairy armadillos have previously been classified within the subfamily Euphractinae. However, current opinion is that the antiquity and uniqueness of pink fairy armadillos is best accounted for by retaining the subfamily Chlamyphorinae.

==Range and habitat==
Pink fairy armadillos are nocturnal burrowing mammals endemic to the xeric environment in central Argentina. They have been found south of Mendoza province as well as north of Rio Negro and south of Buenos Aires. This narrow range contains a unique and crucial habitat for the pink fairy armadillo. It lives in scrubby grasslands that display a variety of thin &quot;Larrea&quot; and &quot;Portulaca&quot; shrubs during spring and summer periods. It also resides in sandy plains and dunes.

The pink fairy armadillo is classified as a subterranean armadillo that is extremely sensitive to environmental changes and stress. As an example, sudden environmental changes that could affect pink fairy armadillos include temperature and soil quality. In order for them to survive and maintain stability, they must occupy undisturbed places that contain sufficient amounts of compact sand and hiding places. This also refers to possible captivity conditions for this animal due to its desert-adapted characteristics.

==Dietary habits==
The pink fairy armadillo is classified as a fossorial, generalist, insectivore. Ants and larvae are its main food source while underground. While those are its primary sources of food, the armadillos are known to also eat worms, snails, and various insects. If these insects and invertebrates cannot be found, plant leaves and roots make a good secondary dietary option for their underground lifestyle. In captivity, this animal was observed to willingly accept such foods as watermelon, avocado shells with avocado flesh, and Mazuri Insectivore Diet.

==Description==
The pink fairy armadillo is long, and typically weighs about . This species is the smallest living armadillo and is among the least known.

===Thermoregulation and external shell===
Its fine hair has been found to be beneficial for thermoregulation in an environment with highly variable temperatures. Night temperatures in Argentinian plains can get very low, and since the armadillo is nocturnal it needs the fur to conserve heat while it is being active outside its burrow. 

Armadillos are well known for leathery shells covering the majority of the dorsal side. The pink fairy armadillo has this characteristic as well, but its shell is much softer and more flexible. Though the shell is close enough to the body for blood vessels to be seen through the armor, this protective part of the animal is only attached via a thin membrane along the spinal column of the animal. 

The pink fairy armadillo can curl up to protect the vulnerable soft underside, covered with dense white hair. The armored shell consists of 24 bands that allow the animal to curl up in a ball, and the armor is flattened in the posterior portion of the animal so that it can compress dirt behind it as it is digging. This compression strategy is thought to help prevent tunnel collapses. Lastly, the shell itself is also thought to help with thermoregulation. Since the underlying blood vessels are so close to the surface, the animal can control the amount of functional surface area exposed to the environment in order to retain or lose heat. Like most armadillos, they rely mostly on a sense of smell to find each other and their prey.

===Burrowing lifestyle===
The armadillo has two massive sets of claws on its front and hind limbs which help it to dig the burrows in compacted soil very quickly. The pink fairy armadillo is nicknamed the &quot;sand-swimmer&quot; because it is said that it can &quot;burrow through the ground as fast as a fish can swim in the sea.&quot; The claws are large relatively to the size of the animal, hindering its ability to walk on a hard surface.

Along with these unique traits, the pink fairy armadillo has greatly reduced eyes and relies highly on touch and hearing to navigate. It also has a torpedo-shaped body in order to reduce the amount of drag it may encounter while working in tunnels and a thick, hairless tail that it uses for balance and stability while using its other limbs to dig.

==Threats==

As a subterranean dweller, the armadillo is forced to leave its burrows when heavy storms roll in due to the threat of drowning and the risk of wetting its fur. If its fur is wet the armadillo cannot properly thermoregulate and could experience hypothermia during night hours. Once above ground during a rainstorm the armadillo is vulnerable to an array of predators. Domestic dogs have greatly preyed on these armadillos. Even their underground homes are not completely safe: Fairy armadillos are preyed upon in their burrows by domestic dogs and cats as well as wild boars. 

These armadillos do not do well in captivity. The survival rate is so low that many will die in transport from where they were captured to their new area of captivity. Armadillos that are put into captivity typically do not last longer than a few hours or at most eight days. Not a single specimen has survived more than four years. In spite of the high mortality rate associated with captivity, many are sold illegally on the black market, often as pets. 

Pink fairy armadillos are highly susceptible to changes in climate, habitat loss, farmland pesticide usage, and overhunting. Because they inhabit temperate and warm regions, cold temperatures could wipe out their populations due to their low metabolism rate and inability to store fat. As the number of acres converted to farmland increases, the armadillos&#x27; burrows not only get plowed over, but the land is no longer habitable for them. The use of pesticides on farmlands is highly concerning because these pesticides adhere to ants, the armadillos&#x27; primary source of food. Ingestion of enough of these pesticide-infested ants can be detrimental to their health. Overhunting is one factor that has definitely contributed to the animals&#x27; endangerment. Many people in the Americas continue to hunt armadillos for consumption, which is said to be similar to pork in texture and taste.

==Conservation efforts==
In 2006, the armadillo was placed in the Near-Threatened category on the IUCN Red List. In 2008 it was moved to the Data Deficient category due to the lack of scientific information on its population dynamics and natural history. Field sightings were confirmed to be rare and less common than before, even though the pink fairy armadillo is already difficult to observe due to its nocturnal fossorial lifestyle.

Researchers have found that the pink fairy armadillo is highly subject to stress, making the attempts to apply any conservation policies, including taking it out of its natural environment, extremely difficult and largely unsuccessful. Any modifications in its environment, external temperature, or diet are known to trigger stress responses, which is considered to be a possible reason for the failure of captivity attempts.

Many of the armadillos have died during the transportation process from their wild habitat, and many more have only survived several days in captivity. Overall, there are only three reports of captive maintenance of pink fairy armadillo that are considered successful – in 1970, 1985, and 2009, reporting individuals that lived in captivity for at least 30 months, 22 months, and 8 months respectively.

This armadillo species is found in several protected areas, including the Lihué Calel National Park. Both national and provincial legislation is in place specifically protecting the species.

<text>Maesteg (; ) is a town and community in Bridgend County Borough, Wales. Maesteg lies at the northernmost end of the Llynfi Valley, close to the border with Neath Port Talbot. In 2011, Maesteg had a population of 20,612. The English translation of Maesteg is &#x27;fair field&#x27;.

Historically a part of Glamorgan, the growth of the town started with the opening of ironworks in the 1820s and 1830s. Once a coal mining area, the last pit closed in 1985. With the decline of the coal industry and, more recently, the closure of one large factory producing cosmetics and another manufacturing vehicle components, the valley has become a residential/dormitory area for the Port Talbot, Bridgend and Cardiff journey to work areas. 11% (1,867 out of 20,702) of the town&#x27;s population speak Welsh with 27.9% of 3-15 year olds speaking the language. It is one of the few areas of Wales where the traditional Mari Lwyd is still celebrated during Christmas.

The community of Maesteg had a population of 17,580 in the 2011 census and includes Nantyffyllon. The built-up area having a population of 21,000. 
==History==
 Before the development of industry in the 1820s, the Llynfi Valley was a sparsely populated area of scattered farms. The nearest settlement was the village of Llangynwyd, located on the hillside about south of the present-day town centre of Maesteg. Close to Llangynwyd is an extensive earthwork known as &quot;Y Bwlwarcau&quot; (&quot;the bulwarks&quot;), an Iron Age enclosure that is probably a remnant of the earliest settlement in the Llynfi district.

During the Middle Ages, the valley was part of &quot;Tir Iarll&quot; (the Earl&#x27;s Land), an area &quot;famous for its game coverts, its woods and sparkling streams&quot; that was set aside as a hunting reserve by Robert Fitzhamon, Earl of Gloucester, the Norman conqueror of Glamorgan. Up to the 18th century, many of the farms of the Llynfi Valley were centres of local culture. For example, Llwydarth, the home of the influential Powell family, was a centre for writers and poets in Glamorgan in the 17th century.

According to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, Maesteg was the first place in the UK where Japanese knotweed was spotted in the wild, sometime before 1886.

==Industrial history==

The origins of the present-day community in the Llynfi Valley date from the late 1820s, when the area&#x27;s considerable coal and iron ore resources were developed on an industrial scale for the first time. In 1828, a horse-drawn railway was completed between Porthcawl and Garnlwyd in the Llynfi Valley. This was the Dyffryn Llynfi and Porthcawl Railway (DLPR); it was extended to the Coegnant district near the head of the valley in 1830. The railway opened up the district and led to the formation of an iron company, which began building a works on Maesteg Uchaf Farm, near the site of the present-day town centre, in 1826. The company took its name from the farm, and by 1831 two blast furnaces were in operation and the first rows of workers&#x27; housing had been completed near the Maesteg Ironworks. Around the same time, one of the first zinc smelters in Wales was set up on Coegnant Farm near the northern terminus of the DLPR.

In 1839, work on a second, larger, ironworks commenced at Nantycrynwydd Farm on a site now largely occupied by the Tesco store and car park. The works, which became known as the Llynfi Ironworks (or &quot;The New Works&quot;), was started by the unsuccessful Cambrian Iron and Spelter Company and was bought by the ambitious Llynvi Iron Company in 1845. The Cornstores section of the Maesteg Sports Centre and the adjoining base of a blast furnace remain as links to the Llynfi Works and the valley&#x27;s significant 19th century iron industry. The two ironworks, with associated collieries and new housing, transformed an area of scattered farms with a population of about 400 in 1821 into a growing township with a population of 4,000 by 1841.

The Cambrian/Llynfi Works attracted investment capital from a number of prominent figures of the early Victorian period, including the poet William Wordsworth, who was a Cambrian shareholder in the early 1840s, the gin distiller Sir Felix Booth, and the writer and radical politician Dr John Bowring. Bowring invested heavily in the Llynfi Works in the mid-1840s and, for a number of years, that part of the valley around his works was known as Bowrington. During his association with the Maesteg district, he campaigned in Parliament for a decimal system of coinage and was largely responsible for the introduction of Britain&#x27;s first decimal coin, the florin or two shilling piece (now the ten pence piece). John Bowring lost his capital in the trade depression of the late 1840s, although the iron company continued trading. After his Llynfi venture, John Bowring became British Consul in Canton, China, and was Governor of Hong Kong from 1854 to 1859.

The iron industry in Maesteg continued, with varying degrees of success, until wrought iron making was replaced by the manufacture of cheaper, mass-produced steel during the 1870s. In its heyday, after the opening of the broad gauge, steam-hauled Llynfi Valley Railway in 1861, the Llynfi Works had a reputation for producing high-quality iron. In the mid-Victorian period there was a flourishing export trade to Southern Italy and Turkey; rails were exported to the United States and Llynvi &quot;Navy Quality&quot; No.3 Cable Iron was highly regarded by the makers of Admiralty-tested anchor chains. However, as the Llynfi site could not be adapted for the production of steel, iron making ceased in the Maesteg area in 1885.

During the mid-1880s, with the closure of the Llynfi Works and its associated collieries, the Maesteg district, with a population of about 10,000, faced an uncertain future. However, the local coal industry then began to expand with the formation of North&#x27;s Navigation Collieries Ltd in 1889. The colliery company was led by Colonel North, the &quot;Nitrate King&quot;. In 1900, another company, led by Sir Alfred Jones of the Elder Dempster shipping line, also developed collieries in the valley. Due to the expansion programme set in motion by the two mining companies, two of the local, former iron company collieries (Coegnant and Garth) were modernised, and two new large collieries were sunk at Caerau and St John&#x27;s (Cwmdu). With the development of the coal industry, the local population increased from about 10,000 in 1891 to almost 30,000 in 1921.

Between 1890 and 1925, the valley gained a worldwide reputation as a producer of Admiralty-grade steam coal, high quality coking coal and what was regarded as the best house coal in South Wales. Due to the quality of the steam coal, North&#x27;s Imperial Navigation coal was included on the prestigious Admiralty List of the twenty–six best Welsh steam coals. In 1908, the Cunard liner &quot;Mauretania&quot; was entirely fired by Llynfi coal when the ship established a new record for crossing the Atlantic. By the early 1920s there were over 7,000 miners at work in the valley. However, as the area depended to such a large extent on the coal export trade, it was seriously affected by the trade depression of 1928–38. During that period of acute poverty and large-scale unemployment, the population of the Llynfi Valley decreased by almost a third as many left the district to seek employment in the new light industries growing up in areas such as West London and the English Midlands.

For many years after the Second World War, the local coal industry employed well over 2,000 workers and new jobs were created in local government-built factories and in new industries in the Port Talbot and Bridgend journey-to-work areas. Due to the buoyant coal industry and the success of the new factories during the years 1950–75, the population of Maesteg and district stabilised at about 20,000, roughly the figure today. With the creation of more jobs in the Bridgend and Port Talbot districts, the Llynfi Valley gradually became a residential area, a process which speeded up with the terminal decline of the coal industry during the period 1977 to 1985.

==Demography==
==Economy==
===Maesteg Market===
Maesteg Market was situated at the ground floor level of Maesteg Town Hall and offered a variety of goods until the final stallholder left in 2018.

==Transport==
===Railway===
Maesteg has three railway stations, all on the Maesteg Line. Services are operated by Transport for Wales and run directly to Cardiff Central via Bridgend. The services usually continue to Cheltenham Spa via Newport and Gloucester with one early morning service to Ebbw Vale Town. Previous, long-distance extensions to London Waterloo and Wrexham General were short lived. The terminus station is Maesteg; the other two stations are the most recently built , and Garth station which serves the Garth and Cwmfelin villages situated just outside Maesteg. The Rail linc bus service used to replace a withdrawn rail service from Maesteg to Caerau, but it was removed in January 2012 due to council cutbacks.

In the past, there were other railway stations in Maesteg. Llangynwyd Station used to lie on the Maesteg line a few miles east of where Garth Station is today, and Maesteg (Neath Road) was on the old Port Talbot Railway Line, but these are now closed.

The original Maesteg station was situated a few yards west of the terminus that is there today. Remains of the original station remain behind the Asda supermarket, including the platforms and the bridge joining the two platforms. The old track was removed in 2007 during a land reclamation project. The present stations were reopened by British Rail in 1992.

===Buses===
Maesteg bus station is situated to the rear of the town hall. First Cymru operate the majority of the services from this station. Services run to Bridgend, Swansea via Port Talbot, Caerau Park, Llangynwyd and Cymmer.

==Welsh language==
In common with the rest of Wales, the town has two official languages, English and Welsh. The majority of people in Maesteg are native English speakers, but there is a Welsh-speaking minority. The 2011 census reported that 11% of people over the age of 3 spoke Welsh. However, there were large discrepancies between age groups. 27.9% of 3-15 year olds spoke Welsh, 8.6% of 16-64 year olds spoke Welsh, and the lowest proportion was among the over 65s at 5.3%.

Primary and secondary education is available through the medium of Welsh, there are Welsh-language chapels, and the headquarters of Menter yr Iaith Pen-y-bont ar Ogwr is based in the town. The Welsh-language author and Welsh-medium education campaigner Norah Isaac was born and raised in Caerau. She was described as &#x27;the most influential individual in the history of Welsh-medium education&#x27; by Iolo Wyn Williams in his book &quot;Our Children&#x27;s Language: The Welsh-Medium Schools of Wales, 1939-2000&quot;. Wales&#x27; first ever Welsh-language nursery was opened in Maesteg in 1949.

==Education==
Maesteg has six English language state primary schools: Cwmfelin, Plasnewydd, Caerau, Nantyffyllon, Llangynwyd and Garth. Plasnewydd is one of the biggest primary schools in the Llynfi Valley, with just over 400 pupils, and is an Eco-School. There is also a Catholic primary school, St. Mary&#x27;s and St. Patrick&#x27;s, and a Welsh-medium school, Ysgol Cynwyd Sant. 

There are two comprehensive schools in Maesteg. The English-medium Ysgol Maesteg School, previously known as Maesteg Comprehensive School, recently moved to a new site, at a cost of £17,000,000. The Welsh-medium Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Llangynwyd then relocated to the former school&#x27;s previous premises.

The pupils of St. Mary&#x27;s and St. Patrick&#x27;s pursue their secondary education in Archbishop McGrath Catholic Comprehensive School, located in Brackla, a few miles to the south.

==Maesteg Town Council==
Maesteg Town Council has seventeen representatives covering the four electoral wards of Maesteg East (5), Maesteg West (5), Nantyffyllon (3) and Caerau (4). Until recently, there had been a majority of Labour members for over forty years. Following mass resignations from the local Labour Party as a result of an internal row over candidate selections, several Councillors resigned from the party and now sit as independents. The make-up of the council as of June 2019 is 9 Labour and 8 Llynfi Independents members.

==Religion==
The largest religion in the valley is Christianity; the majority of denominations are Nonconformist. There are many churches and chapels in the Maesteg area, several of which have been converted into flats because they are no longer used for religious purposes. There is a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in one of Maesteg&#x27;s villages, Nantyffyllon.

==Culture==
Maesteg has a tradition of music and theatre, including a rich tradition of singing. At present, there are two male voice choirs – Cor Meibion Maesteg A&#x27;r Cylch (Maesteg and District Male Voice Choir) and Maesteg Gleemen Male Voice Choir. Regarding competitions and awards, Maesteg Gleemen is the most successful MVC in the Llynfi Valley and Bridgend County Borough Council area.

There is also a women&#x27;s choir: Harmony Ladies Choir. There are two mixed groups, Noteworthy Choir and Take Note contemporary vocal group.

Maesteg Musical Theatre Society (previously Maesteg Amateur Operatic Society) is a multi-award winning society which performs a musical and concert every year in Maesteg.

Maesteg Children&#x27;s Choir hosts many concerts throughout the year, and Curtain Up Youth Theatre has been performing musicals since the turn of the millennium.

The rock band Funeral for a Friend originates from Maesteg.

The Welsh national anthem &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; was first performed in Maesteg, in the vestry of the original Capel Tabor which is now Maesteg Workingmen&#x27;s Club.

The artist Christopher Williams was born in Maesteg in 1873: seven of his paintings are on display in the town hall.

==Media==
As part of Bridgend County Borough, the local commercial radio station is Bridge FM. Maesteg is also on the fringes of the broadcast area of the Swansea-based local commercial radio stations Hits Radio South Wales, Internet based Station &quot;Radio Maesteg&quot; and Swansea Bay Radio. The town is also served by three local newspapers: &quot;The Glamorgan Gazette&quot;, published weekly, has its main office in Bridgend, but prints news related to Maesteg; &quot;The Gem&quot;, formerly &quot;The Recorder&quot;, a free weekly, printed in Cowbridge, and &quot;The Llynfi News&quot;, a free monthly paper, based in Maesteg.

==Sport==
Maesteg is home to Maesteg Park A.F.C. an association football team founded in 1945 and affiliated to the Football Association of Wales. There are four Welsh Rugby Union teams in Maesteg. The oldest is Maesteg RFC, founded in 1877, while Maesteg Harlequins RFC was formed in the 1920s. Other rugby union teams from the area include Nantyffyllon RFC and Maesteg Celtic RFC. For a time, Maesteg was also home to the now-defunct rugby league team South Wales Scorpions.

The town is home to two cricket clubs. Maesteg Cricket Club was founded in 1846 and won the South Wales Cricket Association League Cup in 2016. Maesteg Celtic Cricket Club is based at Garth Welfare Park; they have won the Welsh Cup three times and the first division of the South Wales Cricket Association on seven occasions, including a record four times consecutively. Both clubs play in the South Wales Cricket Association Division 1.

<text>Adıyaman Province (, ) is a province in the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Turkey. The capital is Adıyaman. Its area is 7,337 km2, and its population is 635,169 (2022). The province is considered part of Turkish Kurdistan and has a Kurdish majority.

Adıyaman Province was part of the province of Malatya until 1954, when it was made into a province as a reward for voting for the winning Democratic Party in the 1954 general election.

== History ==
=== Early Armenian rule ===
Armenian existence in Adıyaman dates back to the 4th century, where they were known as &#x27;fire worshippers&#x27;. Armenians lived in the area when Muslim Arabs captured the area in 639. The Arabs considered the city as part of Armenia and experienced immigration from Byzantine Armenia due to Byzantine oppression in 713. The city came under Seljuk rule after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 and the local Armenians established principalities in the area. One of these principalities was founded by Philaretos Brachamios who tried to protect the land between the Seljuk and the Byzantine. After his death, the region came under control of various chieftains such as Kogh Vasil and Constantine of Gargar. The region around Gargar and the Mor Bar Sauma Monastery became a particular base of power for local chiefs of Syrian and Armenian origin.

The Armenians had good relations with the European Crusader states, but the Crusader County of Edessa would advance against the Armenians in Adıyaman. Political leaders in Adıyaman were also victims of assassinations by Edessa. The wife of Kogh Vasil founded an army to protect the area from Edessa as well, but Edessa ultimately captured the area. Close relations between the Armenians and the Crusader states, however, continued until Nur ad-Din captured the area in 1150. The area came under the rule of Timurtash of the Artuqids for his support for Nur ad-Din and later the Seljuks from the beginning of the 13th century. The locals failed at removing the rulership of Kilij Arslan II during the late 12th century. In the subsequent period, the area was fought over between the Mamluk Sultanate and the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, changing hands between the two until it finally came under permanent Mamluk control.

=== Ottoman rule ===
Ottoman Sultan Selim I captured the area during the Ottoman–Mamluk War in 1516–1517. In the first defter of the area in 1519, it was mentioned that the Kurdish Reşwan tribe populated the area. Documents from 1524 and 1536 also contain records of the Reşwan tribe living in the area. The tribe was engaged in agriculture after having had a nomadic lifestyle.

Evliya Çelebi visited the city in the 17th century and described the agricultural life.

At the beginning of the 19th century, most Armenians lived near the castle of Adıyaman city and mostly made their living through shop keeping and trading. In the villages, they were involved in agriculture and animal husbandry. The local Armenians welcomed American missionaries approaching them during the 19th century at first, but prevented them from converted them later on. Some of the Gregorian Armenians did however convert to Protestantism and the missionaries ultimately divided the local Armenian community. Ainsworth visited the town of Adıyaman in the 1842 and mentioned that the town contained 800 Muslim households and 300 Armenian households and that it had several mosques but no churches. After his visit to the town, he visited the Kurdish village of Kerkunah in the outskirts and afterwards Kâhta, where he mentioned that a Kurdish rebellion was taking place. Most of the rural areas spoke Kurdish in 1882, while Turkish was prevalent in Adıyaman town.

Armenian nationalism increased among the Armenians by the end of the century and most of the Armenian population fell victim to the Armenian genocide in 1915. There are, however, still some Armenians around Kâhta.

The area was part of Mamuret-ul-Aziz Vilayet as Behisni, Hasanmansur and Kahta districts. These three districts had a total population of 99,439 in 1914 of which was Muslim and Christian.

=== Republican era ===
The names of 224 villages in Adiyaman Province was Turkified as part of the campaign to remove any mention of Kurdishness in the country. In 1932, the whole region was chiefly populated by Kurds. The province had a population of 208,755 in 1955 of which adhered to Islam and to Christianity. In 1960, the province had a population of 233,717 of which was Muslim and Christian. In 1965, the population increased to 267,277 of which was Muslim and Christian. The Turkish authorities put the province under State of emergency (OHAL) in the early 1990s as part of the Kurdish–Turkish conflict.

In 2023, 7.8 and 7.5 magnitude earthquakes in Kahramanmaraş also affected Adıyaman.

==Geography==

The province consists of the districts Adıyaman (center district), Besni, Çelikhan, Gerger, Gölbaşı, Kâhta, Samsat, Sincik and Tut.

== Demographics ==
Out of the 339 villages in the province, 296 are populated by Kurds while the remaining 43 are populated by Turks. In terms of religious affiliation, 293 of the villages have an Hanafi population, 80 villages with an Alevi population and two villages are reported to having a Shafi&#x27;i population.

The majority of the population is Hanafi Kurdish, with a significant Kurdish Alevi population. One estimate from 2014 places the Alevi population at 11%. The province is generally more pious than other Kurdish areas in Turkey and has been a hotspot for radicalization and Islamism in recent years (see Dokumacılar). Historian Şahidin Şimşek argued that Hanafi adherents in the province had been manipulated by the state to believe that Kurdish nationalism equated to Alevism. Another theory points at the poverty in the province.

The Kurdish tribes in the province include the Alikan, Atman, Balyan, Belikan tribe, Bêzikan, Birîmşa, Bîstikan, Canbegan, Celikan, Dêrsimî, Dirêjan, Gewozî, Hevêdan, Heyderan, Hûriyan, Izol, Kawan, Kerdizan, Kîkan, Kirvar, Mirdesan, Molikan, Mukriyan, Pîrvan, Reşwan, Şavak, Sinemilli, Sînanka, Şêxbizin and the Teşikan tribe.

The Alevis of the western districts of Besni, Gölbaşı and Tut are Turkmen and Kurdish.

<text>Penarth ( , ) is a town and community in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, approximately south of Cardiff city centre on the west shore of the Severn Estuary at the southern end of Cardiff Bay.

Penarth is a seaside resort in the Cardiff Urban Area, and the second largest town in the Vale of Glamorgan, next only to the administrative centre of Barry.

During the Victorian era Penarth was a highly popular holiday destination, promoted nationally as &quot;The Garden by the Sea&quot; and was packed by visitors from the Midlands and the West Country as well as day trippers from the South Wales valleys, mostly arriving by train. Today, the town, with its traditional seafront, continues to be a regular summer holiday destination (predominantly for older visitors), but their numbers are much lower than was common from Victorian times until the 1960s, when cheap overseas package holidays were introduced.

Although the number of holiday visitors has greatly declined, the town retains a substantial retired population, representing over 24% of residents, but Penarth is now predominantly a dormitory town for Cardiff commuters. The town&#x27;s population was recorded as 20,396 in the United Kingdom Census 2001. The built-up area had a population of 27,226, but this figure does not include nearby suburb Dinas Powys.

The town retains extensive surviving Victorian and Edwardian architecture in many traditional parts of the town.

==Toponymy==

Penarth is a Welsh placename and could be a combination of &#x27; meaning head and &#x27; meaning bear, hence &#x27;Head of the Bear&#x27; or &#x27;Bear&#x27;s Head&#x27;. This was the accepted translation for several hundred years and is still reflected in the town&#x27;s coat of arms which depicts bears. Modern scholars have suggested that the name is shortened from an original &quot;&quot;, where &quot;garth&quot; means cliff, hence &#x27;Head of the cliff&#x27; or &#x27;Clifftops&#x27;. and the Welsh-English dictionary &quot; (The Big Dictionary: Gomer Press) reveals that penardd/penarth eb (feminine noun) means &#x27;promontory&#x27;.

The civic town coat of arms was drawn by the town&#x27;s architect in 1875 from a detailed brief prepared by the Town Board. It features a bear&#x27;s head above a shield supported by two further bears standing. The shield contains a &quot; to denote that the town is in Wales and a sailing vessel recognising Penarth&#x27;s long association with sea commerce.

==History==

===Early history===
The Penarth area has a history of human inhabitation dating back at least 5000 years. In 1956 several Neolithic stone axe heads were found in the town. A large hoard of Roman rings and coins were also discovered at nearby Sully.

From the 12th century until 1543 the lands of Penarth were owned by the canons of St Augustine, Bristol. The Norman church of St Augustine (on the headland) dates from this period. After the dissolution of the monasteries the ownership transferred to the dean and chapter of Bristol Cathedral.

The manor lands were leased to the Earls of Plymouth of St. Fagans Castle. In 1853 the family purchased the manor outright.

Because the surrounding land was owned by religious institutions from an early date, there was no need for a large family house in Penarth. The oldest building in the area is a Tudor mansion, owned by the Herbert family, on the hillside at Cogan Pill. This has since been converted into a chain restaurant.

Piracy was prevalent on the coast near Penarth and, in the 1570s, a Special Commission being set up to investigate and suppress it. Leading family members in Penarth were believed to be implicated.

Penarth&#x27;s medieval walled Sheriff&#x27;s Pound, an early form of multi-purpose gaol, remained in use until the late 18th century, as a place to retain stray sheep, cattle and pigs or to imprison thieves, rustlers and vagabonds. It was located roughly where the car park now stands, at the rear of the NatWest Bank in Plymouth Road.

In 1803, Penarth is recorded as having between 800 - of land under cultivation as several farms. In the 1801 census, there were just 72 people living in the Manor. Even as late as 1851, Penarth was still little more than a small rural farming and fishing village since medieval times, with just 24 houses and 105 residents, being one of five parishes contained within the Hundred of Dinas Powys, with a combined population of just over 300. Before the pier and dock were built, there was a tiny fleet of local sail-powered fishing vessels based on the main town beach that tied up on the seafront quayside.

The Plymouth estate office retained control over the planning, building and development of the new town, offering 99-year leases and remaining the ground landlord. All householders in Penarth were tenants of the Plymouth Estates, paying an annual ground rent. The situation would not change until the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, that gave householders the choice of purchasing their freehold or negotiating 999 year extensions on their short leases.

The earliest homes built in the town were streets of terraced houses with busy corner shops and public houses on almost every corner, following the contours of the headland and in the rapidly expanding Cogan area near the docks. Local grey limestone, quarried from what is now Cwrt-y-vil playing fields, gave a particular character to the surviving older buildings of the town. To the south of the town centre, imposing detached villa residences along the cliff tops looked across the Channel to the Somerset coast and the islands of Flat Holm () and Steep Holm (). The villas were built by wealthy shipping and dock owners from Cardiff who were moving out of the industrialised city for a more genteel and sophisticated lifestyle.

===Victorian developments===
By 1861, the number of people in the five parishes had increased to 1,898 and to 3,382 by 1871. In 1875, three of the constituent parishes - Penarth, Cogan, and Llandough - were merged into the Penarth Local Board, giving a population of 6,228 persons by 1881. This figure had doubled by 1891 with the opening of the railway and had increased even further by 1901 to 14,228 persons. The town of Penarth thus owes its development to the massive expansion of the South Wales coalfield in the 19th century. Its proximity to Cardiff, which was the natural outlet for the industrial valleys of Glamorgan, and its natural waterfront meant that Penarth was ideally situated to contribute to meeting the world&#x27;s demand for Welsh coal through the construction of the docks.
The development of the town continued to be rapid and Penarth soon became self-sufficient, with its own local government, a thriving shopping centre and many new community facilities. What is now the main shopping area of Windsor Road was originally residential housing, but the owners sacrificed their front gardens to build shop extensions, although the original house architecture can still be seen above the shops. Most of the town&#x27;s fine architectural features owe their origin to the landowners of the time and the results of their vision can be seen by the many grand buildings and parks which make Penarth what it is today. Thanks to the generosity of those far sighted landowners, Penarth earned its wide reputation as &quot;The Garden by the Sea&quot; because of its beautiful parks and open spaces. Furthermore, many of the buildings and features of the town have led to a substantial part of the town being designated as a Conservation Area because of its Victorian/Edwardian architecture. Penarth&#x27;s town library was opened in 1905, thanks to a donation by the Carnegie Trust. The town&#x27;s gothic style Police Station and town gaol opened in 1864, opposite the Windsor Arms brewery.

With the arrival of the railway connection to the Welsh valleys in 1878 came the regular influx of day trippers, often hundreds of them at weekends and bank holidays. The developing summer holiday trade was supported by a large number of quality hotels that provided nearly two thousand bedspaces. The biggest and grandest of the hotels were the Esplanade Hotel on the seafront built in 1887, The Marine Hotel at the mouth of the docks, The Royal Hotel at the top of Arcot Street, The Washington Hotel opposite the library and The Glendale and Lansdowne hotels on Plymouth Road. Apart from the major hotels, accommodation was also available at the smaller Dock Hotel, Penarth Hotel, Ship Hotel, Westbourne Hotel, Plymouth Hotel, Windsor Hotel, Railway Hotel and dozens of mariners&#x27; lodging houses at the top end of the town. All have now closed with the exception of the Glendale and a handful of small and more recent bed and breakfast establishments.

A Royal Navy Hunt-class minesweeper was named after the town in 1918 and survived the last nine months of the First World War, but only served for twelve months when it was sunk off the Yorkshire coast in 1919 after striking two mines. The vessel is remembered among the Royal Navy memorials at Portsmouth.

At one time, Penarth had two grand and decorative cinemas. The first was the Windsor Kinema on Windsor Road, originally converted from a 19th-century Territorial Army drill hall and later used as Monty Smith&#x27;s garage until it closed in October 2015. The even grander Washington Cinema was built opposite the library in 1936 with a classical &#x27;Art Deco&#x27; frontage, on the site of a former hotel and its tennis courts. The Washington closed as a cinema in 1971. After several years as a busy bingo hall, it has now been converted into a coffee house and art gallery, whilst retaining its original frontage.

Penarth&#x27;s other distinctive art deco structure was the new General Post Office that was built in Albert Road in 1936. Closed in the 1980s, the building is Grade II listed and is now vacant. The rear yard, once used to stable horses for the horse-drawn Penarth to Cardiff bus service, is still used by the Post Office for mail and parcel sorting.

===Penarth Dock===

The contract for the building of Penarth Dock was placed in 1859 and the dock was opened six years later, constructed by a workforce of around 1,200 mostly Irish &#x27;navvies&#x27; under the direction of chief engineer Harrison Hayter and implementing the design of civil engineer John Hawkshaw. At the Welsh coal trade&#x27;s zenith in 1913 ships carried 4,660,648 tons of coal in a single year out of Penarth docks. In 1886 Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s , originally a passenger vessel but later converted as a coal trader departed from Penarth Dock on what would become its final voyage. A disastrous fire, during the voyage, all but destroyed the vessel and she foundered on the Falkland Islands, where she remained until salvaged and returned to Bristol Docks for restoration in the 1970s.

One feature of Penarth Dock was the tunnel underpass that connected Penarth dock to Ferry Road Grangetown under the River Ely. Not quite wide enough for motor vehicles it was used by commuting pedestrians and cyclists as a short cut to work in Cardiff. The circular tunnel was about half a mile long with an entrance foyer at each end. Lined with cream and green coloured ceramic tiles, the route was lit originally by gaslight and later by electricity. Completed in 1899, from parts cast by T Gregory Engineering Works, Taffs Well, the tunnel remained in use until the autumn of 1965, when it was closed and the ends bricked up, after a series of violent muggings, repeated vandalism and the cost of maintenance becoming uneconomical. The tunnel entrance at the Penarth end was located near the lock gates, between the outer basin and the number one dock. This historic short cut route was &#x27;almost&#x27; replicated and replaced in June 2008 with the opening of a pedestrian and cycle route across the new Cardiff Bay Barrage.

===Penarth Pier===

Because of the growing popularity of Penarth beach and the need for better communications with Cardiff, in 1856 the Cardiff Steam and Navigation Company started a regular ferry service between Cardiff and Penarth. This continued until 1903. Boats were loaded and unloaded at Penarth using a landing stage on wheels which was hauled up the beach.

In the 1880s, an attempt was made to construct a permanent pier. This was possibly because of the need to find a safer way to unload boats. However, construction ground to a halt at an early stage, when the London contractors went into liquidation.

The Penarth Pier Company was formed to make a second attempt at building a permanent pier. The foundations were laid in 1894 and the pier successfully opened in 1895, at long.

In 1907, a small wooden &quot;Concert Party&quot; theatre was built at the seaward end. In 1929, the pier was bought by Penarth Urban District Council, who added a new pier-head berthing pontoon, and in 1930 the current art deco pavilion was added. In 1931, a fire started in the seaward-end theatre, which, after a sea and land-based rescue, saved all 800 people on board at that time. The pier was rebuilt, strengthened with additional concrete columns, but without the wooden theatre.

In 1947, the 7,130 ton steamship the SS &quot;Port Royal Park&quot;, under the flag of the Tavistock Shipping Company, collided with the pier, causing severe damage that was not repaired for several years.

In August 1966, a 600-ton pleasure steamer, Bristol Queen, hit the pier causing an estimated £25,000 damage.
In March 2011, planning permission was granted for a £3.9 million revamp of the pier to re-open the pavilion as a major tourist attraction. The new plans included a cinema and observatory. In September 2012, the restoration work began on the pavilion, with a projected cost estimated at £4 million, funded by the lottery, the Welsh government, the Vale of Glamorgan council, Cadw (part of the Housing, Regeneration and Heritage Department of the Welsh Government) and the Coastal Communities Fund. Work was completed and the pavilion reopened in Autumn 2013.

===Wartime Penarth===

====Early changes====

With its busy commercial docks and the proximity to Cardiff Docks and steelworks, Penarth became a target for Nazi German bombing raids during the Second World War. The air raids started in 1941 and continued almost constantly for the next four years.

Penarth had its own Home Guard detachment.

Scrap metals were needed to build tanks and aircraft, so hundreds of Penarth homes lost their traditional Victorian iron railings from the front gardens during the war years. Even All Saints&#x27; Church in Victoria Square lost its magnificently ornate gates and the railing fence that surrounded the square&#x27;s green.

Strict wartime food rationing meant that food had to be found wherever possible. The town&#x27;s parks, recreation grounds, open spaces and front gardens of houses were dug up and converted to allotments planted with vegetables. The seafront and pier were packed daily with people trying to supplement the food rationing by landing fresh fish. There was a non-profit &#x27;British Restaurant&#x27; at the top end of the Windsor Arcade, where families made homeless by the bombing, had run out of ration coupons or otherwise needed help, could buy a three-course meal for ninepence.

====Military developments====

Many Penarth Yacht Club members volunteered for the Dunkirk evacuation and sailed their yachts and motor boats around the coast and across the English Channel to France.

The Glamorganshire Golf Club, in Lower Penarth, was the site of an experimental rocket battery that regularly scared residents during practice firings. Lavernock Point was the location of Lavernock Fort, with its heavy naval guns, anti-aircraft and searchlight batteries and the town&#x27;s Royal Observer Corps observation post, that sounded the air raid sirens nightly in the town.

At the outbreak of the war, over 350 soldiers of the Royal Artillery were stationed on Flat Holm, which was armed with four 4.5 inch guns and associated searchlights to be used for anti-aircraft and close defence, together with two Bofors guns. A GL (Gun Laying) MkII radar station was also placed in the centre of the island. The structures formed part of the Fixed Defences, Severn Scheme and protected the Atlantic shipping convoy de-grouping zones. In 1943 there was a Battalion of American Seabees, the US Construction Corps, living on a merchant vessel tied up in Penarth docks, while they built a large number of Quonset huts for the rapid temporary expansions of Llandough Hospital and Sully Hospital.

====Air raids====

One night, in 1942, All Saints&#x27; Church was hit by a stick of incendiary bombs and was totally gutted by fire, with only the outer walls left standing. The church was rebuilt after the war and reopened in 1955. Albert Road School was also hit by a stick of incendiaries and badly damaged by fire, although it was quickly patched up and in use again within the week. St Paul&#x27;s Methodist Church, overlooking the docks, was totally destroyed by bombs. Dozens of ordinary homes were struck by bombs, including houses in Salop Street, Arcot Street, Albert Road and Queens Road.

====Operation Overlord====

In October 1943, a United States Navy Base was established at Penarth Docks (now Penarth Marina) – a base from which many of the troops which took part in the D Day invasion set out for the Normandy beaches. The base was under the command of Captain Arnold Winfield Chapin USN. Captain Chapin presented a painting of Penarth Docks in 1944 to &quot;the people of Penarth&quot;, which now hangs in town council&#x27;s Kymin House, Penarth.

In 1944, Penarth dock and the dock beach, as far as the Penarth Headland, was full of invasion barges that departed for the &quot;Operation Overlord&quot; D-Day landings. Many of the defensively equipped merchant ships were loaded with American Sherman tanks and their US Army crews that had been billeted in Penarth after training, housed in a vast village of Quonset or Nissen huts that had been built in &#x27;Neale&#x27;s Wood&#x27;, now the Northcliffe Estate next to the present-day Headlands School.

British Commando units trained on the Penarth cliffs in preparation for scaling the Normandy cliff faces. Several of the invasion barges were not used and lay rotting on the dock beach well into the 1950s used as playthings by local children.

====Aftermath====
Thousands of incendiary and explosive bombs were dropped on Penarth during the war and as late as the 1970s unexploded devices were still being found in the silt and sand on the beaches between Penarth and Cardiff.

===The town today===
The coal trade from Penarth docks eventually petered out and the docks closed in 1936, only reopening for commercial and military use during World War II. From the 1950s, and up until 1965, the basins were utilised by the Royal Navy to mothball dozens of destroyers and frigates from the no longer needed wartime fleet of warships, until they were sold to foreign nations or broken up.

By 1967, after barely a hundred years of commercial operations, the docks area lay unused and derelict, and much of it was used for landfill. The largest basin, No 2 dock at the Cogan end, is now completely filled in, grassed over and surrounded by roadways.

In 1987, the new Penarth Marina village opened on the disused docks site. The No 1 dock and outer basin were re-excavated or dredged out to provide some 350 yacht berths, surrounded by extensive modern waterside homes and several marine engineering yards. The original dock office and Excise House is now in use as a popular restaurant, with only the Grade II listed Marine Hotel remaining derelict and boarded up, awaiting suitable redevelopment plans. The Penarth Marina development was one of the key catalysts to the similar later redevelopment of the Cardiff Bay area.
Penarth is one of the most affluent areas in the Vale of Glamorgan and property prices continue to remain high. Marine Parade or &#x27;Millionaires&#x27; row&#x27;, with its grand, substantial Victorian houses or modern designer villas with views across the Bristol Channel, is considered to be the finest street in Penarth, although several larger properties are now split as apartments or adapted as residential care homes. Houses in Penarth vary from imposing three storey red brick Victorian houses found on both Plymouth and Westbourne Roads to compact stone terraces in Cogan and upper Penarth. Many of the Plymouth Road, Westbourne Road, Victoria Road and Archer Road houses, originally large family homes with servants&#x27; quarters on the top floors, have now been adapted for multi-occupancy as flats and apartments. Penarth Marina in direct contrast features trendy modern townhouses, apartments and designer penthouses.

In 1930, the General Post Office (GPO), later British Telecom (BT), built its main telephone engineers&#x27; college on the corner of Lavernock Road and Victoria Road, where engineers from all over the UK attended basic and advanced residential courses lasting up to eight weeks. The college closed in the 1980s and stood empty for many years before being demolished for a new development of residential housing.

In 1965, the combined Cardiff Universities built the multi-storey International House on Plymouth Road near the end of Cliff Parade to provide Halls of Residence for up to 300 overseas students attending University College, Cardiff and the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology. Abandoned in the late 1990s, after just 30 years in its original use, International House is now converted as a specialist residential care home.

Penarth has been used as a film location for several BBC TV series including several episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; such as &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot;. The scene where a &quot;Dalek&quot; shoots The Doctor was filmed at the junction of Arcot Street and Queen&#x27;s Road. Scenes for &quot;Torchwood&quot;, The Sarah Jane Adventures (notably 21 Clinton Road, where they filmed Sarah Jane&#x27;s house in 13 Bannerman Road), &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; and Casualty have also been filmed in Penarth. Since 2021 the Netflix series, Sex Education, has been filmed in multiple locations around Penarth including The Paget Rooms and Penarth Pier. In July 2024 actor Timothy Spall was seen filming on Penarth Pier for the BBC series Death Valley.

Penarth was named one of the best places to live in Wales in 2017.

==Economy==
In the Victorian era, Penarthians relied on the tourist trade, which prompted the construction of &quot;Penarth Pier&quot; in 1894. Today, Penarth&#x27;s high street (Windsor Road) is the focal point and commercial area of the town. Most employers in Penarth are local services but the town is also home to some larger companies, some of which operate globally, these include the AIM listed EKF Diagnostics, headquartered on Stanwell Road and the startup Robo-advisor Wealthify, acquired by Aviva in 2019.

==Governance==
===Town Council===

Penarth is split into four electoral wards. Plymouth, Stanwell, Cornerswell and St Augustine&#x27;s. The first three are named after the key spine roads, whilst the latter is named after the landmark church situate on Penarth Head. Plymouth ward and Stanwell ward are traditional locations for professional families staking a claim in Penarth&#x27;s Stanwell School. Cornerswell ward contains both the Cogan community and the Poet&#x27;s Estate where residents live on roads named after Wordsworth, Milton, Tennyson and Chaucer.

== Geography ==
===Sea shore===

Penarth lies southwest of Cardiff by road and has a road infrastructure that has been much improved in recent years, together with a traditional rail link. The Cardiff Bay Barrage between Penarth Head and Grangetown was completed in 1999 and came into operation shortly afterwards. The impounding of the River Taff and River Ely has created of freshwater lake in the Cardiff Bay. The promised pedestrian and cyclist short cut to Cardiff across the barrage finally opened to the public on Friday 27 June 2008, after numerous postponements.

An imaginary line drawn between Lavernock Point, just southwest of Penarth and Sand Point, Somerset marks the lower limit of the Severn Estuary and the start of the Bristol Channel, hence Penarth is technically deemed to be in the Severn Estuary and not on the Bristol Channel. Because of the extreme tidal range there are very strong currents or rips close inshore, with speeds that exceed , for several hours at each tide. The rise and fall of the tides at Penarth are the second highest recorded anywhere in the world and on occasions when certain moon phases coincide with the spring and autumn equinoxes the sea level can overspill the esplanade wall and flood the roadway, particularly if in conjunction with a high wind.

===Soils===
The general underlying sub-strata below the land and fields surrounding Penarth is of a limestone that was laid down under a prehistoric warm sea and subsequently ground down by ice age glaciers approximately 18,000 years ago. This produced the rich, brown and dry soil that provided an ideal growing medium for cereal crops during the medieval farming history of the area. The abundance of limestone was exploited for nearly a hundred years at the Cosmeston quarry that fed the Snocem cement factory in Lower Penarth until it closed down in 1970 and the quarry was converted into Cosmeston Lake at the new country park.

===Cliffs===

The town is located at the top of cliffs that have a distinctive strata rock formation that is world known and referred to as the Penarth Group of rocks or Penarth coeval strata wherever it appears in Britain. The Penarth cliffs are made of interspersed layers of limestone and alabaster, both of which are dry and crumbly rocks. The Penarth cliffs contain the largest known outcrop of naturally occurring Pink Alabaster anywhere in the world but, although decorative and highly prized by local gardeners to crown their rockeries, it is considered to be much inferior to the harder and hand-carvable whiter alabasters found elsewhere.

The main problem associated with the dry and crumbly nature of the limestone and alabaster rocks, that make up the cliffs that border Penarth, is the continuing and relentless erosion by the sea. Rockfalls are frequent and walkers using the beach should not walk too close to the base of the cliffs. A rusty sign can be seen where the town beach merged into the base of the cliff, with this trilingual message:

&quot;Caution: Beware of stones falling from the cliff. Beware of being caught by the high tides.
&quot;Rhybudd: Gochelwch y ceryg yn syrthio or dybin uwchben ar perygl o fod ar y traeth pan y mae y llanw yn dod i mewn.&quot;
Avis: Attention à la marée montante! Attention aux debris de roc oui (sic = &quot;qui&quot;) se detachent des falaises&quot;.

The cliff has retreated many tens of metres even in living memory, with the area around Penarth Head remaining most at threat and several structures once on the clifftop already having been smashed on the beach below. A reinforced concrete and iron staircase that once led from Penarth Head to the beach, built by the war department just before the First World War, was already destroyed by advancing erosion as long ago as the early 1950s.

==Demography==

At the beginning of the 19th century Penarth was no more than a village, being one of five parishes in the Hundred of Dinas Powys. It had a total population of just over 300. By 1861 the number of people in the five parishes had increased to 1,898 and by 1871 to 3,382.

==Regeneration of the seafront and town centre==

Despite town centre improvements, since the 1980s Penarth seafront has seen many Victorian hotels and houses demolished in favour of modern apartment blocks. The theatre and bars on the town&#x27;s pier were allowed to fall into neglect and disrepair, although the pier itself remains open to the public.

In August 2008 plans for the development of the pier&#x27;s derelict pavilion were made public. The two million pound Lottery-funded scheme was planned to include a 98-seat cinema and theatre, a cafe and gallery, bar and a large multi-purpose area that will retain the Victorian vaulted ceiling. The Vale of Glamorgan council allocated a starter contribution of £800,000 to enable the initial Lottery Fund application to proceed, an application that was declined due to shortage of available funds. In the autumn of 2008 a Penarth Town Centre Task and Finish Group was formed to look for a positive way ahead for the town. In November 2009 the National Lottery Heritage Fund granted a £99,000 interim award to permit further planning to proceed. This eventually led to full funding being made available during 2011 and work on the refurbishment project started in February 2012.

== Landmarks and attractions ==

Cosmeston Lakes Country Park has been a popular attraction, throughout the years since it was developed in 1970. Apart from the lake and a wide range of water fowl there are acres of pleasant walks in woodlands and on the heath. Cosmeston Medieval Village is open daily and features historical re-enactments during the summer weekends and on bank holidays. The reconstruction of the historical village has been described as the best of its kind in Britain. Turner House Gallery is located at the top end of Plymouth Road and is the exhibition pace for Ffotogallery the national photography development agency for Wales. It features regular exhibitions of photography, video and new media art. The gallery was opened in 1888 by local resident, James Pyke Thompson, originally to house his personal art collection. There is also a small art gallery located at the &quot;Washington Buildings&quot;, a tastefully converted 1930s art deco cinema in the front.

The Paget Rooms hosts dances, occasional pop concerts and plays by local dramatic societies. The 1970s singer Tom Jones played one of his final UK concerts at the Paget Rooms before moving to America. Welsh band Man once recorded a live album at the Paget Rooms, using the famous Decca mobile studio that also recorded The Rolling Stones and today pristine copies of the limited edition vinyl pressing, named (incorrectly) , now change hands for substantial sums of money.
The beach front promenade remains a popular draw for visitors and tourists. The surviving element of the original Victorian pier is a summer staging point for the various pleasure steamers, that ply their trade from time to time in the Bristol Channel and the pier is used as a popular winter sea fishing venue. There is also the historic Penarth Yacht Club, built in 1883, stood next to the new RNLI lifeboat station and its associated shop, together with a wide range of popular cafes and restaurants available on the seafront. The seafront remains uncommercialised with none of the amusement arcades that can be found at other traditional Victorian holiday resort frontages. The town&#x27;s swimming pool and baths built in the late 19th century was closed in the 1980s and, after a short reincarnation as a bar and bistro, has recently been converted into flats while retaining its Victorian exterior.

The clifftop walks to the bays of Lavernock, St Mary&#x27;s Well and Swanbridge with their beaches and the historic hut where Marconi first transmitted radio messages over open sea remain popular with residents and visitors alike. The old trackbed of the railway that once connected Penarth to Cadoxton and Barry Island and was closed by the Beeching Axe is now a rural greenway and cycle track from the Archer Road rail bridge as far as the Fort Road bridge in Lavernock. The remaining main section of the Lavernock Fort gun battery has been listed as an Ancient Monument. The Lavernock Point Nature Reserve is managed by the Wildlife Trust of South &amp; West Wales.

The town has mounted the two-week-long Penarth Holiday Festival each July since 1966 that features special events and celebrations all over the town. These have included pop concerts, yacht regattas and power boat races, donkey derbies, parades, fairs and fetes in the parks, tea dances, stage shows, art exhibitions and spectacular firework displays. In 1970 the festival was closed with an air display by the Red Arrows above the clifftops and sea front.

===Urban parks===

Alexandra Gardens is the town&#x27;s main Victorian park, opened in 1902, with flowerbeds, glades, an ornamental fishpond, bandstand and the town&#x27;s Cenotaph memorial to the fallen of two world wars. The park leads from the town down to the seafront, almost connecting up with the Windsor Gardens Park that runs above and parallel to the esplanade. On the seafront itself is the Victorian Italian Garden that displays many unusual palm trees and exotic plants. All three parks are included on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales, Alexandra Gardens at Grade II*, and Windsor Gardens and the Italian Gardens at Grade II.

== Education ==
===Secondary schools===
St Cyres Comprehensive School, formerly Penarth County Secondary School has employed a keen focus on its Welsh Baccalaureate programme, where it has led the way in delivering this new qualification, associated to the International Baccalaureate programme. Spread over two sites with years seven to nine located in both Penarth and nearby Dinas Powys, and years ten to thirteen on just Penarth, the bigger of the two sites. Work to complete the new school completed in 2012 with the completion of the Penarth Learning Community providing enviable facilities in the £48 million development.

== Religious sites ==

Local church sites are:

* St Augustine&#x27;s Church is just off Church Place on Penarth Headland. The Penarth parish church of Saint Augustine stands on the headland site of a much earlier church probably dating from 1240. The original church was demolished in 1865 and the new much larger church built in 1866 at a cost of £10,000, financed by Harriet Windsor-Clive, 13th Baroness Windsor. It was designed by the famous Victorian architect William Butterfield and it is described as one of his best polychromatic churches. The interior uses a mixture of coloured bricks and stone in yellow, pink, red, black and white. Because the distinctive tower of the old church it had appeared on navigational charts. At the request of the Admiralty a similar saddle-back tower was kept in the new design. The new tower was 90 feet high, much larger than the old church. St Augustine&#x27;s is a Grade I listed building. The churchyard cross is medieval and dates from the original church, but is much weathered and most of the detailed decoration has vanished.
*St Peter&#x27;s Church also known as Old Cogan Church Church in Wales is located off Sully Road and may have originally been a wooden structure built as early as 800. &quot;The present structure is one of the earliest ecclesiastical buildings surviving in the Vale of Glamorgan and the Diocese of Llandaff. There is a reference to it in 1180 so it was probably constructed just before that of thin lias limestone slabs, a local stone, in a herringbone pattern more typical of earlier Saxon times.&quot;
* All Saints Church in Wales is located in Victoria Square. Built by the Earl of Plymouth in 1892, on a greenfield site previously used as the town&#x27;s cricket and rugby field and donated by wealthy Penarth butcher David Cornwall, the church is now surrounded by a square of later housing although the original grassed area has been retained and landscaped with trees. Destroyed by a German air raid in 1943, the church was rebuilt and reopened in 1955.

* St. Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church is on Wordsworth Avenue. The church relocated from an earlier premises in the triangle opposite the old Royal Hotel, where Arcot Street meets Queen&#x27;s Road. The original church and school was built by Bishop Hedley in 1873.
* Trinity Methodist Church is in Woodland Place. The present church, built 1901 in a Gothic style, has the only spire left in the town and was designed by Henry Budgen. The congregation had met since 1890 in a corrugated iron building on the site known as &#x27;Playter&#x27;s Church&#x27; built in the 1880s. In 1896 a schoolroom had been built alongside the iron church. Trinity was damaged several times by bombing during World War II, and its stained glass windows were removed for safekeeping to the Coed Ely Coal Pit, Gilfach Goch. In 1970 a day centre for the elderly was established and in 1986 a radical remodelling of the original school accommodation provided meeting rooms, a thriving youth club, kitchens and toilets.

* Eden Church Penarth meets in the Upper Hall of Trinity Methodist Church in Woodland Place and was established in 2014.
* Albert Road Methodist Church is at Albert Road and Albert Crescent.
* Tabernacle Baptist Chapel is in Plassey Street
* Hebron Church is on Pill Street, Cogan
* The United Reformed Church is on Elfed Avenue
* The Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses Kingdom Hall is on Plassey Street.

== Lost religious buidings ==

* Christ Church Penarth was a grand Victorian Church, built in 1897 on Stanwell Road. The library was designed to complement it. It was demolished in 1989 due to termination of the 99-year lease.

Penarth has both a Men&#x27;s (established 1911) and Ladies&#x27; (established 1896) Hockey Club playing at a high level. The Men&#x27;s 1st XI were promoted in both the 2009/10 and 2010/11 seasons to reach what was then the best league position, but has since surpassed that with further successive promotions in 2015/16 - when they also won the Welsh Trophy cup competition - and 2016/17 to play in the Championship division of the GoCrea8 League that covers South Wales and the West of England, just two further promotions from the UK national league.

Penarth is twinned with:
* Saint-Pol-de-Léon Brittany, France. The fortieth anniversary of the twinning charter took place in 2010. In the 1970s and 1980s there were regular joint civic meetings and events often in conjunction with &quot;Penarth Holiday Fortnight&quot;, coupled with annual student exchange weeks between the two towns of up to fifty young people. Since 2003 when the French town&#x27;s long serving mayor retired and there were changes to their committee no cultural exchanges or joint civic events have taken place. In March 2010 it was announced that both towns were keen to reconnect and an appeal was made for local organisations and interested individuals to become actively involved.

<text>2709 Sagan, provisional designation , is a stony Florian asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 6.7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 21 March 1982, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Lowell&#x27;s Anderson Mesa Station near Flagstaff, Arizona, and named after astronomer and science popularizer Carl Sagan.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Sagan&quot; is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest families of stony asteroids. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.0–2.3 AU once every 3 years and 3 months (1,188 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 3° with respect to the ecliptic.

== Physical characteristics ==

In the SMASS classification, &quot;Sagan&quot; is classified as a S-type asteroid. It has an albedo of 0.26, according to observations made by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and subsequent NEOWISE mission. The body has a rotation period between 5.254 and 5.258 hours and a brightness variation between 0.09 and 0.63 magnitude ().

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named in honor of Carl Sagan (1934–1996), planetary scientist at Cornell University, science popularizer, editor of the journal &quot;Icarus&quot;, and founder of The Planetary Society. Sagan participated on a number of planetary space missions, including the Voyager mission to the outer planets and the Mariner 9 and Viking program to Mars.

Sagan&#x27;s research encompassed studies of the greenhouse effect on Venus, the atmosphere and surface of Titan, windblown dust on Mars, and the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligent life. Sagan won the Pulitzer Prize for literature in 1978. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 4 August 1982 ().

An asteroid discovered in 1998, 4970 Druyan, is named after Sagan&#x27;s wife Ann Druyan and is said to be in a &quot;wedding ring orbit&quot; with respect to 2709 Sagan.

<text>Flat Holm () is a Welsh island lying in the Bristol Channel approximately from Lavernock Point in the Vale of Glamorgan. It includes the most southerly point of Wales.

The island has a long history of occupation, dating at least from the Bronze Age. Religious uses include visits by disciples of Saint Cadoc in the 5th–6th century AD, and in 1835 it was the site of the foundation of the Bristol Channel Mission, which later became the Mission to Seafarers. A sanatorium for cholera patients was built in 1896 as the isolation hospital for the port of Cardiff. Guglielmo Marconi transmitted the first wireless signals over open sea from Flat Holm to Lavernock. Because of frequent shipwrecks, a lighthouse was built on the island, which was replaced by a Trinity House lighthouse in 1737. Because of its strategic position on the approaches to Bristol and Cardiff a series of gun emplacements, known as Flat Holm Battery, were built in the 1860s as part of a line of defences, known as Palmerston Forts. On the outbreak of World War II, the island was rearmed.

It forms part of the City and County of Cardiff and is now managed by Cardiff Council&#x27;s Flat Holm Project Team and designated as a Local Nature Reserve, Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Protection Area, because of the maritime grassland and rare plants such as rock sea-lavender (&quot;Limonium binervosum&quot;) and wild leek (&quot;Allium ampeloprasum&quot;). The island also has significant breeding colonies of lesser black-backed gulls (&quot;Larus fuscus&quot;), herring gulls (&quot;Larus argentatus&quot;) and great black-backed gulls (&quot;Larus marinus&quot;). It is also home to slowworms (&quot;Anguis fragilis&quot;) with larger than usual blue markings.

== History ==

=== Bronze Age ===
The first traces of human habitation of the island are from the late Bronze Age, 900 to 700 BC. A bronze axe head was discovered on the island in 1988, between the island&#x27;s farmhouse and West Beach.

=== Sub-Roman ===
In the sub-Roman period of the 5th-6th century AD, it became a retreat for Saint Cadoc, who lived on the island as a hermit for seven years. His friend, Saint Gildas born in the Kingdom of Strathclyde but educated at the College of Theodosius (Cor Tewdws) in the Kingdom of Gwent, lived at the same time on nearby Steep Holm, and the two sometimes met up for prayers. Gildas eventually left the island to become Abbot of Glastonbury.

In June 1815, a Dr Thomas Turner visited Flat Holm in a small boat and was stranded for a week due to high winds. He discovered two Christian graves located close together in a field northeast of the island&#x27;s present farmhouse; one grave had been opened and contained a male skeleton. The open grave&#x27;s headstone was made of purbeck marble and engraved with a Celtic cross, but had since broken in two. A second disturbed grave, also marked with a headstone, was found to the southeast and contained a coffin constructed with iron bolts. Inside the coffin were two skeletons which had been doused in lime, indicating that the occupants had probably died from a contagious disease.

=== Middle Ages ===

Anglo-Saxons called the island &quot;Bradanreolice&quot;. &quot;Reolice&quot; derives from an Irish word meaning churchyard or graveyard, alluding to the belief that the island had religious significance as a place of burial to people at the time. However, the island&#x27;s current English name of &quot;Holm&quot; comes from the Old Norse meaning &quot;island in an estuary&quot;. Records indicate that a Viking fleet from the south of Brittany led by two earls, Ottir (&quot;Oter&quot;) and &quot;Hroald&quot; (possibly Ottir&#x27;s king Ragnall), took refuge on the island following their defeat by the Saxons at Watchet.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that in 1067, Gytha Thorkelsdóttir, mother of Harold II, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, stayed on the island before travelling to St Omer in France after the Norman conquest of England. After the invasion, Robert Fitzhamon formed the Shire of Glamorgan in Wales proper, with Cardiff Castle at the centre of his new domain. Flat Holm came within the parish boundary of St Mary&#x27;s, one of Cardiff&#x27;s two parish churches, and was kept as a hereditary property of the Norman Lords of Glamorgan.

A survey by archaeologist Howard Thomas in 1979 unearthed a number of medieval potsherds in the vicinity of the farmhouse and found evidence of continuous occupation of the island including middens containing numerous animal bones along with oyster and cockle shells. Fragments of green glazed jugs and flagons from the late 12th to 13th century and shards of pottery from the 14th century were also found on the island. The presence of Pennant sandstone roofing tiles and a fragment of a 14th-century glazed ridge tile indicate the existence of a substantial medieval building, possibly a chapel, demolished when the present farmhouse was constructed. Property records from 1542 show that King Henry VIII granted a lease to farm the island to a gentleman by the name of Edmund Tournor. His family remained on Flat Holm until the end of the 17th century when the lease passed to Joseph Robins.

=== 18th century – smuggling ===
During the 18th century, the island&#x27;s location made it an ideal base for smuggling. It has been alleged that an old mine shaft on the north side of the island connects with a series of natural tunnels, and a concealed exit to the sea. Although Flat Holm was in full view of both the Welsh and English coasts, customs authorities were powerless to act as they had no boat to take them to the island. According to tradition, a small cave in the east cliff at Flat Holm was used for the storage of contraband, mainly tea and brandy.

=== 19th century – Seafarer&#x27;s Mission and Marconi ===
In 1835, clergyman John Ashley from Clevedon voluntarily ministered to the population of the island. Ashley created the Bristol Channel Mission in order to serve seafarers on the 400 sailing vessels which used the Bristol Channel. The mission would later become the Mission to Seafarers, which still provides ministerial services to sailors in over 300 ports. A service is held annually to bless the island.

On 13 May 1897, a 22-year-old Italian inventor named Guglielmo Marconi, assisted by a Cardiff Post Office engineer named George Kemp, transmitted the first wireless signals over open sea from Flat Holm to Lavernock Point near Penarth, Wales. Having failed to interest the Italian government in his project, Marconi had brought his telegraphy system to Britain. Here he met Welshman William Preece who was at that time Chief Engineer of the General Post Office and a major figure in the field. Marconi and Preece erected a high transmitting mast on Flat Holm as well as a receiving mast at Lavernock Point. The first trials on 11 May and 12 failed. On 13 May, the mast at Lavernock was raised to and the signals were received clearly. The message sent by Morse Code was &quot;Are you ready&quot;; the original paper Morse slip, signed by both Marconi and Kemp, is now in the National Museum of Wales.

The island made communication history again on 8 October 2002, by becoming one of the first areas of South Wales to link to the Internet through a wireless connection deployed by Cardiff Council as part of the Flat Holm Project. The connection is used for Internet, access to Cardiff Council&#x27;s data network and VOIP telephony. Cardiff Council&#x27;s communication consultant Spencer Pearson made the first telephone call from the island 108 years after pioneer Marconi&#x27;s wireless transmissions.

==Shipwrecks==
The treacherous conditions for ships around the island led to several shipwrecks. The British passenger vessel &quot;Tapley&quot; lost seven passengers when she became stranded on Flat Holm in January 1773 on her passage from Cork, Ireland to Bristol.

On 23 October 1817, a British sloop, &quot;William and Mary&quot;, foundered after hitting the three rocky islets known as The Wolves which are not far from near Flat Holm. The ship was en route from Bristol to Waterford and sank within 15 minutes. The ship&#x27;s mate, John Outridge, and two sailors made off in the only lifeboat. 15 survivors were later rescued, having clung to the ship&#x27;s rigging, but 54 other passengers were lost. 50 of the bodies were recovered from the ship and were buried on Flat Holm.

In 1938 the steamship &quot;Norman Queen&quot; ran ashore on Flat Holm but was refloated, and in 1941 the steamship &quot;Middlesex&quot; was lost.

==Geography==

Flat Holm is located in the Bristol Channel. It is a small, almost circular, limestone island, approximately in diameter, covering . It rises in a gentle slope from the exposed western rocky shore to more sheltered easterly cliffs, at the top of which stands the prominent lighthouse. At its highest point it is above sea level. Flat Holm is part of Wales, although it is in the English parliamentary constituency of Bristol North West, whereas the nearby island of Steep Holm is part of England. About northwest of Flat Holm are three rocky islets collectively known as The Wolves, measuring approximately by .

The tidal range of the Bristol Channel is ; second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.

==Geology==
During much of the most recent ice ages, from 1.8 million years ago, the sea level in the Severn Estuary was some below the current level and Flat Holm was joined to the Somerset coast as an extremity of the Mendip Hills. Sometime since the start of the Mesolithic period, 15,000 years ago, the ice sheets retreated, and the flat plains surrounding the river estuary flooded; the hilltops of Mendip Hills became the islands of Flat Holm and Steep Holm.

The Carboniferous Limestone of which Flat Holm and neighbouring Steep Holm are composed forms a part of a wider Mesozoic basin extending from the Bristol and Mendip area westwards beneath the mouth of the Severn to South Wales, outcropping to the west at Sully Island and Barry, Wales. Part of the island is designated a Geological Conservation Review (GCR) Site and is a recognised Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The GCR and SSSI interest lies along the south-western shoreline from the north west point to Lighthouse Point where a wave cut portion of the limestone displays large fossil &quot;ripple marks&quot;.

During the Ice Age, the island was covered by glacier ice on several occasions. There are abundant erratic pebbles on the beaches, mostly from Pembrokeshire, indicating that the ice that covered the island was that of the Irish Sea Ice Stream, travelling from west to east up the Bristol Channel. There are also larger erratics, including one spectacular pink granite boulder on a rocky foreshore near the farmhouse.

There are argentiferous (i.e. silver-bearing) galena deposits on Flat Holm; the pits and mounds visible on the surface of the island are a result of trial borings. A dispute over lead mining rights in the 1780s ended with John Stuart, Lord Mount Stuart making an official complaint that the lighthouse keeper was using the coals intended for the lighthouse for processing lead. Mining for lead was not profitable, however, and the works were abandoned. Red marl from the Triassic Period fills joints in the Carboniferous Limestone showing evidence of karstic (cave forming) processes during this period. Caves on the western and north-eastern sides of the island were used during the years of smuggling.

== Buildings ==

=== Lighthouse and foghorn station ===
=== Farmhouse ===

Records show that monks from St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey in Bristol established a dairy farm and grange on the island after Flat Holm was granted to them by Robert, Earl of Gloucester in 1150. Dr Thomas Turner, who was stranded on Flat Holm during a visit in 1815, passed the time by exploring the island. He noted that the tax-exempt abbey farm was prospering and counted &quot;seven cows, two bulls, five sheep, one horse, two pigs and two dogs&quot;. In 1897 the farmhouse was converted into The Flat Holm Hotel, and a bar and skittle alley were added, but the hotel closed after a few years. The farmhouse has been renovated by the Flat Holm Project and is now used as accommodation for visitors.

=== Batteries and barracks ===
Flat Holm was fortified in the 1860s following a visit by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to France, where they had been concerned by the strength of the French Navy. The Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, under direction of Lord Palmerston, recommended fortification of the coast in 1865. The defences on the island, which became part of a line of defences known as the Palmerston Forts, were completed in 1869.

Flat Holm Battery is a series of gun emplacements on Flat Holm built to protect Bristol and Cardiff across the channel. There are remains of four battery sites on the island:

* Castle Rock Battery: three guns in two Moncrieff pits and one open-backed pit
* Farm House Battery: two guns in one full Moncrieff pit and one open-backed pit
* Well Battery: one gun in an open-backed Moncrieff pit. The gun was removed by Army Apprentices in 1964.
* Lighthouse Battery: three guns in two full Moncrieff pits and one open-backed pit

These four emplacements run from the northern to the southern point of the island, along the western coast. Nine Rifled muzzle loaders (RMLs) on disappearing Moncrieff carriages were built at the Royal Gun Foundry, Woolwich. They were mounted in four separate batteries, all in Moncrieff pits, in diameter and deep, constructed of limestone blocks and bricks. These pits had the advantage of being almost invisible to shipping and also offered protection to the gun crews. The RML 7-inch 7 ton guns were too heavy for mobile land service. They consisted of a steel rifle tube surrounded by wrought iron coils, and cascabel, with an overall length of each gun is . They used a Palliser shell and were mounted on the Moncrieff disappearing carriage. The guns were never needed and were fired only for test purposes.
In 1869, stone barracks were built to sleep up to 50 men. The men were stationed on the island to keep the guns in good working order but the garrison would have been reinforced by regular artillery and volunteer troops if ever an invasion had been imminent. The barracks for the battery were located near the southernmost battery emplacement. Other fortifications included a large drainage basin, underground storage tank, an administrative building and a secure store. A &quot;ditch-and-bank&quot; system served to protect the Lighthouse Battery from cross-island attack. The barracks were vacated in 1901 and the buildings have now been restored by the Flat Holm Project for educational use.

=== Radar station ===
At the outbreak of World War II over 350 soldiers of the Royal Artillery were stationed on the island. Flat Holm was re-armed with four 4.5-inch guns and associated searchlights for anti-aircraft and close defence, together with two 40mm Bofors guns. A GL (Gun Laying) Mk II radar station was also placed in the centre of the island. The structures formed part of the Fixed Defences, and protected the Atlantic shipping convoys between Cardiff, Barry, and Flat Holm. These works were abandoned after the war and the island has had no military use since. Flat Holm&#x27;s helipad still remains, however, at the centre of the island.

=== Isolation hospital ===
In July 1883, the steamship &quot;Rishanglys&quot; left three seamen on the island who were believed to be suffering from cholera, one of whom subsequently died. The only accommodation was a canvas tent, and the regular inhabitants of the island petitioned Cardiff council for compensation, complaining of loss of income from visitors and difficulty in selling vegetables grown on their farm at the market in Cardiff. In 1896, the Marquis of Bute, then-owner of Flat Holm, agreed to lease all the land that was not already in use by the military or the lighthouse to the Cardiff Corporation for £50 per year. The corporation then built a permanent sanatorium on the land for use by cholera patients. The building was described in &quot;The Lancet&quot; as a &quot;pavilion&quot; comprising two six-bed wards and a nurse&#x27;s room. In 1893, three more sailors arrived in Cardiff from Marseille on the SS &quot;Blue Jacket&quot; and were suspected of having cholera. The first engineer, Thomas Smith, and able seaman Robert Doran, were deported to the isolation hospital on Flat Holm to prevent spread of the disease. The second mate, P. J. Morris, was also sent to the island as a precautionary measure, but quickly recovered. The Flat Holm sanatorium is unique in being the only Victorian isolation hospital sited on a British offshore island. The last patient to die in the hospital, a victim of bubonic plague, was cremated on the island at the end of the 19th century. The hospital finally closed in 1935 and has remained derelict since. Both the hospital main block and laundry block were Grade II listed buildings and considered to be &quot;at risk&quot;.

== Flat Holm Project ==
In 1975, the South Glamorgan County Council leased the island for the next 99 years. In March 1995, the county council agreed to obtain Flat Holm through a 50-year lease from the Crown Estate starting on 12 December 1995. Flat Holm is now designated as a Local Nature Reserve, as stipulated in that lease. It is managed by the Cardiff Council as The Flat Holm Project. The work of the Flat Holm Project is supported by the registered charity the Flat Holm Society.

==Flat Holm: A Walk Through Time==
In June 2021 Cardiff Council allocated £1.1 million (including £645,000 from the National Lottery Heritage Fund) to repair the Foghorn Station roof, stabilise and re-roof the Old Cholera Hospital, and create new guided tours of the island. The project was expected to take three years.

== Flora and fauna ==
Flat Holm was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1972. The designation covers the maritime grassland which is mainly concentrated around the edges of the island.

There are no endemic plant species but the relative isolation of the island has allowed a number of hardy species such as bird&#x27;s-foot trefoil (&quot;Lotus corniculatus&quot;) and biting stonecrop (&quot;Sedum acre&quot;) to thrive. There are also a number of relatively rare plants, such as rock sea-lavender (&quot;Limonium binervosum&quot;), and wild leek (&quot;Allium ampeloprasum&quot;). The leek grows to and Flat Holm is one of only five places in the UK where it is found. Related to the onion, the leek has a bulb that grows for several years producing only leaves, then blooms with large purple flowers that smell of garlic. After flowering the bulb dies and produces up to 150 bulblets.

Others plants may have been introduced by the Augustinian Community for their medicinal uses. These include dove&#x27;s-foot crane&#x27;s-bill &quot;Geranium molle&quot;, an anodyne plant claimed by Nicholas Culpeper to have a wide range of medicinal uses and an &quot;excellent good cure for those that have inward wounds, hurts, or bruises, both to stay the bleeding, to dissolve and expel the congealed blood, and to heal the parts, as also to cleanse and heal outward sores, ulcers and fistulas&quot;. The wild peony (&quot;Paeonia mascula&quot;) was introduced to the island (and nearby Steep Holm), possibly by monks, and has naturalised. Thirty-seven plants were taken to the island from Steep Holm by Frank Harris, the farmer at the time, in the 1930s, many of which died during the World War II occupation and fortification of the island. One remaining plant was reintroduced by David Worall, the Flat Holm Warden, in 1982 and is protected by fencing near the path to the lighthouse. A few plants grown from seed also survive in the island&#x27;s farmhouse garden.

The island has a significant breeding colony of over 4,000 pairs of lesser black-backed gulls (&quot;Larus fuscus&quot;), 400 pairs of herring gulls (&quot;Larus argentatus&quot;), 2 pairs of great black-backed gulls (&quot;Larus marinus&quot;) and varying numbers of common shelduck (&quot;Tadorna tadorna&quot;) and Eurasian oystercatchers (&quot;Haematopus ostralegus&quot;). The feeding habits of lesser black-backed gulls were studied in 1989, and it was shown that smaller clutches were laid than in previous years and that supplementary feeding did not increase egg or clutch size.

The island is also home to slowworms (&quot;Anguis fragilis&quot;). Flat Holm&#x27;s slow-worm population has unusually large blue markings.

The island&#x27;s rabbit population, introduced for farming in the 12th century, suffers from myxomatosis, which effectively contains the numbers. The island has been grazed since 1989, initially by goats, but also by sheep since 1992. In 1997 Soay sheep were introduced and as of 2008 there are 28 sheep grazing wild on the island. Numbers of Soay sheep had declined by 2022 so Boreray sheep were introduced.

== Sustainability ==
The Flat Holm project aims to develop the island as a showcase of sustainable technologies. The original power supply consisted of several diesel generators at different properties and unconnected to each other. In 2006, underground cables were installed to form a &#x27;mini-grid&#x27; between the farmhouse, workshops and the fog horn keeper&#x27;s cottage. This was powered with a 13.5 kW inverter/charger system located at the farmhouse with the farmhouse diesel generator as back-up.

In 2007 the system was extended to include a 27 kWh battery bank charged by two photovoltaic solar arrays of 3 and 5 kW, and by a 6 kW wind turbine sited at a redundant telecommunications tower on the high point of the island.

== Severn Barrage study ==
If a Severn Barrage were ever to be constructed it could have consequences for Flat Holm, depending on the design and the route. A number of studies have been proposed, the latest being when John Hutton, Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, announced a further feasibility study on 25 September 2007 to follow on the report by the Sustainable Development Commission.

The proposed barrage would pass two miles (3 km) west of Flat Holm. The study was expected to last at least two years and would be split into two stages. The first, which was likely to run until late 2008, would reach an initial view on whether there are any fundamental issues that would preclude a tidal scheme in the Severn Estuary.

== In popular culture ==
* The island was used as a location for the filming of the 1941 British thriller film &quot;Tower of Terror&quot;.
* In 1979 the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Look at Wales&quot; presented by David Parry-Jones featured The Bristol Channel and included the island.
* The BBC&#x27;s &quot;Countryfile&quot; programme broadcast on 17 February 2008 featured Flat Holm and the possibility of a Severn Barrage.
* In the BBC TV series &quot;Torchwood&quot;, the March 2008 episode &quot;Adrift&quot; featured the island as home to a secret medical facility.
* In BBC&#x27;s &quot;Not in My Nature&quot; broadcast by BBC One Wales on 23 June 2008, presenter Iolo Williams visited Flat Holm.

<text>2675 Tolkien, provisional designation , is a stony Florian asteroid and extremely slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 14 April 1982, by British astronomer Martin Watt at Lowell&#x27;s Anderson Mesa Station in Flagstaff, Arizona, and later named for J. R. R. Tolkien.

==Orbit and classification==
&quot;Tolkien&quot; is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of once every 3 years and 3 months (1,202 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 3° with respect to the ecliptic.

==Physical characteristics==
In the SMASS classification, &quot;Tolkien&quot; is a stony S-type asteroid.

===Rotation period===
In February 2011, photometric observations of &quot;Tolkien&quot; were taken over the course of twenty-three nights. The obtained light curve revealed that the body is potentially an extremely slow rotator, that has an outstandingly long rotation period of hours, or 44 days, with a brightness amplitude of magnitude (). In addition, the body is suspected to be in a non-principal axis rotation (&quot;tumbling&quot;).

===Diameter and albedo===
According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the body measures , and its surface has an albedo of 0.205 and 0.213, respectively, while the &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes an albedo of 0.24 – derived from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of this orbital family – and calculates a diameter of with an absolute magnitude of 12.2.

==Naming==
This minor planet was named in honour of J. R. R. Tolkien (1892–1973), an English writer, philologist, and Merton professor of English language at the University of Oxford. He is best known as the author of the fantasy novels &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Tolkien also had a lifelong interest in astronomy. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 December 1982 ().

<text>Antonio Enrique Álvarez Cisneros (; born 9 May 1979) is a Venezuelan political operative of the government of Nicolas Maduro and a former professional baseball player.
Born in Caracas, he played professionally under the name Tony Álvarez. Furthermore, he is commonly known as El Potro Álvarez, a moniker that he has been using since starting his baseball career at a young age.

==Baseball career==

Álvarez batted and threw right-handed. He was signed by Pittsburgh at the age of 16 while attending high school in Venezuela. After graduating, he joined the Gulf Coast League Pirates rookie level in 1998 and gained five promotions in the next three years.

Álvarez was a highly touted as a five-tool outfielder prospect. In addition to his playing in the 2002 All-Star Futures Game and the 2006 World Baseball Classic, he usually hit line drives into the infield or deep into the outfield, ran the bases aggressively, and crashed into walls in pursuit of fly balls. &quot;People come out to the ballpark and pay money to watch the game&quot;, Álvarez explained in an interview. &quot;I&#x27;m an aggressive player and it&#x27;s hard for me to change. If I lose my aggressiveness, I won&#x27;t be the same player&quot;, he added.

Additionally, during the same period, Álvarez found time to develop a successful but not remarkable musical career, ventured into politics and even married three times, each one of his wives being former beauty queens, which led him to achieve celebrity status in his country.

At age 25, Álvarez was ranked by &quot;Baseball America&quot; as one of the top ten prospects in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization, but was never able to fulfill the potential that he showed in the Minor Leagues.

Álvarez collected a .474 batting average in the 2002 spring training and impressed the Pittsburgh organization as much with his enthusiasm and magnetic personality. &quot;He&#x27;s a high-energy guy&quot;, Pirates farm director Brian Graham said. &quot;He plays the game hard and has the kind of attitude you want to see in a young player.&quot; His breakout season came this year, when he of .318/.361/.483 with 15 home runs, 59 RBI and 29 stolen bases in 125 games for Double-A Altoona Curve, emerging as a leadoff hitter and playing for the World team in the Futures Game.

Álvarez succeeded despite suffering personal adversity, missing the last month of the 2002 season at Altoona to return home to Venezuela to be with his father, who was battling leukemia. Once his father showed signs of recovery, Álvarez got the call to join the big club in late October. He played at the three outfield positions in eight games with the Pirates, including seven starts, and was used in pinch-hit roles seven times. He hit an average of .308 (8-for-26) with one home run and a .500 slugging percentage, driving in two runs and scoring six times, while stealing one base.
In 2003, Álvarez batted .298/.361/.470 with nine homers and 53 RBI, while stealing 22 bases in 106 games for Triple-A Nashville Sounds, significant numbers as he spent two stints on the disabled list. He opened 2004 at Nashville, batting .290/.365/.457 with 14 homers, 59 runs, 48 RBI, 19 steals in 99 games.

Álvarez was recalled by Pittsburgh during the 2004 midseason, but was used sparingly in 24 games. He hit a paltry .211 average with one homer and eight RBI but did not steal one base. He was released at the end of the season. Overall, he hit .250 and slugged 406 in 38 games for the Pirates, including 11 runs, 10 RBI and one stolen base. He then was signed by the Chicago White Sox as a free agent before the 2005 season, but failed to make the big club. After that, he played in the Baltimore Orioles minor league system in 2006, as well as for the Brother Elephants of the Chinese Professional Baseball League in 2007.

Over his nine-season Minor League career, Álvarez posted a .295 average and slugged .452 in 746 games appearances, batting 13 home runs with 387 RBI, while scoring 420 runs and stealing 217 stolen bases. In between, Álvarez played winter ball with the Leones del Caracas, Navegantes del Magallanes, Tiburones de La Guaira, Caribes de Anzoátegui, Águilas del Zulia and Tigres de Aragua clubs of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League in a 15-season career spanning 1996–2014. He compiled a slash line of .282/.318/.463 with 46 home runs and 192 RBI in 466 games, scoring 228 runs scored and 46 stolen bases. Additionally, he served as a playoff reinforcement for the Pastora de Los Llanos and Cardenales de Lara, making him one of few players to wear all uniforms in the eight-team league.

==Musical career==
Starting 2009, Álvarez engaged on a musical career as a reggaeton artist. Usually using the stage name &quot;El Potro Alvarez&quot;, he collaborated with various artists in a bunch of music videos taking elements from their styles in order to develop an original style. These music videos were usually directed by Venezuelan Daniel Durán and Dominican Marlon Peña (aka Marlon P).

==Political career==
Starting his political career in 2013, Álvarez ran as a United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV in Spanish) candidate for mayor of the Sucre Municipality, but was defeated by Carlos Ocariz.

Then, in September 2014 Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro announced a reshuffle of his Cabinet and appointed Álvarez as the new Minister of Youth and Sports. The minister, during his statements, explained that sport in Venezuela had been deepened as a state policy during the last 15 years of revolution.

In April 2015, President Maduro announced that Álvarez had been relieved of his ministerial duties. Álvarez was released from office due to his bid for the PSUV primary elections ahead of parliamentary elections.

==Personal life==
From 2002 to May 2005, Álvarez was married to Miss World Venezuela 1984 and Miss World 1984 Astrid Carolina Herrera. After they divorced, he married in December 2005 to Miss Venezuela 2002 winner and actress Mariángel Ruiz, with whom he had a daughter named Mariángel Victoria. Álvarez and Ruiz divorced in 2008. Then in 2013 he married Dayana Colmenares, a model and winner of Miss Venezuela International 2007, and this couple have a daughter, Mia Dayana, who was born in 2014.

<doc id="634847" wikidata="Q991055" url="?curid=634847" title="Milford Haven">
<text>Milford Haven ( ) is both a town and a community in Pembrokeshire, Wales. It is on the north side of the Milford Haven Waterway, an estuary forming a natural harbour that has been used as a port since the Middle Ages.

The town was founded in 1790 by Sir William Hamilton, who designed a grid street pattern. He intended it to be a whaling centre, but by 1800 it was developing as a Royal Navy dockyard which it remained until the dockyard was transferred to Pembroke in 1814. It then became a commercial dock, with the focus moving in the 1960s, after the construction of an oil refinery built by Esso, to logistics for fuel oil and liquid gas. By 2010, the town&#x27;s port had become the fourth largest in the United Kingdom in terms of tonnage, and continues its important role in the United Kingdom&#x27;s energy sector with several oil refineries and one of the biggest LNG terminals in the world.

Milford Haven is the most populous community in the county, with a population of 13,907 within the community boundary at the 2011 census. When measured in terms of urban area the population was 13,582, making it the second largest urban area in the county after Haverfordwest (where the urban area extends beyond its community boundary).

The natural harbour of the Haven was known as a safe port and was exploited for several historical military operations throughout the second millennium. Campaigns conducted from the Haven included part of the invasion of Ireland in 1171 by Henry II and by Cromwell in 1649. Forces which have disembarked at the point include Jean II de Rieux&#x27;s 1405 reinforcement of the Glyndŵr Rising. In 1485, the future Henry VII landed close to his birthplace in Mill Bay before marching on to England.

==History==

The town of Milford was founded in 1793, after Sir William Hamilton obtained an act of Parliament, the Hubberston and Pill, Pembroke, Docks and Piers Act 1790 (30 Geo. 3. c. 55), to establish the port at Milford, and takes its name from the natural harbour of Milford Haven, which was used for several hundred years as a staging point on sea journeys to Ireland and as a shelter by Vikings. It was known as a safe port and is mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline&quot; as &quot;blessed Milford&quot;. It was used as the base for several military operations, such as Richard de Clare&#x27;s invasion of Leinster in 1167, Henry II&#x27;s Invasion of Ireland in 1171, John&#x27;s continued subjugation of the Irish in 1185 and 1210 and Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s 1649 invasion of Ireland; while forces which have disembarked at the point include Jean II de Rieux&#x27;s 1405 reinforcement of the Glyndŵr Rising and Henry VII&#x27;s 1485 landing at the waterway before marching on England. By the late 18th century the two local creeks were being used to load and unload goods, and surrounding settlements were established, including the medieval chapel, and Summer Hill Farm, the only man-made structures on the future site of Milford.

Sir William Hamilton, the town&#x27;s founder, had acquired the land from his wife, Catherine Barlow of Slebech. His nephew, the Hon. Charles Francis Greville, invited seven Quaker families from Nantucket and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard to settle in the new town and develop a whaling fleet. They began by building a shipyard, and leased it to a Messrs. Harry and Joseph Jacob. In December 1796, in an unusual arrangement, the Admiralty (Navy operations) directed the Navy Board (administration and supplies) to contract Jacobs shipyard to build a frigate and later a 74-gun ship-of-the-line. However, due to a combined lack of local standing oak, access to supplies of timber from the Baltic, and local skills in volume, the Jacob operation soon went bankrupt.

In 1800, following the bankruptcy of the Jacobs &amp; Sons, the Navy Board&#x27;s overseer, Jean-Louis Barralier, was persuaded to lease the site for the Navy Board and develop a dockyard for building warships. Seven royal vessels were eventually launched from the dockyard, including HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; and HMS &quot;Milford&quot;. The town was built on a grid pattern, thought to have been to the design of Jean-Louis Barrallier, who remained in charge of shipbuilding there for the Navy Board. Between 1801 and 1803, the town and waterway were protected by temporary batteries at Hakin Point and south of St Katherine&#x27;s Church, in response to the perceived threat following the Fishguard Invasion.

A church was consecrated in October 1808 and dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria in the underdeveloped eastern side of the town, it remained a chapel of ease until 1891 when Milford became a parish, until that time competing with St Peter and St Cewydd in Steynton. By the start of the 19th century, a mail coach was operating between London and Hubberston, and in 1800 the short lived Milford and Pembrokeshire Bank was established by Thomas Phillips, operating from a branch in the town. It collapsed in 1810.

On 11 October 1809, a naval commission recommended purchase of the Milford Haven facility and formal establishment of a Royal Navy dockyard. This was, according to the report, due to the fact that Millford built-ships had proved to be cheaper due to the cheap cost of supplies and abundant labour supply. It proposed purchase of the yard at £4,455. However, as this was after the Battle of Trafalgar (21 October 1805), when the need for naval ships was decreasing in the Napoleonic Wars, and in such a remote location, the proposal seemed perplexing. However, in light of the end of the Franco-Spanish naval engagement, and the merging of the two sides of the Royal Navy under the Admiralty Board, the fact that Frenchman Barallier would remain in charge strongly suggests to historians that the Royal Navy accepted that its ships manoeuvrability was inferior to those of the Franco-Spanish alliance. In an effort to rectify this state of affairs the Royal Navy&#x27;s first School of Naval Architecture was opened in Portsmouth in 1810. Effectively then, Millford was to be set up as a model dockyard under French management, from which lessons could be learnt for implementation in other dockyards.

In 1814 the Royal Dockyard was transferred to Pembroke Dock; though, when Robert Fulke Greville inherited the estate in 1824, a commercial dock was started which became the home of a successful fishing industry. By 1849, the district of Hakin was described as a considerable centre of boat building, and by 1906, Milford had become the sixth largest fishing port in the UK, and its population rose. The &quot;Pembrokeshire Herald&quot; claimed in 1912 that &quot;the fish trade is Milford&#x27;s sole industry... the population of the town has doubled by means of it&quot;.

In 1863, the railway network came to Milford, linking it to the Haverfordwest line and beyond. In 1866, work was completed on an additional extension which provided access to the docks and ship-breaking yard on the eastern side of the town. Between 1875 and 1886, was a permanent fixture at Milford Docks, remaining there for lengthy repairs. Her arrival into the docks was heralded as an example of the size of ship that the town could expect to attract.

In the late 1850s, work began on a network of forts on both sides of the Milford Haven estuary, as a direct result of the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom. They were designed with the intention of defending the United Kingdom against French invasion, although were never used for this purpose. Notable examples in the town were Fort Hubberstone in Gelliswick and Scoveston Fort to the north east of the town.

By 1901, the town&#x27;s population had reached 5,102, and by 1931 had further doubled to 10,104. In the First World War, the Haven was an assembly point for convoys to Gibraltar, and a base, under the command of R.N.R. Captain (and retired Admiral) Charles Holcombe Dare, to counter the activity of German U-boats off the coast of Pembrokeshire. The early twentieth century saw a period of increased urbanisation of the area; in the period from the First World War to 1937, 312 council houses were built, and public services, such as electricity supplies and sewerage, were completed. The steep gradient of the Rath was at this time constructed, and in 1939 Milford Haven Town Hall was opened on Hamilton Terrace, at that time possessing an inbuilt fire station. 1939 also saw the opening of an outdoor swimming pool on the Rath.
In the Second World War Milford Haven was chosen as a base for allied American troops, and roughly 1,000 American military personnel were housed in the town at this time. They manned an amphibious base which included a hospital built in Hakin and a docks complex at Newton Noyes. The base had a complement of 71 officers and 902 enlisted men, and played a rôle in preparations for D Day. Despite its strategic importance as the home of a large fish market, a mines depot, a flax factory, and housing numerous military personnel, Milford escaped serious damage by German bombing in the Second World War. In the summer of 1941 a bomb fell in fields near Priory Road, and later that year, a bomb damaged a house in Brooke Avenue. In neither instance were there casualties.

In 1960, the Esso Company completed work on an oil refinery near the town, which opened despite environmental objections. This was followed by similar developments by many other chief oil companies in a 10-year period, including Texaco, Amoco, Gulf and BP. In 1974, Milford could boast an oil trade of 58,554,000 tons, which was three times the combined trade of all the other ports of Wales. In 1996 the area hit the headlines internationally when the oil tanker &quot;Sea Empress&quot; ran aground, causing a substantial oil spill. By the early 1980s, the Esso refinery was the second largest in the UK.

===Toponymy===
Milford Haven is an Anglicization of an old Scandinavian name &quot;Melrfjordr&quot; that was first applied to the waterway – the Old Norse &quot;Melr&quot;, meaning sandbank, and &quot;fjordr&quot;, meaning fjord or inlet, developing into &quot;Milford&quot;; then later the term &quot;Haven&quot; from the Germanic word &quot;Haven&quot; for &quot;port&quot; or &quot;harbour&quot; was added. The town was named Milford after the waterway, and Haven was added later in around 1868 when the railway terminus was built. The Welsh for Milford Haven, &quot;Aberdaugleddau&quot;, refers to the estuary which is the meeting point of the &quot;White River Cleddau&quot; (Afon Cleddau Wen) and the &quot;Black River Cleddau&quot; (Afon Cleddau Ddu).

In Welsh, the term &quot;Aber&quot; is the &quot;pouring out&quot; of a river, hence the description of the confluence of the two rivers and their forming an estuary. Also, Cleddau may make reference to the action of a weapon or tool cutting through the land.

==Geography and climate==
The town of Milford Haven lies on the north bank of the Milford Haven Waterway, which is a ria or drowned valley. This is a landscape of low-lying wooded shorelines, creeks and mudflats.

There has been a great deal of loss and degradation of local mudflat habitat as a result of industrial and commercial development – one study indicated a 45 per cent loss in Hubberston Pill.

The town has an historic late 18th and 19th centuries core based, on a grid street pattern, between Hubberston Pill and Castle Pill, and extending inland for . Milford Haven&#x27;s 20th century expansion absorbed several other settlements. Hakin and Hubberston are older, and situated to the west of the main town. Steynton is a medieval village to the north, no longer separated due to the expansion of houses. Lower Priory, with the remains of a very early religious Priory, is in a natural valley near the village of Thornton.

Milford Haven enjoys a mild climate. Its proximity to the coast contributes to wet winters, but it enjoys more sunshine than most of the UK with around 1,600 hours of sunshine a year. This is comparable to much of Southern England. The nearest official Met Office weather station is at Milford Haven Conservancy Board.

==Governance==
===Local government===

There are two tiers of local government covering Milford Haven, at community (town) and county level: Milford Haven Town Council and Pembrokeshire County Council. Milford Haven Town Council is based at Cemetery Lodge on Thornton Road, Milford Haven.

The community of Milford Haven covers an area of and includes the Milford Central, East, Hakin, Hubberston, North and West wards. The community has its own town council. The Mayor is Councillor William Elliott BA QTS, appointed on 13 May 2024 for the 2024–2025 municipal year, and the Deputy Mayor is Councillor Eddie Davies DipSM FJOIFF.

The six wards comprising Milford Haven community each elect one councillor to Pembrokeshire County Council.

===Senedd and Westminster representation===
Milford Haven is part of the Preseli Pembrokeshire Senedd constituency and UK Parliamentary constituency. The local Member of the Senedd is Paul Davies of the Conservative Party and the local Member of Parliament is Henry Tufnell from the Labour Party.

===Administrative history===
When development of the modern town began in the 1790s the area straddled the parishes of Steynton and Hubberston. The Milford Improvement Act 1857 (20 &amp; 21 Vict. c. lxxiv) appointed improvement commissioners to run the town. Under the Local Government Act 1894 the improvement commissioners&#x27; district became an urban district in December 1894, with an elected council. The act also specified that parishes could not straddle district boundaries, and so the part of the urban district in Steynton parish became a parish called Milford, and the part in Hubberston parish became a parish called Hakin. Milford and Hakin were urban parishes and so did not have parish councils of their own; the lowest level representative body was the Milford Haven Urban District Council. The urban district council built the Town Hall on Hamilton Terrace in 1939 to serve as its headquarters. Milford Haven Urban District was abolished in 1974, becoming part of Preseli (renamed Preseli Pembrokeshire in 1987) within the county of Dyfed. A community covering the former urban district was established at the same time, with its council taking the name Milford Haven Town Council. Preseli Pembrokeshire was abolished in 1996 and the area became part of a re-established Pembrokeshire.

==Economy==
Milford Haven has experienced a history of boom and slump in shipbuilding, fishing, as a railhead and an ocean terminal. At the height of the fishing boom, it was said that &quot;every day was a pay day&quot;. In 1921, 674 people were identified as working in the fishing industry, the leading occupation in the town, followed by transport and communication with 600 employees. However, at peak times, more than 200 trawlers and 2,000 people were required to service the fishing industry. The development of the oil industry also helped to boost the town&#x27;s fortunes. However, the slumps have been just as severe, the area being scheduled as &#x27;distressed&#x27; in the inter-war period. Over-fishing coupled with national economic factors contributed to a significant decline in the fishing industry, resulting in smaller catches and fewer trawlers. By 1972, only twelve trawlers were registered at the port, and 1974 saw industrial and political action to save jobs related to the industry.

In the 1980s and 1990s, unemployment at times topped 30%, and the major industry of oil refining created no more than 2,000 direct or indirect jobs. Into the new millennium, its fortunes have risen, as can be witnessed in the activity surrounding the LNG terminal, and the new building works which accompanied it and its connection to the controversial South Wales Gas Pipeline. In February 2003, Pembrokeshire Council granted outline planning permission to Petroplus for an LNG storage depot at Waterston, and in March 2004, an additional site was approved at South Hook for ExxonMobil.

International tourism has also increased, with the arrival of transatlantic liners and the revenue they introduce to the town. 2012 saw 3,000 cruise passengers from six cruise vessels disembark at Milford, and the Port Authority expected 5,000 in 2013. The waterway transports 25% of Britain&#x27;s requirement for motor fuel, and the port handled 53 million tonnes of shipping in 2008, making it the largest port in Wales, and the sixth largest in the UK. There are two major commercial centres: Charles Street in the historic town centre, and the Havens Head Retail Park at the foot of the docks area. In 2012, it was announced that the Milford waterway was declared an Enterprise Zone by the coalition government, due to its importance to the energy sector. In 2014, plans by Milford Haven Port Authority were unveiled, which propose a transformation of the docks area into a residential and commercial destination, including hotel accommodation. In 2017 Milford Haven Port Authority launched &quot;Milford Waterway&quot;, which included a re-branding of the marina and aims to encourage hotel, commercial and leisure developments to the area. In November 2014 it was announced that Milford Haven Refinery, a major employer in the area, would be converted into a &#x27;storage and distribution facility&#x27; with a loss of over 300 jobs.

===Tourism===

Post-war Milford Haven was not considered a promising location for tourism. A 1964 study commissioned by the district council highlighted the lack of nearby beaches, proximity of the town to heavy industrialization, and a shortage of tourist facilities such as restaurants and hotels. However, in the 1980s, a series of steps to &quot;beautify&quot; certain parts of the town commenced. The outdoor swimming pool, which had remained disused for some years, was transformed into a water-garden and officially opened in 1990 by Margaret Thatcher.

In 1991, the Tall Ships Race started from Milford, and this coincided with an overhaul of the docks. Subsequently, it was rebranded as a marina, and a number of attractions including cafes, restaurants and retail outlets sprung up. A tourist information centre is near the retail park and the local museum, in the old custom house, focuses on the maritime history of the area.

==Transport==

The first railway to Milford Haven was with the completion of the South Wales Railway in 1856. Brunel had a vision of connecting London to New York via a railway through Wales and then to a commuter port. The initial plan was to terminate the line at Fishguard and to create a ferry service to Ireland, but after a failure to complete Irish rail links the terminus was changed to New Milford, (Neyland), which was completed in April 1856. The first rail link direct to Milford Haven was completed in 1863, which was originally conceived as a plan to create an impressive Milford to Manchester railway. The trains using the line were operated by Great Western Railway who had part funded the original railway.

Milford Haven railway station, the terminus of the West Wales Line, and the trains serving it, are operated by Transport for Wales Rail. Trains depart every two hours to Manchester Piccadilly via , and .

The main road to and from Milford Haven is the A4076. At Johnston the junction with the A477 connects with Pembroke Dock and at Haverfordwest with the A40. The route to Hakin and the western side of the town is along the A4076 via Victoria Bridge over the docks.

Bus routes passing through the town are operated by independent companies and Pembrokeshire County Council subsidies. Services include a town circular, Haverfordwest and Pembroke Dock. National Express operate services to London, Birmingham and Rochdale via Steynton.

==Demography==
By the 1950s, the fishing industry was in decline, and unemployment in the area had reached 11 per cent. There had been a housing boom however in the years following Second World War. The District Council took advantage of recently lifted restrictions, and built over 1,000 new homes to house the rising population. &quot;A new wave of hope however arrived with the prospect of a booming oil industry. The industry however was not labour-intensive, and did not provide huge labour opportunities for locals, in the 1970s employing only 2,000 workers.&quot; The nature of large construction projects meant that workers were attracted from outside the local area, and the decline of the fishing industry was to a certain extent masked. However, this employment was not permanent. On completing the construction of construction projects such as the Esso refinery and the Cleddau Bridge, those who decided to relocate to the town were faced with what the Preseli District Council called in 1977 &quot;the area&#x27;s serious unemployment problem&quot;.

Milford Haven is not ethnically diverse, with 96.4 per cent of people identifying themselves as white, compared with 99.2 per cent in 2001. 92.9 per cent of people in Milford Central ward were born in the UK, and only 3.8 per cent of residents arrived later than 2001. 96.3 per cent of residents claim English as their first language. 1.5 per cent of residents identify as having religious views other than any denomination of Christianity, including no religion.

===Welsh language===
Milford Haven is in a geographical and historic area known as Little England Beyond Wales, which has predominately used English for many centuries. Although it is the most westerly point of the country and the part of the county furthest from the English border, a relatively small proportion of the community knows the Welsh language. In the 2011 census, only 7.5 per cent of residents in the Milford Central ward claimed that they could speak, read and write the language, in contrast to the Pembrokeshire county as a whole where roughly 18 per cent of the population are able to read, write and speak Welsh, while in the neighbouring county of Carmarthenshire around 40 per cent of people express a similar level of fluency in Welsh. Local disconnection from the Welsh language was highlighted in November 2008, when Milford Haven Town Council unsuccessfully demanded the right to opt out of a scheme in which official documents had to be translated into Welsh if requested; the council was allegedly one of about 10 that opposed having to make such translations.

==Architecture==
Architecture in Milford Haven can be divided into roughly three broad periods of building. The number of buildings which pre-date the town&#x27;s official foundation in 1790 are scarce. These include the medieval priory, and a 12th-century &#x27;beacon chapel&#x27;.

The initial phase of building from the late 18th century is in the area central to the town, the three parallel streets of Hamilton Terrace, Charles Street And Robert Street. Three-storey Georgian domestic and commercial properties are set along the northern side of the main road through the town, and overlook the harbour and waterway.

By the late 19th century, the land directly above this central area was being developed. To house the growing population, rows of terrace houses were built, which slowly encompassed the area north up to Marble Hall Road, and east to Pill, examples including Shakespeare Avenue and Starbuck Road. The Great North Road took a northerly route which sliced this new district in two. Suburban owner-occupied detached and semi-detached properties grew up on land overlooking the waterway and along the course of Steynton Road. Around the start of the 20th century, there was a recognized need to provide accommodation to poorer families. As a result, much former agricultural land was bought, and new council housing was built. These were frequently in large estates of houses, such as Howarth Close, Haven Drive and The Glebelands Estate. They transformed previously rural areas into an urban landscape, and considerably increased Milford&#x27;s area of housing. Council estates were built throughout the 20th century, one of the most recent and largest examples being The Mount Estate, which has been the scene of a number of anti-social incidents.

==Landmarks==

The attractions in the town include Fort Hubberstone, built in 1863 to defend the Haven as part of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom. It is in a prominent position in Gelliswick bay, west of the town, overlooking the Haven. Formerly owned by Milford Haven Port Authority, the fort is not currently open to the public, and has been the scene of non-fatal injuries to trespassers. In 2011 it was named as the fifth most endangered archaeological site in the UK by &quot;British Archaeology&quot; magazine.
The ruins of an observatory, originally intended to be part of &quot;The College of King George the Third founded at Milford&quot;, is in Hakin. Construction of the building was abandoned in 1809. Milford Haven Museum, is sited centrally in the docks area, in the town&#x27;s oldest building, the Custom House, which was built in 1797. Designed by Swansea architect, Jernigan, it was built to store whale oil awaiting shipment for sale in London.

The Rath is a landscaped street on high ground, with panoramic views of the Haven. The land was used in the 18th century as a gun battery, and its eastern edge was the site of the Royalist fort constructed by Charles I known as Pill Fort. In the 1930s it became the home of an outdoor swimming pool, which was converted into a water gardens in 1990. Milford Haven Waterway forms a large natural harbour.

==Culture and community==

The Torch Theatre, opened in 1977 and designed by local architect Monty Minter, is one of only three repertory theatres in Wales, and possesses its own independent theatre company. The Pill Social Centre, operating since the 1950s, is a community hall and events venue, having hosted The Who and Gerry and the Pacemakers. Annual events in the town include the Milford Haven Music Festival in May, Founders Week in June and the carnival in July. Pembrokeshire Fish Week is held biannually in June. Milford Haven library, recently relocated to Havens Head Retail Park offers a full lending service and internet access. Milford Haven Museum, in the marina, houses a collection which focusses on the maritime history of the town.

The &quot;Milford &amp; West Wales Mercury&quot; weekly newspaper covered the Milford Haven and West Pembrokeshire area. It was founded in 1992 and following a merger of its editorial team with that of the &quot;Western Telegraph&quot;, its local office was closed in 2008. A second newspaper, The Pembrokeshire Herald, covers the Milford Haven and surrounding areas. The town is also home to several charities, including PATCH and Gwalia.

Milford Haven is twinned with Romilly-sur-Seine, France, and Uman, Ukraine.

===Literature, film and television===
Milford Haven appears in literary works, including Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline&quot; as &quot;blessed Milford&quot;, and is where King Arthur landed from Ireland in pursuit of the Twrch Trwyth boar as part of the Medieval Welsh prose romance &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;. Drayton described the area in his &quot;Poly-Olbion&quot; as &quot;So highly Milford is in every mouth renowned / Noe haven hath aught good, in her that is not found&quot;. Lewis Morris made Milford and Hakin the subject of his poem &quot;The Fishing Lass of Hakin&quot;, and the gothic novel &quot;The Horrors of Oakendale Abbey&quot; used Milford as a key location. The town lends its name to the fictional Californian location featured in the novelisations and radio plays by author Mara Purl. Robert Watson uses the town as the principal setting in his novel &quot;Slipping Away From Milford&quot;, as did Taprell Dorling writing as Taffrail, whose thriller &quot;Mystery at Milford Haven&quot; explored the 1930s criminal underworld in the area. The town was used as a filming location for the BBC drama &quot;The Onedin Line&quot;, the 1968 film &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; and the 1984 short cult film &quot;Vengeance&quot;. The town&#x27;s Mount Estate was the location for a BBC documentary called &quot;The Mount: A Welsh Estate&quot;, which received criticism locally for its portrayal of residents. Locations in the town, including Hakin Point and Gelliswick, were used in filming for The Pembrokeshire Murders in 2020.

==Sport and leisure==
The town possesses a number of venues for sport and leisure. Milford Haven Leisure Centre offers various facilities, including a 25-metre indoor swimming pool, squash and tennis courts, a bowls hall and a dance studio. Thornton Hall, at Milford Haven School, has an indoor sports hall and artificial turf pitch. There are rugby union and association football clubs. Nautical activities are centered around the marina and Pembrokeshire Yacht Club in Gelliswick, which dates to 1923. There is a golf club on the outskirts, which was founded in 1913.

Milford Marina, the site of the former working docks, was re-branded in 1991 and offers retail facilities, the town museum and entertainment. The Marina itself houses 360 berths for private boats.

There was a greyhound racing track in the Hakin area of the town in the 1940s. It was west of Picton Street on the Observatory ground (Rugby ground today). The regularity of the racing in unknown but it is known that the racing was independent, which means unaffiliated to the sports governing body at the time (the National Greyhound Racing Club).

==Education==

Primary and pre-school education in Milford Haven is served by six state infant and primary schools and St Francis, a Roman Catholic primary school. Milford Haven town is served by junior, Infant, and nursery schools. Hakin pupils can attend Hakin Community School, an amalgamation of the former Hakin Junior School and Hakin Infants and Nursery Schools and the voluntarily controlled Hubberston Church in Wales VC Nursery and Primary. Secondary education is provided by Milford Haven School, a large comprehensive school with an enrolment of around 1200 pupils including the 6th form.

The MITEC School of Boatbuilding &amp; Marine Engineering, a branch of Pembrokeshire College in Milford Docks, offers courses in boatbuilding and marine engineering.

==Places of worship==

At the 2011 census, 8,408 of the 13,907 residents (60.5%) of the parish of Milford Haven identified themselves as Christian. The earliest known religious building in the area was the Benedictine priory, known as Pill Priory, which was dissolved in Henry VIII&#x27;s reign. Other early buildings included the Catholic St. Thomas à Becket chapel, a later &#x27;beacon church&#x27;, built around the 12th century which fell into disrepair but was reconsecrated in the 20th century.

The first religious building raised after Milford Haven was founded was the Church in Wales church of St. Katharine and St. Peter. It is considered the town&#x27;s parish church due to its central position within the town, and the fact that it was built for Charles Francis Greville, the founder of Milford Haven. Other Church in Wales buildings include St. David&#x27;s in Hubberston, St. Mary&#x27;s (1927) and the Church of the Holy Spirit (1971) in Hakin, and St. Peter&#x27;s and St. Cewydd&#x27;s in Steynton. St. David&#x27;s is a Norman church, and is believed to be the oldest building in Milford still in regular use. St. Mary&#x27;s was built in 1927, largely by funds from the local residents of Hakin.

In 2000, the church of St. Clare in Hakin closed, leaving one Roman Catholic church in Milford Haven, St. Francis of Assisi on Priory Road. Baptists congregate at North Road Baptist Church, which is one of the older religious buildings of the community, built in 1878. The Friends&#x27; Meeting House (Quakers), built in 1811 by the original Quaker whalers who were central to the early growth of the town, is in Priory Road. Quakers travel from distances around Pembroke to worship at the Friends House.

Members of both the Methodist and United Reformed Churches now worship at Christ Church in Priory Road, formerly known as Priory Road Methodist Church, which was opened in 1902. In recent years the church has drawn together the Methodist Churches in Milford Haven, Hakin Point and Waterston as well as Tabernacle URC to form a new Local Ecumenical Partnership. The Tabernacle URC in Charles Street was built in 1910 by D. Edward Thomas &amp; Sons. In 2011, when it closed the congregation moved to their new home in Christ Church. The Tabernacle URC was purchased by the local Islamic community and is now a fully functioning mosque.

<text>Completely Fair Queuing (CFQ) is an I/O scheduler for the Linux kernel which was written in 2003 by Jens Axboe.

==Description==
CFQ places synchronous requests submitted by processes into a number of per-process queues and then allocates timeslices for each of the queues to access the disk. The length of the time slice and the number of requests a queue is allowed to submit depends on the I/O priority of the given process. Asynchronous requests for all processes are batched together in fewer queues, one per priority. While CFQ does not do explicit anticipatory I/O scheduling, it achieves the same effect of having good aggregate throughput for the system as a whole, by allowing a process queue to idle at the end of synchronous I/O thereby &quot;anticipating&quot; further close I/O from that process. It can be considered a natural extension of granting I/O time slices to a process.

== History==

=== Prior to the integration ===
In February 2003 Andrea Arcangeli put forward his idea for a Stochastic Fair Queueing I/O scheduler to Jens Axboe who then implemented it. Jens Axboe made improvements to his first implementation, calling the new version the Completely Fair Queueing scheduler, and produced a patch to apply it to the 2.5.60 development series kernel.

=== Kernel 2.6.6 (10 May 2004)===
The CFQ I/O scheduler was first integrated into the mainline kernel as an optional I/O scheduler. It was possible to change the scheduler at boot time with the &#x27;elevator&#x27; parameter to kernel.

=== Kernel 2.6.9 (19 October 2004)===
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 used this I/O scheduler as the default even though it used a kernel based on a 2.6.9.

=== Kernel 2.6.10 (24 December 2004)===
The second release of the CFQ scheduler dubbed CFQv2 is included in the 2.6.10, improvements include better responsiveness and the elimination of some starvation issues which were present in the earlier version. The scheduler now is also switchable at run time by modifying the /sys/block/&lt;block_device&gt;/queue/scheduler variable in the sysfs filesystem.

=== Kernel 2.6.13 (27 June 2005)===
CFQ scheduler moved to a new time sliced design dubbed CFQv3. Among other things, it implements ioprio_get(2) and ioprio_set(2) which allows user to set per-process I/O priorities, usually using ionice(1) command (although using nice(1) also modifies I/O priorities somewhat).

=== Kernel 2.6.18 (20 September 2006)===
CFQ became the default scheduler, replacing the anticipatory scheduler.

=== Kernel 5.0 (2019-03-03)===
CFQ has been removed. CFQ evolved into Budget Fair Queueing (BFQ).

<doc id="634858" wikidata="Q2301626" url="?curid=634858" title="Vacuum chamber">
<text>A vacuum chamber is a rigid enclosure from which air and other gases are removed by a vacuum pump. This results in a low-pressure environment within the chamber, commonly referred to as a vacuum. A vacuum environment allows researchers to conduct physical experiments or to test mechanical devices which must operate in outer space (for example) or for processes such as vacuum drying or vacuum coating. Chambers are typically made of metals which may or may not shield applied external magnetic fields depending on wall thickness, frequency, resistivity, and permeability of the material used. Only some materials are suitable for vacuum use.

Chambers often have multiple ports, covered with vacuum flanges, to allow instruments or windows to be installed in the walls of the chamber. In low to medium-vacuum applications, these are sealed with elastomer o-rings. In higher vacuum applications, the flanges have knife edges machined onto them, which cut into a copper gasket when the flange is bolted on.

A type of vacuum chamber frequently used in the field of spacecraft engineering is a thermal vacuum chamber, which provides a thermal environment representing what a spacecraft would experience in space.

==Vacuum chamber materials==
Vacuum chambers can be constructed of many materials. &quot;Metals are arguably the most prevalent vacuum chamber materials.&quot; The strength, pressure, and permeability are considerations for selecting chamber material.
Common materials are:
* Stainless Steel
* Aluminum
* Mild Steel
* Brass
* High density ceramic
* Glass
* Acrylic
* Hardened steel

==Vacuum degassing==

&quot;Vacuum degassing is the process of removing gases from compounds using vacuum which become entrapped in the
mixture when mixing the components.&quot; To assure a bubble-free mold when mixing resin and silicone rubbers and slower-setting harder resins, a vacuum chamber is required. A small vacuum chamber is needed for de-airing (eliminating air bubbles) for materials prior to their setting. The process is fairly straightforward. The casting or molding material is mixed according to the manufacturers directions.

===Process===
Since the material may expand 4–5 times under a vacuum, the mixing container must be large enough to hold a volume of four to five times the amount of the original material that is being vacuumed to allow for the expansion; if not, it will spill over the top of the container requiring clean-up that can be avoided. The material container is then placed into the vacuum chamber; a vacuum pump is connected and turned on. Once the vacuum reaches (at sea level) of mercury, the material will begin to rise (resembling foam). When the material falls, it will plateau and stop rising. The vacuuming is continued for another 2 to 3 minutes to make certain all of the air has been removed from the material. Once this interval is reached, the vacuum pump is shut off and the vacuum chamber release valve is opened to equalize air pressure. The vacuum chamber is opened, the material is removed and is ready to pour into the mold.

Though a maximum vacuum one can theoretically achieve at sea level is 29.921 inches of mercury (Hg,) this will vary significantly as altitude increases. For example, in Denver, Colorado, at one mile (1.6 km) above sea level, it is only possible to achieve a vacuum on the mercury scale of 24.896 Hg. 

To keep the material air-free, it must be slowly poured in a high and narrow stream starting from the corner of the mold box, or mold, letting the material flow freely into the box or mold cavity. Usually, this method will not introduce any new bubbles into the vacuumed material. To ensure that the material is totally devoid of air bubbles, the entire mold/mold box may be placed in the chamber for an additional few minutes; this will assist the material in flowing into difficult areas of the mold/mold box.

==Vacuum drying==
Water and other liquids may accumulate on a product during the production process. &quot;Vacuum is often employed as a process for removing bulk and absorbed water (or other solvents) from a product. Combined
with heat, vacuum can be an effective method for drying.&quot;
==World&#x27;s largest vacuum chamber==

NASA&#x27;s Space Power Facility houses the world&#x27;s largest vacuum chamber. It was built in 1969 and stands high and in diameter, enclosing a bullet-shaped space. It was originally commissioned for nuclear-electric power studies under vacuum conditions, but was later decommissioned. Recently, it was recommissioned for use in testing spacecraft propulsion systems. Recent uses include testing the airbag landing systems for the Mars Pathfinder and the Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, under simulated Mars atmospheric conditions.

Each arm of the LIGO detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington, is a vacuum chamber long, making them the longest vacuum chambers in the world.

<text>Whitland (, , or , , from the medieval ) is a town and community in Carmarthenshire, Wales.

==Geography==
The Whitland community is bordered by the communities of: Henllanfallteg; Llanboidy; and Eglwyscummin, all being in Carmarthenshire; and by Lampeter Velfrey and Llanddewi Velfrey in Pembrokeshire.

According to the 2011 census the population was 1,792.

==History==
Traditionally, Whitland is seen as the site of an assembly of lawyers and churchmen, sometimes described as the first Welsh parliament, called in 930 by King Hywel Dda to codify the native Welsh laws.

Whitland takes its name from its medieval Cistercian abbey. The monastery pre-dates Tintern but now is very much a ruin. The &quot;white land&quot; of the name (Latin: &quot;Albalanda&quot;) may refer to the famous Ty Gwyn (English: &quot;White House&quot;) where Hywel&#x27;s parliament met, to the monks&#x27; unstained woollen cloaks, or to the abbey&#x27;s limestone. Whitland was dissolved during Henry VIII&#x27;s conversion to a reformed church. Much of its limestone was taken and used for other buildings. The limestone itself may have been from quarries in the Cotswolds as there is no quarry of this &#x27; White&#x27; stone in the area. The country setting of the ruin and the Abbey&#x27;s layout can still be viewed just north of the A40 roundabout and turning immediately left.

Whitland has had a strong milk industry and, when the railway arrived in the 19th century, exported milk to London. Its dairy, run by Dairy Crest, eventually closed in 1994 with the loss of 100 jobs.

Whitland Town Hall was originally commissioned for retail use and was completed in 1904.

Despite losing its dairy and remaining high street bank, Whitland has an estimated 125 small businesses as well as Whitland Engineering, which services the dairy industry and in 2019 employed 90 people.

==Hywel Dda Centre==
The Hywel Dda Interpretive Centre is a publicly funded culture centre. It has a garden using reclaimed stone. Hywel Dda is considered one of the most accomplished of Welsh rulers, minting his own coins, codifying the traditional Welsh Laws, and using his diplomacy to secure Wales at a particularly turbulent period.

==Governance==

An electoral ward of the same name exists including the Henllanfallteg community with a total population of 2,272. The ward elects one county councillor to Carmarthenshire County Council.

Whitland also has a town council, consisting of elected or co-opted town councillors. The town council elects a mayor annually, who acts as chair of the council.

==Railway==
Whitland railway station is at the junction of the South Wales Main Line with two branch lines: Pembroke Dock, and Cardigan. The latter was closed as a result of the Beeching cuts in the early 1960s.

==Education==
There are two schools: the primary school is Ysgol Llys Hywel; the secondary is Dyffryn Taf. Whitland has many local sporting teams including Rugby union, football (soccer), cricket, short and long mat bowls, darts and billiards.

==Notable people==
* William Mathias (1934–1992), composer, was born in Whitland.
* Lorys Davies (1936–2021), Archdeacon of Bolton from 1992 until 2001.

<doc id="634862" wikidata="Q7720219" url="?curid=634862" title="The Broadmoor">
<text>The Broadmoor (stylized as THE BRODMOOR) is a hotel and resort in the Broadmoor neighborhood of Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Broadmoor is a member of Historic Hotels of America of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Its visitors have included heads of state, celebrities, and professional sports stars. It is owned by the Anschutz Corporation through its subsidiary, The Broadmoor-Sea Island Company.

The main resort complex, situated at the base of Cheyenne Mountain, is above sea level, and southwest of downtown Colorado Springs. The resort has hotel, conference, sports, and spa buildings that radiate out from Cheyenne Lake. The Broadmoor&#x27;s Ranch at Emerald Valley is a luxury lodge and set of cabins situated on the backside of Cheyenne Mountain, while the Broadmoor&#x27;s Cloud Camp is situated upon the top of Cheyenne Mountain.

Historically, national and world skating and hockey championships were held at the Broadmoor World Arena, which was demolished in 1994 and replaced by another arena by the same name in Colorado Springs. Golf championships have been held at the Broadmoor Golf Club since 1921. The resort has also been the site of clay shooting championships.

==Facilities==
===Broadmoor resort===
The architecture and color of the hotel is in the Mediterranean Revival style, with the pink stucco of its façade blending into the Pikes Peak area landscape. The main buildings are connected on a circular path around a lake. The original hotel building is Broadmoor Main, which was built in 1918. The others—built between 1961 and 2001—are Broadmoor South, Broadmoor West, Lakeside Suites and West Tower.

The Broadmoor has 784 rooms. Many of the Broadmoor South rooms have balconies and some have fireplaces. The Penrose Room restaurant is located on the top of the nine-story building. A total of eighteen restaurants are located in the main hotel buildings, as well as the golf club, pool cafes, Summit Restaurant, and Golden Bee pub. Broadmoor Golf Club has three golf courses, designed by Donald Ross, Robert Trent Jones and Ed Seay and Arnold Palmer.

The full-service spa has an indoor pool, fitness center, 43 treatment rooms, relaxation room, and hair and nail salon. The resort has indoor and outdoor pools and tennis courts. There are 25 retail shops, including clothing boutiques and other shops.

A trail goes around Cheyenne Lake, which was manmade and is creek-fed. In the summer guests can rent bikes and paddleboats. The Stables at the Broadmoor offer horseback riding.

The Penrose Heritage Museum on the property, formerly called the El Pomar Carriage House Museum, houses a collection of vintage carriages and automobiles. The latter include race cars from the Pikes Peak Auto Hill Climb in the early 20th century.

The Broadmoor has of meeting space. It earns 70% of its revenue from conventions. The Broadmoor Fire Protection District serves the resort and surrounding area.

===Ranch at Emerald Valley===
A 16-acre Ranch on Emerald Green on Cheyenne Mountain. Philip Anschutz purchased the property and built a main lodge and ten cabins and restored other original buildings. There are two small lakes, horse stables, a gazebo, hot tubs, and an outdoor fire pit.

===Cloud Camp===
Spencer Penrose, founder of Broadmoor, established Cheyenne Lodge, which is now Cloud Camp, a wilderness retreat situated 3,000 feet above the resort.

===Fishing Camp===
Located 75 minutes west of the Resort along a five-mile stretch of Tarryall River, The Broadmoor Fishing Camp borders 120,000 acres of the Lost Creek Wilderness.

==History==

===Early years===
Spencer Penrose bought the property in 1916 and joined by partners Albert E. Carlton and C.M. MacNeill commissioned New York architects to design The Broadmoor as a &quot;Grand Dame of the Rockies&quot;, evoking the elegant look, excellent service, and fine cuisine of celebrated European hotels. Architects Warren and Wetmore, who designed Ritz-Carlton and Biltmore Hotels, were hired to design the hotel buildings. Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., son of the famed designer of Central Park and an accomplished landscape architect in his own right, took on the challenge of The Broadmoor&#x27;s 3,000 acres.

Penrose hired Donald Ross, a golf architect, to design the first golf course. At the time, the golf course had the highest elevation of any in the United States. Far Eastern and European artwork and antiques were purchased for the hotel. A traditional English pub was dismantled, shipped to the United States, and reassembled at the resort. The resort had one of the first full-service spas in the country and a supervised activities club for children. Penrose&#x27;s goal was to build &quot;the finest hotel in the United States&quot;. The partnership spent $3 million () seeking to realize his dream. The resort&#x27;s grand opening was in 1918.

A polo field was built west of the hotel in 1928. The Broadmoor Riding Arena was built across Cheyenne Lake from the main hotel in 1930. The Broadmoor&#x27;s hangar was built in 1930 at the Colorado Springs Airport, east of the city, for guests&#x27; use.

===El Pomar Foundation ownership===

During the Great Depression the hotel&#x27;s business slowed, and it went into receivership in 1932. Penrose&#x27;s El Pomar Investment Company sued the hotel and purchased it, becoming the sole owner. In 1937 Penrose and his wife Julie established the El Pomar Foundation, intended to provide grants to support activities in the state of Colorado.

The Broadmoor Ice Palace, an Olympic training center, opened on January 1, 1938, on the resort grounds. It held a total of fourteen National Sports Festivals, World Figure Skating Championship, and U.S. Figure Skating championships. It was renamed in 1961 as the Broadmoor World Arena. Also in 1938, the Will Rogers Memorial Stadium was built across Cheyenne Lake from the hotel. Large concerts, rodeos, and Native American dances were held here.

After Penrose died in 1939, the hotel, the Mt. Manitou Incline, the Manitou and Pikes Peak Railway, and a sizable amount of his fortune, transferred to the Foundation. Charles L. Tutt Jr., secretary of the Broadmoor Hotel and Land Company, and son of Penrose&#x27;s longtime friend and partner, was made president.

As a memorial to her husband Mrs. Penrose had the Carriage House Museum (now the Penrose Heritage Museum) built for his collection of carriages and automobiles. She moved into the hotel&#x27;s sixth floor in 1944.

In 1959 a ski area was built for the resort. The 144-room Broadmoor South and the International Center were built in 1961. William Thayer Tutt, son of Charles Tutt Jr., was chosen as the hotels&#x27; president that year.

On February 15, 1961, members of the U.S. Figure Skating Team were killed during the airplane crash of Sabena Flight 548 near Brussels, Belgium. Eighteen skaters and 16 others associated with the team died on their way to the World Figure Skating Championships. A memorial bench made of granite was installed across from the entrance to the World Arena building (now razed) at the edge of the resort&#x27;s lake.

The second golf course was designed by Robert Trent Jones, Sr. and installed in 1965. Russell Thayer Tutt, another son of Charles Tutt Jr., became president of The Broadmoor in 1975. The resort was located within the unincorporated village of Broadmoor until it was annexed into the city of Colorado Springs in 1980. Following attempts to revert the annexation legally, the Colorado Supreme Court upheld the annexation in 1982. The third golf course was designed in 1976 by Ed Seay and Arnold Palmer.

Colorado Hall, the resort&#x27;s second conference center, was built in 1982. In 1986, the resort closed Ski Broadmoor. The City of Colorado Springs and Ski Vail took it over in order to keep it open. It closed in 1991.

===Sale to Oklahoma Publishing===
Due to the impact of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, the foundation sold its majority interest of the resort in 1988. The resort was renovated after The Oklahoma Publishing Company gained controlling interest in 1989.

Plans were made to raze the Broadmoor Golf Club and built the Broadmoor Spa, Golf and Tennis Club for $12.2 million () in 1993.
The Broadmoor World Arena was torn down in April 1994 and the next year Broadmoor West was built. Between 2000 and 2002, a renovation was completed for $75 million ().
A North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit was held at the Broadmoor in October 2003 with President George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, and Defence Ministers from seven countries.

Between 2003 and 2008, the resort was expanded to include a group of retail stores, 160 luxury townhomes and condominiums, rooftop tennis courts, underground parking, and expansion of the third golf course.

===Purchase by the Anschutz Corporation===
The Anschutz Corporation purchased the resort in 2011. Since June 2016 the hotel has been managed by The Broadmoor-Sea Island Company, LLC which also manages the privately owned Sea Island, Georgia seaside resort island.

==Broadmoor name and logo==
The hotel&#x27;s name and logo is always officially presented as all uppercase with the &#x27;A&#x27;, smaller but raised higher than the other letters: BRODMOOR. In spite of various urban legends associated with the configuration, original copyright documents filed December 15, 1918, reveal the alteration was necessary in order to obtain exclusive copyright, because there had been other uses of the word Broadmoor in titles in the nearby area since the 1880s.

==Tournaments==
The resort has been the site of tournaments, such as the US Women&#x27;s Open and the US Senior&#x27;s Open, since its first years in operation. The first Broadmoor Invitation Golf Tournament was held in 1921. National Figure Skating Championships were held at The Broadmoor in 1948 and 1973. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) golf tournament was held in June 1957. Five years later, World and European Hockey Championships were held at The Broadmoor.

The Broadmoor World Arena was the site of the World Figure Skating Championships in January 1966.

The resort has also been the site of other championships. Broadmoor East hosted the World Senior golf tournament in 1966. The United States Sporting Clays Association (USSCA) had its national sporting clays championship in 1990 at the Broadmoor. The 2011 U.S. Women&#x27;s Open was held at The Broadmoor.

In 2005, Chet Murphy was inducted into the Colorado Tennis Hall of Fame, in recognition for his contributions in developing The Broadmoor resort as one of the leading tennis centers in the United States.

== Awards ==
The resort has received more than 100 awards over its lifetime, including:
* 5-star ranking for the resort by &quot;Forbes&quot;, formerly Mobile Guide, for 54 consecutive years, as of 2015. This is the longest period of time of any establishment in the United States.
* 5-star ranking for the Penrose restaurant by &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2012. The Broadmoor is one of three hotel and restaurant combinations to receive both rankings.
* 5-diamond ranking by American Automobile Association (AAA) for the resort for 39 straight years, as of 2015.
* 5-diamond ranking by American Automobile Association (AAA) for the Penrose restaurant for 8 straight years, as of 2015.
* Listed as Historic Hotel of America by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
* In July 2024, Americas Great Resorts added the hotel to its Top Picks as a landmark property.

== In the media ==
* &quot;Ice Castles&quot; (1978) was filmed in the former Broadmoor World Arena. It starred Lynn-Holly Johnson, a skater, and Robby Benson
*&quot;The Case of the Sinister Spirit&quot; (1987) was filmed at The Broadmoor.
* According to a report in &quot;The Gazette&quot; in 2001, President George W. Bush decided to quit drinking after waking up with a hangover in The Broadmoor one morning in the summer of 1986. He wrote about the incident in his book &quot;A Charge to Keep&quot;. He said, &quot;This run was different. I felt worse than usual. And about halfway through, I decided I would drink no more&quot; and never drank again.
Author Michael Allegretto mentioned The Broadmoor in his crime novel &quot;Night of Reunion&quot; (1990) which takes place in Colorado Springs, CO.

<doc id="634863" wikidata="Q163908" url="?curid=634863" title="George Halas">
<text>George Stanley Halas Sr. (February 2, 1895 – October 31, 1983), nicknamed &quot;Papa Bear&quot;, was an American professional football end, coach, and executive. He was the founder and owner of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL), and served as his own head coach on four occasions. He was also lesser-known as a player for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). He is the namesake for the NFC Championship trophy.

Halas was one of the co-founders of the American Professional Football Association (now the NFL) in 1920, and in 1963 became one of the first 17 inductees into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Halas was the oldest person in NFL history to serve as a head coach, aged 72 years and 318 days when he coached the final game of his career in December 1967, a record that stood for over 50 years until Romeo Crennel became the interim head coach of the Houston Texans in October 2020, aged 73 years and 115 days.

==Early life==
Halas was born in Chicago, Illinois, into a family of Czech-Bohemian immigrants. His parents, Barbara (Poledna), who ran a grocery store, and Frank Halas, a tailor, were migrants from Pilsen, Austria-Hungary. He was the brother of Walter Halas. George had a varied career in sports. In 1915, Halas worked temporarily for Western Electric, and was planning on being on the SS &quot;Eastland&quot;. He was running late, however, as he was attempting to gain weight to play Big Ten football and missed the capsizing, which killed 844 passengers. 

On February 18, 1922, Halas married Wilhelmina &quot;Minnie&quot; Bushing, to whom he remained married until her death in 1966.

==College career==
===Illinois===
After graduating from Crane High School in Chicago, he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, playing football for coach Bob Zuppke, as well as baseball and basketball, and earning a degree in civil engineering. He also became a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He helped Illinois win the 1918 Big Ten Conference football title.

===Great Lakes Navy===
Serving as an ensign in the Navy during World War I, he played for a team at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station, and was named the MVP of the 1919 Rose Bowl. In recognition of his Rose Bowl accomplishments, Halas was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 2018. On a team which included Paddy Driscoll and Jimmy Conzelman, Halas scored a receiving touchdown and returned an intercepted pass 77 yards in a 17–0 win over the Mare Island Marines of California; the team was also rewarded with their military discharges.

==Baseball career==
===New York Yankees===
Afterward, Halas played minor league baseball, eventually earning a promotion to the New York Yankees, where he played 12 games as an outfielder in 1919. However, a hip injury effectively ended his baseball career. Halas said that he was succeeded as the Yankees&#x27; right fielder by Babe Ruth, but in reality, it was Sammy Vick. Later that year, Halas played for the Hammond Pros and received about $75 per game.

==Football career==
===Hammond All-Stars===
Halas signed his first professional football contract with the independent Hammond All-Stars, who would become the Hammond Pros the next season.

===Decatur / Chicago Staleys / Bears===
Halas moved to Decatur, Illinois, to take a position with the A. E. Staley Company, a starch manufacturer. He served as a company sales representative, an outfielder on the company-sponsored baseball team, and the player-coach of the company-sponsored football team the Decatur Staleys. Halas selected his alma mater&#x27;s colors—orange and navy blue—for the team&#x27;s uniforms. In 1920, Halas represented the Staleys at the meeting which formed the American Professional Football Association (which became the National Football League in 1922) in Canton, Ohio. After the Staleys&#x27; season ended, Halas and teammates George Trafton, Hub Shoemake, and Hugh Blacklock joined the Chicago Stayms for a December 19 match against the Chicago Cardinals, marking the only time Halas would be an NFL team&#x27;s opponent for another team besides the Staleys/Bears. The game ended in a 14–14 tie.

Despite a 10–1–2 record, the Staleys ended the season awash in red ink. The Staleys&#x27; financial troubles didn&#x27;t dissuade Halas from significantly upgrading the roster, to the point that it was a works team in name only. After the first game of the 1921 season, company founder and namesake Augustus E. Staley turned over control of the team to Halas so he could move the team to Chicago, where the team had attracted its biggest gates of the 1920 season. Staley gave Halas a $5,000 bonus for the move to Chicago provided that he keep the Staleys franchise name for the 1921 season. Halas then took on teammate Edward &quot;Dutch&quot; Sternaman as a partner. The newly minted &quot;Chicago Staleys&quot; set up shop at Cubs Park, soon to be known as Wrigley Field; Halas had a good relationship with Chicago Cubs owner William Wrigley Jr. and president Bill Veeck Sr. The Staleys maneuvered their schedule to win their first NFL championship that year. The following year, Halas renamed his team the &quot;Chicago Bears.&quot; Years later, he recalled that he wanted to find a way to choose a name that would give a nod to the Cubs. Reasoning that football players were far bigger than baseball players, he concluded, &quot;if baseball players are cubs, then football players must be bears!&quot;

Halas was not only the team&#x27;s coach but also played end (wide receiver on offense, defensive end on defense) and handled ticket sales and the business of running the club. Named to the NFL&#x27;s all-pro team in the 1920s, his playing highlight occurred in a 1923 game when he stripped Jim Thorpe of the ball, recovered the fumble, and returned it 98 yards—a league record which would stand until 1972. In 1925, Halas persuaded Illinois star player Red Grange to join the Bears; it was a significant step in establishing the league&#x27;s respectability and popularity, which had previously been viewed as a refuge for less admirable players.

After ten seasons, Halas stepped back from the game in 1930, retiring as a player and handing coaching duties to Lake Forest Academy coach Ralph Jones; but he remained the team&#x27;s owner, becoming sole owner in 1932. However, severe financial difficulties brought on by the Great Depression put the Bears in dire financial straits even though Jones led them to the NFL title in 1932. 

Halas returned as coach in 1933 to eliminate the additional cost of paying a head coach&#x27;s salary. He coached the Bears for another ten seasons. His 1934 team was undefeated until a loss in the championship game to the New York Giants.

In the late 1930s, Halas—with University of Chicago coach Clark Shaughnessy—perfected the T-formation system to create a revolutionary and overwhelming style of play which drove the Bears to an astonishing 73–0 victory over the Washington Redskins in the 1940 NFL Championship Game—still the most lopsided margin of victory in NFL history. Every other team in the league immediately began trying to imitate the format. The Bears repeated as NFL champions in 1941, and the 1940s would be remembered as the era of the &quot;Monsters of the Midway&quot;.

Halas and Shaughnessy had created a revolutionary concept with the T-formation offense. The complex spins, turns, fakes, and all-around athletic versatility required to execute the scheme limited the possible players available. Halas believed he&#x27;d found the perfect quarterback for his new offense in Sid Luckman, a passing star at Columbia University. Luckman was a single wing tailback; the tailback is the primary runner and passer in that scheme. Luckman launched his Hall of Fame career playing quarterback for the Bears from 1939 to 1950. Halas was not satisfied with other players who succeeded Luckman under center. During this coaching stint, he had on the Bears roster two future Hall of Fame players, Bobby Layne in 1948 and George Blanda from 1949 to 1958. Other notable players included Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lujack from 1948 to 1951 and Zeke Bratkowski from 1954 to 1960. Blanda played in the NFL until 1975; Bratkowski moved on the Los Angeles Rams before signing with Vince Lombardi&#x27;s Green Bay Packers in 1963, where he played an important role as &quot;super sub&quot; to starter Bart Starr in winning three straight NFL championships in 1965–&#x27;66–&#x27;67; and Bobby Layne quarterbacked the Detroit Lions to three NFL championship games between 1952 and 1954, winning two.

While Halas was in the Navy, the Bears won another title in 1943 under Hunk Anderson and Luke Johnsos. Returning to the field in 1946, he coached the club for a third decade, again winning a title in his first year back as coach. That same year, Halas met with the Army Chief of Staff, General Dwight Eisenhower, the Navy Chief of Staff, Admiral Chester Nimitz, and the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Carl Spaatz, and offered to set up an annual charity football game, with the Bears as hosts, whose proceeds would go to the relief agencies of the armed forces. By mid-1957, proceeds from this game were $438,350.76 and proceeds from all games the Bears participated in between 1946 and 1957 were over $2 million.

After a brief break in 1956–57, he returned as head coach for a final decade from 1958 to 1967. Despite winning his sixth and last league title in 1963, he did not enjoy the same success as he had before the war, and he officially retired on May 27, 1968. He did win his 200th game in 1950 and his 300th game in 1965, becoming the first coach to reach both milestones. His six NFL Championships as a head coach is tied for the most all time with Green Bay&#x27;s Curly Lambeau and later, New England&#x27;s Bill Belichick. In 40 years as a coach, he endured only six losing seasons, three of which came during his final stint.

===Newark Bears / Bombers===
In 1939, Halas followed Tim Mara&#x27;s footsteps who purchased the Stapleton Buffaloes in 1937 and obtained the rights to a former NFL club Newark Tornadoes (now in the American Association) from Piggy Simandl, changed the team&#x27;s name to Bears and stocked with talent that did not make the Chicago roster. He used the club to incubate talent and for easy return for injured players, thus making it pro football&#x27;s first true farm team. Newark&#x27;s most notable names included Joe Zeller as coach and Gene Ronzani who led them to the 1939 championship (with a little help in the playoff from Sid Luckman). Halas folded the team in 1941, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor ushered in the United States’ participation in World War II. It would later be revived for one more season (1946) as the Newark Bombers under Halas ownership (not as a farm team), but was folded altogether at the end of the season, and was substituted by the Bloomfield Cardinals.

===Akron Bears===
In 1946, after he returned from service in World War II, Halas also launched the Akron Bears of the American Football League as the Chicago Bears&#x27; minor league affiliate. The launch was an attempt to interfere with the territorial rights of the Cleveland Browns, a team in the NFL rival All-America Football Conference (AAFC); Akron is located just 30 miles from Cleveland.

The team was coached again by Ronzani and had notable players like quarterback George Gulyanics, Ed Ecker, Lloyd Reese, Raymond Schumacher and Jack Karwales. The Bears were successful on the field—including reaching the league final before losing 14–13 to the Jersey City Giants—but lost at the box office a sum of $52,000, partly because they had large traveling expenses as most of the league team were located on the East Coast. The team did not return for a second season.

===Legacy===
A pioneer both on and off the field, Halas made the Bears the first team to hold daily practice sessions, to analyze film of opponents to find weaknesses and means of attack, place assistant coaches in the press box during games, place tarp on the field, publish a club newspaper, and to broadcast games by radio. He also offered to share the team&#x27;s substantial television income with teams in smaller cities, firmly believing that what was good for the league would ultimately benefit his own team. A firm disciplinarian, Halas maintained complete control of his team and did not tolerate disobedience and insubordination by players. He also insisted on absolute integrity and honesty in management, believing that a handshake was sufficient to finalize a deal; few, if any, intermediaries were necessary.

Halas&#x27;s career ledger reads as follows: 63 years as an owner, 40 as a coach, 324 wins, and 8 NFL titles as a coach or owner. His 324 victories as a head coach stood as an NFL record for nearly three decades until 1993 when Don Shula broke the record with his 325th win. Halas&#x27;s 324 wins are still far and away the most in Bears history; they are three times that of runner-up Mike Ditka. He was a charter member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963.

===Honors===
In both 1963 and 1965, Halas was selected by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, the AP and the UPI as the NFL Coach of the Year. In 1997, he was featured on a U.S. postage stamp as one of the legendary coaches of football. He has been recognized by ESPN as one of the ten most influential people in sports in the 20th century, and as one of the greatest coaches. In 1993, Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula finally surpassed Halas&#x27; victory total. From the 1984 season onward to this day, the jerseys of the Chicago Bears bear the initials &quot;GSH&quot; on their upper left sleeves in commemoration of Halas. In 1956, Halas was awarded the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award, which is the Navy&#x27;s highest civilian award.

There are two extant awards named for Halas: the George Halas Trophy (awarded by the NFL to the National Football Conference champion) and the George S. Halas Courage Award (Pro Football Writers Association). From 1966 to 1996, a George Halas Trophy was also awarded to the NFL defensive player of the year by the Newspaper Enterprise Association. The Chicago Bears retired number 7 in his honor, and the Pro Football Hall of Fame is located on George Halas Drive.

The University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign inducted Halas into the Engineering Hall of Fame in 2016.

The Bears erected a statue and marker dedicated to Halas in 2019 near the south entrance to Soldier Field.

==Basketball career==
===Chicago Bruins===
In 1925, Halas tipped his hand in pro basketball when he helped to create the first professional basketball league in the United States – the American Basketball League – as the owner of the Chicago Bruins. The team played six seasons before folding following the 1930–31 season because of the Great Depression.

The Bruins struggled during their existence, failing to reach the playoffs in every season, but featured several notable names, including two Hall of Famers in player-coach Honey Russell and Nat Holman who played for half a season in 1926. Other notable players included Bears quarterback Laurie Walquist, Robert J. Dunne, Slim Shoun and Chicago Cardinals back Ike Mahoney.

Halas revived the team for four more seasons, 1939 to 1942, and played in the National Basketball League (NBL) and in the World Professional Basketball Tournament. The Bruins were more successful this time, reaching the World Professional Basketball Tournament finals in 1940, losing to the Harlem Globetrotters 31–29. Notable players were Wibs Kautz, Bill Hapac and Ralph Vaughn. In their second incarnation, the team played in the Chicago Coliseum.

==Military career==
===World War I===
Halas served as an ensign in the United States Navy during World War I.

===World War II===
Halas entered the United States Navy again after the advent of World War II in 1942, with the rank of lieutenant commander. He served overseas for 20 months under the command of Admiral Chester Nimitz. His duties were supporting the welfare and recreational activities of the Seventh Fleet. He was awarded the Bronze Star during his recall and was released from duty in 1946 with the rank of captain.

==Later life after football==
After the 1967 season, Halas—then the oldest coach in league history—retired as coach. He continued as the team&#x27;s principal owner for the rest of his life. Although he nominally ceded the general manager&#x27;s post in 1963, he continued to make the franchise&#x27;s football decisions until hiring Jim Finks as general manager in 1974. He continued to take an active role in team operations until his death. He was honored in 1970 and 1980 as the only person involved in the league throughout its first 50 and 60 years of existence. His son George, Jr. served as president of the Bears from 1963 until his sudden death at age 54 in 1979. One of Halas&#x27;s final significant ownership acts was to hire Mike Ditka as head coach in 1982 (Ditka had been a Halas player in the 1960s). He had won 6 NFL championships before retiring.

In the 1971 made-for-television film &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot;, about the friendship between Chicago Bears players Brian Piccolo and Gale Sayers, Halas was portrayed by Jack Warden, who won an Emmy Award for his performance.

==Death==
Halas died of pancreatic cancer in Chicago on October 31, 1983, at age 88, and is entombed in St. Adalbert Catholic Cemetery in Niles, Illinois. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving participant of the meeting that formed the NFL in 1920.

His eldest daughter, Virginia Halas McCaskey, succeeded him as majority owner until her death in 2025. Her son Michael McCaskey served as team president from 1983 to 1999 at which time the elder McCaskey was forced to fire her own son. In the 1985 season when the Bears won their only Super Bowl (and post-merger NFL championship), they recorded a song called &quot;Super Bowl Shuffle.&quot; In the song, backup quarterback Steve Fuller rhymes &quot;Bring on Atlanta, Bring on Dallas / This is for Mike [then-current coach Mike Ditka] and Papa Bear Halas.&quot;

Super Bowl XVIII was dedicated to Halas. The pregame ceremonies featured a moment of silence and the ceremonial coin toss by former Chicago Bear Bronko Nagurski, the latter of which was previously performed by Halas for Super Bowl XIII. The missing-man formation over Tampa Stadium, performed by airplanes from MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida at the conclusion of Barry Manilow&#x27;s performance of the National Anthem, was also presented in tribute to Halas.

<doc id="634867" wikidata="Q6053211" url="?curid=634867" title="International Simultaneous Policy Organization">
<text>The International Simultaneous Policy Organisation (ISPO) is a voluntary organization that promotes the Simultaneous Policy (Simpol) campaign. It was founded by British businessman, John Bunzl, in 2000.

== Description ==

The ISPO describes itself as &quot;a growing association of citizens world-wide who aim to use their votes in a new, co-ordinated and effective way to drive all nations to co-operate in solving our planetary crisis&quot;. It believes that transnational citizen action is vital because &quot;global markets and multinational corporations so comprehensively overpower individual nations that no politician dares make the first move to solve global problems for fear of competitive disadvantage&quot;.

ISPO aims to overcomes this paralysis by bringing all nations to adopt in principle - and then to simultaneously implement - the Simultaneous Policy (Simpol), a range of democratically formulated regulations to bring about economic justice, environmental security and peace around the world.

By supporting Simpol, ISPO&#x27;s citizen-members pledge to vote in future elections for ANY political party or candidate - within reason - that has signed a pledge to implement Simpol&#x27;s range of measures only when all or sufficient other governments have also signed. ISPO argues that, as more and more citizens act in this way, politicians will have no choice but to sign the Pledge if they wish to remain in office, or else they risk losing their seats to other politicians who have adopted it. One of its slogans is &quot;Use Your Vote to Take Back the World!&quot;

==What is &quot;Simultaneous Policy&quot;?==
Simultaneous policy requires governments in all jurisdictions at once, worldwide, to implement a policy shift at once, so that none is disadvantaged or unfairly advantaged.

The idea of the need for simultaneity of sovereign state action is not itself a new idea - it is the basis of treaty and United Nations initiatives that nothing can be done on certain problems, such as disarmament, until all major players agree to a common timetable of implementing solutions.

However, according to the process offered by ISPO, what appears to be new is that citizens who &quot;adopt&quot; the Simultaneous Policy (Simpol) take the formulation of global policy into their own hands. Furthermore, according to ISPO, their adoption of Simpol represents their pledge to vote in future elections, not for a &quot;particular&quot; politician or political party, but for ANY politician or party - within reason - that pledges to implement Simpol&#x27;s package of policies alongside other governments. With more and more parliamentary seats and even entire elections increasingly being won or lost on very small margins, a relatively small number of Simpol adopters have the opportunity, ISPO claims, to make it in the strong interests of all politicians and parties to pledge to implement Simpol&#x27;s policy package while also making it potentially disastrous for them if they fail to do so. As such, ISPO claims that civil society, through its adoption of Simpol, can for the first time lead governments, rather than governments leading the people.

The International Labour Organization and GlobalGreens both recommend certain simultaneous policy initiatives, and closer coordination of their members in many nations. Such cooperation is seen as a way to work within a competitive global market economy without disadvantaging the most &#x27;progressive&#x27; players who strongly protect ecology and the worker.

Simultaneous initiatives are seen as a way to avoid Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma type problems, wherein there is a strong reward for defecting, and a risk for going along with a proposed plan if there is even one defector.

Another example problem of this nature is agricultural subsidies to domestic farmers. A nation abolishing such subsidies stands to lose much of its family farm infrastructure to cheap imports unless a simultaneous initiative in another country, or in tax, tariff and trade to make up for lost subsidies, takes place. As this example suggests, the policies that are put in place simultaneously may be more complex than initially realized, and may require the cooperation of multiple branches or levels of government within one country, in addition to global cooperation.

== Diversity of Support ==
Individuals and politicians who have adopted ISPO&#x27;s simultaneous policy have come from all parts of the political spectrum.

&quot;SP provides a global regulatory and governance framework within which global free markets can operate freely, fairly, and within sustainable environmental limits.&quot; John Bunzl.

== Scope ==

The Simultaneous Policy presently has campaigns running in twenty seven countries:

Australia,
Austria,
Bangladesh,
Belgium,
Brazil,
Cameroon,
Canada,
Denmark,
East Africa region,
Germany,
Hungary,
Iceland,
India,
Ireland,
Italy,
Luxembourg,
Mali,
Malta,
Nepal,
New Zealand,
Nigeria,
Pakistan,
Spain,
Sweden,
Switzerland,
United Kingdom and
Uruguay

As the United Kingdom was first to campaign it has more politicians who have signed the pledge. These politicians come from across the political spectrum:

* Conservative Party: Philip Hollobone MP (2006), John Penrose MP (2005), Henry Smith MP (2010)
* Green Party: Caroline Lucas MP (2004)
* Labour: Roger Godsiff MP (2007), John McDonnell MP (2005), Catherine McKinnell MP (2010), Grahame Morris MP (2010)
* Liberal Democrat: Tom Brake MP (2007), Annette Brooke MP (2010), Lorely Jane Burt MP (2006), Mike Crockart MP (2010), Lynne Featherstone MP (2006), Don Foster MP (2006), Duncan Hames MP (2005), Andrew George MP (2004), Mike Hancock MP (2004), Martin Horwood MP (2007), John Leech MP (2010), Stephen Lloyd MP (2010), Adrian Sanders MP (2005), Mark Williams MP (2006)
* Plaid Cymru: Elfyn Llwyd MP (2010)

Individuals who have signed but are no longer MPs are: Conservative Party: Sir Richard Body; Labour: Celia Barlow, Tony Benn; Liberal Democrat: Lembit Öpik, John Hemming&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;In addition, there exists a growing number of Simpol partner organisations that support the democratic aims and principles of the Simultaneous Policy. These include the Canadian Action Party and the Global Justice Movement.

The Australian Federal Election of October 2004 saw 59 candidates pledge their support for Simpol.

In the UK 200+ candidates for the elections of 2010 pledged to implement the Simultaneous Policy, of whom 24 were elected as MPs. Former President of East Timor José Ramos-Horta has pledged his support for the policy.

<text>The Mouth of Truth ( ) is an ancient Roman marble mask in Rome, Italy, which stands against the left wall of the portico of the Santa Maria in Cosmedin church, at the Piazza della Bocca della Verità, the site of the ancient Forum Boarium (the ancient cattle market). According to an enduring medieval legend, it will bite off the hand of any liar who places their hand in its mouth, or, alternatively, any who utters a lie while their hand is in the mouth. It still attracts many visitors who insert their hands.
The massive marble mask weighs about and probably depicts the face of the sea titan god Oceanus. The eyes, nostrils and mouth are open. Historians are not quite certain what the original purpose of the disc was. It was possibly used as a drain cover in the nearby Temple of Hercules Victor, which had an oculus (a round open space in the middle of the roof) similar to that of the Pantheon. Hence, it could rain inside. It is also thought that cattle merchants used it to drain the blood of cattle sacrificed to the demi-god Hercules.

In the 13th century the disc was probably removed from the temple and placed against the wall of the Santa Maria in Cosmedin. In the 17th century it eventually moved to its current location inside the portico of the church.

==Cultural references and derivative works==

The Mouth of Truth has been featured as a theme in historical European art. Lucas Cranach the Elder, a German painter during the Renaissance period, created two paintings depicting a woman placing her hand in the mouth of a statue of a lion while onlookers watched, a subject which was drawn by Albrecht Altdorfer and made into a woodcut by the Dutch printmaker Lucas van Leyden.

The Mouth of Truth appears in the 1953 film &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; as a storytelling device as Hepburn&#x27;s and Peck&#x27;s characters are not truthful with each other. In by Dutch writer Rindert Kromhout, the fingers of lying children are cut off with a scythe by a skeleton who lives in the Capuchin Crypt in the Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini. Additionally, it was featured in episode 14 of the first season of the anime &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;.

There are a number of replicas and derivative works. A full-size reproduction sits in the Alta Vista Gardens in California and one of Jules Blanchard&#x27;s sculptures in the Luxembourg Garden in Paris depicts a woman with her hand in the sculpture&#x27;s mouth. Coin-operated fortune teller machines have been developed and installed in different parts of the world, including one on display in the Musée Mécanique in San Francisco.

<text>The School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University (Museum School, SMFA at Tufts, or SMFA; formerly the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) is the art school of Tufts University, a private research university in Boston, Massachusetts. It offers undergraduate and graduate degrees dedicated to the visual arts.

It is affiliated with the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. SMFA is also a member of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD), a consortium of several dozen leading art schools in the United States. The school is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design.

== History ==
The school was founded in 1876 under the name School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (SMFA). From 1876 to 1909, the school was housed in the basement of the original Museum building in Copley Square. When the Museum moved to Huntington Avenue in 1909, the School moved into a separate, temporary structure to the west of the main building. The permanent building, designed by Guy Lowell, was completed in 1927. The red brick building provided improved classroom, studio and library facilities.

In 1945 the Museum School and Tufts College collaborated to develop their first joint degree teacher training granting program. The creation of additional programs between the two institutions followed soon after.

In 1987, a newly renovated and expanded school building, designed by architect Graham Gund, more than doubled the size of the existing structure and provided an auditorium, enlarged library, expanded studios and classrooms, a spacious new entrance, cafeteria, and increased gallery and exhibition spaces. Gund&#x27;s expansion included the central atrium, known as the Katherine Lane Weems Atrium, that connects the two buildings.

In December 2015, it was announced that the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston would become a part of Tufts University and on June 30, 2016 the integration was completed.
With the late-2022 opening of the Green Line Extension of the MBTA Green Line E branch light rail transit route, there is a direct connection between the SMFA Campus and the main campus of Tufts University in Medford.

== Academics ==
Encouraged to build an individual program of interdisciplinary study, students are not asked to declare a major, but by choosing among in-depth courses in a dozen disciplines and mediums, students are free to concentrate in the areas that best align with their interests. Courses are offered in the following areas: animation,
ceramics, digital media, drawing, film and video, graphic arts, installation, metals, painting, performance, photography, print and paper, sculpture, sound, virtual reality, and visual and material studies.

One of the unique attributes of SMFA is that students are required to participate in a &quot;Review Board&quot; which is a review of all of the art work that a student has done during the semester. Review Boards are led by two faculty members and two fellow students. There are many opportunities for students to exhibit their artwork at both the main building and the Mission Hill building.

Opportunities to exhibit works include the annual Art Sale and the juried &quot;Student Annual Exhibition&quot;. Various galleries and spaces that are available to students around the school buildings include Bag Gallery, Hallway Gallery, Bathroom Gallery, Underground Gallery, as well as the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

The school&#x27;s main campus building, 230 the Fenway, is adjacent to and just to the west of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Most classroom space is located, as well as the SMFA Cafe, the W. Van Alan Clark, Jr. Library, the School&#x27;s Art Store, and the Grossman Gallery, which is part of the Tufts University Art Galleries&#x27; exhibition space. The Mission Hill building, located about a quarter mile from the main building, recently has been renovated and includes studio spaces for graduate and post-baccalaureate students as well as classrooms, workshops, and the Writing Center.

== W. Van Alan Clark, Jr. Library ==
The Clark Library at SMFA is the fine arts branch of Tufts University&#x27;s Tisch Library. According to its website, the Clark Library collection&#x27;s contents focus heavily &quot;on contemporary art and studio practice&quot;.
