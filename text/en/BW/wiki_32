<text>Bodymind is an approach to understand the relationship between the human body and mind where they are seen as a single integrated unit. It attempts to address the mind–body problem and resists the Western traditions of mind–body dualism. 

== Dualism vs holism ==
In the field of philosophy, the theory of dualism is the speculation that the mental and the physical parts of us, like our minds and our bodies, are different or separate.

== Modern understanding ==
&quot;The mind is composed of mental fragments- sensations, feelings, thoughts, imaginations, all flowing now in an ordered sequence, now in a chaotic fashion…. On the other hand, the body is constructed under the underlying laws of physics, and its components obey the well-enumerated laws of physiology. It is these characteristic differences between these two – between mind and body – that lead to the Mind-Body problem.&quot;. While Western populations tend to believe more in the idea of dualism, there is also good research on the neurophysiology of emotions and their foundation in human meaning-making and mental function, such as the research of Candace Pert.

==Relevance to alternative medicine==
In the field of alternative medicine, bodymind implies that 
* The body, mind, emotions, and spirit are dynamically interrelated.
* Experience, including physical stress, emotional injury, and pleasures are stored in the body&#x27;s cells which in turn affects one&#x27;s reactions to stimuli.
The term can be a number of disciplines, including:
* Psychoneuroimmunology, the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body.
* Body psychotherapy, a branch of psychotherapy which applies basic principles of somatic psychology. It originated in the work of Pierre Janet and particularly Wilhelm Reich.
* Neurobiology, the study of the nervous system
* Psychosomatic medicine, an interdisciplinary medical field exploring the relationships among social, psychological, and behavioral factors on bodily processes and quality of life in humans and animals. Clinical situations where mental processes act as a major factor affecting medical outcomes are areas where psychosomatic medicine excels.
* Postural Integration, a process-oriented body psychotherapy originally developed in the late 1960s by Jack Painter (1933–2010) in California, US, after exploration in the fields of humanistic psychology and the human potential movement. The method aims to support personal change and self development, through a particular form of manipulative holistic bodywork.

<doc id="641058" wikidata="Q4520" url="?curid=641058" title="Komodo National Park">
<text>Komodo National Park (Indonesian: &quot;Taman Nasional Komodo&quot;) is a national park in Indonesia located within the Lesser Sunda Islands in the border region between the provinces of East Nusa Tenggara and West Nusa Tenggara. The park includes the three larger islands Komodo, Padar and Rinca, and 26 smaller ones, with a total area of 1,733 km2 (603 km2 of it land). The national park was founded in 1980 to protect the Komodo dragon, the world&#x27;s largest lizard. Later it was dedicated to protecting other species, including marine species. In 1991 the national park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a Man and Biosphere Reserve. It is considered one of the world&#x27;s 25 biodiversity hotspots.

Komodo National Park has been selected as one of the New 7 Wonders of Nature. The waters surrounding Komodo island contain rich marine biodiversity. Komodo islands is also a part of the Coral Triangle, which contains some of the richest marine biodiversity on Earth.

It is also a WWF Global 200 Marine Eco-region, a WWF/IUCN Centre of Plant Diversity, one of the world&#x27;s Endemic Bird Areas and an ASEAN Heritage Park.

==History==
The island of Padar and part of Rinca were established as nature reserves in 1938. 

Komodo Island was declared a nature reserve in 1965, and in January 1977 as a biosphere reserve under the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Reserve Programme.

In 1980 the islands of Komodo, Padar, Rinca and Gili Motong and the surrounding waters were declared a national park, for a total of 75,000 ha.

In 1984 the national park was extended to 219,322 ha in order to include the marine area Mbeliling / Ngorang (31,000 ha), and Wae Wuul / Mburak Recreation Parks (3,000 ha) on mainland Flores. The marine zone covers 60% of the national park area.

In 1991 the national park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

In 2005 it was designated an ASEAN Heritage Park.

The park was initially established to conserve the unique Komodo dragon (&quot;Varanus komodoensis&quot;), first discovered by the scientific world in 1912 through Lieutenant J. K. H. van Steyn van Hensbroek, the Civil Administrator in Reo, Flores Island. Since then conservation goals have expanded to protecting the entire biodiversity of the region, both marine and terrestrial.

It is considered one of the world&#x27;s 25 biodiversity hotspots - a Conservation International designation. It is also one of the WWF Global 200 Marine Eco-regions, a UNESCO Man and Biosphere Reserve, a WWF/IUCN Centre of Plant Diversity and one of the world&#x27;s Endemic Bird Areas.

==Geography and climate==

The park comprises a coastal section of western Flores, the three larger islands of Komodo, Padar and Rinca, 26 smaller islands and the surrounding waters of the Sape Straights. The islands of the national park are of volcanic origin. The terrain is generally rugged, characterized by rounded hills, with altitudes up to 735 m. The climate is one of the driest of Indonesia with annual rainfall between 800mm and 1000mm. Harsh daily temperatures in the dry season from May to October are around 40 °C.

== Human settlements ==
=== Population history ===
Little is known of the early history of the Komodo islanders. They were subjects of the Sultanate of Bima, although the island&#x27;s remoteness from Bima meant its affairs were probably little troubled by the Sultanate other than by occasional demands for tribute. &lt;br&gt;
The majority of the people in and around the park are fishermen originally from Bima (Sumbawa), Manggarai, South Flores, and South Sulawesi. Those from South Sulawesi are from the Suku Bajau or Bugis ethnic groups. The Suku Bajau were originally nomadic and moved from location to location in the region of Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara and Maluku, to make a living. Descendants of the original people of Komodo, the Ata Modo, still live in Komodo, but there are no pure blood people left and their culture and language is slowly being integrated with the recent migrants.

The human population within the park spread out over four settlements (Komodo, Rinca, Kerora, and Papagaran), all of which existed before 1980 when the area was declared a national park. In 1928 there were only 30 people living in Komodo Village (known locally as &quot;Kampung Komodo&quot;), and approximately 250 people on Rinca Island in 1930. The population increased rapidly, and by 1999, there were 281 families numbering 1,169 people on Komodo Island. 
Komodo Village has had the highest population within the park, mostly due to migration by people from Sape, Manggarai, Madura, and South Sulawesi. The number of buildings in Komodo Village has increased rapidly from 30 houses in 1958, to 194 houses in 1994, and 270 houses in 2000. Papagaran Village is similar in size, with 258 families totaling 1,078 people.
At the 2010 Census, Komodo Village had 1,508 inhabitants and Papagaran Village had 1,262 inhabitants.
As of 1999, Rinca&#x27;s population was 835, and Kerora&#x27;s population was 185 people.

In 2004, the total population living in the park was 3,267 people while 16,816 people lived in the area immediately surrounding the park.

=== Economy ===
As of 2007, 97% of the people living within the park rely on marine resources as their only source of income. They are pauperised by the restrictions on access to resources coupled with rising costs of living, a growing population and the lack of sustainable livelihood alternatives, all of which increasing the pressure on resources.

; Tourism revenue and local communities

Locally, tourism has become a major industry since the late 1980s and the 1990s; but this development brought little benefit to the local communities within the park. Not only this industry is mainly based outside the park in Labuan Bajo; moreover most of the benefits thusly generated are leaked outside the region to large national or international tourism operators.

===Education===
The average level of education in the villages of Komodo National Park is grade four of elementary school. There is an elementary school located in each of the villages but new students are not admitted each year. On average, each village has four classes and four teachers. Most of the children from the small islands in the Kecamatan Komodo (Komodo, Rinca, Kerora, Papagaran, Mesa) do not finish elementary school. Less than 10% of those who do graduate from elementary school continue to high school since the major economic opportunity (fishing) does not require further education. Children must be sent to Labuan Bajo to attend high school, but this is rarely done in fishermen&#x27;s families.

===Health===
Most of the villages located in and around the park have few fresh water facilities available, if any, particularly during the dry season. Water quality declines during this time period and many people become ill. Businesses also take up large amounts of water for tourism uses, often getting a lower per-unit cost , then locals. Malaria and diarrhea are rampant in the area. On Messah island, with a population of 1,969 people, there is no fresh water available. Fresh water has to be brought in jerrycans by boat from the mainland. The cost for each family for fresh water is Rp100,000 per month. Almost every village has a local medical facility with staff, and at least a paramedic. The quality of medical care facilities is low.

===Socio-cultural and anthropologic conditions===
Traditional communities in Komodo, Flores and Sumbawa have been subjected to outside influences and the influence of traditional customs is dwindling. Television, radio, and increased mobility have all played a part in accelerating the rate of change. There has been a steady influx of migrants into the area. At the moment nearly all villages consist of more than one ethnic group.

===Religion===
The Manggarai are mostly Christians. The majority of fishermen living in the villages in the vicinity of the park are Muslims. Hajis have a strong influence in the dynamics of community development. Fishermen hailing from South Sulawesi (Bajau, Bugis) and Bima are mostly Muslims.

===Anthropology and language===
There are several cultural sites within the park, particularly on Komodo Island. These sites are not well documented, however, and there are many questions concerning the history of human inhabitance on the island. Outside the park, in Warloka village on Flores, there is a Chinese trading post remnant of some interest. Archeological finds from this site have been looted in the recent past. Most communities in and around the park can speak Indonesian. Bajo language is the language used for daily communication in most communities.

==Flora and fauna==
The hot and dry climate of the park, characterized by savannah vegetation, makes it a good habitat for the endemic Komodo dragon (&quot;Varanus komodoensis&quot;). Their populations are restricted to the islands of Komodo (1,700), Rinca (1,300), Gili Motang (100), Gili Dasami (100), and Flores (c. 2,000), while extinct on Padar.

Cloud forests appear only in few areas above 500 metres but they provide habitat to several endemic flora. Coastal vegetation includes mangrove forest, which generally appear in the sheltered bays of the three larger islands.

Fringing and patch coral reefs are extensive and best developed on the north-east coast of Komodo. The park is rich in marine life, including whale sharks, ocean sunfish, manta rays, eagle rays, pygmy seahorse, false pipefish, clown frogfish, nudibranchs, blue-ringed octopus, sponges, tunicates, and coral.

Varieties of cetaceans inhabit in adjacent waters from smaller sized dolphins to sperm whales and even blue whales. Omura&#x27;s whales, one of the least known of rorquals have been confirmed to range waters within the park. Endangered dugongs still live in Komodo areas as well.

The terrestrial fauna is of rather poor diversity in comparison to the marine fauna. The number of terrestrial animal species found in the park is not high, but the area is important from a conservation perspective as some species are endemic. Many of the mammals are Asiatic in origin, including the rusa deer, wild boar, water buffalo, crab-eating macaque and civet. Several of the reptiles and birds are Australian in origin, such as the orange-footed scrubfowl, the lesser sulphur crested cockatoo, and the helmeted friarbird.

The most famous of Komodo National Park&#x27;s reptiles is the Komodo dragon (&quot;Varanus komodoensis&quot;). It is the world&#x27;s largest lizard and is among the world&#x27;s largest reptiles; the females can reach a length of 2 to 2.5 m (6.6-8 ft) and a 70 kg weight, the males a length of 3 m (10 ft) and up to 136 kg (300 lb) weight, but the average is respectively of weight for a length and weight for a length.

Twelve terrestrial snake species are found on the island in addition to marine species. Snakes include the Javan spitting cobra (&quot;Naja sputatrix&quot;), Russell&#x27;s viper (&quot;Daboia russelii&quot;), white-lipped pit viper (&quot;Trimeresurus albolabris&quot;), blue lipped sea krait (&quot;Laticauda laticaudata&quot;), and Timor python (&quot;Python timoriensis&quot;). Lizards include nine skink species (Scinidae), geckos (Gekkonidae), limbless lizards (Dibamidae), and the monitor lizards such as the Komodo dragon (Varanidae). Frogs include the Asian bullfrog (&quot;Kaloula baleata&quot;), the endemic Komodo cross frog (&quot;Oreophryne jeffersoniana&quot;) and &quot;Oreophryne darewskyi&quot;. Frogs are typically found at higher, moister altitudes. The saltwater crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus porosus&quot;) was once present within the park in coastal areas including mangrove swamps but is now extinct within the area.

Mammals found within the park include the Timor rusa deer (&quot;Cervus timorensis&quot;), the main prey of the Komodo dragon, horses (&quot;Equus&quot; sp.), water buffalo (&quot;Bubalus bubalis&quot;), wild boar (&quot;Sus scrofa vittatus&quot;), crab-eating macaque (&quot;Macaca fascicularis&quot;), Asian palm civet (&quot;Paradoxurus hermaphroditus lehmanni&quot;), the endemic Rinca rat (&quot;Rattus rintjanus&quot;), and fruit bats. Domestic mammals on within the park include goats, cats and dogs which are feral.

One of the main bird species is the orange-footed scrubfowl (&quot;Megapodius reinwardti&quot;), a ground dwelling bird. In areas of savanna, 27 species were observed. The zebra dove (&quot;Geopelia striata&quot;) and spotted dove (&quot;Spilopelia chinensis&quot;) were the most common species. In mixed tropical deciduous habitat, 28 bird species were observed, and helmeted friarbird (&quot;Philemon buceroides&quot;), green imperial pigeon (&quot;Ducula aenea&quot;), and lemon-bellied white-eye (&quot;Zosterops chloris&quot;) were the most common. Other birds include vibrantly coloured species such as green junglefowl (&quot;Gallus varius&quot;), great-billed parrot (&quot;Tanygnathus megalorynchos&quot;), and the critically endangered lesser sulpher crested cockatoo (&quot;Cacatua sulphurea&quot;). Two eagle species are found in the park, the white-bellied sea eagle and the extremely rare Flores hawk-eagle which is present on Rinca and Flores and reported but unconfirmed on Komodo Island.

== Management ==

Komodo National Park (KNP) was set up as a Technical Implementation Unit of the Directorate-General of Forest Protection and Nature Conservation (PHKA), of the Ministry of Forestry. Its management is headed by the Komodo National Park Authority, in West Flores. Also in West Flores - but as a separate unit - is the Directorship of Conservation Areas. The Nature Conservancy (TNC, an American environmental organization), is director for the Coastal and Marine Program.

The Nature Conservancy entered into a partnership with the Department of Forestry and Conservation (&quot;Perlindungan Hutan dan Pelastrian Alam&quot;/PHPA) in 1995, to manage the Komodo National Park for 25 years. 

A management plan was co-authored with TNC and implemented in 2000 to address problem of increasing resource exploitation, both marine and terrestrial. The plan was supported by the World Bank but faced objections from some local people and local NGOs who argued that they had not been consulted by the plan and would not share in the benefits. Most pressure on marine resources originates from fishing communities and commercial enterprises from outside the park. However, regulations and restrictions on resource use impact mostly on park residents, who have few options to make a living but rely on what the park has to offer. The provision of alternative livelihoods is part of the overall management strategy, but communities within the park are yet to benefit from appropriate measures addressing their needs.

A non-profit joint venture company, &quot;PT Putri Naga Komodo&quot; (PT PNK), was established to operate tourist facilities in the hope of eventually making the park financially self-sustaining. PT PNK was partially funded by the TNC and the World Bank. After 5 years operation, in 2010 Putri Naga Komodo&#x27;s (PNK) permit was compromised. After that, more illegal fishermen arrived as enforcement declined greatly following the exit of TNC which had helped fight destructive fishing practices. In early 2012, dive operators and conservationists found many desolate coral sites, reminiscent of grey moonscapes. Illegal fishermen continue to blast sites with &#x27;bombs&#x27; in a process known as blast fishing. The fisherman use a mixture of fertilizer and kerosene in beer bottles as explosives, or use squeeze bottles to squirt cyanide into the coral in order to stun and capture fish. In the past two years more than 60 illegal fishermen have been arrested. One of the suspects was shot and killed after he tried to evade capture by throwing fish bombs at the rangers.

Park managers have been conducting demographic status of the current living Komodo dragon populations across Komodo National Park. Komodo National Park contains five islands that inhabit Komodo dragons populations which hold the most desirable resources for the protected species. Two of the large islands, Komodo and Rinca, hold two of the largest populations on the island with three smaller ones being Padar, Gili Motang, and Nusa Kode. To help increase the population of Komodo dragons in the park, habitat management focuses on maintaining the environments on Komodo Island like the savannah grasslands and forests. This increases the population of prey species like the Timor deer for the Komodo by maintaining the favored habitat. The results of the two populations here have shown to have almost stable or stable time average population growth rates. Conservation efforts on smaller islands have increased due to having smaller populations, which have increased extinction rates.

=== Conflicts between conservation authorities and local community ===
Controversy surrounds the death of several fishermen since the 1980s. The circumstances of the fishermen&#x27;s deaths are contested. While park patrols (including, at the time, police and navy personnel) claim they acted in self-defense, fishing communities accuse park management of having deliberately killed the fishermen.

In late February 2014, Brimob Special Police shot dead two deer poachers, when they opened fire with their homemade firearms.

==Tourism==
Scuba diving is popular because of the park&#x27;s high marine biodiversity. Six well-known diving sites are Manta Alley, Crystal Rock and Castle Rock, Batu Bolong, Yellow Wall, the Cauldron and Tatawa Besar.

The development of ecotourism, largely marine-based, is the main strategy to make the park self-financing and generate sufficient revenue through entrance fees and tourism licenses to cover operational and managerial costs. To this end, a joint venture between TNC and a tourism operator were granted a tourism concession, that also entails extensive park management rights. This concession has generated an ongoing controversy. The joint venture has been accused of making decisions behind closed doors, and many people in and around Komodo claim that they have not been consulted regarding decisions that ultimately affect their lives. The growth of the tourism sector has also led to extensive land grabbing in the areas surrounding the park as poorer people sell their lands to foreign business investors.

Komodo Island and Rinca were once part of Flores and they are separated from the large Island of Sumbawa to the West by the Sape Strait. The ocean in the Strait drops hundreds of meters. The Pacific Ocean to the north and the Indian Ocean to the south are actually at different heights – so the flow of currents from the Pacific to the Indian during tidal exchanges makes the currents among the strongest in the world. In the (relatively) shallow waters along the east coast of Komodo towards Labuan Bajo, these currents can be extremely dangerous with inexperienced guides.

The number of visitors to the park increased from 36,000 in 2009 to 45,000 in 2010. Most of the visitors were foreign tourists as the high transport cost to this remote location is less affordable for local visitors. The park can accommodate up to 60,000 visitors a year according to the local tourism agency.

Several types of boat tours run through the national park including upscale scuba liveaboards, short daily snorkel trips and 4 day, 3 night &#x27;tourist boats&#x27; between Lombok and Flores. The tourist boats run very frequently, but have uncertain safety records. In an August 2014 incident one of these tourist boats sank, and 2 tourists were lost. Strong currents and waves separated the stranded passengers and crew who were floating at sea in life jackets.

Impact on local people

The Indonesian government&#x27;s tourism development has focused on making Komodo National Park a &quot;super-premium tourist destination” (since 2019), to attract wealthier visitors. This has resulted in zoning changes which reduce land access to local people and have resulted in deforestation.  Additionally, the government’s policy supports corporate tourist organizations, as a way to help develop the “super-premium tourist destination” status. One of the local tribes the Ata Modo, has deep cultural ties with the Komodo dragon, with one myth even stating they are twins. The tribe has tried establishing local culturally relevant tourist options, leaning into their connection with the Komodo dragon as a way to compete with foreign tourism operators. In 2019, the governor of the East Nusa Tenggara province, made a press announcement, about relocating indigenous people from Komodo Island to some of the surrounding areas, which was met with large protests by the local people. As of 2021, the government has seemed to back down from this claim.

Closure of the park

In early 2019, the Nusa Tenggara Timor (NTT) provincial governor Viktor Laiskodat announced a plan to close a section of the park (a main section on Komodo Island) for a year in order to make improvements. The suggestion was that other parts of the park, including Rinca and Padar Islands and certain parts of Komodo Island, would remain open. The governor&#x27;s plan met with opposition from the local community and some parts of the wider public. In response, the Indonesian Environment and Forestry Minister, Siti Nurbaya said that she would summon representatives from the NTT administration for discussions, noting that decisions about conservation areas were under the jurisdiction of the central government. A final decision about the proposed closure was expected to be announced by the central government around mid-2019.

In July 2019, it was confirmed that Komodo Island would be closed for around one year from the beginning of 2020. Governor Laiskodat said that a budget of Rp 100 billion (around $US 7.2 million) would be provided to support the conservation program. The plan is controversial: Governor Laiskodat has suggested that an expensive entrance fee be charged to foreign tourists while local villagers who live on Komodo Island are worried about the possible loss of income. The park was closed for almost six months because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but was reopened to local tourists on 6 July 2020, then to domestic tourists in August 2020 and subsequently to foreign tourists. In December 2022, it was confirmed that the planned controversial increase in entrance fees, which had already been postponed by 5 months, was being canceled by the Indonesian government.

Periodic closures of the park are expected to take place in mid-2025, to help ease the strain on the park&#x27;s fragile ecosystem.

<text>Alois Hába (21 June 1893 – 18 November 1973) was a Czech composer, music theorist and teacher. He belongs to the important discoverers in modern classical music, and to the major composers of microtonal music, especially using the quarter-tone scale, though he used others such as sixth-tones (e.g., in the 5th, 10th and 11th String Quartets), fifth-tones (Sixteenth String Quartet), and twelfth-tones. From the other microtonal conceptions, he discussed a &quot;three-quarter tone&quot; system (see three-quarter tone flat and the neutral second) in his theoretical works but he used scales in this tuning in sections of some of his compositions. In his prolific career, Hába composed three operas, an enormous collection of chamber music including 16 string quartets, piano, organ and choral pieces, some orchestral works and songs. He also had special keyboard and woodwind instruments constructed that were capable of playing quarter-tone scales.

== Life ==

Alois Hába was born in the small town of Vizovice in Moravian Wallachia, into a family of 10 children. When he was five years old it was discovered that he had absolute pitch. He and his family often played and sang their native Wallachian folk songs, actively participated in church singing and folk-music performances. In school, Alois became very interested in the musical aspects of the Czech language, above all in pitch, rhythm, accent, dynamics, and timbre of the speech. In 1908 he entered the teachers&#x27; training college in Kroměříž, where he began to develop an interest in Czech national music, analyzing the works of Bedřich Smetana. Already at that time he found out from his textbooks that the European system of music was not the only one in the world and that even some European music had in the past used different scales than the ones used in his time. He therefore started to develop his own point of view in this issue. After finishing his studies, he got a job as teacher in Bílovice, a small town near the Hungarian (now Slovak) border. Simultaneously, he continued his own musical studies and in 1913 wrote his first compositions, displaying an unwillingness to &quot;follow the rules&quot;, which he maintained all his life. Hába was dissatisfied by small-town life, and in 1914, he moved to Prague and became a pupil of neoromantic composer Vítězslav Novák. Here he was interested in analysing the works of Claude Debussy, Max Reger, Alexander Scriabin, and Richard Strauss, and in harmonization of Moravian folk music.

=== Vienna ===

During World War I, he served in the Austrian Army on the Russian and Italian front from 1915 until early 1918, when he was moved to Vienna, where he worked in the music department of the Austrian-Hungarian Ministry of War. There he almost immediately became a student of Franz Schreker, who brought out his more radical tendencies. At that time, Hába wrote his first quarter-tone piece, Suite, consisting of three fugues in the quarter-tone system, composed for two pianos tuned a quarter tone apart. Remaining in Vienna after the war, Hába attended the concerts produced by Arnold Schönberg&#x27;s Verein für musikalische Privataufführungen, and became particularly influenced by the &quot;athematic&quot; style used by Schönberg in his &quot;Erwartung&quot;. First publications of his compositions included the String Quartet No. 2, his first major quarter-tone work which was composed in 1920. At that time, his lifelong friendship with Hanns Eisler – with whom he shared political beliefs (Hába became an ardent communist at this time) as well as musical opinions – began.

=== Berlin ===

Hába found his first success as a composer in Berlin, where he followed his teacher Schreker in late 1920. He published his first theoretical treatise (in Czech), the small booklet &quot;Harmonické základy čtvrttónové soustavy&quot; (Harmonic Essentials of the Quarter-tone System). In 1923, he met Ferruccio Busoni, who had advocated the sixth-tone system and encouraged Hába to continue his work in microtonality. The same year, Hába began to attempt the establishment of a school of microtonal music, but as the Nazis started to gain power in Germany, he came under attack and was driven out of Berlin. He returned to Prague and managed to get a job teaching workshops at the Prague Conservatory.

=== Prague ===

In July 1923 at the festival of modern music in Donaueschingen, the Amar-Hindemith Quartet played Hába&#x27;s quarter-tone String Quartet No. 3. His name began to appear alongside other representatives of his generation&#x27;s avant-garde musicians and, thanks to him, Czechoslovakia became one of the first member countries of the International Society for Contemporary Music. Hába wrote several theoretical articles on microtonality, athematicism, and church modes at this time. In 1925 he wrote his major theoretical work &quot;New Harmony-Textbook of the Diatonic, Chromatic, Quarter-, Third-, Sixth-, and Twelfth-tone Systems&quot; (if necessary, see: diatonic, chromatic). He designed and had built two quarter-tone pianos by early 1924 and a third in 1925. In 1927, the Czech branch factory of the German piano firm August Förster in the North Bohemian town of Jiříkov built for him a sixth-tone harmonium, patterned mostly after the design by Busoni.

After the premiere of his quarter-tone opera &quot;Matka&quot; (Mother) in 1931, introducing a practically athematic concept, Hába emerged as a leader of Czech modernist music and became internationally well known as one of the most important avantgarde composers. This opera also uses two quarter-tone clarinets and two quarter-tone trumpets, which were built especially for this work. In 1934, he composed the opera &quot;Nová země&quot; (The New Earth) in the twelve-tone system. Athematic constructions characteristic of his work appeared also later in the opera &quot;Přijď království tvé&quot; (Thy Kingdom Come) (1940), which is written in the sixth-tone system. In all three operas, Hába expressed his bold socialist viewpoint, that caused controversies already at the time. For instance, the production of Nová Země (the plot of which deals with the Holodomor in Ukraine and how the Holodomor in a Ukrainian village is defeated by socialisation of production) and founding the kolkhoz Nová Země (The New Earth) by National Theatre in Prague in 1936 had to be cancelled by intervention from the Ministry of Culture as communist and pro-soviet propaganda.

In 1933, when Josef Suk became director of the Prague Conservatory, Hába was made a full professor and established the Department of Quarter-tone and Sixth-tone Music. Here he had much influence over his many students. It was also the early 1930s that saw the writing of what is probably Hába&#x27;s most important orchestral work, the symphonic fantasy &quot;Cesta života&quot; (The Path of Life). The 1930s also shaped Hába&#x27;s political stance and philosophy of life. His strong sense of social commitment found an intellectual basis in the anthroposophical teachings of Rudolf Steiner.

In 1939 the German Nazis occupied Czechoslovakia and banned performance of Hába&#x27;s work. They closed down the Prague Conservatory in 1941 and prevented him from teaching. During the war Hába wrote a continuation of his &quot;Theory of Harmony&quot;, completed, as already mentioned, a sixth-tone opera (which was never produced), and considered constructing a twelfth-tone harmonium.

After World War II, he resumed teaching and held several administrative positions. At the turn of forties and fifties, the work of Alois Hába was affected by the communist regime in Czechoslovakia, becoming transitionally simplified, much more &quot;thematic&quot; and tonal, and also setting texts projecting communist ideology. He was nevertheless unable to rid himself of the label of “formalist” stuck onto him by Marxist aesthetics.

In 1953 he was sent into retirement, but in his own words it was only at that point that he achieved real creative freedom. In 1957 he was named an honorary member of the ISCM. When Hába returned to his style, he continued in his experimental musical studies, which culminated in the 1960s with the use of fifth tones in his Sixteenth String Quartet in 1967. This work was premiered in the same year at the ISCM festival in Prague, performing by Novák Quartet.
Hába was a prolific composer and continued to compose almost to the end of his life. He taught and influenced many musicians. Besides followers in his own country, Hába attracted students from South Slavic countries (Slovenia, Serbia, Bulgaria), Lithuania, Turkey, and elsewhere. The Prague Conservatory in general enjoyed an international reputation, and a great deal of credit for that goes to the contacts and pioneering efforts of Alois Hába. Despite these facts, he died in relative obscurity in Prague in 1973.

Alois Hába&#x27;s works total 103 opuses, the majority of which are various kinds of chamber music. Among the most important are his string quartets, which document and demonstrate the development of his style. In addition to quarter tones, Hába used sixth-tones in his String Quartets nos. in the 5, 10, and 11, as well as in Six Pieces for Sixth-tone Harmonium or String Quartet (1928), Duo for Sixth-tone Violins (1937), &quot;Thy Kingdom Come&quot;, a Sixth-tone Musical Drama in Seven Scenes (1937–42), Suite in Sixth-tones for Solo Violin (1955), and Suite in Sixth-tones for Solo Cello (1955).

<doc id="641068" wikidata="Q1373770" url="?curid=641068" title="Fernando Poe Jr.">
<text>Ronald Allan Kelley Poe (August 20, 1939 – December 14, 2004), known professionally as Fernando Poe Jr., and often referred to by his initials FPJ, was a Filipino actor, film director, producer, screenwriter, and politician. His long and successful career as an action star earned him the nickname &quot;Da King&quot; (i.e. the &quot;King of Philippine movies&quot;). He also wrote, directed, and produced several of the films he starred in—under the pseudonyms Ronwaldo Reyes and D&#x27;Lanor.

Poe appeared in around 300 films from 1955 to 2003. Poe entered the film industry as a stuntman following the death of his father, actor Fernando Poe Sr., and made his film debut in 1955 with &quot;Anak ni Palaris&quot;, a sequel to a film that starred his father. His breakout came in the 1956 film &quot;Lo Waist Gang&quot; and went on to star in action films that portrayed him as the &quot;champion and defender of the poor and oppressed&quot;. His notable films include: &quot;Only the Brave Know Hell&quot; (1965), Lino Brocka&#x27;s &quot;Santiago!&quot; (1970), Celso Ad. Castillo&#x27;s &quot;Asedillo&quot; (1971), &quot;Bato sa Buhangin&quot; (1976), &quot;Durugin si Totoy Bato&quot; (1979), Eddie Romero&#x27;s &quot;Aguila&quot; (1980); his self-directed &quot;Ang Panday&quot; (1980) and its sequels; &quot;Roman Rapido&quot; and &quot;Isang Bala Ka Lang!&quot; (both 1983), the 1986 films &quot;Iyo ang Tondo, Kanya ang Cavite&quot;, &quot;Muslim .357&quot;, and &quot;Batang Quiapo&quot;; &quot;Kahit Konting Pagtingin&quot; (1990), &quot;Ang Probinsyano&quot; (1996), &quot;Isusumbong Kita sa Tatay Ko...&quot; (1999), and &quot;Ang Dalubhasa&quot; (2000).

Poe&#x27;s accolades include five FAMAS Awards for Best Actor—a joint record that inducted him into the FAMAS Hall of Fame in 1988. He also won Best Director for his films &quot;Ang Padrino&quot; (1984) and &quot;Kahit Butas ng Karayom, Papasukin Ko&quot; (1995). In 2004, FAMAS posthumously granted him the Natatanging Alagad ng Sining Award. Poe was also posthumously declared a National Artist of the Philippines in 2006 (accepted by his family in 2012).

Poe ran for president of the Philippines in the 2004 election. He lost to the incumbent Gloria Macapagal Arroyo by just over one million votes (3.48%)—the closest margin between the winner and runner-up in the history of Philippine presidential elections. Seven months after the elections, Poe died of a stroke; hundreds of thousands attended his wake and funeral.

Poe was married to actress Susan Roces, who played his onscreen love interest in 17 films. He is the father of Senator Grace Poe and actress Lovi Poe.

==Early life and education==
Ronald Allan Kelley Poe was the son of Filipino actor and director Fernando Poe Sr. (born Allan Fernando Poe y Reyes; 1916–1951) from San Carlos, Pangasinan and Elizabeth &quot;Bessie&quot; Kelley (1918–1999). He was born in Manila on August 20, 1939. He was known as &quot;Ronnie&quot; to his family.

His parents, at the time of his birth, were not legally married until 1940. In 2004, Poe&#x27;s political opponents tried to derail his bid for the 2004 Philippine presidency when they sought to disqualify him as an illegitimate son of a non-Filipino mother.

He was the second among six siblings, including Andy (born Fernando Kelley Poe Jr.; 1943–1995), whose given name was used by Poe as his own professional name to bank on the popularity of his father who was a top actor in his time. Conrad Poe was Poe&#x27;s half-brother, the illegitimate son of Fernando Poe Sr. and actress Patricia Mijares.

The original spelling of the family surname was Pou, from his paternal grandfather, playwright Lorenzo Pou, a Catalan migrant from Mallorca, Spain, who ventured into mining and business in the Philippines.

In 1953, Poe finished his primary education at San Beda College. For high school, he attended San Sebastian College. He continued his education at Mapúa Institute of Technology and University of the East and took the course theater arts.

When his father died from rabies at age 34, Poe became the family&#x27;s breadwinner. In order to support his family, he dropped out of the University of the East during his sophomore year.

==Film career==
Poe dropped out of college to work in the Philippine film industry as a messenger boy, and was given acting roles in subsequent years. Starting as a stuntman for Everlasting Pictures, he was given a starring role in the film &quot;Anak ni Palaris&quot; (&quot;Son of Palaris&quot;) at the age of 14. The film, however, was not a big hit. In 1956, the film &quot;Lo&#x27; Waist Gang&quot; made him popular, and the film was such a hit that low-waist pants became a fad.

Also known as &#x27;FPJ&#x27; from his initials, Poe acted in a number of films which depicted him as the champion of the poor and downtrodden. He also directed films under the pseudonyms D&#x27;Lanor and Ronwaldo Reyes. &quot;Reyes&quot; originated from the surname of his paternal grandmother, Martha.

He established FPJ Productions in 1961 and later organized other film companies. In 1963, he testified against criminal gangs, known as the Big Four, who extorted money from the film industry. In 1965, he shared the lead in &quot;The Ravagers&quot; (in the Philippines this is titled &quot;Only the Brave Know Hell&quot;), a film depicting the United States and the Philippines working together against Japanese war time occupation. The film is considered one of the most influential Filipino films.

Poe won the most best actor awards at the FAMAS. Among the films that received awards were &quot;Mga Alabok sa Lupa&quot; (1967), &quot;Asedillo&quot; (1971), &quot;Durugin si Totoy Bato&quot; (1979), &quot;Umpisahan Mo, Tatapusin Ko&quot; (1983), and &quot;Muslim .357&quot; (1986).

Poe was one of the highest paid film actors in the Philippines in the 1980s (alongside Dolphy and Vilma Santos), with his salary reaching over one million pesos per film. In 1988, Poe partnered with San Miguel Corporation in a near promotional deal for San Miguel Beer, his first endorsement of a product in his entire film career, with the first television commercial airing on January 20.

In mid-1993, Poe was then set to star in a film produced by Viva Films and directed by Pablo Santiago titled &quot;Tulak ng Bibig, Kabig ng Dibdib&quot;, with Alice Dixson cast as the female lead, though it did not come to fruition.

Among his roles were Flavio in the &quot;Ang Panday&quot; fantasy series, &quot;Kahit Konting Pagtingin&quot;, &quot;Dito sa Pitong Gatang&quot; and &quot;Aguila&quot;. His last film, &quot;Pakners&quot;, also stars 9-ball billiards champion Efren &quot;Bata&quot; Reyes.

==Political career==
===2004 Presidential bid===
Fernando Poe Jr., was the Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino (KNP)&#x27;s candidate for the 2004 presidential election. He accepted nomination in December 2003 and was to be the opposition candidate in the Philippines&#x27; 2004 presidential election.

==Personal life==
Poe married actress Susan Roces, the professional name of Jesusa Sonora, in a civil wedding in December 1968. They later married in a religious service and among their primary sponsors were then-President Ferdinand Marcos and First Lady Imelda. Poe and Roces adopted a daughter, Grace Poe, who became a senator.

Poe was very reclusive about his personal life. However, in February 2004, during the presidential campaign, Poe admitted to having fathered two children out of wedlock. He had an affair with actress Anna Marin and had one son, Ronian and with former actress Rowena Moran and had a daughter, Lourdes Virginia.

==Death and legacy==

Poe was admitted to St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center in Quezon City in the evening of December 11, 2004 after complaining of dizziness at a gathering in his production studio during a Christmas party. He suffered from a stroke and slipped into a coma while being treated for a brain clot. Doctors described his condition as a cerebral thrombosis with multiple organ failure. He died at the age of 65 on December 14 at 12:01 am PHT (UTC+08:00), without regaining consciousness. His remains were initially transferred to the Arlington East Memorial Chapels in Pasig (now known as the Evergreen Memorial Chapels), before being transferred a day later to the Santo Domingo Church in Quezon City. Organizers of the nine-day wake claimed numbers as high as two million. The funeral procession drew tens of thousands who crowded the streets of Quezon City, an event which drew comparisons to the funeral processions of former Senator Ninoy Aquino in August 1983 – who also had his wake held at the Santo Domingo Church – and of actress Julie Vega in May 1985. He was buried in his family plot along with his parents in the Manila North Cemetery.

On December 14, 2012, eight years after his death, a monument to Poe was erected at the corner of Roxas Boulevard and Arquiza Street in Ermita, Manila, with widow Susan Roces and daughter Grace Poe attending the unveiling.

On January 13, 2022, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11608, renaming Roosevelt Avenue in Quezon City as Fernando Poe Jr. Avenue.

On his 84th birth anniversary on August 20, 2023, Roosevelt station of LRT Line 1 in Quezon City was renamed Fernando Poe Jr. station and FPJ Arena, a sports arena in San Jose, Batangas also named in his honor, was inaugurated.

In 2013, Tonton Gutierrez portrayed Fernando Poe Jr. in the life story of Poe&#x27;s daughter Grace Poe, depicted by Erich Gonzales, on &quot;Maalaala Mo Kaya&quot;. In 2015, his 1997 film &quot;Ang Probinsyano&quot; was remade by ABS-CBN into a TV series, starring Coco Martin as the main character to portray twins namely SPO1 Ricardo &quot;Cardo&quot; Dalisay and Police Sr. Insp. Dominador &quot;Ador&quot; de Leon together with Susan Roces, FPJ&#x27;s widow.

==Filmography==
 I &quot;Kamao&quot; is Poe&#x27;s only film produced specifically for television, premiering on RPN in June 1987.

<text>Knowbotic Research is a German-Swiss electronic art group, established in 1991. Its members are Yvonne Wilhelm, Christian Hübler and Alexander Tuchacek. They hold a professorship for Art and Media at the University of the Arts in Zürich.

==History==
Yvonne Wilhelm (born 1962), Christian Huebler (born 1962), Alexander Tuchacek (born 1962) are based in Zürich Switzerland.

The Knowbotic Research group has experimented with the intersection of technology, information and knowledge, interface, immersive virtual reality and networked agency. In their work &quot;Simulation Mosaik Data Klaenge&quot; from 1993, they experimented with so called intelligent agent, applications which can conglomerate diaphanous information by themselves (also called knowbots) and intelligent virtual spaces (flexible information-environments distributed in electronic networks). Knowbotic Research KR+cF has regularly invited people from non-art fields to participate in their projects, such as scientists, philosophers and engineers, depending on the concept of each project. In partnership with the Academy of Media Arts Cologne, Knowbotic Research KR+cF has founded &quot;Membrane&quot;, a laboratory for media strategies, in 1995. In their more recent work, they created media-based projects that try to intervene in the (physical or digital) public domain.

Knowbotic is a coinage that combined &quot;knowledge&quot; with &quot;robotic&quot;, meaning intellectual agent on the Internet. Knowbotic has developed some projects themed on an information environment and a computer interface. Since 1998, it has become more flexible, and with these main three of them, different members from various fields such as art, science, and philosophy, have joined in each program. In 1997, it worked with Japanese art group, Canon Art Lab, in Tokyo. This project aimed at revealing the function of the city by interacting between real and virtual world.

==Awards==
Knowbotic Research has been exhibited widely and has received several prizes, including:
* Two Prix Ars Electronica Golden Nicas (in 1994 and 1998)
* The Claasen Prize for Media Art and Photography, Cologne
* The international ZKM Media-art award
* The August Seeling-Award of Wilhelm Lehmbruck Museum

<doc id="641073" wikidata="Q1132051" url="?curid=641073" title="Vertical bar">
<text>The vertical bar, , is a glyph with various uses in mathematics, computing, and typography. It has many names, often related to particular meanings: Sheffer stroke (in logic), pipe, bar, or (literally, the word &quot;or&quot;), vbar, and others.

==Usage==

===Mathematics===
The vertical bar is used as a mathematical symbol in numerous ways.
If used as a pair of brackets, it suggests the notion of the word &quot;size&quot;. These are:
* absolute value: formula_1, read &quot;the &quot;absolute value&quot; of &quot;x&quot;&quot;
* cardinality: formula_2, read &quot;the &quot;cardinality&quot; of the set &quot;S&quot;&quot; or &quot;the &quot;length&quot; of a string &quot;S&quot;&quot;
* determinant: formula_3, read &quot;the &quot;determinant&quot; of the matrix &quot;A&quot;&quot;. When the matrix entries are written out, the determinant is denoted by surrounding the matrix entries by vertical bars instead of the usual brackets or parentheses of the matrix, as in formula_4.
* order: formula_5, read &quot;the &quot;order&quot; of the group &quot;G&quot;&quot;, or formula_6, &quot;the &quot;order&quot; of the element formula_7&quot;

Likewise, the vertical bar is also used singly in many different ways:
* conditional probability: formula_8, read &quot;the probability of &quot;X&quot; &quot;given&quot; &quot;Y&quot;
* distance: formula_9, denoting the shortest &quot;distance&quot; between point formula_10 to line formula_11, so line formula_9 is perpendicular to line formula_11
* divisibility: formula_14, read &quot;a&quot; &quot;divides&quot; &quot;b&quot; or &quot;a&quot; is a &quot;factor&quot; of &quot;b&quot;&quot;, though Unicode also provides special &#x27;divides&#x27; and &#x27;does not divide&#x27; symbols (U+2223 and U+2224:∣, ∤)
* function evaluation: formula_15, read &quot;&quot;f&quot; of &quot;x&quot;, evaluated at &quot;x&quot; equals 4&quot; (see at Wikibooks)
* restriction: formula_16, denoting the &quot;restriction&quot; of the function formula_17, with a domain that is a superset of formula_18, to just formula_18
* set-builder notation: formula_20, read &quot;the set of &quot;x&quot; &quot;such that&quot; &quot;x&quot; is less than two&quot;. Often, a colon &#x27;:&#x27; is used instead of a vertical bar
* the Sheffer stroke in logic: formula_21, read &quot;&quot;a&quot; &quot;nand&quot; &quot;b&quot;
* subtraction: formula_22, read &quot;f(x)&quot; &quot;from&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;to&quot; &quot;b&quot;&quot;, denoting formula_23. Used in the context of a definite integral with variable &quot;x&quot;.
* A vertical bar can be used to separate variables from fixed parameters in a function, for example formula_24, or in the notation for elliptic integrals.

The double vertical bar, formula_25, is also employed in mathematics.
* parallelism: formula_26, read &quot;the line formula_27 &quot;is parallel to&quot; the line formula_28&quot;
* norm: formula_29, read &quot;the &quot;norm&quot; (length, size, magnitude etc.) of the matrix formula_18&quot;. The norm of a one-dimensional vector is the absolute value and single bars are used.
* Propositional truncation: (a type former that truncates a type down to a mere proposition in homotopy type theory): for any formula_31 (read &quot;term formula_32 of type formula_33&quot;) we have formula_34 (here formula_35 reads &quot;&quot;image&quot; of formula_31 in formula_37&quot; and formula_34 reads &quot;&quot;propositional truncation&quot; of formula_18&quot;)

In LaTeX mathematical mode, the ASCII vertical bar produces a vertical line, and codice_1 creates a double vertical line (codice_2 is set as formula_40). This has different spacing from codice_3 and codice_4, which are relational operators: codice_5 is set as formula_41. See below about LaTeX in text mode.

=== Chemistry ===
In chemistry, the vertical line is used in cell notation of electrochemical cells.

Example,

Zn | Zn2+ || Cu2+ | Cu

Single vertical lines show components of the cell which do not mix, usually being in different phases. The double vertical line ( || ) is used to represent salt bridge; which is used to allow free moving ions to move.

===Physics===
The vertical bar is used in bra–ket notation in quantum physics. Examples:
* formula_42: the quantum physical state formula_43
* formula_44: the dual state corresponding to the state above
* formula_45: the inner product of states formula_43 and formula_47
* Supergroups in physics are denoted &quot;G&quot;(&quot;N&quot;|&quot;M&quot;), which reads &quot;&quot;G&quot;, &quot;M&quot; vertical bar &quot;N&quot;&quot;; here &quot;G&quot; denotes any supergroup, &quot;M&quot; denotes the bosonic dimensions, and &quot;N&quot; denotes the Grassmann dimensions.

===Computing===

==== Pipe ====
A pipe is an inter-process communication mechanism originating in Unix, which directs the output (standard out and, optionally, standard error) of one process to the input (standard in) of another. In this way, a series of commands can be &quot;piped&quot; together, giving users the ability to quickly perform complex multi-stage processing from the command line or as part of a Unix shell script (&quot;bash file&quot;). In most Unix shells (command interpreters), this is represented by the vertical bar character. For example:

codice_6

where the output from the grep process (all lines containing &#x27;blair&#x27;) is piped to the more process (which allows a command line user to read through results one page at a time).

The same &quot;pipe&quot; feature is also found in later versions of DOS and Microsoft Windows.

This usage has led to the character itself being called &quot;pipe&quot;.

In Windows the shortcut is .

====Disjunction====
In many programming languages, the vertical bar is used to designate the logic operation &quot;or&quot;, either bitwise &quot;or&quot; or logical &quot;or&quot;.

Specifically, in C and other languages following C syntax conventions, such as C++, Perl, Java and C#, codice_7 denotes a bitwise &quot;or&quot;; whereas a double vertical bar codice_8 denotes a (short-circuited) logical &quot;or&quot;. Since the character was originally not available in all code pages and keyboard layouts, ANSI C can transcribe it in form of the trigraph codice_9, which, outside string literals, is equivalent to the codice_10 character.

In regular expression syntax, the vertical bar again indicates logical &quot;or&quot; (alternation). For example: the Unix command codice_11 matches lines containing &#x27;fu&#x27; or &#x27;bar&#x27;.

====Concatenation====
The double vertical bar operator &quot;||&quot; denotes string concatenation in PL/I, REXX, ooRexx, standard ANSI SQL, and theoretical computer science (particularly cryptography).

====Delimiter====
Although not as common as commas or tabs, the vertical bar can be used as a delimiter in a flat file. Examples of a pipe-delimited standard data format are LEDES 1998B and HL7. It is frequently used because vertical bars are typically uncommon in the data itself.

Similarly, the vertical bar may see use as a delimiter for regular expression operations (e.g. in sed). This is useful when the regular expression contains instances of the more common forward slash (codice_12) delimiter; using a vertical bar eliminates the need to escape all instances of the forward slash. However, this makes the bar unusable as the regular expression &quot;alternative&quot; operator.

====Backus–Naur form====
In Backus–Naur form, an expression consists of sequences of symbols and/or sequences separated by &#x27;|&#x27;, indicating a choice, the whole being a possible substitution for the symbol on the left.
====Concurrency operator====
In calculi of communicating processes (like pi-calculus), the vertical bar is used to indicate that processes execute in parallel.

====APL====
The pipe in APL is the modulo or &quot;residue&quot; function between two operands and the absolute value function next to one operand.

====List comprehensions====
The vertical bar is used for list comprehensions in some functional languages, e.g. Haskell and Erlang. Compare set-builder notation.

====Text markup====

The vertical bar is used as a special character in lightweight markup languages, notably MediaWiki&#x27;s Wikitext (in the templates and internal links).

In LaTeX text mode, the vertical bar produces an em dash (—). The codice_13 command can be used to produce a vertical bar.

===Phonetics and orthography===

In the Khoisan languages and the International Phonetic Alphabet, the vertical bar is used to write the dental click (). A double vertical bar is used to write the alveolar lateral click (). Since these are technically letters, they have their own Unicode code points in the Latin Extended-B range: U+01C0 for the single bar and U+01C1 for the double bar.

Some Northwest and Northeast Caucasian languages written in the Cyrillic script have a vertical bar called palochka (), indicating the preceding consonant is an ejective.

Longer single and double vertical bars are used to mark prosodic boundaries in the IPA.

===Literature===
In medieval European manuscripts, a single vertical bar was a common variant of the virgula used as a comma, or caesura mark.

In Sanskrit and other Indian languages, a single vertical mark, ।, called a danda, has a similar function as a period (full stop). Two bars, ॥, (a &#x27;double danda&#x27;) is the equivalent of a pilcrow in marking the end of a stanza, paragraph or section. The danda has its own Unicode code point, ; as does the double danda: .

====Poetry====
A double vertical bar or is the standard caesura mark in English literary criticism and analysis. It marks the strong break or caesura common to many forms of poetry, particularly Old English verse. It is also traditionally used to mark the division between lines of verse printed as prose (the style preferred by Oxford University Press), though it is now often replaced by the forward slash.
====Notation====
In the Geneva Bible and early printings of the King James Version, a double vertical bar is used to mark margin notes that contain an alternative translation from the original text. These margin notes always begin with the conjunction &quot;Or&quot;. In later printings of the King James Version, the double vertical bar is irregularly used to mark any comment in the margins.

A double vertical bar symbol may be used to call out a footnote. (The traditional order of these symbols in English is *, †, ‡, §, ‖, ¶, so its use is very rare; in modern usage, numbers and letters are preferred for endnotes and footnotes.)

====Music scoring====

In music, when writing chord sheets, single vertical bars associated with a colon (|: A / / / :|) represents the beginning and end of a section (e.g. Intro, Interlude, Verse, Chorus) of music. Single bars can also represent the beginning and end of measures (|: A / / / | D / / / | E / / / :|). A double vertical bar associated with a colon can represent the repeat of a given section (||: A / / / :|| - play twice).

==Encoding==

=== Solid vertical bar versus broken bar ===

Many early video terminals and dot-matrix printers rendered the vertical bar character as the allograph broken bar . This may have been to distinguish the character from the lower-case &#x27;L&#x27; and the upper-case &quot; on these limited-resolution devices, and to make a vertical line of them look more like a horizontal line of dashes. It was also (briefly) part of the ASCII standard.

An initial draft for a 7-bit character set that was published by the X3.2 subcommittee for Coded Character Sets and Data Format on June 8, 1961, was the first to include the vertical bar in a standard set. The bar was intended to be used as the representation for the logical OR symbol. A subsequent draft on May 12, 1966, places the vertical bar in column 7 alongside regional entry codepoints, and formed the basis for the original draft proposal used by the International Standards Organisation. This draft received opposition from the IBM user group SHARE, with its chairman, H. W. Nelson, writing a letter to the American Standards Association titled &quot;The Proposed revised American Standard Code for Information Interchange does NOT meet the needs of computer programmers!&quot;; in this letter, he argues that no characters within the international subset designated at columns 2-5 of the character set would be able to adequately represent logical OR and logical NOT in languages such as IBM&#x27;s PL/I universally on all platforms. As a compromise, a requirement was introduced where the exclamation mark (!) and circumflex (^) would display as logical OR (|) and logical NOT (¬) respectively in use cases such as programming, while outside of these use cases they would represent their original typographic symbols:
The original vertical bar encoded at 0x7C in the original May 12, 1966 draft was then broken as , so it could not be confused with the unbroken logical OR. In the 1967 revision of ASCII, along with the equivalent ISO 464 code published the same year, the code point was defined to be a broken vertical bar, and the exclamation mark character was allowed to be rendered as a solid vertical bar. However, the 1977 revision (ANSI X.3-1977) undid the changes made in the 1967 revision, enforcing that the circumflex could no longer be stylised as a logical NOT symbol, the exclamation mark likewise no longer allowing stylisation as a vertical bar, and defining the code point originally set to the broken bar as a solid vertical bar instead; the same changes were also reverted in ISO 646-1973 published four years prior.

Some variants of EBCDIC included both versions of the character as different code points. The broad implementation of the extended ASCII ISO/IEC 8859 series in the 1990s also made a distinction between the two forms. This was preserved in Unicode as a separate character at U+00A6 (the term &quot;parted rule&quot; is used sometimes in Unicode documentation). Some fonts draw the characters the same (both are solid vertical bars, or both are broken vertical bars).

Many keyboards with US, US-International, and German QWERTZ layout display the broken bar on a keycap even though the solid vertical bar character is produced. This is a legacy of keyboards manufactured during the 1980s and 1990s for IBM PC compatible computers, as the IBM PC continued to display the glyph for the broken bar at codepoint 7C on displays from MDA (1981) to VGA (1987) despite the changes made to ASCII in 1977. The UK/Ireland keyboard has both symbols engraved: the broken bar is given as an alternate graphic on the &quot;grave&quot; (backtick) key; the solid bar is on the backslash key.

The broken bar character can be typed (depending on the layout) as or or on Windows and on Linux. It can be inserted into HTML as 

The broken bar does not appear to have any clearly identified uses distinct from those of the vertical bar. In non-computing use — for example in mathematics, physics and general typography — the broken bar is not an acceptable substitute for the vertical bar. In some dictionaries, the broken bar is used to mark stress that may be either primary or secondary: covers the pronunciations and .

===Unicode code points===
These glyphs are encoded in Unicode as follows:
* (single vertical line)
* (single broken line)
* (double vertical line ( formula_25 ): used in pairs to indicate norm)
* (Fullwidth form)
* 
* 
* (and various other box drawing characters in the range U+2500 to U+257F)
*

<text>Paul Cornu (; 15 June 1881 – 6 June 1944) was a French engineer.

== Life==
Paul Cornu, of Romanian origins, was born in Glos la Ferrière, France and was one of thirteen children. At a young age, he helped his father in his transports company. He made history by designing the world&#x27;s first successful manned rotary wing aircraft.

Cornu first built an unmanned experimental design powered by a 2 hp Buchet engine.

His manned helicopter was powered by a Antoinette engine. He piloted this construction himself at Normandy, France on 13 November 1907. Previously, a French helicopter, the Breguet-Richet Gyroplane I, had managed to lift off under its own power, but it had been held in position by men standing on the ground. Cornu&#x27;s performance was a considerable progress because his aircraft flew without additional support and lifted Cornu about 30 cm (1 ft) for 20 seconds. Unfortunately this early helicopter was scarcely maneuverable and had only a few additional flights. The construction was not much further developed by this technical pioneer, who had to keep on making a living by manufacturing bicycles.

== Death ==
Paul Cornu died aged 62 in 1944 in Lisieux, France, when his home was destroyed during the bombardment by the Allies that accompanied the Normandy landings of World War II.

<text>Brails, in a sailing ship, are small lines used to haul in or up the edges (leeches) or corners of sails, before furling. On a ship rig, these brails are most often found on the mizzen sail. To haul and furl the sails, the command used in the early 18th century was &quot;hale up the brails&quot; or &quot;brail up the sails&quot;. 

The word brail comes from Middle English &quot;brayle&quot;, from Anglo-French &quot;braiel&quot; belt, strap, brail, alteration of Old French &quot;braiuel&quot; belt, probably ultimately from Latin &quot;braca&quot; pant.

A brail net is a type of net incorporating brail lines on a small fishing net on a boat or castnet. A brail net used for casting is also referred to as an English net as opposed to a Spanish net.

<doc id="641076" wikidata="Q164290" url="?curid=641076" title="Tikkun olam">
<text>Tikkun olam (; ) is a concept in Judaism, which refers to various forms of action intended to repair and improve the world. 

In classical rabbinic literature, the phrase referred to legal enactments intended to preserve the social order. In the &quot;Aleinu&quot; prayer, it refers to the eradication of idolatry. In Lurianic Kabbalah, the &quot;repair&quot; is mystical: to return the sparks of Divine light to their source by means of ritual performance.

In the modern era, particularly among the post-Haskalah movements, &quot;tikkun olam&quot; has come to refer to the pursuit of social justice or &quot;the establishment of Godly qualities throughout the world&quot; based on the idea that &quot;Jews bear responsibility not only for their own moral, spiritual, and material welfare, but also for the welfare of society at large&quot;.

==History==
===In the Mishnah===
The earliest use of the term &quot;tikkun olam&quot; comes in the phrase &quot;mip&#x27;nei tikkun ha-olam&quot;, &quot;for the sake of repairing the world&quot;, which appears in the Mishnah (Gittin 4:2–9) with the meaning of amending the law in order to keep society well-functioning.

A number of legal enactments appear in this passage with &quot;mip&#x27;nei tikkun ha-olam&quot; given as justification:
* One cannot convene a court in another place in order to nullify a get (divorce document). (4:2)
* One must fully specify the names of the husband and wife on a divorce document. (4:2)
* A widow can collect her ketubah even without a formal oath. (4:3)
* Witnesses must sign the divorce document. (4:3)
* Prozbul was instituted. (4:3)
* If an enslaver set aside an enslaved person as a designated repayment for his debts, the enslaved person is freed but the responsibility to repay the debt is transferred to them. (4:4)
* If two people enslave one person, and one enslaver frees that person, the formerly enslaved person is forced to repay the second enslaver his share of the value of the enslavement. (4:5)
* Captives are not redeemed for more than their monetary value. (4:6)
* Captives are not aided in their attempts to escape (so that captors do not make the conditions of captivity more restrictive, or else so that captors do not take revenge on other captives). (4:6)
* Torah scrolls, tefillin, and mezuzot are not purchased from non-Jews for more than their value. (4:6)
* Once when a husband made a vow requiring him to divorce his wife, they were then allowed to remarry. (4:7)
* One who sold their field to a non-Jew must purchase and bring the first fruits from that field. (4:9)

More generally, tikkun can mean improvement, establishment, repair, prepare, and more. In this Mishnaic context it generally refers to practical legal measures taken in the present to ameliorate social conditions. In the legal language of the Talmud, however, the verb took on a much more legalistic role, in that a &quot;Takkana&quot; – literally, &quot;Affixation&quot; – was a category of legal enactment made by the Sages.

===In &quot;Aleinu&quot;===
A conception of &quot;tikkun olam&quot; is also found in the &quot;Aleinu&quot;, a concluding part of most Jewish congregational prayer, which in contrast to the Mishnah&#x27;s usage, focuses on the end of time. The &quot;Aleinu&quot; God:

In other words, when all the people of the world abandon false gods and recognize God, the world will have been perfected.

Among modern liberal Jewish movements, a common but more modern understanding of this phrase is that we share a partnership with God, and are instructed to take the steps towards improving the state of the world and helping others, which simultaneously brings more honor to God&#x27;s sovereignty. 

Some scholars have argued that the &quot;Aleinu&quot; prayer is actually not a valid source for the concept of &quot;tikkun olam&quot;, claiming that the original prayer used a homonym &quot;l&#x27;takhen&quot; (spelled differently, ) meaning &quot;to establish&quot; (rather than &quot;to fix&quot; or &quot;to repair&quot;); this wording is still used by Yemenite Jews. However, among European Jews, &quot;Aleinu&quot; has used the word &quot;to fix&quot; () since at least the first recorded texts in the 11th–12th centuries. Thus, Aleinu&#x27;s influence on the concept of &quot;tikkun olam&quot; can date to at least this time.

===Maimonides===
Over the course of Jewish intellectual history, &quot;tikkun olam&quot; has at times referred to eschatological concerns, as in Aleinu, and at times to practical concerns, as in the Mishnah, but in either context, it refers to some kind of social change or process that is for the betterment of Jews or Gentiles or the world. Whether that happens primarily within Jewish society or primarily in relation to the nations of the world, whether that happens primarily through acts of justice and kindness, or equally through ritual observance, whether primarily through internal work of an individual or through external deeds, is something that changes from one source to the next. For example, Talmudic scholar and eminent philosopher of the Middle Ages Maimonides saw &quot;tikkun olam&quot; as fully inclusive of all these dimensions when he wrote &quot;Through wisdom, which is [represented by] Torah, and the elevation of character, which is [represented by] acts of kindness, and observing the Torah’s commandments, which are [represented by] the sacrifices, one continuously brings &quot;tikkun olam&quot; improvement of the world, and the ordering of reality.&quot; Yet he also saw justice as a fundamental component, as for example when he wrote, &quot;Every judge who judges truth unto its [deepest] truth, even for one hour, it’s as if he fixed the whole world entirely / &quot;tikein et kol ha’olam kulo&quot; and caused the Shekhinah to rest upon Israel.&quot;

===Lurianic Kabbalah===
Lurianic Kabbalah dwells on the role of prayer and ritual in &quot;tikkun&quot; of the upper worlds. According to this vision of the world, God contracted part of God&#x27;s infinite light (&quot;Ohr Ein Sof&quot;)—concealing Himself—to create the world. The vessels (&quot;kelim&quot;) of the first universe—&quot;Olam HaTohu&quot;, i.e., the &quot;world of chaos&quot;—shattered (&quot;Shevirat HaKelim&quot;) and their shards became sparks of light (&quot;neẓuẓot)&quot; trapped within the next universe—&quot;Olam HaTikun&quot;, i.e., &quot;the world of rectification&quot;. Prayer, especially contemplation of various aspects of the divinity (&quot;sephirot&quot;), releases these sparks of God&#x27;s light and allows them to reunite with God&#x27;s essence. The &quot;rectification&quot; is two-fold: the gathering of light and of souls, to be achieved by human beings through the contemplative performance of religious acts. The goal of such repair, which can only be effected by humans, is to separate what is holy from the created world, thus depriving the physical world of its very existence, destroying the material universe. This restores all things to a world before disaster within the Godhead.

According to Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, in his book &quot;Derech Hashem&quot;, the physical world is connected to spiritual realms above that influence the physical world, and furthermore, Jews have the ability, through physical deeds and free will, to direct and control these spiritual forces. God&#x27;s desire in creation was that God&#x27;s creations ultimately will recognize God&#x27;s unity and overcome evil; this will constitute the perfection (&quot;tikkun&quot;) of creation. While the Jews have the Torah now and are aware of God&#x27;s unity, some believe that when all of humanity recognizes this fact, the rectification will be complete. In recent years Jewish thinkers and activists have used Lurianic Kabbalah to elevate the full range of ethical and ritual &quot;mitzvot&quot; into acts of &quot;tikkun olam&quot;. The belief that not only does prayer lift up divine sparks, but so do all of the &quot;mitzvot&quot;, including those traditionally understood as ethical, was already a part of Kabbalah, but the contemporary emphasis serves the purpose of finding a mystical depth and spiritual energy in ethical &quot;mitzvot&quot;. The application of the Lurianic vision to improving the world can be seen in Jewish blogs, High Holiday sermons and on-line Jewish learning resource centers.

The association between the Lurianic conception of &quot;tikkun&quot; and ethical action assigns an ultimate significance to even small acts of kindness and small improvements of social policy. However, if this is done in a manner that separates the concept of &quot;tikkun olam&quot; from its other meanings as found in rabbinic literature and the &quot;Aleinu&quot; prayer, there is a risk of privileging actions that have no real religious significance and represent personal agendas more than Judaism itself.

The application of Lurianic Kabbalah to ethical &quot;mitzvot&quot; and social action is particularly striking because Lurianic Kabbalah saw itself as repairing dimensions within the spiritual, the mystical worlds, rather than this world and its social relations. Author Lawrence Fine points to two features of Lurianic Kabbalah that have made it adaptable to ethical &quot;mitzvot&quot; and social action. First, he points out that a generation recovering from the tragedy of the Holocaust resonates with the imagery of shattered vessels. Second, both Lurianic Kabbalah and ethical understandings of &quot;tikkun olam&quot; emphasize the role of human responsibility and action.

===Modern developments===
The original context of the Aleinu prayer, in the Rosh Hashanah liturgy, is accompanied by the hope that &quot;all [people/creatures] will form a single union to do Your will with a whole heart&quot;. In many contexts this is interpreted to be a call to universalism and justice for all mankind – sentiments which are common throughout Jewish liturgy. For example, in the American Conservative movement&#x27;s prayer book, &quot;Siddur Sim Shalom&quot;, &quot;A Prayer for Our Country&quot; elaborates on this passage: &quot;May citizens of all races and creeds forge a common bond in true harmony to banish all hatred and bigotry&quot; and &quot;uniting all people in peace and freedom and helping them to fulfill the vision of your prophet: &#x27;Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they experience war anymore. Both lines express wholeheartedly the idea of universal equality, freedom, and peace for all.

In the liberal movements of Judaism, most especially in the United States, this sentiment is especially embedded in the idea of acting compassionately for all people, as for example in the 1975 New Union prayer book, used by the movement for Reform Judaism&quot; Gates of Prayer&quot;, which includes the text &quot;You [Lord] have taught us to uphold the falling, to heal the sick, to free the captive, to comfort all who suffer pain&quot;. These aspects of Judaism already have a traditional name however, &quot;gemilut chasadim&quot;, and some have criticized the tendency to emphasize social action as a kind of disregard for other aspects of Judaism traditionally connected to &quot;tikkun olam&quot;, like learning, prayer, repentance, and ritual commandments.

Perhaps the first Jewish thinker to use the phrase &quot;tikkun olam&quot; in the modern sense of &quot;fixing the world&quot; by building a just society was Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook (1865–1935). According to Jewish scholar Lawrence Fine, the first use of the phrase &quot;tikkun olam&quot; in modern Jewish history in the United States was by Brandeis-Bardin Camp Institute founder Shlomo Bardin in the 1950s. Bardin interpreted the &quot;Aleinu&quot; prayer, specifically the expression &quot;le-taken olam be-malchut shaddai&quot; (typically translated as &quot;when the world shall be perfected under the reign of the almighty&quot;), as a responsibility for Jewish people to work towards a better world. However, while Bardin was a significant popularizer of the term, one also finds it being used in similar manner in the late 1930s and early 1940s by Alexander Dushkin and Mordecai Kaplan. As left-leaning progressive Jewish organizations started entering the mainstream in the 1970s and 1980s, the phrase &quot;tikkun olam&quot; began to gain more traction. The phrase has since been adopted by a variety of Jewish organizations, to mean anything from direct service to general philanthropy. It was presented to a wide international audience—itself an indication of how widely &quot;tikkun olam&quot; had now permeated American Jewish life—when Mordecai Waxman used the phrase in a speech during Pope John Paul II&#x27;s visit to the United States in September 1987.

==Performance of &quot;mitzvot&quot; ==
Classical Jewish texts teach that performing of ritual &quot;mitzvot&quot; (good deeds, commandments, connections, or religious obligations) is a means of &quot;tikkun olam&quot;, helping to perfect the world, and that the performance of more &quot;mitzvot&quot; will hasten the coming of the Messiah and the Messianic Age. This belief dates back at least to the early Talmudic period. According to Rabbi Yochanan, quoting Rabbi Shim&#x27;on ben Yochai, the Jewish people will be redeemed when every Jew observes Shabbat twice in all its details. Some explain that this will occur because Shabbat rest (which is considered a foretaste of the Messianic Age) energizes Jews to work harder to bring the Messianic Age nearer during the six working days of the week. It is expected that in the messianic era there will be no injustice or exploitation, a state comparable with &quot;tikkun olam&quot;.

===Ethical behavior===
In Jewish thought, ethical &quot;mitzvot&quot; as well as ritual &quot;mitzvot&quot; are important to the process of &quot;tikkun olam&quot;. Maimonides writes that &quot;tikkun olam&quot; requires efforts in all three of the great &quot;pillars&quot; of Judaism: Torah study, acts of kindness, and the ritual commandments. Some Jews believe that performing &quot;mitzvot&quot; will create a model society among the Jewish people, which will in turn influence the rest of the world. By perfecting themselves, their local Jewish community or the state of Israel, the Jews set an example for the rest of the world. The theme is frequently repeated in sermons and writings across the Jewish spectrum: Reconstructionist, Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox. 

Also, the &quot;mitzvot&quot; often have practical worldly/social effects (in contrast to mystical effects as held by Lurianic Kabbalah).

===&quot;Tzedakah&quot;===
&quot;Tzedakah&quot; is a central theme in Judaism and serves as one of the 613 commandments. Tzedakah is used in common parlance as charitable giving. &quot;Tzedek&quot;, the root of &quot;tzedakah&quot;, means justice or righteousness. Acts of &quot;tzedakah&quot; are used to generate a more just world. Therefore, &quot;tzedakah&quot; is a means through which to perform &quot;tikkun olam&quot;.

Philanthropy is an effective tool in performing &quot;tikkun olam&quot; as it supports organizations that perform direct service. There are many different philanthropic organizations devoted to repairing the world. The Jewish Federations of North America, one of the top ten charities in the world, counts &quot;tikkun olam&quot; as one of the three main principles under which it operates. Similarly, the American Jewish World Service supports grassroots organizations creating change in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.

The intersection between &quot;tzedakah&quot;, philanthropy, and &quot;tikkun olam&quot; is captured by Yehudah Mirsky in his article &quot;Tikkun Olam: Basic Questions and Policy Directions&quot;. Mirsky writes:

==Building a model society==
By performing the &quot;mitzvot&quot;, it is believed that the Jewish people will become a model society. This idea sometimes is attributed to Biblical verses that describe the Jews as &quot;a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&quot; () and &quot;a light of the nations&quot; or &quot;a light to the nations&quot; ( and ). The philosophies of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, and Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag are prominent in this field, the former rationally and in terms of a &quot;kehilla&quot; (community) of Jews in &quot;galut&quot; (the diaspora) influencing their non-Jewish neighbors, and the latter mystically and in Zionist terms of a Jewish state influencing the other nations of the world. Some other Orthodox rabbis, many but not all of them Modern Orthodox, follow a philosophy similar to Hirsch&#x27;s, including Joseph H. Hertz, Isidore Epstein, and Eliezer Berkovits. The philosophy of Religious Zionism follows Kook in his philosophy.

In Modern Orthodox philosophy (which often is intertwined with Religious Zionism, especially in America), it is commonly believed that &quot;mitzvot&quot; have practical this-worldly sociological and educational effects on those who perform them, and in this manner, the &quot;mitzvot&quot; will perfect the Jews and the world.

According to the rationalist philosophy of Hirsch and others, the social and ethical &quot;mitzvot&quot; have nearly self-explanatory purposes, while ritual &quot;mitzvot&quot; may serve functions such as educating people or developing relationships between people and God. As examples, prayer either inculcates a relationship between people and God or strengthens beliefs and faith of the one who prays, and keeping kosher or wearing &quot;tzitzit&quot; serve as educational symbols of moral and religious values. Thus, the ultimate goal of &quot;mitzvot&quot; is for moral and religious values and deeds to permeate the Jewish people and ultimately the entire world, but the ritual &quot;mitzvot&quot; nevertheless play a vital role in this model of &quot;tikkun olam&quot;, strengthening what is accomplished by the ethical.

Hirsch&#x27;s &quot;Horeb&quot; is an especially important source, as his exposition of his philosophy of the &quot;mitzvot&quot;. He classifies the &quot;mitzvot&quot; into six categories:
* (1) &quot;toroth&quot; (philosophical doctrines);
* The ethical &quot;mitzvot&quot; fall under (2) &quot;mishpatim&quot; and (3) &quot;chukim&quot; (commandments of justice towards (living) people and the natural world (including the human body itself) respectively) and (4) &quot;mitzvot&quot; (commandments of love);
* The ritual &quot;mitzvot&quot; under (5) &quot;edoth&quot; (educational symbolic commandments) and (6) &quot;avodah&quot; (commandments of direct service to God).

Aside from the fact that by perfecting themselves, the Jews set an example for the rest of the world, there is thus the additional distinction that mitzvot have practical, worldly effects—for example, charity benefits the poor materially, constituting &quot;tikkun olam&quot; by its improvement of the world physically or socially, in contrast to the mystical effects of &quot;mitzvot&quot; as held by Lurianic Kabbalah.

==Improving the world==

For some Jews, the phrase &quot;tikkun olam&quot; means that Jews are not only responsible for creating a model society among themselves but also are responsible for the welfare of the society at large. This responsibility may be understood in religious, social or political terms and there are many different opinions about how religion, society, and politics interact.

Jane Kanarek, a Conservative rabbi, argues that discussions of &quot;tikkun olam&quot; in the Mishnah and Talmud point to the importance of creating systemic change through law.  She concludes that contemporary tikkun olam should also focus on systemic and structural changes to society.

While many non-Orthodox Jews have argued that tikkun olam requires socially liberal politics, some have argued for the validity of a conservative political approach to tikkun olam. Michael Spiro, a Reconstructionist Jew, draws on a conservative tradition that emphasizes free markets precisely because they believed that &quot;was&quot; the path to the greatest public good. In addition, conservatives have always emphasized the importance of &quot;private&quot; efforts of &quot;gemilut chasadim&quot; (benevolence) and &quot;tzedakah&quot; (charity or philanthropy), and Spiro argues that tikkun olam should be carried out through such private efforts rather than through government.

== Jewish youth organizations ==
&quot;Tikkun olam&quot; is used to refer to Jewish obligations to engage in social action in the Reform and Conservative movements as well. For example, in USY, the Conservative youth movement, the position in charge of social action on chapter and regional boards is called the SA/TO (social action/tikkun olam) officer. Furthermore, USY has the Abraham Joshua Heschel Honor Society. A requirement of acceptance to the honor society is to perform one act of community service a month. In NFTY, the American branch of Netzer Olami, the Reform youth movement, the position in charge of social action on chapter and regional boards is called the social action vice president (SAVP).

In addition, other youth organizations have also grown to include &quot;tikkun olam&quot; has part of its foundation. BBYO has community service/social action commitments in both of its divisions, AZA and BBG. BBG includes two different programming areas specific to &quot;tikkun olam&quot;—one for community service, and another for social action. AZA includes a combined community service/social action programming area. In addition, both divisions include &quot;pledge principles&quot;, principles by which to guide them. For BBG girls the &quot;menorah pledge principles&quot; include citizenship, philanthropy, and community service. For AZA members, the &quot;7 cardinal principles&quot; include charity.

==Jewish fundamentalism==
Elon University professor Geoffrey Claussen has asserted that concepts of &quot;tikkun olam&quot; have inspired Jewish fundamentalists such as the convicted terrorist Meir Kahane and monarchist Yitzchak Ginsburgh. According to Claussen, &quot;while visions of &quot;tikkun olam&quot; may reflect humility, thoughtfulness, and justice, they are often marked by arrogance, overzealousness, and injustice.&quot;

<text>In architecture, a pendentive is a constructional device permitting the placing of a circular dome over a square room or of an elliptical dome over a rectangular room. The pendentives, which are triangular segments of a sphere, taper to points at the bottom and spread at the top to establish the continuous circular or elliptical base needed for a dome. In masonry the pendentives thus receive the weight of the dome, concentrating it at the four corners where it can be received by the piers beneath.

Prior to the pendentive&#x27;s development, builders used the device of corbelling or squinches in the corners of a room. Pendentives commonly occurred in Orthodox, Renaissance, and Baroque churches, with a drum with windows often inserted between the pendentives and the dome. The first experimentation with pendentives began with Roman dome construction in the 2nd–3rd century AD, while full development of the form came in the 6th-century Eastern Roman cathedral, Hagia Sophia, in Constantinople (Istanbul).

<doc id="641111" wikidata="Q1053358" url="?curid=641111" title=".dwg">
<text>DWG (from &quot;drawing&quot;) is a proprietary binary file format used for storing two- and three- dimensional design data and metadata. It is the native format for several CAD packages including DraftSight, AutoCAD, ZWCAD, IntelliCAD (and its variants), Caddie and Open Design Alliance compliant applications. In addition, DWG is supported non-natively by many other CAD applications. The .bak (drawing backup), .dws (drawing standards), .dwt (drawing template) and .sv$ (temporary automatic save) files are also DWG files.

== Version history ==

==History==
DWG (denoted by the .dwg filename extension) was the native file format for the Interact CAD package, developed by Mike Riddle in the late 1970s, and subsequently licensed by Autodesk in 1982 as the basis for AutoCAD. From 1982 to 2009, Autodesk created versions of AutoCAD which wrote no fewer than 18 major variants of the DWG file format, none of which is publicly documented.

The DWG format is probably the most widely used format for CAD drawings. Autodesk estimates that in 1998 there were in excess of two billion DWG files in existence.

There are several claims to control of the DWG format. As the biggest and most influential creator of DWG files it is Autodesk who designs, defines, and iterates the DWG format as the native format for their CAD applications. Autodesk sells a read/write library, called RealDWG, under selective licensing terms for use in non-competitive applications. Several companies have attempted to reverse engineer Autodesk&#x27;s DWG format, and offer software libraries to read and write Autodesk DWG files. The most successful is Open Design Alliance, a non-profit consortium created in 1998 by a number of software developers (including competitors to Autodesk); it released a read/write/view library called the OpenDWG Toolkit, which was based on the MarComp AUTODIRECT libraries. (ODA has since rewritten and updated that code.)

In 1998, Autodesk added file verification to AutoCAD R14.01, through a function called DWGCHECK. This function was supported by an encrypted checksum and product code (called a &quot;watermark&quot; by Autodesk), written into DWG files created by the program. In 2006 Autodesk modified AutoCAD 2007, to include &quot;TrustedDWG technology&quot;, a function which would embed a text string within DWG files written by the program: &quot;Autodesk DWG. This file is a Trusted DWG last saved by an Autodesk application or Autodesk licensed application.&quot; This helped Autodesk software users ensure that the files they were opening were created by an Autodesk, or RealDWG application, reducing risk of incompatibilities. AutoCAD would pop up a message, warning of potential stability problems, if a user opened a 2007 version DWG file which did not include this text string.

In 2008 the Free Software Foundation asserted the need for an open replacement for the DWG format, as neither RealDWG nor DWGdirect are licensed on terms that are compatible with free software license like the GNU GPL. Therefore, the FSF placed the goal &#x27;Replacement for OpenDWG libraries&#x27; in 10th place on their High Priority Free Software Projects list. Created in late 2009, GNU LibreDWG is a free software library released under the terms of the GNU GPLv3 license. It can read DWG files from version R13 up to 2021, and write R2000 DWG files.

Also in 2008 Autodesk and Bentley Systems agreed on exchange of software libraries, including Autodesk RealDWG, to improve the ability to read and write the companies&#x27; respective DWG and DGN formats in mixed environments with greater fidelity. 
In addition, the two companies will facilitate work process interoperability between their AEC applications through supporting the reciprocal use of available Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

=== Autodesk trademark ===

On November 13, 2006, Autodesk sued the Open Design Alliance alleging that its DWGdirect libraries infringed Autodesk&#x27;s trademark for the word &quot;Autodesk&quot;, by writing the TrustedDWG watermark (including the word &quot;AutoCAD&quot;) into DWG files it created. Nine days later, Autodesk&#x27;s attorneys won a broad and deep temporary restraining order against the Open Design Alliance. In April 2007, the suit was settled, essentially on Autodesk&#x27;s terms, with Autodesk modifying the warning message in AutoCAD 2008 (to make it somewhat less alarming), and the Open Design Alliance removing support for writing the TrustedDWG watermark from its DWGdirect libraries. The effect of the temporary restraining order and subsequent consent decree was to render the Open Design Alliance&#x27;s DWGdirect libraries, from one point of view, incapable of creating DWG files that are 100% compatible with AutoCAD Unsubstantiated claim. Others point out that the failure of &quot;100% compatibility&quot; means only that loading such a drawing triggers an essentially irrelevant warning message when the file is opened in AutoCAD.

In 2006, Autodesk applied for registration of US trademarks on &quot;DWG&quot;, &quot;DWG EXTREME&quot;, &quot;DWG TRUECONVERT&quot;, &quot;REALDWG&quot;, &quot;DWGX&quot;, &quot;DWG TRUEVIEW&quot;.
As early as 1996, Autodesk has disclaimed exclusive use of the DWG mark in US trademark filings. Out of these applications, only TRUSTEDDWG has been registered as a trademark by the USPTO. The REALDWG and DWGX registrations were opposed by SolidWorks. The DWG EXTREME, DWG TRUECONVERT, and DWG TRUEVIEW trademark registration applications all received substantial resistance, with the USPTO examining attorney requiring Autodesk to disclaim exclusive use of DWG as a condition for their registration.

In a non-final action in May 2007, the USPTO examining attorney refused to register the two DWG marks, as they are &quot;merely descriptive&quot; of the use of DWG as a file format name. In September 2007, Autodesk responded, claiming that DWG has gained a &quot;secondary meaning,&quot; separate from its use as a generic file format name.

As of June 22, 2008, all of Autodesk&#x27;s DWG-related trademark registration proceedings were suspended by the USPTO, pending disposition of trademark opposition and cancellation petitions Autodesk had filed against the Open Design Alliance and Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks Corporation. The USPTO office actions notifying Autodesk of this noted that Autodesk was not the exclusive source of files with the format name DWG, and Autodesk does not control the use of DWG by others, either as a trademark or as a file format name, among other points.

In 2006, Autodesk filed an opposition with the USPTO to the trademark registration of DWGGATEWAY by SolidWorks. Autodesk subsequently filed a petition for cancellation of SolidWorks&#x27; trademark registration for DWGEDITOR. In both cases, Autodesk&#x27;s basis was that they had &quot;been using the DWG name with its CAD software products since at least as early as 1983.&quot; The opposition and cancellation actions were consolidated, and suspended pending disposition of Autodesk&#x27;s US District Court suit against SolidWorks.

In early 2007, Autodesk petitioned the USPTO to cancel the Open Design Alliance&#x27;s &quot;OpenDWG&quot; trademarks, claiming that they had been abandoned. This cancellation action was suspended pending disposition of Autodesk&#x27;s US District Court suit against SolidWorks.

In 2008, Autodesk sued SolidWorks in US District Court, arguing that through its marketing efforts, the term &quot;DWG&quot; has lost its original generic meaning and taken on a secondary meaning referring specifically to Autodesk&#x27;s proprietary drawing file format, and therefore any use of &quot;DWG&quot; in competitive products amounted to trademark infringement. In January 2010, on the morning that trial was scheduled to begin, Autodesk and SolidWorks settled the suit, with SolidWorks acknowledging Autodesk&#x27;s trademark rights for DWG, surrendering its trademark registrations for its DWG related projects, and withdrawing its opposition to Autodesk&#x27;s DWG-related trademark registrations.

In April 2010, Autodesk and the Open Design Alliance settled their suit, with the Open Design Alliance agreeing to cancel its DWG-based trademark registrations and cease use of DWG and DWG-based trademarks in its product marketing and branding. Because there was no adjudication in either case, the agreements between the parties are not binding upon the USPTO. In March 2010, the Office of the Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy at the USPTO determined that evidence submitted by the Open Design Alliance two years earlier was relevant and supported a reasonable ground for refusal to register DWG as a trademark.

In June 2011 the USPTO issued a final refusal to register DWG as a trademark owned by Autodesk. They were quoted as saying:

Autodesk appealed the decision. The USPTO affirmed in 2013 their refusal to recognise DWG as a trademark. Despite this, Autodesk websites still claimed DWG as a trademark after the decision.

In late 2014 Autodesk again lost, this time at the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The judge dismissed all their arguments.

In 2015 Autodesk&#x27;s website has a section title &quot;About DWG&quot; in which they try to make a distinction between .dwg as a file format and the &quot;DWG technology environment&quot;.

== DWG support in freemium and free software ==
As neither RealDWG nor DWGdirect are licensed on terms that are compatible with free software licenses like the GNU GPL, in 2008 the Free Software Foundation asserted the need for an open replacement for the DWG format. Therefore, the FSF placed the goal &#x27;Replacement for OpenDWG libraries&#x27; in 10th place on their High Priority Free Software Projects list. Forked in late 2009 from libDWG, GNU LibreDWG can read all DWG files from version R13 on. But the LibreDWG library, offered under the GNU GPLv3, could initially not be used by most targeted FOSS graphic software, such as FreeCAD, LibreCAD and Blender, because of a GPLv2/GPLv3 license incompatibility. A GPLv2 licensed alternative is the libdxfrw project, which can read simple DWGs. Some of these CAD licenses were only fixed recently to be able to use LibreDWG&#x27;s GPLv3.

FreeCAD is a free and open-source application that can work with the DWG files by using the proprietary ODA File Converter for .dwg and .dxf files from the Open Design Alliance (ODA). The ODA also provides a freeware stand-alone viewer for .dwg and .dgn files, ODA Drawings Explorer, which runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

LibreCAD is a free and open-source 2D CAD application that can open DWG and DXF files using its own library.

Autodesk DWG TrueView is a freeware, closed source, stand-alone DWG viewer with DWG TrueConvert software included, built on the same viewing engine as AutoCAD software. The freeware Autodesk Design Review software adds a possibility to open DWG files in Design Review to take advantage of measure and markup capabilities, sheet set organization, and status tracking.

<doc id="641118" wikidata="Q639120" url="?curid=641118" title="Félix Rodríguez (soldier)">
<text>Félix Ismael Rodríguez Mendigutia (born 31 May 1941) is a Cuban American former Central Intelligence Agency Paramilitary Operations Officer in the Special Activities Division, known for his involvement in the Bay of Pigs Invasion and the execution of communist revolutionary Che Guevara as well as his close ties to George H. W. Bush during the Iran–Contra affair.

==Early life==
Rodríguez came from a family of land owners in his native Cuba. His uncle was the Minister of Public Works during Fulgencio Batista&#x27;s government.

He attended the Perkiomen School in Pennsylvania but dropped out to join the Anti-Communist League of the Caribbean, which had been created by Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo with the intention of overthrowing the Cuban government.

The invasion of Cuba was a failure, and Rodríguez returned to Perkiomen. He graduated in June 1960 and went to live with his parents in Miami, where thousands of Cuban exiles had moved.

In September 1960, he joined a group of Cuban exiles in Guatemala, supported by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to receive military training. They were called Brigade 2506.

==Bay of Pigs Invasion==
Rodriguez participated in the Bay of Pigs invasion as a paramilitary operations officer with the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division. He clandestinely entered Cuba a few weeks before the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. Using his familiarity with the country, he was able to gather critical intelligence, which was used in the planning and preparation of the invasion.

==Bolivia==


In 1967, the CIA again recruited Rodríguez to train and head a team to hunt down Che Guevara, who was attempting to overthrow the US-backed government in Bolivia and to replace it with a communist government.

The last photograph of Guevara alive includes Rodriguez standing by his side, but according to Dino Brugioni, a former senior official at the CIA&#x27;s National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC), it is a photomontage.

==Vietnam==
He became a US citizen in 1969. During his career with the CIA, he also went by the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; &quot;Max Gomez&quot; after Máximo Gómez, the Dominican general who fought in the Cuban War of Independence. He was awarded the Intelligence Star for Valor by the CIA and nine Crosses for Gallantry by the South Vietnamese government. He was codenamed Lazarus after his survival of the Bay of Pigs operation.

During the Vietnam War, Rodríguez flew over 300 helicopter missions and was shot down five times. In 1971, Rodríguez trained Provincial Reconnaissance Units (PRUs). They were CIA-sponsored units that worked for the Phoenix Program. The Walsh Report states (Chapter 29): &quot;During the Vietnam War, [Donald] Gregg supervised CIA officer Felix Rodriguez and they kept in contact following the war.&quot; Rodríguez also reported to Ted Shackley during the Phoenix Program. Shackley became Bush&#x27;s top aide for operations when he directed the CIA, and Gregg later became National Security Advisor for Vice-President Bush. Rodríguez was in frequent contact with him regarding arms for the Contras.

In 1970, after the Cambodian incursion, Bien Hoa CIA Spymaster Orrin DeForrest worked with Rodríguez, whom he described as &quot;the CIA&#x27;s hotshot pilot,&quot; and his PRU in rolling up the Viet Cong stronghold of An Tinh in South Vietnam. Rodríguez flew above the village in a Loach light helicopter and marked target houses holding VC suspects with orange smoke, and the PRU then went in and emptied the houses of occupants, lined them up, and identified suspects with the assistance of a former VC leader who had been captured before he began to co-operate with the CIA; DeForrest identified him as &quot;Ba Tung.&quot; The operation netted 28 VC cadre who had been living openly among the South Vietnamese but were working to assist the North Vietnamese overthrow their southern neighbors. The mass arrest and detention of Subregion One VC cadre was the largest operation of its type during the war and, for all intents and purposes, broke the VC hold on its stronghold of An Tinh.

==Iran-Contra affair==
There is extensive documentation of Rodríguez&#x27;s ties to US Vice-President George H. W. Bush during the Iran–Contra affair from 1983 to 1988. In September 1986, General John K. Singlaub wrote to Oliver North expressing concern about Rodríguez&#x27;s daily contact with the Bush office and warned of damage to US President Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party. The &quot;Walsh Report&quot; (Chapter 25) stated that M. Charles Hill took notes at a meeting between George Shultz and Elliott Abrams on 16 October 1986 as follows:

Felix Rodriguez [sic] – Bush did know him from CIA days. FR [Rodriguez] is ex-CIA. In El Salv[ador] he goes around to bars saying he is buddy of Bush. A y[ea]r ago Pdx [Poindexter] &amp; Ollie [North] told VP staff stop protecting FR as a friend – we want to get rid of him from his involvnt [sic] w[ith] private ops. Nothing was done so he still is there shooting his mouth off. (brackets are in the original)

Rodríguez met with Donald Gregg, now Bush&#x27;s National Security advisor. The &quot;Walsh Report&quot; (Chapter 29) stated, &quot;Gregg introduced Rodriguez to Vice President Bush in January 1985, and Rodriguez met with the Vice President again in Washington, D.C., in May 1986. He also met Vice President Bush briefly in Miami on May 20, 1986.&quot; Rodríguez also met and spoke with Bush&#x27;s advisor Gregg and his deputy, Colonel Samuel J. Watson III.

On 5 October 1986, the Corporate Air Services C-123, carrying Eugene Hasenfus was shot down over Nicaragua, which killed two US pilots, William H. Cooper and Wallace B. Sawyer Jr., and one Latin American crewmember. &quot;Rodriguez unsuccessfully attempted to call Gregg to inform him of the missing plane. He reached Watson, who in turn notified the White House Situation Room. The following day, Rodriguez called Watson again and told him that the airplane was one of North&#x27;s.&quot; Hasenfus told reporters that he worked for &quot;Max Gomez,&quot; an alias for Rodríguez, and &quot;Ramon Medina,&quot; an alias for Luis Posada Carriles, of the CIA. On 10 October 1986, Clair George, the head of CIA clandestine operations, testified before Congress that he did not know of any direct connection between Hasenfus and Reagan administration officials. In the fall of 1992, George was convicted on two charges of false statements and perjury before Congress but was pardoned on Christmas Eve that year by President Bush.

==Allegations regarding Kiki Camarena==
In October 2013, two former DEA agents and a pilot who allegedly flew for the CIA claimed to the Mexican journal &quot;Proceso&quot; and to the US network &quot;Fox News&quot; that the CIA had been &quot;complicit&quot; in the murder of DEA agent Enrique &quot;Kiki&quot; Camarena in 1985 and that Rodríguez had played a role. The alleged motive for the crime was that Camarena had supposedly discovered that the US government had collaborated with the Guadalajara Cartel in the importation and the transfer of drugs from Colombia to the United States via Mexico to use the proceeds to sponsor the Contras in Nicaragua in its war against the Sandinista government. Phil Jordan, a former director of the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC); Héctor Berrellez, a former agent of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration who directed Operation Leyenda to clarify the murder; and Tosh Plumlee, allegedly a former pilot for the CIA, claim to have the evidence that the US government itself ordered the capture and interrogation of Camarena, which led to his torture and death.

In July 2020, the documentary &quot;The Last Narc&quot; shows the testimonies of people like Héctor Berrellez, Phil Jordan, Mike Holm (a member of the DEA for 24 years), Manny Medrano (former assistant US Attorney and lead prosecutor in Camarena case) as well as Camarena&#x27;s widow and three former police officers and former bodyguards of Ernesto Fonseca. The documentary explores the claims of the details of the torture and the interrogation, including some of the questions that Rodríguez allegedly asked Camarena in relation to the association that the CIA had allegedly reached with the Guadalajara cartel to bring cocaine into the US, the final goal being to finance the Nicaraguan Contras.

In 2013, Jack Lawn, a former head of the DEA, and retired Special Agent Jack Taylor, who investigated the murder, said the CIA had no involvement in Camarena&#x27;s death. Without mentioning any agents by name, Jack Lawn also stated that &quot;this is [a] fable not worthy of individuals who would serve in DEA.&quot; A CIA spokesperson told &quot;Fox News&quot; that &quot;it&#x27;s ridiculous to suggest that the CIA had anything to do with the murder of a U.S. federal agent or the escape of his killer.&quot;

==Activism==
 In 2004, Rodríguez became president of the Brigade 2506 Veterans Association, a group for Bay of Pigs Invasion survivors.

During the 2004 US presidential election, Rodríguez was highly critical of the Democratic presidential candidate, John Kerry, in part because of their previous meeting at a Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics hearing in 1987 during which Rodríguez was questioned by Kerry about allegations of soliciting a $10 million donation from a Colombian cocaine cartel. The story, which was eventually shown to be false, had come from Ramón Milian Rodríguez, a convicted money launderer from Colombia.

In 2005, Rodríguez oversaw the opening of the Bay of Pigs Museum and Library in Little Havana, Florida, and became the chairman of the board of directors.

<doc id="641121" wikidata="Q444259" url="?curid=641121" title="Typecasting">
<text>In film, television, and theatre, typecasting is the process by which a particular actor becomes strongly identified with a specific character, one or more particular roles, or characters having the same traits or coming from the same social or ethnic groups. There have been instances in which an actor has been so strongly identified with a role as to make it difficult for them to find work playing other characters.

==Character actors==
Actors are sometimes so strongly identified with a role as to make it difficult for them to find work playing other characters. It is especially common among leading actors in popular television series and films.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===
One example of typecasting occurred with the cast of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. During &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s original run from 1966 to 1969, William Shatner was the highest-paid cast member at $5,000 per episode ($ today), with Leonard Nimoy and the other actors being paid much less. The press predicted that Nimoy would be a star after the series ended, and James Doohan expected that appearing on an NBC series would help his post-&quot;Star Trek&quot; career. The series so typecast the actors, however—as early as March 1970, Nichelle Nichols complained of &quot;Star Trek&quot; having &quot;defined [her] so narrowly as an actress&quot;, and Doohan said in 1976 that even producers he worked for before &quot;Star Trek&quot; now told his agent &quot;I don&#x27;t want a Scotsman&quot;—that only Shatner and Nimoy continued working steadily throughout the 1970s, and even their work received little attention unless it was &quot;Star Trek&quot;-related.

Walter Koenig in 1976 noted the disparity between the adulation from Trekkies at &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions and his obscurity in Hollywood. Residuals from the series ended in 1971; Koenig, Doohan, and DeForest Kelley discussed the paradox of starring in what Kelley described as &quot;the most popular series in the world&quot; because of reruns, but &quot;not getting paid for it&quot;. Cast members&#x27; income came mostly from personal appearances at conventions; by 1978 Kelley, for example, earned up to $50,000 ($ today) annually. In 1979, the first of six films starring the cast appeared; Kelley earned $1 million for the final film, &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1991).

&quot;Parade&quot; stated of the cast, &quot;They are &#x27;stars&#x27; only in the world of &quot;Star Trek&quot; ... [They] lost control of their destinies the minute they stepped on the bridge of the make-believe &quot;Enterprise&quot; in 1966&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed in 1991 that &quot;For most of the actors in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, Starfleet has never been far off the professional horizons.&quot; Being identified so closely with one role left the series&#x27; cast with mixed emotions; Shatner called it &quot;awesome and irksome&quot;. Koenig called it &quot;bittersweet ... People are interested in Chekov, not me&quot;, but admitted that there was &quot;a certain immortality in being associated with &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot;. Doohan said that being part of a &quot;classic&quot; was &quot;beautiful. Your great-grandchildren will still be seeing &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot;.

Some of the &quot;Next Generation&quot; actors also became typecast. Patrick Stewart recalled that a &quot;distinguished Hollywood director I wanted to work for said to me &#x27;Why would I want Captain Picard in my movie?&#x27; That was painful&quot;. His most prominent non-&quot;Star Trek&quot; film or television role, Professor X in the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series, shares similarities to Jean-Luc Picard. Stewart has stated &quot;I don&#x27;t have a film career. I have a franchise career&quot;; he continues to work on stage as a Shakespearean actor. &quot;The Next Generation&quot; had one of the largest budgets of its time, and the cast became very wealthy. Jonathan Frakes stated that &quot;it&#x27;s better to be type-cast than not to be cast at all.&quot; Michael Dorn said in 1991, &quot;If what happened to the first cast is called being typecast, then I want to be typecast. Of course, they didn&#x27;t get the jobs after &#x27;Trek.&#x27; But they are making their sixth movie. Name me someone else in television who has made &quot;six&quot; movies!&quot;

===Other examples===
John Larroquette said that after winning four consecutive Emmy Awards, &quot;it was 10 years after &quot;Night Court&quot; ended before I got a role as a dad. Because Dan Fielding was such a bizarre character, he had made such an impression, that typecasting does happen. Every role was some sleazy lawyer or some sleazy this or some sleazy that.&quot; During his years on the comedy &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, Ed O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s scenes were cut from the film drama &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot; (1991) after a test audience laughed when he was on the screen.

Jon Hamm stated that after the success of &quot;Mad Men&quot;, he received &quot;about 40 scripts that were all set in the 60s, or had me playing advertising guys&quot; like his character Don Draper.

Clayton Moore, who played the Lone Ranger in the Golden Age of Television, embraced his typecasting, stating that he had &quot;fallen in love&quot; with the character of Lone Ranger, and regularly appeared in public in character, to the point that Jack Wrather, who owned the character, issued a cease and desist order to Moore in 1979. The dispute was dropped in 1984 and Moore resumed his appearances. In a similar case, Alan Hale Jr. parlayed his fame as Skipper Jonas Grumby on &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; into a seafood restaurant and a travel agency that offered three-hour boat tours.

Jonathan Frakes&#x27; sentiments about typecasting were echoed by Ben McKenzie, who became a star in the role of Ryan Atwood in &quot;The O.C.&quot; at age 24, after two years of seeking acting work in New York City and Los Angeles. Eleven years later, after starring in two more television series playing what &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as a &quot;quiet, guarded leading man&quot;, McKenzie said that &quot;if you are being stereotyped, that means you have something to stereotype. So they&#x27;re casting you. That is an amazing thing. That is a gift. Worry about being pigeonholed in your 50s.&quot;

Daniel Radcliffe was cast as Harry Potter at age eleven, playing the character over ten years in an eight-film franchise. Radcliffe was thus faced with two transitions: moving from child actor to adult star and moving from being typecast as Potter to playing other roles. His career following the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; franchise has included appearing on stage, as in Martin McDonagh&#x27;s &quot;The Cripple of Inishmaan&quot;; in independent films such as &quot;Kill Your Darlings&quot;, in which he played Allen Ginsberg; and major studio films like &quot;Victor Frankenstein&quot;, in which he played the hunchback Igor, and romantic comedies like &quot;The F Word&quot; (released in some countries as &quot;What If?&quot;).
Peter Robbins largely left acting after aging out of his most famous role, the voice of Charlie Brown. He retained a strong affection for the role throughout his life, including having a tattoo of the character.

===Historical-real characters===
Soviet actor Mikheil Gelovani depicted Joseph Stalin in 12 films made during the leader&#x27;s lifetime, which reflected his cult of personality. Among them were &quot;The Great Dawn&quot; (1938), &quot;Lenin in 1918&quot; (1939), &quot;The Vow&quot; (1946), &quot;The Fall of Berlin&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Unforgettable Year 1919&quot; (1952). These films were either banned or had the scenes featuring Stalin removed after the 1956 Secret Speech. Following Stalin&#x27;s death, Gelovani was denied new roles since he was so closely identified with Stalin. According to &quot;The Guinness Book of Movie Facts and Feats&quot;, Gelovani had probably portrayed the same historical figure more than any other actor. &quot;Die Zeit&quot; columnist Andreas Kilb wrote that he ended his life &quot;a pitiful &quot;Kagemusha&quot;&quot; of Stalin&#x27;s image.

Vaughn Meader is another example, as he depicted President John F. Kennedy in the 1962 comedy record &quot;The First Family&quot;. Meader&#x27;s career success came to an abrupt end after President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination on November 22, 1963. Meader&#x27;s TV and nightclub bookings were all canceled. His career never rebounded as he was too closely associated with President Kennedy and his attempts to critize his typecasting also led to his indirect blacklisting.

==Playing against type==
Some actors attempt to avoid or escape typecasting by taking on roles that are opposite the types of roles that they are known for.

* Pat Morita was known for his comedic roles in his early acting career, particularly as Arnold in the American TV sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;. The casting directors of &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984) were initially opposed to casting Morita as Mr. Miyagi, a serious role, due to Morita&#x27;s background in comedy.
* Jackie Chan was originally known for playing heroic and physically comedic roles in action and adventure films across over three decades. He was cast against type for a serious role as a Chinese immigrant opposite Pierce Brosnan as a corrupted Irish politician in the 2017 thriller &quot;The Foreigner&quot;, for which Chan garnered critical acclaim.
* Bryan Cranston had originally played the immature, childish character Hal on &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;. When Vince Gilligan approached AMC about his plan to cast Cranston as the morally dubious Walter White in &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, the network was opposed to his casting in light of his previous comedic work.
* Tom Cruise was typically known for playing heroes before director Michael Mann cast him as an amoral hitman in &quot;Collateral&quot; (2004).
* Tony Curtis was known as &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s most handsome matinee idol&quot;; as such, he was cast against type when he played serial killer Albert DeSalvo in &quot;The Boston Strangler&quot; (1968).
* Matt Damon was at first best known for his dramatic performance skills, as showcased in &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997), before being cast against type as the action hero Jason Bourne in the &quot;Bourne&quot; films.
* Christian Bale was offered the role of Patrick Bateman in &quot;American Psycho&quot; (2000). People warned him that playing this role would be a &quot;career suicide&quot;. He said, &quot;A lot of people would talk about Anthony Perkins in &quot;Psycho&quot; and say, you know once you play a villain like that, you never get to play anything else because you&#x27;re stuck in everybody&#x27;s imagination as that person.&quot; Bale however, went on to play the role and it turned out to be a breakthrough film for him, cementing his status as a mainstream performer. Similarly, when he was offered the role of Batman in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005), he was warned that he would be forever known as only Batman and would have trouble getting roles. The Dark Knight Trilogy turned out to be a blockbuster and Bale&#x27;s performance was appreciated. Since then, Bale has starred in critically acclaimed films, including &quot;The Fighter&quot; (2010) and &quot;The Big Short&quot; (2015), earning Academy Award nominations for both of them, winning for the former.
* Henry Fonda, best known for playing morally upright, everyman heroes, was cast by director Sergio Leone to play a sadistic villain in the Western &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; (1968). Film critic Roger Ebert argued that much of the principal cast in &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; were cast against type: &quot;Fonda is the bad guy for once in his career; Charles Bronson is impressively inscrutable as the mysterious good guy; and Jason Robards is a tough guy, believe it or not.&quot;
* Ice-T, who achieved fame as a gangsta rap artist early in his career, garnered critical acclaim for his subsequent acting roles as police detectives in &quot;New Jack City&quot; (1991) and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;.
* Gordon Jump, often typecast as milquetoast characters such as Arthur Carlson on &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, took on the role of a child molester in the very special episode &quot;The Bicycle Man&quot; on &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;. Jump considered the role &quot;one of my most painful but rewarding parts,&quot; and the casting against type was noted as a standout moment in Jump&#x27;s career.
* Michael Keaton had previously starred primarily in successful feel-good comedies before director Tim Burton cast him as Bruce Wayne / Batman in the dark action-drama &quot;Batman&quot; (1989).
* Matthew McConaughey, who, after making several romantic comedies, sought other, more dramatic film roles. He appeared in a supporting role in &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; and starred in &quot;Interstellar&quot; and &quot;Dallas Buyers Club&quot;, receiving critical acclaim in all three films and winning the Academy Award for Best Actor for the latter. This change in the direction of his career has been dubbed the &quot;McConaissance&quot;, and is considered a remarkable career turnaround.
* Glenn Milstead had almost exclusively performed as a woman under his drag queen persona, Divine, performing mostly in the works of John Waters. In 1985, he appeared in what would his be his only male role in &quot;Trouble in Mind&quot;, a role written for him but against his usual drag type. A second male role in &quot;Married... with Children&quot; was never filmed, as Milstead died after rehearsals but before taping.
* Leslie Nielsen had an established career as a dramatic actor since the 1950s before appearing in the successful comedy film &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980), specifically due to the gravitas he was able to bring to the satire. This prompted a career reinvention that saw Nielsen go on to helm the &quot;Police Squad!&quot; series and &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; trilogy. Reflecting on his against-type casting, Nielsen later stated that he always felt more comfortable as a deadpan comedic performer and embraced being typecast in that style the rest of his life.
* George Peppard was typecast in &quot;tough-guy&quot; film roles following his portrayal of a young playboy and megalomaniacal tycoon in the 1964 film &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot;. His career as a traditional leading man had been fading at the time by 1983, when he accepted the lead role in the TV series &quot;The A-Team&quot;, as the wisecracking, cigar-smoking head of a team of wanted commandos. Peppard stated he had wanted to transition into character actor roles but had never been given the opportunity until &quot;The A-Team&quot;.
* Tyler Perry is a comedian best known for his comedy. He was cast against type as Tanner Bolt, a lawyer who specializes in defending men accused of killing their wives, in &quot;Gone Girl&quot; (2014).
* Bob Saget began his career as a particularly vulgar stand-up comic. In the late 1980s, he was cast against type on television as the squeaky-clean Danny Tanner on &quot;Full House&quot;, which led to him also hosting the family-friendly &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;. Despite his new reputation as &quot;America&#x27;s Dad&quot; from these roles, Saget maintained his vulgar stand-up routine for the rest of his life and played the contrast between the two types for laughs, which is credited with keeping his appeal fresh among the young adults (millennials) who watched him as children.
* Adam Sandler is best known for his comedy roles, in which he typically plays an &quot;aggressive man-child&quot; and an &quot;extreme character surrounded by regular people.&quot; Director Paul Thomas Anderson cast Sandler in a dramatic role in &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; (2002), as a man facing psychosis who goes &quot;from understated sorrow to rage and back again.&quot; He again returned to serious work in &quot;The Meyerowitz Stories&quot; (2017), with Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; writing of his role, &quot;With no shtick to fall back on, Sandler is forced to act, and it&#x27;s a glorious thing to watch.&quot;
* While James Stewart was known for his &quot;affable&quot; everyman roles, such as a businessman and father in &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958), he was cast against type as a &quot;troubling or unsettling&quot; character whose &quot;mind unravels&quot; until he attains a &quot;cold, chilling air of sexual paranoia and control.&quot;
* John Wayne, known for playing heroic cowboys/lawmen, played antihero Rooster Cogburn in &quot;True Grit&quot; (1969). Wayne was cast against type several times in his career, including as Genghis Khan in &quot;The Conqueror&quot; (1956).
* Betty White, known for playing the sexually liberated Sue Ann Nivens on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, and Rue McClanahan, who had been known for playing scatterbrained characters such as Vivian Harmon in &quot;Maude&quot; and Fran Crowley in &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, were cast in opposite types in &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;: White played the naïve Rose Nylund, and McClanahan played sultry Southern belle Blanche Devereaux. Bea Arthur, for whom the lead role of Dorothy Zbornak had been conceived, was initially reluctant to join the cast, thinking that the typecasting would prompt viewers to see White and McClanahan as simply continuing their previous roles, but the &quot;flip-flop&quot; casting of the two types, and the originality of the show&#x27;s premise, convinced her to sign on to the project.
* Robin Williams, a successful comedian and situation comedy actor, was cast against type in &quot;Insomnia&quot; and &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; (both 2002), two films in which he depicted &quot;spine-chilling psychosis&quot; and insanity. He also played the role of a therapist in &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;.
* Chris Evans&#x27; first real success as an actor came by playing a series of character he has called &quot;jocky pricks&quot;: good-looking but mean-spirited men known for their smugness, in films including &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (2005), &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot; (2010), and &quot;What&#x27;s Your Number?&quot;. Evans has commented, &quot;I got cast as a lot of assholes.&quot; He was then cast to play the iconic Captain America, a character that since his introduction in 1940, had exhibited &quot;uncompromising purity&quot; and the &quot;ability to judge the character in others&quot;. After fulfilling a seven-picture contract with Marvel Studios to play the character, which ended with &quot;&quot; (2019), Evans returned to playing villainous characters in films such as &quot;Knives Out&quot; (2019), &quot;The Gray Man&quot; (2022), and &quot;Pain Hustlers&quot; (2023).
* Robert Downey Jr. was known as a critically acclaimed actor, getting nominated for Academy Awards for his role in &quot;Chaplin&quot; and &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;. Then he played Tony Stark / Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe for 11 years from &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008) to &quot;&quot; (2019). Downey Jr feared that he might lose his acting skills by playing the same character for a decade, saying, &quot;You start to wonder if a muscle you have hasn’t atrophied&quot;. Post leaving MCU, Downey starred in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;, as Lewis Strauss, getting critical acclaim for that role and won an Academy Award.
* Jim Carrey, notable for starring in comedies like &quot;Liar Liar&quot; (1997), &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; (1994), and &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot; (1994), played against type in &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; (2004) where he plays a bookish introvert.
* Emma Watson, notable for playing Hermione Granger in Harry Potter series, normally has an image of a good girl. However, she went against her image in &quot;The Bling Ring&quot; (2013), where she played Nicki Moore, a brash and a self-obsessed fame-seeker, for which she got critical acclaim.
* Heath Ledger was only known for his lighthearted or romantic roles in films like &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; (1999), &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2001), and &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (2005). When he was cast as the psychopathic criminal mastermind Joker in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008), it was met with a significant public backlash. However, after the movie released, Ledger&#x27;s performance received widespread critical acclaim, to the point that it has been termed as one of the greatest performances ever. Ledger posthumously received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in the 81st Academy Awards for his role as the Joker.

<text>Rudy Henry Wiebe (born 4 October 1934) is a Canadian author and professor emeritus in the department of English at the University of Alberta since 1992. Rudy Wiebe was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in the year 2000.

==Early life==

Wiebe was born at Speedwell, near Fairholme, Saskatchewan, in what would later become his family&#x27;s chicken barn. For thirteen years he lived in an isolated community of about 250 people, as part of the last generation of homesteaders to settle the Canadian west. He did not speak English until age six since Mennonites at that time customarily spoke Low German at home and standard German in church. He attended the small school three miles from his farm and the Speedwell Mennonite Brethren Church. In 1947, he moved with his family to Coaldale, Alberta.

He received his B.A. in 1956 from the University of Alberta and then studied under a Rotary International Fellowship at the University of Tübingen in West Germany, near Stuttgart. In Germany, he studied literature and theology and travelled to England, Austria, Switzerland and Italy. In 1962, he received a Bachelor of Theology degree from Mennonite Brethren Bible College in Winnipeg, now Canadian Mennonite University.

==Career==
While in Winnipeg, he worked as the editor of the Mennonite Brethren Herald, a position he was asked to leave after the publication of his controversial debut novel &quot;Peace Shall Destroy Many&quot; (1962), the book that heralded a wave of Mennonite literature in the decades that followed.

Wiebe taught at Goshen College in Goshen, Indiana from 1963 to 1967, and taught at the University of Alberta in Edmonton for many decades after that.

In addition to &quot;Peace Shall Destroy Many&quot;, Wiebe&#x27;s novels include &quot;First and Vital Candle&quot; (1966), &quot;The Blue Mountains of China&quot; (1970), &quot;The Temptations of Big Bear&quot; (1973), &quot;The Scorched-wood People&quot; (1977), &quot;The Mad Trapper&quot; (1980), &quot;My Lovely Enemy&quot; (1983), &quot;A Discovery of Strangers&quot; (1994), &quot;Sweeter Than All the World&quot; (2001), and &quot;Come Back&quot; (2014). He has also published collections of short stories, essays, and children&#x27;s books. In 2006 he published a volume of memoirs about his childhood, entitled &quot;Of This Earth: A Mennonite Boyhood in the Boreal Forest.&quot; His work has explored the traditions and struggles of people in the Prairie provinces, both settlers, often Mennonite, and First Nations people.

Wiebe won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for Fiction twice, for &quot;The Temptations of Big Bear&quot; (1973) and &quot;A Discovery of Strangers&quot; (1994). Thomas King says of &quot;The Temptations of Big Bear&quot; that &quot;Wiebe captures the pathos and the emotion of Native people at a certain point in their history and he does it well ... Wiebe points out to us that Canada has not come to terms with Native peoples, that there is unfinished business to attend to.&quot; Wiebe was awarded the Royal Society of Canada&#x27;s Lorne Pierce Medal in 1986. In 2000 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2003 Wiebe was a member of the jury for the Giller Prize. In 2023 Guernica Editions published, &quot;Rudy Wiebe: Essays on His Works&quot; edited by Bianca Lakoseljac which includes 20 articles devoted to Wiebe.

== Personal life ==
In 1958 he married Tena Isaak, with whom he had three children.

<text>Alexander Hill Key (September 21, 1904 – July 25, 1979) was an American science fiction writer who primarily wrote children&#x27;s literature.

==Early life==
Alexander Key was born in 1904 in LaPlatte, Maryland to Alexander Hill and Charlotte (Ryder) Key. The family soon moved to Florida, where he spent the next 6 years of his life. His father owned a sawmill and cotton gin, both of which were burned by night riders shortly before his father&#x27;s death when Key was about six. Between the time of his father&#x27;s death and his mother&#x27;s death in an accident when he was 15, Key attended at least 14 different schools, including a military school in Georgia.

After his mother&#x27;s death, Key was raised by various relatives for the rest of his childhood.

At 18, Key enrolled in the School of the Art Institute in Chicago, Illinois, which he attended between 1921 and 1923.

==Literary work==

Key&#x27;s novel &quot;Escape to Witch Mountain&quot; was made into a popular live-action film by Disney in 1975, with several sequels in the following years. His novel &quot;The Incredible Tide&quot; became an anime series called &quot;Future Boy Conan&quot; in 1978.

Key is known for his portrayals of alien but human-looking people who have tremendously strong psychic/psionic abilities, a close communion with nature, and who can telepathically speak with animals. In his nonfiction book &quot;The Strange White Doves&quot;, he professed his belief that animals are conscious, thinking, feeling, perceiving, independent, and self-aware intelligent beings, and that they have subtle ways of communicating, perhaps via empathy or telepathy. The protagonists of Key&#x27;s books are often ostracized, feared, or persecuted because of their astonishing abilities or extraterrestrial origins, and Key uses this as a clear metaphor for racism and other prejudice.

In several of his novels (most notably &quot;The Case of the Vanishing Boy&quot;), Key portrays some sort of communal withdrawal from society by a group of like-minded individuals. Key sometimes depicted government-sponsored social services for children as inefficient or even counterproductive in its efforts: in &quot;The Forgotten Door&quot;, social services is presented as a clearly undesirable alternative for the protagonist Little Jon, and, in &quot;Escape to Witch Mountain&quot;, Tony and Tia actively flee the system. In both cases, however, it is for a very logical reason: the characters are &quot;not from around here&quot;. All they want to do is go home and, happily, a few of us locals have the decency to help them do so.

The plot of Key&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Meadow&quot; is even more poignant for any reader who has ever been bedridden in a hospital. Its ending in particular is phenomenally optimistic. That was another Alexander Key theme: that good and decent people deserve to escape &quot;to&quot; a place worthy of them.

<text>In probability theory, the Gram–Charlier A series (named in honor of Jørgen Pedersen Gram and Carl Charlier), and the Edgeworth series (named in honor of Francis Ysidro Edgeworth) are series that approximate a probability distribution in terms of its cumulants. The series are the same; but, the arrangement of terms (and thus the accuracy of truncating the series) differ. The key idea of these expansions is to write the characteristic function of the distribution whose probability density function is to be approximated in terms of the characteristic function of a distribution with known and suitable properties, and to recover through the inverse Fourier transform.

==Gram–Charlier A series==
We examine a continuous random variable. Let formula_1 be the characteristic function of its distribution whose density function is , and formula_2 its cumulants. We expand in terms of a known distribution with probability density function , characteristic function formula_3, and cumulants formula_4. The density is generally chosen to be that of the normal distribution, but other choices are possible as well. By the definition of the cumulants, we have (see Wallace, 1958)
:formula_5 and 
:formula_6
which gives the following formal identity:
:formula_7

By the properties of the Fourier transform, formula_8 is the Fourier transform of formula_9, where is the differential operator with respect to . Thus, after changing formula_10 with formula_11 on both sides of the equation, we find for the formal expansion

:formula_12

If is chosen as the normal density 

:formula_13 

with mean and variance as given by , that is, mean formula_14 and variance formula_15, then the expansion becomes

:formula_16

since formula_17 for all &gt; 2, as higher cumulants of the normal distribution are 0. By expanding the exponential and collecting terms according to the order of the derivatives, we arrive at the Gram–Charlier A series. Such an expansion can be written compactly in terms of Bell polynomials as

:formula_18

Since the n-th derivative of the Gaussian function formula_19 is given in terms of Hermite polynomial as

:formula_20

this gives us the final expression of the Gram–Charlier A series as

:formula_21

Integrating the series gives us the cumulative distribution function 

:formula_22

where formula_23 is the CDF of the normal distribution. 

If we include only the first two correction terms to the normal distribution, we obtain

:formula_24

with formula_25 and formula_26. 

Note that this expression is not guaranteed to be positive, and is therefore not a valid probability distribution. The Gram–Charlier A series diverges in many cases of interest—it converges only if formula_27 falls off faster than formula_28 at infinity (Cramér 1957). When it does not converge, the series is also not a true asymptotic expansion, because it is not possible to estimate the error of the expansion. For this reason, the Edgeworth series (see next section) is generally preferred over the Gram–Charlier A series.

==The Edgeworth series==
Edgeworth developed a similar expansion as an improvement to the central limit theorem. The advantage of the Edgeworth series is that the error is controlled, so that it is a true asymptotic expansion.

Let formula_29 be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with finite mean formula_30 and variance formula_31, and let formula_32 be their standardized sums:

:formula_33

Let formula_34 denote the cumulative distribution functions of the variables formula_32. Then by the central limit theorem,
: formula_36

for every formula_10, as long as the mean and variance are finite.

The standardization of formula_29 ensures that the first two cumulants of formula_32 are formula_40 and formula_41 Now assume that, in addition to having mean formula_30 and variance formula_31, the i.i.d. random variables formula_44 have higher cumulants formula_45. From the additivity and homogeneity properties of cumulants, the cumulants of formula_32 in terms of the cumulants of formula_44 are for formula_48, 

:formula_49

If we expand the formal expression of the characteristic function formula_50 of formula_34 in terms of the standard normal distribution, that is, if we set

:formula_52

then the cumulant differences in the expansion are

:formula_53
:formula_54
:formula_55

The Gram–Charlier A series for the density function of formula_32 is now

:formula_57

The Edgeworth series is developed similarly to the Gram–Charlier A series, only that now terms are collected according to powers of formula_58. The coefficients of &quot;n&quot;−&quot;m&quot;/2 term can be obtained by collecting the monomials of the Bell polynomials corresponding to the integer partitions of &quot;m&quot;. Thus, we have the characteristic function as

:formula_59

where formula_60 is a polynomial of degree formula_61. Again, after inverse Fourier transform, the density function formula_62 follows as

:formula_63

Likewise, integrating the series, we obtain the distribution function 

:formula_64

We can explicitly write the polynomial formula_65 as 

:formula_66

where the summation is over all the integer partitions of &quot;m&quot; such that formula_67 and formula_68 and formula_69 

For example, if &quot;m&quot; = 3, then there are three ways to partition this number: 1 + 1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3. As such we need to examine three cases:

* 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 · &quot;k&quot;1, so we have &quot;k&quot;1 = 3, &quot;l&quot;1 = 3, and &quot;s&quot; = 9. 
* 1 + 2 = 1 · &quot;k&quot;1 + 2 · &quot;k&quot;2, so we have &quot;k&quot;1 = 1, &quot;k&quot;2 = 1, &quot;l&quot;1 = 3, &quot;l&quot;2 = 4, and &quot;s&quot; = 7. 
* 3 = 3 · &quot;k&quot;3, so we have &quot;k&quot;3 = 1, &quot;l&quot;3 = 5, and &quot;s&quot; = 5. 

Thus, the required polynomial is

:formula_70

The first five terms of the expansion are

:formula_71

Here, is the &quot;j&quot;-th derivative of at point &quot;x&quot;. Remembering that the derivatives of the density of the normal distribution are related to the normal density by formula_72, (where formula_73 is the Hermite polynomial of order &quot;n&quot;), this explains the alternative representations in terms of the density function. Blinnikov and Moessner (1998) have given a simple algorithm to calculate higher-order terms of the expansion.

Note that in case of a lattice distributions (which have discrete values), the Edgeworth expansion must be adjusted to account for the discontinuous jumps between lattice points.

==Illustration: density of the sample mean of three χ² distributions==

Take formula_74 and the sample mean formula_75.

We can use several distributions for formula_76:
* The exact distribution, which follows a gamma distribution: formula_77.
* The asymptotic normal distribution: formula_78.
* Two Edgeworth expansions, of degrees 2 and 3.

==Discussion of results==

* For finite samples, an Edgeworth expansion is not guaranteed to be a proper probability distribution as the CDF values at some points may go beyond formula_79.
* They guarantee (asymptotically) absolute errors, but relative errors can be easily assessed by comparing the leading Edgeworth term in the remainder with the overall leading term.

<doc id="641137" wikidata="Q2736123" url="?curid=641137" title="Carlton, Nottinghamshire">
<text>Carlton is a town in the Borough of Gedling, Nottinghamshire, England. It is to the east of Nottingham. The population at the 2011 Census was 6,881. It was an urban district until 1974, whose wards (Carlton Hill, Carlton, Cavendish, Colwick, Gedling, Netherfield, Phoenix and Porchester) had an estimated population of 48,416 in 2015. Owing to the growth of residential, commercial and industrial in the wider Gedling Borough, City of Nottingham, Borough of Broxtowe, Rushcliffe and Ashfield District, as well as the Amber Valley and Borough of Erewash in Derbyshire which have become quite urban around Nottingham, Carlton and Gedling, as well as Netherfield form a contiguous urban area.

== History ==
In the Domesday Book of 1086, Carlton is referred to as Carentune. The town grew significantly in the 19th century, largely due to the textile industry, which was a significant driver of its development.

In the early days, Carlton was a small township within the manor and parish of Gedling, home to farmers and framework knitters. Its strategic location on the edge of Nottingham and proximity to railways led to a steady increase in the population from the 1840s.

By 1850, Carlton had evolved into a suburban settlement, with its own housing, churches, schools, and other facilities.

The establishment of the Carlton Urban District Council in 1849 marked a significant milestone, recognising the township&#x27;s new status.

The completion of the tram route from Nottingham to Carlton in 1914 further cemented its role as a residential area for people working in Nottingham.

Until 1950, Carlton was part of the Rushcliffe parliamentary constituency. It had its own eponymous constituency from 1950 until 1983, since when it has been in the Gedling constituency. 

In 1974, Carlton Urban District became part of the newly formed Borough of Gedling. Today, Carlton is primarily a residential area, reflecting its historical growth and development.

== Geography ==
Carlton is situated in the Borough of Gedling, Nottinghamshire, England. It lies to the east of Nottingham and is part of the East Midlands region. The town is bordered by several other towns, including Bakersfield, Colwick, Gedling, Mapperley, Netherfield, Snienton, and St Ann&#x27;s.

Carlton lies within a valley, which has influenced its development, layout, and architecture. The town has two distinct sides: the Northern side, predominantly built during the Industrial Revolution and early 1900s, and the Southern side, which was primarily developed in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.

Carlton is located near to the River Trent. The town has an NG4 postcode, and is well-connected to Nottingham and other nearby areas through a network of road connections, such as the B686, as well as frequent public transport services.

The town&#x27;s geography has played a significant role in its development, with its proximity to Nottingham making it a desirable residential area for those working within the city.

==Community==

The main shopping street is Carlton Hill, which has several shopping chains and smaller shops such as newsagents, chemists, and grocers. Carlton Square, the traditional centre of Carlton is today a shopping centre.

There are numerous areas of grass for children to play on, as the roads tend to be quite busy. The King George V Recreation Ground on Standhill Road is on the site of the former Standhill Brickworks, and includes a large playing field, a skatepark, and a children&#x27;s playground. Carlton has two leisure centres: Richard Herrod Centre (an indoor bowling centre) on Foxhill Road and Carlton Forum (a swimming pool, gym and all-weather pitches) on Coningswath Road, off Cavendish Road.

Carlton Laundry on Primrose Street is a Grade II listed building by Watson Fothergill. It was built in 1899 as a laundry and dye works.

==Education==
Local schools are Parkdale School, Carlton le Willows Academy, Sherwood Academy and The Carlton Academy.

Carlton Central Primary School was founded in the late 19th century but after a piece of masonry fell one night from the roof into the school assembly area in the 1960s, the school was demolished and the council house and the current Carlton Square were built in its place. A new school had been built on Foxhill Road/Carlton Hill and Carlton Central Primary School was relocated there. The new school had originally been intended to replace the deteriorating St. Paul&#x27;s School on Carlton Hill. St Paul&#x27;s was closed in 1983 after many years and attempts to find a new site and financing for a new building were unsuccessful. Carlton Central Primary School is not the only primary school in Carlton. Amongst others, Porchester Junior School (which has recently been extended) is situated at the top of Standhill Road, while Carlton Standhill Infants School is at the opposite end of Standhill Road.

Carlton has a number of pre schools &amp; nurseries including Foxy Creeks Pre School (based in the Richard Herrod Centre, Foxhill Road), Good Foundations Day Nursery on Station Road and Little Owls Day Nursery on First Avenue.

Carlton is home to the Midlands Academy of Dance and Drama (also known as MADD). It is one of the UK&#x27;s top musical theatre colleges.

==Religion==
St. Paul&#x27;s Church, Carlton-in-the-Willows was built by Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon and consecrated in 1885. Located at the bottom of Carlton Hill, off Church Street, it is built in the style of a Roman Basilica and resides in the diocese of Southwell and Nottingham. Carlton Pentecostal Church is located opposite the fire station on Station Road.

==Sport==

Carlton Town Football Club were champions of Northern Counties East Football League Division One in the 2005–2006 season. Carlton Forum is a large leisure centre on Coningswath Road.

==Notable people==
* Richard Beckinsale, actor and father of actresses Samantha Beckinsale and Kate Beckinsale, was born in Carlton in 1947.
* Sam Beeton, chart topping singer/songwriter was born in Carlton in 1988.

<doc id="641145" wikidata="Q7009239" url="?curid=641145" title="New Jersey Jackals">
<text>The New Jersey Jackals are a professional baseball team based in Paterson, New Jersey. The Jackals compete in the Frontier League (FL) as a member of the East Division in the Atlantic Conference. The team was founded in 1998 by Floyd Hall and is owned by Al Dorso, a businessman who also owns the Sussex County Miners, Skylands Stadium, and State Fair Superstore. The Jackals play their home games at Hinchliffe Stadium. They were previously members of the Northeast League, Northern League, Can-Am League, and All-American Baseball Challenge. Beginning with the 2023 season, the Jackals play their home games at former Negro leagues ballpark Hinchliffe Stadium in Paterson, New Jersey.

The Jackals have a rivalry with their cross-Hudson River neighbor, the New York Boulders, the Sussex County Miners, as well as a rivalry with the Québec Capitales. The Jackals are one of three Frontier League teams in the New York metropolitan area; the others are the Boulders and the Miners.

==Team history==

===1998: Inaugural season===
The Jackals were founded in 1998 and replaced the Bangor Blue Ox in the Northeast League after that franchise folded. Kash Beauchamp was named the team&#x27;s first manager and they began play on May 30, 1998, against the Waterbury Spirit, where they won both games of a doubleheader.

The Jackals&#x27; first home game was played at a yet-to-be-finished Yogi Berra Stadium on June 5. Facing the Albany-Colonie Diamond Dogs, New Jersey went to extra innings before winning 2–1 in the thirteenth on a home run by Gary Collum.

The Jackals finished the regular season with 53 wins, most in the league, and won the first half championship, which ensured a place in the Northeast League playoffs. They would defeat the Allentown Ambassadors in their first playoff series, then face Albany-Colonie again for the league championship. The Jackals defeated the Diamond Dogs 2–0 in a best of three series to win their first league championship.

===1999–2000: Entering a new league===

The Jackals became members of the Northern League for the 1999 season after the league decided to absorb the Northeast League. The Jackals became part of the new Northern League East Division.

The Jackals won 45 games in 1999 and again qualified for the playoffs, knocking off Allentown in their first playoff matchup before falling to Albany-Colonie in a rematch of their league championship series from 1998.

The Jackals received the honor of hosting the Northern League All-Star Game in 2000. 4,211 fans showed up to watch the game, which saw the East defeat the Central Division 10–5. It was one of the year&#x27;s highlights, but there were not many others as the Jackals struggled throughout the season. A 31–52 record placed the team last in the division, and following the season Kash Beauchamp announced his resignation after three seasons.

===2001–2004: Champions===
George Tsamis was hired to take over the Jackals for 2001. He had lost his job as manager in Waterbury following the 2000 season when the Spirit suspended operations.

The Jackals again found struggles, but managed to pull together 45 victories against 45 losses. They qualified for the Northern League playoffs for the second time in three years as a wild card and once again won their first round series, sweeping Albany-Colonie.

Shortly after the Jackals&#x27; win over the Diamond Dogs, the September 11 attacks occurred and threw the rest of the playoffs into doubt. After discussion the Northern League determined that they would continue to play and the Jackals resumed their championship quest against the Elmira Pioneers on September 17. In a five-game series, New Jersey emerged victorious and advanced to the Northern League Championship Series against the Winnipeg Goldeyes, whom they defeated in four games to win their second league championship.

===2002===

The 2002 Jackals season was historic on two fronts. The first historic moment came when Jeremy Callier threw a no-hitter on August 28 against the Berkshire Black Bears, requiring a home run by Ryan Kane in the bottom of the ninth inning to make it official.

The second piece of team history saw the Jackals set a team record for victories, finishing with 62 to lead the league.

In the playoffs, however, the Jackals had problems. In the first round, they took the first two against Elmira before the Pioneers won the next two to tie the series. The Jackals emerged victorious in five games.

Then, in the Northern League East Championship Series against Adirondack, the Jackals were down to their final out in Game 5 trailing 2–1 when Dave Callahan hit a double with the bases loaded to score all three runners and give the team a 4–2 victory. The Jackals capped it off with their second straight victory over Winnipeg in the Northern League Championship Series, defeating the Goldeyes 3 games to 1.

===2003===
2003 saw two major changes for the Jackals. First George Tsamis resigned to take the managerial position with the St. Paul Saints, New Jersey hired Gary SouthShore RailCats manager Joe Calfapietra to take his place. The second saw the end of the merger with the Northern League, as the Northeast League once again became its own entity. The Jackals finished 52–37 and returned to the playoffs for a third consecutive year by winning both halves of the season in their division, but were dispatched in the first round by the eventual league champion Brockton Rox.

===2004===
In 2004, New Jersey improved their record to what was then the team&#x27;s second-best showing in its history, winning 54 games and losing 29. However, the first half of the season required saw the Jackals end in a tie with the New Haven County Cutters, requiring a one-game playoff which New Jersey won for their fifth consecutive half-season victory. The Jackals pulled away in the second half with a 28–18 record, winning both halves for a third straight year.

The Jackals beat the Bangor Lumberjacks in the opening round of the playoffs, then found themselves in trouble against the North Shore Spirit in the league championship series. Trailing two games to none and down late in the third game, the Jackals rallied for an extra inning victory. They duplicated the feat the next day in Game 4 to tie the series, and then won the fifth and deciding game to take the Northeast League Championship. It would be the fourth league championship for the Jackals, but would be their last for over a decade.

===2005===
In 2005 the Jackals joined the 8-team Can-Am League but failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 2000 despite posting a winning record of 48–44. Outfielder Zach Smithlin led the league with 135 hits and a .358 batting average, while second baseman Ricardo Cordova also topped .350 and was named to the All-Star team. Pitcher Joel Bennett recorded a 2.68 ERA and an 11–2 record in his abbreviated season and also garnered All-Star consideration.

===2006===
2006 saw another history-making performance as Aaron Myers threw the second no-hitter in team history, but New Jersey again missed the playoffs and—with a 43–48 record—finished with only their second losing record in team history. The Jackals’ major bright spot was veteran minor league John Lindsey, who led the team in home runs but was signed away from the team in the second half of the season. Joel Bennett and Raul Valdes both led the Jackals in wins with seven, while Isaac Pavlik and Joe Orloski each recorded six.

===2007===
The Jackals returned to the playoffs as they won the Can-Am League First Half Championship in 2007 with a 31–15 record, guaranteeing them a spot in the playoffs. Their 31 wins in the first half still mark a franchise best in the first half, and second most in a half (32 in 2002). The Jackals&#x27; second half was not as strong, as they finished in last place with an 18–29 record. New Jersey took the Nashua Pride to a fifth game at Yogi Berra Stadium in their best-of-five series before losing and getting knocked out.

The Jackals’ leading hitter was returning catcher Sandy Madera, who hit .364 with 21 home runs and 75 RBI. Zach Smithlin stole 33 bases, marking the fourth consecutive year where he recorded at least 25.

After the season, Joel Bennett retired from professional baseball. He finished his final season with a 3–2 record.

===2008===
The Jackals missed the playoffs in 2008, finishing 43–51.

In a ceremony prior to their game on August 22 vs. the Brockton Rox, the Jackals retired pitcher Joel Bennett’s number 28.

The Jackals total attendance in 2008 was 103,817. Averaging 2,209 per game.

===2009===
New Jersey was able to ride a CanAm League record 14 game winning streak to a First Half Championship in 2009 with a 28–19 record, once again guaranteeing the team a playoff spot. The Jackals won 27 games in the second half for a total of 55, the second most in team history. Despite that, New Jersey was eliminated from the playoffs by the Worcester Tornadoes.

===2010===
In 2010, the Jackals slipped in the first half, finishing fourth with a 19–27 record. The team battled back to a 23–23 record in the second half, beating out the Worcester Tornadoes by 0.5 game for the fourth and final playoff spot. The Jackals were swept by Quebec three games to none in the opening round.

===2011===
The Jackals finished the regular season 57–36, the second most season wins in franchise history behind the 62 wins the 2002 team put up. Despite an impressive record, the Jackals were unable to win either half of the regular season (Quebec won both halves), and finished second of the eight teams.

On July 30, the Jackals retired Zack Smithlin&#x27;s #4 jersey in a pregame ceremony.

Jackals pitcher Isaac Pavlik made a close run for the pitching triple crown, finishing the regular season atop the league in wins and strikeouts, but third in ERA.

The Jackals defeated the Pittsfield Colonials to advance to the Can-Am League Championship Series, losing again to Quebec.

===2012===
The Jackals completed the season second overall with a 59–41 record. They once again faced the Capitales in the championship series, which was extended to a best-of-seven, but again lost.

Jackals 3B Nick Giarraputo was named the Can-Am League&#x27;s 2012 Player of the Year.

===2013===
The Jackals finished at 55–44, in second place.
Quebec loomed in the league championship series again, and the Jackals rallied from three games to one down to force a seventh game which the Capitales won.

===2014===
With the Newark Bears ceasing operations after the 2013 season,
the Can-Am League was down to just 4 teams for 2014. The New Jersey Jackals, Rockland Boulders, Trois-Rivières Aigles, &amp; Québec Capitales.

More inter-league play with American Association kept the Can-Am afloat,
while allowing the league to maintain its own separate identity.

The Jackals hosted the St. Paul Saints, Winnipeg Goldeyes, &amp; Lincoln Saltdogs going 4–5.

==Postseason records==
The Jackals have participated in 119 games in 30 postseason series. They have an overall playoff record of 62 wins and 57 losses.

==Broadcast homes==
Jackals games are broadcast via video stream at Flosports.tv and an internet-only audio broadcast at Mixlr.

When the Jackals began in 1998, games were carried over Seton Hall University&#x27;s WSOU. After a season there, the team moved to commercial station WMTR, an oldies station in Morristown. They also were heard on WJUX-FM, a New York-based standards station, ending their run on commercial radio in 2002. For this entire stretch, Jim Cerny was the voice of the Jackals. Kevin Burkhardt was also one of the Jackals play-by-play voices.

WPSC-FM, the on-campus radio station for William Paterson University, took broadcast rights in 2003 and kept them until 2006. The original broadcast team consisted of Darren Cooper on play-by-play with Joe Ameruoso as color commentator. Cooper left the broadcast after the season, and Tony Colucci was added as color man to take over for the promoted Ameruoso. Beginning in 2005, Ameruoso did the broadcasts by himself and continued to do so after the broadcasts became web exclusive in 2007, continuing in the role for several more years until his eventual departure.

Other broadcasters in team history include Cody Chrusciel in 2011, Corey Scheiner and Mia O&#x27;Brien in 2012. Michael Cohen broadcast games from 2013-2016. Alex Cammarata from 2017-19. Starting in the 2020 season, Reed Keller took the reins, and is the current voice of the franchise.

<text>Yogi Berra Stadium is a baseball stadium in Little Falls, New Jersey, on the campus of Montclair State University. The stadium is home to the Montclair State Red Hawks baseball team, which competes in NCAA Division III; the NJIT Highlanders baseball team which competes in NCAA Division I; and the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center, which adjoins the stadium on its first base side. It was formerly home to the New Jersey Jackals of the independent Frontier League from 1998 to 2022 and the part-time home of the NY/NJ Comets of National Pro Fastpitch in 2013. In 2001, the stadium was the home field of the New Jersey Pride of Major League Lacrosse in their inaugural season.

==History==
Yogi Berra Stadium has a seating capacity of 3,784 and a lawn seating that holds over 1,200 people, which brings the capacity to 5,000. It is capable of holding overflow crowds with standing room and grass seating available in right field. These tickets are sold only in the event of an anticipated large crowd, such as on holidays or fireworks nights.
Construction of the stadium was done in conjunction with another venue on the Montclair State campus. Floyd Hall, a resident of Montclair who was then serving as chief executive officer of Kmart, donated money to the university in order to build an ice arena, which is known as Floyd Hall Arena and is a multi-use facility that several of the area&#x27;s high school hockey teams call home, and a new baseball stadium for Montclair State&#x27;s team to replace their previous venue, Pittser Field. Around this time the Northeast League, an independent minor baseball league, was looking for a team to replace the Bangor Blue Ox, which had folded. Hall bought into the league shortly thereafter and founded the Jackals, who were promptly given use of the new stadium once it was able to open. It was decided to name the stadium after Hall of Fame New York Yankees catcher Yogi Berra, who called Montclair home during his playing days and managerial career with the Yankees and their crosstown rivals, the New York Mets.

Despite construction delays keeping the Montclair State baseball team from using the new park (they remained at Pittser Field for one additional season; Pittser Field was then converted into a soccer only stadium), it opened for business in time for the Jackals&#x27; inaugural game on June 5, 1998. Despite the stadium only being partially finished, as construction on an addition continued throughout the season, fans hungry for economical entertainment flocked to the ball park for a fun night out, and the park is well-constructed with good sight lines and no obstructed views from any of its seats. The park&#x27;s dimensions are 308 feet to each of the corner outfields and 398 to center field; according to the Jackals, this was done on purpose as another honor for Berra.

An addition was constructed to house the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center, which features various baseball memorabilia from Berra&#x27;s playing days and a reconstruction of the original scoreboard from Yankee Stadium among various other things. A skybox was constructed as part of the museum, and has very limited access. Berra was the primary user of the seats, as he made personal appearances at least twice per year to sign autographs for the fans until 2015; he died several days after the conclusion of that season. The Jackals have also allowed the skybox to be used by professional scouts attending games.

The museum addition was completed following the 1998 season and the final phase of construction was completed in early 1999 as the seating areas were renovated and extended, with seats going as far as left and right field and several reserved sections being replaced with box seats, installation of several concession stands and a second set of restrooms, a new team store, and a resurfacing of the stadium&#x27;s walls with white stucco.

In 2010, world-renowned sculptor Brian Hanlon of Toms River, New Jersey sculpted a statue of Berra that was placed outside of the stadium in front of the museum.

In 2022, the Jackals announced that they would be leaving Yogi Berra Stadium for Hinchliffe Stadium in nearby Paterson. August 25, 2022, was the team&#x27;s last regular season home game.

===Renovations===

For many years, the stadium&#x27;s official address was 1 Hall Drive, honoring the team&#x27;s founder. In early 2016, as a further honor for its deceased namesake, the Jackals changed this to 8 Yogi Berra Drive.

In 2018, the Jackals installed a new Daktronics HD LED video board in left field as part of stadium wide improvements.

Ahead of the 2024 season, Montclair State and NJIT carried out a $5.3 million renovation of the stadium. The renovations included a new artificial turf field, a pitch counter, a new dugout to bullpen phone, replacement of the outfield walls, new storage facility, updated locker room, new bullpens and batting cages, a new scoreboard and signage celebrating the Red Hawk’s three National Champion teams (1987, 1993, 2000). New LED lighting was installed that is more energy efficient, environmentally friendly and meets broadcasting standards that will allow games to be televised on ESPN and other national networks. Additionally, the concession area was renovated and renamed &quot;The Hill&quot; in reference to Yogi Berra’s boyhood neighborhood, The Hill, in St. Louis and the elevated Red Hawks perch for the stadium and campus. The renovations enable to the stadium be a year round facility by hosting conferences, NCAA baseball tournaments and other high-profile events.

<doc id="641151" wikidata="Q2420749" url="?curid=641151" title="Thielert Centurion">
<text>The Thielert Centurion is a series of diesel cycle aircraft engines for general aviation originally built by Thielert, which was bought by Aviation Industry Corporation of China&#x27;s Tecnify Motors subsidiary and is currently marketed by Continental Motors. They are based on heavily modified Mercedes-Benz automotive engines.

==Design==
All Centurion engines are liquid-cooled, turbocharged, and employ a single-lever power control (SLPC) associated with a full authority digital engine control (FADEC). This simplifies engine management for the pilot, as well as improving reliability as it prevents the engine being operated improperly. The series utilizes either jet fuel or diesel fuel. The high compression ratio of the engine combined with the digitally controlled fuel injection system mirrors similar advances in automotive technology.

Centurion series engines are always fitted with constant speed propellers which allow the engine to be operated at optimum speed at all times. However, the normal operating speed is too high for any suitable propeller and so the propeller is driven through a reduction gearbox. The constant speed propeller and reduction gear result in a propeller tip speed that is 10-15% lower than comparable conventional avgas engines, reducing propeller noise.

The diesel engine&#x27;s high compression results in better fuel efficiency and the higher operating rpm of the Centurion allows higher power to be developed from a smaller displacement, in comparison to conventional aircraft piston engines (i.e. engines that require leaded aviation gasoline with a very high octane rating).
A Centurion engine complete with constant speed unit (CSU), reduction gearbox, turbocharger and FADEC engine management system is considerably heavier than the more conventional Continental and Lycoming engines which it competes against. However, this weight disadvantage is compensated for by the Centurion&#x27;s lower fuel consumption. Even though they lack the magnetos and spark plugs of conventional petrol (gas) piston engines, Centurion engines are considerably more complex.

==Variants==
;Centurion 1.7 (TAE 125-01):
:The first product introduced by Thielert, a 1689 cm³ (103 in³) engine producing is an inline-four engine based on the Mercedes-Benz OM668 from Mercedes-Benz A-Class A 170 CDI (W168) with 80 mm bore and 84 mm stroke.

:The engine produces more power than a Lycoming O-320 above 4,000 ft, can maintain 93 kW (125 hp) till FL120, and burns in cruise at FL175 for 72 kW (97 hp): .

:More than 1,500 Centurion 1.7s had been built until the end of 2006 when it was replaced by the Centurion 2.0. The in-service record of the 1.7 has been poor.

:A combination of design, service and support issues caused widespread customer dissatisfaction.
:Diamond then designed its own Austro Engines as an alternative to Thielert.

:The engines were later marketed as the CD-135 by Continental Engines and produced in St. Egidien, Germany before being granted final assembly in Fairhope, Alabama for the U.S. retrofit market in 2015.

;Centurion 2.0 - Continental CD-135 (TAE 125-02-99)
:Introduced in late 2006. The main difference is a new Mercedes-Benz OM640 engine cylinder block from the Mercedes-Benz A 200 CDI (W169) with a displacement of 1991 cm3 (Ø83 x 92 mm). Other improvements include a more compact FADEC, a lighter cast gearbox housing, interfaces for glass cockpits and a new service tool that allows the FADEC to be programmed in the field. Dimensions of the Centurion 2.0 and 1.7 are nearly identical and the install kits are compatible, so a 1.7 at the end of its life can be replaced with a 2.0. The Centurion 2.0 is rated for a power output of , the same as the 1.7, but is EASA and FAA certified for . It has accumulated more than 1,000,000 flight hours without mechanical failures as of April 2008.

;Centurion 2.0 S (TAE 125-02-114)
:This 4-cylinder turbodiesel common rail direct injection with redundant FADEC control offers providing a significant power increase compared to the Centurion 2.0 for no additional weight. An engine kit may cost $89,000.

;Centurion 3.0
:Certified 20 June 2017 by Technify Motors GmbH (application: 19 December 2013), 2987 cm³ V6 four stroke Diesel piston engine with common rail high pressure direct fuel injection, turbocharger, 1:1.66 gearbox and electronic engine control unit. 980 mm Length × 700 mm Height × 790 mm Width, 265 kg dry, 221 kW (300 HP) for 5 min, 202 kW (272 HP) maximum continuous, both at 3880 rpm (2340 prop rpm). It has the same dimensions as the Mercedes-Benz OM642.

;Centurion 3.2
:Intended to fill the gap between the Centurion 2.0 and the 4.0 and designed to produce . Development is largely complete, but the project is on hold.

;Centurion 4.0
:The 75° V8 DOHC 4 valves per cylinder was initially equipped with two turbochargers and weighed dry for 228 kW max (310 hp) till FL80 at 2300 rpm at the propeller, and 176 kW (250 hp) in cruise for /h and /h at best economy, for . It was planned for a production of 600 per year.

:Designed as a larger engine to replace the gasoline engines and developed from the Mercedes-Benz OM629 automobile engine, it produced 350 hp (261 kW) later with a larger single turbocharger.

:After the insolvency of Thielert in April 2008 all work on the Centurion 4.0 was frozen.

;Continental CD-155
:Is the Continental Motors, Inc. brand name of the Centurion 2.0S with . The engine must be replaced every 2,100 hours, the gearbox has to be replaced for an inspection at 900 hours, the high-pressure pump has a life limit of 600 hours, the alternator of 600 hours, friction disk of 900 hours, V-ribbed belt of 1,200 hours, alternator excitation battery of 12 months. Fuel, oil, and cooling lines are replaced at 60 months except for the Robin DR400 where these items are &#x27;on condition&#x27; with no set life-limit. The dual mass flywheel, which is intended to have the same life as the engine, is tested in-situ at 1,200 hours.

; TAE 125-02-125 (Continental CD-170)
:A four-cylinder, liquid-cooled diesel engine with FADEC, dual overhead camshafts and a common rail direct fuel injection system, weighing and certified by the EASA on 22 July 2020. In September 2020 the Tecnam P2010 TDI was launched with the CD170 as its powerplant.

;Continental CD-300
:The Continental brand name of the six cylinder 3 litre Thielert Diesel, with an output of at 2300 rpm. The CD-300 should replace the Safran/SMA diesel engine for the five-seat, single-engine Diamond DA50 from the third quarter of 2020 after a first flight of the combination on 22 March 2019, with a cruise fuel burn of 34.8 L/h (9.2USgal/h). FAA certification was granted on 25 July 2023.

<text>Anthony Donald Joseph Field (born 8 May 1963) is an Australian musician, actor, songwriter and producer. He is best known as a leader of the children&#x27;s group the Wiggles and a member of the 1980s and 1990s pop band the Cockroaches. While still a teenager, he helped found the Cockroaches with his brothers, Paul and John. The Cockroaches recorded two albums and enjoyed moderate success, interrupted by Field&#x27;s service in the Army, until they disbanded in the late 1980s.

Field attended Macquarie University to receive training in early childhood education, and founded the Wiggles with fellow students Murray Cook, Greg Page and former bandmate Jeff Fatt in 1991. He worked as a preschool teacher for two years before the success of the Wiggles led him to focus on children&#x27;s music full-time. The Wiggles became one of the most successful and active groups in Australia. Field, who wears a blue shirt while performing with the Wiggles, was responsible for the production aspects of their stage and television shows, albums, and DVDs. His issues with chronic pain and depression, which almost forced him out of the group at the height of their success, are well-documented. After the departure of Cook, Fatt, and Page in 2012, he is the only remaining original Wiggle.

==Early life and education==
Field was born in Kellyville, New South Wales, Australia. He is the youngest of seven children, and grew up in north western Sydney. He came from a long line of musicians, especially the women in his family. His great-great aunt was Queenie Paul, known for performing at the Tivoli Theatre in Sydney, and his grandmother Kathleen accompanied silent movies in the mining town of Cobar. Field&#x27;s mother, Marie, made sure that all of her seven children learned how to play at least one musical instrument. He attended the all-boys boarding school St Joseph&#x27;s College, which his great-grandfather Paddy Condon, an Italian immigrant and master stonemason, helped build.

He was inspired by his sister Colleen to study early childhood education, and became convinced that teaching preschool children &quot;was my calling&quot;. He was also attracted to the profession&#x27;s freedom, artistic nature, and lack of discipline, which was different from his experience in boarding school. Field put off university when the Cockroaches became successful, but he was dissatisfied with touring and plagued by &quot;perhaps irrational, but very real, feelings of inadequacy and depression&quot;.

By his mid-twenties, he decided that he did not want to tour any longer, so he took two breaks. His first break was as an infantry soldier, rifleman, stretcher bearer, and ambulance driver in the 5th/7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Australia&#x27;s regular army from 1982 to 1985. He played the bagpipes in parades and on training missions, but ended his military service in July 1985 and suffered from a bad back as a result of his training. He also went backpacking in the U.K., listening to roots music, to children&#x27;s music by artists like Raffi, and to recordings of children&#x27;s books.

==The Cockroaches==

In 1979, while they were students at St Joseph&#x27;s, he and his brothers Paul and John formed the pop group the Cockroaches.

In 1986 they signed with an independent label, Regular Records, which issued their first three albums, including &quot;The Cockroaches&quot; (March 1987), which peaked at No. 9 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart; it sold 70,000 copies and was certified platinum by their label. The album spawned the single &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s biggest hit when it peaked at No. 7 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart in April 1987.

When the Cockroaches disbanded in the early 1990s, Field enrolled at Macquarie University. While at university, he decided to record an album of children&#x27;s music, enlisting the assistance of fellow student and guitarist Murray Cook, former Cockroaches roadie and vocalist Greg Page, former bandmate and keyboardist Jeff Fatt, and Macquarie instructor and composer Phillip Wilcher, who later left the group.

==The Wiggles==

The Wiggles recorded their first CD in 1991; it sold 100,000 copies. Field worked as a preschool teacher for two years before the success of the Wiggles and their extensive touring schedule, which he strongly disliked, forced him to quit. After the production of their second album, the Wiggles adopted colour-coded shirts to wear on stage. According to Field, he wore blue because Cook and Fatt already owned shirts in their colours of red and purple respectively, so he and Page &quot;met in a Sydney department store and literally raced to see who got the blue shirt&quot;. Page ended up wearing a yellow shirt and Field originally wore a green polo shirt, but changed to blue to avoid clashing with Dorothy the Dinosaur.

Each Wiggle developed a &quot;schtick&quot; based on their actual behaviours, which evolved into caricatures, and served the same purpose as the uniforms in differentiating their characters and making them memorable to young children; Field&#x27;s was eating. Field created and played the original Captain Feathersword; the role was taken over by Paul Paddick in 1996. Field also played Wags the Dog.

By the mid-1990s, despite the success of the Wiggles, Field reported being suicidal and &quot;frequently gripped by anxiety, sadness, and negativity&quot;. By mid-2004, shortly after his marriage and the birth of his first child, Field&#x27;s serious medical issues, worsened by their heavy tour schedule, caused him to consider quitting or re-inventing the Wiggles, despite their great success in the U.K. and North America. After meeting chiropractor James Stoxen in Chicago in 2004, Field improved his health to the point that he was able to continue. He began to hire teams of chiropractors for himself, his fellow bandmembers, and castmembers in every city they performed, which he credited with making it possible for them to fulfill their touring requirements. In early 2013, Field became the only original member of the group to remain after Fatt, Cook, and Page retired. He remained in the group because he wanted to continue to educate children and as Wiggles manager Paul Field stated, &quot;to placate American, British and Canadian business partners&quot;.

In July 2020, he and the other classic Wiggles appeared in the Soul Movers music video for &quot;Circles Baby&quot;.

Field&#x27;s musical influences include Lightning Hopkins, Elvis Presley, and The Rolling Stones. He plays several instruments, including the tin whistle, bagpipes, guitar, drums, trumpet, violin, bouzouki and didgeridoo. Field, with input from the other members, produced most of the Wiggles&#x27; music, DVDs, and live shows.

==Other projects==
In 2018, Field, along with fellow Wiggles member Lachlan Gillespie and band members Oliver Brian and David O&#x27;Reilly, started a band for adult fans called the Unusual Commoners, which played a mixture of traditional Australian, Irish, Scottish and folk songs. They performed their first international show in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland in late 2018.

==Personal life==
In 1999, Field was named &quot;Bachelor of the Year&quot; in &quot;Cleo&quot;. In 2003, he married Michaela Patisteas, a former dancer whose family owned Griffiths Coffee in Melbourne. They have three children, who have joined the Field family business by appearing in several of the Wiggles&#x27; TV shows and videos.

Beginning in 2007, Field, who is a registered breeder of Miniature Fox Terriers, did voiceover work for the TV show &quot;RSPCA Animal Rescue&quot; for Channel 7 in Australia.

Field, in describing his enthusiasm for competitive sports, has stated, &quot;My love of cricket is abiding&quot;, a sport that &quot;instills the same loyalty and passions in me as I know baseball does for many in North America&quot;. He is a fan of the Wests Tigers, an Australian Rugby League joint venture club between the Balmain Tigers and Western Suburbs Magpies, but has publicly stated his heart lies with Balmain. In 2023, he publicly revealed his dream of buying and resurrecting Balmain as a stand alone club He is also a fan of singer Julio Iglesias. As Field&#x27;s fitness improved, to the point that his training regimen became comparable to that of an elite athlete, he gained an interest in gymnastics and acrobatics.

Field went public about his experience with clinical depression in mid-2007 to draw more attention to the condition. He has stated that &quot;being on the road is a dangerous job for someone with depression&quot;, but has dealt with it through diet, exercise, talking about it, and having a good support system (including his father before his death in 1998, his wife, and his friend Murray Cook, among his bandmates). He chronicled his health struggles and how he overcame them in his 2012 book &quot;How I Got My Wiggle Back&quot;.

Field is a devout Catholic, something that he reported helped him deal with his chronic health issues and depression, especially the spiritual practices of prayer and devotion to the Virgin Mary as expressed by Our Lady of Guadalupe. He has two large tattoos on his arms: one is the Virgin Mary with the words &quot;My life is in your hands&quot; in Spanish; the other is a heart with the words, &quot;My love, my heart&quot; in Spanish. The names of his wife and his three children are also tattooed on his arms. He admits that he got his tattoo of the Virgin, which he hid from fans for a long time, during a visit to Mexico while on tour in North America, in the middle of a bout with chronic pain and dental problems, as he put it, &quot;in a moment of madness&quot;.

==Awards==
Field was made a Member of the Order of Australia on 26 January 2010 &quot;for service to the arts, particularly children&#x27;s entertainment, and to the community as a benefactor and supporter of a range of charities&quot;.

<text>A bruise, also known as a contusion, is a type of hematoma of tissue, the most common cause being capillaries damaged by trauma, causing localized bleeding that extravasates into the surrounding interstitial tissues. Most bruises occur close enough to the epidermis such that the bleeding causes a visible discoloration. The bruise then remains visible until the blood is either absorbed by tissues or cleared by immune system action. Bruises which do not blanch under pressure can involve capillaries at the level of skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, or bone. 

Bruises are not to be confused with other similar-looking lesions. Such lesions include petechia (less than , resulting from numerous and diverse etiologies such as adverse reactions from medications such as warfarin, straining, asphyxiation, platelet disorders and diseases such as &quot;cytomegalovirus&quot;); and purpura (), classified as palpable purpura or non-palpable purpura and indicating various pathologic conditions such as thrombocytopenia. Additionally, although many terminology schemas treat an ecchymosis (plural, ecchymoses) (over ) as synonymous with a bruise, in some other schemas, an ecchymosis is differentiated by its remoteness from the source and cause of bleeding, with blood dissecting through tissue planes and settling in an area remote from the site of trauma or even nontraumatic pathology, such as in periorbital ecchymosis (&quot;raccoon eyes&quot;), arising from a basilar skull fracture or from a neuroblastoma.

As a type of hematoma, a bruise is always caused by internal bleeding into the interstitial tissues which does not break through the skin, usually initiated by blunt trauma, which causes damage through physical compression and deceleration forces. Trauma sufficient to cause bruising can occur from a wide variety of situations including accidents, falls, and surgeries. Disease states such as insufficient or malfunctioning platelets, other coagulation deficiencies, or vascular disorders, such as venous blockage associated with severe allergies can lead to the formation of purpura which is not to be confused with trauma-related bruising/contusion. If the trauma is sufficient to break the skin and allow blood to escape the interstitial tissues, the injury is not a bruise but bleeding, a different variety of hemorrhage. Such injuries may be accompanied by bruising elsewhere.

==Signs and symptoms==

Bruises often induce pain immediately after the trauma that results in their formation, but small bruises are not normally dangerous alone. Sometimes bruises can be serious, leading to other more life-threatening forms of hematoma, such as when associated with serious injuries, including fractures and more severe internal bleeding. The likelihood and severity of bruising depends on many factors, including type and healthiness of affected tissues. Minor bruises may be easily recognized in people with light skin color by characteristic blue or purple appearance (idiomatically described as &quot;black and blue&quot;) in the days following the injury.

Hematomas can be subdivided by size. By definition, ecchymoses are 1 centimetres in size or larger, and are therefore larger than petechiae (less than 3 millimetres in diameter) or purpura (3 to 10 millimetres in diameter). Ecchymoses also have a more diffuse border than other purpura. A broader definition of ecchymosis is the escape of blood into the tissues from ruptured blood vessels. The term also applies to the subcutaneous discoloration resulting from seepage of blood within the injured tissue.

Bruise colors vary from red, blue, or almost black, depending on the severity of broken capillaries or blood vessels within the bruise site. Broken venules or arterioles often result in a deep blue or dark red bruise, respectively. Darker colored bruises may result from a more severe bleeding from both blood vessels. Older bruises may appear yellow, green or brown.

==Cause==
There are many causes of subcutaneous hematomas including ecchymoses. Coagulopathies such as hemophilia A may cause ecchymosis formation in children. The medication betamethasone can have the adverse effect of causing ecchymosis.

The presence of bruises may be seen in patients with platelet or coagulation disorders, or those who are being treated with an anticoagulant. Unexplained bruising may be a warning sign of child abuse, domestic abuse, or serious medical problems such as leukemia or meningoccocal infection. Unexplained bruising can also indicate internal bleeding or certain types of cancer. Long-term glucocorticoid therapy can cause easy bruising. Bruising present around the navel (belly button) with severe abdominal pain suggests acute pancreatitis. Connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers–Danlos syndrome may cause relatively easy or spontaneous bruising depending on the severity. Spontaneous bruising or bruising with minimal trauma in the absence of other explanations and together with other minor or major criteria suggestive of vascular Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome (vEDS) suggests genetic testing for the condition.

During an autopsy, bruises accompanying abrasions indicate the abrasions occurred while the individual was alive, as opposed to damage incurred post mortem.

===Size and shape===

Bruise shapes may correspond directly to the instrument of injury or be modified by additional factors. Bruises often become more prominent as time lapses, resulting in additional size and swelling, and may grow to a large size over the course of the hours after the injury that caused the bruise was inflicted.
* Condition and type of tissue: In soft tissues, a larger area is bruised than would be in firmer tissue due to ease of blood to invade tissue.
* Age: elderly skin and other tissues are often thinner and less elastic and thus more prone to bruising.
* Gender: More bruising occurs in females due to increased subcutaneous fat.
* Skin tone: Discoloration caused by bruises is more prominent in lighter complexions.
* Diseases: Coagulation, platelet and blood vessel diseases or deficiencies can increase bruising due to more bleeding.
* Location: More extensive vascularity causes more bleeding. Areas such as the arms, knees, shins and the facial area are especially common bruise sites.
* Forces: Greater striking forces cause greater bruising.
* Genes: Despite having completely normal coagulation factors, natural redheads have been shown to bruise more, although this may just be due to greater visibility on commonly associated lighter complexion.

===Severity===
Bruises can be scored on a scale from 0–5 to categorize the severity and danger of the injury.
The harm score is determined by the extent and severity of the injuries to the organs and tissues causing the bruising, in turn depending on multiple factors. For example, a contracted muscle will bruise more severely, as will tissues crushed against underlying bone. Capillaries vary in strength, stiffness and toughness, which can also vary by age and medical conditions.

Low levels of damaging forces produce small bruises and generally cause the individual to feel minor pain straight away. Repeated impacts worsen bruises, increasing the harm level. Normally, light bruises heal nearly completely within two weeks, although duration is affected by variation in severity and individual healing processes; generally, more severe or deeper bruises take somewhat longer.

Severe bruising (harm score 2–3) may be dangerous or cause serious complications. Further bleeding and excess fluid may accumulate causing a hard, fluctuating lump or swelling hematoma. This has the potential to cause compartment syndrome in which the swelling cuts off blood flow to the tissues. The trauma that induced the bruise may also have caused other severe and potentially fatal harm to internal organs. For example, impacts to the head can cause traumatic brain injury: bleeding, bruising and massive swelling of the brain with the potential to cause concussion, coma and death. Treatment for brain bruising may involve emergency surgery to relieve the pressure on the brain.

Damage that causes bruising can also cause bones to be broken, tendons or muscles to be strained, ligaments to be sprained, or other tissue to be damaged. The symptoms and signs of these injuries may initially appear to be those of simple bruising. Abdominal bruising or severe injuries that cause difficulty in moving a limb or the feeling of liquid under the skin may indicate life-threatening injury and require the attention of a physician.

==Mechanism==

Increased distress to tissue causes capillaries to break under the skin, allowing blood to escape and build up. As time progresses, blood seeps into the surrounding tissues, causing the bruise to darken and spread. Nerve endings within the affected tissue detect the increased pressure, which, depending on severity and location, may be perceived as pain or pressure or be asymptomatic. The damaged capillary endothelium releases endothelin, a hormone that causes narrowing of the blood vessel to minimize bleeding. As the endothelium is destroyed, the underlying von Willebrand factor is exposed and initiates coagulation, which creates a temporary clot to plug the wound and eventually leads to restoration of normal tissue.

During this time, larger bruises may change color due to the breakdown of hemoglobin from within escaped red blood cells in the extracellular space. The striking colors of a bruise are caused by the phagocytosis and sequential degradation of hemoglobin to biliverdin to bilirubin to hemosiderin, with hemoglobin itself producing a red-blue color, biliverdin producing a green color, bilirubin producing a yellow color, and hemosiderin producing a golden-brown color. As these products are cleared from the area, the bruise disappears. Often the underlying tissue damage has been repaired long before this process is complete.

==Treatment==

Treatment for light bruises is minimal and may include RICE (rest, ice, compression, and elevation), painkillers (particularly NSAIDs) and, later in recovery, light stretching exercises. Particularly, immediate application of ice while elevating the area may reduce or completely prevent swelling by restricting blood flow to the area and preventing internal bleeding. Rest and preventing re-injury is essential for rapid recovery.

Very gently massaging the area and applying heat may encourage blood flow and relieve pain according to the Gate control theory of pain, although causing additional pain may indicate the massage is exacerbating the injury. As for most injuries, these techniques should not be applied until at least three days following the initial damage to ensure all internal bleeding has stopped, because although increasing blood flow will allow more healing factors into the area and encourage drainage, if the injury is still bleeding this will allow more blood to seep out of the wound and cause the bruise to become worse.

==History==
Folk medicine, including ancient medicine of Egyptians, Greeks, Celts, Turks, Slavs, Maya, Aztecs and Chinese, has used bruising as a treatment for some health problems. The methods vary widely and include cupping, scraping, and slapping. Fire cupping uses suction which causes bruising in patients. Scraping (gua sha) uses a small hand device with a rounded edge to gently scrape the scalp or the skin. Another ancient device that creates mild bruising is a strigil, used by Greeks and Romans in the bath. Archaeologically there is no precedent for scraping tools before Greek archaeological evidence, not Chinese or Egyptian.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;ecchymosis&quot; (; plural &quot;ecchymoses&quot;, ), comes to English from Neo-Latin, based on Greek , from , from (elided to ) and . Compare &quot;enchyma&quot;, &quot;tissue infused with organic juice&quot;; elaboration from chyme, the formative juice of tissues.

<doc id="641159" wikidata="Q581763" url="?curid=641159" title="Graham Sutherland">
<text>Graham Vivian Sutherland (24 August 1903 – 17 February 1980) was a prolific English artist. Notable for his paintings of abstract landscapes and for his portraits of public figures, Sutherland also worked in other media, including printmaking, tapestry and glass design. 

Printmaking, mostly of romantic landscapes, dominated Sutherland&#x27;s work during the 1920s. He developed his art by working in watercolours before switching to using oil paints in the 1940s. A series of surreal oil paintings depicting the Pembrokeshire landscape secured his reputation as a leading British modern artist. He served as an official war artist in the Second World War, painting industrial scenes on the British home front. After the war, Sutherland embraced figurative painting, beginning with his 1946 work, &quot;The Crucifixion&quot;. Subsequent paintings combined religious symbolism with motifs from nature, such as thorns.

Such was Sutherland&#x27;s standing in post-war Britain that he was commissioned to design the massive central tapestry for the new Coventry Cathedral, &quot;Christ in Glory in the Tetramorph&quot;. A number of portrait commissions in the 1950s proved highly controversial. Winston Churchill hated Sutherland&#x27;s depiction of him and subsequently Lady Spencer-Churchill had the painting destroyed.

During his career, Sutherland taught at a number of art colleges, notably at Chelsea School of Art and at Goldsmiths College, where he had been a student. In 1955, Sutherland and his wife purchased a property near Nice. Living abroad led to something of a decline in his status in Britain. However, a visit to Pembrokeshire in 1967, his first trip there in nearly twenty years, led to a creative renewal that went some way toward restoring his reputation as a leading British artist.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Graham Sutherland was born in Streatham, London, the eldest of three children of George Humphrey Vivian Sutherland (1873–1952), a barrister who later became a civil servant in the Land Registry and the Board of Education, and his wife Elsie (1877–1957), née Foster. Both were amateur painters and musicians. Graham Sutherland attended Homefield Preparatory School in Sutton and was then educated at Epsom College in Surrey until 1919. Upon leaving school, after some preliminary coaching in art, Sutherland began an engineering apprenticeship at the Midland Railway locomotive works in Derby where several members of the extended Sutherland family had previously worked. After a year, Sutherland succeeded in persuading his father that he was not destined for a career in engineering and that he should be allowed to study art. After failing to gain a place at his first choice, the Slade School of Art, he entered Goldsmiths&#x27; School of Art in 1921, specialising in engraving and etching before graduating in 1926. In both 1925 and 1928, Sutherland exhibited drawings and engravings at the XXI Gallery in London. While still a student, Sutherland established a reputation as a fine printmaker and commercial printmaking would be his main source of income throughout the late 1920s. His early prints of pastoral subjects show the influence of Samuel Palmer, largely mediated by the older etcher, F.L. Griggs.

===1930s===

Following the collapse of the print market in the early 1930s, due to the Great Depression, Sutherland began to concentrate on painting. His early paintings were mainly landscapes and show an affinity with the work of Paul Nash. In 1934, Sutherland visited Pembrokeshire in Wales for the first time and was profoundly inspired by its landscape. The region remained a source for his paintings for much of the following decade and he visited the area each year until the start of the Second World War. Sutherland focused on the inherent strangeness of natural forms, abstracting them to sometimes give his work a surrealist appearance and in 1936 he exhibited at the International Surrealist Exhibition in London. As the 1930s progressed and the political situation in Europe grew worse, he began to depict ominous, distorted human forms emerging from the land. Oil paintings of the Pembrokeshire landscape dominated his first one-man exhibition of paintings, held in September 1938 at the Rosenberg and Helft Gallery in London. It was these oil paintings, of surreal, organic landscapes of the Pembrokeshire coast, that secured his reputation as a leading British modern artist.

Alongside oil painting, Sutherland also took up glass design, fabric design, and poster design during the 1930s, and taught engraving at the Chelsea School of Art from 1926. Between 1935 and 1940, he also taught composition and book illustration at Chelsea. Sutherland converted to Catholicism in December 1926, the year before his marriage to Kathleen Barry (1905–1991), who had been his fellow student at Goldsmiths College. The couple, who were inseparable, lived at various locations in Kent, before eventually buying a property in Trottiscliffe in 1945.

===World War Two===
At the start of World War Two, the Chelsea School of Art closed for the duration of the conflict and Sutherland moved to rural Gloucestershire. Between 1940 and 1945, Sutherland was employed as a full-time, salaried artist by the War Artists&#x27; Advisory Committee. He recorded bomb damage in rural and urban Wales towards the end of 1940, then bomb damage caused by the Blitz in the City and East End of London. Almost all of Sutherland&#x27;s paintings of bomb damage from the Blitz, either in Wales or in London, are titled &quot;Devastation:...&quot; and as such form a single body of work reflecting the needs of war-time propaganda, with precise locations not being disclosed and human remains not shown. A number of features reoccur within this body of work, for example, the fallen lift shafts that were often the most recognizable aspect of larger bombed buildings and a double row of bombed houses Sutherland saw in the Silvertown area of the East End.
Sutherland returned to Wales in September 1941 to work on a series of paintings of blast furnaces. From June 1942, he painted further industrial scenes, first at tin mines in Cornwall, then at a limestone quarry in Derbyshire, and then at open-cast and underground coal mines in the Swansea area of South Wales. Sutherland spent four months from the end of March 1944 at the Royal Ordnance Factory at Woolwich Arsenal working on a series of five paintings for WAAC. In December 1944, he was sent to depict the damage inflicted by the RAF on the railway yards at Trappes and on the flying bomb sites at Saint-Leu-d&#x27;Esserent in France. In all, Sutherland completed some 150 paintings as part of his WAAC commission.

===Post-war career===
In 1944, Sutherland was commissioned by Walter Hussey, the Vicar of St Matthew&#x27;s Church, Northampton, and an important patron of modern religious art, to paint &quot;The Crucifixion&quot; (1946). This was Sutherland&#x27;s first major religious painting and his first large figure study. &quot;The Crucifixion&quot; shows a pale Christ with broken limbs and was followed by a series of paintings that combined abstract forms from nature, usually the spikes and points of thorns, with religious iconography. A subsequent series, &quot;Origins of the Land&quot;, developed this approach, showing combinations of rocks and fossils in increasingly complex and abstract designs.

In 1946, Sutherland had his first exhibition in New York. That same year, he also taught painting at Goldsmiths&#x27; School of Art. From 1947 into the 1960s, his work was inspired by the landscape of the French Riviera, and he spent several months there each year. Eventually, in 1955, he purchased the villa Tempe à Pailla, designed by the Irish architect Eileen Gray, at Menton, near the French-Italian border.

===1950s===

Beginning in 1949, alongside his abstract works, Sutherland painted a series of portraits of leading public figures, with those of Somerset Maugham and Lord Beaverbrook among the best known. Beaverbrook regarded his portrait by Sutherland, which clearly depicted him as cunning and reptilian, as both an &quot;outrage&quot; and a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Maugham initially greatly disliked his portrait but came to admire it even though it had been described as making him look &quot;like the madam of a brothel&quot;. Sutherland&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Winston Churchill&quot; (1954) greatly upset the sitter, who initially refused to accept its presentation. The elderly Churchill had wanted to direct the composition towards a fictionalised scene but Sutherland had insisted upon a realistic portrayal, one described by Simon Schama as &quot;No bulldog, no baby face. Just an obituary in paint&quot;. After initially refusing to be presented with it at all, Churchill accepted the painting disparagingly as “a remarkable example of &quot;modern art&quot;&quot;. Although the painting was subsequently destroyed on the orders of Lady Spencer-Churchill, some of Sutherland&#x27;s studies for the portrait have survived. In all, Sutherland painted more than fifty portraits, often of European aristocrats or senior businessmen. Following the Churchill portrait, Sutherland&#x27;s portraits of, among others, Konrad Adenauer and the Queen Mother established him as something of an unofficial state portrait painter. This status was underlined by the award of the Order of Merit in 1960.

In 1951, Sutherland was commissioned to produce a large work for the Festival of Britain. He exhibited in the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1952 along with Edward Wadsworth and the New Aspects of British Sculpture Group. From 1948 until 1954, Sutherland served as a trustee of the Tate gallery.

In early 1954, Sutherland was commissioned to design a monumental tapestry for the new Coventry Cathedral. &quot;Christ in Glory in the Tetramorph&quot; took three years to complete and was installed in 1962. To complete the work, Sutherland visited the weavers, of Felletin in France, on nine occasions.

===Later life===

From his portrait work, Sutherland acquired several patrons in Italy and took to spending the summer in Venice. However, in 1967, for an Italian television documentary, Sutherland visited Pembrokeshire for the first time in more than twenty years and became inspired by the landscape to regularly work in the region until his death. Living abroad had led to something of a decline in his status in Britain, but his return to working in Pembrokeshire went some way toward restoring his reputation as a leading British artist.
Much of his work from this point until the end of his life incorporates motifs taken from the area, such as the estuaries at Sandy Haven and Picton. His work from this period includes two suites of prints &quot;The Bees&quot; (1976–77) and &quot;Apollinaire&quot; (1978–79).

There were major retrospective shows at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1951, the Tate in 1982, the Musée Picasso, Antibes, France in 1998 and the Dulwich Picture Gallery in 2005. A major exhibition of rarely seen works on paper by Sutherland, curated by artist George Shaw, was shown in Oxford, in 2011–12.

Sutherland died in 1980 and was buried in the graveyard of the Church of St Peter and St Paul in Trottiscliffe, Kent.

==Art market==
The highest price reached by one of his paintings at the art market was when &quot;The Crucifixion&quot; (1947) was sold at $1,156,549 by Sotheby&#x27;s London on 15 June 2011.

==Legacy==
The main building of Coventry School of Art and Design, part of Coventry University, is named after Sutherland. A radio play, &quot;Portrait of Winston&quot;, by Jonathan Smith, is a dramatisation of his portrait of Winston Churchill. The same incident features in the Netflix series, &quot;The Crown&quot;, in which Sutherland is played by Stephen Dillane, and was discussed by Simon Schama in his 2015 BBC television series &quot;The Face of Britain by Simon Schama&quot;. Works by Sutherland are held in the collections of Amgueddfa Cymru – Museum Wales, Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery, Huddersfield Art Gallery, Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, Manchester Art Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery, Northampton Museums and Art Gallery, Pallant House Gallery, Southampton City Art Gallery, The Ingram Collection of Modern British and Contemporary Art, Tenby Museum and Art Gallery, The Fitzwilliam Museum and The Priseman Seabrook Collection.

<doc id="641160" wikidata="Q11238641" url="?curid=641160" title="Lymphatic vessel">
<text>The lymphatic vessels (or lymph vessels or lymphatics) are thin-walled vessels (tubes), structured like blood vessels, that carry lymph. As part of the lymphatic system, lymph vessels are complementary to the cardiovascular system. Lymph vessels are lined by endothelial cells, and have a thin layer of smooth muscle, and adventitia that binds the lymph vessels to the surrounding tissue. Lymph vessels are devoted to the propulsion of the lymph from the lymph capillaries, which are mainly concerned with the absorption of interstitial fluid from the tissues. Lymph capillaries are slightly bigger than their counterpart capillaries of the vascular system. Lymph vessels that carry lymph to a lymph node are called afferent lymph vessels, and those that carry it from a lymph node are called efferent lymph vessels, from where the lymph may travel to another lymph node, may be returned to a vein, or may travel to a larger lymph duct. Lymph ducts drain the lymph into one of the subclavian veins and thus return it to general circulation.

The vessels that bring lymph away from the tissues and towards the lymph nodes can be classified as afferent vessels. These afferent vessels then drain into the subcapsular sinus. 
The efferent vessels that bring lymph from the lymphatic organs to the nodes bringing the lymph to the right lymphatic duct or the thoracic duct, the largest lymph vessel in the body. These vessels drain into the right and left subclavian veins, respectively. There are far more afferent vessels bringing in lymph than efferent vessels taking it out to allow for lymphocytes and macrophages to fulfill their immune support functions. The lymphatic vessels contain valves.

== Structure ==

The general structure of lymphatics is based on that of blood vessels. There is an inner lining of single flattened epithelial cells (simple squamous epithelium) composed of a type of epithelium that is called the endothelium, and the cells are called &quot;endothelial cells&quot;. This layer functions to mechanically transport fluid and since the basement membrane on which it rests is discontinuous; it leaks easily. The next layer is that of smooth muscles that are arranged in a circular fashion around the endothelium, which by shortening (contracting) or relaxing alter the diameter (caliber) of the lumen. The outermost layer is the adventitia which consists of fibrous tissue. The general structure described here is seen only in larger lymphatics; smaller lymphatics have fewer layers. The smallest vessels (&quot;lymphatic&quot; or &quot;lymph capillaries&quot;) lack both the muscular layer and the outer adventitia. As they proceed forward and in their course are joined by other capillaries, they grow larger and first take on an adventitia, and then smooth muscles.
The lymphatic conducting system broadly consists of two types of channels—the &quot;initial lymphatics&quot;, the &quot;prelymphatics&quot; or &quot;lymph capillaries&quot; that specialize in collection of the lymph from the interstital fluid, and the larger &quot;lymph vessels&quot; that propel the lymph forward.

Unlike the cardiovascular system, the lymphatic system is not closed and has no central pump. Lymph movement occurs despite low pressure due to peristalsis (propulsion of the lymph due to alternate contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle), valves, and compression during contraction of adjacent skeletal muscle and arterial pulsation.

=== Lymph capillaries ===
The lymphatic circulation begins with blind ending (closed at one end) highly permeable superficial lymph capillaries, formed by endothelial cells with button-like junctions between them that allow fluid to pass through them when the interstitial pressure is sufficiently high. These button-like junctions consist of protein filaments like platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, or PECAM-1. A valve system in place here prevents the absorbed lymph from leaking back into the interstital fluid. This valve system involves collagen fibers attached to lymphatic endothelial cells that respond to increased interstitial fluid pressure by separating the endothelial cells and allowing the flow of lymph into the capillary for circulation. There is another system of semilunar valves that prevents back-flow of lymph along the lumen of the vessel. Lymph capillaries have many interconnections (anastomoses) between them and form a very fine network.

Rhythmic contraction of the vessel walls through movements may also help draw fluid into the smallest lymphatic vessels, capillaries. If tissue fluid builds up the tissue will swell; this is called edema. As the circular path through the body&#x27;s system continues, the fluid is then transported to progressively larger lymphatic vessels culminating in the right lymphatic duct (for lymph from the right upper body) and the thoracic duct (for the rest of the body); both ducts &quot;drain&quot; into the circulatory system at the right and left subclavian veins. The system collaborates with white blood cells in lymph nodes to protect the body from being infected by cancer cells, fungi, viruses or bacteria. This is known as a secondary circulatory system.

===Lymph vessels===
The lymph capillaries drain into larger &quot;collecting lymphatics&quot;. These are &quot;contractile lymphatics&quot; which transport lymph using a combination of smooth muscle walls, which contract to assist in transporting lymph, as well as valves to prevent the lymph from flowing backwards. As the collecting lymph vessel accumulates lymph from more and more lymph capillaries along its length, it becomes larger and eventually becomes an afferent lymph vessel as it enters a lymphs node. The lymph percolates through the lymph node tissue and exits via an efferent lymph vessel. An efferent lymph vessel may directly drain into one of the (right or thoracic) lymph ducts, or may empty into another lymph node as its afferent lymph vessel. Both the lymph ducts return the lymph to the blood stream by emptying into the subclavian veins

Lymph vessels consist of functional units known as lymphangions which are segments separated by semilunar valves. These segments propel or resist the flow of lymph by the contraction of the encircling smooth muscle depending upon the ratio of its length to its radius.

== Function ==

Lymph vessels act as reservoirs for plasma and other substances including cells that have leaked from the vascular system and transport lymph fluid back from the tissues to the circulatory system. Without functioning lymph vessels, lymph cannot be effectively drained and lymphedema typically results.

===Afferent vessels===
The afferent lymph vessels enter at all parts of the periphery of the lymph node, and after branching and forming a dense plexus in the substance of the capsule, open into the &quot;lymph sinuses&quot; of the cortical part. It carries unfiltered lymph into the node. In doing this they lose all their coats except their endothelial lining, which is continuous with a layer of similar cells lining the lymph paths.

Afferent lymphatic vessels are only found in lymph nodes. This is in contrast to efferent lymphatic vessel which are also found in the thymus and spleen.

===Efferent vessels===
The efferent lymphatic vessel commences from the lymph sinuses of the medullary portion of the lymph nodes and leave the lymph nodes at the hilum, either to veins or greater nodes. It carries filtered lymph out of the node.

Efferent lymphatic vessels are also found in association with the thymus and spleen. This is in contrast to afferent lymphatic vessels, which are found only in association with lymph nodes.

==Clinical significance==
Lymphedema is the swelling of tissues due to insufficient fluid drainage by the lymphatic vessels. It can be the result from absent, underdeveloped or dysfunctional lymphatic vessels. In hereditary (or primary) lymphedema, the lymphatic vessels are absent, underdeveloped or dysfunctional due to genetic causes. In acquired (or secondary) lymphedema, the lymphatic vessels are damaged by injury or infection. Lymphangiomatosis is a disease involving multiple cysts or lesions formed from lymphatic vessels.

<doc id="641170" wikidata="Q1779576" url="?curid=641170" title="Pokhran">
<text>Pokhran (official spelling Pokaran; ) is a town and a municipality located 112 km east of Jaisalmer city in the Jaisalmer district of the Indian state of Rajasthan. It is situated in the Thar Desert region. Surrounded by rocks, sand and five salt ranges, the word &quot;Pokaran&quot; (पोकरण) means &quot;place surrounded by five salt-ranges&quot; in Rajasthani. The site for India&#x27;s first and second underground nuclear weapon test is near Pokhran.

== Geography ==
Pokhran is located 112 km east of Jaisalmer city, 172 km northwest of Jodhpur and 225 km south of Bikaner by road. It lies on Jaisalmer to Jodhpur railway line. It is situated at and has an average elevation of 233 metres (764 feet). 

It has arid climate as it lies in the Thar Desert and receives a little rain in the monsoon months July to September. Pokhran has extreme climate. It has extremely hot and dry summers from April to June though monsoon months are also very hot. The temperature in summer can reach 46°C during the day. The night temperature in summer is more than 30°C, Pokhran has very cold winters with temperature dropping to 1°C.

There is nothing much to see in Pokhran. Tourists may find winter pleasant during the day but they are not allowed near the nuclear test site.

== History ==
=== Fort Pokhran ===
Fort Pokhran, the 14th century citadel also known as &quot;Balagarh&quot;, stands amidst the Thar Desert. This monument is the premier fort of the chief of the Champawats, one of the clan of Rathores of the state of Marwar-Jodhpur. Fort Pokhran is open for visitors and is being currently run as heritage hotel by the royal family of Pokhran.

=== Sati Mata Memorial ===
On the outskirts of the town, the Satiyo Deval Sati Mata Memorial, a royal cenotaph, is freely accessible.

=== Former rulers ===
* Seat of Chief of the Champawats, a sub-clan of Rathores of the state of Marwar-Jodhpur.
* Bhawani Singh of Pokhran (b. 1911) was the last jagirdar of Pokhran before Indian independence. He was Sessions Judge and was elected to the 1st Lok Sabha, the Lower house of Indian parliament from Barmer-Jalore constituency, after getting elected as an Independent candidate in the 1952 Indian general election.

== Demographics ==
According to 2011 Indian census, Pokhran had a population of 28,457 within Pokaran Municipal Board territory. Males constitute 55% of the population and females 45%. Pokhran has an average literacy rate of 56%, lower than the national average of 74.0%: male literacy is 68%, and female literacy is 41%. In Pokhran, 19% of the population is under 6 years of age.

== Pokhran Test Range ==

The Pokhran Test Range (PTR) is a key component of India&#x27;s nuclear programme which is located outside the Pokaran Municipal Board jurisdiction and is controlled by the Indian Army. The army base is located 45 km north-west of Pokhran town and 4 km north of &quot;Khetolai&quot; village. 

The army base was built by the Indian Army Corps of Engineers and is under the control of Indian Army. It was built sometime before May 1974, when, following authorization given to the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre by then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, it hosted the detonation of India&#x27;s first nuclear device.

===Nuclear testings===

The Ministry of External Affairs designated the test &quot;Pokhran-I&quot;, but it is also known as &quot;Smiling Buddha&quot;. It was India&#x27;s first successful nuclear bomb test on 18 May 1974. The bomb was detonated on the army base Pokhran Test Range (PTR), in Rajasthan, by the Indian Army under the supervision of several key Indian generals.

On 11 and 13 May 1998, twenty-four years after Pokhran-I, the Indian Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) conducted five further nuclear tests, dubbed &quot;Pokhran-II&quot;, at the Pokhran range. Four AEC devices and, under the codename &quot;Shakti&quot;, a thermonuclear device were tested.

Since 2014, the elevated and frequent cancer deaths at the Khetolai has been attributed to the nuclear testing at the Pokhran Test Range.

<doc id="641177" wikidata="Q1690779" url="?curid=641177" title="Primary ciliary dyskinesia">
<text>Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic ciliopathy, that causes defects in the action of cilia lining the upper and lower respiratory tract, sinuses, Eustachian tube, middle ear, fallopian tube, and flagella of sperm cells. The alternative name of &quot;immotile ciliary syndrome&quot; is no longer favored as the cilia do have movement, but are merely inefficient or unsynchronized. When accompanied by situs inversus the condition is known as Kartagener syndrome.

Respiratory epithelial motile cilia, which resemble microscopic &quot;hairs&quot; (although structurally and biologically unrelated to hair), are complex organelles that beat synchronously in the respiratory tract, moving mucus toward the throat. Normally, cilia beat 7 to 22 times per second, and any impairment can result in poor mucociliary clearance, with subsequent upper and lower respiratory infection. Cilia also are involved in other biological processes (such as nitric oxide production), currently the subject of dozens of research efforts.

==Signs and symptoms==

Around 80% of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia experience respiratory problems beginning within a day of birth. Many have a collapsed lobe of the lung and blood oxygen low enough to require treatment with supplemental oxygen. Within the first few months of life, most develop a chronic mucus-producing cough and runny nose. The main consequence of impaired ciliary function is reduced or absent mucus clearance from the lungs, and susceptibility to chronic recurrent respiratory infections, including sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and otitis media. Progressive damage to the respiratory system is common, including progressive bronchiectasis beginning in early childhood, and sinus disease (sometimes becoming severe in adults). However, diagnosis is often missed early in life despite the characteristic signs and symptoms. In males, immotility of sperm can lead to infertility, although conception remains possible through the use of in vitro fertilization, there also are reported cases where sperm were able to move. Trials have also shown that there is a marked reduction in fertility in females with Kartagener&#x27;s syndrome due to dysfunction of the oviductal cilia.

Many affected individuals experience hearing loss and show symptoms of otitis media which demonstrates variable responsiveness to the insertion of myringotomy tubes or grommets. Some patients have a poor sense of smell, which is believed to accompany high mucus production in the sinuses (although others report normal – or even acute – sensitivity to smell and taste). Clinical progression of the disease is variable, with lung transplantation required in severe cases. Susceptibility to infections can be drastically reduced by an early diagnosis. Treatment with various chest physiotherapy techniques has been observed to reduce the incidence of lung infection and to slow the progression of bronchiectasis dramatically. Aggressive treatment of sinus disease beginning at an early age is believed to slow long-term sinus damage (although this has not yet been adequately documented). Aggressive measures to enhance clearance of mucus, prevent respiratory infections, and treat bacterial superinfections have been observed to slow lung-disease progression. The predicted incidence is 1 in approximately 7500.

==Genetics==
PCD is a genetically heterogeneous disorder affecting motile cilia which are made up of approximately 250 proteins. Around 90% of individuals with PCD have ultrastructural defects affecting protein(s) in the outer and/or inner dynein arms, which give cilia their motility, with roughly 38% of these defects caused by mutations on two genes, DNAI1 and DNAH5, both of which code for proteins found in the ciliary outer dynein arm.

There is an international effort to identify genes that code for inner dynein arm proteins or proteins from other ciliary structures (radial spokes, central apparatus, etc.) associated with PCD. The role of DNAH5 in heterotaxy syndromes and left-right asymmetry is also under investigation. At least 50 genes have been implicated in this condition.

Another gene associated with this condition is GAS2L2.

==Pathophysiology==

This condition is genetically inherited. Structures that make up the cilia, including inner and/or outer dynein arms, central apparatus, radial spokes, etc. are missing or dysfunctional and thus the axoneme structure lacks the ability to move. Axonemes are the elongated structures that make up cilia and flagella. Additionally, there may be chemical defects that interfere with ciliary function in the presence of adequate structure. Whatever the underlying cause, dysfunction of the cilia begins during and impacts the embryologic phase of development.
Specialised monocilia known as nodal cilia are at the heart of this problem. They lack the central-pair microtubules of ordinary motile cilia and so rotate clockwise rather than beat; in the primitive node at the anterior end of the primitive streak in the embryo, these are angled posteriorly such that they describe a D-shape rather than a circle. This has been shown to generate a net leftward flow in mouse and chick embryos, and sweeps the protein to the left, triggering normal asymmetrical development.

However, in some individuals with PCD, mutations thought to be in the gene coding for the key structural protein left-right dynein (&quot;lrd&quot;) result in monocilia which do not rotate. There is therefore no flow generated in the node, &quot;Shh&quot; moves at random within it, and 50% of those affected develop situs inversus, which can occur with or without dextrocardia, where the laterality of the internal organs is the mirror-image of normal. Affected individuals therefore have Kartagener syndrome. This is not the case with some PCD-related genetic mutations: at least 6% of the PCD population have a condition called situs ambiguus or heterotaxy, where organ placement or development is neither typical (situs solitus) nor totally reversed (situs inversus totalis) but is a hybrid of the two. Splenic abnormalities such as polysplenia, asplenia and complex congenital heart defects are more common in individuals with situs ambiguus and PCD, as they are in all individuals with situs ambiguus.

The genetic forces linking failure of nodal cilia and situs issues and the relationship of those forces to PCD are the subject of intense research interest. However, knowledge in this area is constantly advancing.

==Diagnosis==

Several diagnostic tests for this condition have been proposed. These include nasal nitric oxide levels as a screening test, light microscopy of biopsies for ciliary beat pattern and frequency and electron microscopic examination of dynein arms, as the definite diagnosis method. Genetic testing has also been proposed but this is difficult given that there are multiple genes involved.

===Classification===
When accompanied by the combination of situs inversus (reversal of the internal organs), chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis, it is known as Kartagener syndrome (only 50% of primary ciliary dyskinesia cases include situs inversus).

==Treatment==
There are no standardized effective treatment strategies for the condition. Current therapies for PCD are extrapolated from Cystic Fibrosis and patients with non-CF bronchiectasis and lack validation for PCD-specific use.

Severe fatal respiratory failure can develop; long-term treatment with macrolides such as clarithromycin, erythromycin and azithromycin has been empirically applied for the treatment of primary ciliary dyskinesia in Japan, though controversial due to the effects of the medications.

==Prognosis==
There is no reliable estimate of life expectancy for people with PCD. However, there is evidence that PCD, is a life altering life shortening multi-system condition, with some people progressing to lung transplant.

Decline in lung function in people with PCD has been observed in most studies, with FEV1 decline causing deterioration in health, impacting on, and reducing quality of life. With such a genetically and phenotypically heterogenous group, observation of median/mean decline in lung function risks regression to the mean, missing those groups with significantly worse lung function, masked by those with milder phenotypes.

The recent body of published data from respected clinicians in (the United Kingdom, Europe, North America, Canada and Israel) indicate that PCD morbidity and mortality appear to have been under-estimated by the medical community. While prospective outcome data is limited due to the early-stage patient registries, there is a growing body of evidence that dispels any &quot;myth that PCD is a mild disease.

The studies presented here demonstrate that children with PCD typically have worse lung function than those with cystic fibrosis. While previously it was thought that with early diagnosis, lung function could largely be prevented in children with PCD, poor lung function is repeatedly observed in children with PCD 1,30,32,33,36–38 and some develop bronchiectasis during childhood.

==Research==
Research to further the understanding of cilia, with the future aims of functional restoration of motile cilia is advancing. However, charitable funding for medical research, particularly for rare disease is vital and in the UK contributes to more than 50% of grants. The UK registered charity PCD Research supports research into PCD worldwide, with the ultimate aim of funding potentially curative research. Future promising avenues for functional replacement of cilia involve antisense, gene editing via CRISPR-Cas9 and mRNA therapies. At present there have only been a handful of interventional trials in PCD.

==History==
The classic symptom combination associated with PCD was first described in 1904 by A. K. Siewert, while Manes Kartagener published his first report on the subject in 1933. The disorder is rarely referred to as Siewert&#x27;s syndrome or Siewert-Kartagener syndrome.

<doc id="641193" wikidata="Q6938085" url="?curid=641193" title="Murder of the Hatuel family">
<text>The Murder of the Hatuel family was a shooting attack on May 2, 2004, in which Palestinian militants killed Tali Hatuel, a Jewish settler, who was eight months pregnant, and her four daughters, aged two to eleven. The attack took place near the Kissufim Crossing near their home in Gush Katif bloc of Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip during the Second Intifada. After shooting at the vehicle in which Hatuel was driving with her daughters, witnesses said the militants approached the vehicle and shot the occupants repeatedly at close range.

An alliance of Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committees claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it was carried out in reprisal for the assassinations of Hamas leaders Sheikh Ahmad Yassin and Abdelaziz Rantisi by the Israeli army some weeks earlier.

The attack shocked the Israeli public, and was classified by Amnesty International as a crime against humanity. On June 6, 2007, the IDF arrested Jihad Salah Saliman Abu Dahar, a Palestinian member of Islamic Jihad from the Khan Yunis area, who according to Shin Bet officials admitted to several acts of violence, including the attack on Hatuel and her daughters.

== Background ==
In 1992 David and Tali Hatuel, a Jewish Israeli couple, moved from Ofakim, in southern Israel, to the Israeli settlement Katif located in the Gush Katif bloc in the Gaza Strip. David Hatuel was familiar with Gush Katif having studied in a yeshiva there. After 3 years the couple left for 18 months but returned once they had completed their studies. Tali worked as a social worker with the Gaza Coast Regional Council. Her work included counseling Israelis whose relatives had been killed in the conflict. David worked as a school principal in Ashkelon. They had four daughters and Tali was eight months pregnant with a son when she was killed.

==The attack==
On Sunday, May 2, 2004, Hatuel picked up her three oldest daughters from school and drove with them and their 2-year-old sister in the family station wagon towards her husband&#x27;s workplace in Ashkelon to campaign against Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement plan. Likud party members were voting that day in a legally non-binding, advisory referendum being conducted across Israel and in Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories on Ariel Sharon&#x27;s disengagement proposal. While traveling in the vicinity of the Kissufim Crossing at 12:40 pm, two armed Palestinian militants, who had prepared an ambush near the highway, opened fire at the car, causing the car to spin off the road. The attackers, who were armed with automatic rifles, then approached the vehicle and fired their weapons from close range at Hatuel and her daughters repeatedly. The gunmen also opened fire on an Israeli civilian from Ohad in southern Israel traveling in a separate car. He managed to reverse and drive away injured. A CNN film crew working near Gush Katif who had come under fire by the militants earlier had attempted to warn and stop Israeli civilian vehicles leaving Gush Katif, among them Hatuel and her four daughters who drove past the armored CNN car.

Twenty minutes before the attack, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had received information about a possible attack and were strengthening forces in the area. The IDF killed both of the gunmen, identified as Ibrahim Mohammad Hammad (22), and Faisal Abu Naqira (26), reportedly from the Rafah refugee camp. A sniper stationed close by killed one of the men and soldiers sent to the scene charged the other attacker and shot him. Two soldiers from the Givati Brigade who were in a vehicle behind the Hatuel car were also injured during the battle. An explosive device was set off near the attack site but it did not result in any injuries. The Popular Resistance Committees and Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it was carried out in reprisals for the assassinations of Hamas leaders Sheikh Ahmad Yassin and Abdelaziz Rantisi by the Israeli army earlier the same year and reportedly described it as &quot;heroic&quot;.

==Aftermath==
Tali Hatuel and her children were the first settlers in Gaza to be killed since 2002 and the attack &quot;provoked extreme tension in Gaza&quot;. The deaths brought the total number of people killed in the Second Intifada to 3,958 at that time, 905 Israelis and 2,983 Palestinians.

Following the attack, Israeli helicopters fired three missiles at a tower-block in the Rimal neighbourhood of Gaza City that housed a radio station with links to Hamas which the IDF alleged had been broadcasting &quot;incitement&quot;. The attack on the building, which also contained apartments, businesses, and the two main Palestinian newspapers, al-Ayyam and al-Quds, collapsed part of the roof, cut off the building&#x27;s electricity and wounded seven people. Hours later, an Israeli air strike on a car in the West Bank city of Nablus killed four people described as members of the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades by Palestinian sources. The IDF described them as &quot;senior terrorists&quot; who had been responsible for several attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers.

On May 9, 2004, a week after the attack, two gunmen reportedly dressed in women&#x27;s clothing, opened fire on about 200 to 300 people attending a heavily guarded memorial service on the Kissufim road in the southern Gaza Strip for Tali Hatuel and her daughters. Mourners had to take cover behind vehicles during the 20 to 30 minute exchange of fire. The gunmen opened fire on the attendees from about 300 meters away. David Hatuel was not present having been stopped on the way by soldiers once the shooting started. No Israelis were injured in the attack. The body of one gunman killed by the Israel Defense Forces was recovered after a search of the area but the IDF said that they believed a second gunman was also killed. Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack. After the attack, the chairman of the Gaza Coast Regional Council said &quot;The IDF needs to open a corridor of one kilometer on either side of the road&quot;. Settlers in the area had complained that the IDF had not demolished Palestinian homes next to the Kissufim road where the attack took place.

The following day, on May 10, 2004, IDF troops shot dead a 22-year-old local Palestinian when Israeli bulldozers razed a row of homes and a four-storey block of flats was demolished in the Khan Yunis refugee camp a few hundred meters from where the attack took place. Palestinian sources, international aid organizations and media sources variously reported that 75 Palestinians or 50 families were left homeless by the action. By May 10, according to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, 1,100 Palestinians had been made homeless by Israeli military raids in Gaza in what they described as &quot;one of the most intense periods of destruction for years&quot; and &quot;illegal collective punishment&quot; for the killing of Tali Hatuel and children. The IDF described the figures as &quot;highly exaggerated&quot; and said they only demolished buildings that they had confirmed had been used by militants to attack Israeli targets.

Near the end of May, during Operation Rainbow, the Israeli army demolished a building across the street from the home of Ibrahim Hammad, one of the perpetrators of the attack on the Hatuel family. According to a neighbor, residents had already left the area on the assumption that Hammad&#x27;s house would be demolished. According to Human Rights Watch, Hammad&#x27;s house was not harmed but a house across the street belonging to Mahmoud Abu Arab was bulldozed instead. Abu Arab submitted a claim for compensation from the Israeli authorities.

On September 25, 2005, the Israeli Air Force killed the organizer of the attack, Sheikh Khalil, in a targeted assassination, described by Islamic Jihad as one of its &quot;most senior commanders in Palestine.&quot; Khalil, who had survived several previous assassination attempts, died when an Israeli helicopter gunship fired a missile at his car in the Gaza Strip. His deputy was also killed and four others were injured. Israel military officials stated that Khalil had orchestrated several attacks on Israelis.

On June 6, 2007, the IDF arrested Jihad Salah Saliman Abu Dahar, a member of Islamic Jihad from the Khan Yunis area, who according to Shin Bet officials admitted to involvement in violence, including the Hatuel murder. Abu Dahar reportedly admitted to carrying out surveillance of the attack site and IDF patrols in the weeks prior to the murders and on May 2, 2004, he notified his commanders when IDF patrols were absent.

On May 9, 2023, Jihad Ghanem, a top official in the Islamic Jihad military council and one of the orchestrators of the attack on the Hatuel family, was killed during an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City.

==Reactions==
Ariel Sharon, Prime Minister of Israel at the time, condemned the attack as a &quot;brutal crime against civilians and children.&quot; In Damascus, Ramadan Shallah, the leader of Palestinian Islamic Jihad said killing of Israeli women and children was permissible &quot;because they decided spontaneously to go live in a war zone&quot;. The attack was strongly condemned by Amnesty International as a deliberate attack against civilians and therefore a crime against humanity as defined by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The commissioner general of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) condemned the killings of Tali Hatuel and her children but accused the Israel authorities of carrying out reprisal demolitions of Palestinian homes in some areas as a form of collective punishment forbidden by international law.

==Commemoration==
The funeral, held in Ashkelon the same day as the attack, was attended by thousands of mourners including Moshe Katsav, the President of Israel at the time.

On June 16, 2004, Ben-Gurion University in the Negev awarded Tali Hatuel a posthumous Masters of Arts degree in Social Work, and granted her husband a Masters of Arts in Jewish Philosophy.

On July 25, 2004, Hatuel&#x27;s husband David was given a place of prominence near the Western Wall in the human chain from the Gaza Strip to Jerusalem protesting against Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from Gaza in which over 130,000 Israelis took part.

On August 22, 2005, the day Katif was evacuated, David Hatuel addressed the settlers, defining the day as one of destruction and expulsion, thanking his fellow residents for their support after the murder of his wife and children, adding: &quot;We are going through a crisis, an unfathomable hardship; but we will not despair and we will not fall.&quot; In December of the same year, he married Limor Shem-Tov, an occupational therapist, stating: &quot;I have two options, either to collapse or to continue living. I have chosen life! My new home is an addition and not a replacement of the home that was destroyed. I am like a tree whose branches were cut off and now they are growing again.&quot; He and Shem-Tov had three sons and a daughter.

<text>George Charles Boldt Sr. (April 25, 1851 – December 5, 1916) was a Prussian-born American hotelier. A self-made millionaire, he influenced the development of the urban hotel as a civic social center and luxury destination.

==Life and career==
He was born as Georg Karl Boldt in Bergen auf Rügen, Pommern, on April 25, 1851. He immigrated to the United States in 1864. He began as a kitchen worker in New York and, at age 25, was hired (by his future father-in-law) to manage the dining room of Philadelphia&#x27;s most exclusive gentlemen&#x27;s club, The Philadelphia Club.

Boldt&#x27;s first hotel was the Bellevue (1881), at the northwest corner of Broad &amp; Walnut Streets, in Philadelphia. He soon bought a competing hotel, the Stratford, at the southwest corner. Two decades later, on the site of the Stratford, he built the largest hotel the city had ever seen, the 1,090-room Bellevue-Stratford Hotel (1902–04, now the Hyatt).

The enormous fortunes generated by robber barons in the post-Civil War Era led to an unprecedented level of luxurious living for wealthy Americans. Boldt catered to this new super-rich class, charging the highest prices for the very best, and becoming one of them in the process.

William Waldorf Astor built the Waldorf Hotel (1890–93) in New York City, with Boldt as proprietor. John Jacob Astor IV built the adjoining Astoria Hotel (1897). Boldt mediated between the feuding millionaire cousins, leasing the Astoria himself, and merging the two buildings under his management as the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. The Empire State Building now occupies its site at 34th Street and 5th Avenue. He is credited with popularizing Thousand Island dressing at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where he instructed the maître d&#x27;, Oscar Tschirky, to include it on the menu. The hotel introduced other popular food items, such as Waldorf Salad. Boldt also owned the Waldorf Astoria Segar Company, which imported fine Cuban cigars and was located at the hotel.

He built Boldt Castle on an island in the Thousand Islands area of New York State. The enormous castle was intended as a gift for his wife, Louise Kehrer Boldt, but when she died suddenly on January 7, 1904, in Manhattan, at the age of 42, construction was halted. The castle, near Alexandria Bay, was restored after decades of vandalism and is now a major summer tourist attraction.

Towards the end of his life, he commissioned architect Francis T. Underhill to build him a Swiss-chalet-style mansion, &quot;La Manzanita,&quot; in Montecito, Santa Barbara, California.

Boldt died on December 5, 1916, in Manhattan, New York City of a heart attack. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx, New York.

==Legacy==
Boldt once owned Nikola Tesla&#x27;s Wardenclyffe Tower property, receiving it as payment for a debt. Tesla mortgaged the property to Boldt and the Waldorf-Astoria to pay the costs of his residence at the hotel when he encountered financial difficulties. Tesla did so first in 1904 and again in 1908; he was unable to repay the mortgages. Boldt and the Waldorf-Astoria foreclosed on the property in 1915.

He was a trustee of Cornell University. In 1923, Boldt&#x27;s daughter, Mrs. Alfred G. Miles, donated US$50,000 to the university for the construction of Boldt Tower to honor her father&#x27;s memory. Boldt Hall is also named for him. Three bricks from the original structure of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel were incorporated into the building. Saying that his father always sympathized with an eager student whose only impediment to higher education was a lack of funds, Boldt&#x27;s son George C. Boldt Jr. established a scholarship program at Cornell bearing his father&#x27;s name in 1922.

During his lifetime, Boldt was a frequent donor to Cornell University, the American Red Cross, many local hospitals and built a library at Alexandria Bay, New York. Boldt also helped put at least 75 young men through college, doing this anonymously. He also assisted those in business who were having financial difficulties and told employees at his hotels if they were having monetary problems, his door was always open to them.

Boldt&#x27;s will equally divided US$15 million between his son and daughter, with a request to his children that they continue to financially support the charities he had donated to in the past. While the will gave his children the right to dispose of any or all of Boldt&#x27;s properties, they made no plans to sell any of their father&#x27;s holdings, with George Charles Boldt Jr. assuming the presidency of the company his father began.

==Family==
From his marriage to Louise Augusta Kehrer, he had two children: George Charles Boldt Jr. and Clover Louise Boldt, later Mrs. Alfred Graham Miles, and three granddaughters.

<doc id="641200" wikidata="Q60236" url="?curid=641200" title="Marie-Louise von Franz">
<text>Marie-Louise von Franz (4 January 1915 – 17 February 1998) was a Swiss Jungian psychologist and scholar, known for her psychological interpretations of fairy tales and of alchemical manuscripts. She worked and collaborated with Carl Jung from 1933, when she met him, until he died in 1961.

==Early life and education==
Marie-Louise Ida Margareta von Franz was born in Munich, Germany, the daughter of a colonel in the Austrian army.

After World War I, in 1919, her family moved to Switzerland, near St. Gallen. From 1928 on, she lived in Zürich, together with her elder sister, so that both could attend a high school (gymnasium) in Zürich, specializing in languages and literature. Three years later, her parents moved to Zürich as well.

==Meeting Carl Gustav Jung==
In Zürich, at the age of 18, in 1933, when about to finish secondary school, von Franz met the psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung when, together with a classmate and nephew of Jung&#x27;s assistant Toni Wolff, she and seven boys she had befriended were invited by Jung to his Bollingen Tower near Zürich. For von Franz, this was a powerful and &quot;decisive encounter of her life&quot;, as she told her sister later the same evening.
At the meeting, Jung and the pupils discussed psychology. When Jung commented on a &quot;mentally ill woman, who [actually, not to be taken symbolically] lived on the moon&quot; M.-L. von Franz understood, that there are two levels of reality. The psychological, inner world with its dreams and myths was as real as the outer world.

==Studies, lean times and private tutoring==
In 1933, at the University of Zurich, von Franz started studies in Classical philology and Classical languages (Latin and Greek) as major subjects and in literature and ancient history as minor subjects.

Due to her father&#x27;s major financial loss in the early 1930s, she had to self-finance her tuition, by giving private lessons as a tutor in Latin and Greek for gymnasium and university students. In the years after finishing her studies, she continued this to support herself, working on fairy tale texts.

In addition to her university studies, von Franz occupied herself with Jungian psychology. She attended Jung&#x27;s psychological lectures at the Swiss Federal Polytechnical School in Zürich (now the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zürich) and, in 1935 and thereafter, also attended his psychological seminars. In 1934 she started analytical training with Jung.

==Collaboration with C.G. Jung==
In order to pay C.G. Jung for her training analysis, she translated works for him from Greek and Latin texts. Among others, she translated two major alchemical manuscripts: Aurora Consurgens, which has been attributed to Thomas Aquinas, and Musaeum Hermeticum. As many of its passages were of Islamic and Persian origin, von Franz took up Arabic as study subject at university.

This was the beginning of a long-standing collaboration with C.G. Jung, which continued until his death in 1961. Their collaboration was especially close in the field of alchemy. Not only did she translate works, she also commented on the origin and psychological meaning of Aurora Consurgens. She offered support for the theory that the Christian-alchemical text might have been dictated by Thomas Aquinas himself.

The experience that Jung termed &quot;objective Psyche&quot; or &quot;collective unconscious&quot; marked her life and work as well as her way of living. She worked to understand the reality of this autonomous psyche acting independently from consciousness.

==Career==
Von Franz worked with Carl Jung, whom she met in 1933 and with whom she collaborated until his death in 1961.

From 1942 on until her death, Marie-Louise von Franz practised as an analyst, mainly in Küsnacht, Switzerland. In 1987, she claimed to have interpreted over 65,000 dreams.

She wrote more than 20 books on analytical psychology, most notably on fairy tales as they relate to archetypal psychology and depth psychology. She amplified the themes and characters of these tales and focused on subjects such as the problem of evil, the changing attitude towards the female archetype.

Another field of interest and writing was alchemy, which von Franz discussed from the Jungian psychological perspective. She edited, translated and commented on &quot;Aurora Consurgens&quot;, attributed to Thomas Aquinas, on the problem of opposites in alchemy. During her last years of life, she commented on the Arabic alchemical manuscript of Muḥammad Ibn Umail &quot;Hal ar-Rumuz&quot; (Solving the Symbols). For alchemists, &quot;imaginatio vera&quot; was an important approach to matter. It resembles in many aspects the active imagination discovered by C. G. Jung. Marie-Louise von Franz lectured in 1969 about active imagination and alchemy and also wrote about it in &quot;Man and His Symbols&quot;. Active imagination may be described as conscious dreaming. In &quot;Man and His Symbols&quot; she wrote:
A third field of interest and research was synchronicity, psyche and matter, and numbers. It seems to have been triggered by Jung, whose research had led him to the hypothesis about the unity of the psychic and material worlds—that they are one and the same, just different manifestations. He also believed that this concept of the &quot;unus mundus&quot; could be investigated by means of researching archetypes. Due to his advanced age, he turned the problem over to von Franz. Two of her books, &quot;Number and Time&quot; and &quot;Psyche and Matter&quot;, deal with this research.

In 1968, von Franz was the first to argue that the mathematical structure of DNA is analogous to that of the &quot;I Ching&quot;. She cited the &quot;I Ching&quot; in an essay, &quot;Symbols of the Unus Mundus&quot;, published in her book &quot;Psyche and Matter&quot;.

Another basic concern throughout many of her works was how the collective unconscious compensates for the one-sidedness of Christianity and its ruling god image, via fairy tales and alchemy.
In an analysis of the visions of Saint Perpetua, a martyr, she writes that such visions enable us to gain a deep insight into the unconscious spiritual situation of the time. They show the deep conflict of that time, the transition from Paganism to Christianity. &quot;The martyrs appear in many respects as the tragic, unconscious victims of the transformation which was then being fulfilled deep down in the collective stratum of the human soul: the transformation of the image of God&quot; 
Another compensatory motif is the symbolism of the vessel of the holy grail in &quot;The Grail legend&quot;. In this book she discusses the psychological symbolism of the documented legends of the Holy Grail. It evolved out of the completion of Emma Jung&#x27;s unfinished research, which Marie-Louise von Franz had been asked to take over and publish after Emma Jung&#x27;s death.

In the visions of Swiss &quot;Saint Nikolaus von Flüe&quot; she dealt with the aspects of the dark and evil as well as the cosmic side as part of a more holistic image of god. Von Franz says that the visions reveal basic tendencies of collective unconscious that seem to strive to further develop the Christian symbolism and by that giving points of orientation, showing where the unconscious psyche wants to let us notice and understand the problem of opposites and by that to bring us to more closeness and fear of God.

===Films===
In addition to her many books, von Franz made a series of films in 1987 titled &quot;The Way of the Dream&quot;, along with her student, Fraser Boa. In &quot;The Wisdom of the Dream&quot;, a channel 4 television series, London 1989, von Franz was interviewed. Text of the film is printed in: Seegaller, S. and Berger, M: &quot;Jung – the Wisdom of the Dream&quot;. London 1989.

===Lectures===
In 1941–1944 von Franz was an associate member of the Psychological Club, Zürich. There she first lectured on the visions of Perpetua on June 7, 1941, which later was expanded and published as her first book &quot;The Visions of Perpetua&quot;. In the following years, she held many lectures at the Zürich Psychological Club. They constituted the basis of many of her books.

Between 1942 and 1952 she acted as its librarian.

In 1944 she became one of its full members.

In 1948, she was a co-founder of the C. G. Jung Institute in Zürich.

In 1974, von Franz together with some of her pupils (René Malamud, Willi Obrist, Alfred Ribi, and Paul Walder) founded the &quot;Stiftung für Jung&#x27;sche Psychologie&quot; (Foundation for Jungian Psychology). The aim of this foundation is to support research and promulgation of findings in the field of Jungian depth psychology. It also publishes the journal &quot;Jungiana&quot;.

==Interpretation of fairy tales==
In 1935 Hedwig von Beit asked Marie-Louise von Franz to assist her part-time with writing a book about fairy tales. Von Franz embarked on a time-consuming 9-years research and interpretation work. Fairy tales became increasingly important to her in regard to psychological questions. The work is published in the book &quot;Symbolik des Märchens&quot; (Symbolism of Fairy Tales). Nevertheless, this book (of 3 volumes) was only published under the name of Hedwig von Beit. In her later talks and books, she connects fairy tale interpretation with everyday life. Alfred Ribi says, that von Franz might well be understood as the first to discover and demonstrate the psychological wisdom of fairy tales.

Von Franz&#x27;s interpretation of fairy tales is based on Jung&#x27;s view of fairy tales as a spontaneous and naive product of soul, which can only express what soul is. That means, she looks at fairy tales as images of different phases of experiencing the reality of the soul. They are the &quot;purest and simplest expression of collective unconscious psychic processes&quot; and &quot;they represent the archetypes in their simplest, barest and most concise form&quot; because they are less overlaid with conscious material than myths and legends. &quot;In this pure form, the archetypal images afford us the best clues to the understanding of the processes going on in the collective psyche&quot;. &quot;The fairy tale itself is its own best explanation; that is, its meaning is contained in the totality of its motifs connected by the thread of the story. [...] Every fairy tale is a relatively closed system compounding one essential psychological meaning which is expressed in a series of symbolical pictures and events and is discoverable in these&quot;. 
The fairy tales&#x27; hero and heroine – with which the auditor identifies – are taken as archetypal figures (not as common human ego) representing the archetypal foundation of the ego-complex of an individual or a group. &quot;The hero restores to healthy, normal functioning a situation in which all egos of that tribe or nation are deviating from their instinctive basic totality pattern. Hero and Heroine form &quot;a model of an ego [...] demonstrating a rightly functioning ego, [...] in accordance with the requirements of the Self&quot;.

G. Isler explains further, &quot;The figure of the hero as well as the whole story compensate what initially was an insufficient or wrong attitude of consciousness. The initial situation of need, misery and shortcomings is solved at the end having a structure which is more whole than the beginning. This corresponds to a renewal of the ruling consciousness (expressed e.g. in the young king), being oriented towards psychic wholeness and totality in a way that is more appropriate&quot; to the demands of the Self, than before. &quot;Fairy tales compensate individual consciousness, but also an insufficient attitude of collective consciousness, which in European culture has been coined mainly by Christianity.&quot; In contrast to personalistic-subjective ways of interpretation, the fate of the hero is not understood as individual neurosis, but as difficulties and dangers, being imposed on man by nature.

==Personal life==
Jung encouraged von Franz to live with fellow Jungian analyst Barbara Hannah, who was 23 years older than she was. When Hannah asked Jung why he was so keen on putting them together, Jung replied that he wanted von Franz &quot;to see that not all women are such brutes as her mother&quot;. Jung also stated that &quot;the real reason you should live together is that your chief interest will be analysis, and analysts should not live alone.&quot; The two women became lifelong friends.

===Correspondence with Wolfgang Pauli===
Von Franz had a lengthy exchange of letters with Wolfgang Pauli, winner of a Nobel Prize in physics. On Pauli&#x27;s death, his widow Franca deliberately destroyed all the letters von Franz had sent to her husband, and which he had kept locked inside his writing desk. The letters sent by Pauli to von Franz were all saved and were later made available to researchers (and published as well).

===Bollingen tower===
Von Franz was passionately interested in nature and gardening. In order to meet her love for nature, she acquired a piece of land at the borders of a large forest above Bollingen. At this site, in 1958, she built a quadrate tower following the example of C. G. Jung. The tower was meant to be a hermitage, having neither electricity nor a flushing cistern. She collected wood for heating and cooking from the surrounding woods. There was also a bog pond, abundant with toads and frogs, which she loved. This tower enabled her &quot;to escape modern civilization and all its unrest from time to time and to find a refuge in nature&quot;, as her sister reported. There she felt &quot;in tune with the spirit of nature&quot; and wrote many of the books that she had planned early on in her life, and which she realised one after the other throughout the decades.

== Later years ==
Between the 1950s and 1970s, von Franz travelled widely, not only for holidays but also for lecturing. She visited European countries including Austria, England, Germany, Greece, Italy and Scotland, as well as America, Egypt and some Asian countries.
After 1986 she turned to a more introverted life at her home in Küsnacht, Switzerland. Several times a year she took a retreat into her Bollingen tower, which in some years was up to a five months stay. She concentrated mainly on her creative work, especially alchemy and continued to meet friends and patients from all over the world.

==Illness and death==
During her last years, von Franz had Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Barbara Davies stated that she took only a minimum of medicine, so that she was increasingly physically affected by her illness until death, but could keep a clear mind and consciousness.

Von Franz died in Küsnacht, Switzerland on 17 February 1998. She was 83.

<doc id="641207" wikidata="Q7248788" url="?curid=641207" title="Progressive Party of Manitoba (1981–1995)">
<text>The Progressive Party of Manitoba was a political party in Manitoba, Canada which existed from 1981 to 1995. The party was created in March 1981 by five former members of the province&#x27;s New Democratic Party: Sidney Green, Ben Hanuschak, Bud Boyce, Murdoch Mackay and Max Hofford. Green was acknowledged as the party&#x27;s leader.

Despite its name, this party had no connection with the original Progressive Party of Manitoba, which was created in 1922 and governed the province from its founding until 1958 (after 1932 in an alliance with the Manitoba Liberal Party).

Green, Hanuschak and Boyce were members of the provincial legislature in 1981, having been elected as NDP candidates. All three had served as cabinet ministers in the government of Edward Schreyer (1969–1977).

The party was regarded as socialist, and promoted traditionally leftist policies such as full employment and increased profits taxation on resource industries. However, it was also influenced by ideas usually associated with the radical right.

Green had left the NDP in 1979. Green opposed what he described as &quot;special privileges&quot; for unions and minority groups, and was particularly opposed to the NDP&#x27;s plans for anti-scab legislation. These views were reflected in Progressive Party policy.

The Progressives were the third-largest party in the provincial legislature (the Liberals having been reduced to one seat in 1977), and sought to run a full slate of candidates in 1981. They were unable to do this, however, and were unable to mount a successful challenge against the dominant NDP and Progressive Conservatives. All Progressive candidates were defeated, including the three incumbents; Green placed a poor third in Inkster, which he had represented since 1966.

The Progressive Party never recovered from this early loss. It ran twelve candidates in 1986 (including Green and Hanuschak), but all fared poorly. The party was reduced to six candidates in 1988, although it received some attention for featuring former premier Douglas Campbell (of the original Progressive Party) at one of its rallies. The Progressives ran five candidates in 1990, the minimum required for ballot status.

During its later years, the Progressive Party began veering further to the right. In 1990, its campaign literature emphasized balanced budgets, and rejected distinct status for minority groups.

Green, who remained the party&#x27;s leader throughout all stages of its development, dissolved the Progressive Party on July 13, 1995 when his attempts to find a successor came to nothing.

<text>Cropmarks or crop marks are a means through which sub-surface archaeological, natural and recent features may be visible from the air or a vantage point on higher ground or a temporary platform. Such marks, along with parch marks, soil marks and frost marks, can reveal buried man-made structures that are not visible from the ground.

==Description==

Crop marks are due to the principle of differential growth. One of the factors controlling the growth of vegetation is the condition of the soil. A buried stone wall, for example, will affect crop growth above it, as its presence channels water away from its area and occupies the space of the more fertile soil. Conversely, a buried ditch, with a fill containing more organic matter than the natural earth, provides much more conducive conditions and water will naturally collect there, nourishing the plants growing above.

The differences in conditions will cause some plants to grow more strongly and therefore taller, and others less strongly and therefore shorter. Some species will also react through differential ripening of their fruits or their overall colour. 

Particularly effective crops that exhibit differential growth include cereal crops, peas, and potatoes. 

Differential growth will naturally follow any features buried below. Although the growth differences may appear small close up, from the air the pattern they make is more visible, as the small changes can be seen as marked differences in tone or colour in the context of the normally growing surrounding vegetation. When the sun is low to the horizon, shadows cast by the taller crops can also become visible.

By their nature crop marks are visible only seasonally and may not be visible at all except in exceptionally wet or dry years. Droughts can be especially useful to cropmark hunters, as the differential growth can become apparent in normally hardy species such as grass. The drought of 2010 produced particularly good conditions for observing crop marks in the UK. Pre-parching stress in crops and grass, and others factors that may affect plant health, can be captured in near infra-red photography. 
An alternative approach is thermal imaging, where differential water loss (which is dependent of the availability of water at the roots) can create temperature differences, which result in thermal crop marks that are potentially visible at any time during crop growth. Thermal imaging can also reveal archaeological residues as a result of thermal inertia (storage heater effect) or differential evaporation. The interaction of the processes involved can be complex and the prediction of optimal imaging time, for a given site, further complicated by environmental conditions including temperature variation and relative humidity.
 Thermal inertia and differential transpiration/evaporation are involved. 

The usefulness of cropmarks to archaeologists has largely been a fruit of inspection from aircraft, but the possibility was suggested by Rev. Gilbert White in &quot;The Natural History of Selborne&quot; (1789), in a note appended to his Letter VI, to Thomas Pennant, with reference to local people&#x27;s success in searching for bog oak for house construction, by discovering these trees &quot;by the hoar frost, which lay longer over the space where they were concealed, than on the surrounding morass.&quot; To White it suggested the query &quot;might not such observations be reduced to domestic use, by promoting the discovery of old obliterated drains and wells about houses; and in Roman stations and camps lead to the finding of pavements, baths and graves, and other hidden relics of curious antiquity?&quot;

==Examples==

Examples of archaeological sites where cropmarks have been observed are Balbridie and Fetteresso in Scotland.

In 2009, investigation of crop marks near Stonehenge revealed a variety of 6,000-year-old prehistoric subterranean structures.

Another example is the rediscovery of the Roman city Altinum, a precursor to the city of Venice, from a combination of visible and near-infrared photos of the area taken during a drought in 2007, which stressed the maize and soy crops. 

The multi period site at Mucking was discovered as a result of aerial photographs showing cropmarks and soil marks. The earliest photographs to reveal the site were taken by the Luftwaffe in 1943. The importance of the site was recognised following photographs taken by Kenneth St Joseph in 1959 (published in 1964). In 1982, Margaret Jones (site director at the Mucking excavation) said that some sites were being interpreted on crop mark evidence alone. She said that some features do not produce crop marks and that some crop marks, when excavated, turn out not to be what they seem.

<doc id="641227" wikidata="Q1662626" url="?curid=641227" title="Multihoming">
<text>Multihoming is the practice of connecting a host or a computer network to more than one network. This can be done in order to increase reliability or performance.

A typical host or end-user network is connected to just one network. Connecting to multiple networks can increase reliability because if one connection fails, packets can still be routed through the remaining connection. Connecting to multiple networks can also improve performance because data can be transmitted and received through the multiple connections simultaneously multiplying throughput and, depending on the destination, it may be more efficient to route through one network or the other.

== Variants ==

There are several different ways to perform multihoming.

=== Host multihoming ===

A single host may be connected to multiple networks. For example, a mobile phone might be simultaneously connected to a WiFi network and a 4G network, and a desktop computer might be connected to both a home network and a VPN. A multihomed host usually is assigned multiple addresses, one per connected network.

=== Classic multihoming ===

In classic multihoming, a network is connected to multiple providers and uses its own range of addresses (typically from a Provider Independent (PI) range). The network&#x27;s edge routers communicate with the providers using a dynamic routing protocol, typically BGP, which announces the network&#x27;s address range to all providers. If one of the links fails, the dynamic routing protocol recognizes the failure within seconds or minutes and reconfigures its routing tables to use the remaining links, transparently to the hosts.

Classic multihoming is costly, since it requires the use of address space that is accepted by all providers, a public Autonomous System (AS) number, and a dynamic routing protocol. Since multihomed address space cannot be aggregated, it causes growth of the global routing table.

=== Multihoming with multiple addresses ===

In this approach, the network is connected to multiple providers, and assigned multiple address ranges, one for each provider. Hosts are assigned multiple addresses, one for each provider.

Multihoming with multiple addresses is cheaper than classic multihoming, and can be used without any cooperation from the providers (e.g. in a home network) but requires additional technology in order to perform routing:
* for incoming traffic, hosts must be associated with multiple A or AAAA DNS records so that they are reachable through all providers;
* for outgoing traffic, a technique such as source-specific routing must be used to route packets through the correct provider, and reasonable source address selection policies must be implemented by hosts.

== Caveats ==
When multihoming is used to improve reliability, care must be taken to eliminate any single point of failure (SPOF):
* Upstream connectivity: A given network operations center must have multiple upstream links to &quot;independent&quot; providers. Furthermore, to lessen the possibility of simultaneous damage to all upstream links, the physical location of each of these upstream links should be physically diverse: far enough apart that a piece of machinery (such as a backhoe) won&#x27;t accidentally sever all connections at the same time.
* Routers: Routers and switches must be positioned such that no single piece of network hardware controls all network access to a given host. In particular, it is not uncommon to see multiple Internet uplinks all converge on a single edge router. In such a configuration, the loss of that single router disconnects the Internet uplink, despite the fact that multiple ISPs are otherwise in use.
* Host connectivity: A &quot;reliable&quot; host must be connected to the network over multiple network interfaces, each connected to a separate router or switch. Alternatively, and preferably, the function of a given host could be duplicated across multiple computers, each of which is connected to a different router or switch.
* Referencing entities: Not only must a host be accessible, but in many cases it must also be &quot;referenced&quot; to be useful. For most servers, this means in particular that the name resolution to that server be functional. For example, if the failure of a single element blocks users from properly resolving the DNS name of that server, then the server is effectively inaccessible, despite its otherwise connected state.

By increasing the number of interfaces and links being used and making routing less deterministic, multihoming complicates network administration.

==IPv4==

Classic multihoming is the dominant technique for IPv4. This requires that a network have its own public IP address range and a public AS number.

While multihoming with multiple addresses has been implemented for IPv4, it is not generally used, as host implementations do not deal well with multiple addresses per interface which requires the use of &quot;virtual interfaces&quot;. It is also possible to implement multihoming for IPv4 using multiple NAT gateways.

==IPv6==

Both classic multihoming and multihoming with multiple addresses may be used in IPv6.

===Classic multihoming===

Provider Independent Address Space (PI) is available in IPv6. This technique has the advantage of working like IPv4, supporting traffic balancing across multiple providers, and maintaining existing TCP and UDP sessions through cut-overs. Critics say that the increased size of routing tables needed to handle multi-homing in this way will overwhelm current router hardware. Proponents say that new hardware will be able to handle the increase due to cheaper memory, which drops in price according to Moore&#x27;s law. Proponents also say this is the only viable solution right now, and the worse is better philosophy supports the idea that it is better to deploy an imperfect solution now than a perfect solution after it is too late.

Because many ISPs filter out route announcements with small prefixes, this will generally require a large &quot;ISP-sized&quot; IP allocation, such as a /32, to ensure global reachability. Using such large prefixes is an inefficient use of IPv6&#x27;s address space; there are only about 4 billion /32 prefixes. However, from a pragmatic perspective, allocating a /32 is equivalent in global address space cost to allocating a single IPv4 address, and this may be acceptable if, as seems to be likely for the foreseeable future, the number of multihomed sites can be numbered only in the millions, as opposed to the many billions of non-multihomed endpoints which are anticipated to comprise the vast majority of IPv6 endpoints. Some regional Internet registries (RIR) such as RIPE have started to allocate /48 from a specific prefix for this purpose. RIPE allocates IPv6 provider-independent address spaces /48 or shorter from 2001:0678::/29.

===Multihoming with multiple addresses===

Multihoming with multiple addresses has been implemented for IPv6. For outgoing traffic, this requires support on the host, either protocol agnostic (Multipath TCP, SCTP, QUIC, etc.) or specific to IPv6 (e.g. SHIM6).

===Other solutions===

* Automated renumbering. If one uplink goes down, all addresses in the network will be renumbered into a new /48 subnet. DNS and firewall records must be updated to redirect traffic to a different /48 subnet. This renumbering will break live TCP and UDP sessions.
* Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP)

<text>Shadow marks (shadow relief) are a form of archaeological feature visible from the air. Unlike cropmarks, frost marks and soil marks, they require upstanding features to work and are, therefore, more commonly seen in the context of extant sites rather than previously undiscovered buried ones.

They are caused by the differences in height on the ground produced by archaeological remains. In the case of ancient, eroded earthworks, these differences are often small and they are most apparent when viewed from the air, when the sun is low in the sky. This causes long shadows to be cast by the higher features, which are illuminated from one side by the sun, with dark shadows marking hollows and depressions.

Artificial shadow marks can be created easily by constructing a virtual model of a site, by merging aerial images (photogrammetry) and then vectoring in a virtual light source from any direction and at any angle.

<text>Charles Strouse (born June 7, 1928) is an American composer and lyricist best known for writing the music to such Broadway musicals as &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, &quot;Applause&quot;, and &quot;Annie&quot;.

==Life and career==
Strouse was born in New York City, to Jewish parents, Ethel (née Newman) and Ira Strouse, who worked in the tobacco business. A graduate of the Eastman School of Music, he studied under Arthur Berger, David Diamond, Aaron Copland and Nadia Boulanger.

Strouse&#x27;s first Broadway musical was &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, with lyrics by Lee Adams, which opened in 1960. Adams became his long-time collaborator. For this show, Strouse won his first Tony Award in the category of best musical.

Strouse&#x27;s next show was &quot;All American&quot; (1962), with a book by Mel Brooks and lyrics by Adams; it was not a success, closing after 80 performances, but it produced the standard “Once Upon a Time” (recorded by Perry Como, Eddie Fisher, Al Martino, Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, and Bobby Darin, among dozens of others).

Following this was &quot;Golden Boy&quot; (1964, also with Adams), starring Sammy Davis Jr., which ran for 568 performances. The musical &quot;It&#x27;s a Bird, It&#x27;s a Plane, It&#x27;s Superman&quot; (1966, based on the popular comic strip) closed after 129 performances, but introduced the song &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Possibilities&quot; sung by Linda Lavin. Its theme would also be adopted by Washington, D.C. television station WTOP (now WUSA) for news broadcasts.

In 1970, &quot;Applause&quot; (starring Lauren Bacall, with book by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and lyrics by Adams) won Strouse his second Tony Award, for Best Musical. In 1977, Strouse adapted another comic strip for the stage, creating the hit &quot;Annie&quot;, which included the song &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; which quickly became a &quot;monstrous song hit,&quot; and garnered him his third Tony Award and two Grammy Awards.

Other Strouse musicals include &quot;Charlie and Algernon&quot; (1979), &quot;Dance a Little Closer&quot; (1983, with lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner, which closed after one performance), &quot;Rags&quot; (1986; which closed after four performances and 18 previews), &quot;Nick &amp; Nora&quot; (1993, which closed after 9 performances), and &quot;An American Tragedy&quot; (1995, with lyrics by David Shaber, performed at Muhlenberg College).

Strouse also wrote musical revues, many with Adams, and his songs were included in revues. The revues included &quot;Shoestring Revue&quot; (with Adams and Michael Stewart) (1955 – Off–Broadway), &quot;Medium Rare&quot; (with Adams) (1960 - Chicago), &quot;By Strouse&quot; (1978 – Off–Broadway at The Ballroom), &quot;Upstairs At O&#x27;Neals&quot; (1982 – Nightclub Revue), &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Dancin&quot; (1994 – Marymount Theatre), and &quot;A Lot Of Living!&quot; (1996 – conceived and directed by Barbara Siman at Rainbow and Stars).

Strouse wrote the music and lyrics for the animated special &quot;Lyle, Lyle Crocodile&quot; which aired on HBO in 1987. His film scores include &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967), &quot;There Was a Crooked Man...&quot; (1970, with Henry Fonda and Kirk Douglas), the Norman Lear production of &quot;The Night They Raided Minsky&#x27;s&quot; (1968, with Adams) and the popular animated movie &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot; (1989). He and Adams also wrote the theme song “Those Were the Days” for the Norman Lear television show &quot;All in the Family&quot;. Strouse&#x27;s songs have been heard on the radio throughout his career and have run the gamut from girl-band pop to hip hop. In 1958, his song “Born Too Late” was number seven on the Billboard charts, and in 1999 the quadruple platinum &quot;Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)&quot; by artist Jay-Z (which sampled &quot;It&#x27;s The Hard Knock Life&quot; from &quot;Annie&quot;) was the winner of a Grammy for Best Rap Album of the year &amp; the Billboard R&amp;B Album of the Year.

Strouse&#x27;s writing also extends into orchestral works, chamber music, piano concertos and opera. His &quot;Concerto America&quot;, composed in 2002 to commemorate 9/11 and the spirit of New York City, premiered at The Boston Pops in 2002, and his opera &quot;Nightingale&quot; (1982), starring Sarah Brightman, had a successful run in London, followed by many subsequent productions. In 1977, Strouse founded the ASCAP Musical Theatre Workshop in New York, through which many young composers and lyricists have found a forum for their work.

A musical stage adaptation of the Paddy Chayefsky film &quot;Marty&quot; starring John C. Reilly premiered at Boston&#x27;s Huntington Theatre in October 2002, with lyrics by Lee Adams and Strouse and the book by Rupert Holmes. &quot;Real Men&quot;, for which Strouse wrote the music and lyrics, premiered in January 2005 at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami, Florida, and his musical &quot;Studio&quot;, premiered at Theatre Building Chicago in August 2006. The musical &quot;Minsky&#x27;s&quot;, with music by Strouse, book by Bob Martin, and lyrics by Susan Birkenhead (loosely based on the movie &quot;The Night They Raided Minsky&#x27;s&quot;) premiered in January 2009 at the Ahmanson Theater.

Strouse won Emmy Awards for music in television adaptions of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; and &quot;Annie&quot;. He is also the recipient of the 1999 ASCAP Foundation Richard Rodgers Award and the Oscar Hammerstein Award. He is a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame (in 2001) and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Strouse was married to director-choreographer Barbara Siman until her death on February 16, 2023. They had 4 children: Benjamin, Nicholas, Victoria and William.

Strouse received an Emperor Has No Clothes Award at the Freedom From Religion Foundation&#x27;s 34th annual national convention on October 8, 2011. The award is &quot;reserved for public figures who make known their dissent from religion&quot;.

<doc id="641248" wikidata="Q608839" url="?curid=641248" title="Barry Trotz">
<text>Barry Trotz (born July 15, 1962) is a Canadian ice hockey executive, former player and coach. He is the general manager for the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League (NHL). Prior to that he served as an advisor to General Manager David Poile. He is the former head coach of the Nashville Predators, Washington Capitals and New York Islanders. Trotz is known for his defensive-minded coaching style and is currently ranked third all-time in NHL coaching wins, behind only Scotty Bowman and Joel Quenneville. He is often referred to by fans and players as &quot;Trotzy&quot;.

He was previously the coach of the American Hockey League (AHL)&#x27;s Baltimore Skipjacks and Portland Pirates, with whom he won an AHL championship in 1994. That same year, he won the Louis A.R. Pieri Memorial Award, which is awarded to the outstanding coach in the AHL as voted upon by the AHL Broadcasters and Writers. On February 20, 2013, Lindy Ruff was fired by the Buffalo Sabres, making Trotz the longest-tenured head coach in the NHL. He was also the second-longest tenured coach in the four major North American professional leagues, behind only Gregg Popovich of the National Basketball Association&#x27;s San Antonio Spurs. On April 14, 2014, the Predators announced Trotz would not return for his 16th season as head coach. On May 26, 2014, Trotz was announced as the new head coach of the Capitals. On June 7, 2018, Trotz won his first Stanley Cup as the head coach, with the Capitals defeating the Vegas Golden Knights in five games, for the franchise&#x27;s first Stanley Cup championship. On June 21, 2018, Trotz was announced as the new head coach of the Islanders. The Islanders let him go at the end of the 2021–22 season, when the team missed the playoffs.

==Coaching career==

===Early years===
Before becoming a coach, Trotz played as a defenceman for the Western Hockey League (WHL)&#x27;s Regina Pats from 1979 to 1982, winning the WHL Championship in 1980. During that time, Trotz played in 191 games, scoring 15 goals, adding 60 assists and accumulating 324 penalty minutes. Trotz played his final year of junior hockey in his home town of Dauphin, Manitoba, where the Kings won the Manitoba Junior Hockey League title as well as the Anavet Cup.

Trotz said he realized his playing was not good enough for an NHL career, and started having doubts about his future. He wound up getting a spot attending training camp for the American Hockey League (AHL)&#x27;s Hershey Bears in 1982 thanks to Jack Button, director of player recruitment at the Bears&#x27; NHL parent club, the Washington Capitals. Button said to Trotz he was invited because Button believed Trotz &quot;might be a good minor league leader or a coach someday&quot;. Trotz began his coaching career as an assistant coach at the University of Manitoba in 1984. The following season, he became the general manager and head coach for the Dauphin Kings. In 1987, he returned to the University of Manitoba as head coach, while also serving as a part-time scout for the Washington Capitals.

Trotz became the head coach for the Capitals&#x27; minor league affiliate, the Baltimore Skipjacks, in 1992. On March 26, 1993, the franchise moved to Portland, Maine, and was renamed the Portland Pirates. Trotz led the Pirates to two Calder Cup Finals, winning the Calder Cup in the Pirates&#x27; inaugural season of 1994.

===Nashville Predators (1998–2014)===

When longtime Capitals general manager David Poile was hired by the newly established Nashville Predators, he decided to bring Trotz along to become the team&#x27;s first head coach. He was named the head coach of the Predators on August 6, 1997. Even before the team began play, Trotz was involved in the Predators expansion process, doing player scouting and helping design the team facilities at the Nashville Arena.

In the debut of both Trotz and the Predators at the 1998–99 NHL season, the team won 28 games, the third highest for an expansion team to date. He holds the record for most games coached by the first coach of an NHL expansion franchise, previously held by Terry Crisp for the Tampa Bay Lightning. Coincidentally, Crisp now works as a radio and TV broadcaster for the Predators. In a November 4, 2008, game against the Vancouver Canucks, Trotz became just the tenth head coach in NHL history to coach 750 games with a single team, and the 31st to reach that mark overall.

The 2006–07 season was Trotz&#x27;s most successful season, leading the Predators to the second-most points in the Western Conference and third overall at 110. However, they trailed their division rival the Detroit Red Wings, therefore denying them the first division championship in club history. The Predators would fare no better in the playoffs, losing 4–1 to the San Jose Sharks in the opening round just as they did the year before. Trotz finished fourth in the Jack Adams Award voting at season&#x27;s end, but was voted by his peers &quot;Sporting News&quot; NHL Coach of the Year. He is well respected around the NHL for keeping his team focused. He led the Predators to four consecutive playoff appearances from 2003 to 2008, and reached the playoffs again in 2009–10. Shortly after being eliminated by the Chicago Blackhawks in six games, on April 28, 2010, Trotz was named a finalist for the Jack Adams Award for NHL coach of the year alongside Joe Sacco of the Colorado Avalanche and Dave Tippett of the Phoenix Coyotes.

Trotz earned his 500th win with a 4–1 win over the Detroit Red Wings on March 30, 2012.

On April 14, 2014, the Predators announced Trotz would not return for his 16th season as head coach. The Predators hired Peter Laviolette as Trotz&#x27;s replacement on May 6, 2014. Trotz&#x27;s 1,196 regular season games coached puts him 14th on the all-time coaching list, and his tenure with the Predators was the longest unbroken coaching stretch in league history.

===Washington Capitals (2014–2018)===
Despite the Predators inviting Trotz to work in their hockey operations department, he wanted to keep coaching. Eventually the Washington Capitals, the same team that gave Trotz his first opportunities in professional hockey, hired him on May 26, 2014.

On February 28, 2017, Trotz recorded his 700th win with a 4–1 victory over the New York Rangers, and became the sixth NHL coach to reach 700 wins.

In the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Capitals trailed in each of their playoff series matchups, which started by losing the first two games of the First Round to Columbus before Washington won the next four, including a victory in Columbus for the deciding game. They faced the defending champion Pittsburgh Penguins in the Semifinals and reached a 2–2 series tie with one win and one loss at home and on the road, before seizing the upper hand with a critical 6–3 victory at home for Game 5 and finally finishing them off 2–1 in overtime at Pittsburgh in Game 6 on a goal by Evgeny Kuznetsov to advance to the Conference Finals. It was both their first Conference Finals appearance since 1998 and the first time Trotz had advanced past the second round as a coach. The Capitals faced the Tampa Bay Lightning and won the first two games before three straight losses (two at home) had Washington face elimination. They then won Game 6 and Game 7 with shutout performances (including winning Game 7 in Tampa) to overcome a 3–2 series deficit for the first time in franchise history after a Game 5 loss and reach the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1998. In the Stanley Cup Finals, they met the Vegas Golden Knights, an expansion team that won 51 games. The Capitals lost Game 1 6–4 in Vegas but rebounded with the efforts of Braden Holtby in preserving a late 3–2 lead to win Game 2. Trotz and the Capitals rolled to routs in Game 3 and 4 to set up a potential clinching Game 5 (hosted in Las Vegas), the first in Capitals history. On June 7, the Capitals won a tight Game 5 by a score of 4–3, with the final goal scored by Lars Eller, to clinch the Stanley Cup for the Capitals, with this being the first title for Trotz as head coach after 19 seasons, the longest such wait in NHL history. On June 18, 2018, Trotz resigned from the Capitals as their head coach due to a contract dispute.

===New York Islanders (2018–2022)===
On June 21, 2018, the New York Islanders hired Trotz as head coach. On March 5, 2019, Trotz earned his 800th career win when the Islanders defeated the Ottawa Senators 5–4 after a shootout In the Stanley Cup playoffs, the Islanders swept the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round and then were swept by the Carolina Hurricanes in the second round. On June 19, 2019, Trotz won the Jack Adams Award for a second time.

On August 20, 2020, the Islanders defeated Trotz&#x27;s former team, the Washington Capitals, who he previously coached to a Stanley Cup championship in 2018, 4–1 in the first round of the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs.

After a win over the New York Rangers on February 8, 2021, Trotz earned his 850th career win as NHL head coach and passed Ken Hitchcock for third place on the all-time coach wins list.

On May 9, 2022, Trotz was relieved from his duties as the Islanders head coach as the Islanders missed the playoffs for the first time since 2018.

===International===
Trotz was assistant coach for Canada at the IIHF World Championships three times: 2002, 2003 (when they won the gold medal) and 2009.

==Executive career==
It was announced that Trotz would replace David Poile as general manager of the Nashville Predators on July 1, 2023.

==Personal life==
Trotz resides in Nashville, Tennessee, with his wife and one of their four children. The family previously resided in Brentwood, Tennessee; Clarendon, Virginia; and Garden City, New York.
An active member of the Nashville community, Trotz won the Community Spirit Award in 2005 for various charitable works, including donating $500 to My Friends&#x27; House (a United Way agency) for each Nashville victory through several seasons; serving as an active board member for the Williamson County YMCA and the United Way; working closely with Best Buddies of Tennessee, a nonprofit organization dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment and leadership development for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

Trotz was named to the Portland Pirates Hall of Fame in 2005, and to the University of Manitoba Hall of Fame in 2001.

Trotz is of Ukrainian descent.

<text>Agyia () is a neighborhood of the city of Patras, Greece. It is located about 3.5 km north of downtown Patras. The community forms the mid-northern part of the city of Patras (except 1 km north of Old GR-9 by-pass). Most of the street names are named after rivers. The town includes the church of St. Constantine (&quot;Aghios Konstantinos&quot;).

==History==

The community used to be a village, but Patras&#x27;s expansion engulfed it during the 1970s and the 1980s. A highway bypass (2.5 km) was built in 1995, which reduced traffic.

The section of north Patras is divided into Meso (Inner) Agyias and Exo (Outer) Agyias. Its nearest subdivision (excluding Patras) are Skioessa. Agricultural lands lie to the north and urban sprawl in central and southern areas. 

The main street is Leoforos Panepistimiou (University Avenue), which leads to the University Town outside Patras (near Rio). Other streets include Afstralias, Agiou Konstantinou or Agyia, Aretha, and Notara. The EOK campground is northwest of the center on Iroon Polytechneiou Street. 

The &quot;Achaiki&quot; confection factory was located at the corner of Notara and Panepistimiou; it produced loukoumia (Turkish delight), vanilla sweets, and koufeta (Jordan almonds). The business was established in 1925 by Vassilios Manoussos (1900–1985) and was continued by his son, Konstantinos (1929–1997). Within the grounds of the old factory and by the Agyia creek, is a large maple tree, over 300 years old, a local landmark. About 500 metres north of the maple tree, an ancient Roman bridge (excavated in 1984) was discovered. It is said that Saint Paul and Saint Andrews (the city of Patra&#x27;s patron saint) both walked on this bridge.

==Sporting teams==

There are two football clubs, Agyia AU and Panionios Achilleas Agyia both playing in the fourth division of the EPS Achaia. Kostas Davourlis Stadium of Panachaiki is located also in the area.

<text>Dagenham Dock is a National Rail station in the Dagenham Dock neighbourhood of Dagenham in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, east London. The station is on the Tilbury loop of the London, Tilbury and Southend line, located down the line from London Fenchurch Street between to the west and to the east. The station was opened in 1908 by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway. The station serves a primarily industrial area adjacent to the River Thames, including the Ford Dagenham site, that is now going through redevelopment as a commercial and residential district.
Its three-letter station code is DDK and it is in London fare zone 5. The station and all trains serving it are currently operated by c2c. It is an interchange with the East London Transit bus service.

==History==
===Early years (1908–1922)===
The railway through Dagenham Dock was opened on 14 April 1854 as part of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&amp;SR) main line to Tilbury. The railway was separated from the River Thames by Dagenham Marshes and in the 1860s and 1870s there were attempts to establish a dock there.

These came to nothing and 30 acres of land was bought by Samuel Williams and Co. In 1887. They drained the marshes and established a deep water jetty on the river as well as a link to the LT&amp;SR east of Chequers Lane level crossing. An early station was built 200 yards east of Chequers Lane but this appears never to have opened although trains apparently stopped for local fisherman. The company built further jetties along the river and built a rail connected industrial estate.

The station was opened on 1 July 1908 by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway and was built on land owned by Samuel Williams and Co (SW&amp;CO) who, as there were few houses in the area that time, wanted a station to bring workers to the industries establishing themselves on their site.

The station had two platforms and the station buildings were on the up side, and were built by (SW&amp;CO) to an LT&amp;SR specification. The station was located west of Chequer Lane Level Crossing and a signal box was provided to the east on the down side. This controlled the small goods yard and entrance to the exchange sidings used by SW&amp;CO.

Just over four years later in 1912 the Midland Railway bought the LT&amp;SR on 7 August 1912 so Dagenham Dock became a Midland Railway station.

Sometime after the war a private wagon works operated by Wagon Repairers Limited was opened south and east of the station which had access to the up sidings.

===London Midland and Scottish Railway (1923–1948)===
Following the Railways Act 1921 the station became the responsibility of the London Midland and Scottish (LMS) Railway from 1 January 1923. 

Larger 3-Cylindered 2-6-4Ts designed by William Stanier were introduced in 1934 and seen on passenger services. During World War II many of the 3-cylindered 2-6-4Ts were transferred away from the area and haulage reverted to older LT&amp;SR locomotives, but the 3-cylindered tanks were back before the end of 1945.

Motor manufacturer Ford bought a 244-acre site off SW&amp;CO in 1924 and in 1931 opened the Dagenham Car Plant.

With a growing number of non-rail connected factories opening in the 1930s the LMS extended the goods yard and it was moved eastwards. Ford took over the old goods yard and car loading ramps were built there. Both of these facilities had been set back from the main line to allow for quadrupling.

Just after World War II started in September 1939, the passenger service was reduced as a wartime economy measure.Wartime production at Fords included large numbers of vans and trucks, along with Bren gun carriers and numerous &#x27;special purpose&#x27; engines. Agricultural vehicles were also an important element. At one point, the Fordson represented 95% of UK tractor production.

During World War II there were two major incidents at Dagenham Dock. On Saturday October 12 1940 bombs fell on the line and services were restored on 16 October. On 17 April 1941 a landmine exploded in the sidings damaging 30 wagons.

===British Railways (1948–1994)===
Following nationalisation of Britain&#x27;s railways in 1948, the station transferred under British Railways to the London Midland Region. On 20 February 1949, the whole LTS line was transferred to the Eastern Region, yet despite the organisational changes, the old LTSR still was a distinctive system operated by former LTS and LMS locomotives until electrification.

During the late 1950s the LTS was being electrified and re-signalled and a full electric timetable started operating in June 1962 which was primarily worked by Class 302 EMUs.

At this time passenger numbers declined as car ownership rose as workers preferred driving to the local factories.Local BR public goods services ended in 1964.

SW&amp;CO went into liquidation in 1980 and their sidings closed.

The LTS line and Dagenham Dock station became part of the London and South Eastern sector of British Rail in 1982, and in June 1986 this was rebranded as Network South East (NSE). With the Conservative government of the early 1990s looking to privatise the railways, the operation of the NSE passenger train service was put under the control of a Train Operating Unit.

===The privatisation era (1994–present day)===
====Franchises====
On privatisation in 1994, infrastructure ownership passed to Railtrack and Prism Rail took over operations of the franchise, marketing the route as LTS Rail. Prism Rail were bought out by National Express in 2000 and in 2002 the line was rebranded as c2c.

Ownership of the infrastructure passed to Network Rail in 2002. 

National Express sold the operation of the franchise to Trenitalia in 2017.

The station and all trains serving it are currently operated by c2c and are operated by Class 357 and Class 720/6 EMUs.

A more detailed history of the franchises can be found on the c2c page.

====Infrastructure change 1994–Current day====
The signal box was closed in August 1996 when the signalling was taken over by Upminster Signalling Control Centre.

In 1998 a new viaduct crossing over the station site was opened carrying the A13 road (England) to the south of the railway line.

The building of High Speed 1 (HS1) saw a number of changes to the area with the platforms being realigned north. The lines passed behind the up platform and two years later Chequers Lane Level Crossing was closed. The eastern connection into Fords was closed and now three lines south of the HS1 alignment are used for entrance to the Fords factory and a Hansons Aggregate terminal. West of the station on the up side there are two sidings serving Dagenham Cold Store and then the up and down split to go around the Ripple Lane site. Much altered over the years this still has a freightliner terminal and Eurohub.

East of the station the former 1901 goods yard is now an aggregates terminal and Dagenham Down Sidings is now a headshunt for that facility.

==Design==
The station consists of two side platforms with a small entrance building to the northern (down) platform. Within the station a footbridge connects the platforms. An accessible footbridge with stairs and lifts outside the station connects the northern entrance building with the East London Transit terminal to the south. The external footbridge also provides step-free lift access with the southern (up) platform.

High Speed 1 and some freight tracks run parallel, however these are not directly accessible from the platforms. The elevated A13 road runs above the eastern ends of the platform.

==Location==
The station is located on Chequers Lane in the Dagenham Dock neighbourhood. London Buses route 145 serves the northern side of the station, while route EL2 operates from the East London Transit terminal to the south of the station. 

==Operations==
===Services===
As of the June 2024 timetable the typical Monday to Friday off-peak service is:
* 2 trains per hour westbound to London Fenchurch Street 
* 2 trains per hour eastbound to 

===Ripple Lane===
The LMS already had built a yard on this site in 1937 because Plaistow was at capacity and there was a need to serve local industries. The down side had eight sidings and a run round loop whilst the up sidings had seven sidings and a run round loop. The main line at this stage ran through the site. 

The new marshalling yard was approved by the British Transport Commission act of 1951. 

The main line was then split to go around the sides of the new facility to cut out crossing moves at both ends. The yard fully opened on 6 March 1961 and included:.
* Eight reception sidings (controlled by Ripple Lane Signal Box
* The Yard hump – wagons were pushed over the hump by a shunting locomotive and the wagons directed from an adjacent Control Tower into the siding group. Retarders would slow wagons down.
* The fan – sets of sidings leading to the Marshalling Sidings
* 54 double ended marshalling Sidings divided into 8 lettered groups of sidings
* The 54 sidings joined two lines and then fanned out into six lines – This end controlled by Ripple Lane Yard Signal Box.
* The east end entry and exit to the main line and Dagenham Dock station. 

Within the yard area Ripple Lane TMD was opened by British Rail in November 1959 and closed in 1993. There was also a Carriage and Wagon repair shop.

The hump was abolished and the yard reduced in size in 1968 with a number of marshalling sidings removed partly because more trains were operating as block trains so did not need to call and a general national contraction in freight. On the up side a new Freightliner terminal was built 

Situated to the immediate west of the station, the Ripple Lane inter-modal freight depot was originally developed to supply parts from across Europe to the Ford Dagenham plant. Today it has become a base for various continental freight services.

During 2005 to 2009 part of the yard was used by High Speed 1 construction trains as that line ran past Ripple Lane.

In 2009 Stobart Rail commenced a new, weekly refrigerated train service, operated in conjunction with DB Schenker. The from Valencia in Spain terminates at Ripple Lane, providing for an alternative to lorries for the import of fresh Spanish produce. The first fully refrigerated goods service to run through the Channel Tunnel, it is then the longest train journey in Europe run by a single operator. On the return journey to Spain, the train carried pallets for CHEP but this ceased running in 2024.

===Private Sidings and Networks===
====Samuel Williams and Co====

The company operated a fleet of steam and diesel engines up to the end of operations in 1972 when the company went into liquidation. Operations changed over the years with coastal coal being a major part of the business in the early years and oil storage in the latter years. They had several rail served jetties, one of which is still extant as a listed structure.

Access to the LT&amp;S was via sidings east of the station on the up side and later they sold land to Ford in 1922 they shared these sidings and the access to their site was realigned.

One of their locomotives, a Manning Wardle 0-6-0ST No. 4 Sharpthorn has been preserved at the Bluebell Railway.

====Fords====
In 1931 Fords had three diesel engines based on shunters employed in their USA New Jersey Plant. These 150hp Bo-Bo were built by British Thompson Houston and these worked over the London, Tilbury and Southend Line to sidings on the downside of the line for which they had LMS approval. They also worked internal trains within the plant moving hot metal and slag ladles. The three locomotives lasted until the 1960s and number 1 has been preserved at the Kent and East Sussex Railway since 1966 and is the oldest diesel-electric locomotive in the UK.

From 1933 Fords bought Peckett 0-6-0ST tank engines to do the bulk of the shunting in the plant. These were replaced by three British Rail Class 04s and a Class 03 that had been made redundant by the contraction of freight on the national network in the early 1970s.

These were replaced by other industrial diesels as they became life expired although two of them have survived into preservation.

Ford Dagenham which now produces engines only is still connected to the rail network.

==Redevelopment==
Although the station is relatively poorly served and located in an industrial area, there are plans to redevelop the area as London Riverside. Under these plans the station has become the southern terminus of phase one of the East London Transit and it was proposed that an eastern extension of the Docklands Light Railway would terminate here. 

In October 2021, planning permission was given by Barking and Dagenham Council to Inland Homes for 380 new homes and a new public square to the north of the station.

In November 2022, Peabody was given planning permission for the first 935 of 3,500 homes in the Dagenham Green development on part of the former Ford Dagenham site to the northeast of the station.

A consolidated Dagenham Dock wholesale market was proposed for the southeast of the station on the former Barking Reach Power Station site, to become operational in 2027/2028. However, in November 2024, the Court of Common Council announced it did not intend to proceed with these plans as they were no longer economically viable.

Beam Park railway station is planned to be constructed as a new station to the east of Dagenham Dock.

<doc id="641254" wikidata="Q744611" url="?curid=641254" title="Battle of Heraclea">
<text>The Battle of Heraclea took place in 280 BC between the Romans under the command of consul Publius Valerius Laevinus, and the combined forces of Greeks from Epirus, Tarentum, Thurii, Metapontum, and Heraclea under the command of Pyrrhus, king of Epirus. Although the battle was a victory for the Greeks, they incurred severe losses.

==Background==
Tarentum was a Greek colony, part of Magna Graecia. The members of the leading faction in Tarentum, the democrats under Philocharis or Ainesias, were against Rome, because they knew that if the Romans entered Tarentum the Greeks would lose their independence. The Greeks in Tarentum had grown afraid of Roman expansion after the Third Samnite War. After the surrender of the Samnites in 290 BC, the Romans founded many colonies in Apulia and Lucania, the most important of which was Venusia. In 282 BC, after a battle against the Samnites, Lucanians, Bruttians and Thurii, Roman troops entered the Italian Greek colonies of Croton, Lokroi, and Rhegium. Democrats from Tarentum knew that as soon as Rome finished its war with the Gauls, Lucanians, Etruscans, Samnites, and Bruttians, they would enter Tarentum. Another event that concerned the Tarentines was that the aristocratic faction of Thurii that had taken power had invited a Roman garrison into their city; the Tarentines, who had been the referents of all the Magna Graecia colonies, were deeply worried about this fact.

The second faction in Tarentum were the aristocrats, led by Agis, who did not oppose surrendering to Rome, as it would lead to the return of the aristocratic faction to power. The aristocrats, however, could not surrender directly and become unpopular with the population. In the autumn of 282 BC, Tarentum celebrated their festival of Dionysus; while in their theatre in front of sea, they saw ten Roman ships, with soldiers and supplies for the Roman garrison of Thurii, entering the Gulf of Taranto. According to Kęciek, the Tarentine aristocracy asked the Roman commanders Publius Cornelius and Lucius Valerius to arrest and execute the democrats and their followers, which would allow the aristocrats to surrender. The Tarentines were angry, because the Romans had signed an agreement not to sail into the Gulf of Taranto, and they prepared their navy to attack the Roman ships. A few of the ships were sunk, and one was captured.

The Tarentines knew that they had few chances of victory against Rome. They decided to call for help from Pyrrhus, King of Epirus. The army and fleet of Tarentum moved to Thurii and helped the democrats there exile the aristocrats. The Roman garrison placed in Thurii withdrew.

The Romans sent a diplomatic mission to settle the matter and take back the prisoners but the negotiations ended abruptly, so Rome declared war on Tarentum. In 281 BC, Roman legions under the command of Lucius Aemilius Barbula entered Tarentum and plundered it. Tarentum, with Samnite and Salentine reinforcements, then lost a battle against the Romans. After the battle the Greeks chose Agis to sign a truce and begin diplomatic talks. These talks were also broken off when 3,000 soldiers from Epirus under the command of Milon entered the town. The Roman consul withdrew and suffered losses from attacks by the Greek ships.

Pyrrhus decided to help Tarentum because he was in debt to them — they had earlier helped him conquer the island of Corcyra. He also believed that he could count on help from the Samnites, Lucanians, Etruscans, Umbrians, and Bruttians, and some Illyrian tribes, all peoples with a history of conflict with Rome. His ultimate goal was to re-conquer Macedon he had lost in 285 BC, but did not have enough money to recruit soldiers. He planned to help Tarentum, then go to Sicily and attack Carthage. After winning a war against Carthage and capturing south Italy he would have enough money to organise a strong army and capture Macedon.

==Preparation==

Before he left Epirus, Pyrrhus formed an alliance and borrowed soldiers and money from the pretender to the Macedonian throne, Ptolemy Keraunos. His long-time friend and ally Ptolemy II Philadelphus, king of Ptolemaic Egypt, also promised to send 9,000 soldiers and 50 war elephants. He also recruited cavalry from Thessaly and archers and slingers from Rhodes — as their rulers wanted to avoid a war with Epirus. In the spring of 280 BC Pyrrhus landed without losses in Italy.

After hearing of Pyrrhus&#x27; arrival in Italy the Romans mobilized eight legions with auxiliaries, totalling about 80,000 soldiers. They divided it into four armies:
* One army under the command of Barbula, with orders to distract the Samnites and Lucanians so they could not join Pyrrhus&#x27; army. They were placed in Venusia.
* A second army left behind to secure Rome.
* A third army under the command of consul Tiberius Coruncanius marched against Etruscans, to avoid an alliance between them and Pyrrhus.
* A fourth army under the command of Publius Valerius Laevinus marched to Tarentum. They also plundered Lucania.

Publius Laevinus moved towards Heraclea, a city founded by the Tarentines, with the intention of cutting Pyrrhus off from the Greek colonies of Calabria, thus avoiding their uprising against Rome.

==Battle==

Pyrrhus did not march against the Romans while he was waiting for his allies&#x27; reinforcements. When he understood that reinforcements were not coming, he decided to fight the Romans on a plain near the river Siris (modern Sinni), between Pandosia and Heraclea. Pyrrhus took up position there and waited. Before the fight he sent diplomats to the Roman consul, proposing that he could arbitrate the conflicts between Rome and the population of southern Italy. He asserted that his allies recognised him as a judge and demanded the same recognition from the Romans. The Romans denied his request, and entered the plain on the right of the Siris river, where they set up camp.

It is unknown how many troops Pyrrhus had left in Tarentum, it is estimated he had about 25–35,000 troops with him at Heraclea. He took up position on the left bank of the Siris, hoping that the Romans would have difficulty crossing the river, which would allow him more time to prepare his attack. He set up some light infantry units near the river to let him know when the Romans began to cross, and planned first to attack them with his cavalry and elephants. Valerius Laevinus had about 42,000 soldiers under his command, including cavalry, velites, and spearmen. It would be the first time in history that two very different juggernauts of war clashed: the Roman Legion and the Macedonian Phalanx.

At dawn, the Romans started to cross the river Siris. On the flanks the Roman cavalry attacked the scouts and light infantry, who were forced to flee.

When Pyrrhus learned that the Romans had begun crossing the river, he led his Macedonian and Thessalian cavalry to attack the Roman cavalry. His infantry, with peltasts and archers and heavy infantry, began their march as well. The Epirote cavalry successfully disrupted the Roman battle formation and then withdrew. Pyrrhus&#x27; peltasts, slingers, and archers began to shoot and his sarissa-wielding phalanxes began to attack. The infantry line was near equal to the Romans&#x27; in length as, although Pyrrhus had a small advantage in number, the phalanx was by design deeper than the legion.

The phalanxes made seven attacks, but failed to pierce the legion. It had met a foe that was stronger than any it had ever encountered. The Romans made seven attacks, yet they could not break the phalanx, and the battle hung in the air. At one point, the battle became so pitched that Pyrrhus—realizing that if he were to fall in combat, his soldiers would lose heart and run—switched armor with one of his bodyguards. This bodyguard was subsequently killed, and word spread through the ranks that Pyrrhus had fallen. His force began to waver, and the Romans gave a thunderous cheer at the turn of events. Grasping the magnitude of the situation, Pyrrhus rode forward, bare-headed, along the lines of his men to show he was still living. This show of bravery strengthened their resolve. A massive cheer went up from the Greek line, and the battle raged on.

Unable to make any significant gains in action, Pyrrhus deployed his war elephants, held in reserve until now. The Roman cavalry was threatening his flank too strongly. Aghast at the sight of these strange and brooding creatures which none had seen before, the horses galloped away and threw the Roman legion into rout. (The Romans subsequently called elephants , after the location of this first encounter.). Pyrrhus then launched his Thessalian cavalry among the disorganized legions, which completed the Romans&#x27; defeat. The Romans fell back across the river and Pyrrhus held the field.

In the opinion of Dionysius, the Romans lost 15,000 soldiers and had thousands taken prisoner; Hieronymus states 7,000. Dionysius totalled Pyrrhus&#x27; losses at around 11,000 soldiers, 3,000 according to Hieronymus. Either way, this could be considered the earliest of his Pyrrhic victories against Rome.

==Aftermath==

After the battle, reinforcements from south Italy joined Pyrrhus. The Greeks of Rhegium who wanted to join him were massacred by Roman soldiers under the command of Decius Vibelius, who was proclaimed ruler of the town. Pyrrhus then began to march towards Rome. He captured many small towns in Campania, and his forces plundered Latium. His march was stopped in Anagni, two days from Rome, when he met the other Roman consular army under Tiberius Coruncanius. Pyrrhus was afraid that he did not have enough soldiers to fight, and knew Laevinus and Barbula were probably marching behind him. Instead he withdrew and the Romans did not follow him.

<doc id="641257" wikidata="Q973355" url="?curid=641257" title="Cromwell, New Zealand">
<text>Cromwell () is a town in the Central Otago region of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, located on the shore of Lake Dunstan. Established at the confluence of the Clutha / Mata-Au and Kawarau Rivers after gold was discovered nearby during the Otago Gold Rush of the 1860s, Cromwell&#x27;s location saw it become a junction for travel between Dunedin and areas further inland, such as Wānaka and Queenstown. As gold mining declined, the town developed to service farms and orchards in the surrounding area, becoming known for stone fruit and as part of the Central Otago wine region. The town remains a hub for people travelling throughout the region, with State Highway 8B running through the town and acting as a main route for travellers to Queenstown. 

The construction of the Clyde Dam and subsequent creation of Lake Dunstan during the 1980s and 1990s saw Cromwell expand as a town, while also requiring the relocation of a third of town&#x27;s buildings from areas that would be flooded, including the town centre. Remnants of the old town centre above the lake&#x27;s water line have been retained and now form a historic precint near the lake shore. Recent years have seen further development in Cromwell and the surrounding areas, including the construction of the Highlands Motorsport Park to the west in 2013 and the Lake Dunstan Trail to the south in 2021. 

==Etymology==

Māori refer to the area as &quot;Tirau&quot;, referring to their plantings of cabbage trees to stand as navigation markers and also as food for travellers.

European (Pākehā) goldiggers called it as &quot;The Junction&quot;, &quot;The Point&quot;, or &quot;Kawarau Junction&quot;, as it is at the confluence of the Clutha River / Mata-Au and the Kawarau River. 

The town was named Cromwell in the middle of 1863 by J. A. Connell of the Dunedin firm Connell and Moodie, who was from Northern Ireland. Because of &quot;a silly rivalry between a Northern Irish surveyor and Southern Irish miners&quot; in the district he decided &quot;to put the curse of Cromwell on them&quot;.

== Geography ==
Cromwell is between (linking to Wānaka, north, and Queenstown via the Kawarau Gorge, west) and State Highway 8 leading to the Lindis Pass, northeast, and Alexandra, 33 km south. The road to Alexandra winds through the Cromwell Gorge. A point near Cromwell lies 119 kilometres from the sea, the farthest from the sea anywhere in New Zealand.
A prominent feature surrounding much of the town is the man-made Lake Dunstan.

Cromwell is surrounded by the Pisa mountain range to the north (including Mount Pisa, 1963 metres) the Dunstan Mountains to the northeast (including Mount Dunstan, 1667 metres) Mount Difficulty (1285 metres) to the west and the Old Woman Range and Cairnmuir mountains to the south.

Nearby settlements are at Bannockburn, Lowburn, Tarras, and Ripponvale.

Cromwell has a strategic location between the Lindis and the Haast passes, and acts as a hub between the towns of Wānaka, Queenstown and Alexandra.

Cromwell is also the home of the Cromwell Chafer Beetle &quot;(Prodontria lewisi)&quot;.

The 45th parallel south runs just north of the township.

Cromwell lay at the confluence of the Clutha River and the Kawarau River, which was noted for the difference between the colours of the waters of the two rivers and also for the historic bridge at the convergence of the two. Since the construction of the Clyde Dam and the filling of Lake Dunstan in the early 1990s the river confluence was drowned, as was the old town centre.

=== Climate ===

Cromwell receives around 400 mm of rain a year due to its inland location. Although it is widely believed to have a continental climate, the town officially has an oceanic climate (Cfb) with rainfall just enough to escape the semi-arid climate (Bsk) classification.

== History ==
The first Pākehā to visit was Nathanael Chalmers in 1853, guided there by and . He was stricken by dysentery, so his guides returned him down the Clutha, shooting the rapids in a reed boat.

Official explorations of the northern and western parts of Central Otago began in the late 1850s, but detailed surveys did not commence until 1861.

In 1862, gold was discovered below the Junction by two miners, Horatio Hartley and Christopher Reilly. Once the word of a gold strike was out, there was an influx of several thousand miners to the area as well as supporting nine hotels in Cromwell.

Cromwell was declared a municipality in 1866. The government funded the construction of a bridge across the Clutha in 1866 (which cost 28,000 pounds). This was rebuilt in 1891. Bishop Selwyn visited in 1866. Cromwell&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Cromwell Argus&quot;, was established in 1869. The Cromwell council chambers were completed in 1869 and the Cromwell district hospital was established in 1875 with wards to provide beds for ten inpatients.

The population was 424 people in 1878 and increased to 429 people in 1881. Gold mining by individuals was replaced by dredging by companies in the 1890s. but was short lived. The population decreased with smaller scale mining activities continuing until the 1930s. The Cromwell railway station, connecting Cromwell to Dunedin was opened in July 1921. It burnt down in 1942 and was subsequently rebuilt. it was closed in 1976 with the railway line from Clyde to Cromwell being closed in 1980.

Soldiers from Cromwell served in World War I with 13 losing their lives. A cenotaph was unveiled on 25 April 1923 to recognise their sacrifice. A further 11 soldiers from Cromwell died during World War II. A memorial hall was built in the 1950s which is dedicated to those fallen in the two World Wars.

As gold ran out, Cromwell became the service centre for an extensive farming and stone fruit growing area. An irrigation scheme was built in the 1920s diverting water from the Kawarau river to irrigate a large area of land near Ripponvale.

The stone fruit industry is commemorated with the giant sculpture of stone fruit which stands outside the northern end of the town. It was built by the Cromwell Rotary Club in 1990 with the design coming from Otto Muller. The sculpture is regularly repainted.

The decision to build Clyde Dam and use Cromwell as the accommodation base brought many changes to the town. In the early stages, a government information centre in Cromwell was set on fire in a late-night attack.

Approximately one-third of the town was rebuilt on higher ground. A total of 60 homes and 50 commercial properties were affected. The changes included the doubling of the residential area, relocation of the old town centre (now called &quot;Old Cromwell Town&quot;), upgrading of services, the provision of modern educational and sports facilities, and the construction of the new Deadman&#x27;s Point Bridge. The town centre was relocated between 1984 and 1985 to a new site known as &quot;The Mall,&quot; that now houses the main retail, service and civic buildings in Cromwell. Several of the old buildings of the town which escaped the flooding have been retained as a historic precinct close to the shore of the Kawarau.

The lake started to fill in autumn of 1992 with 2000 hectares including farmland and 17 orchards also being flooded by Lake Dunstan.

Cromwell&#x27;s array of fruit orchards has led to it being nicknamed the &quot;fruit bowl of the south&quot;.

<text>Yelizaveta Nikolaevna Kedrova (Russian: Елизавета Николаевна Кедрова; 9 October 1909 – 16 February 2000), known as Lila Kedrova, was a Russian actress of the screen and stage. She won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; in 1964, and the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for the same role in the musical stage version of the film in 1984.

==Life and career==
Yelizaveta Nikolayevna Kedrova was born in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, the youngest of three children. Her parents were Russian opera singers. Her father, Nikolay Kedrov Sr. (1871–1940), was a singer and composer, a creator of the first Russian male quartet to perform liturgical chants. Her mother, Sofia Gladkaya (ru: Софья Николаевна Гладкая; 1874–1965), was a singer at the Mariinsky Theatre and a teacher at the Conservatoire de Paris. Her brother, Nikolay Kedrov Jr. (died 1981), was a Russian singer and composer of liturgical music. Her sister, Irene Kedroff (Irina Nikolayevna Kedrova; died 1989), was a soprano.

In 1922, several years after the October Revolution, the family emigrated to Berlin. In 1928, they moved to France, where Kedrova&#x27;s mother taught at the Conservatoire de Paris, and her father again recreated Quatuor Kedroff. In 1932, Kedrova joined the Moscow Art Theatre touring company. Then her film career began, mostly in French films, until her first English-language film appearance as Madame Hortense in &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; (1964). Her performance won her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Kedrova then appeared in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; (1966), playing the role of Countess Kuchinska, a Polish noblewoman in East Berlin who is desperate to emigrate to the United States. Kedrova played Fräulein Schneider in the West End stage production of &quot;Cabaret&quot; in 1968. She then played a series of eccentric and crazy women in Hollywood films. In 1983, she reprised her role as Madame Hortense on Broadway in the musical stage version of &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot;, winning both a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical and a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical in the process. In 1989, she played Madame Armfeldt in the London revival of &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;.

Her second husband was Canadian stage director Richard Howard (1932–2017).

==Death==
In 2000, Kedrova died at her summer home in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, of pneumonia, having suffered a long time with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. She was cremated. Her ashes are buried in her family grave in the Russian cemetery in Paris.

<text>Harry Rubenstein (January 27, 1895 – February 23, 1974), known professionally as Harry Ruby, was an American pianist, composer, songwriter and screenwriter, who was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970. He was married to silent film actress Eileen Percy.

==Biography==

Ruby was born in New York City in 1895. After failing at his early ambition to become a professional baseball player, he toured the vaudeville circuit as a pianist with the Bootblack Trio and the Messenger Boys Trio.

In his early career worked as a pianist and song plugger for the Gus Edwards and Harry Von Tilzer publishing firms (one of his co-workers at Edwards&#x27; place was the young Walter Winchell, who was also a song plugger). Ruby also played in vaudeville acts, nickelodeons and cafes throughout New York.

From 1917-1920, Ruby collaborated with songwriters Edgar Leslie, Sam Lewis, Joe Young and George Jessel on the hit songs “What’ll We Do Saturday Night When the Town Goes Dry”, “When Those Sweet Hawaiian Babies Roll Their Eyes”, “Come on Papa”, “Daddy Long Legs” and “And He’d Say Oo-La-La Wee Wee.”

Ruby found his most sustained success as a composer after meeting the man who would become his longtime partner, lyricist Bert Kalmar. Kalmar and Ruby were a successful songwriting team for nearly three decades until Kalmar&#x27;s death in 1947, a partnership portrayed in the 1950 MGM musical &quot;Three Little Words&quot;, starring Fred Astaire as Kalmar and Red Skelton as Ruby.

A good friend of Groucho Marx, Ruby appeared several times on his television program, &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;. In his 1972 concert at Carnegie Hall, Marx gave the following introduction before performing a song of Ruby&#x27;s: &quot;I have a friend in Hollywood ... I think I do, I&#x27;m not so sure. [laughter] His name is Harry Ruby [applause] and he wrote a lot of songs that I&#x27;ve sung over the years ...&quot;
: Today, Father, is Father&#x27;s Day
: And we&#x27;re giving you a tie
: It&#x27;s not much we know
: It is just our way of showing you
: We think you&#x27;re a regular guy
: You say that it was nice of us to bother
: But it really was a pleasure to fuss
: For according to our mother
: You&#x27;re our father
: And that&#x27;s good enough for us
: Yes, that&#x27;s good enough for us

In &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, recorded June 13, 1969, Marx also sang a second stanza, and introduced it with, &quot;Isn&#x27;t that a beautiful melody? And a beautiful sentiment: ... Today, father, is father&#x27;s day. ... 16 men in that orchestra: nine of them are illegitimate children [laughter]. Nine and a half including the director.&quot;

: The tie that you got
: Didn&#x27;t cost such a lot
: And we&#x27;ll give you the same tie next year.
: You tell us it was nice of us to bother
: But it really was a pleasure to fuss
: For they say, a child can only have one father
: And you are the one for us.
: And you are the one for us.

<text>Hanmer Springs is a small town in the Canterbury region of the South Island of New Zealand, known for its hot pools. The Māori name for Hanmer Springs is Te Whakatakanga o te Ngārahu o te ahi a Tamatea, which means &quot;where the ashes of Tamatea&#x27;s fire lay&quot;, referring to Tamatea, the captain of the canoe Tākitimu.

Hanmer Springs is located north-west of Christchurch and south-west of Kaikōura ( by road), in the Hurunui District. The town lies on a minor road north of State Highway 7, the northern route between Christchurch and the West Coast via Lewis Pass. The township lies at the base of Conical Hill. Mount Isobel () looks over Hanmer Springs. Jacks Pass and Jollies Pass provide access to the Molesworth and Rainbow roads.

== Toponymy ==
The town is named after Thomas Hanmer, an owner of Hawkeswood Station near the Conway River during the 1850s. Thomas Hanmer was born in Hanmer, Wales. He arrived to Lyttelton Harbour in 1852. While searching for suitable farming land, he joined a party of surveyors working in the Amuri District. During this period he was linked with Hanmer Springs, although he never lived there. He was the manager of the St Leonards Station near Culverden from 1855 to 1857. He then moved to Queensland, Australia. There is a statue of Thomas Hanmer in the centre of Hanmer Springs.

==History==
The locality was discovered for its hot springs by William Jones in early 1859. Access to the general area was provided by a bridge over the Waiau Uwha River in 1864 constructed by a Mr Handisides of Nelson for NZ£2,000 to a design by John Blackett. The bridge lasted only ten years before it was blown over by a Nor&#x27;west wind.

John Turnbull Thomson surveyed the land for the township in 1879, with the total area comprising , of which were for the township itself. The hot springs were not included within that area. The springs themselves were still in their natural state at that time, with only steps and a changing shed provided. The member for , Edward George Wright, brought up the question of developing the township in the New Zealand House of Representatives in June 1882. The Minister of Lands, William Rolleston, replied that it was important that the public should retain access to the springs. Surveyor Walter Kitson was instructed with laying out the site of the hot springs including an accommodation house. Construction of a bath house began in January 1884. The fifty year jubilee was held in 1933, stating that Hanmer had been a government resort since 1883, but the centenary book pointed out that the jubilee was held a year too early. The government investing significant funds into Hanmer Springs without a bridge crossing the Waiau Uwha River caused considerable controversy. Blackett designed a new bridge and John Anderson from Christchurch won the contract to erect it, and built a foundry at the site. This second bridge opened in 1887 and gives access to Hanmer to this day, with the structure registered as a Category I heritage item since 1983. The opening celebrations held by Anderson&#x27;s sons at the site were rather liberal to the extent that the site is still known as Champagne Flat.

==Hot pools==

In 1960 the local community purchased the hot pools and gifted them to the local council. The three hexagonal pools which are still in use currently and a fresh water pool were built in 1978. Changing rooms and a new entrance way were constructed in 1985. The rock pools were built in 1992 and further sulphur pools constructed in 1999.

In 2009, a 4600 square metre extension to the hot pools complex was proposed including &quot;a second [16m high] water-slide, ice-skating rink and relocating and reconfiguring the freshwater pool.&quot; During the consent process oppositions were made to it by, among others, the Queen Mary Reserve Trust concerning the expansions effect on noise levels and visual impact. Concerns were also raised by former hospital superintendent, Dr Robert Crawford, about the change the development might have on the village&#x27;s brand of &quot;slow tourism and relaxation, not wet’n’wild.&quot;

After a hearing from independent Commissioner Robert Batty, on Monday, 18 January 2010 the proposal was approved. &quot;The freshwater pool, new buildings, water slide and super bowl and the aqua play and ice skating area are all to be on land from the subdivision of Queen Mary Hospital land.&quot; Development had continued since then and Hanmer Springs currently has 22 pools and four water slides with the most recent: The Conical Thrill being opened in November 2019. The Hot Pools were further extended in November 2020 with a new area for younger children to play on including a new waterslide. The Hanmer Springs Hot Pools also was the winner in the Luxury Hot Springs category at the 2020 World Luxury Spa Awards. At peak times, the hot pools can play host to 5000 people each day.

The New Zealand Government announced that it is investing more than $2 million to build a family-friendly twisting 850-metre long flying fox in Hanmer Springs. The ride is expected take nine minutes to complete and construction is expected to be finished by September 2021 The flying fox is expected to create 25 new jobs and provide $4 million revenue over the first five years. In May 2021, the resource consent application was suspended as planning showed that the ride would have to be modified due to the undulating hill side. Local residents objected to it in September 2021 saying that it &quot;will ruin everything that is special about Conical Hill&quot;.

== Hanmer Springs Forest ==

In order to provide timber for the Christchurch market, reserve land was set aside between 1900 and 1901. The planting of exotic trees began in 1902, and in 1903 prison labour was used. The prisoners who took part in the planting resided at a nearby prison camp which operated until 1913. A variety of trees were planted including black pines, Norway spruce and deciduous larch, with alders in wet areas, and oaks and silver birches planted as amenity species. The oldest area of the forest (203 hectares) is protected under a Crown covenant. Many woody species have invaded this forest from the township’s gardens. In 1964 pupils of Hanmer Primary School planted a block of &quot;pinus nigra&quot; in order to commemorate Arbor day. A number of walking trails now go through this mature forest.

In 2000, the Government sold the North Canterbury Crown Forests to Ngai Tahu as part of a Treaty of Waitangi settlement. Thus the Hanmer Springs Forests passed into private ownership. In 2008 a memorandum of understanding was signed by Matariki Forests, Hanmer Heritage Trust and the Hurunui District Council that protected the ongoing right for public access to the Hanmer Springs Forest. The Hurunui District Council would now be responsible for the maintenance of the tracks within the forest.

In 2018 an art trail of animal sculptures made from a redwood tree by Christchurch sculptor Andrew Lyons was opened.

Work is starting in 2020 to extend the St James trail to Hanmer Springs.

There is an extensive network of mountain bike trails ranging from easy to expert runs in the forests surrounding Hanmer Springs. Alligator Alley, Upper Dog Stream, Detox and the Tank Track are particularly popular. The network of trails has been extended in 2020 with the addition of the Southern Cross and Tombstone trails. The four kilometre long Tombstone trail includes 185 m of climbing to the highest point and a twisty 240 m descent. The mountainbike trails have been described as &quot;world class&quot;.

The Jacks Pass – Clarence River – Jollies Pass Loop is a loop which is not technically challenging; however, it takes between two and four hours to complete. It can be ridden in either direction: West over Jacks Pass (869 m) or East over Jollies Pass (850 m). As the entire ride is at high elevation (700 m above sea level) it is subject to extreme and sudden changes in the weather which have caught riders out who were not prepared.

Hanmer Springs is the starting point (or end point) for both the Molesworth Muster cycle trail and the Rainbow Trail. These are also part of Nga Haerenga The New Zealand Cycle Trail.

<text>Project Prometheus (also known as Project Promethian) was established in 2003 by NASA to develop nuclear-powered systems for long-duration space missions. This was NASA&#x27;s first serious foray into nuclear spacecraft propulsion since the cancellation of the SNTP project in 1995. The project was planned to design, develop, and fly multiple deep space missions to the outer planets.

The project was cancelled in 2005, due to other demands on NASA&#x27;s budget. Its budget shrank from $252.6 million in 2005 to only $100 million in 2006, $90 million of which was for closeout costs on cancelled contracts.

==Namesake==
Originally named the &quot;Nuclear Systems Initiative&quot;, Project Prometheus was named for the wisest of the Titans in Greek mythology who gave the gift of fire to humanity. NASA said the name &quot;Prometheus&quot; indicates its hopes of establishing a new tool for understanding nature and expanding capabilities for the exploration of the Solar System.

==Motivations==
Due to their distance from the Sun, spacecraft exploring the outer planets are severely limited in that they cannot use solar power as a source of electrical energy for onboard instrumentation or for ion propulsion systems. Previous missions to the outer planets such as Voyager and Galileo probe have relied on radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) as their primary power source. Unlike RTGs which rely on heat produced by the natural decay of radioactive isotopes, Project Prometheus called for the use of a small nuclear reactor as the primary power source.

The primary advantages of this would have been:
*Increased power generation compared to RTGs, allowing scientists and engineers more flexibility in both mission design and operations. 
*Increased spacecraft longevity.
*Increased range and propulsion power.
*Extra power for high speed data transmission.

==Missions==

Missions planned to involve Prometheus Nuclear Systems and Technology included:
*Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter
*Exploration of the Jovian moons Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Originally planned to be the first mission of Project Prometheus, it was deemed too complex and expensive, and its funding was cut in the 2006 budget. NASA instead considered a demonstration mission to a target closer to Earth to test out the reactor and heat rejection systems, possibly with a spacecraft scaled down from its original size.

==Technology==
Project Prometheus was focused on Nuclear electric propulsion:

Development of spacecraft powered by nuclear reactors to generate electricity. Brayton cycle turboalternators were selected for power generation. This electricity would then be used to run ion engines. It did not study nor pursue nuclear thermal propulsion (e.g. NERVA).

NASA&#x27;s Prometheus reactor was to be built by the U.S. Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of Naval Reactors in Washington, D.C., per an agreement signed in August 2004. The reactor would have generated 200,000 watts of power for the propulsion and instruments of a spacecraft. 

==Collaboration==
The project was managed by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Spacecraft design contracts were awarded to Boeing, Lockheed-Martin, and Northrop Grumman.

Project Prometheus would have had substantial involvement of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). 

Naval Reactors, which oversees the nuclear reactor program of the U.S. Navy, was to participate in the design and construction of the reactors for the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO).

In addition to Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory in Schenectady, New York, Bettis Laboratory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and other supporting Department of Energy national laboratories participated in the Prometheus cooperation.

In September 2004, JPL chose Northrop Grumman Space Technology to co-design the projected Prometheus spacecraft. The awarded contract was worth around $400 million.

<doc id="641265" wikidata="Q1761007" url="?curid=641265" title="Songkhla Lake">
<text>Songkhla Lake (, , ) is the largest natural lake in Thailand. It is on the Malay Peninsula in the southern part of the country. Covering an area of 1,040 km2 it borders the provinces of Songkhla and Phatthalung. Despite being called a lake, it is actually a lagoon complex.

The lake is divided into three distinct parts. The southern part opens with a 380 m wide strait to the Gulf of Thailand at the city of Songkhla. Here it contains brackish water about half the salinity of seawater. Further north, after a narrowing to 6 km width, is the &quot;Thale Luang&quot; (782.80 km2). At the northern end between mangrove swamps is the 28 km2 &quot;Thale Noi&quot; in Phatthalung Province. The most striking feature is the long 75 km long spit which separates the lake from the sea. Unlike most spits, it was probably formed when originally existing islands were connected by silting from the lake precursor.

==Ramsar wetlands==
The Phru Khuan Khi Sian wetlands near the Thale Noi Lake have been protected as a Ramsar wetland since 1998. It is part of the larger Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area, created in 1975.

Kuan Ki Sian of the Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area is at 07º50’N 100º08’E in a non-hunting area, Phatthalung. Just north of the very large Thale Luang (Lake Songkhla complex) in the south of the country, it is one of the few surviving intact freshwater wetland ecosystems in Thailand. Among the specific wetland types found here are lake, marsh, Melaleuca (also termed &quot;paperbark&quot;) swamp forest, paddy fields, and swamp grasslands.

&quot;Kuans&quot; are islands free of water for most of the year in the Melaleuca swamp forest. Kuan Ki Sian is a knoll at 0–2 meters above mean sea level in the Thale Noi area. The Thale Noi area is home to more than 5,000 families, almost all of whom rely on resource extraction or other land use within the area. Activities include fishing, cattle grazing, cultivation, mat-making and tourism. The site is visited by more than 200,000 visitors annually.

==Irrawaddy dolphin==
A small population of Irrawaddy dolphins is found in Thale Luang, near the Si-Ha Islands of Phatthalung. They are threatened with extinction by overfishing and pollution. The IUCN Red List shows several populations, including those in the Mahakam River and Malampaya Sound, as critically endangered. As of March 2024, it is thought there are 14 individuals in the lake.

<text>The House of Eltz is a noted German noble family, belonging to the &quot;Uradel&quot;. The Rhenish dynasty has had close ties to the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia since 1736.

==History==
Though older sources mentioned one Eberhard zu Eltz, a Frankish citizen of Trier in the late 7th century, the otherwise first recorded instance of the name occurred in 1157, when Rudolph zu Eltz was mentioned as witness to the donation of a property deed by Emperor Fredrick Barbarossa. At that time, Eltz lived in a small manor on the banks of the River Elz, a tributary of the Moselle, in what is now the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The family members had been ministeriales and loyal supporters of the Imperial Hohenstaufen dynasty. 

In the early 14th century they inherited the &quot;Vogtei&quot; over Rübenach near Koblenz, a possession of Imperial Abbey of St Maximin at Trier. Eltz Castle was built in the early 12th century on a site that held a 9th-century manor house with a simple earthwork palisade. Before 1268 three brothers shared the ownership of the castle and it was kept jointly by their descendants, the Kempenich, Rodendorf and Rübenach branches until 1815 when it was taken over by the Kempenich branch, which still owns it today.

From 1331 until 1336 the Eltz were stuck in a fierce feud with mighty Baldwin of Luxembourg, then Elector and Prince-Archbishop of Trier enforcing his acknowledgement as their suzerain, whereafter the Eltz family remained vassals of the Trier archbishops. In 1324 Pope John XXII had appointed Canon Arnold von Eltz Prince-Bishop of Cammin in Pomerania against the resistance of King Louis IV. Robin von Eltz served as Master of the Livonian Order from 1385 until 1389. Canon Jakob zu Eltz was elected Prince-Archbishop of Trier in 1567; he was one of the strongest champions of the Counter-Reformation and allied himself with the Jesuits in opposing Lutheran and Calvinist influence in the region.

In 1624, Hans Jakob zu Eltz was given the hereditary office of Field Marshal for the Electorate of Trier. This made him the supreme military commander of the region in time of war, including leader of the vassals on this important region of the Holy Roman Empire. 

The Eltz family, Imperial Knights since 1729, reached their greatest influence with Philipp Karl von Eltz-Kempenich, from 1732 Prince Elector and Archbishop of Mainz and German Archchancellor, making him the most noble and one of the most powerful Catholic princes north of the Alps. As a result of their service throughout the troubles of the Reformation and during the wars against the Ottoman Empire, the elder line of Eltz were awarded the title of &quot;Reichsgrafen&quot; (Counts of the Empire) by the Habsburg Emperor Charles VI in 1733 in Vienna. 

The additional &quot;Great Palatinate&quot; privilege entitled the Eltz lords to knight others in the name of the Emperor, select notaries public, illegitimate children, confer coats of arms and crests, appoint judges and clerks, and release serfs from service.

In 1736 Archbishop Philipp Karl von Eltz had acquired the Lordship of Vukovar in eastern Slavonia (present-day Croatia) affiliated with the Hungarian nobility. From 1749 onwards his heirs had Eltz Manor erected, the main residence of the Grafen von und zu Eltz until the family was expelled by the Yugoslav communist regime in 1945. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, Jakob Eltz returned to Croatia and as a naturalized citizen became a member of the new &quot;Sabor&quot; parliament, where he represented Vukovar.

<doc id="641270" wikidata="Q4656154" url="?curid=641270" title="A Course of Pure Mathematics">
<text>A Course of Pure Mathematics is a classic textbook in introductory mathematical analysis, written by G. H. Hardy. It is recommended for people studying calculus. First published in 1908, it went through ten editions (up to 1952) and several reprints. It is now out of copyright in UK and is downloadable from various internet web sites. It remains one of the most popular books on pure mathematics.

==Contents==
The book contains a large number of descriptive and study materials together with a number of difficult problems with regards to number theory analysis. The book is organized into the following chapters.

* I. REAL VARIABLES
* II. FUNCTIONS OF REAL VARIABLES
* III. COMPLEX NUMBERS
* IV. LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A POSITIVE INTEGRAL VARIABLE
* V. LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE. CONTINUOUS AND DISCONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS
* VI. DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS
* VII. ADDITIONAL THEOREMS IN THE DIFFERENTIAL AND INTEGRAL CALCULUS
* VIII. THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES AND INFINITE INTEGRALS
* IX. THE LOGARITHMIC, EXPONENTIAL AND CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS OF A REAL VARIABLE
* X. THE GENERAL THEORY OF THE LOGARITHMIC, EXPONENTIAL AND CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS

==Review==
The book was intended to help reform mathematics teaching in the UK, and more specifically in the University of Cambridge and in schools preparing to study higher mathematics. It was aimed directly at &quot;scholarship level&quot; students – the top 10% to 20% by ability. Hardy himself did not originally find a passion for mathematics, only seeing it as a way to beat other students, which he did decisively, and gain scholarships.

<doc id="641274" wikidata="Q513532" url="?curid=641274" title="Raw foodism">
<text>Raw foodism, also known as rawism or a raw food diet, is the dietary practice of eating only or mostly food that is uncooked and unprocessed. Depending on the philosophy, or type of lifestyle and results desired, raw food diets may include a selection of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, eggs, fish, meat, and dairy products. The diet may also include simply processed foods, such as various types of sprouted seeds, cheese, and fermented foods such as yogurts, kefir, kombucha, or sauerkraut, but generally not foods that have been pasteurized, homogenized, or produced with the use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, solvents, and food additives.

The British Dietetic Association has described raw foodism as a fad diet. Raw food diets, specifically raw veganism, may diminish intake of essential minerals and nutrients, such as vitamin B12. Claims made by raw food proponents are pseudoscientific.

==Varieties==

Raw food diets are diets composed entirely or mostly of food that is uncooked or that is cooked at low temperatures.

===Raw animal food diets===

Raw animal food diets include any animal that can be eaten raw, such as uncooked, unprocessed raw muscle meats, organ meats, eggs, raw dairy, and aged, raw animal foods such as century eggs, fermented meat/fish/shellfish/kefir, as well as vegetables, fruits, nuts, and sprouts, but in general &quot;not&quot; raw grains, raw beans, and raw soy. Raw foods included in such diets have not been heated above . &quot;Raw Animal Foodists&quot; believe that foods cooked above this temperature have lost much of their nutritional value and are harmful to the body. Smoked meats are frowned upon by many Raw-Omnivores. Some distinguish between hot-smoked and cold-smoked.

====Diet examples====
*The &quot;People&#x27;s Primal Potluck&quot;, anopsology (otherwise known as &quot;instinctive eating&quot;), and the &quot;Raw Paleolithic Diet&quot; (otherwise known as the &quot;raw meat diet&quot;).
*The &quot;primal diet&quot; consists of fatty meats, organ meats, dairy, honey, minimal fruit and vegetable juices, and coconut products, all raw.
*The &quot;raw Paleolithic diet&quot;, is a raw version of the (cooked) Palaeolithic diet, incorporating large amounts of raw animal foods such as meats/organ-meats, seafood, eggs, and some raw plant-foods, but usually avoiding non-Paleo foods such as raw dairy, grains, and legumes.

The founder of the Primal Diet is Aajonus Vonderplanitz, a resident of Malibu, California. It has been estimated by Aajonus Vonderplanitz that there are 20,000 followers of his raw-meat-heavy Primal Diet in North America, alone.

*Aboriginal diets consisted of large quantities of raw meats, organ meats, and berries, including the traditional diet of the Nenets tribe of Siberia, and the Inuit.
*Pemmican is the traditional North American travel food, prepared from dried meat, fat, and berries.

===Raw veganism===
Raw veganism has rarely been practised in history, but it became a fad in the 21st century. A raw vegan diet consists of unprocessed, raw plant foods that have not been heated above . Typical foods included in raw food diets are fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and sprouted grains and legumes.

Among raw vegans are subgroups, such as &quot;fruitarians&quot;, &quot;juicearians&quot;, or &quot;sproutarians&quot;. Fruitarians eat primarily or exclusively fruits, berries, seeds, and nuts. Juicearians process their raw plant foods into juice.

The British Dietetic Association named the raw vegan diet one of the &quot;top 5 worst celeb diets to avoid in 2018&quot;, raising a concern that it could compromise long-term health.

==History==
Early documentation of raw food dieting has been associated with hermits and monks practising asceticism. For example, John of Egypt, a hermit from the Nitrian Desert in the 4th Century, reportedly lived on a diet of dried fruit and vegetables for fifty years; he never ate anything cooked. Documented evidence of a commitment to raw food was by the Ethiopian monk Qozmos, who in the late 1300s CE committed to the ascetic discipline of eating only uncooked food. This posed a problem for his Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church monastery because he refused to eat the bread of the Eucharist, which is cooked. As a result, he fled the church and went to live with the Jewish community of the Beta Israel.

Contemporary raw food diets were first developed in Switzerland by Maximilian Bircher-Benner (1867–1939), who was influenced as a young man by the German &quot;Lebensreform&quot; movement, which saw civilization as corrupt and sought to go &quot;back to nature&quot;; it embraced holistic medicine, nudism, free love, regular exercise and other outdoors activity, and foods that it judged were more &quot;natural&quot;. Bircher-Benner eventually adopted a vegetarian diet, but took that further and decided that raw food was what humans were really meant to eat; he was influenced by Charles Darwin&#x27;s ideas that humans were just another kind of animal and Bircher-Benner noted that other animals do not cook their food. In 1904 he opened a sanatorium in the mountains outside of Zurich called &quot;Lebendinge Kraft&quot; or &quot;Vital Force&quot;, a technical term in the Lebensreform movement that referred especially to sunlight; he and others believed that this energy was more &quot;concentrated&quot; in plants than in meat, and was diminished by cooking. Patients in the clinic were fed raw foods, including muesli, which was created there. These ideas were influential to Ann Wigmore, a notable raw food advocate, but were dismissed by scientists and the medical profession as quackery.

One of the earliest books to advocate raw foodism was Eugene Christian&#x27;s &quot;Uncooked Foods and How to Use Them&quot;, 1904. Other proponents from the early part of the twentieth century include Californian fruit grower Otto Carque (author of &quot;The Foundation of All Reform&quot;, 1904), George Julius Drews (author of &quot;Unfired Food and Trophotherapy&quot;, 1912), Bernarr Macfadden and Herbert Shelton. Drews influenced John and Vera Richter to open America&#x27;s first raw food restaurant &quot;The Eutropheon&quot; in 1917.

Shelton was arrested, jailed, and fined numerous times for practising medicine without a license during his career as an advocate of rawism and other alternative health and diet philosophies. Shelton&#x27;s legacy, as popularized by books like &quot;Fit for Life&quot; by Harvey and Marilyn Diamond, has been deemed &quot;pseudonutrition&quot; by the National Council Against Health Fraud.

In the 1970s, Norman W. Walker (inventor of the Norwalk Juicing Press) popularized raw food dieting. Leslie Kenton&#x27;s book &quot;Raw Energy – Eat Your Way to Radiant Health&quot;, published in 1984, added popularity to foods such as sprouts, seeds, and fresh vegetable juices. The book advocates a diet of 75% raw food, which it claims will prevent degenerative diseases, slow the effects of aging, provide enhanced energy, and boost emotional balance; it cites examples such as the sprouted-seed-enriched diets of the long-lived Hunza people and Gerson therapy, an unhealthy, dangerous and potentially very harmful raw juice-based diet and detoxification regime claimed to treat cancer.

In the 21st century, raw food diets (particularly those focused on raw milk, raw eggs, and raw meat) have been popularized and politicized as part of a broader &quot;right-wing bodybuilder&quot; movement centered around hypermasculinity, physical fitness, fascination with ancient civilizations and opposition to feminism and mainstream modern culture.

==Claims==
Claims held by raw food proponents include:
* That heating food above degrades enzymes in raw food that aid digestion. Enzymes in food play no significant role in the digestive process, before being digested themselves.
* That raw foods have higher nutrient values than foods that have been cooked. In fact, cooking has widely variable results on nutritional content, depending on the plant source and cooking method, and may increase the availability of fat-based nutrients, such as vitamin E and beta-carotene.
* That foods cooked at high temperatures, especially meat, may contain harmful toxins, including trans fatty acids produced by heating oil, acrylamide produced by frying, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Not all cooked food contains harmful chemicals, and a diet containing a mix of cooked and raw food is normal. According to the American Cancer Society, it is not clear whether acrylamide consumption affects the risk of cancer. Public health authorities recommend reducing consumption of overly-cooked starchy foods or meats.

==Health effects==
A raw food diet may impair the development of children and infants. Careful planning is essential for a raw vegan diet, particularly for children, as there may not be enough vitamin B12, vitamin D, and calories for a growing child on a totally raw vegan diet.

Food poisoning is a health risk for anyone consuming raw foods, and the increased demand for raw foods is associated with greater incidence of foodborne illness, especially for raw meat, fish, and shellfish. Outbreaks of gastroenteritis among consumers of raw and undercooked animal products (including smoked, pickled or dried animal products) are well-documented, and include raw meat, raw organ meat, raw fish (whether ocean-going or freshwater), shellfish, raw milk and products made from raw milk, and raw eggs.

One review stated that &quot;Many raw foods are toxic and only become safe after they have been cooked. Some raw foods contain substances that affect the absorption of nutrients, interfere with digestive enzymes, or damage the walls of the intestine. Additionally, raw meat can be contaminated with bacteria which would be destroyed by cooking; raw fish can contain substances that interfere with vitamin B1 (anti-thiaminases)&quot;.

<text>Minor leagues are professional sports leagues which are not regarded as the premier leagues in those sports. Minor league teams tend to play in smaller, less elaborate venues, often competing in smaller cities/markets. This term is used in North America with regard to several organizations competing in various sports. They generally have lesser fan bases, much smaller revenues and salaries, and are used to develop players for bigger leagues. Minor leagues are also occasionally used as a testing ground for proposed rule changes prior to implementation at the top level.

The minor league concept is a manifestation of the franchise system used in North American sports, whereby the group of major league teams in each sport is fixed for long periods between expansions or other adjustments, which only take place with the consent of the major league owners. In Europe, and many other parts of the world, association football (soccer), basketball, american football, baseball, handball, hockey, etc. leagues have many divisions below the &quot;top-flight level&quot; as part of the football pyramid. In other parts of the world there is usually either a system of annual promotion and relegation, meaning that clubs have no fixed status in the hierarchy, or there is only one professional league per country in each sport, rendering the major/minor distinction irrelevant.

== American football ==

While there are various semi-professional football leagues, none have any affiliation with the National Football League (NFL). The NFL and its teams have had working relationships with several independent leagues in the past, including the Association of Professional Football Leagues, the Atlantic Coast Football League, and most recently, the league owned-and-operated NFL Europe. In modern times, the NFL has developed players not ready for the active roster through each team&#x27;s practice squad.

Several NFL owners had purchased teams in the Arena Football League in the mid-2000s, prior to its bankruptcy and restructuring. Arena football is played under very different conditions, and the AFL had its own minor league, af2, until 2009. Several other independent indoor football leagues that play a similar game exist.

Similarly, the Canadian Football League, though it has developed ties with the NFL in recent years and has moved away from competing with the NFL for talent, plays a visibly different game than the American game, and the two sports favor different types of skills; the CFL arguably holds major league status in its home territory of Canada.

Several minor or developmental leagues, independent of the NFL, have come and gone. Some, such as the Alliance of American Football and Fall Experimental Football League (along with the FXFL&#x27;s successor, the still extant but non-paying The Spring League), have explicit minor league and developmental aspirations. Others, such as the United Football League and both the 2001 and 2020 incarnations of the XFL, have sought to maintain independence and maintain a national profile while acknowledging the lack of funds (particularly from television, which is by far the NFL&#x27;s largest revenue stream) that would be needed to compete for NFL-caliber talent. The UFL during its existence was recognized and accepted as the second tier of professional football behind the NFL, with several former NFL stars playing in the UFL near the ends of their careers.

Below Major League Soccer several lower-level leagues operate on both sides of the U.S.–Canada border as part of the American and Canadian soccer pyramids. As is standard for sports in both countries, the formal promotion and relegation system is not used, although teams have been informally &quot;promoted&quot; from lower leagues up to Major League Soccer. The United Soccer League operates the USL League Two (formerly the Premier Development League, or PDL), a semi-professional league that has some age restrictions. The National Premier Soccer League operates at approximately the same level as USL League Two. 

In 2013 Major League Soccer announced a partnership with the USL organization which began formal affiliation between some USL teams and MLS teams. The partnership continued to deepen through the 2010s; by the end of that decade, most MLS teams fielded their reserve teams in the USLC, while a few had their reserve sides in USL1 instead of the USLC. For several years, MLS nominally required all of its teams to either field a reserve team in the USL or officially affiliate with a separately owned USL team, but this was never strictly enforced. No formal relationship existed between NASL and the other leagues; NASL&#x27;s commissioner had said he believed it would &quot;stay that way for some time&quot;. However, MLS clubs started withdrawing their reserve sides from the USL system in 2020 amid rumors that MLS would relaunch its former MLS Reserve League in the coming years; these rumors were proved correct by the 2022 establishment of MLS Next Pro. 

MLS Next (stylized in all caps) is a system of youth soccer leagues that are managed, organized and controlled by Major League Soccer. It was introduced by the league in 2020.

Semi-professional and amateur leagues sanctioned by the United States Adult Soccer Association are USL League Two, National Premier Soccer League, NISA Nation and United Premier Soccer League.

The system, introduced in mid-2020, was active for the first time during the 2020–21 season. It is a successor to the U.S. Soccer Development Academy. The system covers the under-13, under-14, under-15, under-16, under-17 and under-19 age groups.

=== Women ===
The developmental pathway for players outside the collegiate system has so far been mostly an ad hoc affair, with semi-professional and amateur leagues including the former USL W-League. The current United Women&#x27;s Soccer, UWS League 2 and Women&#x27;s Premier Soccer League not being sanctioned directly through the United States Soccer Federation, but through the affiliated United States Adult Soccer Association.

The USL organization has announced plans to create a full women&#x27;s developmental pathway, establishing the semi-professional third-level USL W League (USLW; not to be confused with its former W-League) in 2022 and planning to launch the USL Super League (USLS) in 2023. The USL has applied for U.S. Soccer sanctioning of USLS; it has not yet announced its sanctioning plans for USLW.

==Indoor soccer==
The Major Arena Soccer League 2 (M2) is a North American indoor soccer league that serves as the developmental league of the Major Arena Soccer League.

== Baseball ==
Minor league baseball is almost as old as the professional game itself, and at first consisted of attempts to play baseball in smaller cities and towns independent of the National League, the first true major league. Soon, scouts for the National League were traveling to watch minor league teams play and attempting to sign the more talented ones away. Soon Major League Baseball began formal developmental agreements with some minor league teams, while others remained independent. 

Since it was first developed in the 1920s by St. Louis Cardinals executive Branch Rickey, the formal developmental affiliations have come to dominate minor league baseball, and the majority of minor leagues are part of the affiliated system. A general decline in minor league attendance occurred following the advent of television; minor league clubs only survived in many markets because their major league affiliations included financial support. The trend began to reverse in the 1990s, as new independent minor leagues began for the first time in decades and have become successful to varying levels.

In 2021, a major reorganization of the minor leagues saw the number of affiliated teams (i.e., those with formal links to MLB teams) reduced from 160 to 120, the Short-Season A level eliminated from the minor leagues, and all leagues above Rookie level in the affiliated system renamed. Also, four independent leagues were officially designated as &quot;MLB Partner Leagues&quot;. In 2022, the leagues renamed in 2021 reverted to their traditional names.

== Basketball ==
The National Basketball Association has affiliated minor leagues: the NBA G League (formerly called the &quot;NBA D-League&quot;) and NBA Summer League. The now-defunct Continental Basketball Association (CBA) served some of the purposes of a minor league for the NBA for many years. However, there were no direct developmental agreements between CBA and NBA teams the way that there are between Major League Baseball and National Hockey League teams and their minor league affiliates.

== Ice hockey ==
The sport with the next most extensive system of minor league teams other than baseball is ice hockey. In North America, between 1988 and 2005, 233 minor league ice hockey teams played in a total of 160 cities in 13 minor professional leagues. The vast majority of these teams played in the United States, with only 21 of these teams based in Canadian cities. 123 of these minor professional teams played in the southern United States. One reason given for the large number of American-based teams is that minor league franchises will frequently move from city to city, and even between leagues. In contrast, Canadian cities more commonly host major junior teams, which develop teenage prospects prior to their move to the professional leagues.

All National Hockey League teams have a farm team in the American Hockey League and often have a secondary affiliated team in the ECHL. On &quot;the farm&quot;, the NHL team will develop young players, occasionally rehabilitate older players who are injured or whose quality of play has slumped. These teams, in turn, have lower-level minor leagues to draw players from and pass players down to. Minor professional ice hockey leagues should not be confused with Junior (amateur players) or Senior (semi-professional to amateur) ice hockey leagues.

The American Hockey League is the most prominent of the minor hockey leagues in North America.

<doc id="641278" wikidata="Q6864633" url="?curid=641278" title="Ming Chuan University">
<text>Ming Chuan University (MCU; ) is a private university with four campuses in Taipei, Taoyuan and Kinmen in Taiwan, as well as one in Michigan, United States. MCU also has international education centers in Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Thailand. Additionally, it collaborates with universities such as Fuzhou University and Xiamen University of Technology to establish joint college.

MCU was founded by Pao Teh-Ming (包德明) and her husband Lee Ying-Chao. The university was named after the progressive Qing Dynasty governor of Taiwan Liu Mingchuan.

MCU is a member of the Excellent Long-Established University Consortium of Taiwan (ELECT). The consortium includes 13 universities, such as Fu Jen Catholic University, Soochow University, Chung Yuan Christian University, Taipei Medical University, among others.

MCU is the first university in Asia to receive accreditation from the United States of America by the MSCHE (Middle States Commission on Higher Education), and it is also the only university in Taiwan with such accreditation. The university has also obtained accreditation from CHEA (Council for Higher Education Accreditation) and AACSB. 

==History==
Ming Chuan University was founded in 1957 by Dr. Teh-Ming Pao and Dr. Ying-Chao Lee. It was Taiwan&#x27;s first women&#x27;s business school (women&#x27;s college). Dr. Teh-Ming Pao, its first president, had the most significant influence on its development. When the government had just moved to Taiwan and the economy was lagging, with an urgent need to nurture business professionals, Dr. Pao founded the school in the interests of national development, at the same time raising awareness of the talents and rights of women and facilitating their contributions to society. She began preparations in Fall 1956 and on March 25, 1957, the Ministry of Education approved its founding. It began operation the following Fall.

The original plan called for Ming Chuan to be located in Danshui. However, a descendant of Liu Ming-Chuan, Madam Liu, was having difficulty maintaining Ming Chuan Orphanage that she had established on Zhong-Shan North Road. She found Dr. Pao willing to take over Ming Chuan Orphanage, which was later converted into the school of the same name. In five years following its establishment the school was twice moved and rebuilt, finally being relocated to its present site in the Shihlin District in 1962. Dr. Pao borrowed funds so that construction could be completed all at once.

Since MCU began as a commercial college, the original three-year day school consisted of three programs: Banking and Insurance, Accounting and Statistics, and International Trade and Business Administration. In 1960, Secretarial Science was added and Ming Chuan became part of the national junior college joint entrance examination program. The former four departments were formed into an evening program added in 1963. In 1964, the day school added a Commercial Mathematics department and Secretarial Science was added to the evening program. A five-year program for junior high school graduates was established in the same year and grew to an enrollment of 1400. The Ministry of Education of the ROC promoted Ming Chuan to senior college status on July 16, 1990.After more than 30 years of development, Ming Chuan&#x27;s campus on Mount Fu was full to capacity. In 1967, the school purchased gently sloping ground in Guishan Township (now Guishan District) of Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City).
In 1995, at the invitation of the Kinmen County Education Advancement Investigation Team, Ming Chuan established a campus in Kinmen, thus becoming a comprehensive university with three campuses. Success at Kinmen led the Ministry of Education to approve MCU&#x27;s establishment of Matsu Executive Master&#x27;s Programs to promote higher education in Kinmen and Matsu and further Pao&#x27;s dream “to serve the island residents”, recognizing the right of all to an education.

In 2011, the university began holding an annual International Student Paper Competition sponsored by Taiwan ICDF, and finalist papers are published in the Journal of International Cooperation.

With the introduction of ICDF (International Corporation and Development Fund) scholarships, the university has become known for its large international population. Ming Chuan opened its Michigan Campus at Saginaw Valley State University in 2014.

Entrusted by the government, MCU is responsible for managing the Taiwan Scholarship and Huayu Enrichment Scholarship Program. In addition, MCU is responsible for hosting Taiwan&#x27;s international youth exchange program.

MCU signed the Taiwan Huayu BEST Program partnership with Rice University and University of Oklahoma.

== Campus life and traditions ==
Mascot

The university&#x27;s mascot is a whale.

Emblem and flag

The university flag, like the flag of Taiwan, is red, white, and blue. The emblem follows the color of the flag, with an ascending eagle and three curved figures from the bottom to the top.

Plum-blossom examination seating arrangement

First introduced during the women&#x27;s business school period, this system is characterized by uniform examination schedules throughout the entire school.  Exam information is uniformly released by the school and seat assignments are randomized. Each pair of adjacent students takes different subjects in the examination. Any student caught cheating during the exam is subject to expulsion according to regulations.

All pass Candies

This activity is one of the traditions at MCU. Seniors traditionally give a small gift to their juniors before exams, wishing them success in their midterms and finals.

Ming Chuan University F.C.

It was established by Ming Chuan University and serves as the football club for the Taiwan University Football Association, Taiwan Football Premier League, and Taiwan Second Division Football League. The club has achieved both championship and runner-up titles. The club plays their home matches on the Taoyuan campus of MCU.

In 1979, Dr. Teh-Ming Pao established the MCU women&#x27;s football team. It was a core known as the &quot;Mulan&quot; in the ROC women&#x27;s national football team at that time. The team having won three championships in the AFC Women&#x27;s Asian Cup during the 1970s. Influenced by this, the unofficial women&#x27;s football world championship was held in Taiwan in 1981, and it is regarded as a motivating factor for the establishment of the Germany women&#x27;s national football team.

<text>Liberal Protectionist was the name under which three candidates sought election to the House of Commons of Canada for ridings in Quebec in two elections in the early twentieth century.

The Liberal Party of Canada, at the time, was associated with the concept of free trade. Protectionists opposed the concept.

In the 1925 federal election, Léopold Doyon won 2,839 votes, 19.4% of the total, as the only opponent of the Liberal candidate in St. Henri. (Twenty years later he would be a Social Credit candidate in Hochelaga). Former Liberal MP Ruben Charles Laurier running as a Liberal Protectionist won 4,076 votes in St. James riding, 26.9% of the total, as the only opponent of the Liberal candidate.

In the 1930 federal election, Lyon William Jacobs won 2,723 votes, 10.2% of the total, placing third of four candidates in Laurier—Outremont riding.

<doc id="641293" wikidata="Q2759523" url="?curid=641293" title="Green Eggs and Ham">
<text>Green Eggs and Ham is a children&#x27;s book by Dr. Seuss. It was published by the Beginner Books imprint of Random House on August 12, 1960. The book follows Sam-I-am as he follows an unnamed man, repeatedly asking him if he would like to try some green eggs and ham before the man eventually tries it and likes it.

Seuss began writing &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; after his editor Bennett Cerf bet him $50 () that he could not write an engaging children&#x27;s book with a vocabulary of 50 words. Finding the challenge difficult, Seuss used notes, charts, and checklists to keep track of his progress. The book covers themes of conflict between individuals, though Seuss has said that it lacks any deeper meaning.

&quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; was widely praised by critics for its writing and illustration, and the challenge of writing a book in 50 words is regarded as a success. The book has been the subject of multiple adaptations, including a television series of the same name in 2019.

==Plot==

A character named Sam-I-am offers an unnamed man a plate of green eggs and ham, but the man tells him that he hates the food. Sam continues to follow the man, asking him to eat the food in various locations and with various animals for dining partners. Finally, when the man agrees to try the dish Sam-I-am has offered, he realizes that he does, in fact, like green eggs and ham and he thanks Sam-I-am.

== Writing and release ==
&quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; was written by Theodor Seuss Geisel under his pen name Dr. Seuss. He wrote the book after his editor at Random House, Bennett Cerf, bet him $50 () that he could not write an engaging children&#x27;s book using a vocabulary of only 50 distinct words. The bet was a response to Seuss&#x27;s previous success, &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;, which was written using 236 distinct words. Seuss took extensive notes to work out how to best use 50 words, creating different charts and checklists. By the time he finished arranging the words, he had memorized many of the statistics of how he used them.

&quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; only uses 50 words: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;am&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;anywhere&quot;, &quot;are&quot;, &quot;be&quot;, &quot;boat&quot;, &quot;box&quot;, &quot;car&quot;, &quot;could&quot;, &quot;dark&quot;, &quot;do&quot;, &quot;eat&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;fox&quot;, &quot;goat&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;ham&quot;, &quot;here&quot;, &quot;house&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;if&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, &quot;let&quot;, &quot;like&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, &quot;me&quot;, &quot;mouse&quot;, &quot;not&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;rain&quot;, &quot;Sam&quot;, &quot;say&quot;, &quot;see&quot;, &quot;so&quot;, &quot;thank&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;them&quot;, &quot;there&quot;, &quot;they&quot;, &quot;train&quot;, &quot;tree&quot;, &quot;try&quot;, &quot;will&quot;, &quot;with&quot;, &quot;would&quot;, and &quot;you&quot;. Of these words, &quot;not&quot; appears the most frequently, used a total of 82 times. &quot;Anywhere&quot; is the only word in the book to have more than a single syllable.

Seuss found the restriction especially challenging, and he rewrote many pages before he was satisfied with the rhymes. The drafts were typed on rice paper, which Seuss attached to his illustrations. His wife Helen Palmer sometimes placed his discarded drafts back on his desk in the hope that he would approve of them after looking at them a second time, though he rarely did.

Early drafts had the unnamed man speak more aggressively to Sam-I-am. When the two characters were in a car atop the tree, he was originally written as saying, &quot;Sam-I-am. You let me be. Not in a car. You let me be!&quot; Seuss changed this to &quot;I would not, could not in a tree. Not in a car! You let me be&quot;, making the outburst less direct and moving the exclamation point away from the command. In another example, he is written as saying &quot;I do not like you, Sam-I-am&quot;. The drafts also described the subject as &quot;green ham and eggs&quot; instead of the final wording, &quot;green eggs and ham&quot;.

Dr. Seuss finished writing &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; in the early spring of 1960. A reading was scheduled for April 19 in the office of Louise Bonino at Random House. These readings were often attended by the entire staff, but Cerf was out of the office that day, so a dinner party was arranged for the reading. The reading ended with applause, but Seuss remained self-critical and scrutinized pages that he felt did not get the reaction he had hoped. Phyllis Cerf had intended to announce &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; with two other children&#x27;s books, &quot;Are You My Mother?&quot; and &quot;Put Me in the Zoo&quot;, and a publicist was sent to request that reviewers postpone reviews after advance sheets had been distributed early.

&quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; was published on August 12, 1960. At the time, approximately three million Dr. Seuss books had already been sold.

== Analysis and themes ==
Dr. Seuss believed that children&#x27;s books had more power to do good or evil for society than any other medium, and &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; was the first of Seuss&#x27;s Beginner Books to carry a lesson for children. Despite this, Dr. Seuss has said that there is no deeper meaning in the book, insisting that &quot;the only meaning was that Bennett Cerf, my publisher, bet me fifty bucks I couldn&#x27;t write a book using only fifty words&quot;. 

&quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; reverses the traditional structure of an adult trying to convince a child to try new foods. It is one of many Dr. Seuss books about a defiance of norms—in this case, the persistence of Sam-I-am after his offer of green eggs and ham is rejected. It explores the underlying social connection between individuals set in opposition to one another, but it does so in a way that appeals to the interests of children. Both characters refuse to move from their decision throughout the book until the adult finally gives in at the end.

The narrative of &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; is told in a question-and-answer structure. Consistent use of the name &quot;Sam-I-am&quot; instead of simply &quot;Sam&quot; allowed Seuss to maintain meter when rhyming it with the eponymous &quot;green eggs and ham&quot;. The title of &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; is a play on the common phrase ham and eggs, inverting it to draw the reader&#x27;s attention.

Literature professor Donald E. Pease described Sam-I-am as &quot;a young Grinch-like creature&quot;. One academic, Tim Wolf, argued that Sam-I-am has no distinguishing gender or sex and could be read as male or female.

It has been reported that the book was banned in China from 1965 to 1991 because it supposedly contained themes of &quot;early Marxism&quot;— that is to say, Soviet-style socialism (which was at odds with Chinese socialism). Allegedly, the breakfast was interpreted as a metaphor for Soviet socialism, with many initially rejecting it but eventually coming to enjoy it after &quot;trying&quot; it.

== Reception ==
&quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; was widely praised upon its release, and reviewers overwhelmingly celebrated that the book was written using only 50 distinct words. Emily Maxwell of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; commented on Seuss&#x27;s use of the vocabulary, saying that &quot;reading him, one is hardly aware that there &quot;are&quot; more than fifty words&quot;. It was praised for its rhythm and illustrations as well as its use of rhymes. The humorous nature of the book was also received positively.

&quot;The Saturday Review of Literature&quot; praised the book&#x27;s pacing, paying attention specifically to the opening pages in which Sam-I-am introduces himself with a placard. Professor of children&#x27;s literature Philip Nel similarly lauded the introduction for introducing the conflict of the book visually through Sam-I-am&#x27;s active movement and the unnamed man&#x27;s avoidance.

In 1999, the National Education Association conducted an online survey of children and teachers, seeking the 100 most popular children&#x27;s books. The children ranked &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; third, just above another Dr. Seuss book, &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;. The teachers ranked it fourth. Teachers ranked it fourth again in a 2007 National Education Association poll. &quot;Scholastic Parent &amp; Child&quot; magazine placed it #7 among the &quot;100 Greatest Books for Kids&quot; in 2012. That same year, it was ranked number 12 among the &quot;Top 100 Picture Books&quot; in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot; – the first of five Dr. Seuss books on the list.

== Impact and legacy ==

In 1967, &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; ranked as the best-selling children&#x27;s book. At the end of 2000, it had sold 8,143,088 copies, making it the most popular book by Dr. Seuss and the all-time fourth best-selling hardcover children&#x27;s book in the United States.

At Dr. Seuss&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot;, Dartmouth College, it became an inside joke that the book&#x27;s title was a reference to the breakfast food served in the on-campus cafeteria. When Dr. Seuss received an honorary doctorate from Princeton University in 1985, the graduating class rose and recited &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; in its entirety for him. Dr. Seuss reportedly spent the rest of his life enduring gifts of green eggs and ham, which he described as &quot;deplorable stuff&quot;. Later in life, he said that &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; was the only book of his that still made him laugh.

The Green Eggs and Ham Cafe opened in the Seuss Landing island at the Universal Islands of Adventure theme park in 1999. It closed in 2015 before reopening in 2019. The cafe serves the titular green eggs and ham as well as other foods featured in Dr. Seuss books.

U.S. District Court Judge James Muirhead referenced &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; in his September 21, 2007, court ruling after receiving an egg in the mail from prisoner Charles Jay Wolff, who was protesting against the prison diet. Muirhead ordered the egg destroyed and rendered his judgment in the style of Seuss. Senator Ted Cruz read the book on the floor of the United States Senate during his filibuster over the funding of the Affordable Care Act. Musician will.i.am has stated that his moniker is inspired by the story.

Many parodies of &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; have been created, including a rap song by Moxy Früvous and a sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; featuring the minister Jesse Jackson reading the book during a sermon.

&quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; has been adapted into stage and television versions. In 1973, it was adapted as an animated television special alongside &quot;The Sneetches&quot; and &quot;The Zax&quot;. Originally titled &quot;Dr. Seuss on the Loose&quot;, the special was later renamed &quot;Green Eggs and Ham and Other Stories&quot;. The book was adapted as a video game for the Game Boy Advance, &quot;Dr. Seuss&#x27; Green Eggs and Ham,&quot; published by NewKidCo and released on November 17, 2003. A television adaptation was released by Netflix in 2019, also titled &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot;. It stars Adam DeVine as Sam-I-Am, a wildlife protector, and Michael Douglas as the unnamed man, a failed inventor who is given the name Guy-Am-I for the series. The show introduces new characters, settings, and plots independently from the book. A graphic novel &quot;Green Eggs and Ham Take a Hike&quot;, released on January 7, 2025, is written and illustrated by James Kochalka. In the graphic novel, the unnamed man&#x27;s name is Walter.

<text>Herbert Henry Lehman (March 28, 1878 – December 5, 1963) was an American financier and Democratic politician who served as the 45th governor of New York from 1933 to 1942 and represented New York in the United States Senate from 1949 until 1957.

==Early life and career==
He was born to a Reform Jewish family in Manhattan, New York City, the son of Babetta (née Newgass) and German-born immigrant Mayer Lehman, one of the three brothers who co-founded Lehman Brothers financial services firm. His brother was New York Court of Appeals judge Irving Lehman. Herbert&#x27;s father arrived from Rimpar, Germany, in 1848, settling in Montgomery, Alabama, where he engaged in the slave-era cotton business. As cotton was the most important crop of the Southern United States and global demand led to profitable business, the Lehman brothers became cotton factors, accepting cotton bales from customers as payment for their merchandise. Cotton trading eventually became the main thrust of their business. In 1867, Mayer and Emanuel moved the company&#x27;s headquarters to New York City, and helped found the New York Cotton Exchange.

He attended The Sachs School, founded by Julius Sachs. In 1895, he graduated from Sachs Collegiate Institute in New York City, and in 1899, he graduated with a B.A. from Williams College. After college, Lehman worked in textile manufacturing, eventually becoming vice-president and treasurer of the J. Spencer Turner Company in Brooklyn. In 1908, he became a partner in the investment banking firm Lehman Brothers of New York City with his brother Arthur and cousin Philip. By 1928, when he entered public service, he had withdrawn entirely from business.

==Military career==
At the start of World War I, Lehman applied to attend a Citizens&#x27; Military Training Camp at Plattsburgh Barracks, New York. While his April 1917 application was pending, Lehman volunteered his services to the United States Navy as an expert on textiles the navy would need to acquire for uniforms and other wartime clothing and equipment. During this service, he worked closely with Franklin D. Roosevelt, then serving as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, which Roosevelt mentioned during campaign appearances when Roosevelt and Lehman were the Democratic nominees for governor and lieutenant governor in 1928.

In September 1917, Lehman was commissioned as a captain in the United States Army&#x27;s Ordnance Corps. He was assigned as chief of the Ordnance Department&#x27;s Equipment Section on the staff of the United States Department of War, and he was promoted to major in January 1918. Lehman subsequently served as chief of War Department&#x27;s Methods Section, then chief of its Purchase Branch, and he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in October 1918.

After the end of the war in November 1918, Lehman took part in the army&#x27;s demobilization as a member of the Board of Contract Adjustment, assistant director of the office of Purchase, Storage and Traffic, member of the War Department Claims Board, and chairman of the Board of Sales and Contract Termination. He was promoted to colonel in April 1919, and was discharged in June 1919. In July 1919, he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal.

==Early political career==

Lehman became active in politics in 1920 and managed Governor Alfred E. Smith&#x27;s successful reelection campaign in 1926. He became chairman of the finance committee of the Democratic Party in 1928. He was elected lieutenant governor of New York in 1928 and 1930 and resigned from Lehman Brothers upon taking office.

==Governor of New York==
He then served four terms as Governor of New York, elected in 1932 to replace Franklin D. Roosevelt (who had been running for president), and re-elected in 1934, 1936 and 1938 (when he was elected to New York&#x27;s first four-year gubernatorial term). Unlike Smith, Lehman was a supporter of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal and implemented a similar program in New York. Elements of this program included an unemployment insurance system, an improved workmen&#x27;s compensation plan, minimum wage standards for women and children, and a &quot;Little Wagner Act&quot; to cover workers engaged in intrastate commerce. Under the original Wagner Act, workers engaged in intrastate commerce were not allowed to unionize. In 1934, Lehman refused to grant clemency to Anna Antonio, an Italian immigrant who was accused of hiring hitmen to kill her husband, who she claimed was abusive.

In October 1941, Lillian Hellman and Ernest Hemingway co-hosted a dinner to raise money for anti-Nazi activists imprisoned in France. New York Governor Herbert Lehman agreed to participate, but withdrew because some of the sponsoring organizations, he wrote, &quot;have long been connected with Communist activities.&quot; Hellman replied: &quot;I do not and I did not ask the politics of any members of the committee and there is nobody who can with honesty vouch for anybody but themselves.&quot; She assured him the funds raised would be used as promised and later provided him with a detailed accounting. The next month she wrote him: &quot;I am sure it will make you sad and ashamed as it did me to know that, of the seven resignations out of 147 sponsors, five were Jews. Of all the peoples in the world, I think, we should be the last to hold back help, on any grounds, from those who fought for us.&quot;

On December 3, 1942, he resigned the governorship less than a month before the end of his term, to accept an appointment as director of the Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation Operations for the U.S. Department of State. He served as director-general of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration from 1943 to 1946.

==United States Senator==
Lehman was the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senator from New York in 1946 and also ran on the Liberal and American Labor tickets but was defeated by the Republican candidate, Irving Ives. In 1949, he ran again, this time in a special election to serve the remainder of Robert F. Wagner&#x27;s term. Lehman defeated John Foster Dulles, who had been appointed to temporarily fill the vacancy after Wagner&#x27;s resignation, and he took his seat on November 9, 1949.

On October 17, 1950, New York State Supreme Court Judge Ferdinand Pecora and Senator Lehman (D-NY) gave radio addresses on behalf of the CIO-PAC during prime (10:30-11:15 P.M.).

In the campaign, he ran on the Democratic and Liberal tickets, with the American Labor Party urging their members not to vote for any candidate. In 1950, Lehman was re-elected to a full term, running on Democratic and Liberal lines and opposed by the American Labor Party.

Lehman was one of two U.S. senators who were opposed to nominating Mississippi Senator James O. Eastland to be chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. (The other was Wayne Morse of Oregon.) He was also an early and vocal opponent of Senator Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.). Lehman was one of the most liberal senators and was therefore not considered part of the Senate&#x27;s &quot;club&quot; of insiders. He retired from the Senate after his full term and was not a candidate for the 1956 election.

==Retirement and death==
After his retirement from the Senate, Lehman remained politically active, working with Eleanor Roosevelt and Thomas K. Finletter in the late 1950s and early 1960s to support the reform Democratic movement in Manhattan that eventually defeated longtime Tammany Hall boss Carmine DeSapio. He also helped to found the Lehman Children&#x27;s Zoo (now the Tisch Zoo) in Central Park.

Lehman was the first, and until the 2007 inauguration of Eliot Spitzer, the only Jewish governor of New York. During much of his Senate career, he was the only Jewish Senator as well. Unlike most of his Jewish constituents, who had immigrated to the US from eastern Europe, Lehman&#x27;s family was from Germany.
Lehman spent much of the last two years of his life at his New York City home in increasingly poor health. He died of heart failure on December 5, 1963, at the age of 85. Lehman is interred at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York.

==Personal life==
On April 28, 1910, Lehman married Edith Louise Altschul (sister of banker Frank Altschul). The couple had three children: Hilda (1921), Peter (1917), and John. Hilda, Peter and John served in the United States military during World War II; Peter was killed while on active duty. According to a group history published April 6, 1944, the governor&#x27;s son was to be awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. The medal was set to be awarded to Peter on his father&#x27;s 70th birthday. Peter married and had two daughters: Penny Lehman (1940) and Wendy Lehman (1942). His daughter Hilda married thrice. In 1940, Hilda married WPA actor Boris De Vadetzky, of French Russian descent; they later divorced. In 1945, she married U.S. Army Major Eugene L. Paul; they later divorced. She married a third time which also ended in divorce. She had three children: Deborah Wise (1947), Peter Wise (1949) and Stephanie Wise (1951).

<text>Reccared I (or Recared; ; ; 559 – December 601; reigned 586–601) was the king of the Visigoths, ruling in Hispania, Gallaecia and Septimania. His reign marked a climactic shift in history, with the king&#x27;s renunciation of Arianism in favour of Nicene Christianity in 587.

==Reign==

Reccared was the younger son of King Leovigild by his first wife. Like his father, Reccared had his capital at Toledo. The Visigothic kings and nobles were traditionally Arian Christians, while the Hispano-Roman population were Chalcedonian Christians. The bishop Leander of Seville was instrumental in converting the elder son and heir of Leovigild, Hermenegild, to Chalcedonianism. Leander supported his rebellion and was exiled for his role.

When King Leovigild died, within a few weeks of April 21, 586, bishop Leander was swift to return to Toledo. The new king had been associated with his father in ruling the kingdom and was acclaimed king by the Visigothic nobles without opposition.

In January 587, Reccared renounced Arianism for Chalcedonianism, the single great event of his reign and the turning point for Visigothic Hispania. Most Arian nobles and ecclesiastics followed his example, certainly those around him at Toledo, but there were Arian uprisings, notably in Septimania, his northernmost province, beyond the Pyrenees, where the leader of opposition was the Arian bishop Athaloc, who had the reputation among his Roman enemies of being virtually a second Arius. Among the secular leaders of the Septimanian insurrection, the counts Granista and Wildigern appealed to Guntram of Burgundy, who saw his opportunity and sent his &quot;dux&quot; Desiderius. Reccared&#x27;s army defeated the Arian insurgents and their Catholic allies with great slaughter, Desiderius himself being slain.

The next conspiracy broke out in the west, Lusitania, headed by Sunna, the Arian bishop of Mérida, and count Segga. Claudius, Reccared&#x27;s &quot;dux Lusitaniae&quot;, put down the rising, Sunna being banished to Mauritania and Segga retiring to Gallaecia. In the later part of 588 a third conspiracy was headed by the Arian bishop Uldila and the queen dowager Goiswintha, but they were detected, and the bishop was banished.

The Third Council of Toledo, organized by St. Leander but convened in the king&#x27;s name in May 589, set the tone for the new Catholic kingdom. The public confession of the king, read aloud by a notary, reveals by the emphatic clarity of its theological points and its quotations of scripture that it was ghost-written for the king. Bishop Leander also delivered the triumphant closing sermon, which his brother Isidore entitled &quot;Homilia de triumpho ecclesiae ob conversionem Gothorum&quot; a homily upon the &quot;triumph of the Church upon the conversion of the Goths&quot;. The text of the homily survives. Leander and the Roman bishops immediately instituted the program of forced conversion of Jews and extirpation of the remains of Arianism as heresy. Catholic history traditionally imputes these persecutions to the Visigothic kings. When, after Reccared&#x27;s reign, at a synod held at Toledo in 633, the bishops took upon themselves the nobles&#x27; right to select a king from among the royal family, the transfer of power was complete. By this time the remaining ethnic distinction between the increasingly Romanized Visigoths and their Hispano-Roman subjects had all but disappeared (the Gothic language lost its last and probably already declining function as a church language with the extirpation of Arianism, and dress and funerary customs also cease to be distinguishing features in ca. 570/580)

Reportedly Reccared engaged in a vigorous policy against the Jews, pursuing zealous and fanatical policies limiting Jewish freedoms as promulgated in the canons of synods. Modern historians have revised this view and see a continuation of traditional Visigothic tolerance. Pope Gregory I was convinced that Reccared refused bribes from the Jewish community, which was large, well-connected throughout the Mediterranean and powerful, and Reccared&#x27;s laws provided that the offspring of a Christian and a Jew be baptised, which was of little moment to the Jewish community, as whether it was not born of a Jewish mother or was born of a Jewish woman outside her community, the child was not considered a Jew anyway. Reccared eliminated the death penalty for Jews convicted of proselytising among Christians and ignored Gregory&#x27;s request that the trade in Christian slaves at Narbonne be forbidden to Jews. Among the canons of five synods during Reccared&#x27;s reign, E. A. Thompson could find none disadvantaging the Jewish community.

The information for the rest of Reccared&#x27;s reign is scanty. John of Biclaro, Reccared&#x27;s contemporary, ends his account with the Third Council of Toledo. Isidore of Seville, bishop Leander&#x27;s brother, praises his peaceful government, clemency, and generosity: standard encomia. He returned various properties, even some private ones, that had been confiscated by his father, and founded many churches and monasteries. Pope Gregory, writing to Reccared in August 599 (&quot;Epp&quot;. ix. 61, 122), extols him for embracing the true faith and inducing his people to do so, and notably for refusing the bribes offered by Jews to procure the repeal of a law against them. He sent Reccared a piece of the True Cross, some fragments of the chains of St. Peter, and some hairs of St. John the Baptist.

Reccared was married to Baddo and possibly to Chlodoswintha. He died a natural death at Toledo and was succeeded by his youthful son Liuva II.

<text>In mathematics, a harshad number (or Niven number) in a given number base is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits when written in that base. Harshad numbers in base are also known as -harshad (or -Niven) numbers. Because being a Harshad number is determined based on the base the number is expressed in, a number can be a Harshad number many times over. So-called Trans-Harshad numbers are Harshad numbers in every base.

Harshad numbers were defined by D. R. Kaprekar, a mathematician from India. The word &quot;harshad&quot; comes from the Sanskrit &#x27; (joy) +&#x27; (give), meaning joy-giver. The term &quot;Niven number&quot; arose from a paper delivered by Ivan M. Niven at a conference on number theory in 1977.

== Definition ==

Stated mathematically, let be a positive integer with digits when written in base , and let the digits be formula_1 (formula_2). (It follows that formula_1 must be either zero or a positive integer up to .) can be expressed as

:formula_4

 is a harshad number in base if:

:formula_5
A number which is a harshad number in every number base is called an all-harshad number, or an all-Niven number. There are only four all-harshad numbers: 1, 2, 4, and 6. The number 12 is a harshad number in all bases except octal.

== Examples ==
* The number 18 is a harshad number in base 10, because the sum of the digits 1 and 8 is 9, and 18 is divisible by 9.
* The Hardy–Ramanujan number (1729) is a harshad number in base 10, since it is divisible by 19, the sum of its digits (1729 = 19 × 91).
* The number 19 is not a harshad number in base 10, because the sum of the digits 1 and 9 is 10, and 19 is not divisible by 10.
*In base 10, every natural number expressible in the form 9R&quot;n&quot;&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;, where the number R&quot;n&quot; consists of &quot;n&quot; copies of the single digit 1, &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0, and &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; is a positive integer less than 10&quot;n&quot; and multiple of &quot;n&quot;, is a harshad number. (R. D’Amico, 2019). The number 9R3&quot;a&quot;3 = 521478, where R3 = 111, &quot;n&quot; = 3 and &quot;a&quot;3 = 3×174 = 522, is a harshad number; in fact, we have: 521478/(5+2+1+4+7+8) = 521478/27 = 19314.
*Harshad numbers in base 10 form the sequence:
*: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, 20, 21, 24, 27, 30, 36, 40, 42, 45, 48, 50, 54, 60, 63, 70, 72, 80, 81, 84, 90, 100, 102, 108, 110, 111, 112, 114, 117, 120, 126, 132, 133, 135, 140, 144, 150, 152, 153, 156, 162, 171, 180, 190, 192, 195, 198, 200, ... .
*All integers between zero and are -harshad numbers.

== Properties ==

Given the divisibility test for 9, one might be tempted to generalize that all numbers divisible by 9 are also harshad numbers. But for the purpose of determining the harshadness of , the digits of can only be added up once and must be divisible by that sum; otherwise, it is not a harshad number. For example, 99 is not a harshad number, since 9 + 9 = 18, and 99 is not divisible by 18.

The base number (and furthermore, its powers) will always be a harshad number in its own base, since it will be represented as &quot;10&quot; and 1 + 0 = 1.

All numbers whose base &quot;b&quot; digit sum divides &quot;b&quot;−1 are harshad numbers in base &quot;b&quot;.

For a prime number to also be a harshad number it must be less than or equal to the base number, otherwise the digits of the prime will add up to a number that is more than 1, but less than the prime, and will not be divisible. For example: 11 is not harshad in base 10 because the sum of its digits “11” is 1 + 1 = 2, and 11 is not divisible by 2; while in base 12 the number 11 may be represented as “”, the sum of whose digits is also . Since is divisible by itself, it is harshad in base 12.

Although the sequence of factorials starts with harshad numbers in base 10, not all factorials are harshad numbers. 432! is the first that is not. (432! has digit sum 3897 = 32 × 433 in base 10, thus not dividing 432!)

The smallest such that formula_6 is a harshad number are
:1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 10, 1, 9, 3, 2, 3, 6, 1, 6, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 6, 1, 3, 9, 1, 12, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 10, 1, 12, 3, 1, 5, 9, 1, 8, 1, 2, 3, 18, 1, 2, 2, 2, 9, 9, 1, 12, 6, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1, 18, 1, 7, 3, 2, 2, 4, 2, 9, 1, ... .

The smallest such that formula_6 is not a harshad number are
:11, 7, 5, 4, 3, 11, 2, 2, 11, 13, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 161, 1, 8, 5, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 13, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 83, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 11, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 537, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 83, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 68, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, ... .

== Other bases ==
The harshad numbers in base 12 are:
:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, , , 10, 1, 20, 29, 30, 38, 40, 47, 50, 56, 60, 65, 70, 74, 80, 83, 90, 92, 0, 1, 0, 100, 10, 110, 115, 119, 120, 122, 128, 130, 134, 137, 146, 150, 153, 155, 164, 172, 173, 182, 191, 10, 10, 1, 200, ...
where represents ten and represents eleven.

Smallest such that formula_6 is a base-12 harshad number are (written in base 10):
:1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 12, 6, 4, 3, 10, 2, 11, 3, 4, 1, 7, 1, 12, 6, 4, 3, 11, 2, 11, 3, 1, 5, 9, 1, 12, 11, 4, 3, 11, 2, 11, 1, 4, 4, 11, 1, 16, 6, 4, 3, 11, 2, 1, 3, 11, 11, 11, 1, 12, 11, 5, 7, 9, 1, 7, 3, 3, 9, 11, 1, ...

Smallest such that formula_6 is not a base-12 harshad number are (written in base 10):
:13, 7, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 13, 16, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 157, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 13, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 157, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1885, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, ...

Similar to base 10, not all factorials are harshad numbers in base 12. After 7! (= 5040 = 200 in base 12, with digit sum 13 in base 12, and 13 does not divide 7!), 1276! is the next that is not. (1276! has digit sum 14201 = 11 × 1291 in base 12, thus does not divide 1276!)

== Consecutive harshad numbers ==

=== Maximal runs of consecutive harshad numbers ===
Cooper and Kennedy proved in 1993 that no 21 consecutive integers are all harshad numbers in base 10. They also constructed infinitely many 20-tuples of consecutive integers that are all 10-harshad numbers, the smallest of which exceeds 1044363342786.

 extended the Cooper and Kennedy result to show that there are 2&quot;b&quot; but not 2&quot;b&quot; + 1 consecutive &quot;b&quot;-harshad numbers for any base &quot;b&quot;. 
This result was strengthened to show that there are infinitely many runs of 2&quot;b&quot; consecutive &quot;b&quot;-harshad numbers for &quot;b&quot; = 2 or 3 by and for arbitrary &quot;b&quot; by Brad Wilson in 1997.

In binary, there are thus infinitely many runs of four consecutive harshad numbers and in ternary infinitely many runs of six.

In general, such maximal sequences run from &quot;N&quot;·&quot;bk&quot; − &quot;b&quot; to &quot;N&quot;·&quot;bk&quot; + (&quot;b&quot; − 1), where &quot;b&quot; is the base, &quot;k&quot; is a relatively large power, and &quot;N&quot; is a constant.
Given one such suitably chosen sequence, we can convert it to a larger one as follows:
* Inserting zeroes into &quot;N&quot; will not change the sequence of digital sums (just as 21, 201 and 2001 are all 10-harshad numbers).
* If we insert &quot;n&quot; zeroes after the first digit, &quot;α&quot; (worth &quot;αbi&quot;), we increase the value of &quot;N&quot; by formula_10.
* If we can ensure that &quot;bn&quot; − 1 is divisible by all digit sums in the sequence, then the divisibility by those sums is maintained.
* If our initial sequence is chosen so that the digit sums are coprime to &quot;b&quot;, we can solve &quot;bn&quot; = 1 modulo all those sums.
* If that is not so, but the part of each digit sum not coprime to &quot;b&quot; divides &quot;αbi&quot;, then divisibility is still maintained.
* &quot;(Unproven)&quot; The initial sequence is so chosen.
Thus our initial sequence yields an infinite set of solutions.

=== First runs of exactly consecutive 10-harshad numbers ===
The smallest naturals starting runs of &quot;exactly&quot; consecutive 10-harshad numbers (i.e., the smallest such that formula_11 are harshad numbers but formula_12 and formula_13 are not) are as follows :

| || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5
| || 12 || 20 || 110 || 510 || 
| || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10
| || || || || || 1
| || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15
| || || || || || 
| || 16 || 17 || 18 || 19 || 20
| || || || || ||

By the previous section, no such exists for formula_14

== Estimating the density of harshad numbers ==

If we let formula_15 denote the number of harshad numbers formula_16, then for any given formula_17

:formula_18

as shown by Jean-Marie De Koninck and Nicolas Doyon; furthermore, De Koninck, Doyon and Kátai proved that

:formula_19

where formula_20 and the formula_21 term uses Big O notation.

== Sums of harshad numbers ==

Every natural number not exceeding one billion is either a harshad number or the sum of two harshad numbers. Conditional to a technical hypothesis on the zeros of certain Dedekind zeta functions, Sanna proved that there exists a positive integer formula_22 such that every natural number is the sum of at most formula_22 harshad numbers, that is, the set of harshad numbers is an additive basis.

The number of ways that each natural number 1, 2, 3, ... can be written as sum of two harshad numbers is:
:0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 5, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 7, 4, 5, 6, 5, 3, 7, 4, 4, 6, 4, 2, 7, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 7, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 8, 3, 4, 6, 3, 3, 6, 2, 5, 6, 5, 3, 8, 4, 4, 6, ... .

The smallest number that can be written in exactly 1, 2, 3, ... ways as the sum of two harshad numbers is:
:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 51, 48, 72, 108, 126, 90, 138, 144, 120, 198, 162, 210, 216, 315, 240, 234, 306, 252, 372, 270, 546, 360, 342, 444, 414, 468, 420, 642, 450, 522, 540, 924, 612, 600, 666, 630, 888, 930, 756, 840, 882, 936, 972, 1098, 1215, 1026, 1212, 1080, ... .

== Nivenmorphic numbers ==

A Nivenmorphic number or harshadmorphic number for a given number base is an integer such that there exists some harshad number whose digit sum is , and , written in that base, terminates written in the same base.

For example, 18 is a Nivenmorphic number for base 10:

 16218 is a harshad number
 16218 has 18 as digit sum
 18 terminates 16218

Sandro Boscaro determined that for base 10 all positive integers are Nivenmorphic numbers except 11. In fact, for an even integer &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1, all positive integers except &quot;n&quot;+1 are Nivenmorphic numbers for base &quot;n&quot;, and for an odd integer &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1, all positive integers are Nivenmorphic numbers for base &quot;n&quot;. e.g. the Nivenmorphic numbers in base 12 are (all positive integers except 13).

The smallest number with base 10 digit sum &quot;n&quot; and terminates &quot;n&quot; written in base 10 are: (0 if no such number exists)

:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 910, 0, 912, 11713, 6314, 915, 3616, 15317, 918, 17119, 9920, 18921, 9922, 82823, 19824, 9925, 46826, 18927, 18928, 78329, 99930, 585931, 388832, 1098933, 198934, 289835, 99936, 99937, 478838, 198939, 1999840, 2988941, 2979942, 2979943, 999944, 999945, 4698946, 4779947, 2998848, 2998849, 9999950, ... 

== Multiple harshad numbers ==
 defines a multiple harshad number as a harshad number that, when divided by the sum of its digits, produces another harshad number. He states that 6804 is &quot;MHN-4&quot; on the grounds that
:formula_24

(it is not MHN-5 since formula_25, but 1 is not &quot;another&quot; harshad number)

and went on to show that 2016502858579884466176 is MHN-12. The number 10080000000000 = 1008 × 1010, which is smaller, is also MHN-12. In general, 1008 × 10&quot;n&quot; is MHN-(&quot;n&quot;+2).

<text>Nathan Lewis Miller (October 10, 1868 – June 26, 1953) was an American lawyer and politician who was the 43rd governor of New York from 1921 to 1922.

==Early life and education==
Nathan Miller was born on October 10, 1868, the son of Samuel Miller, a tenant farmer, and Almira Russell Miller. He attended Groton Union School and graduated from Cortland Normal School in 1887. While at Cortland Normal School, Nathan Miller was in Gamma Sigma Fraternity. He studied law in Cortland, New York, and was admitted to the bar in 1893.

==Career==
Miller entered politics as a Republican and started his political career in Cortland as corporation counsel. He later moved to corporate law, and his rise in politics was strongly helped by his relationship with Andrew Carnegie and the United States Steel Corporation. Miller helped to effect the mergers that created this early megacorporation. The merger helped Carnegie get out of the steel business and make him one of the richest men in the world at the time.

Miller was New York State Comptroller from 1901 to 1903, first appointed to fill the unexpired term of Erastus C. Knight who had been elected Mayor of Buffalo, and in November 1902 elected to a full term.

He resigned the comptrollership in 1903, and was appointed to the New York Supreme Court, where he served from 1903 to 1915. In 1904, he was designated to the Appellate Division. On January 13, 1913, he was designated an associate judge of the New York Court of Appeals under the amendment of 1899, but resigned from the bench on July 30, 1915. He served as president of the New York State Bar Association in 1920. He nominated Herbert Hoover for president at the 1920 Republican National Convention.

===Governor of New York===
Miller was Governor of New York from 1921 to 1922, elected in 1920. As governor he instituted numerous economy measures, and he estimated that he had saved taxpayers $20 million. Against opposition from New York City Mayor John F. Hylan, Miller fashioned the law creating the New York State Transit Commission. He found the death penalty necessary and was against its abolition. In 1922, he was defeated in a bid for re-election by his predecessor Al Smith, whom he had unseated in 1920. Miller was a strong supporter of the Roman Catholic Church, his wife&#x27;s religion, and converted to Catholicism on his deathbed. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was created while Miller was Governor.

===Later career===
From 1925 on he served as general counsel for U.S. Steel. He and his old adversary Smith was active in the American Liberty League, a bipartisan anti-New Deal group founded by wealthy conservatives. While Miller was still the leading partner at his law firm in 1938, Carnegie&#x27;s Pittsburgh Steamship Company named a ship &quot;Governor Miller&quot; in his honor.

==Personal life==
On November 23, 1896, he married Elizabeth Davern, and they had seven daughters. They resided at the Elmcroft Estate in Upper Brookville, New York. Miller&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth married Alvin P. Adams Sr., their son is Alvin P. Adams Jr.

Miller died in 1953 at his New York hotel residence after fracturing his hip following a vacation in Arizona. He was buried in Cortland at the historic Cortland Rural Cemetery.

===Honors===
In January 1952, the New York State Bar Association awarded Miller its first gold medal for &quot;distinguished service to the legal profession.&quot;

<text>The AMX International AMX is a ground-attack aircraft jointly developed by Brazil and Italy. The AMX is designated A-11 Ghibli by the Italian Air Force and A-1 by the Brazilian Air Force. The Italian name, &quot;Ghibli&quot;, is taken from the hot dry wind of the Libyan desert.

During the early 1970s, Italian manufacturer Aermacchi conducted a design study on a prospective light ground-attack aircraft, which was given the designation of &quot;MB-340&quot;. In 1977, the Italian Air Force issued a requirement for 187 new-build strike fighters, which were to replace its existing Aeritalia G.91 in the close air support role. In 1980, the Brazilian government announced that they intended to participate in the program in order to provide a replacement for the Aermacchi MB-326 used by the Brazilian Air Force. As a result of a memorandum between Italy and Brazil for the aircraft&#x27;s joint development in 1981, AMX International, an Italian-Brazilian joint venture, was formed to develop, manufacture, and market the aircraft.

==Development==
During early 1977, the Italian Air Force issued a requirement for 187 new-build strike fighters, which were to replace its existing Aeritalia G.91 in the close air support and reconnaissance missions, as well as the Lockheed RF-104G Starfighter also being used in the reconnaissance role. Rather than competing for the contract, Aeritalia (now Alenia Aeronautica) and Aermacchi agreed to produce a joint proposal for the requirement, as both firms had been considering the development of a similar class of aircraft for some years. During the early 1970s, Aermacchi conducted work on a design study for such a light ground attack aircraft under the designation of &quot;MB-340&quot;. In April 1978, development work on the joint venture formally commenced.

During 1980, the Brazilian government announced that they intended to participate in the program in order to provide a replacement for the Aermacchi MB-326. In July 1981, the Italian and Brazilian governments agreed on joint requirements for the aircraft, and Embraer was invited to join the industrial partnership. An agreement was also struck to divide AMX manufacturing between the partners; for each production aircraft, Aeritalia manufactured 46.5 per cent of the components (central fuselage, stabilisers and rudders), Aermacchi produced 22.8 per cent (front fuselage and tail cone), and Embraer performed 29.7 per cent of the work (wing, air intakes, pylons and drop tanks). There was no duplication of work, each component of the aircraft was built at one source only. The planned requirements were 187 aircraft for Italy and 100 for Brazil. Final deliveries were 136 aircraft for the Italian Air Force (110 AMX &amp; 26 AMX-T) and 94 airplanes for the Brazilian Air Force (79 AMX &amp; 15 AMX-T) for a total of 230 planes between the two countries.

In the early stages of development, various different powerplants and engine configurations were studied to power the type; both twin-engine and single-engine approaches were considered. The use of US-sourced engines had been promptly discounted to avoid any potential restrictions on export sales of the overall aircraft. Amongst the engines examined were the Turbo-Union RB199 (as used by the larger Panavia Tornado), the Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour, Rolls-Royce Viper, and the Rolls-Royce Spey engine. In 1978, the Spey 807 model, which featured several additional improvements, was selected to power the new aircraft.

Key features that were reportedly emphasised in the design process of the new aircraft were accessibility and survivability; the AMX had to be able to sustain a single failure to any onboard system without any performance degradation. To achieve this, key systems are duplicated and vital systems are protected; the use of cockpit armor was considered but ultimately discounted due to the expense involved. The detailed definition phase of the project was completed in March 1980.

A total of seven flight-capable prototypes were produced for the test program, three by Aeritalia, two by Aermacchi, and two by Embraer, as well as two static airframes. The first prototype, assembled in Italy, made its maiden flight on 15 May 1984. This first aircraft was lost on its fifth flight in an accident, resulting in the death of its pilot. Aside from this early loss, testing progressed without further incident. The first Brazilian-assembled prototype made its first flight on 16 October 1985. On 11 May 1988, the first production aircraft performed its first flight. Deliveries of production aircraft to Italy began in 1988, the first units were delivered to the Brazilian Air Force during the following year. On 14 March 1990, the prototype two-seat AMX made its first flight.

==Design==
The AMX is a conventional shoulder-winged monoplane. It is composed primarily of aluminium and manufactured using traditional construction methods, however elements such as the tail fin and elevators use carbon fibre composite materials. For its size, a large proportion of the AMX&#x27;s internal space is allocated to avionics and onboard computer systems, both the navigation and attack systems are computerized. For accessibility and ease of maintenance, all avionics are installed directly in bays beneath the cockpit in a manner in which they can be worked upon at ground level without the use of support platforms.

Drawing on experience from the Panavia Tornado, the AMX is equipped with a hybrid flight control system; a fly-by-wire control system is employed to operate flight control surfaces such as the spoilers, rudder and variable incidence tailplane, while the ailerons and elevators are actuated via a dual-redundant hydraulic system. Manual reversion is provided for the ailerons, elevator and rudder to allow the aircraft to be flown even in the event of complete hydraulic failure; either control system can act independent of one another. The wing is fitted with both leading edge slats and trailing edge flaps and overwing spoilers ahead of the flaps. The spoilers can function as airbrakes and to negate lift; improving take-off and landing performance as well as manoeuvrability during flight.

A single Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engine serves as the AMX&#x27;s powerplant. During the aircraft&#x27;s development, the Spey was heavier and less modern than some of the available alternatives, but it was considered to be reliable, relatively cheap and was free of export restrictions that would be imposed by using American engines. The Spey engine also enabled for the use of a simplified round-lipped inlet design. The rear fuselage is detachable in order to gain access to the engine. Separate consortia in both Brazil and Italy manufactured the Spey for the AMX. Unusual for a strike aircraft of the era, no attempt was made to develop the aircraft to fly at supersonic speeds.

Brazilian and Italian aircraft differ considerably in their avionics, Italian aircraft being equipped with various NATO systems which were considered redundant in the South American theatre. AMXs in Brazilian service are often fitted with one of three pallet-mounted sensor packages, which contain various vertical, oblique, and forward-facing cameras, for performing the aircraft&#x27;s secondary aerial reconnaissance role. A simple ranging radar is equipped for targeting purposes, however the specific radar also differs between both operators. The flight system employs a GE Avionics flight control computer. Extensive electronic countermeasure (ECM) are fitted to protect the aircraft, including passive receiver antenna on the tailfin and an active jammer pod that is typically mounted on one of the aircraft&#x27;s hardpoints.

Various munitions could be mounted on the one centerline and four under-wing hardpoints, including bombs, missiles and rockets; payloads of up to may be carried upon the centerline and the two innermost under-wing pylons, while the outer pylons can carry up to . All four of the under-wing hardpoints are plumbed for drop tanks to extend the aircraft&#x27;s range, Italian aircraft are also fitted with a fixed aerial refueling probe. Optical reconnaissance pods can be carried externally on the centerline hardpoint. Wingtip rails are provided for infrared guided air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder and MAA-1 Piranha. Italian aircraft are fitted with a M61 Vulcan 20 mm rotary cannon on the port side of the lower fuselage. The United States denied the sale of the M61 to Brazil, thus its AMXs are instead fitted with two 30 mm DEFA 554 revolver cannons.

==Operational history==
The first operational squadron of the Italian air force, the 103° &quot;Gruppo&quot; of 51° &quot;Stormo&quot; formed in November 1989, with the first Italian unit also forming in 1989. Both the Italian and Brazilian AMX fleets were grounded in February 1992, following the crash of an Italian AMX due to engine failure. Operations were allowed to restart in May of that year, following modification of the engines.

Italy assigned six AMXs from 103° &quot;Gruppo&quot; to operations over Bosnia in 1995 as part of Operation Deny Flight, which was followed by a similar deployment in support of the IFOR peacekeepers in Bosnia. This deployment was interrupted by another grounding, again due to engine failure, between January and March 1996. Italian AMX aircraft were used in 1999 in the Kosovo war. Instead of using unguided or more traditional laser-guided bombs, the Italian Air Force used dozens of Mk 82 bombs fitted with Opher Israeli guidance kits, effectively converting the &quot;dumb&quot; bombs into an infrared-guided bomb.

In the late 1990s, AMX International was considering a major engine refit; a non-afterburning variant of the Eurojet EJ200 was proposed, with considerably more thrust than the existing powerplant. In 2005, the Italian Air Force launched an upgrade programme (ACOL &quot;Aggionamento Capacità Operative e Logistiche&quot; – Operational and Logistical Capability Upgrade) for 55 of its AMXs, adding a new laser INS, new cockpit displays and allowing the aircraft to drop Joint Direct Attack Munition guided bombs. In August 2007, Embraer began a major midlife upgrade programme and modernisation of 53 Brazilian Air Force AMX A-1s, focusing on avionics systems and new armament additions; the programme is estimated to have extended the lifespan of the fleet beyond 2027.

Starting in November 2009, four Italian AMXs were deployed overseas for operations in Afghanistan, replacing the same number of Italian Tornado IDS in the reconnaissance role. Of particular note is the aircraft&#x27;s ability to share digital electro-optical and infrared sensor information with ground troops in real time, providing valuable reconnaissance information and helping to minimise threat exposure. By the end of 2010 over 700 combat missions had been flown in the Afghan theatre. On 28 May 2014, the AMX performed its last combat sortie in the Afghan theatre, and on 20 June 2014, all remaining AMXs were withdrawn from Afghanistan.

In 2011, Italian AMX aircraft were employed during the 2011 military intervention in Libya. Italian military aircraft deployed 710 guided bombs and missiles during sorties: Italian Air Force Tornados and AMX fighter bombers deployed 550 bombs and missiles, while Navy AV-8Bs deployed 160 guided bombs. The conflict saw the first use by AMX aircraft of Litening targeting pods paired with Paveway and JDAM guided bombs. In early 2016, due to the declining stability of Libya, Italy opted to station additional aircraft, including four AMX fighters, at Bassi Airbase, Trapani, Sicily.

In March 2012, the Philippines were reportedly holding negotiations with Italy for the possible procurement of used AMX aircraft; however, on 28 March 2014, the Philippines&#x27; Department of National Defense signed a contract for 12 FA-50 light attack aircraft worth P18.9 billion (US$421.12 million).

The Italian Air Force held a retirement ceremony on 5 April 2024 at Istrana Air Base in northern Italy.

==Variants==
;AMX-T
In 1986, development of a two-seat advanced trainer variant was undertaken. This was intended to provide trainee pilots with experience on fast jets, while still retaining the single-seater&#x27;s attack capabilities. First flying in 1990, the AMX-T equipped both the Italian and Brazilian air forces.

;AMX-ATA
The AMX Advanced Trainer Attack (AMX-ATA) is a new AMX two-seater multi-mission attack fighter developed for combat roles and advanced training. The AMX-ATA incorporates new sensors, a forward-looking infrared helmet-mounted display, a new multi-mode radar for air-to-air and air-to-surface capability, and new weapons systems including anti-ship missiles and medium-range missiles. The Venezuelan Air Force ordered eight AMX-ATA in 1999 for the advanced trainer and attack aircraft role, but the US Congress vetoed the sale because the aircraft systems include US technology.

;AMX-R (RA-1)
An AMX variant designed for reconnaissance missions. Various reconnaissance pallets can be fitted; used by the Brazilian Air Force.

;A-1M
The product of a Brazilian upgrade program of their A-1s; significant features include a Mectron SCP-01 Scipio radar, Embraer BR2 data link, FLIR Systems navigation equipment, Elbit INS/GPS/databus, the adoption of a glass cockpit, a new OBOGS system and HMD DASH IV.

<text>The Burlesque Hall of Fame (BHOF) is the world&#x27;s only museum dedicated to the history, preservation, and future of the art of burlesque. Located in the Las Vegas Arts district at 1027 S Main st. #110, BHOF is a tourist destination and non-profit 501 (c)(3) educational organization offering tours of its vast Collection of costumes, memorabilia, props and ephemera from burlesque&#x27;s heyday through contemporary practice; classes for individuals and groups at all levels including beginner; movie screenings; research access for students and journalists; and a gift shop.

Formerly known as Exotic World, the museum began as the personal collection of striptease artist and founding member of &quot;The Exotic Dancers&#x27; League of America&quot; Jennie Lee. After her death in 1990, her friend and fellow entertainer, Dixie Evans, created the museum in Helendale, California, and launched the &quot;Miss Exotic World&quot; Competition in 1990.

In 2006, The Burlesque Hall of Fame relocated from Helendale to Las Vegas, NV, to establish itself as a permanent tourist attraction and exhibition space for its collection. After nearly a decade in the Emergency Arts building in the heart of a revitalized Downtown Las Vegas, the museum moved to Las Vegas&#x27; Arts district in 2018.

This Miss Exotic World competition is in its 29th year (as of 2019), and has grown to become The Burlesque Hall of Fame Weekender, a four-day convention held annually in Las Vegas that includes class, vending, museum tours, pin-up safaris, and four nights of showcases: Movers, Shakers, and Innovators; The Titans of Tease Reunion (now in its 68th year); The Miss Exotic World Competition; and Icons and All-Stars.

==History==
Retired dancer Jennie Lee started collecting burlesque memorabilia when she owned the Sassy Lassy nightclub in San Pedro, California. After Lee was diagnosed with breast cancer, she and her husband moved to an abandoned goat farm in Helendale, California, located in the Mojave Desert about one third of the way between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada.

Lee intended to create a burlesque museum, found a burlesque school and run a bed and breakfast, and the goat farm site had enough room to contain her growing collection. Only the museum got started within her lifetime.

After Lee died in 1990, Dixie Evans took over the farm and turned it into &quot;The Exotic World Burlesque Museum&quot;, aided by Lee&#x27;s widower, Charlie Arroyo. Lee&#x27;s memorabilia formed the core of the collection, but people from around the world soon started to donate items to Exotic World. The collection grew large enough to fill the entire farm.

In late 2005, the museum was temporarily closed for inventory and renovations in the wake of Arroyo&#x27;s unexpected death and significant weather damage to the museum facilities. Although the museum was not open at the time of the annual Miss Exotic World Pageant in 2006, the pageant was nevertheless held at an alternate venue, the Celebrity Theater in Las Vegas. In 2006, the Burlesque Hall of Fame relocated from Helendale to a temporary space in The Las Vegas Emergency Arts building.

The Hall of Fame relocated to a permanent premises in S Main Street, Las Vegas in April 2018.

==Legends of Burlesque==
The Burlesque Hall of Fame does not have a formal induction process. The museum is dedicated to celebrating and honoring the entire history of burlesque. A &quot;Living Legend of the Year&quot; award is presented annually during the BHOF Weekender to a performer who has made a significant contribution to burlesque history. BHOF also presents a &quot;Sassy Lassy&quot; award to a person who has contributed significantly to the promotion and preservation of the art of burlesque.

==Museum collection==
The Exotic World museum collection includes costumes, props, posters, photographs, publicity stills, newspaper clippings, and playbills related to famous burlesque performers including Dita Von Teese, Blaze Starr, Lili St. Cyr, Chesty Morgan, Candy Barr and Tempest Storm.

The museum includes costume elements and props such as feather boas, fans, gloves, garter belts, gowns, shoes, pasties, g-strings, and jewelry. Many of these items are specially made for use in striptease routines.

Unique individual items include ivory fans used by Sally Rand, gloves and a black velvet shoulder cape worn by Gypsy Rose Lee, a heart-shaped couch owned by Jayne Mansfield and the cremation ashes of Miss Sheri Champagne.

==Film==
The history of the Burlesque Hall of Fame is the featured subject of the 2010 documentary &quot;Exotic World &amp; the Burlesque Revival&quot;. Dixie Evans appears in Leslie Zemeckis&#x27; documentary &quot;Behind the Burly Q&quot;.

==Miss Exotic World Pageant==

Exotic World hosts the annual Miss Exotic World pageant on the first Saturday of every June. Each year a Neo-burlesque performer is crowned Miss Exotic World in a contest often referred to as the Miss America of burlesque. Winners receive both the title and a trophy.

Evolving from annual celebrations for the Exotic Dancers League union, Dixie Evans initiated the Miss Exotic World pageant in 1990 as a way to draw people to the museum. She garnered attention by sending out a press release claiming that &quot;Lili St. Cyr, Tempest Storm, Blaze Starr and 30 other alumni of burlesque will all be invited to attend this reunion.&quot; While technically true, none of those invitees attended that year. However, the release garnered press attention for the pageant, which was successful enough to become an annual event.

Each contest features burlesque performances by both stars from burlesque&#x27;s golden age and younger women involved in the New Burlesque scene.

<doc id="641324" wikidata="Q1196217" url="?curid=641324" title="Virtual 8086 mode">
<text>In the 80386 microprocessor and later, virtual 8086 mode (also called virtual real mode, V86-mode, or VM86) allows the execution of real mode applications that are incapable of running directly in protected mode while the processor is running a protected mode operating system. It is a hardware virtualization technique that allowed multiple 8086 processors to be emulated by the 386 chip. It emerged from the painful experiences with the 80286 protected mode, which by itself was not suitable to run concurrent real-mode applications well. John Crawford developed the Virtual Mode bit at the register set, paving the way to this environment.

VM86 mode uses a segmentation scheme identical to that of real mode (for compatibility reasons), which creates 20-bit linear addresses in the same manner as 20-bit physical addresses are created in real mode, but are subject to protected mode&#x27;s memory paging mechanism.

==Overview==
The virtual 8086 mode is a mode for a protected-mode task. Consequently, the processor can switch between VM86 and non-VM86 tasks, enabling multitasking legacy (DOS) applications.

To use virtual 8086 mode, an operating system sets up a virtual 8086 mode monitor, which is a program that manages the real-mode program and emulates or filters access to system hardware and software resources. The monitor must run at privilege level 0 and in protected mode. Only the 8086 program runs in VM86 mode and at privilege level 3. When the real-mode program attempts to do things like access certain I/O ports to use hardware devices or access certain regions in its memory space, the CPU traps these events and calls the V86 monitor, which examines what the real mode program is trying to do and either acts as a proxy to interface with the hardware, emulates the intended function the real-mode program was trying to access, or terminates the real-mode program if it is trying to do something that cannot either be allowed or be adequately supported (such as reboot the machine, set a video display into a mode that is not supported by the hardware and is not emulated, or write over operating system code).

The V86 monitor can also deny permission gently by emulating the failure of a requested operation—for example, it can make a disk drive always appear not ready when in fact it has not even checked the drive but simply will not permit the real-mode program to access it. Also, the V86 monitor can do things like map memory pages, intercept calls and interrupts, and preempt the real-mode program, allowing real-mode programs to be multitasked like protected-mode programs. By intercepting the hardware and software I/O of the real-mode program and tracking the state that the V86 program expects, it can allow multiple programs to share the same hardware without interfering with each other. So V86 mode provides a way for real-mode programs designed for a single-tasking environment (like DOS) to run concurrently in a multitasking environment.

==Usage==
It is used to execute certain DOS programs in 
FlexOS 386 (since 1987), Concurrent DOS 386 (since 1987), Windows/386 2.10 (since 1987), DESQview 386 (since 1988), Windows 3.x (since 1990), Multiuser DOS (since 1991), Windows for Workgroups 3.1x (since 1992), OS/2 2.x (since 1992), 4690 OS (since 1993), REAL/32 (since 1995) running in 386 Enhanced Mode as well as in Windows 95, 98, 98 SE and ME through virtual DOS machines, in SCO UNIX through Merge, and in Linux through DOSEMU. (Other DOS programs which use protected mode execute using user mode under the emulator.) NTVDM in x86 Windows NT-based operating systems also use VM86 mode, but with very limited direct hardware access. Some boot loaders (e.g. GRUB) use the protected mode, and execute the BIOS interrupt calls in Virtual 8086 mode.

==Memory addressing and interrupts==
The most common problem by running 8086 code from protected mode is memory addressing which is totally different between protected mode and real mode.
As mentioned, by working under VM86 mode the segmentation mechanism is reconfigured to work just like under real mode, but the paging mechanism is still active, and it is transparent to the real mode code; thus, memory protection is still applicable, and so is the isolation of the address space.

When interrupts (hardware, software and int instruction) occur, the processor switches off the VM86 mode and returns to work in full protected mode to handle the interrupt. Also, before servicing the interrupt, the DS, ES, FS, and GS registers are pushed on the new stack and zeroed.

==Virtual-8086 mode extensions (VME)==
The Pentium architecture added a number of enhancements to the virtual 8086 mode. These were however documented by Intel only starting with the subsequent P6 (microarchitecture); their more recent formal name is Virtual-8086 Mode Extensions, abbreviated VME (older documentation may use &quot;Virtual 8086 mode enhancements&quot; as the VME acronym expansion). Some later Intel 486 chips also support it. The enhancements address mainly the 8086 virtualization overhead, with a particular focus on (virtual) interrupts. Before the extensions were publicly documented in the P6 documentation, the official documentation referred to the famed Appendix H, which was omitted from the public documentation and shared only with selected partners under NDA.

Activating VME is done by setting bit number 0 (0x1 in value) of CR4. Because the VME interrupt speed-up enhancements were found useful for non-VM86 protected tasks, they can also be enabled separately by setting only bit number 1 (0x2 in value), which is called PVI (Protected Mode Virtual Interrupts). Detecting whether a processor supports VME (including PVI) is done using the CPUID instruction, with an initial EAX value of 0x1, by testing the value of second bit (bit number 1, 0x2 in value) in EDX register, which is set if VME is supported by the processor. In Linux, this latter bit is reported as the flag in the file, under the &quot;flags&quot; section.

In virtual 8086 mode, the basic idea is that when IOPL is less than 3, PUSHF/POPF/STI/CLI/INT/IRET instructions will treat the value of VIF in the real 32-bit EFLAGS register as the value of IF in the simulated 16-bit FLAGS register (32-bit PUSHFD/POPFD continues to GP fault). VIP will cause a GP fault on the setting of simulated IF, directing the OS to process any pending interrupts. PVI is the same idea but only affects CLI/STI instructions.

First generation AMD Ryzen CPUs have been found to feature a broken VME implementation. The second generation Ryzen (2000 series) has fixed this issue.

==64-bit and VMX support==
Virtual 8086 mode is not available in x86-64 long mode, although it is still present on x86-64 capable processors running in legacy mode.

Intel VT-x brings back the ability to run virtual 8086 mode from x86-64 long mode, but it has to be done by transitioning the (physical) processor to VMX root mode and launching a logical (virtual) processor itself running in virtual 8086 mode.

Westmere and later Intel processors usually can start the virtual processor directly in real mode using the &quot;unrestricted guest&quot; feature (which itself requires Extended Page Tables); this method removes the need to resort to the nested virtual 8086 mode simply to run the legacy BIOS for booting.

AMD-V can do virtual 8086 mode in guests, too, but it can also just run the guest in &quot;paged real mode&quot; using the following steps: you create a SVM (Secure Virtual Machine) mode guest with CR0.PE=0, but CR0.PG=1 (that is, with protected mode disabled but paging enabled), which is ordinarily impossible, but is allowed for SVM guests if the host intercepts page faults.
