<text>Permethrin is a medication and an insecticide. As a medication, it is used to treat scabies and lice. It is applied to the skin as a cream or lotion. As an insecticide, it can be sprayed onto outer clothing or mosquito nets to kill the insects that touch them.
Side effects include rash and irritation where it is applied. Use during pregnancy appears to be safe, and it is approved for use on and around people over the age of two months. Permethrin is in the pyrethroid family of medications. It works by disrupting the function of the neurons of lice and scabies mites.
Permethrin was discovered in 1972. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 351st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 40,000 prescriptions.

== Uses ==
=== Insecticide ===
* In agriculture, to protect crops (a drawback is that it is lethal to bees)
* In agriculture, to kill livestock parasites
* For industrial and domestic insect control
* In the textile industry, to prevent insect attack of woollen products
* In aviation, the WHO, IHR and ICAO require arriving aircraft be disinsected prior to embarkation, departure, descent, or deplaning in certain countries. Aircraft disinsection with permethrin-based products is recommended only prior to embarkation. Prior to departure (after boarding), at the top of descent or on arrival, d-phenothrin-based (1R-trans phenothrin) aircraft insecticides are recommended.
=== Insect incapacitation ===
* As a personal protective measure, 0.5% permethrin is applied to outer clothing. It is a cloth impregnant, notably in mosquito nets and field wear. While permethrin may be marketed as an insect repellent, it does not prevent insects from landing. Instead it works by incapacitating or killing insects on contact before they can bite. In 2016, Consumer Reports found that, as consecutive washes reduce permethrin concentration, incapacitation becomes too slow to prevent bites. In these cases, other common topical repellents such as icaridin may be applied to the clothing, though some, such as DEET and IR3535, can damage certain synthetic fabrics.
* In pet flea preventive collars or treatment (safe for use on dogs but not cats)
* In timber treatment

=== Medical use ===

Permethrin is available for topical use as a cream or lotion. It is indicated for the treatment and prevention in exposed individuals of head lice and treatment of scabies.
In general, one treatment is curative. A single application of permethrin is more effective than a single oral dose of ivermectin for scabies. In addition permethrin provides more rapid symptomatic relief than ivermectin. When a second dose of ivermectin is days later, the efficacy between permethrin and ivermectin approach parity. Contact with eyes should be avoided.

==== Mechanism of action ====
Permethrin acts on the nerve cell membrane to disrupt the sodium channel current by which the polarization of the membrane is regulated. Delayed repolarization and paralysis of the pests are the consequences of this disturbance.

=== Pest control / effectiveness and persistence ===
In agriculture, permethrin is mainly used on cotton, wheat, maize, and alfalfa crops. Its use is controversial because, as a broad-spectrum chemical, it kills indiscriminately; as well as the intended pests, it can harm beneficial insects, including honey bees, as well as cats and aquatic life.

Permethrin kills ticks and mosquitoes on contact with treated clothing. A method of reducing deer tick populations by treating rodent vectors involves stuffing biodegradable cardboard tubes with permethrin-treated cotton. Mice collect the cotton for lining their nests. Permethrin on the cotton kills any immature ticks feeding on the mice.

Permethrin is used in tropical areas to prevent mosquito-borne disease such as dengue fever and malaria. Mosquito nets used to cover beds may be treated with a solution of permethrin. This increases the effectiveness of the bed net by killing parasitic insects before they are able to find gaps or holes in the net. Personnel working in malaria-endemic areas may be instructed to treat their clothing with permethrin as well.

Permethrin is the most commonly used insecticide worldwide for the protection of wool from keratinophagous insects such as &quot;Tineola bisselliella&quot;.

To better protect soldiers from the risk and annoyance of biting insects, the British and US armies are treating all new uniforms with permethrin.

Permethrin (as well as other long-term pyrethroids) is effective over several months, in particular when used indoors. International studies report that permethrin can be detected in house dust, in fine dust, and on indoor surfaces even years after the application. Its degradation rate under indoor conditions is approximately 10% after 3 months.

=== Resistance ===
In &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; permethrin resistance is via &quot;knockdown resistance&quot; (kdr) mutations which is common to pyrethroids and DDT. This differs to the most common mechanism of insecticide resistance evolution which is selection for preexisting, low-frequency alleles. García et al. 2009 found that a kdr allele has rapidly spread throughout Mexico and become dominant there.

== Adverse effects ==
Permethrin is moderately toxic if ingested, causing abdominal pain, sore throat, nausea and vomiting. If inhaled, permethrin may cause headache, respiratory irritation, difficulty breathing, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. Inhalation is more likely from aerosols than from vapors from surfaces and clothing, as permethrin has a low vapor pressure and volatilizes slowly.

Topical application of permethrin can cause mild skin irritation, burning and paresthesia. Permethrin has little systemic absorption, and is considered safe for topical use in adults and children over the age of two months. The FDA has assigned it as pregnancy category B. Animal studies have suggested that it may cause endocrine disruption by interfering with estrogenic activity and have shown no effects on fertility or teratogenicity, but studies in humans have not been performed. The excretion of permethrin in breastmilk is unknown, and it is recommended that breastfeeding be temporarily discontinued during treatment. Skin reactions are uncommon.
Excessive exposure to permethrin can cause nausea, headache, muscle weakness, excessive salivation, shortness of breath, and seizures. Worker exposure to the chemical can be monitored by measurement of the urinary metabolites, while severe overdose may be confirmed by measurement of permethrin in serum or blood plasma.

Permethrin does not present any notable genotoxicity or immunotoxicity in humans and farm animals, but is classified by the EPA as a likely human carcinogen when ingested, based on reproducible studies in which mice fed permethrin developed liver and lung tumors. A 2018 review failed to link permethrin exposure in humans to cancer.

== Pharmacokinetics ==

Permethrin is a chemical categorized in the pyrethroid insecticide group. The chemicals in the pyrethroid family are created to emulate the chemicals found in the chrysanthemum flower.

=== Absorption ===
Absorption of topical permethrin is minimal. One &quot;in vivo&quot; study demonstrated 0.5% absorption in the first 48 hours based upon excretion of urinary metabolites.

=== Distribution ===
Distribution of permethrin has been studied in rat models, with highest amounts accumulating in fat and the brain. This can be explained by the lipophilic nature of the permethrin molecule.

=== Metabolism ===
Metabolism of permethrin occurs mainly in the liver, where the molecule undergoes oxidation by the cytochrome P450 system, as well as hydrolysis, into non-toxic metabolites.

=== Excretion ===
The elimination of permethrin and its metabolites occurs mainly through urinary excretion, but also through feces. In rats, the excretion half-life is 12 hours for plasma and 9 to 23 hours for certain nervous tissue.

== Stereochemistry ==
Permethrin has four stereoisomers (two enantiomeric pairs), arising from the two stereocenters in the cyclopropane ring. The &quot;trans&quot; enantiomeric pair is known as transpermethrin. (1&quot;R&quot;,3&quot;S&quot;)-&quot;trans&quot; and (1&quot;R&quot;,3&quot;R&quot;)-&quot;cis&quot; enantiomers are responsible for the insecticidal properties of permethrin.

== Environment ==
Permethrin has a half-life of about 40 days in soil, 1–3 weeks on the surface of plants, over 20 days indoors, and 19–27 hours in the water column. Permethrin-contaminated indoor surfaces can be decontaminated with bleach.

== History ==
In the early 1970s, it was identified that in many pyrethroids, including all natural pyrethrins and some synthetic analogs developed by that time (such as resmethrin), the furan ring, being a probable site for photo-sensitized attack by oxygen, was responsible for their instability in air and light. Hence, a group of agricultural chemists at the Rothamsted Experimental Station led by Michael Elliott tried to substitute the 5-benzyl-3-furylmethyl alcohol with quite a few structurally similar ones. Discovering that an ester of 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol with a slightly modified (chlorine-substituted) analog of the chrysanthemic acid they also found earlier was both photo-stable and very toxic for insects, they filed their patent applications in 1972 and published their results in Nature in 1973.

Numerous synthetic routes exist for the production of the DV-acid ester precursor. The pathway known as the Kuraray Process uses four steps. In general, the final step in the total synthesis of any of the synthetic pyrethroids is a coupling of a DV-acid ester and an alcohol. In the case of permethrin synthesis, the DV-acid cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, 3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethyl-, ethyl ester, is coupled with the alcohol, m-phenoxybenzyl alcohol, through a transesterification reaction with base. Tetraisopropyl titanate or sodium ethylate may be used as the base.

The alcohol precursor may be prepared in three steps. First, m-cresol, chlorobenzene, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and cuprous chloride react to yield m-phenoxytoluene. Second, oxidation of m-phenoxytoluene over selenium dioxide provides m-phenoxybenzaldehyde. Third, a Cannizzaro reaction of the benzaldehyde in formaldehyde and potassium hydroxide affords the m-phenoxybenzyl alcohol.

== Brand names ==
In Nordic countries and North America, a permethrin formulation for lice treatment is marketed under trade name Nix, available over the counter. Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s UK brand Lyclear covers an assortment of different products, mostly non-insecticidal, but a few of which are based on permethrin.

Stronger concentrations of permethrin are used to treat scabies (which embed inside the skin), compared to lice (which remain outside the skin). In the U.S. the more concentrated products such as Elimite are available by prescription only.

==Other animals==
It is known to be highly toxic to cats, fish and aquatic species with long-lasting effects.

=== Cats ===
Permethrin is toxic to cats; however, it has little effect on dogs. Many cats die after being given flea treatments intended for dogs, or by contact with dogs having recently been treated with permethrin. In cats it may induce hyperexcitability, tremors, seizures, and death.

Toxic exposure of permethrin can cause several symptoms, including convulsion, hyperaesthesia, hyperthermia, hypersalivation, and loss of balance and coordination. Exposure to pyrethroid-derived drugs such as permethrin requires treatment by a veterinarian, otherwise the poisoning is often fatal. This intolerance is due to a defect in glucuronosyltransferase, a common detoxification enzyme in other mammals, that also makes the cat intolerant to paracetamol (acetaminophen). Based on those observations, the use of any external parasiticides based on permethrin is contraindicated for cats.

=== Aquatic organisms ===
Permethrin is listed as a &quot;restricted use&quot; substance by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) due to its high toxicity to aquatic organisms, so permethrin and permethrin-contaminated water should be properly disposed of. Permethrin is quite stable, having a half life of 51–71 days in an aqueous environment exposed to light. It is also highly persistent in soil.

<text>Karl Tausig (sometimes &quot;Carl&quot;; born Karol Tausig; 4 November 184117 July 1871) was a Polish virtuoso pianist, arranger and composer. He is generally regarded as Franz Liszt&#x27;s most distinguished pupil and one of the greatest pianists of all time.

==Life==
Tausig was born in Warsaw to Jewish parents and received his first piano lessons from his father, pianist and composer Aloys Tausig (1820–1885), a student of Sigismond Thalberg. His father introduced him to Franz Liszt in Weimar at the age of 14. He quickly became a favorite pupil of Liszt&#x27;s, travelling with him on concert tours and studying counterpoint, composition and orchestration in addition to his piano lessons, and even taking on one of Liszt&#x27;s pupils, Regina Watson, as his own. At the age of 16, he met Richard Wagner, of whom he became a devoted follower and friend. He made piano arrangements of many of Wagner&#x27;s operas. He also introduced to Wagner his friend Peter Cornelius, another Wagner devotee. While he also became a great admirer and friend of the conservative Beethoven follower Johannes Brahms, Tausig became one of the stanchest champions of the &quot;music of the future&quot; and the New Weimar School founded by Liszt. He single-handedly raised the money to build the Bayreuth Theater for performances of Wagner&#x27;s operas.

In 1858, Tausig made his debut in Berlin at a concert conducted by Hans von Bülow. While some critics admired his technical feats at the keyboard, others found his playing noisy and overbearing. Even some who were more accommodating of Tausig&#x27;s &quot;Lisztian eccentricities&quot; felt he would play better as he matured. Tausig toured through various German towns in 1859–60, making Dresden his base. He moved to Vienna in 1862; there he gave concerts of modern orchestral music, including some of his own symphonic poems. These concerts were only partially successful artistically and a failure financially.

After staying out of public view for a few years, in 1864 he married pianist Seraphine von Vrabely (1841–1931), but divorced her soon after. The following year he had settled in Berlin and resumed concertizing. In 1866 with two others he opened a school for virtuoso pianists &quot;Schule des Höheren Klavierspiels&quot;, known as the &quot;Virtuosenakademie&quot;, teaching there and occasionally giving recitals. Some of his students were Rafael Joseffy, Alexander Michalowski, Andrey Schulz-Evler, Sophie Menter, Vera Timanoff, Amy Fay, and Gustav V. Lewinsky. Eventually, Tausig&#x27;s busy tour schedule of concerts and recitals took up most of his time away from the school, and the school closed in October 1870.

He made several concert tours in Germany and Russia, and throughout Europe, and was now considered a pianist of breadth and dignity of style. However, the strain of travelling weakened his health. In June 1871 toward the end of his life, too weak to concertize, he was cared for by his longtime friend, Marie von Mouchanoff-Kalergis, a pianist who in her youth had been a pupil of Chopin, and to whom Tausig had dedicated his first composition, an Impromptu. He died in Leipzig in July from typhoid at the age of 29.

His grave is preserved in the Protestant &quot;Friedhof III der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde&quot; (Cemetery No. III of the congregations of Jerusalem&#x27;s Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor. Wagner wrote the epitaph inscribed on Tausig&#x27;s tombstone.

==Pianism==
Tausig was considered by some critics to be the greatest of Liszt&#x27;s pupils and to carry pure piano virtuosity to heights only suggested by Liszt. The master said he had &quot;fingers of steel&quot;. Anton Rubinstein called him &quot;the infallible.&quot; Where Tausig differed from his teacher was in his lack of flamboyant gestures while playing. Tausig sat motionless at the piano and abhorred what he called &quot;Spektakel&quot;. While his fingers were working miracles at the keyboard without any digital errors, the only sign of tension from Tausig would be a slight tightening of one corner of his mouth.

Until his early death, some critics surmise that Tausig may not have had a pianistic equal, combining Liszt&#x27;s force and range of tone color with the intellectuality of his fellow pupil Hans von Bülow. Another Liszt pupil, Eugen d&#x27;Albert, compared Tausig very favorably with their teacher. He said that while Liszt&#x27;s musical conceptions were grander, Tausig possessed a better and more accurate technique coupled with a good deal of poetry.

==Repertory==
Tausig&#x27;s repertory was extensive; he could play from memory works ranging from Scarlatti to Liszt. He was especially noted for his interpretations of Chopin, Weber and Beethoven, both for pianistic finish and intensity of emotion.

==Works==

As well as entirely original works, Tausig arranged for piano the music of a number of composers, as well as a pedagogic work for teaching and practice.

In the following list, lost works are included, mostly original compositions, but a few transcriptions as well. Many of these, including several orchestral works, were given their first public performances by Tausig at the piano or conducting. With the exception of &quot;Das Geisterschiff&quot;, the orchestral scores have not been located since. All of these are unpublished, except for a couple compositions where no printed copies can be found and the original engravings were destroyed.

Some compositions are unfinished in existing manuscripts, left incomplete by Tausig for reasons unknown, most particularly a number of the transcriptions of Liszt&#x27;s symphonic poems. Where possible, details of the state of the manuscript are given.

All works listed are for piano solo unless indicated otherwise.

* &quot;&quot;Morgenblätter&quot;, Walzer von J. Strauss Op. 279 – Paraphrasiert für den Concert Vortrag von Karl Tausig – Oeuvre Posthume&quot; [published c1878; actually composed by American pianist Julie Rivé-King (1854-1937)]
* &quot;&quot;Kiss Waltz&quot;, Walzer von J. Strauss&quot; [recorded by both Mark Hambourg and Benno Moiseiwitsch; actually composed by Russian composer and pianist Eduard Schütt (1856-1933) as &quot;Concert Paraphrases on J. Strauss&#x27; Waltz Motives&quot;]
* &quot;Préludes&quot; nos. 7-10 from the 1880 American revised edition of Tausig&#x27;s &quot;Daily Exercises&quot;, which edition added more exercises by Heinrich Ehrlich. Of the &quot;10 Preludes&quot; presented, the last four are actually by Ehrlich. Tausig wrote only the first six, which he called &quot;6 Exercise Pieces&quot;, not &quot;Preludes&quot;, though they are often still called Preludes. [see Mature Works section]

==Recordings==

Michael Ponti was the first to record an all-Tausig album, in 1976 on the Candide LP label. It contained the Two Concert Etudes, The Ghost Ship, Hope, One Lives Only Once (Caprice Waltz #2), Hungarian Gypsy Airs, Caprice Waltz #4, and the Halka Fantasy. Ponti later recorded 3 of Tausig&#x27;s Wagner arrangements: the 2 from Valkyre, and Brangäneus&#x27; Song from Tristan. Another album of all Tausig newly recorded in 1980 and released on the Wifon label (available on cassette) contained all the pieces that were on the earlier Candide album except for the two Caprice Waltzes, but also added the Reverie op. 5.

Beginning in 1989, Dennis Hennig released three all-Tausig albums for the Etcetera label. All five of the Valse-Caprices and three of the Schubert transcriptions (omitting the Andantino Variations). An album of some of Tausig&#x27;s Wagner transcriptions: the 3 Tristan paraphrases, the 2 from Valkyre, including the four-hand version of Ride of the Valkyres, and the Kaiser March. Four of Tausig&#x27;s transcriptions of Liszt symphonic poems: no. 3 Les Preludes, and nos. 2, 4, and 10 all previously unpublished.

Orazio Sciortino made an album of Wagner transcriptions as well in 2013: the 3 Tristan, 2 Valkyre, and the 2 Meistersinger arrangements.

Artur Cimirro recorded Tausig&#x27;s complete extant original piano works for the Acte Préalable CD label in 2016. The pianist had intentions of recording all the extant transcriptions and arrangements, as well as conducting the premiere of the orchestral version of The Ghost Ship, but these recordings have not materialized.

Many other modern-day pianists have recorded Tausig compositions, such as Rian de Waal, Carlo Lombardi, Giulio Draghi, Stephen Hough, and Menachem Har-Zahav. There are several recordings of Tausig&#x27;s piano music on YouTube. Setrak Setrakian has recorded the rare Chopin E minor concerto transcription.

Historically, Tausig&#x27;s arrangement of Strauss&#x27;s waltz &quot;You Only Live Once!&quot; was recorded by Sergei Rachmaninov and Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Rachmaninov also made recordings of Tausig&#x27;s transcription of Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Der Kontrabandiste&quot; (also recorded by Josef Lhévinne, Josef Hofmann, Emil Gilels, and many others) and Tausig&#x27;s Pastorale in E minor, adaptated from Scarlatti&#x27;s harpsichord Sonata, L. 413, the latter also being popular with several other pianists of that era, including Vladimir Horowitz. The Bach Toccata and Fugue in D minor adaptation and the Schubert/Tausig &quot;Marche Militaire&quot; were also quite popular in recordings, the latter being recorded by Eugen d&#x27;Albert, Leopold Godowsky, Mischa Levitzki, Lhévinne, Ignaz Friedman, Egon Petri, Wilhelm Backhaus, Alexander Brailowsky, Horowitz, and György Cziffra. Most of those pianists recorded other Tausig works as well, such as Lhévinne&#x27;s rare recording of the Hungarian Gypsy Dances. Benno Moiseiwitsch recorded Tausig&#x27;s piano arrangement of Weber&#x27;s orchestral Invitation to the Dance. Winifred Christie even recorded the Bach Toccata and Fugue in D minor adaptation on her husband&#x27;s invention, the Moór-Duplex piano.

<doc id="656948" wikidata="Q379887" url="?curid=656948" title="Olaudah Equiano">
<text>Olaudah Equiano (; c. 1745 – 31 March 1797), known for most of his life as Gustavus Vassa (), was a writer and abolitionist. According to his memoir, he was from the village of Essaka in present day southern Nigeria. Enslaved as a child in West Africa, he was shipped to the Caribbean and sold to a Royal Navy officer. He was sold twice more before purchasing his freedom in 1766.

As a freedman in London, Equiano supported the British abolitionist movement, in the 1780s becoming one of its leading figures. Equiano was part of the abolitionist group the Sons of Africa, whose members were Africans living in Britain. His 1789 autobiography, &quot;The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano&quot;, sold so well that nine editions were published during his life and helped secure passage of the British Slave Trade Act 1807, which abolished the slave trade. &quot;The Interesting Narrative&quot; gained renewed popularity among scholars in the late 20th century and remains a useful primary source.

== Early life and enslavement ==
According to his 1789 memoir, Equiano was born around 1745 in the Igbo village of Essaka in what is now southern Nigeria. He claimed his home was part of the Kingdom of Benin.

Equiano recounted an incident of an attempted kidnapping of children in his Igbo village, which was foiled by adults. When he was around the age of eleven, he and his sister were left alone to look after their family premises, as was common when adults went out of the house to work. They were kidnapped and taken far from their home, separated and sold to slave traders. He tried to escape but was thwarted. After his owners changed several times, Equiano happened to meet with his sister but they were separated again. Six or seven months after he had been kidnapped, he arrived at the coast where he was taken on board a European slave ship. He was transported with 244 other enslaved Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to Barbados in the British West Indies. He and a few other slaves were sent on for sale in the Colony of Virginia.

Literary scholar Vincent Carretta argued in his 2005 biography of Equiano that the activist could have been born in colonial South Carolina rather than Africa, based on a 1759 parish baptismal record that lists Equiano&#x27;s place of birth as Carolina and a 1773 ship&#x27;s muster that indicates South Carolina. Carretta&#x27;s conclusion is disputed by other scholars who believe the weight of evidence supports Equiano&#x27;s account of coming from Africa.

In Virginia, Equiano was bought by Michael Henry Pascal, a lieutenant in the Royal Navy. Pascal renamed the boy &quot;Gustavus Vassa&quot;, after the 16th-century King of Sweden Gustav Vasa who began the Protestant Reformation in Sweden. Equiano had already been renamed twice: he was called Michael while on board the slave ship that brought him to the Americas, and Jacob by his first owner. This time, Equiano refused and told his new owner that he would prefer to be called Jacob. His refusal, he says, &quot;gained me many a cuff&quot; and eventually he submitted to the new name. He used this name for the rest of his life, including on all official records; he only used Equiano in his autobiography.

Pascal took Equiano with him when he returned to England and had him accompany him as a valet during the Seven Years&#x27; War with France (1756–1763). Equiano gives witness reports of the Siege of Louisbourg (1758), the Battle of Lagos (1759) and the Capture of Belle Île (1761). Also trained in seamanship, Equiano was expected to assist the ship&#x27;s crew in times of battle; his duty was to haul gunpowder to the gun decks. Pascal favoured Equiano and sent him to his sister-in-law in Great Britain so that he could attend school and learn to read and write.

Equiano converted to Christianity and was baptised at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, on 9 February 1759, when he was described in the parish register as &quot;a Black, born in Carolina, 12 years old&quot;. His godparents were Mary Guerin and her brother, Maynard, who were cousins of his master Pascal. They had taken an interest in him and helped him to learn English. Later, when Equiano&#x27;s origins were questioned after his book was published, the Guerins testified to his lack of English when he first came to London.

In December 1762, Pascal sold Equiano to Captain James Doran of the &quot;Charming Sally&quot; at Gravesend, from where he was transported back to the Caribbean, to Montserrat, in the Leeward Islands. There, he was sold to Robert King, an American Quaker merchant from Philadelphia who traded in the Caribbean.

== Release ==

Robert King forced Equiano to work on his shipping routes and in his stores. In 1765, when Equiano was about 20 years old, King promised that for his purchase price of 40 pounds () he could buy his freedom. King taught him to read and write more fluently, guided him along the path of religion, and allowed Equiano to engage in profitable trading for his own account, as well as on his owner&#x27;s behalf. Equiano sold fruits, glass tumblers and other items between Georgia and the Caribbean islands. King allowed Equiano to buy his freedom, which he achieved in 1766. The merchant urged Equiano to stay on as a business partner. However, Equiano found it dangerous and limiting to remain in the British colonies as a freedman. While loading a ship in Georgia, he was almost kidnapped back into enslavement.

== Freedom ==
By about 1768, Equiano had gone to Britain. He continued to work at sea, travelling sometimes as a deckhand based in England. In 1773 on the Royal Navy ship HMS &quot;Racehorse&quot;, he travelled to the Arctic in an expedition towards the North Pole. On that voyage he worked with Dr Charles Irving, who had developed a process to distill seawater and later made a fortune from it. Two years later, Irving recruited Equiano for a project on the Mosquito Coast in Central America, where he was to use his African background to help select slaves and manage them as labourers on sugar-cane plantations. Irving and Equiano had a working relationship and friendship for more than a decade, but the plantation venture failed. Equiano met with George, the &quot;Musquito king&#x27;s son&quot;.

Equiano left the Mosquito Coast in 1776 and arrived at Plymouth, England, on 7 January 1777.

== Pioneer of the abolitionist cause ==
Equiano settled in London, where in the 1780s he became involved in the abolitionist movement. The movement to end the slave trade had been particularly strong among Quakers, but the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade was founded in 1787 as a non-denominational group, with Anglican members, in an attempt to influence parliament directly. Under the Test Act, only those prepared to receive the sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper according to the rites of the Church of England were permitted to serve as MPs. Equiano had been influenced by George Whitefield&#x27;s evangelism.

As early as 1783, Equiano informed abolitionists such as Granville Sharp about the slave trade; that year he was the first to tell Sharp about the &quot;Zong&quot; massacre, which was being tried in London as litigation for insurance claims. It became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; for the abolitionist movement and contributed to its growth.

On 21 October 1785 he was one of eight delegates from Africans in America to present an &#x27;Address of Thanks&#x27; to the Quakers at a meeting in Gracechurch Street, London. The address referred to &quot;A Caution to Great Britain and her Colonies&quot; by Anthony Benezet, founder of the Society for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage.

Equiano was befriended and supported by abolitionists, many of whom encouraged him to write and publish his life story. He was supported financially in this effort by philanthropic abolitionists and religious benefactors. His lectures and preparation for the book were promoted by, among others, Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon.

== Memoir ==

Entitled &quot;The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African&quot; (1789), the book went through nine editions in his lifetime, with translations into Russian, German and Dutch. It is one of the earliest-known examples of published writing by an African writer to be widely read in England. By 1792, it was a best seller and had been published in Russia, Germany, Holland and the United States. It was the first influential slave narrative of what became a large literary genre. But Equiano&#x27;s experience in slavery was quite different from that of most slaves; he did not participate in field work, he served his owners personally and went to sea, was taught to read and write, and worked in trading.

Equiano&#x27;s personal account of slavery, his journey of advancement, and his experiences as a black immigrant caused a sensation on publication. The book fuelled a growing anti-slavery movement in Great Britain, Europe and the New World. His account surprised many with the quality of its imagery, description and literary style.

In his account, Equiano gives details about his hometown and the laws and customs of the Eboe people. After being captured as a boy, he described communities he passed through as a captive on his way to the coast. His biography details his voyage on a slave ship and the brutality of slavery in the colonies of the West Indies, Virginia and Georgia.

Equiano commented on the reduced rights that freed people of colour had in these same places, and they also faced risks of kidnapping and enslavement. Equiano embraced Christianity at the age of 14 and its importance to him is a recurring theme in his autobiography. He was baptised into the Church of England in 1759; he described himself in his autobiography as a &quot;protestant of the church of England&quot; but also flirted with Methodism.

Several events in Equiano&#x27;s life led him to question his faith. He was distressed in 1774 by the kidnapping of his friend, a black cook named John Annis. Annis and his former enslaver, William Kirkpatrick, had initially &quot;parted by consent&quot; but Kirkpatrick reneged, seeking to kidnap and re-enslave Annis. Kirkpatrick was ultimately successful, forcibly removing Annis from the British ship &quot;Anglicania&quot; where both he and Equiano served. This was in violation of the decision in the Somersett Case (1772), that slaves could not be taken from England without their permission, as common law did not support the institution in England &amp; Wales. Kirkpatrick had Annis transported to Saint Kitts, where he was punished severely and worked as a plantation labourer until he died. With the aid of Granville Sharp, Equiano tried to get Annis released before he was shipped from England but was unsuccessful. He heard that Annis was not free from suffering until he died in slavery. Despite his questioning, he affirms his faith in Christianity, as seen in the penultimate sentence of his work that quotes the prophet Micah (): &quot;After all, what makes any event important, unless by its observation we become better and wiser, and learn &#x27;to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly before God?

In his account, Equiano also told of his settling in London. He married an English woman and lived with her in Soham, Cambridgeshire, where they had two daughters. He became a leading abolitionist in the 1780s, lecturing in numerous cities against the slave trade. Equiano records his and Granville Sharp&#x27;s central roles in the anti-slave trade movement, and their effort to publicise the &quot;Zong&quot; massacre, which became known in 1783.

Reviewers have found that his book demonstrated the full and complex humanity of Africans as much as the inhumanity of slavery. The book was considered an exemplary work of English literature by a new African author. Equiano did so well in sales that he achieved independence from his benefactors. He travelled throughout England, Scotland and Ireland promoting the book, spending eight months in Ireland alone between 1792 and 1793. He worked to improve economic, social and educational conditions in Africa. Specifically, he became involved in working in Sierra Leone, a colony founded in 1792 for freed slaves by Britain in West Africa.

== Later years, radical connections ==
During the American Revolutionary War, Britain had recruited black people to fight with it by offering freedom to those who left rebel masters. In practice, it also freed women and children, and attracted thousands of slaves to its lines in New York City, which it occupied, and in the South, where its troops occupied Charleston, South Carolina. When British troops were evacuated at the end of the war, their officers also evacuated these former American slaves. They were resettled in the Caribbean, in Nova Scotia, in Sierra Leone in Africa, and in London. Britain refused to return the slaves, which the United States sought in peace negotiations.

In 1783, following the United States&#x27; gaining independence, Equiano became involved in helping the Black Poor of London, who were mostly those former African-American slaves freed during and after the American Revolution by the British. There were also some freed slaves from the Caribbean, and some who had been brought by their owners to England and freed later after the decision that Britain had no basis in common law for slavery. The black community numbered about 20,000. After the Revolution some 3,000 former slaves had been transported from New York to Nova Scotia, where they became known as Black Loyalists, among other Loyalists also resettled there. Many of the freedmen found it difficult to make new lives in London or Canada.

Equiano was appointed &quot;Commissary of Provisions and Stores for the Black Poor going to Sierra Leone&quot; in November 1786. This was an expedition to resettle London&#x27;s Black Poor in Freetown, a new British colony founded on the west coast of Africa, in present-day Sierra Leone. The blacks from London were joined by more than 1,200 Black Loyalists who chose to leave Nova Scotia. They were aided by John Clarkson, younger brother of abolitionist Thomas Clarkson. Jamaican maroons, as well as slaves liberated from illegal slave-trading ships after Britain abolished the slave trade, also settled at Freetown in the early decades. Equiano was dismissed from the new settlement after protesting against financial mismanagement and he returned to London.

Equiano was a prominent figure in London and often served as a spokesman for the black community. He was one of the leading members of the Sons of Africa, a small abolitionist group composed of free Africans in London. They were closely allied with the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. Equiano&#x27;s comments on issues were published in newspapers such as the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot; and the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot;. He replied to James Tobin in 1788, in the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot;, attacking two of his pamphlets and a related book from 1786 by Gordon Turnbull. Equiano had more of a public voice than most Africans or Black Loyalists and he seized various opportunities to use it.

Equiano was an active member of the radical working-class London Corresponding Society (LCS), which campaigned for democratic reform. In 1791–92, touring the British Isles with his autobiography and drawing on abolitionist networks he brokered connections for the LCS, including what may have been the Society&#x27;s first contacts with the United Irishmen. In Belfast, where his appearance in May 1791 was celebrated by abolitionists who five years previously had defeated plans to commission vessels in the port for the Middle Passage, Equiano was hosted by the leading United Irishman, publisher of their Painite newspaper the &quot;Northern Star&quot;, Samuel Neilson. Following the onset of war with revolutionary France, leading members of the LCS, including Thomas Hardy with whom Equiano lodged in 1792, were charged with treason, and in 1799, following evidence of communication between leading members and the insurrectionary United Irishmen, the society was suppressed.

== Marriage and family ==

On 7 April 1792, Equiano married Susannah Cullen, a local woman, in St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Soham, Cambridgeshire. The original marriage register containing the entry for Vassa and Cullen is held today by the Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies. He included his marriage in every edition of his autobiography from 1792 onwards. The couple settled in the area and had two daughters, Anna Maria (1793–1797) and Joanna (1795–1857), who were baptised at Soham church.

Susannah died in February 1796, aged 34, and Equiano died a year later, on 31 March 1797. Soon afterwards, Anna died at the age of four, leaving Joanna to inherit Equiano&#x27;s estate when she was 21 years old; it was then valued at £950 (). Anna Maria is commemorated by a plaque at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Chesterton, Cambridge. Joanna Vassa married the Reverend Henry Bromley, a Congregationalist minister, in 1821. They are both buried at the non-denominational Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington, London; the Bromleys&#x27; monument is now a Grade II listed building.

== Last days and will ==
Equiano drew up his will on 28 May 1796. At the time he was living at the Plaisterers&#x27; Hall, then on Addle Street, in Aldermanbury in the City of London. He moved to John Street (now Whitfield Street), close to Whitefield&#x27;s Tabernacle, Tottenham Court Road. At his death on 31 March 1797, he was living in Paddington Street, Westminster. Equiano&#x27;s death was reported in American as well as British newspapers.

Equiano was buried at Whitefield&#x27;s Tabernacle on 6 April. The entry in the register reads &quot;Gustus Vasa, 52 years, St Mary Le bone&quot;. His burial place has been lost. The small burial ground lay on either side of the chapel and is now Whitfield Gardens. The site of the chapel is now the American International Church.

Equiano&#x27;s will, in the event of his daughters&#x27; deaths before reaching the age of 21, bequeathed half his wealth to the Sierra Leone Company for a school in Sierra Leone, and half to the London Missionary Society.

== Controversy related to memoir ==
Following publication in 1967 of a newly edited version of his memoir by Paul Edwards, interest in Equiano revived. Scholars from Nigeria have also begun studying him. For example, O. S. Ogede identifies Equiano as a pioneer in asserting &quot;the dignity of African life in the white society of his time&quot;.

In researching his life, some scholars since the late 20th century have disputed Equiano&#x27;s account of his origins. In 1999 while editing a new version of Equiano&#x27;s memoir, Vincent Carretta, a professor of English at the University of Maryland, found two records that led him to question the former slave&#x27;s account of being born in Africa. He first published his findings in the journal &quot;Slavery and Abolition&quot;. At a 2003 conference in England, Carretta defended himself against Nigerian academics, like Obiwu, who accused him of &quot;pseudo-detective work&quot; and indulging &quot;in vast publicity gamesmanship&quot;. In his 2005 biography, Carretta suggested that Equiano may have been born in South Carolina rather than Africa, as he was twice recorded from there. Carretta wrote:

Equiano was certainly African by descent. The circumstantial evidence that Equiano was also African-American by birth and African-British by choice is compelling but not absolutely conclusive. Although the circumstantial evidence is not equivalent to proof, anyone dealing with Equiano&#x27;s life and art must consider it.

According to Carretta, Equiano/Vassa&#x27;s baptismal record and a naval muster roll document him as from South Carolina. Carretta interpreted these anomalies as possible evidence that Equiano had made up the account of his African origins, and adopted material from others. But Paul Lovejoy, Alexander X. Byrd and Douglas Chambers note how many general and specific details Carretta can document from sources that related to the slave trade in the 1750s as described by Equiano, including the voyages from Africa to Virginia, sale to Pascal in 1754, and others. They conclude he was more likely telling what he understood as fact, rather than creating a fictional account; his work is shaped as an autobiography.

Lovejoy wrote that:

circumstantial evidence indicates that he was born where he said he was, and that, in fact, &quot;The Interesting Narrative&quot; is reasonably accurate in its details, although, of course, subject to the same criticisms of selectivity and self-interested distortion that characterize the genre of autobiography.

Lovejoy uses the name of Vassa in his article, since that was what the man used throughout his life, in &quot;his baptism, his naval records, marriage certificate and will&quot;. He emphasises that Vassa only used his African name in his autobiography.

Other historians also argue that the fact that many parts of Equiano&#x27;s account can be proven lends weight to accepting his account of African birth. As historian Adam Hochschild has written:

In the long and fascinating history of autobiographies that distort or exaggerate the truth. ... Seldom is one crucial portion of a memoir totally fabricated and the remainder scrupulously accurate; among autobiographers ... both dissemblers and truth-tellers tend to be consistent.

He also noted that &quot;since the &#x27;rediscovery&#x27; of Vassa&#x27;s account in the 1960s, scholars have valued it as the most extensive account of an eighteenth-century slave&#x27;s life and the difficult passage from slavery to freedom&quot;.

== Legacy ==
* The Equiano Society was formed in London in November 1996. Its main objective is to publicise and celebrate the life and work of Olaudah Equiano.
* In 1789 Equiano moved to 10 Union Street (now 73 Riding House Street). A City of Westminster commemorative green plaque was unveiled there on 11 October 2000 as part of Black History Month. Student musicians from Trinity College of Music played a fanfare composed by Professor Ian Hall for the unveiling.
* Equiano is honoured in the Church of England and remembered in its Calendar of saints with a Lesser Festival on 30 July, along with Thomas Clarkson and William Wilberforce who worked for abolition of the slave trade and slavery.
* In 2007, the year of the celebration in Britain of the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade, Equiano&#x27;s life and achievements were included in the National Curriculum, together with William Wilberforce. In December 2012 &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; claimed that both would be dropped from the curriculum, a claim which itself became subject to controversy. In January 2013 Operation Black Vote launched a petition to request Education Secretary Michael Gove to keep both Equiano and Mary Seacole in the National Curriculum. American Rev. Jesse Jackson and others wrote a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; protesting against the mooted removal of both figures from the National Curriculum.
* A statue of Equiano, made by pupils of Edmund Waller School, was erected in Telegraph Hill Lower Park, New Cross, London, in 2008.
* The head of Equiano is included in Martin Bond&#x27;s 1997 sculpture &quot;Wall of the Ancestors&quot; in Deptford, London
* Author Ann Cameron adapted Equiano&#x27;s autobiography for children, leaving most of the text in Equiano&#x27;s own words; the book was published in 1995 in the U.S. by Random House as &quot;The Kidnapped Prince: The Life of Olaudah Equiano&quot;, with an introduction by historian Henry Louis Gates Jr.
* On 16 October 2017, Google Doodle honoured Equiano by celebrating the 272nd year since his birth.
* A crater on Mercury was named &quot;Equiano&quot; in 1976.
* The exoplanet HD 43197 b was officially named Equiano in 2019 as part of NameExoWorlds.
* In 2019, Google Cloud named a subsea cable running from Portugal through the West Coast of Africa and terminating in South Africa after Equiano.
* In 2022, the city of Cambridge honoured Equiano by renaming Riverside Bridge to Equiano Bridge.
* In 2025, Equiano featured in &quot;Rise Up: Resistance, Revolution, Abolition&quot; at the Fitzwilliam Museum of Cambridge University an exhibition focused on individuals whose contributions were vital to British abolition such as often-forgotten Black Georgians.
* In 2025, Equiano was one of five individuals celebrated in LGBTQ+ history month.

=== Representation in other media ===
* The Gambian actor Louis Mahoney played Equiano in the BBC television mini-series &quot;The Fight Against Slavery&quot; (1975).
* A 28-minute documentary, &quot;Son of Africa: The Slave Narrative of Olaudah Equiano&quot; (1996), produced by the BBC and directed by Alrick Riley, uses dramatic reconstruction, archival material and interviews to provide the social and economic context for his life and the slave trade.

Numerous works about Equiano have been produced for and since the 2007 bicentenary of Britain&#x27;s abolition of the slave trade:
* Equiano was portrayed by the Senegalese musician Youssou N&#x27;Dour in the film &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; (2006).
* &quot;African Snow&quot; (2007), a play by Murray Watts, takes place in the mind of John Newton, a captain in the slave trade who later became an Anglican cleric and hymnwriter. It was first produced at the York Theatre Royal as a co-production with Riding Lights Theatre Company, transferring to the Trafalgar Studios in London&#x27;s West End and a national tour. Newton was played by Roger Alborough and Equiano by Israel Oyelumade.
* Kent historian Dr Robert Hume wrote a children&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Equiano: The Slave with the Loud Voice&quot; (2007), illustrated by Cheryl Ives.

<text>Women&#x27;s health differs from that of men&#x27;s health in many unique ways. Women&#x27;s health is an example of population health, where health is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as &quot;a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity&quot;. Often treated as simply women&#x27;s reproductive health, many groups argue for a broader definition pertaining to the overall health of women, better expressed as &quot;The health of women&quot;. These differences are further exacerbated in developing countries where women, whose health includes both their risks and experiences, are further disadvantaged.

While the rates of the leading causes of death, cardiovascular disease, cancer and lung disease, are similar in women and men, women have different experiences. Lung cancer has overtaken all other types of cancer as the leading cause of cancer related death in women, followed by breast cancer, colorectal, ovarian, uterine and cervical cancers. While smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, amongst nonsmoking women the risk of developing cancer is three times greater than among nonsmoking men. Despite this, breast cancer remains the most common cancer in women in developed countries, and is one of the major chronic diseases of women, while cervical cancer remains one of the most common cancers in developing countries, associated with human papilloma virus (HPV), a sexually transmitted infection. HPV vaccine together with screening offers the promise of controlling these diseases. Other important health issues for women include cardiovascular disease, depression, dementia, osteoporosis and anemia.

In 176 out of 178 countries for which records are available, there is a gender gap in favor of women in life expectancy. In Western Europe, this has been the case at least as far back as 1750. Gender remains an important social determinant of health, since women&#x27;s health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty, employment, and family responsibilities. Women have long been disadvantaged in many respects such as social and economic power which restricts their access to the necessities of life including health care, and the greater the level of disadvantage, such as in developing countries, the greater adverse impact on health.

Women&#x27;s reproductive and sexual health has a distinct difference compared to men&#x27;s health. Even in developed countries, pregnancy and childbirth are associated with substantial risks to women with maternal mortality accounting for more than a quarter of a million deaths per year, with large gaps between the developing and developed countries. Comorbidity from other non-reproductive diseases such as cardiovascular disease contribute to both the mortality and morbidity of pregnancy, including preeclampsia. Sexually transmitted infections have serious consequences for women and infants, with mother-to-child transmission leading to outcomes such as stillbirths and neonatal deaths, and pelvic inflammatory disease leading to infertility. In addition, infertility from many other causes, birth control, unplanned pregnancy, rape and the struggle for access to abortion create other burdens for women.

== Definitions and scope ==
Women&#x27;s experience of health and disease differ from those of men, due to unique biological, social and behavioral conditions. Biological differences vary from phenotypes to the cellular biology, and manifest unique risks for the development of ill health. WHO defines health as &quot;a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity&quot;. Women&#x27;s health is an example of population health, the health of a specific defined population.

Women&#x27;s health has been described as &quot;a patchwork quilt with gaps&quot;. Although many of the issues around women&#x27;s health relate to their reproductive health, including maternal and child health, genital health and breast health, and endocrine (hormonal) health, including menstruation, birth control and menopause, a broader understanding of women&#x27;s health to include all aspects of the health of women has been urged, replacing &quot;Women&#x27;s Health&quot; with &quot;The Health of Women&quot;. WHO considers that an undue emphasis on reproductive health has been a major barrier to ensuring access to good quality health care for all women. Conditions that affect both men and women, such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, also manifest differently in women. Women&#x27;s health issues also include medical situations in which women face problems not directly related to their biology, such as gender-differentiated access to medical treatment and other socioeconomic factors. Women&#x27;s health is of particular concern due to widespread discrimination against women in the world, leaving them disadvantaged.

A number of health and medical research advocates, such as the Society for Women&#x27;s Health Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences between women and men exist. Women also need health care more and access the health care system more than do men. While part of this is due to their reproductive and sexual health needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive health issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and osteoporosis. Another important perspective is realising that events across the entire life cycle (or life-course), from &quot;in utero&quot; to aging effect the growth, development and health of women. The life course perspective is one of the key strategies of the World Health Organization.

=== Global perspective ===

Gender differences in susceptibility and symptoms of disease and response to treatment in many areas of health are particularly true when viewed from a global perspective. Much of the available information comes from developed countries, yet there are marked differences between developed and developing countries in terms of women&#x27;s roles and health. The global viewpoint is defined as the &quot;area for study, research and practice that places a priority on improving health and achieving health equity for all people worldwide&quot;. In 2015 the World Health Organization identified the top ten issues in women&#x27;s health as being cancer, reproductive health, maternal health, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), sexually transmitted infections, violence, mental health, non communicable diseases, youth and aging.

== Life expectancy ==

Women&#x27;s life expectancy is greater than that of men, and they have lower death rates throughout life, regardless of race and geographic region. Historically though, women had higher rates of mortality, primarily from maternal deaths (death in childbirth). In industrialised countries, particularly the most advanced, the gender gap narrowed and was reversed following the Industrial Revolution.
 Despite these differences, in many areas of health, women experience earlier and more severe disease, and experience poorer outcomes.

Despite these differences, the leading causes of death in the United States are remarkably similar for men and women, headed by heart disease, which accounts for a quarter of all deaths, followed by cancer, lung disease and stroke. While women have a lower incidence of death from unintentional injury and suicide, they have a higher incidence of dementia.

The major differences in life expectancy for women between developed and developing countries lie in the childbearing years. If a woman survives this period, the differences between the two regions become less marked, since in later life non-communicable diseases (NCDs) become the major causes of death in women throughout the world, with cardiovascular deaths accounting for 45% of deaths in older women, followed by cancer (15%) and lung disease (10%). These create additional burdens on the resources of developing countries. Changing lifestyles, including diet, physical activity and cultural factors that favour larger body size in women, are contributing to an increasing problem with obesity and diabetes amongst women in these countries and increasing the risks of cardiovascular disease and other NCDs.

Women who are socially marginalised are more likely to die at younger ages than women who are not. Women who have substance abuse disorders, who are homeless, who are sex workers, and/or who are imprisoned have significantly shorter lives than other women. At any given age, women in these overlapping, stigmatised groups are approximately 10 to 13 times more likely to die than typical women of the same age.

== Social and cultural factors ==
Women&#x27;s health is positioned within a wider body of knowledge cited by, amongst others, the World Health Organization, which places importance on gender as a social determinant of health. While women&#x27;s health is affected by their biology, it is also affected by their social conditions, such as poverty, employment, and family responsibilities, and these aspects should not be overshadowed.

Women have traditionally been disadvantaged in terms of economic and social status and power, which in turn reduces their access to the necessities of life including health care. Despite recent improvements in Western nations, women remain disadvantaged with respect to men. The gender gap in health is even more acute in developing countries where women are relatively more disadvantaged. In addition to gender inequity, there remain specific disease processes uniquely associated with being a woman which create specific challenges in both prevention and health care.

In low- and middle-income countries, women’s diets, often rich in staple foods, are frequently poor in vitamins and minerals, with consequences for health. Low dietary diversity jeopardizes nutrient adequacy.

Deeply ingrained cultural, religious, and patriarchal systems within the MENA region perpetuate gender-based power dynamics within communities and lead to discrepancies in healthcare access. In a speech, UNFPA executive director Thoraya Ahmed Obaid outlined these difficulties and emphasized the need to change cultural and societal norms in order to improve the health of women in the area.

Even after succeeding in accessing health care, women have been discriminated against, a process that Iris Young has called &quot;internal exclusion&quot;, as opposed to &quot;external exclusion&quot;, the barriers to access. This invisibility effectively masks the grievances of groups already disadvantaged by power inequity, further entrenching injustice.

Behavioral differences also play a role, in which women display lower risk taking including consume less tobacco, alcohol, and drugs, reducing their risk of mortality from associated diseases, including lung cancer, tuberculosis and cirrhosis. Other risk factors that are lower for women include motor vehicle accidents. Occupational differences have exposed women to less industrial injuries, although this is likely to change, as is risk of injury or death in war. Overall such injuries contributed to 3.5% of deaths in women compared to 6.2% in the United States in 2009. Suicide rates are also less in women.

The social view of health combined with the acknowledgement that gender is a social determinant of health inform women&#x27;s health service delivery in countries around the world. Women&#x27;s health services such as Leichhardt Women&#x27;s Community Health Centre which was established in 1974 and was the first women&#x27;s health centre established in Australia is an example of women&#x27;s health approach to service delivery.

Women&#x27;s health is an issue which has been taken up by many feminists, especially where reproductive health is concerned and the international women&#x27;s movement was responsible for much of the adoption of agendas to improve women&#x27;s health.

== Biological factors ==

Factors that specifically affect the health of women compared to men are most evident in those related to reproduction, but sex differences have been identified from the molecular to the behavioral scale. Some of these differences are subtle and difficult to explain, partly due to the fact that it is difficult to separate the health effects of inherent biological factors from the effects of the surrounding environment they exist in. Women&#x27;s XX sex chromosomes compliment, hormonal environment, as well as sex-specific lifestyles, metabolism, immune system function, and sensitivity to environmental factors are believed to contribute to sex differences in health at the levels of physiology, perception, and cognition. Women can have distinct responses to drugs and thresholds for diagnostic parameters. All of these necessitate caution in extrapolating information derived from biomarkers from one sex to the other. Young women and adolescents are at risk from STIs, pregnancy and unsafe abortion, while older women often have few resources and are disadvantaged with respect to men, and also are at risk of dementia and abuse, and generally poor health.

==Reproductive and sexual health==

Women experience many unique health issues related to reproduction and sexuality and these are responsible for a third of all health problems experienced by women during their reproductive years (aged 15–44), of which unsafe sex is a major risk factor, especially in developing countries. Reproductive health includes a wide range of issues including the health and function of structures and systems involved in reproduction, pregnancy, childbirth and child rearing, including antenatal and perinatal care. Global women&#x27;s health has a much larger focus on reproductive health than that of developed countries alone, but also infectious diseases such as malaria in pregnancy and non-communicable diseases (NCD). Many of the issues that face women and girls in resource poor regions are relatively unknown in developed countries, such as female genital cutting, and further lack access to the appropriate diagnostic and clinical resources.

=== Maternal health ===
Pregnancy presents substantial health risks, even in developed countries, and despite advances in obstetrical science and practice. Maternal mortality remains a major problem in global health and is considered a sentinel event in judging the quality of health care systems. Adolescent pregnancy represents a particular problem, whether intended or unintended, and whether within marriage or a union or not. Pregnancy results in major changes in the life of a young female: physically, emotionally, socially and economically, and jeopardizes their transition into adulthood. Adolescent pregnancy, more often than not, stems from a girl&#x27;s lack of choices. or abuse. Child marriage (see below) is a major contributor worldwide, since 90% of births to females aged 15–19 occur within marriage.

==== Maternal death ====
In 2013 about 289,000 women (800 per day) in the world died due to pregnancy-related causes, with large differences between developed and developing countries. In developed nations maternal mortality had been steadily falling and on average means 16 deaths per 100,000 live births, as measured by the maternal mortality ratio (MMR). By contrast rates as high as 1,000 deaths per 100,000 live births are reported in the rest of the world, with the highest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which account for 86% of such deaths. These deaths are rarely investigated, yet the World Health Organization considers that 99% of these deaths, the majority of which occur within 24 hours of childbirth, are preventable if the appropriate infrastructure, training, and facilities were in place. In these resource-poor countries, maternal health is further eroded by poverty and adverse economic factors which impact the roads, health care facilities, equipment and supplies in addition to limited skilled personnel. Other problems include cultural attitudes towards sexuality, contraception, child marriage, home birth and the ability to recognise medical emergencies. The direct causes of these maternal deaths are hemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labor, sepsis and unskilled abortion. In addition malaria and AIDS can also endanger pregnancy. In the period 2003–2009 hemorrhage was the leading cause of death, accounting for 27% of deaths in developing countries and 16% in developed countries.

Non-reproductive health remains an important predictor of maternal health. In the United States, the leading causes of maternal death are cardiovascular disease (15% of deaths), endocrine, respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders, infection, hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (Gronowski and Schindler, Table II).In 2000, the United Nations created Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5 to improve maternal health. Target 5A sought to reduce maternal mortality by three quarters from 1990 to 2015, using two indicators, 5.1 the MMR and 5.2 the proportion of deliveries attended by skilled health personnel (physician, nurse or midwife). Early reports indicated MDG 5 had made the least progress of all MDGs. By the target date of 2015 the MMR had only declined by 45%, from 380 to 210, most of which occurred after 2000. However this improvement occurred across all regions, but the highest MMRs were still in Africa and Asia, although South Asia witnessed the largest fall, from 530 to 190 (64%). The smallest decline was seen in the developed countries, from 26 to 16 (37%). In terms of assisted births, this proportion had risen globally from 59 to 71%. Although the numbers were similar for both developed and developing regions, there were wide variations in the latter from 52% in South Asia to 100% in East Asia. The risks of dying in pregnancy in developing countries remains fourteen times higher than in developed countries, but in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the MMR is highest, the risk is 175 times higher. In setting the MDG targets, skilled assisted birth was considered a key strategy, but also an indicator of access to care and closely reflect mortality rates. There are also marked differences within regions with a 31% lower rate in rural areas of developing countries (56 vs. 87%), yet there is no difference in East Asia but a 52% difference in Central Africa (32 vs. 84%). With the completion of the MDG campaign in 2015, new targets are being set for 2030 under the Sustainable Development Goals campaign. Maternal health is placed under Goal 3, Health, with the target being to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70. Amongst tools being developed to meet these targets is the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist.

Improvements in maternal health, in addition to professional assistance at delivery, will require routine antenatal care, basic emergency obstetric care, including the availability of antibiotics, oxytocics, anticonvulsants, the ability to manually remove a retained placenta, perform instrumented deliveries, and postpartum care that is financially accessible, such as through insurance. Research has shown the most effective programmes are those focussing on patient and community education, prenatal care, emergency obstetrics (including access to cesarean sections) and transportation. As with women&#x27;s health in general, solutions to maternal health require a broad view encompassing many of the other MDG goals, such as poverty and status, and given that most deaths occur in the immediate intrapartum period, it has been recommended that care (delivery) be a core strategy. New guidelines on antenatal care were issued by WHO in November 2016.

==== Complications of pregnancy ====

In addition to death occurring in pregnancy and childbirth, pregnancy can result in many non-fatal health problems including obstetrical fistulae, ectopic pregnancy, preterm labor, gestational diabetes, hyperemesis gravidarum, hypertensive states including preeclampsia, and anemia. Globally, complications of pregnancy vastly outway maternal deaths, with an estimated 9.5 million cases of pregnancy-related illness and 1.4 million near-misses (survival from severe life-threatening complications). Complications of pregnancy may be physical, mental, economic and social. It is estimated that 10–20 million women will develop physical or mental disability every year, resulting from complications of pregnancy or inadequate care. Consequently, international agencies have developed standards for obstetric care.

Many do not understand how past pregnancy complications impact future pregnancy birthing options. It is a common misconception that after one Cesarean Section birth, it is medically necessary for all future births. One C-section procedure does not deem parents ineligible for safe vaginal delivery.

===== Obstetrical fistula =====
Of near miss events, obstetrical fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain one of the most serious and tragic. Although corrective surgery is possible it is often not available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarean section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this condition, with the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus in the birth canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual fetal death, necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (fistula) allowing urine or feces, or both, to be discharged through the vagina with associated urinary and fecal incontinence, vaginal stenosis, nerve damage and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences are also likely to follow, with shunning of the women. Apart from lack of access to care, causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End Fistula, which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula every year. Prevention includes discouraging teenage pregnancy and child marriage, adequate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including caesarean section.

=== Sexual health ===
==== Contraception ====
The ability to determine if and when to become pregnant, is vital to a woman&#x27;s autonomy and well-being, and contraception can protect girls and young women from the risks of early pregnancy and older women from the increased risks of unintended pregnancy. Adequate access to contraception can limit multiple pregnancies, reduce the need for potentially unsafe abortion and reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Some barrier forms of contraception such as condoms, also reduce the risk of STIs and HIV infection. Access to contraception allows women to make informed choices about their reproductive and sexual health, increases empowerment, and enhances choices in education, careers and participation in public life. At the societal level, access to contraception is a key factor in controlling population growth, with resultant impact on the economy, the environment and regional development. Consequently, the United Nations considers access to contraception a human right that is central to gender equality and women&#x27;s empowerment that saves lives and reduces poverty, and birth control has been considered amongst the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.

To optimise women&#x27;s control over pregnancy, it is essential that culturally appropriate contraceptive advice and means are widely, easily, and affordably available to anyone that is sexually active, including adolescents. In many parts of the world access to contraception and family planning services is very difficult or non existent and even in developed counties cultural and religious traditions can create barriers to access. Reported usage of adequate contraception by women has risen only slightly between 1990 and 2014, with considerable regional variability. Although global usage is around 55%, it may be as low as 25% in Africa. Research shows that women in the Middle East and North Africa use contraception at low rates. Only 14% of women who completed a survey in Jordan said they used condoms with their spouses. Worldwide 222 million women have no or limited access to contraception. Some caution is needed in interpreting available data, since contraceptive prevalence is often defined as &quot;the percentage of women currently using any method of contraception among all women of reproductive age (&quot;i.e.&quot;, those aged 15 to 49 years, unless otherwise stated) who are married or in a union. The &quot;in-union&quot; group includes women living with their partner in the same household and who are not married according to the marriage laws or customs of a country.&quot; This definition is more suited to the more restrictive concept of family planning, but omits the contraceptive needs of all other women and girls who are or are likely to be sexually active, are at risk of pregnancy and are not married or &quot;in-union&quot;.

Three related targets of MDG5 were adolescent birth rate, contraceptive prevalence and unmet need for family planning (where prevalence+unmet need = total need), which were monitored by the Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Contraceptive use was part of Goal 5B (universal access to reproductive health), as Indicator 5.3. The evaluation of MDG5 in 2015 showed that amongst couples usage had increased worldwide from 55% to 64%. with one of the largest increases in Subsaharan Africa (13 to 28%). The corollary, unmet need, declined slightly worldwide (15 to 12%). In 2015 these targets became part of SDG5 (gender equality and empowerment) under Target 5.6: Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, where Indicator 5.6.1 is the proportion of women aged 15–49 years who make their own informed decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and reproductive health care (p. 31).

There remain significant barriers to accessing contraception for many women in both developing and developed regions. These include legislative, administrative, cultural, religious and economic barriers in addition to those dealing with access to and quality of health services. Much of the attention has been focused on preventing adolescent pregnancy. The Overseas Development Institute (ODI) has identified a number of key barriers, on both the supply and demand side, including internalising socio-cultural values, pressure from family members, and cognitive barriers (lack of knowledge), which need addressing. Even in developed regions many women, particularly those who are disadvantaged, may face substantial difficulties in access that may be financial and geographic but may also face religious and political discrimination. Women have also mounted campaigns against potentially dangerous forms of contraception such as defective intrauterine devices (IUD)s, particularly the Dalkon Shield.

==== Abortion ====
Abortion is the intentional killing of an unborn child, as compared to spontaneous termination (miscarriage). Abortion is closely allied to contraception in terms of women&#x27;s control and regulation of their reproduction, and is often subject to similar cultural, religious, legislative and economic constraints. Where access to contraception is limited, women turn to abortion. Consequently, abortion rates may be used to estimate unmet needs for contraception. However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, and still do in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal abortion places undue burdens on lower socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions that create significant barriers. These issues have frequently been the subject of political and feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against moral values.

Globally, there were 87 million unwanted pregnancies in 2005, of those 46 million resorted to abortion, of which 18 million were considered unsafe, resulting in 46,068,000 deaths. The majority of these deaths occurred in the developing world. The United Nations considers these avoidable with access to safe abortion and post-abortion care. While abortion rates have fallen in developed countries, but not in developing countries. Between 2010 and 2014 there were 35 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44, a total of 56 million abortions per year. The United nations has prepared recommendations for health care workers to provide more accessible and safe abortion and post-abortion care. An inherent part of post-abortion care involves provision of adequate contraception.

==== Sexually transmitted infections ====

Important sexual health issues for women include Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and female genital cutting (FGC). STIs are a global health priority because they have serious consequences for women and infants. Mother-to-child transmission of STIs can lead to stillbirths, neonatal death, low-birth-weight and prematurity, sepsis, pneumonia, neonatal conjunctivitis, and congenital deformities. Syphilis in pregnancy results in over 300,000 fetal and neonatal deaths per year, and 215,000 infants with an increased risk of death from prematurity, low-birth-weight or congenital disease.

Diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea are also important causes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and subsequent infertility in women. Another important consequence of some STIs such as genital herpes and syphilis increase the risk of acquiring HIV by three-fold, and can also influence its transmission progression. Worldwide, women and girls are at greater risk of HIV/AIDS. STIs are in turn associated with unsafe sexual activity that is often unconsensual. In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), a large number of HIV-positive women contracted the virus from their spouses or partners. In comparison to men, taboos, and discrimination against women living with HIV are more pervasive throughout the MENA region. Women in the MENA region are more vulnerable to HIV because of gender inequity, gender-based violence, and restricted access to comprehensive healthcare systems.

==== Female genital mutilation ====

Female genital mutilation (also referred to as female genital cutting) is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as &quot;all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons&quot;. It has sometimes been referred to as female circumcision, although this term is misleading because it implies it is analogous to the circumcision of the foreskin from the male penis. Consequently, the term mutilation was adopted to emphasise the gravity of the act and its place as a violation of human rights. Subsequently, the term cutting was advanced to avoid offending cultural sensibility that would interfere with dialogue for change. To recognise these points of view some agencies use the composite female genital mutilation/cutting (FMG/C).

It has affected more than 200 million women and girls who are alive today. The practice is concentrated in some 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Female genital mutilation is still common, impacting around 50 million women and girls in the five countries of Yemen, Egypt, Sudan, Djibouti, and Iraq in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, as adolescent women frequently experience a lack of bodily autonomy in the Arab world. According to data, the frequency of FGM among women between the ages of 15 and 49 is high: 94% in Djibouti, 87% in Egypt and Sudan, 19% in Yemen, and 7% in Iraq. FGC affects many religious faiths, nationalities, and socioeconomic classes and is highly controversial. The main arguments advanced to justify FGC are hygiene, fertility, the preservation of chastity, an important rite of passage, marriageability and enhanced sexual pleasure of male partners. The amount of tissue removed varies considerably, leading the WHO and other bodies to classify FGC into four types. These range from the partial or total removal of the clitoris with or without the prepuce (clitoridectomy) in Type I, to the additional removal of the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora (Type II) to narrowing of the vaginal orifice (introitus) with the creation of a covering seal by suturing the remaining labial tissue over the urethra and introitus, with or without excision of the clitoris (infibulation). In this type a small opening is created to allow urine and menstrual blood to be discharged. Type 4 involves all other procedures, usually relatively minor alterations such as piercing.

While defended by those cultures in which it constitutes a tradition, FGC is opposed by many medical and cultural organizations on the grounds that it is unnecessary and harmful. Short-term health effects may include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis, and even result in death, while long term effects include dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, vaginitis and cystitis. In addition FGC leads to complications with pregnancy, labor and delivery. Reversal (defibulation) by skilled personnel may be required to open the scarred tissue. Amongst those opposing the practice are local grassroots groups, and national and international organisations including WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and Amnesty International. Legislative efforts to ban FGC have rarely been successful and the preferred approach is education and empowerment and the provision of information about the adverse health effects as well the human rights aspects.

Progress has been made but girls 14 and younger represent 44 million of those who have been cut, and in some regions 50% of all girls aged 11 and younger have been cut. Ending FGC has been considered one of the necessary goals in achieving the targets of the Millennium Development Goals, while the United Nations has declared ending FGC a target of the Sustainable Development Goals, and for February 6 to known as the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation, concentrating on 17 African countries and the 5 million girls between the ages of 15 and 19 that would otherwise be cut by 2030.

=== Infertility ===

In the United States, infertility affects 1.5 million couples. The rates of infertility in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) are difficult to measure due to varying definitions of the condition. When infertility is defined as failure to have a successful birth, the MENA region has a very high rate at 33%. Morocco has the highest percentage of infertility among the MENA countries with an infertility rate of 56.8%. Rates of infertility, defined as failure to conceive (clinical infertility), are probably lower in the region but there is a lack of data on the exact numbers. There is a dearth of research on clinical infertility in the MENA region, with the exception of Iran, which is attributed to a societal reluctance to discuss infertility openly.

Many couples seek assisted reproductive technology (ART) for infertility. In the United States in 2010, 147,260 in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures were carried out, with 47,090 live births resulting. In 2013 these numbers had increased to 160,521 and 53,252. However, about a half of IVF pregnancies result in multiple-birth deliveries, which in turn are associated with an increase in both morbidity and mortality of the mother and the infant. Causes for this include increased maternal blood pressure, premature birth and low birth weight. In addition, more women are waiting longer to conceive and seeking ART.

=== Child marriage ===

Child marriage (including union or cohabitation) is defined as marriage under the age of eighteen and is an ancient custom. In 2010 it was estimated that 67 million women, then, in their twenties had been married before they turned eighteen, and that 150 million would be in the next decade, equivalent to 15 million per year. This number had increased to 70 million by 2012. In developing countries one third of girls are married under age, and 1:9 before 15. The practice is commonest in South Asia (48% of women), Africa (42%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (29%). The highest prevalence is in Western and Sub-Saharan Africa. The percentage of girls married before the age of eighteen is as high as 75% in countries such as Niger. Approximately one in five young women in the Middle East and North Africa were married before becoming eighteen, and one in twenty-five married before turning fifteen. In Egypt, 17% of women in the 20–24 age group, 13% in Morocco, 28% in Iraq, 8% in Jordan, 6% in Lebanon, and 3% in Algeria were married or engaged before turning 18. Most child marriage involves girls. For instance in Mali the ratio of girls to boys is 72:1, while in countries such as the United States the ratio is 8:1. Marriage may occur as early as birth, with the girl being sent to her husbands home as early as age seven.

There are a number of cultural factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child&#x27;s financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age are also more likely to be the victims of domestic violence.

There has been an international effort to reduce this practice, and in many countries eighteen is the legal age of marriage. Organizations with campaigns to end child marriage include the United Nations and its agencies, such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, UNFPA, UNICEF and WHO. Like many global issues affecting women&#x27;s health, poverty and gender inequality are root causes, and any campaign to change cultural attitudes has to address these. Child marriage is the subject of international conventions and agreements such as The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW, 1979) (article 16) and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in 2014 a summit conference (Girl Summit) co-hosted by UNICEF and the UK was held in London (see illustration) to address this issue together with FGM/C. Later that same year the General Assembly of the United Nations passed a resolution, which &quot;inter alia&quot;

Amongst non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working to end child marriage are Girls not Brides, Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association (YWCA), the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) and Human Rights Watch (HRW). Although not explicitly included in the original Millennium Development Goals, considerable pressure was applied to include ending child marriage in the successor Sustainable Development Goals adopted in September 2015, where ending this practice by 2030 is a target of SDG 5 Gender Equality (see above). While some progress is being made in reducing child marriage, particularly for girls under fifteen, the prospects are daunting. The indicator for this will be the percentage of women aged 20–24 who were married or in a union before the age of eighteen. Efforts to end child marriage include legislation and ensuring enforcement together with empowering women and girls. To raise awareness, the inaugural UN International Day of the Girl Child in 2012 was dedicated to ending child marriage.

=== Menstrual cycle ===
Women&#x27;s menstrual cycles, the approximately monthly cycle of changes in the reproductive system, can pose significant challenges for women in their reproductive years (the early teens to about 50 years of age). These include the physiological changes that can effect physical and mental health, symptoms of ovulation and the regular shedding of the inner lining of the uterus (endometrium) accompanied by vaginal bleeding (menses or menstruation). The onset of menstruation (menarche) may be alarming to unprepared girls and mistaken for illness. Menstruation can place undue burdens on women in terms of their ability to participate in activities, and access to menstrual aids such as tampons and sanitary pads. This is particularly acute amongst poorer socioeconomic groups where they may represent a financial burden and in developing countries where menstruation can be an impediment to a girl&#x27;s education. In the Middle East and North Africa, period poverty and stigma have an influence on girls&#x27; education and general well-being. Misinformation and a lack of fundamental knowledge cause girls to miss school during their menstrual cycle and contribute to the prevailing stigma around getting your period.

Equally challenging for women are the physiological and emotional changes associated with the cessation of menses (menopause or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually towards the end of the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and menstruation is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (oestrogen and progesterone) and the pituitary gland (follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and luteinizing hormone or LH). These hormonal changes may be associated with both systemic sensations such as hot flashes and local changes to the reproductive tract such as reduced vaginal secretions and lubrication. While menopause may bring relief from symptoms of menstruation and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with the symbolism of the loss of fertility and a reminder of aging and possible loss of desirability. While menopause generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature menopause) as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When menopause occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.

=== Other issues ===

Other reproductive and sexual health issues include sex education, puberty, sexuality and sexual function. Women also experience a number of issues related to the health of their breasts and genital tract, which fall into the scope of gynaecology.

== Non-reproductive health ==
Women and men have different experiences of the same illnesses, especially cardiovascular disease, cancer, depression and dementia. Women are also more prone to urinary tract infections than men.

=== Cardiovascular disease ===
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death (35%) amongst women globally. The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome. Among women in the Middle East, cardiovascular disease-related morbidity and death are increasing. At the same time, awareness and education on the disease, as well as research, are lacking in the region.

=== Cancer ===
Women and men have approximately equal risk of dying from cancer, which accounts for about a quarter of all deaths, and is the second leading cause of death. However the relative incidence of different cancers varies between women and men. Globally the three most common types of cancer of women in 2020 were breast, lung and colorectal cancers. These three account for 44.5% of all cancer cases in women. Other types of cancers specifically affecting women include ovarian, uterine (endometrial and cervical) cancers.

While cancer death rates rose rapidly during the twentieth century, the increase was less and happened later in women due to differences in smoking rates. More recently cancer death rates have started to decline as the use of tobacco becomes less common. Between 1991 and 2012, the death rate in women declined by 19% (less than in men). In the early twentieth century death from uterine (uterine body and cervix) cancers was the leading cause of cancer death in women, who had a higher cancer mortality than men. From the 1930s onwards, uterine cancer deaths declined, primarily due to lower death rates from cervical cancer following the availability of the Papanicolaou (Pap) screening test. This resulted in an overall reduction of cancer deaths in women between the 1940s and 1970s, when rising rates of lung cancer led to an overall increase. By the 1950s the decline in uterine cancer left breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death until it was overtaken by lung cancer in the 1980s. All three cancers (lung, breast, uterus) are now declining in cancer death rates, but more women die from lung cancer every year than from breast, ovarian, and uterine cancers combined. Overall about 20% of people found to have lung cancer are never smokers, yet amongst nonsmoking women the risk of developing lung cancer is three times greater than amongst men who never smoked.

In addition to mortality, cancer is a cause of considerable morbidity in women. Women have a lower lifetime probability of being diagnosed with cancer (38% vs 45% for men), but are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer at an earlier age.

==== Breast cancer ====

Breast cancer is most common type of cancer among women. Globally, it accounts for 25% of all cancers. It is also among the ten most common chronic diseases of women, and a substantial contributor to loss of quality of life. In 2016, breast cancer was the most common cancer diagnosed among women in both developed and developing countries, accounting for nearly 30% of all cases, and worldwide accounts for one and a half million cases and over half a million deaths, being the fifth most common cause of cancer death overall and the second in developed regions. In the Middle East and North Africa, there were 95,000 cases of breast cancer in 2019. The countries with the highest age-standardized prevalence rates per 100,000 females in the region were Bahrain, Qatar, and Lebanon. Geographic variation in incidence is the opposite of that of cervical cancer, being highest in Northern America and lowest in Eastern and Middle Africa, but mortality rates are relatively constant, resulting in a wide variance in case mortality, ranging from 25% in developed regions to 37% in developing regions, and with 62% of deaths occurring in developing countries.

==== Cervical cancer ====

Globally, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer amongst women. It is particularly common in women with lower socioeconomic status, living in low-and middle-income countries who have reduced access to health care. Customs and cultural practices that involve child and forced marriage, higher rates of parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners further increase the chances of cervical cancer. In developing countries, cervical cancer accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second leading cause of death, where about 85% of the global burden of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer in women. The case fatality rate of 52% is also higher in developing countries than in developed countries (43%), and the mortality rate varies by 18-fold between regions of the world.

Cervical cancer is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV), which has also been implicated in cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. Almost 300 million women worldwide have been infected with HPV, one of the commoner sexually transmitted infections, and 5% of the 13 million new cases of cancer in the world have been attributed to HPV. In developed countries, screening for cervical cancer using the Pap test has identified pre-cancerous changes in the cervix, at least in those women with access to health care. Also an HPV vaccine programme is available in 45 countries. Screening and prevention programmes have limited availability in developing countries although inexpensive low technology programmes are being developed, but access to treatment is also limited. If applied globally, HPV vaccination at 70% coverage could save the lives of 4 million women from cervical cancer, since most cases occur in developing countries.

==== Ovarian cancer ====

Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer globally. It is predominantly a disease of women in industrialized countries and death from ovarian cancer is more common in North America and Europe than in Africa and Asia. Because it is largely asymptomatic in its earliest stages and lacks an effective screening programme, more than 50% of women have stage III or higher cancer (spread beyond the ovaries) by the time they are diagnosed, with a consequent poor prognosis.

=== Mental health ===
Almost 25% of women will experience mental health issues over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women are estimated to be $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (&lt;1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60. In the United Kingdom, the Women&#x27;s Mental Health Taskforce was formed aiming to address differences in mental health experiences and needs between women and men.

=== Dementia ===
The prevalence of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in the United States is estimated at 5.1 million, and of these two thirds are women. Furthermore, women are far more likely to be the primary caregivers of adult family members with dementia, so that they bear both the risks and burdens of this disease. The lifetime risk for a woman of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease is twice that of men. Part of this difference may be due to life expectancy, but changing hormonal status over their lifetime may also play a par as may differences in gene expression. Deaths due to dementia are higher in women than men (4.5% of deaths vs. 2.0%).

=== Bone health ===
Osteoporosis ranks sixth amongst chronic diseases of women in the United States, with an overall prevalence of 18%, and a much higher rate involving the femur, neck or lumbar spine amongst women (16%) than men (4%), over the age of 50. Osteoporosis is a risk factor for bone fracture and about 20% of senior citizens who sustain a hip fracture die within a year. The gender gap is largely the result of the reduction of estrogen levels in women following the menopause. Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) has been shown to reduce this risk by 25–30%, and was a common reason for prescribing it during the 1980s and 1990s. However the Women&#x27;s Health Initiative (WHI) study that demonstrated that the risks of HRT outweighed the benefits has since led to a decline in HRT usage.

=== Anaemia ===
Anaemia is a major global health problem for women. Women are affected more than men, in which up to 30% of women being found to be anaemic and 42% of pregnant women. Anaemia is linked to a number of adverse health outcomes including a poor pregnancy outcome and impaired cognitive function (decreased concentration and attention). The main cause of anaemia is iron deficiency. In United States women iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects 37% of pregnant women, but globally the prevalence is as high as 80%. Anaemia affects over one-third of the population in the Middle East and North Africa, caused by iron deficiencies or a combination of other factors, with women making up the bulk of those affected. In Saudi Arabia, 40% of women in the 15–49 age range suffer from anaemia. IDA starts in adolescence, from excess menstrual blood loss, compounded by the increased demand for iron in growth and suboptimal dietary intake. In the adult woman, pregnancy leads to further iron depletion.

=== Violence ===

Women experience structural and personal violence differently than men. The United Nations has defined violence against women as;

Violence against women may take many forms, including physical, sexual, emotional and psychological and may occur throughout the life-course. Structural violence may be embedded in legislation or policy, or be systematic misogyny by organisations against groups of women. Perpetrators of personal violence include state actors, strangers, acquaintances, relatives and intimate partners and manifests itself across a spectrum from discrimination, through harassment, sexual assault and rape, and physical harm to murder (femicide). It may also include cultural practices such as female genital cutting.

Non-fatal violence against women has severe implications for women&#x27;s physical, mental and reproductive health, and is seen as not simply isolated events but rather a systematic pattern of behaviour that both violates their rights but also limits their role in society and requires a systematic approach.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 35% of women in the world have experienced physical or sexual violence over their lifetime and that the commonest situation is intimate partner violence. 30% of women in relationships report such experience, and 38% of murders of women are due to intimate partners. These figures may be as high as 70% in some regions. Risk factors include low educational achievement, a parental experience of violence, childhood abuse, gender inequality and cultural attitudes that allow violence to be considered more acceptable.

The COVID-19 epidemic made gender-based violence more common in Arab countries and worsened already-existing health disparities between the sexes. Yet millions of women in the Middle East and North Africa did not receive enough attention when it came to the provision of enhanced protection from gender-based violence.

Violence was declared a global health priority by the WHO at its assembly in 1996, drawing on both the United Nations Declaration on the elimination of violence against women (1993) and the recommendations of both the International Conference on Population and Development (Cairo, 1994) and the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing, 1995) This was followed by its 2002 World Report on Violence and Health, which focusses on intimate partner and sexual violence. Meanwhile, the UN embedded these in an action plan when its General Assembly passed the Millennium Declaration in September 2000, which resolved &quot;inter alia&quot; &quot;to combat all forms of violence against women and to implement the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women&quot;. One of the Millennium Goals (MDG 3) was the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women, which sought to eliminate all forms of violence against women as well as implementing CEDAW. This recognised that eliminating violence, including discrimination was a prerequisite to achieving all other goals of improving women&#x27;s health. However it was later criticised for not including violence as an explicit target, the &quot;missing target&quot;. In the evaluation of MDG 3, violence remained a major barrier to achieving the goals. In the successor Sustainable Development Goals, which also explicitly list the related issues of discrimination, child marriage and genital cutting, one target is listed as &quot;Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres&quot; by 2030.

UN Women believe that violence against women &quot;is rooted in gender-based discrimination and social norms and gender stereotypes that perpetuate such violence&quot;, and advocate moving from supporting victims to prevention, through addressing root and structural causes. They recommend programmes that start early in life and are directed towards both genders to promote respect and equality, an area often overlooked in public policy. This strategy, which involves broad educational and cultural change, also involves implementing the recommendations of the 57th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (2013). To that end the 2014 UN International Day of the Girl Child was dedicated to ending the cycle of violence. In 2016, the World Health Assembly also adopted a plan of action to combat violence against women, globally.

== Women in health research ==

Changes in the way research ethics was visualised in the wake of the Nuremberg Trials (1946), led to an atmosphere of protectionism of groups deemed to be vulnerable that was often legislated or regulated. This resulted in the relative underrepresentation of women in clinical trials. The position of women in research was further compromised in 1977, when in response to the tragedies resulting from thalidomide and diethylstilbestrol (DES), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited women of child-bearing years from participation in early stage clinical trials. In practice this ban was often applied very widely to exclude all women. Women, at least those in the child-bearing years, and female animals were also deemed unsuitable research subjects due to their fluctuating hormonal levels during the menstrual or other reproductive cycles. However, research has demonstrated significant biological differences between the sexes in rates of susceptibility, symptoms and response to treatment in many major areas of health, including heart disease and some cancers. These exclusions pose a threat to the application of evidence-based medicine to women, and compromise to care offered to both women and men.

The increasing focus on Women&#x27;s Rights in the United States during the 1980s focused attention on the fact that many drugs being prescribed for women had never actually been tested in women of child-bearing potential, and that there was a relative paucity of basic research into women&#x27;s health. In response to this the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the Office of Research on Women&#x27;s Health (ORWH) in 1990 to address these inequities. In 1993 the National Institutes of Health Revitalisation Act officially reversed US policy by requiring NIH funded phase III clinical trials to include women. This resulted in an increase in women recruited into research studies. The next phase was the specific funding of large scale epidemiology studies and clinical trials focussing on women&#x27;s health such as the Women&#x27;s Health Initiative (1991), the largest disease prevention study conducted in the US. Its role was to study the major causes of death, disability and frailty in older women. Despite this apparent progress, women remain underrepresented. In 2006 women accounted for less than 25% of clinical trials published in 2004, A follow-up study by the same authors five years later found little evidence of improvement. Another study found between 10 and 47% of women in heart disease clinical trials, despite the prevalence of heart disease in women. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death amongst women, but while the number of women enrolled in lung cancer studies is increasing, they are still far less likely to be enrolled than men.

One of the challenges in assessing progress in this area is the number of clinical studies that either do not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further compounded by the fact that the majority of animal studies also exclude females or fail to account for differences in sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issues of sex and gender in their research. Some countries address the underrepresentation of women in research studies by the establishment of centers of excellence focusing on women&#x27;s health research and running large scale clinical trials such as the Women&#x27;s Health Initiative.

A related issue is the inclusion of pregnant women in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on the response to and efficacy of interventions during pregnancy, but ethical issues relative to the fetus, make this more complex. This gender bias is partly offset by the initiation of large scale epidemiology studies of women, such as the Nurses&#x27; Health Study (1976), Women&#x27;s Health Initiative and Black Women&#x27;s Health Study.

Women have also been the subject of neglect in health care research, such as the situation revealed in the Cartwright Inquiry in New Zealand (1988), in which research by two feminist journalists revealed that women with cervical abnormalities were not receiving treatment, as part of an experiment. The women were not told of the abnormalities and several later died.

The Women&#x27;s Health Care Market is today a major pharmaceutical industry, projected to double in size within the five years from 2019 to 2024 and reach USD 17.8 billion. The by far most valued company worldwide whose leading products are in Women&#x27;s Health is Bayer (Germany) with the focus area of Contraception.

== National and international initiatives ==

In addition to addressing gender inequity in research, a number of countries have made women&#x27;s health the subject of national initiatives. For instance in 1991 in the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services established an Office on Women&#x27;s Health (OWH) with the goal of improving the health of women in America, through coordinating the women&#x27;s health agenda throughout the department, and other agencies. In the twenty first century the Office has focussed on underserviced women. Also, in 1994 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established its own Office of Women&#x27;s Health (OWH), which was formally authorised by the 2010 Affordable Health Care Act (ACA).

Internationally, many United Nations agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and UNICEF maintain specific programs on women&#x27;s health, or maternal, sexual and reproductive health. In addition the United Nations global goals address many issues related to women&#x27;s health, both directly and indirectly. These include the 2000 Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and their successor, the Sustainable Development Goals adopted in September 2015, following the report on progress towards the MDGs (&quot;The Millennium Development Goals Report 2015&quot;). For instance the eight MDG goals, eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality and empowering women, reducing child mortality rates, improving maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS malaria and other diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability, and developing a global partnership for development, all impact on women&#x27;s health, as do all seventeen SDG goals, in addition to the specific SDG5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.

== Goals and challenges ==

Research is a priority in terms of improving women&#x27;s health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more serious in women and those that differ in risk factors between women and men. The balance of sex and/or gender in research studies needs to be balanced appropriately to allow analysis that will detect interactions between sex and/or gender and other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation of sex a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that funding agencies require justification from investigators for any sex inequity in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it is the role of health organisations to encourage women to enroll in clinical research. However, there has been progress in terms of large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women&#x27;s Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences and the journal &quot;Biology of Sex Differences&quot; to further the study of sex differences.

Research findings can take some time before becoming routinely implemented into clinical practice. Clinical medicine needs to incorporate the information already available from research studies as to the different ways in which diseases affect women and men. Many &quot;normal&quot; laboratory values have not been properly established for the female population separately, and similarly the &quot;normal&quot; criteria for growth and development. Drug dosing needs to take sex differences in drug metabolism into account.
Globally, women&#x27;s access to health care remains a challenge, both in developing and developed countries. In the United States, before the Affordable Health Care Act came into effect, 25% of women of child-bearing age lacked health insurance. In the absence of adequate insurance, women are likely to avoid important steps to self care such as routine physical examination, screening and prevention testing, and prenatal care. The situation is aggravated by the fact that women living below the poverty line are at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy, unplanned delivery and elective abortion. Added to the financial burden in this group are poor educational achievement, lack of transportation, inflexible work schedules and difficulty obtaining child care, all of which function to create barriers to accessing health care. These problems are much worse in developing countries. Under 50% of childbirths in these countries are assisted by healthcare providers (&quot;e.g.&quot; midwives, nurses, doctors) which accounts for higher rates of maternal death, up to 1:1,000 live births. This is despite the WHO setting standards, such as a minimum of four antenatal visits. A lack of healthcare providers, facilities, and resources such as formularies all contribute to high levels of morbidity amongst women from avoidable conditions such as obstetrical fistulae, sexually transmitted infections and cervical cancer.

These challenges are included in the goals of the Office of Research on Women&#x27;s Health, in the United States, as is the goal of facilitating women&#x27;s access to careers in biomedicine. The ORWH believes that one of the best ways to advance research in women&#x27;s health is to increase the proportion of women involved in healthcare and health research, as well as assuming leadership in government, centres of higher learning, and in the private sector. This goal acknowledges the glass ceiling that women face in careers in science and in obtaining resources from grant funding to salaries and laboratory space. The National Science Foundation in the United States states that women only gain half of the doctorates awarded in science and engineering, fill only 21% of full-time professor positions in science and 5% of those in engineering, while earning only 82% of the remuneration their male colleagues make. These figures are even lower in Europe.

<text>Polymer chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that focuses on the structures, chemical synthesis, and chemical and physical properties of polymers and macromolecules. The principles and methods used within polymer chemistry are also applicable through a wide range of other chemistry sub-disciplines like organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, and physical chemistry. Many materials have polymeric structures, from fully inorganic metals and ceramics to DNA and other biological molecules. However, polymer chemistry is typically related to synthetic and organic compositions. Synthetic polymers are ubiquitous in commercial materials and products in everyday use, such as plastics, and rubbers, and are major components of composite materials. Polymer chemistry can also be included in the broader fields of polymer science or even nanotechnology, both of which can be described as encompassing polymer physics and polymer engineering.

== History ==
The work of Henri Braconnot in 1777 and the work of Christian Schönbein in 1846 led to the discovery of nitrocellulose, which, when treated with camphor, produced celluloid. Dissolved in ether or acetone, it becomes collodion, which has been used as a wound dressing since the U.S. Civil War. Cellulose acetate was first prepared in 1865. In years 1834-1844 the properties of rubber (polyisoprene) were found to be greatly improved by heating with sulfur, thus founding the vulcanization process.

In 1884 Hilaire de Chardonnet started the first artificial fiber plant based on regenerated cellulose, or viscose rayon, as a substitute for silk, but it was very flammable. In 1907 Leo Baekeland invented the first polymer made independent of the products of organisms, a thermosetting phenol-formaldehyde resin called Bakelite. Around the same time, Hermann Leuchs reported the synthesis of amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides and their high molecular weight products upon reaction with nucleophiles, but stopped short of referring to these as polymers, possibly due to the strong views espoused by Emil Fischer, his direct supervisor, denying the possibility of any covalent molecule exceeding 6,000 daltons. Cellophane was invented in 1908 by Jocques Brandenberger who treated sheets of viscose rayon with acid.
 The chemist Hermann Staudinger first proposed that polymers consisted of long chains of atoms held together by covalent bonds, which he called macromolecules. His work expanded the chemical understanding of polymers and was followed by an expansion of the field of polymer chemistry during which such polymeric materials as neoprene, nylon and polyester were invented. Before Staudinger, polymers were thought to be clusters of small molecules (colloids), without definite molecular weights, held together by an unknown force. Staudinger received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1953. Wallace Carothers invented the first synthetic rubber called neoprene in 1931, the first polyester, and went on to invent nylon, a true silk replacement, in 1935. Paul Flory was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 for his work on polymer random coil configurations in solution in the 1950s. Stephanie Kwolek developed an aramid, or aromatic nylon named Kevlar, patented in 1966. Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta received a Nobel Prize for their discovery of catalysts for the polymerization of alkenes. Alan J. Heeger, Alan MacDiarmid, and Hideki Shirakawa were awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of polyacetylene and related conductive polymers. Polyacetylene itself did not find practical applications, but organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) emerged as one application of conducting polymers.

Teaching and research programs in polymer chemistry were introduced in the 1940s. An Institute for Macromolecular Chemistry was founded in 1940 in Freiburg, Germany under the direction of Staudinger. In America, a Polymer Research Institute (PRI) was established in 1941 by Herman Mark at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now Polytechnic Institute of NYU).

== Polymers and their properties ==

Polymers are high molecular mass compounds formed by polymerization of monomers. They are synthesized by the polymerization process and can be modified by the additive of monomers. The additives of monomers change polymers mechanical property, processability, durability and so on. The simple reactive molecule from which the repeating structural units of a polymer are derived is called a monomer. A polymer can be described in many ways: its degree of polymerisation, molar mass distribution, tacticity, copolymer distribution, the degree of branching, by its end-groups, crosslinks, crystallinity and thermal properties such as its glass transition temperature and melting temperature. Polymers in solution have special characteristics with respect to solubility, viscosity, and gelation. Illustrative of the quantitative aspects of polymer chemistry, particular attention is paid to the number-average and weight-average molecular weights formula_1 and formula_2, respectively.
&lt;br&gt;
:formula_3

The formation and properties of polymers have been rationalized by many theories including Scheutjens–Fleer theory, Flory–Huggins solution theory, Cossee–Arlman mechanism, Polymer field theory, Hoffman Nucleation Theory, Flory–Stockmayer theory, and many others.
The study of polymer thermodynamics helps improve the material properties of various polymer-based materials such as polystyrene (styrofoam) and polycarbonate. Common improvements include toughening, improving impact resistance, improving biodegradability, and altering a material&#x27;s solubility.

=== Viscosity ===
As polymers get longer and their molecular weight increases, their viscosity tend to increase. Thus, the measured viscosity of polymers can provide valuable information about the average length of the polymer, the progress of reactions, and in what ways the polymer branches.

==Classification==
Polymers can be classified in many ways. Polymers, strictly speaking, comprise most solid matter: minerals (i.e. most of the Earth&#x27;s crust) are largely polymers, metals are 3-d polymers, organisms, living and dead, are composed largely of polymers and water. Often polymers are classified according to their origin:
* biopolymers
* synthetic polymers
* inorganic polymers
Biopolymers are the structural and functional materials that comprise most of the organic matter in organisms. One major class of biopolymers are proteins, which are derived from amino acids. Polysaccharides, such as cellulose, chitin, and starch, are biopolymers derived from sugars. The polynucleic acids DNA and RNA are derived from phosphorylated sugars with pendant nucleotides that carry genetic information.

Synthetic polymers are the structural materials manifested in plastics, synthetic fibers, paints, building materials, furniture, mechanical parts, and adhesives. Synthetic polymers may be divided into thermoplastic polymers and thermoset plastics. Thermoplastic polymers include polyethylene, teflon, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyester, polyurethane, Poly(methyl methacrylate), polyvinyl chloride, nylons, and rayon. Thermoset plastics include vulcanized rubber, bakelite, Kevlar, and polyepoxide. Almost all synthetic polymers are derived from petrochemicals.

<doc id="656970" wikidata="Q854882" url="?curid=656970" title="Flag of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic">
<text>The flag of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]] was adopted by the Kazakh government on 24 January 1953. The flag resembles the flag of the Soviet Union in defaced form with a 2/9 horizontal blue (azure) bar in the lower part of the flag and the hammer and sickle in the near centre.

==History==
Between 1937 and the adoption of the above flag in 1940, the flag was red with a gold hammer and sickle in the top-left corner, with the Latin characters &quot;QAZAQ SSR&quot; and the Cyrillic characters &quot;КАЗАХСКАЯ ССР&quot; (&quot;KAZAKHSKAYA SSR&quot;) in gold in a sans-serif font beneath the hammer and sickle.

The second flag was red with the gold hammer and sickle in the top-left corner, with the Cyrillic characters &quot;Қазақ ССР&quot; (&quot;Qazaq SSR&quot;) and &quot;Казахская ССР&quot; (&quot;Kazakhskaya SSR&quot;) in gold to the right of the hammer and sickle was adopted on 10 November 1940 which adopted a law on the transfer of Kazakh writing in Russian alphabet charts, modified accordingly and the inscription on the emblem.

On 24 January 1953, the new flag of the Kazakh SSR was approved by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh SSR. It was the flag of the Soviet Union; with the blue horizontal stripe at the bottom of the cloth. The width of the blue band is equal to 2/9 of the flag width, and the distance to it from the lower edge of the flag, 1/9 of the flag&#x27;s width.

The regulations of the state flag of the Kazakh SSR was approved on 28 August 1981. It specified the proportions of the hammer and sickle and red star: the hammer and sickle are within a square side of the flag&#x27;s width to 1/4 the length of the hammer handle - 3/4 of the diagonal of the square, the star fits into the diameter of a circle 1/8 of the flag width, distance of the vertical axis stars from the flagpole - 1/4 of the flag&#x27;s width, the distance from the top edge to the center of the star - 1/8 of the flag&#x27;s width.

The flag remained in use as the first flag of Kazakhstan until the new one was adopted on 4 June 1992.

<text>The flag of the Kirghiz SSR was adopted by the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Kirghiz SSR decreed by its Decree on 22 December 1952. The 1978 constitution of the Kirghiz SSR states that the ratio of the flag is 1:2 with the blue/white/blue stripes in the middle taking of the flag height and the white stripes of flag height. 

According to the constitution in detail in article 168:

The flag differences from the flag of the Soviet Union and the flags of the Soviet Republics was a larger star (in comparison with the image of the sickle and hammer) and the location of the hammer and sickle practically on the border of the red and blue stripes: on the flags of all other republics (except for Georgia and Turkmenia), the diameter of the circle into which the 5-terminal star was inscribed was exactly half the size of the side of the square in which the sickle and hammer were inscribed, and on the flag of Kirghizia, the diameter of the star (1/10 of the width of the flag) was more than half Side of the square (1/6 of the width of the flag).

==History==
After the formation of the Kirghiz SSR on 5 December 1936 the first flag of the Kirghiz SSR was adopted.

The first variant of the flag used the Latin version of the Kyrgyz alphabet. This flag was in use from 1937 to 1940.

After the adoption of the Cyrillic alphabet new flag design was created.

On 22 December 1952, the red flag was replaced with a new red flag with a blue and white stripes in the middle of the entire length of the flag.

After independence, this flag remained the flag of the newly independent Kyrgyzstan until 1992 when a new flag was introduced.

<text>The flag of the Lithuanian SSR was first adopted by the Lithuanian SSR in 1918, which was a plain red flag. After the Lithuanian SSR was established again in 1940, the flag was a red flag with the national name and a hammer and sickle in the upper canton. The flag in use from 1953 to 1988 was a red flag with the golden hammer and sickle and a gold-bordered red star in its upper canton with a white thin stripe and green thick band on the bottom.

==History==
During the Lithuanian–Soviet War, the first Lithuanian SSR used a plain red flag. This was later adopted by Lithuanian–Byelorussian SSR (Litbel).

When Lithuanian SSR was established again as a republic of the USSR, it adopted a new national flag on 30 July 1940. The flag was red with the Latin characters &quot;LIETUVOS TSR&quot; (Lithuanian SSR in the Lithuanian language) in gold sans-serif typeface in the upper canton, and a gold hammer and sickle below the text.

On 15 July 1953, a new flag was adopted. It was modified to meet the new requirements for all flags of the Soviet socialist republics. The top red portion took of the width and incorporated the mandatory hammer and sickle and red star. The bottom part could be customized by each republic. Lithuania added a narrow white ( of the width) and a larger green ( of the width) strips. The green and white stripes thus represented the country&#x27;s wide fields and forests, which serve the country&#x27;s agricultural and forestry industries.

On 18 November 1988, the tricolour of Lithuania was adopted as the flag of the SSR, even before Lithuania declared independence in March 1990. The Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR, inspired by pro-independence Sąjūdis, amended the constitution and adopted the tricolour flag of Lithuania that was used during the interwar years.

==Legal status==
Since Lithuania banned Soviet symbols in 2008, raising or otherwise using the Lithuanian SSR flag in public is illegal.

<text>The flag of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic for most of its history was a horizontal triband of red, green and red, in a 3:2:3 ratio, charged in the canton with a gold hammer and sickle crowned by a gold-bordered, five-pointed red star. This was the SSR&#x27;s second flag, adopted on 31 January 1952.

The SSR&#x27;s first flag was in use from 1940 to 1952. In 1990, the Romanian tricolor was briefly the SSR&#x27;s flag before what would become the coat of arms of Moldova was added to the center. The resulting flag was retained when Moldova declared its independence the following year, in 1991.

The unrecognized state of Transnistria, which broke away from the rest of Moldova in 1990, retained the (second) flag of the Moldavian SSR and still uses it to this day.

==History==

===Moldavian ASSR===
Between 1924 and 1940, part of Moldova was organized as the Moldavian ASSR within the Ukrainian SSR. A red flag, with the gold hammer and sickle in the top-left corner, above the Cyrillic characters &quot;УРСР&quot; (Ukrainian initials of &quot;Ukrainian SSR&quot;) and the Latin characters &quot;RSSU&quot; (Moldovan initials of &quot;Ukrainian SSR&quot; in Latin script) was adopted in 1938. The Moldovan text on the flag was later changed to &quot;PCCУ&quot; (Moldovan initials of &quot;Ukrainian SSR&quot; in Cyrillic script). 

===Moldavian SSR===
In 1940, a red flag with the gold hammer and sickle in the top-left corner, with the Cyrillic characters &quot;РССМ&quot; (Moldovan initials of &quot;Moldavian SSR&quot; in Cyrillic script) above them in gold in a serif font was adopted for the newly founded Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic.

On 31 January 1952, the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Moldavian SSR &quot;On the approval of the draft of the new State Flag of the Moldavian SSR&quot; approved the following description of a new flag:

With &quot;perestroika&quot; in force, the Moldovan nationalism came in place with the Popular Front of Moldova being involved. On 27 April 1990, the new flag of the Moldavian SSR consisted of the Romanian tricolor with the emblem of the Moldavian SSR in the centre. However, it was decided to use the flag without the emblem until new symbols were worked on. When the Moldavian SSR declared sovereignty in June 1990, the new flag was adopted on 6 November 1990 and remains the flag of Moldova to this day.

=== Use in Transnistria ===
The breakaway Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (PMSSR) retained the 1952 flag when it declared its separation from the Moldavian SSR on 2 September 1990. On 5 November 1991, the PMSSR dropped &quot;Soviet Socialist&quot; from its name, becoming the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR), commonly known in English as Transnistria. The former flag of the Moldavian SSR was officially adopted by the internationally unrecognized state as its state flag on 18 July 2000.

<text>Environmental chemistry is the scientific study of the chemical and biochemical phenomena that occur in natural places. It should not be confused with green chemistry, which seeks to reduce potential pollution at its source. It can be defined as the study of the sources, reactions, transport, effects, and fates of chemical species in the air, soil, and water environments; and the effect of human activity and biological activity on these. Environmental chemistry is an interdisciplinary science that includes atmospheric, aquatic and soil chemistry, as well as heavily relying on analytical chemistry and being related to environmental and other areas of science.

Environmental chemistry involves first understanding how the uncontaminated environment works, which chemicals in what concentrations are present naturally, and with what effects. Without this it would be impossible to accurately study the effects humans have on the environment through the release of chemicals.

Environmental chemists draw on a range of concepts from chemistry and various environmental sciences to assist in their study of what is happening to a chemical species in the environment. Important general concepts from chemistry include understanding chemical reactions and equations, solutions, units, sampling, and analytical techniques.

==Contaminant==
A contaminant is a substance present in nature at a level higher than fixed levels or that would not otherwise be there. This may be due to human activity and bioactivity. The term contaminant is often used interchangeably with &quot;pollutant&quot;, which is a substance that detrimentally impacts the surrounding environment. While a contaminant is sometimes a substance in the environment as a result of human activity, but without harmful effects, it sometimes the case that toxic or harmful effects from contamination only become apparent at a later date.

The &quot;medium&quot; such as soil or organism such as fish affected by the pollutant or contaminant is called a &quot;receptor&quot;, whilst a &quot;sink&quot; is a chemical medium or species that retains and interacts with the pollutant such as carbon sink and its effects by microbes.

==Environmental indicators==
Chemical measures of water quality include dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total dissolved solids (TDS), pH, nutrients (nitrates and phosphorus), heavy metals, soil chemicals (including copper, zinc, cadmium, lead and mercury), and pesticides.

==Applications==
Environmental chemistry is used by the Environment Agency in England, Natural Resources Wales, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Association of Public Analysts, and other environmental agencies and research bodies around the world to detect and identify the nature and source of pollutants. These can include:
*Heavy metal contamination of land by industry. These can then be transported into water bodies and be taken up by living organisms such as animals and plants.
*PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon) in large bodies of water contaminated by oil spills or leaks. Many of the PAHs are carcinogens and are extremely toxic. They are regulated by concentration (ppb) using environmental chemistry and chromatography laboratory testing.
*Nutrients leaching from agricultural land into water courses, which can lead to algal blooms and eutrophication.
*Urban runoff of pollutants washing off impervious surfaces (roads, parking lots, and rooftops) during rain storms. Typical pollutants include gasoline, motor oil and other hydrocarbon compounds, metals, nutrients and sediment (soil).
*Organometallic compounds.

==Methods==

Quantitative chemical analysis is a key part of environmental chemistry, since it provides the data that frame most environmental studies.

Common analytical techniques used for quantitative determinations in environmental chemistry include classical wet chemistry, such as gravimetric, titrimetric and electrochemical methods. More sophisticated approaches are used in the determination of trace metals and organic compounds. Metals are commonly measured by atomic spectroscopy and mass spectrometry: Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission (ICP-AES) or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometric (ICP-MS) techniques. Organic compounds, including PAHs, are commonly measured also using mass spectrometric methods, such as Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Tandem Mass spectrometry MS/MS and High Resolution/Accurate Mass spectrometry HR/AM offer sub part per trillion detection. Non-MS methods using GCs and LCs having universal or specific detectors are still staples in the arsenal of available analytical tools.

Other parameters often measured in environmental chemistry are radiochemicals. These are pollutants which emit radioactive materials, such as alpha and beta particles, posing danger to human health and the environment. Particle counters and Scintillation counters are most commonly used for these measurements. Bioassays and immunoassays are utilized for toxicity evaluations of chemical effects on various organisms. Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR is able to identify species of bacteria and other organisms through specific DNA and RNA gene isolation and amplification and is showing promise as a valuable technique for identifying environmental microbial contamination.

==Published analytical methods==
Peer-reviewed test methods have been published by government agencies and private research organizations. Approved published methods must be used when testing to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements.

<text>The flag of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic was the red Soviet flag with white and green stripes below the gold hammer and sickle, with the measures: 1/2 red, 1/5 white, 1/10 green, 1/5 red. The flag sported the Pan-Iranian colors of red, white and green, as a nod to the republic&#x27;s Persian-descended culture. The flag was adopted on March 20, 1953 by decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Tajik SSR: 

The red represents the unity of the republic and the aspect of workers&#x27; revolution, white symbolized cotton production, the basis of Tajik agriculture, and the green was for other agricultural produce.

After 1953, the flag received a unique reverse side. The reverse side of the flag was the same as the obverse with the exception of it lacking the yellow hammer and sickle. In 1991, after Tajikistan became an independent country, this flag was used until a new flag was created and adopted in 1992.

==Historical flags==
The first specifically Tajik flag was introduced in 1929. Before that, Tajikistan had been part of the Bukharan SSR (partly transferred to the Turkestan SSR in 1924); before the Russian revolution it had been part of the Emirate of Bukhara (since 1873 a protectorate of the Russian Empire).

Following independence on September 9, 1991, the flag of the Tajik SSR remained in use as the alternative national flag of Tajikistan until a new Tajik flag was adopted in November 1992, becoming the last post-Soviet country to receive a completely new flag.

<text>The State Flag of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted on 1 August 1953 and was replaced with the current flag of Turkmenistan in 1992. Although similar to the Flag of the Soviet Union, the layout is identical to the flag of the Kirghiz SSR with a ratio of 1:2. The two blue stripes () between the red () represents the rivers Amu Darya and Syr Darya, the red represents the &quot;revolutionary struggle of the working masses&quot;, the hammer and sickle represents the peasants&#x27; and workers&#x27; union, and the red star is the symbol of the ruling Communist Party.

In 1926, the Turkmen flag was red with a large gold hammer and sickle in the top-left corner, similar to the flag of the Soviet Union. From 1937, the flag was red with the Latin characters (&quot;T.S.S.R.&quot;) in gold in the top-left corner, in a sans-serif font. From the 1940, the flag was the same, but with the characters in Cyrillic characters &quot;ТССР&quot; (&quot;TSSR&quot;).

On 26 September 1973, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Turkmen SSR modified the regulation of the flag of Turkmen SSR. The position of the star and hammer and sickle was moved closer to the flag pole.

Between independence in 1991 and adoption of the new flag in February 1992, this flag remained the national flag of independent Turkmenistan.

== History ==
=== Early project flags ===

During the creation of the Constitution of the Turkmen SSR, a draft design for the flag of Turkmen SSR was created. The proposed flag was a red rectangular cloth depicting a golden sickle and hammer under the red 5-pointed star with a gold border and with drawings of four carpet gels on the main flag. But in the process of discussing the draft, this proposal was rejected.
=== First version ===
On 6 October 1926, the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of the Turkmen SSR adopted the Constitution of the Turkmen SSR, which was then approved by the 2nd All-Turkmen Congress of Soviets on 30 March 1927.

The flag was described on the Article 83 of the Constitution :

=== Second version ===
On March 2, 1937, the Extraordinary 6th Congress of Soviets of the Turkmen SSR adopted a new Constitution of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic. The flag of the Turkmen SSR is described in Chapter X, Article 122 of the constitution :

==== Revision ====

In May 1940, the Turkmen script was translated from the Latinized alphabet into the alphabet based on the Russian alphabet. On July 19, 1940, by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Turkmen SSR &quot;On the inscription on the national flag of the Turkmen SSR,&quot; it was approved &quot;to change the text of the inscription in accordance to the new alphabet.&quot; The Article 122 was changed in accordance to this decree:

=== Third version ===
On August 1, 1953, by the Decree &quot;On the State Flag of the Turkmen SSR&quot;, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Turkmen SSR decided:

In accordance with this decree, the Constitution of the Turkmen SSR was amended. The design of the new flag is described in Article 122 of the constitution :

On May 16, 1956, the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Turkmen SSR approved the Regulations on the State Flag of the Turkmen SSR, in which it was specified that :

On September 20, 1966, by the Decree of the Presidium of the Armed Forces of the Turkmen SSR, the provision on the Turkmen SSR flag was supplemented: the list of holidays on which the flag of the republic was required was changed.

Approved by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of the TSSR on September 26, 1973 (Resolution No. 353), the Instruction on the use of the Regulations on the State Flag of the Turkmen SSR, among other things, stipulated the possibility of raising the TSSR flag on sea vessels (forstenge) and on self-propelled vessels sailing (on bow mast) when they are the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Turkmen SSR, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the TSSR or other officials representing the Supreme Council of the TSSR and the Council of Ministers of the TSSR.
==== Revision ====
On September 23, 1974, by a Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Turkmen SSR, an amendment was made to the Regulations on the State Flag of the Turkmen SSR of 1956, which established a reduction in the side of the square into which the sickle and hammer fit, from of the flag&#x27;s width to of the flag&#x27;s width, and reducing the distance from the vertical axis of the star, sickle and hammer to the pole edge of the cloth from of the flag&#x27;s width to of the flag&#x27;s width, as a result of which the size of the sickle and hammer emblem decreased and was shifted closer to the flagpole.

On April 13, 1978, the extraordinary 9th session of the Supreme Soviet of the Turkmen SSR of the 9th convocation adopted a new Constitution of the Turkmen SSR. The flag was described in article 169 of the Constitution:

This description of the flag on May 6, 1978 by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Turkmen SSR was included in the Regulations on the State Flag of the Turkmen SSR of 1956, which was amended by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on September 23, 1974.

<doc id="656985" wikidata="Q877588" url="?curid=656985" title="Flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic">
<text>The first flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (UkSSR) was adopted on 10 March 1919 to serve as the symbol of state of the Ukrainian SSR. Details of the official flag changed periodically before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, but all had as their basis the communist red flag. According to the decree of the Presidium of Supreme Soviet of Ukrainian SSR on 21 November 1949, the blue in the bottom &quot;symbolises the mightiness and beauty of the people, and the blue banner of Bohdan Khmelnytsky&quot;.

==Color scheme==
==History==
Before this 1919 flag, a flag in 1918 was used with red and blue, with yellow stripes in the canton.

The first flag was red with the gold Cyrillic sans-serif letters У.С.С.Р. (&quot;USSR&quot;, acronym for &quot;Ukrayinskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Sovetskaya Respublika&quot; (Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic) in the Russian language). A decade later, the Ukrainian initials У.С.Р.Р. appeared (&quot;USRR&quot;, for &quot;Ukrayinsʹka Sotsialistychna Radyansʹka Respublika&quot;). In the 1930s a gold border was added. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif letters УРСР (the name had changed, transposing the second and third words).

The Soviet Union and two of its republics (Ukraine and Byelorussia) all became members of the nascent United Nations (UN) in 1945. Since all of their flags were red with only small markings in the upper left corner, the UN demanded changes to the flags in 1949. To comply, the Ukrainian Soviet authorities dropped the lettering and added an azure horizontal stripe ( of the width). The Ukrainian SSR adopted this new design as its official flag on 5 July 1950. Other constituent republics of the Soviet Union soon followed suit and customised the bottom third of their flags.

While the Soviet flag was flown in the later months of 1991, even after the failed coup d&#x27;état, the blue and yellow flag, even though it was a criminal offense under the Soviet law, was raised spontaneously throughout Ukraine by local activists between 14 March 1990 beginning at town of Stryi until the country&#x27;s independence on 24 August 1991. The blue and yellow flag was provisionally adopted for official ceremonies in September 1991, although the Soviet-era flag officially remained until it was replaced on 28 January 1992.
===Russo-Ukrainian War===
In 2015, all Soviet symbolism, including the flags of the Ukrainian SSR, was recognized as a symbol of the totalitarian past and officially banned in Ukraine. Despite the ban, the flags of the Ukrainian SSR have been used in the some areas occupied by Russia during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

<doc id="656987" wikidata="Q1063386" url="?curid=656987" title="Flag of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic">
<text>The flag of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted on 29 August 1952. The red represents the &quot;revolutionary struggle of the working masses&quot;, the hammer and sickle represents the peasants&#x27; and workers&#x27; union, and the red star is the symbol of the communist party. There is no official explanation for the symbolic meanings of other elements. However, in some material the white stripes represent cotton, the blue band represents Amu Darya and irrigation in general.

Before that, from 9 January 1926, the flag was about the same, but with the country&#x27;s name in Uzbek, Russian and Tajik.

The first flag was hoisted on 22 July 1925 and was red, with the country&#x27;s name in Arabic and the Cyrillic characters &quot;УзССР&quot; in the top-left corner in gold. Between 1931 and 1937, the flag was very similar, but with the Uzbek abbreviation &quot;OzSSC&quot;, and its Russian equivalent: &quot;УзССР&quot;.

Between 14 February 1937 and the adoption of the flag in the 1940s, the flag was the same, but with the Uzbek country&#x27;s name in Latin characters: &quot;OZBEKISTAN SSR.&quot; In 1940, the flag was red with the country&#x27;s name in both Uzbek (Ўзбекистон ССР, &quot;Oʻzbekiston SSR&quot;) and Russian (Узбекская ССР, &quot;Uzbekskaya SSR&quot;) languages in gold in the top-left corner.

The last Uzbek SSR flag was adopted on 29 August 1952. Although the flag is visually identical to the Soviet flag, the red panel has a light blue (azure) down the middle of the whole flag length. At the edges of the light blue stripes are narrow white. The blue stripe with white edges is 1/5 (one-fifth) of the flag width. The specification amendments were accepted on 27 September 1974 and 30 June 1981.

On 31 August 1991, the Uzbek SSR was renamed to the Republic of Uzbekistan and the flag remained in use until 18 November 1991.

== History ==
=== First version ===
On July 22, 1925, the Central Executive Committee (CEC) of the Soviets of the Uzbek SSR adopted Resolution No. 67 &quot;On the Emblem and Flag of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic&quot;. The resolution approved the first flag of the Uzbek SSR with the following description :

The 2nd All-Uzbek Congress of Soviets on March 31, 1927, adopted the Constitution of the Uzbek SSR, which was published on July 11, 1927. The flag is described in chapter 113:


==== First revision ====
In 1927, the 4th session of the CEC of the Soviets of the Uzbek SSR amended Article 113 of the Constitution of the Uzbek SSR. The name of republic was depicted in Uzbek and Tajik language.

==== Second revision ====

On May 9, 1929, the 3rd All-Uzbek Congress of Soviets approved the changes made by the 4th session of the CEC in 1927. The inscription of the name of the republic in Tajik and Uzbek were depicted in Latin alphabet.

==== Third revision ====

On 5 December 1929, the Tajik ASSR was transformed into the Tajik SSR and removed from the Uzbek SSR. In accordance with this, references to the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic were excluded from the Constitution of the Uzbek SSR, including the inscription in the Tajik language in the description of the flag of the Uzbek SSR.

The new version of the Constitution of the Uzbek SSR was adopted on February 28, 1931, at the 4th All-Uzbek Congress of Soviets in the city of Tashkent. The new version of the flag was described in the Article 103 of the Constitution. 
==== Fourth revision ====

From 1934, the spelling of the initial letters in the name of the republic in the Uzbek language and in the translation of the word &quot;socialist&quot; has changed. The change resulted in the initial name of the republic &quot;Өzвekistan Ьҫtьmaьь Şoralar Ҫymhyrijәti (ӨZ.Ь.Ş.Ç)&quot; to &quot;Ozвekistan Sotsialistik Sovet Ҫumhurijәti (OZ.S.S.Ҫ)&quot;.

==== Fifth revision ====

From 1935, the translation of the word &quot;republic&quot; into the Uzbek language has changed. This change resulted in the change of the name of the republic : from &quot;Ozвekistan Sotsialistik Sovet Ҫumhurijәti (OZ.S.S.Ҫ)&quot; to &quot;Ozвekistan Sotsialistik Sovet Respublikasi (OZ.S.S.R)&quot;

=== Second version ===
On February 14, 1937, the Extraordinary 6th All-Uzbek Congress of Soviets approved the new Constitution of the Uzbek SSR. The flag was described in Article 144 of the Constitution:


==== First revision ====
On 23 July 1938, the constitution of the Uzbek SSR was amended. The name of the country in Uzbek &quot;Ozʙekistan SSR&quot; was changed into &quot;Ozʙekstan SSR&quot;.

==== Second revision ====
On May 8, 1940, the 3rd session of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR adopted a law on transition to the alphabet on the basis of Cyrillic alphabet.

On January 16, 1941, by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR, the text of the inscription on the state flag of the Uzbek SSR was translated into Russian alphabet.

=== Third version ===

On August 29, 1952, a new flag design, designed by the Uzbek artist Anatoly Kuzmich Osheyko was approved, by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR.

By the Law of the Uzbek SSR of May 30, 1953, this decree was approved. The flag description in Article 144 of the Constitution of the Uzbek SSR was amended to include the design of the new flag.

On October 31, 1955, the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR &quot;On the Procedure for Raising the State Flag of the Uzbek SSR&quot; was adopted. By the Decree of the PVS of the Uzbek SSR of November 30, 1966, the Decree was amended.
On September 27, 1974, the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR approved the Regulations on the State Flag of the Uzbek SSR, which, in clarifying and supplementing the description of the flag in the Constitution, established:

By the Decree of the Council of Ministers of the Uzbek SSR of October 14, 1974, the instruction on the application of the Regulations on the State Flag of the Uzbek SSR was introduced.

The amendment to the decree &quot;On the State Flag of the Uzbek SSR&quot; was approved by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR dated June/July 30, 1981. According to the amended decree, the reverse side of the flag was still the same, but without any hammer and sickle.

==== Symbolism ====
There was no official explanation of the symbolism of the flag. In various publications, white stripes represents the cotton-growing fields, and the blue bar represents the Amudarya river and irrigation in Uzbekistan. Another source describes the blue bar as the symbol of Pan-Turkism, as seen in the flag of the Turkic Council, although Uzbekistan was against Pan-Turkism in the USSR.

=== Fourth version ===

A search for a national flag began soon after, with a contest being held to determine the new design. More than 200 submissions were made, and a commission was formed in order to evaluate these suggestions coming from a variety of stakeholders. The winning design was adopted on 18 November 1991, after being selected at an extraordinary session of the Uzbek Supreme Soviet. In doing so, Uzbekistan became the first of the newly independent republics in Central Asia to choose a new flag. Pertaining to its tricolour combination of horizontal stripes of blue, white and green colour, it is similar to the flags of Lesotho, an enclaved country within the border of South Africa, and Puntland, a Somali federal state at the tip of the Horn.

<doc id="656993" wikidata="Q7457564" url="?curid=656993" title="Seven stages (Yogi)">
<text>According to Vedic and Hindu philosophy, every Yogi goes through seven stages of development before achieving complete liberation.
They are listed in the commentary on the Yoga Sutras by Vyasa.

==The Stages==
The seven stages are grouped into two phases:
#The first four stages form the first phase where the Yogi is liberated from the &#x27;products of mindfulness (mental) processes&#x27;,(i.e.) results of his thoughts.
#The last three stages form the second phase in which the Yogi is liberated from the mind itself.

Stage 1:

&quot;&quot;That which is to be known is known by me&quot;.&quot; 
At this stage the yogi realises that all true knowledge comes from within oneself, and the mind becomes satisfied that meditation will lead to all truth.

Stage 2:

At this stage the yogi recognises the causes of his sufferings, uses this knowledge to free himself from those causes and hence becomes free from pain.

Stage 3:

The yogi attains full discriminative knowledge of the state of samādhi, in which the Yogi is completely absorbed into The Self.

Stage 4:

The yogi no longer needs to carry out acts (religious duties) as he has attained the end of all acts through discrimination.

Stage 5:

At this stage the yogi becomes free of all waverings of the mind, (i.e.) The yogi obtains complete control over all mental processes.

Stage 6:

The mind of the yogi becomes free of the influences of external natural processes whenever he desires so.

Stage 7:

The Self of the yogi becomes identical with Purusha and the state of absolute freedom (kaivalya) is achieved.

<doc id="656994" wikidata="Q360978" url="?curid=656994" title="Suzuki Harunobu">
<text>Suzuki Harunobu (; ) was a Japanese designer of woodblock print art in the style. He was an innovator, the first to produce full-color prints () in 1765, rendering obsolete the former modes of two- and three-color prints. Harunobu used many special techniques, and depicted a wide variety of subjects, from classical poems to contemporary beauties. Like many artists of his day, Harunobu also produced a number of , or erotic images. During his lifetime and shortly afterwards, many artists imitated his style. A few, such as Harushige, even boasted of their ability to forge the work of the great master. Much about Harunobu&#x27;s life is unknown.

==Influences==


Though some scholars assert that Harunobu was originally from Kyoto, pointing to possible influences from Nishikawa Sukenobu, much of his work, in particular his early work, is in the Edo style. His work shows evidence of influences from many artists, including Torii Kiyomitsu, Ishikawa Toyonobu, the Kawamata school, and the Kanō school. However, the strongest influence upon Harunobu was the painter and printmaker Nishikawa Sukenobu, who may have been Harunobu&#x27;s direct teacher.

==Artistic career==

Little is known of Harunobu&#x27;s early life; his birthplace and birthdate are unknown, but it is believed he grew up in Kyoto. It is said he was 46 at his death in 1770. Unlike most artists, Harunobu used his real name rather than an artist name. He was from a samurai family, and had an ancestor who was a retainer of Tokugawa Ieyasu in Mikawa Province; this Suzuki accompanied Ieyasu to Edo when the latter had his capital built there. Harunobu&#x27;s grandfather Shigemitsu and father Shigekazu were stripped of their status when they were found to be involved in financing of gambling and other activities; they were exiled from Edo and relocated to Kyoto. At some point, Harunobu became a student of the master Nishikawa Sukenobu.

Harunobu began his career in the style of the Torii school, creating many works which, while skillful, were not innovative and did not stand out. It was only through his involvement with a group of literati samurai that Harunobu tackled new formats and styles.

In 1764, as a result of his social connections, he was chosen to aid these samurai in their amateur efforts to create . Calendars prints of this sort from prior to that year are not unknown but are quite rare, and it is known that Harunobu was close acquaintances or friends with many of the prominent artists and scholars of the period, as well as with several friends of the . Harunobu&#x27;s calendars, which incorporated the calculations of the lunar calendar into their images, would be exchanged at Edo gatherings and parties.

These calendar prints would be the very first (brocade prints). As a result of the wealth and connoisseurship of his samurai patrons, Harunobu exclusively created these prints using the best materials available. Harunobu experimented with better woods for the woodblocks, using cherry wood instead of catalpa, and used not only more expensive colors, but also a thicker application of the colors, in order to achieve a more opaque effect.

The most important of Harunobu&#x27;s innovations in the creation of was the use of multiple separate wood blocks in the creation of a single image, an expense afforded through the wealth of his clients. Just 20 years previously, the invention of had made it possible to print in three or four colors; Harunobu applied this new technique to prints using up to ten different colors on a single sheet of paper. The new technique depended on using notches and wedges to hold the paper in place and keep the successive color printings in register. Harunobu was the first artist to consistently use more than three colors in each print. , unlike their predecessors, were full-color images. As the technique was first used in a calendar, the year of their origin can be traced precisely to 1765.

In the late 1760s, Harunobu thus became one of the primary producers of images of (pictures of beautiful women), actors of Edo and related subjects for the Edo print connoisseur market; however, he did not produce prints of kabuki actors, reported to have said, &quot;Why should I paint pictures of such trash as Kabuki actors&quot;. In a few special cases, notably his famous set of eight prints entitled (Eight Parlor Views), the patron&#x27;s name appears on the print along with, or in place of, Harunobu&#x27;s own. The presence of a patron&#x27;s name or seal, and especially the omission of that of the artist, was another novel development in of this time.

Between 1765 and 1770, Harunobu created over twenty illustrated books and over one thousand color prints, along with a number of paintings. He came to be regarded as the master of during these last years of his life, and was widely imitated until, a number of years after his death, his style was eclipsed by that of new artists, including Katsukawa Shunshō and Torii Kiyonaga.

==Style==
In addition to the revolutionary innovations that came with the introduction of , Harunobu&#x27;s personal style was unique in a number of other respects. His figures are all very thin and light; some critics say that all his figures look like children. However, it is these same young girls who epitomize Harunobu&#x27;s personal style. Richard Lane describes this as &quot;Harunobu&#x27;s special province, one in which he surpassed all other Japanese artists - eternal girlhood in unusual and poetic settings&quot;. Though his compositions, like most prints, may be said to be fairly simple overall, it is the overall composition that concerned Harunobu. Unlike many of his predecessors, he did not seek to have the girls&#x27; kimono dominate the viewer&#x27;s attention.

Harunobu is also acclaimed as being one of the greatest artists of this period in depicting ordinary urban life in Edo. His subjects are not restricted to geisha, courtesans, actors, and sumo wrestlers, but include street vendors, errand boys, and others who help to fill in the gaps in describing the culture of this time. His work is rich in literary allusion, and he often quotes Japanese classical poetry, but the accompanying illustrations often gently poke fun at the subject.

Many of his prints have a solid, single-color background, created by a technique called . Though many other artists used the same technique, Harunobu is generally regarded as having used it to the strongest effect. The colored background sets a mood and tone for the entire image.

<doc id="656995" wikidata="Q2376216" url="?curid=656995" title="Clifton, Bristol">
<text>Clifton is an inner suburb of Bristol, England, and the name of one of the city&#x27;s thirty-five electoral wards. The Clifton ward also includes the areas of Cliftonwood and Hotwells. The eastern part of the suburb lies within the ward of Clifton Down.

Clifton is home to Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s Clifton Suspension Bridge; many buildings of the University of Bristol, including Goldney Hall; the Roman Catholic Clifton Cathedral; Christ Church, Clifton Down; Clifton College; Clifton High School; the former Amberley House preparatory school; Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital School, The Clifton Club; and Bristol Zoo. It is also noted for the Downs, a large, open park.

==Geography==
Although the suburb has no formal boundaries, the name Clifton is generally applied to the high ground stretching from Whiteladies Road in the east to the rim of the Avon Gorge in the west, and from Clifton Down and Durdham Down in the north to Cornwallis Crescent in the south. This area corresponds roughly with the Bristol City Council electoral wards of Clifton and Clifton Down, albeit with some discrepancies. The southern boundary of Clifton ward is Hotwells Road, encompassing the hillside areas that might typically be considered to be the Cliftonwood and Hotwells neighbourhoods rather than Clifton. The eastern boundary of Clifton Down ward encompasses Redland Park and Cotham Hill, which might typically be considered to be in the Redland and Cotham neighbourhoods.

Clifton has several neighbourhood focal points, including Whiteladies Road, an important shopping district to the east, and Clifton Village, a smaller shopping area near the Avon Gorge to the west.

==History==
Clifton was recorded in the Domesday book as &quot;Clistone&quot;, the name of the village denoting a &#x27;hillside settlement&#x27; and referring to its position on a steep hill. Situated to the west of Bristol city centre, it was at one time a separate settlement but became attached to Bristol by continuous development during the Georgian era and was formally incorporated into the city in the 1830s. Until 1898, Clifton St Andrew was a separate civil parish within the Municipal Borough of Bristol. In 1891 the parish had a population of 29,345. On 30 September 1896, the parish was abolished to form North Bristol.
Clifton is one of the oldest and most affluent areas of the city, much of it having been built with profits from tobacco and the slave trade. Grand houses that required many servants were built in the area. Although some were detached or semi-detached properties, the bulk were built as terraces, many with three or more floors. One famous terrace is the majestic Royal York Crescent, visible from the Avon Gorge below and looking across the Bristol docks. Berkeley Square and Berkeley Crescent, which were built around 1790, are examples of Georgian architecture. Secluded squares include the triangular Canynge Square. The Whiteladies Picture House on Whiteladies Road was converted into offices and a gymnasium in 2001 but it was re-opened as a cinema by Everyman Cinemas in 2016. Clifton Lido was built in 1850 but closed to the public in 1990, it was redeveloped and opened again to the public in November 2008.

On 17 December 1978 a bomb on Queen&#x27;s Road in Clifton detonated, injuring at least seven people. The Provisional IRA was responsible.

==Transport==

Clifton is served by Clifton Down railway station on the local Severn Beach railway line, and by frequent bus services from central Bristol. It has road links to the city centre and outer western suburbs, and across the Clifton Suspension Bridge to Leigh Woods in North Somerset. Between 1893 and 1934, it was connected to Hotwells by the Clifton Rocks Railway.

==Natural history==
Clifton has a long history of natural history television programming and global conservation, due to the presence of the former Bristol Zoo in the north of the neighbourhood, and the BBC Natural History Unit on Whiteladies Road, which means that more than 25% of the world&#x27;s wildlife programmes are made in Bristol.
&quot;Animal Magic&quot; with Johnny Morris was filmed at Bristol Zoo for the duration of the programme (1963–1983).

The UK arm of the conservation charity Ape Action Africa, which rescues and rehabilitates chimpanzees and gorillas in Cameroon, West Africa, operates out of Clifton.

==Clifton electoral ward==

Clifton electoral ward covers the central and southwestern parts of Clifton, plus Cliftonwood and the hillside areas of Hotwells as far south as Hotwells Road. The ward is represented by two members on Bristol City Council, which are Paula O&#x27;Rourke and Jerome Thomas, both of the Green Party of England and Wales.

Clifton was first created as an electoral ward at the time that the County of Avon was created in 1974, electing 1 member to Avon County Council and 3 members to Bristol City Council. The boundaries were revised in 1980 and 2016.

Before 2016, Bristol City Council used a system of elections by thirds, in which councillors sat for four year terms, but elections took place in three out of every four years, with roughly one third of seats up for election at any one time. Clifton ward therefore elected one of its two councillors at a time, in elections taking place every second year.

==In popular culture==
In Frances Burney&#x27;s novel &quot;Evelina&quot; (1778), young gentlemen are racing their phaetons on the public highways of Clifton (then still outside Bristol), and not without incident.

Part of the background to Philippa Gregory&#x27;s historical novel &quot;A Respectable Trade&quot; – dealing mainly with the slave trade in late 18th-century Bristol – is the start of construction at Clifton, then a far area outside the city limits as they were at the time. In some passages characters debate whether Clifton could ever become viable and whether investment in real estate there would not be too risky – questions which were evidently quite relevant at the time though to the modern reader the answers are obvious.

The song &quot;Clifton in the Rain&quot; by Al Stewart appears on his first album &quot;Bed-Sitter Images&quot;.

The song &quot;32 West Mall&quot;, which appeared on the 1971 album &quot;Stackridge&quot; was named after the communal flat that the band shared as their headquarters at 32 West Mall in 1970.

The 1978 children&#x27;s paranormal drama &quot;The Clifton House Mystery&quot; – produced by HTV; was set in the Clifton area. The plot revolved around a family moving into an old house; and subsequently finding a skeleton of a long-dead person in a hidden room. After some unexplained incidents, they become convinced that a ghost connected in some way with the Bristol Riots of 1831 is haunting the house. The plot is based on the story of the real-life Thomas Brereton, a Dragoon commander who committed suicide after being court-martialled for his lenient approach to suppressing the rioters; although the ghost is named &quot;George Bretherton&quot; in the TV series.

Clifton has been featured in many television sitcoms, including the late 1970s and early 1980s TV series &quot;Shoestring&quot;, which was set in Bristol and starred Trevor Eve as a radio reporter and part-time sleuth. Much of the BBC series &quot;Mistresses&quot; was set there, including the 2008, 2009 and 2010 seasons. The TV series &quot;Teachers&quot; was partly filmed in Clifton, as was teen drama &quot;Skins&quot; and &quot;Being Human&quot;. Costume drama &quot;The House of Eliott&quot; was also largely filmed in Clifton, including at Goldney Hall and Berkeley Square.

The long-running hospital drama &quot;Casualty&quot; also drew on Clifton for many scenes between 1986 and 2009, when it was filmed in Bristol.

In a 2017 episode of the American historical adventure television series Black Sails, Blackbeard played by Ray Stevenson mentions Clifton as being the home of his mother.

A number of films have also been set in Clifton, including &quot;The Truth About Love&quot; (2005) starring Dougray Scott and Jennifer Love Hewitt, &quot;The Foolish Things&quot; (2005), starring Lauren Bacall and Anjelica Huston, and &quot;Starter for 10&quot; (2006), starring James McAvoy and produced by Tom Hanks, which was filmed largely on Royal York Crescent. The 1962 film about delinquent teenagers, &quot;Some People&quot;, starring Kenneth More and Ray Brooks was filmed in and around Clifton.

==Cliftonwood==

Cliftonwood is a small suburb Bristol, bounded approximately by the Hotwells Road to the south, Jacob&#x27;s Wells Road and Constitution Hill to the East and North East, Clifton Vale to the West, and by the gardens of Goldney Hall, a University of Bristol hall of residence, to the north. Due to the geography of the area, there are only two roads in and out: Ambra Vale in the south-west corner, and Clifton Wood Road in the north-east, though there are many footpaths. On some sources the area is spelled Cliftonwood (one word), and in some Clifton Wood (two words). For elections to Bristol City Council, Cliftonwood is part of Clifton ward.

The suburb is primarily a residential area, with the only commercial premises being the Lion pub. Housing is largely large Victorian terraces, which are often painted bright colours – the coloured houses one can see when standing on Bristol&#x27;s harbourside and looking up at Cliftonwood are the backs of houses on Ambrose Road and Clifton Wood Terrace.

A medieval Jewish ritual bath known as a &quot;mikveh&quot; was discovered in 1987 in the former Hotwells Police Station bicycle shed by the Temple Local History group. This is believed to be the origin of the name Jacob&#x27;s Well, also given to the adjoining road.

<doc id="657002" wikidata="Q3934921" url="?curid=657002" title="Richie Dalmau">
<text>Raymond &quot;Richie&quot; Dalmau (born 1973 in Arecibo, Puerto Rico) is a retired basketball player from Puerto Rico, the eldest son of the legendary Raymond Dalmau. He began his professional career in 1991 with the Capitanes de Arecibo under the guidance of his father. The next year he moved to the team where his father spent his career, the Piratas de Quebradillas. 

He became a basketball star while he played with Quebradillas, earning a spot in the Puerto Rican National Team in 1995. He still holds that spot as a backing Point Guard. With the National Team he has participated in many International events, among them the 1996 Olympics and the 1998 and 2002 World Tournaments.

He participated in two Puerto Rican League Finals in the years 1999 and 2000, losing both of them to the Cangrejeros de Santurce. In 2001 he was named the League&#x27;s &quot;Most Outstanding Player&quot;. In 2002 he participated in the NBA&#x27;s National Basketball Development League (NBDL) with the Fayetteville Patriots and the Roanoke Dazzle.

By the end of the 2003 season, the Quebradillas Pirates had many financial problems and they lost the rights to all their players. Richie and his brother Ricardo moved to the Indios de Mayaguez.

For the 2005 season, the Dalmau brothers signed with the Cangrejeros de Santurce, which their father Raymond will coach. During this time Richie and his brother Ricardo won their first championship on the league in 2007. Richie signed again with the Cangrejeros de Santurce in 2007 for three years. He has two younger brothers who also play in the BSN; Christian and Ricardo.

Richie is also the founder of a rock band named &quot;Sueño de Hormiga&quot; where he plays the guitar. &quot;Sueño de Hormiga&quot; will release it first CD album during 2008 where Richie is the executive producer.

Dalmau has also contributed to improving Puerto Rico&#x27;s public education system. In 2008, he and his brother Ricardo Dalmau participated in Sapientis Week, an initiative sponsored by the non-profit Sapientis which brings distinguished public figures into classrooms in order to raise the public&#x27;s awareness of the education crisis in Puerto Rico.

==Career stats==
Dalmau&#x27;s NBA Development League stats in 14 games are 0 games started, 75 points with a 5.4 PPG, 35 assists with a 2.5 APG, 25 rebounds with a 1.8 RPG, 9 steals with a 0.6 SPG, .422 field goal percentage, .250 three point percentage and .731 free-throw percentage.

<doc id="657004" wikidata="Q3522478" url="?curid=657004" title="The Remote Part">
<text>The Remote Part is the third studio album by Scottish rock band Idlewild, released on 15 July 2002 by Parlophone. As they were becoming increasingly aware of their label&#x27;s interest in them and their demos, the band&#x27;s musical direction was being steered by guitarist Rod Jones. For the first half of 2001, the band recorded songs with producers Stephen Street and Lenny Kaye. Due to the uneven nature of the songs done between tours, they spent some time reworking 20 tracks in the Scottish Highlands. They recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales, RAK Studios in London, and Sawmills Studios in Cornwall with producer Dave Eringa. Described as an alternative rock and indie rock record, it lacked the punk rock elements of their previous work.

Bookending two UK tours, &quot;You Held the World in Your Arms&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on 15 April 2002. The second and third singles &quot;American English&quot; and &quot;Live in a Hiding Place&quot; were released on 1 July and 21 October 2002, respectively. During a stint of Europe, bassist Bob Fairfoull left the band, and was temporarily replaced by technician Alex Grant. They then supported Coldplay on their tours of the UK and Europe. In November 2002, Gavin Fox of Turn and touring guitarist Allan Stewart joined as official members. Two further tours of the UK followed in late 2002 and early 2003; they then went on a headlining US tour, before supporting Pearl Jam in that territory for two months.

&quot;The Remote Part&quot; received universal acclaim from music critics, some of whom praised the band&#x27;s energy and songwriting. The album peaked at number two in Scotland, and number three in the UK, as well as charting in France and Ireland. It would later be certified gold in the UK. All of the songs appeared within the top 30 of the Scottish and UK Singles Charts, with &quot;You Held the World in Your Arms&quot; charting the highest at number four in the former, and number nine in the latter.

==Background and writing==
Idlewild released their second studio album &quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; in April 2000, which was produced by Dave Eringa. It peaked at number 15 in the UK, while all of its four singles appeared on the UK Singles Chart, with &quot;Actually It&#x27;s Darkness&quot; reaching the highest at number 23. With the making of the album, the band became aware of how invested their record label was with the band, and their feedback in regards to demos. Frontman Roddy Woomble acknowledged that the band had been working towards anthemic tracks, and was confident they would pull them off.

They promoted &quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; with a UK tour, a supporting slot for Muse on their headlining European tour, and appearances at the Glastonbury, T in the Park and Witnness festivals. Woomble noted that the band felt like &quot;a collective of songwriters&quot; during the writing process for the next album. He credits guitarist Rod Jones with influencing their musical direction, stating that Jones &quot;really started to take steps forward in terms of his guitar playing, and also his harmonies&quot;. In August 2000, the band debuted three songs during a hometown show, all three of which leaned towards a 1980s sound; further material was aired during a UK tour.

==Production==
In January and February 2001, Idlewild had recorded seven songs with producer Stephen Street at Linford Manor in Milton Keynes, prior to a tour of the United States in March and April 2001. They then supported Placebo on their US tour in April and May 2001. Idlewild were unhappy with the material with they did with Street and decided to start again; Woomble said Parlophone were not satisfied with the results. They spent a day with producer Lenny Kaye, who Woomble found to be very enthusiastic about the material they had, in Brooklyn, New York City rearranging the songs. They then recorded at Magic Studios in New York City with Kaye over the course of a week in June 2001; by this point, they had nine tracks in total. Woomble said Kaye was helped in his development as a songwriter, as Kaye aiding him in focusing on his lyrics, which no prior producer assisted in.

By the end of June 2001, they had returned to the UK, and were mixing the material they did with Street at Townhouse in London. They were scheduled to tour the US again in July and August 2001; however, due to Jones requiring hospitalisation for three weeks for an unspecified injury, it was cancelled. In August 2001, they spent two and a half weeks writing and re-doing 20 songs at a cottage in Inchnadamph, located in the Scottish Highlands. Following appearances at the V and Gig on the Green festivals that same month, the band continued working. Ten of the songs they had at this stage &quot;weren&#x27;t fitting together&quot;, according to Woomble, due to being recorded in between separate tours. EMI, who owned Palophone, approved of the demos they had done and allowed them to restart the album with Eringa as the producer. Following this, they practiced in Edinburgh, before traveling down to Wales in September 2001.

The band and Eringa recorded at Rockfield Studios in Monmouthshire, Wales; sessions progressed slowly, and by the end of the month, Parlophone were still not content with the results. In October and November 2001, they recorded at Sawmills Studios in Cornwall; Woomble said these sessions &quot;need[ed] to matter [...] People expect something from us, and yet we never seem to be able to convince them&quot;. Following this, they went to London, where they recorded at RAK Studios in December 2001. After a brief break at home for Christmas, they returned to RAK in January 2002; it was during this period that Parlophone finally gave the band their approval. Eringa, with engineer Guy Massey, produced nearly all of the final recordings on the album; him and Massey produced &quot;Live in a Hiding Place&quot; together, while Street produced &quot;Tell Me Ten Words&quot; while Cenzo Townshend as engineer. Sixteen tracks were recorded in total across all of the studios. Eringa mixed all of the recordings in January 2002 with assistant Dan Grech-Marguerat, prior to the album being mastered by Howie Weinberg at Masterdisk in New York City the following month.

==Composition and lyrics==
Musically, the sound of &quot;The Remote Part&quot; has been described as alternative rock and indie rock, with influence from Nirvana, Joni Mitchell, and Red House Painters. Its big sound was compared to that of &quot;Out of Time&quot; (1991) by R.E.M. It lacked any of the punk rock traits of the band&#x27;s previous releases, utilizing more layers of vocals and guitars, alongside the addition of keyboards and strings. Discussing the album&#x27;s title, Woomble said it came up during a conversation with poet laureate Edwin Morgan; it was originally named &quot;Scottish Fiction&quot; and then &quot;Living in Fiction&quot;, before being christened &quot;The Remote Part&quot;. Jones said they had planned to make a double album, where all of the electric songs would be on the first half and all the acoustic ones would be on the second part, though he was unsure as to when this idea was dropped. He considered the time they spent in Inchnadamph to be important to the development of their style, embracing the pop sensibility of their sound, which he said was always present albeit in a reduced manner.

The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;You Held the World in Your Arms&quot;, features a string arrangement by Sally Herbert, and a synthesizer. It was the first song the band had written when they were in the Scottish Highlands. The song initially lacked the instrumental section that opened it, instead beginning with the slow verse. After some feedback from the label, Eringa attached the chorus as the opening part. The power pop track &quot;A Modern Way of Letting Go&quot; was compared to the work of the Foo Fighters and echoed the band&#x27;s roots. It was Woomble&#x27;s attempt at &quot;deconstruct[ing] the idea of a rock song in a rock song&quot;. The U2-esque ballad &quot;American English&quot; uses acoustic guitarwork and piano. When first working on the song with Kaye, it lasted for longer and featured a spoken-word portion. It is about American poet Walt Whitman, the role an author can play in their song, and how meanings can be distorted.

&quot;I Never Wanted&quot;, co-written between the band, previous guitarist Jeremy Mills, and touring guitarist Allan Stewart, is a mid-tempo ballad that is reminiscent of &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; (1999)-era Flaming Lips. The Ash-indebted &quot;(I Am) What I Am Not&quot; was influenced by the writing of Fernando Pessoa in his book &quot;The Book of Disquiet&quot; (1982). &quot;Live in a Hiding Place&quot; is an acoustic track with piano during the chorus sections. &quot;Out of Routine&quot; was originally titled &quot;Ceilidh Hard&quot;, which was named after &quot;Party Hard&quot; (2001) by Andrew W.K. &quot;Century After Century&quot; is a mid-tempo song; &quot;Tell Me Ten Words&quot; evokes the sound of R.E.M., and opens with a country-like guitar intro. &quot;Stay the Same&quot; is a hard rock song. The album&#x27;s closing track &quot;In Remote Part/Scottish Fiction&quot; ends with a spoken-word narrative from Morgan about the band&#x27;s Scottish identity. When first contacting Morgan, Woomble had sent him a letter where he told him of his admiration for Morgan&#x27;s work. Woomble had been a fan of Morgan&#x27;s since his teenage years, and detailed identity and belonging in his letter. Morgan replied with his own letter, which concluded with a poem that ended up becoming &quot;Scottish Fiction&quot;.

==Release==
On 27 February 2002, &quot;The Remote Part&quot; was announced for release in five months&#x27; time. They went on a short tour of the United Kingdom a week later. They embarked on a longer UK tour April and May 2002. They appeared at T in the Park and Glastonbury Festival. &quot;The Remote Part&quot; was released on 15 July 2002 through Parlophone. The concept for the artwork was done by Woomble; it consists of an image from the film &quot;My Way Home&quot; (1978), which was provided by the British Film Institute. The liner notes include the phrase &quot;support your local poet&quot;, to which Woomble explained it was satire as they had been &quot;tagged as this &#x27;lyrical/poetic&#x27; band&quot;. It was promoted with in-store performances and signings at Virgin Megastores.

Following this, the band appeared at V festival in August 2002. In September and October 2002, the band went on a tour of Europe. On 1 October 2002, it was announced that bassist Bob Fairfoull had left the band, and was temporarily replaced by bass technician Alex Grant. Fairfoull, who later joined Degrassi, reportedly quit the band following a fight with Woomble; he did not like the direction the band&#x27;s music was going in. For the rest of the month, the band supported Coldplay on their UK arena tour and then in Europe. On 20 November 2002, it was announced that Gavin Fox of Turn would permanently fill Fairfoull&#x27;s role. Alongside this, Stewart, who had been part of the band&#x27;s crew, became their full-time guitarist.

In spite of Fox&#x27;s addition, Grant still continued on bass through to the band&#x27;s December 2002 UK tour, which was supported by the Walkmen and labelmates the Star Spangles. In January and February 2003, the band went on another tour of the UK, leading up to a performance at the 2003 NME Awards. Following this, they embarked on a tour of Australia. &quot;The Remote Part&quot; was released in the US by Capitol Records on 25 March 2003; fans were given a promotional EP that featured &quot;You Held the World in Your Arms&quot;, &quot;The Nothing I Know&quot;, &quot;Everything Flows&quot; and a live version of &quot;In Remote Part/Scottish Fiction&quot;. The band went on a headlining tour of that territory in the same month, appeared at Coachella, and had a supporting slot for Pearl Jam on their US arena tour in May and June 2003. During this trek, the band performed on &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot; and &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. Soon afterwards, the band performed at the Glastonbury, Move, Frequency and T in the Park festivals.

===Singles===
&quot;You Held the World in Your Arms&quot; was released as a single on 15 April 2002. Two versions were released on CD: the first with &quot;All This Information&quot;, &quot;No Generation&quot;, and the music video for &quot;You Held the World in Your Arms&quot;, while the second included &quot;A Distant History&quot; and &quot;I Was Made to Think It&quot;. The &quot;You Held the World in Your Arms&quot; music video was posted on &quot;Dotmusic&quot; four days later; it was directed by Sam Arthur. &quot;American English&quot; was released as a single on 1 July 2002. Two versions were released on CD: the first with &quot;Poor Thing&quot;, &quot;These Are Just Years&quot;, and the music video for &quot;American English&quot; (directed by Alex Smith), while the second featured &quot;The Nothing I Know&quot; and &quot;We Always Have to Impress&quot;.

&quot;Live in a Hiding Place&quot; was released as a single on 21 October 2002. Two versions were released on CD: the first with &quot;Great Times Wasted&quot;, &quot;Everything Flows&quot;, and the music video for &quot;Live in a Hiding Place&quot; (directed by Wim Wenders), while the second included &quot;I Found That Essence Rare&quot;, and a live version of &quot;I&#x27;m Happy to Be Here Tonight&quot;. &quot;A Modern Way of Letting Go&quot; was released as a single on 10 February 2003. The CD version included version versions of &quot;A Modern Way of Letting Go&quot; and &quot;In Remote Part/Scottish Fiction&quot;, while the DVD edition featured audio of a radio session version of &quot;(I Am) What I Am Not&quot;, the music video for &quot;A Modern Way of Letting Go&quot; (directed by Smith), and footage of the band in New York City. &quot;A Modern Way of Letting Go&quot; was released to modern rock radio stations in the US in June 2003.

===Full-album performances and related releases===
&quot;The Remote Part&quot; was played in full in December 2008 at King Tut&#x27;s Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow as part of a series of shows where the band performed all of their albums. They performed it again across a few shows in 2017 and 2018, one of which featured Fairfoull. It was released as a two-CD package with their &quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; in 2011. &quot;You Held the World in Your Arms&quot;, &quot;American English&quot;, &quot;A Modern Way of Letting Go&quot;, &quot;In Remote Part/Scottish Fiction&quot;, and &quot;Live in a Hiding Place&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s first compilation album, &quot;Scottish Fiction: Best of 1997–2007&quot; (2007), alongside the music videos for all of the album&#x27;s singles. &quot;A Modern Way of Letting Go&quot;, &quot;American English&quot;, and a live version of &quot;American English&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s third compilation album, &quot;The Collection&quot; (2010).

==Reception==

&quot;The Remote Part&quot; was met with universal acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 83, based on 20 reviews.

John Donohue of &quot;Blender&quot; said that the band could not use &quot;goonish rockers&quot; as a pretence anymore as their &quot;romantic natures have taken over, to great effect&quot;. He added that the band &quot;show their true smarts by continuing to attack every track with youthful energy and passion&quot;. Chris Long for BBC Manchester Music noted that there was &quot;moments when you think the band&#x27;s fallen into only being able to write fast rock or slow ballad, and there&#x27;s nothing in-between, [...] but it never lasts long enough to offend&quot;. AllMusic reviewer MacKenzie Wilson wrote that the band had found what they were looking for: &quot;a beautiful calmness and a comfortable spot to reflect upon – and The Remote Part flawlessly does the job&quot;. She added that it was &quot;obvious&quot; based on their earlier material that the band were &quot;headed to this point in their career&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; Brian M. Raftery found the album to be a &quot;perfectly fine collection of emotive, big-ambition British rock songs&quot;.

In a review for &quot;NME&quot;, Mark Beaumont saw the album as a &quot;bold, bright, broken and bitter beast&quot; that showcases a band that &quot;burst out of their student-sheep’s clothing and rip the throat out of Coldplay&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Gaylord Fields said the band &quot;ratchet up the latent R.E.M.-isms, elevating themselves heads above their musical kin&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; contributor Rob Mitchum saw the album&#x27;s potential for &quot;alt-rock hits [...] where each and every song could be a single&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; music correspondent Dave Simpson noted that the album was &quot;musically anthemic but lyrically introspective&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; Andrew Beaujon wrote that the band were &quot;compelling when they put Woomble&#x27;s sad-sack lyrics front and center,&quot; though on a few songs, their &quot;turgid squall swamps his words&quot;.

&quot;The Remote Part&quot; charted at number two in Scotland, and number three in the UK. It also reached number 39 in Ireland, and number 135 in France. &quot;You Held the World in Your Arms&quot; charted at number four in Scotland, and number nine in the UK. &quot;American English&quot; charted at number eight in Scotland, and number 15 on the UK. &quot;Live in a Hiding Place&quot; charted at number 17 in Scotland, and number 26 in the UK. &quot;A Modern Way of Letting Go&quot; charted at number 21 in Scotland, and number 28 in the UK. &quot;The Remote Part&quot; was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Playlouder ranked the album at number 10 on their list of the top 50 albums of 2002.

<doc id="657005" wikidata="Q538380" url="?curid=657005" title="Gorillaz (album)">
<text>Gorillaz is the debut studio album by English virtual band Gorillaz, released on 26 March 2001 in the United Kingdom by Parlophone and June 19, 2001 in the United States by Virgin Records. The album reached number three in the UK and number fourteen in the US, later being certified platinum in the US and triple-platinum in the UK. &quot;Gorillaz&quot; has sold over seven million copies worldwide. The album&#x27;s success earned the group an entry in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the &quot;Most Successful Virtual Band&quot;, and spawned the singles &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;, &quot;19-2000&quot;, &quot;Rock the House&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot;.

==Background==

Musician Damon Albarn and comic book creator Jamie Hewlett met in 1990 when guitarist Graham Coxon, a fan of Hewlett&#x27;s work, asked him to interview Blur, a band Albarn and Coxon had recently formed. The interview was published in &quot;Deadline&quot; magazine, home of Hewlett&#x27;s comic strip, &quot;Tank Girl&quot;. Hewlett initially thought Albarn was &quot;arsey, a wanker&quot;; despite becoming acquaintances with the band, they often did not get on, especially after Hewlett began seeing Coxon&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Jane Olliver. Despite this, Albarn and Hewlett started sharing a flat on Westbourne Grove in London in 1997. Hewlett had recently broken up with Olliver and Albarn was at the end of his highly publicised relationship with Justine Frischmann of Elastica.

The idea to create Gorillaz came about when Albarn and Hewlett were watching MTV. Hewlett said, &quot;If you watch MTV for too long, it&#x27;s a bit like hell – there&#x27;s nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a cartoon band, something that would be a comment on that.&quot; The band originally identified themselves as &quot;Gorilla&quot; and the first song they recorded was &quot;Ghost Train&quot; which was later released as a B-side on their single &quot;Rock the House&quot; and the B-side compilation &quot;G-Sides&quot;. The musicians behind Gorillaz&#x27; first incarnation included Albarn, Del the Funky Homosapien, Dan the Automator and Kid Koala, who had previously worked together on the track &quot;Time Keeps on Slipping&quot; for Deltron 3030&#x27;s eponymous debut album.

Although not released under the Gorillaz name, Albarn has said that &quot;one of the first ever Gorillaz tunes&quot; was Blur&#x27;s 1997 single &quot;On Your Own&quot;, which was released for their fifth studio album &quot;Blur&quot;.

===20th anniversary reissue===
In March 2021, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, a vinyl box set was announced. The first edition of the boxset, which was exclusive to the band&#x27;s webstore, was released on 10 December 2021. The boxset includes previously released material, including the original album, the B-sides compilation album &quot;G-Sides&quot;, and the remix album &quot;Laika Come Home&quot; (which received its first reissue since its initial press) and previously unreleased material, including live performances from the 2001 London Forum concert and five demos. Additionally, it also includes notes and early sketches by Jamie Hewlett during the making of the album. 

==Composition==
Critics have described the album as alternative rock, lo-fi, dub, hip hop, trip hop, and art pop, with elements of punk rock, rap rock, art rock, Britpop, Latin, and bubblegum pop.
The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;, is named after the famous movie actor. A interpolation of the “Rock 1” preset from the Omnichord OM-300 can be heard throughout the song. Years after the release of this album, it was revealed that the track &quot;Starshine&quot; has an alternative version, which features Luton-based rap group Phi Life Cypher. This version is not available on any releases, but it is available on the Phi Life Cypher SoundCloud channel and also on the video-sharing website YouTube.

All editions of the &quot;Gorillaz&quot; album feature an enhanced section that included screen savers, wallpaper and an autoplay, featuring a short movie which opens the user&#x27;s web browser to a special section of the Gorillaz website, which gives the user full access to Murdoc&#x27;s Winnebago.

Del the Funky Homosapien collaborated on two songs on the album, &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; and &quot;Rock the House&quot;, both of which became singles and videos and achieved chart success. Del was not originally slated to collaborate on these songs. By the time Del came onto the project, the album was already finished, and Phi Life Cypher had recorded verses for &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;; but when Del finished making &quot;Deltron 3030&quot; with Dan the Automator, Automator asked if he could stay in the studio a little longer to record new verses for the Gorillaz songs. For the purposes of the music videos and the Gorillaz storyline canon, Del performed as Gorillaz character &quot;Del the Ghost Rapper&quot;, who was said to be a spirit that was hiding from death within the band&#x27;s drummer, Russel Hobbs. Del later commented in an interview on the success of &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; by saying that he actually wrote his rap for the song using the book &quot;How to Write a Hit Song&quot;, a book that he bought with a coupon his mother gave him. After the song went platinum he gave the plaque to his mother. As part of Russel Hobbs&#x27; back-story, the character of Del was one of Russel&#x27;s friends that was gunned down in a drive-by shooting, whose ghost possessed Russel.

In 2004, the album was packaged with 2002&#x27;s &quot;Laika Come Home&quot; in a limited edition box set as part of EMI&#x27;s &quot;2CD Originals&quot; collection. Other saw a release such as the reggae-dub &quot;Dub Dumb&quot;, which features British-Jamaican artist Sweetie Irie; it is available on the PlayStation 2 game &quot;MTV Music Generator 2&quot; rather than on &quot;G-Sides&quot; or the album itself. Other tracks include &quot;Gor Beaten&quot;, which was another track that didn&#x27;t make the album; however, elements of the track&#x27;s instrumental were once available on one of the Gorillaz member&#x27;s computers in Kong Studios.

==Reception==

&quot;Gorillaz&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. It was ranked sixth in both &quot;Spin&quot;&#x27;s and &quot;Kludge&quot;&#x27;s end-of-year lists, 48 on NME&#x27;s 2001 year-end list and &quot;Q&quot; ranked it among the 50 best albums of the year. The album was nominated for the 2001 Mercury Music Prize (&quot;Gorillaz&quot; was bookmakers&#x27; favourite before the nomination was withdrawn at the band&#x27;s request).

The album made some retrospective &quot;best of&quot; lists. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked the album no. 96 in its best of the 2000s, &quot;Complex&quot;, &quot;Consequence Of Sound&quot; and &quot;Rhapsody&quot; ranked it among the top 100 albums of the 2000s and &quot;Gigwise&quot; included it in its 2013 best self-titled albums of all time. The album was given an entry in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Singles==
* &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot; was released as an EP before the album was released. A video for the single was also released.
* &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; was the first single from the album, debuting on 4 March 2001. The single peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart, number 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart.
* &quot;19-2000&quot; was the second single from the album, released in June 2001. The single peaked at number six on the UK Singles Chart and number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Modern Rock Tracks.
* &quot;Rock the House&quot; was the third single from the album, released in October 2001. The single peaked at number 18 on the UK Singles Chart.
* &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot; was the fourth and final single from the album, released almost a year after the album, in February 2002. It peaked at number 33 on the UK Singles Chart.
* &quot;5/4&quot; was repeatedly considered for a single but was edged out by &quot;19-2000&quot; and &quot;Rock the House&quot;. A video was considered for this, but never got past the storyboarding stage.

<text>Captain is the first release by the Scottish rock band Idlewild, issued by Deceptive Records in 1998. Although the number of tracks would normally classify it as an EP, &quot;Captain&quot; is commonly known as a mini-album. The guitarist Rod Jones notes that the album &quot;was a sort of introduction to Idlewild&quot;.

The album was produced by Paul Tipler in the first week of October 1997 at River Studios, London.

In an interview in 2007, Roddy Woomble spoke about the album, saying that he &quot;was singing in an American accent, y’know! Of course it’s how we found our feet – I was deeply into Tom Barman, and even though he’s Belgian he sang in an American accent, and I thought if he could do it so could I. But after the first album, I found another voice, my own voice.&quot;

The album was played in full alongside &quot;Make Another World&quot;, on 21 December 2008.

<text>Jiamusi (Manchu: ; formerly Kiamusze) is a prefecture-level city in eastern Heilongjiang province, People&#x27;s Republic of China. Located along the middle and lower reaches of the Songhua River, it faces Russia&#x27;s Khabarovsk Krai across the Ussuri River and the Heilongjiang. In 2018, Jiamusi had a GDP of RMB 101.2 billion with a 4.3% growth rate. Its population was 2,156,505 at the 2020 census whom 862,555 lived in the built up area comprising 4 urban districts.

==History==
===Early history===
In 1720, Jiamusi was first named Giyamusi (, ) during the Kangxi period by the Nanai people. The word Giyamusi originally means &quot;inn&quot; in the Manchu language. Because of the harsh climate and short growing season, the region of modern day Jiamusi was largely uncultivated.
Since the Qing government opened Manchuria for farming in order to prevent the conquest of the area by Russia, Jiamusi developed as a small trading post under the name Dongxing () since 1888. When Han Chinese and Manchu settlers began to move into the area, Jiamusi became the seat of a county administration, under the name Huachuan in 1910. However, the county seat was moved 30 miles to the north to Haoli (Hegang) after several destructive floods. After the Xinhai Revolution, as the Han Chinese continued to move in, the population of Jiamusi rose rapidly. Jiamusi continued to grow as a commercial center. As Jiamusi has become the largest harbor along the lower reaches of the Songhua River, a road system was constructed in order to provide convenient transport linking Jiamusi to several other important strongholds in northeastern China including Harbin and Nancha.

<text>Tumāḍir bint ʿAmr ibn al-Ḥārith ibn al-Sharīd al-Sulamīyah (), usually simply referred to as al-Khansāʾ (, meaning &quot;snub-nosed&quot;, an Arabic epithet for a gazelle as metaphor for beauty) was a 7th-century tribeswoman, living in the Arabian Peninsula. She was one of the most influential poets of the pre-Islamic and early Islamic periods.

In her time, the role of a female poet was to write elegies for the dead and perform them for the tribe in public oral competitions. Al-Khansāʾ won respect and fame in these competitions with her elegies, and is widely considered as the finest author of Arabic elegies and one of the greatest and best known female Arab poets of all time. In 629, she went to Medina with a deputation from her clan and, after meeting the Islamic prophet Muhammad, embraced the new religion. Her poetry was later recorded by Muslim scholars, who were studying unaltered Arabic of her time in order to explicate the language of early Islamic texts.

==Life==
Al-Khansāʾ was born and raised in the Najd in the Arabian Peninsula into a wealthy family of the tribe of Sulaym, and was the daughter of the head of the al-Sharid clan. According to both contemporary as well as later judgement, she was the most powerful female poet of her time. In pre-Islamic society, the role of a female poet, such as al-Khansā’, was to compose elegies for the tribesmen who fell in the battlefield. Her extraordinary fame rests mainly on her elegiac poetry composed for her two brothers, Sakhr and Mu‘āwiya, who were killed in tribal skirmishes of Banū Sulaym with Banū Murra and Banū Asad, predating Islam.

In 612, her brother Muʿawiyah was killed by members of another tribe. Al-Khansāʾ insisted that her brother, Ṣakhr, avenge Muʿawiyah&#x27;s death, which he did. Ṣakhr was wounded in the process and died of his wounds a year later. Al-Khansāʾ mourned her two brothers&#x27; deaths in poetry, writing over a hundred elegies about the two of them alone, and began to gain fame for her elegiac compositions, especially due to her powerful recitals. The contemporary Arab poet al-Nabigha said to her, &quot;You are the finest poet of the jinn and the humans.&quot; (). Similarly, another anecdote says that al-Nabigha told al-Khansāʾ, &quot;If Abu Basir had not already recited to me, I would have said that you are the greatest poet of the Arabs. Go, for you are the greatest poet among those with breasts&quot;. She responded by saying, &quot;I&#x27;m the greatest poet among those with testicles, too&quot;.

She was a contemporary of Muhammad, and eventually converted to Islam. It is said that Muhammad would ask her to recite some of her poetry for him, and he would love listening to her. Whenever she paused after a recital, he would gesture her to keep going and say, &quot;Go on, Khunās!&quot; Muhammad even rated al-Khansāʾ over Imru&#x27; al-Qais, the most famous poet of the classical Arabic tradition, as the one with greater poetic abilities.

She was married at least twice, and had six children, all of whom were also poets and eventually converted to Islam. Four of them, Yazīd, Muʿāwiyah, ʿAmr, and ʿAmrah, were killed in the Battle of Qadisiyah. When she received the news, she allegedly said, &quot;Praise be to God who honored me with their martyrdom. And I have hope from my Lord that he will reunite me with them in the abode of his mercy.&quot; ().

She died in 645 or 646.

== Poetry and importance in the history of Arabic literature ==
The poems of al-Khansā’ are short and marked by a strong and traditional sense of despair at the irrevocable loss of life. Apart from her poetical talent, her significance lies in having raised the early Arabic elegiac tradition to the level of qarīd poetry instead of sadj‘ or radjaz. Her style and expression, which assured her a superiority in this genre, became stereotyped in the later rithā’ poetry. As an outstanding poet and female figure in the history of Arabic literature, the position of al-Khansā’ is unique. Al-Khansa’s elegies were later collected by Ibn al-Sikkit (802–858 CE), a literary scholar of the early Abbasid era. Nearly a thousand lines of her poetry remain.

<text>The European Aquatics Championships is the continental Aquatics championship for Europe, which is organised by LEN—the governing body for aquatics in Europe. The Championships are currently held every two years (in even years) and since 2022, they have included 5 aquatics disciplines: swimming (long course/50m pool), diving, synchronised swimming, open water swimming and high diving. Prior to 1999, the championships also included water polo, which beginning in 1999 LEN split-off into a separate championships. The open water events are not held during the Olympic year.

The Championships are generally held over a two-week time-period in mid-to-late Summer, but in the most recent Summer Olympics years (2004, 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020), the Championships were moved to the Spring to be moved away from the Summer Olympic Games.

The swimming portion of these championships is considered one of the pre-eminent swimming competitions in the world. LEN also conducts an annual short-course (25 meters) swimming championship, which is a completely separate, distinct event (typically held in early December).

==Championships==
Historically, the Championships were first held in 1926, and included water polo prior to 1999 when the discipline was moved to the European Water Polo Championship. From 1973-1999 Europeans were held in years without a Summer Olympics or World Championships, save 1979 (1973 being the inception year of the World Championships; and 1999 being the last year before Worlds moved from even-years between Summer Olympics to every-odd year beginning in 2001). Women were first allowed to participate at the second Championships in 1927.
==Medal tables (1926–2024)==

While touring in support of their debut studio album &quot;Hope Is Important&quot; (1998), the band wrote and recorded its follow-up in stages. Sessions were done between May and November 1999 at a variety of studios: AIR in London, Jacob&#x27;s in Surrey, Rockfield in Wales, and Electrical Audio, Chicago. Initial recording with Bob Weston resulted in unremarkable material, by which point they switched to working with producer Dave Eringa. Described as an indie punk album, &quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; has been compared to R.E.M. and Hüsker Dü.

A tour of the United Kingdom preceded the release of the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Little Discourage&quot; on 20 September 1999. Idlewild closed the year with a tour of the United States; in March and April 2000, they went on a stint of the UK. &quot;Actually It&#x27;s Darkness&quot; was released as a single on 27 March 2000 during the latter trek. They toured Europe with Muse prior to the release of the &quot;These Wooden Ideas&quot; single on 12 June 2000. Various festival appearances followed, till later in the year when the band went on a tour of the UK. &quot;Roseability&quot; was released as a single on 16 October 2000, which was promoted with a few supporting shows for Placebo.

&quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; received generally favourable reviews from music critics, some of whom praised the songwriting and progress from their previous album. The album charted at number six in Scotland, and number 15 in the UK. It would later be certified gold in the UK. All of the songs appeared on the Scottish and UK Singles Charts, with &quot;Little Discourage&quot; charting the highest in Scotland at number 12, and &quot;Actually It&#x27;s Darkness&quot; charting the highest in the UK at number 23. &quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; appeared on an overlooked albums from the year list by &quot;Spin&quot;, and a Scottish albums of the decade list by &quot;The Skinny&quot;.

==Background and production==
Idlewild released their debut studio album &quot;Hope Is Important&quot; in October 1998. It peaked at number 53 in the UK, while all of its four singles appeared on the UK Singles Chart, with &quot;When I Argue I See Shapes&quot; reaching the highest at number 24. The band wrote and recorded their next album in sections during their 120-date promotional tour for &quot;Hope Is Important&quot;. While writing the album, he revisited Scottish folk music that he had grown up listening to prior to discarding it for nosier forms of music, as well as American rock. Between May and November 1999, recording sessions were held at AIRm Studios in London, Jacob&#x27;s Studio in Surrey, Rockfield Studios in Wales, and Electrical Audio in Chicago, Illinois.

Woomble had been enamored with bands such as June of 44 and Slint; Idlewild contacted Bob Weston and sent him some demos. Weston, who liked the demos, went to London to work with the band. Woomble said they had worked on a few tracks, &quot;but they were just so weird, and we weren&#x27;t ready for that&quot;. The band wanted direction, which they felt they were unable to due to Weston taking more of an engineer role instead of a producer. As their label Food Records disliked those songs, the band set about working with Dave Eringa, who had finished working with the Manic Street Preachers at Rockfield, and travelled to Jacob&#x27;s to meet Idlewild.

Woomble said they didn&#x27;t want to be viewed as &quot;just as a rowdy night out for teenagers&quot;; with the creation of &quot;Little Discourage&quot; and &quot;Roseability&quot;, the band had a newfound confidence. They visited Weston in Chicago to finish working on some tracks. Eringa revisited the material the band had done during their first session with Weston, and had them re-sing some vocal sections. Weston recorded &quot;Listen to What You&#x27;ve Got&quot;, &quot;Rusty&quot;, and &quot;The Bronze Medal, while Eringa produced the remaining tracks, and did additional recording for &quot;The Bronze Medal&quot;. They were assisted by John Bailey, Matt Ollivier, Lee Butler, and Willie Deans. All recordings were by mixed by Eringa at CaVa Studios in Glasgow in December 1999, except for &quot;Rusty&quot;, which was mixed by Weston in Chicago.

==Composition and lyrics==
Musically, the sound of &quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; has been described as indie punk, and was compared to 1980s alternative acts, such as R.E.M. and Hüsker Dü. Woomble said the Smiths served as a big influence on the album. The album saw Woomble sing in his own accent, in contrast to the previous releases where he leaned towards a more American vocal. Rich Hughes of &quot;The Line of Best Fit&quot; said the band got the &quot;mix perfect between their REM-influenced literary rock and their punk past&quot;. &quot;Ink 19&quot; writer Marcel Feldmar said it &quot;conjures up some of the best moments of Swervedriver, and at other moments you just get lost in the power and passion, pulling in a ferocity like the New Model Army up in arms again&quot;. Discussing the title, guitarist Rod Jones said Woomble had written it in a book sometime prior, and that it dealt the album&#x27;s topical theme of dissatisfaction. Woomble said the lyrics reference subject matter such as postmodernism, the Scottish mountains, crofting, and Gertrude Stein. He said the band were improving as songwriters, &quot;but not so much for the album to lose its raw edges&quot;. Jeff Jackson of Sonic said the lyrics bounce between &quot;straightforward declarations and enigmatic wordplay, the songs unfurl their meanings in short bursts and volleys&quot;.
&quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; opens with &quot;Little Discourage&quot;, a track that beings with a Nirvana-esque guitar part. Its call-and-response chorus section contains touches of new wave keyboards. It was one of the first songs written for the album, and initially sounded closer to &quot;You&#x27;re the Voice&quot; (1986) by John Farnham. They subsequently changed the song; its lyrics were intentionally vague, spurred on by the opening line, which Woomble had written on its own at the top of his notebook. &quot;These Wooden Ideas&quot; is critical of the music industry, and was compared to &quot;Murmur&quot; (1983)-era R.E.M. The band borrowed a keyboard and guitar from Teenage Fanclub for the song as they were recording in another room at Rockfield. &quot;Roseability&quot; is an alternative rock track; Woomble said he was inspired by a poem by Gertrude Stein. When working on a song, Woomble wanted to play along to it to come up with potential lyrics, to which Eringa said he&#x27;d &quot;give him an idea track&quot;.

The song &quot;Idea Track&quot; was subsequently named after this, and deals with optimism. Jones said it was the band&#x27;s first attempting at writing a track while at a studio. The chorus sections came about as Woomble was unable to settle on a melody that he enjoyed, so Eringa combined all six existing vocal takes into one. The bridge section features a violin performance from Jones, as they had found the instrument while at Jacob&#x27;s. &quot;Let Me Sleep (Next to the Mirror)&quot; is a mid-tempo song that recalls the early work of the Smashing Pumpkins. &quot;Listen to What You&#x27;ve Got&quot; evoked the work of the Pixies, which Woomble attributed to the American underground rock they liked. As the song was done in Chicago with Weston, Jones was able to use Steve Albini&#x27;s Travis Bean and IVP guitars to give it &quot;that buzzsaw guitar sound&quot;.

&quot;Actually It&#x27;s Darkness&quot; opens with a post-punk keyboard part, before switching into Oi!-era guitar riff, with a piano-centred bridge section. One of its lines, &quot;shed a shade of shyness&quot; was taken from a live review about Woomble, which he felt &quot;link[ed] together public and personal opinion&quot;. &quot;Rusty&quot; featured guitar riffs in the style of Fugazi, which were inspired by Shellac&#x27;s &quot;1000 Hurts&quot; (2000), and also played on the Travis Bean and IVP guitars. During one weekend, Eringa was working as a sound engineer for a Manic Street Preachers show; Idlewild got drunk in the studio, attempting to cover &quot;Save Tonight&quot; (1997) by Eagle-Eye Cherry, and wrote &quot;Mistake Pageant&quot; in the process. The album ends with the ballad &quot;The Bronze Medal&quot;, which recalled &quot;All Apologies&quot; (1993) by Nirvana.

==Release==
In July and August 1999, Idlewild played a handful of shows in mainland Europe and the UK, including an appearance at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. In September 1999, the band embarked on a tour of the UK. Coinciding with this, &quot;Little Discourage&quot; was released as a single on 20 September 1999. Two versions were released on CD: the first with &quot;A Tone&quot; and &quot;Broken Windows&quot;, while the second included &quot;1990 Nightime&quot;, and a live version of &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have the Heart&quot;. The music video for &quot;Little Discourage&quot; was directed by James and Alex. After this, they went on a headlining tour of the United States throughout the following month. On 13 January 2000, &quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; was announced for released in three months&#x27; time. In March and April 2000, the band toured across the UK; Jeremy Mills of Peeps into Fairyland served as the band&#x27;s touring guitarist for the trek.

&quot;Actually It&#x27;s Darkness&quot; was released as a single on 27 March 2000. Two versions were released on CD: the first with &quot;Meet Me at the Harbour&quot; and &quot;West Haven&quot;, while the second featured &quot;Forgot to Follow&quot;, and a cover of &quot;It&#x27;ll Take a Long Time&quot; (1972) by Sandy Denny. The music video for &quot;Actually It&#x27;s Darkness&quot; was directed by James and Alex. &quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; was released on 10 April 2000 by Food Records. The album&#x27;s booklet includes a black-and-white map of Outer Hebrides. In another part of the booklet, &quot;Subject: History&quot; is mentioned, which Woomble had a double meaning: when people inquired as to the subject matter of their songs; when they worked with Weston, the tapes had a section on the label listed as &quot;Subject&quot;, intended for the name of the band, though Weston wrote topics like geography and history.

&quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; was promoted with an instore performance at the HMV shop in Edinburgh, a one-off gig that was broadcast on Japanese TV, as well as appearances on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. They then embarked on a tour of Europe with Muse in May 2000, leading up to the single release of &quot;These Wooden Ideas&quot; on 12 June 2000. Two versions were released on CD: the first with &quot;There&#x27;s Glory in Your Story&quot; and a cover of &quot;When the Ship Comes In&quot; (1964) by Bob Dylan, while the second included an acoustic version of &quot;Actually It&#x27;s Darkness&quot;, and a cover of &quot;Rescue&quot; (1980) by Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. The music video for &quot;These Wooden Ideas&quot; was directed by James and Alex. The band played a handful of instore performances at Virgin Megastores, prior to appearances at the Glastonbury, T in the Park, Witnness, T on the Fringe and Reading and Leeds Festivals.

In between of these shows, Jones accompanied Graham Coxon on his solo tour of the UK in July 2000. In October 2000, the band went on another tour of the UK, which coincided with the release of single &quot;Roseability&quot; on 16 October 2000. Two versions were released on CD: the first with &quot;Thousand&quot;, a remix of &quot;Rusty&quot;, and the music video for &quot;Roseability&quot; (directed by Grant Gee), while the second featured a live version of &quot;I&#x27;ve Only Just Begun&quot;, and a radio session version of &quot;Self Healer&quot;. The concept for the &quot;Roseability&quot; video stemmed from the label asking if they could create a &quot;straightforward video&quot; as the previous ones were not shown till after midnight. As James and Alex were busy, the band settled on Gee, who had previously worked with other acts on Parlophone, such as Coldplay and Radiohead; they invited their fans to appear in the video. Following this, the band supported Placebo for a handful of shows. &quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; was released in the US on 13 March 2001 through Capitol and Odeon Records. &quot;Little Discourage&quot; was released to US modern rock radio stations on 11 June 2001.

&quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; was played in full in December 2008 at King Tut&#x27;s Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow as part of a series of shows where the band performed all of their albums. It was released as a two-CD package with &quot;Hope Is Important&quot; in 2002, and then with their third studio album &quot;The Remote Part&quot; in 2011. A 10th anniversary two-CD version of &quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; was released in 2010, with B-sides, demos, and radio session versions. The band performed the album in its entirety again, in 2010 in Edinburgh. &quot;Roseability&quot;, &quot;These Wooden Ideas&quot;, &quot;Let Me Sleep (Next to the Mirror)&quot;, and &quot;Little Discourage&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s first compilation album, &quot;Scottish Fiction: Best of 1997–2007&quot; (2007), alongside the music videos for all of the album&#x27;s singles. &quot;Roseability&quot;, &quot;Actually It&#x27;s Darkness&quot;, &quot;Idea Track&quot;, &quot;Little Discourage&quot;, and the remix of &quot;Rusty&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s third compilation album, &quot;The Collection&quot; (2010).

==Reception==
===Original reviews===
&quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Brian M. Raftery said Woomble&#x27;s voice was &quot;backed by rousing punk guitars and a ceaseless energy. The results are flashes of beauty and menace, often [...] in one song.&quot; Octavio Hernandez of &quot;La Opinión&quot; said it was an &quot;energetic recording&quot;, with Woomble&#x27;s &quot; brilliant voice and a rhythmic skeleton of great flavor&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; Jon Dolan wrote that the album was an &quot;astounding follow-up&quot; to &quot;Hope Is Important&quot;. The staff at &quot;NME&quot; said melody is &quot;now paramount over velocity, the rough edges of reckless spontaneity smoothed by the high-gloss patina of responsible coherence&quot;. They noted that the album &quot;gracefully enacts the sort of awkward, jarring progression another band would take several albums to complete.&quot;

Keith Gwillim of &quot;Stylus&quot; write that the band made music that is &quot;all bluster and belligerence on the surface, but goes much deeper&quot;, showcasing that they were capable of &quot;stealing from the past and making it your own&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; joint reviewers Beatty &amp; Garrett expected a repeat of &quot;Hope Is Important&quot; and were &quot;completely [...] surprise[d]&quot; as it had &quot;[n]o more screeching. No more punk-guitar chaos. No more uncomfortable strain.&quot; They added that the &quot;chord progressions are crisp and the hooks immediate.&quot; In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Chris Ryan wrote that the band &quot;grows up and gets smart&quot;, greatly &quot;step[ping] up in song-writing quality, as melody takes precedence over noise&quot;. AllMusic reviewer MacKenzie Wilson noted that the band &quot;scale back a bit&quot; on the album, while showing they had &quot;grown up&quot;. Chris Lorraine for &quot;Blender&quot; said that while it was a &quot;melodic, chorus-catchy disc&quot;, the band&#x27;s &quot;need to kick into a loud anthemic chorus on each song feels a bit by-the-book&quot;.

===Retrospective reviews===

&quot;The List&quot; writer Camilla Pia said the album was &quot;slightly out of step with the modern world and yet meant so much to those who ‘got it. &quot;Record Collector&quot; reviewer Jamie Atkins wrote that the album went on to be the band&#x27;s &quot;finest moment&quot;, with several of the tracks displaying a &quot;new maturity to their songwriting without sacrificing the abrasiveness that made their earlier records so exciting&quot;. BBC Music&#x27;s Mike Diver saw the album as a &quot;game-changer&quot; that &quot;stamped Idlewild&#x27;s identity as a highly literate, immensely able outfit whose melodies had evolved into true earworms&quot;. Dan Bean of &quot;The Press&quot; wrote that the album has &quot;dated little&quot; since its release, with &quot;Little Discourage&quot; &quot;setting the pace and style of the album&quot;. &quot;The Skinny&quot; PJ Meiklem noted that a few of tracks had &quot;all the melodic clues&quot; that would be expanded upon with their next album &quot;The Remote Part&quot;. He added that ten years removed from its release, &quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; was &quot;still a powerful record&quot;.

===Commercial performance and accolades===
&quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; peaked at number six in Scotland, and number 15 in the UK. &quot;Little Discourage&quot; charted at number 12 in Scotland, and number 24 in the UK. &quot;Actually It&#x27;s Darkness&quot; charted at number 14 in Scotland, and number 23 in the UK. &quot;These Wooden Ideas&quot; charted at number 18 in Scotland, and number 32 in the UK. &quot;Roseability&quot; charted at number 25 in Scotland, and number 38 in the UK. &quot;100 Broken Windows&quot; was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).

<text>The Revive China Society (), also known as the Society for Regenerating China or the Proper China Society was founded by Sun Yat-sen on 24 November 1894 to forward the goal of establishing prosperity for China and as a platform for future revolutionary activities, as well as the first major modern revolutionary group in Chinese history. It was formed during the First Sino-Japanese War, after a string of Chinese military defeats exposed corruption and incompetence within the imperial government of the Qing dynasty.

The Revive China Society went through several political re-organizations in later years and eventually became the party known as the Kuomintang. As such, the contemporary Kuomintang considers its founding date to be the establishment of Revive China Society.

== Development and Decline ==
Because Sun was in exile from China at the time, the Revive China Society was founded in Honolulu, Republic of Hawaii. It was the first Chinese nationalist revolutionary society. Those admitted to the society swore the following oath:
:Expel Tatar barbarians, revive Zhonghua, and establish a unified government.
:(驅除韃虜，恢復中華，創立合眾政府。)

The first member of the society was Deng Yinnan, a friend of Sun Yat-sen, and attended its founding meeting. The oath itself was established when the society was seemingly agricultural in nature. When Sun Yat-sen returned to Hong Kong in early 1895, he met up again with Yeung Ku-wan, president of the already existing Furen Literary Society, whom he had first met in 1891. As they both wanted to take advantage of the uneasy political situation due to the First Sino-Japanese War, on 18 February 1895 the Furen Literary Society was merged into the Revive China Society, with help from Yau Lit, a close friend of Sun and member of Furen. Yeung and Sun became the President and Secretary of the Society respectively. They disguised their activities in Hong Kong at 13 Staunton Street under the guise of running a business called &quot;Kuen Hang Club&quot; (乾亨行).

In October 1895, the Revive China Society planned to launch an uprising in Guangzhou, with Yeung directing the uprising in Hong Kong where funds and training location were provided by Li Ki-tong. However, plans were leaked out and more than 70 members, including Lu Haodong, a schoolboy friend of Sun Yat-sen, were captured by the Qing government. Prior to the capture, Yeung Ku-wan was elected president (or general manager) of the &#x27;United Government,&#x27; which would have been put in power given the uprising managed to overthrow the Qing monarchy, with Sun Yat-sen as the secretary.

Under pressure from the Qing government in China, the British Hong Kong government forced Yeung and Sun Yat-sen to leave, barring them from entering Hong Kong over the next five years. During this time, a branch was formed of the society in Taiwan, in early November, though they failed to garner many members, while another was formed in the Chinatown of San Francisco, with similar amounts of success. Yeung travelled to Johannesburg, South Africa, via Singapore to Chinese laborers and later to Japan, where he stayed from 1896 to 1899, to expand the Revive China Society and spread its ideas. In the summer of 1898, he met with Mariano Ponce, who was working toward the independence of the Philippines, and he expressed support for their cause.

Throughout this time, on numerous occasions did the society attempt to instigate an uprising in China, one prominent example being in the Spring and Summer of 1899, where the society attempted to incite a rebellion in Guangdong, Hunan and Hubei, where he made friends with Zhang Binglin, and smuggled guns to Ponce&#x27;s army in the Philippines, however, no uprising materialized, as his allies in Yokohama, where Sun Yat-sen had stayed and begun promoting his ideas, all were too disorganized. In the following year, the newspaper of the society, China Daily, was established, and Yat-sen began desperately working with the Guangdong Triads, as the organization began the slow process of fizzling out.

Sun Yat-sen attempted to revitalize the organization, taking trips back to Hawaii, and then to the United States, but failed to garner attention, and stayed in such conditions until it merged with the Tongmenghui and became the Kuomintang.

<text>David Widgery (27 April 1947 – 26 October 1992) was a British Marxist writer, journalist, polemicist, physician, and activist.

==Biography==
Widgery was born in Barnet and grew up in Maidenhead, Berkshire. He contracted polio as a child and was expelled from sixth form for publishing a magazine.

In 1965, Widgery met Allen Ginsberg, then visited Watts, where he encountered the civil rights movement, followed by Cuba. On return to Britain, he studied medicine at the Royal Free Hospital Medical School before writing for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and &quot;Oz&quot; magazines, becoming co-editor of &quot;Oz&quot; during 1971.

Widgery joined the International Socialists in 1967, remaining in the group when it became the Socialist Workers Party in 1977. He began working at Bethnal Green Hospital in 1972, worked at St Leonard&#x27;s Hospital in the late 1970s and later in the decade he published his first book, &quot;The Left in Britain, 1956–68&quot;.

Widgery contributed to &quot;Ink&quot;, &quot;Time Out&quot; and &quot;City Limits&quot;, also writing for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;Socialist Review&quot;, &quot;International Socialism&quot; and &quot;New Society&quot;.

He also presented a paper at the ninth symposium of the National Deviancy Conference in Sheffield (7–8 January 1972) on &quot;The Politics of the Underground&quot;.

His books include &quot;The Chatto Book of Dissent&quot; (1991), an anthology of dissident writings co-edited with Michael Rosen, &quot;Some Lives!: A GP&#x27;s East End&quot; (1991), the story of his experience as a doctor in London&#x27;s East End, &quot;The National Health: A Radical Perspective&quot;, and &quot;Beating Time&quot; (1986), an account of the Rock Against Racism movement of the late 1970s.

When Widgery died, aged 45, excess alcohol, barbiturates and pethidine were found in his bloodstream, but it is not known whether this was an accidental or intentional overdose. One obituary described Widgery as &quot;a radical humanist intellectual on permanent loan to revolutionary socialism.&quot;

<text>Archive are a musical group based in London, England, whose music spans electronic, trip hop, avant-garde, post-rock and progressive rock. Over their 28-year history, the band has released twelve studio albums and enjoyed established success throughout Europe.

==History==
===&quot;Londinium&quot; &amp; &quot;Take My Head&quot; (1994–1999)===
Archive was formed in 1994 as a trip hop band when Darius Keeler and Danny Griffiths formed up with Roya Arab and rapper Rosko John. After releasing a few singles on their own label, they broke up in early 1996 following a dispute. A few months later, the group reformed with new personnel and began recording their debut album. &quot;Londinium&quot; was released on Island Records in September 1996. The album featured a mix of dark trip hop, electronica, string arrangements and classically influenced songwriting. However, creative differences on the follow-up resulted in the band once again breaking up.

In 1997, Keeler and Griffiths regrouped and continued Archive with another female singer, Suzanne Wooder. In 1999, Archive released their second studio album on Independiente, entitled &quot;Take My Head&quot;. The album features a mix of pop and symphonic trip hop, far more melodic than its predecessor. Due to differences of musical taste with an undisclosed number of producers the band tried to work with on the album, they have described it as their least favorite album the band recorded.

===Craig Walker era (2000–2004)===
In 2000, Keeler and Griffiths began to demo new tracks for further studio production. After establishing a new sound to work with, the boys placed an advert in Mojo magazine, looking for a new lead singer. Craig Walker answered the advert and immediately began working with the band and singing on the tune that Darius wrote, entitled, &quot;Again&quot;.

Between 2002 and 2005, the band released three studio albums with Walker to further growing popularity and critical acclaim. &quot;You All Look The Same To Me&quot; (2002), &quot;Noise&quot; (2004), and &quot;Michel Vaillant&quot; were albums that marked a turning point of the Archive sound that gradually turned away from their roots in electronica and trip hop and towards more of a psychedelic and progressive style. One of the three composed albums was the soundtrack to the French film &quot;Michel Vaillant&quot;, released in November 2003. In winter of 2014, teaser music from the band&#x27;s upcoming album was used for a TV advertisement for Meetic.

In November 2004, Archive began their European tour without Walker, posting on their website that Walker would not be joining the band as he has left Archive due to personal differences.

===Collective phase (2004–present)===
In Autumn of 2004, Archive announced that Dave Pen (BirdPen) would replace Walker on the &quot;Noise&quot; tour. During this same tour, Keeler and Griffiths met the singer Pollard Berrier (formerly of the band Bauchklang) at one of their shows in Vienna, Austria. Pollard had given Darius a demo CD of his own written material, with the intention of starting another project with Dan and Darius. Because of the latter circumstances, the three began writing and rehearsing together, and were recording in Southside Studios, London, by September 2005. A new modern era for Archive had begun with Darius, Dan and Pollard all writing and co-writing seven tracks and Dave Pen co-writing three, on the album, &quot;Lights&quot;. Maria Q sang on three (including backing) tracks. From this point on, Archive was no longer a &quot;front-man-band&quot;, but a &quot;collective&quot; of individual artists contributing to what is now an established sound. The album &quot;Lights&quot; was released in May 2006 and received high critical acclaim in France, Switzerland, Greece and Poland. Archive enjoyed predominantly sold-out gigs on their &quot;Lights&quot; Tour, as well as high acclaim at festivals around Europe.

In May 2009, Archive returned to release their most acclaimed album to date, &quot;Controlling Crowds I-III&quot;. It reached number one in the French charts for a week, number one in Greece, number two in Switzerland and number 5 in Luxembourg. The single, &quot;Bullets&quot;, was their most acclaimed single to date and reached the charts in Greece, Poland, Switzerland, France, and Germany. It has also been featured in the teaser trailer for &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;. The biggest surprise of this album was the return of Rosko John, who adds an unforeseen depth to the seventh studio album. In September 2009, the follow-up album &quot;Controlling Crowds: Part IV&quot; was released, along with single &quot;The Empty Bottle&quot;. Archive continued their &quot;Controlling Crowds&quot; tour, having already sold out some fifty concerts from September 2009 - February 2010, up to and extensively for the 2010 Summer Festival Season.

====&quot;With Us Until You&#x27;re Dead&quot;====
Archive have worked on their eighth studio album (excluding Michel Vaillant) in London and Paris; under new management, having finished their deal with Warner Music - This has enlivened hopes in their home country of an official release at last. As early as November 2011, short samples of new works featured on the band&#x27;s official website.

In May 2012, the band confirmed via the website that the album, titled &quot;With Us Until You&#x27;re Dead&quot;, would be released on 27 August from their own label Dangervisit Records. It was accompanied by a European tour starting in October, to which a London show was promptly added. Fusing orchestral, electronic, soulful, progressive and emotional elements, Keeler describes the new material in comparison to previous works as &quot;more personal - love songs basically. But coming at the subject matter in that non-formatted Archive way.&quot; Fans heard a new song, &quot;Violently&quot;, featuring new vocalist Holly Martin, which was released as part of the &quot;Wiped Out / Violently&quot; EP on 2 July.

====&quot;Axiom&quot;====
In November 2013, Archive announced details of their most ambitious project to date, a forty-minute short film and accompanying album set for release in May 2014.

The film was created with the help of Spanish film collective NYSU. Director Jesus Hernandez said of the film: &quot;Archive has produced a great album that works like an entire movie script... Our challenge was to translate the band’s script into images.&quot; The film is set on Axiom, an island in the middle of nowhere with steep cliffs on all sides. On the island there is an underground city dominated by a bell, which decides the fate of the city&#x27;s inhabitants.

The album, titled &quot;Axiom&quot;, was officially released on 26 May 2014. The band debuted the short film and performed live at the 2014 Sundance London film festival.

====&quot;Restriction&quot;====
On 20 October 2014 Archive announced their upcoming album &quot;Restriction&quot; which was released on 12 January 2015. Videos for the tracks &quot;Black And Blue&quot;, &quot;Kid Corner&quot; and &quot;Feel It&quot; are available for viewing on the official website.

====&quot;The False Foundation&quot;====
On 7 October 2016 Archive released their tenth album &quot;The False Foundation&quot;. The band released music videos for &quot;Driving In Nails&quot;, &quot;Bright Lights&quot; and &quot;The False Foundation&quot;.

====&quot;25&quot;====
To celebrate their 25 years of activity, in May 2019 the band released a massive retrospective collection called &quot;25&quot;. The standard edition features 26 tracks drawn from the band&#x27;s career, including new and previously unreleased songs - including collaborations with Band of Skulls and Steve Mason. The 4 CD deluxe edition contains 42 tracks.

==== &quot;Versions&quot; ====
In 2020 Archive released the remix album &quot;Versions&quot;, a collection of 10 previously released songs that were remixed or re-recorded to generate mostly more quiet and atmospheric versions.

==== &quot;Call To Arms &amp; Angels&quot; ====
On 29 April 2022 Archive released their twelfth studio album Call To Arms &amp; Angels recorded at RAK Studios and produced by Jérome Devoise. The album features 17 tracks and is accompanied by the documentary &quot;Super8: A Call To Arms &amp; Angels&quot;. Archive released music videos for the tracks &quot;Shouting Within&quot;, &quot;Fear There &amp; Everywhere&quot;, &quot;We Are The Same&quot;, and &quot;Frying Paint&quot;. The album introduces Lisa Mottram as the band&#x27;s new vocalist.

The associated tour, scheduled for autumn 2022, had to be postponed in August 2022 by one year due to Darius Keeler&#x27;s treatment for colon cancer.

<text>A rectal prolapse occurs when walls of the rectum have to such a degree that they protrude out of the anus and are visible outside the body. However, most researchers agree that there are 3 to 5 different types of rectal prolapse, depending on whether the prolapsed section is visible externally, and whether the full or only partial thickness of the rectal wall is involved.

Rectal prolapse may occur without any symptoms, but depending upon the nature of the prolapse there may be mucous discharge (mucus coming from the anus), rectal bleeding, degrees of fecal incontinence, and obstructed defecation symptoms.

Rectal prolapse is generally more common in elderly women, although it may occur at any age and in either sex. It is very rarely life-threatening, but the symptoms can be debilitating if left untreated. Most external prolapse cases can be treated successfully, often with a surgical procedure. Internal prolapses are traditionally harder to treat and surgery may not be suitable for many patients.
==Classification==

The different kinds of rectal prolapse can be difficult to grasp, as different definitions are used and some recognize certain subtypes and not others do not. Essentially, rectal prolapses may be:
* full thickness (complete), where all the layers of the rectal wall prolapse, or involve the mucosal layer only (partial)
* external if they protrude from the anus and are visible externally, or internal if they do not
* circumferential, where the whole circumference of the rectal wall prolapses, or segmental if only parts of the circumference of the rectal wall prolapse
* present at rest, or occurring during straining.

External (complete) rectal prolapse (rectal procidentia, full thickness rectal prolapse, overt rectal prolapse) is
a full thickness, circumferential, true intussusception of the rectal wall which protrudes from the anus and is visible externally.

Internal rectal intussusception (occult rectal prolapse, internal procidentia) can be defined as a funnel shaped infolding of the upper rectal (or lower sigmoid) wall that can occur during defecation. This infolding is perhaps best visualised as folding a sock inside out, creating &quot;a tube within a tube&quot;. Another definition is &quot;where the rectum collapses but does not exit the anus&quot;. Many sources differentiate between internal rectal intussusception and mucosal prolapse, implying that the former is a full thickness prolapse of rectal wall. However, a publication by the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons stated that internal rectal intussusception involved the mucosal and submucosal layers separating from the underlying muscularis mucosa layer attachments, resulting in the separated portion of rectal lining &quot;sliding&quot; down. This may signify that authors use the terms internal rectal prolapse and internal mucosal prolapse to describe the same phenomena.

Mucosal prolapse (partial rectal mucosal prolapse) refers to prolapse of the loosening of the submucosal attachments to the muscularis propria of the distal rectummucosal layer of the rectal wall. Most sources define mucosal prolapse as an external, segmental prolapse which is easily confused with prolapsed (3rd or 4th degree) hemorrhoids (piles). However, both internal mucosal prolapse (see below) and circumferential mucosal prolapse are described by some. Others do not consider mucosal prolapse a true form of rectal prolapse.

Internal mucosal prolapse (rectal internal mucosal prolapse, RIMP) refers to prolapse of the mucosal layer of the rectal wall which does not protrude externally. There is some controversy surrounding this condition as to its relationship with hemorrhoidal disease, or whether it is a separate entity. The term &quot;mucosal hemorrhoidal prolapse&quot; is also used.

Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS, solitary rectal ulcer, SRU) occurs with internal rectal intussusception and is part of the spectrum of rectal prolapse conditions. It describes ulceration of the rectal lining caused by repeated frictional damage as the internal intussusception is forced into the anal canal during straining. SRUS can be considered a consequence of internal intussusception, which can be demonstrated in 94% of cases.

Mucosal prolapse syndrome (MPS) is recognized by some. It includes solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, rectal prolapse, proctitis cystica profunda, and inflammatory polyps. It is classified as a chronic benign inflammatory disorder.

Rectal prolapse and internal rectal intussusception has been classified according to the size of the prolapsed section of rectum, a function of rectal mobility from the sacrum and infolding of the rectum. This classification also takes into account sphincter relaxation:
* Grade I: nonrelaxation of the sphincter mechanism (anismus)
* Grade II: mild intussusception
* Grade III: moderate intussusception
* Grade IV: severe intussusception
* Grade V: rectal prolapse

Rectal internal mucosal prolapse has been graded according to the level of descent of the intussusceptum, which was predictive of symptom severity:
* first degree prolapse is detectable below the anorectal ring on straining
* second degree when it reached the dentate line
* third degree when it reached the anal verge
The most widely used classification of internal rectal prolapse is according to the height on the rectal/sigmoid wall from which they originate and by whether the intussusceptum remains within the rectum or extends into the anal canal. The height of intussusception from the anal canal is usually estimated by defecography.

Recto-rectal (high) intussusception (intra-rectal intussusception) is where the intussusception starts in the rectum, does not protrude into the anal canal, but stays within the rectum. (i.e. the intussusceptum originates in the rectum and does not extend into the anal canal. The intussuscipiens includes rectal lumen distal to the intussusceptum only). These are usually intussusceptions that originate in the upper rectum or lower sigmoid.

Recto-anal (low) intussusception (intra-anal intussusception) is where the intussusception starts in the rectum and protrudes into the anal canal (i.e. the intussusceptum originates in the rectum, and the intussuscipiens includes part of the anal canal)

An Anatomico-Functional Classification of internal rectal intussusception has been described, with the argument that other factors apart from the height of intussusception above the anal canal appear to be important to predict symptomology. The parameters of this classification are anatomic descent, diameter of intussuscepted bowel, associated rectal hyposensitivity and associated delayed colonic transit:
* Type 1: Internal recto-rectal intussusception
** Type 1W Wide lumen
** Type 1N Narrowed lumen
* Type 2: Internal recto-anal intussusception
** Type 2W Wide Lumen
** Type 2N Narrowed lumen
** Type 2M Narrowed internal lumen with associated rectal hyposensitivity or early megarectum
* Type 3: Internal-external recto-anal intussusception

==Diagnosis==

===History===

Patients may have associated gynecological conditions which may require multidisciplinary management. History of constipation is important because some of the operations may worsen constipation. Fecal incontinence may also influence the choice of management.

===Physical examination===
Rectal prolapse may be confused easily with prolapsing hemorrhoids. Mucosal prolapse also differs from prolapsing (3rd or 4th degree) hemorrhoids, where there is a segmental prolapse of the hemorrhoidal tissues at the 3, 7 and 11 o&#x27;clock positions. Mucosal prolapse can be differentiated from a full thickness external rectal prolapse (a complete rectal prolapse) by the orientation of the folds (furrows) in the prolapsed section. In full thickness rectal prolapse, these folds run circumferential. In mucosal prolapse, these folds are radially. The folds in mucosal prolapse are usually associated with internal hemorrhoids. Furthermore, in rectal prolapse, there is a sulcus present between the prolapsed bowel and the anal verge, whereas in hemorrhoidal disease there is no sulcus. Prolapsed, incarcerated hemorrhoids are extremely painful, whereas as long as a rectal prolapse is not strangulated, it gives little pain and is easy to reduce.

The prolapse may be obvious, or it may require straining and squatting to produce it. The anus is usually patulous, (loose, open) and has reduced resting and squeeze pressures. Sometimes it is necessary to observe the patient while they strain on a toilet to see the prolapse happen (the perineum can be seen with a mirror or by placing an endoscope in the bowl of the toilet). A phosphate enema may need to be used to induce straining.

The perianal skin may be macerated (softening and whitening of skin that is kept constantly wet) and show excoriation.

===Proctoscopy/sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy===
These may reveal congestion and edema (swelling) of the distal rectal mucosa, and in 10–15% of cases there may be a solitary rectal ulcer on the anterior rectal wall. Localized inflammation or ulceration can be biopsied and may lead to a diagnosis of SRUS or colitis cystica profunda. Rarely, a neoplasm (tumour) may form on the leading edge of the intussusceptum. In addition, patients are frequently elderly and therefore have increased incidence of colorectal cancer. Full length colonoscopy is usually carried out in adults prior to any surgical intervention. These investigations may be used with contrast media (barium enema) which may show the associated mucosal abnormalities.

===Videodefecography===
This investigation is used to diagnose internal intussusception, or demonstrate a suspected external prolapse that could not be produced during the examination. It is usually not necessary with obvious external rectal prolapse. Defecography may demonstrate associated conditions like cystocele, vaginal vault prolapse or enterocele.

===Colonic transit studies===
Colonic transit studies may be used to rule out colonic inertia if there is a history of severe constipation. Continent prolapse patients with slow transit constipation, and who are fit for surgery may benefit from subtotal colectomy with rectopexy.

===Anorectal manometry===
This investigation objectively documents the functional status of the sphincters. However, the clinical significance of the findings are disputed by some. It may be used to assess for pelvic floor dyssenergia, (anismus is a contraindication for certain surgeries, e.g. STARR), and these patients may benefit from post-operative biofeedback therapy. Decreased squeeze and resting pressures are usually the findings, and this may predate the development of the prolapse. Resting tone is usually preserved in patients with mucosal prolapse. In patients with reduced resting pressure, levatorplasty may be combined with prolapse repair to further improve continence.

===Anal electromyography/pudendal nerve testing===
It may be used to evaluate incontinence, but there is disagreement about what relevance the results may show, as rarely do they mandate a change of surgical plan. There may be denervation of striated musculature on the electromyogram. Increased nerve conduction periods (nerve damage), this may be significant in predicting post-operative incontinence.

==Complete rectal prolapse==
Rectal prolapse is a &quot;falling down&quot; of the rectum so that it is visible externally. The appearance is of a reddened, proboscis-like object through the anal sphincters. Patients find the condition embarrassing. The symptoms can be socially debilitating without treatment, but it is rarely life-threatening.

The true incidence of rectal prolapse is unknown, but it is thought to be uncommon. As most affected people are elderly, the condition is generally under-reported. It may occur at any age, even in children, but there is peak onset in the fourth and seventh decades. Women over 50 are six times more likely to develop rectal prolapse than men. It is rare in men over 45 and in women under 20. When males are affected, they tend to be young and report significant bowel function symptoms, especially obstructed defecation, or have a predisposing disorder (e.g., congenital anal atresia). When children are affected, they are usually under the age of 3.

35% of women with rectal prolapse have never had children, suggesting that pregnancy and labor are not significant factors. Anatomical differences such as the wider pelvic outlet in females may explain the skewed gender distribution.

Associated conditions, especially in younger patients include autism, developmental delay syndromes, and psychiatric conditions requiring several medications.

===Signs and symptoms===
Signs and symptoms include:
* history of a protruding mass.
* degrees of fecal incontinence, (50–80% of patients) which may simply present as a mucous discharge.
* constipation (20–50% of patients) also described as tenesmus (a sensation of incomplete evacuation of stool) and obstructed defecation.
* a feeling of bearing down.
* rectal bleeding
* diarrhea and erratic bowel habits.

Initially, the mass may protrude through the anal canal only during defecation and straining, and spontaneously return afterwards. Later, the mass may have to be pushed back in following defecation. This may progress to a chronically prolapsed and severe condition, defined as spontaneous prolapse that is difficult to keep inside, and occurs with walking, prolonged standing, coughing or sneezing (Valsalva maneuvers). A chronically prolapsed rectal tissue may undergo pathological changes such as thickening, ulceration and bleeding.

If the prolapse becomes trapped externally outside the anal sphincters, it may become strangulated and there is a risk of perforation. This may require an urgent surgical operation if the prolapse cannot be manually reduced. Applying granulated sugar on the exposed rectal tissue can reduce the edema (swelling) and facilitate this.

===Cause===
The precise cause is unknown, and has been much debated. In 1912 Moschcowitz proposed that rectal prolapse was a sliding hernia through a pelvic fascial defect.

This theory was based on the observation that rectal prolapse patients have a mobile and unsupported pelvic floor, and a hernia sac of peritoneum from the Pouch of Douglas and rectal wall can be seen. Other adjacent structures can sometimes be seen in addition to the rectal prolapse. Although a pouch of Douglas hernia, originating in the cul de sac of Douglas, may protrude from the anus (via the anterior rectal wall), this is a different situation from rectal prolapse.

Shortly after the invention of defecography, In 1968 Broden and Snellman used cinedefecography to show that rectal prolapse begins as a circumferential intussusception of the rectum, which slowly increases over time. The leading edge of the intussusceptum may be located at 6–8 cm or at 15–18 cm from the anal verge. This proved an older theory from the 18th century by John Hunter and Albrecht von Haller that this condition is essentially a full-thickness rectal intussusception, beginning about 3 inches above the dentate line and protruding externally.

Since most patients with rectal prolapse have a long history of constipation, it is thought that prolonged, excessive and repetitive straining during defecation may predispose to rectal prolapse. Since rectal prolapse itself causes functional obstruction, more straining may result from a small prolapse, with increasing damage to the anatomy. This excessive straining may be due to predisposing pelvic floor dysfunction (e.g. obstructed defecation) and anatomical factors:
* Abnormally low descent of the peritoneum covering the anterior rectal wall
* poor posterior rectal fixation, resulting in loss of posterior fixation of the rectum to the sacral curve
* loss of the normal horizontal position of the rectum with lengthening (redundant rectosigmoid) and downward displacement of the sigmoid and rectum
* long rectal mesentery
* a deep cul-de-sac
* levator diastasis
* a patulous, weak anal sphincter

Some authors question whether these abnormalities are the cause, or secondary to the prolapse. Other predisposing factors/associated conditions include:
* pregnancy (although 35% of women who develop rectal prolapse are nulliparous) (have never given birth)
* previous surgery (30–50% of females with the condition underwent previous gynecological surgery)
* pelvic neuropathies and neurological disease
* high gastrointestinal helminth loads (e.g. Whipworm)
* COPD
* cystic fibrosis 

The association with uterine prolapse (10–25%) and cystocele (35%) may suggest that there is some underlying abnormality of the pelvic floor that affects multiple pelvic organs. Proximal bilateral pudendal neuropathy has been demonstrated in patients with rectal prolapse who have fecal incontinence. This finding was shown to be absent in healthy subjects, and may be the cause of denervation-related atrophy of the external anal sphincter. Some authors suggest that pudendal nerve damage is the cause for pelvic floor and anal sphincter weakening, and may be the underlying cause of a spectrum of pelvic floor disorders.

Sphincter function in rectal prolapse is almost always reduced. This may be the result of direct sphincter injury by chronic stretching of the prolapsing rectum. Alternatively, the intussuscepting rectum may lead to chronic stimulation of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR – contraction of the external anal sphincter in response to stool in the rectum). The RAIR was shown to be absent or blunted. Squeeze (maximum voluntary contraction) pressures may be affected as well as the resting tone. This is most likely a denervation injury to the external anal sphincter.

The assumed mechanism of fecal incontinence in rectal prolapse is by the chronic stretch and trauma to the anal sphincters and the presence of a direct conduit (the intussusceptum) connecting rectum to the external environment which is not guarded by the sphincters.

The assumed mechanism of obstructed defecation is by disruption to the rectum and anal canal&#x27;s ability to contract and fully evacuate rectal contents. The intussusceptum itself may mechanically obstruct the rectoanal lumen, creating a blockage that straining, anismus and colonic dysmotility exacerbate.

Some believe that internal rectal intussusception represents the initial form of a progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external rectal prolapse. The intermediary stages would be gradually increasing sizes of intussusception. However, internal intussusception rarely progresses to external rectal prolapse. The factors that result in a patient progressing from internal intussusception to a full thickness rectal prolapse remain unknown. Defecography studies demonstrated that degrees of internal intussusception are present in 40% of asymptomatic subjects, raising the possibility that it represents a normal variant in some, and may predispose patients to develop symptoms, or exacerbate other problems.

===Treatment===

====Conservative====
Surgery is thought to be the only option to potentially cure a complete rectal prolapse. For people with medical problems that make them unfit for surgery, and those who have minimal symptoms, conservative measures may be beneficial. Dietary adjustments, including increasing dietary fiber may be beneficial to reduce constipation, and thereby reduce straining. A bulk forming agent (e.g. psyllium) or stool softener can also reduce constipation.

====Surgical====
Surgery is often required to prevent further damage to the anal sphincters. The goals of surgery are to restore the normal anatomy and to minimize symptoms. There is no globally agreed consensus as to which procedures are more effective, and there have been over 50 different operations described.

Surgical approaches in rectal prolapse can be either perineal or abdominal. A perineal approach (or trans-perineal) refers to surgical access to the rectum and sigmoid colon via an incision around the anus and perineum (the area between the genitals and the anus). Abdominal approach (trans-abdominal approach) involves the surgeon cutting into the abdomen and gaining surgical access to the pelvic cavity. Procedures for rectal prolapse may involve fixation of the bowel (rectopexy), or resection (a portion removed), or both. Trans-anal (endo-anal) procedures are also described where access to the internal rectum is gained through the anus itself.

Abdominal procedures are associated with lower risk of postoperative recurrence of the prolapse, compared with perineal procedures (6.1% vs 16.3% in patients who are younger than 65 years of age at the time of surgery).

=====Abdominal procedures=====
The abdominal approach carries a small risk of impotence in males (e.g. 1–2% in abdominal rectopexy). Abdominal operations may be open or laparoscopic (keyhole surgery).

Laparoscopic procedures
Recovery time following laparoscopic surgery is shorter and less painful than following traditional abdominal surgery. Instead of opening the pelvic cavity with a wide incision (laparotomy), a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) and surgical instruments are inserted into the pelvic cavity via small incisions. Rectopexy and anterior resection have been performed laparoscopically with good results.

=====Perineal procedures=====
The perineal approach generally results in less post-operative pain and complications, and a reduced length of hospital stay. These procedures generally carry a higher recurrence rate and poorer functional outcome. The perineal procedures include perineal rectosigmoidectomy and Delorme repair. Elderly, or other medically high-risk patients are usually treated by perineal procedures, as they can be performed under a regional anesthetic, or even local anesthetic with intravenous sedation, thus avoid the risks of a general anesthetic. Alternatively, perineal procedures may be selected to reduce risk of nerve damage, for example in young male patients for whom sexual dysfunction may be a major concern.

Perineal rectosigmoidectomy

The goal of Perineal rectosigmoidectomy is to resect or remove the redundant bowel. This is done through the perineum. The lower rectum is anchored to the sacrum through fibrosis in order to prevent future prolapse. The full thickness of the rectal wall is incised at a level just above the dentate line. Redundant rectal and sigmoid wall is removed and the new edge of colon is reconnected (anastomosed) with the anal canal with stitches or staples. This procedure may be combined with levatorplasty, to tighten the pelvic muscles. A combined a perineal proctosigmoidectomy with anterior levatorplasty is also called an Altemeier procedure. Levatorplasty is performed to correct levator diastasis which is commonly associated with rectal prolapse. Perineal rectosigmoidectomy was first introduced by Mikulicz in 1899, and it remained the preferred treatment in Europe for many years. It was Popularized by Altemeier. The procedure is simple, safe and effective. Continence levatorplasty may enhance restoration of continence (2/3 of patients). Complications occur in less than 10% of cases, and include pelvic bleeding, pelvic abscess and anastomotic dehiscence (splitting apart of the stitches inside), bleeding or leak at a dehiscence Mortality is low. Recurrence rates are higher than for abdominal repair, 16–30%, but more recent studies give lower recurrence rates. Additional levatorplasty can reduce recurrence rates to 7%.

Delorme Procedure

This is a modification of the perineal rectosigmoidectomy, differing in that only the mucosa and submucosa are excised from the prolapsed segment, rather than full thickness resection. The prolapse is exposed if it is not already present, and the mucosal and submucosal layers are stripped from the redundant length of bowel. The muscle layer that is left is plicated (folded) and placed as a buttress above the pelvic floor. The edges of the mucosal are then stitched back together. &quot;Mucosal proctectomy&quot; was first discussed by Delorme in 1900, now it is becoming more popular again as it has low morbidity and avoids an abdominal incision, while effectively repairing the prolapse. The procedure is ideally suited to those patients with full-thickness prolapse limited to partial circumference (e.g., anterior wall) or less-extensive prolapse (perineal rectosigmoidectomy may be difficult in this situation). Fecal incontinence is improved following surgery (40%–75% of patients). Post operatively, both mean resting and squeeze pressures were increased. Constipation is improved in 50% of cases, but often urgency and tenesmus are created. Complications, including infection, urinary retention, bleeding, anastomotic dehiscence (opening of the stitched edges inside), rectal stricture (narrowing of the gut lumen), diarrhea, and fecal impaction occur in 6–32% of cases. Mortality occurs in 0–2.5% cases. There is a higher recurrence rate than abdominal approaches (7–26% cases).

Anal encirclement (Thirsch procedure)

This procedure can be carried out under local anaesthetic. After reduction of the prolapse, a subcutaneous suture (a stitch under the skin) or other material is placed encircling the anus, which is then made taut to prevent further prolapse. Placing silver wire around the anus first described by Thiersch in 1891. Materials used include nylon, silk, silastic rods, silicone, Marlex mesh, Mersilene mesh, fascia, tendon, and Dacron. This operation does not correct the prolapse itself, it merely supplements the anal sphincter, narrowing the anal canal with the aim of preventing the prolapse from becoming external, meaning it remains in the rectum. This goal is achieved in 54–100% cases. Complications include breakage of the encirclement material, fecal impaction, sepsis, and erosion into the skin or anal canal. Recurrence rates are higher than the other perineal procedures. This procedure is most often used for people who have a severe condition or who have a high risk of adverse effects from general anesthetic, and who may not tolerate other perineal procedures.

==Internal rectal prolapse==

Internal rectal prolapse (internal intussusception, internal rectal intussusception, occult rectal prolapse, rectoanal intussusception) is a type of rectal prolapse where there is a telescopic, funnel-shaped infolding of the wall of the rectum that occurs during defecation. The term internal rectal prolapse is used when the prolapsed section of rectal wall remains inside the body and is not visible outside the body. 

It may not cause any symptoms, or may cause obstructed defecation syndrome and/or fecal incontinence. The causes are not clear. It may represent the first stage of a progressive condition that eventually may result in external rectal prolapse, but this is uncommon. It is possible that chronic straining during defecation (dyssynergic defecation / anismus), connective tissue disorders, and anatomic factors (e.g. loose connection of rectum to the sacrum, redundant sigmoid, deep pouch of Douglas) are involved. 

Diagnosis is by defecography. If internal rectal prolapse is causing symptoms, treatment is by various non surgical measures (e.g. biofeedback), or surgery. The most common surgical treatment is ventral rectopexy. Internal rectal prolapse is often associated with other conditions such as rectocele, enterocele, or solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. Internal rectal prolapse usually affects females who have given birth at least once, but it may sometimes affect females who have never given birth. About 10% of cases are in males. More severe forms of internal rectal prolapse are associated with older age.

==Mucosal prolapse==
Rectal mucosal prolapse (mucosal prolapse, anal mucosal prolapse) is a sub-type of rectal prolapse, and refers to abnormal descent of the rectal mucosa through the anus. It is different to an internal intussusception (occult prolapse) or a complete rectal prolapse (external prolapse, procidentia) because these conditions involve the full thickness of the rectal wall, rather than only the mucosa (lining).

Mucosal prolapse is a different condition to prolapsing (3rd or 4th degree) hemorrhoids, although they may look similar.

Rectal mucosal prolapse can be a cause of obstructed defecation (outlet obstruction). and rectal malodor.

===Symptoms===
Symptom severity increases with the size of the prolapse, and whether it spontaneously reduces after defecation, requires manual reduction by the patient, or becomes irreducible. The symptoms are identical to advanced hemorrhoidal disease, and include:
* Fecal leakage causing staining of undergarments
* Rectal bleeding
* Mucous rectal discharge
* Rectal pain
* Pruritus ani

===Cause===
The condition, along with complete rectal prolapse and internal rectal intussusception, is thought to be related to chronic straining during defecation and constipation.

Mucosal prolapse occurs when the results from loosening of the submucosal attachments (between the mucosal layer and the muscularis propria) of the distal rectum. The section of prolapsed rectal mucosa can become ulcerated, leading to bleeding.

===Diagnosis===
Mucosal prolapse can be differentiated from a full thickness external rectal prolapse (a complete rectal prolapse) by the orientation of the folds (furrows) in the prolapsed section. In full thickness rectal prolapse, these folds run circumferential. In mucosal prolapse, these folds are radially. The folds in mucosal prolapse are usually associated with internal hemorrhoids.

===Treatment===
EUA (examination under anesthesia) of anorectum and banding of the mucosa with rubber bands.

==Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome==

Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS, SRU) is a chronic disorder of the rectal mucosa (the lining of the rectum). Symptoms are variable. There may be hematochezia (bleeding), obstructed defecation, or no symptoms at all. Very often but not always SRUS occurs in association with varying degrees of rectal prolapse. The condition may be caused by different factors, such as long term constipation, straining during defecation, and dyssynergic defecation (anismus). Treatment is by normalization of bowel habits, biofeedback, and other non-surgical measures. In more severe cases, various surgical procedures may be indicated. The condition is relatively rare, affecting approximately 1 in 100,000 people per year. It affects mainly adults aged 30–50. Females are affected slightly more often than males. The disorder can be confused clinically with rectal cancer or other conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, even when a biopsy is done.

==Colitis cystica profunda==
Another condition associated with internal intussusception is colitis cystica profunda (also known as CCP, or proctitis cystica profunda), which is cystica profunda in the rectum. Cystica profunda is characterized by formation of mucin cysts in the muscle layers of the gut lining, and it can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. When it occurs in the rectum, some believe to be an interchangeable diagnosis with SRUS since the histologic features of the conditions overlap. Indeed, CCP is managed identically to SRUS.

==Mucosal prolapse syndrome==
A group of conditions known as Mucosal prolapse syndrome (MPS) has now been recognized. It includes SRUS, rectal prolapse, proctitis cystica profunda, and inflammatory polyps. It is classified as a chronic benign inflammatory disorder. The unifying feature is varying degrees of rectal prolapse, whether internal intussusception (occult prolapse) or external prolapse.

==Epidemiology==
Rectal prolapse affects less than 0.5% of the general population. It affects women more commonly, with a female to male ratio of 9:1.

==History==
External rectal prolapse has been recognized since ancient times. The first written report is in the Ebers Papyrus (1500 BC). In the Hippocratic Corpus there is a description of a treatment involving hanging the patient upside down. 

In 1831 British surgeon Frederick Salmon wrote a treatise on rectal prolapse, &quot;Practical Observations on Prolapsus of the Rectum&quot;. What later became known as internal rectal prolapse was first described in 1888 in a textbook about diseases of the rectum. The author classified IRP as a variety of procidentia recti (i.e., rectal prolapse) with the definition “the upper part of the rectum descends through the lower part, but does not appear outside the anus.”

==Society and culture==

Rosebud pornography and prolapse pornography (rosebudding / rectal prolapse pornography) is an anal sex practice that occurs in some extreme anal pornography, wherein a pornographic actor or actress deliberately performs a rectal prolapse. &quot;Rosebudding&quot; is an example of producers making extreme content due to the easy availability of free pornography on the internet. Rosebudding is a way for pornographic actors and actresses to distinguish themselves. Some who participate in this form of pornography may be unaware of the consequences.

==Etymology==

Prolapse refers to &quot;the falling down or slipping of a body part from its usual position or relations&quot;. It is derived from the Latin &quot;pro-&quot; - &quot;forward&quot; + &quot;labi&quot; - &quot;to slide&quot;. Prolapse can refer to many different medical conditions other than rectal prolapse.

Procidentia has a similar meaning to prolapse, referring to &quot;a sinking or prolapse of an organ or part&quot;. It is derived from the Latin &quot;procidere&quot; - &quot;to fall forward&quot;. Procidentia usually refers to uterine prolapse, but rectal procidentia can also be a synonym for rectal prolapse.

Intussusception is defined as invagination (infolding), especially referring to &quot;the slipping of a length of intestine into an adjacent portion&quot;. It is derived from the Latin &quot;intus&quot; - &quot;within&quot; and &quot;susceptio&quot; - &quot;action of undertaking&quot;, from &quot;suscipere&quot; - &quot;to take up&quot;. Rectal intussusception is not to be confused with other intussusceptions involving colon or small intestine, which can sometimes be a medical emergency. Rectal intussusception by contrast is not life-threatening.

Intussusceptum refers to the proximal section of rectal wall, which telescopes into the lumen of the distal section of rectum (termed the intussuscipiens). What results is 3 layers of rectal wall overlaid. From the lumen outwards, the first layer is the proximal wall of the intussusceptum, the middle is the wall of the intussusceptum folded back on itself, and the outer is the distal rectal wall, the intussuscipiens.

<text>A hypocorism ( or ; from Ancient Greek ; sometimes also &quot;hypocoristic&quot;), or pet name, is a name used to show affection for a person. It may be a diminutive form of a person&#x27;s name, such as &quot;Izzy&quot; for Isabel or &quot;Bob&quot; for Robert, or it may be unrelated.

==Origins and usage==
Etymologically, the term &quot;hypocorism&quot; is from Ancient Greek (), from (), meaning &#x27;to call by endearing names&#x27;. The prefix refers in this case to creating a diminutive, something that is smaller in a tender or affectionate sense; the root originates in the Greek for &#x27;to caress&#x27; or &#x27;to treat with tokens of affection&#x27;, and is related to the words () &#x27;boy, youth&#x27; and () &#x27;girl, young woman&#x27;. 

In linguistics, the term can be used more specifically to refer to the morphological process by which the standard form of the word is transformed into a form denoting affection, or to words resulting from this process. In English, a word is often clipped down to a closed monosyllable and then suffixed with &quot;-y&quot;/&quot;-ie&quot; (phonologically ). Sometimes the suffix &quot;-o&quot; is included as well as other forms or templates.

Hypocoristics are often affective in meaning and are particularly common in Australian English, but can be used for various purposes in different semantic fields, including personal names, place names, and nouns. Hypocorisms are usually considered distinct from diminutives, but they can also overlap.

<text>Eric Scott Judy (born November 16, 1974) is an American musician best known as the original bass guitarist, co-founder, and backing vocalist of the indie rock band Modest Mouse. 

Judy departed the group in roughly 2011 or early 2012. He informed band members that he was leaving Modest Mouse in advance of recording for &quot;Strangers To Ourselves&quot;. Per Isaac Brock, Judy “finally had enough. He has three kids. He didn’t feel like leaving his house as much as is required. He left right before we started recording, but some of his writing still exists throughout the record. Making a record without him was really fucking hard.”

== Other work ==
Judy appeared on Adam Forkner&#x27;s first solo album in 2003. 

He also is a member of Isaac Brock&#x27;s side project Ugly Casanova. 

As of 2016, Judy played in the Seattle-based Rudy Waltz. 

As of 2021, he owns a bookstore in Seattle with his wife Desirae Wilkerson.

<doc id="657047" wikidata="Q11684720" url="?curid=657047" title="Jeremiah Green">
<text>Jeremiah Martin Green (March 4, 1977December 31, 2022) was an American musician best known as a founding member and drummer of the indie rock band Modest Mouse from 1993 to March 2003, and again from May 2004 until his death in December 2022.

== Early life ==
Jeremiah Martin Green was born on March 4, 1977, in Oahu, Hawaii, while his father was stationed there in the Army. He grew up in Moxee, Washington, a few miles outside of Yakima. His family moved to the Seattle area in 1989. He had an older brother named Adam. His father was an alcoholic who was abusive to Green; he later apologized and reconciled with his son.

Green took drumming lessons for three months in his early teens but was uninspired by his teacher. He immersed himself in the Seattle music scene, joining a band and attending concerts at night. His early influences included local groups such as Treepeople and Hammerbox. His first favorite band was the English Gothic rock band The Cure; Green was particularly inspired by the drumming on their 1982 album &quot;Pornography&quot;. However, Green cited the Washington, D.C., post-hardcore band Fugazi as his biggest influence for starting a band.

== Career ==
Green began his touring and recording career while he was in high school. In 1993, he became a founding member of Modest Mouse, formed with Isaac Brock and Eric Judy in Issaquah, Washington. In the mid-1990s, Green played with the bands Satisfact on K Records, Red Stars Theory on Touch and Go Records, and Peeved on Distressed Records. Green also played with the bands Vells and Psychic Emperor. Both bands played at venues around Seattle and the Pacific Northwest.

In 2003, on his birthday, Green quit Modest Mouse. He later revealed that he suffered a nervous breakdown and was briefly admitted to a psychiatric hospital. He had earlier been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed the antidepressant Effexor. Combined with alcohol and psilocybin mushrooms, he experienced severe manic episodes. After quitting, the band had quickly convinced Green to return, but on the second day of recording in Portland he exploded in argument and then disappeared for two months. He stopped taking his antidepressants and experienced a painful period of withdrawal. Faced with Green&#x27;s absence, Modest Mouse initially considered breaking up. Green was eventually replaced by Benjamin Weikel of The Helio Sequence. Green&#x27;s departure caused him to be absent during the entire recording process of the band&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Good News for People Who Love Bad News&quot;. Green officially rejoined the band in May 2004. In 2007, Green appeared on Graig Markel&#x27;s &quot;Via Novella&quot; on the Sonic Boom Label. In May 2008, Green released a drum breaks 7&quot; collaboration with Plastiq Phantom under the alias World Gang on the Imputor? label.

== Style and reception ==
Of his work on &quot;Sad Sappy Sucker&quot;, Spencer Owen at Pitchfork Media said, &quot;Jeremiah Green proves himself to be one of indie rock&#x27;s best drummers, even this early on in the game.&quot; In an interview, Benjamin Weikel stated that Green&#x27;s drum parts have a &quot;great, loose feeling that&#x27;s hard to emulate&quot;.

Green placed 37th in &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;″s list of &quot;50 Greatest Rock Drummers&quot;, where Jonathan Bradley described his drumming: 

== Personal life and death ==
Green was married to Lauren, who owned the store Thuja in downtown Port Townsend, Washington. Their son was born in 2016.

On December 25, 2022, it was announced that Green had been diagnosed with stage IV cancer. He died in Sequim, Washington, on December 31, 2022, at age 45.

<text>Organically Grown is a privately held Delaware limited liability company owned by Organically Grown Group LLC, with offices in Encino, California. Julia and Robert Stein founded the company in October 2007. The brands owned and controlled by Organically Grown Group LLC include: Organically Grown, Organically Grown Baby and Organically Grown Kids.

== History ==
The Organically Grown brand was first established in 1971 by &quot;Arpeja-California, Inc.&quot;, a women&#x27;s apparel manufacturer in Los Angeles whose labels included Young Innocent, Young Victorian, and Young Edwardian, where designer Sue Wong cut her teeth, and created by Arpeja owner Jack Litt. At one point, Organically Grown was reported to have annual sales of nearly $100 million. Lynda Carter, star of the 1970s hit television show, &quot;The New Adventures of Wonder Woman&quot;, served as a spokesperson and modeled for advertisements for the brand in 1977 and 1978.
In 1992, Organically Grown&#x27;s trademarks were sold by &quot;Arpeja-California, Inc.&quot; to &quot;Marshalls of MA., Inc.&quot; (discount department stores) which was then acquired by &quot;The TJX Companies Inc.&quot; (TJ Maxx) in 1995. In October 2007, &quot;Organically Grown Group, LLC&quot; acquired all rights owned by &quot;The TJX Companies, Inc.&quot; and &quot;Marshalls of MA., Inc.&quot; in the Organically Grown trademarks.

In 2007, Julia and Robert Stein co-founded Organically Grown as a lifestyle brand that brings organic products to the global marketplace.

==Products==
Organically Grown provides 100 percent certified-organic cotton products that are available to purchase through the company&#x27;s website and other retail outlets. After beginning with baby clothes and bedding, Organically Grown added adult T-shirts and headwear, as well as women&#x27;s activewear to their collection of products.

All Organically Grown&#x27;s products comply with regulations set forth by either the Global Organic Textile Standard, which is the leading processing standard for textiles made from organic fibres or the Organic Exchange 100 Standard, a standard for tracking and documenting the purchase, handling and use of 100 percent certified organic cotton fiber in yarns, fabrics and finished goods.

==Business operations and philosophy==
After hearing of the dangers conventional cotton poses on individual health and the environment, the husband and wife team of Julia and Robert Stein decided to get involved. According to a report from the Organic Exchange, in 2008 the production of conventional cotton used over 284 million pounds of pesticides in the United States alone, with hundreds of millions more pounds sprayed worldwide. Additionally, seven of the ten pesticides most commonly sprayed on cotton are on the EPA&#x27;s list of known, probable, or likely human carcinogens. The Steins realized that the market for organic clothing was not priced for the average everyday consumer. With Julia&#x27;s background in merchandising and Robert&#x27;s licensing and business law experience, the couple saw an opportunity to use their respective business backgrounds to start an affordably-priced organic clothing brand.

<text>An ice cream sandwich is a frozen dessert consisting of ice cream between two biscuits, wafers, soft cookies, or other baked goods. The ingredients are different around the world, with Ireland using wafers and the United States commonly using cookies.

== Description ==
An ice cream sandwich is a frozen dessert or confection. The ingredients are different around the world, with the common component being ice cream between baked goods, commonly biscuits, wafers, or cookies.

==Regional varieties==

===Australia===
Within Australia, popular brands are &quot;Giant Sandwich&quot; (blue and pink wrapper), and &quot;Monaco Bar&quot; (gold and black metallic wrapper) in the Eastern provinces. Other brands include Streets &quot;Cookie&quot;, &quot;Maxibon&quot; (with one-half ice cream sandwich) and &quot;Maxibon Cookie&quot;, and &quot;Pat and Stick&#x27;s Homemade Range&quot; (recognizable by its circular shape). Additional brands &quot;Indulge&quot; and &quot;Feast&quot; have also become popular.

Ice cream sandwiches were formerly known as a &quot;cream between&quot;. One purchased a small block of ice cream wrapped in paper and placed it between two wafers.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, ice cream sandwiches are made with two wafers and the three-flavour combination called &quot;Fürst-Pückler-Eis&quot;, elsewhere known as Neapolitan ice cream. It is based on a recipe introduced in 1839 by the cook of a German nobleman, Prince Hermann Ludwig Heinrich von Pückler-Muskau.

===Iran===

The usual Iranian ice cream sandwich is called &quot;bastani naani&quot; () meaning &quot;bread-ice cream&quot;, and is made with Iranian traditional ice cream between two wafers.

=== Ireland ===

In Ireland, they are known as &quot;sliders&quot; or an ice cream wafer; they are usually served as vanilla ice cream sandwiched between two rectangular chocolate wafers. A &quot;double nougat&quot; is ice cream sandwiched between two nougat wafers. The wafers are not covered in chocolate, only the edges.

===Israel===
In Israel, ice cream sandwiches are commonly known as &quot;kasata&quot; (קסטה). Though the name comes from the Italian cassata, the dessert itself has little to do with Italian cassata, and usually consists of two thick biscuits holding a mix of block of vanilla and chocolate-flavoured ice cream.

===Italy===
In Italy, ice cream sandwiches are eaten in the region of Sicily as a breakfast item. The sandwich is called “Brioche con Gelato” in Italian and it consists of a soft Brioche roll split open on top and filled with gelato.

===Philippines===

Local ice cream (&quot;sorbetes&quot;) sellers/peddlers with their pushcarts that travel around cities sometimes offer ice cream sandwiches with pandesal (salt bread) as the bread.

===Serbia===

In Serbia, a popular frozen food company Frikom created Plazma Sandwich, which is a unique fusion of Plazma (popular Serbian biscuit brand) biscuit-flavored ice cream, enriched with ground Plazma biscuits, covered in milk chocolate with a sprinkling of pieces of ground Plazma biscuits on one half, and two large pieces of Plazma biscuits enveloping the ice cream on the other half.

===Singapore===
Wafer ice creams are popular in Singapore. It is one of the types of &quot;potong&quot; (cut) ice cream, so named because the servings are sliced from a large bar of ice cream. Wafer ice cream consists of two wafers holding together a rectangular block of ice cream. Wafer ice cream evolved from the older &#x27;ice potong&#x27; type, which is a rectangular prism of ice cream mounted on a wooden stick. Many customers complained that the ice potong would easily melt and fall off the stick, leading to the introduction of the wafers for better grip. Vendors are commonly found along Orchard Road and Chinatown and outside schools. A colloquial term for it is &quot;&quot;pia&quot; ice cream&quot;, which translates to &quot;biscuit ice cream&quot; in the Hokkien dialect.

Common flavours offered include peppermint, chocolate chip, durian, ripple, red bean, yam, sweet corn, honeydew, and chocolate.

Wafer ice cream vendors also sell the same blocks of ice cream on slices of multicoloured bread, on cones or in cups instead of sandwiched between wafers.

Catering companies in Singapore also send ice cream sandwich carts for functions.

===Thailand===
&quot;Itim Khanom Pang&quot; (or &quot;Icecream Khanom Pang&quot;), literally bread ice cream, a street food in Thailand usually composed of longer rolls similar to hot dog buns a mix of scoops of coconut ice cream/sorbet (or vanilla) and chocolate-flavoured ice cream, with a selection of local toppings from traditionally salty or sweet sticky rice, salty crushed peanuts, and syrup-soaked chewy palm seeds to slivers of fresh or dried fruits. Then drizzled on top with evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk or chocolate syrup.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, an ice cream wafer, consisting of a small block of ice cream between two rectangular wafer biscuits, was a popular alternative to a cone up until the 1980s. A &quot;nougat wafer&quot; was also available, consisting of a layer of mallow sandwiched between two wafers and coated with chocolate around the edges. Typically a vanilla block (or a layer of soft-serve) sandwiched between one plain wafer and one chocolate-covered nougat one. This is known as a single nougat&quot; in Scotland, with a double nougat (pronounced nugget) having nougat wafers on both sides. Raspberry sauce is also a common topping. Nougat wafers came in double or triple varieties, depending on the number of nougat wafers in the construction.

===United States===
The earliest mention of ice cream sandwiches in North America come in the year of 1899. Street vendors in New York recently sold slabs of ice cream between sheets of paper, called &quot;hokey pokeys&quot;, until someone had the idea of using cookies instead. Photos from the Jersey Shore circa 1905 show ice cream sandwiches being sold at 1¢ each. The earliest US patent having to do with ice cream sandwiches (No. 1,387,613) is by Russell H. Proper for an &quot;Ice Cream Sandwich Machine&quot; in 1921.

Ice cream sandwiches are sold using chocolate cookies. A Chipwich, where ice cream (usually vanilla) is sandwiched between two chocolate chip cookies, is also popular.

A &quot;National Ice Cream Sandwich Day&quot; is set for August 2 and has been celebrated since at least 2005.

===Uruguay===
In Uruguay, an ice cream sandwich (&quot;sánguche helado&quot;) or triple sandwich (&quot;sánguche triple&quot;) is typically a neapolitan ice cream (&quot;helado triple&quot;) sandwich prepared with wafers such as the one in the image.

===Vietnam===
In Vietnam, an ice cream sandwich called &#x27; is commonly sold on the street as a snack. It consists of scoops of ice cream stuffed inside a &#x27;, sprinkled with crushed peanuts.

<doc id="657058" wikidata="Q489281" url="?curid=657058" title="Seongsu Bridge">
<text>The Seongsu Bridge (), sometimes spelled Sŏngsu Bridge, is a cantilever bridge over the Han River, connecting the Seongdong and Gangnam districts of Seoul, South Korea. The bridge began construction under Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction on April 26, 1995 and was opened to the public on July 3, 1997 by Seoul Mayor Cho Soon (). The original Seongsu Bridge was built in 1979, and was demolished and rebuilt following the Seongsu Bridge disaster on October 21, 1994.

== History ==
=== Original bridge ===
The original Seongsu Bridge was built by Dong Ah Construction Industrial Company, opening to the public on October 15, 1979. The bridge spanned and was wide, accommodating 4 lanes of traffic. Fifteen years later, on the morning of October 21, 1994, a span of the Seongsu Bridge collapsed, killing 32 people and injuring 17 others. The collapse was ruled a result of poor welding, rusted extension hinges, and lack of general maintenance— and would result in the convictions of 16 city government and construction workers on charges of criminal negligence.

In the aftermath of the disaster, the Seoul Metropolitan Government originally planned to repair and reopen the bridge to traffic within three months, but reversed course after public outcry.

=== New bridge ===
Construction for the new bridge began in March 1996 under Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction. Construction for the replacement bridge cost 78 billion won (equivalent to ₩ billion in ), about 6.8 times the original price. The new bridge was opened to the public on July 3, 1997, by Mayor Cho Soon, and a memorial was held on the bridge.

<doc id="657059" wikidata="Q3647092" url="?curid=657059" title="HMS Surprise (novel)">
<text>HMS Surprise is the third historical novel in the Aubrey–Maturin series by Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1973. The series follows the partnership of Royal Navy Captain Jack Aubrey and his ship&#x27;s surgeon Stephen Maturin during the wars against Napoleonic France.

In the story, Maturin&#x27;s work as an intelligence agent gets him into trouble just as Aubrey takes command of a new ship, HMS &quot;Surprise&quot;. Later, the friends embark on a long voyage to bring an ambassador to Southeast Asia, rounding the southern tip of Africa.

The novel is often considered one of the best in the series. Some reviewers found it had &quot;superb depictions of life&quot;, yet too full of nautical detail, while others found that detail part of the author&#x27;s erudition and not in the way of the plot. The author showed &quot;capacity for creating another completely believable world&quot;, while another reviewer said the novel is &quot;stretching its genre [naval adventure] but never escaping it.&quot;

==Plot summary==
Shortly after the events of &quot;Post Captain&quot;, the Admiralty debates the prize money to be awarded to Aubrey and the other captains of the convoy involved in the recent action off the coast of Portugal, in which several Spanish treasure ships were intercepted carrying the price of Spain&#x27;s entry into the war on the side of France. On the quibble that Spain had not yet formally entered the war, the new First Lord of the Admiralty decides the vast sum is a &quot;Droit of the Admiralty&quot; and thus is not to be shared out with the captors. Jack is disheartened to hear that his reward will be much less than he and Sophia had expected. The First Lord also makes a blunder by mentioning the name of intelligence agent Stephen Maturin during the proceedings, putting Maturin at risk.

Unconcerned, Stephen goes on a mission to Minorca and arranges for Jack, still acting commander of HMS &quot;Lively&quot; and now on blockade duty near Toulon, to pick him up at Port Mahon. &quot;Lively&quot; pursues and burns a French supply ship, from which Jack gains valuable loot: a gunboat and a French signal book. When Stephen fails to show up at the rendezvous point, Jack learns from a Catalan revolutionary that his friend has been captured by French intelligence and is being held in Port Mahon in the former home of Admiral Harte, which Jack knows well. Jack and a rescue party use the captured gunboat and the French signals to slip into port unmolested. They storm the house and rescue Stephen, who has been brutally tortured, and kill most of the French interrogators.

Back in England, Stephen tries to recover his strength and the use of his flayed hands. Jack is taken by bailiffs and held in a sponging-house until he can pay off his debts. His marriage to Sophia Williams is deferred, as her mother insists that he be debt-free. Sir Joseph Blaine visits Stephen, who tells him of his capture and Aubrey&#x27;s predicament, requesting that Jack be advanced his pending reward and released. Blaine promises to help, and also gives Aubrey command of a new ship, HMS &quot;Surprise&quot;. Before he embarks, Jack meets Sophia in a coach in the middle of the night, and they promise to marry no one else.

Aubrey and Maturin depart in the &quot;Surprise&quot; with orders to ferry an ambassador, Mr Stanhope, to the Sultan of Kampong on the Malay Peninsula. Stanhope almost immediately takes to his cabin with seasickness. &quot;Surprise&quot; is caught in the doldrums north of the equator, and the crew begins to show signs of scurvy. Stephen insists that they touch on the coast of Brazil to obtain fresh fruits. On a very hot Sunday, the doctor requests a boat for a quick visit to St. Paul&#x27;s Rock, and Second Lieutenant Nicolls agrees to row him out. The rocky islet and the nearby &quot;Surprise&quot; are suddenly struck by intense squalls; Nicolls drowns and Stephen survives for two days on bird-fouled water and the blood of the resident boobies. A badly damaged &quot;Surprise&quot; recovers Stephen, who remarks that the days under the hot sun have restored his health after the torture. The ship then stops in Brazil for repairs. This is Stephen&#x27;s first time in the New World, so he explores the jungle and returns with a sloth, which Jack introduces to alcohol. They also put in at Rio for mail, where Jack learns that Admiral Linois, who once took him prisoner, is patrolling the Indian Ocean at the head of a French squadron.

Refitted and repainted, &quot;Surprise&quot; maintains a cautious distance while rounding the Cape of Good Hope, held by the Dutch who are allied with Napoleon. Nearing the waters of the Antarctic Ocean, &quot;Surprise&quot; endures a severe storm, and Stanhope becomes very ill. They put into Bombay in British India to refit after the storms and rest the ambassador. Stephen meets a local street child, a girl named Dil, who eagerly shows him around the city. He is watching a parade with Dil when he sees Diana Villiers, who has returned to Bombay ahead of her companion, the wealthy merchant Richard Canning. Stephen and Diana agree to visit, and spend several days together, at the end of which Stephen asks her to marry him. Diana does not give an answer but promises she will when &quot;Surprise&quot; stops in Calcutta. Stephen later finds Dil dead and her body looted of the valuables he had given her; he supervises her cremation on the shore.

Soon after the voyage resumes Stanhope becomes ill again. His condition grows more serious with each passing day, and before reaching the Sunda Strait they are compelled to find solid ground to help him recover. Pullings recommends a tiny beach surrounded by jungle, and they hastily bring the ambassador to it, where he dies a few hours later. Their mission now void, &quot;Surprise&quot; sets sail for home.

They encounter the East India Company&#x27;s China Fleet, returning to England unescorted. A day after departing the fleet, &quot;Surprise&quot; spots Linois&#x27;s squadron in the Indian Ocean. &quot;Surprise&quot; engages its smallest ship, the corvette &quot;Berceau&quot;, shredding her rigging; Jack bluffs by signaling to imaginary reinforcements beyond the horizon. &quot;Surprise&quot; pretends to be badly damaged while speeding back to the China Fleet to warn them and organise a defence. Though some of the merchant captains want to flee before Linois arrives, Jack convinces them that the only way out of the situation is to fight. The largest ships of the China Fleet are disguised as men-of-war and Jack distributes some of his officers to help them during the battle. As the French squadron closes on the Indiamen, &quot;Surprise&quot; engages Linois&#x27;s warship, the &quot;Marengo&quot;; she is outgunned and in peril when one of the Indiamen suddenly engages the French ship from the other side, forcing &quot;Marengo&quot; to disengage. Damage forces Linois to abandon the chase in order to refit.

Ashore in Calcutta, Aubrey receives an enthusiastic welcome from the merchants, including Canning, who are happy to pay for &quot;Surprise&quot; repairs. As a personal reward, Canning offers Jack the opportunity to transport a chest of jewels as freight, which will earn him a portion of the cargo&#x27;s value upon his arrival in England. Knowing the money will be enough to clear the last of his debts so he can marry Sophia, he immediately writes to her, asking her to meet him in Madeira.

During the refit, Stephen asks Diana for her answer to his marriage proposal, but Canning suddenly appears. In a fit of jealousy he slaps Stephen, who responds by challenging him to a duel. Canning&#x27;s shot hits Stephen in the ribs, but Stephen&#x27;s hits Canning in the heart, killing him. Stephen convinces Diana to return to England on a merchant ship that will leave immediately rather than tend to him as he recovers aboard the &quot;Surprise&quot;. With the help of Aubrey, M&#x27;Alister, and a mirror, Stephen stoically operates on himself, removing the bullet lodged beneath his rib. Jack tends to his friend during the worst of his fever. In his delirium the usually private Stephen voices many of his thoughts and secrets.

Arriving at Madeira, Jack is dismayed to learn that Sophia is not there; Stephen finds a note from Diana returning the ring he gave her and explaining that she has travelled to America with a wealthy man named Johnstone, whom she has agreed to marry. Stephen is devastated. Within a day&#x27;s sailing, Jack overtakes the frigate HMS &quot;Ethalion&quot; under his loyal friend Heneage Dundas and finds that Sophia is aboard. Jack wants to get married immediately, but Sophia insists they do it properly, when they return to England.

==Allusions to historical events==
The capture of the Spanish treasure fleet, with Jack in command of HMS &quot;Lively&quot;, is based on the historical Action of 5 October 1804 (also known as the Battle of Cape Santa Maria), and is recounted at the end of the preceding novel &quot;Post Captain&quot;. In the fictionalized version, Aubrey replaces Captain Graham Hamond as acting commander of HMS &quot;Lively&quot; when Hamond is required to attend Parliament; in reality, Hamond was present during the battle. This battle also features in the 1962 novel &quot;Hornblower and the Hotspur&quot;, the last-published full-length novel in C. S. Forester&#x27;s Horatio Hornblower series. Forester adds Hornblower in the &quot;Hotspur&quot; alongside the five British ships sent to intercept the fleet.

At the opening of &quot;HMS Surprise&quot;, the Admiralty discusses what to do with the Spanish gold seized during the battle, for which the victorious British captains and their crews, including Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, expect a substantial share of the prize money, as was usual. However, the huge amount of bullion seized leads the Admiralty to declare it a droit belonging to the Admiralty itself, on the technicality that Spain had not yet legally declared war on England and therefore the treasure cannot be considered a war prize. The same result was also decided in real life, with the British captains receiving far smaller rewards than they might otherwise have won.

After he is advanced his reward and freed from the debtors&#x27; prison, Aubrey is given command of HMS &quot;Surprise&quot;, a fictional version of the historical HMS &quot;Surprise&quot;, with a different backstory. She becomes the most important fictional ship in the Aubrey–Maturin series.

The &quot;cutting out&quot; (capturing while in port, either at anchor or berthed) of HMS &quot;Hermione&quot; refers to an actual event involving HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; that occurred in 1799.

Aubrey&#x27;s defense of the China Fleet against a French squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand, Comte de Linois, in the Indian Ocean is a fictionalization of the real-life Battle of Pulo Aura in February 1804. In reality, the merchant ships of the East India Company defended themselves, without any King&#x27;s ships escorting them. Commodore Nathaniel Dance gave the orders attributed to Aubrey, disguising several of the larger East Indiamen as Royal Navy men-of-war and forming the line of battle which successfully intimidated Linois into abandoning the pursuit after only a brief exchange of fire. Dance was celebrated for his aggressive tactics during the battle and later knighted for his heroism, while Linois was criticized for failing to capture the extremely valuable fleet.

==Reviews==
Valerie Webster writing in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; found that &quot;His books can absorb and enthral landlubbers like myself who do not even know the difference between a jib-boom and a taffrail.&quot;

&quot;Library Journal&quot; reviewed this novel as part of an abridged audio edition, finding &quot;superb depictions of life&quot; and highly recommended it, mentioning &quot;O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s exquisitely accurate historical detail&quot;. Mark Pumphrery, writing for &quot;Library Journal&quot;, remarks the friendship of the Aubrey and Maturin, which &quot;plays out against an expanse of ocean, from India to the Atlantic, with a full complement of battles and adventures at sea for devotees of naval fiction.&quot;

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; liked the plot but, unlike the other reviewers, found the nautical detail sometimes overwhelming. They enjoy seeing the environment through Maturin&#x27;s eyes, and appreciate what drives Aubrey to engage with French admiral Linois, as Aubrey wants enough prize money to marry his true love. In sum, &quot;Stretching its genre but never escaping it, the novel will impress those who enjoy swashbucklers.&quot;

Helen Lucy Burk writing in the &quot;Irish Press&quot; said &quot;Few, very few, books have made my heart thud with excitement. &quot;H.M.S. Surprise&quot; managed it. I read it cruising through the tame Adriatic, and several times found myself forced to pace about the deck to calm my pulse...Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s erudition is phenomenal, as is his capacity for creating another completely believable world. He convinces with his total accuracy even in tiny details.&quot;

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted in three parts in the &quot;Afternoon Play&quot; strand on BBC Radio 4, adapted by Roger Danes and directed and produced by Bruce Young, with Aubrey played by David Robb and Maturin by Richard Dillane. The rest of the cast was:

*Preserved Killick – Jon Glover
*Barret Bonden – David Timson
*Sir Joseph Blaine – Struan Rodger
*Sophie Williams – Liz Sutherland
*Lieutenant Pullings – David Holt
*Lieutenant Simmons – Dan Starkey

*Arthur Stanhope – David Timson
*Midshipman Callow – Carl Prekopp
*Tobias Atkins – Stephen Critchlow
*Lieutenant Nichols – Dan Starkey
*Midshipman Babbington – Chris Pavlo
*Canning – Chris Pavlo

Several of the novel&#x27;s plot elements, including Maturin performing surgery on himself to remove the bullet, were adapted into the 2003 film &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot;.

This novel was first published by Lippincott in the US and Collins in the UK, both in 1973. W W Norton issued a reprint in the USA 21 years after the initial publication as part of its reissue in paperback of all the novels in the series prior to 1991. Except for the 1973 Collins hardback and 1976 Fontana paperback UK editions above, the list of editions is drawn from Fantastic Fiction.

The process of reissuing the novels initially published prior to 1991 was in full swing in 1991, as the whole series gained a new and wider audience, as Mark Howowitz describes in writing about &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;, the fourteenth novel in the series and initially published in 1991.

Two of my favourite friends are fictitious characters; they live in more than a dozen volumes always near at hand. Their names are Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, and their creator is a 77-year-old novelist named Patrick O&#x27;Brian, whose 14 books about them have been continuously in print in England since the first, &quot;Master and Commander,&quot; was published in 1970.

O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s British fans include T. J. Binyon, Iris Murdoch, A. S. Byatt, Timothy Mo and the late Mary Renault, but, until recently, this splendid saga of two serving officers in the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars was unavailable in this country, apart from the first few instalments which went immediately out of print. Last year, however, W. W. Norton decided to reissue the series in its entirety, and so far nine of the 14 have appeared here, including the most recent chapter, &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;.

<text>Breadsticks, also known as grissini (: grissino; Piedmontese: &quot;ghërsin&quot;, ), are generally pencil-sized sticks of crisp, dry baked bread that originated in the Italian city of Turin, Piedmont.

==History==
It is believed that the breadstick originated in 1643, when a Florentine abbot described a long-shaped and &quot;bone-thin&quot; bread being made in Lanzo Torinese, a town outside of Turin. Tradition states, however, that it originated in the region of Piedmont in the 17th century, invented by a baker called Antonio Brunero, from Turin. It was a food that was intended to be easier to digest for the Duke Victor Amadeus II of Savoy, who had digestive problems in his childhood.

==Serving==
In Italian restaurants, breadsticks are often offered as an appetizer (antipasto), especially in their traditional shape, together with or replacing bread, which is commonly provided with all meals. They may also be combined with ingredients such as prosciutto. This appears to be the case with restaurants in the United States as well; in some instances or regions, they may be a type that is larger than pencil-sized, as well as soft instead of hard.

In many North American restaurants, breadsticks are soft, frequently topped with butter, garlic, and cheese when served as appetizers; as a dessert item, they can be topped with cinnamon, sugar, and icing.

Pre-made, dried breadsticks can be found being sold in markets as a quick snack or a pre-meal appetizer for home use, somewhat similar to a cracker. In Italy they are often consumed as a snack on their own, but in the United States they are usually served with a dip of some sort, such as cheese.

Another recipe for breadsticks, called &quot;rosquilletas&quot;, exists in the Valencian Community.

<text>Martigny (; , ; ) is the capital city of the district of Martigny, canton of Valais, Switzerland. It lies at an elevation of , and its population is approximately 20,000 inhabitants (&quot;Martignerains&quot; or &quot;Octoduriens&quot;). It is a junction of roads joining Italy, France and Switzerland. One road links it over the Great St. Bernard Pass to Aosta (Italy), and the other over the col de la Forclaz to Chamonix (France). In winter, Martigny is known for its numerous nearby Alp ski resorts such as Verbier.

==Geography==
Martigny lies at an elevation of , about south-southeast of Montreux. It is on the left foothills of the steep hillsides of the Rhone Valley, at the foot of the Swiss Alps, and is located at the point where the southwestern-flowing Rhone turns ninety degrees northward and heads toward Lake Geneva. The river La Drance flows from the southern Valais Alps (Wallis) through Martigny and joins the Rhone from the left just after Rhone&#x27;s distinctive, almost rectangular change in direction.

Martigny has an area, (as of the 2004/09 survey), of . Of this area, 31.5% is used for agricultural purposes, while 39.8% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 23.3% is settled (buildings or roads) and 5.3% is unproductive land.

In 1964 the current municipality was created with the merger of Martigny-Ville and Martigny-Bourg.

On 1 January 2021 the former municipality of Charrat merged into the municipality of Martigny.
==History==


The Gaulish name of the settlement in the 1st century BC was either &quot;Octodurus&quot; or &quot;Octodurum&quot; (whence Martigny is sometimes also called &quot;Octodure&quot; in French), an oppidum or vicus of the Veragri. 
Octodurus was conquered by the Roman Republic in 57 BC, and occupied by Servius Galba with the twelfth legion and some cavalry in order to protect the strategically important pass of Poeninus (now known as the Great St. Bernard), by which road the &quot;mercatores&quot; had used to travel at great risk as well as paying great tolls. (&quot;B. G.&quot; iii. 1.) Galba, after capturing many local strongholds and receiving the submission of the people, sent troops into the country of the Nantuates, and with his remaining army determined to winter in Octodurus. Galba gave one part of the town to the Gauls to winter in, and assigned the other to his troops. He fortified himself with a ditch and rampart, and thought he was safe. He was, however, suddenly attacked by the Gauls before his defences were complete or all his supplies were brought into the camp, resulting in the Battle of Octodurus, and a very indecisive Roman victory; the Romans estimated the Gaulish force at more than 30,000, and Caesar says that more than a third part were destroyed; nevertheless Galba, &quot;declining to try fortune too often&quot; (&quot;B. G.&quot; iii. 6), burned the hamlet and retreated to the Province the next day.

Octodurus was later on joined to the Roman Empire, as part of the Alpes Poeninae province. Pliny (iii. c. 20) says that the Octodurenses received the &quot;Latinitas&quot; (&quot;Latio donati&quot;). Octodurus declined over the following decades, and between AD 41 and 47 (during the reign of Claudius), a new Roman colony named &quot;Forum Claudii Augusti&quot;, later renamed &#x27;to &quot;Forum Claudii Vallensium&quot;, was established nearby to take the role of capital of the Vallis Poenina province. The town appears in the Antonine Itinerary and in the &quot;Tabula Peutingeriana&quot;. In the &quot;Notit. Prov.&quot;, the place is called Civitas Vallensium Octodurus. At a later period it was called Forum Claudii Vallensium Octodurensium, as an inscription shows.

An episcopal see was established here in the 4th century (moved in the 6th century to Sion), making the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sion the oldest bishopric in what is now Switzerland. The first historically attested bishop of Octodurus was Theodulus (died in 391), who was present at the Council of Aquileia in 381. A restored Roman amphitheatre, temples, citizen living quarters, and thermal baths can be seen in Martigny today. One authority speaks of the remains of a Roman aqueduct at Martigny. Many coins, and other memorials of the Roman time, have been found about the place.

There are no records of the town during the early medieval period. 
In the Middle Ages, the town took Martin of Tours as its patron saint, and became known by the German name &quot;Martinach&quot;, recorded in Latinized form as &quot;Martiniacum&quot; in 1018.
The church of Martigny, presumably at the site of the ancient cathedral, was consecrated to St. Mary in 1177, and to &quot;Notre-Dame-des-Champs&quot; in 1420.
Martigny was placed under the protection of the House of Savoy in 1351, passing to Saint-Maurice in 1475, as the seven tithings (&quot;Sieben Zenden&quot;) in treaty with the bishop of Sion and the canton of Bern seized all of the Lower Valais. 
The town was granted a degree of autonomy, its citizens being allowed to elect their own local officials, known as the &quot;syndics&quot; (but no judges, as justice lay with the bishopric until 1798).
The economy of Martigny was traditionally based on agriculture and viticulture. The town was often flooded by the Dranse, most severely in 1595 and in 1818.
From 1798 to 1802, Martigny was part of the imperialist Napoleonic Republic of Valais, then in the Rhodanic Republic, which passed to France from 1810 to 1814.
The Valais/Wallis passed to Switzerland in 1815. 
In the 1840s, Martigny was the stage of a confrontation between the liberal-radical &quot;Young Switzerland&quot; and the conservative &quot;Old Switzerland&quot; movements, culminating in the Battle at the Trient of 21 May 1844, taking place a few kilometres outside town. The town was split into independent municipalities of &quot;Martigny-Ville&quot;, &quot;Charrat&quot;, &quot;Martigny-Bourg&quot; and &quot;Martigny-Combe&quot; in the 1830s. &quot;La Bâtiaz&quot; and &quot;Trient&quot; were further split off &quot;Martigny-Combe&quot; in 1845 and 1899, respectively. This administrative fragmentation of the town was reversed in the 20th century, with a fusion of Martigny-Ville with La Bâtiaz in 1956 and with Martigny-Bourg in 1964.

Martigny was connected to the Simplon railway in 1878, with a separate railway station built in 1906. It was connected to the Swiss motorway system in 1981 with the completion of the Great-St-Bernard exit of the A9. Martigny had a population of 2,545 in 1850, of 3,550 in 1900 and of 5,915 in 1950.

== Transportation ==
Martigny is on the high-speed Simplon line of the Swiss Federal Railway, SBB, which connects Italy (Domodossola) and southern Switzerland to northeastern Switzerland and the cities of Lausanne and Geneva. It also is the origin of narrow gauge railroads and bus routes that climb into the nearby mountains on both sides of the Rhone valley in which Martigny lies. One railroad goes west to Chamonix, France, crossing the border at Le Chatelard. The other railroad goes southeast to Chable and Orsieres. The regional transportation agency known as TMR SA (Transports de Martigny et Regions) operates this service and the ski trains known as the Mount-Blanc Express (to Chamonix) and the St. Bernard Express (to Orsieres). See the transportation map provided by the TMR website in the External Links section below. 
Thanks to Martigny&#x27;s transport connections the winter sports regions of the &quot;4 Vallées&quot;, Portes-du-Soleil and Ovronnaz are easily reached.

It has been nearly one century since the two original railway companies Martigny-Orsières (MO) and Martigny-Châtelard (MC) began serving the valleys of Entremont and Trient. In 1990, the boards of directors of MO and MC decided to combine for common management, however each company would maintain an independent status. Two new trains were started: the Saint-Bernard Express for the MO, and the Mont Blanc Express for the MC. Later the Octodure-Voyages and Orsières-Octodure-Transports companies were taken over. TMRSA is an important employer in the region with some 180 permanent staff.

The French holiday resort of Chamonix is accessible from Martigny in one-and-a-half hours using the narrow-gauge tracks of the &quot;Mont Blanc Express&quot;.

<text>Angela Anaconda is a Canadian animated children&#x27;s television series created by Joanna Ferrone and Sue Rose that originally aired from 1999 to 2001. 65 episodes were produced.

== Premise ==
The show focuses on the adventures of an eight-year-old girl named Angela in the fictional town of Tapwater Springs. Other characters include Angela&#x27;s three best friends and several antagonists. The primary antagonist is Nanette Manoir.

== Episodes ==

== Characters ==

=== Main ===
*Angela Anaconda (voiced by Sue Rose) is a tomboyish, imaginative, freckle-faced eight-year-old girl who eschews the femininity commonly associated with other girls her age. She resides in the town of Tapwater Springs with her parents, two dimwitted teenage twin brothers Mark and Derek, her younger sister Lulu and best friends, Johnny Abatti, Gina Lash and Gordy Rhinehart. In every episode of the series, Angela will engage in at least one daydream sequence. The majority of these feature her rivals Nanette Manoir and Mrs. Brinks, as Angela seeks vengeance on them in unrealistic ways. Angela often imagines unusual things happening to her enemies, especially Nanette, including getting tossed into the air during an ice routine and falling through the ice, or getting turned into a flashcard, among other things.
*Johnny Abatti (voiced by Al Mukadam) is a sweet but dim Italian-American boy. His parents are never seen in the show and he appears to be under the care of his grandmother Carmella and uncle Nicky, the latter of whom often pressures Johnny into manhood (particularly in the episode &quot;Johnny Learns to Swing&quot;). Regarded as an attractive student, Johnny takes pride in his pompadour hairstyle. Nanette Manoir harbours a crush on him and tries to flirt with him frequently, referring to him as &quot;John&quot; and inviting him to exclusive Manoir events. He normally brings Angela, Gina and Gordy along against their will. Despite this preferential treatment, Johnny remains utterly clueless about Nanette&#x27;s affections. Although he never admits it, Johnny may have strong feelings for Angela, as he becomes resentful of any rival for her affections. On Valentine&#x27;s Day, Johnny sends Angela flowers but forgets to sign the attached card, accidentally giving the credit for his gift to Angela&#x27;s imaginary boyfriend Bob. Johnny likes to pick his nose and shoot spit balls.
*Gina Lash (voiced by Bryn McAuley) is the smartest child in her grade. Possessing encyclopedic knowledge, an impressive vocabulary and a voracious appetite, Gina routinely dispenses reason and insight to her friends. However, she will always participate in whatever scheme they are partaking. Gina shares many interests with her friends, but her thirst for knowledge has led her to pursue a variety of other hobbies; she owns a microscope and other scientific paraphernalia. Gina is best known for her appetite, which rivals that of any adult. She is always hungry and can even fall prey to Nanette Manoir if she is bribed with her gourmet chef&#x27;s cooking. Gina&#x27;s favorite foods include Abatti&#x27;s Pizza, cinnamon swirls, jiggly fruit and Tastee Swirl ice cream. Gina worships the mascot for Tastee Swirl, a man with a whipped ice cream head who dispenses frozen treats from his truck to the local children. She also idolizes the maker of her favorite cupcake snack, Tiny Dottie, as a professional food entrepreneur she wants to be like. Gina lives with her mother, who is single (until she begins dating Gordy&#x27;s father Coach Rhinehart). Her father is never seen or mentioned on the show, implying that her mother is divorced or widowed. Gina also owns a pet turtle named Sheldon who loves to eat carrots. In the episode &quot;Hooray for Chanukah&quot;, it is revealed that Gina is Jewish and uses her great-grandmother&#x27;s menorah every year.
*Gordy Rhinehart (voiced by Edward Glen) is a kind, sensitive and artistic boy with asthma who prefers pressing flowers, housework and writing poetry instead of &quot;dangerous&quot; activities like tag or hide-and-seek. He has a love of ballet and nature, and embraces all things pretty and lovely. He is best known for his many allergies. Gordy wears large, square spectacles and a blue vest. He is the complete opposite of his burly and macho ex-Army soldier father Coach Rhinehart. Despite being so different from each other, their father/son relationship is very strong and they show genuine love and concern for one another. The coach enjoys the strawberry soufflés, hand-embroidered towels and pillow cases Gordy makes in his free time. Gordy loves animals and is the proud owner of an immaculately groomed dog named Fabio. He is an expert on pet care and worries about the welfare of any animal entrusted to Angela. Gordy spent almost an entire episode (&quot;Gordy in a Plastic Bubble&quot;) wearing rubber gloves and a face mask, refusing to leave his house, after looking at an eyelash under a microscope. Gordy has a huge crush on Gina Lash.
*Nanette Manoir (voiced by Ruby Smith-Merovitz) is the who speaks with a snobbish faux-French accent. Her hair is golden blonde and styled into long Victorian-style ringlets in emulation of her mother&#x27;s look. Nanette&#x27;s doting parents fail to see how rotten their daughter acts at school, as she is spoiled and never punished for things which she does wrong. She is proud of her looks, constantly bouncing her curled hair. Nanette&#x27;s interests are a posh variety of activities such as baton twirling, ballet, painting, gymnastics and ice skating. She uses her family&#x27;s wealth and high status as a way of asserting her superiority over her classmates, especially Angela. Because of her French name and heritage, Nanette believes that she can actually understand and speak French. This belief is shared only by her mother, Bunny. She adds misapplied French phrases to most of her conversations, explaining their meanings incorrectly; for example, she believes &quot;liaison&quot; (a close bond or connection) is French for &quot;lesson&quot;, &quot;crème brûlée&quot; (singed cream) is French for &quot;prove it&quot;, and &quot;pomme de terre&quot; (potato) is French for &quot;apple polisher&quot;.
*Mrs. Ephigenia Brinks (voiced by Richard Binsley) is a middle-aged woman and a dedicated third grade teacher with a rather masculine voice. She wears a grey beehive wig, which hides her short ginger hair and dresses in a long-skirted schoolmarm dress. She is easily manipulated and plays favorites, her decisions always favoring Nanette. Mrs. Brinks dislikes Angela and is very strict and callous with her. Mrs. Brinks likes to believe that she is sophisticated and succumbs easily to flattery. She considers Angela a bizarre, troublemaking and wayward girl and constantly punishes her. She and her husband Connie are rumored to be weekend nudists. Angela and her gang often peer into the Brinks&#x27; backyard from Angela&#x27;s tree house to find out if this rumor is true, though the show only shows Angela and her friends&#x27; reactions to what they see. In &quot;Brinks of No Return&quot;, Mr. Brinks reveals that he and Mrs. Brinks used to have a very loving relationship before Nanette came into her life. In the episode &quot;Earhart&#x27;s Heirloom&quot; Mrs. Brinks claims to have the compass of Amelia Earhart and promises to show it to the class if they behave for a month, only for them to discover that the compass is fake. Brinks has an artificial hip which prevents her from dancing.

=== Recurring ===
*Astronaut Bob (voiced by Robert Smith) is the local hero of Tapwater Springs whom Angela and her friends lionize. As his name suggests, he was an astronaut presumably during the height of the Space Race who got to walk on the Moon. He currently spends his time as a volunteer for the town&#x27;s space museum, and lending his likeness to boxes of the cereal Astro Nutties as well as other products and possessions. 
*Candy May (voiced by Linda Kash) is an incredibly dim child who appears to cut her own hair and wears a shirt with a unicorn decal on it. She has long red hair in a ribbon. She hesitates a lot, draws her words out, and often confuses herself. She is not allowed near sharp objects and loves playing with glitter and paste. She may be older than the other kids and is unsurprisingly the tallest child in the classroom, but this is due to being held back a year due to her low intelligence. Her presence is marked by a slow instrumental version of &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;. 
*Carmella &quot;Nonna&quot; Abatti (voiced by Linda Kash) is Johnny&#x27;s grandmother and chief proprietor of Abatti&#x27;s Pizzeria. A talented cook and nurturer, Nonna is very hospitable to Johnny and his friends. She is also not afraid to speak her mind about things, particularly her son Nicky&#x27;s lifestyle choices or Gina Lash&#x27;s appetite. Additionally, Nonna is highly superstitious, most notably regarding &quot;Chi Mallochio&quot; (or, the evil eye), as evidenced when Nicky starts enjoying the success at the expense of Sabatto&#x27;s, the town&#x27;s rival pizzeria. In her younger days, she was good friends with Angela&#x27;s Grandmother, Louisa.
*Coach Rhinehart (voiced by Robert Smith) is Gordy&#x27;s hyper masculine father as well as a big sports enthusiast, ex-Army officer, football coach, Nature Survival Counselor, and PE teacher of Tapwater Springs Elementary School. He speaks with a stereotypical coach/drill sergeant voice and is usually shown dressed in a bright orange tracksuit. Like Gina&#x27;s mom, Coach Rhinehart&#x27;s spouse is not shown implying he is either a widower, divorced, or living apart from his wife. He is the second of the Tapwater teachers to show anger at Nanette Manoir. In spite of being fiercely competitive and obsessed with physical activity of any kind, he is accepting of his son&#x27;s personality and artistic interests, encouraging him to be himself, and not projecting his image of manhood onto him. His first name has never been revealed canonically.
*Conrad &quot;Connie&quot; Brinks (voiced by Richard Binsley) is the henpecked husband of Ephegenia Brinks. In contrast to his wife, Conrad is skinny, soft-spoken, and even tempered. He is very loving and patient especially towards his wife, and dismisses her shouting with a resigned &quot;yes dear&quot;. He secretly resents the relationship Nanette has with Mrs. Brinks, referring to her on one occasion as &quot;little Naninski Buttinski&quot;. Conrad works for the town&#x27;s public-access television station where he has pull enough to host a program for ham radio enthusiasts like himself, and once coached an ice skating class for the town&#x27;s children. In his younger years Conrad was an avid bowler and allegedly the dreamiest boy in all of Tapwater Springs. He even used to go out with Johnny and Angela&#x27;s grandmothers before meeting Mrs. Brinks. Like his wife, Conrad also is rumored to engage in weekend nudism.
*Howell (voiced by Robert Smith) and Bunny Manoir (voiced by Julie Lemieux) are the equally rich and vapid parents of Angela&#x27;s primary nemesis Nanette Manoir. Though Nanette claims she is fully French, Howell speaks with a strong Massachusetts accent, a la John F. Kennedy, while Bunny has a Southern accent. Howell works as a proprietor of a construction firm. Bunny spends her days presumably as a lady of leisure. Both are very overindulgent of their daughter, and most of the time they fail to notice let alone punish Nanette&#x27;s rotten attitude. Much like their daughter, Howell and Bunny have little regard for William and Geneva Anaconda as people. 
*January Cole (voiced by Olivia Garratt) and Karlene Trainor (voiced by Annick Obonsawin) are Nanette&#x27;s servants who follow her around wherever she goes. Sporting bouffant hairdos, preppy clothing, and beauty moles, they are very concerned with their appearance and look to Nanette for fashion guidance (mainly about facials and makeup). Despite their unyielding devotion to Nanette, they are fickle. 
*Jimmy Jamal (voiced by Kevin Duhaney) is an athletic boy in Angela&#x27;s class. He is frequently seen playing a handheld video game and talking about his Turbo Trainers, which make him run very fast. He is the son of the mayor of Tapwater Springs.
*Josephine Praline (voiced by Cara Pifko) is a devout Catholic who acts as a moral rudder for her classmates. She is loving and forgiving, but stern when she sees injustice. Josephine often refers to others as &quot;my child&quot;. She set up a confessional in the girls&#x27; washroom, where her friends come to talk to her about their stresses and worries. She is well liked by her classmates, but Mrs. Brinks cares very little about her. Josephine urges Angela to learn to love her enemies and see the good in Nanette instead of hating her, but is surprised when she cannot find any good qualities herself. Josephine comes from a large family of at least nineteen brothers and sisters. 
*Mark and Derek Anaconda (both voiced by Rob Tinkler) are Angela&#x27;s twin older brothers. Though physically and intellectually similar, Mark has blonde hair and wears a white Jersey with the number 14, while Derek brown hair and wears a plain orange shirt. Moreover, Derek&#x27;s voice is higher than Mark&#x27;s. Both of the brothers are the secondary antagonists of the show, constantly bullying and belittling Angela and her friends. Though dull-witted, each roast their sister at every turn; high-fiving and head-butting each other when one makes a particularly &quot;witty&quot; remark. They refer to nearly everyone as &quot;dude&quot; (regardless of the gender and/or social status of the individual in question) and tend to judge how good something is in life by acknowledging when things &quot;rock&quot;/&quot;rule&quot;. Despite their irresponsibility and lack of interpersonal skills, Mark and Derek have held jobs at the town country club as caddies and at a fast food eatery when they fail to pay for their meal. Both enjoy contact sports and are on the town football team, much to Coach Rhinehart&#x27;s consternation. Their presence is marked by a heavy metal riff vaguely similar to the common &#x27;Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah&#x27; chant, traditionally sung by children to mock others. 
*Nicholas &quot;Uncle Nicky&quot; Abatti (voiced by Ron Rubin) is Johnny&#x27;s swinging bachelor uncle and co-owner of Abatti&#x27;s Pizzeria. While generally good natured towards his nephew as well as Angela, Gina and Gordy, Uncle Nicky is also childish, and obsessed with fast women, faster cars, gambling and disco. His clothes usually consist of sunglasses, gold chains and leisure suits. As a child he was known as a troublemaker in Mrs. Brinks&#x27; class; earning the nickname &quot;Fancy Pants&quot; and leaving his legacy in the form of an eternal spitball. Uncle Nicky is more often than not escorted by two nameless babes (a blonde on his left and a redhead on his right) wherever he goes, a testament to him being a ladies man. Despite this, he has been known to publicly express interest in Gina&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth Lash. 
*William (voiced by Diego Matamoros) and Geneva Anaconda (voiced by Allegra Fulton) are the parents of Mark, Derek, Angela and Lulu Anaconda. Though Bill enjoys inventing, none of his inventions have really taken off (save for the Food Rejuvenator 3000, whose potential success he sabotaged in the end out of fear that success would spoil his family). To make ends meet, he works as a salesman selling ceramic dancing pigs and expandable foam in a can. Geneva is a struggling artist who gets by on commissions and teaching positions at the community college. In spite of being busy with their respective jobs and financial situation, both are caring and provide Angela and her siblings with love and support.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Angela Anaconda&quot; received high ratings and mixed reviews from critics. Barb Stuewe of &quot;The Ledger&quot; noted that while &quot;the humor doesn&#x27;t always come off,&quot; the show &quot;is sometimes quite funny.&quot; Evan Levine of the &quot;Rome News-Tribune&quot; was critical of the show&#x27;s look and feel, stating that &quot;the series&#x27; unique, cut-out style of animation seems trendy for its own sake.&quot; Scott Moore of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called &quot;Angela Anaconda&quot; &quot;more imaginative than anything ever seen in art class.&quot; Co-creator Sue Rose noted in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; that despite having a primarily female cast, the show had become popular with both sexes. She writes, &quot;the most frequent feedback we get is from parents of boys ... they say: &#x27;My boys watch it and they love it. I never thought they would.&#x27; These are not just girls&#x27; shows, they&#x27;re kids shows.&quot;

&quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; gave it the award for best children&#x27;s show of 2001, call it a &quot;cute and sassy animation&quot;.

=== Ratings ===
During the series&#x27; time on Fox Family, it received consistently high ratings and was commonly marathoned by the channel.

<text>Ivan Antonovich (Antipovich) Yefremov, sometimes Efremov (; 23 April 1908 – 5 October 1972) was a Soviet paleontologist, science-fiction author and social thinker. He founded taphonomy, the study of fossilization patterns.

==Biography==
He was born in the village of Vyritsa in Saint Petersburg Governorate on 23 April 1908. His parents divorced during the Russian Revolution. His mother married a Red Army commander and left the children in Kherson to be cared for by an aunt who soon died of typhus. Yefremov survived on his own for some time, after which he joined a Red Army unit as a &quot;son of the regiment&quot; and went to Perekop with it. In 1921, he was discharged and went to Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg) to study. He completed his education there while combining his studies with a variety of odd jobs. He later commented that &quot;the Revolution was also my own liberation from philistinism&quot; ().

=== Academic career ===

In 1956, due to the influence of academician Petr Sushkin, he became interested in paleontology. Yefremov entered the Leningrad State University but dropped out later. As early as 19, he made several discoveries and published a monograph co-authored with Alexey Bystrow, which was later awarded by the Linnean Society of London.

In the mid-1930s, he took part in several palaeontological expeditions to the Volga region, the Urals, and Central Asia. He headed a research laboratory at the Institute of Paleontology. In 1935, he took exit examinations and graduated from the Leningrad Mining Institute. The same year he got his Candidate of Science degree in biological sciences. In 1941, he got his doctorate in biological sciences. In 1943 he received the title of Professor.

In the 1940s, Yefremov developed a new scientific field called taphonomy, for which he was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1952. His book, &quot;Taphonomy&quot;, was published in 1950. He applied many taphonomic principles in his fieldwork during a palaeontological expedition to the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. During these years, he was recognized as a successful scientist and won a state science award. Many American researchers called Yefremov the father of modern paleontology, who merged geological and palaeontological data into a single science.

=== Literature career ===
Yefremov wrote his first work of fiction, a short story, in 1944. His first novel &quot;The Land of Foam&quot; (&quot;Great Arc&quot;, 1946) was published in 1946. The &quot;Road of Winds&quot; novel was written on a basis of scientific expeditions in Mongolia (1946–1949). His most widely recognized science fiction novel &quot;Andromeda Nebula&quot; came out in 1957. This book is a panegyric to utopian &quot;communist&quot; future of mankind. The society developed such that there is no material inequality between individuals, and each person is able to pursue their self-development unrestricted. The intergalactic communication system binds mankind into the commonwealth of sentient civilizations of the Universe - the Great Ring of Civilizations. The book became a moral guideline for many people in the Soviet Union. Besides the heavy didactic aspect, the book also contained an interesting space travel adventure subplot, so people appreciated it for its educational and entertainment value. Algis Budrys compared Yefremov&#x27;s fiction style to that of Hugo Gernsback.

With the time the socio-political circumstances in the world changed to more and more worrying, that changes were reflected in &quot;The Bull&#x27;s Hour&quot; novel. Yefremov tried to give a warning about forthcoming catastrophes in environment, ethics and social sphere. Many considered the novel as a disguised criticism of the USSR, though the later researchers proved it wrong. The novel mostly showed the dead-end perspectives of Maoism and gangster capitalism. The government accused the novel of Anti-Sovietism and banned it from publishing up to the end of the 1980s.

Yefremov&#x27;s last novel was &quot;Thais of Athens&quot;, published in 1972. The narration was placed in the times of Alexander the Great. Its multiple topics included little-known female cults, questions of women inner worlds, their roles in global history; he raised questions of religion, cultural genesis, search for beauty and truth.

==Personal life==
Yefremov was married three times. His first marriage in the early 1930s, to Ksenia Svitalskaya, was short-lived and ended in divorce. In 1936, he married paleontologist Elena Dometevna Konzhukova, with whom they had a son, Allan Ivanovich Yefremov. After his wife died on 1 August 1961, he married Taisiya Iosifovna Yukhnevskaya in 1962. His last novel &quot;Thais of Athens&quot;, which was posthumously published in 1973, is dedicated to her.

<doc id="657067" wikidata="Q496696" url="?curid=657067" title="Powdered milk">
<text>Powdered milk, also called milk powder, dried milk, or dry milk, is a manufactured dairy product made by evaporating milk to dryness. One purpose of drying milk is to preserve it; milk powder has a far longer shelf life than liquid milk and does not need to be refrigerated, due to its low moisture content. Another purpose is to reduce its bulk for the economy of transportation. Powdered milk and dairy products include such items as dry whole milk, nonfat (skimmed) dry milk, dry buttermilk, dry whey products and dry dairy blends. Many exported dairy products conform to standards laid out in &quot;Codex Alimentarius&quot;.

Powdered milk is used for food as an additive, for health (nutrition), and also in biotechnology (saturating agent).

==History and manufacture==

While Marco Polo wrote of Mongolian Tatar troops in the time of Kublai Khan who carried sun-dried skimmed milk as &quot;a kind of paste&quot;, the first modern production process for dried milk was invented by the Russian doctor Osip Krichevsky in 1802. The first commercial production of dried milk was organized by the Russian chemist M. Dirchoff in 1832. In 1855, T. S. Grimwade took a patent on a dried milk procedure, though William Newton had patented a vacuum drying process as early as 1837.

In modern times, powdered milk is usually made by spray drying nonfat skimmed milk, whole milk, buttermilk or whey. Pasteurized milk is first concentrated in an evaporator to approximately 50 percent milk solids. The resulting concentrated milk is then sprayed into a heated chamber where the water almost instantly evaporates, leaving fine particles of powdered milk solids.

Alternatively, the milk can be dried by drum drying. Milk is applied as a thin film to the surface of a heated drum, and the dried milk solids are then scraped off. However, powdered milk made this way tends to have a cooked flavour, due to caramelization caused by greater heat exposure.

Another process is freeze drying, which preserves many nutrients in milk, compared to drum drying.

The drying method and the heat treatment of the milk as it is processed alters the properties of the milk powder, such as its solubility in cold water, its flavour, and its bulk density.

==Food and health uses==
Powdered milk is frequently used in the manufacture of infant formula, confectionery such as chocolate and caramel candy, and in recipes for baked goods where adding liquid milk would render the product too thin. Powdered milk is also widely used in various sweets such as the Indian milk balls known as gulab jamun and a popular Indian sweet delicacy (sprinkled with desiccated coconut) known as chum chum (made with skim milk powder). Many no-cook recipes that use nut butters use powdered milk to prevent the nut butter from turning liquid by absorbing the oil.

Powdered milk is also a common item in UN food aid supplies, fallout shelters, warehouses, and wherever fresh milk is not a viable option. It is widely used in many developing countries because of reduced transport and storage costs (reduced bulk and weight, no refrigerated vehicles). Like other dry foods, it is considered nonperishable and is favored by survivalists, hikers, and others requiring nonperishable, easy-to-prepare food.

Because of its resemblance to cocaine and other drugs, powdered milk is sometimes used in filmmaking as a non-toxic prop that may be insufflated.

===Reconstitution===
The weight of nonfat dry milk (NFDM) to use is about 10% of the water weight. Alternatively, when measuring by volume rather than weight, one cup of fluid milk from powdered milk requires one cup of water and one-third cup of powdered milk.

===Nutritional value===
Milk powders contain all 21 standard amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, and are high in soluble vitamins and minerals. According to USAID, the typical average amounts of major nutrients in the unreconstituted nonfat dry milk are (by weight) 36% protein, 52% carbohydrates (predominantly lactose), calcium 1.3%, potassium 1.8%. Whole milk powder, on the other hand, contains on average 25–27% protein, 36–38% carbohydrates, 26–40% fat, and 5–7% ash (minerals). In Canada, powdered milk must contain added vitamin D in an amount such that a reasonable daily intake of the milk will provide between 300 and 400 International units (IU) of vitamin D. However, inappropriate storage conditions, such as high relative humidity and high ambient temperature, can significantly degrade the nutritive value of milk powder.

Commercial milk powders are reported to contain oxysterols (oxidized cholesterol) in higher amounts than in fresh milk (up to 30 μg/g, versus trace amounts in fresh milk).
Oxysterols are derivatives of cholesterol that are produced either by free radicals or by enzymes. Some free radicals-derived oxysterols have been suspected of being initiators of atherosclerotic plaques. For comparison, powdered eggs contain even more oxysterols, up to 200 μg/g.

===Export market===
As of 2021, the largest producers of milk powder are New Zealand, China, Argentina and Brazil.

European production of milk powder in fiscal year 2019–2020 was estimated at around 3.0 million tonnes of which the main volume was exported in bulk packing or consumer packs.

Australia also has a significant milk powder export industry, exporting over 13,000 tonnes of skim and whole milk powder in fiscal year 2020–2021, to a value of approximately AUD $83 000 000.

Brands on the market include Nido, from the company Nestlé, Incolac from the company Milcobel, Dutch Lady from FrieslandCampina and Puck from Arla Foods.

Some of the largest businesses in the industry are Nestlé, Danone, Lactalis, Fonterra, FrieslandCampina, Dean Foods, Arla Foods, Dairy Farmers of America, Kraft Foods, Saputo, and Parmalat.

===Adulteration===
In the 2008 Chinese milk scandal, adulteration with melamine was found in Sanlu-brand infant formula, added to fool tests into reporting higher protein content. Thousands became ill, and some children died, after consuming the product.

===Contamination scare===
In August 2013, China temporarily suspended all milk powder imports from New Zealand, after a scare where botulism-causing bacteria were falsely detected in several batches of New Zealand-produced whey protein concentrate. As a result of the product recall, the New Zealand dollar slipped by 0.8% (to 77.78 US cents) based on expected losses in sales from this single commodity.

==Use in biotechnology==
Fat-free powdered milk is used as a saturating agent to block nonspecific binding sites on supports like blotting membranes (nitrocellulose, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) or nylon), preventing binding of further detection reagents and subsequent background. It may be referred as Blotto. The major protein of milk, casein, is responsible for most of the binding site saturation effect.

<doc id="657068" wikidata="Q235498" url="?curid=657068" title="Midori Ito">
<text>is a retired Japanese figure skater. She is the 1989 World champion and the 1992 Olympic silver medalist. She is the first woman to land a triple Axel in competition. At the 1988 Calgary Olympics, she became the first woman to land seven triple jumps in an Olympic free skating competition. She is widely recognised as one of the best figure skaters of all time.

==Career==
Ito started skating at age four at a rink in Nagoya and approached Machiko Yamada, who would become her coach throughout her career, on the same day. She landed her first triple jump at age 8. She went to live with her coach after her parents&#x27; divorce when she was 10.

Ito made her first appearance at a major international competition at the 1981 World Junior Championships. She placed 20th in the compulsory figures but won the free skating with a triple loop, a triple salchow, and two triple toe loop combinations. She finished 8th in the overall standings. At this event, the 11-year-old Ito was only 3&#x27;11&quot; tall and weighed 53 pounds. She was nicknamed the &quot;Jumping Flea&quot; due to her diminutive size and powerful jumps.

At the 1982 World Junior Championships, Ito won both the short program and free skating, but again weak compulsory figures kept her off the podium, in 6th place overall. Her free skating at this event included a triple flip and a triple toe loop-triple toe loop combination, and she landed a triple Lutz in the exhibition.

Ito did not compete at the 1983 World Junior event, which took place in December 1982, having broken her ankle earlier that year. In the fall of 1983, she made her senior international debut at the Ennia Challenge Cup in the Netherlands, a competition that featured the short program and free skating only, without compulsory figures. She finished second to Katarina Witt, who went on to win the Olympic title a few months later. Ito&#x27;s free skating included six triple jumps—flip, Lutz, loop, Salchow, and two toe loops—and she also completed a double loop-triple loop combination in the short program. At the 1984 World Junior Championships, she won both the short program and free skating but finished third overall due to a low placement in the compulsory figures. Ito also competed at the 1984 World Championships, where she finished 7th.

Ito won her first national championship in the 1985 season, but was unable to compete at that year&#x27;s World Championships after again breaking her ankle. From that time on, she increased the number of triple jumps she would attempt in the free skating. From 1985 to 1987, Ito&#x27;s free skating included seven triple jumps, but she would not always perform them cleanly. She would attempt a triple toe loop-triple toe loop combination, a Lutz jump, a flip jump, a loop jump, a Salchow jump in combination and another solo Salchow jump.

Ito placed 5th at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. In Calgary, she performed a double loop-triple loop in the short program, and seven triples in the free skating: Lutz, flip, double Axel-half loop-triple Salchow combination, loop, triple toe loop-triple toe loop combination, and another Salchow. She received the best technical scores given, two 5.8 and seven 5.9 marks, despite skating before the final flight. Her successful seven triple jumps were two more than any of the other skaters even attempted. Figure skating writer and historian Ellyn Kestnbaum speculates that Ito&#x27;s low marks in compulsory figures took her out of contention for a medal, which might have influenced the judges to award her lower scores in her short and free skating programs. Kestnbaum also states that her technically difficult free skate would have held up well against the most difficult programs performed by female single skaters ten years later, and that as of 2003, &quot;the quality of her jumps (apart from the less-preferred high wrapped position of her free leg while in the air) has never been equaled&quot;. Ito&#x27;s presentation marks also suffered, despite her &quot;high energy and pleasing cheerfulness&quot;, due to her tendency to keep her back and shoulders stiff, which resulted in a lack of fluidity and sublety in her musical expressiveness.

Later that same year, she perfected the triple Axel, which she had been working on since her early teens, and landed it at a regional competition in the Aichi Prefecture. She became the first woman to land it in international competition at the 1988 NHK Trophy. She then repeated the feat at the World Championships in 1989. Ito thus became the first woman to execute all six possible triple jumps in World competition: Axel, Lutz, flip, loop, Salchow, and toe loop. She was 6th in the compulsory figures but made up for it. She won the gold medal with a flawless free skating when she received 6.0s for technical merit from five of the nine judges, receiving 5.9s from the rest. Her win at the 1989 World Championships was the first world title in the sport for an Asian competitor.

During the start of the 1989–90 season, Ito made history again at the 1989 NHK Trophy competition, where she received a rare 6.0 technical/6.0 artistic score from the Hungarian judge, and again landed seven triples, including the triple Axel. At the 1990 World Championships, Ito was 10th after the compulsory figures but placed first in both the short program and the free skating and won the silver medal, second to Jill Trenary. She landed seven triple jumps in the free skating, including the triple Axel. Compulsory figures were eliminated from competitions following that season. Ito commented: &quot;In training, I spend about two-thirds of my time on the figures. So I will sort of miss them as part of my life. But I will not miss them in the actual event.&quot; In June 1990, she was invited to meet Emperor Akihito.

Ito had chronically sore knees due to her jumps. In February 1991, she underwent surgery to remove two glandular cysts in her throat and was in the hospital for 18 days. In March, at the 1991 World Championships, Ito collided with France&#x27;s Laetitia Hubert during a practice session – her hip and the top of her foot were bruised. In the short program, she placed her jump combination too close to the corner of the rink and fell into the opening in the boards for the television camera but was back on the ice within seconds. She finished 4th at the event.

At the 1991 Grand Prix International de Paris – a pre-Olympic event in Albertville – Ito beat Kristi Yamaguchi by completing a triple Axel and five other triple jumps in her free skating. During the warm-up before the free skating, she landed a triple Axel-triple toe loop jump combination.
The 1992 Winter Olympics did not include the compulsory figures which caused Ito to lose the World championships the year before even after winning the short program and free skating competitions. With only the short program and the free skating to perform, she became the heiress apparent to Katarina Witt. She planned to perform the triple Axel combined with a double toe loop for the jump combination requirement in the short program but changed it to a triple Lutz combination. Ito placed fourth in the short program when she fell on her triple Lutz jump. In comparison, Kristi Yamaguchi and Nancy Kerrigan completed their triple Lutz-double toe loop combinations and then placed one and two, respectively. The change may have an interesting origin. During a practice session, Surya Bonaly of France performed a backflip near her. Ito was nearly hit on the head and was obviously shaken. Subsequently, her practice with her triple Axel jumps turned out poorly, which may have led her to take it out of the original program. Ito&#x27;s free skating began with a failed triple Axel but she attempted it again at the end of her program and landed it successfully, becoming the first woman to land one in the Olympics. She won the silver medal, and apologized to her country for not winning the gold. Ito turned professional afterwards, bringing the triple Axel for the first time to the professional ranks, and performed with ice shows in Japan. She briefly returned to competitive skating in the 1995–96 season, but without her former success.

During the peak of her career, Ito performed much the same jump content as the top male skaters of the time. She was the first ladies&#x27; skater to perform a triple-triple jump combination and the first to perform the triple Axel. In March 1990, Jill Trenary said, &quot;I was in awe of how high she jumps.&quot; In 1990, Scott Hamilton said &quot;it will be 50 years before we see anything like Midori Ito again,&quot; and Toller Cranston, the same year, noted that &quot;she is beyond 6.0.&quot; Her mastery of triple jumps, including the triple axel, was the start of &quot;a new era in women&#x27;s skating&quot;, before several triple jumps, usually of five different types, became the norm in championship free skating programs.

Ito lit the Olympic Cauldron during the opening ceremonies of the 1998 Winter Olympics, appearing dressed as the physical representation of the Japanese sun goddess Amaterasu.

Ito returned to competitive figure skating in 2011. She competed at the ISU Adult Figure Skating Competition and placed second in her category, Ladies&#x27; Masters Elite II. Ito repeated her second-place finish the following year. In 2013, on her third year competing at the ISU Adult Figure Skating Championship, she took the title with a 12 points margin over the second place. In 2024, Ito won the ISU Adult Figure Skating Competition&#x27;s Masters Elite Women III + IV Artistic Free Skating category.

<doc id="657071" wikidata="Q1331203" url="?curid=657071" title="FLTK">
<text>Fast Light Toolkit (FLTK) is a cross-platform widget (graphical control element) library for graphical user interfaces (GUIs), developed by Bill Spitzak and others. Made to accommodate 3D graphics programming, it has an interface to OpenGL, but it is also suitable for general GUI programming.

Using its own widget, drawing and event systems abstracted from the underlying system-dependent code, it allows for writing programs which look the same on all supported operating systems.

FLTK is free and open-source software, licensed under GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) with an added clause permitting static linking from applications with incompatible licenses.

In contrast to user interface libraries like GTK, Qt, and wxWidgets, FLTK uses a more lightweight design and restricts itself to GUI functionality. Because of this, the library is very small (the FLTK &quot;Hello World&quot; program is around 100 KiB), and is usually statically linked. It also avoids complex macros, separate code preprocessors, and use of some advanced C++ features: templates, exceptions, and run-time type information (RTTI) or, for FLTK 1.x, namespaces. Combined with the modest size of the package, this makes it relatively easy to learn for new users.

These advantages come with corresponding disadvantages. FLTK offers fewer widgets than most GUI toolkits and, because of its use of non-native widgets, does not have native look-and-feel on any platform.

==Meaning of the name==
FLTK was originally designed to be compatible with the Forms Library written for Silicon Graphics (SGI) machines (a derivative of this library called &quot;XForms&quot; is still used quite often). In that library, all functions and structures start with codice_1. This naming was extended to all new methods and widgets in the C++ library, and this prefix codice_2 was taken as the name of the library. After FL was released as open source, it was discovered that searching &quot;FL&quot; on the Internet was a problem, because it is also the abbreviation for Florida. After much debating and searching for a new name for the toolkit, which was already in use by several people, Bill Spitzak came up with &quot;Fast Light Tool Kit&quot; (FLTK).

==Architecture==
FLTK is an object-oriented widget toolkit written in the programming language C++. While GTK is mainly optimized for the X Window System, FLTK works on other platforms, including Microsoft Windows (interfaced with the Windows API), and OS X (interfaced with Quartz). A Wayland back-end has been implemented and is available since release 1.4.0. FLTK2 has gained experimental support for optionally using the cairo graphics library.

===Language bindings===
A library written in one programming language may be used in another language if language bindings are written. FLTK has a range of bindings for various languages.

FLTK was mainly designed for, and is written in, the programming language C++. However, bindings exist for other languages, for example Lua, Perl, Python, Ruby, Rust and Tcl.

For FLTK 1.x, this example creates a window with an &quot;Okay&quot; button:

# include &lt;FL/Fl.H&gt;
# include &lt;FL/Fl_Window.H&gt;
# include &lt;FL/Fl_Button.H&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 Fl_Window* w = new Fl_Window(330, 190);
 new Fl_Button(110, 130, 100, 35, &quot;Okay&quot;);
 w-&gt;end();
 w-&gt;show(argc, argv);
 return Fl::run();


===GUI designers===
FLTK includes &quot;Fast Light User Interface Designer&quot; (FLUID), a graphical GUI designer that generates C++ source and header files.

==Use==
Many programs and projects use FLTK, including:
* Nanolinux, 14 MB Linux distribution
* XFDOS, a FreeDOS-based distribution with a GUI, porting Nano-X and FLTK
* Agenda VR3, a Linux-based personal digital assistant with software based on FLTK.
** third-party Agenda VR3 software
* , by Frictional Games uses FLTK in its launcher application
* MwendanoWD, Logic puzzle for personal computer by YPH.
* Audio:
** Fldigi, amateur radio software, allows data transmission and text chat via digital modes such as PSK31
** Giada, looper, micro-sequencer, sample player software, open-source
** Prodatum, synthesizer preset editor, uses a lifelike interface design
** ZynAddSubFX, an open-source software synthesizer
* DiSTI GL Studio, human-machine interface development tool
* Engineering:
** ForcePAD, an intuitive tool to visualise the behavior of structures subject to loading and boundary conditions
** Gmsh, an open-source finite element mesh generator
** RoboCIM, software to simulate and control operation of a servo robot system and external devices
* Equinox Desktop Environment (EDE)
* FlBurn optical disc burning software for Linux
* Graphics:
** CinePaint, deep-paint software, migrating from GTK to FLTK, open-source
** ITK-SNAP, software application for medical image segmentation, open-source
** Nuke, a digital compositing program. Until version 5, now replaced by Qt
** Open Movie Editor
** OpenVSP, an open-source NASA parametric 3D CAD for aircraft design and analysing
** PosteRazor, open-source poster printing software for Windows, OS X, Linux
** Tilemap Studio, An open-source tilemap editor for Game Boy, Color, Advance, DS, and SNES projects
* SmallBASIC, Windows port
* Web browsers:
** Dillo, Dillo-2 was based on FLTK-2, abandoning this FLTK branch, with no official release, was a major cause of Dillo-3 being started, using FLTK1.3
** Fifth, replicates functioning of early Opera
** NetRider
* Brain Visualizer: An open-source interactive visualizer for large-scale 3D brain models. Part of the Brain Organization Simulation System (BOSS) developed at Stony Brook University
* X window managers:
** FLWM
** miwm

==Versions==
This version history is an example of the sometimes tumultuous nature of open-source development.

===1.0.x===
This is a prior stable version, now unmaintained.

===1.1.x===
This is a prior stable version, now unmaintained.

===2.0 branch===
This was a development branch, long thought to be the next step in FLTK&#x27;s evolution, with many new features and a cleaner programming style. It never achieved stability, and development has largely ceased. The branch is inactive now.

===1.2.x===
This was an attempt to take some of the best features of 2.0 and merge them back into the more popular 1.1 branch. It is no longer developed.

===1.3.x===
Current stable release. Provides UTF-8 support.

===1.4.x===
Current development branch. Adds more features to 1.3.

===3.0 branch===
This branch is mostly a conceptual model for future work. Now inactive.

<text>Ricardo Dalmau Santana (born August 27, 1977 in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico) is the youngest of three children of the legendary basketball player Raymond Dalmau. He began his professional basketball career in 1995 with the Polluelos de Aibonito, under the coaching of his father. That year he earned the Puerto Rican League&#x27;s &quot;Rookie of the Year Award&quot;. The next year, he joined his eldest brother Richie in the Piratas de Quebradillas, the basketball team where his father spent his entire career.

Alongside his brother Richie Dalmau, he led Quebradillas to two Puerto Rican League Finals in 1999 and 2000, losing both of them to the Cangrejeros de Santurce. He participated with the Puerto Rican National Team in 1998 and 2002.

By the end of 2003, Quebradillas had many financial problems and they lost the rights to all their players. Ricardo and his brother Richie moved to the Indios de Mayagüez for the 2004 season. However, both of them reunited with their father Raymond when they signed contracts with the Cangrejeros de Santurce for the 2005 season. Raymond was the head coach of the team. In the Cangrejeros of Santurce they contributed to the 2007 Puerto Rican national championship.

Ricardo is also a Certified Public Accountant(CPA) and has been awarded by the Puerto Rico State CPA Association for his contribution to the accounting practice.

Dalmau has also contributed to improving Puerto Rico&#x27;s public education system. In 2008, he and his brother Richie Dalmau participated in Sapientis Week, an initiative sponsored by the non-profit Sapientis which brings distinguished public figures into classrooms in order to raise the public&#x27;s awareness of the education crisis in Puerto Rico. Since 2009 he served as Director of Audit Office Sports and Recreation Department. In 2011 the governor of Puerto Rico, Luis G. Fortuño, announced the appointment of Ricardo Dalmau Santana to the post of Inspector General of Puerto Rico which was approved by the House and Senate.

<text>Connor Wyatt Trinneer (born March 19, 1969) is an American film, stage, and television actor. He is best known for his roles as Charles &quot;Trip&quot; Tucker III on &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, Michael on the series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, and Professor Moynihan on the web series &quot;Guilty Party&quot;.

==Early life==
Trinneer was born on March 19, 1969, in Walla Walla, Washington, but spent many years in Kelso, Washington, where he attended elementary and middle schools, and then Kelso High School. He attended Pacific Lutheran University in Parkland where he played college football. He graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in acting, then obtained a Master of Fine Arts degree from University of Missouri-Kansas City.

==Career==

Trinneer first came to attention in &quot;Arcadia&quot; at the Huntington Theater Company in Boston. Much of his work has been in theater, specifically a long association with the Circle X Theatre Company in Hollywood.

He has had several guest-starring roles on television, including &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, &quot;Sliders&quot;, and &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;. He also had a significant role in the TV adaptation of A.R. Gurney&#x27;s &quot;Far East&quot;, playing the conflicted gay officer Bob Munger.

In 2001, Trinneer auditioned for &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. At the time, he did not follow science fiction and was unaware of the franchise&#x27;s significance. He said that he gained the role of Tucker through sheer luck, as he anticipated that more than a hundred actors would audition for the part. During the audition, he had only seven script pages on which to base his performance, and was told only that the character originated from the southern United States.

Trinneer starred as Tucker in all 98 episodes of &quot;Enterprise&quot; across its four seasons and was nominated twice for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2002 and 2003 for his performance.

After the cancellation of &quot;Enterprise&quot; in 2005, Trinneer returned to guest-star roles on series such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;24&quot; and a recurring role as the Wraith Michael in &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;.

Trinneer attended the GO3 Electronic and Entertainment Expo in Perth, Western Australia, and appeared with fellow &quot;Stargate Atlantis &quot;co-star David Nykl on the 2009 &quot;Channel Seven Perth Telethon&quot;.

From 2022-2024, he was the co-host of the podcast &quot;The Shuttlepod Show&quot; with his &quot;Enterprise&quot; co-star Dominic Keating. In April 2024, after leaving &quot;The Shuttlepod Show&quot;, Keating and Trinneer announced their new podcast &quot;The D-Con Chamber.&quot;

In 2023 Trinneer reprised the role of Trip Tucker in &quot;Holograms, All the Way Down&quot; an episode of the animated web series &quot;Star Trek: Very Short Treks&quot; made to celebrate the franchise’s 50th anniversary.

==Personal life==
Trinneer married Ariana Navarre on May 29, 2004; they have a son, born on October 11, 2005. In 2022, during the broadcast of the webcast &quot;The Shuttlepod Show&quot;, Trinneer revealed he had divorced his wife in the same year. On November 9, 2024 Trinneer married realtor Jackie Robbins Smith.

<doc id="657080" wikidata="Q1878585" url="?curid=657080" title="Lycoming Engines">
<text>Lycoming Engines is a major American manufacturer of aircraft engines. With a factory in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, Lycoming produces a line of horizontally opposed, air-cooled, four, six and eight-cylinder engines including the only FAA-certified aerobatic and helicopter piston engines on the market.

The company has built more than 325,000 piston aircraft engines and powers more than half the world&#x27;s general aviation fleet, both rotary and fixed wing.

Lycoming has been a principal pioneer of turbine engines for medium and large helicopters, and has also produced engines for small jetliners and business jets.

Lycoming is an operating division of Avco Corporation, itself a subsidiary of Textron.

==History==

===Sewing machines, bicycles and fashion===
Lycoming dates its founding to 1845 by &quot;Madame Ellen Curtis Demorest&quot;. However, the early history of the company (especially prior to 1860) is unclear; biographer Ishbel Ross notes that the marriage of Ellen Louise Curtis to William Jennings Demorest took place in 1858, somewhat later than the purported date of establishment of the company. A few years later in New York, between c. 1860 and 1887, the Demorests published fashion magazines and operated the Demorest Fashion and Sewing-Machine Company (sometimes known as the Demorest Manufacturing Company). They produced &quot;Madame Demorest&quot; and &quot;Bartlett &amp; Demorest&quot; sewing machines and sold Ellen Demorest&#x27;s innovative paper patterns for dressmaking. During this period, Ellen Demorest patented several fashion accessories, while her husband patented improvements to sewing machines and an apparatus for the vulcanization of rubber.
Around 1883, Gerrit S. Scofield &amp; Frank M. Scofield (advertising agents from New York) bought the Demorest brand and the sewing machine business (the Demorests retained the magazine business), and constructed a factory in Williamsport, Pennsylvania (in Lycoming County). At the urging of the newly established Williamsport Board of Trade, citizens invested in the new manufacturing facility, which employed 250 people. The factory produced 50 to 60 sewing machines per day.
With the development of the &quot;New York Bicycle&quot; in 1891 (designed by employee S. H. Ellis), the company diversified its product offerings. Until the early 1900s, the factory produced sewing machines, bicycles, typewriters, opera chairs and other products.

===Engine manufacture===
By 1907, the manufacture of sewing machines had become unprofitable for Demorest, and the company was sold and restructured as the Lycoming Foundry and Machine Company, shifting its focus toward automobile engine manufacture. In 1910, the company supplied its first automobile engine to Velie, and during the early post-World-War-I era, the company was a major supplier to Auburn (which produced the Auburn, Cord, and Duesenberg lines).

By 1920, Lycoming was producing 60,000 engines a year, with a 2,000-strong workforce. To handle the capacity, a new foundry complex was built in Williamsport that year. Eventually Lycoming became Auburn&#x27;s principal supplier, and in 1927 Errett Lobban Cord bought the company, placing it under his Auburn Manufacturing umbrella group.

Among the engines Lycoming produced for Cord was an L-head straight-eight engine of 298.5 cu. in. displacement that produced 125 horsepower. This was used in the Cord L-29. Lycoming also produced a double overhead cam straight 8 used in the legendary Duesenberg J series. This powerplant produced 265 horsepower, six times the power of a contemporary Model A Ford. A supercharged version, generating 325 horsepower, was installed in the Duesenberg SJ and SSJ models.

In 1929, Lycoming produced its first aviation engine, the nine-cylinder R-680 radial. This was a fairly successful design, and was used widely in light aircraft, including Cord&#x27;s Travel Air.

In the 1930s, Lycoming made a number of attempts to develop successful high-power aircraft engines. The O-1230 was Lycoming&#x27;s attempt to produce an engine based on the United States Army Air Corps hyper engine concept, and used a variety of features to produce nearly of engine displacement. However, by the O-1230&#x27;s entry into service, it had been surpassed by other designs and the investment was not recouped.

Another attempt was made to rescue the design by stacking two O-1230s to make the H engine H-2470 but the only design to use it, the Vultee XP-54, never entered production. The Curtiss XF14C was originally intended to be powered by the H-2470, but the engine&#x27;s poor performance led to the adoption of an alternative radial engine on the prototype. (The XF14C did not enter production.)

Undeterred by the O-1230/H-2470&#x27;s failure, Lycoming turned to an even larger design, the 36-cylinder XR-7755, the largest aviation piston engine ever built. This design also experienced problems, and was only ready for use at the very end of World War II, when the aviation world was turning to turbojets and turboprop engines to power future large aircraft. There was apparently some interest in using it on the Convair B-36 Peacemaker bomber, but the 28-cylinder Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 &quot;Wasp Major&quot; four-bank radial was used instead.

Through the 1920s and -30s, Lycoming had still been supplying automotive manufacturers with engines. However, these clients each slowly went out of business or switched to Continental engines for their vehicles. By 1931, the company was supplying automotive engines to only three companies: Auburn, Cord and Duesenburg, still all under the control of Cord. These companies closed their doors in 1937, after which Lycoming switched to exclusively designing and producing engines for aviation. In the meantime, the Smith Engineering Corporation, an early manufacturer of controllable pitch propellers had been purchased by Cord and moved to Williamsport.

In 1939 Cord re-organized all of his aviation holdings into the AVCO group, at which point the engine manufacturing company became &quot;AVCO Lycoming&quot;. It also leased the government-owned Stratford Army Engine Plant in Stratford, Connecticut, and produced Wright radials under license. After the war, this plant was converted to produce the T53 turboshaft engine, one of its more successful designs. From this point on the piston and turbine engine lines remained separate, with the piston lines being built in the original Williamsport factories, and turbines in Stratford.

By 1961, Lycoming produced 600 to 700 engines per month. Its most successful post-war products were a series of air-cooled flat-4 and flat-6 general aviation engines. Most famous among these are the O-320 and O-360 four-cylinder engines, and the O-540 six-cylinder engine. Many light aircraft are powered by versions of these engines, with power ratings in the range. Engines in this series also include the O-235 four-, O-580 six- and O-720 eight-cylinder engines, and the advanced turbocharged and fuel-injected TIGO-541 variant of the venerable (carbureted) O-540.

In the early 1980s, the general aviation market suddenly diminished and Lycoming&#x27;s piston engine business was significantly impacted. Attempts were made to move some of the turbine production to Williamsport, but this led to a series of quality control problems and eventually it was abandoned.

Another attempt to rescue Williamsport was made in introducing the &quot;radical&quot; &quot;SCORE&quot; engine, a Wankel engine originally developed through a joint venture between Curtiss-Wright and John Deere. Curtiss-Wright lost interest in the design just as it was maturing and sold its interests in the project to Deere, which brought in Lycoming to sell the developed engine into the aviation markets. It was guaranteed a startup run by Cessna, also owned by Textron. Just as production was ready to start, Cessna announced it was halting its small-aircraft business for an indefinite period, and SCORE was cancelled. The remains of the Deere licenses were later purchased by Rotary Power International, which briefly produced a version.

Textron purchased the company in 1985. In 1994, Textron sold the Lycoming Turbine Engine Division, located in Stratford, Connecticut, to AlliedSignal, who merged it with the Garrett Engine Division of AlliedSignal as part of AlliedSignal Aerospace, later becoming part of Honeywell Aerospace in 1999. Textron retained piston engine production in Williamsport.

Lycomings continue to power new light aircraft by fellow Textron division, Cessna Aircraft, and by Piper, Cirrus, Diamond, and others.
Lycomings remain the most popular line of engines for U.S. Experimental / Amateur-Built (E/A-B) aircraft, surpassing the 5 next-most-popular brands, combined.

===Piston engines===


===Turbine engines===
Lycoming was one of the principal pioneers of turbine engines -- turboshaft to be precise—for medium- and heavy-lift helicopters, some of which have found other applications as well. Its T53 hybrid free turbine / shaft turbine engine initially powered the Bell UH-1 &quot;Huey&quot;, and Lycoming&#x27;s T55 is the main power for the twin-turbine, twin-rotor Boeing CH-47 Chinook. Lycoming turbines have powered other helicopters, also.

Variants and derivatives have powered various turboprop and turbofan aircraft, as well, including the OV-1 Mohawk military aircraft, BAe 146 jetliner, Canadair Challenger business jet, and others.

<doc id="657081" wikidata="Q2601773" url="?curid=657081" title="Quintuplets">
<text>Quintuplets is an American sitcom that aired 22 episodes on Fox from June 16, 2004 to January 12, 2005. The program starred Andy Richter and Rebecca Creskoff and shared some of their experiences parenting teenage quintuplets.

==Synopsis==
The series is set in Nutley, New Jersey, and looks like a typical family sitcom. Much of the storyline focuses on the difficulty of supporting a large family of teens, both financially and emotionally, as they grapple with the reality that they&#x27;re no longer as cute as when they were babies.

The house is a typical three-bedroom family home. The three male siblings share a room with bunk beds, the two females share another room. The kitchen contains a double-wide beer cooler as a refrigerator, and the basement contains a walk-in freezer, both to store the large amounts of food such a large family requires. The situation may be seen to parallel and parody the old sitcom &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, by highlighting the impracticality of the large family.

The theme song, &quot;Suck or Shine,&quot; was performed by Chris and Tad.

==Cast and characters==
* Bob Chase (Andy Richter) – The father sells office cubicles and barely makes enough money to support his large family. Most of his time is spent trying to save money, and he only occasionally provides parenting for his five teens, but he&#x27;d prefer to get away whenever he has the chance. He also opines that he thinks half his children are freaks, blaming this and the fact that there were so many at once, on the fact that they were artificially inseminated. 
* Carol Chase (Rebecca Creskoff) – The mother maintains the large family and house in &quot;typical sitcom homemaker&quot; mode. In one episode she attempts to go back to work, but nobody wants her because she&#x27;s been raising kids for 15 years. She goes back to being a homemaker and remains one for the rest of the show. She enforces the house rules.
* Parker Chase (Jake McDorman) – The popular boy. Tallest of the children, good-looking, successful in academics and sports. He teases his brothers mercilessly, especially Pearce, but is also quick to defend them. The male quints share a deep bond, probably from sharing the womb. At one point the youngest and shortest, Patton, says that Parker took all the good genes and left him with the short ones and Pearce with the weird ones.
* Pearce Chase (Johnny K. Lewis) – The curly-haired weirdest quint. He boldly shares with anyone his strange perspective on just about any subject, and is so odd that he no longer responds to rejection. 
* Penny Chase (April Matson) – The intellectual, who is vigorously nonconformist. Her taste in clothing and hairstyle frequently gets her mistaken for the typical goth. She enjoys reading and sometimes feels inadequate to Paige.
* Paige Chase (Sarah Wright) – The beautiful girl. She spends most of her time thinking of and attending to her appearance. She&#x27;s not the brightest of the family, but she&#x27;s bubbly and kind. 
* Patton Chase (Ryan Pinkston) – The youngest of the children, and the shortest at 4&#x27;10&quot;. This is a source of amusement to the family and shame to the father, and the mother is often overly-nurturing. He takes growth hormones. He is girl-crazy and his typical line to girls (and, in one episode, a guy when he was pretending to be gay to avoid being pulverized) is, &quot;Yes I am, you likey?.&quot; It usually works, but his sisters often find it disgusting.

<doc id="657082" wikidata="Q740332" url="?curid=657082" title="Liang Kai">
<text>Liang Kai (; &quot;c&quot;. 1140 - &quot;c&quot;. 1210) was a Chinese painter of the Southern Song Dynasty. He was also known as Madman Liang because of his very informal pictures. He was born in Shandong and worked in Lin An (later Hangzhou). He is known to have studied with the master Jia Shigu. He was awarded the rank of Painter-in-Attendance at the court of Jia Tai (1201-1204 CE, Southern Song Dynasty) where he was known for mastery in painting figures, landscapes, and other minor subjects. He was also awarded the Golden Belt, however he left it behind when he left his position at court to practise Chan Buddhism. 

== Painting style ==
Liang Kai is most famous for originating or developing the &quot;Xie Yi&quot; (sometimes translated as &quot;sketch style&quot;) of painting, where the objective is to evoke the subject or atmosphere with minimal use of detail; it requires a profound mastery of painting technique and perfect concentration, but also allows for the beauty of accidental effects. The Xie Yi style is closely associated with the &quot;sudden enlightenment&quot;, &quot;mindfulness&quot;, and &quot;spontaneity&quot; aspects of this school of Buddhism. Works generally attributed to Liáng Kǎi include: painting of the poet Li Bai, the &quot;Drunken Celestial&quot; (&quot;A Sage&quot;), &quot;The Sixth Patriarch Cutting Bamboo&quot;, and in a more academic style, a series called the &quot;Eight Eminent Monks&quot; paintings.

&quot;The Sixth Chan Patriarch&quot; in particular exemplifies Chan Buddhism. It depicts Huineng, a Chan master, crouching as he chops bamboo. This follows the idea of mundane tasks taking on spiritual value in accordance with the philosophy. The painted scene shows the patriarch&#x27;s &quot;Chan moment&quot; in which he finally attains enlightenment through the resonating sound of the blade. The holy figure is drawn scruffy and almost caricature-like. This was meant to suggest that he is free from worldly concerns like appearance and social status/expectation. In this deceptively simple painting, Liang uses pale and wet brushstrokes. However, several dark lines are scattered throughout, as seen in the vine growing around the tree on the left side of the image, and accents on Huineng&#x27;s clothing. Liang&#x27;s style of abbreviated, expressive painting, along with his ability to casually create compelling images is what made him famous among Chan monks.

<text>An alchemist is a person versed in the art of alchemy. Western alchemy flourished in Greco-Roman Egypt, the Islamic world during the Middle Ages, and then in Europe from the 13th to the 18th centuries. Indian alchemists and Chinese alchemists made contributions to Eastern varieties of the art. Alchemy is still practiced today by a few, and alchemist characters still appear in recent fictional works and video games.

Many alchemists are known from the thousands of surviving alchemical manuscripts and books. Some of their names are listed below. Due to the tradition of pseudepigraphy, the true author of some alchemical writings may differ from the name most often associated with that work. Some well-known historical figures such as Albertus Magnus and Aristotle are often incorrectly named amongst the alchemists as a result.

<doc id="657085" wikidata="Q5407792" url="?curid=657085" title="Sad Sappy Sucker">
<text>Sad Sappy Sucker (or by the full title on its cover art Sad Sappy Sucker Chokin on a Mouthful of Lost Thoughts) is a 2001 compilation album released by alternative rock band Modest Mouse. Originally slated to be Modest Mouse&#x27;s debut album in 1994, &quot;Sad Sappy Sucker&quot; was shelved for several years until its eventual release in 2001, following the popularity of the band&#x27;s third album &quot;The Moon &amp; Antarctica&quot;. Several songs were recorded at Olympia, Washington&#x27;s Dub Narcotic Studios by Beat Happening frontman Calvin Johnson. The record was officially released by Johnson&#x27;s label K Records on April 24, 2001, available in both Compact Disc and vinyl LP, and containing nine additional tracks added to the original track listing of 15 songs.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Sad Sappy Sucker&quot; was met with &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews from critics. Metacritic, gave this release a score of 55 out of 100, based on 8 reviews. 

In a review for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Spencer Owen gave the album a 7 out of 10 on release, but after a reissue gave it a 7.2. PopMatters said that &quot;taken on its own merits, Sad Sappy Sucker is pretty good, but the out-and-out strangeness of it all and the fact that it doesn’t hold together as a real album may throw off the uninitiated (and who can blame them?).&quot; Stereogum declared it the worst Modest Mouse album, stating &quot;the album is as grating and undercooked as indie rock debuts come, full of indulgent studio experiments, half-assed sketches, and tunes that sound like a generic sadcore band&#x27;s demo cassette in high-speed dub mode...&quot;Sad Sappy Sucker&quot; asks the question: &#x27;How many Built To Spills do we need?&#x27;&quot;

==Track listing==
The first 15 tracks make up the original album &quot;Sad Sappy Sucker&quot;. Tracks 16–24 come from Isaac Brock&#x27;s answering machine — he originally had a &quot;Call to Dial a Song&quot; service, similar to They Might Be Giants&#x27; Dial-A-Song.

<doc id="657094" wikidata="Q192222" url="?curid=657094" title="Lysippos">
<text>Lysippos (; ) was a Greek sculptor of the 4th century BC. Together with Scopas and Praxiteles, he is considered one of the three greatest sculptors of the Classical Greek era, bringing transition into the Hellenistic period. Problems confront the study of Lysippos because of the difficulty in identifying his style in the copies which survive. Not only did he have a large workshop and many disciples in his immediate circle, but there is understood to have been a market for replicas of his work, supplied from outside his circle, both in his lifetime and later in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. The &quot;Victorious Youth&quot; or Getty bronze, which resurfaced around 1972, has been associated with him.

==Biography==

Born at Sicyon around 390 BC, Lysippos was a worker in bronze in his youth. He taught himself the art of sculpture, later becoming head of the school of Argos and Sicyon. According to Pliny, he produced more than 1,500 works, all of them in bronze. Commentators noted his grace and elegance, and the &quot;symmetria,&quot; or coherent balance, of his figures, which were leaner than the ideal represented by Polykleitos and with proportionately smaller heads, giving them the impression of greater height. He was famous for his attention to the details of eyelids and toenails.

His pupil, Chares of Lindos, constructed the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. As this statue does not exist today, debate continues as to whether its sections were cast in bronze or hammered of sheet bronze.
== Career and legacy ==
Lysippos was successor in contemporary repute to the famous sculptor Polykleitos. Among the works attributed to him are the so-called Horses of Saint Mark, &quot;Eros Stringing the Bow&quot; (of which various copies exist, the best in the British Museum), &quot;Agias&quot; (known through the marble copy found and preserved in Delphi), the similar &quot;Oil Pourer&quot; (Dresden and Munich), the &quot;Farnese Hercules&quot; (which was originally placed in the Baths of Caracalla, although the surviving marble copy lies in the Naples National Archaeological Museum) and &quot;Apoxyomenos&quot; (or &quot;The Scraper&quot;, known from a Roman marble copy in the Vatican Museums). Lysippos was also famous for his bronze colossal sculptures of Zeus, 17 metres tall, and Herakles, seven meters seated, both from the city of Taras. The only remaining version of one such statue is a Roman copy of &quot;The Weary Herakles (Farnese Hercules)&quot;, by Glykon, with heavy musculature typical of early third century Rome.

===Canon of Lysippos===

Lysippos developed a more style than his predecessor Polykleitos and this has become known as the Canon of Lysippos. In his , Pliny the elder wrote that Lysippos introduced a new canon into art: signifying &quot;a canon of bodily proportions essentially different from that of Polykleitos&quot;. Lysippos is credited with having established the &#x27;eight heads high&#x27; canon of body proportions.

== Lysippos and Alexander ==

During his lifetime, Lysippos was personal sculptor to Alexander the Great; indeed, he was the only artist whom the conqueror saw fit to represent him. An epigram by Posidippus, previously only known from the Anthology of Planudes (APl 119), but also found on the recently discovered Milan Papyrus (65 Austin-Bastianini), takes as its inspiration a bronze portrait of Alexander:

And similarly, an epigram by Asclepiades (APl 120):

Lysippos has been credited with the stock representation of an inspired, godlike Alexander with tousled hair and lips parted, looking upward in what came to be known as the &#x27;Lysippean gaze&#x27;. One fine example, an early Imperial Roman copy found at Tivoli, is conserved at the Louvre.

== The Victorious Youth ==

In 1972, the &quot;Victorious Youth&quot;, Getty Bronze, or &quot;Atleta di Fano&quot; to Italians, was discovered and at the urging of Paul Getty, bought by the Getty Museum. The bronze was pulled out of the sea and restored. Because of the amount of corrosion and the thick layer of incrustation that coated the statue when it was found, it can be assumed that it was beneath the water for centuries. This is less than surprising, as most of the classical bronze statues archeologists have found have been fished out of the Mediterranean Sea. It was not uncommon for a shipwreck to occur with something as precious as a sculpture on board. Without any way to find or retrieve them, these pieces were left to sit at the bottom of the ocean for centuries. The damaging corrosion can be removed by cleaning the surfaces mechanically with a scalpel.

The Getty Bronze is believed by some to be Lysippos&#x27;s work, or at least a copy, because the detail on it is consistent with his style of work and his canon of proportions. Lysippos&#x27;s work is described by ancient sources as naturalistic with slender and often lengthened proportions, often with exaggerated facial features. Those depicted in the works of Lysippos had smaller heads than those of his mentor Polykleitos because he used a one to eight scale for the head and the total height of the body.

<doc id="657099" wikidata="Q3905590" url="?curid=657099" title="Piratas de Quebradillas">
<text>The Piratas de Quebradillas is a Puerto Rican basketball team, part of the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN), the top flight of Puerto Rico basketball. Founded in the mid 1920s, it is one of the original teams of the league. The club enjoyed its most successful era during the 1970s, when they won four championships, including a three-peat, and participated in six league finals. However, after the 2004 season, the team suffered from financial problems, which prevented them from participating in the following five seasons. The club returned to active competition in 2009 with new players and a new arena, as well as a trip to the league finals. After a 34 years hiatus, in 2013 they won the BSN championship, defeating the Leones de Ponce in a six game series.

==Early history==
The Piratas de Quebradillas basketball club was founded in 1926 and was one of the original founding teams of the Puerto Rican Basketball League. Among its early star players where Quiro Santiago, Manuel &quot;Lolo&quot; González, Teíque Linares, Rafael &quot;Nenito&quot; Deliz and Manuel de Regla &quot;Varilla&quot; Lugo. The team participated in the 1937 season finals, but the next three decades where characterized by poor performances during the tournaments. This changed by the end of the 1960s when a new batch of Puerto Rican players born in New York City were signed by the team.

===The Dalmau era (1966–1985)===
In 1966 Quebradillas signed Raymond Dalmau, who became rookie of the year in the league. In 1969 the team signed Neftali Rivera, who also became the rookie of the year. Both would go on to become legends in Puerto Rican Basketball, known as the &quot;Dynamic Duo&quot;. Together, these two players led the team to its first team championship during the 1970 season. This incarnation of the team was coached by Eric Geldhart.

The Quebradillas Pirates were a dominant team in the BSN throughout the 1970s, reaching the league finals eight times. After their championship in 1970, they were defeated by the Vaqueros de Bayamon in 1972, 1973, and 1975, then lost to Rio Piedras Cardinals in 1976. Quebradillas won three consecutive titles in 1977–79, for a total of 4 wins in 8 finals in 10 yearse. The Quebradillas lost the championship finals in 1980, 1982, 1999, 2000, 2009 and 2011, before winning their next championship in 2013.

Rivera was traded to the Leones de Ponce following the 1981 season. However, Raymond Dalmau went on to finish his career in Quebradillas in 1985, and subsequently became a professional basketball coach.

===Decline===
Following the retirement of Dalmau, Quebradillas struggled to keep their presence as a dominant team in the league. With players like Orlando Vega and Jimmy Ferrer, the team managed to make several postseason runs, but they never made it to the league finals. Raymond Dalmau himself coached the team on several occasions.

During the 1988 season, Quebradillas was coached by future NBA legendary coach Phil Jackson who, at that time, had not yet found a contract with any NBA teams. After a poor season start, Quebradillas fired coach Jackson, who later went on to win 11 NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers.

===The second Dalmau era and financial crisis===
It would be the two sons of Raymond Dalmau which would return the Piratas to their former glory. Richie and Ricardo Dalmau led the team to two consecutive BSN finals in 1999 and 2000. However, the team lost both finals to the Cangrejeros de Santurce which were led by NBA players José Ortíz and Carlos Arroyo.

After these finals appearances, Quebradillas continued to be a competitive team, reaching the league semi-finals in several occasions. However, the team confronted financial problems at the end of the 2003 season which led the league to declare every Quebradillas player a free agent. The financial problems where mostly attributed to the fact that the team played in a small 1,500 seat arena which hindered their capabilities to obtain significant financial endorsements.

The team played during the 2004 seasons with mostly amateur players and finished the season with a league-worst 5-25 record.

===Return to success===
The municipality of Quebradillas committed to the construction of a new arena (to replace their former home the Pedro Hernández Coliseum) which was finalized in 2008. This new arena was named after Raymond Dalmau and it allowed the team to return to active league competition. Owner Carlos Rodríguez bought the rights to the Criollos de Caguas players and brought them to Quebradillas. Among them was current Puerto Rican National Team center Peter John Ramos. Former Connecticut Huskies star point guard Marcus Williams joined the team as well as Australian forward Shawn Redhage. Also, former Florida Gator David Huertas declined participating in his last NCAA season to join the team.

The team went on to finish with a 22-8 record, second best on the league. They advanced to the league finals for the first time since 2000 against their legendary rivals, the Vaqueros de Bayamon. Quebradillas would lose the series in 6 games. The team continued in a successive streak, reaching the finals again during the 2011 season, but lost in five games to the Capitanes de Arecibo.

===2012–2013===

In 2012, Quebradillas was bought by new owner Felix Rivera. The new ownership made a series of changes in personnel, and for the 2013 season acquired the rights to NBL stars Shawn Redhage and Kevin Lisch. On July 29, 2013, Quebradillas won (89-72) the final game of the 2013 final series in a six-game duel against Leones de Ponce. The win gave Quebradillas&#x27; its 5th championship in the team&#x27;s history.

===2014===

In 2014, Felix Rivera moved the Quebradillas franchise to Manatí with the name Atenienses. Past owner Carlos Rodríguez established another team for the city and the Piratas de Quebradillas came back with a new roster. The agreement with the league was only for one year team. The 2014 Quebradillas did not qualify for the league playoffs.

===2015–present===

David E. Rivera, bought the Mets of Guaynabo basketball team and transferred it to Quebradillas with the name Piratas.

In 2016, the franchise was purchased by businessman Roberto Roca.

<text>Ma Zhiyuan (, 1250–1321), courtesy name Dongli (), Chinese dramatist, playwright, and poet during the Yuan dynasty.

Among his achievements is the development and popularizing of the &quot;sanqu&quot; () lyric type of Classical Chinese poetry forms. The poem &quot;Autumn Thoughts&quot; () is the most widely known of his sanqu poems. 

His sanqu poems were collected in the book &quot;Dongli Yuefu&quot; (), where there were 104 single &quot;sanqu&quot; (Xiaoling 小令) and 17 song suites (Taoshu 套數). 

==Works==
===Poems===
Ma Zhiyuan&#x27;s &quot;sanqu&quot; poem &quot;Autumn Thoughts&quot; (), composed to the metric pattern Tianjingsha (), uses ten images in twenty-two monosyllables to preamble a state of emotion, and is considered as the penultimate piece in Chinese poetry to convey the typical Chinese male literati&#x27;s melancholy during late autumn:

: &quot;Autumn Thoughts&quot;
: Over old trees wreathed with rotten vines fly evening crows;
: Under a small bridge near a cottage a stream flows;
: On ancient road in the west wind a lean horse goes.
: Westward declines the sun; Far, far from home is the heartbroken one.

===Plays===
Only seven of his 15 plays are extant, of which four have been translated into English: 
* &quot;Autumn in Han Palace&quot;, (Full title: &quot;Breaking a Troubling Dream: A Lone Goose in Autumn over the Palaces of Han&quot;, ). This play tells the story of Han Emperor Yuandi and Wang Zhaojun, and is considered the best example of Yuan theatre.
* &quot;The Yellow-Millet Dream&quot;, (Full title: &quot;On the Road to Handan, Awakening from a Dream Dreamt While Cooking Millet&quot;, )
* &quot;Yueyang Tower&quot;, (Full title: &quot;Lü Dongbin Gets Drunk Three Times in Yueyang Tower&quot;, )
* &quot;Tears on the Blue Gown&quot;, (Full title: &quot;The Overseer of Jiangzhou: Tears on the Blue Gown&quot;, )

<doc id="657106" wikidata="Q1434060" url="?curid=657106" title="Bounding volume">
<text>In computer graphics and computational geometry, a bounding volume (or bounding region) for a set of objects is a closed region that completely contains the union of the objects in the set. Bounding volumes are used to improve the efficiency of geometrical operations, such as by using simple regions, having simpler ways to test for overlap.

A bounding volume for a set of objects is also a bounding volume for the single object consisting of their union, and the other way around. Therefore, it is possible to confine the description to the case of a single object, which is assumed to be non-empty and bounded (finite).

==Uses==
Bounding volumes are most often used to accelerate certain kinds of tests.

In ray tracing, bounding volumes are used in ray-intersection tests, and in many rendering algorithms, they are used for viewing frustum tests. If the ray or viewing frustum does not intersect the bounding volume, it cannot intersect the object contained within, allowing trivial rejection. Similarly if the frustum contains the entirety of the bounding volume, the contents may be trivially accepted without further tests. These intersection tests produce a list of objects that must be &#x27;displayed&#x27; (rendered; rasterized).

In collision detection, when two bounding volumes do not intersect, the contained objects cannot collide.

Testing against a bounding volume is typically much faster than testing against the object itself, because of the bounding volume&#x27;s simpler geometry. This is because an &#x27;object&#x27; is typically composed of polygons or data structures that are reduced to polygonal approximations. In either case, it is computationally wasteful to test each polygon against the view volume if the object is not visible. (Onscreen objects must be &#x27;clipped&#x27; to the screen, regardless of whether their surfaces are actually visible.)

To obtain bounding volumes of complex objects, a common way is to break the objects/scene down using a scene graph or more specifically a bounding volume hierarchy, like e.g. OBB trees. The basic idea behind this is to organize a scene in a tree-like structure where the root comprises the whole scene and each leaf contains a smaller subpart.

In computer stereo vision, a bounding volume reconstructed from silhouettes of an object is known as a &quot;visual hull.&quot;

==Common types==

The choice of the type of bounding volume for a given application is determined by a variety of factors: the computational cost of computing a bounding volume for an object, the cost of updating it in applications in which the objects can move or change shape or size, the cost of determining intersections, and the desired precision of the intersection test. The precision of the intersection test is related to the amount of space within the bounding volume not associated with the bounded object, called &quot;void space&quot;. Sophisticated bounding volumes generally allow for less void space but are more computationally expensive. It is common to use several types in conjunction, such as a cheap one for a quick but rough test in conjunction with a more precise but also more expensive type.

The types treated here all give convex bounding volumes. If the object being bounded is known to be convex, this is not a restriction. If non-convex bounding volumes are required, an approach is to represent them as a union of a number of convex bounding volumes. Unfortunately, intersection tests become quickly more expensive as the bounding boxes become more sophisticated.

A &quot;bounding box&quot; or &quot;minimum bounding box&quot; (&quot;MBB&quot;) is a cuboid, or in 2-D a rectangle, containing the object. In dynamical simulation, bounding boxes are preferred to other shapes of bounding volume such as bounding spheres or cylinders for objects that are roughly cuboid in shape when the intersection test needs to be fairly accurate. The benefit is obvious, for example, for objects that rest upon other, such as a car resting on the ground: a bounding sphere would show the car as possibly intersecting with the ground, which then would need to be rejected by a more expensive test of the actual model of the car; a bounding box immediately shows the car as not intersecting with the ground, saving the more expensive test.

A &quot;minimum bounding rectangle&quot; (&quot;MBR&quot;) – the least AABB in 2-D – is frequently used in the description of geographic (or &quot;geospatial&quot;) data items, serving as a simplified proxy for a dataset&#x27;s spatial extent (see geospatial metadata) for the purpose of data search (including spatial queries as applicable) and display. It is also a basic component of the R-tree method of spatial indexing.

In many applications the bounding box is aligned with the axes of the co-ordinate system, and it is then known as an axis-aligned bounding box (&#x27;). To distinguish the general case from an AABB, an arbitrary bounding box is sometimes called an oriented bounding box (&#x27;), or an when an existing object&#x27;s local coordinate system is used. AABBs are much simpler to test for intersection than OBBs, but have the disadvantage that when the model is rotated they cannot be simply rotated with it, but need to be recomputed.

A is a swept sphere (i.e. the volume that a sphere takes as it moves along a straight line segment) containing the object. Capsules can be represented by the radius of the swept sphere and the segment that the sphere is swept across). It has traits similar to a cylinder, but is easier to use, because the intersection test is simpler. A capsule and another object intersect if the distance between the capsule&#x27;s defining segment and some feature of the other object is smaller than the capsule&#x27;s radius. For example, two capsules intersect if the distance between the capsules&#x27; segments is smaller than the sum of their radii. This holds for arbitrarily rotated capsules, which is why they&#x27;re more appealing than cylinders in practice.

A is a cylinder containing the object. In most applications the axis of the cylinder is aligned with the vertical direction of the scene. Cylinders are appropriate for 3-D objects that can only rotate about a vertical axis but not about other axes, and are otherwise constrained to move by translation only. Two vertical-axis-aligned cylinders intersect when, simultaneously, their projections on the vertical axis intersect – which are two line segments – as well their projections on the horizontal plane – two circular disks. Both are easy to test. In video games, bounding cylinders are often used as bounding volumes for people standing upright.

A is an ellipsoid containing the object. Ellipsoids usually provide tighter fitting than a sphere. Intersections with ellipsoids are done by scaling the other object along the principal axes of the ellipsoid by an amount equal to the multiplicative inverse of the radii of the ellipsoid, thus reducing the problem to intersecting the scaled object with a unit sphere. Care should be taken to avoid problems if the applied scaling introduces . Skew can make the usage of ellipsoids impractical in certain cases, for example collision between two arbitrary ellipsoids.

A &quot;bounding sphere&quot; is a sphere containing the object. In 2-D graphics, this is a circle. Bounding spheres are represented by centre and radius. They are very quick to test for collision with each other: two spheres intersect when the distance between their centres does not exceed the sum of their radii. This makes bounding spheres appropriate for objects that can move in any number of dimensions.

A is the volume that projects to an extent on an axis, and can be thought of as the slab bounded between two planes. A bounding box is the intersection of orthogonally oriented bounding slabs. Bounding slabs have been used to speed up ray tracing

A in 2-D is quite useful to speedup the clipping or visibility test of a B-Spline curve. See &quot;Circle and B-Splines clipping algorithms&quot; under the subject Clipping (computer graphics) for an example of use.

A convex hull is the smallest convex volume containing the object. If the object is the union of a finite set of points, its convex hull is a polytope.

A (DOP) generalizes the bounding box. A k-DOP is the Boolean intersection of extents along &quot;k&quot; directions. Thus, a &quot;k&quot;-DOP is the Boolean intersection of &quot;k&quot; bounding slabs and is a convex polytope containing the object (in 2-D a polygon; in 3-D a polyhedron). A 2-D rectangle is a special case of a 2-DOP, and a 3-D box is a special case of a 3-DOP. In general, the axes of a DOP do not have to be orthogonal, and there can be more axes than dimensions of space. For example, a 3-D box that is beveled on all edges and corners can be constructed as a 13-DOP. The actual number of faces can be less than 2 times &quot;k&quot; if some faces become degenerate, shrunk to an edge or a vertex.

==Basic intersection checks==
For some types of bounding volume (OBB and convex polyhedra), an effective check is that of the separating axis theorem. The idea here is that, if there exists an axis by which the objects do not overlap, then the objects do not intersect. Usually the axes checked are those of the basic axes for the volumes (the unit axes in the case of an AABB, or the 3 base axes from each OBB in the case of OBBs). Often, this is followed by also checking the cross-products of the previous axes (one axis from each object).

In the case of an AABB, this tests becomes a simple set of overlap tests in terms of the unit axes. For an &quot;AABB&quot; defined by &quot;M&quot;,&quot;N&quot; against one defined by &quot;O&quot;,&quot;P&quot; they do not intersect if
(&quot;M&quot;&quot;x&quot; &gt; &quot;P&quot;&quot;x&quot;) or (&quot;O&quot;&quot;x&quot; &gt; &quot;N&quot;&quot;x&quot;) or (&quot;M&quot;&quot;y&quot; &gt; &quot;P&quot;&quot;y&quot;) or (&quot;O&quot;&quot;y&quot; &gt; &quot;N&quot;&quot;y&quot;) or (&quot;M&quot;&quot;z&quot; &gt; &quot;P&quot;&quot;z&quot;) or (&quot;O&quot;&quot;z&quot; &gt; &quot;N&quot;&quot;z&quot;).

An AABB can also be projected along an axis, for example, if it has edges of length L and is centered at &quot;C&quot;, and is being projected along the axis N:
formula_1, and formula_2 or formula_3, and formula_4
where m and n are the minimum and maximum extents.

An OBB is similar in this respect, but is slightly more complicated. For an OBB with L and C as above, and with &quot;I&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, and &quot;K&quot; as the OBB&#x27;s base axes, then:

: formula_5

: formula_6

For the ranges &quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot; and &quot;o&quot;,&quot;p&quot; it can be said that they do not intersect if &quot;m&quot; &gt; &quot;p&quot; or &quot;o&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;. Thus, by projecting the ranges of 2 OBBs along the I, J, and K axes of each OBB, and checking for non-intersection, it is possible to detect non-intersection. By additionally checking along the cross products of these axes (I0×I1, I0×J1, ...) one can be more certain that intersection is impossible.

This concept of determining non-intersection via use of axis projection also extends to convex polyhedra, however with the normals of each polyhedral face being used instead of the base axes, and with the extents being based on the minimum and maximum dot products of each vertex against the axes. Note that this description assumes the checks are being done in world space.

The intersection of two &quot;k&quot;-DOP&#x27;s can be computed very similarly to AABBs: for each orientation, you just check the two corresponding intervals of the two DOP&#x27;s. So, just like DOP&#x27;s being a generalization of AABBs, the intersection test is a generalization of the AABB overlap test. The complexity of the overlap test of two DOP&#x27;s is in . This assumes, however, that both DOP&#x27;s are given with respect to the same set of orientations. If one of them is rotated, this is no longer true. In that case, one relatively easy way to check the two DOP&#x27;s formula_7 for intersection is to enclose the rotated one, formula_8, by another, smallest enclosing DOP formula_9 that is oriented with respect to the orientations of the first DOP formula_10. The procedure for that is a little bit more complex, but eventually amounts to a matrix vector multiplication of complexity as well.

<text>Bomaderry is a suburb in the City of Shoalhaven local government area in New South Wales, Australia. At the , it had a population of 8,718 people. It is on the north shore of the Shoalhaven River, across the river from Nowra, the major town of the City of Shoalhaven, of which Bomaderry is locally regarded as being a suburb of the city.

==History==
Bomaderry township was opened in 1882. It was previously part of the Shoalhaven Estate owned by David Berry whose brother Alexander Berry had built a road to the area in 1858. When David died in 1889 the estate was sold in portions. The subdivision plans for Bomaderry are shown. In 1893 the railway was extended to Bomaderry and the town began to grow from this time.

One of the first houses in Bomaderry was Lynburn which still exists today. It was built in 1895 by the architect Howard Joseland for Jane Morton, the widow of Henry Gordon Morton, the manager of the Shoalhaven Estate. A photo shortly after its construction is shown. The road over the bridge in the photo is now the Princes Highway where it crosses Bomaderry Creek.

After the town opened in 1892 several factories moved into the area. Messrs Denham Bros. built a bacon and ham factory in about 1900. A milk condensery opened in 1901 which was originally located near the railway station but later moved to the bank of the Shoalhaven River close to Bolong Road. In 1912, the Nowra Co-op Dairy Company established a milk Depot at Bomaderry and this was a major boost to the local economy for many years.

== Heritage listings ==
Bomaderry has 2 heritage-listed sites, including:
* 59 Beinda Street: Bomaderry Aboriginal Children&#x27;s Home
* Illawarra railway: Bomaderry railway station

==Transport==
Its railway station is the terminus of the South Coast railway line, which is part of the NSW TrainLink network. Bomaderry has public bus services both within the suburb and to neighbouring areas. These were significantly expanded in 2020, with 45 new routes announced.

==Education==
Bomaderry High School is one of the major high schools in the Shoalhaven, holding places in state debating, public speaking, sporting and dance eisteddfod. Nowra Anglican College is a K–12 school located in Bomaderry. Bomaderry Public School is the main primary school in the area with over 400 students.

==Population==
According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 6,661 people in Bomaderry.
* The median age of people in Bomaderry (State Suburbs) was 45 years. 
* Children aged 0–14 years made up 16.8% of the population 
* People aged 65 years and over made up 24.3% of the population.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 7.4% of the population. 
* 79.7% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 4.1%. 
* 88.5% of people spoke only English at home. 
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 28.4%, Anglican 24.4% and Catholic 18.7%.

<doc id="657110" wikidata="Q2502664" url="?curid=657110" title="Ustad Mansur">
<text>Ustad Mansur (died 1624) was a seventeenth-century Indian painter and naturalist who served as a Mughal court artist. During which period he excelled at depicting plants and animals. He was the earliest artist to depict the dodo in colour, apart from being the first to illustrate the Siberian crane. Towards the end of Akbar&#x27;s reign, he gained the title of &quot;ustad&quot; (master) and during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir his masterpieces earned him the title of &quot;Nãdir-al-’Asr&quot; (Unequalled of the age). Although he was largely known for his natural history illustrations, he also portrayed people in various manuscript illustrations.

==Life and work==
The year of Mansur&#x27;s birth is unknown. His name was suffixed in some early miniatures as &quot;Naqqash&quot;, which can refer to an artist, painter, or carver, indicating that he came from a family that was in an artistic profession. A single miniature showing &#x27;Babur meeting his sister&#x27; (folio 8, National Museum) is attributed to Mansur but he otherwise finds no mention in Babur&#x27;s memoirs (&quot;Baburnama&quot;). He was associated with other artists of the period including Basawan, Miskina and Nanha. During Akbar&#x27;s reign he appears to have been involved only as a colourist in the plates for the Book of Akbar (&quot;Akbarnama&quot;) and his name is not mentioned by Abu&#x27;l-Fazl among the list of artists. Akbar followed the principle that all artwork should include the name of the artist on the margin. The British Museum&#x27;s copy of the &quot;Akbarnama&quot; (1604) includes some folios (35,110a,110b and 112a) where his name is prefixed with &quot;ustad&quot; (=master), indicating his rise to excellence.

Early works included parts of portraits and other scenes. The earliest works were made as part of the &quot;Baburnama&quot; (1590–95) and most of these are as an assistant or a colourist. His Veena-player (c. 1595) and coronation portrait of Jahangir (c. 1605, made along with the artist Manohar) are early works. In 1612, Jehangir received a turkey cock from Goa and this was illustrated by Mansur. In 1619, Jehangir received a Barbary falcon as a gift from Shah Abbas of Persia; Jehangir found it rare and beautifully patterned and when it died, he ordered that a likeness be made of the bird. In 1620, Jehangir visited Kashmir and spotted a brown dipper which he described in his memoirs (&quot;Tuzk-e-Jahangiri&quot;) translated as:

&quot;... In this stream I saw a bird like a &quot;saj&quot;. It dives and remains for a long time underneath and then comes up from a different place. I ordered them to catch and bring two or three of these birds, that I might ascertain whether they were waterfowl and were web-footed, or had open feet like land birds. They caught two... One died immediately and the other lived for a day. Its feet were not webbed like a duck&#x27;s. I ordered Nadirul-asr Ustad Mansur to draw its likeness.&quot;

Mansur painted at least one hundred flowers from the Kashmir valley during this period. A red tulip from Kashmir is a better-known painting. The identity of the tulip is however debated with competing suggestions that include &quot;Tulipa lanata&quot;, &quot;T. montana&quot; and &quot;T. lehmanniana&quot;. In 1621, Jehangir was gifted a zebra and this was perhaps the subject of the last miniature painting made by Mansur. It is suggested that his career ended with the reign of Jehangir in 1627.
Several other signed works, such as one of the Siberian crane (now no longer a winter migrant to India) and the other of a Bengal florican are in the Indian Museum, Kolkata. Some other works are in the National Museum, Delhi, the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum, Jaipur and the Chhatrapati Sivaji Vastu Sangrahalaya, Mumbai.

Not all of Mansur&#x27;s birds were based on reality. He also created fantasy birds and many of the compositions such as the flowers and insects in the background are juxtapositions created for effect. It appears that these imaginary birds were made in the style of his senior peers, Miskina and Ikhlas, and were made only early in his career as an artist. In terms of style, Mansur&#x27;s illustrations focus on detail with a single bird dominating the composition. The birds or animals are in a standing posture or in a feeding stance. He often used plants and insects in the background and the floral borders, characteristic of Mughal works may help in identifying his works.

The most significant paintings, in terms of zoology, are those of the Siberian crane and the dodo. The Siberian crane painting was made well before it was formally described and given a binomial name by Peter Simon Pallas in 1773. The painting of the dodo is among the rare few that were depicted in colour and is a very important source for zoologists. It is thought that the dodo was brought through Surat to Jehangir&#x27;s court via Portuguese-controlled Goa and the painting of it was discovered in the Hermitage at St. Petersburg and although unsigned has been thought to be the work of Mansur or a close contemporary. Two dodos were described by the English traveller Peter Mundy at Surat and it is thought that the painting is based on one of them. Mundy was in the region between 1628 and 1633. The Siberian crane painted on paper is extremely detailed showing the wrinkles on the bare skin, the legs and a small feather stuck to the claw. Abanindranath Tagore was taken by E. B. Havell, principal of the art school at Calcutta and shown this painting. On examining the detail through a lens, he was inspired to move away from oil on canvas to gouache on paper.
Ustad Mansur was not the only artist in the Mughal court to illustrate flora and fauna. Other artists included Abu&#x27;l Hasan, Farrukh Beg, Govardhan, Inayat, Manohar, Muhammad Nadir, Murad and Pidarath. Jehangir considered Mansur and Abu&#x27;l Hasan to be exceptional artists. Abu&#x27;l Hasan was given the titled of &quot;Nadir uz Zaman&quot;. Several 17th-19th century artists have come to both imitate and copy his works (sometimes with his signature), especially for export to Europe. It is therefore not easy to assess a true work by Ustad Mansur, which can in case of the chameleon (left) be done by taking in account the quality of the work. The painting is highly detailed and is presumed to be an Indian chameleon on account of the highly detailed view of the feet of the animal showing each foot exhibiting &quot;fused digits in opposed groups&quot;, a lighter band by the edge of the mouth, and a line of white scales on the underside of the belly.

Mansur was also a capable portrait artist. His painting of the musician Naubat Khan who worked in the courts of Akbar and later Jahangir is an example.
A crater on the planet Mercury is named in honour of Mansur.

<doc id="657118" wikidata="Q388140" url="?curid=657118" title="Juan de Mena">
<text>Juan de Mena (1411–1456) was one of the most significant Spanish poets of the fifteenth century. He was highly regarded at the court of Juan II de Castilla, who appointed him &quot;veinticuatro&quot; (one of twenty-four aldermen) of Córdoba, &quot;secretario de cartas latinas&quot; (secretary of Latin letters) and &quot;cronista real&quot; (royal chronicler). His works show the influence of Renaissance humanism and place him in the period of transition in Spain from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance.

==Biography==
There is scant evidence about the early part of Mena&#x27;s life, but most modern scholars agree that he was born at Córdoba, Spain, his father died shortly after his birth, and his mother a few years later. He was likely the second of two sons and was related to a former &quot;veinticuatro&quot; of Córdoba, although it is unclear how. &quot;Memorias de algunos linages&quot; (An Account of Some Lineages), attributed to Mena, claims that his family came from the valley of Mena in La Montaña, a region of the northern Spanish province of Cantabria, and served under Fernando III de Castilla and his successors in the &quot;Reconquista&quot;. His formal education probably began in Córdoba and later continued in Salamanca, where he appears to have fulfilled the requirements for the Master of Arts degree. He then traveled to Rome, perhaps as a continued part of his education, although there is no evidence that he participated in formal study there. During this trip and a later one to Florence, Mena appears to have been seeking ecclesiastical benefices; however, both attempts were fruitless and each was followed by a marriage, first to a supposed sister of García y Lope de Vaca and, secondly, to Marina Méndez, more than 20 years his minor. Neither marriage resulted in descendants for the poet. Some scholars have pointed to a possible &quot;converso&quot; origin for Mena&#x27;s family, but others have found these claims to be highly speculative. Mena continued in the role of &quot;cronista real&quot; under Enrique IV de Castilla until his death at Torrelaguna in 1456, although he apparently did not write any chronicle.

==Works==
Mena was considered by his contemporaries to be the outstanding poet of his time, and his knowledge of Latin and the Classics was greatly admired. His activities at the court of Juan II brought him into contact with many important figures; the most significant friendship that resulted was with Íñigo López de Mendoza. It persisted until the end of Mena&#x27;s life despite important political differences.

His poetry frequently appeared in &quot;cancioneros&quot; (collections of verse), such as the &quot;Cancionero general&quot; of Hernando del Castillo, and his works were well known throughout the sixteenth century, influencing later Spanish poets, such as Garcilaso de la Vega, Fernando de Herrera and Luis de Góngora. The extensive commentary that accompanied later editions of Mena&#x27;s &quot;Laberinto de Fortuna&quot;, such as those of Hernán Núñez (1499) and Francisco Sánchez de las Brozas (1582), provide further evidence of the extent of his literary influence in Spain. His style is marked by its frequent use of Latinisms and hyperbaton, as well as by mentions of a wide array of figures from Greco-Roman mythology. In his imitation of classical and medieval sources, such as Dante, Mena helped stretch the capabilities of a fledgling Castilian literary tradition, paving the way for later poets. It is largely due to the awkwardness and weight of his style and lexicon that his influence began to wane in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and fell out of favor with nineteenth-century critics. Modern critics have reinstated Mena&#x27;s importance to Spain&#x27;s literary history and consider him to be one of the three major poets of the fifteenth century, along with Íñigo López de Mendoza and Jorge Manrique.

===&quot;La Coronaçión&quot;===
Mena wrote &quot;La Coronaçión&quot; (or &quot;Calamicleos&quot;, The Coronation, 1438) and dedicated it to Íñigo López de Mendoza, marqués de Santillana (marquis of Santillana), in response to the latter&#x27;s 1438 victory on the frontier between Muslim and Christian Spain, which resulted in the taking of Huelma. Although a relatively minor victory, it was the first successful campaign of the &quot;Reconquista&quot; since 1431. The poem consists of 51 stanzas recounting a dream sequence in which the poet first sees historical and mythological figures being punished for their vices or their failure to act, and later sees those figures who have earned a place on Mount Parnassus for their virtues; principal among those praised is the marqués de Santillana.

Although Santillana was also well known as a poet, he is praised in the poem as an exemplar of the four cardinal virtues. The poem is allegorical in nature and corresponds to Mena&#x27;s idea of satire in that it condemns vice and praises virtue. It is possible to interpret the &quot;Reconquista&quot; and national unity as the principal themes of the poem; one of Mena&#x27;s lesson seems to be that internal strife is a vice that hinders the Christian reconquest of Spain.

In the original version of &quot;La Coronaçión&quot; Juan de Mena included extensive commentary, in highly ornamental and Latinate prose. The commentary addresses each stanza and explains mythological references, as well as the poem&#x27;s moral-allegorical function. Such commentary was ordinarily reserved for the Classics.

===&quot;Laberinto de Fortuna&quot;===
&quot;Laberinto de Fortuna&quot; (&quot;Labyrinth of Fortune&quot;, 1444) is Mena&#x27;s masterpiece. The structure of the poem is a mixture of two popular medieval allegorical elements: the Wheel of Fortune and the Ptolemaic universe. The structure of the poem centers around three Wheels of Fortune (past, present and future). The 297 stanza poem (also known as &quot;Las Trecientas&quot; (The Three Hundred), as there are versions with three additional stanzas) reintroduces the themes of national unity and the &quot;Reconquista&quot; but is dedicated to Juan II.

===Lyric Poetry===
In addition to his moral-political works, Mena also produced more traditional courtly poetry. There are fifty or so surviving examples of Mena&#x27;s lyric poetry, including love lyrics, occasional verses, satirical pieces, and exchanges with other poets. The minor lyrics are far less complex than his major works in both style and content. His love poetry was well respected for its originality and treatment of the nature of love&#x27;s passion as an abstract, intellectual experience.

===Other works===
Other works include a translation of the &quot;Ilias latina&quot;, the Latin version of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, into Spanish (ca. 1442), &quot;Tratado sobre el título de duque&quot; (Treatise on the Title of Duke, 1445), a prologue to Álvaro de Luna&#x27;s &quot;Libro de las virtuosas e claras mugeres&quot; (Book of Virtuous and Illustrious Women), and &quot;Coplas de los pecados mortales&quot; (Stanzas on the Deadly Sins, unfinished, 1456). &quot;Tratado de amor&quot; (Treatise on Love, ca. 1444) and &quot;Memorias de algunos linages&quot; or &quot;Memorias genealógicas&quot; (An Account of Some Lineages, 1448) are also attributed to de Mena.

<text>Post Captain is the second historical novel in the Aubrey–Maturin series by Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1972. It features the characters of Captain Jack Aubrey and naval surgeon Stephen Maturin, and is set in the early 19th century during the Napoleonic Wars.

During the brief Peace of Amiens, Aubrey and Maturin live in a country house in England, where they meet women with whom they fall in love. The mores of courtship restrict both men as to making marriage proposals. Then their lives are turned upside down when Aubrey loses his money due to decisions of the prize court and a dishonest prize-agent. To avoid seizure for debt, they proceed through France to Maturin&#x27;s property in Spain. When the war begins afresh, Aubrey has a command aboard HMS &quot;Polychrest&quot;, gaining fewer prizes yet succeeding in his military goals. He is eventually promoted and is given temporary command of the frigate HMS &quot;Lively&quot; while its captain is ashore. The emotions of his love life interfere with his ways at sea, showing him sharply different in his decisiveness at sea compared to his clumsiness on land.

The novel was received well at its initial publishing, but received more and better notice after its re-issue in 1990. That much of the story is set on land drew some to consider it O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s homage to Jane Austen, one of his favorite authors. Author Mary Renault gave the novel high praise, while Alison Sulentic commended it for the two different ways that Maturin and Aubrey &quot;come to know wisdom&quot; as a result of falling in love.

==Plot summary==
With the Peace of Amiens, Jack Aubrey returns to England and rents a house with Stephen Maturin, with shipmates running the household, and the friends spending their time fox hunting. They meet the Williams family, who live on a neighboring estate. Aubrey courts Sophia Williams, the eldest of three daughters, while Maturin pursues Diana Villiers, Sophia&#x27;s cousin. Jack wants to marry Sophia, but they delay making a firm engagement. His fortune disappears when his prize-agent absconds with his funds and the prize court finds that two merchant ships he had captured were owned by neutral nations. The court demands he repay the value of the ships (rather than gain the prize money he expected), a sum beyond his means. Mrs Williams takes her daughters away to Bath on this news. Jack also dallies with Diana, straining his friendship with Stephen and showing himself indecisive on land, in contrast to his decisive ways at sea. Aubrey and Maturin flee England to avoid Aubrey being taken for debt.

In Toulon to visit Christy Pallière, the French captain who had captured Aubrey&#x27;s first command &quot;Sophie&quot; before the peace, they learn that a renewal of the war is imminent. French authorities round up all English subjects. Jack and Stephen escape over the Pyrenees to Stephen&#x27;s property in Catalonia, with Stephen disguised as an itinerant bear trainer and Jack as the bear, Flora. They reach Gibraltar, where Jack and Stephen take passage aboard a merchant ship of the British East India Company, the &quot;Lord Nelson&quot;. The ship is captured by the French privateer &quot;Bellone&quot;, but a British squadron overtakes them and rescues Aubrey, Maturin, and the other passengers.

In England, Jack is offered a letter of marque by Mr Canning, a wealthy Jewish merchant. At the same gathering at Queeney&#x27;s, Mrs Williams and her daughter Cecilia are among the guests. Unaware Jack would be there, Sophia had stayed home with her sister Frances. Mrs Williams learns of Stephen&#x27;s castle in Spain and his training as a physician, raising his status in her eyes. An inadequate thief approaches Jack as he walks outdoors; this Mr Scriven proves to be a useful friend, knowing the law of debt and where Jack can be safe from bailiffs. Aubrey and Maturin move to The Grapes, safe in the Liberty of the Savoy.

Offered command of HMS &quot;Polychrest&quot;, Jack turns Canning down. &quot;Polychrest&quot; is an oddly designed ship that was purpose-built as an experimental weapon, though the project is now abandoned and the Admiralty has tried to refit her for ordinary service. She is structurally weak and sails poorly, and the first lieutenant, Parker, is liberal with his punishments of the crew. Jack asks that Tom Pullings be promoted to lieutenant. Jack is given a free hand by Admiral Harte, who stands to benefit personally from any prizes taken. To Harte&#x27;s disappointment, Jack captures no prizes. When he drives the French privateer &quot;Bellone&quot; aground outside a Spanish port, the merchants reward him. Harte then assigns Jack to escort convoys in the English Channel. Jack gains a reputation for lingering in port as he carries on a furtive affair with Diana. Meanwhile, Stephen is sent on an intelligence-gathering mission in Spain. On his return, Stephen is advised by Jack&#x27;s friend Heneage Dundas to warn Jack about his reputation with the Admiralty. When Stephen does so, Jack gets angry, their competition over Diana is acknowledged, and the two agree to fight a duel. Jack calls on Diana, but finds her with Canning, ending Jack&#x27;s interest in her.

Jack is ordered to raid the French port of Chaulieu to sink the French troopships and gunboats gathered there and to destroy the &quot;Fanciulla&quot;. The crew plans to mutiny because of their harsh treatment under Parker, but Stephen overhears their plans and warns Jack. Jack rues his angry words with Stephen, and then quashes the mutiny by putting the instigators and some loyal crew in a ship&#x27;s boat and quickly beginning the attack. During the engagement, &quot;Polychrest&quot; runs aground between two enemy batteries. Jack leads three of the ship&#x27;s boats to board and capture &quot;Fanciulla&quot;. The successful party then attempts to refloat &quot;Polychrest&quot;, which founders after leaving Chaulieu, and the crew transfer to &quot;Fanciulla&quot;. After the battle, Stephen and Jack, who has been seriously wounded in the battle, resume their friendship.

Aubrey returns to England in &quot;Fanciulla&quot; and is promoted to post-captain. With debt still hanging over him, he asks for any available command. He is assigned as acting captain for , whose Captain Hamond has taken leave to sit in Parliament. Returning from Spain, Maturin tells the head of naval intelligence, Sir Joseph Blaine, that the Spanish will formally enter the war in alliance with France as soon as four ships full of bullion from Montevideo arrive safely in Cadiz. At Stephen&#x27;s urging, Sophia asks Jack to transport her and her sister to the Downs. Though Jack is too poor to propose a marriage settlement satisfactory to Mrs Williams, Jack and Sophia come to an agreement not to marry anyone else. Stephen is close friends with Sophia but does not take her advice to propose to Diana. While attending the opera, he sees that Diana is being kept by Canning, and his pain is deep.

Maturin takes no pay for his intelligence work but does ask a favour: that &quot;Lively&quot; be included in the squadron sent to intercept the Spanish treasure fleet. The Admiralty agrees and asks Stephen to negotiate the fleet&#x27;s surrender. Stephen is given a temporary naval rank; because of this and his connection to the Admiralty, Jack realizes that Stephen has been involved in intelligence work for Britain. Jack understands that there is a side of his friend that he did not know. The Spanish convoy refuses to surrender, and battle breaks out. One Spanish frigate (the &quot;Mercedes&quot;) explodes, and the other three (&quot;Fama&quot;, &quot;Clara&quot;, and &quot;Medea&quot;) surrender. &quot;Clara&quot; strikes her colours to &quot;Lively&quot;, pleasing Jack, but &quot;Fama&quot;, carrying the bulk of the Spanish treasure, attempts to escape to Cadiz; &quot;Lively&quot; pursues and captures her. Jack invites two of the Spanish captains to dinner, along with Dr Maturin, and they all toast Sophia.

==O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s sources==
===Historical===
Stephen Maturin, in presenting his radical position against the tyranny of the navy, says that he would &quot;certainly have joined the mutineers&quot; had he been at the Spithead Mutiny.

The Treaty of Amiens was signed 25 March 1802 by Joseph Bonaparte and the Marquess Cornwallis as a &quot;Definitive Treaty of Peace&quot;. The consequent Peace of Amiens lasted only one year, ending on 18 May 1803. It was the only period of general peace in Europe during the so-called &#x27;Great French War&#x27; between 1793 and 1815. Captain Christy-Pallière, whom Jack and Stephen visit at Toulon, was a real French Navy officer who did command the naval base at Toulon, though not in 1803.

For a few hundred years beginning in the 14th century, the Duchy of Lancaster was not subject to the King&#x27;s laws, including pursuit for debt, having its own courts, laws and power of decision. Savoy was part of the lands in that Duchy. Though it was adjacent to the City of London and to Westminster, the Liberty of the Savoy, sometimes called the Liberties of the Savoy, was a safe haven from debt collectors acting under the King&#x27;s law until sometime in the 19th century, after the Napoleonic Wars. The author explained this from his own knowledge at a publisher&#x27;s web page.

The novel describes the political tensions between Lord Melville, First Lord of the Admiralty with the support of Prime Minister Pitt, and the Whigs, whose First Lord had been Earl St Vincent, immediate predecessor to Lord Melville. The Whigs charged Lord Melville with misappropriation of public funds. The novel posits that Melville could not properly defend himself because the funds in question were associated with the secret appropriations for intelligence gathering while he was Treasurer in the Admiralty. At the end of the novel, Lord Melville still holds his position while the impeachment and trial occur in the House of Lords. Lord Melville was acquitted in real life, but did not hold the office of First Lord again; his son Robert held the post later in the Napoleonic Wars. Like his father, he is portrayed as being in favor of the fictional Captain Aubrey.

The last action in the novel is based on a real action, the Battle of Cape Santa Maria on 5 October 1804, in which four British frigates – , , , and – successfully intercepted a Spanish flotilla carrying gold from South America, leaving from the mouth of the River Plate in present-day Montevideo, Uruguay. Captain Hamond, later Sir Graham Hamond, 2nd Baronet, was not in fact a member of Parliament and was in command of &quot;Lively&quot; during the action, taking the Spanish ships as Aubrey does in the novel.

===Literature===

In a conversation with MacDonald, Stephen Maturin argues about the various qualities of the Gaelic poet Ossian&#x27;s writing and authenticity. This references similar controversy which had arisen during the period about the true authorship of James Macpherson&#x27;s translation of his epic cycle, and continues to be questioned today in literary circles. In this same conversation, MacDonald references the Roman legal principle &quot;&quot;, which translates to &quot;false in one thing, false in all things&quot;.

==Publication history==

&quot;Post Captain&quot; was first published by Lippincott in the US and Collins in the UK, both in 1972. W W Norton issued a reprint in the USA 18 years after the initial publication as part of its reissue in paperback of all the novels in the series prior to 1991. The novel has been in print since the re-issue, and also released in e-book and audiobook formats, in response to continuing interest in the novel.

The process of reissuing the novels initially published prior to 1991 was in full swing in 1991, as the whole series gained a new and wider audience, as Mark Howowitz describes in writing about &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;, the fourteenth novel in the series, which was first published in 1991.

Two of my favorite friends are fictitious characters; they live in more than a dozen volumes always near at hand. Their names are Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, and their creator is a 77-year-old novelist named Patrick O&#x27;Brian, whose 14 books about them have been continuously in print in England since the first, &quot;Master and Commander,&quot; was published in 1970.

O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s British fans include T. J. Binyon, Iris Murdoch, A. S. Byatt, Timothy Mo and the late Mary Renault, but, until recently, this splendid saga of two serving officers in the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars was unavailable in this country, apart from the first few installments which went immediately out of print. Last year, however, W. W. Norton decided to reissue the series in its entirety, and so far nine of the 14 have appeared here, including the most recent chapter, &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;.

==Literary significance and criticism==
:&quot;One of the finest seafaring novels of the Napoleonic wars.&quot; – R. W., &quot;Taranaki Herald&quot; (New Zealand), on &quot;Post Captain&quot;

Mary Renault had high praise for the novel:
&quot;Master and Commander&quot; raised almost dangerously high expectations, &quot;Post Captain&quot; triumphantly surpasses them. Mr O&#x27;Brian is a master of his period, in which his characters are finely placed, while remaining three-dimensional, thoroughly human beings. This book sets him at the very top of his genre; he does not just have the chief qualifications of a first-class historical novelist, he has them all. The action scenes are superb; towards the end, far from being aware that one is reading what is, physically, a fairly long book, one notes with dismay that there is not much more to come...A brilliant book.

&quot;Library Journal&quot; found this to be a &quot;rich blend of adventure, romance, and intrigue&quot;, reviewing an audiobook version read by John Lee and &quot;Recommended for most collections.&quot;

Frank Prial wrote about &quot;Post Captain&quot;, in an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about the author in 1998, that &quot;The Aubrey-Maturin series has been said to rival the sequential novels of Trollope and Anthony Powell. Mr O&#x27;Brian is particularly pleased when he is compared to Jane Austen, whom he reveres as the finest of all English novelists. First editions of most of her novels share shelf space in his small library here with first editions of Gibbon and Dr. Johnson and a battered but still useful 1810 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. The second book of the series, &quot;Post Captain,&quot; set mostly in country houses and as much a novel of manners as a sea story, has been said to be Mr. O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s homage to Ms. Austen.&quot;

In an article published in a maritime law journal, Alison Sulentic proposes that &quot;As inviting as &quot;Master and Commander&quot; may be, however, it is &quot;Post Captain&quot;, the second novel in the series, that unveils O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s genius and stakes his claim to recognition as the author of &quot;the best historical novels ever written.&quot; The intricate interweaving of plot lines that trace the personal and professional fortunes of the main characters crosses many of the more traditional categorizations of popular fiction.&quot; Sulentic assesses the plot in some detail against moral philosophy and the notions of &#x27;the law as it is&#x27; and &#x27;the law as it ought to be&#x27;, and the development of Aubrey and Maturin in &quot;Post Captain&quot;, saying on page 588, &quot;Over the course of &quot;Post Captain&quot;, both Jack and Stephen come to know wisdom in a way that profoundly alters the approach each takes to the intersection of law and morality.&quot; She mentions on page 589 the felicitous choice of names, perhaps a &quot;deliberate conceit&quot;, for the ship Aubrey loves, HMS &quot;Sophie&quot; and the woman he loves, Sophia, and the name Sophia meaning wisdom.

In a more recent review, author Jo Walton finds this the book in the series with the poorest plot structure (&quot;broken-backed&quot;) though complimenting the characters and incidents. The particular incident of the duel that did not happen between Aubrey and Maturin is noted: &quot;The duel and then the fact that they never mention that they&#x27;ve reconciled feels very strange.&quot; She notes a scene worth praise for showing the themes of life on land versus life at sea, where Aubrey &quot;runs from the bailiffs back to sea and calls back &quot;Mr Pullings, press that man!&quot; He presses the bailiffs who have come to arrest him for debt!

Daly began her career on stage in summer stock in New York, and made her Broadway debut in the play &quot;That Summer – That Fall&quot; in 1967. She is best known for her television role as Detective Mary Beth Lacey in the CBS police drama &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; (1982–88), for which she won four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. She also won Emmy Awards for her roles as Alice Henderson in the period drama series &quot;Christy&quot; (1994–95), and Maxine Gray in the legal drama series &quot;Judging Amy&quot; (1999–2005).

She starred in the Broadway revival of &quot;Gypsy&quot; (1989), earning the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. Her other Tony-nominated roles were in &quot;Rabbit Hole&quot; (2006) and &quot;Mothers and Sons&quot; (2014). She played Maria Callas, both on Broadway and in London&#x27;s West End, in the play &quot;Master Class&quot; (2011–12). Her other Broadway credits include &quot;The Seagull&quot; (1992) and &quot;It Shoulda Been You&quot; (2015).

Daly made her film debut in &quot;John and Mary&quot; (1969). She is known for her film roles in &quot;The Enforcer&quot; (1976), &quot;Hello, My Name Is Doris&quot; (2015), and &quot;The Ballad of Buster Scruggs&quot; (2018). She received a Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female nomination for her role in the Patrick Wang drama &quot;A Bread Factory&quot; (2018). She portrayed Anne Marie Hoag in Marvel Studios&#x27; &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017).

== Early years and education ==
Daly was born in Madison, Wisconsin, to actor James Daly and actress Mary Hope (née Newell). She is of Irish descent, her ancestors being from Limerick and County Kerry. Her younger brother is actor Tim Daly, and she has two sisters, Mary Glynn and Pegeen Michael.

She was raised in Rockland County, New York, where she started her career by performing in summer stock with her family; she earned her Equity Card at age 15. She studied at Brandeis University and the American Musical and Dramatic Academy.

==Career==
=== 1967–1980: Career beginnings ===
Daly&#x27;s first Broadway role was in 1967 in a short-lived play, &quot;That Summer, That Fall&quot;.

Daly appeared in &quot;John and Mary&quot; (1969), &quot;Angel Unchained&quot; (1970), &quot;Play It as It Lays&quot; (1972), and &quot;The Adulteress&quot;. She was cast as Inspector Harry Callahan&#x27;s first female partner, Kate Moore, in the 1976 Dirty Harry film &quot;The Enforcer&quot;. The film was critically panned, though a box office success. Daly&#x27;s performance divided critics, with some calling it too &quot;mannered&quot; for film, while others praised the strength she brought to the role. The concept of a male/female police partnership was later used as the basis for the television show &quot;Hunter&quot;.

=== 1981–2005: Breakthrough and stardom ===

Daly appeared in the CBS police-procedural crime drama &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; as Mary Beth Lacey, the married working mother. She won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series four times, in 1983, 1984, 1985, and 1988, and was a nominee in 1986 and 1987. Between co-star Sharon Gless and her, they won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series six years in a row.

In 1988, Daly appeared on the Dolly Parton TV variety show &quot;Dolly&quot;, and sang (at her request) a duet with Parton. Broadway producer Barry Brown saw the show and, impressed by Daly&#x27;s performance, decided to mount a revival of the musical &quot;Gypsy&quot; with Daly in the lead role of Rose. &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; had finished airing, and Daly agreed. In April 1989, the Daly-helmed &quot;Gypsy&quot; revival began a 14-city U.S. tour; it was then presented on Broadway in November 1989. This production was the second revival of the show to play Broadway (the first was in 1974 with Angela Lansbury). Daly won the 1990 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance in &quot;Gypsy&quot;. Daly left &quot;Gypsy&quot; in July 1990, with Linda Lavin playing Rose, and returned in April 1991 through closing in July 1991.

In 1991, Daly guest-starred on her brother Tim&#x27;s series &quot;Wings&quot;, playing a woman who dates Brian Hackett (Steven Weber), brother of Tim&#x27;s character Joe. She appeared in the Broadway revival of &quot;The Seagull&quot; in 1992 as Madame Arkadina. She appeared as Sally Adams in the City Center Encores! staged concert of &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; in February 1995. In regional theatre, she played Lola in &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot; at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, Los Angeles, in April 1997.

She appeared as social worker Maxine Gray, who was also the mother to the show&#x27;s title character on the CBS drama &quot;Judging Amy&quot;, which ran from 1999 to 2005. Addressing a conference of the National Association of Social Workers in 2000, Daly said she had learned from social workers and social work texts to improve her portrayal of her character, and she added: &quot;I take from you because you are the ones dealing with all the bad institutions of our society: institutionalized poverty, institutionalized racism, institutionalized cynicism.&quot; Daly appeared in the Lifetime television film &quot;Undercover Christmas&quot; in 2003 as Anne Cunningham. Among her later television roles, Daly reunited with &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; costar Sharon Gless in a 2010 guest role on the series &quot;Burn Notice&quot;.

=== 2006–present: Return to Broadway ===

She appeared on Broadway in the David Lindsay-Abaire play &quot;Rabbit Hole&quot; (2006) portraying the mother of the play&#x27;s protagonist, played by Cynthia Nixon. For her performance she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. In January 2008, she played the role of Mother in the world premiere production of Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;Me, Myself &amp; I&quot; at the McCarter Theatre, Princeton, New Jersey. In 2009, she appeared in the original cast of &quot;Love, Loss, and What I Wore&quot;. Daly performed a cabaret act, &quot;Second Time Around&quot;, in January 2010 at Feinstein&#x27;s at Loews Regency, New York City. She had previously performed at Feinstein&#x27;s in May 2009.

During this time she took several roles in television including taking on the role of portraying Mabel Dodge Luhan in the Lifetime movie &quot;Georgia O&#x27;Keefe&quot; acting alongside Jeremy Irons and Joan Allen. She also guest starred as Carolyn Shepherd in a 2009 episode of the ABC medical drama series &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; and Tina in the 2010 episode of the USA Network series &quot;Burn Notice&quot;. She starred as Maria Callas in the Terrence McNally play &quot;Master Class&quot; at the Manhattan Theater Club on Broadway, from June 14, 2011 (previews) to September 4, 2011. For her performance she was nominated for the Outer Critics Circle Awards for Best Actress in a Play. Daly reprised her role as Maria Callas in the West End production of &quot;Master Class&quot;, which opened at the Vaudeville Theatre on February 7, 2012 (after previews from January 21) in a limited engagement to April 28, 2012. She had a guest starring role as an imperious teacher Mrs. Plank in 2014 episode &quot;Won&#x27;t You Be Our Neighbor&quot; from the ABC sitcom &quot;Modern Family&quot;. She originated the role of Judy Steinberg in &quot;It Shoulda Been You&quot;, at the George Street Playhouse, New Brunswick, New Jersey, which ran from October 4 to November 6, 2011. The musical ran on Broadway in 2015. 

She took supporting roles in the independent film &quot;Hello, My Name Is Doris&quot; starring Sally Field, the romantic comedy film &quot;Basmati Blues&quot; (2017) with Brie Larson and played Anne Marie Hoag in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017). She had a minor role in the Coen Brothers anthology Western film &quot;The Ballad of Buster Scruggs&quot; (2018). That same year she had a leading role in the Patrick Wang films &quot;A Bread Factory Part 1 &amp; 2&quot; (2018). In the fall of that year Daly joined the cast of the revival of the &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; series, playing the character of Phyllis, who runs the bar which Murphy and her coworkers often patronize. She also guest starred in &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; in 2019, &quot;Madam Secretary&quot; in 2019, and &quot;Mom&quot; in 2021. In 2024 Daly was set to return to Broadway in a revival of John Patrick Shanley&#x27;s play &quot;&quot; opposite Liev Schreiber; however, she withdrew from the production after being hospitalized.

== Reputation ==
Daly has been identified as a feminist icon in the media, particularly based on her television role in &quot;Cagney and Lacey&quot;. Her role as Lacey showed a woman detective at a time where the idea was still novel; the show was also novel in presenting Lacey primarily in a work environment, rather than always showing the character at home. She has also been outspoken about maintaining a natural appearance as she ages, and for the run of &quot;Judging Amy&quot;, Daly&#x27;s hair was its naturally gray state and not dyed.

==Personal life==
Tyne Daly was married to Georg Stanford Brown from 1966 to 1990. They have three daughters.

<text>Thomas Mokopu Mofolo (22 December 1876 – 8 September 1948) is often regarded as the first African novelist. His body of work, which consists of three books composed between 1905 and 1910, were first written in Sesotho, and then widely translated. 

He is best known for his third book, Chaka, a fictional retelling of the story of the rise and fall of the Zulu emperor-king Shaka. 

== Life ==
While Thomas Mofolo&#x27;s work has been widely examined, his life story has been largely overlooked and no complete biography has been published. What is known stems from a short autobiographical sketch that appeared in 1930, the work of Daniel Kunene in the 1980s, and more recent archival research by the curator of Morija Museum and Archives.

The third child of Abner and Aleta Mofolo, Thomas Mofolo was born in Ha Khojane, a village in the Mafeteng District of the British colony of Basutoland. 

His family were members of the Protestant church and remained loyal to the Cape Colony forces during the Basuto Gun War, which led them to flee their home and settle in Mafeteng. Having spent his early year herding the family&#x27;s cattle, Mofolo began his education at the age of 10 or 12 under the guidance of Everitt Lechesa Segoete at Qomoqomong. Segoete was a great influence and would go on to be published himself. A polyglot, Mofolo learned isiXhosa and English during these years, while speaking Sesotho and Dutch with his family.

Mofolo continued his education, first at Masitise and then in 1894 at Morija where he attended Bible School. In 1896, he moved again to Thabeng for teacher training. Between 1896 and 1898 rinderpest killed 95% of cattle in the region, and Mofolo&#x27;s family could no longer pay his school fees. By 1898, at the age of 22, Mofolo was able to complete his studies and gained employment at the Morija Sesuto Book Depot, which acted as the centre of publishing in Basutoland.

His time at the Book Depot was cut short by the Anglo-Boer War, which led to shortages of paper and other materials. Mofolo returned to education, this time to Leloaleng Industrial School, where he learned carpentry, before becoming a teacher at Maseru.

In 1904 Mofolo returned to the Morija Sesuto Book Depot, and that year married Francina Matšeliso Shoarane, who had been educated in the Cape Colony. The previous year, Francina had published a short letter, which was very uncommon for a woman at that time. Their first child was born in 1908. During the next few years, Mofolo read widely and developed his own interest in writing literature. He also became politically active, becoming in 1907 a founding member of the &quot;Lekhotla la Tsoelo-pele&quot; (English: &quot;Basutoland Progressives Association&quot;).

Mofolo fled Morija in 1910 following an adulterous relationship, and moved to Johannesburg to work as a labour recruiter. He returned to Basutoland in 1912, continuing his work as a labour agent for a mining group as well as his own private ventures. Francina died on 20 September 1915, and Thomas married his second wife, Josefina, in 1918. She died on 27 October 1927, and he married for a third time in 1933. He remained married to his third wife, Emma, until his death.

Thomas&#x27; business ventures continued through the 1920s and 1930s, leading to the purchase of a farm in 1933 over the border in the Union of South Africa. However, the sale was in violation of the Natives Land Act, leaving Mofolo to bear all the costs. This led to financial ruin. In 1941, he suffered a stroke from which he never fully recovered, and in 1948 he died in poverty, aged 71, in Teyateyaneng.

== Works ==
Mofolo published three books during his lifetime. His career as a writer, like much of his education, was shaped by the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society. His first two works were initially serialised in &quot;Leselinyana&quot;, a missionary newspaper, before they published them in book form. Mofolo&#x27;s third, &quot;Chaka&quot;, was suppressed and publication was delayed by around 15 years due to the reluctance of the missionary press to release the work.

Mofolo also produced another manuscript, &quot;The Fallen Angel&quot;, in around 1908. This was met with disapproval from the missionaries, was never published, and is now lost. Little is known of it, other than a passing reference in a contemporary missionary account that notes it set out to disprove an unspecified theory of Marie Corelli.

His three published novels have all been translated into English and other languages, often with misconceptions and misunderstandings on the part of the translators.

=== &quot;Moeti oa bochabela&quot; ===
&quot;Moeti oa bochabela&quot; is widely accepted as the first novel published in an African language. It was first serialised in &quot;Leselinyana&quot; beginning on 1 January 1907 before appearing as a book later that year. In 1934, an English-language translation, &quot;Traveller to the East&quot;, by Hugh Ashton (wrongly attributed as Harry Ashton in later editions) was published.

While now considered a pioneer African novel, it was conceived as an allegory or fable and often seen to borrow heavily from Bunyan&#x27;s Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress. More recently, the place of &quot;lithoko&quot; praise poems and the influence of other Sesotho writers whose work appeared in &quot;Leselinyana&quot;, such as Daniele Methusala, have been highlighted. Set in precolonial Lesotho, the English translation sees the protagonist, Fekisi, view society being overtaken by evil, with the only solution to turn towards Christianity. Elsewhere, it is seen as a merging of Sotho beliefs and Christian thoughts.
=== &quot;Pitseng&quot; ===
Like &quot;Moeti oa bochabela&quot;, &quot;Pitseng&quot; was also serialised in &quot;Leselinyana&quot; before appearing as a book in 1910. An English translation did not appear until 2013. 

A novel about love and marriage, as well as the natural environment, &quot;Pitseng&quot; is set in a village in Lesotho at the beginning of the twentieth century. While vividly describing the natural world, the novel is a love story between a school teacher and a local girl. It has been interpreted as an indictment of the hypocrisy of European Christianity.
=== &quot;Chaka&quot; ===
Thomas Mofolo achieved much wider reach with his third and final novel. By 1962 at least 40,000 of the Sesotho original had been printed, with translations appearing in English, French, German, Italian and Afrikaans. It was ranked among the top twelve of &#x27;African&#x27;s 100 Best Books on the Twentieth Century&#x27; in 2002. 

&quot;Chaka&quot; is an historical novel that fictionalises the life of Shaka and the period of the &quot;difaqane&quot;. It has been widely studied and interpreted in various ways. 

== Recognition ==
The library at the National University of Lesotho is named the Thomas Mofolo Library in his honour.
In 1976, Nadine Gordimer created the Mofolo-Plomer Prize in honour of Thomas Mofolo and William Plomer. More recently, the Thomas Mofolo Prize for Outstanding Sesotho Fiction was launched in 2019.
