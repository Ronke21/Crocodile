<text>The Schizophora are a section of true flies containing 78 families, which are collectively referred to as muscoids, although technically the term &quot;muscoid&quot; should be limited to flies in the superfamily Muscoidea; this is an example of informal, historical usage persisting in the vernacular. The section is divided into two subsections, the Acalyptratae and Calyptratae, which are commonly referred to as acalyptrate muscoids and calyptrate muscoids, respectively.

The defining feature of the Schizophora is the presence of a special structure used to help the emerging adult fly break free of the puparium; this structure is an inflatable membranous sac called the ptilinum that protrudes from the face, above the antennae. The inflation of the ptilinum (using fluid hemolymph rather than air) creates pressure along the line of weakness in the puparium, which then bursts open along the seam to allow the adult to escape. When the adult emerges, the fluid is withdrawn, the ptilinum collapses, and the membrane retracts entirely back inside the head. The large, inverted, U-shaped suture in the face through which it came, however, is still quite visible, and the name &quot;Schizophora&quot; (&quot;split-bearers&quot;) is derived from this ptilinal or frontal suture. The term was first used by Eduard Becher.

In contrast to eggs of other arthropods, most insect eggs are drought-resistant, because inside the maternal chorion, two additional membranes develop from embryonic tissue, the amnion and the serosa. This serosa secretes a cuticle rich in chitin that protects the embryo against desiccation. In the Schizophora, however, the serosa does not develop, but these flies lay their eggs in damp places, such as rotting organic matter.

The absence of schizophoran flies from Cretaceous rocks implies that they likely rapidly diversified during the Cenozoic, with the first appearance of the group during the early Paleogene, around 53 million years ago, with it being estimated that they split off from other flies around 66-65 million years ago.

<doc id="643415" wikidata="Q2485885" url="?curid=643415" title="New York State Route 5">
<text>New York State Route 5 (NY 5) is a state highway that extends for across the state of New York in the United States. It begins at the Pennsylvania state line in the Chautauqua County town of Ripley and passes through Buffalo, Syracuse, Utica, Schenectady, and several other smaller cities and communities on its way to downtown Albany in Albany County, where it terminates at U.S. Route 9 (US 9), here routed along the service roads for Interstate 787 (I-787). Prior to the construction of the New York State Thruway, it was one of two main east–west highways traversing upstate New York, the other being US 20. West of New York, the road continues as Pennsylvania Route 5 (PA 5) to Erie.

NY 5 overlaps with US 20 twice along its routing. The second, a overlap through western and central New York, is the second-longest concurrency in the state, stretching from Avon in Livingston County east to the city of Auburn in Cayuga County. The concurrency is known locally as &quot;Routes 5 and 20&quot;. As the route proceeds across the state, it also directly or indirectly meets every major north–south highway in upstate New York, including all three north–south Interstate Highways (I-390 in Avon, I-81 in Syracuse via US 11, and I-87 in Albany).

NY 5 was assigned in 1924 as a true cross-state highway, extending from the Pennsylvania state line in the west to the Massachusetts state line in the east, mostly by way of modern US 20. At the time, modern NY 5 between Buffalo and Albany was designated as New York State Route 5A. By 1926, NY 5 was moved onto the routing of NY 5A while the old routing of NY 5 became NY 7. It was truncated in 1927 to Athol Springs in the west and Albany in the east following the assignment of US 20, and again in 1930 to downtown Buffalo. NY 5 was reextended to the Pennsylvania state line by way of its old routing to Athol Springs, an old alignment of US 20, and a lakeside spur route of US 20 that had been assigned in 1930. Only local realignments have occurred since.

==Route description==
Although it is no longer commonly used for long-distance travel, NY 5 is still regionally important. NY 5 is named Main Street in Buffalo, Erie Boulevard and West Genesee Street in Syracuse, State Street in Schenectady, and Central Avenue in Albany, the state capital. It is a major local road in many other locations along its path. NY 5 runs concurrent to US 20 twice between its endpoints: for three miles (5  km) between Silver Creek and Irving and for across western and central New York. At 67.6 miles (108 km) in length, the eastern overlap between US 20 and NY 5 is the second-longest surface-road concurrency in New York state, behind only the concurrency of I-86 and NY 17 in the Southern Tier.
Maintenance of the majority of NY 5&#x27;s is performed by the New York State Department of Transportation. However, locally owned and maintained sections exist in six cities. The city-maintained sections of NY 5 are in Buffalo from NY 16 north to the city line (except of the Goodell Street portion, which is state-maintained); in Syracuse between the western city line and just west of NY 635; in Utica from Leland Avenue east to the city line; in Amsterdam between Division and West Main streets; in Schenectady from Washington Avenue to the eastern city line; and the entirety of NY 5 within Albany.

===Pennsylvania to Buffalo===
At the New York–Pennsylvania border in Ripley, PA 5 becomes NY 5 upon entering New York. It very closely follows the shore of Lake Erie through all of Chautauqua County. Once reaching the village of Silver Creek it briefly overlaps US 20 until entering Erie County at the Cattaraugus Reservation and NY 438 where the roads once again split. Once in Erie County, it pulls slightly inward from the lake shore from Brant to the hamlet of Wanakah. Once past Wanakah, the road once again closely borders the lake shore and goes through steadily more heavily developed areas, particularly the Ford Stamping Plant and the Bethlehem Steel plant in the city of Lackawanna. There the road becomes the Hamburg Turnpike and eight wind-powered turbines, which provide power to the national grid, are visible. Near the northern edge of the city, NY 5 begins to ascend onto an elevated roadway as it connects to Ridge Road and the Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens by way of an interchange. Here, the route becomes the a limited-access highway with exits for Ohio and Tifft streets and Fuhrmann Boulevard. After a quarter-mile, NY 5 passes seamlessly into the city of Buffalo.
A short distance past the city line, NY 5 passes over the Union Ship Canal on a span of the elevated road known as the Father Baker Bridge. North of the waterway, the elevated section of NY 5 gains a frontage road named Fuhrmann Boulevard. Both the service road and NY 5 run parallel to Lake Erie until the northern end of the Buffalo Outer Harbor. Here, the frontage roads end while NY 5 turns to the northeast, crossing the Buffalo River on the bridge called The Skyway, and entering downtown. On the north bank, the Skyway returns to a northerly routing as it passes KeyBank Center, located directly to the east, and Buffalo and Erie County Naval &amp; Military Park, situated to the west, and meets I-190 at exit 7. Past the interchange, the Skyway ends and the route descends in elevation, becoming an at-grade roadway once more at Church Street in the shadow of Buffalo City Hall. NY 384 begins here, following Delaware Avenue north into the heart of downtown, while NY 5 turns east onto Church.

At Main Street, Church Street splits into a pair of one-way streets and becomes North and South Division Street. The route follows South Division eastward for two blocks to an intersection with Ellicott Street located one block north of Sahlen Field. At the junction, which includes the northern terminus of NY 16, NY 5 turns northward, rejoining NY 5 westbound one block later at North Division. The route continues on Ellicott for nine blocks to the unidirectional East Tupper Street, where NY 5 westbound separates from the route once more. NY 5 eastbound, however, continues north on Ellicott for an additional block to the one-way Goodell Street. NY 5 heads west on Goodell for two blocks before turning north onto Main Street, rejoining NY 5 westbound at the intersection.
The route continues along Main Street throughout the remainder of its length in Buffalo, cutting through the city diagonally from southwest to northeast until it enters the town of Amherst at the intersection of Bailey Avenue (US 62) at the south campus of the University at Buffalo.

===Buffalo to Avon===
Once leaving the city of Buffalo, NY 5 heads east through the densely populated suburban town of Amherst, including the hamlets of Snyder and Eggertsville and the village of Williamsville and is heavily developed through the entire length of the town, particularly at the intersection with Transit Road (NY 78). In the town of Clarence, the road dips into a significant depression known as Clarence Hollow. Once leaving Clarence, NY 5 goes through predominantly rural areas until reaching the city of Batavia in Genesee County, closely paralleling the New York State Thruway through much of the county. The road travels eastward until reaching Livingston County and the village of Caledonia.

NY 5 heads southeast from the village of Caledonia, paralleling the former right-of-way of an Erie–Lackawanna Railroad branch line that connected the villages of Caledonia and Avon as it heads through spacious fields containing little more than farmland. At a rural intersection controlled by single-head flashing traffic signals west of Avon, NY 5 meets US 20 for the second time. The routes embark on a second concurrency, merging onto the right-of-way of NY 5 as they cross the Genesee River and enter both the town and village of Avon.

===Avon to Ontario County===
US 20 and NY 5 become West Main Street upon entering the village, underscoring the road&#x27;s status as the primary east–west highway through the town. The route continues southeast from the Genesee, passing through the forested but sparsely populated western area of the village. As the route approaches the Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad (LAL) grade crossing, the number of homes increases rapidly, only to be replaced by businesses in the area surrounding the LAL mainline. Located on the western edge of this transition is NY 39, which terminates at this junction. Past the tracks, West Main intersects Rochester Street, a locally important north–south two-lane arterial that continues north of the village to the Rochester suburb of Brighton as East River Road. Shortly after this intersection, the homes return, following US 20 and NY 5 as West Main enters the heart of the village.
In the centre of Avon, West Main feeds into Park Place, a large traffic circle providing access to two local streets from US 20 and NY 5. The routes follow the circle counterclockwise, departing the roundabout on East Main Street. The street proceeds east, passing through four blocks of densely populated neighbourhoods before exiting the village and abruptly entering vast, barren fields to the east. US 20 and NY 5, now named Avon–Lima Road, intersects NY 15 two miles (3 km) to the east in East Avon, a community based around the intersection and the streets comprising it, and connects to I-390 at exit 10 a half-mile from NY 15. Continuing, the road intersects several county routes over the next four miles (6  km) before becoming West Main Street once more, this time for the village of Lima. At an intersection with NY 15A in the village centre, US 20 and NY 5 become East Main Street, retaining the name to the Ontario County line at Honeoye Creek.

===Western Ontario County===
In the town of West Bloomfield, US 20 and NY 5 go unnamed as they proceed eastward. Roughly one mile from the county line in the hamlet of West Bloomfield, US 20 and NY 5 meet the southern terminus of NY 65. Exiting the hamlet, US 20 and NY 5 head through another area dominated by open land, intersecting Elton Road before passing seamlessly into East Bloomfield. A mile and a half from the town line, US 20 and NY 5 intersect NY 64, a road running northwest–southeast from the Monroe County line south to US 20 and NY 5. NY 64, whose right-of-way ends at US 20 and NY 5 at the foot of a small hill, joins the two routes eastward on a triple overlap, entering the village of Bloomfield and intersecting the southern terminus of NY 444 south of the portion of Bloomfield once known as Holcomb. Near the junction with NY 444, US 20, NY 5 and NY 64 take-ups on a due east alignment, absorbing the routing used by Gauss Road west of this point.
A mile to the east at Whalen Road, NY 64 separates from US 20 and NY 5, following the road, and US 20A, which has its eastern terminus at this intersection, south toward Bristol. US 20 and NY 5 continue through rural Ontario County before splitting from its easterly alignment at an intersection four miles (6  km) east of US 20A and NY 64 in the town of Canandaigua. West Avenue, the former routing of US 20 and NY 5 into downtown Canandaigua, continues east from the junction while US 20 and NY 5 turn south onto a bypass around Canandaigua.

====Canandaigua area====
Half a mile from the start of the bypass and a short distance before the arterial makes a turn eastward to traverse Canandaigua Lake to the southeast, US 20 and NY 5 meets NY 21 at a four-way intersection. Like US 20 and NY 5, NY 21 once continued directly into downtown, in this instance via Bristol Street to the east of the junction, but now follows US 20 and NY 5 along the east–west leg of the bypass. Past Bristol Street, the bypass widens from two to four lanes and, after meeting two local streets, enters the city of Canandaigua as the limited-access Western Boulevard, albeit with no exits. The route loses this distinction before intersecting South Main Street, where US 20, NY 5 and NY 21 meet the southern terminus of NY 332. NY 21 departs the bypass, following NY 332 into downtown, while US 20 and NY 5 continue onto the four-lane, median separated Eastern Boulevard, the original section of the US 20 and NY 5 bypasses of Canandaigua. The roadway acts a centre of commerce for the city, sporting restaurants, hotels, and supermarkets along its length within the city limits.

Upon exiting the city, the establishments become a pair of shopping plazas centred around the intersection with the northern terminus of NY 364. Across the town line in Hopewell a quarter-mile to the east, a third plaza, anchored by Runnings, formerly a Walmart, dominates the northeast corner of CR 10 and Eastern Boulevard. On the adjacent parcel is another plaza containing the current Walmart. At the entrance to the second plaza, US 20 and NY 5 intersect Lakeshore Drive, the former routing of US 20 and NY 5 to the south of the bypass. Past the junction, the divided highway comes to an end and, after another half-mile, narrows to two lanes.

===Canandaigua to Auburn===
Deeper into Hopewell, the area surrounding US 20 and NY 5 become rural once more. Roughly from the end of the bypass, US 20 and NY 5 meet NY 247. After of eastward progression through open land, the routes meet the northern terminus of both NY 14A and NY 245, concurrent at this location, in the town of Geneva. A half-mile past NY 14A and NY 245, US 20 and NY 5 enter the city of Geneva and widens into a four-lane road. In the city, US 20 and NY 5 intersect NY 14 by way of a pseudo-interchange on the bank of Seneca Lake. US 20 and NY 5 turns into a divided highway again at this point. At the interchange, NY 14 Truck joins US 20 and NY 5, bypassing a sharp turn on NY 14 downtown. US 20 and NY 5 continues as a divided highway around the northern tip of Seneca Lake, crossing the Preemption Line and entering Seneca County at its midpoint. A mile to the east in East Geneva, just east of a railroad underpass, US 20 and NY 5 meet the northern terminus of NY 96A at a former trumpet interchange that has been converted to an intersection with a traffic signal.
From NY 96A east to the village of Waterloo, a distance of roughly four miles, US 20 and NY 5 become a two-lane road and run parallel to the Cayuga–Seneca Canal. In Waterloo, the concurrency meets NY 96 in the village centre. East of the village, the distance between the canal and the roadway decreases, making US 20 and NY 5 the closest road to the water for the next one and a half miles to NY 414 in the town of Seneca Falls. NY 414 joins US 20 and NY 5, overlapping the road for into the hamlet of Seneca Falls. At Cayuga Street, NY 414 turns south, crossing the water body that is the canal and the Seneca River and becoming Ovid Street while US 20 and NY 5 turn north onto Cayuga, following the street around the small Van Cleef Lake, through the Finger Lakes Railway grade crossing, and exiting the hamlet. Three miles from NY 414, just west of Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge, US 20 and NY 5 meet NY 318 and NY 89 at intersections just apart. The intersection with NY 89 has a traffic signal.

About three miles (5 km) later, after entering Cayuga County over the Seneca River/Cayuga and Seneca Canal, just north of Cayuga Lake, the two routes meet NY 90 in the town of Aurelius, at a traffic signal. A few miles east of that intersection, the highway meets the Finger Lakes Railway again but crosses it via an overpass. The routes continue eastward through Aurelius to the city of Auburn where it turns into a divided four-lane highway again. On the western edge of the city, just after passing Finger Lakes Mall, US 20 and NY 5 meet the eastern terminus of NY 326, which is also a four-lane divided highway for a short stretch. In downtown Auburn, US 20 and NY 5&#x27;s east and west lanes split apart from each other for a short distance as an arterial over the alignments of Clark Street, Franklin Street, and Grant Avenue. The arterial runs concurrent with NY 38 for . NY 38 then splits from the concurrency and joins NY 34. A quarter-mile to the east, US 20 separates from NY 5 at the northern terminus of NY 38A. NY 5 continues after the split as the four-lane Grant Avenue passing by a high number of shopping areas.

===Auburn to Syracuse===
From NY 174 in Camillus to Fairmount, NY 5 is a limited-access highway traversing the western suburbs of Syracuse. At one time, the highway was to be extended to West Street in Syracuse, via the current Grand Avenue. The freeway has partial access to NY 173 from westbound NY 5. East of NY 173, the freeway connects to NY 695 at a directional T interchange and passes over NY 297 without access. East of Fairmount, NY 5 alters to the south before turning east onto West Genesee Street and converting to grade-level intersections.

In Syracuse, NY 5 is parallel to I-690 for much of its routing but never encounters the highway, thus making the north–south streets that intersect NY 5 entry points to and from I-690. In downtown Syracuse, West Genesee Street becomes James Street. At the southern tip of the interchange between I-690 and I-81, NY 5 transfers onto Erie Boulevard and intersects State Street (US 11), but passes under I-81 without access. From the downtown area to DeWitt, NY 5 is divided. At the Syracuse–DeWitt boundary, NY 5 intersects NY 635 and eastward, it curves to a southeast course. Near the former Shoppingtown Mall, NY 5 turns east onto Genesee Street to begin an overlap with NY 92. Less than a mile east of the mall, NY 5 and NY 92 intersect I-481 at a cloverleaf interchange.
===Syracuse to Utica===
NY 5 and NY 92 remain concurrent up to Highbridge Road, where NY 92 splits from NY 5 and heads southeast to Manlius. The segment of the overlap with NY 92 between I-481 and the eastern split is the busiest area of NY 5 in the Syracuse area and in all of Onondaga County. Past the split, NY 5 continues east through Onondaga and Madison counties, passing Fayetteville, Chittenango, and Canastota before entering the vicinity of Oneida. West of the city, NY 5 intersects NY 365A, a spur route of NY 365 leading directly into downtown. To the east, NY 5 (which forms the southern boundary of the city) meets NY 46 before crossing over Oneida Creek and into Oneida County.

Just past the county line in Oneida Castle, NY 5 intersects NY 365, a route leading northward to the New York State Thruway in Verona. NY 5 presses on, passing through the city of Sherrill and the village of Vernon (briefly overlapping NY 31) and the town of Westmoreland to the town of Kirkland, where NY 5 intersects NY 233, crosses over Oriskany Creek, and meets the western terminus of NY 5B. The spur of NY 5 later rejoins its parent yards from where NY 5A departs NY 5 to serve western Utica. NY 5 itself continues eastward through New Hartford, meeting NY 12B before merging with NY 12 at Genesee Street. Both routes continue eastward across the Sauquoit Creek into Utica.

===Utica to Albany===

NY 5 enters the city of Utica on a concurrency with NY 12 heading in a northeast direction. It shortly picks up NY 8, and all three cross the city together. NY 5 also intersects with the terminus of NY 840 at this point. Just south of the New York State Thruway, I-790 begins as a short expressway, also including NY 5, NY 8, and NY 12. After crossing out of the city, they meet the Thruway, with NY 8 and 12 continuing northeast, while I-790 and NY 5 turns to the east-south-east, picking up the tail-end of NY 49. These three, still as an expressway, straddle each side of the Thruway for a short way, with I-790 technically ending at the ramps for I-90. NY 5 continues to the end of the expressway, only a few hundred feet later, dropping to Leland Avenue. A few hundred feet to the north of the Thruway, NY 5 turns eastward again to continue down Herkimer Road. It closely parallels the Thruway to Herkimer, where NY 5 moves slightly northward through the centre of the village, becoming State Street, while I-90 crosses the Erie Canal and goes south for a short distance. There is a short concurrency with NY 28 in the village.

After exiting Herkimer, NY 5 continues east, closely paralleling this time the canal, through the city of Little Falls as Main Street, where two more concurrencies occur, with NY 167 and NY 169. NY 5 continues to parallel the canal, and in some instances again, the Thruway, through Amsterdam, becoming Amsterdam Road all the way to Scotia, where it crosses the canal into Schenectady as Mohawk Avenue, turning into State Street upon entering the city limits. It continues fairly straight on a southeast course into Albany as Central Avenue until it reaches Townsend Park. At this point, NY 5 turns into Washington Avenue and all signage referring to NY 5 ceases. The New York State Department of Transportation recognizes the route, however, as it continues down Washington Ave past the New York State Capitol building, turning south for a short distance as Eagle Street. NY 5 then continues east on State Street to Broadway, where it again turns south-east shortly before returning east on a small spur of Broadway, travelling underneath US 9 and I-787. NY 5 ends at the Hudson River.

==History==

===Early roads===
Soon after the end of the American Revolution in 1783, a surge of westward migration into Central and Western New York began. At the time, most travel west of the Albany area was by water. While rudimentary roads were laid out following the Mohawk River, there were no major land routes west of Fort Schuyler (present-day Utica), except for an old east–west Iroquois trail that was a simple footpath. By the late 1780s, many companies began to set up their operations in the new settlements in the Central and Western New York. As a result, there was a clamour for the building of the main road running west from Utica.
On March 22, 1794, the New York State Legislature passed a law calling for the laying out and improvement of a public road from old Fort Schuyler on the Mohawk River to the settlement of Canawaugus on the Genesee River, in as straight a line as the topography of the land would allow. This road was officially known as the &quot;Great Genesee Road&quot; and is one of the earliest state roads in New York, intended to provide access to the New Military Tract. As planned, it generally followed the old Iroquois trail through Oneida, Manlius, Onondaga Valley (south of modern Syracuse), Skaneateles, Auburn, Seneca Falls, Geneva, and Canandaigua before ending at the Genesee River. Four years later, another legislative act authorized the extension of the Genesee Road to Buffalo.

By the end of the 18th century, while the Genesee Road had been greatly improved and saw heavy traffic, many portions were still substandard and some sections had still not been completed. Partly because of this, and also because of the success of the Lancaster Turnpike in Pennsylvania, the state outsourced the task of improving and maintaining the Genesee Road to a private company. On April 1, 1800, the Seneca Road Company was chartered for this purpose and the portion of the Genesee Road from Utica to Canandaigua was improved and operated as a toll road known as the Seneca Turnpike, which was long and, at the time, the longest turnpike in the state. Three days later, the old road following the Mohawk River between Utica and Schenectady also became a turnpike, known as the Mohawk Turnpike.

With the road leading from Albany northwest to Schenectady having been already established as a turnpike (the Albany and Schenectady Turnpike) in 1797, an all-turnpike route over good quality roads was now available from Albany to Canandaigua. The western extension of the Genesee Road to Buffalo soon followed suit and also became an improved Macadam toll road, the Ontario and Genesee Turnpike, in 1805. The Seneca Road Company was authorized to create a more northerly alternate route of the Seneca Turnpike in 1806. This branch left the original turnpike east of Seneca Falls and crossed more level terrain through Elbridge, Geddes, and Fayetteville before rejoining the old path at Chittenango. As the city of Syracuse developed, traffic patterns changed and the northern branch route became more heavily used than the original road.

The construction and opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 along the same alignment as the Albany to Buffalo route began to eat away at the revenues of these turnpike companies. In time, the turnpike business had become unprofitable and the companies were dissolved by 1852, causing the roads to revert to public control. The Seneca Road Company dissolved in 1852. The old, southern path of the Seneca Turnpike is now Franklin Street and Old Seneca Turnpike from Auburn to Marcellus, NY 175 between Marcellus and Onondaga Hill, and NY 173 from there east to Chittenango.

===Designation===
The improvement of the road from Buffalo southwest to Pennsylvania in the mid-19th century soon allowed for continuous travel across the entire state of New York. With the advent of the automobile, the state began to take over and pave major thoroughfares at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1908, the state legislature created a statewide system of unsigned legislative routes. One of the routes assigned at this time was Route 6, an Albany–Buffalo highway that followed the path of the Genesee Road and the Seneca Turnpike from Buffalo to Utica, the Mohawk Turnpike between Utica and Schenectady, and the Albany and Schenectady Turnpike from Schenectady to Albany. From Auburn to Chittenango, Route 6 utilized most of the newer, northern branch of the Seneca Turnpike.
The automobile allowed people to quickly travel long distances and a way to mark routes became needed. One early means of marking routes was the establishment of various auto trail associations in the 1910s. These associations selected good quality roads and marked them with symbols or colors on telephone poles. Most of legislative Route 6 eventually became part of the Yellowstone Trail, a cross-country auto trail established in 1912 that ran from Washington to Massachusetts. In New York, the trail used modern US 20 from Pennsylvania to Silver Creek, most of modern NY 5 from Silver Creek to Albany, and modern US 20 again from Albany to Massachusetts.

In 1924, following what other states did, New York began to assign route numbers to its main thoroughfares. The Albany to Buffalo portion of the Yellowstone Trail, which ran through the cities of Syracuse and Utica, was assigned the number NY 5A. The portion of the Yellowstone Trail southwest of Buffalo and east of Albany became part of NY 5, which bypassed Syracuse and Utica to the south. The Buffalo to Albany portion of NY 5&#x27;s original alignment used a new road, Broadway Road, from Buffalo to Avon and the old Cherry Valley Turnpike alignment from Skaneateles to Albany. In between Avon and Skaneateles, NY 5 and NY 5A overlapped.

By 1926, however, the Buffalo to Albany section of NY 5 was relocated onto the Genesee Road alignment, replacing NY 5A. NY 5&#x27;s former, more southerly alignment was redesignated as NY 7. In 1927, the establishment of the U.S. Highway System created more numbering changes. US 20, which mainly followed the Yellowstone Trail elsewhere in the country, was designated in New York along NY 5 southwest of Hamburg and east of Albany and along old NY 7 from Skaneateles to Albany. Between the towns of Hamburg and Avon, the new US 20 used an even more southerly alignment, running via East Aurora and Warsaw. This truncated both ends of NY 5 to Athol Springs (south of Buffalo in the town of Hamburg) in the west, and to Albany in the east.

In the 1930 state highway renumbering, NY 5 was truncated even further to begin in downtown Buffalo. The portion between Buffalo and Athol Springs was assigned as part of NY 62. Southwest of Buffalo, Southwestern Boulevard, an alternate route of US 20 between Irving and Big Tree (east of Athol Springs) became NY 20B. Further southwest, another alternate route of US 20 between the Pennsylvania line and Silver Creek, running along the shore of Lake Erie, was designated as NY 20A. The NY 20A and NY 20B designations proved to be short-lived. US 62 was extended into New York , causing NY 62 to be renumbered. Around the same time, US 20 was realigned to follow NY 20B from Irving to Big Tree. NY 5 was extended along part of old NY 62 to Athol Springs, from where it continued to the Pennsylvania state line by way of US 20&#x27;s old routing to Irving and all of NY 20A.

===Expressway relocations===
Originally, NY 5 entered Buffalo from the south on Fuhrmann Boulevard and Michigan Avenue and followed South Park Avenue and Main Street through the city before rejoining its modern alignment at Goodell Street. In the mid-1950s, a new limited-access highway was constructed along Fuhrmann Boulevard from Lackawanna to the Buffalo River. At the river, the new roadway broke from Fuhrmann and continued directly into downtown, returning to grade level two blocks south of Niagara Square. The expressway, known as the Buffalo Skyway, became part of a rerouted NY 5 by 1956. Visually, the Skyway cuts off the city from the Buffalo inner harbor. In 2008 there was momentum to tear it down, but the momentum passed. In 2019 a plan to remove part of the Skyway and close the rest to motorized traffic was proposed as part of a competition. This plan has drawn strong opinions both for and against the removal.
Farther east in Utica, construction began in the early 1950s on a new arterial highway—known as the North–South Arterial—through the city center. The new roadway bypassed NY 5, which was initially routed on Genesee Street and Herkimer Road through Utica. The first portion of the highway to open was the segment north of River Road, which was completed by 1956. It was extended southward to Oriskany Street (NY 5A) by 1961 and completed entirely by 1964, at which time it became part of a rerouted NY 5 and NY 12. Two portions of Genesee Street, from NY 12 in New Hartford to the Utica city line and from NY 5S to Herkimer Road in Utica, remain state maintained to this day as unsigned NY 921E and NY 921C, respectively.

In the Syracuse suburbs of Camillus and Geddes, NY 5 was initially routed on West Genesee Street between the villages of Camillus and Solvay. Construction on a bypass of this segment of NY 5 began in the early 1970s and was completed between NY 695 and Genesee Street by 1977. By the following year, the freeway was open to traffic up to Hinsdale Road; however, NY 5 remained on Genesee Street between Hinsdale and the Solvay village limits. The remainder of the Camillus Bypass was completed , at which time NY 5 was realigned to follow the freeway. Genesee Street is now largely maintained by Onondaga County as CR 98; however, two portions of the street remain state maintained. Near the western end of the expressway, the former routing of NY 5 became part of an extended NY 174. Between the Camillus town line and the eastern end of the bypass, Genesee Street is unsigned NY 930W. This particular expressway was meant to link Downtown Syracuse to Auburn, but was never completed past Camillus or Fairmount. Several incomplete ramps mark both ends of this expressway section.
Smaller realignments also took place in other cities along the route. In Canandaigua, NY 5 originally entered the city on West Avenue and followed South Main Street and Lakeshore Drive through the city limits before rejoining its current routing in Hopewell. In the mid-1950s, a new bypass was built north of Lakeshore Drive from South Main Street to Hopewell. It became part of a realigned NY 5 by 1956. The remainder of the bypass around the southwestern extents of the city was built in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The former routing of NY 5 on South Main Street remains state maintained as NY 942T; until 1996, the portion of West Avenue between the west end of the bypass and the Canandaigua city line was maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) as NY 942W. Even though maintenance of the road had been transferred to the town of Canandaigua in 1996, the designation remained in NYSDOT documents until 2007.

In Geneva, NY 5 was initially routed on East North Street and Border City Road, overlapping NY 14 through the city and rejoining its modern routing in East Geneva. The overlap was eliminated when NY 5 was moved onto a new roadway located along the edge of Seneca Lake. NY 5 was realigned again in the 1960s to use a new divided highway built midway between the lake shore road and Border City Road. Border City Road is now maintained by Seneca County as CR 110.

In April 2014 work began on a $68.3 million project to replace the viaduct over Columbia Street, Lafayette Streets, and Oriskany Boulevard (NY 5A and NY 5S) in Utica. The nearly one mile stretch had signalized at-grade intersections that had been causing safety concerns and some fatalities. In addition to the replacement of the viaduct, the alignment of the arterial was straightened, a new single point urban interchange was built at Court Street, and a pedestrian bridge was built across the roadway. The pedestrian bridge was opened by December 2014, and the remainder of the project was completed by October 2017.

==Major intersections==














































==Suffixed routes==
NY 5 has three suffixed routes, all located in Oneida County, with NY 5S extending eastward into three other counties. The NY 5A designation was also used in the past for two other routes.

===NY 5A===
*The NY 5A designation has been used for three distinct highways:
**The first NY 5A was a short-lived designation for the portion of modern NY 5 east of Buffalo. When it existed from 1924 to the mid-1920s, NY 5 was routed on what is now US 20.
**The second NY 5A was a northerly alternate route of NY 5 between Aurelius and Sennett in Cayuga County. It was assigned and renumbered to NY 135 . That route was removed . Its former routing is now maintained by Cayuga County as CR 10A, CR 10B, and CR 10C.
The current NY 5A is a short alternate route of NY 5 between New Hartford and downtown Utica in Oneida County. It was assigned in the mid-1930s. At its eastern end, NY 5A becomes NY 5S at an interchange with Interstate 790 (I-790), NY 5, NY 8, and NY 12. The route is four lanes wide and passes through mostly commercial areas and connects NY 5 to NY 840 and NY 69.

===NY 5B===
NY 5B is a alternate route southwest of Utica in Oneida County, connecting NY 5 to NY 12B. The route was assigned in April 1935.



===NY 5S===
*NY 5S () is an alternate route of NY 5 on the south side of the Mohawk River between Utica, Oneida County, and Rotterdam, Schenectady County. The route parallels NY 5 (which follows the north side of the river) and is partially a limited-access highway. It was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.

<text>The Acalyptratae or Acalyptrata are a subsection of the Schizophora, which are a section of the order Diptera, the &quot;true flies&quot;. In various contexts the Acalyptratae also are referred to informally as the [[Schizophora|acalyptrate muscoids]], or acalyptrates, as opposed to the Calyptratae. All forms of the name refer to the lack of calypters in the members of this subsection of flies. An alternative name, Acalypterae is current, though in minority usage. It was first used by Pierre-Justin-Marie Macquart in 1835 for a section of his tribe Muscides; he used it to refer to all acalyptrates plus scathophagids and phorids, but excluding Conopidae.

The confusing forms of the names stem from their first usage; &quot;Acalyptratae&quot; and &quot;Acalyptrata&quot; actually are adjectival forms in Neo-Latin. They were coined in the mid 19th century in contexts such as &quot;Muscae Calyptratae and Acalyptratae&quot; and &quot;Diptera Acalyptrata&quot;, and the forms stuck.

The Acalyptratae are a large assemblage, exhibiting very diverse habits, with one notable and perhaps surprising exception: no known acalyptrates are obligate blood-feeders (hematophagous), though blood feeding at various stages of the life history is common throughout other Dipteran sections.

<doc id="643418" wikidata="Q2927489" url="?curid=643418" title="Bud Collyer">
<text>Bud Collyer (born Clayton Johnson Heermance Jr., June 18, 1908 – September 8, 1969) was an American radio actor and announcer and game show host who became one of the nation&#x27;s first major television game show stars. He is best remembered for his work as the first host of the TV game shows &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; and &quot;To Tell the Truth,&quot; but he was also famous in the roles of Clark Kent / Superman on radio and in animated cartoons, initially in theatrical short subjects and later on television.

He also recorded a number of long-playing 33 1/3 R.P.M. record albums for children. Some of these had Bible stories, in keeping with his strong connections with his church and deep spirituality.

== Early life and career ==
Collyer was born in Manhattan to Clayton Johnson Heermance and Caroline Collyer. He originally sought a career in law, attending Williams College, where he was a member of Psi Upsilon fraternity, and Fordham University law school. Although he became a law clerk after his graduation, making as much in a month on radio as he did in a year of clerking convinced him to make broadcasting his career. He changed his surname, and by 1940 he had become a familiar voice on all three major radio networks. 

He held starring or major supporting roles in &quot;The Man I Married&quot; (as Adam Waring); &quot;Kate Hopkins, Angel of Mercy&quot; (as Tom); &quot;Pretty Kitty Kelly&quot; (as Michael Conway); &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; (as Pat Ryan); &quot;Renfrew of the Mounted&quot; (as Renfrew); and &quot;Abie&#x27;s Irish Rose&quot; (as Abie Levy). He also was the announcer for a number of radio soap operas, including &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; and &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;.

== Superman ==

Collyer&#x27;s best-remembered radio starring role began in early 1940 in &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; on the Mutual Broadcasting System, a role he also performed in the subsequent &quot;Superman&quot; cartoons. Collyer supplied the voices of both Superman and his alter ego Clark Kent, opposite radio actress Joan Alexander as Lois Lane. Every Superman episode featured a scene in which Clark Kent changed into his Superman costume, an effect which Collyer conveyed by shifting voices while speaking the phrase &quot;This is (or &quot;looks like&quot;) a job for Superman!&quot; his voice always dropping when becoming Superman. Originally, Clark Kent and Superman were going to be played by two different actors. It was Collyer&#x27;s ability to voice Clark Kent as a tenor and switch to bass to voice Superman that got him the role. It also saved the producers the cost of two actors.

In 1966, Collyer reprised the role in the Filmation animated television series &quot;The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, reunited with Alexander as Lois Lane.

== Game-show hosting ==
Collyer got his first helping of game shows when he co-hosted ABC&#x27;s (the former NBC Blue network) &quot;Break the Bank&quot; with future Miss America Pageant mainstay Bert Parks; and, when he was picked to host the radio original of the Mark Goodson-Bill Todman team&#x27;s first game, &quot;Winner Take All.&quot; Collyer went on to host the television versions of both shows. (&quot;Winner Take All&quot; became, in due course, the first hosting seat for another game show titan, Bill Cullen.)

=== &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; ===

In 1950 Bud Collyer got the job which genuinely made him a household name: &quot;Beat the Clock,&quot; a game show that pitted couples (usually, but not exclusively, married) against the clock in a race to perform silly (sometimes messy) tasks, which were called &quot;problems&quot; but could with more accuracy be called &quot;stunts.&quot; The grand prizes for these usually came in terms of cash or home appliances. (When Monty Hall hosted the program in the 1980s, the &quot;problems&quot; did indeed come to be called &quot;stunts.&quot;) Collyer hosted the show for eleven years (1950–61), and he also co-produced it for part of its run.

Collyer did an excellent job keeping the show fast-paced; he spoke quickly and brightly, and was often moving around the stage as much as the contestants. Frequently Collyer would interrupt a stunt to offer helpful advice, or demonstrate a more efficient way to win the game. One of Collyer&#x27;s trademarks on the show was securing his long-tubed stage microphone in his armpit (particularly while demonstrating the basics of a stunt for his contestants). He also typically wore bow ties, and liked to point out when contestants were &quot;bow-tie guys&quot; like himself, though initially, through the mid-1950s, he wore straight &quot;four-in-hand&quot; neckties most weeks. He enjoyed meeting families of contestants, and was fond of children. He would always ask about contestants&#x27; children, and sometimes would compare the number and sexes with that of his own family. When children were brought onstage with their parents, he would take time to talk to each of them and ask them what they wanted to be when they grew up, in a manner reminiscent of his contemporary, Art Linkletter.

At the height of the show&#x27;s popularity, an installment of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; (which surfaced years later, when Jackie Gleason released the so-called &quot;Lost Episodes&quot;) featured blustery Ralph Kramden and scatterbrained Ed Norton appearing on and playing &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;. Unlike the show&#x27;s familiar parody of &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; (&quot;The $99,000 Answer&quot;), Gleason&#x27;s &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; episode used the actual show and set, complete with the familiar large 60-Second clock emblazoned with sponsor Sylvania&#x27;s logo, and ending with Collyer and his famous sign-off: &quot;Next time may be &quot;your&quot; time to beat the clock.&quot;

=== &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; ===

In 1956, Collyer became equally, if not more, familiar as the host of a new Goodson-Todman production, &quot;To Tell the Truth,&quot; on CBS. This panel show featured four celebrities questioning three challengers all claiming to be the same person. Collyer would read an affidavit from the actual contestant, and then monitor the panel&#x27;s cross-examination. Because the show depended on conversation instead of physical stunts, Collyer&#x27;s demeanor on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; was much calmer and more avuncular than his fever-pitch performances on &quot;Beat the Clock.&quot; After the celebrities voted for their choices, Collyer intoned the famous phrase, &quot;Will the real... John Doe... please... stand up?&quot; Collyer always employed pauses to build the suspense. Sometimes one or both impostors would &quot;pretend&quot; to stand up before the real contestant did, bringing a moment of last-minute suspense as well as a chuckle from Collyer. The sequence provided an especially riotous moment in 1962, when Collyer purred, with a particularly pronounced twinkle, &quot;Will the real... Bob Miller... please... stand up?&quot; &quot;Two&quot; Bob Millers, both pitchers for the newborn New York Mets, rose in response. At least once, Collyer added to his call for the real person to stand up, when blues harmonica player/singer Paul Butterfield appeared as one of three challengers: &quot;Will the real . . . Paul Butterfield . . . stand up . . . and give us some blues?&quot; Butterfield rose, then joined a small band onstage to play and sing his signature song, &quot;Born in Chicago.&quot;

The show became popular enough to sustain a weekday version as well as a weekly evening version, and Collyer presided over both concurrently.
Among the celebrities who served as &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot; panelists during the 14-year run of the show were Tom Poston, Peggy Cass, Orson Bean, Kitty Carlisle (the foregoing foursome was the resident panel in the weekday series), Don Ameche, Peter Lind Hayes, Johnny Carson, Ralph Bellamy, Polly Bergen, Mimi Benzell, Sally Ann Howes, Hy Gardner, Betty White, Phyllis Newman, and Robert Q. Lewis. Collyer would end every episode by saying &quot;In the meantime, don&#x27;t you forget To Tell The Truth. Bye.&quot;

=== Other work ===

Collyer&#x27;s other game show hosting included the DuMont game shows &quot;Talent Jackpot&quot; (1949) and &quot;On Your Way&quot; (1953–1954), the game show &quot;Feather Your Nest,&quot; and the ABC game &quot;Number Please&quot; in 1961, which replaced &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; on the Monday after the final ABC episode.

On September 24, 1957, Collyer was among the guests on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; panelist Polly Bergen&#x27;s premiere episode of her short-lived NBC comedy/variety show, &quot;The Polly Bergen Show.&quot;

== Spirituality and charity ==

Religion and charitable work were very important to Collyer, and he was always particularly pleased to hear contestants say that they considered donating portions of their winnings to the church, or that they planned to donate to charities. He would often include &quot;God bless you&quot; in his parting words to contestants. He was always particularly happy to have a contestant who was a minister on the show and would ask about his congregation. On &quot;Beat The Clock,&quot; he often delivered public service messages about such charitable causes as the March of Dimes and other drives for research of diseases.

Collyer taught a Sunday school class at his Presbyterian church in Connecticut for more than thirty-five years and spent some of his off time as a caretaker at his church. According to one story, a parishioner called the church one Sunday during a particularly heavy snowstorm to inquire if the church would have services that day. &quot;Oh yes,&quot; Collyer replied, tongue in cheek, &quot;God and I are here.&quot; Collyer was known to have contributed to various Christian religious works, including authoring at least one religious book and making a recording of the New Testament of the &quot;Good News Bible&quot;. He wrote two inspirational books, &quot;Thou Shalt Not Fear&quot; (1962) and &quot;With the Whole Heart&quot; (1966).


== Death ==
When producers Mark Goodson and Bill Todman planned to revive &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; for syndication, they wanted Collyer to once again host the show. Collyer declined, citing poor health. When Goodson and Todman called Garry Moore about the job, he immediately called Collyer, who told Moore that &quot;I am just not up to it.&quot; Collyer died at age 61 from a circulatory ailment in Greenwich, Connecticut, on the same day the new &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot; premiered in daytime syndication. 

Collyer is interred at Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich. In 1985, he was posthumously named as one of the honorees by DC Comics in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot;.

== Family ==
Collyer was the brother of film actress June Collyer and film producer Richard Heermance. 

He married Heloise Law Green in 1936. In 1947, he married 1930s movie actress Marian Shockley.
He had two daughters, Cynthia and Pat, and a son, Michael, who died in 2004. In January 1957, his son Mike appeared as a challenger on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, under the name of &quot;Pat Rizzuto&quot;. One of his daughters also appeared on the show on February 5, 1962.

<text>Calyptratae is a subsection of Schizophora in the insect order Diptera, commonly referred to as the calyptrate muscoids (or simply calyptrates). It consists of those flies which possess a calypter that covers the halteres, among which are some of the most familiar of all flies, such as the house fly.

About 18,000 described species are in this group, or about 12% of all the flies yet described.

==Subsection==
*Superfamily Muscoidea

<doc id="643422" wikidata="Q4774107" url="?curid=643422" title="Anti-Australian sentiment">
<text>Anti-Australian sentiment (also known as Australophobia or Anti-Australianism) refers to animosity, criticism, or prejudice towards Australia, its culture, or Australians in general.
Anti-Australian sentiment can arise from various factors including differences in religion, events outlined in the History of Australia, its domestic or foreign policies or it&#x27;s involvement in various conflicts such as World War 1 or World War 2.

== History ==
One of the earliest references to the specific phrase &quot;Anti-Australian sentiment&quot; occurred in 1983 in relation to anti-independence groups in New Caledonia.

The term &quot;anti-Australian&quot; also predates it by decades in that by 1949, people in parts of Africa and Asia were said to have &quot;anti-Australian feeling&quot; over how Australia applied its White Australia policy.
=== East Timor ===

Anti-Australian sentiment grew within East Timor, during the period of the Timor Gap Treaty which was signed during the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. the sentiment was further intensified by the political and economic issues between East Timor and Australia, particularly over oil and gas resources within the Timor Sea, which sparked major protests.

=== Singapore ===
In 1948, there were anti-Australian sentiments in then-colonial Singapore by their citizens due to the treatment of one of their countrywomen.

=== Indonesia ===
Indonesia has been alleged to have a rise in &quot;anti-Australian sentiment&quot; because of suggestions of Australia interfering in its internal affairs. A 2003 study on Indonesian aspirants for a diplomatic position reported that 95% of them had anti-Australian sentiment. The post-Suharto era period also saw anti-Australian sentiment in Indonesia over East Timor. In Indonesia, it is related to a generalised anti-Western sentiment.

The Australian intervention in East Timor still made the Indonesian government upset and led to it taking revenge on Australia by undermining the Australian interest in the country.

=== Turkey ===
After the Christchurch mosque shootings in 2019 (which were carried out by an Australian), Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan warned that if Australians and New Zealanders with anti-Muslim and anti-Turkish views try to enter Turkey, they will be &quot;sent back home in coffins like their grandfathers&quot;, referring to the Australian Landings on Gallipoli against Turkish Forces in World War I. Many Australians and New Zealanders were highly offended by these comments and accused Erdoğan of anti-Australianism. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described these comments as &quot;appalling&quot; and &quot;highly insensitive&quot;.

<doc id="643425" wikidata="Q303037" url="?curid=643425" title="U.S. Route 6">
<text>U.S. Route 6 (US 6) or U.S. Highway 6 (US 6), also called the Grand Army of the Republic Highway, honoring the American Civil War veterans association, is a main route of the United States Numbered Highway System. While it currently runs east-northeast from Bishop, California, to Provincetown, Massachusetts, the route has been modified several times. The highway&#x27;s longest-lasting routing, from 1936 to 1964, had its western terminus at Long Beach, California. During this time, US 6 was the longest highway in the country.

In 1964, the state of California renumbered its highways, and most of the route within California was transferred to other highways. This dropped the highway&#x27;s length below that of US 20, making it the second-longest U.S. Route in the country. However, since US 20 has a discontinuity through Yellowstone National Park, US 6 remains the longest continuous U.S. Route in the country.

US 6 is a diagonal route, whose number is out of sequence with the rest of the U.S. Route grid in the Western U.S. When it was designated in 1926, US 6 only ran east of Erie, Pennsylvania. Subsequent extensions, largely replacing the former U.S. Route 32 and U.S. Route 38 (US 38), have taken it south of US 30 at Joliet, Illinois, US 40 near Denver, Colorado (past the end of US 38), US 50 at Ely, Nevada, and US 70 near Los Angeles, California, due to its north–south alignment in that state.

US 6 does not serve a major transcontinental corridor, unlike other highways. George R. Stewart, author of &quot;U.S. 40: Cross Section of the United States of America&quot;, initially considered US 6, but realized that &quot;Route 6 runs uncertainly from nowhere to nowhere, scarcely to be followed from one end to the other, except by some devoted eccentric&quot;.

===California===

The modern US 6 in California is a short, two-lane, north–south surface highway from Bishop to the Nevada state line. Prior to the 1964 state highway renumbering, US 6 extended to Long Beach along what is now US 395, State Route 14 (SR 14), Interstate 5 (I-5), I-110/SR 110, and SR 1. Despite the fact that the renumbering removed all freeway portions, it is still part of the California Freeway and Expressway System. US 6&#x27;s former routing included a short segment of the famous Arroyo Seco Parkway.

Currently, US 6 begins at US 395 in Bishop and heads north between farms and ranches in Chalfant at the base of the western escarpment of the White Mountains. After about , Benton is reached, which has a cafe and gas station. SR 120 begins here, heading west past Mono Lake through Lee Vining, over Tioga Pass, and through Yosemite National Park to the San Joaquin Valley. US 6 continues north to the Nevada state line.

===Nevada===
From the California state line, US 6 heads northeast through the semidesert Queen Valley with Boundary Peak, Nevada&#x27;s highest summit, and Montgomery Peak in California on the right. These twin peaks are the northernmost high summits of the White Mountains, both over . The highway then climbs into pinyon–juniper woodland and crosses Montgomery Pass ().

From the pass, US 6 descends into barren shadscale desert, passing Columbus Marsh on the left, then merging with US 95 from Coaldale Junction to Tonopah. The Nevada Test and Training Range begins about southeast of Tonopah.

Just east of Tonopah, US 6 continues east across a series of desert mountain ranges and valleys, including the Monitor Range. At Warm Springs, SR 375, also known as the &quot;Extraterrestrial Highway&quot;, departs to the southeast and US 6 assumes a northeasterly alignment across the Reveille, Pancake, Grant and White Pine ranges. Rainfall increases eastward, so valleys become less barren and peaks over add scenic interest.

Ely is the largest city on US 6 in Nevada. US 50 joins US 6 at Ely. East of Ely, US 6/US 50 cross the Schell Creek Range, known for verdant forests and meadows and for a large mule deer and elk population. The highway descends to Spring Valley, then crosses the Snake Range at Sacramento Pass, north of Nevada&#x27;s second-highest mountain, Wheeler Peak, where a branch road accesses Great Basin National Park. Beyond the pass, US 6 passes just north of Baker, a Mormon farming community, and reaches the Utah state line.

===Utah===

US 6 enters Utah concurrently with US 50 in a remote portion of the Great Basin Desert; the routes separate at Delta. US 6 then proceeds on a northeast course toward the Wasatch Front serving the Tintic and Eureka historic and mining districts along the way. Upon entering the Wasatch Front, at Santaquin, the route joins I-15 to Spanish Fork, which is where US 6 reverses course on a southeastern path away from the Wasatch front, also joining with US 89 for the journey through Spanish Fork canyon. After cresting the Wasatch Range via Soldier Summit, the route descends into Utah&#x27;s coal country, which is where it joins US 191. At Green River, those two routes join I-70 and rejoin US 50. From Green River east the routes travel concurrently using the route of I-70 following the southern rim of the Book Cliffs. US 191 leaves the concurrency at Crescent Junction but the other three routes remain concurrent as they continue to follow the Book Cliffs toward the Grand Valley into Colorado.

===Colorado===
US 6 is basically parallel to, or runs concurrently with, I-70 for a significant portion of its length as it generally heads east from the Utah state line thru about half of Denver. It is unsigned while it is overlapped. It separates to become I-70 Business (I-70 Bus.) through the south side of Grand Junction, rejoining I-70 just east of Palisade. It again separates west of Rifle and runs through that town, Silt, New Castle, and Chacra until it again joins I-70. It separates from and runs parallel to, I-70 at Dotsero, where the Eagle River joins the Colorado River. It again joins I-70 just east of Avon, the location of the Beaver Creek Resort, just a bit west of Vail. A significant departure from I-70 occurs at Silverthorne where it veers a bit south then north, avoiding the nearly tunnel on I-70 as it goes under the Continental Divide. It passes Keystone Resort and Arapahoe Basin before a steep climb to the highest altitude along US 6, , at Loveland Pass, where it crosses the Continental Divide. It continues down the Clear Creek valley as it again reaches I-70 at the Loveland Ski Area straddling the eastern mouth of the Eisenhower Tunnel. Slightly east of Idaho Springs, it separates to go through the scenic Clear Creek Canyon. At Golden, it combines with 6th Avenue to head south until it again crosses paths with I-70. Then, continuing east, it passes through Lakewood and west Denver as the 6th Avenue freeway. From near the eastern terminus of the 6th Avenue freeway, US 6 takes a convoluted route through Denver. First, it turns north on I-25, then heads east on I-70 to Vasquez Boulevard through Elyria-Swansea. The route emerges from the freeway alongside US 85 through Commerce City, where the pair briefly join State Highway 2 (SH 2) before separating at Colorado Boulevard. SH 2 represents the historic alignment of US 6 northeast to Brighton, while US 6 combines with I-76, heading northeast, until east of Brush. It then separates to join I-76 Bus. until it crosses I-76 east of Sterling, where it changes direction from the Interstate. It continues east until it reaches Nebraska. The last town in Colorado that it passes is Holyoke.

===Nebraska===

From the Colorado state line, US 6 starts going southeast. The first town it goes into is Imperial. US 6 runs concurrently with US 34 near Culbertson, passing through McCook. US 6 then moves to the northeast, through Hastings. At Hastings, US 34 diverges and moves north. US 6 parallels I-80 north of Milford until it reaches Lincoln. At Lincoln, US 6 becomes West &quot;O&quot; Street, Sun Valley Boulevard, and eventually Cornhusker Highway as it moves north of I-80 outside of the city, paralleling I-80 to Gretna. There US 6 moves due north and becomes the West Dodge Expressway and Dodge Street in Omaha. It passes through Downtown Omaha on parallel one-way streets and runs concurrently with I-480 in Omaha on its last Nebraska segment. East of Omaha, it crosses the Missouri River to enter Iowa at Council Bluffs, Iowa, on a girder bridge completed in 1966 that replaced the Ak-Sar-Ben Bridge, which was the first road bridge to connect the two cities.

===Iowa===
From the Nebraska state line, US 6 enters Iowa at Council Bluffs, across the Missouri River from Omaha where it intersects I‑29 within the first mile. Through Council Bluffs, it travels south concurrent with I‑29, then turns east to run concurrent with I‑29 and I‑80. Where I-29 and I-80 split, US 6 continues northeast concurrent with I-80. The concurrency with I-80 ends at the interchange with East Kanesville Boulevard, on the northeast side of Council Bluffs, at which point US 6 turns east to run through rural Pottawattamie County. Further east, the highway briefly overlaps US 59 near Oakland and continues east until Lewis. There, it turns sharply north-northeast to Atlantic where joins US 71 until I‑80. It overlaps I‑80 between US 71 and US 169 at De Soto. US 6 travels north with US 169 to Adel, then turns east to go toward Des Moines. It enters the Des Moines metro area along Hickman Road in Waukee and then forms the border between Urbandale to the north and Clive and Windsor Heights to the south. In Des Moines, Iowa Highway 28 (Iowa 28) joins US 6 at 63rd Street, and the two highways head east and north on Merle Hay Road. US 6 splits away at Douglas Avenue and it continues east. Near the Des Moines River, Douglas Avenue becomes Euclid Avenue. In the northeastern part of the city, it intersects US 69 and I‑235. The highway turns onto Hubbell Avenue and heads into Altoona where it meets US 65 and rejoins I‑80.

East of the Des Moines metropolitan area, US 6 again overlaps I‑80 until they reach Newton. There, it splits away to the north and runs parallel to the Interstate. It passes through Grinnell, Marengo, and the Amana Colonies before arriving in Coralville. In Iowa City, it passes through the University of Iowa campus on the banks of the Iowa River. The highway heads southeast from Iowa City toward West Liberty and then more easterly to Wilton. At Wilton, the highway heads north to rejoin I‑80 until they reach Davenport. After a short overlapping of I‑280, US 6 enters the city along Kimberly Road, on which it remains until I‑74. The two routes then run south to cross the Mississippi River into Illinois on the I-74 Bridge.

===Illinois===
In Illinois, US 6 parallels I-74 and I-80, mostly along its original routing, overlapping with I-74 for its first and I-80 for the final of its routing in Illinois. US 6 directly serves the downtowns of many cities for its length, including Oak Forest, Tinley Park, Moline, Geneseo, Atkinson, Annawan, Princeton, Peru, La Salle, Ottawa, Channahon, and Joliet—unlike US 20, which, in Illinois, mainly consists of freeway sections that bypass the cities US 6 serves. Like nearby US 30 and US 52, US 6 skirts the Chicago city limits.

=== Indiana ===

US 6 crosses the state line and shares the same Borman Expressway with I-80 and I-94 through Hammond and Gary, until State Road 51 (SR 51, exit 15); it then runs south for about and turns east until it meets US 421 in Westville, then runs south for , then east until it meets US 31 and US 35, and it shares the same road with US 33 for about until Ligonier, where US 33 breaks south toward Fort Wayne. From there, it is mostly two lanes through Indiana until it meets the Ohio state line just east of Butler. Before the Borman Expressway was completed, US 6 was on Ridge Road, portions of which were signed US 6 Bus.

===Ohio===
US 6 enters Ohio from Indiana in Williams County. It travels through Edgerton, then just south of Bryan before it passes through Napoleon, Bowling Green, and Fremont, before turning northeast toward Sandusky Bay and Lake Erie. After passing through Sandusky, the highway follows the southern shore of Lake Erie, passing through Huron and Vermilion. After crossing the Charles Berry Bridge in Lorain, it passes through the western suburbs of Greater Cleveland as Lake Road in Sheffield Lake, Avon Lake, Bay Village, and Rocky River, and Clifton Boulevard in Lakewood and the West Boulevard–Edgewater neighborhood of Cleveland proper. US 6 follows the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway into Downtown Cleveland, entering downtown by crossing the Detroit–Superior Bridge. US 6 follows Superior Avenue through Public Square and the east side of Cleveland before turning east onto Euclid Avenue in East Cleveland and Chardon Road in the city of Euclid. US 6 continues eastward through Lake County, Geauga County, and finally into Ashtabula County before entering the state of Pennsylvania along the Pymatuning Reservoir causeway.

Ohio also has an alternate route of US 6 in Greater Cleveland.

===Pennsylvania===
US 6 runs for in Pennsylvania between its entrance point west of Meadville and its exit at Matamoras. From the Ohio border to US 322 in Conneaut Lake, the route runs in a southeasterly direction. US 6 then joins US 322 and heads east to Meadville, picking up US 19 west of the city. South of downtown, US 322 splits from the concurrency while US 6 and US 19 remain concurrent through Meadville. The two routes continue northward to Mill Village, where US 6 and US 19 split at a junction with US 6N.

For the remainder of its routing in Pennsylvania, US 6 runs roughly parallel to the New York–Pennsylvania border. Along the way, US 6 is concurrent with US 62 for a short distance near Warren. US 11 joins US 6 from the north in Factoryville. They run concurrently to Scranton, where US 11 continues south and US 6 east. At Milford, US 6 meets US 209. The two routes embark to the northeast, crossing the Delaware River from Matamoras to Port Jervis, New York.

===New York===
The portion of US 6 in New York travels through Orange, Putnam, and Westchester counties, going across the southern part of the state through the northern suburbs of New York City. The route enters the state along with US 209 in Port Jervis. The two routes split just north of town, with US 209 taking a more northerly route to access Kingston. US 6, in contrast, runs primarily east–west through southern New York.

A section of US 6 runs concurrent with New York State Route 17 (NY 17; The Quickway) between Goshen and Harriman. The route is currently being upgraded to become part of I-86. At Harriman, US 6 passes through one of the largest interchanges in the state of New York, where US 6/NY 17 meet I-87 (New York State Thruway) and NY 32. NY 17 becomes an at-grade road and heads south, while US 6 remains a limited-access freeway as it heads east into Harriman State Park. Near the east side of the park, US 6 intersects the Palisades Interstate Parkway and runs concurrently with it to the historic Bear Mountain Bridge, where US 6 is joined by US 202 and is narrowed to a rural two-lane road as it crosses the Hudson River with scenic views of the Hudson Highlands.

On the other side of the river and exiting Orange County for Westchester, US 6 and US 202 run along the Hudson River to Peekskill and has a short concurrency with US 9 before the three routes split, allowing US 6 to continue to the northeast through northern Westchester County and into Putnam County. At Shrub Oak, US 6 has an interchange with the historic Taconic State Parkway, one of the first and most scenic long-distance freeways in the U.S. In Brewster, US 6 joins US 202 once again, with the routes running concurrently into Connecticut. US 6 and US 202 also have a large interchange with I-84, I-684, and NY 22 in Brewster.

===Connecticut===

US 6 runs for in Connecticut. It enters from the town of Southeast, New York, concurrent with US 202, shortly passes through begins the city of Danbury, and ends at the Rhode Island state line in the town of Killingly. In western Connecticut, US 6 either closely parallels or is concurrent with I-84, serving as the local route in the suburbs of Danbury, Waterbury, Bristol, and Hartford. It crosses the Connecticut River (overlapped with I-84 and US 44) on the Bulkeley Bridge. In eastern Connecticut, US 6 is one of the principal routes connecting Hartford and Providence, passing through the small urban areas of Willimantic and Danielson. The unsigned portion of the Connecticut Turnpike then meets with US 6 shortly before crossing the Rhode Island state line.

===Rhode Island===
US 6 covers approximately in Rhode Island from Foster (western border with Killingly, Connecticut) to East Providence (eastern border with Seekonk, Massachusetts). In and around Providence, US 6 overlaps with Route 10, as well as US 1A, US 44, I-95, and I-195.

===Massachusetts===
US 6 runs approximately in Massachusetts, paralleling I-195 between Providence and Wareham, and serves as the local business route. US 6 continues onto Cape Cod across the Sagamore Bridge as a freeway from Bourne to Orleans. North of Orleans, it becomes a surface road again to its terminus in Provincetown. Although the westbound sign in Provincetown has been updated to reflect the shorter terminus in Bishop, California, the eastbound sign in Provincetown still reflects the original coast-to-coast terminus of Long Beach, California (see photo).

==History==
===New England===

The first interstate numbering along the path of US 6 was Route 3 of the New England road marking system, designated in 1922. This route connected Provincetown with the New York–Connecticut border via Providence, Hartford, and Danbury. In late 1925, the Joint Board on Interstate Highways approved the preliminary plan for U.S. Routes. US 6 was restricted to New England and southeastern New York, with its vague description matching the existing Route 3 to Danbury, Connecticut, and heading west from there to US 7 at Brewster, New York. By the time the final plan was approved in late 1926, a second section had been added, from the New York–Pennsylvania border at Port Jervis, New York, west to US 120 in Kane, Pennsylvania. This did not last long, for the April 1927 route log shows the eastern segment running only to the border of New York, short of Brewster, while the western segment was extended in both directions—east to Kingston, New York, and west to Erie, Pennsylvania (the latter replacing part of US 120). The western segment was also swapped with US 106 between Carbondale and Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania, taking US 6 through Scranton. The gap through New York was eliminated in 1928 with a new alignment across the state, crossing the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge; the old route between Kingston and Port Jervis became the first US 6N.

While US 6 replaced the general corridor of Route 3 in New England, some portions used different alignments. One of these was on Cape Cod, where Route 3 had used a southerly alignment that is now Route 28. Instead, US 6 followed the more direct route between Buzzards Bay and Orleans that had been the southern extremity of Route 6, and now known as Route 6A. Farther west, in Connecticut, US 6 ran via the South Coventry Historic District, while Route 3 had served Andover; the old route became US 6A. US 6 is now on the old Route 3, while the South Coventry route now carries Route 31. A different alignment was also chosen for US 6 between Plainville and Woodbury; Route 3 ran via Milldale and Waterbury, and became parts of Route 14 and Route 10 in the 1932 state highway renumbering. Here, US 6 mostly remains on its original routing, with the main difference being between Hartford and Terryville, where US 6 followed the present Route 4, Route 10, and Route 72. The final difference was from Danbury west to the New York state line; here, US 6 ran straight west, while Route 3 had left the Danbury area to the south, curving to the southwest through Ridgefield to the border. Part of this became US 7, while the rest became Route 35 in 1932.

In New York, US 6 replaced all of Route 37—known as the &quot;Bridge Route&quot;—over the Bear Mountain Bridge, overlapped part of NY 17, and was assigned to an unnumbered road from Middletown west to Port Jervis. The original route, which soon became US 6N, replaced NY 50, and is now part of US 209. The part of US 6 in Pennsylvania replaced Route 7, also known as the Roosevelt Highway, an auto trail. The Roosevelt Highway Association extended the name east with US 6 to Cape Cod by 1930.

===Extensions===

Two other routes that would become part of US 6 were included in the 1925 plan: US 32 from Chicago, Illinois to Omaha, Nebraska, and US 38 from Lincoln, Nebraska to Greeley, Colorado. As part of the fine-tuning during 1926, US 38 was extended east from Lincoln to Omaha, allowing US 77, which had been assigned to this road, to extend north to Sioux City, Iowa. These routes, which now connected end-to-end at Omaha, replaced a large portion of the Detroit–Lincoln–Denver Highway, which split at Princeton to bypass Chicago to the south via Joliet. They followed existing state highways: SH 2 and SH 14 in Colorado, Nebraska Highway 7 in Nebraska, Iowa 2 and Iowa 7 in Iowa, and Illinois Route 7 (IL 7) and IL 18 in Illinois.

Most of US 32 and all of US 38 became a western extension of US 6 on June 8, 1931, and the Roosevelt Highway name followed. To connect Western Pennsylvania to Central Indiana, relatively minor roads (including the route for SR 6 in Indiana) were used, except west of Joliet, where it used a part of the old Detroit–Lincoln–Denver Highway. The short stub to Erie, Pennsylvania, formed at the old west end became US 6N, and US 32 remained in Illinois, running independently from Chicago to Princeton and overlapping US 6 to Davenport, Iowa. In 1934, US 32 was absorbed into US 34.

The Roosevelt Highway Association continued to push for an extension, and, in December 1936, the American Association of State Highway Officials made US 6 (and thus the Roosevelt Highway) a transcontinental route from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to Long Beach, California. It took a new route from Wiggins, Colorado, southwest to Denver (the old route to Greeley became an extended US 34) and west over the Rocky Mountains to Leadville, overlapping US 24 to Grand Junction and US 50 to Spanish Fork, Utah. From Spanish Fork to Ely, Nevada, it followed a roadway that had yet to be improved in areas; the rest of the route, from Ely to Southern California, followed the old Midland Trail, running almost north–south in California. The unimproved segment from Ely east to Delta, Utah, about long, was, according to &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;, &quot;nothing but a wagon trail-rutted, filled with dust [...] one of the worst chunks of federal road in the country&quot;. Paving was completed in September 1952, with a two-day celebration in Delta marking the occasion.
Major William L. Anderson, Jr., of the U.S. Army recommended that US 6 be designated the Grand Army of the Republic Highway, honoring the Union soldiers in the Civil War. The Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War began pushing for the name in April 1934. Massachusetts, the first state to apply the name, passed a law to do so on February 2, 1937; it was not until at least 1948 that all states had agreed. The highway was formally dedicated at the Long Beach end on May 3, 1953, though the Roosevelt Highway Association continued to exist at least through the 1960s.

===Modern history===
As part of the 1964 state highway renumbering in California, US 6 was truncated to its intersection with US 395 at Bishop. The portions of the former route that did not overlap other routes, including US 395 and I-110/SR 110, were redesignated as SR 14.

Starting in early 1983, US 6 was a discontinuous route for almost one year, due to a massive landslide that destroyed the town of Thistle, Utah. The highway was rebuilt by blasting a path higher up the canyon wall. The landslide remains the most costly in the history of the U.S.

Since the 1970s, portions of US 6 in Iowa have been moved permanently onto I-80. The first section, between US 71 and Adair, was rerouted in 1972. In 1980, three lengthy sections were moved onto the Interstate: in western Iowa between Adair and Dexter, in central Iowa between Altoona and Newton, and in eastern Iowa between Wilton and Davenport. On July 1, 2003, between Dexter and Adel were turned over to Dallas County. US 6, which had previously split away from I-80 at the Dexter exit, was continued along I-80 to the US 169 interchange at De Soto, and then along US 169 to Adel.

In 2015, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved a request from the Colorado Department of Transportation to eliminate US 6 through the city of Rifle, meaning that US 6 is now discontinuous between Rifle and Grand Junction, although current signage does not reflect this change.

<text>Muscoidea is a superfamily of flies in the subsection Calyptratae. Muscoidea, with approximately 7000 described species, is nearly 5% of the known species level diversity of the Diptera, the true flies. Most muscoid flies are saprophagous, coprophagous or necrophagous as larvae, but some species are parasitic, predatory, or phytophagous.
In September 2008, a study was done on the superfamily using both nucleic and mitochondrial DNA and the conclusion suggested that Muscoidea may actually be paraphyletic.

<text>Oestroidea is a superfamily of Calyptratae including the blow flies, bot flies, flesh flies, and their relatives. It occurs worldwide and has about 15,000 described species.

The superfamily includes the families:
*Calliphoridae
*Mesembrinellidae (formerly included in Calliphoridae)
*Mystacinobiidae
*Oestridae
*Polleniidae (formerly included in Calliphoridae)
*Rhiniidae (formerly included in Calliphoridae)
*Sarcophagidae
*Tachinidae
*Ulurumyiidae

== Ecology ==
Oestroidea have a wide range of feeding habits and breeding environments: saprophagous (many Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae), feeding on blood of birds or mammals (some Calliphoridae), parasites of gastropods or earthworms (some Calliphoridae), parasitoids of arthropods (Rhinophoridae, Tachinidae and some Sarcophagidae), living in association with termites or ants (some Calliphoridae and Rhiniidae), and commensals of bats (Mystacinobiidae). Various species of Calliphoridae, Oestridae and Sarcophagidae have larvae that parasitise vertebrates, causing myiasis.

== Phylogeny ==
Historically, Oestroidea was considered the sister group to Muscoidea. A 2012 molecular analysis placed the superfamily within a paraphyletic Muscoidea, and also confirmed the monophyly of Oestroidea and of most of its families (except Calliphoridae). Morphological and molecular analyses in 2017 yielded overall similar results. Relationships among the families and subfamilies within Oestroidea are complicated and not well resolved.

== Evolution ==
The earliest known fossil of Oestroidea is of a Mesembrinellidae found in Dominican amber from the Miocene. The Oestroidea in general are believed to have originated 48.2 million years ago.

== Forensic entomology ==
Many species of Oestroidea are of forensic importance due to feeding on decomposing animals, including humans.

<doc id="643431" wikidata="Q1617290" url="?curid=643431" title="Hippoboscoidea">
<text>Hippoboscoidea is a superfamily of the Calyptratae. The flies in this superfamily are blood-feeding obligate parasites of their hosts. Four families are often placed here:

*Glossinidae - Tsetse flies
*Hippoboscidae - Ked flies
*Nycteribiidae - Bat flies
*Streblidae - Bat flies
(Note that the Mystacinobiidae, while also a bat fly, belongs to the superfamily Oestroidea).

The Hippoboscidae are commonly called louse flies or ked flies. The bat flies are Nycteribiidae and Streblidae (along with Mystacinobiidae); the Streblidae are probably not monophyletic. The family Glossinidae, monotypic as to genus, contains the tsetse flies, economically important as the vectors of trypanosomiasis. The enigmatic Mormotomyiidae are believed to belong to the Ephydroidea and not to Hippoboscoidea as previously construed.

In older literature, this group is often referred to as the Pupipara (&quot;pupa-bearers&quot;), because, unlike virtually all other insects, most of the larval development takes place inside the mother&#x27;s body, and pupation occurs almost immediately after &quot;birth&quot; – in essence, instead of laying eggs, a female lays full-sized pupae one at a time. In the strict sense, the Pupipara only encompass the Hippoboscidae, Nycteribiidae, and &quot;Streblidae&quot;, which in older works were all included in the Hippoboscidae.

==Development==

Species of the Hippoboscoidea do not lay eggs. Instead, the larvae hatch &quot;in utero&quot;, are fed internally by &quot;milk glands,&quot; and pass through three morphological stages before being deposited to pupate. This type of reproduction is termed as adenotrophic viviparity.

<text>Botflies, also known as warble flies, heel flies, and gadflies, are flies of the family Oestridae. Their larvae are internal parasites of mammals, some species growing in the host&#x27;s flesh and others within the gut. &quot;Dermatobia hominis&quot; is the only species of botfly known to parasitize humans routinely, though other species of flies cause myiasis in humans.

==General==
A botfly, also written bot fly, bott fly or bot-fly in various combinations, is any fly in the family Oestridae. Their life cycles vary greatly according to species, but the larvae of all species are internal parasites of mammals. Largely according to species, they also are known variously as warble flies, heel flies, and gadflies. The larvae of some species grow in the flesh of their hosts, while others grow within the hosts&#x27; alimentary tracts.

The word &quot;bot&quot; in this sense means a maggot. A warble is a skin lump or callus such as might be caused by an ill-fitting harness, or by the presence of a warble fly maggot under the skin. The human botfly, &quot;Dermatobia hominis&quot;, is the only species of botfly whose larvae ordinarily parasitise humans, though flies in some other families episodically cause human myiasis and are sometimes more harmful.

==Family Oestridae==
The Oestridae now are generally defined as including the former families Oestridae, Cuterebridae, Gasterophilidae, and Hypodermatidae as subfamilies.

The Oestridae, in turn, are a family within the superfamily Oestroidea, together with the families Calliphoridae, Mesembrinellidae, Mystacinobiidae, Polleniidae, Rhiniidae, Rhinophoridae, Sarcophagidae, Tachinidae, and Ulurumyiidae.

Of families of flies causing myiasis, the Oestridae include the highest proportion of species whose larvae live as obligate parasites within the bodies of mammals. Roughly 150 species are known worldwide. Most other species of flies implicated in myiasis are members of related families, such as blow-flies.

==Infestation==
Botflies deposit eggs on a host, or sometimes use an intermediate vector such as the common housefly, mosquitoes, and, in the case of &quot;D. hominis&quot;, a species of tick. After mating, the female botfly captures the phoretic insect by holding onto its wings with her legs. She then makes the slip—attaching 15 to 30 eggs onto the insect or arachnid&#x27;s abdomen, where they incubate. The fertilized female does this over and over again to distribute the 100 to 400 eggs she produces in her short adult stage of life of only 8–9 days. Larvae from these eggs, stimulated by the warmth and proximity of a large mammal host, drop onto its skin and burrow underneath. Intermediate vectors are often used since many animal hosts recognize the approach of a botfly and flee.

Eggs are deposited on larger animals&#x27; skin directly, or the larvae hatch and drop from the eggs attached to the intermediate vector; the body heat of the host animal induces hatching upon contact or immediate proximity. Some forms of botfly also occur in the digestive tract after ingestion by licking.

Myiasis can be caused by larvae burrowing into the skin (or tissue lining) of the host animal. Mature larvae drop from the host and complete the pupal stage in the soil. They do not kill the host animal, thus they are true parasites.

The equine botflies present seasonal difficulties to equestrian caretakers, as they lay eggs on the insides of horses&#x27; front legs on the cannon or metacarpal bone (below the knee) and knees, and sometimes on the throat or nose depending on the species. These eggs, which look like small, yellow drops of paint, must be carefully removed during the laying season (late summer and early fall) to prevent infestation in the horse. When a horse rubs its nose on its legs, the eggs are transferred to the mouth and from there to the intestines, where the larvae grow and attach themselves to the stomach lining or the small intestine. The attachment of the larvae to the tissue produces a mild irritation, which results in erosions and ulcerations at the site. Removal of the eggs (which adhere to the host&#x27;s hair) is difficult since the bone and tendons are directly under the skin on the cannon bones; eggs must be removed with a sharp knife (often a razor blade) or rough sandpaper and caught before they reach the ground. The larvae remain attached and develop for 10–12 months before they are passed out in the feces. Occasionally, horse owners report seeing botfly larvae in horse manure. These larvae are cylindrical and are reddish-orange. In one to two months, adult botflies emerge from the developing larvae and the cycle repeats itself. Botflies can be controlled with several types of dewormers, including dichlorvos, ivermectin, and trichlorfon.

In cattle, the lesions caused by these flies can become infected by &quot;Mannheimia granulomatis&quot;, a bacterium that causes lechiguana, characterized by rapid-growing, hard lumps beneath the skin of the animal. Without antibiotics, an affected animal will die within 3–11 months.

&quot;Philornis&quot; botflies often infest nestlings of wild parrots, like scarlet macaws and hyacinth macaws. A method using a reverse syringe design snake bite extractor proved to be suitable for removing larvae from the skin.

&quot;Cuterebra fontinella&quot;, the mouse botfly, parasitizes small mammals all around North America.

&quot;Dermatobia hominis&quot;, the human botfly, occasionally uses humans to host its larvae.

==As human food==
In cold climates supporting reindeer or caribou-reliant populations, large quantities of &quot;Hypoderma tarandi&quot; (caribou warble fly) maggots are available to human populations during the butchery of animals.

The sixth episode of season one of the television series &quot;Beyond Survival&quot;, titled &quot;The Inuit – Survivors of the Future&quot;, features survival expert Les Stroud and two Inuit guides hunting caribou on the northern coast of Baffin Island near Pond Inlet, Nunavut, Canada. Upon skinning and butchering of one of the animals, numerous larvae (presumably &quot;H. tarandi&quot;, although not explicitly stated) are apparent on the inside of the caribou pelt. Stroud and his two Inuit guides eat (albeit somewhat reluctantly) one larva each, with Stroud commenting that the larva &quot;tastes like milk&quot; and was historically commonly consumed by the Inuit.

Copious art dating back to the Pleistocene in Europe confirms their consumption in premodern times, as well.

The Babylonian Talmud Hullin 67b discusses whether the warble fly is kosher.

<doc id="643449" wikidata="Q1530835" url="?curid=643449" title="Glen Murray (politician)">
<text>Glen Ronald Murray (born October 26, 1957) is a Canadian politician and urban issues advocate who served as the 41st Mayor of Winnipeg, Manitoba from 1998 to 2004, and was the first openly gay mayor of a large North American city. He subsequently moved to Toronto, Ontario, and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Toronto Centre in 2010, serving until 2017.

In August 2010, he was appointed to the provincial cabinet as Minister of Research and Innovation. Murray was re-elected in October 2011, and appointed Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities. He resigned from cabinet on November 3, 2012, in order to run as a candidate in the 2013 Ontario Liberal Party leadership election. He became Ontario Minister of Transportation and Minister of Infrastructure on February 11, 2013.

In a cabinet shuffle following the 2014 election, Murray was moved to the portfolio of Minister of the Environment and Climate Change. He announced his resignation from Cabinet on July 31, 2017, and his resignation from the legislature, effective September 1, 2017, in order to become executive director of the Pembina Institute in Alberta. He resigned from the Pembina Institute in September 2018 after serving as executive director for one year.

In 2020, Murray ran for the leadership of the Green Party of Canada, finishing fourth.

In June 2022, Murray announced his candidacy for the position of Mayor of Winnipeg in the October 26, 2022 Winnipeg municipal election. He lost the election to Scott Gillingham.

==Background==
Murray was born in Montreal, Quebec to a Scottish father and a Ukrainian mother. While not being able to speak Ukrainian himself, he maintains close ties with the Ukrainian-Canadian community. He attended John Abbott College and Concordia University and its School of Community and Public Affairs. Prior to entering politics, he was active in human rights and community healthcare. In 1987 he led, with Margie Coghill, the successful campaign to include sexual orientation in the Manitoba Human Rights Code. He helped establish Winnipeg&#x27;s Village Clinic, the first integrated community based prevention, care, and treatment centre for HIV/AIDS in Canada. Subsequently, he became the Clinic&#x27;s Director of Prevention and Outreach programs working street involved and homeless people at high risk for HIV infection. He was a founding member of the Canadian AIDS Society and worked as part of a team through the World Health Organization that developed an international strategy for the delivery community HIV prevention initiatives and coordinated the work of AIDS Service Organizations. A 1992 documentary film, &quot;A Kind of Family&quot;, followed the relationship of Murray with his foster son, a 17-year-old street kid. Murray lives with his partner Rick Neves.

==Municipal career==
Murray entered the 1989 Winnipeg municipal election as a city councillor candidate of the Winnipeg into the &#x27;90s alliance. He was elected a city councillor at Fort Rouge ward in 1989 then re-elected twice. In the 1995 election, he defeated Terrence Halligan. He lobbied the provincial government to create a municipal property tax credit program for heritage buildings, a program which was approved with all-party support at the Manitoba legislature.

In 1998, Murray left his councillor position to campaign as a Winnipeg mayoral candidate. He was elected mayor on October 28, 1998, with 50.5% of the vote in a close race against grocer Peter Kaufmann, who received 45% of the vote. Murray was re-elected in 2002 over former councillor Al Golden.

Significant Winnipeg events during Murray&#x27;s term included the 1999 Pan American Games and the C5 Summit, a joint initiative of urbanist Jane Jacobs and Allan Broadbent which gathered the mayors of five major Canadian cities. The summit led to proposals that cities receive new and improved revenue streams, particularly from federal and provincial governments. The effort to achieve this &quot;New Deal&quot; for cities was unsuccessful.

Murray worked closely with Aboriginal communities to propose new approaches on issues such as jobs, recreation, and public safety. Formulated the city&#x27;s urban Aboriginal Policy, First Steps: Municipal Aboriginal Pathways. This was a way to raise awareness surrounding Aboriginal people who live in the urban city of Winnipeg and create accessibility to civic services. This policy framework represents the civic government&#x27;s commitment to establish a progressive and constructive relationship with the Aboriginal community. Cultural, demographic, and socio-economic challenges have been addressed as a way to foster effective urban planning and ensure the wellbeing of the Aboriginal people.

Murray championed the establishment of the Thunderbird House in Winnipeg which serves as a place of healing and cultural preservation. As a token of appreciation Murray was given an Eagle Feather by First Nations Leaders. The Eagle Feather stands as the highest honour with great cultural and spiritual significance.

In 2003, Murray participated in the days of caring by the United Way in Winnipeg by funding a project to build an indoor playhouse.

Murray provoked a revitalization plan to help create more affordable housing for low and moderate income citizens. The project was part of a bigger picture concept of helping to create a vibrant, safe, and healthy inner-city neighbourhoods. This was a joint venture between public and private financing.

Due to Murray&#x27;s efforts in preserving Winnipeg&#x27;s historical downtown and his encouragement of high standards and creativity in design, Murray was made an honorary member of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada in 2002.

Murray worked closely with Moe Levy and Gail Asper to lead the city government to provide the first public funds and land for the New Canadian Museum for Human Rights. This project was dedicated to chronicling Canada&#x27;s human rights journey and the global evolution of human rights in order to inspire visitors and take personal action in the preservation of Human Rights in Canada and around the world.

In 2004, Murray worked with Mark Chipman to lead the establishment and construction of the new MTS Centre in Winnipeg. Once the Eaton&#x27;s site closed down in the downtown core of Winnipeg, this opened up the opportunity of situating an indoor arena to create a home for the Winnipeg Jets.
In 2003, Murray spearheaded the creation of the Esplanade Riel pedestrian bridge across the Red River in Winnipeg. This bridge has been recognized as a landmark structure as it connects Downtown Winnipeg with St. Boniface. It is the only pedestrian bridge with a restaurant on it in North America.

Murray was an advocate of the proposal to create Red River College&#x27;s Princess Street Campus. The idea was to renovate an existing building on Princess Street as these buildings contained significant heritage value. This campus was selected to represent Canada at the Third International Green Building Challenge—Sustainable Buildings 2002, an internationally renowned forum that highlights environmentally friendly alternatives used in the design, building and retrofitting of new construction projects from throughout the world.

Murray was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002 and the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Medal for his outstanding contributions of citizenship and public service.

Murray was succeeded by Sam Katz, who won the mayoralty vote over councillor Dan Vandal by a margin of around 43,000 votes.

On June 22, 2022, Murray announced his candidacy for the position of Mayor of Winnipeg in the election in the October 26, 2022 Winnipeg municipal election. An eventual field of eleven mayoral candidates made it onto the ballot. A September 29, 2022 story by Bartley Kives was released by CBC Manitoba that changed the tenor of the race. He narrowly lost the election to Scott Gillingham.

==Early attempt at federal office==
On May 7, 2004, Murray announced that he would run in the 2004 Canadian federal election after several months of denying rumours to this effect. He ran as a candidate for the Liberal Party in the riding of Charleswood—St. James. On May 11, 2004, Murray announced his resignation as mayor of Winnipeg. He was one of the city&#x27;s five longest-serving mayors.

On June 28, 2004, Murray was defeated in his attempt to become a member of the House of Commons of Canada by Conservative Steven Fletcher. Murray had won a significant majority of the votes in the Charleswood and St. James communities in the previous mayoralty election but could not translate that support in what was a close race against the rising popularity of the recently merged Conservative Party. The Liberals had held the seat by small margins in tight three-way races with the right-wing Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservative parties.

==Career in the non-profit sector==

Murray has been involved in HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention throughout his life. He was a founding member of the Canadian AIDS Society he was also the Director of Health Education and HIV Prevention Services at the Village Clinic in Winnipeg. Murray was part of the World Health AIDS service organization&#x27;s working group for the Global Program on AIDS. Murray was awarded for his efforts in 2003 by Egale Canada as he was the national recipient of an award for &quot;Fighting for LGBT Justice &amp; Equality.&quot;

In 2004, Murray moved to Toronto and became a visiting fellow at Massey College. Murray became president and CEO of the Canadian Urban Institute in 2007. The Canadian Urban Institute is a Toronto-based urban policy institute conducting work across the country and around the globe. During Murray&#x27;s tenure at the Institute became a national leader value planning, the application of return on investment models to infrastructure investment planning; cultural planning; and sustainable energy mapping.

Murray was appointed by Prime Minister Paul Martin as chair of a National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy in March 2005. In 2006, the Round Table released a report stating that Canada could reduce greenhouse gas emissions using existing technology. Murray led the development of a series of research papers that offered the government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper a strategy to achieve a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

In 2011, Murray was presented with the President&#x27;s Award at the Canadian Institute of Planners (CIP). CIP established the President&#x27;s Award in 2006 to recognize achievement by a Canadian individual or organization whose significant contribution to the planning community warrants acknowledgment on a national level.

==Member of the Ontario Legislature==
In fall 2009, Murray began to be mentioned as a potential candidate for Mayor of Toronto in the 2010 municipal election. However, after provincial MPP George Smitherman confirmed his own intention to run for mayor, Murray announced in December that he would instead seek the Ontario Liberal nomination for the February 4, 2010 by-election to succeed Smitherman in Toronto Centre.

Murray was acclaimed as the Liberal candidate at their nomination meeting on January 6, 2010. His stated priorities are building healthy, sustainable communities; providing quality, accessible health care; ensuring access to affordable housing; proposing innovative solutions to climate change; advancing human rights; and reducing the tax burden. Accused by his opponents of lacking roots in Toronto, Murray pointed out that nearly half of Torontonians weren&#x27;t born in Canada, and launched ProudToronto.ca to allow Torontonians, whether born in the city or recent arrivals, to share their stories.

Murray retained the seat for the Liberals winning 47% of the vote. He defeated New Democrat candidate Cathy Crowe who came in second with 33% and Progressive Conservative Pamela Taylor (15%).

===2011 provincial election and 2014 provincial elections===
On May 11, 2011, Murray announced to a group of 120 supporters in the 519 Church Street Community Centre that he would campaign to defend his seat in the October provincial election. Murray vowed to stand up for civility and dignity. &quot;Growing up as gay, I heard every ugly homophobic thing you can think of. I will stand up against every Tory that tries to take our rights away because that’s all they ever do.&quot; He was re-elected with 54.8% of the vote, an increase of almost 8% from the 2010 by-election.

===Community Action Plan===
After being elected as the MPP of Toronto Centre in February 2010, Glen Murray initiated a community engagement and planning process called the &quot;Community Action Plan&quot; in collaboration with local City Councillors, Kristyn Wong-Tam, Ward 27, and Pam McConnell, Ward 28. The process involves consulting residents through a series of Community Planning Meetings and a website.

=== Controversy ===
In 2013, Glen Murray invited the then-mayor of Caledon Marolyn Morrison to meet with him and discuss the future of the municipality, including development; something Morrison was against. Near the end of the meeting, Morrison alleges that Murray dismissed all staff members and attempted to intimidate her into moving forward with development, claiming that he could make &#x27;complaints&#x27; about her &#x27;go away&#x27;. This meeting occurred during a period of time where Morrison and her family were threatened and her husband was assaulted over development-related issues. Murray maintains that the meeting was &#x27;pleasant&#x27;.

==Cabinet==
On August 18, 2010, Murray was first appointed by Premier Dalton McGuinty to cabinet as Minister of Research and Innovation and a year later as Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities. He became Ontario Minister of Transportation and Minister of Infrastructure on February 11, 2013, in Premier Kathleen Wynne&#x27;s Liberal government.

===Minister of Research and Innovation===
As Minister of Research and Innovation Murray led Ontario&#x27;s WaterTAP initiative. In support of the Open Ontario plan to engage the global economy, Murray signed an agreement with Singapore on the development of clean water technologies that is the first of its kind in the world, and he completed an agreement to create the Ontario-Quebec Life Sciences Corridor to stimulate the flow of ideas and investment between these two robust innovation leaders.

On Social Innovation, Murray collaborated with Ministers Hoskins and Broten on Ontario&#x27;s first Open Source policy development plan, and launched the Social Venture Exchange. Murray also introduced an experiential learning program through the Ontario Centres of Excellence.

===Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities===
Within weeks of assuming his new position Murray launched the McGuinty government&#x27;s ground breaking 30% off Ontario Tuition grant.

===Ontario Cycling Strategy===
As the Minister of Transportation and Minister of Infrastructure, pushed by several cycling advocacy groups in the province, Murray spearheaded the first effort in 20 years to write a comprehensive cycling promotion strategy for Ontario. The 42-page document addresses the many outstanding issues for this rapidly growing means of transportation. The strategy covers education, infrastructure, legislation, enforcement, healthy communities, safer roads and tourism. The document promises annual action plans and a plan for more structured funding in the spring of 2014. Critics mention the document is short on detail and believe only large sums of money can make a difference. Advocates believe it is a first good step forward but are realistic that it will take a long time to convert Ontario into a bike friendly province, pointing out that the Netherlands, an inspiration for many bike advocates worldwide, is spending an approximate 400 million Euro on cycling per year.

===Leadership campaign===
Murray ran as a candidate in the 2013 Ontario Liberal Party leadership election but withdrew two weeks prior to the convention to throw his support to the eventual winner, Kathleen Wynne. The new premier returned Murray to cabinet, this time as Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. Murray&#x27;s approach to implementing the government&#x27;s plans for transit in Toronto resulted in resistance from both the federal and municipal government.

===Minister of Environment and Climate Change===
Following the 2014 provincial election, in which Murray retained his seat with an increased majority, he was moved to the position of Minister of Environment and Climate Change. He resigned from cabinet on July 31, 2017.

==2020 Green Party leadership election==

On April 29, 2020, Murray announced that he would be running to replace Elizabeth May in the 2020 Green Party of Canada leadership election after months of speculation. His candidacy was approved by the party on May 11, 2020. Murray finished in fourth place.

<doc id="643458" wikidata="Q1536328" url="?curid=643458" title="North Dakota House of Representatives">
<text>The North Dakota House of Representatives is the lower house of the North Dakota Legislative Assembly and is larger than the North Dakota Senate.

North Dakota is divided into between 40 and 54 legislative districts apportioned by population as determined by the decennial census. The 2000 redistricting plan provided for 47 districts. As each district elects two Representatives to the House, there are currently 94 representatives in the House.

Representatives serve four-year terms. Elections are staggered such that half the districts have elections every two years. Originally, the North Dakota Constitution limited members of the North Dakota House of Representatives to two-year terms, with all representatives standing for reelection at the same time. That practice continued until 1996, when the voters approved a constitutional amendment that changed the term for representatives to four-years with staggered terms. The amendment went into effect July 1, 1997, and was first applied in the 1998 elections. Every two years half the districts elect both their representatives by block voting. In the 2022 North Dakota elections, a ballot measure passed with 63.4% of the vote creating term limits of eight years in the North Dakota House, which was put into effect starting January 2023.

The House Chamber is located in the North Dakota State Capitol in Bismarck, North Dakota.

<text>The Gasterophilinae are a subfamily of Oestridae which includes large, parasitic flies; this group has historically been treated as a family, but all recent classifications place them firmly within the Oestridae. Many members of this subfamily spend part of their larval stages in the digestive tracts of herbivores. The best known genus is &quot;Gasterophilus&quot;, which attacks horses, deer, and similar animals. The genus &quot;Cobboldia&quot; breeds in elephants.

<doc id="643471" wikidata="Q3299589" url="?curid=643471" title="Matt Williams (third baseman)">
<text>Matthew Derrick Williams (born November 28, 1965), nicknamed &quot;Matt the Bat&quot; and &quot;the Big Marine&quot;, is an American professional baseball manager and former third baseman who is the third base coach for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB). A right-handed batter, Williams played in Major League Baseball for the San Francisco Giants, Cleveland Indians, and Arizona Diamondbacks. He managed the Washington Nationals from 2014 to 2015, and was the third base coach for the San Diego Padres from 2022 to 2023.

Williams played in a World Series for each of the teams he played for ( with the Giants, with the Indians, and with the Diamondbacks in which he won over the New York Yankees). During these years, Williams became the only player to hit at least one World Series home run for three different Major League baseball teams. During his career, Williams had an overall batting average of .268, with 378 home runs and 1,218 runs batted in (RBI). He scored 997 Major League runs, and he accumulated 1,878 hits, 338 doubles, and 35 triples, while playing in 1,866 regular-season games.

==Early life==
Williams originally was selected by the New York Mets in the 27th round (664th overall) of the 1983 Major League Baseball draft from Carson High School in Carson City, Nevada, but he did not sign with the Mets. Williams was the starting quarterback on the Carson Senators football team in high school. Two of his teammates who played baseball in high school, Bob Ayrault and Charlie Kerfeld, also played baseball in the major leagues. During his senior year, Williams was named Nevada&#x27;s high school player of the year.

==College career==
Williams accepted a scholarship to play college baseball for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

Williams played for the UNLV Rebels for three seasons between 1984 and 1986. In that time, he hit 58 home runs, tallied 217 RBI and had a batting average of .327. He was inducted into the school&#x27;s athletics hall of fame in 1997.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
Williams was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the first round (third overall) of the 1986 Major League Baseball draft. He made his professional debut that season, batting .240 with 14 doubles, four triples, eight home runs and 39 RBI in 72 games with the Low-A Everett Giants and Single-A Clinton Giants.

===San Francisco Giants (1987–1996)===
Williams was recalled to the majors for the first time on April 11, 1987, serving as an injury replacement for José Uribe. That day, he appeared in his first MLB game, going 1-for-3 in a 5–1 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Williams&#x27; first major league hit was an eighth-inning single off Dodgers pitcher Orel Hershiser. He finished the season batting .188 with eight home runs and 21 RBI in 84 games. In the field, he primarily played shortstop while also playing some games at third base.

Prior to the 1989 season, Williams was named as the starting third baseman for the Giants. However, he struggled to begin the season with a .130 batting average, and was optioned to the Triple-A Phoenix Firebirds after the Giants&#x27; game on May 1. Williams considered this demotion as a turning point in his career, as he batted .320 with 26 home runs and 61 RBI in 76 games before returning to San Francisco in July. In 84 games with the Giants, Williams hit .202, but managed to record 18 home runs and 50 RBI.

Williams enjoyed a breakout season in 1990, finishing with a .277 average, 33 home runs and a National League-leading 122 RBI en route to making the National League All-Star team.

Despite suffering from several leg injuries and some lower-back ailments, Williams was an excellent fielder at third base, and a dangerous and productive hitter. As a third baseman, Williams had good reflexes and excellent hands, with a quick release and strong, accurate arm. During his career, he earned four Gold Glove Awards, all between 1991 and 1997.

A hitter with exceptional power, Williams hit at least 30 home runs and recorded at least 90 RBI in four of his seasons with the Giants. His best season was 1994 when he hit a National League-best 43 home runs and had 96 RBI in only 112 games as the Major League Baseball season was shortened by nearly one-third because of a season-ending strike by Major League baseball players. He was on pace to challenge the single season home run record of 61, at the time held by Roger Maris, with his 43 home runs in 115 games, projecting to 60.6 home runs at season&#x27;s end. Williams finished second in the voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award that year behind first baseman Jeff Bagwell of the Houston Astros.

===Cleveland Indians (1997)===
On November 13, 1996, Williams was traded to the Cleveland Indians along with a player to be named later (Trenidad Hubbard) in exchange for future NL MVP Jeff Kent, Julián Tavárez, José Vizcaíno and another player to be named later (Joe Roa).

In 1997, while Williams&#x27; streak of three straight All-Star selections ended, he still managed to hit .263 with 32 home runs and 105 RBI in 151 games. He also won a Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Award for the first time since 1994. In the 1997 postseason, Williams hit .288 with three doubles, two home runs, 8 RBI and 13 walks, helping lead Cleveland to its second American League pennant in three years. The Indians ultimately lost the World Series in seven games to the Florida Marlins. 

===Arizona Diamondbacks (1998–2003)===

After his divorce from his first wife Tracie, Williams requested and was granted a trade to the Arizona Diamondbacks to be closer to his children. The trade sent Williams to Arizona in exchange for Travis Fryman, Tom Martin and cash considerations. Williams signed a five-year, $45 million extension with the Diamondbacks after the acquisition was completed. He was a member of the first Diamondbacks team during the club&#x27;s inaugural season in 1998. He shares the Diamondbacks record for the most RBI in one season with a total of 142 during 1999; the record was tied by Luis Gonzalez in 2001, but has never been exceeded.

Williams was a partial owner of the Diamondbacks, and carried the title of &quot;Special Assistant to the General Partner&quot;. Williams occasionally also served as color commentator during Diamondbacks radio and television broadcasts, and also assisted in coaching and with player personnel matters.

==Managerial career==

===Washington Nationals (2014–2015)===
On October 31, 2013, the Washington Nationals announced that they had hired Williams to replace Davey Johnson as their manager for the 2014 season. Prior to the 2015 season, the Nationals exercised an option to extend Williams through the 2016 season.
Williams managed the Nationals to a 96–66 record and an NL East division title in his first season, but the team lost the NLDS to the San Francisco Giants. Williams was named the 2014 National League Manager of the Year.

On October 5, 2015, the Nationals fired Williams after a disappointing season where they were World Series favorites and failed to make the postseason. He finished with a record of 179 wins and 145 losses.

===Kia Tigers (2020–2021)===
Williams joined the Kia Tigers of the KBO League, becoming their first American-born manager before the 2020 season. On November 5, 2021, it was announced that Williams would not be returning to the team in 2022 after the club finished in ninth place with a 58–75 record in 2021.

===Managerial record===

==Coaching career==
On November 11, 2009, Williams was hired by the Arizona Diamondbacks to be the first base coach for 2010. Williams moved from first base coach to third base coach for the 2011 season, while working under first-year manager Kirk Gibson. Williams coached for the Diamondbacks from 2010 through 2013, and again in 2016 when he was fired from the Nationals. 

Williams was hired as the Oakland Athletics&#x27; third base coach in November 2017, staying with them through the 2019 season.

On December 17, 2021, Williams was hired by the San Diego Padres to serve as the team&#x27;s third base coach for the 2022 season.

Following the hiring of Bob Melvin as the manager of the San Francisco Giants and his departure from the Padres, on November 10, 2023, it was announced that Williams would be replacing Mark Hallberg as third base coach for the Giants for the 2024 season.

==Other work==
Williams joined NBC Sports Bay Area in 2017 as a studio analyst, appearing before and after San Francisco Giants telecasts.

==Steroid use==
On November 6, 2007, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that Williams purchased $11,600 worth of human growth hormone (HGH), steroids and other drugs from a Palm Beach clinic in 2002. Williams later told the &quot;Chronicle&quot; he used HGH on the advice of a doctor to treat an ankle injury he suffered during spring training in 2002.

On December 13, 2007, he was named among the dozens of players alleged to have used steroids in the &quot;Mitchell Report&quot;, commissioned by Major League Baseball and written by former Senator George J. Mitchell.

==Accomplishments==



==Hall of Fame candidacy==
Williams became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009. He received just 1.3% of the votes, and was dropped from the ballot.

==Personal life==
Williams has been married three times. He and his first wife, Tracie, had three children. He was selected for the 1989 Triple-A All-Star Game but withdrew from the contest in order to get married. He married his second wife, film actress Michelle Johnson, in 1999. They divorced in 2002, and did not have children together. In 2003, Williams married Phoenix news anchor Erika Monroe. In 2007 the couple co-hosted the weekend pre-game shows for the Arizona Diamondbacks called &quot;DBacks on Deck&quot;.

In March 2023, Williams took a leave of absence from the Padres organization after he underwent surgery following a diagnosis of colon cancer.

In September 2023, Erika Monroe filed for divorce from Williams, citing irreconcilable differences. They share one child, an adult daughter.

Williams is the grandson of former major league outfielder Bert Griffith.

<text>Robert William Bemer (February 8, 1920 – June 22, 2004) was a computer scientist best known for his work at IBM during the late 1950s and early 1960s.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, Bemer graduated from Cranbrook Kingswood School in 1936 and took a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in mathematics at Albion College in 1940. He earned a certificate in aeronautical engineering at Curtiss-Wright Technical Institute in 1941.

== Career ==
Bemer began his career as an aerodynamicist at Douglas Aircraft Company in 1941, then worked for RAND Corporation from 1951, IBM from 1957, UNIVAC – Sperry Rand in 1965, Bull from 1965, General Electric from 1970, and Honeywell from 1974.

He served on the committee which amalgamated the design for his COMTRAN language with Grace Hopper&#x27;s FLOW-MATIC and thus produced the specifications for COBOL. He also served, with Hugh McGregor Ross and others, on the separate committee which defined the ASCII character codeset in 1960, contributing several characters which were not formerly used by computers including the escape (codice_1), backslash (codice_2), and curly brackets (codice_3). As a result, he is sometimes known as &quot;The Father of ASCII&quot;. In 2000, Bemer claimed to have proposed the term octet (rather than Werner Buchholz&#x27; &quot;byte&quot;) while heading software development at Cie. Bull, France, between 1965 and 1966. He also proposed the term hextet for 16-bit groups.

Bemer is probably the earliest proponent of the &quot;software factory&quot; concept. He mentioned it in his 1968 paper &quot;The economics of program production&quot;.

Other notable contributions to computing include the first publication of the time-sharing concept in 1957 and the first attempts to prepare for the Year 2000 problem in publications as early as 1971. Acting in an advisory capacity, Bob and Honeywell employees Eric Clamons and Richard Keys developed the &quot;Text Executive Programming Language&quot; (TEX).

In the late 1990s, as a retiree, Bob invented an approach to Year 2000 (Y2K) date conversion, to avoid anticipated problems when dates without centuries were compared in programs for which source code was unavailable. This involved detecting six and eight character operations at runtime and checking their operands, adjusting the comparison so that low years in the new century did not appear to precede the last years of the twentieth century.

Bob Bemer maintained an extensive collection of archival material on early computer software development at www.bobbemer.com.

== Death ==
Bemer died at his home in Possum Kingdom Lake, Texas in 2004 at age 84 after a battle with cancer.

Per the state constitution, North Dakota is divided into between 40 and 54 legislative districts apportioned by population as determined by the decennial census. The 2000 redistricting plan provided for 47 districts, with one senator elected from each district.

Senators serve four-year terms. Elections are staggered such that half the senate districts have elections every two years. In the 2022 North Dakota elections, a ballot measure passed with 63.4% of the vote creating term limits of eight years in the North Dakota Senate, which was put into effect starting January 2023.

The Senate Chamber is located in the North Dakota State Capitol in Bismarck, North Dakota.

<doc id="643508" wikidata="Q5089069" url="?curid=643508" title="Check 21 Act">
<text>The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (or Check 21 Act) is a United States federal law, , that was enacted on October 28, 2003 by the 108th U.S. Congress. The Check 21 Act took effect one year later on October 28, 2004. The law allows the recipient of a paper check to create a digital version of the original, a process known as check truncation, into an electronic format called a &quot;substitute check&quot;, thereby eliminating the need for further handling of the physical document. The recipient bank no longer returns the paper check but electronically transmits an image of both sides of the check to the bank it is drawn upon. 

Consumers are most likely to see the effects of this act when they notice that certain checks (or images thereof) are no longer being returned to them with their monthly statement, even though other checks are still being returned. Another effect of the law is that it is now legal for anyone to use a computer scanner or mobile phone to capture images of checks and deposit them electronically, a process known as remote deposit.

Check 21 is not subject to ACH rules; therefore transactions are not subject to NACHA (The Electronic Payments Association) rules, regulations, fees and fines.

This act was passed in response to the events of 9/11/2001, at that time checks were still physically transported between banks. In the weeks after 9/11 planes were grounded meaning checks were not transported in the timely manner people were used to. To prevent this breakdown of an at the time critical system of payment, this act was proposed and passed.

== Truncation ==
The Act lets banks take advantage of image technologies and electronic transport while not being dependent on other banks being ready to settle transactions with images instead of paper. The process of removing the paper check from its processing flow is called &quot;check truncation&quot;. In truncation, both sides of the paper check are scanned to produce a digital image. If a paper document is still needed, these images are inserted into specially formatted documents containing a photo-reduced copy of the original checks called a &quot;substitute check&quot;.

Once a check is truncated, businesses and banks can work with either the digital image or a print reproduction of it. Images can be exchanged between member banks, savings and loans, credit unions, servicers, clearinghouses, and the Federal Reserve Bank.

<doc id="643510" wikidata="Q2980788" url="?curid=643510" title="Hopton-on-Sea">
<text>Hopton-on-Sea is a village, civil parish and seaside resort on the coast of East Anglia, in the county of Norfolk, England. It is located south of Great Yarmouth and north-west of Lowestoft.

==History==

The village&#x27;s name means &quot;Farm/settlement in enclosed spot&quot;; it is perhaps referring to the promontory jutting into marsh.

The earliest human activity in the parish dates to the Palaeolithic era, with the discovery of flint tools. There have also been artefacts found from the Bronze Age and Roman era in the area.

The oldest building in the parish is the ruin of St Margaret&#x27;s church, built in the 14th century; it burned down in 1865. The ruins of the old church are being restored to form a cultural centre for the village. As part of the £140,000 restoration project by the &quot;Great Yarmouth Preservation Trust&quot;, gargoyles were found on the site from the previous 11th century church.

A new church of the same name was built the following year in Early English style on a new site, which is still in use today. Designed by Samuel Sanders Teulon, it contains stained glass by William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones.

During World War II, a dense network of military defences were built in the area due to Hopton&#x27;s close proximity to Great Yarmouth. These included anti-tank defences, pillboxes, air-raid shelters and a coastal battery. Constructed in 1940, this battery had a pair of large gun houses, four six-inch guns and search-lights. The site was armed during and after the war, until August 1947, due to its prime location for an invasion.

==Geography==
The village is sited on the East Anglia coast, beside the North Sea; it has a wide sandy beach, &quot;Hopton-on-Sea Beach&quot;, which runs by grassy cliffs. The beach suffers from coastal erosion and, as of 2016, sand levels have dropped by 10 ft in the last five years. The erosion has led to a project to replace the old wooden groynes, with ones made of rock and the construction of a seawall. These defences are estimated to protect the area for up to a century.

The civil parish was, until 1974, in the county of East Suffolk. It has an area of and, in the 2011 census, it had a population of 2,970 in 1,325 households. For local government, the parish falls within the district of Great Yarmouth.

==Amenities==
The village has many amenities for tourists with amusement arcades and food outlets. It is also home to Potters Resorts, &quot;the UK’s only all-inclusive holiday resort&quot;, which was founded in 1920. It employs approximately 560 permanent staff, making it the largest private sector employer in the area.

==Transport==
First Eastern Counties operates local bus services, with routes connecting the village with Norwich, Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft.

Hopton-on-Sea railway station was a stop on the Yarmouth-Lowestoft line, which linked and . The line and the station were closed in 1970, as part of the Beeching Axe.

==Sport==
Every January, Hopton-on-Sea hosts the World Indoor Bowls Championships at Potters Resorts; players, spectators, the BBC and many others staying in the village for what is regarded as the biggest event in the bowls calendar.

<doc id="643511" wikidata="Q372931" url="?curid=643511" title="Greg Vaughn">
<text>Gregory Lamont Vaughn (born July 3, 1965) is an American former baseball left fielder who played for the Milwaukee Brewers (1989–1996), San Diego Padres (1996–1998), Cincinnati Reds (1999), Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2000–2002) and Colorado Rockies (2003) of Major League Baseball (MLB). He was born in Sacramento, California, where he attended Kennedy High School. He then played baseball at the University of Miami. He is the cousin of fellow former major leaguers Mo Vaughn and Jerry Royster.

==Career==

===Amateur===

In 1984 and 1985, Vaughn played collegiate summer baseball for the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). He led the Kettleers to league titles in both seasons, and was league MVP in 1985. Vaughn was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame in 2009.

===Professional===
Vaughn was selected by the Brewers in the fourth round (75th pick) of the 1984 amateur draft. A slugger whose batting average dropped below .250 as often as rising above it, he compensated with excellent power. He had three seasons with at least 100 runs batted in, and four with 30 or more home runs — including the season, when he hit 50 to finish fourth in the major leagues behind Ken Griffey Jr., Sammy Sosa, and Mark McGwire, who set the home run record that season. In 1999, he became the first player in major league history to be traded after a 50-homer season when the Padres traded him to the Cincinnati Reds. Vaughn&#x27;s arrival in Cincinnati caused a bit of a controversy with club ownership, as he refused to shave his goatee to comply with the Reds&#x27; policy of no facial hair. Fans urged owner Marge Schott to lift the long-standing policy that had been in place since 1967, which she eventually did. On the field, Vaughn hit 45 homers and became the second player in major league history to hit 40 or more homers in consecutive seasons with two different teams (one year after Andrés Galarraga became the first).

Earning back-to-back 4th place finishes in NL MVP voting, 1998-99 would be Vaughn&#x27;s career peak. During his career, Vaughn batted .242 with 355 home runs, 1,072 RBI, 1,017 runs, 1475 hits, 284 doubles, 23 triples and 121 stolen bases in 1731 games.

Vaughn became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009. 75% of the vote was necessary for induction, and 5% was necessary to stay on the ballot. He received no votes and dropped off the ballot.

==Personal life==
His son, Cory Vaughn, played minor league baseball in the New York Mets organization.

<text>Beaver River is a tributary of the Ohio River in Western Pennsylvania. Approximately 21 mi (34 km) long, it flows through a historically important coal-producing region north of Pittsburgh. The river is formed in Lawrence County by the confluence of the Mahoning and Shenango rivers in the Mahoningtown neighborhood of New Castle. It flows generally south, past West Pittsburg and Homewood, then receives Connoquenessing Creek west of Ellwood City and flows past Beaver Falls and New Brighton. It joins the Ohio at Bridgewater and Rochester (flowing between those towns) at the downstream end of a sharp bend in the Ohio approximately 20 mi (32 km) northwest of (and downstream from) Pittsburgh. In the lower reaches near the Ohio River, the Beaver cuts through a gorge of underlying sandstone. The river is roughly parallel to the border with the state of Ohio, with both Interstate 376 and Pennsylvania Route 18 running parallel to the river itself.

The river, which flows throughout the northern half of Beaver County, is the namesake of the county as well as several locales in both Beaver and Lawrence County. The river itself was either named for King Beaver (Tamaqua) of the Delaware nation that had migrated to the area in the late 1740s, or for the animal. Until the partition of Lawrence County from parts of Beaver and Mercer County in 1849, the river was entirely in Beaver County, with its upstream terminus at the border between Beaver and Mercer County from 1800 to 1849.

<doc id="643518" wikidata="Q2287834" url="?curid=643518" title="Get Born">
<text>Get Born is the debut studio album by Australian rock band Jet. It was released on 14 September 2003 and has sold over 4 million copies worldwide. The album includes Jet&#x27;s most popular song, &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot;.

==Writing and recording==
Jet went to Sunset Sound Studios and Larrabee East in Los Angeles to record &quot;Get Born&quot;. The band left the recording studios halfway through recording the album to fly back to support the Rolling Stones on their 2003 Australian tour.

&quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot;, from this album, was voted number one in the 2003 Triple J Hottest 100. &quot;Get Born&quot; also has a song, &quot;Timothy&quot;, dedicated to guitarist Cameron Muncey&#x27;s brother, who died when he was a baby (the song has also been remixed for American rapper Timbaland&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Shock Value II&quot;). The track &quot;Radio Song&quot; was written about when they were an unsigned band in Melbourne seeking attention, and &quot;Rollover DJ&quot; was written about the difficulty they encountered when trying to play gigs because of the takeover of dance music.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Get Born&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 70, based on 15 reviews. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; gave it a rave review and found Jet&#x27;s songs &quot;catchy&quot; and their appeal &quot;diverse&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; magazine said that the album&#x27;s raw immediacy &quot;belies its dated influences.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; called it &quot;an efficient if fairly joyless hybrid of the Stones, AC/DC and Oasis.&quot; In a negative review, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that Jet sounds like &quot;everyone&#x27;s favorite old rock bands&quot; and have &quot;insipid lyrics&quot;, including interjections such as &quot;come on!&quot; and &quot;oh yeah!&quot; sung &quot;every five seconds&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; cited &quot;Rollover D.J.&quot; and &quot;Look What You&#x27;ve Done&quot; as highlights and remarked that the band has &quot;the juice and talent to make their retro happen without the brains or vision to run with it&quot;. He gave the album a two-star honorable mention, indicating a &quot;likable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy.&quot; In October 2010, &quot;Get Born&quot; was listed in the book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

===Lead single===
The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot;, was often singled out due to distinct similarities to Iggy Pop&#x27;s &quot;Lust for Life&quot;. The band argued that &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; had more in common with &#x27;60s Motown, however; namely, songs such as &quot;I&#x27;m Ready for Love&quot; by Martha And The Vandellas and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; by The Supremes. In an AllMusic review of &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot;, the song was praised for its commercial appeal despite its resemblance to &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, saying &quot;Whether &#x27;Are You Gonna Be My Girl?&#x27; (sic) is creatively bankrupt, or just an extreme example of how all music is influenced by what came before it, is up for debate... Either way, the song is impossible to ignore.&quot;

Chris Cester addressed the media speculation in an interview with Pop in &quot;Uptown Magazine&quot;, stating: &quot;It&#x27;s funny because I asked him point blank about that. He said I was crazy. He said that when he and David Bowie were writing &#x27;Lust for Life&#x27;, they were ripping off Motown&#x27;s beat. It&#x27;s funny that he said that to me because we also thought we were ripping off Motown more than &#x27;Lust for Life&#x27;. To be honest with you that kind of annoyed me a lot, because I always thought it was really lazy. People just go, well &#x27;Lust for Life&#x27; is more well-known so that&#x27;s what they go for, but if you listen to a song like &#x27;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&#x27; (The Supremes) I think you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s closer to &#x27;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&#x27; than &#x27;Lust for Life&#x27; ever was. And that&#x27;s what Iggy said as well.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Get Born&quot; debuted at number three and peaked at number one on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart as of May 2004 (so far being certified 8× Platinum), number 17 on the UK Albums Chart (number 14 after a re-entry in June 2004), and peaked at number 26 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart (and was certified Platinum).

&quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl?&quot; also peaked at number 20 and certified Gold on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, number 23 on the UK Singles Chart in September 2003 (number 16 after a re-release in May 2004), and number 29 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart.

The second single, &quot;Rollover DJ&quot;, was released in Australia and the UK, and peaked at number 31 and number 34 respectively.

The third single released in Australia and the UK was &quot;Look What You&#x27;ve Done&quot;, which peaked at number 14 and number 28 respectively. It was also released as the third single in the U.S. in January 2005, and reached number 37 as of March 2005.

In the US, &quot;Cold Hard Bitch&quot; was released as the second single, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts and number 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In Australia, it was released as the fourth single in July 2004, and reached number 33 in August 2004, and in the UK, it reached number 34 in September 2004.

A fifth single also charted in the UK, this being &quot;Get Me Outta Here&quot;, reaching number 37 in December 2004.

In the week ending 11 September 2006, &quot;Get Born&quot; re-entered at a position of number 46 on the ARIA Charts, presumably because Jet had &quot;Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is&quot;, the lead single from their second album, &quot;Shine On&quot;.

<doc id="643520" wikidata="Q7681747" url="?curid=643520" title="Tampa affair">
<text>In late August 2001, the Howard government of Australia refused permission for the Norwegian freighter MV &quot;Tampa&quot;, carrying 433 rescued refugees (predominantly Hazaras of Afghanistan from a distressed fishing vessel in international waters) and 5 crew, to enter Australian waters. This triggered an Australian political controversy in the lead-up to the 2001 federal election, and a diplomatic dispute between Australia and Norway.

When &quot;Tampa&quot; entered Australian waters, the Prime Minister ordered the ship be boarded by Australian special forces. This brought censure from the government of Norway, which said the Australian government failed to meet its obligations to distressed mariners under international law at the United Nations. Within a few days, the government introduced the &quot;Border Protection Bill&quot; into the House of Representatives, saying it would confirm Australian sovereignty to &quot;determine who will enter and reside in Australia&quot;. The government introduced the &quot;Pacific Solution&quot;, whereby the asylum seekers were taken to Nauru where their refugee status was considered, rather than in Australia.

==Rescue at sea==

In the years leading up to 2001, increasing numbers of people attempted to travel to Australia by boat to seek asylum as refugees. Many of these arrived off Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean, 2,000 km off the north-west coast of Australia and 500 km south of Jakarta, Indonesia. Hundreds of people arrived on tightly packed, unseaworthy vessels, and many paid large amounts of money to people smugglers for their passage to Australia.

At dawn on 24 August 2001, a 20-metre wooden fishing boat, the &quot;Palapa 1&quot;, with 438 (369 men, 26 women and 43 children) mainly Hazara, became stranded in international waters about 140 km north of Christmas Island.

On 26 August, Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) Australia, which had been aware of the vessel&#x27;s distress, possibly through Coastwatch surveillance, requested all ships in the area to respond. Of the ships that acknowledged the request, &quot;Tampa&quot; was closest to the site and began to proceed towards the distressed &quot;Palapa 1&quot;.

According to international law, survivors of a shipwreck are to be taken to the closest suitable port on the vessel&#x27;s intended course for medical treatment. Such a port was 12 hours away in Merak, Indonesia. Christmas Island was six or seven hours closer, but it did not have the ability to receive large shipping freighters and neither was it on the vessel&#x27;s route. 

The Australian rescue authorities had been the first to become aware of the vessel&#x27;s distress, and for some time attempted to contact the relevant Indonesian authorities to attend to the rescue. RCC sent a fax to the Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas) on the night of 25 August but received no response. On Sunday, 26 August, Australian EST, the Australian embassy sent the naval attaché David Ramsay to visit Basarnas. By this time, Australian surveillance had observed that the ship&#x27;s passengers had fashioned signs that read &quot;SOS&quot; and &quot;HELP&quot; on the ship&#x27;s deck and, in response, further attempts were made to contact Basarnas, first by fax and then through the defence attaché in Jakarta. At this time, DIMA called RCC &quot;asking if vessels that respond to Australian search and rescue broadcast can tow the stranded vessel to Indonesia&quot;.

A call to shipping was broadcast at 12:48 Canberra time:

Subject: Distress Relay. A 35-metre Indonesian type vessel with 80 plus persons on board adrift in the vicinity of 09.32.5 south 104.44 east… vessel has SOS and HELP written on the roof. Vessels within 10 hours report best ETA and intentions to this station.

Captain Arne Rinnan of MV &quot;Tampa&quot; responded to the mayday call: &quot;We are on a voyage from Fremantle to Singapore via Sunda Strait… We have changed course and are headed for position of distress… Please advise further course of action. A Rinnan, Master.&quot; After an hour of setting course for the vessel, Rinnan received a direction from RCC apparently attempting to disown the rescue operation: &quot;Please note that Indonesian search and rescue authorities have accepted co-ordination of this incident.&quot;

&quot;Tampa&quot; reached the vessel, guided by Australian Coastwatch de Havilland Dash-8 aircraft, at about 2 pm. The first child was lifted to safety at 2:30pm and the rescue operation continued all afternoon.

Rinnan recounted in an interview with &quot;Norway Today&quot;:
During the rescue, Rinnan received a call from Jakarta advising him to disembark the passengers at the ferry port of Merak, Indonesia.

About half an hour after &quot;Tampa&quot; had set sail toward Indonesia, a delegation of five asylum seekers visited the bridge to demand passage to Australian territory, specifically Christmas Island, or any western country. The group was quite aggressive and agitated and Rinnan agreed to alter course for Christmas Island.

When interviewed by UK newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot;, Rinnan explained: &quot;A delegation of five men came up to the bridge. They behaved aggressively and told us to go to Australia. They said they had nothing to lose.&quot; Although Rinnan reported that he did not feel threatened and there was no risk of him losing his ship, he was conscious of the fact that there was now insufficient safety equipment or rations for all persons on board.

==Denial of permission to enter Australia==
The ship requested the Australian government&#x27;s permission to unload the asylum seekers at Christmas Island, arguing that the ship could not sail to Indonesia, because it was unseaworthy — the ship was not designed for 438 people, only its 27 crew; and there were no lifeboats or other safety equipment available for the asylum seekers in the case of an emergency. The Australian government refused permission for the ship to enter Australia&#x27;s territorial waters, and threatened to prosecute Captain Arne Rinnan as a people smuggler if it did so.

The Australian government denied any obligation under international law as Christmas Island lies within a zone designated as Indonesia&#x27;s responsibility for rescue according to an agreement made in 1990 between Australia and Indonesia. Indonesia had also accepted co-ordination of the rescue, and the closest suitable port was Merak in Indonesia. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer explained to parliament that &quot;It is important that people understand that Australia has no obligation under International law to accept the rescued persons in to Australian territory.&quot; Australian ambassador David Stuart said in the United Nations that &quot;the rescue by the MV Tampa occurred outside the search and rescue region designated as being the responsibility of Australia.&quot; Although &quot;Tampa&quot; had responded to a broadcast by an Australian rescue agency, on 30 August, Downer stated in parliament that the survivors were picked up &quot;at the direction of the Indonesian search and rescue authorities.&quot;

Faced with Australia&#x27;s threats of prosecution, Captain Rinnan agreed to turn slowly back towards Indonesia in the hope that the asylum seekers would not notice. About half an hour into the turn, however, they did notice and again became agitated. Captain Rinnan, concerned that if the ship continued to sail to Indonesia the asylum seekers could jump overboard or riot and harm the crew, decided to head back towards Christmas Island.

As the ship approached the boundary of Australia&#x27;s territorial waters ( from the island), Captain Rinnan pleaded for permission for the ship to dock at Christmas Island. He reported that several of the asylum seekers were unconscious, and others were suffering from dysentery, statements subsequently supported by the Special Air Service (SAS) physician, but later disputed by Australian authorities. The Australian government provided medical assistance and food, but still refused permission for the ship to enter Australian territorial waters. The Australian government sent military personnel to Christmas Island, ostensibly to be ready to provide this assistance to the ship.

On 29 August, Captain Rinnan, having lost patience with the Australian authorities, increasingly concerned for the safety of the asylum seekers and the ship&#x27;s crew, and also possibly acting under direction of the Norwegian Government, declared a state of emergency and proceeded to enter Australian territorial waters without permission. The legality of this action has been the subject of debate, with the Australian government maintaining that it was illegal.

==Deployment of the SAS==
The Australian government responded by dispatching Australian troops from the SAS led by squadron commander Major Vance Khan, under Colonel Gus Gilmore, to board the ship and prevent it from approaching any closer to Christmas Island.

The SAS doctor later reported that the rescuees were generally dehydrated, malnourished and unhappy. Many were suffering from dehydration, exhaustion and minor ailments including sixty one cases of scabies, forty six cases of head lice and twenty six cases of gastroenteritis, among other conditions. They also attended to four pregnant women.

There were some disputes between the SAS and the ship&#x27;s medical officer Christian Maltau, a deck officer with limited medical experience, regarding the deployment of medical supplies from &quot;Tampa&quot;, and the use of the limited supplies of water. In one incident, the ship&#x27;s officer turned off the ship&#x27;s water supply while rescuees were being washed after an outbreak of diarrhoea.

Captain Rinnan anchored approximately four nautical miles off Christmas Island. Shortly afterwards the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, reported the boarding of the ship to the Australian Parliament.

==Escalation==
The Australian troops instructed Captain Rinnan to move the ship back into international waters; he refused, claiming the ship was unsafe to sail until the asylum seekers had been offloaded. The ship-owners said they agreed with his decision, and the Norwegian government warned the Australian government not to seek to force the ship to return to international waters against the captain&#x27;s will.

The Australian government tried to persuade Indonesia to accept the asylum seekers; Indonesia refused. Norway also refused to accept the asylum seekers and reported Australia to the United Nations, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and the International Maritime Organization for alleged failure to obey its duties under international law, though it did not ask for the assistance of these organisations.

Captain Rinnan received the highest civil honour in Norway as a result of his handling of this difficult incident. Rinnan has been a sailor since 1958, and a captain for 23 years. He said of the incident:

I have seen most of what there is to see in this profession, but what I experienced on this trip is the worst. When we asked for food and medicine for the refugees, the Australians sent commando troops on board. This created a very high tension among the refugees. After an hour of checking the refugees, the troops agreed to give medical assistance to some of them… The soldiers obviously didn&#x27;t like their mission.

== Border Protection Bill 2001 ==

Late on the night of 29 August, the Prime Minister introduced an emergency bill entitled the &quot;Border Protection Bill 2001&quot;. This Bill would have provided the government with the power to remove any ship in the territorial waters of Australia (s 4), to use reasonable force to do so (s 5), to provide that any person who was on the ship may be forcibly returned to the ship (s 6), that no civil or criminal proceedings may be taken against the Australian government or any of its officers for removing the ship or returning people to it (s 7), that no court proceedings are available to prevent the ship from being removed and from people being returned to it (s 8), and that no asylum applications may be made by people on board the ship (s 9). The bill was intended to enter into force at 9:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time, 29 August 2001 (s 2); thus making the bill retroactive. It also attempted to ensure actions taken prior to legislation passage to remove ship and return people to it would have been treated as legal.

The Opposition Labor Party announced they would not support the bill; nor would the Greens, Democrats or independent Senator Brian Harradine. The bill quickly passed the lower House of Representatives, but was rejected by the Senate later that same sitting day. The Government attacked the Opposition for refusing to pass the legislation, but indicated it would not reintroduce it at that stage.

The government subsequently acted to excise Christmas Island and a large number of other coastal islands from Australia&#x27;s migration zone, effectively meaning that any asylum seekers who did not reach the Australian mainland would not be able to apply for refugee status. The Labor party supported the excision of some islands that it viewed as acting as a &quot;magnet for people smugglers&quot;, but not others, such as Melville Island, Northern Territory which it viewed as being too close to the mainland to justify excision. The other parties opposed excision of any islands.

==Political effects==
Internationally, Australia was criticised by several countries, particularly Norway, which accused it of evading its human rights responsibilities.

Domestically, the government&#x27;s line attracted strong support, especially in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks. The Australian government&#x27;s popularity rating rose throughout the crisis. In the federal election following the arrival of &quot;Tampa&quot;, the Liberal Party campaigned on the issue, with John Howard&#x27;s statement &quot;we decide who comes into this country and the circumstances in which they come.&quot;

The Australian electorate largely supported the Government. Some television news polls in Australia showed as much as 90 percent support for the Australian government&#x27;s actions. Many viewed the asylum seekers as &quot;queue-jumpers&quot; falsely claiming to be refugees, and criminals who &quot;hijacked&quot; &quot;Tampa&quot; to gain illegal entry into the country. There were concerns of a security risk involving a &quot;floodgates&quot; where people smugglers would deliberately target Australia as a perceived &quot;soft target&quot;. Some public commentators, including then-Minister for Defence Peter Reith, suggested that groups of asylum seekers arriving by boat could harbour terrorists.

In 2003, economist Ross Gittins, a columnist at Fairfax Media, said Prime Minister John Howard had been &quot;a tricky chap&quot; on immigration, by appearing &quot;tough&quot; on illegal immigration to win support from the working class, while simultaneously winning support from employers with high legal immigration.

The issue also divided the Labor Party internally, with the Left faction of the party arguing strongly in favour of a &quot;softer&quot; approach, including the abolition of mandatory detention. The party leadership&#x27;s compromise stance was pilloried by the Liberals as being wishy-washy and uncertain.

In July 2007, an unauthorised biography of John Howard claimed that he had received advice from the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department that refusing the asylum seekers entry into Australia would breach international law, but that he did so to gain public support in the then upcoming election.

In 2019, former opposition leader Phil Goff stated that New Zealand&#x27;s decision to take 131 of the &quot;Tampa&quot; refugees was one of the best decisions made by the Fifth Labour Government.

==Fate of the refugees==

The refugees from &quot;Tampa&quot; were loaded onto a Royal Australian Navy vessel, , which transported them to the small island country of Nauru, where most were held in two detention camps, State House and Topside. They were eventually joined by hundreds of other asylum seekers, under Australia&#x27;s &quot;Pacific Solution&quot;. Approximately 150 people were diverted to New Zealand, where they were subsequently granted asylum and progress to citizenship. In 2004, following the war in Afghanistan and invasion of Iraq, the New Zealand government began to reunite their families.

When those refugees not claimed by New Zealand arrived on Nauru, many of them refused to leave the boat after several additional weeks on board waiting for temporary shelters to be constructed, recognising they were to be held in detention camps pending the adjudication of their cases. Those eventually found to be refugees were granted three-year temporary protection visas, under which they could be returned to their places of origin in Afghanistan and Iraq at a time of the government&#x27;s choosing.

On 23 May 2004, it was reported that most Afghan asylum seekers on Nauru recently granted refugee status were likely to be resettled in Australia. The Federal Government decided to grant refugee status to 92 Afghans detained on the Pacific island nation, while 11 applications were refused.

Holders of a Temporary Protection Visa were not allowed multiple entrances into Australia and did not have access to the same services as normally recognised refugees (for example, free English language lessons and help with job search). Another small group was later accepted by New Zealand.

==Awards==
The crew of &quot;Tampa&quot; received the Nansen Refugee Award for 2002 from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for their involvement in the events. Captain Arne Rinnan was also named captain of the year by the shipping newspaper &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; and the Nautical Institute in London.

<text>A fansite, fan site, fan blog or fan page is a website created and maintained by a fan of or devotee to a celebrity, thing, or particular cultural phenomenon.

Fansites may offer specialized information on the subject (e.g., episode listings, biographies, storyline plots), pictures taken from various sources, the latest news related to their subject, media downloads, links to other, similar fansites, and the chance to talk to other fans via discussion boards. They often take the form of a blog, highlighting the latest news regarding the fansite subject. They often include galleries of photos or videos of the subject and are often &quot;affiliates&quot; with other fansites.

&quot;Fanlistings&quot; are another common type of unofficial fansite, though they are much simpler than general fansites, and are designed simply to list fans of a certain subject who have chosen to submit their names (and sometimes links to their home pages). Many do not contain much information on the subject at all, aside from a small introduction. They are generally made with the thought that visitors will already have knowledge of the subject. However, several are a part of a bigger fansite, used to amplify the fanbase&#x27;s experience.

==History==
In the late 1990s it was a lot more common for an individual to host their own website than it is today. It was not an option at the time to simply use one of the well-developed large-scale general-purpose social media platforms that exist now. Creating a permanent space dedicated to many aspects of a specific fandom often necessitated hosting a fansite, so as to allow room for numerous subtopics and to create dedicated website features which were not possible by using generic forums or chatrooms contemporary to the time.

Although many people did host fansites on their own web servers, it was easier and more common to use free website hosting services such as GeoCities, Tripod, Angelfire, or a smaller consolidated web hosting service offered through an internet service provider. These free website hosts were the home of tens of thousands of fan sites and fan pages. They would offer a subdomain or a subdirectory to upload site contents into, then typically later, popular sites would migrate to an independent domain name rather than keep the name of their free host in the URL. Sometimes these free hosts would offer a web template system to make it easier to start a website, but knowledge of HTML, CSS, and sometimes other backend web technologies, was generally still required.

Hobbyist webmasters launched and built fansites around many topics, such as videogame franchises and entertainment brands (TV series, movies, bands, actors). Nearly all fansites had some type of forum software, such as vBulletin, phpBB, or Invision Power Board so that it was possible for readers of the fansite to engage with each other and communicate.

Independently run fansites peaked in relative popularity around 2005. As the internet matured, many of the previously fragmented communities consolidated under new fledgling tech giants. New website offerings did not require users to understand the technical hurdles required to format and build custom webpages as was previously necessary to have a presence online. In the mid-to-late 2000s, fan communities started to migrate to platforms such as Fandom (launched in 2004 under the names Wikicities, later Wikia), Reddit (launched in 2005), Tumblr (launched in 2007), Facebook groups (launched in 2010), and Discord (launched in 2015). Short public discussions between fans additionally migrated away from fansite forums to places such as YouTube (launched 2005), Twitter (launched 2006), and Pinterest (launched 2010).

Fansites operated and hosted by individuals are still created and persist today, but have become less common. Most traditional needs of fansites are able to be met by the social media platforms and services that replaced them. Additionally, because these services host many different communities, they are able to benefit from consolidated hosting infrastructure costs, access to a large existing user base when new communities are formed, and user familiarity with an existing website interface shared between multiple communities. In contrast, the benefits of creating and maintaining a fansite without help from these modern services include: greater freedom over website functionality, more flexibility to style webpages without conforming to a unified appearance, and independence from centralized services not directly controlled by fan communities. However, these benefits come at the cost of designing and hosting a website on a World Wide Web that is far more complex and competitive than in decades past, when fansites more commonly thrived.

==Motivations==
A study suggests that unofficial fansites are often built as an alternative to the &quot;hard sell&quot; approach of official fansites that carry commercial messages. A classification system developed by Wann breaks down eight motives of fandom. These motives, particularly those related to group affiliation and self-esteem, are a driving factor in the creation of unofficial fan sites.

Satisfying the social psychology needs of group affiliation and self-esteem by visiting fansites, and, in particular, participating in the community aspects of fansites, appear to serve to increase fan behavior.

Research on interpersonal attraction indicates that people generally prefer to socialize with those who are similar to them. For example, sports fans fulfill this need by attending sporting events in person. In the online world, fans fulfill this need by building or participating in online fansites.

Many fans prefer to visit unofficial fansites for fan-related services, but still prefer an official fansite as the primary source for accurate information since it affords the closest affiliation with the target itself.

<doc id="643525" wikidata="Q218997" url="?curid=643525" title="The 101ers">
<text>The 101ers were a pub rock band from the 1970s playing mostly in a rockabilly style, notable as being the band that Joe Strummer left to join The Clash. Formed in London in May 1974, the 101ers made their performing debut on 7 September at the Telegraph pub in Brixton, under the name &#x27;El Huaso and the 101 All Stars&#x27;. The name would later be shortened to the &#x27;101 All Stars&#x27; and finally just the &#x27;101ers&#x27;. The group played at free festivals such as Stonehenge, and established themselves on the London pub rock circuit prior to the advent of punk.

==History==
The group was named after the squat where they lived together: 101 Walterton Road, Maida Vale, although it was for a time rumoured that they were named for &quot;Room 101&quot;, the infamous torture room in George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

The band&#x27;s early gigs included several at the Windsor Castle and a residency at the Elgin. They were supported by the Sex Pistols at the Nashville Room on 3 April 1976. Strummer claims that this is when he saw the light and got involved in the punk scene. Joe Strummer commented on this event in the Don Letts documentary &quot;Westway to the World&quot; on the end of the 101ers by saying &quot;5 seconds into their (the Pistols&#x27;) first song, I knew we were like yesterday&#x27;s paper, we were over.&quot;

By the time their debut single, &quot;Keys to Your Heart&quot;, was released, Joe Strummer had joined The Clash and the 101ers were no more. Clive Timperley later joined The Passions, Dan Kelleher went to Martian Schoolgirls and The Derelicts. Richard Dudanski went on to work with The Raincoats, Basement 5 and Public Image Ltd. Tymon Dogg worked with Strummer briefly in The Clash, playing fiddle and singing his original song, &quot;Lose This Skin&quot;, on &quot;Sandinista!&quot;, and later in The Mescaleros.

The 101ers&#x27; recorded output was initially limited to one single. However, by 1981, interest in The Clash was at its height and a second single and a compilation album &quot;Elgin Avenue Breakdown&quot; was released. Several of the tracks on the latter album were live recordings, and there is no evidence that the band ever conceived of these recordings as a full-length album.

Until his death in 2002, Joe Strummer had been planning to re-release &quot;Elgin Avenue Breakdown&quot;, complete with previously unreleased tracks that would encompass everything the band ever recorded. The project was completed with the help of Strummer&#x27;s widow Lucinda Tait and former drummer Richard Dudanski, and released in May 2005 as &quot;Elgin Avenue Breakdown Revisited&quot; via Astralwerks in the US and EMI in Europe. The last track on the 2005 re-issue was an 8-minute version of &quot;Gloria&quot; recorded on 22 May 1976 at the Cellar Club in Bracknell. This was recorded two weeks before the 101ers finally split. Joe Strummer joined The Clash who played their first gig at the Black Swan, Sheffield supporting the Sex Pistols on 4 July 1976.

<doc id="643526" wikidata="Q2902602" url="?curid=643526" title="Melanie Phillips">
<text>Melanie Phillips (born 4 June 1951) is a British public commentator. She began her career writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;New Statesman&quot;. During the 1990s, she came to identify with ideas more associated with right-wing politics and the far-right and currently writes for &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, and &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;, covering political and social issues from a socially conservative perspective. Phillips, quoting Irving Kristol, defines herself as a liberal who has &quot;been mugged by reality&quot;.

Phillips has appeared as a panellist on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;The Moral Maze&quot; and BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot;. She was awarded the Orwell Prize for Journalism in 1996, while she was writing for &quot;The Observer&quot;. Her books include the memoir &quot;Guardian Angel: My Story, My Britain&quot;.

==Early life==
Melanie Phillips was born in Hammersmith, the daughter of Mabel (née Cohen) and Alfred Phillips. Her family is Jewish and emigrated to Britain from Poland and Russia. According to her autobiography, the name &quot;Phillips&quot; was imposed by British officials who were unable to pronounce her family&#x27;s Polish name. She describes her family as poor people living as outsiders in an impoverished area of London, who &quot;kept their heads down and tried to assimilate by aping the class mannerisms of the English.&quot; Her father, Alfred, was a dress salesman, while her mother, Mabel, ran a children&#x27;s clothes shop and both were committed Labour voters. She has stated that her father was &quot;gentle, kind and innocent&quot;, an &quot;overgrown child&quot;, and that &quot;as my other parent he just wasn&#x27;t there&quot;, which taught her &quot;how the absence of proper fathering could screw up a child for life&quot;. She was educated at Putney High School, a girls&#x27; fee-paying independent school in Putney, London. Later she read English at St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford.

==Journalism career==
Phillips trained as a journalist on the &quot;Evening Echo&quot;, a local newspaper in Hemel Hempstead. After winning the Young Journalist of the Year award in 1976, she spent a short period at the &quot;New Society&quot; magazine.

She joined &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper in 1977, becoming its social services correspondent and social policy leader writer. In 1982, she defended the Labour Party at the time of the split with the Social Democratic Party. In 1984, she became the paper&#x27;s news editor, and was reported to have fainted on her first day. Her opinion column began in 1987. While working for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Phillips was persuaded by Julia Pascal to write a play called &quot;Traitors&quot;, which Pascal then directed. It was performed at the Drill Hall from January 1986. The play was set at the time of the 1982 Lebanon War and centred around the moral dilemmas of a Jewish journalist who as political editor of a liberal magazine has to decide whether to veto an article written in anti-semitic tones, and also whether she is right to publish a leaked document about the Falklands War. The play was reviewed by John Peter in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as &quot;a play of blistering intelligence and fearless moral questioning&quot;, although he considered it bordering on implausible. According to Phillips, writing in December 2017, it was the only positive review the play received. Phillips left &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1993, saying that her relationship with the paper and its readers had become &quot;like a really horrific family argument&quot;. She took her opinion column to &quot;The Guardian&quot; sister-paper &quot;The Observer&quot;, then to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 1998, before beginning her association with the tabloid &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in 2001. She also wrote for &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; and other periodicals.

In November 2010, &quot;The Spectator&quot; and Phillips apologised and agreed to pay substantial compensation and legal costs to a prominent British Muslim they falsely accused of antisemitism. The following year, she resigned from the magazine after it apologised and paid compensation for another of her pieces which, it said, contained an allegation that was &quot;completely false&quot;.

Since 2003, she has written a blog, once hosted by &quot;The Spectator&quot;, but following her resignation from the magazine in June 2011, it is hosted on her website. In September 2013, it emerged that her &quot;Mail&quot; column was to end, although according to Phillips, the newspaper wanted her to continue to write features and other articles for it.

In 2013, she launched an e-book publishing company called emBooks, to promote her book, together with several others, and self-promotional merchandise to the US market. She currently writes for &quot;The Times&quot;.

She had a weekly radio show on Voice of Israel, is a regular panellist on BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Moral Maze&quot; and appears frequently on BBC TV&#x27;s signature political shows &quot;Question Time&quot; and &quot;The Daily Politics&quot;.

==Views and opinions==
The BBC has said that Phillips &quot;is regarded as one of the [British] media&#x27;s leading right-wing voices&quot; and a &quot;controversial&quot; columnist. Nick Cohen wrote in 2011 that she has become vilified by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Phillips herself stated in 2006, during an interview with Jackie Ashley for the newspaper, that it often misrepresents her opinions.

===International issues===
====Islam====
Phillips was heavily criticised for an article she wrote in &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; which suggested that &quot;the taunt of Islamophobia is used to silence any criticism of the Islamic world, including Islamic extremism&quot; and &quot;facilitates&quot; antisemitism. The newspaper&#x27;s editor, while not offering regret for publishing the article, did acknowledge that the article had been divisive and apologised to readers who had been angered or upset by the piece. Simon Kuper, writing in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, accused her in 2011 of being an advocate for the Eurabia conspiracy theory.

====Iran====
She is a staunch critic of Iran and has written and spoken frequently about the threat she perceives it to be, particularly if it were to obtain nuclear weapons. She has drawn criticism for her hard-line approach from &quot;The Guardian&quot; commentators.

====Israel====
Phillips&#x27;s criticisms of liberal Jews who disagree with her positions on Israel have been mocked or condemned by writers such as Alan Dershowitz, Rabbi David Goldberg, and Jonathan Freedland, who criticised Phillips&#x27;s labelling of Independent Jewish Voices, a group of liberal Jews, as &quot;Jews For Genocide&quot;. Freedland wrote in &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;: &quot;Now, as it happens, I have multiple criticisms of IJV ... but even their most trenchant opponents must surely blanch at the notion that these critics of Israel and of Anglo-Jewish officialdom are somehow in favour of genocide—literally, eager to see the murder and eradication of the Jewish people ... it is an absurdity, one that drains the word &#x27;genocide&#x27; of any meaning&quot;.

==== Gaza ====
In 2024 Phillips made a number of claims on BBC &quot;Question Time&quot; related to Gaza. She claimed that it was “completely untrue” that Gazans were being denied access to food and humanitarian aid, that photos and videos on Youtube showed stocked food markets in Gaza and that supplies had been stopped from going into Gaza because they had been ‘stolen by Hamas‘. She also claimed that the UN is “compromised” by links to Hamas and that a ceasefire would lead to more deaths. &quot;The Independent&quot; fact checked these claims and found no evidence to support them.

====United States====
Early in the presidency of Barack Obama, Phillips accused him of &quot;adopting the agenda of the Islamist&quot; and of being &quot;firmly in the Islamists&#x27; camp&quot;. Shortly after Obama&#x27;s re-election for a second term, Phillips said that &quot;Four years ago, America put into the White House a sulky narcissist with an unbroken history of involvement in thuggish, corrupt, far-left, black power, Jew-bashing, west-hating politics&quot;. She warned that Obama would lead America into a &quot;terrifying darkness&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; termed it &quot;rather odd&quot; and an &quot;angry rant&quot;, which &quot;sparked debate on Twitter&quot;.

Phillips wrote in defence of president-elect Donald Trump on 14 November 2016: &quot;Believing the smears they have created, the Trumpophobes then smear the public for voting for the man they have thus smeared. This, of course, is precisely why millions voted against the liberal establishment and for Trump, as well as for Brexit, in the first place&quot;.

A year later she criticised Trump for retweeting videos from Britain First&#x27;s leader Jayda Fransen, calling them &quot;beyond stupid, reckless and reprehensible.&quot; She added that &quot;Trump has given an enormous boost to a group that should be treated as totally beyond the pale. Although campaigning against Islamic extremism, intolerance and religious fascism is not just acceptable but necessary, some groups which do so are totally unacceptable because they themselves promote extremism, intolerance or fascism. Britain First is squarely in that category.&quot;

===Climate change===
Phillips opposes the scientific consensus on climate change. In 2013 she argued that &quot;there is no evidence for global warming... the seas are not rising any more than is in any way out of the ordinary, the ice is not decreasing, it is increasing, the polar bears are increasing in number, and the temperature is going down, not up&quot;. She believes that &quot;The warming that was observed between 1978–1998 has stopped and global temperatures have plateaued.&quot; She has further argued that &quot;Man-made global warming theory has been propped up by studies that many scientists have dismissed as methodologically flawed, ideologically bent or even fraudulent.&quot; She has written that &quot;The claim that emissions are acidifying the oceans is a favourite of climate-change alarmists&quot; and that &quot;claims that coral reefs are doomed by ocean acidification are overplayed&quot;.

Phillips&#x27; published views on these topics have been rebutted by scientists and academics, including John Krebs and Nicholas Stern.

===MMR vaccine===
Melanie Phillips supported Andrew Wakefield, whose fraudulent work triggered controversy about the MMR vaccine and led to his being struck off the medical register. Through numerous articles in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Phillips championed Wakefield&#x27;s claims while casting doubt on their rebuttal by scientists, doctors, and politicians. Her attacks on MMR attracted criticism from scientists and science writers. Phillips continued to support Wakefield after his research methods and motives began to attract serious scrutiny and criticism: &quot;While Mr Wakefield is being subjected to a witch-hunt, and while the parents of the affected children are scandalously denied legal aid to pursue the court case which may well have finally brought to light the truth about MMR, those powerful people in the medical establishment are continuing to misrepresent the evidence.&quot;

In May 2010, Andrew Wakefield was struck off the Medical Register for &quot;serious professional misconduct&quot;, and is currently barred from practising medicine in the UK. Phillips&#x27;s support of Wakefield&#x27;s &quot;findings&quot; and her campaign against the MMR vaccine has been both widely noted, and credited for significantly undermining public trust in vaccines.

===Domestic issues===
====Irish independence====
Phillips expressed opposition to Irish independence, declaring on 7 March 2017 in her column in &quot;The Times&quot;, that the &quot;most troublesome bits&quot; of the UK are &quot;showing signs of disuniting&quot;. For her, Scottish nationalism and Irish republicanism are cultural phenomena &quot;rooted in romanticism and myth&quot;, while Englishness &quot;came to stand proxy for all the communities of the British Isles&quot;. In particular, she wrote &quot;Ireland itself has a tenuous claim to nationhood&quot; because the Irish Free State was only established in 1922. She denounced &quot;attempts at secession by tribes&quot; in Northern Ireland. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; said that the piece had met with objections from both unionists and republicans. The Irish ambassador to the United Kingdom, Daniel Mulhall, said on Twitter that the country&#x27;s sovereignty is &quot;based on strong sense of identity, distinctive culture &amp; shared values and interests&quot; and rejected her claim.

She is ambivalent about the Northern Ireland peace process, stating that, on the one hand, it has strengthened the Union with Great Britain and saved lives, but that, on the other hand, it has rewarded terrorism, &quot;undermined the rule of law&quot;, and exchanged bombs for &quot;paramilitary, mafia-style control of some areas of Northern Ireland&quot;. In June 2014, in the context of Britain&#x27;s first entirely secret trial for centuries, Phillips said that such legal proceedings are justifiable in certain circumstances.

====Party politics====
She has argued that the Conservative Party lost its way after the retirement of Margaret Thatcher. She also stated that the UK Independence Party is prepared to embody &quot;truly conservative attitudes&quot; and has attracted a sizeable protest vote, despite its &quot;unsustainable spending policies&quot;. However, she has also offered tempered praise of Tony Blair&#x27;s attitude to Islamic extremism, and she supported his policy of entering the Iraq War.

====Education====
In &quot;All Must Have Prizes&quot;, published in 1996, Phillips offered a critique of the British education system, saying that an egalitarian and non-competitive ethos (progressivism; multicultural education) had led to a catastrophic fall in standards. She criticised John Dewey&#x27;s &quot;disastrous influence&quot;. One academic critic said that &quot;Phillips gets Dewey quite wrong,&quot; for example in claims that Dewey promoted ahistoric and cultureless education. Phillips criticized one academic paper—on primary-school children&#x27;s constructions of British identity. Its authors responded with a follow-up study, showing that young adolescents, in common with their counterparts in primary schools, adopt a pluralist viewpoint with virtually no nationalist or racist comments.

====Culture====
Phillips became a &quot;scathing critic of modern Britain&quot; which she regards as &quot;a debauched and disorderly culture of instant gratification, with disintegrating families, feral children and violence, squalor and vulgarity on the streets&quot;.

====Drugs====
In 2008, Ruth Runciman, chair of the UK Drugs Policy Commission, called &quot;allegations&quot; Phillips made that the commission was &quot;intent on bringing about the legalisation of drugs&quot; &quot;an absolute travesty and a wilful misrepresentation&quot;.

====Gay rights====
She opposed the introduction of civil partnerships for gay couples in the UK, and has said that what she calls &quot;the traditional family [...] has been relentlessly attacked by an alliance of feminists, gay rights activists, divorce lawyers and cultural Marxists who grasped that this was the surest way to destroy Western society.&quot; She has said that giving IVF fertility treatment to lesbians would &quot;help destroy our understanding of human identity&quot;. She said the UK government was brainwashing children by including references to gay people in lessons in schools. She received the &#x27;Bigot of the Year&#x27; award from gay equality organisation Stonewall in 2011.

==Personal life==
Phillips is married to Joshua Rozenberg, former legal affairs editor for the BBC. The couple have two children.

<doc id="643540" wikidata="Q967969" url="?curid=643540" title="Tom Poston">
<text>Thomas Gordon Poston (October 17, 1921 – April 30, 2007) was an American actor, appearing in television roles from the 1950s through the early to mid-2000s, reportedly appearing in more sitcoms than any other actor. In the 1980s, he played George Utley on the CBS sitcom &quot;Newhart&quot;, receiving three Emmy Award nominations for the role. In addition he had a number of film roles and appeared frequently on Broadway and television game shows.

== Early life ==
Poston was born on October 17, 1921 in Columbus, Ohio, to George and Margaret Poston. His father was a liquor salesman and dairy chemist.

After completing high school, Poston attended Bethany College in West Virginia, but did not graduate. While there, he joined the Sigma Nu fraternity. He joined the United States Army Air Forces in 1941. Accepted to officer candidate school and then graduating from flight training, Poston served as a pilot in the European Theater in World War II; his aircraft dropped paratroopers for the Normandy invasion.

Poston served in North Africa, Italy, France, and England. After his discharge, he began studying acting in New York City, graduating from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.

== Career ==
In 1953, as Thomas Poston, he was cast as &quot;Detective&quot; in the film &quot;City That Never Sleeps&quot;. In 1957, Poston gained recognition as a comedic &quot;Man in the Street&quot; (along with his colleagues Louis Nye, Dayton Allen and Don Knotts) on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;. For these performances, Poston won the 1959 Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor (Continuing Character) in a Comedy Series. In the fall of 1959, when the Allen program moved west to Los Angeles, Poston remained in New York, appearing frequently on Broadway and television game shows.

His film career was limited, with appearances in films such as William Castle&#x27;s &quot;Zotz!&quot; (1962), &quot;The Old Dark House&quot; (1963), &quot;Soldier in the Rain&quot; (1963), &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; (1971), &quot;The Happy Hooker&quot; (1975), &quot;Rabbit Test&quot; (1978), &quot;Up the Academy&quot; (1980) and &quot;Carbon Copy&quot; (1981). He was cast as Michael Carrington&#x27;s uncle Tom Anderson in &quot;Grease 2&quot; (1982), but his scenes were deleted.

His television career covered the better part of five decades. When Mel Brooks submitted his idea for &quot;Get Smart&quot; to the ABC network, ABC wanted Poston for the lead role of Maxwell Smart. When ABC passed on the show, NBC picked it up and the lead went to Don Adams. Poston, however, made a guest appearance on the show as a KAOS villain. He appeared in &quot;Thriller&quot; during its second season in 1961. The episode, number six, was titled &quot;Masquerade&quot; and starred Elizabeth Montgomery.

In 1968, Poston played the role of the Scarecrow, at The Municipal Opera Association of St. Louis, production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Lana Cantrell played Dorothy Gale, and Betty Low played the Sorceress of the North, also known as Glinda. 

Poston was a recurring guest star on &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; in the 1970s, playing &quot;The Peeper&quot;, a buddy of Bob&#x27;s since college, whereby he and Bob would try to one-up each other with practical jokes. Poston later played the role of Franklin Delano Bickley on &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;.

A longtime friend of Bob Newhart, Poston also played George Utley, a simple country handyman of the Stratford Inn, on &quot;Newhart&quot;, and appeared with Newhart in &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; as the town drunk, Edgar Stopworth. He was nominated for an Emmy Award three times for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his performance on &quot;Newhart&quot; in 1984, 1986, and 1987. He had a third role with Newhart in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Bob&quot;.

<doc id="643545" wikidata="Q28732" url="?curid=643545" title="Beth Broderick">
<text>Elizabeth Alice Broderick (born February 24, 1959) is an American actress. She portrayed Zelda Spellman in the ABC/WB television sitcom &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; (1996–2003). She also had recurring roles as Diane Janssen in the ABC mystery drama series &quot;Lost&quot; (2005–2008) and as Rose Twitchell in the CBS science fiction drama series &quot;Under the Dome&quot; (2013).

==Early life==
Beth Broderick was born in Falmouth, Kentucky, the daughter of Nina Lou (née Bowden) and Thomas Joseph Broderick. She grew up in Huntington Beach, California. Even as a child, she was interested in theater. She graduated from high school at sixteen, and then from the American Academy of Arts in Pasadena, California.

==Career==
Billed as Elizabeth Alice Broderick, and later as Norris O&#x27;Neal, she made her debut in two adult films, &quot;In Love&quot; (1983) and &quot;Bordello: House of the Rising Sun&quot; (1985). Both roles portrayed her as a lesbian and were financially unsuccessful. Again as Norris O&#x27;Neal, she appeared in the mainstream comedy &quot;Sex Appeal&quot; (1986). In 1986 she had small roles in &quot;If Looks Could Kill&quot;, &quot;Student Affairs&quot;, &quot;Young Nurses in Love&quot;, and &quot;Slammer Girls&quot;, a spoof of the women in prison film genre.

Her first significant role was in &quot;Stealing Home&quot; (1988), in which she played Leslie, a young woman who seduces a teenager (played by Jonathan Silverman). In 1990, she appeared in &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;. Her movie credits include &quot;Man of the Year&quot; (1995), &quot;Maternal Instincts&quot; (1996), &quot;Breast Men&quot; (1997), &quot;Psycho Beach Party&quot; (2000), and &quot;The Inner Circle&quot; (2003). She appeared in the movie &quot;Fools Rush In&quot; (1997), with Matthew Perry and Salma Hayek, as a business woman. She played a crazy religious woman, who together with her husband and brother, torture couples who break the rules of chastity while camping, in the film &quot;Timber Falls&quot;.

Her television credits include &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;The 5 Mrs. Buchanans&quot;, &quot;Hearts Afire&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot; and &quot;Glory Days&quot;. She guest starred on &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, in the 1992 episode &quot;It Happened In Juneau&quot;, playing a lusty doctor hunting for a one-night stand with Dr. Joel Fleischman, played by Rob Morrow. In 1997 she appeared in the racy Showtime series &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Bitter and the Sweet&quot; 2:17). She had a minor, recurring role in the hit ABC series &quot;Lost&quot; as Kate Austen&#x27;s mother, Diane. She played a minor role in &quot;&quot; during a tsunami where she played a neighbor of CSI Ryan Wolfe&#x27;s uncle. More recently, she had guest starring roles on &quot;Leverage&quot; and &quot;Castle&quot;. In 2019, she was in &quot;Sister of the Bride&quot;, a Hallmark channel movie.

She has appeared in several theater productions like &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot;, &quot;Triplets in Uniform&quot; and &quot;Zastrozzi, the Master of Discipline&quot; (which she also co-produced). In New York she has starred in &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; and many more. She was recently in the Chicago Northlight Theatre production of the one-woman show titled &quot;Bad Dates&quot;.

Broderick has written &quot;A Cup of Joe&quot;, &quot;Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Literatti&quot; with Dennis Bailey.

She directed three episodes of &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;: &quot;Guilty!&quot; (2002), &quot;Cloud Ten&quot; (2002), and &quot;Making the Grade&quot; (2001).

==Personal life==
Broderick had a year-long romance with director Brian De Palma during production of &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; (1990). She married Scott Paetty on April 29, 2005. 

Broderick is a founding member of Momentum, one of the first organizations in New York established to assist people with AIDS. She is also a founding member of the Celebrity Action Council of the City Light Women&#x27;s Rehabilitation Program, which provides hands-on service to homeless women, helping them overcome substance abuse and learn job skills.

Broderick lived in Austin, Texas, as of 2014, where she appears in indie films and local theater productions.

As the Australian government&#x27;s principal revenue collection body, the ATO collects income tax, goods and services tax (GST) and other federal taxes. The ATO also has responsibility for managing the Australian Business Register, delivering the Higher Education Loan Program, delivering many Australian government payments and administering key components of Australia&#x27;s superannuation system.

==History==

During the colonial period of the 1800s, a number of landholders had secured large tracts of arable land in Australia. After the states federated in 1901 to form the Commonwealth of Australia, the Commonwealth&#x27;s main source of revenue was derived from indirect customs and the excise on duties on locally manufactured and imported goods. The Labor Andrew Fisher government was elected at the 1910 federal election and was concerned about large swathes of the country being under-utilised. The government introduced the first federal tax laws – the &quot;Bank Notes Tax Act 1910&quot;, the &quot;Land Tax Act 1910&quot; and the &quot;Land Tax Assessment Act 1910&quot; – to break up the large estates.

George McKay was appointed the first Commissioner of Land Taxation on 11 November 1910. The first tax return forms were issued on 10 January 1911 so that landholders could be assessed for their land tax liabilities. The tax was not popular, but a High Court of Australia challenge to the land tax found the law to be constitutional. The associated land valuations were contentious with more than 1,800 appeals and objections received by the middle of 1913.

In his first year, commissioner McKay had underneath him 105 tax officers, assessed approximately 15,000 land tax returns and collected £1.3 million to £1.4 million. Over the next decade, the government introduced several new taxes, mainly to cope with the massive cost of Australia&#x27;s collecting revenue to fund participation in World War I. By the end of the decade, the department employed 1,565 people and collected approximately £10.45 million in taxes.

According to its 2013–14 Annual Plan, the ATO employs an average of 22,022 people. In the 2012–13 financial year, the ATO collected revenues totalling $313.082 billion in individual income tax, company income tax, goods and services (GST) tax, excise and others.

Former employee Richard Boyle has alleged that there was a culture within the ATO to increase the use of garnishee notices, which allow the ATO to access funds in the bank accounts of taxpayers. This was investigated by the Inspector-General of taxation, Ali Noroozi. Noroozi&#x27;s findings included concerns that small businesses were not given enough time to react to a garnishee notice before having their funds seized. The ATO was criticised for attempting to suppress Boyle&#x27;s revelations with a non-disclosure agreement and accusing him of 66 offences related to breach of privacy.

The ATO was the first Australian Government agency to introduce a virtual assistant using artificial intelligence on its website (see Artificial intelligence in government).

<doc id="643553" wikidata="Q4357085" url="?curid=643553" title="Porto Digital">
<text>Porto Digital, also known as The Porto Digital Science Park, is an initiative in Recife, Brazil that aims to foster technological innovation in the Northeast region of Brazil. It began in July 2000 on the island of Recife Antigo, where the port from the time of the 17th century Dutch occupation of the area was located. Porto Digital has grown steadily since 2000, reporting more than 330 technology companies that employ more than 11,000 people and housing 800 entrepreneurs within the zone by 2020.

==History and development ==

Porto Digital was created in Recife in July 2000 as a result of a joint effort of the Pernambuco state government, private sector and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Most of the funding for the creation of Porto Digital came from the privatization of CELPE, the state&#x27;s electricity company. The companies and incubators that form the science park are mostly housed in buildings on the island that is known as Old Recife. 

Porto Digital hosts CESAR, Brazil&#x27;s most innovative R&amp;D institute according to a federal government assessment in 2004. The science park was evaluated as the largest in Brazil in 2005 by AT Kearney and in 2007, 2011 and 2015 won the prize for best Brazilian Science Park, given by the Brazilian Association of Science Parks and Business Incubators (ANPROTEC). It was described in 2013 as a coordinated effort between the federal and state governments, becoming an economic keystone in Pernambuco state since its start in 2000.

Porto Digital is a member of the International Association of Science Parks and Areas of Innovation (IASP), an NGO in special consultative status with the UN, and hosted the association&#x27;s 30th World Conference, &quot;IASP Recife&quot; in 2013.

==Government investments==
The local and federal government do not directly pool resources in order to invest in the park, they offer however a certain amount of fiscal incentives to its companies. The biggest ones are a discount of up to 60 per cent on the ISS, a sort of municipal services tax and the &quot;Lei de Informática&quot; (Leis 8.248/91, 10.176/01 e 11.077/04) which concedes reduction of the IPI taxes for companies which develop hardware and automation solutions. In a country with one of the world&#x27;s most onerous tax systems, fiscal incentives are a significant factor for the success of a tech hub in the region. The incentives are not only tax reductions but also labour incentives, since they reduce bureaucracy and costs involved in the process of hiring new workforce.

==Corporate partnerships ==
The business incubator and innovation center, Recife Center for Advanced Studies and Systems (C.E.S.A.R), is the largest business in Porto Digital and serves as a flagship company for the technological park. One of the reasons for the success of Porto Digital is the high-skilled workforce delivered by the Center of Informatics (CIn) of the Federal University of Pernambuco, (UFPE). Sergio Cavalcante, CEO of C.E.S.A.R., is also a professor at CIn, demonstrating a close relationship between industry and academy. The university also offers an &quot;Entrepreneurship Project&quot; course, &quot;Projetao&quot;, which helps students develop innovative ideas and turn them into products. Many of the products developed for this course have eventually become real products sold by start-ups. For example, In Loco Media (previously UBee) developed an accurate indoor location app that powers its mobile advertising network. Porto Digital is also a research development center for international clients like Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.

==Goals of Porto Digital ==
Porto Digital articulates its development strategy in the form of 10-year plans. Its main stated objective is to be the best environment in the country for disruptive innovation and entrepreneurship in IT-related areas and creative industries. Locally, it intends to be an anchor for the sustainable development of the Pernambuco economy. Porto Digital&#x27;s first strategic goal was to have 20,000 professionals employed and the aggregated value of 400 innovative enterprises by 2020. To achieve these goals, Porto Digital developed 40 articulated projects in 6 strategic areas:

# Increase the capacity of Porto Digital to attract new investments and to strengthen the competitiveness of the businesses in the technological park;
# Integration of Porto Digital with sectors of the economy that lack appropriate technological support;
# National expansion and internationalization of Porto Digital;
# Strengthening of the image and brand of the technological park;
# Actions to promote social, economic and environmental sustainability;
# Strengthening of the technical and managerial capabilities of Porto Digital.

In 2014, Porto Digital was home to 500 entrepreneurs and 240 institutions, with another 150 related companies located in Recife but not in the Porto Digital zone.

== Governance ==

Porto Digital is run by a non-profit organization called the Porto Digital Management Unit (NGPD). It is managed by an 18-member administrative council. The members represent the firms installed in the park, other companies with ties to Porto Digital, the state government, UFPE university and Recife City Hall. It is the Council&#x27;s responsibility to decide on policies and strategies that enable and promote Porto Digital&#x27;s development.

The council has the ability to appoint a board of directors comprising a president, a director of innovation and business competition, and an executive officer. The NGPD&#x27;s permanent technical staff members have degrees in innovation, information technology, project management, urban planning, and related fields.

<doc id="643555" wikidata="Q758752" url="?curid=643555" title="Audi A5">
<text>The Audi A5 is a series of compact executive and grand touring coupé cars produced by the German automobile manufacturer Audi since June 2007. The A5 range also includes the coupe, cabriolet, and &quot;Sportback&quot;—a five-door liftback with a fastback roofline—derived from the Audi A4 saloon and estate models.

Under Audi&#x27;s internal platform numbering convention, the A5 is a member of the &quot;B-platform&quot; series of vehicles, sharing its platform designation with the A4 saloon and &quot;Avant&quot;. The first generation A5 (&quot;Type 8T&quot;) belongs to the &quot;B8&quot; family, while the second-generation model (&quot;Type 8W6&quot;) is based on the &quot;B9&quot;. Both generations are derived from the Volkswagen MLB (Modular Longitudinal Matrix) architecture.


==First generation (2007)==


===Initial release===
When unveiled at the March 2007 Geneva Motor Show, the A5 marked Audi&#x27;s return to the compact executive coupé market after the (B3/B4) Audi 80-based coupé ended production in 1996. On May 10, 2006, Audi confirmed that the A5 would go into production. The B6/B7 A4 included a convertible variant but no coupé. For the fourth-generation A4 (B8), Audi decided to spin off the cabriolet, along with a new coupé and four-door fastback sedan, into a distinct nameplate as the A5.

The A5 was the first vehicle in the B8 family to be released (the others being the A4 and the Q5 crossover SUV), all of which were based on the Audi MLP (Modular Longitudinal Platform). This platform underpins the next-generation A6 and A8.

The A5 is the third coupé in Audi&#x27;s lineup, following the second-generation TT and the R8. It adopted design elements from the Nuvolari quattro concept car and debuted with a 3.2-litre FSI V6 engine, delivering .

====Coupé (8T3)====

The A5 and S5 design was based on the Nuvolari quattro concept car. The A5 and the S5 Coupé were unveiled simultaneously at the Salon International de l&#x27;Auto (Geneva) and the Melbourne International Motor Shows on March 6, 2007.

Orders for the A5 and S5 began the same day as their unveiling, March 6, 2007; the first deliveries were made in June 2007. Launch models included the 3.2-litre FSI V6 engine multitronic and the 3.0-litre TDI quattro 6-speed, with the 1.8-litre TFSI available in autumn 2007.

Early U.S. models included the A5 3.2-litre FSI quattro and the S5 coupé 4.2-litre FSI quattro. Both included either a six-speed manual or a six-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. The S5 model went on sale in November 2007, initially equipped only with a manual transmission, while the A5 with Tiptronic became available in early spring 2008.

The A5 went on sale in Canada in 2008, featuring the A5 3.2-litre FSI with a choice of a six-speed manual or six-speed Tiptronic transmission. Since 2011, only the 2.0-litre turbo engines have been available for the A5 in Canada. In 2013, Audi introduced the A5 Black Edition.

====Cabriolet (8F)====
Production of both the Audi A5 and the S5 Cabriolet (convertible) began in early 2009. The A5 Cabriolet included a fabric roof as opposed to the retractable hardtop used on the Volkswagen Eos. The engine range was the same as contemporary A5 coupé models, but the S5 Cabriolet featured a 3.0 TFSI V6 supercharged engine.

The A5 Cabriolet replaced the A4 Cabriolet. Deliveries of the A5 Cabriolet began in the second quarter of 2009. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 New York Auto Show.

The U.S. versions of the A5 and S5 Cabriolet went on sale in September 2009 as 2010 models. Early models included the A5 2.0-litre I4 TFSI Multitronic, A5 2.0-litre quattro Tiptronic, and S5 quattro S-Tronic.

====Sportback (8T8)====
The A5 Sportback has four frameless doors and a long, tapering fastback-like roofline, giving it a &#x27;four-door coupé-like&#x27; appearance. While it shares many exterior design cues with the A5 coupé, the Sportback&#x27;s interior is similar to that of the A4 saloon. Although all A5 models share the same platform as the A4, the Sportback is closer in design to the A4 than to the rest of the A5 family.

The Sportback has been described as &#x27;a saloon with the front end (including an identical S-line look) and taillights of the A5 coupé but the wheelbase of the A4,&#x27; with the Sportback positioned more as a &#x27;designer&#x27;s car&#x27; compared to the more conventional A4 saloon.

The Sportback model is available in Europe, Japan, South Korea, China, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, Mexico, Argentina, and South Africa. Although not originally sold in the United States and Canada, the A5 Sportback entered the North American market as a 2018 model at the beginning of 2017.

Early production models included the 2.0-litre TFSI quattro , 3.2-litre FSI quattro, 2.0-litre TDI with a six-speed manual gearbox and start/stop system, 2.7-litre TDI, and the 3.0-litre TDI quattro. Production versions went on sale in September 2009.

The A5 Sportback is available with two petrol engines and three diesel engines.
====S5 (2007)====


The Audi S5 was released in coupé form to the public at the same time as the A5. The Audi S5, in comparison to the A5, features a different fascia (as do most Audi S and RS models), including a string of LED daytime running lights around the bi-Xenon headlamps and a vertically striped chrome grille.

In many markets, the S5 includes as standard, 19-inch alloy wheels with a five parallel spoke design, bigger brakes, heated leather sport seats, and other convenience features, some of which are available only as an option on the A5. Changes for the 2010 model year include LED tail lamps, the introduction of Premium Plus and Prestige trim levels, and new optional equipment such as Leather/Alcantara seats.

Despite sharing the same nameplate, the powertrains were different between the coupé and the Cabriolet/Sportback for the 2010–12 model years. The 2010–12 Audi S5 coupé had a 4.2 litre fuel stratified injection (FSI) V8 engine that produces , while the S5 Cabriolet and Sportback have a supercharged 3.0 litre TFSI V6 engine producing which is shared with the 2010 Audi S4 3.0 TFSI quattro sedan and avant.

The coupé had a choice of either a six speed manual or six speed Tiptronic automatic, while the Cabriolet/Sportback has the seven speed S-tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission.

====Aluminium A5 Coupé====
The Aluminium A5 Coupé is a prototype vehicle demonstrating the aluminum Audi Space Frame (ASF) concept. It is based on Audi A5 Coupé 2.0 TFSI with engine, but it uses the aluminum Audi Space Frame, aluminum and carbon fibre-reinforced plastics body. Punch riveting, bonding or laser-MIG hybrid welding replaced spot welding. The vehicle is lighter than the equivalent steel-bodied production model.

The vehicle was built by Audi&#x27;s Aluminium and Lightweight Design Centre in Neckarsulm.

====RS5 (2010)====

==Third generation (2024)==

On 16 July 2024, Audi replaced the A4/S4 Saloon and Avant with the A5/S5 as part of Audi&#x27;s new strategy of allocating even numbers to electric vehicles and odd numbers to combustion cars.

A coupé or convertible version are no longer offered. The saloon is now equipped with a liftback and thus replaces both the A4 saloon and the A5 Sportback of the previous generation. The ‘Avant’ estate is still available.

The A5 B10 is the first model based on the Premium Platform Combustion (PPC). Like all other vehicles based on the PPC and PPE, it uses the E³ 1.2 software platform developed by Volkswagen subsidiary Cariad.

=== Engines ===
The engines used are 2-litre in-line four-cylinder petrol engines from the EA888 series, 3-litre V6 petrol engines from the EA839 series and 2-litre in-line four-cylinder diesel engines from the EA288 evo series. The power output ranges from 110 kW / 280 Nm in the entry-level petrol engine up to 270 kW / 550 Nm in the top-range S5 model. Only 7-speed dual-clutch gearboxes are used. Manual gearboxes are no longer fitted. Instead of fake tailpipe covers as in the previous generation, only real tailpipes are fitted in response to customer feedback. The A5 B10 is the first model series to use Audi&#x27;s advanced second-generation mild hybrid called ‘MHEV plus technology’. In addition to the familiar belt starter generator, a new powertrain generator with integrated power electronics is placed on the transmission output shaft. In combination with the 48-volt battery, this enables partially electric driving with up to 18 kW of power and 230 Nm of torque. The powertrain generator recuperates energy back into the battery at up to 25 kW. The battery is positioned above the rear axle and has a separate cooling circuit. Overall, the system is designed to increase the fuel efficiency.

<text>Gaurishankar (also Gauri Sankar or Gauri Shankar; ; Sherpa: Jomo Tseringma), a mountain in the Nepal Himalayas, is the second highest peak of the Rolwaling Himal, behind Melungtse (7,181 m). The name comes from the Hindu goddess Gauri, a manifestation of Parvati, and her consort Shankar, denoting the sacred regard it is afforded by the people of Nepal. The Sherpas name the mountain as Jomo Tseringma. The Nepal Standard Time (GMT+05:45) is based on the meridian of this mountain peak.

==Location==
Gaurishankar lies near the western edge of the Rolwaling Himal, about northeast of Kathmandu. (It is almost directly between Kathmandu and Mount Everest, and is visible from Kathmandu.) To the west of the peak lies the valley of the Bhote Kosi, the western boundary of the Rolwaling Himal. To the north lies the Menlung Chu, which separates it from its sister peak Melungtse. To the south lies the Rolwaling Chu, which leads up to the Tesi Lapcha pass, giving access to the Khumbu region. It is in Dolakha District.

==Notable features==
The mountain has two summits, the northern (higher) summit being called Shankar (a manifestation of Shiva) and the southern summit being called Gauri (a manifestation of Shiva&#x27;s consort). It rises dramatically above the Bhote Kosi only 5 km away, and is protected on all sides by steep faces and long, corniced ridges.

==Climbing history==
The first attempts to climb Gauri Sankar were made in the 1950s and 1960s but weather, avalanches and difficult ice faces defeated all parties. From 1965 until 1979, the mountain was officially closed for climbing. When permission was finally granted in 1979, an American-Nepalese expedition finally managed to gain the top, via the West Face. This was a route of extreme technical difficulty. The permit from the Nepalese Ministry of Tourism stipulated that the summit could only be reached if an equal number of climbers from both nations were on the summit team. John Roskelley and Dorje Sherpa fulfilled that obligation.

In the same year, a British-Nepalese expedition led by Peter Boardman climbed the long and difficult Southwest Ridge. Boardman, Tim Leach, Guy Neidhardt, and Pemba Lama made it to the south &quot;Gauri&quot; summit (7010 m) on November 8, 1979. Though they did not make the long additional traverse to the main &quot;Shankar&quot; summit, their climb was a significant achievement in itself.

In 1983 Gaurishankar was reached again by a Slovenian team. The main summit (7134 m) was reached on November 1 by Slavko Cankar (expedition leader), Bojan Šrot and Smiljan Smodiš; and three days later by Franco Pepevnik and Jože Zupan. They climbed the left side of the South Face to reach the Southwest Ridge, then continuing to the main summit.

The Himalayan Index lists only two additional ascents of the main summit of Gauri Sankar. The second ascent was made in the spring of 1984 by Wyman Culbreth and Ang Kami Sherpa, via a new route on a ridge on the southwest face. The third ascent (and the first winter ascent), in January 1986, was by South Korean Choi Han-Jo and Ang Kami Sherpa.

In the fall of 2013, the complete south face was finally climbed by a four-man team of French climbers. After reaching the top of the south face at 4 pm on October 21, they decided not to continue to the 7,010 m south summit. It took them 11 hours to descend to the bottom of the face.

== Cultural reference ==
A passing reference to Gaurishankar is made in the poem &quot;Som dreng skar jeg skibe&quot; by Johannes V. Jensen.

<text>Mount Morgan is a rural town and locality in the Rockhampton Region, Queensland, Australia. 
The town was the administrative centre of the Mount Morgan Shire until March 2008, when it was amalgamated with neighbouring local government areas to form the Rockhampton Region.

In the , the town of Mount Morgan had a population of 2,487 people, while the locality of Mount Morgan had a population of 2,018 people.

== Geography ==
The town of Mount Morgan is situated on the Dee River, south of the city of Rockhampton, and is north of the state capital, Brisbane. The Burnett Highway passes through the town.

There are a number of neighbourhoods within the locality:

* Gordon Vale ()

* Kenbula (), located around the former Kenbula railway station

* Talban (), located around the former Talban railway station

The names &quot;Kenbula&quot; and &quot;Talban&quot; were both assigned by the Queensland Railway Department on 18 November 1911. Both are Aboriginal names, &quot;Kenbula&quot; meaning &quot;ironbark tree&quot; and &quot;Talban&quot; meaning &quot;stone curlew&quot;.

== History ==
Prior to European migrants settling in the area, the area was part of the Kangulu peoples traditional lands.

Mount Morgan was founded as a gold mining town in 1882. The town takes its name from the family who took out the original gold mining leases in the area: Frederick Augustus Morgan and his brothers Thomas Squire Morgan and Edwin Francis Morgan.

Over the years, the Mount Morgan Mine has produced gold, silver and copper. Among those making a fortune from this mine was William Knox D&#x27;Arcy. D&#x27;Arcy used his fortune to finance oil exploration in Iran, which led to the formation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (now BP).

Mining of clay in a nearby hill for the production of furnace bricks commenced soon after that time, continuing until the early 1900s, The resulting man-made caves came to be known as the Fireclay Caverns, which contained large openings that measure between 4–12 metres in height from the cave floor. Dinosaur footprints (preserved as infills) were later found in nine different sections of the Fireclay Caverns, lining the ceiling dated to the Early Jurassic (Sinemurian).

Mount Morgan Post Office opened on 18 May 1885 (a receiving office had been open from 1884).

Mount Morgan Central State School opened in 1887 and grew so rapidly that it was separated into two schools on different sites the following year, forming Mount Morgan Boys State School and Mount Morgan Girls and Infants State School. The word &#x27;Central&#x27; was added to the name of these two schools from 1911. They were amalgamated back into one school in 1929.

The town of Mount Morgan grew in a haphazard fashion around the entrance to the mining lease near the Dee River from the early 1880s. By 1889 a number of the major religions had established congregations and erected churches including the Primitive Methodists (1885), the Catholics (1887) and the Anglicans (1889). That year the town&#x27;s name was formally changed from &#x27;South Calliungal&#x27; to &#x27;Mount Morgan&#x27;, and by 1891 the Queensland census recorded a population of 3514.

Circa 1888-1889 an Anglican church opened in Mount Morgan.
Until the arrival of the railway in 1898, everything was transported by horse teams. The Mount Morgan Mining Company had a depot in Quay Street, where the wagoners would load up. Initially, there were two routes to Rockhampton, one via Crocodile (now Bouldercombe) and the other via Kabra, Boongarry and Moonmera. In 1885, a road was built over the Razorback Range.

The railway line between Mount Morgan and Rockhampton opened on 26 November 1898, with two railway stations serving the locality:

* Mount Morgan railway station, now abandoned ()
* Walterhall railway station, now abandoned ()

Like many Australian towns, in 1899 to 1900, the Siege of Mafeking was avidly followed in the news in Mount Morgan. With every confidence in a British victory, in March 1900, the town&#x27;s people decided to prepare to celebrate the relief of Mafeking as soon as it was announced. The town band was to assemble immediately on the corner of East and Morgan Streets and other entertainments were arranged, such as a bonfire and a greasy pig. On 20 May 1900, on hearing the news of the relief of Mafeking, bonfires were lit on the hills around the town, the bands were playing, and patriotic speeches were made. The celebrations did not end there, as by November 1900, a &quot;Mafeking&quot; bell had been installed in a tower beside the town hall. The bell had been cast at the Mount Morgan Mine and weighed 7 cwt (360 kg). The sound of the bell was described as &quot;blood curdling&quot; and led to arguments as to whether the bell was cracked. By 1955, the wooden tower had rotted and the bell was taken down to be relocated to the verandah of the town hall. In 1969 the bell was relocated to the scout hall in Dee Street as the army leader at Mafeking was Lord Baden-Powell who established the Scouting movement in 1907. In February 2018, the bell was returned to the main street of Mount Morgan as part of a streetscape redevelopment project. There is a popular story that the schoolchildren of Mount Isa funded the bell by donating pennies (either to pay for it or to be melted down to construct it), but the earliest sources so far identified for this story are from 1955, 55 years after the bell was cast, and the commemorative plaque which also presents this story was not created until 1962.

Sacred Heart Catholic Primary School opened in 1891 and closed in 1997.
Red Hill State School opened on 1900 and closed circa 1931. It was in the Red Hill neighbourhood of Mount Morgan, and presumably is the origin of the name of School Street (approx ).

In 1902, a Baptist church opened in Mount Morgan. Prior to the opening of the church, Baptist services had been held in the Forester&#x27;s Hall. In April 1902 the Port Curtis Road Methodist Church building was purchased for removal and erected on the corner of East and Dee Streets in Mount Morgan. The stump-capping ceremony was held on Saturday 12 May 1902. The official opening of the church was on Sunday 22 June 1902.

Mount Morgan State High School opened on 22 January 1912. It was the first school of its kind to open in Queensland.

Maranu State School opened on 24 May 1915. It closed on 1 April 1927.

Upper Dee Provisional School opened in 1919. On 11 June 1923, it became Upper Dee State School. It closed circa 1929.

The Mount Morgan Mine finally closed in November 1990, having produced 250 tonnes of gold and 360,000 tonnes of copper during its lifetime, leaving 134 million tonnes of waste rock and tailings. During the mining operation, most of the mountain was mined away, and the town now lies adjacent to a 43 m deep acid-water filled pit. The Queensland Government have begun a rehabilitation project of the minesite.

The Mount Morgan Public Library opened in 1993.

In December 2020, a 24 kilometre mountain bike trail network was completed around No. 7 Dam, creating a new sporting facility for the area, as part of the Advancing Mount Morgan strategy with an aim to help boost tourism to the town.

In 2021, the town&#x27;s water supply was so low, drinking water had to be delivered on daily basis.

== Attractions ==
Tourism plays a large part in the economy of the town today, with a visitor centre located at the old railway centre and recreation area at Dam No.7. The area was host to one of the few rack railways (as part of the line from Mount Morgan to Rockhampton) to operate in Australia. The rack portion of the line was replaced by a conventional adhesion railway in the 1950s, with a small portion of track retained at the town centre. In turn, the replacement line was closed in 1987, and the town no longer has a rail connection. The Mount Morgan railway station is still standing and now operates as a Museum and Tourist Information Centre. There is a regular bus service between Rockhampton, Gracemere and Mount Morgan provided by Young&#x27;s Bus Service.

<text>Selva () is a coastal comarca (county) in the Girona region of Catalonia (Spain), located between the mountain range known as the Serralada Transversal or Puigsacalm and the Costa Brava (part of the Mediterranean coast). Following the Spanish province system, it is divided between the provinces of Girona and Barcelona, with Fogars de la Selva being part of Barcelona province and all other municipalities falling inside the Girona province.

Its capital, Santa Coloma de Farners, is no longer among its larger municipalities, with the coastal towns of Blanes and Lloret de Mar having far surpassed it in size. Selva borders the comarques of Maresme, Vallès Oriental, Osona, Garrotxa, Gironès, and Baix Empordà.

<text>Melungtse (; ; ; other English spelling: &quot;Menlungtse&quot;) is the highest mountain of the Rolwaling Himal in the Himalayas.

The peak has a long summit ridge capped by the east (main) summit and the west summit, also known as Melungtse II, 7,023m. The mountain&#x27;s steep faces make it more difficult than its elevation would suggest.

==Location==

Melungtse lies just north of the Nepal–China border, on a western spur ridge coming out of the main north-south trending ridge of the Rolwaling Himal, in Tingri County, Shigatse Prefecture of Tibet. To the southwest, across the Menlung Chu, lies Gauri Sankar, which, though a bit lower (7134 m), is much more visible from Nepal, hence better-known. Melungtse lies about 40 km west of Mount Everest.

==Climbing history==
Melungtse was off limits to climbing until quite recently. The first attempt was made in Oct 1982 when Bill Denz made a strictly illegal attempt on the southeast ridge, after sneaking over the border from Nepal&#x27;s Rolwaling Valley. However he turned back while still low on the route. In 1987 and 1988 Chris Bonington led two expeditions, with the second one succeeding in putting Andy Fanshawe and Alan Hinkes on the west summit, but did not climb the main summit. Another attempt in 1990, this time on the East Ridge of the main summit, failed well below the top.

The first ascent of the main peak came in 1992. Slovenians Marko Prezelj and Andrej Štremfelj ascended the dangerous, 2000m southeast face in less than two and a half days up and down.

The Himalayan Index lists only one other attempt on Melungtse, a failed attempt via the North Face in 1999.

<text>Verenium Corporation was a San Diego, California-based industrial biotechnology company founded in 2007 as the result of a merger between Diversa (San Diego) and Celunol (Cambridge, MA). The company specialized in research and development for the production of high performance enzymes used in industrial applications, including biofuel generation, hydraulic fracturing. Verenium was acquired by BASF corporation in 2013. The company&#x27;s tailored enzymes are environmentally friendly, making products and processes greener and more cost-effective for industries including the global food and fuel markets.

Using proprietary and patented genomic technologies, BASF extracts microbial DNA directly from collected samples to avoid the slow and often impossible task of growing microbes in the laboratory. BASF then mines its collection of microbial genes, numbering in the billions, using high-throughput screening technologies designed to identify unique enzymes as product candidates. As required, these enzymes can then be further optimized for commercial use through the company&#x27;s patented DirectEvolution technologies. By combining discovery and laboratory evolution technologies, Verenium successfully developed and commercialized a suite of highly differentiated enzyme products tailored to meet the specific needs of companies in various markets, including grain processing, biofuels, animal health and nutrition and other industries. These enzymes products are now offered by BASF.

On September 20, 2013, Verenium entered an agreement to be acquired by BASF, with a 71% acquisition of Verenium.

<text>Gyachung Kang (, &quot;Gyāchung Kāng&quot;; ) is a mountain in the Mahalangur Himal section of the Himalayas and is the highest peak between Cho Oyu (8,201 m) and Mount Everest (8,848 m). It lies on the border between Nepal and China. As the 15th highest peak in the world, it is also the co highest peak (with Gasherbrum III) that is not an eight-thousander; hence, it is far less well-known than the lowest of the eight-thousanders, which are only about higher. The peak&#x27;s lack of significant prominence (700 m) also contributes to its relative obscurity.

== Climbing history ==
The mountain was first climbed on April 10, 1964, by Y. Kato, K. Sakaizawa, Pasang Phutar, K. Machida and K. Yasuhisa.

The north face was first climbed in 1999 by a Slovene expedition and was repeated by Yasushi Yamanoi in 2002.

<doc id="643639" wikidata="Q710862" url="?curid=643639" title="Brian Keith">
<text>Robert Alba Keith (November 14, 1921 – June 24, 1997), known professionally as Brian Keith, was an American film, television, and stage actor who in his six-decade career gained recognition for his work in films such as the Disney family film &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1961); &quot;Johnny Shiloh&quot; (1963); the comedy &quot;The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming&quot; (1966); and the adventure saga &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot; (1975), in which he portrayed President Theodore Roosevelt.

On television, two of his best-known roles were those of bachelor-uncle-turned-reluctant-parent Bill Davis in the 1960s sitcom &quot;Family Affair&quot;, and a tough retired judge in the lighthearted 1980s crime drama &quot;Hardcastle and McCormick&quot;. He also starred in &quot;The Brian Keith Show&quot;, which aired on NBC from 1972 to 1974, where he portrayed a pediatrician who operated a free clinic on Oahu, and in the CBS comedy series &quot;Heartland&quot;.

==Early life==
Robert Alba Keith was born in Bayonne, New Jersey, on November 14, 1921, to actor Robert Keith and stage actress Helena Shipman, a native of Aberdeen, Washington. Some sources also list his full name as Brian Robert Keith. He was Roman Catholic. In 1941 he graduated from East Rockaway High School in East Rockaway, New York.

He joined the United States Marine Corps in 1942 completing his service in 1945. He served during World War II as a radioman/tail gunner in the rear cockpit of a two-man Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bomber in a U.S. Marine squadron. He was awarded a Combat Aircrew Insignia, Air Medal, Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal with three battle stars and World War II Victory Medal.

==Career==

===Theatre===
Keith made his Broadway debut in 1948 in the ensemble of &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, which starred his father as &quot;Doc&quot;. He was a guard in &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; (1951) by Sidney Kingsley, and was in &quot;Out West of Eighth&quot; (1951), which had only a short run.

===Television and films===
Keith made his film debut at age 3 in &quot;Pied Piper Malone&quot;. He began to guest star on shows such as &quot;Hands of Mystery&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the Cloak&quot;, and an adaptation of &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; in &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot;. He was in &quot;Police Story&quot;, &quot;Suspense&quot;, &quot;Eye Witness&quot;, &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, and &quot;The Motorola Television Hour&quot;. Keith&#x27;s feature film debut was in a Western for Paramount, &quot;Arrowhead&quot; (1953). He stayed at that studio for &quot;Alaska Seas&quot; (1954), replacing Van Heflin, and &quot;Jivaro&quot; (1954).

Keith guest starred on &quot;Campbell Summer Soundstage&quot;, &quot;The Pepsi-Cola Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, and &quot;The Mask&quot; and also played Mike Hammer in a television pilot directed by Blake Edwards, but the series was not picked up.

He went to Columbia for &quot;The Bamboo Prison&quot; (1954), &quot;The Violent Men&quot; (1955), &quot;Tight Spot&quot; (1955), and &quot;5 Against the House&quot; (1955), the last two directed by Phil Karlson. He was meant to support Joan Crawford in &quot;Queen Bee&quot;, but did not appear in the final film.

He guest starred on &quot;The Elgin Hour&quot;, &quot;Mystery Is My Business&quot;, &quot;Jane Wyman Presents The Fireside Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Box Brothers&quot;, &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;Wire Service&quot; and &quot;Studio 57&quot;.

In 1955, Keith starred in his own series, &quot;Crusader&quot;, as fictional journalist Matt Anders. He continued to appear in films for Columbia, such as &quot;Storm Center&quot; (1956) co-starring with Bette Davis and &quot;Nightfall&quot; (1956) with Aldo Ray.

In June 1956, he announced he had formed his own company, Michael Productions, and had optioned a story by Robert Blees called &quot;Cairo&quot;.

===Film stardom===
Keith was second billed in &quot;Dino&quot; (1957) with Sal Mineo, and &quot;Run of the Arrow&quot; (1957) with Rod Steiger. He was top billed in &quot;Chicago Confidential&quot; (1957), but returned to supporting parts with &quot;Appointment with a Shadow&quot; (1957) &quot;Hell Canyon Outlaws&quot; (1957), and &quot;Fort Dobbs&quot; (1958). He announced he would make &quot;Alien Virus&quot; for his Michael Productions, but it was not made. Keith was top billed in some low-budget action movies: &quot;Violent Road&quot; (1958), &quot;Desert Hell&quot; (1958), &quot;Sierra Baron&quot; (1958), and &quot;Villa!!&quot; (1958). The last two were shot back-to-back in Mexico. He guest starred on &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;Laramie&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, and an episode of &quot;Zane Grey Theater&quot;, which was written and directed by Sam Peckinpah and later led to &quot;The Westerner&quot;.

===&quot;The Westerner&quot; and Disney===
Keith supported Paul Newman in &quot;The Young Philadelphians&quot; (1959), and had the lead in two productions for Disney, the TV show &quot;Elfego Baca: Move Along, Mustangers&quot; (1959) and the feature &quot;Ten Who Dared&quot; (1960). In 1960, he won acclaim for his starring role in Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s extremely hard-bitten, adult, and short-lived series &quot;The Westerner&quot; (1960). The show aired for only 13 episodes. &quot;Only four or five of those were any good&quot;, said Keith later. &quot;But those four or five were as good as anything anybody has ever done.&quot; Keith guest starred in: &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;The Americans&quot;, &quot;Frontier Circus&quot;, &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot;, &quot;Outlaws&quot;, &quot;Follow the Sun&quot;, and &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; again. Keith made a second film for Disney, playing the father of twins in the film &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1961), costarring Hayley Mills and Maureen O&#x27;Hara, which was a huge hit. Critical acclaim was given to &quot;The Deadly Companions&quot; (1961), a Western with O&#x27;Hara, which marked Peckinpah&#x27;s feature directorial debut. Keith did two more films for Disney, &quot;Moon Pilot&quot; (1962) and &quot;Savage Sam&quot; (1963).

He guest starred on &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;Sam Benedict&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Great Adventure&quot;, and &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;. Keith did a Western for Universal, &quot;The Raiders&quot; (1963), then returned to Disney for &quot;Johnny Shiloh&quot; (1963), &quot;Bristle Face&quot; (1964), &quot;The Tenderfoot&quot; (1964), &quot;A Tiger Walks&quot; (1964), and &quot;Those Calloways&quot; (1965).

He went to Fox for &quot;The Pleasure Seekers&quot; (1964) and had support roles in &quot;The Hallelujah Trail&quot; (1965), &quot;The Rare Breed&quot; (1966) (again with O&#x27;Hara), and &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; (1966), co-starring with Steve McQueen as traveling gunsmith Jonas Cord. Keith did the comedies &quot;The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!&quot; (1966) for Norman Jewison, &quot;Way... Way Out&quot; (1966) with Jerry Lewis, and &quot;With Six You Get Eggroll&quot; (1968) with Doris Day.

===&quot;Family Affair&quot;===

In 1966, Keith landed the role of Uncle Bill Davis on CBS&#x27;s popular television situation comedy &quot;Family Affair&quot;. This role earned him three Emmy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Comedy Series. The show made him a household name. It was in the vein of successful 1960s and 1970s sitcoms that dealt with widowhood and/or many single-parent issues, such as &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, &quot;Julia&quot;, &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot;, &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, and &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;. During its first season in 1966, &quot;Family Affair&quot; was an immediate hit, ranking number 15 in the Nielsen ratings. By the end of its fifth season, in 1971, &quot;Family Affair&quot; still had high ratings, but was cancelled after 138 episodes.

Kathy Garver, who co-starred as Keith&#x27;s teenaged niece, Cissy, on &quot;Family Affair&quot;, indicated that Keith said: &quot;I&#x27;m a cultural Irishman, don&#x27;t you know, I&#x27;m a cultural Irishman.&quot; Garver explained: &quot;But he went through many manifestations and changes of character, during the five years that we shot. At first, he was up and then his second year, he was going through a divorce, and then, the third year, he met somebody else, and he became more anecdotal and told stories that he loved kids, and he was very outspoken about those that he did not like. So, he was a very interesting character and it was Brian and Sebastian Cabot [who played Mr. French] had such a different style of acting and that&#x27;s another reason I think that &quot;Family Affair&quot; was so popular and stayed as it did. Both excellent actors, both coming from very different methods and styles of acting with Sebastian was more from the classical style and he would take home his script and he would dutifully look at every single word and have it to perfection, and then Brian would come in and say, &#x27;Oh what do we have today? Let me see the scene, uh-huh, uh-huh, let&#x27;s go!&#x27; So he was very improvisational, motion of the moment. And those two different styles really worked out for each of them very well.&quot;

During the series&#x27; run Keith appeared in &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot; (1967) with Marlon Brando, &quot;With Six You Get Eggroll&quot; (1968) with Doris Day, &quot;&quot; (1968) for Cinerama, and &quot;Gaily, Gaily&quot; (1969) for Norman Jewison. He had leading roles in &quot;Suppose They Gave a War and Nobody Came?&quot; (1970) for Cinerama and &quot;The McKenzie Break&quot; (1970). In 1970, Keith moved to Hawaii. Keith made &quot;Scandalous John&quot; (1971) for Disney, &quot;Something Big&quot; (1972) with Dean Martin and director Andrew McLaglen, and the TV movie &quot;Second Chance&quot; (1972).

===&quot;The Brian Keith Show&quot;, &quot;The Zoo Gang&quot;, &quot;Archer&quot;===
Keith went on to star as pediatrician Dr. Sean Jamison in the NBC sitcom &quot;The Brian Keith Show&quot; (also known as &quot;The Little People&quot;). The series was cancelled in 1974 after two seasons. &quot;The show ended because it was bad, not because of Hawaii,&quot; said Keith.

Keith also starred in the role of Steven &quot;The Fox&quot; Halliday in the six-part television miniseries, &quot;The Zoo Gang&quot; (1974), about a group of former underground French Resistance fighters from World War II. The show also starred Sir John Mills, Lilli Palmer, and Barry Morse, and featured a theme by Paul McCartney. Keith was third billed in &quot;The Yakuza&quot; (1974) starring Robert Mitchum, and in &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot; (1975) starring Sean Connery, Keith played President Theodore Roosevelt for writer-director John Milius. He starred in the TV series &quot;Archer&quot; (1975) as Lew Archer, replacing Peter Graves who&#x27;d starred in the pilot, but it was cancelled after six episodes and has never been rerun in the United States (Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s score for the first episode of the series was released in 2018 by Lalaland Records). Keith did some Westerns, &quot;The Quest&quot; (1976) pilot, and &quot;Joe Panther&quot; (1976), and the TV movie &quot;The Loneliest Runner&quot; (1976). He had a supporting role in &quot;Nickelodeon&quot; (1976) and did the TV movies &quot;In the Matter of Karen Ann Quinlan&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Court-Martial of George Armstrong Custer&quot; (1977). He was in &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1978), &quot;Hooper&quot; (1978) with Burt Reynolds, &quot;Centennial&quot; (1979), and &quot;The Chisholms&quot; (1979). In 1992, he starred in the unsold, ABC half-hour pilot &quot;The Streets of Beverly Hills&quot;.

Keith spoke fluent Russian, which led to his casting as a Russian in two roles: as a Soviet scientist in the film &quot;Meteor&quot; (1979) with Natalie Wood (who also spoke fluent Russian and played his translator), and as the Soviet premier in the NBC miniseries &quot;World War III&quot; (1982) with Rock Hudson. He replaced Barnard Hughes on Broadway in &quot;Da&quot; and was on &quot;The Seekers&quot; (1979), &quot;Power&quot; (1980), &quot;The Silent Lovers&quot; (1980), &quot;The Mountain Men&quot; (1980) with Charlton Heston, and &quot;Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen&quot; (1981). Of the latter he joked, &quot;I only did the picture because it had a long title, and I seem to specialize in those.&quot; He had support roles in &quot;Sharky&#x27;s Machine&quot; (1981) with Burt Reynolds and &quot;Cry for the Strangers&quot; (1982).

===&quot;Hardcastle and McCormick&quot;, &quot;Pursuit of Happiness&quot;, and &quot;Heartland&quot;===
Keith once again returned to series television in 1983, with &quot;Hardcastle and McCormick&quot;, in the role of a cranky retired judge named Milton C. Hardcastle. Daniel Hugh Kelly co-starred as ex-con Mark McCormick in this ABC crime drama with elements of comedy. The chemistry of Keith and Kelly was a hit, and the series lasted three years until its cancellation in 1986. During the series run, Keith was in &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and &quot;The B.R.A.T. Patrol&quot; (1986). Keith starred in &quot;The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory&quot; (1987) (as Davy Crockett), and &quot;Death Before Dishonor&quot;, then did another TV series &quot;Pursuit of Happiness&quot; (1987–88), which ran 10 episodes. He was in &quot;After the Rain&quot; (1988), &quot;Young Guns&quot; (1988), and &quot;Perry Mason: The Case of the Lethal Lesson&quot; (1989). He starred in another short-lived series &quot;Heartland&quot; (1989). He had roles in &quot;Welcome Home&quot; (1989), and &quot;Lady in the Corner&quot; (1989).

===Later career===
Keith made a guest appearance in the &quot;Evening Shade&quot; season-one episode &quot;Chip Off The Old Brick&quot; (1991), as the loud-mouthed father of Herman Stiles (played by actor Michael Jeter). He reprised his character from &quot;The Westerner&quot; in &quot;The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw&quot; (1991) (which featured numerous actors from 1950s TV series playing their original roles in brief cameos), had the lead in &quot;Walter &amp; Emily&quot; (1991), a short-lived sitcom, and &quot;The Streets of Beverly Hills&quot; (1992), a pilot. Brian Keith appeared on a two-part episode of &quot;Major Dad&quot;, season four &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot; as the Major&#x27;s (Gerald McRaney) domineering father who pays a visit to the family. The episode aired on September 25, 1992. Keith performed the role of Mullibok on the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; season-one episode entitled &quot;Progress&quot; (1993), in which an elderly farmer resists forcible relocation by Bajoran authorities.

Among his last performances were &quot;The Secrets of Lake Success&quot;; &quot;Wind Dancer&quot;; &quot;The Commish&quot;; &quot;Under a Killing Moon&quot; (1994); &quot;The Return of Hunter: Everyone Walks in L.A.&quot; (1995); &quot;The Monroes&quot;; &quot;Favorite Deadly Sins&quot; (1995); &quot;Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story&quot; (1996); &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;; &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;; and &quot;The Second Civil War&quot; (1997). Keith guest-starred in an episode of the TV series &quot;The Marshal&quot; titled &quot;The Bounty Hunter&quot; (1995) in which he played then Wichita, Kansas, Police Chief Rick Stone under the stage name of Chief Skoblow. The Wichita Police Department cooperated with the Canadian TV production company by providing details of Chief Stone&#x27;s actual police dress uniform for Keith to wear during the episode. Keith also provided the voice of Ben Parker on &quot;Spider-Man: The Animated Series&quot;.

In his last film, Keith played President William McKinley in &quot;Rough Riders&quot; (1997). Director John Milius dedicated the film to &quot;Brian Keith, Actor, Marine, Raconteur.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Keith married three times. He was married to Frances Helm from 1948 to 1954, Judy Landon from 1954 to 1969 and Victoria Young-Keith from 1970 until his death. He had seven children, one of whom died by suicide six weeks prior to his death.

On June 24, 1997, at the age of 75, Keith died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home in Malibu, California. He suffered from emphysema and lung cancer during the latter part of his life, despite having quit smoking ten years earlier. He reportedly also struggled with financial problems and suffered from depression throughout his final days.

Keith&#x27;s friend Maureen O&#x27;Hara did not believe Keith died as a result of suicide. She stated that he had a large gun collection and he might have been cleaning the gun, or looking at it, when it went off accidentally. She had just visited him and said he was in good spirits and would not have committed suicide given his Catholic beliefs.

Keith&#x27;s private funeral was attended by &quot;Family Affair&quot; co-stars Kathy Garver and Johnny Whitaker, and &quot;Hardcastle and McCormick&quot; co-star Daniel Hugh Kelly. His ashes were interred next to those of his daughter Daisy at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

==Legacy==
On June 26, 2008, Brian Keith received a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

She attended Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh for one year before moving to New York City at age 19 to study acting with Uta Hagen at HB Studio.

==Career==

Finneran&#x27;s biggest film role was as Judy Rose in the remake of George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. Her film credits include &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot;, &quot;Chicken Little&quot;, &quot;Liberty Heights&quot;, &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous&quot;, and &quot;Death to Smoochy&quot;.

===Television===
She co-starred in television series &quot;Wonderfalls&quot;. She was also featured as a part of the cast on the Fox show &quot;The Inside&quot;, in the short-lived CBS sitcom &quot;Bram &amp; Alice&quot;, and in many guest roles in shows like &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Sex and the City&quot; and &quot;Oz&quot;. In 2007 Finneran was featured in the new series &quot;Drive&quot;. She played the sister of the main character, Alex Tully (Nathan Fillion).

In an interview for the DVD of the full series of &quot;Wonderfalls&quot;, Finneran said that when asked if she felt nervous about playing lesbian immigration attorney Sharon Tyler on &quot;Wonderfalls&quot; she replied, &quot;I&#x27;d rather have people think that I&#x27;m a lesbian than a lawyer.&quot;

<text>The White River is a river in the South Island of New Zealand.

It drains from the eastern flanks of the Southern Alps / Kā Tiritiri o te Moana into the Waimakariri River. It is accessible by getting to Klondike Corner on State Highway 73, following the Waimakariri up to Carrington Hut, and turning west. The most common reason for travelling up the White river is to get to Barker Hut, a base for climbing Mounts Murchison, Wakeman and Harper. Following the river to its source takes the traveller to White Col.</text><links>

<doc id="643646" wikidata="Q1129914" url="?curid=643646" title="Libya (daughter of Epaphus)">
<text>Libya () is the daughter of Epaphus, King of Egypt, in both Greek and Roman mythology. She personified the land of Ancient Libya in North Africa, from which the name of modern-day Libya originated.

==Mythology==

Libya, like Ethiopia or Scythia was one of the mythic outlands that encircled the familiar Greek world of the Hellenes and their &quot;foreign&quot; neighbors.

Personified as an individual, Libya was the daughter of Epaphus—King of Egypt, and the son of Zeus and Io—and Memphis, daughter of the river-god Nilus. In one account, her mother was called Cassiopeia.

Libya was ravished by the god Poseidon to whom she bore twin sons, Belus and Agenor. Some sources name a third son, named Lelex. According to late accounts, Lybee (Libya) consorted instead with Zeus and became the mother of Belus.

Libya is also the mother of Calliste by Triton.

In Hyginus&#x27; &quot;Fabulae&quot;, Libye was called the daughter of Palamedes (corrected as Epaphus), who mothered Libys by Hermes.

<text>In set theory, a branch of mathematics, an urelement or ur-element (from the German prefix &quot;ur-&quot;, &#x27;primordial&#x27;) is an object that is not a set (has no elements), but that may be an element of a set. It is also referred to as an atom or individual. Ur-elements are also not identical with the empty set.

== Theory ==
There are several different but essentially equivalent ways to treat urelements in a first-order theory.

One way is to work in a first-order theory with two sorts, sets and urelements, with &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;b&quot; only defined when &quot;b&quot; is a set. 
In this case, if &quot;U&quot; is an urelement, it makes no sense to say formula_1, although formula_2 is perfectly legitimate.

Another way is to work in a one-sorted theory with a unary relation used to distinguish sets and urelements. As non-empty sets contain members while urelements do not, the unary relation is only needed to distinguish the empty set from urelements. Note that in this case, the axiom of extensionality must be formulated to apply only to objects that are not urelements.

This situation is analogous to the treatments of theories of sets and classes. Indeed, urelements are in some sense dual to proper classes: urelements cannot have members whereas proper classes cannot be members. Put differently, urelements are minimal objects while proper classes are maximal objects by the membership relation (which, of course, is not an order relation, so this analogy is not to be taken literally).

== Urelements in set theory ==
The Zermelo set theory of 1908 included urelements, and hence is a version now called ZFA or ZFCA (i.e. ZFA with axiom of choice). It was soon realized that in the context of this and closely related axiomatic set theories, the urelements were not needed because they can easily be modeled in a set theory without urelements. Thus, standard expositions of the canonical axiomatic set theories ZF and ZFC do not mention urelements (for an exception, see Suppes). Axiomatizations of set theory that do invoke urelements include Kripke–Platek set theory with urelements and the variant of Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory described by Mendelson. In type theory, an object of type 0 can be called an urelement; hence the name &quot;atom&quot;.

Adding urelements to the system New Foundations (NF) to produce NFU has surprising consequences. In particular, Jensen proved the consistency of NFU relative to Peano arithmetic; meanwhile, the consistency of NF relative to anything remains an open problem, pending verification of Holmes&#x27;s proof of its consistency relative to ZF. Moreover, NFU remains relatively consistent when augmented with an axiom of infinity and the axiom of choice. Meanwhile, the negation of the axiom of choice is, curiously, an NF theorem. Holmes (1998) takes these facts as evidence that NFU is a more successful foundation for mathematics than NF. Holmes further argues that set theory is more natural with than without urelements, since we may take as urelements the objects of any theory or of the physical universe. In finitist set theory, urelements are mapped to the lowest-level components of the target phenomenon, such as atomic constituents of a physical object or members of an organisation.

== Quine atoms ==

An alternative approach to urelements is to consider them, instead of as a type of object other than sets, as a particular type of set. Quine atoms (named after Willard Van Orman Quine) are sets that only contain themselves, that is, sets that satisfy the formula &quot;x&quot; = {&quot;x&quot;}.

Quine atoms cannot exist in systems of set theory that include the axiom of regularity, but they can exist in non-well-founded set theory. ZF set theory with the axiom of regularity removed cannot prove that any non-well-founded sets exist (unless it is inconsistent, in which case it will prove any arbitrary statement), but it is compatible with the existence of Quine atoms. Aczel&#x27;s anti-foundation axiom implies that there is a unique Quine atom. Other non-well-founded theories may admit many distinct Quine atoms; at the opposite end of the spectrum lies Boffa&#x27;s axiom of superuniversality, which implies that the distinct Quine atoms form a proper class.

Quine atoms also appear in Quine&#x27;s New Foundations, which allows more than one such set to exist.

Quine atoms are the only sets called reflexive sets by Peter Aczel, although other authors, e.g. Jon Barwise and Lawrence Moss, use the latter term to denote the larger class of sets with the property &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;x&quot;.

<text>This article lists the television broadcasts that had the most viewers within individual countries, as measured by ratings and research agencies in those countries. The research methodology and choice of statistics varies between sources, and is explained in individual sections.

Because many events are watched simultaneously around the world and recorded programs are exported to multiple countries, it is difficult to collate reliable figures for global audiences. Those countries where reliable figures are available may use incompatible methodologies, such as the minimum age of counted viewers, and what proportion of the program must be watched when measuring the &quot;reach&quot; of a program, rather than its average or peak audience. Figures published by organisers and journalists are routinely exaggerated or misrepresented, claiming billions of viewers worldwide, where independent analysis suggests few if any broadcasts have reached 1 billion viewers.

Although numbers are unreliable, it is generally accepted that the most widely watched events worldwide are international sporting events such as the Summer Olympic Games, FIFA World Cup, and the Cricket World Cup with annual events such as the Super Bowl in the U.S., the Indian Premier League in India and the UEFA Champions League finals in Europe picking up large regional audiences. Other broadcasts frequently claimed to have broken records include news events such as the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing, funerals of significant figures such as Michael Jackson, Diana, Princess of Wales, or Elizabeth II, and music events such as the 1985 Live Aid benefit concert, 1993 Super Bowl Halftime Show, or the CMG New Year&#x27;s Gala that is recognized by Guinness World Records as the world&#x27;s most watched television program.

==Australia==
===Most-watched broadcasts of all time (total viewers)===
The following is David Dale&#x27;s approximate ranking of the most-watched television shows of all time in Australia using data from Nielsen Corporation and OzTAM.

Note: the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, the Wedding of Prince Charles and the Wedding of Prince William were all carried by all 4 major networks and are counted together.

=== Most viewed broadcasts since 2001 (OzTAM 5 City Metro Average) ===
The following table is a list of the most viewed programs based on the OzTAM 5 City Metro Average rating system. It does not include regional numbers (40% of the population) and uses the average viewership, not the peak viewership. Also note these ratings are not comparable with ratings before 2001 due to different methodologies used after this time.

==Brazil==
==Canada==

The two most-watched television broadcasts in Canadian history occurred during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. For the gold medal game of the men&#x27;s hockey tournament at the 2010 Winter Olympics, played between the United States and Canada, confirmed 16.6 million Canadians watched the whole game, roughly one-half of the country&#x27;s entire population. A groundbreaking 26.5 million Canadians watched some part of the game, over 80 percent of the country&#x27;s 34-million-person population. According to multiple sources, 13.3 million Canadians watched the games&#x27; opening ceremony, which was the previous record.

Many believed the final game of the 1972 Summit Series had up to 18 million viewers, but only 4.3 million TVs tuned in. This statistic does not represent the reality that most school children (representing the tail end of the baby-boom i.e. a large population) nationwide watched the game in gymnasiums on only one or two TVs. 10.3 million people watched the ice hockey gold medal final of the 2002 Winter Olympics.

==China==
China Central Television&#x27;s Spring Festival Gala has regularly attracted between 700 million to 1.17 billion viewers annually.

The CCTV&#x27;s main evening news broadcast Xinwen Lianbo has a daily audience of around 135 million people, and it is also one of the most expensive shows in the world per advertising spots, with its 2013 advertising slots selling for a record of 5.4 billion yuan.

&quot;The Legend of Bruce Lee&quot; (2008), based on the life of Bruce Lee, has been watched by over viewers in China, making it the most-watched Chinese television drama series of all time, as of 2017.

A Chinese boxer Zou Shiming&#x27;s professional boxing debut on 6 April 2013 generated an estimated 300 million viewers. Another professional boxer Qiu Xiaojun attracted around 200 million people for his fight against Ghanaian fighter Raymond Commey on 12 February 2016.

== Denmark ==
The following are the ten most watched programs from 1992 onwards.

==France==
== Germany ==
&quot;Note&quot;: The UEFA Euro 2008 final is missing from the list, because the lengthy trophy presentation was included into the official ratings. The game itself was watched by 28.05 million viewers.
== Italy ==

==India==

India measures the viewership of shows through TRP (Television Rating Point). Shows used to have higher ratings in 2000s as compared to present decade. The present shows that regularly score above or around the 3.5 mark are &quot;Kumkum Bhagya&quot;, and its spin off &quot;Kundali Bhagya&quot; along with &quot;Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai&quot;. Sometimes these shows touch 4 which is still quite low as compared to highest rated shows of the last decade. Other than that &quot;Naagin&quot; is the only show now that scores above 4.7. All of these shows are produced by the same banner (Balaji Telefilms) except &quot;Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai&quot;. Currently, &quot;Bigg Boss 13&quot; has been the most watched show of 2020, recording an 11.3 TRP for the final and an average of 8.3 TRP on regular episodes, being the most watched reality show in India. Ironically, 2.5–3.5 TRP was considered an average in the 2000s era of classic serials. In the 2000s, the most watched show in India was Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi (2000–2008) which garnered double digit ratings for 6 years on StarPlus. The most-watched channel for years has been StarPlus, then Zee TV with major competition from Colors. &quot;Mahabharat&quot; (19881990), the television adaptation of Indian epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, had a share of 97.8% among Indian viewers.

Aamir Khan&#x27;s talk show &quot;Satyamev Jayate&quot; (20122014) drew an estimated audience of 600million viewers in India. The 2016 ICC World Twenty20 cricket cup was watched by an estimated 730million viewers in India, with India vs. Pakistan being the most widely watched live event during the tournament.

===Most viewed broadcasts===
==Ireland==
A list of most-watched shows in the Republic of Ireland in the 21st century was released in January 2015. &quot;The Late Late Toy Show&quot; held the top six spots, with the 2014 edition drawing 1,593,000 viewers: over one-third of the country&#x27;s population. Other high-performing shows were &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, crime drama &quot;Love/Hate&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Brown&#x27;s Boys&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Game&quot;, UEFA Euro 2012 and the Eurovision Song Contest.

==Japan==

The following is a list of the top 50 highest rated broadcasts of all time in Japan since Video Research started their ratings survey on December 3, 1962.

The following list is for Japanese anime only. The list covers broadcasts after 26 September 1977. Video Research had previously recorded an episode of the 1960s &quot;Astro Boy&quot; anime that earned a 40.3% rating.

The following is a list of the most-watched films of all time on Nippon TV (NTV), .
==Mexico==
A list of most-watched shows in the Mexico, Televisa and TV Azteca broadcasters (Liga MX Apertura and 
Clausura), Boxing, 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, (FIFA World Cup hosts 1970 &amp; 1986), some concerts like Maná&#x27;s Unidos por La Paz at Estadio Azteca in March 2001; in 2007, the last episode of La Fea Más Bella&quot;, Funeral events like Chespirito in December 2014 the creator of TV Series &quot;El Chavo&quot; and &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot;, and Celebration of Mexican political anniversaries in 2010 celebrate independence from Spain also called Bicentenario 2010, had an average audience of over 40 million views in Mexican Television.

==Netherlands==
Since 2002, Stichting KijkOnderzoek is keeping track of viewership of Dutch television channels. All programs with a viewership over 7 million since the start of tracking are shown in the table below.

==New Zealand==
In 2011, the television website Throng published a list of the 12 most-watched television broadcasts in New Zealand from 1995 to 2011. This is based on average viewership of the program, but it does not include broadcasts from before 1995 or after 2011.

The Rugby World Cup has frequently had large audiences – the 2011 Rugby World Cup final, and a semi-final, both had an average audience of over 2 million.


==Philippines==
===AGB Nielsen===
The following table shows the all-time highest rating television shows in Mega Manila as tallied by AGB Nielsen since 1992. However, ratings are from a single highest recorded episode of the show (in the case of the TV series) and it is not the average over-all ratings for the whole season or series.

==Poland==
List of the 10 most-watched television broadcasts since the beginning of telemetry research in Poland (since 1997) by Nielsen Media Research:

==Portugal==


== Serbia ==

==South Korea==
Viewership ratings are provided by two companies in South Korea, AGB Nielsen Media Research and TNmS. Originally Media Service Korea was the only company providing such information, and it was later acquired by Nielsen Media Research. In 1999, TNS Media Korea also began such service, and later changed its name to TNmS. AGB collects viewership data based on 2050 households, while TNmS has 2000 households with measuring devices. Drama ratings usually vary between the two companies by 2–3%.

==Sweden==
Statistics from Mediamätning Skandinavien

===Most-watched programmes per year===
===Most-watched sport events per year===
==United Kingdom==
==United States==
Although the Apollo 11 Moon landing is considered as the most watched television event in American history, it is considered a news event, meaning that CBS&#x27;s live telecast of Super Bowl LVIII in 2024 holds the record for the largest average viewership of any live network U.S. television broadcast, with 123.7 million viewers. During this broadcast, the halftime show was watched by 129.1 million viewers. Super Bowl XLV&#x27;s live broadcast in February 2011 helped Fox become the first television network in the United States to be watched by at least 100 million American viewers by average for a single primetime night of programming. Moreover, Super Bowl telecasts account for 22 of the most-watched television broadcasts based on overall viewership in U.S. television history. Fox&#x27;s live telecast of Super Bowl LI in 2017 currently holds the largest total viewership (those who watched any part of the broadcast) in U.S. television history, with 172 million viewers. In 2025, the Super Bowl attracted 127.7 million viewers on Fox&#x27;s television broadcast, surpassing the previous year&#x27;s viewership of 123.7 million.

<text>Nanda Devi is the second-highest mountain in India, after Kangchenjunga, and the highest located entirely within the country. (Kangchenjunga is on the border of India and Nepal.) Nanda Devi is the 23rd-highest peak in the world.

Nanda Devi was considered the highest mountain in the world before computations in 1808 proved Dhaulagiri to be higher. It was also the highest mountain in India until 1975, when Sikkim, an independent kingdom until 1948 and a protectorate of India thereafter, became a state of India. It is located in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, between the Rishiganga valley on the west and the Goriganga valley on the east.

The peak, whose name means &quot;Bliss-Giving Goddess&quot;, is regarded as the patron goddess of the Garhwal and Kumaon Himalayas. In acknowledgment of its religious significance and for the protection of its fragile ecosystem, the Government of India declared the peak as well as the circle of high mountains surrounding it—the Nanda Devi sanctuary—off-limits to both locals and climbers in 1983. The surrounding Nanda Devi National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988.

==Description and notable features==
Nanda Devi is a two-peaked massif, forming a high ridge, oriented east–west. The western summit is higher than the eastern summit, which is called Nanda Devi East, (locally known as &quot;Sunanda Devi&quot;). The main summit stands guarded by a barrier ring comprising some of the highest mountains in the Indian Himalayas, twelve of which exceed in height, further elevating its sacred status as the daughter of the Himalaya in Indian folklore. The interior of this almost insurmountable ring is known as the Nanda Devi Sanctuary, and is protected as the Nanda Devi National Park. Nanda Devi East lies on the eastern edge of the ring (and of the park), at the border of Chamoli, Pithoragarh and Bageshwar districts in India&#x27;s Uttarakhand state.

In addition to being the 23rd highest independent peak in the world, Nanda Devi is also notable for its large, steep rise above local terrain. It rises over above its immediate southwestern base on the Dakshini Nanda Devi Glacier in about , and its rise above the glaciers to the north is similar. This makes it among the steepest peaks in the world at this scale, closely comparable, for example, to the local profile of K2, in Pakistan. Nanda Devi is also impressive when considering terrain that is a bit further away, as it is surrounded by relatively deep valleys. For example, it rises over above the valley of the Goriganga in only .

On the northern side of the massif lies the Uttari Nanda Devi Glacier, flowing into the Uttari Rishi Glacier. To the southwest, one finds the Dakkhini Nanda Devi Glacier, flowing into the Dakkhini Rishi Glacier. All of these glaciers are located within the Sanctuary, and drain west into the Rishiganga. To the east lies the Pachu Glacier, and to the southeast lie the Nandaghunti and Lawan Glaciers, feeding the Lawan Gad; all of these drain into the Milam Valley. To the south is the Pindari Glacier, draining into the Pindar River. Just to the south of Sunanda Devi, dividing the Lawan Gad drainage from the Dakkhini Nanda Devi Glacier, is Longstaff Col, , one of the high passes that guard access to the Nanda Devi Sanctuary. For a list of notable peaks of the Sanctuary and its environs, see Nanda Devi National Park.

==Exploration and climbing history==
The ascent of Nanda Devi necessitated fifty years of arduous exploration in search of a passage into the Sanctuary. The outlet is the Rishi Gorge, a deep, narrow canyon which is very difficult to traverse safely, and is the biggest hindrance to entering the Sanctuary; any other route involves difficult passes, the lowest of which is . Hugh Ruttledge attempted to reach the peak three times in the 1930s and failed each time. In a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; he wrote that &#x27;Nanda Devi imposes on her votaries an admission test as yet beyond their skill and endurance&#x27;, adding that gaining entry to the Nanda Devi Sanctuary alone was more difficult than reaching the North Pole.
In 1934, the British explorers Eric Shipton and H. W. Tilman, with three Sherpa companions, Angtharkay, Pasang and Kusang, finally discovered a way through the Rishi Gorge into the Sanctuary.

When the mountain was later climbed in 1936 by a British-American expedition, it became the highest peak climbed by man until the 1950 ascent of Annapurna, . (However, higher non-summit elevations had already been reached by the British on Mount Everest in the 1920s, and it is possible that George Mallory reached Everest&#x27;s summit in 1924.) It also involved steeper and more sustained terrain than had been previously attempted at such a high altitude. The expedition climbed the south ridge, also known as the Coxcomb Ridge, which leads relatively directly to the main summit. The summit pair were H. W. Tilman and Noel Odell; Charles Houston was to be in place of Tilman, but he contracted severe food poisoning. Noted mountaineer and mountain writer H. Adams Carter was also on the expedition, which was notable for its small scale and lightweight ethic: it included only seven climbers, and used no fixed ropes, nor any Sherpa support above . Eric Shipton, who was not involved in the climb itself, called it &quot;the finest mountaineering achievement ever performed in the Himalaya.&quot;

After abortive attempts by Indian expeditions in 1957 and 1961, the second ascent of Nanda Devi was accomplished by an Indian team led by N. Kumar in 1964, following the Coxcomb route.

===CIA mission===
From 1965 to 1968, attempts were made by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), in co-operation with the Intelligence Bureau (IB), to place a nuclear-powered telemetry relay listening device on the summit of Nanda Devi. This device was designed to intercept telemetry signals from missile test launches conducted in the Xinjiang Province, at a time of relative infancy in China&#x27;s missile program. The expedition retreated due to dangerous weather conditions, leaving the device near the summit of Nanda Devi. They returned the next spring to search for the device, which ended without success. As a result of this activity by the CIA, the Sanctuary was closed to foreign expeditions throughout much of the 1960s. In 1974 the Sanctuary re-opened.

===Subsequent climbs===

A difficult new route, the northwest buttress, was climbed by a 13-person team in 1976. Three Americans, John Roskelley, Jim States and Louis Reichardt, summited on 1 September. The expedition was co-led by Reichardt, H. Adams Carter (who was on the 1936 climb,) and Willi Unsoeld, who climbed the West Ridge of Everest in 1963. Unsoeld&#x27;s daughter, Nanda Devi Unsoeld, who was named after the peak, died on this expedition. She had been suffering from &quot;diarrhea and flare-up of an inguinal hernia, which had shown up originally on the second day of the approach march&quot;, and had been at for nearly five days.

In 1980, the Indian Army Corps of Engineers made an unsuccessful attempt.

This was followed in 1981 by another Indian Army expedition of the Parachute Regiment, which attempted both main and eastern peaks simultaneously. The expedition had placed a memorial to Nanda Devi Unsoeld at the high altitude meadow of Sarson Patal prior to the attempt. The successful attempt lost all its summiteers.

In 1993, a 40-member team of the Indian Army from the Corps of Engineers was given special permission. The aim of the expedition was multifold: to carry out an ecological survey, clean up the refuse left behind by previous expeditions, and scale the summit. The team led by Lt Col V.K. Bhatt included a number of wildlife scientists and ecologists from Wildlife Institute of India, Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History, World Wide Fund for Nature and Govind Ballabh Pant Institute for Himalayan Environment and Development amongst others. The expedition carried out a comprehensive ecological survey and removed from the park, by porter and helicopter, over 1,000 kilogrammes of litter. Additionally, five summiteers reached the summit: Amin Naik, Anand Swaroop, G. K. Sharma, Didar Singh and S. P. Bhatt.

==Recent history and conservation==

After the re-opening of the sanctuary in 1974 to foreign climbers, trekkers and locals, the fragile ecosystem was soon compromised by firewood cutting, littering and grazing. Serious environmental problems were noted as early as 1977, and the sanctuary was closed again in 1983. Currently, Nanda Devi forms the core of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (which includes Nanda Devi National Park), declared by the Indian government in 1982. In 1988, Nanda Devi National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, &quot;of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of humankind.&quot; The entire sanctuary, and hence the main summit (and interior approaches to the nearby peaks), are off-limits to locals and to climbing expeditions, although a one-time exception was made in 1993 for a 40-member team from the Indian Army Corps of Engineers to check the state of recovery and to remove garbage left by prior expeditions. Sunanda Devi remains open from the east side, leading to the standard south ridge route. After a sustained campaign by the local community as reflected in the Nanda Devi Declaration of 2001, the core zone of the Nanda Devi was opened for limited eco-tourism activity in 2003. In 2006, the campaign invited women trekkers from 4 countries during the inaugural trek inside the National Park. As a follow-up, the Campaign for Cultural Survival and Sustainable Livelihoods has now designed an Interpretive Trek to the Nanda Devi National Park. An Interpretation Centre on Bio Cultural Diversity of the Nanda Devi National Park is under development in the village of Lata, the gateway to the Nanda Devi National Park. A maximum number of 500 trekkers are now allowed to enter the core zone until Dharansi between May and October. The trek to Nanda Devi National Park starts from the village of Lata, located 25 kilometres upstream from the town of Joshimath on Niti-Malari highway.

== 2021 flood ==

On 7 February 2021 it was reported that a portion of the Nanda Devi glacier broke away, causing the Dhauliganga and the Rishiganga rivers to flood. One dam at the Dhauliganga hydropower project at Reni village was destroyed and another suffered a partial collapse. Initial reports said nine people were dead and 140 missing. Water levels on the Alaknanda also rose.

<doc id="643669" wikidata="Q2636117" url="?curid=643669" title="Cello Concerto (Schumann)">
<text>The Cello Concerto in A minor, Op. 129, by Robert Schumann was completed in a period of only two weeks, between 10 October and 24 October 1850, shortly after Schumann became the music director at Düsseldorf.

The concerto was never played in Schumann&#x27;s lifetime. It was premiered on 23 April 1860, four years after his death, in Oldenburg, with Ludwig Ebert as soloist.

The length of a typical performance is about 25 minutes.

== Instrumentation ==
The work is scored for solo cello, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani, and strings.

== Structure ==
Written late in his short life, the concerto is considered one of Schumann&#x27;s more enigmatic works due to its structure, the length of the exposition, and the transcendental quality of the opening as well as the intense lyricism of the second movement. On the autograph score, Schumann gave the title &quot;Konzertstück&quot; (concert piece) rather than &quot;Konzert&quot; (concerto), which suggested he intended to depart from the traditional conventions of a concerto from the beginning.

Consistent with many of Schumann&#x27;s other works, the concerto utilizes both fully realized and fragmentary thematic material introduced in the first movement, material which is then quoted and developed throughout. Together with the concerto&#x27;s relatively short, linked movements, the concerto is thus very unified both in material and in character, although the work&#x27;s emotional scope is wide. Schumann&#x27;s use of the same themes in different contexts and moods lends the concerto a strong sense of character development and an extended emotional arc, from its opening measures vacillating between deeply meditative and agitated to the brilliant, affirmative conclusion.

The piece is in three movements:
Schumann famously abhorred applause between movements. As a result, there are no breaks between any of the movements in the concerto. As for the concerto&#x27;s virtuosity, Schumann earlier in his life declared &quot;I cannot write a concerto for the virtuoso; I must think of something else.&quot; In the cello concerto, while exploiting the instrument to the fullest, the writing for the soloist generally avoids virtuosic display prominent in many concertos of the time.

== Reception ==
Although the cello concerto is now performed with some regularity, the work spent many decades in obscurity, virtually unknown. Schumann was unable to secure a premiere of the work and initial reactions to his score were mostly very negative. This may have been in part due to the work&#x27;s unusual structure as well as the personal, inward nature of the music and the lack of passages written to display the technical skill of the cello soloist. While criticism of the work persists, some cellists place the Schumann concerto alongside the cello concertos of Dvořák and Elgar in a group of great Romantic works for their instrument.

==Arrangements==
Schumann created a version for violin and orchestra for Joseph Joachim to play. Dmitri Shostakovich re-orchestrated the cello concerto in 1963 as his opus 125.

<text>Kala Patthar () is a notable landmark located on the south ridge of Pumori in the Nepali Himalayas above Gorakshep. Although not a proper mountain, with a prominence of only , the ascent of Kala Patthar is very popular with trekkers in the region of Mount Everest since it provides the most accessible closeup view of Everest. Due to the structure of the Everest Massif, its high summit is blocked by Nuptse from much of the surrounding region.

The views of Everest, Nuptse and Changtse are spectacular from Kala Patthar and there are glimpses of the northern flank and summit of Lhotse. The world&#x27;s highest webcam, Mount Everest webcam, was located here. Kala Patthar is considered the highest altitude most will reach without a climbing permit, which must be obtained in Kathmandu, at the Nepal Mountaineering Association.

==Description==
The ascent of Kala Patthar begins at Gorakshep (), the original base camp for Mt. Everest. After a brief dip to an ancient lake bed (which now contains a small lake and a helipad), the ascent makes its way up a series of steep switchbacks before levelling off somewhat as it traverses to the eastern side of the mountain. The trail then becomes steep once again until it reaches the wind-swept summit ridge. From there, a five to ten minute scramble over boulders takes one to the top, which is marked with prayer flags. There is also a geocaching trackable named Kala Pattar Yeti attached near the summit. Its trackable code is GS9EBG. The full ascent usually takes between 1.5 and 2 hours. If the attempt is made starting from Lobuche, an additional two to three hours (one way) is required.
The elevation is commonly listed as . One source lists the height as 5,600 meters/18,373 feet. Portland State University Assistant Professor Dr. Luis A. Ruedas took a Garmin eMap GPS unit to the summit on 6 December 2006. These units can average a series of individual satellite readings, making them more accurate than single-reading machines. Averaging 48 readings at 0625h Nepal local time, temperature −20 °C, the GPS recorded the location of the summit as 27°59.750&#x27;N, 86°49.705&#x27;E (datum: WGS84), and elevation as . Even accounting for the fact that the summit may have approximately one meter of stones added as a celebratory cairn, this is a significant discrepancy with previously recorded elevations. The same unit was consistent concerning previously recorded elevations for Gorak Shep and Everest Base Camp. In October 2008, a GPS with WAAS recorded the summit at 27°59.751&#x27;N, 86°49.705&#x27;E (datum: WGS84) with an elevation of , confirming the 2006 data.

It is possible that since Kala Patthar is merely a minor summit on a ridge leading to Pumori, different people may have measured different summits. There is a minor summit along this ridge near 27°59.51&#x27;N, 86°49.62&#x27;E with an elevation of approximately . The summit traditionally referred to as Kala Patthar is, however, completely festooned with prayer flags, making it quite readily recognizable. It is that summit that was recorded as . It is quite clear that the point trekkers climb to is a local maxima on the Pumori ridge, not the summit of Kala Patthar proper. This point is clearly higher than the summit of Kala Patthar, but the name has remained in popular use.

==Climate change==
In December 2009, Madhav Kumar Nepal and the Nepali Cabinet held a short cabinet meeting at the base of Kala Patthar as a response to climate change.

<text>Andrea Joy Cook (born July 22, 1978) is a Canadian actress. She is best known for her role as Supervisory Special Agent Jennifer &quot;JJ&quot; Jareau on the CBS crime drama &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; (2005–2020, 2022–). Cook has also appeared in &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; (1999), &quot;Higher Ground&quot; (2000), &quot;Ripper&quot; (2001), &quot;Out Cold&quot; (2001), &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; (2003), and &quot;Tru Calling&quot; (2003–2004).

==Early life==
Cook was born in Oshawa, Ontario. She spent most of her early life in nearby Whitby, where she attended Anderson Collegiate Vocational Institute. She has three siblings: Nathan, Paul, and Angela.

Cook was declared legally blind in the second grade because of severe astigmatism, but wore contacts and thick &quot;Coke bottle&quot; glasses to correct her vision. Talking about her childhood, Cook recalled how other kids were &quot;cruel&quot; and that she &quot;really couldn&#x27;t see&quot; and &quot;everything looked like a smear of colour with no shapes&quot;. She also said that at the time of her diagnosis, she was not doing well in school. At first, people thought she had a learning disability because she could not read. In reality, she could not see the board, which affected her ability to recognize letters and know the sounds they made. In 2007, a surgical lens implant corrected the impairment.

A dancer from age four, Cook began taking jazz, tap and ballet lessons. She said that dance kept her engaged growing up as she did not have to recite or read anything. She danced competitively for many years, before deciding at the age of 16 that she wanted to try acting. Cook also taught dance when she was younger and has stated that if she hadn&#x27;t become an actress, she would most likely have set up a small dance studio somewhere. In an interview, she said that she still tap dances.

==Career==
Cook&#x27;s first job was in a McDonald&#x27;s commercial in 1997. She graduated to series work with a guest role on the television series &quot;Goosebumps&quot; and parts in two television movies, &quot;In His Father&#x27;s Shoes&quot; and &quot;Elvis Meets Nixon&quot;. Cook launched her feature film career as one of five suicidal Lisbon sisters in 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;. Also that year, she took a starring role in the TV series &quot;Higher Ground&quot;, in which Cook played Shelby Merrick, an adolescent girl dealing with abuse and heartache at a wilderness school for struggling teens. &quot;Higher Ground&quot; lasted one season, ending with a romance between Shelby and Hayden Christensen&#x27;s character Scott.

After &quot;Higher Ground&quot;, Cook appeared in the 2000 TV movie &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot; (alongside &quot;Higher Ground&quot; alum Kandyse McClure), and then captured leading roles in several films, including &quot;Out Cold&quot; (as Jason London&#x27;s love interest), &quot;Ripper&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Reed Fish&quot;, and &quot;Final Destination 2&quot;. In 2003, Cook guest starred in &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;. She was also in Season One of &quot;Tru Calling&quot; as Lindsay Walker.

Beginning in September 2005, she starred as Jennifer &quot;J.J.&quot; Jareau in the CBS drama &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;. On June 14, 2010, it was announced that her contract option would not be picked up for season six as a series regular reportedly due to budget cuts on the show, but she returned for two episodes to wrap up her character&#x27;s storyline due to thousands of letters and petitions written to the show&#x27;s producers. She also returned for one episode for the departure of Paget Brewster from the series. Former executive producer of &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, Ed Bernero, later claimed that CBS executives called him one day and asked him to get rid of Cook and Brewster. Brewster also mentioned in a separate interview that someone from CBS called Bernero and said they wanted &quot;new women&quot; which led to their firing. She said that it was not due to budget cuts as their replacement was paid twice what they were paid.

In April 2011, it was reported that Cook had signed to reappear for two more seasons of the show. In 2013, Cook and her &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; co-star Kirsten Vangsness managed to negotiate salary raises but not parity after years of being paid less than half the salary of fellow co-stars Matthew Gray Gubler and Shemar Moore. In 2017, both women held out on signing new contracts as they sought pay parity with Gubler. They eventually succeeded and closed new deals to return. Cook would continue to star in the series until it ended in 2020 after 15 seasons. After the show wrapped, Cook decided to take a break from acting and in 2022, she guest-starred on the show &quot;9-1-1&quot;. It was also announced that she would be returning for the &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; revival.

==Other ventures==
In 2013, it was announced she was hired as a spokeswoman for Proactiv. She appeared in the January/February 2014 issue of &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine.
She was ranked at 88 on the Maxim Hot 100 2014 list. She was the Grand Marshal for the STP 500 at Martinsville Speedway in Martinsville, Virginia on April 3, 2016.

==Personal life==
Cook was raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), although she is no longer a practicing member. She also did not limit her acting solely to roles reflecting LDS Church beliefs. On August 3, 2001, she married her long-time boyfriend, Nathan Andersen. The two met in a film class at Utah Valley University, and she later moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, to be with him. They reside in Los Angeles, California, with their two sons.

In September 2008, their first son, Mekhai Allan, was born. He appeared as Henry LaMontagne throughout the &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; series. The couple&#x27;s second son, Phoenix Sky, was born in July 2015. Cook and her husband named him Phoenix because they were told that they couldn&#x27;t have any more children but Phoenix was a surprise and &quot;just rose up&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, as Jareau&#x27;s second son, Michael.

<doc id="643691" wikidata="Q207600" url="?curid=643691" title="Aghlabid dynasty">
<text>The Aghlabid dynasty () was an Arab dynasty centered in Ifriqiya (roughly present-day Tunisia) from 800 to 909 that conquered parts of Sicily, Southern Italy, and possibly Sardinia, nominally as vassals of the Abbasid Caliphate. The Aghlabids were from the tribe of Banu Tamim and adhered to the Mu&#x27;tazilite rationalist doctrine within Hanafi Sunni Islam, which they imposed as the state doctrine of Ifriqiya. They ruled until 909 when they were conquered by the new power of the Fatimids.

==History==

=== Independence and consolidation ===
In 800, the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid appointed Ibrahim I ibn al-Aghlab, son of a Khurasanian Arab commander from the Banu Tamim tribe, as hereditary Emir of Ifriqiya, in response to the anarchy that had reigned in that province following the fall of the Muhallabids. At that time there were perhaps 100,000 Arabs living in Ifriqiya, although the Berbers still constituted the great majority. Most of the Arab immigrants had come from Syria and Iraq, both of which had consistently contributed a significant number of migrants to the Maghreb region from the start.

Ibrahim was to control an area that encompassed what is now eastern Algeria, Tunisia and Tripolitania. The territory granted to Ibrahim was not demarcated, as it theoretically encompassed the entire Maghreb west of Cyrenaica, including any newly conquered territories. Although independent in all but name, his dynasty never ceased to recognise Abbasid overlordship. The Aghlabids paid an annual tribute of 800,000 dirhams to the Abbasid Caliph and their suzerainty was referenced in the &quot;khutba&quot; at Friday prayers.

After the pacification of the country Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab established a residence at a new capital, al-Abbasiyya, founded outside Kairouan in 800 and built between 801 and 810. This was done partly to distance himself from the opposition of the Malikite jurists and theologians, who condemned what they saw as the luxurious life of the Aghlabids (not to mention the fact that the Aghlabids were Mu&#x27;tazilites in theology, and Hanafis in fiqh), and disliked the unequal treatment of the Muslim Berbers. Additionally, border defenses such as ribats were set up, including in coastal cities like Sousse (Susa) and Monastir. The Aghlabids also built up the irrigation of the area and enhanced the public buildings and mosques of Ifriqiya. Slaves were obtained through the trans-Saharan trade, through Mediterranean commerce, and from raids on other lands like Sicily and Italy. 

The Aghlabid army was composed of two main elements. The first was the &quot;jund&quot;, or Arab troops descended from the Arab tribesmen who had participated in the early Muslim conquests of North Africa. The other component of the army was recruited from slaves, put in place partly to counterbalance to the power of the &quot;jund&quot;. It was recorded that 5,000 black Zanj slaves were stationed in Abbasiya as part of its garrison. Under Ziyadat Allah I (r. 817–838) came a revolt of Arab troops (the &quot;jund&quot;) in 824, the last but most serious episode of confrontation between them and the Aghlabid emirs. The rebellion was led by a commander named Mansur ibn Nasr al-Tunbudhi, who owned a fortress near Tunis. By September 824 the rebels had occupied Tunis and Kairouan, but the Aghlabids managed to repel them from Kairouan a month later and killed Mansur. Another chief, Amir ibn Nafi&#x27;, took over leadership of the rebels and inflicted a severe defeat on Ziyadat Allah&#x27;s forces. Eventually, the emir was able to gain the upper hand with the help of the Ibadite Berbers of the Nafwaza region and finally crushed the rebellion in 827. In 838/839 (224 AH) the southwestern province of Qastiliya (the Djerid region), largely inhabited by Ibadi Muslims, revolted, prompting the Aghlabids to recapture Tozeur, its main city, that year.

=== Conquest of Sicily ===
In 827, soon after Ziyadat Allah defeated the rebellion, the Aghlabid conquest of Sicily began. Asad ibn al-Furat, a &quot;qadi&quot; from Kairouan, was appointed as commander of the Aghlabid forces. The pretense for this invasion was an internal revolt in Byzantine Sicily led by a military commander named Euphemios who requested support from the Aghlabids. 

Despite the political differences and rivalry between the Aghlabids, who served under the Abbasid Caliphate, and the Umayyad Emirate of Cordoba, the Muslims of al-Andalus (in the Iberian Peninsula) also sent a fleet under Asba&#x27; ibn Wakil to aid the Aghlabid conquest of Sicily. Ibn Kathir recorded that a joint force of 300 Umayyad and Aghlabid ships were present. The Aghlabid garrison at Mineo managed to get into contact with the Andalusian Umayyads, who immediately agreed to the alliance, provided that Asba&#x27; was recognized as the overall commander, and, together with fresh troops from Ifriqiya, they marched on Mineo. Theodotus retreated to Enna and the siege of Mineo was broken in July or August 830. The combined Ifriqiyan and Andalusian army then torched Mineo and laid siege to another town, possibly Calloniana (modern Barrafranca). However, a plague broke out in their camp, causing the death of Asba&#x27; and many others. The town fell later, in autumn, but the Arabs&#x27; numbers were depleted to the point where they were forced to abandon it and retreat west. Theodotus launched a pursuit and inflicted heavy casualties, and, thereafter, most of the Andalusians departed the island. However, Theodotus too was killed at this time, possibly in one of these skirmishes.

The conquest of Sicily proceeded slowly and at an uneven pace, progressing roughly from west to east through multiple campaigns over many years. Palermo was conquered in 831 and became the capital of Muslim rule on the island and the base for further conquests. Messina was besieged and captured in 842 or 843, possibly with the support of some Neapolitans, and became a base for further campaigns into the Italian mainland. Syracuse was captured in 878. The conquest of the island was not fully completed until 902, when Taormina was conquered. Even after this, however, some patches of local Byzantine/Christian resistance continued until 967, long after the Aghlabid dynasty had ended.

=== Italian Peninsula ===
Even as the conquest of Sicily was ongoing, the Aghlabids began campaigning on the Italian mainland. Their invasions of Calabria and Apulia, as well as their attacks on other central Mediterranean islands, were probably undertaken as an extension of their conquest of Sicily, aiming to aid the latter by attacking other Byzantine positions in the region. The first major expeditions to the peninsula took place between 835 and 843. Amantea was taken in 839 or 846 and occupied until 886, when the Byzantines retook it. Taranto was captured in 840 and occupied until 880. Bari was captured by Muslims either in 840 or 847. Rome was raided by a Muslim force in 846, although it is not certain that the raiders came from Aghlabid territory. Another attack towards Rome took place in 849, leading to a great naval battle near Ostia during which a fleet of Muslim ships was destroyed, marking a halt to Muslim advances on the peninsula. 

Many of the Muslim forces that operated on the peninsula or occupied some of its cities seem to have had only tenuous allegiances to the Aghlabid dynasty. Some Muslim mercenaries even entered into the service of Naples or local Lombard rulers at various times. The early Muslim occupiers of Bari, for example, appear to have served as mercenaries of Radelchis I of Benevento. The Emirate of Bari, which existed from 847 to 871, had its own rulers whose relations to the Aghlabids are not clearly known.

===Malta, Sardinia and Corsica===
Elsewhere in the central Mediterranean, the Aghlabids conquered the island of Malta in 870. They also attacked or raided Sardinia and Corsica. Some modern references state that Sardinia came under Aghlabid control around 810 or after the beginning of the conquest of Sicily in 827. The historian Corrado Zedda argues that the island hosted a Muslim presence during the Aghlabid period, possibly a limited foothold along the coasts that forcibly coexisted with the local Byzantine government. In contrast, the historian Alex Metcalfe argues that the available evidence for any Muslim occupation or colonisation of the island during this period is limited and inconclusive, and that Muslim attacks were limited to raids. According to Fabio Pinna, most Sardinian historians and archaeologists studying this period of the island&#x27;s history have reached the same conclusion, denying that a Muslim conquest and occupation of Sardinia took place, due to insufficient supporting evidence from archaeology and local historical records.

=== Apogee in Ifriqiya ===
The expansion campaign into Sicily, which Ziyadat Allah launched right after defeating the &quot;jund&quot; rebellion that started in 824, gave the restless Arab troops of Ifriqiya a new outlet for their military energies. It also brought in new revenues to the Aghlabid state. At home, the Aghlabid emirs faced significant criticism from Maliki religious scholars, who held great influence as religious elites in the region. They dealt with this problem by drawing the Maliki scholars into the orbit of the state and granting them appointments to high religious offices. They also countered criticism of their wealth and privilege by publicly dispensing charity to the poor and sponsoring the construction and expansion of mosques. All of these factors led to greater internal stability and peace in Ifriqiya after 827. Agriculture and trans-Saharan trade were further developed under Aghlabid rule, leading to economic expansion and a growing urban population.

The Aghlabid emirs sponsored building projects, notably the rebuilding of the Great Mosque of Kairouan, and the kingdom developed an architectural style which combined Abbasid and Byzantine architecture. In 876 Ibrahim II ibn Ahmad moved his residence from al-Abbasiya to a new palace-city that he founded, called Raqqada. The new city contained a mosque, baths, market, and several palaces. For the rest of his life, Ibrahim II resided in a palace called &quot;Qasr al-Fath&quot; (), which also remained the residence of his successors (except for some periods when they moved to Tunis).

===Decline and fall===

The decline of the dynasty began under Ibrahim II (875–902). An attack by the Tulunids of Egypt had to be repelled and a revolt of the Berbers put down with much loss of life. In 893 there began amongst the Kutama Berbers the movement of the Isma&#x27;ili Fatimids, led by Abu Abdallah al-Shi&#x27;i, the &quot;dā&#x27;ī&quot; of the future caliph Abdallah al-Mahdi, although it took almost a decade before they were able to seriously threaten Aghlabid power.

In 902 Ibrahim II became the only Aghlabid emir to personally lead a military campaign in Sicily and the Italian mainland. While he was away in Sicily, Abu Abdallah struck the first significant blow against Aghlabid authority in North Africa by attacking and capturing the city of Mila (present-day eastern Algeria). This news triggered a serious response from the Aghlabids, who sent a punitive expedition of 12,000 men from Tunis in October of the same year. Abu Abdallah&#x27;s forces were forced to flee their base at Tazrut and re-establish themselves at Ikjan.

Ibrahim II died in October 902 while besieging Cosenza in Italy and was succeeded by Abdallah II. On 27 July 903 Abdallah was assassinated and his son Ziyadat Allah III took power, basing himself in Tunis. These internal Aghlabid troubles gave Abu Abdallah the opportunity to recapture Mila and then go on to capture Setif by October or November 904. Further Aghlabid attempts to crush his movement had little success. In 907, in response to the growing threat, Ziyadat Allah III moved his court back to Raqqada, which he fortified. Later in 907 the heavily fortified city of Baghaya, on the southern Roman road between Ifriqiya and the central Maghreb, fell to the Kutama. This opened a hole in the wider defensive system of Ifriqiya and created panic in Raqqada. Ziyadat Allah III stepped up anti-Fatimid propaganda, recruited volunteers, and took measures to defend the weakly-fortified city of Kairouan. In 908 he personally led his army in an indecisive battle against the Kutama army near Dar Madyan (probably a site between Sbeitla and Kasserine), with neither side gaining the upper hand. During the winter of 908-909 Abu Abdallah conquered the region around Chott el-Jerid. An Aghlabid counterattack against Baghaya failed.

On 25 February 909, Abu Abdallah set out from Ikjan with an army of 200,000 men for a final invasion of Kairouan. The remaining Aghlabid army, led by an Aghlabid prince named Ibrahim Ibn Abi al-Aghlab, met them near al-Aribus on 18 March. The battle lasted until the afternoon, when a contingent of Kutama horsemen outflanked the Aghlabid army and finally caused a rout. When news of the defeat reached Raqqada, Ziyadat Allah III packed his valuable treasures and fled towards Egypt. The population of Kairouan looted the abandoned palaces of Raqqada. When Ibn Abi al-Aghlab arrived on the scene after his defeat, he called on the population to mount a last-ditch resistance, but they refused. On 25 March 909 (Saturday, 1 Rajab 296), Abu Abdallah entered Raqqada and took up residence here. That same year his forces retrieved the Fatimid caliph, Abdallah al-Mahdi, from Sijilmasa (in the western Maghreb) and brought him to Ifriqiya, thus establishing the Fatimid Caliphate.

== Religion ==
The Aghlabids adhered to the Mu&#x27;tazilite theological movement within Hanafi Sunni Islam. The Aghlabids adopted the Mu&#x27;tazilite rationalist doctrine after it became the official doctrine of the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad during the reign of caliph Al-Ma&#x27;mun (813–833). The officialization of this doctrine faced strong opposition from the Maliki majority of Ifriqiya, particularly due to the Mu&#x27;tazilite rejection of the orthodox belief that the Qur&#x27;an was God&#x27;s eternal word and therefore uncreated. Although the Aghlabids recognized the political influence of the Maliki religious leaders, they were both unable and unwilling to alter their governmental system to align with their beliefs. The &quot;qāḍī&quot; (judge) of Kairouan adhered to the Hanafi school and endorsed the concept of (createdness of the Qur&#x27;an). The Aghlabids consistently favored Iraqis as their higher-ranking judges, while the viziers had affiliations with the Maliki school.

Nonetheless, the Aghlabids were able to bolster their religious standing and counter criticisms directed against them. Some Malikis were persecuted for rejecting Mu&#x27;tazilite beliefs, such as Sahsun, who suffered persecution during the reign of Muhammad I ibn al-Aghlab (841–856) for rejecting the Mu&#x27;tazilite concept that the Qur&#x27;an was created. The Aghlabids also displayed great generosity in their spending on religious buildings, such Al-Zaytuna Mosque, which they had reconstructed by 864.

As Sunni Muslims, the Aghlabids were vassals of the Abbasid caliphs of Baghdad, representing the influence and presence of the Abbasids throughout Ifriqiya. The Aghlabids maintained strained relations with the Rustamid dynasty of Tahert, who adhered to the Kharijite Ibadi sect. Their relations with the Idrisid dynasty of Fez were always tense, as the Idrisids were Zaydi Shi&#x27;ites who had expansionist ambitions on the relatively weak Rustamid state. Furthermore, the Aghlabids held a hostile stance towards the Umayyads in the Emirate of Cordoba.

== Architecture ==

The Aghlabids were major builders and erected many of the oldest Islamic-era monuments in present-day Tunisia, including military structures like the Ribat of Sousse and the Ribat of Monastir, religious buildings like the Great Mosque of Sousse and the Great Mosque of Sfax, and practical infrastructure works like the Aghlabid Reservoirs of Kairouan. Much of their architecture, even their mosques, had a heavy and almost fortress-like appearance, but they nonetheless left an influential artistic legacy.

One of the most important Aghlabid monuments is the Great Mosque of Kairouan, which was completely rebuilt by the emir Ziyadat Allah I in 836, although various additions and repairs were effected later which complicate the chronology of its construction. The mosque features an enormous rectangular courtyard, a large hypostyle prayer hall, and a thick three-story minaret (tower from which the call to prayer was issued). The minaret is the oldest surviving one in North Africa and its shape may have been modeled on existing Roman lighthouses. The &quot;mihrab&quot; (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer) of the prayer hall is among the oldest examples of its kind, richly decorated with marble panels carved in high-relief vegetal motifs and with ceramic tiles with overglaze and luster. Next to the mihrab is the oldest surviving &quot;minbar&quot; (pulpit) in the world, made of richly-carved teakwood panels. Both the carved panels of the minbar and the ceramic tiles of the mihrab are believed to be imports from Abbasid Iraq. An elegant dome in front of the mihrab wall is an architectural highlight of this period. Its light construction contrasts with the bulky structure of the surrounding mosque and the dome&#x27;s drum is elaborately decorated with a frieze of blind arches, squinches carved in the shape of shells, and carved low-relief motifs.

The Mosque of Ibn Khayrun (also known as the &quot;Mosque of the Three Doors&quot;) possesses an external façade featuring carved Kufic inscriptions and vegetal motifs, which some scholars have called the oldest decorated external façade in Islamic architecture and which may contain the oldest foundation inscription crediting a private individual (rather than a ruler) for a mosque&#x27;s construction. The al-Zaytuna Mosque in Tunis, which was founded earlier around 698, also owes its overall current form to the Aghlabid emir Abu Ibrahim Ahmad (r. 856–863).

<text>The is a two-door four passenger, front-engine, rear-drive grand touring coupe manufactured by Toyota and marketed by its luxury division, Lexus, for model years 1991-2010 across two generations. The first-generation SC debuted as the V8-powered SC 400 in 1991, and the I6-powered SC 300 was added in 1992, both manufactured until 2000. The second-generation model, the SC 430, went into production in 2001, as a retractable hardtop convertible coupe with a V8 engine. The first-generation SC was largely styled in California at Calty, and the second-generation SC was mainly conceived at design studios in Europe.

In Japan, the related third-generation Toyota Soarer, with which the first-generation SC originally shared body design and multiple components, featured a separate line-up of vehicle configurations and different powertrains. The third generation Soarer sport coupe, largely identical to the SC 430, was superseded by its Lexus counterpart in Japan when the Lexus marque débuted there in 2005. The SC was the sole coupé in the Lexus lineup until the arrival of the IS C. According to Lexus, the SC designation stands for Sport Coupe. The LC replaced the SC lineup in 2017.

== First generation (Z30; 1991) ==
=== 1991–2000 ===
In the early 1990s, following the début of Lexus, automotive press reports indicated a forthcoming Full-size Lexus coupé to compete with other luxury GT coupés of other marques, including the Mercedes-Benz CL, Acura Legend coupe and later the Acura CL, Mazda Eunos Cosmo, Buick Riviera, Cadillac Eldorado, Lincoln Mark VIII, Jaguar XJS, Bentley Continental, Maserati Shamal/Ghibli, Ferrari 456 and BMW 8 Series coupe. At that point, Toyota&#x27;s luxury coupé was the Soarer. A coupe would complement the successful Lexus flagship model, the V8-powered, rear-wheel drive LS 400 sedan. The coupé would target the American market, and the development effort for its exterior design was given to the Calty Design Research center in California in 1987.

The American Calty design team took an unusual approach to designing the car, using plaster molding shapes to study body forms, and working in three rather than two dimensions. As described by design chiefs Denis Campbell and Erwin Lui, the result was a car that was based on &quot;emotion and feeling&quot; rather than linear aesthetics. The resulting design possessed few straight edges and produced a drag coefficient of . The production design concept by Lui was approved at the beginning of 1989, and Lui was sent back to Japan for four months to assist in completion of the production design. According to automotive journalist Bill Russ, the SC design was considered influential among automotive designs of the time. A distinctive features was the articulating door hinges: when the doors opened, the hinges moved out and forward, allowing easier entry and exit in tight spaces.

Production of the Soarer started in April 1991 at the Motomachi plant in Toyota, Aichi, with the Lexus SC produced alongside the Soarer at a second Higashi Fuji plant at Susono, Shizuoka. Motomachi-sourced cars lasted until April 1997. The Lexus SC platform was used to develop Toyota&#x27;s next generation Supra, both vehicles were manufactured in the same plant. From 1990-1996 the previously installed TEMS active suspension system was replaced with Toyota Active Control Suspension as an optional upgrade.

The SC 400 débuted on 1 June 1991 in the United States as a 1992 model. The SC 400&#x27;s 4.0 L V8 &quot;1UZ-FE&quot;, the same engine as used in the LS 400, was reported to have cost over in research and development. The engine sits behind the front axles, which makes it a front mid engine rear wheel drive vehicle. The SC 400 was honored as the &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Import Car of the Year for 1992. It also made &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list from 1992 through 1996.

In July 1992, the SC 300, a smaller-engined version of the SC 400, premiered in the United States. The SC 300 was equipped with a 3.0 L inline 6 &quot;2JZ-GE&quot;. Lexus&#x27; traction control system, TRAC, was offered as an option.

The first-generation SC lasted in production until 7 July 2000, over nine years, with only minor exterior changes, including revised tail lighting and a modified spoiler as part of the mid-cycle refresh. A front grille was added in 1996, along with a redesigned front bumper, side skirts and rocker panels. The SC 400 produced / from 1991 to 1995. The original 1991–1997 engines for the &quot;2JZ-GE&quot;-powered SC 300 were rated at /. The output of the SC 300 was 5 horsepower more than the equivalent engine used in the Toyota Supra.

In 1996, the SC 400&#x27;s &quot;1UZ-FE&quot; engine design was upgraded to from . These engines were coupled with a 4-speed automatic transmission on both the SC 300 and SC 400 models. A 5-speed manual transmission was only offered on the SC 300 from its debut until 1997.

By the end of the decade, North American SC sales began dwindling due to the lack of significant design updates since the car&#x27;s introduction and marketplace changes that led to loss of interest in coupes.

In 1997 (1998 model year), both the SC 300 and 400 were upgraded with VVT-i and thus the ratings were raised to / of torque for the SC 400 and / of torque for the SC 300. Tests conducted on the new engines showed an acceleration for the SC 400 for years 1992–1995 of 0–60 mph in 6.9 seconds, years 1996–1997 in 6.7 seconds, and years 1998–2000 in 6.1 seconds. For the SC 300 an acceleration 0–60 mph in 6.8 seconds with the 5-speed manual and 7.2 seconds with the 4-speed automatic for all years. This 1997 upgrade included the replacement of the four-speed automatic on the SC 400 to a five-speed unit. With the replacement of the five-speed unit those models also got a new differential with a final drive of 3.27 improving both fuel economy and top speed.

Sales of the automatic transmission SC 300 and SC 400 models formed the vast majority of models purchased. The Lexus SC 400 was never officially sold in the British Isles, but many examples found their way across the Atlantic as personal imports.

== Second generation (Z40; 2001) ==
=== 2001–2005 ===
At the 1999 Tokyo Motor Show, Lexus displayed its Sport Coupe concept, a V8-powered convertible, signifying its plans for a replacement for the first-generation SC 300/400. The production version of its new sports coupe-convertible, the SC 430, debuted at the New York Auto Show in April 2000. The car was scheduled to go on sale in the second quarter of the following year. Power was provided by a 4.3 L &quot;3UZ-FE&quot; V8 engine with variable valve timing (VVT-i) mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. This engine was the same model as that found in the UCF30 Lexus LS. The SC 430&#x27;s V8 could produce 288 hp (215 kW) and of torque, allowing the coupe to go from 0–60 mph in 6.2 seconds.

In contrast with the previous generation model, the redesigned Lexus SC was intended as a convertible from its inception. The development team was led by chief engineer Yasushi Nakagawa from 1996 to 2000. Lexus designers from Europe and Japan worked together to create a streamlined design. A design theme was chosen in 1997 developed by Sotiris Kovos, who in return was named chief designer. Led by Kovos, designers travelled to the Côte d&#x27;Azur to develop the vehicle&#x27;s exterior shape, and studied the region&#x27;s architecture, lifestyle, and harbors. The resulting convertible of 1998 received character lines similar to the region&#x27;s yachts, in contrast with traditional waveform lines. The vehicle&#x27;s side profile, the product of extensive wind tunnel testing, was intended to channel air around the passenger compartment at high speed during top-down driving. Design patents were filed in Japan, at the Japan Patent Office on 14 June 1999 under patent number 1095312.

The SC 430 chassis featured a double-wishbone setup for both the front and rear wheels. The vehicle platform shared elements with the GS 430 sport sedan, including variable-assist power rack-and-pinion steering. Safety systems ranged from traction control to vehicle stability control. The convertible received a ULEV emissions certification rating.

The SC 430 featured a retractable aluminium hardtop, all-leather interior with brushed-aluminum accents, navigation screen with folding wood panel, and 18-inch aluminium wheels. Chrome Lexus emblems were mounted on the back of the front seat headrests. The coupe has four seat belts and could technically seat four, but rear-seat space is limited. The hardtop fully retracts in 25 seconds. Standard luxury features include Burl Walnut or Bird&#x27;s Eye Maple wood trim, a Mark Levinson premium sound system, DVD-based navigation system, and headlamp washers. For additional trunk space, as an option the SC 430 could be equipped with run-flat tires.

At its launch, the SC 430 was marketed as the &quot;jewel of Lexus&quot;, and as the marque&#x27;s first convertible, was intended as a more ostentatious addition to the Lexus lineup. Reviewers from &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine praised the SC 430 for 2002 as &quot;an unqualified success&quot;, calling it &quot;comfortable, fast, smooth, and quiet&quot; with &quot;all of the virtues expected in a patrician roadster.&quot;

In 2003, for the 2004 model year, Lexus unveiled the Lexus SC &quot;Pebble Beach Edition&quot;, a limited-production model of the SC for the US market. The special edition SC featured a unique exterior and interior colour combination which changed each model year. This edition was offered for model years 2004 to 2009 and was limited to a small number of units each year (see table below for counts). Each Lexus SC Pebble Beach edition coupe exhibited: unique colours (changed each year), special badging (featuring the &quot;Lone Cypress&quot; logo) on the front fenders, centre console, and floor mats. In 2005, for the 2006 model year, a rear spoiler and spider alloy wheels was also included.

In 2004 and 2005, J.D. Power and Associates&#x27; Initial Quality Survey awarded the SC 430 as the highest ranked premium luxury vehicle. Kelley Blue Book gave the SC 430 its Best to Hold Value Award in 2002. In June 2004, a custom-designed Carolina Herrera SC 430 was shown at the Madrid Motor Show. The special edition SC 430 CH used a &#x27;Testa di Moro&#x27; body color, with matching interior leather and carpeting, along with designer logos on the wheels and door sills. A line of accessories was also developed for the vehicle.

In 2012, Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson and James May chose the Lexus SC 430 as the worst car ever built in their film &quot;The Worst Car in the History of the World&quot;. They criticized its handling, ride and style, with May calling the ride &quot;absolutely diabolical&quot;, and stated that a big manufacturer should have known better.

=== 2006–2010 ===
In 2005 for the 2006 model year, the SC 430 was updated, with changes that included redesigned alloy wheels and the introduction of Bluetooth capability. In late 2005, the SC 430 premiered along with the Lexus marque in Japan; it was manufactured at the Kanji (Kanto Jidosha) assembly site in Japan. The SC 430 was sold in North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia; unlike its predecessor, the SC 430 was officially imported to the British Isles; the old SC 400 had been a popular personal grey import.

In 2010, a final special edition model for Japan, the SC 430 Eternal Jewel edition, was produced, limited to 200 units. The 2010 model was the last automobile from any major manufacturer in the United States to ship with a cassette tape deck.

Production of the second-generation SC ended in July 2010 after nine years of production, but Lexus was still using them in the Super GT until the 2013 season ended.

== Replacement ==

In July 2008, Edmunds InsideLine had reported that Lexus had cancelled the next generation SC due to slowing sales. A company spokesman did not confirm or deny the rumors, but called the report in the possible replacement with the introduction of the Lexus LFA as &quot;unfounded speculation&quot;. Lexus subsequently announced the production of the SC 430 model for 2009, and in 2010.

Designated LF-LC for &quot;Lexus Future-Luxury Coupe&quot;, the concept two-door vehicle premiered in January 2012 at the North American International Auto Show. The vehicle&#x27;s exterior and interior styling was created by the Calty Design Research center in Newport Beach, California, which previously developed the exterior styling of the first-generation Lexus SC coupe.

The LF-LC features a front-engine, rear-wheel drive drivetrain layout, which incorporates a next-generation Advanced Lexus Hybrid Drive system. The interior features a remote touchscreen control system linked to two liquid crystal display (LCD) screens that measure in width. Smartphone-size touchscreens are placed on the door armrests for additional controls.

The LF-LC was produced as a design study for a driver-focused vehicle at the direction of the Lexus Center in Japan, and work began on the concept in May 2010. The exterior appearance of the LF-LC was inadvertently leaked by &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine several weeks prior to its scheduled auto show debut, when a preview of its February 2012 issue with the LF-LC on its cover (under the headline &quot;Stunning! New Lexus Super Coupe&quot;) was posted to YouTube.

A series production model inspired by the 2012 LF-LC Concept is being developed under the Toyota 950A development program. Introduced at the 2016 North American International Auto Show, it went on sale as the Lexus LC 500 in early 2017, based on the new Toyota GA-L modular rear-wheel drive platform and the fifth generation LS flagship.

== Motorsport ==
In 2006 the SC 430 was entered in the (Super GT) race series in the GT500 class (cars with approximately 500 horsepower). Extensively modified from the factory car, the engine used is a modified version of the SC 430&#x27;s &quot;3UZ-FE&quot; V8 that was also used in the Toyota Supra racing car from previous years.

The new SC 430 based race cars were immediately competitive with former GT500 champion Juichi Wakisaka and no. 2 driver André Lotterer driving the Open Interface TOM&#x27;s SC to victory at the opening round at Suzuka giving the SC 430 its first victory on its debut race. Juichi Wakisaka and Andre Lotterer also won the GT500 class championship during the same year. In 2007, the Lexus SC fully replaced Supras in the Toyota side, a Zent Cerumo SC 430 driven by Yuji Tachikawa was victorious in the GT500 opening round race.

In 2008, a Zent Cerumo SC 430 driven by Yuji Tachikawa and Richard Lyons won the Fuji 500 race, round 3 of the Autobacs Super GT at Fuji Speedway. In 2009, five SC 430s were entered in Super GT racing in the GT500 class, including the Petronas TOM&#x27;s SC 430 driven by Juichi Wakisaka and André Lotterer, along with the Eneos SC 430, Kraft SC 430, Dunlop Sard SC 430, and Zent Cerumo SC 430.

In 2009, the Lexus Team Petronas TOM&#x27;s SC 430 driven by André Lotterer and Juichi Wakisaka was the championship winner in the GT500 series, also the SC 430 was victorious in early rounds at the Suzuka Circuit. In 2010, the SC 430 continued in Super GT competition, where the MJ Kraft SC 430 and other Lexus Team Kraft SC 430s won victories at the 2010 Autobacs Super GT at Fuji Speedway. Starting from 2009 until 2013, the SC 430s used Toyota&#x27;s 3.4L &quot;RV8KG&quot; V8 engine.

In 2012, two years after production had ended the 430 continued to be a force in Motorsports. Namely in Formula Drift with the Achilles Radial Lexus SC430 powered by a 2JZ and piloted by Daigo Saito.

<text>Excite Ballpark, previously known as San Jose Municipal Stadium or Muni Stadium, is a baseball park in San Jose, California. It is the home of the Minor League Baseball San Jose Giants, an affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. The team plays in the North Division of the California League. The stadium is also home to the San Jose State University Spartans college baseball team. Local high school baseball divisions also use the ballpark as their championship field. The stadium also hosts concerts, weddings, car shows, and many other community events. It has been the home field for the San Jose Owls, San Jose Red Sox, San Jose Jo Sox, San Jose Pirates, San Jose Missions, San Jose Bees, and the San Jose Expos minor league teams.

The facility is located one block from Spartan Stadium, home to the San Jose State Spartans football team. The area across Alma Avenue from Excite is home to the San Jose State practice fields for soccer, baseball, and softball. Additionally part of the stadium&#x27;s parking lot was converted into an indoor ice area, Solar4America Ice, which is the practice venue for the San Jose Sharks National Hockey League hockey team.

==History==
San Jose Municipal Stadium was built from 1941 to 1942 as a WPA project at a cost of US$80,000. It was one of the first stadiums to be built entirely of reinforced concrete. It opened in 1942 with a game that featured the San Francisco Seals as the home team.

Fans sit very close to the field in four distinct seating areas. The first seven rows of the main grandstand are numbered box seats. General admission seating is available in the upper rows of the main grandstand on straight-backed benches. Down the left and right field lines are several bleachers that are accessible for general admission use. There is table seating down the third base line as part of &quot;Turkey Mike&#x27;s BBQ Area&quot;. The stadium has remained largely unchanged from its original configuration. However, renovations to the bathroom facilities and clubhouse were done in 1994 and three extra rows of box seating were added in 1996. In 1999, the dugouts were expanded toward the field.

The outfield walls are lined with advertisements, much like the stadiums of the 1920s and 1930s. Over the scoreboard in right field is a Diamond Vision video screen. The out of town scoreboard provides scores for other California League games. Fans are treated to a variety of games and entertainment in-between innings. Such activities include a tire toss, a child footrace around the bases and a fan favorite, &quot;Smash 4 Cash&quot;, a competition where players attempt to smash the headlights of an old delivery truck to split a $50 prize with a fan. Each year&#x27;s Independence Day celebration, complete with fireworks, draws some of the stadium&#x27;s largest crowds and sees the foul line seating turned into standing room only.

In 1997, the bullpens moved from along the foul lines to the outfield. The visitor and home bullpens create artificial home run porches in left and right field respectively. In 2007, the outfield fence was replaced and moved in in some areas and bullpens moved once again.

Many major league players over the years have called San Jose Municipal Stadium home including, George Brett, Rod Beck, Joe Nathan, Chad Zerbe, Ron Hassey, Shawn Estes, Tim Lincecum, Matt Cain, Madison Bumgarner, Buster Posey, and Brandon Crawford.

Stadium features include: the San Jose Giants Dugout Store, group spaces such as the Martinelli&#x27;s VIP Deck, City National Futures Club and First Base Party Patio, the Astro Jump Family Fun Zone, Turkey Mike&#x27;s BBQ, and a HD video board. The San Jose Giants mascot, Gigante, is often found having fun with fans at the ballpark and throughout the community. 

In 2019, the San Jose Giants entered into a three-year naming rights agreement with Excite Credit Union to rename the facility Excite Ballpark. It is one of the oldest active ballparks in Minor League Baseball.

In the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, the Oakland Athletics used Excite Ballpark as their alternate training site.

<doc id="643709" wikidata="Q940123" url="?curid=643709" title="Rustamid dynasty">
<text>The Rustamid dynasty () (or &quot;Rustumids&quot;, &quot;Rostemids&quot;) was an Ibadi dynasty of Persian origin which ruled a state that was centered in present-day Algeria. The dynasty governed as a Muslim theocracy for a century and a half from its capital Tahert (present day Tagdemt) until the Ismaili Fatimid Caliphate defeated it. Rustamid authority extended over what is now central and western Algeria, parts of southern Tunisia, and the Jebel Nafusa and Fezzan regions in Libya as far as Zawila.

==History==
The Ibāḍī movement reached North Africa by 719, when the missionary Salma ibn Sa&#x27;d was sent from the Ibādī &quot;jama&#x27;a&quot; of Basra to Kairouan. By 740, their efforts had converted the major Berber tribes of Huwara around Tripoli, in the Nafusa Mountains and at Zenata in western Tripolitania. In 757 (140 AH), a group of four Basra-educated missionaries including ʻAbd ar-Rahmān ibn Rustam proclaimed an Ibāḍī imamate in Tripolitania, starting an abortive state led by Abu l-Khattab Abdul-A&#x27;la ibn as-Samh which lasted until the Abbasid Caliphate dispatched Muhammad ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath al-Khuza&#x27;i to suppress it in 761. Ifriqiya was conquered by the Abbasids from Kharijite control and Abul-Khattab Abdul-A&#x27;la ibn as-Samh was killed. On his death, the Tripolitanian Ibādiyya elected Abu l-Hatim al-Malzuzi as Imām; he was killed in 772 after launching a second unsuccessful revolt in 768. After this, the center of power shifted to Algeria, and, in 777, ʻAbd ar-Rahmān ibn Rustam, an Ifriqiyan-born convert to the Ibāḍī movement of Persian origin and one of the four founders of the imamate, was elected Imām; after this, the post remained in his family, a practice which the Ibādiyya justified by noting that he came from no tribe, and thus his election as imam would not favour the domination of one Ibadi tribe over the others.

In 873, a succession crisis occurred as the Third Imam Abu Bakr, fearing the loss of his title to his older brother Mohammed Abu-l-Yaqzan, attempted to assassinate him. However, his plot failed, leading to the population uprising against Abu Bakr, resulting in his overthrow and death In 874. Consequently, Mohammed Abu-l-Yaqzan assumed the title.

The new imamate was centered on the newly built capital of Tahert (or Tahart), near present-day Tiaret. Several Ibādī tribes displaced from Tunisia and Tripolitania settled there and strong fortifications were built. It became a major stop on the newly developing trade routes with sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East.

Ibn as-Saghir also describes the Imām as ascetic, repairing his own house and refusing gifts; the citizens sharply criticized him if they considered him derelict in his duty. Religious ethics were strictly enforced by law.

The Rustamids fought the Kairouan-based Aghlabids of Ifriqiya in 812, but otherwise reached a &quot;modus vivendi&quot;; this displeased Ibādī tribes on the Aghlabid border, who launched a few rebellions.

After Abdu l-Wahhāb, the Rustamids grew militarily weak; they were easily conquered by the Ismaili Fatimids in 909, upon which many Ibāḍis – including the last Imām – fled to the Sedrata tribe of Ouargla, whence they would ultimately emigrate to Mzab.

== Society and culture ==
The Rustamid dynasty, &quot;developed a cosmopolitan reputation in which Christians, non-Kharijite Muslims, and adherents of different sects of Kharijism lived&quot;.
On the intellectual field, the Rustamids had many scholars and learned men, such as Abd al-Rahman ibn Rustam, Abd al-Wahhab ibn Abd al-Rahman, Aflah ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab, dan Abu al-Yaqzhan ibn Aflah, Mahdi an-Nafusi, ‘Abd Allah al-Lamthi, and Mahmud ibn Bakr. ‘Abd ar-Rahman had an exegesis of the Qur’an. ‘Abd al-Wahhab wrote his Masa&#x27;il Nafusah on Islamic jurisprudence. Aflah mastered Arabic literature, mathematics, and astronomy. Abu al-Yaqzhan wrote about 40 works. Because of their intellectual enthusiasm, the Rustamids vigorously transferred valuable works from the Mashriq to the Maghrib, especially to the library of al-Ma‘shumah (in Tahert) and that of Khizanah Nafusah (in Jabal Nafusah). Moreover, Tahert was famous as ‘Iraq al-Maghrib, al-‘Iraq ash-Shaghir, Balkh al-Maghrib, or Little Basra.
Apart from these achievements, the Rustamids also had significant contribution to Islamization in the Maghrib and Bilad as-Sudan. For about two centuries (130-340 AH / 750-950 AD), the Kharijite people gained control of trade routes in the Maghrib and Bilad as-Sudan. Many Ibadite merchants made journeys along the vast area, such as Tahert, Wargla, Nafzawa, Jabal Nafusah, Tadmakkat, Gao, and Ghana. By this economic activity, the Ibadites took advantages of trading business and preaching Islam at the same time.

<text>Michael Madsen (born September 25, 1958) is an American actor. Alongside his frequent collaborations with Quentin Tarantino—&quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992), &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 2&quot; (2004), &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot; (2015), and &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; (2019)—he is known for his appearances in films, such as &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984), &quot;The Doors&quot; (1991), &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; (1991), &quot;Free Willy&quot; (1993), &quot;Species&quot; (1995), &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; (1997), &quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002), &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005), and &quot;Scary Movie 4&quot; (2006). He has played voice roles in various video games, including &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; (2001), &quot;Narc&quot; (2005), the &quot;Dishonored&quot; series (2012–2017), and &quot;Crime Boss: Rockay City&quot; (2023). Madsen has five children, including actor Christian Madsen.

== Early life ==
Madsen was born on September 25, 1958, in Chicago, Illinois. His mother, Elaine (née Melson), was a filmmaker and author. His father, Calvin Christian Madsen, was a World War II Navy veteran and a firefighter with the Chicago Fire Department. His parents divorced in the 1960s, and his mother left the financial world to pursue a career in the arts, encouraged by film critic Roger Ebert. His siblings are Cheryl Madsen, an entrepreneur, and Academy Award nominee Virginia Madsen. Madsen&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Danish, while his mother is Irish and Native American.

== Career ==
Madsen began working at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago, where he served as an apprentice under John Malkovich and appeared in a production of &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;.

His first notable film role was a small part for the science fiction film, &quot;WarGames&quot;. He appeared in John Dahl’s thriller &quot;Kill Me Again&quot; as criminal Vince Miller opposite Val Kilmer and Joanne Whalley. In Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s directorial debut film &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, Madsen played &quot;Mr. Blonde&quot;, a cruel criminal. Steve Buscemi received the role of &quot;Mr. Pink&quot;, which Madsen wanted because it had more scenes with Harvey Keitel. For &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, Madsen declined the role of Vincent Vega, which went to John Travolta. Madsen starred in the crime film &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot;. He once said of his later choice of film roles: &quot;Some of them I&#x27;m only in for 10 minutes, but they bought my name, and they bought my face to put on the DVD box with a gun. What people don&#x27;t always understand is that I established a certain lifestyle for my family back in the days of &quot;Species&quot; and &quot;Mulholland Falls&quot; and &quot;The Getaway&quot;. I wasn&#x27;t about to move my six kids into a trailer park. So when people offered me work, it wasn&#x27;t always the best, but I had to buy groceries and I had to put gas in the car.&quot;

Madsen played assassin Budd, the brother of Bill (David Carradine), in &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 2&quot;. In 2004, Tarantino discussed an idea for the film to unite Madsen and Travolta, as The Vega Brothers. In 2007, Tarantino said the film (which he intended to call &quot;Double V Vega&quot;) was &quot;kind of unlikely now&quot;, because of the age of the actors and the onscreen deaths of both characters.

Madsen appeared in Uwe Boll&#x27;s &quot;BloodRayne&quot;, a film he described as &quot;an abomination... It&#x27;s a horrifying and preposterous movie.&quot; He won Best Actor awards at the Boston Film Festival and New York International Independent Film and Video Festival for his performance in &quot;Strength and Honour&quot;. He played himself in the mockumentary &quot;Being Michael Madsen&quot;. Madsen co-starred in &quot;Coma&quot;, a Web series on Crackle.

He played Jim Ricker, the old friend of Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), in the eighth season of &quot;24&quot;. Madsen starred in the comedy film &quot;Let the Game Begin&quot;. On January 5, 2012, he entered the Celebrity Big Brother house, where he finished in 4th place in the final.

In February 2014, he played Las Vegas casino mogul Ted Binion in Josh Evans&#x27; film &quot;Death in the Desert&quot;. The screenplay was written by John Steppling, based on the book &quot;Death in the Desert&quot; by crime writer Cathy Scott.

In August 2014, he starred in the &quot;Kill Bill&quot;-themed music video for the song &quot;Black Widow&quot; by Iggy Azalea featuring Rita Ora.

Madsen starred in the ensemble western film &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;. He was among a number of people rumored to have leaked the film&#x27;s script before it was released, causing Tarantino to almost not make the film and eventually rewrite it. It was later revealed Madsen was not responsible for leaking the script. In 2016, he played a dramatized role of former Texas Ranger Phil Ryan in &quot;Real Detective&quot; on the &quot;Investigation Discovery&quot; network.

He executive produced in Vilan Trub&#x27;s crime drama film &quot;The Dirty Kind&quot;, which is loosely inspired by Anthony Weiner.

== Personal life ==
Madsen&#x27;s first wife was Georganne LaPiere, half-sister of singer and actress Cher. They met in 1983, married in 1984, and divorced in 1988.

He has a daughter named Jessica with Dana Mechling. Jessica was born March 24, 1979.

He was married to Jeannine Bisignano from 1991 to 1995. They have two sons, Christian and Max, who are both actors.

In 1996, he married DeAnna Morgan. The couple married in Ocho Rios, Jamaica while Madsen was on a break from shooting &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot;. Together they had three sons, Luke, Kalvin and Hudson. Hudson died by suicide in January 2022.

Madsen has a line of hot sauces called &quot;American Badass&quot;.

In February 2022, Madsen was arrested on a misdemeanor trespassing charge.

On August 17, 2024, Madsen was arrested on a battery charge after he reportedly assaulted his wife. He would be released after his bail was set at $20,000. Madsen was released from custody after posting the same bail. In September 2024, Madsen filed for divorce from his wife, DeAnna, of 28 years, alleging in the filing that she broke into his residence in Malibu and &quot;drove&quot; their son Hudson to suicide with her alleged &quot;neglect, drinking and alcoholism.&quot;

=== Charity work ===
Madsen received the award for his work with the Shriners Hospital for Children in 2002.

In September 2009, Madsen announced his participation in the 26th annual Love Ride to help raise money for local charities. The charity included celebrities Malcolm Forbes, Peter Fonda, Larry Hagman, Billy Idol and Bruce Springsteen, among others. The event was scheduled for October 25, 2009, but was ultimately canceled due to poor ticket sales and a decline in sponsorship.

Madsen hosted the event &quot;An Intimate Evening with Michael Madsen&quot; to benefit Children&#x27;s Pediatric Cancer in 2016.

<text>Washington Hunt (August 5, 1811 – February 2, 1867) was an American lawyer and politician.

==Life and career==

Hunt was born in Windham, New York. He moved to Lockport, New York in 1828 to study law, was admitted to the bar in 1834, and opened a law office on Market Street in 1835. He was First Judge of the Niagara County Court from 1836 to 1841.

He was elected as a Whig to the 28th, 29th and 30th United States Congresses, and served from March 4, 1843, to March 3, 1849.

He was elected New York State Comptroller by the State Legislature after the resignation of Millard Fillmore who had been elected U.S. Vice President. In November 1849, he was re-elected, but resigned the comptrollership after his election as Governor of New York the following year. He was Governor from 1851 to 1852, and was defeated for re-election by Horatio Seymour.

After the break-up of the Whig Party, Hunt, despite his previous association with the Seward/Weed faction of the party, was among the more conservative Whigs who refused to join the Republicans. Hunt was the chairman of the 1856 Whig National Convention and supported his fellow New York Whig, former president Millard Fillmore for the presidency in that year. In 1860, Hunt joined the Constitutional Union Party and supported its nominee for the presidency, John Bell. After it became clear that Bell could not win on his own in New York, Hunt was involved in the formation of a fusion ticket with the supporters of Democrat Stephen Douglas.

In his last years, Hunt moved increasingly closer to the Democrats, endorsing his two-time opponent, Horatio Seymour for the New York gubernatorial race in 1862 and supporting George McClellan for the presidency at the 1864 Democratic National Convention. On June 13, 1864, Hunt was at Niagara Falls to confer with Confederate Commissioner Jacob Thompson. He became a supporter of President Andrew Johnson after the war, and supported Johnson&#x27;s abortive &quot;National Union&quot; movement, serving as a delegate at the National Union Convention of 1866, which sought to join Democrats and conservative Republicans into a new party to support Johnson.

His brother was Major Edward B. Hunt, a West Point graduate, who was killed in October 1863 while working with an experimental weapons system.

He was buried at the Glenwood Cemetery in Lockport. His former Lockport home at 363 Market Street is in the Lowertown Historic District.

<doc id="643715" wikidata="Q1466229" url="?curid=643715" title="Yellow-billed oxpecker">
<text>The yellow-billed oxpecker (Buphagus africanus) is a passerine bird in the family Buphagidae. It was previously placed in the starling and myna family, Sturnidae.

It is native to the savannah of Sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal east to Sudan. It is least common in the extreme east of its range where it overlaps with the red-billed oxpecker, despite always dominating that species when feeding.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the yellow-billed oxpecker in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in Senegal. He used the French name &quot;Le pique-boeuf&quot; and the Latin &quot;Buphagus&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the yellow-billed oxpecker. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Buphaga africana&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. This species is placed in the genus &quot;Buphagus&quot; that was introduced by Brisson.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;B. a.&quot; subsp. &quot;africanus&quot; – Mauritania and Senegal to northwest Ethiopia south to northeast South Africa
* &quot;B. a.&quot; subsp. &quot;langi&quot; – Gabon, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo and west Angola

==Behavior==
The yellow-billed oxpecker nests in tree holes lined with hair plucked from livestock. It lays 2–3 eggs. Outside the breeding season it is fairly gregarious, forming large, chattering flocks. Non-breeding birds will roost on their host animals at night.

The yellow-billed oxpecker eats insects and ticks. Both the English and scientific names arise from this species&#x27; habit of perching on large wild and domesticated mammals such as cattle and eating arthropod parasites. It will also perch on antelopes such as wildebeest. In a day an adult will take more than 100 engorged female &quot;Boophilus decoloratus&quot; ticks or 13,000 larvae.

However, their preferred food is blood, and while they may take ticks bloated with blood, they also feed on it directly, pecking at the mammal&#x27;s wounds until blood flows. Whatever the net result, mammals generally tolerate oxpeckers.

The yellow-billed oxpecker is long and has plain brown upperparts and head, buff underparts and a pale rump. The feet are strong. The adults&#x27; bills are yellow at the base and red at the tip, while juveniles have brown bills. Its flight is strong and direct. The call is a hissy, crackling &quot;krisss, krisss&quot;.

<doc id="643718" wikidata="Q1138894" url="?curid=643718" title="Cranium (board game)">
<text>Cranium is a party game created by Whit Alexander and Richard Tait in 1998. Initially, &quot;Cranium&quot; was sold through Amazon.com and the Starbucks coffee chain, then-novel methods of distribution. After selling 44 million copies of &quot;Cranium&quot; and its sister titles, the game&#x27;s manufacturer Cranium, Inc. was bought by Hasbro, Inc. for $77.5 million in 2008. Billed as &quot;The Game for Your Whole Brain&quot;, &quot;Cranium&quot; includes a wide variety of activities, unlike many other party games. Murray Brand Commuications and brand strategist, Sonali Shah handled packaging and branding for the game, and the artwork is by cartoonist Gary Baseman.

==Gameplay==

To play &quot;Cranium&quot;, players form teams and start on the beginning spot of a long track that goes around the game board. At the start of a team&#x27;s turn, the team to their right selects a card and reads the task to them. If the task is completed successfully, the team rolls a colored die, and moves to the next spot that matches the color rolled. 

There are four equally dispersed colors of spaces along the track. Each color corresponds to a question card category that players must pull from on their turn. Red cards are &quot;Data Head&quot; tasks, where the team needs to answer questions. Yellow cards are &quot;Word Worm&quot;, where the team has to solve word problems, spell words, or solve anagrams. Blue cards are &quot;Creative Cat&quot; cards that require one player on the team to draw or use purple clay to sculpt answers that the other player must guess. Green cards are &quot;Star Performer&quot; cards, which requires one player to use charades, acting, or whistling so the rest of the team can guess the answer. 

Along the track are four &quot;Planet Cranium&quot; spots, marked as purple. Teams have to stop on these spots, even if their roll would take them further. On their next turn, they select a category of their choosing to complete a task. If they are successful on their first attempt of a &quot;Planet Cranium&quot; task, they move to a &quot;fast track&quot;, which has fewer spaces to traverse. If they are unsuccessful, they continue on the &quot;scenic route&quot;, which will take longer. 

Some cards in the decks are marked with &quot;Club Cranium&quot; symbols. If one of these cards is drawn, every team has to attempt the activity, and the winning team gets a bonus move. 

Once a team reaches the center of the board, they are in &quot;Cranium Central.&quot; The teams have to go around a circular section and collect one card from each category. Once that is accomplished, they are allowed into the final spot. At this point, on their turn the opposing teams choose a category for the team to complete. Completing the task wins the game, otherwise they have to try again on their next turn.

<text>Myron Holley Clark (October 23, 1806 – August 23, 1892) was an American politician from the U.S. state of New York.

==Early life==
Clark was born in Naples, Ontario County, New York on October 23, 1806. He was the eldest son of Maj. Joseph Clark (1782–1840) and Mary ( Sutton) Clark (1782–1865). His grandfather, Col. William Clark, had migrated to Ontario County from Berkshire County, Massachusetts, in 1790 after the American Revolution.

His education was limited and was in the common schools of New York.

==Career==

He served in the state&#x27;s militia as a lieutenant colonel and then entered politics, first serving as President of the then-village of Canandaigua, New York, and eventually becoming Sheriff of Ontario County, New York.

He was a member of the New York State Senate (29th D.) from 1852 to 1854, sitting in the 75th, 76th and 77th New York State Legislatures. At the New York state election, 1854, he was nominated as the Whig candidate, and was elected Governor of New York in the closest gubernatorial election in New York State history. He served as Governor from January 1, 1855, to December 31, 1856.

As Governor, Clark was noted for his meddling with militia appointments, causing the resignation of the state Adjutant General John Watts de Peyster. In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Clark the first Collector of Internal Revenue of in the Ontario County district.

Clark made several attempts to effect prohibition in the state and signed a prohibition law while governor, but the law was declared unconstitutional by the New York Court of Appeals. His steadfast advocating of temperance led to his nomination on the Prohibition ticket to run again for Governor at the New York state election, 1874. He finished in third place, behind Democrat Samuel J. Tilden and the incumbent Republican Governor John Adams Dix.

==Personal life==
In 1830 Clark was married to Zilpha Watkins (1806–1877), a daughter of Andrew Watkins and Abigail ( Stanley) Watkins. Together, they were the parents of five children, one son and four daughters, including:

* Lorenzo Elijah Clark (1833–1917), a banker who married Elizabeth Sheley, a daughter of Alanson Sheley.
* Zilpha Clark (1834–1915), who married Samuel D. Backus.
* Mary Lee Clark (1835–1923), who married prominent banker Frederick Ferris Thompson.
* Charlotte Elizabeth Clark (1838–1929), who died unmarried.
* Abigail Stanley Clark (1843–1902), who married banker George Norton Williams, in 1866.

Clark died in Canandaigua, New York on August 23, 1892. He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in Canandaigua.

===Legacy===
As a memorial to Clark, his daughter Mary presented a scenic and geologically significant tract of land to New York State in 1915 that is now part of Clark Reservation State Park. Comptroller Clark Williams was his grandson.

<doc id="643725" wikidata="Q1437158" url="?curid=643725" title="New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy">
<text>The New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy is a debate in the politics of New Zealand. It concerns the ownership of the country&#x27;s foreshore and seabed, with many Māori groups claiming that Māori have a rightful claim to title (indigenous title). These claims are based around historical possession and the Treaty of Waitangi. On 18 November 2004, the New Zealand Parliament passed a law which deems the title to be held by the Crown. This law, the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004, was enacted on 24 November 2004. Some sections of the act came into force on 17 January 2005. It was repealed and replaced by the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011.

==Origins==

===&quot;Ngati Apa v Attorney-General&quot;===

In 1997, an application was made to the Māori Land Court requesting, amongst other matters, that &quot;the foreshore and seabed of the Marlborough Sounds, extending the limits of New Zealand&#x27;s territorial sea&quot; be defined as Māori customary land under the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. The Māori Land Court determined that it could consider the issue, but was overruled by the High Court. On 19 June 2003, New Zealand&#x27;s Court of Appeal ruled in &quot;Ngati Apa v Attorney-General&quot;, amongst other matters, that:

# &quot;The definition of &#x27;land&#x27; in Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 did not necessarily exclude foreshore and seabed&quot;;
# &quot;The title vested in the Crown was radical title which was not inconsistent with native title&quot;;
# Various Acts had influence over but did not extinguish property rights;
# The Maori Land Court had jurisdiction to determine &quot;an investigation of the title to the land ... under s 132 and an order determining the relative interests of the owners of the land&quot;.

=== &quot;In Re the Ninety-Mile Beach&quot; ===

The Court of Appeal overturned a line of precedent dating back to the 1877 decision in &quot;Wi Parata v Bishop of Wellington&quot;, and affirmed by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in the 1963 &quot;Ninety Mile Beach&quot; decision. These early decisions held that because of circumstances unique to New Zealand, Māori land ties were so weak that they could be extinguished through such indirect routes as unrelated phrases in legislation or through the Māori Land Court’s investigation of dry land adjoining the foreshore.

In its ruling, the Court of Appeal found that &quot;native property rights are not to be extinguished by a side wind... The need for &#x27;clear and plain&#x27; extinguishment is well established and is not met in this case. In the &quot;Ninety-Mile Beach&quot; case, the Court did not recognise that principle of interpretation&quot;. The ruling was foreshadowed by academic work during the late 1980s and 1990s, which argued that the &quot;Ninety Mile Beach&quot; case was wrongly decided.

===Initial responses===
The ruling granted only the right to pursue establishing an interest. Experts such as Paul McHugh of Cambridge University stated that this was unlikely to result in full exclusive ownership, but these assurances were not strong enough to counter the perception that the door was now open for Māori to claim title to the entire coastline of New Zealand through the Māori Land Court. The prospect of a successful claim was reported as having created considerable hostility in many sectors of society as New Zealand has a strong tradition of public access to beaches and waterways and this was perceived as being under threat. The prime minister, Helen Clark of the Labour Party, announced that the government would legislate to ensure public ownership of the foreshore and seabed.

At the same time, however, the government was strongly attacked by the opposition National Party, led by Don Brash. In sharp contrast to Te Ope Mana a Tai, the National Party claimed that the government&#x27;s proposals were too favourable towards Māori. While the government&#x27;s plan did indeed vest ownership in the state, they also incorporated provision for Māori to be consulted over matters relating to the foreshore and seabed. The National Party claimed that Māori were to be given too much control, and that the government was giving rights to Māori over and above those possessed by other New Zealanders.

Once the Government&#x27;s policy framework was released, the Waitangi Tribunal held an urgent inquiry into the government policy. The hearing took place over six days in late January 2004, and a report was issued four weeks later. The tribunal issued a report that was highly critical of the Crown’s approach. The Government response was equally sharp and critical, accusing the tribunal of ‘implicitly’ rejecting the principle of parliamentary sovereignty.. The Attorney-General, taking a more middle ground, conceded that the policy was prima facie discriminatory, but concluded that this infringement was &quot;demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society&quot; under section 5 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The Human Rights Commission took another view, arguing that the legislation was discriminatory and not justified by section 5.

==Ongoing debate==

Although under attack from both sides, the government chose to press forward with its legislation, asserting that what it called its &quot;middle way&quot; was the only means of satisfactorily resolving the controversy. Criticism of the government, both from Māori and from opposition parties, continued to intensify, and the government began to lose ground in opinion polls.

On 27 January 2004, National Party leader Don Brash delivered a speech at Orewa that was highly critical of the government&#x27;s policy towards Māori. Brash said that the government was showing strong favouritism to Māori, both in the foreshore and seabed debate and in many other areas of government policy. Brash&#x27;s speech was condemned both by the government and by many Māori groups, but met with widespread approval from many other sectors of New Zealand society. This support was boosted by the successful ‘iwi/Kiwi’ billboard campaign which followed Brash’s speech. These billboards framed the foreshore debate as the Labour Party’s attempt to restrict public access to beaches, while the National Party would protect this aspect of the ‘Kiwi way of life’. Shortly afterwards, an opinion poll put the National Party ahead of the Labour Party for the first time in over 18 months.

The government was also facing serious internal debate over its proposed legislation. Many of the party&#x27;s Māori MPs were deeply unhappy with the government&#x27;s plans, and raised the possibility of breaking ranks to oppose the legislation in Parliament. This left the government unsure of whether it had a sufficient number of votes to pass its legislation through Parliament. In theory, the government had a narrow majority willing to support its proposed bill, with Labour, the Progressives, and United Future all prepared to vote in favour. If two of Labour&#x27;s Māori MPs were to vote against the bill, however, it would fail. Moreover, any attempt to make the bill more favourable to these MPs would risk losing the support of United Future.

On 8 April 2004, it was announced that the centrist-nationalist New Zealand First party would give its support to the legislation. New Zealand First&#x27;s price for this support was that ownership of the seabed and foreshore would be vested solely in the Crown, ending the concept of &quot;public domain&quot; (vesting ownership in the public at large rather than in the state) that United Future had promoted. United Future withdrew its support for the legislation, but New Zealand First provided sufficient votes to make this irrelevant. It is believed that Helen Clark preferred United Future&#x27;s &quot;public domain&quot;, and this was acknowledged by United Future leader Peter Dunne, but United Future could not provide enough votes to guarantee the bill&#x27;s passage, forcing Labour to seek support elsewhere.

One of the strongest critics of the bill within the Labour Party was Tariana Turia, a junior minister. Turia indicated on a number of occasions that she might vote against the government&#x27;s bill, but for a considerable time refused to give a final decision. It was made clear that voting against a government bill was &quot;incompatible&quot; with serving as a minister, and that doing so would result in Turia&#x27;s dismissal from that role. Turia was encouraged to either abstain or simply be absent when the vote was taken. On 30 April, however, Turia announced that she would vote against the legislation, and would resign (effective 17 May 2004) from the Labour Party to contest a by-election in her electorate. She was dismissed from her ministerial post by the Prime Minister the same day. Another Labour MP, Nanaia Mahuta, eventually decided that she would also vote against the bill, but chose not to leave the Labour Party. Mahuta had no ministerial post to be dismissed from.
On 5 May 2004, a hīkoi (a long walk or march — in this case, a protest march) arrived in Wellington. It had begun in Northland thirteen days earlier, picking up supporters as they drove to the capital. The hīkoi, which some estimated to contain fifteen thousand people by the time it reached Parliament, strongly opposed the government&#x27;s plans, and was highly supportive of Tariana Turia&#x27;s decision.

Turia and her allies, believing that the time was right for an independent Māori political vehicle, established a new Māori Party. Many of Turia&#x27;s supporters, such as Mana Motuhake leader Willie Jackson and Māori academic Pita Sharples, claimed that Māori who formerly supported Labour would flock to the new party en masse. On the other hand, other commentators pointed to a poor track record for Māori parties in the past, and said that it would be difficult to unite diverse Māori opinion into a single group.

On 18 November 2004, Tim Selwyn put an axe through a window of the electorate office of Helen Clark, an act he described as a protest against Helen Clark&#x27;s handling of the issue.

==Legislation==
On 18 November 2004, the Labour–Progressive government passed the Foreshore and Seabed Act, which declared that the land in question was owned by the Crown. Māori can, however, apply for &quot;guardianship&quot; of certain areas. The act was highly contentious.
The government&#x27;s foreshore and seabed bill passed its first vote in Parliament on 7 May 2004, backed by Labour, the Progressives, and New Zealand First. The National Party opposed the bill, saying that it gave too much control to Māori, United Future opposed it due to the removal of the public domain concept and ACT opposed it on the grounds of the legislation being retrospective, that it was a denial of property rights (in this case Māori property rights), and that it was an unwarranted incursion by the Crown into areas that were specifically Tikanga Māori . The Greens, another party in Parliament to take a position similar to that of the Māori protesters, also voted against the bill, saying that it overrode Māori rights and offered no guarantee that the land would not later be sold. Tariana Turia and Nanaia Mahuta both voted against the bill. The first vote tally was 65 in favour and 55 against. Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen, told Parliament that the bill &quot;safeguards the seabed and foreshore for everyone&quot;, protecting the rights of both Māori and non-Māori. Opposition to the bill remained strong, however, and protests and criticism continued as the government&#x27;s legislation progressed.

The bill&#x27;s passage through its first vote meant that it was then considered by a special select committee of Parliament, which heard public submissions on the matter. The select committee having allowed six months for submissions, reported back to the parliament in November that they had been unable to agree on a position and were therefore reporting back the bill with no recommendations whatsoever. The bill, slightly amended by the Government itself, passed its second vote on 17 November 2004 by the same margin as in the first vote. It was then considered by a Committee of the House (with Parliament sitting under urgency). It finally received its third vote on 18 November 2004. The final vote tally was 66 in favour and 54 against — Nanaia Mahuta, who had previously voted against, this time voted in favour.

On 15 December, the legislation was modified slightly after it was realised that as it was written, the act nationalised all council-owned land reclaimed from the sea. This included areas such as Auckland&#x27;s Britomart and Wellington&#x27;s waterfront. This was not part of the intention of the act.

The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, after being asked by Te Runanga o Ngāi Tahu to consider the legislation, issued a report on 12 March 2005 stating that the foreshore and seabed legislation discriminates against Māori by extinguishing the possibility of establishing Māori customary title over the foreshore and seabed, and by not providing a means of redress. Tariana Turia and the Māori Party claimed this as a significant victory, although the report did not prompt any change in government policy. 

==Situation following the controversy==
The foreshore and seabed issue, as part of the larger race relations debate, was one of the most significant points of contention in New Zealand politics at the time, and remains a significant issue for many people. The Labour government&#x27;s popularity was severely damaged by the affair, although subsequent polls showed that it recovered its support and Labour was elected for a third term in September 2005.

While the act was widely criticised by Māori, some iwi have chosen to negotiate agreement within the bounds of the act. The first agreement made through the act was ratified by Ngāti Porou and the Crown in October 2008 (see below).

===Special Rapporteur===
In November 2005, following government criticism of the report issued by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (UNCERD), Special Rapporteur Professor Stavenhagen, a Mexican researcher who reports to UNCERD, arrived in New Zealand at the invitation of the Government. He attended four hui and heard severe criticism of the government. He also met with Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen who crafted the foreshore law. While the foreshore and seabed issue was central to his visit, discussions also related to Treaty of Waitangi settlements, and economic, social and cultural rights generally. On 25 November 2005 he issued a statement which noted that “[w]hile the standard of living of the Māori of New Zealand has improved and is better than that of indigenous peoples in poorer countries, there is widespread concern that the gap in social and economic conditions is actually growing larger and an increasing proportion of Māori are being left behind”. His final report was completed in March 2006. It was highly critical of the Government in a number of areas, including the Foreshore and Seabed Act, which it recommended should be repealed or significantly amended. The Government response to this further criticism was again negative describing Professor Stavenhagen&#x27;s report as &quot;disappointing, unbalanced and narrow&quot;.

In October 2006, Tariana Turia (of Te Pāti Māori) introduced a member&#x27;s bill designed to repeal the Foreshore and Seabed Act. In recreating the legal status before the Foreshore and Seabed Act was passed, however, the bill was reported to vest ownership of the foreshore and seabed in the Crown. Turia denied that her bill would do anything but repeal the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004 in its entirety and described Labour&#x27;s descriptions as &quot;scaremongering&quot;.

===First foreshore and seabed agreement signed===
The first foreshore and seabed agreement was ratified on 31 October 2008. The agreement was negotiated between people of the Ngāti Porou area on New Zealand&#x27;s East Cape and the Crown (effectively the New Zealand government). The NZPA reported about 200 people representing Ngāti Porou were present to witness the signing of the deed. The deed protects customary rights of local iwi and retains wider public access to Ngāti Porou coastal areas.

===Continued calls for repeal===
Following a change of government with the election of National in November 2008, the Green Party continued to call for repeal of the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004.

National front bencher Christopher Finlayson, sworn in as Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations in November 2008, described the act as &quot;discriminatory and unfair&quot;. Commentary at the time of his appointment suggested the Foreshore and Seabed Act would be reviewed under a National government.

===Announcement of repeal===
On 14 June 2010, Prime Minister John Key announced that he would be proposing the repeal of the act. The replacement Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011 in turn created opposition from both sides. Some Māori argued that the bill was a fraud as essentially no Māori groups would meet the test for increased rights to the foreshore, while others, such as the Coastal Coalition, felt that the bill risks free access to coastal areas for a large part of New Zealanders.

===2024 Customary marine title controversy===
On 21 May 2024, Treaty Negotiations Minister Paul Goldsmith and Oceans Fisheries Minister Shane Jones met with seafood industry representatives to discuss Customary Marine Titles. According to meeting notes, both ministers were sympathetic to industry concerns about the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011 and supported proposed law changes to reduce the 100% of coastline subject to customary title to 5%, which would make it harder for Māori to claim foreshore and sea customary title. Following the meeting, the Government announced changes to foreshore and seabed legislation covering Māori customary titles. The meeting was also attended by Te Arawhiti (Office for Māori Crown Relations) deputy secretary Tui Marsh and officials from the Ministry for Primary Industries.

In late July 2024, Goldsmith confirmed that the National-led coalition government would disregard a 2023 New Zealand Court of Appeal ruling that lowered the threshold for proving Māori customary marine title claims. Goldsmith announce that the Government would amend section 58 of the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011 to require marine title claimants to prove they had continual exclusive use and ownership of the area since 1840. This law change was part of National&#x27;s coalition agreement with NZ First. In response, Te Pāti Māori MP Tākuta Ferris accused the Government of taking away Māori rights and warned that the Government should expect protests.

On 26 August 2024, the Waitangi Tribunal began holding an urgent inquiry into the Government&#x27;s plans to change the law to tighten the threshold for Māori customary marine title claims. On the first two days, the Tribunal heard testimony from Treaty of Waitangi lawyer Tom Bennion and Te Arawhiti deputy secretary Tui Marsh. On 13 September, the Tribunal released its initial report into the proposed changes to the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011. It criticised the Government for ignoring official advice, failing to consult Māori and for breaching several principles including active protection and good governance.

In October 2024, the Attorney-General Judith Collins appealed the Court of Appeal&#x27;s 2023 decision to lower the threshold for proving Māori customary foreshore and seabed claims to the Supreme Court of New Zealand. On 2 December, the Supreme Court upheld the Attorney-General&#x27;s appeal, ruling that the lower court had erred in its approach to interpreting the threshold within the framework of the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011.

<text>Adagio for Strings is a work by Samuel Barber arranged for string orchestra from the second movement of his String Quartet, Op. 11.

Barber finished the arrangement in 1936, the same year that he wrote the quartet. It was performed for the first time on November 5, 1938, by Arturo Toscanini conducting the NBC Symphony Orchestra in a radio broadcast from NBC Studio 8H. Toscanini also conducted the piece on his South American tour with the NBC Symphony in 1940.

Its reception has generally been positive, with Alexander J. Morin writing that &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; is &quot;full of pathos and cathartic passion&quot; and that it &quot;rarely leaves a dry eye&quot;. The music is the setting for Barber&#x27;s 1967 choral arrangement of &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;. It has been called &quot;America&#x27;s semi-official music for mourning.&quot; &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; has been featured in many TV and movie soundtracks.

== History ==
Barber&#x27;s &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; was originally the second movement of his String Quartet, Op. 11, composed in 1936 while he was spending a summer in Europe with Gian Carlo Menotti, an Italian composer and Barber&#x27;s partner since their student years at the Curtis Institute of Music. Barber was inspired by Virgil&#x27;s didactic poem &quot;Georgics&quot;. In the quartet, the &quot;Adagio&quot; follows a violently contrasting first movement (&quot;Molto allegro e appassionato&quot;) and is succeeded by a third movement that opens with a brief reprise of the music from the first movement (marked &quot;Molto allegro (come prima) – Presto&quot;).

In January 1938, Barber sent an orchestrated version of the &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; to Arturo Toscanini. The conductor returned the score without comment, which annoyed Barber. Toscanini sent word through Menotti that he was planning to perform the piece and had returned it simply because he had already memorized it. It was reported that Toscanini did not look at the music again until the day before the premiere. On November 5, 1938, a selected audience was invited to Studio 8H in Rockefeller Center to watch Toscanini conduct the first performance; it was broadcast on radio and also recorded. Initially, the critical reception was mixed. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Olin Downes praised the piece, but he was reproached by other critics who claimed that he overrated it.

Toscanini conducted &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; in South America and Europe, the first performances of the work on both continents. Over April 16–19, 1942, the piece had public performances by the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy at Carnegie Hall. Like the original 1938 performance, these were broadcast on radio and recorded.

== Composition ==
&quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; begins softly with a B played by the first violins.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;string ensemble 1&quot; \clef treble \key bes \minor \time 4/2 \tempo &quot;Molto adagio&quot; bes\breve(~\pp\&lt; | bes4\! a bes c a bes c bes | c\&lt; des bes c des c des ees | \time 5/2 c1.\! } &lt;/score&gt;

The lower strings come in two beats after the violins, which, as Johanna Keller from &quot;The New York Times&quot; put it, creates &quot;an uneasy, shifting suspension as the melody begins a stepwise motion, like the hesitant climbing of stairs&quot;. NPR Music said that &quot;with a tense melodic line and taut harmonies, the composition is considered by many to be the most popular of all 20th-century orchestral works.&quot; Thomas Larson remarked that the piece &quot;evokes a deep sadness in those who hear it&quot;. Many recordings of the piece have a duration of about eight minutes. According to music theorist Matthew BaileyShea, the &quot;Adagio&quot; &quot;features a deliberately archaic sound, with Renaissance-like polyphony and simple tertian harmonies&quot; underlying a &quot;chant-like melody&quot;. The work is in &quot;the key of B minor (with some modal inflections)&quot;.

The &quot;Adagio&quot; is an example of arch form and builds on a melody that first ascends and then descends in stepwise fashion. Barber subtly manipulates the pulse throughout the work by varying the primary time signature with isolated measures of , , and . After four climactic chords and a long pause, the piece presents the opening theme again and fades away on an unresolved dominant chord.

Music critic Olin Downes wrote that the piece is very simple at climaxes but reasoned that the simple chords create significance for the piece. Downes went on to say: &quot;That is because we have here honest music, by an honest musician, not striving for pretentious effect, not behaving as a writer would who, having a clear, short, popular word handy for his purpose, got the dictionary and fished out a long one.&quot;

== Critical reception ==
Alexander J. Morin, author of &quot;Classical Music: The Listener&#x27;s Companion&quot; (2001), said that the piece was &quot;full of pathos and cathartic passion&quot; and that it &quot;rarely leaves a dry eye&quot;. Reviewing the premiere performance in 1938, Olin Downes noted that with the piece, Barber &quot;achieved something as perfect in mass and detail as his craftsmanship permits&quot;.

In an edition of &quot;A Conductor&#x27;s Analysis of Selected Works&quot;, John William Mueller devoted over 20 pages to &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot;. Wayne Clifford Wentzel, author of &quot;Samuel Barber: A Research and Information Guide (Composer Resource Manuals)&quot;, said that it was a piece usually selected for a closing act because it was moderately famous. Roy Brewer, writer for AllMusic, said that it was one of the most recognizable pieces of American concert music.
The musicologist Bill McGlaughlin compares its role in American music to the role that Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Nimrod&quot; holds for the British.

As part of a musical retrospective in 2000, NPR named &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; one of the 100 most important American musical works of the 20th century, calling it &quot;standard repertoire for today&#x27;s orchestras, and Barber&#x27;s best-known work&quot;. In 2019, NPR revisited the piece, with writer Anastasia Tsioulcas suggesting it arrived at &quot;the right moment, when America was still hurting from the Great Depression and Europe was sliding into war.&quot; She continued by noting how young people reinterpret &quot;America&#x27;s semi-official music for mourning&quot; as an expression of joy, using the example of Dutch DJ Tiësto&#x27;s remix of &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; as a dance music anthem, which caught the attention of the 2004 Olympics Organizers in Athens (ATHOC) and is included on &quot;Parade of the Athletes&quot;, Tiësto&#x27;s retrospective mix of his live set performed during the opening ceremony.

In 2004, listeners to the BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; program voted &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; the &quot;saddest classical&quot; work ever, ahead of &quot;Dido&#x27;s Lament&quot; from &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; by Henry Purcell, the Adagietto from Gustav Mahler&#x27;s 5th symphony, &quot;Metamorphosen&quot; by Richard Strauss, and &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot; as sung by Billie Holiday.

== Arrangements ==
G. Schirmer has published several alternate arrangements for &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot;. They include:

*Solo organ (1949)William Strickland
*Clarinet choir (1964)Lucien Cailliet
*Woodwind band (1967)John O&#x27;Reilly
*&quot;Agnus Dei&quot; (1967)Samuel BarberLatin text setting of &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; (&quot;Lamb of God&quot;) for chorus with optional organ or piano accompaniment
*Chorus with strings (2021)Jonathan Manners, also setting the Agnus Dei text. Performed on the 20th anniversary of September 11 attacks (9/11) at The Last Night of the Proms 2021, London UK, in memory of those lost. The new arrangement was performed 20 years after the original &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; was performed at the 2001 Last Night to honour the memory of the victims of 9/11, conducted by Leonard Slatkin.

Strickland, while assistant organist at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church in New York, had been impressed by Toscanini&#x27;s recording of the work and had submitted his own arrangement for organ to Schirmers. After he made contact with Barber at a musical soirée in 1939, he learned that his transcription had received a lukewarm response from the composer. Strickland, subsequently appointed wartime director of music at the Army&#x27;s Fort Myer in Virginia, became a champion of Barber&#x27;s new compositions. He continued to correspond with the composer.

In 1945 Barber wrote to Strickland, expressing his dissatisfaction with previously proposed organ arrangements; he encouraged Strickland to discuss and prepare his own version for publication.

Strickland, having kept the piece, sent his organ arrangement to G. Schirmer. The company published it in 1949.

== Notable usage ==
The recording of the world premiere in 1938, with Arturo Toscanini conducting the NBC Symphony Orchestra, was selected in 2005 for permanent preservation in the National Recording Registry at the United States Library of Congress. Since the 1938 recording, the &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; has frequently been heard throughout the world, particularly in times of mourning. It was one of the few American pieces to be played in the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Barber voiced misgivings with the piece&#x27;s ubiquity, saying in a 1978 interview, &quot;They always play that piece. I wish they&#x27;d play some of my other pieces.&quot;

Notable invocations or performances of the piece include:

* Played at the funeral of Albert Einstein (1955).

<doc id="643729" wikidata="Q4785335" url="?curid=643729" title="Arch form">
<text>In music, arch form is a sectional structure for a piece of music based on repetition, in reverse order, of all or most musical sections such that the overall form is symmetric, most often around a central movement. The sections need not be repeated verbatim but must at least share thematic material.

It creates interest through interplay among &quot;memory, variation, and progression&quot;. Though the form appears to be static and to deny progress, the pairs of movements create an &quot;undirectional process&quot; with the center, and the form &quot;actually engenders specific expressive possibilities that would otherwise be unavailable for the work as a whole&quot;.

Béla Bartók is noted for his use of arch form, e.g., in his fourth and fifth string quartets, Concerto for Orchestra, &quot;Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta&quot;, second piano concerto, and, to a lesser extent, in his second violin concerto. Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; and Shostakovich&#x27;s String Quartet No. 8 in C minor also use arch form.

The most popular arch-form structure is ABCBA.

<text>Mimico is a neighbourhood (and a former municipality) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, being located in the south-west area of Toronto on Lake Ontario. It is in the south-east corner of the former Township (and later, City) of Etobicoke, and was an independent municipality from 1911 to 1967.

Mimico is the oldest of the former Lakeshore Municipalities. The Town of Mimico was established by a plan of sub-division in 1856, but was not sub-divided from the former Township of Etobicoke until 1911. The land area of Mimico originated mainly from three family farms, namely: Stock Estate (North of Portland), Hendry Estate (between Royal York and Queens Ave), Van Every Estate (between Royal York Rd and Dwight Ave). Mimico was an independent municipality until 1967, when it was amalgamated into the new Borough of Etobicoke (later, City of, in 1984), which was itself amalgamated in 1998 into the current city of Toronto.

Today, Mimico is primarily a residential area with two commercial strips; one along Royal York Road and the other along Lake Shore Boulevard West, parallel to the shoreline (from Louisa Avenue to Allen Avenue). There is also a former commercial strip along Mimico Avenue connecting Royal York Road and Lake Shore Boulevard West. Some areas of industrial use exist along the railway corridor. In early 2012, &quot;Toronto Life&quot; magazine ranked Mimico first on their &quot;Where to Buy Now&quot; list of Toronto neighbourhoods.

==Etymology==
The name &#x27;Mimico&#x27; is derived from the Ojibwe word &quot;omiimiikaa&quot; meaning &quot;abundant with wild pigeons&quot; (c.f. 19th century Mississaugas &quot;omiimii&quot;, &quot;pigeon&quot;). The &#x27;pigeon&#x27; after which Mimico was named was the Passenger pigeon. It was thought to have been the most numerous species in the world at the time European colonization began in North America and is now extinct.

==Boundaries==

The former Town of Mimico is bounded by Evans Avenue, Algoma Street and Manitoba Street to the north, Lake Ontario to the south, a line midway between Fleeceline Road and Louisa Street to the East, with the western boundary along a line through Dwight Avenue (south of the railway mainline) and St. George Street (north of the railway mainline). These boundaries for Mimico are defined on City of Toronto zoning maps. See:

# Town of Mimico, Ward Map (1930)
# City of Toronto, Urban Development Services West District, map, Etobicoke Zoning Mimico South
# Toronto, City Planning West District, map, Etobicoke Zoning Mimico North

The Mimico &quot;neighbourhood planning area&quot; starts at the Humber River to the east, its northern boundary being the Gardiner Expressway as far west as the CPR north-south railway line west of Kipling Avenue. The western boundary follows the CPR railway line south to the CNR railway line. The western boundary then continues along the CNR railway line to Dwight Avenue, then south along Dwight Avenue to Lake Ontario. This planning area includes part of the former Township of Etobicoke (including parts of Humber Bay and Alderwood), and are used for planning purposes (which also match the census tracts for that area). This planning area also includes the recent Humber Bay Shores condominium developments along Lakeshore Boulevard West east of Mimico at the former &quot;Motel Strip&quot; area of Humber Bay, as well as the industrial areas along the rail lines to the west and an area to the north, all of which comprised part of the Township of Etobicoke.

These other areas outside Mimico were never part of the Town of Mimico and are not considered part of the Mimico neighbourhood.

==Character==

Historically, The Town of Mimico had few municipal buildings and none of these survive. Architecturally, homes in Mimico range from grand lakeside estates to bungalows built in the 1920s to 1940s, and low rise apartment buildings built in the 1950s and 1960s. East of historic Mimico between Mimico Creek on the west and the Humber River to the east, there is a large area of condominium high-rise tower development at the former &quot;Motel Strip&quot; area of Humber Bay along the lake shore.
Lake Shore Blvd. West is also home to many Eastern European delicatessen, independent stores and bakeries, giving the area an Eastern European atmosphere.

Businesses in Mimico&#x27;s commercial strips along Royal York (north of the railway tracks) and Lake Shore Boulevard West (South of the railway tracks) have organised themselves into two Business Improvement Areas: &#x27;Mimico Village&#x27; (along Royal York Rd. in northern Mimico) and &#x27;Mimico by the Lake&#x27; (the heart of the former &#x27;Mimico Beach&#x27; postal area along the lakeshore in eastern Mimico).

==History==
After arriving in the Toronto area, Elizabeth Simcoe, wife of Upper Canada&#x27;s first Governor and the founder of Toronto, refers to the large number of (passenger) pigeons after which Mimico is named. The area known as &quot;Mimico&quot; was originally located up the Mimico Creek at Dundas Street, where Upper Canada&#x27;s early highway connecting Toronto to the west and the community of Mimico were located. 

One of Etobicoke&#x27;s most prominent businessmen, William Gamble, opened a sawmill on the west bank of Mimico Creek up from the lake, and a small settlement for the mill workers was built nearby. With Mr Gamble&#x27;s patronage Etobicoke&#x27;s first church, Christ Church (Anglican), was opened on Church Street (Royal York Road). At this time, Mimico was in Etobicoke Township, which had been meeting with the other townships in the southern part of the County of York (what would become Metropolitan Toronto) as the Township of York (excluding the Town of York, later City of Toronto). Mr. Gamble eventually moved his business away, but with the addition of a school at the foot of Church St (Royal York Rd), Mimico would not disappear.

===Early development (1850–1905)===
By 1850, after the Union of The Canadas, Etobicoke was formally recognised as a Township. The Great Western Railway (originally chartered as the Toronto &amp; Hamilton Railway) was built through the southern part of the Township. The first Mimico railway station opened in 1855, just north of the tracks beside Christ Church on Church St. (now Royal York Rd.). A plan of subdivision was commissioned with side-streets for the &#x27;Town of Mimico&#x27;. Mimico was advertised as being &#x27;8 minutes&#x27; from Toronto (by train), then bordered by Dufferin St. In 1858, a Mimico post office had been opened just south of the Railway Station on Church St. (Royal York Rd.) where St. Leo&#x27;s Church is today and in 1863, the Wesley Methodist Church was established.

This prompted the original Mimico area on Dundas St. to adopt a new name; Islington. In Tremaine&#x27;s 1860 Map of York County, the Mimico subdivision is reprinted with all its side streets, however by 1861, the plan had already failed, the area largely returning to agricultural use. Mimico&#x27;s founding families were therefore mostly farmers: the Van Everys (Loyalists), the Hendrys and the Stocks.

Between 1883 and 1893, there were 13 separate annexations to the City of Toronto which brought the border of that city to the Humber River. In 1890, the Mimico Real Estate Security Company Ltd was formed to divide and sell lots in Mimico. This plan included the subdivision of Mr. Edward Stock&#x27;s land as far north as the Stock&#x27;s Side Road (an extension of Toronto&#x27;s Queen Street, now the Queensway) and a cattle path he had established as a shortcut from Church St. (Royal York Rd.) to Lake Shore Road became Mimico Avenue.

Around that time, the Mimico area was incorrectly shown on some fire insurance plans as extending North of Lake Ontario, West of the Humber River, South of North Queen Street (Delroy Drive) and East of Mimico Avenue (now Kipling Avenue), as the community of Mimico was located in the immediate vicinity of the railway station and post office. A year later a Presbyterian Church was built on Mimico Avenue. Mimico was expected to grow quickly. A second post office was opened in the Town of New Toronto (established in 1890). A small number of Victorian buildings were built on the newly laid out streets assuring that this time they would not simply disappear. Mimico and the other lakeshore communities west of the Humber River were eventually linked by an independent radial railway line run by the Toronto and Mimico Electric Railway and Light Company, which originated in the Sunnyside area. This line was originally intended to link with a line started from Hamilton. However, the western end of the T&amp;M was never completed past Port Credit.

The radial railway line brought many of Toronto&#x27;s wealthy to Mimico&#x27;s waterfront area, where several large estates were built. First and most impressive of which was the Featherstonaugh Estate which was shaped like a castle at the bottom of Royal York Rd. This period in which Mimico took shape was also the period in which Mimico&#x27;s namesake, the passenger pigeon, disappeared from the area, the last known bird dying near the beginning of the next century in the United States. A Mimico resident, Mr. John Kay on noticing the disappearance of this species donated a stuffed passenger pigeon to the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto to preserve some of the last evidence of what had been Mimico&#x27;s namesake.

===Incorporation (1905–1967)===

Mimico became a police village in 1905 and the next year the Grand Trunk Railway&#x27;s Mimico railway yards were opened. Mimico became a village in 1911 electing its first Village Reeve, Robert Skelton. The same year, a second post office named &#x27;Mimico Beach&#x27; was established to serve the southern half of Mimico, located on Lake Shore Road. Mimico became the smallest community to obtain a Carnegie Library in which the town council met at first. The first immigrants began to arrive in Mimico and at this time Etobicoke&#x27;s first Catholic Church was built in Mimico, St. Leo&#x27;s.

Mimico&#x27;s largest employer was traditionally the railway (with its yards mostly located in New Toronto), but because New Toronto was planned as an industrial town, many larger industries located there. Nevertheless, a new train station was needed and was built on the south side of the tracks near the north end of Station Road. In 1909, a hotel was established beside the railway called the Windsor Hotel (today the Blue Goose Tavern). Although other 1890s subdivisions in Toronto at Roncesvalles and the Beaches were entirely built up in the pre-war years, Mimico&#x27;s growth was slow with no street being fully built and some still without any residences built on them. Nevertheless, many foursquare houses were built mostly in south-central Mimico in this period. In 1916, a referendum was held on the question of New Toronto joining Mimico, this was accepted by Mimico voters but rejected in New Toronto. Mimico incorporated as a fully independent town in 1917.

During the First World War, in 1917, Mimico became fully independent and elected its first Mayor, John Harrison, by acclamation. The town also reacted to the sensational execution of British Nurse Edith Cavell by naming Mimico&#x27;s old Southampton Street in her memory in 1916. Another street was also given this name in Toronto&#x27;s East End leading to recent attempts by Toronto to rename Mimico&#x27;s Cavell Ave. At the end of the war, the local chapter of the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire, who met at the Carnegie Library, presented the town with two plaques honouring all those from the town who had enlisted and another honouring those who had died.

With the union of the Methodist, Congregational and many Presbyterian churches, the old Wesley Methodist Church on Church St (Royal York Rd) became vacant as a new United Church was built on Mimico Ave. The Town of Mimico purchased the old Methodist Church which served as the Town Hall. In 1922, Mimico&#x27;s Baptist Church was built. Many bungalow style -storey homes were built in the interwar years, especially south of Mimico Avenue, and most notably, the tree-lined &#x27;crescent&#x27; streets (Lake Cres, Eastbourne Cres, Dartmouth Cres and Lake Shore) were developed with large cottage–style homes. In 1928 the local streetcar line merged with the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) which at first combined the line with Toronto&#x27;s &#x27;Queen&#x27; line.

Doubts about Mimico&#x27;s survival appeared during the Great Depression when the Town went deeply into debt and many businesses disappeared. The depression also bankrupted some of Toronto&#x27;s wealthiest including Sir Henry Pellatt (builder of Casa Loma) who had already built a house in Mimico (Bailey House) which stood at the bend in Lake Shore near Fleeceline overlooking the commercial stretch on Lake Shore. Smaller industries moved into areas around the railway tracks.

Just before the outbreak of World War II, Canada&#x27;s first &#x27;Limited Access&#x27; Highway, the Queen Elizabeth Way, was opened by Queen Elizabeth just north of the Town of Mimico&#x27;s northern boundary.

Mimico&#x27;s longest-serving mayor (at different periods from 1936 to 1948) was Amos Waites, who alternated in this post with Mayor Archibald Norris. About the time of the Second World War many 1-storey houses were built, filling in most of the gaps in the housing especially in northern and western Mimico. Many new immigrants came to Mimico in the 1950s. In 1953, Mimico became one of thirteen cities and towns which formed the new Metropolitan Toronto. The next year Hurricane Hazel struck and while communities around Mimico were some of the worst affected, the storm left Mimico largely untouched. The Town of Mimico saw its future in attracting many more small families and working people to the area and began to tear down older homes that stood on large lots and filled in these and the last remaining empty lots with apartment buildings.

Smaller 3-storey apartment buildings went up on almost every street while larger apartments appeared along much of the Lake Shore on the east side. More commercial space was also built especially on the northern side of Lake Shore Road from Mimico Ave. to Burlington St. A period of church expansion occurred with Christ Church Anglican and St. Leo&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church building new Churches at this time for larger congregations. St. Leo&#x27;s new church was built on the site of Mimico&#x27;s 1858 Post Office which was demolished and shortly after the postmaster&#x27;s home (Werden House) was purchased to become the new rectory. In 1958, the Presbyterian Church built a new church building beside the old church. A legion hall was established in Mimico in Sir Henry Pellatt&#x27;s former Bailey House.

===Merger with Etobicoke (1967–1998)===
In 1967, the Town of Mimico was merged with two other lake shore communities (the Town of New Toronto and the Village of Long Branch) and the Township of Etobicoke to form the Borough of Etobicoke. The Last Mayor of Mimico, who was first elected in 1960, was Hugh Griggs who edited Mimico&#x27;s official history &#x27;The Mimico Story&#x27;. While Canada celebrated its Centenary, the new Mimico Centennial Library was opened. Mimico had torn down the Carnegie Library (the only of Toronto&#x27;s Carnegie Libraries to be demolished) and two adjacent houses to build the larger Mimico Centennial Library, which was set back from the corner location of the previous library building. The plaque honouring the towns First World War veterans was removed to a new park named &#x27;Vimy Memorial&#x27; at Lake Shore Blvd. West and Queens Ave.
The legion hall that had been in Sir Henry Pellatt&#x27;s Bailey house was moved to Eden Court, the former farm residence of the Stock family, when Bailey house was demolished for a street to serve new industries east of Mimico. Bailey House&#x27;s time as the Legion hall is commemorated in the name of the street it was demolished for: Legion Road.

Mimico began slowly to decline as the children of families who lived in the small houses of the 1940s moved to the growing outer suburbs and the apartments did not live up to the hopes they had generated as they quickly deteriorated. Businesses also continued to fail and many of the small industries moved out. In 1984, Etobicoke became a city and a plan was prepared to rejuvenate Mimico which called for limiting the amount of commercial space by rezoning Mimico Avenue as non-commercial. The same year, Humber Bay Park was opened, consisting of two artificial peninsulas on either side of the mouth of Mimico Creek, with one on the east side and one on the west side (enclosing Mimico&#x27;s beach to create a harbour) which connect to the main land at the end of Mimico Creek. The creation of the artificial park led to unintended consequences with some of the sandy shoreline in Mimico eroding away.

With declining enrollment at Mimico High School, the building was offered to the Catholic board as the number of Catholics had been increasing with many Italian and Polish immigrants arriving in Mimico. This offer was refused and an Adult Learning Centre was opened there instead. The Centre has since swapped buildings with John English Elementary School. An estate on Lake Shore Boulevard was bought by the Polish government at this time to become their Toronto Consulate. A new railway station was built in the 1970s to service GO trains on the site of the 1855 station on the north side of the tracks just south of Christ Church on Royal York while the old 1916 station fell into disrepair.

===Post-amalgamation (1998–present)===

In 1998, Etobicoke was amalgamated with Metro Toronto and its five other municipalities into the new City of Toronto. Much of the former industrial land was subdivided for &#x27;Monster Homes&#x27; in the 1980s and later for townhouses, a process that continues today. Old plans for rejuvenating Mimico and its waterfront are also slowly being realized. The strip along Lake Shore Boulevard east of Park Lawn, formerly a strip of motels, became an area of numerous condominium apartment buildings. Condominium apartment buildings are also being built within the historic area of Mimico.

Mimico&#x27;s oldest church, Christ Church Anglican experienced two fires within a short period of time and the remains were demolished leaving the old cemetery and a new park where the church once stood. The possibility of Mimico &#x27;gentrifying&#x27; is sometimes mentioned in plans for Mimico but this has only taken place on a very small scale. Greater attempts at preserving Mimico&#x27;s history are also being made with the historical designation of Eden Court (former home of Edward Stock) and the preservation and ongoing restoration of Mimico&#x27;s old railway station.

Efforts have also been made recently to prevent the demolition of the Town of Mimico&#x27;s last municipal building (Firehall at #13 Superior Ave. - now demolished for a condominium) and the Franceshini/Ormsby Estate (Amedeo Garden Court property).

==Education==

Two public school boards operate elementary schools in the neighbourhood, the secular Toronto District School Board (TDSB), and the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board. In addition to elementary schools, TDSB also operates the Mimico Adult Learning Centre, situated on Royal York Road.

TDSB operates two elementary schools in the area. George R. Gauld Junior School is a located on Melrose Street, occupying the building formerly used by Mimico High School (a TDSB secondary school closed in 1988). With increased immigration of working families to the Town of Mimico&#x27;s northern half, it was felt that a new elementary school was needed to compliment John English Junior Middle School. In 1923, George R. Gauld Public School was opened, named after a former trustee and superintendent of the nearby Victoria Industrial School (later moved to Guelph, the remains of the older institution becoming the Mimico Correctional Centre). The school has had two additions, one in 1932 and another in 1959.

David Hornell Junior School is a TDSB elementary school built in 1961, and is located on Victoria Street. The street is named after Mimico resident and World War II Victoria Cross recipient, Flight Lieutenant David Ernest Hornell. Hornell was awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously for service during the Second World War serving in RCAF No. 162 Squadron. On June 24, 1944, Lieutenant Hornell&#x27;s Consolidated Canso was damaged by gunfire while attacking (and successfully sinking) &quot;U-1225&quot; off the Faroe Islands. Hornell successfully landed the crippled and burning flying boat in heavy seas, but died of exposure. An outdoor plaque and a display of memorabilia in the front hall are dedicated to Hornell and the school honours his memory annually on Remembrance Day. The school serves a diverse population of students. For many of them, David Hornell School is their first link with Canadian culture. A large number of the students speak another language at home while they acquire English skills at school.

TCDSB operates two public elementary schools in the area, St. Leo Catholic Elementary School on Stanley Avenue, and St. Louis Catholic Elementary School on Morgan Avenue.

St. Leo Catholic School is a Toronto Catholic District School Board elementary school opened in 1926 on Pidgeon (now Stanley) Avenue, in the parish of St. Leo&#x27;s (the oldest Catholic Church in Etobicoke), with the school being the oldest existing Catholic School in Etobicoke; the older Highfield Catholic School on Etobicoke&#x27;s border with Brampton having closed many years before St. Leo opened. For lack of funds, the original school building (still standing) was a copy of the older St. Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Elementary School (demolished for Malton, now Pearson, airport) in what is now Brampton; technically, St. Patrick&#x27;s was the &#x27;mother&#x27; parish of St. Leo&#x27;s although early Catholics in Mimico preferred to attend church and school in Toronto or the local Etobicoke public school (now renamed the John English Junior Middle School). With the establishment of St. Leo elementary school, a Mimico Catholic School Board was also established for the one catholic school in Mimico. Originally, St. Leo was served by the Sisters of St. Joseph who commuted, first from Toronto, later from their Etobicoke residence in Our Lady of Sorrows Parish (beside the early St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Secondary School for Girls, Islington). The school grew in the interwar years despite the creation of new &#x27;daughter&#x27; parishes and schools in New Toronto (St. Teresa&#x27;s), Humber (St Mark&#x27;s) and later, the Queensway (Holy Angels). The school sits on land donated by parishioners of St. Leo&#x27;s parish who used the school for many events until the building of a parish hall in the 1960s, and was operated by taxes raised from Mimico Catholics by the Mimico School Board until it joined the Metropolitan Catholic School Board (now the Toronto Catholic District School Board) in 1967 when the Town of Mimico ceased to exist and the Sisters of St. Joseph were replaced by lay staff. One of the most celebrated former alumni of the school, hockey player and executive Brendan Shanahan, has maintained a connection with his home town and school. The school has celebrated its 50th and 75th anniversaries while the local parish is celebrating its 100th.

==Recreation==
Recreational facilities in Mimico include the Mimico Tennis Club, the Mimico Cruising Club, the Etobicoke Yacht Club, and the Humber Bay Sailing Centre, Mimico Waterfront Park, and Coronation Park.

Near the foot of Park Lawn Road is Humber Bay Park, land created by infill of the lake, creating an artificial peninsula and enclosing Mimico Harbour at Mimico Creek. It has a few picnic areas, boat slips, walking trails and grasslands for recreational use.

In 1890, a waterfront walkway was planned consisting of The Parade at the bottom of Superior Avenue and Marine Parade starting at the bottom of Royal York Road. This plan had disappeared by 1911 except for a small part of Marine Parade (Sussex Drive). The City of Toronto, along with the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, is building a publicly accessible waterfront. The first phase of the Mimico Linear Park, opened in July 2008, connects three small parks using cobblestone beaches, boardwalks and sand dunes, and will eventually connect with Humber Bay Park to the east. As of 2008, construction of the second phase was delayed due to a minority group of property owners who refused to sell their lakefront access. This project has been completed through the Humber Bay neighbourhood with a roadway named Marine Parade Drive after the original one in Mimico.

Mimico has had a long reputation for supporting both of Canada&#x27;s national sports. In hockey, Mimico has developed a number of NHL players; there was even a Wayne and Shuster sketch where Johnny and Frank played for the mythical &quot;Mimico Mice&quot; against the then-Stanley Cup champion Toronto Maple Leafs.

Mimico Lacrosse has been in existence since 1890 and have won a number of National Championships. Lacrosse was originally played in an outdoor box at the corner of Church Street (Royal York) and Drummond Street, where the game has been played continuously until today. It was known across the country as the &quot;Drummond Street Bowl&quot; which included a dirt floor, and old railway boxcars for dressing rooms. The Mimico Mountaineers brought recognition to the town more than any other sports team with Mann Cup wins in 1932 and 1942. Minto Cup victories were recorded in 1938 and 1951.

==Transportation==

The area is served primarily with buses along Royal York Road and Evans Avenue connecting with the Bloor-Danforth subway and with streetcars along Lake Shore Boulevard. The City of Toronto is in the process of studying various proposals to increase transit connections in the area to downtown. The Mimico GO Transit station provides regular east-west commuter rail travel to downtown Toronto and to as far west as Hamilton. Along the north of the area is the Gardiner Expressway, a large twelve-lane highway (originally built as the Queen Elizabeth Way).

Before the building of the Bloor-Danforth Subway, the TTC operated a &#x27;Mimico&#x27; bus route along a portion of Royal York and the Queensway from Humber Loop to the foot of Royal York. A second route was the 507 Long Branch streetcar, which was joined in 1995 to the 501 Queen route (the longest streetcar route in the world), and therefore no longer turns at the Humber Loop. Because of poor service on the western section of the route, the TTC is considering reinstating the separate Long Branch route.

===Main streets===
Lake Shore Boulevard is a four-lane arterial that runs parallel to the Lake Ontario waterfront from east to west, and is primarily residential within the Mimico area. The major north-south route is Royal York Road.

The original naming convention for Mimico side-streets was for English community names: Buckingham, Windsor (now Blue Goose Street), Newcastle, Portland, Burlington, Manchester, Oxford, Dorchester (now in The Queensway), Southampton (Cavell), Salisbury Ave. (Park Lawn Rd.), Torrington (Grand Ave.), Cambridge (to the North became Mendota), Coventry (to the East became Queens Ave.).

Some later streets were named for Mimico settlers: O&#x27;Donnell, Van Every, Robert Hendry (Wheatfield), George (Hendry), Pidgeon (western part of Stanley), Howland (Ourland), Stock&#x27;s Side Road (Queen St., later The Queensway); and more recently for former mayors of Mimico: Skelton, Norris. The Griggs and Edwards retirement homes are also named for former mayors.

<doc id="643749" wikidata="Q1048674" url="?curid=643749" title="Chestnut-tailed starling">
<text>The chestnut-tailed starling (Sturnia malabarica), also called grey-headed starling and grey-headed myna is a member of the starling family. It is a resident or partially migratory species found in wooded habitats in India and Southeast Asia. The species name is after the distribution of a former subspecies in the Malabar region. While the chestnut-tailed starling is a winter visitor to peninsular India, the closely related resident breeding population with a white head is now treated as a full species, the Malabar starling (&quot;Sturnia blythii&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
The chestnut-tailed starling was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the thrushes in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Turdus malabaricus&quot;. Gmelin based his account on the &quot;Le Martin Vieillard de la côte de Malabar&quot; that had been described in 1782 by the French naturalist Pierre Sonnerat in his book &quot;Voyage aux Indes orientales et à la Chine&quot;.

The chestnut-tailed starling was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Sturnus&quot;. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2008 found that the genus was polyphyletic. In the reoganization to create monotypic genera, the chestnut-tailed starling was one of five starlings moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Sturnia&quot; that had been introduced in 1837 by René Lesson.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;S. m. malabarica&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – India (except southwest, northeast), south Nepal and Bangladesh
* &quot;S. m. nemoricola&quot; Jerdon, 1862 – south Assam (northeast India) and Myanmar to north, central Indochina

Both the nominate subspecies and &quot;nemoricola&quot; are known to perform some poorly understood movements (e.g., &quot;S. m. malabarica&quot; has been recorded from Pakistan and in central and southern India).

The taxon &quot;blythii&quot; is now usually (e.g. Rasmussen &amp; Anderton, 2005) considered a valid species, the Malabar starling or white-headed myna (&quot;Sturnia blythii&quot;), instead of a subspecies of &quot;Sturnia malabarica&quot;. As &quot;S. m. malabarica&quot; only visits the range of &quot;blythii&quot; during the non-breeding period (winter), the two are not known to interbreed. However, a molecular study found the genetic divergence between &quot;S. blythii&quot; not significantly greater (between 0.2% and 0.8%) than between the sisters &quot;S. m. malabarica&quot; of northern India and &quot;S. m. nemoricola&quot; of Burma and Vietnam.

==Description==
The adults have a total length of approximately . They have grey upperparts and blackish remiges, but the colour of the remaining plumage depends on the subspecies. In the nominate subspecies and &quot;blythii&quot;, the underparts (incl. undertail) are rufous, but in &quot;nemoricola&quot; the underparts are whitish tinged rufous, especially on the flanks and crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca). The nominate and &quot;nemoricola&quot; have a light grey head with whitish streaking (especially on crown and collar region). Both subspecies have white irises and a yellow bill with a pale blue base. The sexes are similar, but juveniles have whitish underparts and just chestnut tips to the tail feathers.

==Behaviour==
The chestnut-tailed starling&#x27;s nest is typically found in open woodland and cultivation, and it builds a nest in an old barbet or woodpecker hole in a tree-trunk, up. The normal clutch is 3-5 eggs, pale blue, unmarked. The nesting season is usually March to June.

Like most starlings, it is fairly omnivorous, eating fruit, nectar and insects. They fly in tight flocks and often rapidly change directions with great synchrony.

<text>Paul Glee Waner (April 16, 1903 – August 29, 1965), nicknamed &quot;Big Poison&quot;, was an American professional baseball right fielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for four teams between 1926 and 1945, most notably playing his first 15 seasons with the Pittsburgh Pirates. The greatest Pirate outfielder up to his retirement, he won the 1927 NL Most Valuable Player Award in his second season, collecting a team-record 237 hits that year. Waner set the team record for doubles in a season three times, including 1932 when he set the NL record for doubles in a season with 62. In the only postseason appearance of his career, he hit .333 in the Pirates&#x27; 1927 World Series loss against the New York Yankees. Waner won three National League (NL) batting titles, led the NL in hits twice, and collected over 200 hits eight times including four consecutive seasons from 1927 to 1930.

On June 19, 1942, Waner became the seventh member of the 3,000 hit club, with a single off Rip Sewell. He led the NL in putouts four times and holds the career record for most putouts by a right fielder. Waner&#x27;s 191 triples are 10th all-time, and his 605 doubles are 14th all-time. A career .333 hitter, he was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1952. When Waner&#x27;s younger brother Lloyd was elected to the Hall of Fame, they became the second pair of brothers in the National Baseball Hall of Fame, after Harry and George Wright. Paul and Lloyd also hold the record for the most hits recorded by brothers (5,611). On July 21, 2007, Waner&#x27;s No. 11 was retired by the Pittsburgh Pirates.

==Early life==
Waner was born in Harrah in the Oklahoma Territory, four years before the region became a state. He was the third child of five of Ora and Etta Waner. His younger brother Lloyd Waner is also a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame; Ora had once been offered a contract by the Chicago White Stockings but declined it, instead settling on a 400-acre farm. Waner was born with the middle name of John but his middle name was changed from John to Glee after an uncle named Glee gave him a shotgun at the age of 6. He stated that he learned batting from hitting corncobs on his father&#x27;s farm, learning the way to follow the ball by seeing the movement of the cobs. Waner had astigmatism; he did not like wearing glasses on the field as it made the ball appear smaller and in focus, but without glasses, the ball looked grapefruit-sized. With the larger apparent size of the baseball, he was able to hit the center more often.

Waner played baseball at East Central State Teachers College (now known as East Central University) in Ada, Oklahoma; he pitched to a 23–4 record with a 1.70 earned run average in 1922. Waner&#x27;s father had wanted him to be a teacher, but Waner wanted to play pro baseball and dropped out of college as a result. He signed with the team in Joplin, Missouri in the Class A Western League. Then, Waner was sent to the Southwestern League (equivalent to Rookie League) in Muskogee before being sold again to the Class AA San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League in 1923, the manager of which was former Pirate, John &quot;Dots&quot; Miller. He only pitched one game for the Seals, in 1924 before he was moved to the outfield. With the Seals, Waner hit .378 over his three seasons, including .401 in their 1925 championship season.

==Major League Baseball career==
===Pittsburgh Pirates===
In October 1925, the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League purchased Waner and teammate Hal Rhyne from the Seals for $100,000. On April 17, 1926, against the Cincinnati Reds, he collected his first major league hit. On August 26, Waner collected six hits in six at-bats during a game against the Giants, and he accomplished this feat using six different bats from six different players. He ended his first season with a .336 batting average and led the NL in triples with 22. He also finished 12th in MVP voting as the Pirates finished in third place, 4.5 games behind the St. Louis Cardinals. By Waner&#x27;s second season with the Pirates he and his younger brother Lloyd had become stars; combined, they accumulated 460 hits in the 1927 season. The 1927 season was a standout year for Paul. He played in a career-high 155 games (which led the league), and led the NL in hits (237), a team record, triples (18), batting average (.380) and RBIs (131). He set the major league record for consecutive games with an extra-base hit, with 14 (June 3–19, 1927); Since then this feat has also been accomplished by Chipper Jones in 2006. Aided by the contributions of the Waner brothers, Pittsburgh advanced to the 1927 World Series. In the only postseason appearance of his career, Paul went 5-for-15 with 3 RBIs and a .333 batting average, but the Pirates were swept by the New York Yankees. In recognition for his performance during the 1927 season, the National League awarded him the NL Most Valuable Player Award.
Waner hit .370 and led the NL in runs scored (142, a career high) and doubles (50) in 1928. His 223 hits in 1928 were tied (with his younger brother Lloyd) for second most in team history. He set a career high with 15 home runs in 1929. He also collected at least 200 hits for the third season in a row and hit .336 with 43 doubles and 100 RBIs for the second place Pirates. Playing in only 145 games (the fewest since his rookie year) during the 1930 season, he still recorded 217 hits with a .368 batting average and 117 runs. By his measure, 1931 was a disappointing year for Waner, who was injured and missed time during spring training. Nonetheless, he still hit .322 with 180 hits in 150 games. The Pirates finished below .500, with a 75–79 record, for the first time in Paul&#x27;s career.

Coming off a down year, Waner hit .341 in 1932 with 215 hits (his fifth season with over 200 hits). He played in all 154 games, and set the National League record for doubles in a season with 62. During a game on May 12, Waner hit four doubles, which tied a major league record for doubles hit in a game. In 1933, he hit for a career low .309, the first time his average dipped below .320, and recorded 191 hits. The 1933 season was also the first year that Major League Baseball hosted the inaugural MLB All-Star Game, for which Waner was selected as a reserve outfielder. The Pirates finished second in the NL in both 1932 and 1933, first four games behind the Chicago Cubs and then five games behind the New York Giants.

Waner won his second NL batting title in 1934, hitting .362 and leading the league in hits (217), his sixth time collecting 200 or more hits, and runs (122). He finished second in MVP voting and was selected to his second MLB All-Star Game. In 1935, it was suggested by manager Pie Traynor that Waner give up hard liquor and switch to beer, and this resulted in Waner only hitting .242 on May 18. Traynor and Waner went to a bar before playing the Giants on May 19, and when Waner ordered a beer Traynor said, &quot;He will like Hell. Give him a shot of whiskey.&quot; Waner hit .331 in the remaining games to finish the season with a batting average of .321, with 78 RBIs and 176 hits in 139 games. In 1935, he was selected to his third MLB All-Star Game. In 1936, Waner won his third NL batting title with a batting average of .373, the second highest of his career, while collecting 94 RBIs (his third highest in his career), 53 doubles (second highest), and 218 hits. He collected over 200 hits for the final time in 1937, when he had a .354 batting average, while driving in 74. The 1937 season was the eighth time he collected 200 or more hits in a season; at the time, only Hall of Famer Ty Cobb had more 200 hit seasons (nine). It was also his fourth and final MLB All-Star Game selection.

Famous for his ability to hit while hung over, when Waner gave up drinking in 1938 at management&#x27;s request, he hit only .280—the first of only two times that he failed to hit .300 as a Pirate. That year, he had 69 RBIs, 31 doubles and 175 hits in 148 games. As Casey Stengel said in complimenting his base-running skills, &quot;He had to be a very graceful player, because he could slide without breaking the bottle on his hip.&quot; Waner bounced back to a .328 average in 1939, with 45 RBIs and 151 hits in 125 games; this was the last season he collected over 100 hits. He had 1,959 of his 3,152 career hits in the 1930s, with five seasons during the decade with over 200 hits. During that decade, he garnered votes for MVP five times, finishing fourth in 1932, second in 1934, 24th in 1935, fifth in 1936, and eighth in 1937. The 1940 season was Waner&#x27;s last as a Pirate. He hit .290 while having 32 RBIs and 69 hits in 89 games, having pulled the ligaments in his right knee after stepping awkwardly on a base, missing three weeks along with playing time after healing up. Waner was released on December 5, 1940. In his 15-year career with the Pirates, he had 2,868 hits, 1,177 RBIs, 558 doubles, 187 triples, and a .340 batting average in 2,154 games. The Pirates only finished with a losing record three times while Waner was on the team, and finished as one of the top three teams in the NL a total of seven times from 1926 to 1940.

===Later career===

On January 31, 1941, Waner was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers and would patrol the outfield with Hall of Famer Joe Medwick. After an impressive spring training he was offered the starting right field spot. After 11 games he was released by the Dodgers after only hitting .171 with 6 hits. He was signed by the Boston Braves two weeks later, and he hit for .267, collected 50 RBIs, and had 88 hits in 106 combined games during the season. He spent the next season with the team, recording a .258 average, 39 RBIs and 86 hits in 114 games. Waner got his 3,000th hit off old Pirate teammate Rip Sewell on June 19, 1942, becoming the seventh hitter (after Ty Cobb, Tris Speaker, Honus Wagner, Eddie Collins, Nap Lajoie, and Cap Anson) to do so. He was released by Boston on January 19, 1943. Two days later, the Dodgers signed him again. A spike injury to his foot meant that he missed time once again, but he still hit for .311 in 82 games while having 36 RBIs and 70 hits, a career low for a whole season played. The 1944 season was his last full season. He played 92 total games, 83 with the Dodgers and nine with the Yankees after being released by the former on September 1, batting .280 with 17 RBIs and 40 hits. He played one game for the Yankees in 1945, making one plate appearance as a pinch hitter in which he drew a walk.

==Later life and legacy==
Waner led the National League in batting on three occasions and accumulated over 3,000 hits during his 20-year baseball career. He hit 605 doubles, which at the time of his retirement was fifth-most all-time. He collected 200 or more hits on eight occasions, collected 50 or more doubles in three seasons, was voted the NL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player in 1927, and had a lifetime batting average of .333, tied for fifth highest (with Eddie Collins) for anyone in the 3,000 hit club. His 191 triples are 10th most all time. Waner recorded one six-hit game, 5 five-hit games, and 55 four-hit games in his career. Stengel once stated that Waner was the best right fielder in National League history. Russo said, &quot;Paul was a speedy outfielder who possessed perhaps the strongest arm in a Pittsburgh outfield until the arrival of Roberto Clemente.&quot; At the plate, Waner had a reputation for being fearless. He said, &quot;I never let them [pitchers] get the better of me. If you flinch and show any fear, you&#x27;re done.&quot;

Waner (3,152) and his younger brother, Lloyd (2,459), hold the career record for hits by brothers (5,611), outpacing the three Alou brothers (5,094): Felipe (2,101), Matty (1,777) and Jesús (1,216), and the three DiMaggio brothers (4,853): Joe (2,214), Dom (1,680) and Vince (959), among others. For most of the period from 1927 to 1940, Paul patrolled right field at Forbes Field while Lloyd covered the ground next to him in center field. On September 15, 1938, the brothers hit back-to-back home runs against Cliff Melton of the New York Giants. The origin of the nicknames &quot;Big Poison&quot; and &quot;Little Poison&quot; that were given to Paul and his younger brother Lloyd, respectively, is from a game at the Polo Grounds during the 1927 season when a fan pronounced &quot;person&quot; as &quot;poison&quot; as he called out to the brothers.

After his retirement, he kept active by fishing, hunting, golfing and being a part-time hitting coach for the Phillies, Cardinals, and Braves. Ted Williams credited Waner with advising him to move away from the plate to successfully combat the &quot;Williams&quot; shift. However, Russo noted that &quot;Like Babe Ruth, [Waner&#x27;s] distaste for discipline made him an inappropriate candidate for managing.&quot; A proficient golfer, Waner could shoot in the 70&#x27;s. He was one of the people instrumental in starting the National Baseball Players Golf Tournament. In his spare time, he enjoyed reading Seneca, and he once authored a comedy skit that he and Heinie Manush acted in.

Waner was named to the National Baseball Hall of Fame on July 21, 1952. &quot;Gee. It&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time, but I had almost given up hope of making it,&quot; he said. &quot;In fact, I guess you can say I&#x27;ve achieved my life&#x27;s ambition. Any baseball player&#x27;s ambition.&quot; With the induction of his brother Lloyd in 1967, they became the second brother combination to be inducted into the Hall of Fame (with Harry and George Wright being the other). Waner was interviewed for the 1966 book &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;. He died on August 29, 1965, in Sarasota, Florida after a respiratory arrest from emphysema complicated by pneumonia at the age of 62.

In 1999, he was ranked number 62 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Separate efforts by the Waner family and two longtime Pirates fans, who repeatedly petitioned Pirates then-owner Kevin McClatchy to honor Waner by retiring his uniform number, were eventually successful. The Pirates retired Waner&#x27;s No. 11 in a ceremony before their game vs. the Astros on July 21, 2007, 55 years to the day of his induction into the Hall of Fame. A plaque was placed in the interior of PNC Park to commemorate the retiring of Waner&#x27;s jersey.
