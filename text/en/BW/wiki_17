<text>Hits Radio is a network of 26 contemporary hit radio stations in the United Kingdom, owned and operated by Bauer Media Audio UK.

As of December 2024, the network has a combined reach of 7.1 million weekly listeners according to RAJAR.

==Overview==
Hits Radio UK broadcasts on DAB in many parts of the UK and online. 25 localised variants air on FM and DAB across England and Wales.

As of May 2024, there are a total of 25 local radio stations in the network providing local programming, news, traffic and sport, along with networked output from Hits Radio UK.

The FM network of stations was formerly known as the Big City Network, Bauer Place and Bauer City 1. The national DAB station was formerly known as The Hits.

Until 17 April 2024, most of the stations broadcast under their local identities, such as Clyde 1 in Glasgow and Radio City in Liverpool. After this date, only the Scottish stations retained their heritage branding, with English and Welsh stations becoming localised outputs of Hits Radio.

==History==
===The Hits Radio ===
On 19 January 2015, The Hits formed the backbone of a new locally branded Bauer City 3 network of radio stations in Northern England and Scotland. The local City 3 branding was dropped on 31 August 2017, in favour of adding The Hits to all local DAB Multiplexes.

===FM stations networking===
Initially known as the Big City Network, and latterly Bauer Place and Bauer City 1, networked programming on Bauer&#x27;s local FM stations in Northern England and Scotland was initially confined to off-peak night time and weekend timeslots.

===Hits Radio rebrand===
On 18 April 2018, station owners Bauer announced Key 103 in Manchester would be rebranded and relaunched as Hits Radio Manchester a CHR-led music station aimed at 25-44 year olds on Monday 4 June 2018.

The station was merged with national DAB station The Hits, which in turn was rebranded itself as Hits Radio UK to provide a single national service across the UK on DAB, Freeview and online.

In Manchester, Hits Radio continues to provide local news &amp; information, traffic bulletins and advertising on its local platforms - 103 FM, DAB and online. The station&#x27;s programming is networked across 24 local FM stations - all of which opt out at times for local output.
In February 2014, the stations adopted a standardised audio identity package, produced by Wisebuddah, while retaining their local station branding. Two networked shows were also introduced across most stations - &quot;Old Skool and Anthems&quot; and &quot;In: Demand&quot; - produced from Key 103 in Manchester.

Separate schedules for Northern England and Scotland were introduced in August 2015, followed in July 2017 by two networked mid-morning shows for most of the FM stations, produced from Manchester and Glasgow respectively.

Local weekend programming for most of the English stations was replaced with additional network output in July 2019, followed in September 2019 by the introduction of a networked Drivetime show. The Scottish network of stations introduced a networked Drivetime show at the end of March 2020, except for MFR and Radio Borders.

In February 2017, the Free Radio group of stations in the West Midlands began carrying off-peak programming from the Northern England network, replacing most of its own regional output from Birmingham.

Gem in the East Midlands joined the network in July 2019 to carry late night and overnight programming from Manchester.

Five stations were acquired to join the network, of which four retained heritage branding: Pulse 1 (Bradford), Signal 1 (Stoke-on-Trent), The Wave (Swansea) and Fire Radio (Bournemouth). Pulse, Signal, and The Wave began carrying off-peak programming from the Hits Radio network on 15 June 2020. The fifth, The Breeze (Portsmouth, Southampton and Winchester) rebranded as Hits Radio under a licensing agreement with Nation Broadcasting.

On 20 July 2020, Pulse 1, Signal 1 and The Wave officially joined the Hits Radio network.

On 31 August 2020, Radio Aire ceased broadcasting and moved to the sister Greatest Hits Radio network - it merged with twelve other stations to form Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire.

The same day saw Hits Radio South Coast launch, thereby becoming the second FM station to be known on air as Hits Radio. The station had previously broadcast as The Breeze South Coast and the change is made following the purchase in 2019 of The Breeze network from Celador Radio. Nation Broadcasting replaced Hits Radio South Coast with their own Easy Radio South Coast programming from 19 September 2022, with Bauer providing Hits Radio content thereafter on the South Hampshire DAB multiplex.

In October 2020, it was announced that Hits Radio would launch in Suffolk, taking over the DAB capacity which had been used for Greatest Hits Radio since September (previously Town 102), in tandem with the relaunch of Ipswich 102 as Greatest Hits Radio. The change took place on 3 November, at the point Ipswich 102 (and Radio Plymouth) took the GHR affiliation. As in North Yorkshire, a localised feed of Hits Radio is provided, with the ability to split from the network programming content for localised branding, news material and advertising. Hits Radio Suffolk was withdrawn after 1 October 2022, with the capacity reverting to GHR, as a consequence of the FM frequency (the prior Ipswich 102) transitioning to Nation Radio Suffolk.

In November 2021, Bauer announced the two Free Radio breakfast shows - known as &quot;Hits at Breakfast&quot; - would be merged into one regional show across all four Free Radio licences. The merger was permitted under OFCOM&#x27;s local content guidelines, although all four Free Radio licences retain opt-outs for local news, traffic updates and advertising.

In November 2022, it was announced that CFM in Cumbria would follow Radio Aire in transitioning from the Hits Radio network to Greatest Hits Radio, with the change slated to take place as of April 2023; CFM&#x27;s local weekday show would remain, moved from breakfast to broadcast in an afternoon slot on GHR, with Hits Radio content continuing to be available in the area over DAB - replacing the localised digital-only version of GHR broadcast to Cumbria since the local DAB multiplex began broadcasting in late 2021. Around the same time as announcing the CFM change, Bauer confirmed that two of the relay transmitters of Signal 1 would transfer to carrying GHR from January 2023, with the station&#x27;s main transmitter area - where GHR broadcasts on AM (formerly Signal 2) - retaining the Hits Network positioning.

In January 2023, Bauer announced that Radio Borders would follow CFM in transitioning from the Hits Radio network to Greatest Hits Radio, in April 2023.

In November 2023, Bauer announced that from January 2024, the two individual breakfast shows on both Radio City and Rock FM would come to an end and would be merged to form a simulcast show on both stations. The new show is presented by Joel Ross and Leanne Campbell and broadcast from Bauer&#x27;s Liverpool studios at the Hits Radio Tower. The stations continue their separate branding and news bulletins.

==== Heritage station rebrand ====
In January 2024, it was announced that fifteen of Bauer&#x27;s local radio stations in England and Wales - which form part of the Hits Radio network - would be rebranded as Hits Radio from 17 April 2024. No changes are expected to the network&#x27;s local, regional and national programming, including local news and traffic bulletins, as a result of the rebrand.

All fifteen stations were relaunched as local variants of Hits Radio on 17 April 2024.

On 8 August 2024, Bauer announced that Kiss would be replaced on FM in London, the Severn Estuary and Norwich by Hits Radio, with Kiss retaining its frequency in Bristol. In September 2024, it was confirmed Hits Radio would launch in Bristol, London, Norwich and Somerset &amp; South Wales on 23 September, and that the 97.2 FM frequency would join the other Kiss frequencies in flipping to Hits. Hits Radio would ultimately be launched at 10.00pm on 22 September 2024 across the West Of England on 97.2 MHz, 101.0 MHz &amp; 106.5 MHz, in London on 100.0 MHz and in Norfolk on 106.1 MHz. The first song that played on the former Kiss frequencies was Pink with &quot;Trustfall&quot; and Hattie Pearson was the presenter who launched the stations.

On 4 August 2024, Bauer announced that after 27 years of the West FM name, the station would be rebranded to &#x27;Clyde 1 Ayrshire&#x27; from 16 September 2024 and share all output with Clyde 1 whilst retaining local news, weather and travel bulletins.

On 25 October 2024, the regional mid-morning show in the West of England ended. Following this, on 1 November 2024, the regional mid-morning show in the South of England ended.

On 6 January 2025, Forth 1’s breakfast show expanded, replacing MFR, Northsound 1 and Tay FM’s separate local breakfast shows.

On 10 January 2025 it was announced Star Radio had been acquired by Bauer. Local output will end, with the station becoming a relay of Hits Radio.

==Spin-off stations==
===Hits Radio Pride===

On 29 July 2020, Bauer announced a spinoff pop-up station to Hits Radio, Hits Radio Pride, which launched at 8am on 28 August 2020. The new station would be the first time a major radio broadcaster in the United Kingdom has launched a station that was targeted to the LGBTQ+ community. The service is taking capacity on a select number of Bauer owned ensembles including Northern Ireland, Liverpool, Swansea, Bradford, Stoke and London. Bauer acquired additional DAB capacity as part of the deal to buy Wireless Group&#x27;s local radio portfolio in 2019.

In Liverpool, Hits Radio Pride took capacity previously used by Radio City Talk. In Northern Ireland the service replaced Magic Chilled.

The station is sponsored by Cooperative Bank for an initial run of 6 months. Additional content is produced by Reform Radio, as part of a grant awarded by the Audio Content Fund. Tough Talks’; is an &#x27;intimate conversations between contributors from the LGBTQ+ community reflecting on the struggles that they face within society.&#x27;

Hits Radio Pride also works with LGBT+ helpline Switchboard (UK) to promote support services.

The station started online and smart speaker test transmissions on 21 August 2020. It consisted of a looped promo featuring tracks from MNEK, Kylie Minogue, Calvin Harris, Kim Petras, Years &amp; Years and Lady Gaga, along with promo trailers. The multiplex variation request submitted to Ofcom suggested the station would arrive on DAB multiplexes from 26 August 2020.

===Hits Radio Chilled===
On Monday 16 September 2024, at 7:00PM (UK) Hits Radio Chilled launched playing “laid back hits and throwbacks”. The first programme was hosted by the Irish singer-songwriter Cian Ducrot with his song ‘All for You‘ being the first song to be played on the station. News jingles had been playing for some weeks before. The station is a rebrand of Magic Chilled.

==Programming==

Most of the stations broadcast their own local breakfast shows from 6 to 10am each weekday - in most cases, these are produced and broadcast from the originating station&#x27;s studios. However many are grouped together. 

Network programming for England and Wales originates from Bauer&#x27;s London headquarters or studios in Birmingham, Manchester and Newcastle.

In Scotland, it originates from Bauer&#x27;s studios in Clydebank (near Glasgow) and Edinburgh.

Overnight programming and &quot;The Hits UK Chart&quot; on a Sunday airs across all Hits Radio stations in England, Wales and Scotland, originating from Bauer&#x27;s London headquarters. 

Until May 2022, CFM, Gem, MFR, Radio Borders and The Wave opted out of networked scheduling, during weekdays, and weekends respectively. This was replaced by networked programming.

As of 23 September 2024, Hits Radio in London, Norfolk and the West of England carry a revised version of the Hits Radio playlist, with some tracks replaced by remixed &#x27;dance&#x27; versions; this is likely to fulfil the requirement for &#x27;rhythmic&#x27; music on the former Kiss licences. Prior to September 2024 the local Bristol FM/DAB station and digital-only London service had followed the standard Hits playlist, which continues elsewhere.

<doc id="637228" wikidata="Q12060591" url="?curid=637228" title="Hulett">
<text>The Hulett was an ore unloader that was widely used on the Great Lakes of North America. It was unsuited to tidewater ports because it could not adjust for rising and falling tides, although one was used in New York City.

==History==
The Hulett was invented by George Hulett of Conneaut, Ohio, in the late 19th century; he received a patent for his invention in 1898. The first working machine was built the following year at Conneaut Harbor. 
It was steam powered, successful, and many more were built along the Great Lakes, especially the southern shore of Lake Erie to unload boats full of taconite from the iron mines near Lake Superior. John W. Ahlberg converted the Huletts in Conneaut to electricity in the 1920&#x27;s. Substantial improvements were later made on the design by Samuel T. Wellman.

The Hulett machine revolutionised iron ore shipment on the Great Lakes. Previous methods of unloading lake freighters, involving hoists and buckets and much hand labor, cost approximately 18¢/ton. Unloading with Huletts cost only 6¢/ton. (in 1901 dollars) Unloading only took 5 to 10 hours, as opposed to days for previous methods. Lake boat designs changed to accommodate the Hulett unloader, and became much larger, doubling in length and quadrupling in capacity.

By 1913, 54 Hulett machines were in service. Two were built at Lake Superior (unloading coal) and five at Gary, Indiana, but the vast majority were along the shores of Lake Erie. The additional unloading capacity they brought helped permit a greater than doubling of the ore traffic in the 1900–1912 period. A total of approximately 75 Huletts were built. One was installed in New York City to unload garbage.

The lake&#x27;s Huletts were used until about 1992, when self-unloading boats were standard on the American side of the lake. All have since been dismantled. In 1999, only six remained, the group of four at Whiskey Island in Cleveland, the oldest. Another set was used unloading barges of coal in South Chicago until 2002 and were demolished in the spring of 2010.

In spite of the Cleveland machines being on the National Register of Historic Places and designated as a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark, they were demolished in 2000 by the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority to enable development of the underlying land. The Port Authority disassembled and retained two Huletts, to enable their reconstruction at another site, but the reconstruction never started. In March 2024 the Port Authority initially chose a demolition contractor that intended to reassemble one unloader in nearby Canton, but they chose another contractor later in the month, which expects to salvage the arms and buckets. The last two remaining Huletts were scrapped in June 2024.

==Operation==

The electrically powered Hulett unloader rode on two parallel tracks along the docks, one near the edge and one further back, ordinarily with four railroad tracks in between. Steel towers, riding on wheeled trucks, supported girders that spanned the railroad tracks.

Along these girders ran a carriage which could move toward or away from the dock face. This in turn carried a large walking beam which could be raised or lowered; at the dock end of this was a vertical column with a large scoop bucket on the end. A parallel beam was mounted halfway down this column to keep the column vertical as it was raised or lowered. The machine&#x27;s operator, stationed in the vertical beam above the bucket for maximum cargo visibility, could spin the beam at any angle. The scoop bucket was lowered into the ship&#x27;s hold, closed to capture a quantity (10 tons approx.) of ore, raised, and moved back toward the dock. The workmen who operated the Hulett uploaders were known as Ore Hogs. 

To reduce the required motion of the carriage, a moving receiving hopper ran between the main girders. It was moved to the front for the main bucket to discharge its load, and then moved back to dump it into a waiting railroad car, or out onto a cantilever frame at the back to dump the load onto a stockpile.

The Hulett could move along the dock to align with the holds on an ore boat. When the hold was almost empty, the Hulett could not finish the job itself. Workmen entered the hold and shoveled the remaining ore into the Hulett&#x27;s bucket. In a later development, a wheeled excavator was chained to the Hulett&#x27;s bucket and lowered into the hold to fill the Hulett.

<doc id="637236" wikidata="Q1420196" url="?curid=637236" title="Fish River Canyon">
<text>The Fish River Canyon (Afrikaans: &quot;Visrivier Canyon&quot; or&quot; Visrivier Kuil&quot;, ), is located in the south of Namibia. It is the largest canyon in Africa, as well as the second most visited tourist attraction in Namibia. It features a gigantic ravine, in total about long, up to 27 km wide and in places almost 550 meters deep.

The Fish River is the longest interior river in Namibia. It cuts deep into the plateau which today is dry, stony and sparsely covered with hardy drought-resistant plants. The river flows intermittently, usually flooding in late summer; the rest of the year it becomes a chain of long narrow pools. The hot springs resort of ǀAi-ǀAis is situated at the lower end of the Fish River Canyon.

Public view points can be visited near Hobas, a camp site 70 km north of ǀAi-ǀAis. This part of the canyon is part of the ǀAi-ǀAis/Richtersveld Transfrontier Park, while the remainder is privately owned.

==Geology==
The Fish River canyon consists of an upper canyon, where river erosion was inhibited by hard gneiss bedrocks, and a lower canyon formed after erosion had finally worn through the solid metamorphic rocks. Both parts have been declared a national monument in 1962.

Upstream, the river runs through horizontal dolomite strata; these metamorphic rocks form part of the canyon. About 650 million years ago (Mya), plate movement had formed a north-south graben, or lowered area, along which the ancient Fish River could flow and eventually erode a flat plain to create today&#x27;s upper canyon. Glaciation at around 300 Mya, part of the Dyka glaciation during the Karoo Ice Age, further deepened the canyon. About 60 Mya, South America and Africa separated (due to continental drift) and Africa rose significantly; the consequentially increased gradient of the Fish River enabled it to erode the lower canyon into the hard gneisses, forming the current deeply twisting, meandering system of the lower canyon. With the separation of the continent Gondwana about 120 million years ago and the uplifting of the African continent the gradient of the Fish River increased - allowing it to erode even deeper into the rock. Today the deepest point of the canyon is 549 metres deep.

== The Fish River Canyon Hiking Trail ==
The Fish River Canyon hiking trail is one of the more popular hiking trails in Southern Africa. The immense scale and rugged terrain has drawn many visitors from all over the world to experience hiking or trail running the canyon.

Apart from the 2 kilometre descent west of Hobas and some optional short cuts, the trail generally follows 88 kilometres of the Fish River through to ǀAi-ǀAis and is usually completed within 5 days. Although there are a number of footpaths through the canyon, the trail is not fixed - leaving the hiker to decide where and how long to hike.

There are no amenities on the trail and hikers have to carry all their needs with them. Open fires are not allowed on the trail.

In times of inclement weather, some shelter in a run-down building can be found at the Causeway () but otherwise sleeping is outdoors.

The weather is usually mild and typical temperatures vary between 5 °C and 30 °C with little humidity. Extreme weather, such as flash floods, stormy winds and rain occasionally play havoc during the hiking season.

===Permits===

Due to flooding and extremely hot summer temperatures reaching 48 °C during the day and 30 °C at night, permits are only issued between 1 May and 15 September.

Prior to arriving at Hobas a hiking permit must be obtained from Namibia Wildlife Resorts for groups not smaller than 3 and not larger than 30. All hikers must be older than 12 years and a certificate of fitness, completed by a medical doctor, must be presented at the offices of the Ministry of Environment and Tourism at Hobas.

In recent years the trail has become popular, particularly during school holidays and long weekends; therefore permits should be requested well in advance. Bookings for the following year&#x27;s season open 1 May.

===Trailhead campgrounds===
Hobas () houses the Ministry of Environment and Tourism offices as well as Namibia Wildlife Resorts offices and a little shop for curiosities and basic necessities. Camping underneath Camelthorn trees with ablution blocks is available for hikers who plan to overnight at Hobas.

The trail ends at ǀAi-ǀAis where a resort with hotel rooms, chalets and camping grounds can be found.

A shuttle service runs approximately every three hours between ǀAi-ǀAis and Hobas. It should be booked in advance through the offices of Namibia Wildlife Resorts at ǀAi-ǀAis.

===The trail===

The trail starts from the car park () 13 kilometres west from Hobas. The descent is steep and chains are provided to assist hikers over the first 100 meters. Thereafter the unmarked path follows a gravel trail to the river floor at the bottom ().
On the descent some misleading game trails lead to the north and should be avoided.

The trail can be divided into three notable sections:
:* The descent down to Sulphur Springs (also known as Palm Springs) will take the hiker through the narrowest section of the canyon. Layered with big boulders, rocks and deep sand, making the journey slow and laborious, hiking the descent results in an average hiking speed between 6 and 10 kilometres per day.
:* The route from Sulphur Springs to Three Sisters is mostly on firmer ground with plenty river stones and frequent river crossings. Average hiking speed is between 15 and 25 kilometres per day.
:* From Three Sisters to ǀAi-ǀAis the canyon widens out with some sections reachable in 4x4 vehicles. Average hiking speed here is between 25 and 35 kilometres per day.

Optional short cuts are available. They offer little in beauty but may be a welcome change of scenery and terrain.
Popular short cuts are found at:
:* the 50 kilometer mark () before Three Sisters to cross over Kooigoed Ridge towards Barble Pools.
:* from Barble Pools () to cross via Vasbyt Nek to the German Soldier&#x27;s grave.
:* Bandage pass () between the Causeway and Fool&#x27;s Gold corner.

===The river===

The river flows stronger early in the season and by September usually dries up to form a chain of stagnant pools. Water is safe to drink, however the use of water purifying tablets is recommended.

River crossings are a notable feature with more than 20 crossings over the course of the trail, and crossings may become a major consideration when water levels are high.

===Emergencies===

There is no mobile phone reception in the canyon and only two emergency exits are available. Evacuation from the deep canyon is done via stretcher on foot or helicopter and vehicles in the later parts of the trail. Emergency exits can be found:
:* prior to Sulphur Springs at 
:* as a Jeep track at . This leads 10 kilometres further to the main road between Ai Ais and Hobas.

==Trail running in the Canyon==

Documented running through the canyon started in 1990. A group of hikers in running gear attempted to complete the 5 day, 90 kilometer hiking trail in 24 hours. They achieved their goal in a time of 11hrs 42min. In August 2003 this time was lowered to 10hrs 54min.
In August 2012, after a previously abandoned attempt in 2011, Ryan Sandes completed the course in 6hrs 57min.

===Hiking records===
===The Fish River Canyon Ultra Marathon===

Unofficial running through the canyon has subsequently evolved into the annual Fish River Canyon Ultra Marathon which held its inaugural race on 27 August 2011.

This technical marathon follows most sections of the current hiking trail, testing the athlete&#x27;s capabilities to the extreme.

The route starts close to Hobas and after a short section on the rim of the canyon steeply descends 500 meters to river level. Thereafter the contestants mostly follow the river to ǀAi-ǀAis. They are allowed to plan their own routes and take short-cuts through the canyon provided they reach a number of predefined checkpoints. Shortcuts may greatly reduce the total distance of the race but may also cost the contestant dearly in effort.

Due to the remoteness of the trail, all competitors are required to be self-sufficient for the duration of the event and are expected to have adequate nutrients as well as the stipulated survival gear. Water is generally sourced from the river which is always close by.

Previous trail runners have commented on the difficulty of the terrain: &quot;The canyon is one of the most beautiful places I have seen but at the same time is one of the harshest environments I have run in. I really battled in the canyon due to the extreme heat and terrain and running in there was one of the toughest days of my athletic career.&quot;
&quot;This canyon is not for the faint hearted and an attempt to run it should not be taken light-heartedly.&quot;

<doc id="637238" wikidata="Q6143503" url="?curid=637238" title="James Stannage">
<text>James Stannage (born Charles James M. Stannage) is an English late night talk show radio host. He presented &quot;The Late Night James Stannage Talk Show&quot; on Manchester&#x27;s Key 103 until being dismissed in June 2005 after numerous warnings and a history of run-ins with regulator OFCOM. He now hosts an online radio show.

==Early career==
Stannage originally started out as an amateur actor and secondary school teacher.

==Radio career==
He first worked for Piccadilly Radio in the mid-1970s, presenting his own late-night phone-in show. Occasional guests on the show were Mike Harding and Jasper Carrott. He was renowned for his abrasive and aggressive style even then, so much so that the Bishop of Salford publicly condemned him as a bad influence.

After leaving Piccadilly Radio, he went on to work for other local radio stations such as TFM Radio during the 1980s before returning to Piccadilly 1152 in 1989. In the early days of his second stint at Piccadilly, his style was mellower than it had been before, but as time wore on became increasingly aggressive again and insulting comments to callers were stoked up as well.

His show was in the format of a phone-in where callers could discuss anything they wanted, from sport, religion, current affairs or politics. Stannage would often argue his case severely (which were usually anti-politics and anti-religion) if he disagreed with callers. Stannage was a well known fellow around Manchester as a result of his Key 103 talk show. In many surveys, Stannage came out as the number one Manchester DJ.

===Rivals===
Stannage had a long-standing rivalry with Radio City talk show presenter, Pete Price. Infrequently, each would &#x27;slag&#x27; the other off on their respective shows, and upon Stannage&#x27;s sacking, Price posted on his forum a topic entitled &quot;James Stannage Sacked&quot;

===Fines===
On 24 November 2005, Emap Radio Group, owners of Key 103 received a fine of £125,000 (then a record for UK radio) after reading out comments and jokes submitted by a listener about the death of Ken Bigley (just two days after his death was confirmed) in October and November 2004.

Key 103 received several fines during Stannage&#x27;s 20-year career on the station, formerly Piccadilly Radio. One outburst cost £15,000 and in 2001, Stannage came under fire for describing First World War soldiers as &quot;thick and ignorant&quot; and he was questioned by police in the same year over allegations that he made a racist remark on his show. In May 2004, he got into trouble because of his jokes in the aftermath of the death of Chinese cockle pickers in Morecambe Bay.

== Ark Royal Pub/Manchester Radio ==
Following his sacking James Stannage worked as a bar tender at the Ark Royal Pub on Tavistock Square in Harpurhey North Manchester before moving on to be one of the first presenters on the online radio station ManchesterRadioOnline.com.

==Miscellaneous==
Comedian Jasper Carrott&#x27;s album &quot;Jasper Carrott Live at Drury Lane&quot; features a routine about James Stannage.

==Personal life==
Stannage has two grown up sons, and two grandchildren. His elder son Darren Stannage is a sports journalist (currently working for Sky News Radio) while his younger son Dominic Stannage is a member of Manchester rock band Hiatus. Both Darren and Dominic also work for NK Theatre Arts at the Forum Theatre in Stockport. His best friend is Sean Gallagher.

<text>Major-General Robert Craufurd (5 May 1764 – 23 January 1812) was a British officer. After a military career which took him from India to the Netherlands, in 1810 in the Napoleonic Peninsular War he was given command of the Light Division, composed of the elite foot soldiers in the army at the time, under the Duke of Wellington. Craufurd was a strict disciplinarian and somewhat prone to violent mood swings which earned him the nickname &quot;Black Bob&quot;. He was mortally wounded storming the lesser breach in the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo on 19 January 1812 and died four days later.

==Early life==
Like Sir John Moore, the Craufurd family originated from Ayrshire. 

Robert Craufurd was born at Newark, Ayrshire, the third son of Sir Alexander Craufurd, 1st Baronet. Alexander Craufurd lived at Newark Castle and Thirdpart, Ayrshire. They belonged to the cadet line of the Craufurds of Auchenames represented the old line of the Craufurds of Loudoun. The castle was sold by Alexander&#x27;s grandfather, who was a friend of the Duke of Buccleuch, and then went to live in England in Essex. He was created a baronet in 1781. His eldest son became Sir James, the second baronet. Robert&#x27;s older brother, Sir Charles Craufurd, was also a British Army soldier.

==Career==

===Early service===
Craufurd entered the Army at the age of 15. He enlisted as an ensign with the 25th Foot in 1779, serving four years as a subaltern. By 19, he was already a company commander. He spent some time at Berlin in 1782, studying the tactics of the army of Frederick the Great and translated into English the official Prussian treatise on the Art of War. Together with his brother Charles, he attended King Frederick the Great&#x27;s review of the troops at Potsdam by personal invitation.

As captain in the 75th Regiment from 1787, he first saw active service against Tippoo Sahib in India in 1790–92, while serving under Lord Cornwallis. His distinguished service was praised earning seniority in captaincies among the purchased commissions. Robert returned to England on leave to help his brother, Colonel Charles. His knowledge of German, a rare accomplishment in the British Army at the end of the eighteenth century, caused him to the given the post of military attaché at Coburg&#x27;s headquarters of the Austrian army from 1794 to 1796.

In 1798 Craufurd was sent as Deputy Assistant Adjutant General on General Lake&#x27;s staff to quash the Irish rebellion against General Humbert. His abilities were recognised by Generals Cornwallis and Lake, who reported well of his performance to the War Office. A year later, due to his German language skills, he was British commissioner on Suvorov&#x27;s staff when Russia invaded Switzerland. At the end of 1799, Craufurd was on the staff in the Helder Expedition, led by the Duke of York.

===Family life===
Robert married on 7 February 1800 at St Saviour&#x27;s Church, Mary Frances, daughter of Henry Holland, Esquire of Hans Place, Chelsea, and granddaughter of the landscape designer Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown. He was very fond of his wife, and, to the exasperation of his general officer commanding, regularly requested &#x27;furlough&#x27; home to see his young love. At the time he often talked to family of retiring from the Army altogether. It was also at this time that he developed a correspondence with the Secretary at War, William Windham. They became firm friends. From 1801 to 1805, Craufurd (by then a lieutenant-colonel) sat in Parliament for East Retford, but in 1807 he resigned to concentrate on soldiering.

=== The Buenos Aires Expedition ===
On 30 October 1805, Craufurd was promoted to full colonel and put in command of his own regiment. He was ordered on an expedition to South America. In 1806 on the promise of another promotion to brigadier-general, he took ship to Rio de Janeiro. The British commander-in-chief, General John Whitelocke, was based at Montevideo. Craufurd&#x27;s brigade consisted of two squadrons of 6th Dragoon Guards, the 5th Dragoon Guards, 36th Regiment, 45th Regiment, and 88th Regiment of Foot, and five companies of the 95th Rifles, totaling 4,200 men. The broad objective was the conquest of Chile. Craufurd departed from Falmouth docks on 12 November 1806, sailing south to the Cape of Good Hope with instructions from William Windham. General Samuel Auchmuty and Admiral Murray were despatched to report back to the Pitt ministry, who wanted the capture of Buenos Aires. They had already left London on 9 October.

The flotilla arrived with 8,000 men on board on 15 June 1807, when the armies were finally united at Buenos Aires. Whitelocke refused to act and was accused by Robert Craufurd of cowardice. He was supported in London by his brother Charles, who had a network of aristocratic contacts. Whitelocke would not countenance an attack on General Santiago de Liniers&#x27; army. The British advanced into the town; Craufurd wrote he wanted to attack the ramparts, but was prevented by his superior officer. The Spanish colonial forces retreated, retrenched in the streets and deployed heavy artillery. Craufurd&#x27;s brigade was forced to retreat to the Convent of Saint Domingo; his brigade was surrounded by 5,000 of the enemy and forced to surrender at 4 pm. A total of 1,070 officers and men were killed or severely wounded; Craufurd and Coadjutor Edmund Pack of Royal Horse Guards were incensed. They offered to shoot the &#x27;traitor&#x27; when they returned to Hythe: Whitelocke compounded the treason when Liniers offered to return prisoners and the 71st Regiment; he agreed and surrendered Montevideo, also promising to withdraw from the River Plate.

Writing in 1891 the biographer Alexander Craufurd states that General Craufurd, and apparently many other officers were &quot;under the impression that Whitelocke was a traitor as well as a timid and vacillating fool, but I have failed to find in the account of the court-martial any solid evidence in support of this impression&quot;.

=== Peninsular campaigns ===
In October 1808, Craufurd sailed for Corunna with Sir David Baird&#x27;s contingent to reinforce the army under Sir John Moore. Moore had marched his forces by several routes to Salamanca. The two forces joined up at Mayorga on 20 December 1808. Moore was then able to reorganise the army, and Craufurd was given command of the 1st Flank Brigade, composed of the 1/43rd, 1/52nd and 2/95th. Intelligence revealed that, apart from the corps of Marshal Soult to his front, Napoleon was advancing at speed from Madrid. Moore was fearful that the army could be overwhelmed by much superior forces and their line of retreat to the sea, some more to port evacuation, could be cut off. On 24 December he order the retreat to Corunna. Craufurd’s Brigade formed part of the rearguard under Major-General Sir Edward Paget. His regiments were heavily engaged in the earlier part of the retreat. The Commissariat was delayed, and there was no food. In freezing winter snow and fog, they marched at double-quick pace, fighting off much larger forces. On 31 December Moore ordered the army to divide. The two flank brigades of Craufurd (with 1,900 men) and Brigadier Charles Alten (with 1,700 men) were ordered along a southerly route via Orense to Vigo, while the main column continued on the Corunna Road.

On New Years Day 1809, they climbed the steep mountain passes. Men died in the snow of hunger, while others found food along the way. It became a trial of the greatest intensity, although it was only the road and the elements against which they had to battle; they were not pursued by the French. A week later at Orense they were starving, marching in rags. They reached the port on 12 January but waited for stragglers before embarking for England.

An important memoir was that from Rifleman Harris, whose eloquence was descriptive. He expressed the men&#x27;s pride in the courage, despite severe discipline of the officers. Craufurd had &quot;a severe look and a scowling eye&quot;, wrote Harris. William Napier thought the brigadier &quot;very attentive to the men&quot;. But &quot;willfulness and folly&quot; was treated very severely by lashings. Unusually for so harsh a disciplinarian, Craufurd was admired and trusted by his men, and Harris had no doubt about his role in saving his command: 

No man but one formed of stuff like General Craufurd could have saved the brigade from perishing altogether; and if he flogged two, he saved hundreds from death by his management … He seemed an iron man; nothing daunted him – nothing turned him from his purpose. War was his very element and toil and danger seemed to call forth only an increasing determination to surmount them … I shall never forget Craufurd if I live for a hundred years I think. He was in everything a soldier.
On 25 May 1809, Craufurd embarked at Dover for Portugal with his brigade, consisting of the 43rd Foot, 52nd Foot and the 95th Rifles. Delayed at The Downs and Isle of Wight by bad weather, they arrived three weeks later on 18 June. Had they been on time Craufurd&#x27;s force might have joined Wellington at Talavera. At Lisbon the brigade purchased packhorses, and accompanied by Capt Hew Ross&#x27; troop of Horse Artillery, they marched to join the main army. By 20 July they had reached Zarza Mayor and on 22 July were at Coria. On the 27th the Light Brigade marched to Navalmoral. Before dawn on the morning of the 28th Craufurd started his attempt to join Sir Arthur Wellesley before the French attacked him at Talavera. The march which followed is one almost unparalleled in military annals. Whilst the distance &#x27;as the crow flies&#x27; from Navalmoral to Talavera is a little over thirty-eight miles, the actual marching distance is about forty-two miles and probably more owing to the turn and windings of the road. In the full heat of Spanish summer and in full regimental kit, the soldiers suffered from a terrible thirst. Their march was driven on by the growling of the cannon in the distance and they left only a few weakly men at Oropesa. In spite of covering about 45 miles in 26 hours, Craufurd arrived too late to participate in the battle.

In early 1810 Wellington obtained intercepted secret letters from Marshall Soult to the King of Spain of the planned attack on Ciudad Rodrigo. The bulk of the army was moved into northern Portugal. On 1 March Craufurd’s Light Brigade become The Light Division. Initially he had 2,500 men from the first battalions of the 43rd, 52nd and 95th together with a troop of horse artillery and one regiment of 500 cavalry from the 1st Hussars of the King’s German Legion. On 28 March these were augmented by 1,000 men from two battalions of Portuguese Caçadores, the 1st and 2nd. The latter of these units was afterwards changed for the 3rd, which was reckoned the most efficient corps that could be selected from Marshal Beresford&#x27;s command. The cavalry force was also increased by two squadrons of the 16th Light Dragoons and, in early July, by the addition of three squadrons of the 14th Light Dragoons.

Robert Craufurd, though only a brigadier, and junior of his rank, had been chosen by Wellington to take charge of his outpost line because he was one of the very few officers then in the Peninsula in whose ability his Commander-in-Chief had perfect confidence. Only with Craufurd, Hill and Beresford, did he ever condescend to enter into explanation and state reasons. In one letter to Craufurd, Wellington writes &quot;Nothing can be of greater advantage to me than to have the benefit of your opinions on &quot;any&quot; subject.&quot;

In 1810 Craufurd was burning to vindicate his reputation and show that the confidence which Wellington placed in him was not undeserved. He could not forget that he was four years older than Beresford, five years older than Wellington, eight years older than Hill, yet but a junior brigadier-general in charge of a division. Though senior in the date of his first commission to nearly all the officers in the Peninsular Army. Craufurd was six years junior to Picton and one year junior to Hope.

The Light Division was pushed forward to the Spanish frontier, and lay in the villages about Almeida, with its outposts pushed forward to the line of the River Águeda. From March to July 1810 Craufurd accomplished the extraordinary feat of guarding a front of 40 miles against an active enemy of six-fold force, without suffering his line to be pierced, or allowing the French to gain any information whatever of the host in his rear. He was in constant and daily touch with Ney’s corps, yet was never surprised, and never thrust back save by absolutely overwhelming strength; he never lost a detachment, never failed to detect every move of the enemy, and never sent his commander false intelligence. This was the result of system and science, not merely of vigilance and activity.

Whilst there were four bridges, there were also some fifteen fords between Ciudad Rodrigo and the mouth of the Águeda, which were practicable in dry weather for all arms, and several of them could be used even after a day or two of rain. Special report were made of the state of the fords every morning and the rapidity of its rises was particularly marked. Beacons were prepared on conspicuous height so as to communicate information as to the enemy&#x27; offensive movements. As Napier remarked in his History, &quot;seven minutes&quot; sufficed for the division to get under arms in the middle of the night, and a quarter of an hour, night or day, to bring it in order of battle to its alarm posts, with baggage loaded and assembled at a convenient distance to the rear.

The first test of the efficiency of Craufurd’s outpost system was made on the night of 19–20 March, when Ferey, commanding the brigade of Loison’s divisions which lay at San Felices, assembled his six voltigeur companies before dawn and made a dash at the old Roman bridge of Barba del Puerco. He had the good luck to bayonet the sentries at the bridge before they could fire and was halfway up the rough 230 metres ascent from the bridge to the village (today called Puerto Seguro), when Beckwith&#x27;s detachment of the 95th Rifles, roused and armed in ten minutes were upon him. They drove him down the defile and chased him back across the river with the loss of two officers and forty-five men killed and wounded. Beckwith’s riflemen lost only one officer with three men killed and ten men wounded from the three companies engaged.

Craufurd&#x27;s operations on the Coa and Águeda in 1810 were daring to the point of rashness; the drawing on of the French forces into what became the Combat of the Coa in particular was a rare lapse in judgement. Although Wellington censured him for his conduct, he later wrote “... I cannot accuse a man who I believe has meant well, and whose error was one of judgement, not of intention.&quot; [see Craufurd’s Life pp. 149–50]

The conduct of the renowned Light Division at Bussaco is described by Napier in one of his most vivid passages.

The winter of 1810–1811, Craufurd spent in England, and his division was commanded in the interim by another officer. He reappeared on the field of the Fuentes de Oñoro to the cheers of his men. Wellington had left the 7th Division exposed on his right flank. On 5 May 1811 Masséna launched a heavy attack on the weak British-Portuguese flank, led by Montbrun&#x27;s dragoons and supported by the infantry divisions of Marchand, Mermet, and Solignac. Right away, two 7th Division battalions were roughed up by the French light cavalry. This compelled Wellington to send reinforcements to save it from annihilation. This was only achieved by the efforts of the Light Division and the British and King&#x27;s German Legion cavalry who made a textbook fighting withdrawal.

Craufurd was promoted to major-general on 4 June 1811.

=== Death at Ciudad Rodrigo ===

On 19 January 1812, as he stood on the glacis of Ciudad Rodrigo, directing the stormers of the Light Division, he fell mortally wounded. His body was carried out of action by his staff officer, Lieutenant Shaw of the 43rd, and, after lingering four days, he died.

He was buried in the breach of the fortress where he had met his death, and a monument in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral commemorates Craufurd and Mackinnon, the two generals killed at the storming of Ciudad Rodrigo.

Major-General Craufurd was nicknamed &#x27;Black Bob&#x27;. The nickname is supposed to refer to his habit of heavily cursing when losing his temper, his nature as a strict disciplinarian and even to his noticeably dark and heavy facial stubble. During the First World War, a &quot;Lord Clive&quot; class monitor was named for him, HMS &quot;General Craufurd&quot;.

<doc id="637240" wikidata="Q1509981" url="?curid=637240" title="Round-trip engineering">
<text>Round-trip engineering (RTE) in the context of model-driven architecture is a functionality of software development tools that synchronizes two or more related software artifacts, such as, source code, models, configuration files, documentation, etc. between each other. The need for round-trip engineering arises when the same information is present in multiple artifacts and when an inconsistency may arise in case some artifacts are updated. For example, some piece of information was added to/changed in only one artifact (source code) and, as a result, it became missing in/inconsistent with the other artifacts (in models).

== Overview ==
Round-trip engineering is closely related to traditional software engineering disciplines: forward engineering (creating software from specifications), reverse engineering (creating specifications from existing software), and reengineering (understanding existing software and modifying it). Round-trip engineering is often wrongly defined as simply supporting both forward and reverse engineering. In fact, the key characteristic of round-trip engineering that distinguishes it from forward and reverse engineering is the ability to synchronize &quot;existing&quot; artifacts that evolved &quot;concurrently&quot; by &quot;incrementally&quot; updating each artifact to reflect changes made to the other artifacts. Furthermore, forward engineering can be seen as a special instance of RTE in which only the specification is present and reverse engineering can be seen as a special instance of RTE in which only the software is present. Many reengineering activities can also be understood as RTE when the software is updated to reflect changes made to the previously reverse engineered specification.

=== Types ===
Various books describe two types of RTE:

* partial or uni-directional RTE: changes made to a higher level representation of a code and model are reflected in lower level, but not otherwise; the latter might be allowed, but with limitations that may not affect higher-level abstractions
* full or bi-directional RTE: regardless of changes, both higher and lower-level code and model representations are synchronized if any of them altered

=== Auto synchronization ===
Another characteristic of round-trip engineering is &quot;automatic&quot; update of the artifacts in response to &quot;automatically&quot; detected inconsistencies. In that sense, it is different from forward- and reverse engineering which can be both manual (traditionally) and automatic (via automatic generation or analysis of the artifacts). The automatic update can be either &quot;instantaneous&quot; or &quot;on-demand&quot;. In instantaneous RTE, all related artifacts are immediately updated after each change made to one of them. In on-demand RTE, authors of the artifacts may concurrently update the artifacts (even in a distributed setting) and at some point choose to execute matching to identify inconsistencies and choose to propagate some of them and reconcile potential conflicts.

=== Iterative approach ===
Round trip engineering may involve an iterative development process. After you have synchronized your model with revised code, you are still free to choose the best way to work – make further modifications to the code or make changes to your model. You can synchronize in either direction at any time and you can repeat the cycle as many times as necessary.

== Software ==
Many commercial tools and research prototypes support this form of RTE; a 2007 book lists Rational Rose, Micro Focus Together, ESS-Model, BlueJ, and Fujaba among those capable, with Fujaba said to be capable to also identify design patterns.

== Limitations ==
A 2005 book on Visual Studio notes for instance that a common problem in RTE tools is that the model reversed is not the same as the original one, unless the tools are aided by leaving laborious annotations in the source code. The behavioral parts of UML impose even more challenges for RTE.

Usually, UML class diagrams are supported to some degree; however, certain UML concepts, such as &quot;associations&quot; and &quot;containment&quot; do not have straightforward representations in many programming languages which limits the usability of the created code and accuracy of code analysis/reverse engineering (e.g., containment is hard to recognize in the code).

A more tractable form of round-trip engineering is implemented in the context of framework application programming interfaces (APIs), whereby a model describing the usage of a framework API by an application is synchronized with that application&#x27;s code. In this setting, the API &quot;prescribes&quot; all correct ways the framework can be used in applications, which allows precise and complete detection of API usages in the code as well as creation of useful code implementing correct API usages. Two prominent RTE implementations in this category are framework-specific modeling languages and Spring Roo (Java).

Round-trip engineering is critical for maintaining consistency among multiple models and between the models and the code in Object Management Group&#x27;s (OMG) Model-driven architecture. OMG proposed the QVT (query/view/transformation) standard to handle model transformations required for MDA. To date, a few implementations of the standard have been created. (Need to present practical experiences with MDA in relation to RTE).

== Controversies ==

=== Code generation controversy ===
Code generation (forward-engineering) from models means that the user abstractly models solutions, which are connoted by some model data, and then an automated tool derives from the models parts or all of the source code for the software system. In some tools, the user can provide a skeleton of the program source code, in the form of a source code template where predefined tokens are then replaced with program source code parts during the code generation process.

UML (if used for MDA) diagrams specification was criticized for lack the detail which is needed to contain the same information as is covered with the program source. Some developers even claim that &quot;the Code &quot;is&quot; the design&quot;.

== Disadvantages ==
There is a serious risk that the generated code will rapidly differ from the model or that the reverse-engineered model will lose its reflection on the code or a mix of these two problems as result of cycled reengineering efforts.

Regarding behavioral/dynamic part of UML for features like statechart diagram there is no equivalents in programming languages. Their translation during code-generation will result in common programming statement (.e.g ) being either missing or misinterpreted. If edited and imported back may result in different or incomplete model. The same goes for code snippets used for code generation stage for the pattern-implementation and user-specific logic: intermixed they may not be easily reverse-engineered back.

There is also general lack of advanced tooling for modelling that are comparable to that of modern IDEs (for testing, debugging, navigation, etc.) for general-purpose programming languages and domain-specific languages.

==Examples in software engineering==
Perhaps the most common form of round-trip engineering is synchronization between UML (Unified Modeling Language) models and the corresponding source code and entity–relationship diagrams in data modelling and database modelling.

Round-trip engineering based on Unified Modeling Language (UML) needs three basic tools for software development:

* Source Code Editor;
* UML Editor for the Attributes and Methods;
* Visualisation of UML structure

<text>Tennessee Technological University (commonly referred to as Tennessee Tech) is a public research university in Cookeville, Tennessee. It was formerly known as Tennessee Polytechnic Institute, and before that as University of Dixie, the name under which it was founded as a private institution. Affiliated with the Tennessee Board of Regents, the university is governed by a board of trustees. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

As an institute of technology, Tennessee Tech places special emphasis on undergraduate education in fields related to engineering, technology, and computer science, although degrees in education, liberal arts, agriculture, nursing, and other fields of study can be pursued as well. Additionally, there are graduate and doctorate offerings in engineering, education, business, and the liberal arts. As of the 2018 fall semester, Tennessee Tech enrolls more than 10,000 students, and its campus has 87 buildings on centered along Dixie Avenue in northern Cookeville.

Tennessee Tech athletic teams, named the Golden Eagles, compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I as a member of the Ohio Valley Conference.

==History==
Tennessee Tech is rooted in the University of Dixie (colloquially known as Dixie College), which was chartered in 1909 and began operations in 1912. It struggled with funding and enrollment, however, and the campus was deeded to local governments. On March 27, 1915, the state government assumed control of the campus and chartered the new school as Tennessee Polytechnic Institute. The new school included just 13 faculty members and 19 students during the 1916–17 academic year and consisted of just 18 acres of undeveloped land with one administrative building and two student dorms. Due to the rural nature of the school, students also worked in the school garden to grow and prepare their own meals. In 1929, the first class graduated with four-year bachelor&#x27;s degrees. Tennessee Polytechnic Institute was elevated to university status in 1965, when its name changed to Tennessee Technological University.

The Tennessee Tech athletic program is a member of the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) and competes in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision. The school&#x27;s teams are known as the Golden Eagles, the team colors are purple and gold, and the mascot is Awesome Eagle.

== Theater ==
The Backdoor Playhouse was founded in the 1960s. Its current theater seats 200 spectators. In the academic year 2014/15, they produced a selection of at least five plays, among them &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot;, &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;, and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. The playhouse attracted news coverage in the summer of 2022, when the local Upper Cumberland Pride, the Lambda Gay-Straight Alliance, and the Tech Players staged a drag performance in the on-campus theater. A video excerpt of the performance, in which a child pays a drag performer money while the performer mouths the words &quot;Take Me To Church,&quot; was posted on-line by child protection activist Landon Starbuck. 

==Traditions and campus lore==

* Golden Eagle: The statue now atop Derryberry Hall was stolen by three students (Tom Moran, Roy Loudermilk, and Lewis Brown) from the lawn of the burned-out Monteagle Hotel in Monteagle, Tennessee, in November 1952. The three had hoped the eagle would provide the ultimate prop for the pep rally prior to the football game against then-rival Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU). The hotel&#x27;s owner, John Harton (a former state treasurer), demanded the return of the statue and initially rejected all offers to purchase it. He finally relented and sold the statue for $500 after Governor Frank G. Clement intervened. The eagle, which weighs and has a , was initially placed atop Jere Whitson Hall. It was moved to its current position atop Derryberry in 1961.
* &quot;Dammit&quot; the dog: A former university president once said &quot;dammit&quot; to a dog in front of a crowd, covering by saying that was the dog&#x27;s name. Dammit has his own tombstone, an operable fire hydrant, on campus opposite Derryberry Hall.
* The &quot;Blizzard&quot; is a tradition which started in 1984, when students celebrated the first successful shot made by Tennessee Tech in a basketball game against MTSU by throwing showers of &quot;Tech Squares&quot; (toilet paper) into the air. Since MTSU moved to the Sun Belt Conference, the Blizzard is now performed against Austin Peay State University.

== Significant administrative buildings ==

Derryberry Hall is the oldest building on campus; the presidents and provosts have traditionally had their offices there. The building is also the home to the university&#x27;s main auditorium, Derryberry Auditorium. Derryberry was constructed in 1912 for the university&#x27;s predecessor, Dixie College. It is named after Everett Derryberry, president of the university from 1940 to 1974. The building&#x27;s iconic colonial-style clock tower is equipped has a carillon. Maya Angelou spoke there in 2012. Derryberry received a new cupola in 2021.

Henderson Hall is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, The building was designed by Benjamin F. Hunt, who worked for the noted regional architect R. H. Hunt. Constructed in 1931, the building is named in honor of James Manson Henderson, the first director of the university&#x27;s School of Engineering.

== Residential buildings ==

=== Traditional halls ===

<text>is a Japanese metalworking procedure which produces a mixed-metal laminate with distinctive layered patterns; the term is also used to refer to the resulting laminate itself. The term translates closely to &#x27;wood grain metal&#x27; or &#x27;wood eye metal&#x27; and describes the way metal takes on the appearance of natural wood grain. fuses several layers of differently coloured precious metals together to form a sandwich of alloys called a &quot;billet.&quot; The billet is then manipulated in such a way that a pattern resembling wood grain emerges over its surface. Numerous ways of working create diverse patterns. Once the metal has been rolled into a sheet or bar, several techniques are used to produce a range of effects.

 has been used to create many artistic objects. Though the technique was first developed for production of decorative sword fittings, the craft is today mostly used in the production of jewelry and hollowware.

== History ==
===Origins===
First developed in 17th-century Japan, was originally used for swords. As the customary Japanese sword stopped serving as a weapon and became largely a status symbol, a demand arose for elaborate decorative handles and sheaths.

To meet this demand, Denbei Shoami (1651–1728), a master metalworker from Akita prefecture, invented the process. He initially called his product , as the technique in its simplest form resembled , a type of carved lacquerwork with alternating layers of red and black. Other historical names for it were , , and .

The early components of were relatively soft metals and alloys (gold, copper, silver, , , and ) which would form liquid phase diffusion bonds with one another without completely melting. This was useful in the traditional techniques of fusing and soldering the layers together.

Over time, the practice of faded. The katana industry dried up in the late 19th century, with the Meiji Restoration returning ruling power to the emperor, following the dissolution of the shogunate government and the end of the samurai class. The public display of swords as a sign of samurai status was outlawed. After this, the few metalsmiths who practiced along with most other sword related artisans largely transferred their skills to create other objects.

===Adoption of in the West===
Tiffany &amp; Co&#x27;s silver division under the direction of Edward C. Moore began to experiment with techniques around 1877, and at the Paris exposition of 1878, Tiffany&#x27;s grand prize-winning display of Moore&#x27;s &quot;Japanesque&quot; silver wares included a magnificent &quot;Conglomerate Vase&quot; with asymmetrical panels of . Moore and Tiffany&#x27;s silver smiths continued to develop its popular techniques in preparation for the Paris exposition of 1889, where it displayed a vast array of Japanesque silver, using ever more complex alloys of , and , along with gold and silver, to make laminates of up to twenty-four layers. Tiffany&#x27;s display again won the grand prize for silver wares, and the company continued to produce its Japanesque silver with techniques up into the 20th century.

===20th-21st century development===
By the mid 20th century, had fallen into heavy obscurity. Japan&#x27;s movement away from traditional craftwork, paired with the great difficulty of mastering , had brought artisans to the brink of extinction. It reached a point where only scholars and collectors of metalwork were aware of the technique. It was not until the 1970s, when Hiroko Sato Pijanowski – who learned the craft from Norio Tamagawa – that the craft was reignited in the public eye, as Hiroko and her husband Eugene Pijanowski brought the craft of back to the United States and began teaching it to their students.

===Present day===
Today, jewelry, flatware, hollowware, spinning tops and other artistic objects are made using .

Modern processes are highly controlled and include a compressive force on the billet. This has allowed the technique to include many nontraditional components such as titanium, platinum, iron, bronze, brass, nickel silver, and various colors of karat gold including yellow, white, sage, and rose hues as well as sterling silver. At the Santa Fe Symposium, a major annual gathering of jewelers from around the world, there have been several papers presented on new, more predictable, and more economic, methods of producing materials, along with new possibilities for laminating metals such as the use of friction-stir welding.

==Techniques==

===Liquid phase fusion (historic)===
In liquid phase fusion, metal sheets were stacked and carefully heated; the solid billet of simple stripes could be forged and carved to increase the pattern&#x27;s complexity. Successful lamination using this process requires a highly skilled smith with a great deal of experience. Bonding in the traditional process is achieved when some or all of the alloys in the stack are heated to the point of becoming partially molten (above solidus) this liquid alloy is what fuses the layers together. Careful heat control and skillful forging are required for this process.

===Soldering (brazing)===
In attempting to recreate the appearance of traditional , some artisans tried brazing layers together. The sheets were soldered using silver solder or some other brazing alloy. This technique joined the metals, but is difficult to perfect, particularly on larger sheets, because flux inclusions can trapped or bubbles could form. Commonly, these imperfections need to be cut out, and the metal re-soldered. In addition, brazed sheets also do not display the same levels of ductility and work-ability of diffusion-bonded material.

===Solid-state bonding (contemporary)===
The modernized process of solid-state bonding typically uses a controlled atmosphere in a temperature-controlled furnace. Mechanical aids such as a hydraulic press or torque plates (bolted clamps) are also typically used to apply compressive force on the billet during lamination. These provide for the implementation of lower temperature solid-state diffusion between the interleaved layers, thus allowing the inclusion of non-traditional materials.

== Development of the pattern ==
After the layer fusion, the surface of the billet is cut with chisel to expose lower layers, then flattened. This cutting and flattening process will be repeated over and over again to develop intricate patterns.

==Coloring==
To increase the contrast between the laminate layers, many items are colored by the application of a patina (a controlled corrosion layer) to accentuate or even totally change the colors of the metal&#x27;s surface.

=== patination and ===
One example of a traditional Japanese patination for is the use of the process, usually involving , a complex copper verdigris compound produced specifically for use as a patina. The piece to be patinated is prepared, then immersed in a boiling solution until it reaches the desired color, and each element of a compound piece may be transformed to a different color. Historically, a paste of ground daikon radish was also used to prepare the work for the patina. The paste was applied immediately before the piece is boiled in the to protect the surface against tarnish and uneven coloring.

==Similar laminates==
In an accidental but parallel development, Sheffield plate was developed in England. It follows a similar principal of bonded layers, without use of solder, but typically had 2–3 layers, whereas could have many more.

<text>Frederick Hans Lowy, (born 1933) is a Canadian medical educator and former President and Vice-Chancellor of Concordia University.

==Life and career==
Born in Großpetersdorf, Austria, in 1933, Lowy moved to Montreal at age 13. After graduating from Baron Byng High School, Lowy studied medicine at McGill University, graduating in 1959. While at McGill University, he assisted Donald Ewan Cameron on Human subject research as part of Cameron&#x27;s Project MKULTRA research for &quot;KUBARK&quot; manuals. As an undergraduate, he was managing editor of the &quot;McGill Daily&quot; student newspaper. He was a psychiatric consultant at the Royal Victoria Hospital and Neurological Institute in the late 1960s.

Lowy moved to Toronto in 1974 to become psychiatrist-in-chief and director of the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry and professor at, and chair of, the University of Toronto&#x27;s Department of Psychiatry, succeeding Robin C.A. Hunter. He served as dean of the Faculty of Medicine from 1980 to 1987. He was the founder and first director of the University&#x27;s Centre for Bioethics (now University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics). In 1995 he returned to Montreal to become the 4th rector and vice-chancellor of Concordia University. (In 2004 the English title of the position was changed to &quot;President and Vice-Chancellor&quot;.) He held this post until August 1, 2005.

Lowy was the first chair of Canada&#x27;s Tri-Council (Medical Research Council, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council) Working Group on Ethics of Research on Human subjects (1994–1995) and vice-chair, Hospital Restructuring Committee, Metro Toronto District Health Council (1994–1995).

Lowy&#x27;s previous medical appointments include positions at the Cincinnati General Hospital, the Ottawa Civic Hospital and the Toronto Hospital. He has also served as a consultant to numerous research foundations and hospitals.

Lowy has lectured and published widely. His most recent publications examine ethical issues that face modern physicians and health science researchers. Lowy was a member of the Board of Directors of the Montreal Board of Trade and of Centraide (Montreal); Vice-President of the Conference of Rectors and Principals of Quebec; and a former board member of the National Ballet of Canada. Lowy has been a trustee at Ontario&#x27;s Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, the Mount Sinai, St. Michael&#x27;s, and Toronto Hospitals, and the Ontario Cancer Institute. He chaired an Ontario Government inquiry into the pharmaceutical industry (1988–1990) and held numerous professional editorial posts, including Editor of the &quot;Canadian Journal of Psychiatry&quot;.

Lowy sits on the board of directors of Dundee Corporation, Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, and Montreal&#x27;s Jewish General Hospital, Canadian Centre for Architecture, and the Sauve Scholars Foundation.

In 2000 he was named an Officer of the Order of Canada. He has received honorary degrees from the University of Toronto (1998), McGill University (2001), and Concordia University (2008). Lowy is married to Mary Kay Lowy (Dr. M.K. O&#x27;Neil). He has four children, David, Eric, Adam, and Sarah, and nine grandchildren.

<text>Rafael Jose Betancourt (born April 29, 1975) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball relief pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians and Colorado Rockies, as well as in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Yokohama BayStars.

==Career==
===Boston Red Sox===
Betancourt was originally signed as an amateur free agent by the Boston Red Sox on September 13, 1993. The Red Sox released him following the 1999 season and then re-signed him as a free agent in December 2000 after he spent the 2000 season with the Yokohama BayStars. He was granted free agency again in October 2001, after serving the required time to acquire free agency.

===Cleveland Indians===

After sitting out the 2002 season due to right elbow surgery, Betancourt signed with the Cleveland Indians as a minor league free agent on February 6, 2003. He began the season with the Double-A Akron Aeros, making 31 appearances and posting a 1.39 ERA, 16 saves and 75 strikeouts in innings. Betancourt was soon promoted to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons, where he recorded one save and a 4.05 ERA in four games. On July 12, the Indians purchased Betancourt&#x27;s contract, and he made his Major League debut for the Indians the next day against the Chicago White Sox. In the game, he tossed innings, giving up an earned run while walking one and striking out one. Betancourt pitched in 33 games for the Indians in 2003, going 2–2 with one save and an ERA of 2.13.

In 2004, Betancourt spent the entire season with the Indians, finishing 5–6 with four saves and a 3.92 ERA in 68 relief appearances.

On July 8, 2005, Betancourt became the sixth Major League player to be suspended for testing positive in steroids testing. He went on to appear in 54 games, posting a 4–3 record, one save and a 2.79 ERA.

In 2006, Betancourt&#x27;s ERA grew a full run higher than his previous season. He finished with a 3–4 record, three saves and a 3.81 ERA in 50 relief appearances. Betancourt&#x27;s best season was in 2007, as he finished 5–1 with three saves and a 1.47 ERA in 68 relief appearances. He registered career bests in ERA, innings pitched (), WHIP (0.76), and walks allowed (9).

On January 23, 2008, Betancourt signed a new two-year contract with the Indians worth $5.4 million guaranteed. The deal also included a $5 million club option for 2010. His success from 2007 did not carry over to 2008, as he finished 3–4 with four saves and a 5.07 ERA in 69 relief appearances. In 2009, Betancourt began the season 1–2 with one save and a 3.52 ERA in 29 games.

===Colorado Rockies===
On July 23, 2009, Betancourt was traded to the Colorado Rockies for minor league pitcher Connor Graham. He made 32 relief appearances with the Rockies to finish the season, going 3–1 with one save and a 1.78 ERA. His $5 million club option was declined at the end of the season, making him a free agent. Betancourt qualified as a Type A free agent, and was offered arbitration by the Rockies.

On December 7, 2009, Betancourt accepted the arbitration offer from the Rockies, returning to the team from free agency. In his first full season in Colorado, he finished 5–1 with one save and a 3.61 ERA in 72 games. Betancourt improved on those numbers in 2011, going 2–0 with eight saves and a 2.89 ERA in 68 relief appearances.

After numerous seasons being a set up man, Betancourt was named the Rockies&#x27; closer prior to the 2012 season. On January 25, he signed a two-year, $8.5 million contract extension with the Rockies that included an option for 2014. Betancourt saved 31 games as closer, and posted a 1–4 record with a 2.81 ERA in 60 relief appearances.

Betancourt made 32 relief appearances in 2013, going 2–5 with 16 saves and a 4.08 ERA. On August 22, he suffered a season-ending injury to his right elbow. Eight days later, it was announced that Betancourt would undergo Tommy John surgery to repair the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow. Despite concerns that the injury may end his career, manager Walt Weiss stated that Betancourt would continue pitching. On October 29, the Rockies declined his option for 2014, making him a free agent.

On April 25, 2014, Betancourt signed a new minor league deal with the Rockies. He spent the season rehabbing from surgery and did not make an appearance in the majors.

On January 30, 2015, Betancourt signed a minor league contract to remain with the Rockies. He made his return to the Rockies&#x27; bullpen on April 6, tossing a scoreless inning while striking out two in Colorado&#x27;s 10–0 win over the Milwaukee Brewers. On August 23, Betancourt was designated for assignment. At the time, he was 2–4 with one save a 6.18 ERA in 45 relief appearances. Betancourt was released by the Rockies on August 27.

Betancourt announced his retirement from baseball on February 26, 2016.

==Pitching style==
Betancourt&#x27;s best pitches were a 90–94 MPH four-seam fastball, and a slider which was often mistakenly called a slurve. He also threw a changeup. Although he was not classified as a strikeout pitcher, Betancourt got more than his share by throwing a significant number of strikes. He was a converted shortstop with a metal plate and six screws in his pitching elbow.

Betancourt was known in some circles for his odd windup. He constantly tapped his foot on the rubber before coming set with a runner on base. He would constantly move his hands around and then tug on his baseball cap (sometimes doing it nine times) prior to throwing the next pitch. This was among the longest windups in the league. There is a rule to avoid unnecessary delays which states that if a pitcher takes at least 12 seconds to deliver a pitch, the pitch is automatically ruled a ball. Betancourt was one of the few pitchers who have had this rule enforced while pitching.

<text>Pelee Island is an island in 
the Canadian province of Ontario. It is located in the western half of Lake Erie. At , Pelee Island is the largest island in Lake Erie and the southernmost populated point in Canada. An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate the development of Pelee Island&#x27;s role in Ontario&#x27;s heritage. Nearby Middle Island is the southernmost point of land in Canada.

Due to its southerly location and the moderating effect of Lake Erie, it has a slightly milder climate than inland areas. Its climate is one of the mildest in Canada, and the island has been used for vineyards and wine making since 1860, though local wine making died out in the early twentieth century and was restarted in the 1980s by the Pelee Island Winery. The island is an agricultural-based community, which grows about of soybeans, about of wheat, of grapes, and a few hectares of specialty corn.

The island is connected to the Canadian mainland and the United States by ferry service. It is a part of an important flyway for migrating birds between Ohio, the Lake Erie islands and Point Pelee. For many years, the island has hosted a fall pheasant hunt which attracts hunters from Canada, the United States and many other countries. The pheasant hunt brings tourist dollars to Pelee at a time of year when virtually no other activities are available, thus generating important revenue in the offseason.

==History==
Evidence of occupation by indigenous peoples can be dated back 10,000 years through archaeological evidence of projectiles and ceremonial objects. European settlement of the island began in 1788 when the land was leased to Thomas McKee by the Ojibwa and Odawa tribes. William McCormick bought the island in 1823 and the McCormick family settled permanently in 1834. In addition to subsistence agriculture, the island&#x27;s lumber, stone quarries, and fishing supported inhabitants. Wine making on Pelee Island began in the 1860s.

Pelee Island features an original 1833 lighthouse that was once used to guide sailors through the rocky Pelee Passage. Lake Erie is full of shipwrecks; Pelee Passage alone contains the remains of at least 15 shipwrecks. One wreck that is particularly close to the island, &quot;JJ Carroll&quot;, is just off the eastern shore of Fish Point.

Pelee was the site of a battle during the Patriot War. The Battle of Pelee Island took place along what is now the Michigan-Ontario border in 1838 involving small groups of men on each side of the border seeking to &quot;liberate&quot; Upper Canada from the British. On February 26, 1838, 300 men captured the island, and on March 3 they were repulsed and either fled the island or were captured.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Due to its southerly location and the moderating effect of Lake Erie, it has a slightly milder climate than inland areas. Its climate is one of the mildest in Canada outside of British Columbia, and the island has long been used for vineyards and wine making. It has the longest frost free season in Ontario. It lies within the Carolinian forest region. The island has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa&quot;) and falls into the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 7a. Winters are cold with a January average of and the average annual snowfall is , which falls mainly from November to April. Summers are warm and humid with a July high of and a low of . Temperatures rarely go over , averaging 4 days per year. Pelee island and Point Pelee receive the fewest days with precipitation in Ontario, averaging 75 days with measurable precipitation, and drought-like conditions occur every 4–5 years. The average annual precipitation is which is evenly distributed throughout the year with January and February being the driest months. The record low was on January 20, 1985 and the record high was on July 24, 1934.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Pelee had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Economy==
===Tourism===
Pelee Island is a popular tourist destination, with thousands of visitors each year. There are several key events such as the Annual Springsong Weekend, a celebration of birds and books, traditionally held on Mother&#x27;s day weekend, and hosted by famed Canadian author Margaret Atwood. Pelee Island Stone &amp; Sky Music &amp; Art Series feature spoken word, live performance and visual arts weekly for the duration of the summer. The Stone &amp; Sky Farmer&#x27;s Market is held every Saturday in the Quarry throughout the summer. The southernmost Chili Cook Off takes place at the Pelee Island Winery Pavilion. The season wraps with the Heritage Weekend, hosted by the Pelee Island Heritage Centre.

Canada Day is celebrated on the island with a fireworks display and a parade along the West Shore Road.

The Pelee Island Half Marathon attracts runners from both the United States and Canada to participate in what is billed as Canada&#x27;s southernmost and most exclusive half-marathon. Only about 350 runners are allowed to register for the race which is held the first weekend in June.

====Ecotourism====
Pelee Island has features that make it an ecotourist destination. Pelee is the southernmost inhabited part of Canada and is situated on two major migratory bird routes, the Atlantic Flyway and the Mississippi flyway. The island has been designated as a globally Important Bird Area (IBA) by the Canadian partners of BirdLife International: the Canadian Nature Federation (CNF) and Bird Studies Canada (BSC). IBAs are described as “truly outstanding sites of significance nationally or internationally and sites that are exceptionally important for birds”. Every year the return of the migratory birds is celebrated on Pelee with the Annual Springsong Weekend, usually taking place on Mother&#x27;s Day weekend. Pelee Island Bird Observatory located on the island work to conserve and study birds on the island, and offers visitors the opportunity to take part in tracking, tagging and photographing the wide variety of species present.

Pelee Island is one of Ontario&#x27;s most botanically significant sites, and features several Nature Conservancy of Canada areas, and two Provincial Nature Reserves, Lighthouse Point Nature Reserve and Fish Point Nature Reserve. Glaciation left a variety of habitats for wildlife, such as wetlands, sand dunes, alvars (areas of limestone with a shallow overburden), and deep soils suitable to the trees of the Eastern Deciduous Forest zone. Pelee Island is home to numerous species at risk including both flora and fauna as well as insects, snails, mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians.

==Government==
Pelee Island constitute most of the Township of Pelee which has its own mayor, deputy mayor, and three councillors. It is a separated township, not administratively part of any county (for census purposes, it is treated as part of Essex County). The township comprises nine islands, the largest and only inhabited one being Pelee Island. The other islands are Middle Island, Middle Sister Island, Hen Island, Big Chicken Island, Little Chicken Island, Chick Island, East Sister Island, and North Harbour Island. The total land area of all islands in the township is .

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
The island is serviced by two ferries, MV &quot;Pelee Islander II&quot; and MV &quot;Pelee Islander&quot; (owned by Pelee Island Transportation Company, a subsidiary of the OSTC). MV &quot;Pelee Islander II&quot; is the largest passenger ferry along the Lake Erie route to Pelee Island. The leisurely cruise to Pelee Island can range from one-and-a-half to just over two hours depending on departure routes. The ferry service splits the season between Leamington and Kingsville on the Ontario mainland. Leaving from Leamington from early spring until August, the ferry then finishes the season (mid December) in nearby Kingsville. The ferry from Pelee Island to Sandusky, Ohio runs only from late spring until early fall, while &quot;Pelee Islander II&quot; runs from the Canadian ports of Leamington and/or Kingsville from early spring until early December. When the ferries are not operating, the only practical way to get to the mainland or to Pelee Island is via airplane. In January 2004, a Cessna 208 Caravan crashed on takeoff from Pelee, killing eight pheasant hunters, the pilot and his girlfriend. The plane crashed into the shallow waters of Lake Erie. It is believed the plane was overloaded and potentially ice-laden according to the Transportation Safety Board of Canada report.
The older MV &quot;Pelee Islander&quot;, which continues to operate, carries 196 passengers and 14 vehicles. MV &quot;Upper Canada&quot;, which serviced Pelee prior to &quot;Jiimaan&quot;, was sent to Lake Huron (the people of Christian Island received her for transport to and from the mainland) when &quot;Jiimaan&quot; began service to Pelee. &quot;Pelee Islander&quot; was built at Erieau, Ontario in 1960.

In June 2015, the Ontario Government announced that it would invest $40 million in a new ferry, to replace MV &quot;Pelee Islander&quot;. A tender was awarded to Asenav of Chile to build the replacement ferry, MV Pelee Islander II, which carries 399 passengers and 34 vehicles.

During the winter season (starting December 11 until the start of the ferry the next year) Pelee Island Transportation Company operates an air service to the Pelee Island Airport from Windsor.

===Emergency services===
There is a medical clinic on the island operated by the Victorian Order of Nurses. This Nursing Station has regular hours of operation during the summer but does not respond to emergencies. In the event of an emergency, visitors or residents of the island are instructed to call 911. Essex-Windsor EMS are on the Island 365 days a year to provide emergency paramedic services. Air Ambulance services are also available to airlift patients to the nearest hospital if necessary.

The Pelee Island Volunteer Fire Department is present on the Island 365 days a year and responds to 911 calls on the Island; the Department is made up of a fire chief, a deputy fire chief, and volunteers.

Police services on the island are provided by the Ontario Provincial Police. Officers are present on the island four days a week during the summer, during the annual pheasant hunt in the fall, and on the long weekend in May. During the winter, police will fly to the island to respond to emergency calls only. There are typically two officers on the island at a time. The OPP detachment is located on the second floor of the municipal building.

==Education==
Pelee Island has one school which is part of the Greater Essex County District School Board and serves students from Junior Kindergarten through grade 8. Children on the island can choose to attend high school on the mainland or they can complete high school courses online with the assistance of the teachers at Pelee Island Public School. The school has a student population of about 10 to 20 pupils at any given time and a staff of two to three teachers. Classes are held in a traditional three room school house that was built in 1927 and is located at the north west corner of the island. Every year the children of the school raise money for an annual field trip by holding a raffle during the island&#x27;s fall pheasant hunt.

<doc id="637255" wikidata="Q1802829" url="?curid=637255" title="Marshall Allen">
<text>Marshall Belford Allen (born May 25, 1924) is an American free jazz and avant-garde jazz alto saxophone player. He also performs on flute, oboe, piccolo, and the EWI.

Allen is best known for his work with Sun Ra, having recorded and performed mostly in this context since the late 1950s, and having led The Sun Ra Arkestra since 1995, after Sun Ra&#x27;s death in 1993 and John Gilmore&#x27;s death two years later. Critic Jason Ankeny describes Marshall as &quot;one of the most distinctive and original saxophonists of the postwar era.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life and military service===
Marshall Belford Allen was born on May 25, 1924, in Louisville, Kentucky.

During the Second World War he enlisted in the 92nd Infantry Division, known as the Buffalo Soldiers Division, and was stationed in France. Allen studied alto saxophone in Paris.

===Music career===
Allen played in Europe with jazz pianist Art Simmons and saxophonist James Moody.

Allen is best known for his mastery of explosive, jarring, chaotic sound effects on the alto saxophone. Some have referred to this as a &quot;pyrotechnic&quot; playing style. He has said that he &quot;wanted to play on a broader sound basis rather than on chords&quot; (1971 interview with Tam Fiofori)). The opportunity came through his long association with Sun Ra, with whom he performed almost exclusively from 1958 to Ra&#x27;s death in 1993, although he did record outside The Sun Ra Arkestra, with Paul Bley&#x27;s group in 1964 and Olatunji&#x27;s group during the mid-1960s. Critic Scott Yanow has described Allen&#x27;s playing as &quot;Johnny Hodges from another dimension&quot;.

After Sun Ra died, first John Gilmore led the Arkestra, then Allen took over as leader. The Arkestra recorded two albums with Allen as their bandleader. In May 2004, Allen celebrated his 80th birthday on stage with the Arkestra, as part of their performance at the Ninth Vision Festival in New York City. Allen gave other performances on his birthday in 2008 at Sullivan Hall and at Iridium Jazz Club in 2018, both in New York City.

Allen often appeared in New York-area collaborations with bassist Henry Grimes and has also participated in the &quot;Innerzone Orchestra&quot; together with Francisco Mora Catlett, Carl Craig and others in an appreciation of Sun Ra&#x27;s music. He performed the part of Sun Ra, the Egyptian god, in The Eighth Hour of Amduat, an opera with text from a 5000-year-old book on the sun&#x27;s nightly journey through the underworld.

==Honors and later life==
Since 1968, Allen has lived in the Arkestral Institute of Sun Ra in Germantown, Philadelphia. In 2022, it was listed as a historic landmark in the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places.

Allen turned 100 on May 25, 2024.

On October 4, 2024, he released the first single &quot;African Sunset&quot; from his forthcoming debut album as a solo artist which was recorded a few days after his 100th birthday. The album &quot;New Dawn&quot; was released on February 14, 2025.

<text>Waterworld is a 1995 American post-apocalyptic action film directed by Kevin Reynolds and co-written by Peter Rader and David Twohy. It was based on Rader&#x27;s original 1986 screenplay and stars Kevin Costner, who also produced it with Charles Gordon and John Davis. It was distributed by Universal Pictures.

The setting of the film is in the distant future. The polar ice caps have completely melted, and the sea level has risen over , covering nearly all of the land. The plot of the film centers on a nameless antihero, &quot;The Mariner&quot;, a drifter who sails the Earth in his trimaran.

The most expensive film ever made at the time, &quot;Waterworld&quot; was released to mixed reviews from critics, who praised the futuristic setting and premise, but criticized the execution, including the characterization and acting performances. The film also was unable to recoup its massive budget at the box office despite being the ninth highest-grossing film of 1995; however, the film did later become profitable owing to video and other post-cinema sales. The film was nominated for an Academy Award in the category Best Sound at the 68th Academy Awards.

The film&#x27;s release was accompanied by a novelization, video games, and four themed attractions at Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal Studios Singapore, Universal Studios Japan, and Universal Studios Beijing called &quot;WaterWorld&quot;.

==Plot==

In 2500, sea level rises had swallowed every continent on Earth underwater. The remains of human civilization live on makeshift floating communities built out of scavenged materials known as atolls, having long forgotten about living on land. Rumors of a &quot;Dryland&quot; still exist, but it is considered a myth by most.

The Mariner, a lone drifter, arrives at an atoll on his trimaran to trade dirt, a rare commodity, for supplies. When the locals see that the Mariner is a mutant, with gills and webbed feet, several accost him and he kills one in self-defense. As a result, the Mariner is sentenced to be drowned in a tank of organic sludge. While the Mariner is trapped in the tank, the atoll is attacked by the Smokers, a formidable pirate gang that has been systematically raiding and destroying atolls. Helen, a strong-willed atoll resident, tries to escape on a gas balloon dirigible with her young ward Enola and inventor Gregor. However, Gregor accidentally departs with only himself onboard, stranding the two. Helen frees the Mariner on the condition he takes them with him. The Mariner skillfully fights his way out, damaging the Smokers&#x27; forces and causing an explosion that blinds its leader, Deacon, in one eye. The Mariner, Helen and Enola board the trimaran and escape.

After a brief skirmish with the Smoker&#x27;s scout seaplane, the trio encounters an unstable drifter whom the Mariner kills after a trade-gone-wrong, and a mutated shark the Mariner kills for food. Despite his initial reluctance and gruff attitude, the Mariner slowly warms up to his companions and has a bonding moment with Enola teaching her to swim.

After evading a trap set by the Smokers, the Mariner confronts Helen about their unusual persistence. She admits they are after Enola, for the supposed directions to Dryland tattooed on her back and demands to know where the Mariner collected his dirt. In a jury-rigged diving bell, he shows her the underwater remains of Denver, Colorado and the soil on the ocean&#x27;s floor, crushing her belief in Dryland. When they surface, they find that the Smokers have caught up. The Smokers capture Enola and try to kill Helen and the Mariner before the two dive underwater. The Smokers set the trimaran on fire and leave.

Sorting through the wreckage of his boat, the Mariner sees &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazines and compares their images to Enola&#x27;s doodles, realizing she was drawing Dryland objects. Gregor, having spotted the smoke from his dirigible, finds Helen and the Mariner and takes them to a new makeshift atoll. The Mariner takes a captured Smoker&#x27;s jet ski to chase down the Smokers&#x27; base of operations, the remains of the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot;, where they manage to manufacture fuel, ammunition and cigarettes. 

Deacon&#x27;s advisors struggle to decipher the tattoo. To keep his followers&#x27; minds off their dwindling resources, he bluffs that he has decoded the map on Enola&#x27;s back and orders them back to their stations to row. The Mariner infiltrates the &quot;&#x27;Dez,&quot; confronts the Deacon, threatening to ignite the oil reserves in the hold unless Enola is returned. The Deacon calls the Mariner&#x27;s bluff, knowing that it would destroy the ship, but to his shock, the Mariner drops a flare into the oil reservoir. The ship is engulfed in flames, and begins to sink. The Mariner rescues Enola, escaping via a rope from Gregor&#x27;s balloon with Helen and the Atoll Enforcer aboard. The Deacon fires on the balloon, shaking Enola into the ocean. As the Deacon and some of his men converge on her, the Mariner makes an impromptu bungee jump from the balloon to grab Enola before the Deacon and his men collide on their jet-skis, inducing an explosion, which kills the three.

Gregor later identifies Enola&#x27;s tattoo as coordinates with reversed directions. Following the map, the balloon party discover Dryland, covered with vegetation and wildlife. They also find a hut with the remains of Enola&#x27;s parents. The Mariner, feeling that he does not belong on Dryland, takes an old wooden catamaran from the island and departs, as Helen and Enola bid him farewell.

===Ulysses Cut===

The extended cut, dubbed the &quot;Ulysses Cut&quot;, has a runtime of 171 minutes and features scenes fleshing out the characters and settings. It identifies the Dryland as Mount Everest, and ends with Helen giving the Mariner the name Ulysses.

==Cast==
==Production==
Writer Peter Rader came up with the idea for &quot;Waterworld&quot; during a conversation with Brad Krevoy where they discussed creating a &quot;Mad Max&quot; rip-off. Rader wrote the initial script in 1986 but kept it shelved until 1989. Rader cited &quot;Mad Max&quot; as a direct inspiration for the film, while also citing various Old Testament stories and the story of Helen of Troy (with the main female character being named Helen in a direct reference). It is also widely believed that inspiration was taken from &quot;Freakwave&quot; by Peter Milligan and Brendan McCarthy, a &quot;Mad Max goes surfing&quot; comic strip first published by Pacific Comics in &quot;Vanguard Illustrated&quot; #1-3 (November 1983-March 1984), and continued by Eclipse Comics in &quot;Strange Days&quot; #1-3 (November 1984-April 1985). McCarthy himself had unsuccessfully tried to sell &quot;Freakwave&quot; as a movie in the early 1980s; he would go on to co-write &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; (2015).

After several rewrites, Kevin Costner and Kevin Reynolds joined the &quot;Waterworld&quot; production team in 1992. The film marked the fourth collaboration between Costner and Reynolds, who had previously worked together on &quot;Fandango&quot; (1985), &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; (1991), and &quot;Rapa-Nui&quot; (1994), the latter of which Costner co-produced but did not star in. &quot;Waterworld&quot; was co-written by David Twohy, who cited &quot;Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior&quot; as a major inspiration. Both films employed Dean Semler as director of photography.

During production, the film was plagued by a series of cost overruns and production setbacks. Universal initially authorized a budget of $100 million, which by mid-1994 had swollen to $135 million, with final costs reaching an estimated $175 million, a record sum for a film production at the time. Filming took place in a large artificial seawater enclosure similar to that used in the film &quot;Titanic&quot; two years later; it was located in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Hawaii. The final scene was filmed in Waipio Valley on the Big Island, also referred to as The Valley of Kings. Additional filming took place in Los Angeles, Huntington Beach, and Santa Catalina Island, and the Channel Islands of California. Before filming began, Steven Spielberg had warned Costner and Reynolds not to film on open water owing to his own production difficulties with &quot;Jaws&quot;. The production was hampered by difficulties in obtaining otherwise simple shots due to poor weather, safety concerns, and the camera crew being pushed out of position by waves. One of the floating sets sank in heavy seas, and had to be repaired. Eventually the production had to be extended by nearly three months, from 96 days to over 150. The state of Hawaii had more than $35 million added to its economy as a result of the colossal film production.

The production featured different types of personal watercraft, especially Kawasaki jet skis. Kevin Costner was on the set for 157 days, working six days a week. At one point, he nearly died when he got caught in a squall while tied to the mast of his trimaran. Professional surfer Laird Hamilton was Kevin Costner&#x27;s stunt double for many water scenes. Hamilton commuted to the set via jet ski.

Mark Isham&#x27;s score, which was not recorded for approximately 25 percent of the film and had only demos completed, was reportedly rejected by Costner because it was &quot;too ethnic and bleak&quot;, contrasting with the film&#x27;s futuristic and adventurous tone; Isham offered to try again but was not given the chance. James Newton Howard was brought in to write the new score. Joss Whedon flew out to the set to do last minute script rewrites and later described it as &quot;seven weeks of hell&quot;; the work boiled down to editing in Costner&#x27;s ideas without alteration.
Inspired by racing trimarans built by Jeanneau Advanced Technologies&#x27; multi-hull division, Lagoon, a custom yacht was designed by Marc Van Peteghem and Vincent Lauriot-Prevost and built in France by Lagoon. Two versions were built, a relatively standard racing trimaran for distance shots, and an effects-laden transforming trimaran for closeup shots. The first trimaran was launched on 2 April 1994, and surpassed in September of that year. The transforming version was initially a raft with a three-bladed egg-beater windmill. When certain levers were triggered, the windmill blades flattened, and a hidden mast is raised to full racing height. A boom previously hidden in the hull emerged, and two sails were automatically unfurled. Once the transformation was complete, this version could actually sail, though not as well as the dedicated racer. The transforming version is in private hands in San Diego, California. For many years, the racing version was kept on a lake at Universal Studios Florida, before being restored for use as a racing trimaran named &quot;Loe Real&quot;, which was (as of 2012) being offered for sale in San Diego.

Kevin Reynolds quit the film before its release, owing to heated battles with Costner over his creative decisions. Reynolds still received full credit as director. Despite their reported clashes, the director and star reunited almost two decades later for the History Channel miniseries &quot;Hatfields &amp; McCoys&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===

&quot;Waterworld&quot;&#x27;s reported budget was $172 million, and a total outlay of $235 million once marketing and distribution costs are factored in. Because of the runaway costs of the production, some critics dubbed it &quot;Fishtar&quot; and &quot;Kevin&#x27;s Gate&quot;, alluding to the flops &quot;Ishtar&quot; and &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;. 

The film debuted at the box office at No. 1. For its first weekend, &quot;Waterworld&quot; collected a total of $21.6 million. At the end of its run, the film grossed $88 million at the North American box office, and $176 million overseas, for a worldwide total of $264 million.

Taking into account the percentage of box office gross that theaters retain, which is generally up to half, &quot;Waterworld&quot; is considered a box office disappointment. After factoring in home video sales and TV broadcast rights among other revenue streams, it eventually became profitable.

===Critical response===

Contemporary reviews for the film were mixed. Roger Ebert gave &quot;Waterworld&quot; 2.5 stars out of 4 and said: &quot;The cost controversy aside, &quot;Waterworld&quot; is a decent futuristic action picture with some great sets, some intriguing ideas, and a few images that will stay with me. It could have been more, it could have been better, and it could have made me care about the characters. It&#x27;s one of those marginal pictures you&#x27;re not unhappy to have seen, but can&#x27;t quite recommend.&quot; Owen Gleiberman gave it a B in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. He commented that while its massive budget had paid off by genuinely creating the sensation of a world built on water, the film generally came off as a second-rate rip-off of &quot;The Road Warrior (Mad Max 2)&quot;, with weaker, slower-paced action sequences and less startling villains. He praised Costner&#x27;s performance, but found the film&#x27;s environmental message pretentious. James Berardinelli of Reelviews Movie Reviews was one of the film&#x27;s few supporters, calling it &quot;one of Hollywood&#x27;s most lavish features to date&quot;. He wrote: &quot;Although the storyline isn&#x27;t all that invigorating, the action is, and that&#x27;s what saves &quot;Waterworld&quot;. In the tradition of the old Westerns and Mel Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Mad Max&quot; flicks, this film provides good escapist fun. Everyone behind the scenes did their part with aplomb, and the result is a feast for the eyes and ears.&quot; Mick LaSalle, reviewing the film the week of its release on home video, argued that it did not deserve some of its more negative reviews, since &quot;despite its confused impulses and occasional slow spots, &quot;Waterworld&quot;... has an elusive, appealing spirit that holds up for more than two hours. It&#x27;s a genuine vault at greatness that misses the mark -- but survives.&quot; He commented that while the film succeeds at its high ambitions for isolated moments, the clash between its earnest ambition and intrusive flashiness makes it generally fall short of its reach.

On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 47% based on 66 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Though it suffered from toxic buzz at the time of its release, &quot;Waterworld&quot; is ultimately an ambitious misfire: an extravagant sci-fi flick with some decent moments and a lot of silly ones.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In a 2020 retrospective, Ben Child of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it as &quot;a perfectly watchable sci-fi cult classic&quot; that deserves reappraisal. He acknowledged that much of the plot was illogical and absurd and some of the action set-pieces &quot;preposterously ambitious&quot;, but argued that both of them offer excitement and B-movie charm.

===Cast and director&#x27;s reception===
Kevin Costner said he&#x27;s very fond of the film: &quot;It stands up as a really exotic, cool movie. I mean, it was flawed — for sure. But, overall, it&#x27;s a very inventive, cool movie. It&#x27;s pretty robust.&quot; Dennis Hopper also enjoyed it, saying &quot;I thought &quot;Waterworld&quot; got a bad name for itself in the United States, but it did really well in Europe and Asia. I think the studio sort of shot themselves in the foot by announcing it was so over budget, blah blah blah, it&#x27;s going to be a failure... All this came out before we released it in the States. But I enjoyed it.&quot; In retrospect, Director Kevin Reynolds said: &quot;My own personal take on the picture is that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better, any worse than most summer blockbusters, it&#x27;s somewhere in the middle. I think yeah, it&#x27;s certainly got its faults, but I think, you know, on another level I think it works quite well compared to some of the other big films. But by the end, people…they wanted it to be a disaster.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Other media==
===Home media===
&quot;Waterworld&quot; was released on VHS and LaserDisc on January 23, 1996. On September 9, 1997, it debuted on a THX certified widescreen VHS release. The film was then released on DVD on December 9, 1997, on Blu-ray on October 20, 2009, and on 4K Blu-ray on July 9, 2019.

===Novelization===
A novelization was written by Max Allan Collins and published by Arrow Books. It goes into greater detail regarding the world of the film.

===Comic books===
A sequel comic book four-issue mini-series entitled &quot;Waterworld: Children of Leviathan&quot;, drawn by Kevin Kobasic, was released by Acclaim Comics in 1997. Kevin Costner did not permit his likeness to be used for the comics, so the Mariner looks different. The story reveals some of the Mariner&#x27;s back-story as he gathers clues about where he came from and why he is different. The comic expands on the possible cause of the melting of the polar ice caps and worldwide flood, and introduces a new villain, &quot;Leviathan&quot;, who supplied the Deacon&#x27;s Smoker organization. The comic hints at the possibility that the Mariner&#x27;s mutation may not be caused by evolution but by genetic engineering and that his origins may be linked to those of the &quot;Sea Eater&quot;, the sea monster seen during the fishing scene in the film.

===Video games===
Video games based on the film were released for the Super NES, Game Boy, Virtual Boy, and PC. There was to be a release for the Genesis, but it was canceled and was only available on the Sega Channel. A Sega Saturn version of the game was also planned, and development was completed, but like its Genesis counterpart it was cancelled prior to release. The Super NES and Game Boy releases were only available in the United Kingdom and Australia. While the Super NES and Virtual Boy versions were released by Ocean Software, the PC version was released by Interplay. The Virtual Boy version of the game was the only movie licensed game for the system.

In the episode of The Simpsons titled The Springfield Files, Milhouse Van Houten is seen playing a fictional video game called &quot;Kevin Costner&#x27;s Waterworld&quot;. After depositing 40 quarters ($10 USD), the character takes two steps before a game over screen appears and a voice (implied to be Costner) says &quot;Game over, please deposit forty quarters.&quot; In 2022, a developer using the handle &quot;Macaw45&quot; made a full length video game adaptation of the fictional game, which involves the player fighting characters such as the Nord and Deacon, and inserting 40 quarters into the arcade machine each time the player dies. 

===Pinball===
The film was released as a pinball machine in 1995 by Gottlieb Amusements (later Premier, both now defunct).

===Theme park attraction===

There are attractions at Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal Studios Japan, Universal Studios Singapore, and Universal Studios Beijing based on the film. The show&#x27;s plot takes place after the film, as Helen returns to the Atoll with proof of Dryland, only to find herself followed by the Deacon, who survived the events of the film. The Mariner arrives after him, defeats the Deacon and takes Helen back to Dryland.

===TV series===
In July 2021, it was announced Universal Cable Productions was in early development on a follow-up TV series to be directed by Dan Trachtenberg.

<text>Royal Air Force Burtonwood (or RAF Burtonwood) is a former Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces base that was located in Burtonwood, Northwest of Warrington in Cheshire, England. The base was opened in 1940 in response to World War II by the RAF and in 1942 it was transferred to the United States of America for war operations.

The base was home to 18,000 American servicemen at the end of the war. In 1946 the base was transferred back to the United Kingdom however United States operations continued. The base officially closed in 1991 and since then the runway and most of the associated buildings have been demolished. RAF Burtonwood Heritage Centre was opened on part of the former base and focuses on the lives of the servicemen, the war and the airplanes at the base.

== Overview ==

Burtonwood airfield was opened on 1 January 1940 as a servicing and storage centre for modifying British aircraft. It was operated by No. 37 Maintenance Unit RAF until June 1942.

==United States Army Air Forces use==
The facility was transferred to the United States Army Air Forces in June 1942 to become a servicing centre for the United States Eighth, Ninth, Twelfth and Fifteenth Air Forces aircraft. Burtonwood was also known as Base Air Depot 1 (BAD 1), although an RAF presence continued in the form of the RAF Police who maintained security on the site until the mid-1960s.

Burtonwood was the largest airfield in Europe during the war with the most USAAF personnel and aircraft maintenance facilities. The roar of the engines in the test beds could be heard for miles around, especially at night. By the end of the war 18,000 servicemen were stationed at Burtonwood.

According to some sources Burtonwood was placed strategically so that it was out of range of Luftwaffe bombers, but this is not true, as several Nazi air raids were made on the facility. In any case the Luftwaffe bombed Belfast in 1941, which was much further away from Occupied Europe than Burtonwood. During their leave periods, American servicemen from Burtonwood virtually took over the centre of nearby Warrington.

USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Burtonwood were:
* 27th Air Transport Group (302d Transport Wing, VIII Air Force Service Command)
: 310th, 311th, 312th Ferry Squadrons; 320th, 321st Air Transport Squadrons
* 325th Service Group (US Strategic Air Forces Service Command)
: 328th, 343d Service Squadron; HHS 325th Service Group
* 401st Air Depot (US Strategic Air Forces Service Command)
: HHS 401st Air Depot
* Base Air Depot 1, US Strategic Air Forces
: Maintenance Division; Hq, Base Air Depot Area, US Strategic Air Forces
* 18th Weather Squadron
* 91st Station Complement Squadron
* 97th Airdrome Squadron
* 1518th Quartermaster Battalion
* 494th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Gun Battalion
* 1109th Quartermaster Company
* 1289th and 890th Military Police Companies
* 1716th Ordnance Medium Maintenance Company
* 1985th, 2073d, 2097th, 2188th, 2192d, 2194th, 2224th Quartermaster Truck Companies
* 892nd Signal Depot Company
* 2000th and 2001st Engineer Fire Fighting Platoons
* 20th Medical Supply Platoon
* 14th Veterinary Section 
* 55th Field Hospital

===Sub-stations===
The USAAF units based here also supported a number of sub-sites spread across the United Kingdom.

==United States Air Force use==

When hostilities ended, control of Burtonwood was returned to the RAF in June 1946 and became an equipment depot operated by No 276 Maintenance Unit.

In November 1946 six B-29 Superfortress bombers from the USAAF Strategic Air Command 43d Bombardment Group were sent to Burtonwood, and from there to various bases in West Germany as a &quot;training deployment&quot;. In May 1947 additional B-29s were deployed to Burtonwood to keep up the presence of a training programme. This so-called training programme was in fact a cover story, intended to conceal their actual mission i.e. to have a strategic air force permanently stationed in Europe. The American presence continued with an echelon of United States Air Force personnel using the facility as a maintenance base for C-54 Skymasters used during the Berlin Airlift.

On 7 November 1953 the USAF 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron began operating from the base flying initially the WB-29 then WB-50D Superfortress, having been transferred from Kindley Field, Bermuda. The squadron was assigned to collecting weather data that was transmitted to weather stations for use in preparing forecasts required for the Air Force Military Air Transport Service (MATS) and the US Weather Bureau. The squadron was transferred to RAF Alconbury in Cambridgeshire on 26 April 1959.

MATS also used Burtonwood as a cargo and passenger transport facility until 1958, when its operations were moved to RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk. Transatlantic transport flights through the base were operated by Douglas C-54, Douglas C-118, Douglas C-124, Douglas C-133 Cargomaster and Lockheed C-130 aircraft. During the 1950s, European-based USAF aircraft were overhauled or modified at Burtonwood, including Republic F-84 Thunderjets, F-84F Thunderstreaks and North American F-86 Sabres.

A small village was built, with its own school and shop, to house the many US servicemen. The buildings were known as &quot;Tobacco Houses&quot;, because the lease for the land was paid with American tobacco.

Major USAF use of Burtonwood ended in April 1959 when the flightline was closed although some use of the runway was made by gliders of the RAF Air Training Corps (635 Gliding School ran weekend training throughout the year and longer courses during school holidays). For several years the facility fell into disuse and the USAF returned the station to the Ministry of Defence in 1965. During the 1970s the US Army continued to use Burtonwood for operations of transiting DHC-1 Beavers and there was usually at least one Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopter based there, making regular appearances at Liverpool (Speke) airport in the early 1970s.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the area was used extensively by Territorial Army and Cadet units for training purposes. The site was also used by the MoD for civil contingency and emergency planning exercises, EOD exercises for Police as well as Fire and Rescue training.

In 2009 the final bunkers were demolished. However, the scars of the bunkers and runways can still be seen from the M62 motorway. As of 2015 new construction has obliterated the former traces of the bunkers. One building still remains and is in use (as of 2008) from the former base, the Royal Mail building.

== African-Americans based in Burtonwood ==
There were approximately 46,000 American GIs in Britain during the early 50s, largely based in East Anglia and at Burtonwood. During this period there were growing anxieties about female sexuality, and &#x27;public concern became especially pronounced after the arrival of American troops during the summer and autumn of 1942&#x27;. There was increased attention to the behaviour of young girls that would loiter around the army bases like Burtonwood and spend time with the American troops. Illegitimacy rates went up during the war years and there was great social concern about preserving the British national identity. However, this became more of an issue when these young women were involved in relationships with black American soldiers. Women were given the central role and criticised for their sexual impropriety when the soldier was white; however, when the relationship involved an African-American soldier, the blame and criticism was shifted to the man. Women were portrayed as vulnerable to these men and there were social concerns about how &quot;half-caste&quot; babies &#x27;threatened to blur the racial lineaments of British national identity.&#x27;

Venessa Baird, born in April 1958 to a Liverpudlian mother and Black GI based at Burtonwood airfield, is one of many mixed-race babies that came of the interracial relationships between British women and African-American troops during World War II. Baird&#x27;s father did not know about her birth, and her mother&#x27;s father was extremely disapproving, so Baird&#x27;s mother and grandmother left Liverpool and moved to Norwich where they had friends in relationships with African American at Lakenheath and Mildenhall. Baird explains how there was a small and accepting community at USAF bases and the women that had met African-American men were good friends and formed a &#x27;large extended family&#x27; with their mixed-race children.

== United States Army use ==
The U.S. Department of Defense returned to Burtonwood in 1966 when France withdrew its military support for NATO. Burtonwood was used as a receiving depot for USAF and United States Army equipment and supplies being withdrawn from their former French NATO facilities. Afterwards, the US Army took over the base and renamed it Burtonwood Army Depot.

The Army developed Burtonwood into a storage and forward supply depot operated by the 47th Support Group. The main warehouse was described as the largest building under a single roof in Europe. The idea was that in the event of an emergency, U.S. troops in the USA that were earmarked for NATO service in Europe would fly over and pick up their kit from Burtonwood before going on to the battle front. It was never tested for this eventuality, although the base provided service functions for the 1991 Gulf War.

When the Cold War ended, Burtonwood Army Depot was declared excess to NATO requirements and was closed in June 1994.

== Runways ==
The M62 motorway bisects the airfield in an east–west direction over the former main runway 09/27. Before junction 8 was made, the last part of this runway was still visible, but is now covered by Junction 8. Part of the airfield is also occupied by the motorway Welcome Break Burtonwood service station. The other two runways had orientation 03/21 and 14/32.

==Later use==
In late 2008 and early 2009 the remaining buildings were demolished over four months (the storage bunkers pictured in this article). This left some of the World War II aircraft hardstands, part of the old airfield perimeter track, and the northwest end of a secondary runway still visible.

During 2016 the rest of the airfield was dismantled and a new industrial estate was built on its former aerodrome. The main road through the new estate is called Skyline Drive.

The Royal Mail building is still in use (as of 2008) and dates back to when it was on the base and having been built prior to 1945. It is the only building left from the base still standing.

==RAF Burtonwood Heritage Centre==

A museum and heritage centre exists on part of the former site. The centre is located at the Gulliver&#x27;s World theme park in Warrington.
There are five exhibit areas focussing on the living history of Burtonwood; GI brides; planes of RAF Burtonwood; entertainment and personal stories; and everyday life. The planes exhibited are the B-17 Flying Fortress, P-47 Thunderbolt and the B-29 Super Fortress. There is also a selection of Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp series engines.

<text>General Sir James Shaw Kennedy, (born James Shaw; 13 October 1788 – 30 May 1865) was a British soldier and military writer.

==Life==
===Early life===
The son of Captain John Shaw, a former captain in the 76th Highlanders, of Dalton, Kirkcudbrightshire, James was educated at Ayr Academy. He was commissioned into the 43rd (Monmouthshire) Light Infantry in 1805, joining the regiment at Hythe, Kent where it was training under Sir John Moore. He first saw service in the Copenhagen Expedition of 1807 as a lieutenant.

===The Peninsula===
Under Sir David Baird Shaw took part in the Corunna Campaign. In the retreat from Corunna, led by Sir John Moore, Shaw and the 43rd fought with the rearguard to the army. On his return to England he suffered from a severe fever from which he never fully recovered. In May 1809, Shaw returned to the Peninsula with the 43rd and took part in the 250-mile march from Lisbon to Talavera where he became adjutant of his now famous regiment at the Battle of Talavera.

As Robert Craufurd&#x27;s aide-de-camp during 1809 and 1810, Shaw was on the staff of the Light Division at the Coa and the Agueda, and, with William Campbell, prepared and edited the &quot;Standing Orders of the Light Division&quot; (printed in Home&#x27;s &quot;Précis of Modern Tactics&quot;, pp. 257–277). He was wounded at Almeida in 1810, but rejoined Craufurd at the end of 1811 and was with his chief at the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812. At the great assault of 19 January, Shaw carried his general, mortally wounded, from the crest of the glacis and later conveyed Wellington&#x27;s summons to surrender to the French governor. 

At Badajoz, now once more with the 43rd, he displayed, at the lesser breach, a gallantry which furnished his brother officer William Napier with the theme of one of his most glorious descriptive passages. At the siege and the Battle of Salamanca, in the retreat from Burgos, Shaw, still a subaltern, distinguished himself and in July 1812, was promoted to captain. At the end of the year, he had to return to England due to ill health. In April 1813, Shaw joined the senior department of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

===Waterloo===
He later returned to active service, and at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815, he was assistant quartermaster-general with the Third Division of Charles Alten. During the late afternoon of 18 June that Division had to defend its position against repeated French cavalry charges and Shaw was struck in the side, putting him out of action for a period. During the battle, one of his horses was killed and another wounded under him. Shaw&#x27;s reconnoitring skill and tactical judgment was of the greatest assistance to Alten and to Wellington, who promoted him brevet major in July the same year.

His famous &quot;Notes on Waterloo&quot; (with an appendix giving a &quot;Plan for the defence of Canada&quot;) would be published fifty years after the battle, though he wrote it in 1863. It was the first work to divide the battle into five distinct but interrelated parts: a framework of the battle which was later to be used by other historians.

===Calais and home service===
During the Allied army&#x27;s occupation of France Shaw was commandant of Calais from 1815 to 1818, receiving the new Waterloo Medal in 1816 and going on half-pay on 25 March 1817. On his return to England, he was employed as a staff officer in the north, in which role he was called upon to deal with the Manchester riots of 1819. He was also made a brevet lieutenant-colonel in January 1819.

In 1820 he married Mary Primrose Kennedy of Kirkmichael at Ayr, with whom he later had one son and two daughters:
*Wilhelmina Shaw, who died young
*Henrietta Shaw Kennedy, who married Primrose W. Kennedy of Drumellan;
*John Shaw Kennedy (d 1905), laird of Kirkmichael

===Ireland and north-west England===
He remained off active service until 1826 when he was appointed assistant adjutant-general in Belfast under the viceregality of Richard Wellesley (Wellington&#x27;s elder brother). However, within less than a year he transferred to Manchester where he dealt with several outbreaks of civil disorder originating in the widespread dissatisfaction with working conditions. Shaw in 1829 declined Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s offer of the position of first commissioner of the newly formed Metropolitan Police. 

He left Manchester to become inspector-general of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) from 1836 to 1838, where he raised and organized a force of 8000 men. Also in 1836 Thomas Mitchell named Shaw River (Victoria) in Victoria, after him. 

After Ireland Shaw Kennedy led a retired country life for ten years, before being called upon to command an army force at Liverpool to face the Chartist movement. Soon after his Liverpool command he was offered a command in Ireland and then the governorship of Mauritius, but he had to decline both due to ill-health. A little later he briefly took up an offer of the Scottish command, but was again forced to retire due to ill health. 

===Later years===
In 1852, Sir William Napier, referring to Shaw Kennedy, said that, &quot;He is, perhaps, with the exception of Lord Seaton, the very ablest officer in the service&quot;. Shaw Kennedy was appointed C.B. in July 1838, and K.C.B. in 1863. On its institution in 1848 he was also awarded the Military General Service Medal, often known as the Peninsular silver medal, with three clasps. Shaw Kennedy was promoted to lieutenant-general in June 1854, and in August of the same year, he became colonel of the 47th Foot. 

In 1859 Shaw Kennedy wrote an essay on &quot;The Defence of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; and in 1860 a brief autobiography. He was promoted to full general in August 1862 and died in Bath, Somerset on 30 May 1865, following a long-standing liver complaint.

<text>Jerrell C. Jones (born March 28, 1986), better known by his stage name J-Kwon, is an American rapper from St. Louis, Missouri. He signed with Jermaine Dupri&#x27;s So So Def Recordings, an imprint of Arista Records to release his 2004 single &quot;Tipsy,&quot; which peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It served as lead single for his debut studio album &quot;Hood Hop&quot; (2004), which peaked at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spawned the single &quot;You &amp; Me&quot; (featuring Sadiyahh). The following year, he guest appeared alongside Mike Jones on labelmate Bow Wow&#x27;s single, &quot;Fresh Azimiz&quot;, which peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Life and career==
At age 12, Jones was expelled from his home for allegedly dealing drugs. He first rose to stardom with the single &quot;Tipsy&quot; from his 2004 album &quot;Hood Hop&quot;, which peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on April 17, 2004, after 14 weeks on the chart. The song peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Tipsy&quot; also performed well globally, peaking within the top ten of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Other singles included &quot;You &amp; Me&quot; with Sadiyyah and &quot;Hood Hop.&quot;

For the 2005 film &quot;&quot;, J-Kwon performed the single &quot;Get XXX&#x27;d&quot; with Petey Pablo and Ebony Eyez. J-Kwon began working on the follow-up to &quot;Hood Hop&quot;, &quot;Louisville Slugger&quot;, that same year. He collaborated with comedian Andy Milonakis in &quot;Like Dis&quot;, to promote &quot;The Andy Milonakis Show&quot;, and appeared on Bow Wow&#x27;s single &quot;Fresh Azimiz&quot;. In 2008, he released a single &quot;Boo Boo&quot; through his own label Hood Hop Music with album &quot;Hood Hop 2&quot; following the next year exclusively for digital download. Follow-up &quot;Hood Hop 2.5&quot; was released on CD on July 28, 2009. Its first official single was &quot;Louie Bounce (I Smacked Nikki)&quot;.

In March 2010, J-Kwon&#x27;s record label, Gracie Entertainment, said that he had been missing since early February 2010. Later the same month, MTV News reported that he had been in touch with the record label, confirming he was alive and well.

J-Kwon released his fourth studio album on March 23, 2010, entitled &quot;J-Kwon&quot;.

In June 2013, he made a diss track titled &quot;Pushing the Odds&quot; produced by H Snow Beatz towards Odd Future and Pusha T after previous disses from both.

<text>Hoobastank (sometimes stylized as h∞bastank, and originally known as Hoobustank) is an American rock band formed in 1994 in Agoura Hills, California, by lead vocalist Doug Robb, guitarist Dan Estrin, drummer Chris Hesse, and original bassist Markku Lappalainen. They were signed to Island Records from 2001 to 2012 and have released six albums and one extended play to date. Their most recent album, &quot;Push Pull&quot;, was released in May 2018. They have sold 10 million albums worldwide.

==History==
===Early career (1994–2000)===
Vocalist Doug Robb had known guitarist Dan Estrin for some time before competing against him in a high school battle of the bands competition and subsequently, they decided to form a band. They then recruited Markku Lappalainen and Chris Hesse to form Hoobastank.

The band has provided a variety of explanations for the origin of the band&#x27;s unusual name, and it is unclear where it originated from. Claims have included that it is a mispronunciation of a German street, slang for someone who owns many sneakers, or a word the band came up with while they were &quot;joking around.&quot;

Hoobastank started playing gigs at the local venue Cobalt Cafe along with Incubus and Linkin Park. They recorded their first full-length self-released album in 1998 called &quot;They Sure Don&#x27;t Make Basketball Shorts Like They Used To&quot;, which features a saxophone section headed by Jeremy Wasser, who executive produced the album and recorded the &quot;Summer Romance&quot; saxophone solo on Incubus&#x27; &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; album. The Incubus connections continued with Fourth Street Recording&#x27;s music producer Jim Wirt and logos and visual design by Brett Spivey.

By this stage, Hoobastank had developed a strong reputation in Southern California. This attracted interest from Island Records, who subsequently signed the band in 2000. At the time of signing, the band had completed a second full-length album, titled &quot;Forward&quot;, also featuring Jeremy Wasser. However, the band felt that the direction they were heading in would work best without a sax, so Wasser departed the band and the album was shelved. A few tracks were rerecorded for release on the band&#x27;s self-titled 2001 release. The original recordings from the &quot;Forward&quot; sessions made their way to the Internet via peer to peer sites in late 2001.

===&quot;Hoobastank&quot; (2001–2002)===
Hoobastank released their self-titled debut album in November 2001. The first single was &quot;Crawling in the Dark&quot;, which was a breakthrough hit, reaching No. 68 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, No. 3 on the Modern Rock chart, No. 7 on the Mainstream Rock chart and No. 1 on an MP3.com download chart in early 2002. Also, the song was featured in the 2002 inline skating game, &quot;Aggressive Inline&quot;, appearing on the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and GameCube consoles. The second single &quot;Running Away&quot; was even more successful, reaching No. 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, No. 2 on the Modern Rock chart, No. 9 on the Mainstream Rock chart and No. 3 on the MP3.com download chart. The &quot;Hoobastank&quot; album went Platinum due to these hit singles and reached No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts and No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseeker chart.

The album achieved recognition internationally with the band touring in Europe and Asia in support of the record. &quot;Remember Me&quot;, the third single released from this album, was a moderate hit, reaching No. 23 on the Modern Rock charts. The band made a song titled &quot;Losing My Grip&quot; for the soundtrack of the movie &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;.

===&quot;The Reason&quot; (2003–2005)===
In early 2003, the group contributed the song &quot;Right Before Your Eyes&quot; to &quot;&quot;. The band then entered the studio with producer Howard Benson. Recording was disrupted for a month when Dan Estrin was seriously injured in a minibike accident in August. Estrin had recovered by October and the band headed off on a Nokia Unwired Tour with The All-American Rejects and Ozomatli in November.

Their second album &quot;The Reason&quot; was released in December 2003. The single &quot;Out of Control&quot; was made available for download on the band&#x27;s website. Doug Robb said on the band&#x27;s website: &quot;A lot of it is about asking questions or questioning all that people see. It&#x27;s not all about religion. &quot;Out of Control&quot; is about that and about opening your eyes after being blinded by being devoted to anything.&quot; &quot;Same Direction&quot; would reach No. 9 on the US Modern Rock chart, No. 16 on the Mainstream Rock chart and No. 16 on a composite World Modern Rock chart (based on the US, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Canada, and Australia). A year later, the &quot;Let It Out&quot; DVD collected the band&#x27;s videos. &quot;The Reason&quot; was put to a popular music video on Tangle.

&quot;The Reason&quot; was released as a single in the first half of 2004. It became a hit, reaching No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, No. 1 on the US and World Modern Rock charts, No. 10 in Australia, No. 12 in the United Kingdom and No. 15 in Germany. In Canada, it spent 21 weeks at the top, setting a new record for most weeks at No. 1. Meanwhile, in the United States, the album reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart.

The band&#x27;s international profile was increased by a support slot on Linkin Park&#x27;s &quot;Meteora&quot; world tour in early 2004.

===&quot;Every Man for Himself&quot; (2006–2007)===
Their third album &quot;Every Man for Himself&quot; was released in May 2006 and debuted at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. Three singles, &quot;If I Were You&quot;, &quot;Inside of You&quot;, and &quot;Born to Lead&quot;, were released. Another single, &quot;If Only&quot;, was planned to be released but was canceled for unknown reasons, possibly because of the low chart achievements of the first three singles. Despite this, the album has been certified Gold in the United States.

On a 2005 co-headlining tour with Velvet Revolver, the band received a chilly reception from some audiences and rumors of a feud between Robb and Velvet Revolver frontman Scott Weiland were soon filling Internet message boards. &quot;If I Were You&quot; from &quot;Every Man for Himself&quot; addressed the whole affair. Robb later said in an interview with MTV News online that he has nothing against Scott Weiland or any other member of Velvet Revolver.

===&quot;For(N)ever&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot; (2008–2009)===
In October 2007, Robb posted on the official Hoobastank message boards and said that they have &quot;set the bar very very high for this next CD&quot; and that they have &quot;more ideas going into this CD than ever before&quot;. On June 2, 2008, Robb posted an update on their temporary website, announcing that the recording process of their upcoming album was almost done and to expect a release date within a couple of weeks. On September 19, Robb posted a Myspace bulletin announcing that the &quot;new Hoobastank album is nearly done&quot;.

The first single from the album, &quot;My Turn&quot;, premiered on radio October 13, 2008. The album &quot;For(N)ever&quot; was released on January 27, 2009, as announced by Doug Robb in a blog entry on the band&#x27;s official website. The song was featured as the theme song for TNA Wrestling&#x27;s Destination X 2009 Pay Per View.

On April 20, 2010, a Vanessa Amorosi fan website revealed details of a collaboration between Hoobastank and the Australian singer, a duet version of &quot;The Letter&quot;. On August 5, it was confirmed that there was another version of the song on Universal International. This one was a duet between Hoobastank and the American-Japanese singer, lyricist, actress and model Anna Tsuchiya. The website, VanessaAmorosi.net, also provided the duet version to be streamed in full for the first time. The music video was shot in Los Angeles at Lacy Street Studio with director Paul Brown. The video and single was serviced to Australian media on May 4. While the single was released in Australia on June 19, 2009, featuring Vanessa Amorosi, the version of the song featuring Anna Tsuchiya appears on the deluxe edition of Hoobastank&#x27;s greatest hits album &quot;The Greatest Hits: Don&#x27;t Touch My Moustache&quot;.

&quot;For(N)ever&quot; had its Australian release on June 26.

The best of album &quot;The Greatest Hits: Don&#x27;t Touch My Moustache&quot; was released on August 5, through Universal Records in Japan. The Deluxe Edition&#x27;s tracks were selected from their first four albums by Hoobastank fans on the band&#x27;s official record label website.

Hoobastank was a support band on Creed&#x27;s 2009 reunion tour.

===&quot;Is This the Day?&quot; (2009–2010)===
Hoobastank announced on Twitter that they were recording an acoustic album on September 2, 2009.

On October 30, Hoobastank covered the song &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; for Halloween and a music video was released on Hoobastank&#x27;s official YouTube channel.

The band released the live album &quot;Live from the Wiltern&quot; in December 8, which was available exclusively through iTunes.

Hoobastank released a new song entitled &quot;We Are One&quot; on January 19, 2010, as part of a compilation from Music for Relief in support of the Haiti earthquake crisis.

On February 12, Hoobastank released a new song entitled &quot;Never Be Here Again&quot; as part of the &quot;AT&amp;T Team USA Soundtrack&quot;.

In May, the band announced that they would be performing an acoustic live tour at several places in Japan. They released an acoustic album titled &quot;Is This the Day?&quot; on August 4, 2010, in Japan, but it has yet to be released in the United States.

===&quot;Fight or Flight&quot; (2011–2015)===
On April 5, 2012, the band announced on Twitter that their new album&#x27;s name was to be titled &quot;Fight or Flight&quot;. On May 3, the band revealed the first single &quot;This Is Gonna Hurt&quot;. The album was released on September 11, 2012.

To promote the album, two more singles, &quot;Can You Save Me?&quot; and &quot;Incomplete&quot;, accompanied by a touring music video and a lyric video respectively, were released.

On August 2, 2013, former member Jeremy Wasser made a one-off appearance on Sunset Strip Music Festival at Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood, California. He played sax with the band in songs &quot;Earthsick&quot; and &quot;Can I Buy You A Drink?&quot; from &quot;They Sure Don&#x27;t Make Basketball Shorts Like They Used To&quot;.

===&quot;Push Pull&quot; (2016–present)===

In November 2016, the band began recording for their sixth studio album. They began working with producer Matt Wallace as posted by members Doug Robb and Dan Estrin on Facebook and Instagram. On January 28, 2017, Doug Robb stated on Twitter that &quot;Studio&#x27;s done. New music coming&quot;.

Doug Robb provided the lyrics and vocals for &quot;Fist Bump&quot;, the theme song of the 2017 video game &quot;Sonic Forces&quot;. On October 19, 2017, the band had signed with Napalm Records. They also announced that the sixth studio album is finished and expected to be released in the first half of 2018.

On March 29, 2018, Hoobastank announced their next album &quot;Push Pull&quot;. It was released worldwide on May 25, along with the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;More Beautiful&quot;.

Throughout 2018, the band went on their tour to commemorate the 15th anniversary of their 2003 album &quot;The Reason&quot;, playing the album in its entirety. On August 16, 2019, Hoobastank announced that they would be re-releasing the album on October 4 with a vinyl release and a digital version with bonus tracks.

In September 2022, a documentary series about the making of their self-titled debut studio album was released, in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the album. It was uploaded on their official YouTube channel.

==Musical style and influences==
Hoobastank has been categorized under genres such as post-grunge, alternative rock, hard rock, and nu metal. On their early independent releases, the band used a funk metal and ska punk sound and had a saxophonist in the band. On their major-label, self-titled, debut album, the band&#x27;s sound changed; they removed their saxophonist and became a four-piece rock band, using an alternative rock sound. The band&#x27;s sound matured in their second album, &quot;The Reason&quot;, and became more melodic. Doug Robb has cited Faith No More vocalist Mike Patton as being one of his main influences. In a 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Robb commented that, &quot;Faith No More is my favorite band of all time. I listen to those records constantly.&quot;

<text>Fiddler&#x27;s Ferry power station is a decommissioned coal fired power station in the Borough of Warrington, Cheshire, England. Opened in 1971, the station had a generating capacity of 1,989 megawatts and took water from the River Mersey. After privatisation in 1990, the station was operated by various companies, and from 2004 to 2022 by SSE Thermal. The power station closed on 31 March 2020. The site was acquired by Peel NRE in July 2022.

With four of its original eight high cooling towers still standing and its high chimney, the station is a prominent local landmark and can be seen from as far away as the Peak District and the Pennines. The power station&#x27;s four northernmost cooling towers were demolished on 3 December 2023, with the remaining four southernmost towers set to be demolished at a later date.

==History==
One of the Hinton Heavies, an application to build Fiddler&#x27;s Ferry power station was proposed in 1962. The civil works were built by Taylor Woodrow Construction, the cooling towers by Yorkshire Hennibique, the chimney by Tileman and the steelwork for the main buildings by the Cleveland Bridge Company between 1964 and 1971, and came into full operation in 1973.

There were eight cooling towers arranged in two groups of four located to the north and south of the main building. There is a single chimney located to the east of the main building. One of the station&#x27;s cooling towers collapsed in high winds on 13 January 1984 and was rebuilt. When it was built, the station mainly burned coal mined in the South Yorkshire Coalfield and transported across the Pennines on the Manchester–Sheffield–Wath electric railway. In later years, the coal was imported.

Between 2006 and 2008, Fiddler&#x27;s Ferry was fitted with a Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) plant to reduce the emissions of sulphur by 94%, meeting the European Large Combustion Plant Directive. In 2010, the station was being considered for the installation of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment. This would reduce the station&#x27;s emissions of nitrogen oxides, to meet the requirements of the Industrial Emissions (Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control) Directive. The SCR technology would replace the Separated Over Fire Air (SOFA) technology which was used in the station. The SCR equipment was ultimately not fitted, due to uncertainty over the future of the plant.

The station was built by the Central Electricity Generating Board but was transferred to Powergen after privatisation of the UK&#x27;s electricity industry in 1990. Fiddler&#x27;s Ferry, along with the Ferrybridge power stations in Yorkshire, was then sold to Edison Mission Energy in 1999. They were subsequently sold on to AEP Energy Services in 2001, and both were sold again in July 2004 to SSE Thermal for £136 million.

Between 2001 and 2011 the station was featured in the opening and closing titles and was in some background scenes of the BBC comedy series &quot;Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps&quot;.

==In operation==

The station generated electricity using four 500 MW generating sets and consumed 195 million litres of water daily from the River Mersey. At full capacity, 16,000 tonnes of coal were burned each day. It also burned biofuels together with the coal. It used SOFA technology to control nitrogen oxide emissions and FGD to reduce the emission of sulphur.

The station was supplied with coal via a freight-only rail line between Warrington and Widnes, running along the banks of the River Mersey. Rail facilities include an east-facing junction on the mainline controlled by a signal box, two hopper approach tracks, gross-weight and tare-weight weighbridges, coal track hoppers, a fly ash siding, a gypsum loading plant and a control building.

==Closure==
On 18 November 2015, Amber Rudd, the then Minister in charge of the Department of Energy and Climate Change, proposed that the UK&#x27;s remaining coal-fired power stations will be shut by 2025 with their use restricted by 2023. SSE announced in February 2016 that it intended to close three of the four generating units at the plant by 1 April 2016. However, it secured a 12-month contract in April 2016 and they stayed open.

In March 2017, the power station secured a further short-term contract to provide electricity until September 2018. At this point, the power station employed 160 people, down from 213 the previous year. In February 2018, the station had agreements to supply electricity until September 2019. One unit closed in 2019, reducing capacity to 1.51 GW.

In June 2019, SSE announced that the power station would be permanently turned off and decommissioned by 31 March 2020. On 31 March 2020, the plant was desynchronized from the National Grid, ending nearly 50 years of electricity generation.

Demolition of the station was due to begin in 2020 and was forecast to take up to seven years. The land upon which it sits will be redeveloped, with Warrington Borough Council stating it had designated the land as an employment site.

In September 2020, the operator SSE was fined £2 million by energy regulator the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, after it concluded that SSE did not inform energy traders that it had secured a new contract to remain open in March 2016, and had risked undermining confidence in the energy market. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, work on the site did not go ahead in 2020.

===Cable thefts===
In December 2020, Cheshire Constabulary issued a press release stating that the site was &quot;unsafe for intruders&quot; and that it was still connected to the National Grid, leaving many of the cables electrically live. They stated concerns over reports that individuals had been breaking into the site.

In June 2021, a man was arrested for going equipped to steal and theft, after police officers found him in the power station grounds with tools and a large quantity of cable. Police stated that the man was &quot;lucky to be alive&quot;.

===Attempted listing===
In 2021, a local architect requested that Historic England consider listing the power station&#x27;s cooling towers. However, Historic England declined to list the towers and gave the site a certificate of immunity. In response to this decision, The Twentieth Century Society expressed their concern that the demolition of this and other power stations from this generation meant that England is &quot;at risk of losing an entire building typology that provides important landmarks and monuments to C20 industry.&quot;

===Demolition===
On 3 December 2023, despite heavy fog partially obscuring the safety zones, the first phase of the site&#x27;s demolition commenced with the four northernmost cooling towers. Local resident Grace Taylor was given the opportunity to press the detonation button after winning a raffle organised in conjunction with Peel NRE, and the four cooling towers fell in a controlled explosion at 09:35am which could be heard up to away, including at the Trafford Centre in Urmston, Greater Manchester. The demolition process will eventually include the remaining four cooling towers, boiler house, chimney stack and administration buildings, as well as clearance of the former coal stockyard and machinery. Phase two of the demolition is planned to take place over 18 months beginning in the first half of 2024 though the remaining four cooling towers, main power station chimney stack and the gas turbine building exhaust stack will not be demolished during this phase. The site will be cleared to become housing in the near future.

<doc id="637270" wikidata="Q70484" url="?curid=637270" title="Charles, Count Alten">
<text>Sir Charles August von Alten (21 October 1764 – 20 April 1840), better known as Charles, Count Alten, was a German army officer and politician who led the Light Division during the last two years of the Peninsular War. At the Battle of Waterloo, he commanded a division in the front line, where he was wounded. He later rose to the rank of Field Marshal in the Hanoverian Army.

Alten was the son of August Eberhard von Alten (1722–1789), a member of an old Hanoverian family, and Baroness Henriette Philippine Marie Hedwig von Vincke-Ostenwalde. 

Alten&#x27;s older brother, Victor Alten (1755–1820) commanded a cavalry brigade in Wellington&#x27;s army. Unlike his brother Charles, Victor is described as &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;.

==Early career==
Alten entered the service of the elector as a page at the age of twelve.

In 1781 he received a commission in the Hanoverian guards, and as a captain took part in the campaigns of 1793–1795 in the Low Countries, distinguishing himself particularly on the Lys in command of light infantry. In 1803 the Hanoverian Army was disbanded, and Alten took service with the King&#x27;s German Legion (KGL) of the British Army. In command of the KGL&#x27;s light infantry, he took part with Lord Cathcart in the Hanover Expedition of 1805. He also fought at Copenhagen in 1807.

==Peninsular War==

Alten was with John Moore in Sweden and Spain. He commanded the 2nd Flank Brigade in Moore&#x27;s campaign though he missed the Battle of Corunna. He participated in the disastrous Walcheren expedition in the summer of 1809. He was soon employed once more in the Peninsula, and at the Battle of Albuera he commanded an independent KGL brigade. An incident in the battle highlights both the abilities and the limitations of Alten.
In April 1812 Arthur Wellesley, Viscount Wellington placed him at the head of the famous Light Division, which consisted of the 1/43rd and 1/52nd Light Infantry, 95th Rifles, and 1st and 3rd Portuguese Caçadores. In this post he worthily continued the records of Moore and Robert Craufurd at the battles of Salamanca, Vitoria, the Pyrenees, the Nivelle, the Nive, Orthez and Toulouse. His officers presented him with a sword of honour as a token of their esteem. Wellington called Alten, &quot;the best of the Hanoverians&quot;. Comparing him with Craufurd, Charles Oman writes:
==Waterloo and later career==
In 1815 Alten led Wellington&#x27;s 3rd Division during the Hundred Days. This command included Maj-Gen Colin Halkett&#x27;s 5th British Brigade, Col Christian Ompteda&#x27;s 2nd KGL Brigade and Maj-Gen Friedrich Kielmansegge&#x27;s 1st Hanoverian Brigade. Parts of the division were heavily engaged at the Battle of Quatre Bras. At the Battle of Waterloo, the 3rd Division held the front line throughout the day and suffered very heavy losses. Severely wounded in the battle, Alten&#x27;s conduct won for him the rank of Count von Alten.
When the King&#x27;s German Legion ceased to exist, Alten was given the command of the Hanoverians in France. In 1818 he returned to Hanover, where he subsequently became minister of war and foreign affairs, and rose to the rank of Field Marshal. At the same time, he was retained on the British Army List as Major-General Sir Charles Alten, GCB. He died in 1840. A memorial to Alten has been erected at Hanover. He is buried in the Neustädter Kirche.

Natural depressions in the glacial drift left by the ice sheets which covered the Cheshire–Shropshire plain during the last ice age, 10,000–15,000 years ago, filled with water, forming the meres and mosses characteristic of the area today. In some cases, like Risley Moss, peat accumulation filled the depression, allowing colonisation by bog mosses such as the &quot;Sphagnum&quot; varieties, thus giving rise to the name &quot;moss&quot;.

Risley Moss is one of only two mosses in Cheshire where the water level has been deliberately raised in an attempt to encourage the regeneration of an active bog surface. The long-term restoration project to re-wet the moss began in 1978 and was completed in 2002. This scheme was undertaken to create a series of scrapes and bunds to retain water and recreate the perfect conditions for bog flora such as cotton grass and sphagnum mosses to re-colonise the bogs.

Risley Moss was first mentioned in the Doomsday Book when it was part of the Culcheth Estate. The Moss passed to his daughter Ellen de Risley and remained in her family until 1736 when it was bought by a local landowner. During the Industrial Revolution many of the peat bogs near Manchester were drained however Risley was too wet and remained under water.

It was the former site of a large Royal Ordnance Factory. Today, it is managed by Cheshire County Council as a country park and an educational nature reserve. It was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1986. Risley Moss, together with Astley and Bedford Mosses and Holcroft Moss, is also a European Union designated Special Area of Conservation, known as Manchester Mosses.

==Features==
The main feature of Risley Moss is the large peat bog, overlooked by two observation points: a raised platform (previously having a large watchtower) ideal for bird watching, and a smaller lookout (currently obstructed by plant growth). These points have additional information inside relating to bird species and landscape layouts. The Moss also has several smaller huts located inside the forested area for bird watching and nature enthusiasts. Tours across the bog and nature reserve are available from the main information centre and are undertaken by local rangers. 

In addition to the natural features and landscape, there are several sculptures around the site, usually with a natural theme.

==Facilities==
There is a visitor centre, countryside walks, bird hides and picnic benches.

<doc id="637279" wikidata="Q6117934" url="?curid=637279" title="Jacksonville Bulls">
<text>The Jacksonville Bulls were a professional American football team based in Jacksonville, Florida. They were members of the United States Football League (USFL) during its final two seasons, 1984 and 1985. They played their home games in the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville.

Former Miami Dolphins stars Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick were involved in an advertising campaign for the team, and they apparently had a minor ownership interest as well. Larry Munson was hired as radio play-by-play announcer. His distinctive voice was already well known in the Jacksonville area due to his long association with both the University of Georgia Bulldogs and the National Football League&#x27;s Atlanta Falcons.

==Team name and colors==
The Bulls&#x27; name was taken from team owner Fred &quot;Bubba&quot; Bullard, a Jacksonville land developer. Bullard had initially sought to buy a stake in the Boston Breakers and move them to Jacksonville when it became apparent the Breakers could not find a suitable venue in Boston. However, Breakers owner George Matthews broke off talks when Bullard insisted that coach Dick Coury be fired in favor of Florida State Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden.

The team held a &#x27;name the team&#x27; promotion with a write-in campaign for publicity purposes. The Bulls moniker was credited as a submission from the winning entry. The team colors of garnet, orange and silver were taken from the three college football teams most popular in the area; garnet from the Seminoles, orange from the Florida Gators, and silver from the pants worn by the Georgia Bulldogs.

The helmet design was unique for a professional football team. Each side had the team&#x27;s logo of a streaking bull (one side the mirror image of the other); the two logos were bridged by a series of parallel lines, and the team name was incorporated into the bridge as a silhouette against the parallel lines.

==1984 season==
The Bulls made an immediate splash in their first game, in which they blew out the Washington Federals 53–14. Although they finished 6-12 — last in the tough Southern Division — they were far more competitive than their record indicated. Six of their losses were by a touchdown or less, including two losses by a last-second field goal. They remained in contention for most of the season, but a six-game losing streak toward the end of the season kept them out of the playoffs.

The Bulls were an undisputed success at the gate, running away with the league&#x27;s attendance title. They notched the only two crowds of 70,000 or greater in league history, including a throng of 73,227 against the powerful New Jersey Generals on March 4. In the last game, against the Pittsburgh Maulers, a huge crowd patiently waited through a late-June downpour which postponed the game for more than an hour. When play finally started the Bulls won 26–2.

==Offseason==
The offseason saw the addition of former NFL MVP QB Brian Sipe to take over as triggerman of Coach Lindy Infante&#x27;s high octane passing scheme as well as former Heisman Trophy winning HB Mike Rozier.

==1985 season==
While Sipe only threw 89 passes before suffering a career-ending injury, an improved defense and the addition of Rozier resulted in a 9–9 record. The Bulls finished one win short of a playoff spot and led the league in attendance again.

=== 1985 schedule and results ===

==Demise==
The Bulls were one of the seven teams assured of playing the 1986 USFL season, which would have been played in the autumn. The Bulls had bought the football assets of the Denver Gold during the offseason and were to take on much of that team&#x27;s staff, including head coach Mouse Davis. It also attempted to negotiate a merger with the Tampa Bay Bandits, mainly to bring the Bandits&#x27; ownership group into the organization, but the eventual deaths of the two leading investors in the Bandits (and their steadfast refusal to go along with the league&#x27;s plan to move to the autumn in 1986) and the unwillingness of the Orlando Renegades to join in (which would have created a single franchise representing all of Florida) led to those plans being abandoned.

The USFL itself was pursuing a large antitrust lawsuit against the NFL at the time; when they failed to secure a sizable judgment against the older league, the USFL suspended operations and eventually folded.

==Legacy==
Despite never posting a winning record, the Bulls were considered to be a serious attempt at a viable professional football organization — indeed, one of the few USFL teams with the potential to be viable had the league been better run. Owner Fred Bullard was determined from the beginning to put together a strong organization on and off the field. Many experts believe that had it not been for the Bulls&#x27; success, the NFL would not have considered awarding the Jacksonville Jaguars to the city in 1993. In 1987 the Houston Oilers nearly moved to Jacksonville, in part due to the overwhelming support for the Bulls. The nearby Matthews Bridge was painted in the garnet main color as a backdrop for the games.

<doc id="637281" wikidata="Q2422525" url="?curid=637281" title="Isaac Hull">
<text>Isaac Hull (March 9, 1773 – February 13, 1843) was a Commodore in the United States Navy. He commanded several famous U.S. naval warships including (&quot;Old Ironsides&quot;) and saw service in the undeclared naval Quasi War with the revolutionary French Republic (France) 1796–1800; the Barbary Wars (1801–1805, 1815), with the Barbary states in North Africa; and the War of 1812 (1812–1815), for the second time with Great Britain. In the latter part of his career he was Commandant of the Washington Navy Yard in the national capital of Washington, D.C., and later the Commodore of the Mediterranean Squadron. For the infant U.S. Navy, the battle of USS &quot;Constitution&quot; vs HMS &quot;Guerriere&quot; on August 19, 1812, at the beginning of the war, was the most important single ship action of the War of 1812 and one that made Isaac Hull a national hero.

==Early life==

Hull was born in Derby, Connecticut (some sources say Huntington, now Shelton, Connecticut), on March 9, 1773.
Early in life he joined his mariner father, Joseph, on local voyages and longer trips to the West Indies. After his father died while still young, Isaac was adopted by his uncle William Hull, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War.

During the mid-1790s, the young Hull commanded several merchant vessels, losing some to French Republic privateers.

==Naval service==
He was commissioned a lieutenant in the newly formed United States Navy on 9 March 1798 and distinguished himself during the next two years while serving on board the new heavy frigate in the undeclared naval Quasi-War with France. During his time on USS &quot;Constitution&quot;, Hull served as first lieutenant and executive officer to Captain Silas Talbot. Talbot was in command from June 5, 1799 until September 8, 1801. Since Talbot was also a squadron commander, much of the everyday running of the ship fell to Hull and provided him invaluable experience managing a ship of war. Hull much admired Talbot, a hero of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), and learned a great deal from the older man. Hull&#x27;s chief biographer Linda M. Maloney states Talbot &quot;was undoubtedly the formative influence on Hull&#x27;s naval career, the man he modeled himself after.&quot; From Talbot, Hull learned the lessons of naval leadership, moderation and to look out for the training of his junior officers and ship crew. Captain Talbot resigned his Commission and he was ordered to take command of &quot;Constitution&quot; in a letter dated 21 September, 1801. 

===First Barbary War===
When troubles with the Barbary states heated up in 1802, he went to the Mediterranean Sea as first lieutenant of the frigate . Hull later commanded the schooner and the brig , receiving promotion to the rank of master commandant on 18 May, 1804, and to captain in 1806. During this time Hull made a reputation as an effective and reliable commander. Midshipman Henry Wadsworth, writing in his journal for August 10, 1803, noted: &quot;This morning at day light the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; being at a distance of several miles discovered a galley at long shot. Captain Hull fired on her &amp; gave chase. She fired to leeward (signal for friend) but did not heave too. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; came near her &amp; she hove too: proved to be a Sardinian Galley, last from Civita Vecchia on a cruise 25 oars on each side (Captain Hull imagined) carried about 300 hundred men had 2 eighteen pounders mounted forward &amp; 2 smaller guns aft. A noble Galley!!!&quot; During the next few years, he supervised the construction of gunboats and, in 1809 and 1810, was successively given command of the frigates , and USS &quot;Constitution&quot;.

===Command of USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot;===
On 2 February 1809 Hull took command of USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; with orders to enforce the trade embargo, but a month later the embargo was repealed and the vessel returned to Boston for minor repairs and filling out the crew. During this time Hull helped the recruiting service. Keeping ships manned was a source of major anxiety for Hull throughout his long career. Hull found it necessary on occasion to take drastic measures to prevent men lured by bounty money from deserting, as he explained in an April 16, 1810 letter to the Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton justifying his placing newly recruited men in irons and confinement prior to sailing. &quot;With two months advance from the merchant ship, and advance and bounty from the recruiting officer and other expenses brought them in debt from fifty to eighty dollars.&quot; Having the full complement of men necessary to crew a frigate was a constant challenge. Exacerbating the challenge was a cold fact: recruitment was voluntary—there was no draft or impressment service as in the British navy. Poor pay and conditions of life on a warship in the pre-1815 U.S. Navy meant Hull and other commanding officers were plagued by expired enlistments and high rates of desertion. For naval enlisted men there was no fixed term of service, seamen served for a voyage or cruise on a particular ship, hence at the end of voyage, they felt free to leave and often did. For naval ships at every port call desertion was a reality. Despite extracting harsh penalties such as flogging, the problem persisted. While reliable data is scarce, one scholar notes the desertion rate for petty officers and enlisted men on board was 12.8%, and states the number one reason for enlisted courts martial was desertion. In all, Hull was in command of USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; for seven months.

===Command of USS &quot;President&quot;===
On 7 May 1810 Isaac Hull was ordered to assume command of the new frigate USS &quot;President&quot;, but his tenure was short. The reason for Hull&#x27;s short stay was Commodore John Rodgers. Rodgers had almost simultaneously been ordered to USS &quot;Constitution&quot;. John Rodgers too had sailed &quot;Constitution&quot; from New York and did not like the way she sailed. The frigate had seen years of hard service, her bottom was fouled by mussels, barnacles and her sails worn, and Rodgers also objected to the way she handled. Rodgers made complaint to Secretary Hamilton that as ranking senior naval captain he should have had &quot;President&quot;. Hamilton agreed, and Hull apparently was only too happy to swap, for on 17 June 1810 Rodgers took &quot;President&quot; and Hull assumed command of &quot;Constitution&quot;.

===Command of USS &quot;Constitution&quot;===

Isaac Hull assumed command of the frigate USS &quot;Constitution&quot; in June 1810; his time on the ship was eventful. As commanding officer Hull &quot;modeled himself on Silas Talbot&quot;, his mentor and a former commander of &quot;Constitution&quot;. Hull &quot;among the enlisted men, he now commanded, on her maiden voyage was perhaps, the most popular captain in the service. He was also, perhaps the greatest all-round seaman in the navy with a genius for ship-handling and navigation that would serve him well in the weeks to come.&quot; On &quot;Constitution&quot; he was very much at home; it was his &quot;favorite frigate&quot;. Writing to his sister in-law Mary Wheeler, he exclaimed, &quot;I now have one of the best ships in our Navy ...&quot; Like Silas Talbot, Hull took great care in the training of his young officers by seeing to their comforts and their education. Like Talbot too, Hull trained his enlisted men, many of whom had never served on a ship of war before, especially in gunnery. He &quot;exercised the men at the great guns up to two hours daily over several weeks to infuse them with confidence and competence to face the enemy in battle.&quot; Hull discouraged flogging and found the practice abhorrent for trivial offenses. He prohibited his officers from punishing seamen or marines in his absence. Hull gave direction that the punishment for missing muster or any trifling offense &quot;shall not exceed three lashes with a small rope over the shirt.&quot; The typical penalty of the era was eight to ten on the bare back. Hull did authorize flogging for more serious offenses; for example on &quot;12 August 1812 John W. Smith and John Smith were each given a dozen lashes for drunkenness and the latter for insolence.&quot; He took the vessel on a European cruise in 1811–1812, returning home before the War of 1812 broke out between the United States and Great Britain. &quot;Constitution&quot; left Chesapeake Bay in July 1812.
In a letter dated July 2, 1812, Hull wrote from on board the &quot;Constitution&quot; to Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton:

By Sunday next, the Ship will be in tolerable order for Sea but the crew you will readily conceive must yet be unacquainted with a Ship of War, as many of them have lately joined us and never were in an armed Ship before. We are doing all that we can to make them acquainted with their duties, and in a few days, we shall have nothing to fear from any single deck Ship; indeed; unacquainted as we now are, we should I hope give a good account of any Frigate the enemy have. 

Shortly thereafter they were followed by five ships of the British Halifax Squadron commanded by Commodore Philip Broke. The squadron was composed of one ship of the line and four frigates , , , and , who were in close pursuit for two days. In a remarkable feat of navigation and audacity, Hull evaded the British squadron by warping his ship ahead and using his long boats to tow &quot;Constitution&quot;. The chase by the Halifax Squadron was long and arduous and established Hull&#x27;s reputation for courage, daring and seamanship. &quot;For sixty four hours the frigate had been insight of an overwhelming enemy and most of the time actively pursued by them,&quot; yet Hull prevailed.

On August 19, 1812, USS &quot;Constitution&quot; encountered the British frigate at sea. As &quot;Constitution&quot;″s crew went to quarters, Hull cautioned his gunners: &quot;No firing at random. Let every man look well to his aim.&quot; Captain James Richard Dacres of &quot;Guerriere&quot; at first tried to cripple &quot;Constitution&quot; at long range, but quickly found this tactic of no avail. He then approached &quot;Constitution&quot; at close range. All the while Captain Hull kept his crew calm telling them &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you when to fire, so stand steady and see that not a shot is thrown away.&quot; At 6:05 the two ships were alongside and &quot;Constitution&quot;″s starboard guns, at Hull&#x27;s orders, poured in a broadside of &quot;double-shotted&quot; (two round shots loaded in one gun and fired at the same time). Writing on August 28, 1812 to Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton, Hull recalled, &#x27;when we were within less than a pistol shot, we commenced a very heavy fire from all our guns, loaded with round and grape, which done great Execution, so much that within fifteen minutes from the time we got alongside, his Mizzen Mast went by the board, and his Main Yard in the Slings and the Hull and Sails very much injured, which made it difficult for them to manage her.&quot; Hull continued: the enemy put his helm to port, &quot;at the time we did, but his Mizzen Mast being over the Quarter prevented her coming too, which brought us across his Bow, when his Bowsprit over our Stern. At this moment I determined to board him, but the instant the Boarders were called, for that purpose, his Foremast and Main Mast went by the board and took with them the Gib boom and every spar except the Bowsprit ... we stood off for about half an hour to repair our braces and other riggings that had been shot away and wore around to return to the enemy, it being now dark we could not see whether she had any colors flying or not.&quot; Moses Smith, a seaman, would later recall &quot;Several shot now entered our hull. One of the largest the enemy could command struck us, but the plank was so hard it fell out and sank in the waters. This was afterwards noticed and the cry arose: &#x27;Huzza! Her sides are made of iron! See where the shot fell-out!&#x27; From that circumstance the name of the &quot;Constitution&quot; was garnished with the familiar title.&quot; USS &quot;Constitution&quot; had pounded HMS &quot;Guerriere&quot; into a wreck.

The deck log of USS &quot;Constitution&quot; dated August 19, 1812 contains the following account (all spelling original) of the battle: &quot;... at 5 minutes after 6 PM hauled down the Jib and lay the Main Top Sail Shivering and opened on him a heavy fire from all our Guns, at 15 minutes after 6 PM the Enemy&#x27;s Mizen Mast fell over on the Starboard Side, on which our Crew gave three cheers, we then fore reaching on him, attempted raking of his Bow, but our braces being shot away and Jib Haulyards we could not effect it, he immediately attempted raking of our Stern but failed also, getting but one of his Guns to bear upon us, which he discharged with little or no effect, having his Bowsprit entangled in our Mizin Rigging, our Marines during that time Keeping up a very brisk and gauling fire on him from the Tafferall, taffrail, the railing at the ship&#x27;s stern and our Boarders preparing to board, at which time Lieutenant Charles Morris, and Lieutenant William S. Bush of the Marines fell from off the Tafferall, the former severely wounded and the latter killed, our vessel having way on her shot clear of him, when immediately, it being then 30 minutes after 6 PM his Fore, and Main Masts fell over on the Starboard side, Sett Fore and Main Course, and Stood to the Eastward and took one reef in the Topsails, in order to reeve our braces and haulyards which had been shot away; during which time the Enemy a complete wreck, under his Spritsail, fired a Gun in token of submission to Leeward which we answered as soon as our Topsails were sett, and our braces rove by wearing Ship, and running under his Lee, hauling up our Courses and laying our Main Topsail to the Mast, and sending a boat with Lieutenant Reed on board of the Prize, at 1/2 past 7 PM hoisted out all the Boats, to take out the Prisoners, sent the 2d &amp; 3d cutters on board with the Surgeons Mate to assist in dressing the wounded, and the Sailing Master in the First Cutter with a Ten inch hawser to take the prize in tow, ...&quot;

Captain Dacres, though wounded, signaled the surrender and Hull sent boats to the British frigate for their wounded and to take the remaining crew prisoner. In all seven American sailors were killed and seven wounded. The British frigate suffered 15 killed and 78 wounded; with 257 captured. Hull was a magnanimous victor, complementing Captain Dacres and his crew on their courage, and after Dacres presented him his sword, Hull graciously returned it. Ship Log August 20, 1812 &quot;[R]emoved the prisoners and baggage from the prize ship. Sent a surgeon&#x27;s mate to assist the wounded, [H]aving removed all prisoners ... immediately set her a fire, and at quarter pass 3, she blew-up.&quot; The action electrified the nation, made Captain Hull a national hero and demonstrated that the small U.S. Navy was a worthy and dangerous opponent for Britain&#x27;s otherwise overwhelming maritime might. On September 9, 1814 Secretary of the Navy Hamilton wrote the Captain: &quot;In this action we know not most to applaud, your gallantry, or your skill. You and your crew are entitled to and will receive the applause and gratitude of your grateful country. As reward for this stunning achievement, the U.S. Congress voted Captain Hull a gold medal with silver copies for his commissioned officers, and &quot;Constitution&quot;″s entire crew shared $50,000 in prize money for HMS &quot;Guerriere&quot;″s destruction.

===Portsmouth Navy Yard===
Hull commanded the Portsmouth Navy Yard at Kittery, Maine, for the rest of the War of 1812. Hull assumed command of the Portsmouth Navy Yard on 9 April 1813 and remained until he was relieved by Commodore Thomas Macdonough on 1 July 1815. During Hull&#x27;s tenure as commandant the primary focus was on the fitting out of , construction of and improvements to the defense of the navy yard One of the most important innovations during Hull&#x27;s tenure at Portsmouth was the construction of a shiphouse. Hull, a Connecticut native, knew that in order for the shipyard to succeed, the workers and the vessels needed cover during the long and cold New England winters. Writing to the Secretary of the Navy William Jones on 24 July 1813, Hull noted &quot;As the Winters here are very cold and large quantities of Snow falls, may I be permitted to suggest the idea of covering the Ship after she is framed. The cost to build a permanent cover would probably be two thousand dollars, and I believe a greater part of it would be saved in building this ship and others could be built under it, so that by having one much would be saved in labor besides the injury to the Frame by being exposed to the winter and the sun the next summer.&quot; The ship house was completed in December 1813 and continued in use for the next four decades.

===Board of Navy Commissioners===

Hull then served on the Board of Navy Commissioners for the years 1815–1817 in Washington D.C. The law creating the Board gave it authority over procurement of naval stores, supplies and material as these related to the construction of naval vessels, outfitting of ships, armament and equipment plus oversight authority over naval shipyards, stations and drydocks. The BNC also regulated civilian employment and pay. Serving with Hull on the Board were Commodores David Porter and John Rodgers. The BNC found all current yards to have shortcomings. One of the most important recommendations the BNC made was that only Portsmouth and Boston Navy Yard were suitable for the building of large ships in all seasons. Though the BNC recommended Washington Navy Yard be retained, its report noted, &quot;The Yard at Washington, when viewed as building yard only, would be less objectionable [than Baltimore] were the navigation deeper and the obstructions fewer. But it is the decided opinion of the Board, that the obstructions and its distance from the sea render it unsuitable for every other purpose.&quot; The Board recommended Baltimore, Norfolk and Charleston navy yards be closed. These recommendations were controversial and became the subject of considerable partisanship, with only Baltimore and Charleston eventually phased out of existence. The BNC final report was in fact, highly critical of the Washington Navy Yard and its business practices. Writing on 11 May 1815 to Commodore Thomas Tingey, the BNC stated, &quot;The Board are about contracting for the repairs of the Black Smith shop in the Navy Yard under your command for the purpose of employing workmen to put in order for service &amp; a state of preservation ... It is the intention of the Board of the Navy Commissioners, to reestablish the Navy Yard at this place, as a building Yard only, &amp; while stating to you this intention, it may not be improper for them to make you acquainted with their views generally with respect to the establishment. They have witnessed in many of our Navy Yards &amp; this particularly pressure in the employment of characters unsuited for the public service – maimed &amp; unmanageable slaves for the accommodation of distressed widows &amp; orphans &amp; indigent families – apprentices for the accommodation of their masters – &amp; old men &amp; children for the benefit of their families &amp; parents. These practices must cease – none must be employed but for the advantage of the public, &amp; this Yard instead of rendering the navy odious to the nation from the scenes of want &amp; extravagance which it has too long exhibited must serve as a model on which to prefect a general system of economy. In making to you,- Sir, these remarks the Navy Commissioners are aware that you have with themselves long witnessed the evils of which they complain, &amp; which every countenance will be given to assist you in remedying them, they calculate with confidence on a disposition on your part to forward the public interests.&quot; Later in his career when Commodore Hull assumed command of the Washington Navy Yard (1829–1835), he attempted to right these alleged wrongs and implement necessary change.

===Charlestown Navy Yard===
At Charlestown Navy Yard, known as Boston Navy Yard, Hull&#x27;s tenure as commandant was marred and hindered by his lack of familiarity with the administration of a large shore installation, the management of the civilian workforce and by the moves to dislodge him by some of his senior and junior naval officers. A number of these officers and senior civilians made public accusations questioning Hull&#x27;s command. In view of the serious nature of their charges a Naval Court of Inquiry met in Charlestown during August 1822 to consider the accusations brought against Hull. On 15 October 1822 the court found Hull had acted properly and within his scope of authority and in his official duties had been &quot;correct and meritorious.&quot; Nevertheless, the court cautioned Hull regarding placing his personal property in public stores and the employment of navy yard mechanics and laborers for private purposes. But the bitterness of the affair never really left Hull for as he wrote &quot;This yard is much improved and in fine order for whoever may take it. I am tired of this kind of life and particularly of this place, and have nothing but constant quarrels with the Charleston people.&quot; During 1823–1827, he commanded the Pacific Squadron operating out of South America aboard .

===Washington Navy Yard===
Commodore Hull&#x27;s next assignment was as Commandant of the Washington Navy Yard (WNY), 1829–1835. The Washington Navy Yard, station log, recorded that Hull &quot;assumed command on Saturday 11 April 1829 at 11.00 with a thirteen gun salute.&quot; During Hull&#x27;s five year tenure, shipbuilding on the Potomac River dramatically fell as the yard built just one naval vessel; the aptly named and ill-fated schooner, . As early as 1815 the Navy Department had decided the shallowness of the Anacostia River channel made Washington DC less than an ideal port and consequently approved the shift to ordnance production. Shipwrights and carpenters, the elite trades of the wooden–hulled navy, felt especially threatened as the navy yard focused on metal trades manufacturing and proved extremely reluctant to abandon their time-honored practices. On taking command Hull was mindful of the Board of Navy Commissioners&#x27; 1815 critical report and attempted to fix the problems the BNC noted. 

Hull&#x27;s new command however once again involved managing a large and restless workforce, but at WNY one composed of white civilian mechanics, laborers and enslaved and free blacks. At WNY he quickly discovered a violation of navy regulations; the employment of slaves by naval yard officers. When ordered to discharge all slaves in the anchor shop, though, he protested to the Board of Navy Commissioners &quot;I fear we could not find a set of men white or black, or even slaves ... to now do in the anchor shop.&quot; &quot;Competition for jobs on the navy yard was constant ... white workers feared that competition from enslaved and even free blacks dragged down the wage scale.&quot;

Hull was often conflicted in matters of race. When newly arrived in Washington DC he had purchased an enslaved black man John Ambler, from a fellow officer for his &quot;servant&quot;, yet when leaving the navy yard, he manumitted Ambler on 17 October 1835 and later intervened to get Ambler a discharge from a naval vessel. African American diarist Michael Shiner on the other hand remembered Hull fondly for his assistance in securing the release of his wife and children from a slave dealer. Shiner wrote &quot;i am under Great oblagation to Comodore isaac Hull for the time my Wife wher Sold to george he had command of the washington navy yard foer his kindness to me&quot;

Hull&#x27;s taciturn management style quickly aroused the resentment of his white workforce. After his arrival Hull had made efforts to check what he perceived as the unwarranted independence of some of his senior civilian managers, to improve the unkempt appearance of navy yard grounds and control the loss of government property. Hull&#x27;s strict management combined with long simmering disputes over pay, working hours and the employment of blacks quickly came to a head the summer of 1835.

====WNY Strike of 1835====

A labor strike which began on 29 July 1835 was a response to Hull&#x27;s orders limiting the workers&#x27; lunch period and what they were allowed to bring on the navy yard. After Hull&#x27;s hard experience with the Boston inquiry, he was particularly sensitive to any hint of misappropriation. When he learned of alleged thefts of government property, he promptly issued an order limiting workers&#x27; lunch privileges, and in response, the workers went on strike. Hull was aware that his workers were ostensibly striking over more than his newly imposed restrictions. He speculated that &quot;the mechanics have been acted on by other causes,&quot; Hull was concerned that the ten-hour day movement and the Board of Navy Commissioners resistance to reducing the workweek was the actual cause of the strike, and that the calls for general strike that summer by the Philadelphia shipyard workers had found an attentive audience. To Hull&#x27;s chagrin the strikers were encouraged by Naval Constructor William Doughty to hold out for higher wages. The workers felt Hull often treated them with &quot;silent contempt&quot; which was probably the result of his deafness.&quot; In Hull&#x27;s report to the Secretary of the Navy, Mahlon Dickerson, he stated that 175 white mechanics and workers had joined the strike. Their walkout also immediately exposed longstanding racial discord in the Yard. The strike quickly morphed into the infamous Snow Riot as many angry white workers now out of employment took out their resentments on the black community, their anger fanned by the false rumor that free black restaurant owner Beverley Snow had disparaged their wives. Josephine Seaton, the wife of the publisher of the &quot;National Intelligencer&quot;, William Seaton, expressed alarm in a letter regarding the strike and riot: &quot;Snow will certainly be torn to pieces by the mechanics if he be caught, and they are in full pursuit of him. Unfortunately, several hundred mechanics of the navy yard are out of employment, who, aided and abetted by their sympathizers, create the mob, ... and it is truly alarming.&quot; As the riot spread the city government became alarmed, the strikers had sent a delegation to President Andrew Jackson, who was sympathetic, pleading their case for his intervention and referring to Commodore Hull&#x27;s order as &quot;despotic&quot;.

The strike and subsequent riot after nearly two weeks left the navy yard workers with no pay and collapsing public support. A mediator Dr. Alexander A. McWilliams was brought into arrange a compromise, wherein the strikers after withdrawing their charges against Hull were allowed to return to work. The strike officially ended on Saturday August 15, 1835 and the workers returned to the Yard that Saturday morning. Although Hull and the mechanics attempted to smooth over their differences by noting they derived from &quot;a misunderstanding&quot;, both parties had lost much in the course of the strike. The workers, though allowed to return to their jobs, had lost financially. Most importantly for the workers, the strike revealed the weakness and tenuous nature of their bargaining situation. As per diem labor in a protracted dispute, and absent effective organization, they inevitably suffered. The strike also revealed the corrosive effects of racism on the workforce as white workers sought to blame their own precarious economic situation on free and enslaved African Americans. Further, the strike left as part of its legacy a deep and abiding racial mistrust, which would linger. For the next century, the history of the strike and subsequent race riot remained an embarrassment to be glossed over and disassociated from the Washington Navy Yard&#x27;s official history. Hull too received an object lesson in the limits of power; he could order but could not compel. The whole event left Hull offended deeply by the strikers&#x27; conduct and to some degree by the strong suggestion of the Secretary of the Navy Dickerson to accept the mediated compromise. On 10 September 1835 Isaac Hull requested and received a year&#x27;s leave of absence. He never returned to Washington Navy Yard.

===Command of USS &quot;Ohio&quot; and European Squadron===
From 1839 to 1841 Commodore Hull was in command of the flagship and the European squadron. The European squadron included the frigate and sloops-of-war and .

==Death and legacy==

Rendered unfit for further service by age and ill health, he spent the next two years on leave. Commodore Isaac Hull died at the age of 69 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and was interred in Laurel Hill Cemetery.

The U.S. Navy named five ships in honor of Isaac Hull, including: , , , , and .

The Commodore Isaac Hull Memorial Bridge spanning the Housatonic River between Derby and Shelton is named after him.

Hull Avenue in the Bronx, New York is named in honor of Hull.

Hull Street in Richmond, Virginia is named in honor of Hull.

Hull Street in Montgomery, Alabama is named in honor of Hull. It runs parallel to streets named after other Barbary War/War of 1812 naval heroes.

Fort Hull, a fort built along the Federal Road during the Creek War, was named in honor of Hull.

Hull Street in Savannah, Georgia, is also named for him.

<text>General William Schaw Cathcart, 1st Earl Cathcart (17 September 175516 June 1843) was a British Army officer and diplomat who served as the British ambassador to Russia from 1805 to 1806.

==Early life==

Cathcart born at Petersham, London, on 17 September 1755, and educated at Eton College. He was the son of Charles Cathcart, 9th Lord Cathcart and his wife Ann Hamilton.

==Military career==
In 1771 he went to St. Petersburg, where his father, Charles Cathcart, 9th Lord Cathcart, a general in the army, was ambassador. He became an excellent horseman in Russia then from 1773 to 1777 he studied law at the University of Glasgow and was afterwards called to the Scottish Bar. He succeeded to the lordship upon his father&#x27;s death in 1776, and inherited several properties including Schawpark an estate near Sauchie where his father had commissioned Robert Adam to remodel the mansion house but the works were incomplete when his father died.

In 1777 he obtained a commission in the 7th Dragoons.
Proceeding to America in 1777, he had before the close of his first campaign twice won promotion on the field of battle. He transferred to the 17th Light Dragoons. In 1778 he further distinguished himself in outpost work, and at the Battle of Monmouth he commanded the British Legion, with conspicuous success; for a time also he acted as quartermaster-general to the forces in America. He returned home in 1780, and in February 1781 was made captain and lieutenant colonel in the Coldstream Guards.

In September 1784 Cathcart organised the first formal cricket match in Scotland, in the grounds of Schawpark and commissioned a family portrait by David Allan to commemorate the event.

He was elected a Scottish representative peer in 1788, and in 1792 he became colonel of the 29th Foot. He served with distinction in the campaigns in the Low Countries, 1793–1795, in the course of which he was promoted major general; and in 1801 he was made a lieutenant general, having in the meanwhile received the appointments of Vice Admiral of Scotland (1795), privy councillor (1798), and colonel of the 2nd Life Guards (1797).

From 1803 to 1805 Lord Cathcart was Commander-in-Chief in Ireland, and in the latter year he was sent by Pitt to supersede Sir George Don in command of the 14,000 strong British Hanover Expedition. He occupied Hanover on 14 December and joined with Werdereffsky&#x27;s Russian column of Tolstoi&#x27;s corps. After skirmishes with the French forces of at Springe, Cathcart was forced to withdraw after the Franco-Prussian agreement of 27 January 1806 handing over Hanover to Prussia, and re-embarked for the United Kingdom on 7 February 1806.

After the recall of this expedition Cathcart commanded the forces in Scotland until 1807, when he was placed in charge of the expedition to Copenhagen, which surrendered to him on 6 September. Four weeks later he was created Viscount Cathcart of Cathcart and Baron Greenock of Greenock in the peerage of the United Kingdom, resuming the Scottish command on his return from the front.

On 1 January 1812 he was promoted to the full rank of general, and a few months later he proceeded to Russia as ambassador and military commissioner. In the latter capacity he served with the headquarters of the allies throughout the War of Liberation (1812–1814); his success in the delicate and difficult task of maintaining harmony and devotion to the common cause amongst the generals of many nationalities was recognized after the war by his elevation to an earldom (July 1814). He then went to St. Petersburg, and continued to hold the post of ambassador until 1820, when he returned to the United Kingdom.

He died at his estate near Glasgow on 16 June 1843. He is buried in Paisley Abbey with a monument by William Mossman erected in 1848.

==Family==
Cathcart married Elizabeth Elliot, the daughter of the lieutenant-governor of New York Andrew Elliot, on 10 April 1779. The couple had ten children, the first five being born in the 1780s. Their first child, Louisa, was born in New York on 25 January 1780, but died soon after her birth. Other children included the army officers Sir George Cathcart and Sir Charles Cathcart, both of whom became generals, the latter inheriting the peerage on his father&#x27;s death.

William&#x27;s first-born son, William Cathcart, entered the Royal Navy but died of yellow fever in 1804 while in command of his ship HMS &quot;Clorinde&quot;.

Cathcart took two of his sons with him during his appointment as ambassador to Russia, Captain Frederick Macadam Cathcart served as his private secretary and Lieutenant George Cathcart functioned as his aide-de-camp. Cathcart&#x27;s last son, Adolphus Frederick Cathcart, was born on 28 June 1803.

<doc id="637284" wikidata="Q693908" url="?curid=637284" title="Arnica">
<text>Arnica is a genus of perennial, herbaceous plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). The genus name &quot;Arnica&quot; may be derived from the Greek &quot;&quot;, &quot;lamb&quot;, in reference to the plants&#x27; soft, hairy leaves. &quot;Arnica&quot; is also known by the names mountain tobacco and, confusingly, leopard&#x27;s bane and wolfsbane—two names that it shares with the entirely unrelated genus &quot;Aconitum&quot;.

This circumboreal and montane (subalpine) genus occurs mostly in the temperate regions of western North America, with a few species native to the Arctic regions of northern Eurasia and North America.

&quot;Arnica&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including &quot;Bucculatrix arnicella&quot;.

&quot;Arnica&quot; was previously classified in the tribe Senecioneae because it has a flower or pappus of fine bristles.

==Characteristics==
&quot;Arnica&quot; plants have a deep-rooted, erect stem that is usually unbranched. Their downy opposite leaves are borne towards the apex of the stem. The ovoid, leathery basal leaves are arranged in a rosette.

They show large yellow or orange flowers, wide with long ray florets and numerous disc florets. The phyllaries (a bract under the flowerhead) has long spreading hairs. Each phyllary is associated with a ray floret. Species of &quot;Arnica&quot;, with an involucre (a circle of bracts arranged surrounding the flower head) arranged in two rows, have only their outer phyllaries associated with ray florets. The flowers have a slight aromatic smell.

The seedlike fruit has a pappus of plumose, white or pale tan bristles. The entire plant has a strong and distinct pine-sage odor when the leaves of mature plants are rubbed or bruised.

== &quot;Arnica montana&quot; ==

The species &quot;Arnica montana&quot;, native to Europe, has long been used in folk medicine, but there is no clinical evidence for its use as an effective therapy.

===Toxicity===
&quot;Arnica montana&quot; contains the toxin helenalin, which can be poisonous if large amounts of the plant are eaten, and contact with the plant can also cause skin irritation.

<text>Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Gregan Craufurd GCB (12 February 1763 – 26 March 1821) was a British soldier.

==Early life==
He was born in Golden Square, London, the second son of Sir Alexander Crauford of Kilbirnie, 1st Baronet and his wife, Jane Crokatt. He was the younger brother of Sir James Craufurd of Kilbirnie, 2nd Baronet and the elder brother of Robert Craufurd.

==Career==
Craufurd entered the 1st Dragoon Guards as a cornet on 15 December 1778. Promoted a lieutenant in 1781, he was raised to the rank of captain in the 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen&#x27;s Bays) in 1785. He became the equerry and intimate friend of the Duke of York. He studied in Germany for some time, and, with his brother Robert&#x27;s assistance, translated Tielke&#x27;s book on the Seven Years&#x27; War (&quot;The Remarkable Events of the War between Prussia, Austria and Russia from 1756 to 1763&quot;). As &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; he accompanied the Duke of York to the French War on the Netherlands in May 1793 attached to the Austrian HQ&#x27;s commander-in-chief. He was at once sent as commissioner to the Austrian headquarters, with which he was present at Neerwinden, Caesar&#x27;s Camp, Famars, Landrecies, etc.

Promoted to major in May 1793, and lieutenant-colonel in February 1794, he returned to the British Army in the latter year to become deputy assistant adjutant-general. At the Battle of Villers-en-Cauchies he distinguished himself at the head of a charge of two squadrons, capturing three guns and taking 1,000 prisoners. When the British army left the continent, Craufurd was again attached to the Austrian Army, and was present at the actions on the Lahn, the combat of Neumarket, and the Amberg. At the last battle a severe wound rendered him incapable of further service, and cut short a promising career. He was invalided out to England. There he did all he could to advance his brother, Robert&#x27;s career. Promoted colonel on 26 January 1797, he was already in charge of a brigade-major. On 23 September 1803 he was promoted to major-general.

Charles Craufurd was already an MP when appointed colonel of 2nd Dragoon Guards. He was made a Lieutenant-General in 1810. He succeeded his brother Robert as Member of Parliament (MP) for East Retford (1806–1812). Craufurd was a Tory in politics, friend of Lord Londonderry. He was made GCB on 27 May 1820

==Personal life==
On 7 February 1800 he was married Anna Mary, widow of Thomas Pelham-Clinton, 3rd Duke of Newcastle. The 4th Duke was a minor. His brother Robert got married on the same day. He died in 1821.

<text>Larry A. Silverstein (born May 30, 1931) is an American billionaire businessman. Among his real estate projects, he is the developer of the rebuilt World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan, New York City, as well as one of New York&#x27;s tallest residential towers at 30 Park Place, where he owns a home. As of December 2024, he had an estimated net worth of US$1 billion according to Forbes.

Silverstein was born in Brooklyn, and became involved in real estate, together with his father, establishing Silverstein Properties. Silverstein separated from his business partner, Bernard Mendik, in 1977, and bought a number of large office buildings in Midtown and Lower Manhattan in the late 1970s. In 1980, he won a bid from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to construct 7 World Trade Center on Vesey Street, just north of the main World Trade Center site. He was interested in acquiring the original World Trade Center complex, and put in a bid when the Port Authority put it up for lease in 2000. He won the bid when a deal between the initial winner and the Port Authority fell through, and he signed the lease on July 24, 2001.

Soon after the September 11 attacks, in 2001, Silverstein declared his intent to rebuild, though he and his insurers became embroiled in a multi-year dispute over whether the attacks had constituted one event or two under the terms of the insurance policy, which provided for a maximum of $3.55 billion coverage per event. A settlement was reached in 2007, with insurers agreeing to pay out $4.55 billion, which was not as much as Silverstein had sought. He also ran into multiple disputes with other parties in the rebuilding effort, including with the Port Authority. In an agreement reached in April 2006, Silverstein retained rights to build three office towers (150 Greenwich Street, 175 Greenwich Street, and 200 Greenwich Street), while One World Trade Center (previously referred to as the &quot;Freedom Tower&quot;) would be owned by the Port Authority, as would Tower Five, which it would have the option of leasing to a different private developer and having redesigned as a residential building.

==Early life and education==
Silverstein was born in Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, in 1931 into a Jewish family. Growing up, he enjoyed classical music and played the piano. He attended the High School of Music and Art in New York, and then New York University, graduating in 1952. During college, he worked at a summer camp, where he met his wife-to-be, Klara. They married in 1956, and had three children: Lisa, Roger and Sharon. His wife worked as a school teacher, supporting the family on her salary for the first few years of their marriage while Silverstein attended classes at Brooklyn Law School.

Silverstein became involved in real estate with his father, Harry G. Silverstein, and then with his friend and brother-in-law, Bernard H. Mendik. In 1957, they established Silverstein Properties, as Harry G. Silverstein &amp; Sons, and bought their first building in Manhattan. Mendik and Silverstein continued the business after the elder Silverstein&#x27;s death in 1966. In 1977, Mendik divorced Annette Silverstein Mendik, and the business partnership also ended at that time. Mendik cited disagreements over real estate strategies, as Mendik wanted to buy buildings while Silverstein wanted to build.

==Career==
Silverstein and Mendik remained involved in the real-estate industry, but in separate firms. By 1978, Silverstein owned five buildings on Fifth Avenue, as well as 44 Wall Street and a shopping center in Stamford, Connecticut. In 1980, he renovated the building at 11 West 42nd Street, and acquired the lease for the Equitable Building at 120 Broadway. In 1983, he sold the building at 711 Fifth Avenue to Coca-Cola for $57.6 million.

Also in 1980, Silverstein bought the building at 120 Wall Street, which was constructed in 1930. In 1991, he set aside 20 floors of 120 Wall Street to be leased by non-profit organizations, as an Association Center, with tax incentives for the tenants and bonds for Silverstein to undertake building renovations. By 1994, he had signed up 14 nonprofit tenants, and the building was nearly at capacity by 1997, with 38 nonprofit tenants including the National Urban League and the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America.

In 1980, Silverstein won a bid to lease and develop the last undeveloped parcel from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, to build the 47-story 7 World Trade Center.

===World Trade Center===

During the 1990s, New York was suffering from the effects of the 1987 stock market crash, which led to high vacancy rates at the World Trade Center. George Pataki became Governor of New York in 1995 on a campaign of cutting costs, including privatizing the World Trade Center. A sale of the property was considered too complex, so it was decided by the Port Authority to open a 99-year lease to competitive bidding.

In January 2001, Silverstein, via Silverstein Properties, made a $3.22 billion bid to lease-purchase the World Trade Center. He was outbid by $30 million by Vornado Realty, with Boston Properties and Brookfield Properties also competing for the lease. However, Vornado withdrew in March, giving Silverstein 14 days to negotiate a new bid. His negotiated bid was finalized on April 26, 2001, in partnership with Westfield America, Inc. and accepted on July 24, 2001. It was the first time in the complex&#x27;s 31-year history that it had changed management. After it withdrew, Vornado announced a deal with Bloomberg LP to finance Bloomberg&#x27;s new headquarters at 731 Lexington Avenue.

The lease agreement applied to One, Two, Four, and Five World Trade Center, and about of retail space. Silverstein put up $14 million of his own money to secure the deal. The agreement gave Silverstein, as leaseholder, the right and the obligation to rebuild the structures if they were destroyed.

====September 11 attacks====

Silverstein has said in interviews that he usually spent his mornings in breakfast meetings at Windows on the World on top of the World Trade Center North Tower, and with new tenants in the building. However, on the morning of September 11, 2001, his wife insisted he attend a medical appointment, inadvertently saving him from certain death.

All of the buildings at the World Trade Center were either destroyed or damaged beyond repair on September 11, 2001. After a protracted dispute with insurers over the amount of coverage for rebuilding World Trade Center buildings 1, 2, 4 and 5, a series of court decisions determined that a maximum of $4.55 billion was payable, and settlements were reached with the insurers in 2007.

====Insurance dispute====

The insurance policies for World Trade Center buildings 1 WTC, 2 WTC, 4 WTC and 5 WTC had a collective face amount of $3.55 billion. After the September 11 attacks, Silverstein sought to collect double the face amount (~$7.1 billion) on the basis that the two separate airplane strikes into two separate buildings constituted two occurrences within the meaning of the policies. The insurance companies took the opposite view, and the matter went to court. Based on differences in the definition of &quot;occurrence&quot; (the insurance policy term governing the amount of insurance) and uncertainties over which definition of &quot;occurrence&quot; applied, the court split the insurers into two groups for jury trials on the question of which definition of &quot;occurrence&quot; applied and whether the insurance contracts were subject to the &quot;one occurrence&quot; interpretation or the &quot;two-occurrence&quot; interpretation.

The first trial resulted in a verdict on April 29, 2004, that ten of the insurers in this group were subject to the &quot;one occurrence&quot; interpretation, so their liability was limited to the face value of those policies, and three insurers were added to the second trial group. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on one insurer, Swiss Reinsurance, at that time, but did so several days later on May 3, 2004, finding that the company was also subject to the &quot;one-occurrence&quot; interpretation. Silverstein appealed the Swiss Re decision, but he lost that appeal on October 19, 2006. The second trial resulted in a verdict on December 6, 2004, that nine insurers were subject to the &quot;two occurrences&quot; interpretation and, therefore, liable for a maximum of double the face value of those particular policies ($2.2 billion). The total potential payout, therefore, was capped at $4.577 billion for buildings 1, 2, 4, and 5. An appraisal followed to determine the value of the insured loss.

In July 2006, Silverstein and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey filed a lawsuit against some of its insurers, for refusing to waive requirements of the insurance contracts that Silverstein claimed were necessary to allow renegotiation of the original July 2001 World Trade Center leases. This litigation was settled, together with the federal lawsuits and appraisal (described in the prior paragraph), in a series of settlements announced on May 23, 2007. Silverstein&#x27;s lease with the Port Authority for the World Trade Center complex requires him to continue paying $102 million annually in base rent. He is applying insurance payments toward the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site.

In March 2007, Silverstein appeared at a rally of construction workers and public officials outside of an insurance industry conference to highlight what he describes as the failures of insurers Allianz &amp; Royal and Sun Alliance to pay $800 million in claims related to the attacks. Insurers cite an agreement to split payments between Mr. Silverstein and the Port Authority as a cause for concern.

====Rebuilding====

As leaseholder of buildings One, Two, Four and Five, Silverstein had the legal right to rebuild the buildings, including 1 World Trade Center at the World Trade Center site which would later be designated as building One. While the site remains unoccupied, he continues to pay $10 million per month in rent to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

After the September 11 attacks, the United States Congress approved $8 billion in tax-exempt Liberty Bonds to fund development in the private sector at lower-than-market interest rates. $3.4 billion remained unallocated in March 2006 designated for Lower Manhattan, with about half of the funds under the control of Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the other half under the control of former governor Pataki.

In April 2006, after several months of negotiation aimed toward permitting reconstruction to commence, Silverstein yielded some of his rights back to the Port Authority to facilitate rebuilding at the site. Silverstein ceded his rights to building One (and its pro-rata share of the above-noted Liberty Bond funds), and allocated a portion of the insurance proceeds to the rebuilding of building One in favor of the Port Authority. In return, the remaining pro-rata shares of the Liberty Bond funds were allocated to Silverstein Properties for purposes of rebuilding the remaining buildings, and government agencies are expected to be among their tenants.

The construction of One World Trade Center started on April 27, 2006. Lack of financing had prevented construction from commencing earlier. The proceeds of the insurance policies arising from the destruction of the previous buildings were insufficient to cover the cost of rebuilding all the insured buildings. The first rebuilt building in the World Trade Center complex, 7 World Trade Center, reopened on May 23, 2006, and by the end of September 2011, was fully leased. The second building, 4 World Trade Center, reopened on November 13, 2013. This was followed by One World Trade Center on November 3, 2014. 3 World Trade Center opened on June 11, 2018, while 2 World Trade Center has yet to be completed, having been delayed indefinitely because of the loss of a prospective anchor tenant.

In 2024, Silverstein released his memoir, &quot;The Rising: The Twenty-Year Battle to Rebuild the World Trade Center&quot;, about the events leading up to his purchase of the World Trade Center, his experiences on and subsequent to 9/11, and the circumstances surrounding the new construction on that site.

===Other projects===
While Silverstein is most famous for his involvement at the World Trade Center, his holdings include many other buildings in New York City, including 1177 Avenue of the Americas, 529 Fifth Avenue, and 570 Seventh Avenue.

Among his residential projects is an extensive complex that takes up the entire block between 42nd and 41st Street and between 11th and 12th Avenue in the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood. Projects on the block include One River Place which opened in 2001. In May 2009, the twin-towered Silver Towers opened. At 60 stories, it is the tallest rental building in New York.

Silverstein was also involved as a developer of the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., which is home to the Woodrow Wilson Center.

In November 2006, Silverstein agreed to buy the building at 99 Church Street from Moody&#x27;s for $170 million. Moody&#x27;s moved its headquarters two blocks west into Silverstein&#x27;s rebuilt 7 World Trade Center in 2007. The old building at 99 Church Street (between Barclay Street and Park Place, behind the Woolworth Building) was promptly razed to make way for Silverstein&#x27;s new project on the site. The 2008 plan proposed a 68-story, 912-foot tower, composed of a Four Seasons Hotel on the first 22 stories, and condominiums in the upper two-thirds. However, due to lack of financing, the project was on hold until 2013, and completed in 2016. The building, the tallest residential tower downtown, designed by Robert A. M. Stern and marketed as 30 Park Place, officially opened on October 5, 2016. Silverstein bought a $34 million penthouse on the 80th floor of the building, which overlooks the World Trade Center complex. He sold his previous apartment, custom designed by James Stewart Polshek at 500 Park Avenue, in January 2019.

One West End, a 42-story, 246-unit condominium tower designed by Pelli Clarke Pelli, opened in 2017. It was the first of five towers to open at the new Riverside Center megadevelopment on Manhattan&#x27;s far West Side, which Silverstein developed in partnership with the Elad Group.

In 1989 Silverstein proposed to members of the Israeli government that a free trade zone should be created within the Negev region of Israel. The project ultimately failed, but enjoyed popular support among leading Israeli political figures.

==Philanthropy==
Silverstein has been involved in his alma mater, as founder and chairman emeritus of New York University&#x27;s Real Estate Institute, and as a trustee of the New York University Medical Center and Health System. Silverstein also has served as chairman of the United Jewish Appeal in New York, the Realty Foundation, trustee of the Museum of Jewish Heritage, and treasurer of the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver. Silverstein is also a governor of The Real Estate Board of New York.

In 2012, Silverstein donated $5 million to Hunter College, his wife Klara&#x27;s alma mater, to fund the Klara and Larry Silverstein Student Success Center. Silverstein surprised Klara with the gift after she gave her farewell remarks as chairwoman of the Hunter College Foundation board of directors. That same year, he and Klara donated $5.25 million to New York University School of Medicine to create the Silverstein Scholarship Fund. On May 17, 2017, Silverstein delivered the keynote address to the School of Medicine&#x27;s graduating class, which included seven Silverstein Scholars.

<text>John Whitelocke (1757 – 23 October 1833) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator. He is known for leading the failed invasion of Buenos Aires and the forfeit of Montevideo to the Spanish by way of treaty.

==Military career==
Educated at Marlborough Grammar School and at Lewis Lochée&#x27;s military academy in Chelsea, Whitelocke entered the army in 1778 and served in Jamaica and in San Domingo. He was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Portsmouth and General Officer Commanding South-West District on 25 June 1799, commanding the garrison during the height of invasion scares in Britain. On 10 November 1804 he was made a lieutenant-general and inspector-general of recruiting, during a period of significant expansion of the British Army. In 1807 he was appointed to command an expedition to seize Buenos Aires from the Spanish Empire, which was in disarray due to events in Europe. The attack failed and the British surrendered after suffering &quot;the lamentable loss of a great proportion of the gallant army engaged in it.&quot; Whitelocke undertook negotiations with the opposing general, Santiago de Liniers, and having decided that the British position was untenable, signed the surrender and ordered the British forces to abandon Montevideo and return home later that year.

This proceeding was regarded with great disfavour by many under his command and the British Army and public, and its author was brought before a court-martial convened at The Royal Hospital in London in 1808. According to the judge-advocate presiding over the case, Whitelocke not only failed his objective of &quot;the reduction of the province of Buenos Ayres,&quot; but also defeated the British hopes of &quot;discovering new markets..., of giving a wider scope to the spirit and enterprise of our merchants, of opening new sources of treasure, and new fields for exertion in supplying either the rude wants of countries emerging from barbarism, or the artificial and increasing demands of luxury and refinement, in those remote quarters of the globe.&quot; On all the charges, except one, he was found guilty and he was dismissed from the service. He lived in retirement until his death at Hall Barn Park, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire on 23 October 1833.

<text>The Maison de la Chimie (&quot;the House of Chemistry&quot;) is an international conference center in Paris, France, located near the National Assembly.

The house is managed by a nonprofit association, La Fondation de la Maison de la Chimie. Its primary objective is to assist and help scientists and engineers working in the field of chemistry, through the organization of meetings, colloquia and conferences.

The house provides office space to various associations involved in scientific and technological fields. The headquarters of the Société Astronomique de France was located in the house from 1966 to 1974.

Halls and rooms are also rented for meetings whose topics lie outside the field of chemistry; these other usages actually represent 75% to 80% of the activity. Because of its central location in Paris, near the National Assembly and several ministries, the house is particularly sought for meetings with elected officials.

<doc id="637304" wikidata="Q6490847" url="?curid=637304" title="Larry Munson">
<text>Lawrence Harry Munson (September 28, 1922 – November 20, 2011) was an American sports announcer and talk show host. He was best known for handling radio play-by-play of the Georgia Bulldogs football games from 1966 to 2008. He also handled the play-by-play for UGA basketball and Atlanta Falcons radio broadcasts and hosted sports-related talk shows.

==Early life and career==
Originally from Minneapolis, Munson attended Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis and Minnesota State University Moorhead. While at MSUM, he played basketball as a center and guard and football as an end and tackle.

Munson served as a United States Army medic in an Army Hospital during World War II. Upon leaving the military, he spent all $200 of his mustering-out pay to enroll in a Minneapolis radio broadcasting school. His first job was at a Minneapolis arena announcing the names of boxers and wrestlers for $15 a week.

After an on-air job at the KDLR AM radio station in Devils Lake, North Dakota, Munson moved on to AM radio station KFBC in Cheyenne, Wyoming, as a sports reporter in 1946. At KFBC, Munson met and became friends with co-worker Curt Gowdy. At that time, Gowdy was also the football announcer for the Wyoming Cowboys. On January 1, 1946, Munson called the Sun Bowl between the University of Denver and the University of New Mexico for the Associated Broadcasting System. Later in 1946, Gowdy took a job in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, as the announcer for a minor league baseball team and successfully recommended Munson as his replacement for the Wyoming Cowboys job. When Gowdy became a New York Yankees announcer in 1948, he recommended Munson again to replace him in Oklahoma City. Gowdy would later become a national sportscaster for NBC and CBS.

Munson broadcast in Oklahoma until 1952 when he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, for an announcing job with the Nashville Vols minor league baseball team on AM radio station WKDA. During the baseball off-season, Munson convinced local Nashville radio station WSM (AM) to broadcast Vanderbilt Commodores men&#x27;s basketball games with himself as the announcer. The basketball broadcasts were immediately successful, and WSM added Vanderbilt Commodores football games to its schedule as well with Munson as the broadcaster. Munson, along with local sportsman Herman Waddell, created a local television show about hunting and fishing called &quot;The Rod &amp; Gun Club&quot; on NBC affiliate WSM-TV (now WSMV), a local Nashville station.

In 1966, the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball team hired Munson as part of their first broadcast team, after moving from Milwaukee to Atlanta.

The first year the Braves were in Atlanta, the television broadcasts were on WSB-TV. An occasional guest color commentator was former major leaguer Dizzy Dean. One memorable Friday night during a rain delay, Dean warbled several verses of the &quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot; and purchased peanuts from a vendor in the stands, much to Munson&#x27;s on-air amusement.

In March 1966, Munson was in West Palm Beach, Florida, for the Braves&#x27; spring training and read in the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot; that Georgia Bulldogs football radio announcer Ed Thilenius was resigning to become a broadcaster for the new Atlanta Falcons National Football League franchise. The next day, Munson called Georgia athletics director Joel Eaves to express his interest in the Georgia job, and Munson was hired shortly thereafter. Athens radio station WRFC held the broadcast contract and was the parent station for the Georgia Bulldogs. After announcing Braves games for the first two months of the baseball season, Munson returned to Nashville in June 1966 to continue &quot;The Rod &amp; Gun Club&quot; for Nashville&#x27;s WSM-TV, and prepare for his new role with the Bulldogs. For many years after joining the University of Georgia broadcasts, Munson would make the commute to Athens, Georgia for the weekend football games from his home in Nashville so that he could continue producing &quot;The Rod &amp; Gun Club&quot; during the week. During 1973, Munson was for a brief period news anchor for a rival Nashville TV station, WSIX-TV, now WKRN. His engineer for many years was L.H. Christian, the owner of WRFC radio, who ran the audio board out of personal interest and for fun; Christian was sometimes joined by Larry Melear or Everett Langford as engineer for the sports broadcasts. Munson continued to live in Nashville until 1978 when he moved to metro Atlanta, after joining the Georgia Radio Network as a reporter. Munson moved to Athens in 1997. On September 22, 2008, Larry announced his retirement from being the play-by-play announcer for the University of Georgia Bulldogs.

==Awards and recognition==
Munson has received numerous awards honoring his accomplishments. In 2003, he received the Chris Schenkel Award presented by the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall of Fame. Munson was inducted into the Georgia-Florida Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 2005. The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association awarded Munson its state-based Sportscaster of the Year Award on multiple occasions: 1960 (WSM, Nashville), 1963 (WSM), 1964 (WSM), 1965 (WSM) and 1969 (WSIX, Nashville) as the Tennessee Sportscaster of the year; 1967 (WSB, Atlanta), 1971 (WRFC, Athens), 1982 (Georgia Network, Atlanta), 2002 (WSB) as the Georgia Sportscaster of the year. In 2007, Munson was presented with an honorary varsity letter from the University of Georgia for his contributions to Bulldog football.

==Voice of the Bulldogs==
Munson&#x27;s gravelly voice was one of the most distinctive in all of U.S. sports announcing and was regarded as endearing by Georgia Bulldog fans. Unlike many of his peers, Munson avoided any pretense of journalistic objectivity or accuracy during his broadcasts. He was an unabashed Bulldog fan who almost always referred to the Bulldogs as &quot;we.&quot; However, despite his open and unashamed homerism, he generally espoused a dour or pessimistic view of the team. For that reason, his broadcasts were considered among the modern generation of sportscasters as not only acceptable, but sometimes even more authentic than contemporary sportscasting. His unique turns of phrase – which were virtually always made offhand – became a part of Bulldog fan vernacular.

==Later years==
Approaching his 85th birthday in 2007, Munson was in failing health and planned to call only UGA home games that season. Prior to the 2007 season, Munson had missed only one game as announcer, a 34–3 loss to Clemson on October 6, 1990: he was recuperating from back surgery and Dave O&#x27;Brien substituted. Munson also called the Georgia-Georgia Tech game which was at Georgia Tech in 2007.

In the spring of 2008, Munson suffered a subdural hematoma and required emergency surgery. After undergoing rehabilitation at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, his family announced that he would be returning to call the home games in the fall of 2008. However, on September 22, 2008, Munson and his family announced that he would be retiring from the booth effective immediately. The road crew of Scott Howard and former UGA quarterback Eric Zeier finished out the season calling all games on the Georgia Bulldogs Radio Network.

Munson also provided the voice of God in an episode of the Adult Swim original series &quot;Squidbillies&quot;.

Munson died in Athens on November 20, 2011, after complications from pneumonia. Some 3,500 fans attended a tribute ceremony at Sanford Stadium on December 10, 2011.

==Famous calls==
Some of Munson&#x27;s well known calls include:
*&quot;Appleby! The end around! Just stopped, planted his feet and threw it! And Washington caught it. Thinking of Montreal and the Olympics, and ran out of his shoes down the middle - 80 yards!

<doc id="637305" wikidata="Q6145447" url="?curid=637305" title="James Whitelocke">
<text>Sir James Whitelocke SL (28 November 1570 – 22 June 1632) was an English judge and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1610 and 1622.

==Early life==
Whitelocke was the younger of posthumous twin sons of Richard Whitelocke, a London merchant, by Joan Brockhurst, widow, daughter of John Colte of Little Munden, Hertfordshire. He was educated from 1575 at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, and on 11 June 1588, he was elected probationer at St. John&#x27;s College, Oxford. He matriculated on 12 July 1588, and was elected fellow of his college in November 1589. His tutors were Rowland Searchfield, in classics and logic, and Alberico Gentile in the civil law. He also studied Hebrew and other Semitic languages. He graduated bachelor in civil law on 1 July 1594. Among the contemporaries at Oxford with whom he formed lasting friendships were William Laud, Humphrey May, and Ralph Winwood. In London he moved in the circle of Sir Robert Bruce Cotton, and about in 1600 he joined the Society of Antiquaries. He pursued his professional studies first at New Inn, afterwards at the Middle Temple, where he was admitted on 2 March 1593, called to the bar in August 1600, elected bencher in Hilary term 1618–19, and reader in the following August.

==Under James I==
Whitelocke was appointed steward of the St. John&#x27;s College estates in 1601. He became recorder of Woodstock on 1 August 1606, steward of and counsel for Eton College on 6 December 1609, and joint steward of the Westminster College estates on 7 May 1610.

In 1610 Whitelocke was elected in a by-election as Member of Parliament for Woodstock. He took part in the debates on impositions in 1610. He also acted as the mouthpiece of the Commons on the presentation (24 May) of the remonstrance against the royal inhibition which terminated the discussion. The subsequent proceedings drew from him (2 July) a defence of the rights of the subject and delimitation of the royal prerogative which was long attributed to Henry Yelverton.

In 1613 Whitelocke&#x27;s opposition to the prerogative brought him into sharp collision with the crown. The administration of the navy stood in urgent need of reform, and in the winter of 1612–13 a preliminary step was taken by the issue of a commission investing the lord high admiral (Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham), Lord Chancellor Ellesmere, the lord privy seal and lord chamberlain with extraordinary powers for the investigation of abuses and the trial of offenders. As legal adviser to Sir Robert Mansell, who was interested in defeating the investigation, Whitelocke drew up a series of &#x27;exceptions&#x27; to the commission, in which he very strictly circumscribed the prerogative. A copy of the exceptions came into the hands of the crown lawyers, who at once suspected that they were Whitelocke&#x27;s. Evidence was wanting; but his contemporaneous opposition to the transfer of a cause in which he was retained from the chancery to the court of the Earl Marshal furnished a pretext for his committal to Fleet Prison (18 May); and he was not released until he had made full submission in writing (13 June).

In 1614 Whitelocke was re-elected MP for Woodstock in the Addled Parliament. He was nominated with Sir Thomas Crew and others to represent the Commons in the projected conference with the Lords. Because of the sudden dissolution on 7 June the conference never met and on the following day Whitelocke and his colleagues were summoned to the council chamber, and told to destroy the notes of their intended speeches. In disfavour at court, Whitelocke was compelled to surrender (18 November 1616) the reversion of the king&#x27;s bench enrolments&#x27; office which he held jointly with Robert Heath, by whom he was also defeated in the contest for the recordership of London in November 1618.
Meanwhile, however, his professional reputation and gains increased. In 1616 he purchased the estate of Fawley Court, Buckinghamshire. He was placed on the commission of the peace for Buckinghamshire on 27 November 1617, and for Oxfordshire on 7 May 1618. On 12 January 1619 he was appointed deputy &quot;custos rotulorum&quot; for the liberties of Westminster and St. Martin&#x27;s-le-Grand.

Whitelocke stood, on the whole, well with Francis Bacon, to whom he owed his investiture as serjeant-at-law on 29 June 1620 and subsequent advancement on 29 October. He was given in 1620 the then important position of chief justice of the court of session of the County Palatine of Chester and the great sessions of the counties of Montgomery, Denbigh, and Flint. He was knighted on 4 October 1620. Shortly afterwards he was elected recorder by each of the four boroughs of Bewdley in Worcestershire, Ludlow and Bishop&#x27;s Castle in Shropshire, and Poole, Cheshire. Differences with the president of the council in the Welsh marches (the Earl of Northampton) led to Whitelocke&#x27;s transfer from the Chester court to the king&#x27;s bench, where he was sworn in as justice on 18 October 1624. He had also a commission to hear causes in chancery, and sat once in the star-chamber. He was re-elected MP for Woodstock in 1621.

==Under Charles I==
He was continued in office by Charles I, and in the following autumn it fell to him, as junior judge in his court, to discharge the hazardous duty of adjourning term during the plague outbreak of 1625. To escape from the contagion he drove, halting only at Hyde Park Corner to dine, in his coach from Horton, near Colnbrook, Buckinghamshire, to Westminster Hall, and, after hurrying through the necessary forms, re-entered his coach and drove back to Horton.

In November 1626 Whitelocke concurred with Sir Ranulph Crew in declining to certify the legality of forced loans. In Darnell&#x27;s Case, however, he supported the Crown. The remand was not allowed to pass without the citation of the judges to the House of Lords to answer for their conduct. They obeyed, and through Whitelocke&#x27;s mouth glossed their order by representing it as only intended to allow time for further consideration.

In February 1629 the House of Commons enquired into the release of the supposed Jesuits recently discovered in Clerkenwell. Whitelocke, as one of the judges who had examined them, was cited to justify the release, which he did on the ground that there was no evidence that the prisoners were in priest&#x27;s orders. The stormy scenes which preceded the dissolution of this parliament (10 March) and the subsequent committal of Sir John Eliot and his friends to the Tower of London brought the judges once more into delicate relations both with the Crown and Parliament. The evasion by the three common-law chiefs of the issues submitted to them by the king (Whitelocke, Heath and John Walter) was followed by the reference of substantially the same questions to the entire common-law bench (25 April). The points of law were again evaded, but eleven out of the twelve judges sanctioned proceedings in the star-chamber; of the eleven, Whitelocke was one. He also concurred in the course taken after the argument upon the writs of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, the application by letter to the king for directions, and the remand of the prisoners pending his answer (June). At a private audience with the king at Hampton Court on Michaelmas day he obtained consent to the release of the prisoners on security given for their good behaviour, a concession which they unanimously rejected. On the trial Whitelocke concurred in the judgment.

Whitelocke was greatly interested in antiquarian studies, and was the author of several papers which are printed in Thomas Hearne&#x27;s &quot;Collection of Discourses&quot; (1771); his journal, or &quot;Liber famelicus&quot;, was edited by John Bruce and published by the Camden Society in 1858.

Whitelocke died at Fawley Court on 22 June 1632. His remains were interred in Fawley churchyard, with a marble monument. His estates were later exempted by the Long Parliament from liability to contribute to the fund for making reparation to Eliot and his fellow-sufferers.

==Family==
In 1602 Whitelocke married Elizabeth Bulstrode (1575-1631), a daughter of Edward Bulstrode of Hedgerley Bulstrode, Buckinghamshire. Two of her sisters, Dorothy and Cecily Bulstrode were gentlewomen in the bedchamber of Anne of Denmark Dorothy married Sir John Eyre in 1611 without her family&#x27;s consent, Eyre was a &quot;vicious reprobate&quot; according to Whitelocke. Another sister Anne Bulstrode (d. 1611) married the lawyer John Searl in 1609.

Whitelocke&#x27;s eldest son was the parliamentarian Sir Bulstrode Whitelocke (b. 1605). His son James was born in 1612. His daughter Elizabeth, born in 1603, married Thomas Mostyn in 1623, the others were; Mary (1606-1611); Cecilia born in March 1607; Joan in 1609 and died in 1610; Dorothy born and died in 1610.

Whitelocke&#x27;s twin brother, William, served under Francis Drake, and fell at sea in an engagement with the Spaniards. Of two other brothers, the elder, Edmund, was a courtier who was implicated in the Gunpowder Plot.

<text>Edmund Whitelocke (1565–1608) was an English soldier, royal courtier and suspected conspirator.

==Life==
He was born in the parish of St. Gabriel, Fenchurch Street, London, on 10 February 1565, the eldest son of Richard Whitelocke, a merchant. The judge Sir James Whitelocke was a younger brother. After being educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School under Richard Mulcaster, he was sent to Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he matriculated as a pensioner in November 1581, and graduated B.A. in 1585. His brother attests that he studied law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

At Whitsuntide 1587 Whitelocke left London on foreign tour. He visited universities in Germany, Italy, and France. Subsequently, he obtained a commission as captain of a troop of infantry from the governor of Provence (M. Desguieres), and was stationed successively at Marseilles and Grenoble; he saw some active service during the civil wars in France. He returned to England in 1599, was in attendance at Elizabeth&#x27;s court, and won a reputation for profuse display and dissolute living.

He was on terms of close intimacy with many of the younger nobility, including Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland, and other followers of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Rutland invited him to visit Essex&#x27;s house in London on 30 Jan. 1601, the day fixed for the Earl of Essex&#x27;s insurrection. He remained in the house only a few minutes, but he incurred a suspicion of disloyalty. He was arrested as an abettor of Essex&#x27;s rebellion, and was indicted of high treason, but, though brought before the court of king&#x27;s bench, was not tried, but allowed to go on parole before he obtained a final discharge. Subsequently, he came to know Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, whom he supported in his quarrel with Sir Francis Vere in 1602. A challenge which Whitelocke carried from the earl to Sir Francis led to the issue of a warrant by the privy council for his arrest; but Whitelocke went into hiding, and escaped capture for the time.

He happened, however, to dine with the Earl of Northumberland and his kinsman Thomas Percy on 4 November 1605, the day before the Gunpowder Plot. Suspicion again fell on Whitelocke, and, with his host, suffered a long imprisonment in the Tower of London. No evidence was produced against him, and he was released without trial. While a prisoner in the Tower he spent much time with Northumberland, who granted him a pension. Another of Whitelocke&#x27;s friends was Robert Radcliffe, 5th Earl of Sussex. John Manningham the diarist attributes to Whitelocke&#x27;s influence Radcliffe&#x27;s neglect of his wife. Whitelocke was on a visit to the Earl of Sussex at Newhall, Essex in the autumn of 1608 when he was taken ill and died. He was buried in the family tomb of his host at Boreham.

<doc id="637310" wikidata="Q2354535" url="?curid=637310" title="Japanese submarine I-25">
<text>was a B1 type (&quot;I-15&quot;-class) submarine of the Imperial Japanese Navy that served in World War II, took part in the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and was the only Axis submarine to carry out aerial bombing on the continental United States in World War II, during the so-called Lookout Air Raids, and the shelling of Fort Stevens, both attacks occurring in the state of Oregon.

&quot;I-25&quot;, displaced 2584 long tons surfaced and 3654 long tons submerged and was long, with a range of , a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . She carried a two-seater Yokosuka E14Y reconnaissance floatplane, known to the Allies as &quot;Glen&quot;. It was disassembled and stowed in a hangar in front of the conning tower.

==First patrol==
In World War II, &quot;I-25&quot; served under the command of Lieutenant Commander Akiji Tagami who had graduated from Class 51 at Etajima, Hiroshima. 26-year-old Lieutenant Tatsuo Tsukudo was the executive officer(XO) on &quot;I-25&quot;. &quot;I-25&quot; departed Yokosuka on 21 November 1941 in preparation for hostilities.

&quot;I-25&quot; and three other submarines patrolled a line north of Oahu during the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor. After the Japanese aircraft carriers sailed west following the attack, &quot;I-25&quot; and eight other submarines sailed eastwards to patrol the west coast of the United States. &quot;I-25&quot; patrolled off the mouth of the Columbia River. A scheduled shelling of American coastal cities on Christmas eve of 1941 was canceled because of the frequency of coastal air and surface patrols.

&quot;I-25&quot; attacked SS &quot;Connecticut&quot; off the US coast. The damaged tanker managed to escape but ran aground at the mouth of the Columbia River. &quot;I-25&quot; then returned to Kwajalein, arriving on 11 January 1942 to refuel and be refurbished.

==Second patrol==
&quot;I-25&quot; left Kwajalein atoll in the Marshall Islands on 5 February for its next operational patrol in the south Pacific. Tagami&#x27;s orders were to reconnoitre the Australian harbours of Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart followed by the New Zealand harbours of Wellington and Auckland.

&quot;I-25&quot; travelled on the surface for nine days, but as she approached the Australian coastline, she only travelled on the surface under the cover of night.

On Saturday 14 February, &quot;I-25&quot; was within a few miles of the coast near Sydney. The searchlights in Sydney could clearly be seen from the bridge of &quot;I-25&quot;. Tagami then took &quot;I-25&quot; to a position south east of Sydney.
A number of days of rough swell prevented an immediate launch of the &quot;Glen&quot; floatplane. They stayed submerged during the day and went back to the surface at night. Finally on Tuesday, 17 February, Warrant Flying Officer Nobuo Fujita took off in the &quot;Glen&quot; for a reconnaissance flight over Sydney Harbour. The purpose was to look at Sydney&#x27;s airbase. By 0730, Fujita had returned to &quot;I-25&quot; and disassembled the &quot;Glen&quot; and stowed it in the watertight hangar. Commander Tagami then pointed &quot;I-25&quot; southwards on the surface at . By midday on Wednesday 18 February, they were nearly south east of Sydney still heading southwards.

Their next mission was a similar flight over Melbourne. Tagami decided to launch the aircraft from Cape Wickham at the northern end of King Island at the western end of Bass Strait about halfway between Victoria and Tasmania. The floatplane was launched on 26 February for its reconnaissance flight to Melbourne over Port Phillip Bay.

Fujita&#x27;s next reconnaissance flight in Australia was over Hobart on 1 March. &quot;I-25&quot; then headed for New Zealand where Fujita flew another reconnaissance flight over Wellington on 8 March. Fujita next flew over Auckland on 13 March, followed by Fiji on 17 March.

&quot;I-25&quot; returned to its base at Kwajalein on 31 March and then proceeded to Yokosuka for refit. &quot;I-25&quot; was in Yokosuka drydock number 5 on 18 April 1942 when one of the Doolittle Raid B-25 Mitchell bombers damaged Japanese aircraft carrier Ryūhō in adjacent drydock number 4.

==Third patrol==
While outbound past the Aleutian Islands for a third war patrol off the west coast of North America, &quot;I-25&quot;″s Glen seaplane overflew United States military installations on Kodiak Island. The surveillance on 21 May 1942 was in preparation for the northern diversion of the Battle of Midway.

Shortly after midnight on 20 June 1942, &quot;I-25&quot; torpedoed the new, coal-burning Canadian freighter SS &quot;Fort Camosun&quot; off the coast of Washington. The freighter was bound for England with a cargo of war production materials including zinc, lead, and plywood. One torpedo struck the port side below the bridge and flooded the 2nd and 3rd cargo holds. Canadian corvettes and reached the stricken freighter after dawn and rescued the crew from lifeboats. &quot;Fort Camosun&quot; was towed back into Puget Sound for repairs, and later survived a second torpedo attack by &quot;I-27&quot; in the Gulf of Aden in the fall of 1943.

On the evening of 21 June 1942, &quot;I-25&quot; followed a fleet of fishing vessels to avoid minefields near the mouth of the Columbia River, in Oregon. &quot;I-25&quot; fired seventeen 14-cm (5.5-inch) shells at Battery Russell, a small coastal army installation within Fort Stevens which was later decommissioned. Fort Stevens was equipped with two 10-inch disappearing guns, some 12-inch mortars, 75 mm field guns, .50-caliber machine guns, and associated searchlights, observation posts, and secret radar capability. Damage was minimal. In fact, the only items of significance damaged on the fort were a baseball backstop and some power and telephone lines.
The incoming shell fire had a highly stimulative effect on the personnel at Battery Russell. Men leaped out of bed, crashing into things in the dark—turning on a light would be unthinkable—as they scrambled to battle stations in their underwear.

&quot;We looked like hell,&quot; Capt. Jack R. Wood, commander of the battery, told historian Bert Webber later. &quot;But we were ready to shoot back in a couple of minutes.&quot;

But when gunners requested permission to open fire, they were firmly refused. In part, this was because the submarine&#x27;s location remained uncertain because of difficulties evaluating reports from different observation points; it was, after all, from shore. Furthermore, authorities later stated they wished to avoid revealing the locations of their guns to what they believed to be a reconnaissance mission. The sub may also have been out of range of Battery Russell&#x27;s artillery; the mechanism used with the 10-inch disappearing guns limited their upward travel, which limited their effective range to less than . If the guns opened fire, the sub would be able to report back to Tokyo that a fleet of surface ships could simply heave to, from shore, and pound Battery Russell with impunity, then sail right on into the Columbia—where, among other valuable targets, upstream at Portland, Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation, one of Henry Kaiser&#x27;s shipyards, was cranking out Liberty ships at a rate of more than one a week. This, obviously, was not something the Navy could take a chance on.

In the end, Battery Russell sat there and absorbed the fire without a single shot in reply. It was a turning point for American coastal artillery, and the failure to respond caused re-evaluation of men and artillery allocated to coastal defense.

==Fourth patrol==
Following his successful observation flights on the second and third patrols, Warrant Officer Nubuo Fujita was specifically chosen for a special incendiary bombing mission to create forest fires in North America. &quot;I-25&quot; left Yokosuka on 15 August 1942 carrying six incendiary bombs. On 9 September, the crew again deployed the &quot;Glen&quot;, which dropped two bombs over forest land near Brookings, Oregon. This attack by an enemy airplane was later called the &quot;Lookout Air Raids&quot;, and was the &quot;only&quot; time that the mainland United States was ever bombed by enemy aircraft and the second continental territory to be bombed as such during wartime, after the bombing of Dutch Harbor in Unalaska, Alaska.

Warrant Officer Fujita&#x27;s mission had been to trigger wildfires across the coast; at the time, the Tillamook Burn incidents of 1933 and 1939 were well known, as was the destruction of the city of Bandon, Oregon by a smaller out-of-control wildfire in 1936. But light winds, wet weather conditions and two quick-acting fire lookouts kept the fires under control. In fact, had the winds been sufficiently brisk to stoke widespread forest fires, the lightweight Glen may have had difficulty navigating through the bad weather. Shortly after the Glen seaplane had landed and been disassembled for storage, &quot;I-25&quot; was bombed at by a United States Army A-29 Hudson piloted by Captain Jean H. Daugherty from McChord Field near Tacoma, Washington. The Hudson carried general-purpose demolition bombs with delayed fuzes rather than depth charges. The bombs caused minor damage, but quick response by a Coast Guard cutter and three more aircraft caused &quot;I-25&quot; to be more cautious on a second bombing raid on 29 September 1942. The Glen seaplane was assembled and launched in pre-dawn darkness using Cape Blanco Light as a reference. The plane was heard at 0522 by a work crew at the Grassy Knob Lookout east of Port Orford, Oregon; but fire crews from the Gold Beach Ranger Station were unable to locate any evidence of the two incendiary bombs dropped. The Glen seaplane was again recovered, but &quot;I-25&quot; decided not to risk a third flight with the two remaining incendiary bombs. Captain Tagami took I-25 to rest &quot;...on the bottom [of the harbor of Port Orford ] until night time.

At 0415 4 October 1942 &quot;I-25&quot; torpedoed the tanker &quot;Camden&quot; en route from San Pedro, California, to Puget Sound with a cargo of of gasoline. The damaged tanker was towed to the mouth of the Columbia River. When its draft was discovered to be too great to reach repair facilities in Portland, Oregon, another tow was arranged to Puget Sound; but the tanker was destroyed on 10 October by a fire of unknown origin during the second tow.

On the evening of 5 October 1942 &quot;I-25&quot; torpedoed the Richfield Oil Company tanker &quot;Larry Doheny&quot;, which sank the next day. The cargo of of oil was lost with 2 of the tanker&#x27;s crew and 4 members of the United States Navy Armed Guard. Survivors reached Port Orford, Oregon on the evening of 6 October.

Two submarines were sighted on 11 October 1942 about off the coast of Washington as &quot;I-25&quot; was returning to Japan. &quot;I-25&quot; fired its last torpedo at the lead submarine, which sank in 20 seconds with the loss of all hands. &quot;I-25&quot; reported sinking a U.S. submarine, but the submarine was actually Soviet &quot;L-16&quot; which was sailing with &quot;L-15&quot; en route from Vladivostok to the Panama Canal via Unalaska, Alaska, and San Francisco. United States Navy Chief Photographer&#x27;s Mate Sergi Andreevich Mihailoff of Arcadia, California, was aboard &quot;L-16&quot; as a liaison officer and interpreter, and was killed with the remainder of the submarine crew. The United States Navy Western Sea Frontier denied loss of any submarine and withheld information about the Soviet loss because, at the time, the Soviet Union was officially neutral in the war between Japan and the United States.

SS &quot;H.M. Storey&quot; was bringing fuel oil from Noumea, New Caledonia, in the South Pacific Ocean to Los Angeles. On May 17, 1943, &quot;I-25&quot; torpedoed and fired shells at the ship. The attack killed two of the crew; 63 of the crew made it in to the ship&#x27;s lifeboats before she sank. US destroyer USS &quot;Fletcher&quot; rescued the crew in the lifeboats and took them to Port Vila Efate, Vanuatu, in the South Pacific.

===1942 North American west coast===
==Loss==
&quot;I-25&quot; was sunk less than a year later by one or more of the destroyers , , or which were involved in a series of naval engagements from late August to mid September 1943 off the New Hebrides islands, approximately northeast of Espiritu Santo. Which American ship sank the &quot;I-25&quot; (or any of the other IJN submarines in the vicinity) remains unknown. On 24 October 1943, the Imperial Japanese Navy announced that &quot;I-25&quot; was presumed lost with all 100 men on board in the Fiji area, and it was struck from the Navy List on 1 December 1943.

<doc id="637311" wikidata="Q1091018" url="?curid=637311" title="Bohemian Club">
<text>The Bohemian Club is a private club with two locations: a city clubhouse in the Nob Hill district of San Francisco, California, and the Bohemian Grove, a retreat north of the city in Sonoma County. Founded in 1872 from a regular meeting of journalists, artists, and musicians, it soon began to accept businessmen and entrepreneurs as permanent members, as well as offering temporary membership to university presidents (notably Berkeley and Stanford) and military commanders who were serving in the San Francisco Bay Area. Today, the club has a membership of many local and global leaders, ranging from artists and musicians to businessmen. Membership is restricted to men only.

==Clubhouse==

The City Club is located in a six-story masonry building at the corner of Post Street and Taylor Street, two blocks west of Union Square, and on the same block as both the Olympic Club and the Marines Memorial Club. The clubhouse contains dining rooms, meeting rooms, a bar, a library, an art gallery, a theater, and guest rooms.

===Bohemian Grove===
Every year, the club hosts a two-week-long (three weekends) camp at Bohemian Grove, which is notable for its illustrious guest list and its eclectic &quot;Cremation of Care&quot; ceremony which mockingly burns an effigy of &quot;Care&quot; (the normal woes of life) with grand pageantry, pyrotechnics, and brilliant costumes, all done at the edge of a lake and at the base of a forty-foot &quot;stone&quot; owl statue (actually made of concrete). In addition to that ceremony, devised by co-founder James F. Bowman in 1881, there are also two outdoor performances (dramatic and comedic plays), often with elaborate set design and orchestral accompaniment. The more elaborate of the two is the Grove Play, or &quot;High Jinks&quot;; the more ribald is called &quot;Low Jinks&quot;. More often than not, the productions are original creations of the Associate members, but active participation of hundreds of members of all backgrounds is traditional.

=== Nathanial Brittan Party House ===

Nathaniel J. Brittan co-founded the Bohemian Club of San Francisco in 1872 and by 1892 was the president of the club. He built the Nathanial Brittan Party House in San Carlos, California, in order to entertain his friends from the club and to use as a hunting lodge.

==History==

===Bohemianism===

In New York City and other American metropolises in the late 1850s, groups of young, cultured journalists flourished as self-described &quot;bohemians&quot;, until the American Civil War broke them up and sent them out as war correspondents. During the war, reporters began to assume the title &quot;bohemian&quot;, and newspapermen in general took up the moniker. &quot;Bohemian&quot; became synonymous with &quot;newspaper writer&quot;. California journalist Bret Harte first wrote as &quot;The Bohemian&quot; in &quot;The Golden Era&quot; in 1861, with this persona taking part in many satirical doings. Harte described San Francisco as a sort of Bohemia of the West. Mark Twain called himself and poet Charles Warren Stoddard bohemians in 1867.

===Founding===
The Bohemian Club was originally formed in April 1872 by and for journalists who wished to promote a fraternal connection among men who enjoyed the arts. Michael Henry de Young, proprietor of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, provided this description of its formation in a 1915 interview:

Journalists were to be regular members; artists and musicians were to be honorary members. The group quickly relaxed its rules for membership to permit some people to join who had little artistic talent, but enjoyed the arts and had greater financial resources. Eventually, the original &quot;bohemian&quot; members were in the minority and the wealthy and powerful controlled the club. Club members who were established and successful, respectable family men, defined for themselves their own form of bohemianism, which included men who were , sometime outdoorsmen, and appreciators of the arts. Club member and poet George Sterling responded to this redefinition:

 Despite his purist views, Sterling associated very closely with the Bohemian Club and caroused with artist and industrialist alike at the Bohemian Grove.

Oscar Wilde, upon visiting the club in 1882, is reported to have said, &quot;I never saw so many well-dressed, well-fed, business-looking Bohemians in my life.&quot;

===Membership===
A number of past membership lists are in the public domain, but modern club membership lists are private. Some prominent figures have been given honorary membership, such as Richard Nixon and William Randolph Hearst. Members have included some U.S. presidents (usually before they are elected to office), many cabinet officials, and CEOs of large corporations, including major financial institutions. Major military contractors, oil companies, banks (including the Federal Reserve), utilities, and national media have high-ranking officials as club members or guests. Many members are, or have been, on the board of directors of several of these corporations; however, artists and lovers of art are among the most active members. The club&#x27;s bylaws require ten percent of the membership be accomplished artists of all types (composers, musicians, singers, actors, lighting artists, painters, authors, etc.). During the first half of the 20th century, membership in the club was especially valued by painters and sculptors, who exhibited their work on the premises, in both permanent displays and special exhibitions, and did not pay any commissions on sales to members. Many of the club&#x27;s artists were nationally recognized figures, such as William Keith, Arthur Frank Mathews, Xavier Martinez, Jules Eugene Pages, Edwin Deakin, William Ritschel, Jo Mora, Maynard Dixon, and Arthur Putnam.

The club motto is &quot;Weaving Spiders Come Not Here&quot;, a line taken from Act 2, Scene 2, of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. The club motto implies that outside concerns and business deals are to be left outside. When gathered in groups, Bohemians usually adhere to the injunction, though discussion of business often occurs between pairs of members.

==Bret Harte Memorial==

A bronze relief by Jo Mora is installed on the exterior of the building. It serves as a memorial to author and poet Bret Harte. The relief, which is by by , was first dedicated on August 15, 1919, as a tribute by Mora, who was a member, to fellow Bohemian Club member Harte. The relief shows fifteen characters from books by Harte. It is inscribed:

Proper left, upper corner:
Proper left, lower edge:
Top center wreath:
followed by the founder&#x27;s mark for L. De Rome. When the original building was torn down, the relief was removed. In 1934, it was reinstalled on the building that stands today.

<text>In solar physics, Spörer&#x27;s law is an empirical law for the variation of heliographic latitudes at which solar active regions form during a solar cycle. It was discovered by the English astronomer Richard Christopher Carrington around 1861. Carrington&#x27;s work was refined by the German astronomer Gustav Spörer.

At the start of a solar cycle, active regions tend to appear around 30° to 45° latitude on the Sun&#x27;s surface. As the cycle progresses, they appear at lower and lower latitudes, until they average 15° at solar maximum. The average latitude then continues to drift lower, down to about 7° and then while the old sunspot cycle fades, active regions of the new cycle start appearing at high latitudes.

<text>Richard Cockburn Maclaurin ( ; June 5, 1870 – January 15, 1920) was a Scottish-born U.S. educator and mathematical physicist. He was made president of MIT in 1909, and held the position until his death in 1920.

During his tenure as president of MIT, the Institute moved across the Charles River from Boston to its present campus in Cambridge. In Maclaurin&#x27;s honor, the buildings that surround Killian Court on the oldest part of the campus are sometimes called the Maclaurin Buildings.

Earlier, he was a foundation professor of the then Victoria College of the University of New Zealand from 1899 to 1907. A collection of lecture theatres at the Kelburn campus of that university were named after him. He was also a professor at Columbia University from 1907 to 1908.

==Personal==
Maclaurin was born in Scotland, and was related to the noted Scottish mathematician Colin Maclaurin. He emigrated to New Zealand with his family at the age of four. In 1904 he married Alice Young of Auckland, and they had two sons. His brother James Scott Maclaurin (1864–1939) was a noted chemist, who invented a process for extracting gold with cyanide.

<text>Mary Teresa Slaney (formerly Tabb, née Decker, born August 4, 1958) is an American retired middle-distance and long-distance runner. During her career, she won gold medals in the 1500 meters and 3000 meters at the 1983 World Championships and was the world-record holder in the mile, 5000 meters and 10,000 meters. In total, she set 17 official and unofficial world records, and she was the first woman to break 4:20 for the mile. She also set 36 U.S. national records at distances ranging from 800 meters to 10,000 meters, and has held the U.S. record in the 2000 meters and 3000 meters since the early 1980s, while her 1500 meters record stood for 32 years and her mile record stood for 38 years. In 2003, she was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame. She was retroactively banned for two years from June 1996 for a doping violation for a high testosterone to epitestosterone ratio.

==Early life==
Decker was born in Bunnvale, New Jersey. A decade later, her family moved to Garden Grove in Southern California, where Decker started running. A year later at the age of 11, she won her first local competition.

She joined her school athletics club and a local track club and completely immersed herself in running. At age 12, she completed a marathon and four middle- and long-distance races in one week, ending the week with an appendectomy operation.

==Career==
In her early teens, Decker was already recognized as a world-class runner. Unable to attend the 1972 Olympics as she was too young at 14, Decker, who ran wearing pigtails and at the weight of , won international acclaim in 1973 with a win in the 800 meters at a U.S.-USSR meet in Minsk, beating the reigning Olympic silver medalist Nijolė Sabaitė.

In 1973, she set her first world record, running an indoor mile in 4:40.1. By 1974, Decker was the world indoor record holder with 2:02.4 for 880 yards, and 2:01.8 for 800 meters.

By the end of 1974, Decker had developed a case of the muscle condition compartment syndrome. This resulted in a series of injuries that prevented her from competing in the 1976 Summer Olympics because of stress fractures in her lower leg. In 1978, she underwent an operation to address her compartment syndrome, which kept her out of competition for a period. After recovering from surgery, she spent two seasons at the University of Colorado at Boulder on a track scholarship. In 1979, she became the second American woman (the first was Francie Larrieu) to break the 4:30 mile. Decker was the first woman to break the 4:20 barrier for the mile in 1980 when she ran it in 4:17.55. However, this time was never ratified by the IAAF. Decker did not compete at the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics because of the American boycott. However, she received one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the American athletes.

In 1981, Decker married fellow American distance runner Ron Tabb. The couple divorced in 1983. In 1982, under the name Mary Tabb, she ran the mile in 4:18.08, breaking the official record of 4:20.89 by the Lyudmila Veselkova of the USSR, and this time was ratified.

===Career peak===
In 1982 Decker-Tabb set six world records at distances ranging from the mile run to 10,000 meters. She received the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States.

The following year she achieved the &quot;Double Decker,&quot; winning both the 1500 meters and 3000 meters events at the World Championships in Helsinki, Finland. Her history of relatively easy wins in the United States left her tactical abilities suspect in Helsinki, as she chose not to run in close order because so few athletes could keep up with her, a situation that the Soviet runners hoped to use to their advantage. Her wins against Soviet World Record holders proved a redemption of her competitive guile. After her double win she won the Jesse Owens Award from USA Track and Field and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine named her Sportsperson of the Year. Shortly before her World Championship victories, Decker improved her U.S. 1500 meters record to 3:57.12 in Stockholm on July 26, 1983. This record stood for 32 years until Shannon Rowbury ran 3:56.29 on July 17, 2015.

==The 1984 Olympic incident==

Decker was heavily favored to win a gold medal in the 3000 meters run at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In the final, barefoot runner Zola Budd, representing Great Britain, had been running even with Decker for three laps and then moved ahead. In an attempt to place pressure on Budd, Decker remained close by in a crowded space. However, Decker collided with Budd and fell to the curb, injuring her hip, and she did not finish the race, which was won by Maricica Puică of Romania (Budd finished seventh). Decker was carried from the track in tears by her boyfriend (and later husband), British discus thrower Richard Slaney. At a press conference, she pinned the blame for the collision on Budd. While it is generally the trailing runner&#x27;s responsibility to avoid contact with the runner ahead, it is also an accepted convention among most distance runners that the leader should be at least one full stride ahead before the trailing runner moves directly behind her. International track officials initially disqualified Budd for obstruction, but she was reinstated just one hour later after officials viewed films of the race. Despite the fact that she had been running behind Budd, Decker&#x27;s claim that Budd had bumped into her leg was supported by a number of sports journalists. The claim was not accepted by the director of the games or by the IAAF.

Decker and Budd next met in July 1985 for a 3000-meter race at Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London. Decker won the race, and Budd finished in fourth place. After the race, the women shook hands and reconciled. Decker later claimed that she was robbed of the 1984 Olympics 3000-meter gold medal by Budd, but many years after the event said: &quot;The reason I fell, some people think she tripped me deliberately. I happen to know that wasn&#x27;t the case at all. The reason I fell is because I am and was very inexperienced in running in a pack.&quot; Budd and Decker later reunited for a 2016 documentary about the incident, &quot;The Fall&quot;.

Decker had a successful 1985 season, winning 12-mile and 3000-meter races in Europe, including a new official world record for the women&#x27;s mile of 4:16.71 in Zurich (Natalya Artyomova&#x27;s 4:15.8 in 1984 was not ratified by the IAAF), a race in which she beat both Budd and Puică. Since that race in 1985, Decker&#x27;s time has only been bettered four times.
Decker missed the 1986 season to give birth to her only child, and then missed the 1987 season because of injury. She qualified for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, competing at 1500 meters and 3000 meters, but finished in 8th and 10th respectively, failing to win a medal. She did not qualify for the 1992 Summer Olympics.

==Doping controversy==
In 1996, at the age of 37, as she qualified for the 5000 meters at the Atlanta Olympics, a urine test taken in June at the Olympic trials showed a testosterone to epitestosterone (T/E) ratio greater than the allowable maximum of 6:1. At the time of the positive test, Decker was being coached by Alberto Salazar.

Decker and her lawyers contended that the T/E ratio test is unreliable for women, especially women in their late 30s or older who take birth-control pills. In the meantime, Decker was eliminated in the heats at the Olympics.

In June 1997, the IAAF banned Decker from competition. In September 1999, a USATF panel reinstated her. The IAAF cleared her to compete but took the case to arbitration. In April 1999, the arbitration panel ruled against Decker, and although she was cleared to compete, the IAAF instituted a retroactive ban of two years from June 17, 1996 that stripped her of the silver medal that she had won in the 1500-meter race at the 1997 World Indoor Championships.

In April 1999, Decker filed suit against both the IAAF and the U.S. Olympic Committee that had administered the test, arguing that the test is flawed and cannot distinguish between androgens caused by the use of banned substances and those resulting from the use of birth-control pills. The court ruled that it had no jurisdiction, and the decision was upheld on appeal.

The T/E test threshold has since been tightened to a 4:1 ratio, and laboratories now also run a carbon isotope ratio test (CIR) if the T/E ratio is unusually high.

==Later life==
Throughout her later career, Decker had suffered a series of stress-induced fractures. After the loss of her 1999 legal case, she underwent more than 30 orthopedic procedures, mainly on her legs and feet, in an attempt to enable her to run competitively in marathons. However, after the surgeries, she continued to experience injuries. As a result, she retired with her husband to a property in Eugene, Oregon, where she jogs every other day.

<text>The Jewish Combat Organization (, ŻOB; &quot;Yidishe Kamf Organizatsie&quot;; often translated to English as the Jewish Fighting Organization) was a World War II resistance movement in occupied Poland, which was central in organizing and launching the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. ŻOB took part in a number of other resistance activities as well.

==Offshoot of Jewish youth groups==
The ŻOB was formed on 28 July 1942, six days after the German Nazis under SS General Jurgen Stroop began the &quot;Grossaktion&quot; Warsaw sealing the fate of the Jews confined in the Warsaw Ghetto: &quot;All Jewish persons living in Warsaw, regardless of age and gender, [would] be resettled in the East.&quot; Thus began massive &quot;deportations&quot; of about 254,000 Jews, all of whom were sent to the Treblinka extermination camp. The &quot;Grossaktion&quot; lasted until 12 September 1942. Overall it reduced the once thriving Warsaw Jewish community of some 400,000 to a mere 55,000 to 60,000 inhabitants.

The youth groups that were instrumental in forming the ŻOB had anticipated German intentions to annihilate Warsaw Jewry and began to shift from an educational and cultural focus to self-defense and eventual armed struggle.

Unlike the older generation, the youth groups took these reports seriously and had no illusions about the true intentions of the Germans. A document published three months before the start of the deportations by Hashomer Hatzair declared: &quot;We know that Hitler&#x27;s system of murder, slaughter and robbery leads steadily to a dead end and the destruction of the Jews.&quot;

A number of the left Zionist youth groups, such as Hashomer Hatzair and Dror, proposed the creation of a self-defense organization at a meeting of Warsaw Jewish leaders in March 1942. The proposal was rejected by the Jewish Labour Bund who believed that a fighting organization would fail without the help of the Polish resistance. Others rejected the notion of armed insurgency saying that there was no evidence of a threat of deportation. Moreover, they argued any armed resistance would provoke the Germans to retaliate against the whole Jewish community.

In November 1942, ŻOB officially became part of and subordinated its activities to the High Command of the Armia Krajowa. In return the Home Army (&quot;Armia Krajowa&quot;) began providing ŻOB with weapons and training, with the first shipment of guns and ammunition being provided in December 1942. The organization was spied upon by Jewish collaborators with the Nazis called the Society of Free Jews (&quot;Towarzystwo Wolnych Żydow&quot;).

==ŻOB resistance to the second deportation==
On 18 January 1943, the Nazis began a second wave of deportations. The first Jews the Germans rounded up included a number of ŻOB fighters who had intentionally crept into the column of deportees. Led by Mordechai Anielewicz they waited for the appropriate signal, then stepped out of formation, and fought the Nazis with small arms. The column scattered and news of the ŻZW and ŻOB action quickly spread throughout the ghetto. During this small deportation, the Nazis only managed to round up about 5,000 to 6,000 Jews.

The deportations lasted four days during which the Germans met other acts of resistance from the ŻOB. When they left the ghetto on 22 January 1943, the remaining Jews regarded it as a victory, however Israel Gutman, a member of the ŻOB who subsequently became one of the leading authors on Jewish Warsaw wrote, &quot;It [was] not known [to the Jews] that the Germans had not intended to liquidate the entire ghetto by means of the January deportations.&quot; However, Gutman concludes that the &quot;[January] deportations... had a decisive influence on the ghetto&#x27;s last months.&quot;

==Final deportation and uprising==


The final deportation began on the eve of Passover, 19 April 1943. The streets of the ghetto were vacant; most of the remaining 30,000 Jews were hiding in carefully prepared bunkers including their headquarters located in Ulica Miła 18, many of which had electricity and running water, however they offered no route of escape.

When the Germans marched into the ghetto, they met fierce armed resistance from fighters attacking from open windows in vacated apartments. The defenders of the ghetto used guerrilla warfare tactics and had the strategic advantage not only of surprise but also of being able to look down on their opponents. This advantage was lost when the Germans began systematically burning all of the buildings of the ghetto forcing the fighters to seek cover in the underground bunkers. The fires above consumed much of the available oxygen below ground, turning the bunkers into suffocating death traps.

On May 8 in the bunker at 18 Mila Street, Jurek Wilner called on the fighters to commit mass suicide to avoid falling into Germans&#x27; hands. As the first one, Lutek Rotblat initially shot his mother and then himself. In the bunker most of the members of the Combat Organization found their deaths, including Commander Mordechaj Anielewicz.

By 16 May 1943, the German Police General Jürgen Stroop, who had been in charge of the final deportation, officially declared what he called the &quot;Grossaktion&quot;, finished. To celebrate he razed Warsaw&#x27;s Great Synagogue. The ghetto was destroyed and what remained of the uprising was suppressed.
==Epilogue==

Even after the destruction of the ghetto, small numbers of Jews could still be found in the underground bunkers on both sides of the ghetto wall. In fact, during the last months of the ghetto some 20,000 Jews fled to the Aryan side. Some Jews who escaped the final destruction of the ghetto, including youth group members and leaders Kazik Ratajzer, Zivia Lubetkin, Yitzhak Zuckerman and Marek Edelman, would participate in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis. 

While many members and leaders of the youth groups perished in the Warsaw Ghetto, Zionist and non-Zionist youth movements remain active. One can still find the left Zionist youth groups Hashomer Hatzair and Habonim Dror in countries such as Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, South Africa, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay. There are still remnants of the non-Zionist Jewish Labour Bund&#x27;s S.K.I.F. in Australia, the United Kingdom, France and the United States. The right youth group Betar operates in Australia, Brazil, Western Europe and the United States, and Bnei Akiva, a religious Zionist organization, operates worldwide.

==Similar organizations==
A second Jewish resistance organization called the Jewish Military Union (, ŻZW), formed primarily of former officers of the Polish Army in late 1939, operated side by side with ŻOB &amp; was also instrumental in the Jewish armed struggle.

<doc id="637333" wikidata="Q143567" url="?curid=637333" title="Dentures">
<text>Dentures (also known as false teeth) are prosthetic devices constructed to replace missing teeth, supported by the surrounding soft and hard tissues of the oral cavity. Conventional dentures are removable (removable partial denture or complete denture). However, there are many denture designs, some of which rely on bonding or clasping onto teeth or dental implants (fixed prosthodontics). There are two main categories of dentures, the distinction being whether they fit onto the mandibular arch or on the maxillary arch.

==Medical uses==
Dentures can help people via:
* Mastication: chewing ability is improved by the replacement of edentulous (lacking teeth) areas with denture teeth.
* Aesthetics: the presence of teeth gives a natural appearance to the face, and wearing a denture to replace missing teeth provides support for the lips and cheeks and corrects the collapsed appearance that results from the loss of teeth.
* Pronunciation: replacing missing teeth, especially the anteriors, enables patients to speak better, enunciating more easily sibilants and fricatives in particular. 
* Self-esteem: improved looks and speech boost confidence in patients&#x27; ability to interact socially. 

==Complications==
===Stomatitis ===
Denture stomatitis is an inflammatory condition of the skin under the dentures. It can affect both partial and complete denture wearers, and is most commonly seen on the palatal mucosa. Clinically, it appears as simple localized inflammation (Type I), generalized erythema covering the denture-bearing area (Type II) and inflammatory papillary hyperplasia (Type III). People with denture stomatitis are more likely to have angular cheilitis. Denture stomatitis is caused by a mixed infection of &quot;Candida albicans&quot; (90%) and a number of bacteria such as &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus&quot;, &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; and &quot;Bacteroides&quot; species. Acrylic resin is more susceptible for fungal colonization, adherence and proliferation. In poor fitting dentures, these inflammations can be identified and referred to as a common sore of the mouth and are dependent on the severity of the inflammation. 

It&#x27;s crucial to acknowledge that denture stomatitis ranks among the most prevalent conditions affecting denture wearers, affecting approximately 70% of this population. Early recognition of the signs and symptoms of denture stomatitis is vital for prompt treatment. Some of these symptoms include oral white or red patches, sore throat, pain or discomfort when swallowing, or sores in mouth. Common risk factors for denture stomatitis include denture trauma, poor denture hygiene and nocturnal denture wear. Additionally, systemic risk factors such as nutritional deficiencies, immunosuppression, smoking, diabetes, use of steroid inhalers, and xerostomia play a significant role. Therefore, it&#x27;s important to conduct thorough examinations to detect any underlying systemic diseases. 

Precautions denture wearers should take care improving the fit of ill-fitting dentures to eliminate any dental trauma. Stress on the importance of good denture hygiene including cleaning of the denture, soaking the dentures in disinfectant solution and not wearing it during sleeping at night is the key to treating all types of denture stomatitis. Topical application and systemic use of antifungal agents can be used to treat denture stomatitis cases that fail to respond to local conservative measures.

===Ulceration ===
Mouth ulceration is the most common lesion in people with dentures. It can be caused by repetitive minor trauma like poorly fitting dentures including over-extension of a denture. Pressure-indicating paste can be used to check the fitting of dentures. It allows the areas of premature contact to be distinguished from areas of physiologic tissue contact. Therefore, the particular area can be polished with an acrylic bur. Leaching of residual monomer methyl methacrylate from inadequately cured denture acrylic resin material can cause mucosal irritation and hence oral ulceration as well. Patients are advised to use warm salt water mouth rinses and a betamethasone rinse can heal ulcer. Review of persisting oral ulcerations for more than 3 weeks is recommended.

==Tooth loss==
People can become entirely edentulous for many reasons, the most prevalent being removal due to dental disease, which typically relates to oral flora control, i.e., periodontal disease and tooth decay. Other reasons include pregnancy, tooth developmental defects caused by severe malnutrition, genetic defects such as dentinogenesis imperfecta, trauma, or drug use. 

Periodontitis is defined as an inflammatory lesion mediated by host-pathogen interaction that results in the loss of connective tissue fiber attachment to the root surface and ultimately to the alveolar bone. It is the loss of connective tissue to the root surface that leads to teeth falling out. The hormones associated with pregnancy increases the risk of gingivitis and vomiting.

Hormones released during pregnancy softens the cardia muscle ring that keeps food within the stomach. Hydrochloric acid is the acid involved in gastric reflux, also known as morning sickness. This acid, at a pH of 1.5-3.5, coats the enamel on the teeth, mainly affecting the palatal surfaces of the maxillary teeth. Eventually the enamel is softened and easily wears away.

Dental trauma refers to trauma (injury) to the teeth and/or periodontium (gums, periodontal ligament, alveolar bone). Strong force may cause the root of the tooth to completely dislocate from its socket, mild trauma may cause the tooth to chip.

==Types==

===Removable partial dentures===
Removable partial dentures are for patients who are missing some of their teeth on a particular arch. Fixed partial dentures, also known as &quot;crown and bridge&quot; dentures, are made from crowns that are fitted on the remaining teeth. They act as abutments and pontics, and are made from materials resembling the missing teeth. Fixed bridges are more expensive than removable appliances but are more stable.

Another option in this category is the flexible partial, which takes advantage of innovations in digital technology. Flexible partial fabrication involves only non-invasive procedures. Dentures can be difficult to clean and can affect oral hygiene.

===Complete dentures===
Complete dentures are worn by patients who are missing all of the teeth in a single arch—i.e. the maxillary (upper) or mandibular (lower) arch—or, more commonly, in both arches. The full denture is removable because it is held in place by suction. They are painful at first and can take some time to get used to. There are two types of full dentures: immediate dentures and conventional dentures.

=== Copy dentures ===
Copy dentures can be made for either partial, but mainly complete denture patients. These dentures require fewer visits to make and usually are made for older patients, patients who would have difficulty adjusting to new dentures, would like a spare pair of dentures or like the aesthetics of their dentures already. This requires taking an impression of the patient&#x27;s current denture and remaking it.

===Materials===
Dentures are mainly made from acrylic due to the ease of material manipulation and likeness to intra-oral tissues, i.e. gums. Most dentures are composed of heat-cured acrylic polymethyl methacrylate and rubber-reinforced polymethyl methacrylate. Coloring agents and synthetic fibers are added to obtain the tissue-like shade, and to mimic the small capillaries of the oral mucosa, respectively. However, dentures made from acrylic can be fragile and fracture easily if the patient has trouble adapting neuromuscular control. This can be overcome by reinforcing the denture base with cobalt chromium (Co-Cr). They are often thinner (therefore more comfortable) and stronger (to prevent repeating fractures).

== History ==

As early as the 7th century BC, Etruscans in northern Italy made partial dentures out of human or other animal teeth fastened together with gold bands. The Romans had likely borrowed this technique by the 5th century BC. A text by Martial (c. AD 40-103) referenced Cascellius, who extracted or repaired painful teeth. H. L. Strömgren (1935), postulated that by repairing it was meant tooth replacement and not tooth filling.

Wooden full dentures were invented in Japan around the early 16th century. Softened beeswax was inserted into the patient&#x27;s mouth to create an impression, which was then filled with harder bees wax. Wooden dentures were then meticulously carved based on that model. The earliest of these dentures were entirely wooden, but later versions used natural human teeth or sculpted pagodite, ivory, or animal horn for the teeth. These dentures were built with a broad base, exploiting the principles of adhesion to stay in place. This was an advanced technique for the era; it would not be replicated in the West until the late 18th century. Wooden dentures continued to be used in Japan until the Opening of Japan to the West in the 19th century.

In 1728, Pierre Fauchard described the construction of dentures using a metal frame and teeth sculpted from animal bone. The first porcelain dentures were made around 1770 by Alexis Duchâteau. In 1791, the first British patent was granted to Nicholas Dubois De Chemant, previous assistant to Duchateau, for &quot;De Chemant&#x27;s Specification&quot;:

He began selling his wares in 1792, with most of his porcelain paste supplied by Wedgwood.

17th century London&#x27;s Peter de la Roche is believed to be one of the first &#x27;operators for the teeth&#x27;, men who advertized themselves as specialists in dental work. They were often professional goldsmiths, ivory turners or students of barber-surgeons.

In 1820, Samuel Stockton, a goldsmith by trade, began manufacturing high-quality porcelain dentures mounted on 18-carat gold plates. Later dentures from the 1850s onwards were made of Vulcanite, a form of hardened rubber into which porcelain teeth were set. In the 20th century, acrylic resin and other plastics were used. In Britain, sequential Adult Dental Health Surveys revealed that in 1968 79% of those aged 65–74 had no natural teeth; by 1998, this proportion had fallen to 36%.

===George Washington===

George Washington (1732–1799) suffered from problems with his teeth throughout his life, and historians have tracked his experiences in great detail. He lost his first adult tooth when he was twenty-two and had only one left by the time he became president. He had several sets of false teeth made, four of them by a dentist named John Greenwood. None of the sets, contrary to popular belief, were made from wood or contained any wood. The set made when he became president were carved from hippopotamus and elephant ivory, held together with gold springs. Prior to these, he had a set made with real human teeth, likely ones he purchased from &quot;several unnamed Negroes, presumably Mount Vernon slaves&quot; in 1784.

== Manufacturing ==
Modern dentures are most often fabricated in a commercial dental laboratory or by a denturist using a combination of tissue shaded powders polymethyl methacrylate acrylic (PMMA). These acrylics are available as heat-cured or cold-cured types. Commercially produced acrylic teeth are widely available in hundreds of shapes and tooth colors.

The process of fabricating a denture usually begins with an initial dental impression of the maxillary and mandibular ridges. Standard impression materials are used during the process. The initial impression is used to create a simple stone model that represents the maxillary and mandibular arches of the patient&#x27;s mouth. This is not a detailed impression at this stage. Once the initial impression is taken, the stone model is used to create a &#x27;custom impression tray&#x27;, which is then used to take a second and much more detailed and accurate impression of the patient&#x27;s maxillary and mandibular ridges. Polyvinyl siloxane impression material is one of several very accurate impression materials used when the final impression is taken of the maxillary and mandibular ridges. A wax rim is fabricated to assist the dentist or denturist in establishing the vertical dimension of occlusion. After this, a bite registration is created to marry the position of one arch to the other.

Once the relative position of each arch to the other is known, the wax rim can be used as a base to place the selected denture teeth in correct position. This arrangement of teeth is tested in the mouth so that adjustments can be made to the occlusion. After the occlusion has been verified by the dentist or denturist and the patient, and all phonetic requirements are met, the denture is processed.

Processing a denture is usually performed using a lost-wax technique whereby the form of the final denture, including the acrylic denture teeth, is invested in stone. This investment is then heated, and when it melts the wax is removed through a spruing channel. The remaining cavity is then either filled by forced injection or pouring in the uncured denture acrylic, which is either a heat-cured or cold-cured type. During the processing period, heat cured acrylics—also called permanent denture acrylics—go through a process called polymerization, causing the acrylic materials to bond very tightly and taking several hours to complete. After a curing period, the stone investment is removed, the acrylic is polished, and the denture is complete. The end result is a denture that looks much more natural, is much stronger and more durable than a cold-cured temporary denture, resists stains and odors, and will last for many years.

Cold-cured or cold-pour dentures, also known as temporary dentures, do not look as natural, are less durable, tend to be highly porous and are only used as a temporary expedient until a more permanent solution is found. These types of dentures tend to cost much less due to their quick production time (usually minutes) and composition of low-cost materials. It is not suggested that a patient wear a cold-cured denture for a long period of time, as they are prone to cracks and can break rather easily. 

==Prosthodontic principles==

===Support===
Support is the principle that describes how well the underlying mucosa (oral tissues, including gums) keeps the denture from moving vertically towards the arch in question during chewing, and thus being excessively depressed and moving deeper into the arch. For the mandibular arch, this function is provided primarily by the buccal shelf, a region extending laterally from the back or posterior ridges, and by the pear-shaped pad (the most posterior area of keratinized gingival formed by the scaling down of the retro-molar papilla after the extraction of the last molar tooth). Secondary support for the complete mandibular denture is provided by the alveolar ridge crest. The maxillary arch receives primary support from the horizontal hard palate and the posterior alveolar ridge crest. The larger the denture flanges (that part of the denture that extends into the vestibule), the better the stability (another parameter to assess fit of a complete denture). Long flanges beyond the functional depth of the sulcus are a common error in denture construction, often (but not always) leading to movement in function, and ulcerations (denture sore spots).

===Stability===
Stability is the principle that describes how well the denture base is prevented from moving in a horizontal plane, and thus sliding from side to side or front to back. The more the denture base (pink material) is in smooth and continuous contact with the edentulous ridge (the hill upon which the teeth used to reside, but now only residual alveolar bone with overlying mucosa), the better the stability. Of course, the higher and broader the ridge, the better the stability will be, but this is usually a result of patient anatomy, barring surgical intervention (bone grafts, etc.).

===Retention===
Retention is the principle that describes how well the denture is prevented from moving vertically in the opposite direction of insertion. The better the topographical mimicry of the intaglio (interior) surface of the denture base to the surface of the underlying mucosa, the better the retention will be (in removable partial dentures, the clasps are a major provider of retention), as surface tension, suction and friction will aid in keeping the denture base from breaking intimate contact with the mucosal surface. It is important to note that the most critical element in the retentive design of a maxillary complete denture is a complete and total border seal (complete peripheral seal) in order to achieve &#x27;suction&#x27;. The border seal is composed of the edges of the anterior and lateral aspects and the posterior palatal seal. The posterior palatal seal design is accomplished by covering the entire hard palate and extending not beyond the soft palate and ending 1–2 mm from the vibrating line.

Prosthodontists use a scale called the Kapur index to quantify denture stability and retention.

Implant technology can vastly improve the patient&#x27;s denture-wearing experience by increasing stability and preventing bone from wearing away. Implants can also aid retention. Instead of merely placing the implants to serve as blocking mechanism against the denture&#x27;s pushing on the alveolar bone, small retentive appliances can be attached to the implants that can then snap into a modified denture base to allow for tremendously increased retention. Available options include a metal &quot;Hader bar&quot; or precision ball attachments.

===Fit, maintenance and relining===
Generally speaking, partial dentures tend to be held in place by the presence of the remaining natural teeth and complete dentures tend to rely on muscular co-ordination and limited suction to stay in place. The maxilla very commonly has more favorable denture-bearing anatomy, as the ridge tends to be well formed and there is a larger area on the palate for suction to retain the denture. Conversely, the mandible tends to make lower dentures much less retentive due to the displacing presence of the tongue and the higher rate of resorption, frequently leading to significantly resorbed lower ridges. Disto-lingual regions tend to offer retention even in highly resorbed mandibles, and extension of the flange into these regions tends to produce a more retentive lower denture. An implant supported lower denture is another option for improving retention.

Dentures that fit well during the first few years after creation will not necessarily fit well for the rest of the wearer&#x27;s lifetime. This is because the bone and mucosa of the mouth are living tissues, which are dynamic over decades. Bone remodeling never stops in living bone. Edentulous jaw ridges tend to resorb progressively over the years, especially the alveolar ridge of the lower jaw. Mucosa reacts to being chronically rubbed by the dentures. Poorly fitting dentures hasten both of those processes compared to the rates with well-fitting dentures. Poor fitting dentures may also lead to the development of conditions such as epulis fissuratum. In addition, the occlusion (chewing surfaces of the teeth) tends to wear away over time, which reduces chewing efficacy and decreases the vertical dimension of occlusion (the &quot;openness&quot; of the jaws and mouth).

== Costs ==
In countries where denturism is legally performed by denturists, it is typically a denturist association that publishes the fee guide. In countries where it is performed by dentists, it is typically a dental association that publishes the fee guide. Some governments also provide additional coverage for the purchase of dentures by seniors. Typically, only standard low-cost dentures are covered by insurance and because many individuals would prefer to have a premium cosmetic denture or a premium precision denture they rely on consumer dental patient financing options.

A low-cost denture starts at about $300–$500 per denture, or $600–$1,000 for a complete set of upper and lower dentures. These tend to be cold-cured dentures, which are considered temporary because of the lower quality materials and streamlined processing methods used in their manufacture. In many cases, there is no opportunity to try them on for fit before they are finished. They also tend to look artificial and not as natural as higher quality, higher priced dentures.

A mid-priced (and better quality) heat-cured denture typically costs $500–$1,500 per denture, or $1,000–$3,000 for a complete set. The teeth look much more natural and are much longer-lasting than cold-cured or temporary dentures. In many cases, they may be tried out before they are finished to ensure that all the teeth occlude (meet) properly and look esthetically pleasing. These usually come with a 90-day to two-year warranty and in some cases a money-back guarantee if the customer is not satisfied. In some cases, the cost of subsequent adjustments to the dentures is included.

Premium heat-cured dentures can cost $2,000–$4,000 per denture, or $4,000–$8,000 or more for a set. Dentures in this price range are usually completely customized and personalized, use high-end materials to simulate the lifelike look of gums and teeth as closely as possible, last a long time and are warrantied against chipping and cracking for 5–10 years or longer. Often the price includes several follow-up visits to fine-tune the fit.

In the United Kingdom, as of 13 March 2018, an NHS patient must pay £244.30 for a denture to be made. This is a flat rate and no additional charges may be made regarding material used or appointments needed. Privately, the cost can lie upwards of £300.

== Care ==
Daily cleaning of dentures is recommended. Plaque and tartar can build up on false teeth, just as they do on natural teeth. Cleaning can be done using chemical or mechanical denture cleaners. Dentures should not be worn continuously, but rather taken out of the mouth during sleep. This is to give the tissues a chance to recover: wearing dentures at night is likened to sleeping in shoes. The main risk is the development of fungal infections, especially denture-related stomatitis. Dentures should also be removed while smoking, as the heat can damage the denture acrylic, and overheated acrylic can burn the soft tissues.

Deposits such as microbial plaque, calculus and food debris can accumulate on the dentures, which may lead to issues such as angular stomatitis, denture stomatitis, undesirable odors and tastes as well as staining. These deposits can also quicken the degradation of some of the denture materials. Due to the presence of these deposits, there is an increased risk of the denture wearer and other people around them developing a systemic disease by organisms such as methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA), but research shows that denture cleaners are effective against MRSA. Therefore, denture cleaning is imperative for the overall health of the denture wearers as well as for the health of people they come into contact with.

===Brushing===
After receiving dentures, the patient should brush them often with soap, water and a soft nylon toothbrush which has a small head, as this will enable the brush to reach into all the areas of the denture surface. The bristles must be soft in order for them to easily conform to the contours of the dentures for adequate cleaning: stiff bristles will not conform well and are likely to cause abrasion of the denture acrylic resin. If a patient finds it difficult to utilize a toothbrush, e.g. a patient with arthritis, a brush with easy-grip modifications may be used.

Disclosing solutions can be used at home to make less obvious plaque deposits more visible to ensure thorough cleaning of plaque. Food dyes can be utilized as a disclosing solution when used correctly.

Instead of brushing their dentures with soap and water, patients can use pastes designed for dentures or conventional toothpaste to clean their dentures. However, the American Dental Association advises against using toothpaste as it can be too harsh for cleaning dentures.

===Immersion===
Patients should combine the brushing of their dentures with soaking them in an immersion cleaner from time to time as this combined cleaning strategy has been shown to control denture plaque. Due to microbial invasion, the lack of use of immersion cleaners and inadequate denture plaque control will cause rapid deterioration of the soft linings of the denture.

===Cleansers and methods===
Liquid cleansers that dentures can be immersed in include: bleaches e.g. sodium hypochlorite; effervescent solutions e.g. alkaline peroxides, perborates and persulfates; acid cleaners.

===Sodium hypochlorite cleansers===
Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) cleansers have a disinfectant action and remove non-viable organisms and other deposits from the surface, but they are weak for eliminating calculus from the denture surface. Immersing dentures in a hypochlorite solution for more than 6 hours occasionally will eliminate plaque and staining. Furthermore, as microbial invasion is prevented, the deterioration of the soft lining material does not occur. Corrosion of cobalt chromium has occurred when hypochlorite cleansers have been used, and they may also result in the fading of the acrylic and silicone lining, but the softness or elastically of the linings are not greatly changed.

===Effervescent cleansers===
Effervescent cleansers are the most popular immersion cleansers and include alkaline peroxides, perborates and persulfates. Their cleansing action occurs by the formation of small bubbles which displace loosely-attached material from the surface of the denture. They are not very effective as cleansers and have a restricted ability to eliminate microbial plaque. Moreover, they are safe for use and do not cause deterioration of the acrylic resin or the metals used in denture construction. Despite this, they are able to cause rapid damage to some short-term soft lining. Discoloration of the acrylic resin to a white denture often occurs; however, this can be due to the use of very hot water with cleaning agents against manufacturer instructions.

===Acid cleansers===
Sulfamic acid is a type of acid cleanser that is used to prevent the formation of calculus on dentures. Sulfamic acid has a very good compatibility with many denture materials, including the metals used in denture construction.
5% hydrochloric acid is another type of acid cleanser. In this case, the denture is immersed in the hydrochloric cleanser to soften the calculus so that it can be brushed away. The acid can cause damage to clothes if accidentally spilt, and can cause corrosion of cobalt-chromium or stainless steel if immersed in the acid often and for long periods of time.

===Other denture cleaning methods===
Other denture cleaning methods include enzymes, ultrasonic cleansers and microwave exposure. A Cochrane Review found that there is weak evidence to support soaking dentures in effervescent tablets or in enzymatic solutions, and while the most effective method for eliminating plaque is not clear, the review shows that brushing with paste eliminates microbial plaque better than inactive methods. There is a need for studies to provide reports about the cost of materials and the negative effects that may be associated with their use, as these factors could affect the acceptability of such materials by patients which will in turn affect their effectiveness in a daily setting in the long term. Putting dentures into a dishwasher overnight can be a useful shortcut when away from home. Additionally, further studies comparing the different methods of cleaning dentures are needed.

=== Broken dentures ===
Dentures sometimes break, often during eating or when dropped during cleaning. A repair or replacement should be sought as soon as possible to restore function and aesthetics; the continued wearing of a broken denture results in unnecessary intra-oral tissue irritation, which may result in an increased risk of infection and other pathologies including malignancies.

<doc id="637346" wikidata="Q586430" url="?curid=637346" title="Takarazuka Revue">
<text>The is a Japanese all-female musical theatre troupe based in Takarazuka, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. Women play all roles in lavish, Broadway-style productions of musicals and stories adapted from films, novels, manga, and Japanese folktales. The Takarazuka Revue Company is a division of the Hankyu Railway company; all members of the troupe are employed by Hankyu.

==History==
The Takarazuka Revue was founded by Ichizō Kobayashi, an industrialist-turned-politician and president of Hankyu Railways, in Takarazuka, Japan in 1913. The city was the terminus of a Hankyu line from Osaka and already a popular tourist destination because of its hot springs. Kobayashi believed that it was the ideal spot to open an attraction of some kind that would boost train ticket sales and draw more business to Takarazuka. Since Western song and dance shows were becoming more popular and Kobayashi considered the kabuki theater to be old and elitist, he decided that an all-female theater group might be well received by the general public. 

The Revue had its first performance in 1914. Ten years later, the company had become popular enough to obtain its own theater in Takarazuka, called the , meaning &quot;Grand Theater.&quot; In 1934, the company opened the Tokyo Takarazuka Theater, which then underwent a renewal in 2001. Each Grand Theater show will typically perform for one month in the Takarazuka Grand Theater before a three week break, followed by a one month run in the Tokyo Theater. In 1978, the Bow Hall Theater was opened within the same complex as the Grand Theater. Seating 500, the Bow Hall features smaller shows that run for just over a week, and which often lack the grandiosity of Grand Theater shows. Currently, Takarazuka performs for 2 million people each year. 

Tickets are famously difficult to acquire, though are not considered to be incredibly expensive - the cheapest ticket available for a Grand Theater performance is 3500 yen, and the most expensive is 12,500 yen. All tickets for Bow Hall performances are 6500 yen, regardless of seat assignment.

Part of the novelty of Takarazuka is that all the parts are played by women, based on the original model of kabuki before 1629 when women were banned from the theater in Japan. The women who play male parts are referred to as and those who play female parts are called . Collectively, the Takarazuka performers are called &quot;Takarasiennes&quot; (). This name derives from the revue&#x27;s fondness of the French revues and the word &quot;Parisienne.&quot;

The costumes, set designs, and lighting are lavish and the performances melodramatic. Side pathways extend the already-wide proscenium accommodating elaborate processions and choreography. Regardless of the era of the musical presented, period accuracy is relaxed for costumes during extravagant finales which include scores of glittering performers parading down an enormous stage-wide staircase, known as the , and a Rockette-style kick line. Lead performers portraying both male and female roles appear in the finale wearing huge, circular, feathered back-pieces reminiscent of Las Vegas or Paris costuming.

Before becoming a member of the troupe, a young woman must train for two years in the Takarazuka Music School, one of the most competitive of its kind in the world. Each year, thousands from all over Japan audition. The 40 to 50 who are accepted are trained in music, dance, and acting, and are given seven-year contracts. The school is famous for its strict discipline and its custom of having first-year students clean the premises each morning.

All first-year women train together before being divided by the faculty and the current troupe members into and at the end of the year. Those playing cut their hair short, take on a more masculine role in the classroom, and speak in the masculine form.

The company has five main troupes: , , , and , as well as , an emeritus troupe for senior actresses no longer part of a regular troupe who still wish to maintain their association with the revue and perform from time to time. Flower and Moon are the original troupes, founded in 1921. The Snow Troupe was founded in 1924, followed by the Star Troupe in 1931 (it was disbanded in 1939 and was later reestablished in 1948). Cosmos, founded in 1998, is the newest troupe.

The Revue faced many challenges during World War II. They were only allowed to perform in the Japanese language, forced to perform militaristic shows, and their theater was requisistioned by the military late in the war. They could not reopen until 1946, after the war ended.

==Actors==

Though Takarazuka Revue gives the appearance of having been created to grant Japanese women freedom from social oppression, ironically, it was created with the opposite intention, with Takarazuka scholar Lorie Brau stating that &quot;The production office and corporate structure that control Takarazuka are overwhelmingly patriarchal.&quot; However, although Takarazuka embodies Shiraishi&#x27;s idea that the actresses become &quot;good wives and wise mothers&quot; upon leaving the company, it also simultaneously represents progressive feminist points of view. Some believe that its appeal to the female audience is on account of the perceived link to freedom from traditional Japanese society&#x27;s imposed ideas of gender and sexuality. Brau states that while the Takarazuka Revue &quot;reinforces the status quo and sublimates women&#x27;s desires through its dreamy narratives, there remains some possibility that certain spectators find it empowering simply to watch women play men.&quot;

Some Takarasienne shows, such as &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot; and &quot;Elisabeth&quot;, feature androgynous characters. In Brau&#x27;s view, the represents the woman&#x27;s idealized man, free from the roughness or need to dominate found in real life. It is these male roles that offer an escape from the strict, gender-bound real roles lauded in Japanese society. In a sense, the provides the female audience with a &quot;dream&quot; of what they desire in reality.

In addition to their claim to &quot;sell dreams&quot;, the actresses of the Takarazuka Revue take on another role, empowering themselves as women in a male-dominated culture. Kobayashi&#x27;s desire to make his actresses into good wives and mothers has often been hindered by their own will to pursue careers in the entertainment business. It is becoming increasingly more common for women to stay in the company well into their thirties, beyond the perceived conventional limits of marriageable age. The actresses&#x27; role within the Takarazuka Revue thus overlaps into the culture surrounding it, adding to their appeal to the female-dominant audience. &quot;In fact, it is the carrying over of this &#x27;boyishness&#x27; into everyday life and the freedom that this implies that captures the attention of some fans.&quot;

The , however, is not bound to her assigned male role in the theater. Tsurugi Miyuki, top star of the Moon Troupe, said that she conceived male impersonation as just a &quot;role&quot; that she wore like the makeup and costume that helped create her image. She said she reverts to her nonperforming &quot;feminine&quot; self after performance. Other feel uncomfortable switching to female roles. Matsu Akira, who retired in 1982, stated: &quot;Even though I am a female, the thing called &#x27;female&#x27; just won&#x27;t emerge at all.&quot; Most actresses refer to &quot;otokoyaku&quot; as an &quot;image&quot;, which they learn to create on stage. 

Although traditionally an all-female troupe, in 1946 the Takarazuka employed male performers who were trained separately from the female members of the troupes. Ultimately, however, the female members opposed these new male counterparts, and the department was dissolved, the last male department terminating in 1954. A 2007 Japanese musical, &quot;Takarazuka Boys&quot;, was based on this chapter of the company&#x27;s history.

While the casts are all-female, the staff (writers, directors, choreographers, designers, etc.) and orchestra musicians are predominantly male. It is not uncommon, however, in Takarazuka for a mostly male orchestra to be led by a female conductor.

==Troupes==
The five of the Takarazuka Revue have certain differences of style and material which make each unique.

===Flower Troupe ()===
The Flower Troupe is considered the &quot;treasure chest&quot; of . Many of the most popular former and current top stars of the company originated in the Flower Troupe; these include Miki Maya (who held the first Budokan solo concert in Takarazuka&#x27;s history), Sumire Haruno and Tomu Ranju of Flower, Jun Shibuki, Jun Sena and Kiriya Hiromu of Moon, and Hikaru Asami of Snow. Their performances tend to have larger budgets, with lavish stage and costume designs, and are often derived from operatic material.

===Moon Troupe ()===
While tending to be a home for young performers (with Yūki Amami in her sixth year reaching the status of top star in the 1990s), the members of the Moon Troupe are also strong singers. The term &quot;Musical Research Department&quot; is occasionally used in articles about the troupe, underscoring the troupe&#x27;s focus on music. Their material tends toward drama, Western musicals, and modern settings, such as &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; and &quot;Me and My Girl&quot;. During the era of Makoto Tsubasa as top star, they had at least two musicals adopted from classic western novels.

===Snow Troupe ()===
The Snow Troupe is considered the upholder of traditional dance and opera for the whole company, being the vanguard of traditional Japanese drama in a company that tends towards Western material. They were the first troupe to perform &quot;Elisabeth&quot; in Japan. The troupe has been moving towards the opera and drama style of the Moon and Flower troupes.

===Star Troupe ()===
The Star Troupe tends to be the home of Takarazuka&#x27;s stars. They, along with the Flower Troupe, have very strong players. In recent years, many of the company&#x27;s prominent have also originated from the Star Troupe, such as Hana Hizuki, Shizuku Hazakura, and Yuki Aono.

===Cosmos Troupe ()===
Cosmos, the newest troupe, is less traditional and more experimental. When it was first formed, it culled talent from the other troupes. The Cosmos style is influenced by performers like Asato Shizuki, the founding top star; Yōka Wao and Mari Hanafusa, the &quot;Golden Combi&quot; who headed the troupe for six of its first eight years. Cosmos was the first troupe to perform &quot;Phantom&quot; and to have a Broadway composer (Frank Wildhorn) write their musical score. Most of the in this troupe are above tall (the most notable is Hiro Yuumi, the tallest in the company since she joined in 1997 until her retirement in 2013). While it had a troupe-born actress become top back in 2006 with Asuka Toono, it was not until 2014 that an actress originating from this troupe became an top star: Seina Sagiri, the former top star of the Snow Troupe (2014–2017).

=== Superior Members (Senka) ===
While not necessarily being a troupe, members of the Takarazuka Revue who do not take part in any of the troupes mentioned above are called &quot;Superior Members (Senka).&quot; These members usually have one of a few roles in the troupe: playing a &quot;fukeyaku (role of old person)&quot;, playing a supporting role, playing the role of elderly guys, etc. There can also be cases of playing the main role as an &quot;otokoyaku,&quot; in a play alongside other troupes such as former top stars Yachiyo Kusagano and Yu Todoroki as well as plays where all partaking members are superior members, such as &quot;Hanakuyō&quot;, in 1984.

===Adaptations of Japanese works===
Stories based in Japan and modeled on historical accounts or traditional tales are often referred to as or, less frequently, . Among the most common of these adapted to the Takarazuka stage is &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;.

Popular manga series have often shaped Takarazuka, such as in the case of Riyoko Ikeda&#x27;s &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot;. Other manga adaptations include &quot;The Window of Orpheus&quot;, also by Ikeda, Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Black Jack&quot; and &quot;Phoenix&quot;, and Yasuko Aoike&#x27;s &quot;El Halcón&quot;.

Recent examples of works adapted from Japanese novels or short stories include Moon Troupe&#x27;s , based upon the short story by Ryōtarō Shiba and Flower Troupe&#x27;s , based upon the Kogoro Akechi story by Edogawa Rampo.

In 2009, Takarazuka Revue performed two shows based on an adaptation of Capcom&#x27;s video game series &quot;Ace Attorney&quot;. They took the stage in January 2013 to represent the courtroom game again with the production titled &quot;Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth: Ace Attorney 3&quot;. In June 2013, the Revue would debut at Tokyo&#x27;s Tokyu Theatre Orb an adaptation of another Capcom video game, Sengoku Basara, done by the Flower Troupe. This focused on character Yukimura Sanada, played by Tomu Ranju, the same actress who had taken the role of Phoenix Wright prior to becoming a top star.

In 2017, the Flower Troupe performed a stage adaptation of the (girls&#x27;) manga series &quot;Haikara-San: Here Comes Miss Modern&quot;, and performed it again in 2020. In 2019, the Flower Troupe also performed a stage adaptation of the manga series &quot;Boys Over Flowers&quot;. In August 2022, the Cosmos Troupe performed a stage adaptation of the series High&amp;Low in collaboration with LDH.

===Adaptations of other Asian works===
Among works adapted from other Asian sources is the Beijing opera &quot;The Hegemon-King Bids His Lady Farewell&quot;, detailing the romance between General Xiang Yu and his lover, Madam Yu.

===Original stories and historical adaptations===
Takarazuka has also performed original musicals written &quot;in house&quot; based upon people and events in American, European, and Asian history. Among the more recognizable of these biographical adaptations are &quot;Last Party: S. Fitzgerald&#x27;s Last Day&quot;, about F. Scott Fitzgerald; &quot;Valentino&quot;, about Rudolph Valentino; &quot;Dean&quot;, about James Dean; and &quot;Saint-Exupéry: The Pilot Who Became &quot;The Little Prince&quot;&quot;, about Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. They created a piece &quot;Wind in the Dawn: The Challenge of Shirasu Jirō, Samurai Gentleman&quot; about U.S. Occupations of Japan focusing on the rivalry between Shirasu Jirō and General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. 

Finally, other original stories round out Takarazuka fare, including musicals such as &quot;Boxman&quot; by the Cosmos Troupe, &#x27; performed by the Star and Moon Troupes, and &#x27; by the Moon and Snow Troupes.

===Collaborations===
Takarazuka has occasionally worked with notable writers, composers, and choreographers to create original content for the revue. In 1993, Tommy Tune wrote, directed and choreographed the revue &quot;Broadway Boys&quot; to accompany the Moon Troupe&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;. In 2006, Takarazuka worked with Frank Wildhorn, musical writer and composer of &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot; and &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, to create &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot; for the Cosmos Troupe. In 2019, Takarazuka worked with Dove Attia, music producer of and , to compose &quot;Casanova&quot; for the Flower Troupe.

==Other types of performance==

=== Dinner shows and music salons ===
High ranking Otokoyaku often perform dinner shows towards the middle or end of their careers. Typically held as hotels like the Takarazuka Hotel, Hotel Hankyu International, or the Palace Hotel, dinner shows showcase an actresses popular songs, as well as covers of other non-Takarazuka songs. Attendees pay a premium for food and beverage, as well as a chance to see their star in closer quarters. When a Musumeyaku holds a similar event, it is referred to as a Music Salon. Many actresses continue to do dinner shows even after they have left the company. 

=== Specials ===
Every year (with some exceptions) a Takarazuka Special is held, usually for one day only. Members from all five troupes come together for skits, dance and song numbers, as well as lengthy MC portions featuring current and former top-stars. From 1961 to 1982 this was referred to as &quot;Takarazuka Festival&quot;. From 1984 to 1994 this was referred to as &quot;Takarazuka Music Publication (TMP) Special&quot;. In 1995, TMP was renamed to &quot;Takarazuka Creative Arts (TCA)&quot;, and thus specials from 1995 to 2007 were referred to as &quot;TCA Specials&quot;. From 2008 to present, this has been simply referred to as &quot;Takarazuka Special&quot;.

== Class culture ==

=== Class ===
Each actor is referred to as being part of a Takarazuka Musical School class year, or &quot;ki&quot; (期), which corresponds with the year in which they graduate the music school. For instance, those graduating the music school in 2024 will be referred to as the 110th class. Before performing for the first time on the Grand Theater stage, the graduating class will perform what they have learned in their time at the school in the Bow Hall, through something called &quot;bunkasai&quot; (文化祭). Then will then go on to perform with one of the regular troupes for one Grand Theater run before being receiving individual troupe assignments. Before performances featuring the newly graduated class, all class members will appear sitting seiza on stage, wearing hakama. Three of their classmates will then make introductory remarks, before the main show begins. The line dance portion of these shows will be comprised only members of the newly graduated class. Actresses are referred to as students (生徒, &quot;seito&quot;) from the moment they enter the music school to the moment of their graduation.

=== Seniority ===
The gender-neutral terms (upperclassmen) and (lowerclassmen) are used to distinguish senior and junior members of Takarazuka. Lowerclassmen are the actresses who have been performers in Takarazuka for less than seven years. They are employees of the company, and usually work as background dancers and in (performances exclusively for underclassmen). After the seventh year they become upperclassmen, and negotiate contracts with the company instead of being employed by it.

=== Graduation ===
When an actress decides to leave the company, its often referred to as retirement (退団, &quot;taidan&quot;), or graduation (卒業, &quot;sotsugyō&quot;). Actresses will often choose to graduate at the end of a Grand Theater run, but can also announce immediate retirement and forgo any ceremony. In the case of those graduating at the end of a show, they will participate in two graduation ceremonies; one at the end of the final performance at the Grand Theater, and one at the end of the final performance at the Tokyo Takarazuka Theater. Towards the end of the second act of these performances, it is common to see graduating members with flowers pinned to their dress or lapel. Top stars or prominent second-in-line (二番手, &quot;nibante&quot;) will often get a goodbye performance (さよならショー, &quot;sayonara shō&quot;), where they are able to perform several numbers from their most cherished and memorable roles. This tradition began in 1963 with the graduation of Akashi Teruko.

Once the performances have concluded, the troupe leader (組長, &quot;kumi-cho&quot;), will read letters or remarks from the graduating actresses in front of the closed curtain, allowing the graduates to change into their graduation attire, usually hakama, but sometimes a tuxedo for the &quot;otokoyaku&quot; who favors it. When preparations have finished, the curtain will rise to reveal the entire troupe standing on stage. The troupe leader will then call each member to the stage, where they will descend the grand staircase, before being given flowers from a classmate (同期生, &quot;doukisei&quot;), as well as from the troupe. For those most senior, it is not uncommon for someone outside the troupe, or someone already graduated, to be called to the stage to give them their &quot;doukisei&quot; flowers. A song is then sung with troupe members holding each other arm in arm. What follows is a series of remarks from both the graduating actresses and the top star, interspersed with the opening and closing of the curtain as well as the calling of troupe members to and from the stage. Following the fourth iteration of the curtain closing, there is typically an announcement declaring the end of the performance. However, the standing ovation will often continue until the top star slips out in front of the curtain for one final goodbye. Upon the second announcement declaring the end of the performance, audience members begin to disperse. 

It is customary for audience members wear white to final performances.

==Audience==
Women make up the primary audience of Takarazuka, with some estimates showing that the audience is 90 percent female. There exist two primary theories as to what draws these women to Takarazuka. These theories, put forward by Western scholars, complement each other, drawing on the traditional homoerotic elements of Japanese performing arts, and the ancient subversive nature of the feminine in Japan. One is that the women are drawn to its inherent lesbian overtones. One author states, &quot;It was not masculine sexuality which attracted the Japanese girl audience but it was feminine eroticism&quot;. Another theory is that the girls are not drawn to the implicit sexuality of Takarazuka, but instead are fascinated by the (the women who play male roles) &quot;getting away with a male performance of power and freedom&quot;.

Favoring the first theory, American Jennifer Robertson observes that lesbian themes occur in every Takarazuka performance, simply by virtue of the fact that women play every role. The audience clearly picks up on it and responds. Within the first ten years of Takarazuka&#x27;s founding, the audience was vocally responding to the apparent lesbianism. Female fans wrote love letters to the . In 1921 these letters were published and several years later newspapers and the public rallied a cry against Takarazuka, claiming it was quickly becoming a &quot;symbol of abnormal love&quot;. In order to combat this, the producers kept its actresses in strict living conditions; they were no longer allowed to associate with their fans. Robertson mentions a phenomenon of &quot;S&quot; or &quot;Class S&quot; love, a particular style of love wherein women who have been influenced by Takarazuka return to their daily lives feeling free to develop crushes on their female classmates or coworkers. This type of romance is typically fleeting and is seen in Japanese society as more of a phase in growing up rather than &quot;true&quot; homosexuality. Robertson sums up her theory thus: &quot;Many [women] are attracted to the Takarazuka because she represents an exemplary female who can negotiate successfully both genders and their attendant roles and domains.&quot;

The other theory, supported by Canadian Erica Abbitt, is that the female audience of Takarazuka is drawn not exclusively by lesbian overtones, but rather by the subversion of stereotypical gender roles. Japan is a society notorious for its rigid conception of gender roles. While the original goal of the show may have been to create the ideal good wife and wise mother off stage, on-stage gender roles are, by necessity, subverted. The must act the way men are supposed to act. Abbitt insists that a large portion of the appeal of Takarazuka comes from something she calls &quot;slippage&quot;, referring to the enjoyment derived from a character portraying something they are not, in this case a woman portraying a man. While not denying the presence of lesbian overtones within Takarazuka, Abbitt proposes the cause for the largely female audience has more to do with this subversion of societal norms than sexual ones. In essence, the role of presents a type of androgynous freedom that embraces slippage and a non-constrained continuum of gender. While the actual female performer&#x27;s masculine persona or &quot;secondary gender&quot; was disapproved of outside of the theatrical purposes of Takarazuka, female fans were able to embrace the full gender-fluid continuum otokoyaku provided, as well as engage with Takarazuka in the context of a gender-sex political discourse.

===Fan clubs===
Some fans demonstrate their loyalty to a particular performer by joining her fan club. Club members can be identified by their colored scarves or jackets colorfully embroidered with the star&#x27;s name. Both prior to and following performances at the Takarazuka Grand Theatre or Tokyo Takarazuka Theatre, as stars enter and exit the theatre, several hundred fans congregate in their various club groups and stand in ranks on either side of the street in front of the building. Fan club members are known as a star&#x27;s &quot;guard&quot; while other fans present at the assemblies are known as the &quot;gallery&quot;. Clubs are arranged by actress seniority within the troupe. Theatre officials set up barricades and oversee the assembly.

Whenever an actress exits the theatre, the frontmost group will sit and all the others follow suit (much like the &quot;wave&quot; seen in athletic arenas) with subsequent intervals of standing and sitting. The fans wait for their favorites to exit the theatre. As the stars come out of the building, they move along to their own fan clubs. Rather than requesting autographs, the fans proffer cards, which are gathered by each star, who may say a few words before moving on. Once the last stars have emerged and departed, the clubs disband.

==Influence and legacy ==
Takarazuka has had a profound influence on the history of anime and manga, especially manga. Osamu Tezuka, a highly influential manga creator, grew up in the town of Takarazuka. His mother knew many of the Takarazuka actresses, and as a child he watched many of their performances. Based on their stories of princes played by female actresses, Tezuka created &quot;Princess Knight&quot;, the first manga aimed at a female audience, which tells the story of Princess Sapphire, a girl born with both a male and female heart who struggles between the desire to fight as a noble prince and to be a tender, gentle princess. The success of &quot;Princess Knight&quot; and other Tezuka stories began the tradition of manga written for a female audience, especially the influential &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot; and &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot; series, both of which borrow directly from &quot;Princess Knight&quot; by including specific Tezuka images, character designs and names. &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot; is one of Takarazuka&#x27;s best-known musicals. Women in masculine roles continue to be a central theme in manga and anime, as well as in some (boys&#x27;) series, and Tezuka himself explored the theme in many of his later works, including , and .

There are many series which show specific influences. The Takarazuka Revue inspired the plot of the original &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; video game along with additional inspiration from Takarazuka&#x27;s one-time competitor, the Shochiku Kagekidan (Shochiku Revue).

The Zuka Club in &quot;Ouran High School Host Club&quot; is based on the Takarazuka Revue.

The lesbian characters Haruka Tenou and Michiru Kaiou of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; were loosely based on the actors of the Takarazuka Revue.

&quot;The Virgin&#x27;s Mask&quot; by Jūrō Kara, a significant work of post-war theater, features an aging &quot;-girl&quot; attempting to reclaim her youth through ritualistic bathing in a tub of virgins&#x27; tears.

The musical anime series &quot;Revue Starlight&quot; has elements based on the troupe, including uniforms, the school seal, and theater style, and makes use of these elements to present a critique of Takarazuka practices, particularly the Top Star system.

The Tokyo theater group  (&quot;Fur Tribe&quot;) has produced homosexual parodies of classic Takarazuka shows like &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

The manga and anime series follows two teenage girls enrolled in a fictional version of the Takarazuka Music School. There, they train in singing, acting, and dancing, in hopes of joining the infamous all-female theatre troupe. One of the girls, Sarasa, dreams of playing Oscar François de Jarjayes in the theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;Rose of Versailles&quot;.

One episode of the anime series &quot;Stop!! Hibari-kun!&quot; features Wataru Otori, an eccentric drag king who takes on the role of Rhett Butler in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

The 1957 film &quot;Sayonara&quot;, featuring Marlon Brando, is set largely in neighboring Kobe. The all-female &quot;Matsubayashi&quot; theater troupe bears many similarities to the Takarazuka Revue.

A 1996 black-and-white photograph of moon troupe top star Jun Shibuki, taken by Daido Moriyama, appeared on the October 1999 cover of &quot;Art in America&quot;.

===Takarazuka and homosexuality in Japanese society===
After the scandal of women writing love letters to the and the revelation of an actual lesbian relationship between a and a , the revue greatly limited itself in order to do away with the lesbian image. Women wore militaristic uniforms, heightening the attraction even more among some audience goers. There was another scandal in 1932 when, for the first time, one of the cut her hair short (previously all of the actresses had their hair long and the simply hid their hair under hats). In August 1940, the actresses were even forbidden to answer fan mail and socialize with their admirers. In the years since then, the regulations have relaxed but not by much.

==Controversies==

=== 1958 stage elevator incident ===
On March 31st, 1958, during a Flower Troupe performance of &quot;Spring Dances: The Children in the Flowers&quot;, 21 year old musumeyaku Hiromi Katsuki died after her dress caught in one of the rotating elevation shafts during her descent on one of the stage elevators. Though that days performances were cancelled, they resumed the following day, modifying the performance to not include the use of any stage elevators.

Several factors are said to have led to the circumstances of the accident, including the rotation speed of the elevation shaft, the size of the actresses dress, the way in which the metal frame of the dress was secured to the actresses waist, as well as the inattention of the elevator attendant. The head of Takarazuka City&#x27;s police department, who was part of the incidents investigation team, suggested that the company should be held criminally liable for professional negligence resulting in death or injury. Beyond rumors of a 50,000 yen fine, it has not been officially reported if any civil action was taken or if any fines were levied following the incident.

Though this event is not officially acknowledged by the company, there remains a cenotaph dedicated to Hiromi in the Takarazuka Music School parking lot, along the Mukogawa river.

===Cosmos Troupe member suicide===
On November 14, 2023, Takarazuka executives held a press conference to release findings by an independent committee following the suicide of a 25-year-old Cosmos Troupe member on September 30. The family of the deceased sought damages and an apology, alleging overwork and workplace harassment as contributors to their daughter&#x27;s death. Records indicated that the troupe member logged 437 hours of work in August, well exceeding government standards for risk of occupation-related death. She had also told her family about being burned by hair irons, only sleeping 3 hours a day, and being told &quot;all the junior members&#x27; failures are your responsibility&quot; by senior troupe members. Takarazuka Revue chairman Kenshi Koba announced at the press conference that he would step down from his role on December 1, saying that the company did not sufficiently fulfill their duty of care for her safety. However they also stated instances of bullying or harassment could not be verified. On February 23 2024 it was reported that Takarazuka Revue had admitted to evidence of power harassment to the deceased family&#x27;s legal team. They are yet to come to a settlement. 

Former Cosmos Troupe members reported a culture of harassment towards junior members including berating, forced apologies, physical abuse, and food, shower, and sleep deprivation. In February 2023 &quot;Shūkan Bunshun&quot; reported on allegations of long-standing abuse, among them that junior Cosmos Troupe members were often intentionally burned on the forehead with hair irons by senior members. In response, Takarazuka executives had denied that any harassment took place and said that such allegations were hearsay.

<text>The Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Act 2004 (c. 13) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that amends the Scotland Act 1998 which established the Scottish Parliament.

Before it was amended by this Act, the Scotland Act 1998 provided for the constituencies of the Scottish Parliament (known also as &quot;Holyrood&quot; constituencies) to be the same as those for the United Kingdom Parliament (Westminster), except that Orkney and Shetland were separate constituencies. There are currently 73 constituency Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) and 56 regional additional-member MSPs. (See &quot;Scottish Parliament constituencies and electoral regions&quot;.) The Scotland Act also provided that the Boundary Commission for Scotland when reviewing the Westminster constituencies should use the same (larger) electoral quota as used in England. This has reduced the number of Scottish Westminster constituencies from 72 to 59. That in turn would have resulted in a reduction in the number of Holyrood constituencies and, because of the requirement in the Scotland Act for proportionality between constituency and regional additional-member seats, a pro rata reduction in the number of regional additional members.

As a consequence of this linkage in the Scotland Act there would therefore have been an automatic reduction in the size of the Scottish Parliament when the number of MPs at Westminster representing Scottish constituencies reduced at the 2005 general election.

In December 2001 the then Secretary of State for Scotland launched a public consultation seeking views on the case for retaining or ending the linking of Westminster and Holyrood constituency boundaries as is provided for by the Scotland Act, in the light of the experience gained from the operation of the Scottish Parliament. The majority of respondents supported retaining the present size of the Parliament, as is now provided for by this Act.

<doc id="637348" wikidata="Q3036435" url="?curid=637348" title="Afro–Latin Americans">
<text>Afro-Latin Americans (), also known as Black Latin Americans (), are Latin Americans of total or predominantly sub-Saharan African ancestry. According to Genetic Researches, most of Latin American populations has at least some tiny level of African blood because of involved people into generation processes.

The term &quot;Afro-Latin American&quot; is not widely used in Latin America outside academic circles. Normally Afro–Latin Americans are called &quot;Black&quot; ( or ; or ; ). Latin Americans of African ancestry may also be grouped by their specific nationality, such as &quot;Afro-Brazilian&quot;, &quot;Afro-Cuban&quot;, &quot;Afro-Haitian&quot;, or &quot;Afro-Mexican&quot;.

The number of Afro–Latin Americans may be underreported in official statistics, especially when derived from self-reported census data, because of negative attitudes to African ancestry in some countries. Afro-Latinos are part of the wider African diaspora.

== History ==

In the 15th and 16th centuries, many people of African origin were brought to the Americas by the English, Portuguese, Dutch, French and Spanish primarily as slaves, while some Spanish arrived as part of exploratory groups. A notable example of the latter was the black conquistador Juan Garrido, who introduced wheat to Mexico. Pedro Alonso Niño, traditionally considered the first of many New World explorers of African descent, was a navigator in the 1492 Columbus expedition. Those transported as part of the Atlantic slave trade were usually from West Africa, and were forced to work as agricultural, domestic, and menial laborers, and as mineworkers. They also worked in mapping and exploration (for example, Estevanico) and were even involved in conquest (for example, Juan Valiente) or in the army (for example, Francisco Menendez).

The Hispanic model of identity and representation has been historically characterized by its multi-faceted nature, which transcends strict racial categorizations. Numerous figures exemplify this complexity, including Martín de Porres, Beatriz de Palacios, Spanish conquistador Juan Garrido that established the first commercial wheat farm in the Americas, Estevanico, Francisco Menendez, Juan de Villanueva, Juan Valiente, , Pedro Fulupo, Juan Bardales, Antonio Pérez, Gómez de León, Leonor Galiano, Teresa Juliana de Santo Domingo and Juan García. Additionally, Juan Latino stands out as a significant figure in this discourse; he is recognized as the first black African to attend a European university, ultimately achieving the status of professor. This highlights the notion that the Hispanic identity is not monolithic and is instead enriched by diverse contributions across racial and ethnic lines. Such examples serve to challenge simplistic perceptions of race within the historical narrative of Hispanic culture.

The Caribbean and South America received 95 percent of the Africans arriving in the Americas with only five percent going to Northern America.

Traditional terms for Afro–Latin Americans with their own developed culture include &quot;Garífuna&quot; (in Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and Belize), &quot;cafuzo&quot; (in Brazil) and &quot;zambo&quot; in the Andes and Central America. &quot;Marabou&quot; is a term of Haitian origin denoting a Haitian of multiracial ethnicity.

The mix of these African cultures with the Spanish, Portuguese, French, and indigenous cultures of Latin America has produced many unique forms of language (e.g., Palenquero, Garífuna, and Creole), religions (e.g., Candomblé, Santería, and Vodou), music (e.g., kompa, salsa, Bachata, Punta, Palo de Mayo, plena, samba, merengue, and cumbia), martial arts (capoeira) and dance (rumba and merengue).

As of 2015, Mexico and Chile are the only two Latin American countries yet to formally recognize their Afro-Latin American population in their constitutions. This is in contrast to countries like Brazil and Colombia that lay out the constitutional rights of their African-descendant population.

In May 2022, the Project on Ethnicity and Race in Latin America (PERLA) at Princeton University estimated that about 130 million people in Latin America are of African descent.


== Racial and ethnic distinctions ==

Terms used to refer to African heritage within Latin America include &quot;mulato&quot; (African–white mixture), &quot;zambo/chino&quot; (indigenous–African mixture) and &quot;pardo&quot; (African–native–white mixture) and &quot;mestizo&quot;, which refers to an indigenous–European mixture in all cases except for in Venezuela, where it is used in place of &quot;pardo&quot;. The term &quot;mestizaje&quot; refers to the intermixing or fusing of ethnicities, whether by custom or deliberate policy. In Latin America this happened extensively between multiple ethnic groups and cultures, but usually involved European men and Indigenous or African women. Within Spanish-speaking Latin America specifically, the Hispanidad model of identity has historically assumed some degree of mestizaje but emphasizes Hispanic ethnic identity over racial categorizations.

== Representation in the media ==
Afro–Latin Americans have limited media appearance; critics have accused the Latin American media of overlooking the African, indigenous and multiracial populations in favor of over-representation of often blond and blue/green-eyed white Latin Americans. According to May 2022 Pew Research survey, Afro-Latinos in the United States were about 3 times more likely than other Latino adults to report being unfairly stopped by police. About half of the Afro-Latinos interviewed were told to go back to their country, and a third of them were called offensive names.

== South America ==
=== Argentina ===

According to the Argentina national census of the year 2010, the total Argentine population is 40,117,096, from which 149,493 were of African ancestry. Traditionally it has been argued that the black population in Argentina declined since the early 19th century into insignificance. Many believe that the black population declined due to systematic efforts to reduce the black population in Argentina in order to mirror the racially homogeneous countries of Europe. A 2005 study found that 5% of the population had African ancestry, while a more recent study suggested 9% may have African heritage. Researchers such as Alí Delgado and Patricia Gomes have suggested that, rather than Black people disappearingerasure from the 19th century onward has resulted in the &quot;invisibility&quot; of African culture and roots in Argentina.

=== Bolivia ===

Self-identified African descendants in Bolivia account for about 1% of the population. They were brought in during the Spanish colonial times and the majority live in the Yungas.

In 1544, the Spanish Conquistadors discovered the silver mines in a city now called Potosí, which is on the base of Cerro Rico. They began to enslave the natives as workers in the mines. However, the health of the natives working in the mines became very poor, so the Spanish began to bring in enslaved Sub-Saharan Africans to work in the mines. Slaves were brought as early as the 16th century in Bolivia to work in mines. In Potosí during the 17th century 30,000 Africans were brought to work in the mines from which the total population of Potosí which numbered around 200,000. Slaves were more expensive in Bolivia then other parts of the Spanish colonies costing upwards to 800 pesos. This was due to the fact that they had to be bought from slave ports in the coastal region of the Spanish empire and had to trek from cities like Cartagena, Montevideo, and Buenos Aires to Bolivia.

=== Brazil ===


Around 10% of Brazil&#x27;s 203 million people reported to the 2022 census as Black, and many more Brazilians have some degree of African descent.

Brazil experienced a long internal struggle over abolition of slavery and was the last Latin American country to do so. In 1850 it finally banned the importation of new slaves from overseas, after two decades since the first official attempts to outlaw the human traffic (in spite of illegal parties of Black African slaves that kept arriving until 1855). In 1864 Brazil emancipated the slaves, and on 28 September 1871, the Brazilian Congress approved the Rio Branco Law of Free Birth, which conditionally freed the children of slaves born from that day on. In 1887 army officers refused to order their troops to hunt runaway slaves, and in 1888 the Senate passed a law establishing immediate, unqualified emancipation. This law, known as &quot;Lei Áurea&quot; (Golden Law) was sanctioned by the regent Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil, daughter of the emperor Pedro II on 13 May 1888.

Preto and pardo are among five ethnic categories used by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, along with &quot;branco&quot; (&quot;white&quot;), &quot;amarelo&quot; (&quot;yellow&quot;, East Asian), and &quot;indígena&quot; (Native American). In 2022, 10.2% of the Brazilian population, some 20.7 million people, identified as &quot;preto&quot;, while 45.3% (92.1 million) identified as &quot;pardo&quot;. Brazilians have a complex classification system based on the prominence of skin and hair pigmentation, as well as other features associated with the concept of race (&quot;raça&quot;).

The Africans brought to Brazil belonged to two major groups: the West African and the Bantu people. The West Africans mostly belong to the Yoruba people, who became known as the &quot;nagô&quot;. The word derives from &quot;ànàgó&quot;, a derogatory term used by the Dahomey to refer to Yoruba-speaking people. The Dahomey enslaved and sold large numbers of Yoruba, largely of Oyo heritage. Slaves descended from the Yoruba are strongly associated with the Candomblé religious tradition. Other slaves belonged to the Fon people and other neighboring ethnic groups.

Bantu people were mostly brought from present-day Angola and the Congo, most belonging to the Bakongo or Ambundu ethnic groups. Bantu people were also taken from coastal regions of Northern Mozambique. They were sent in large scale to Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Northeastern Brazil.
=== Chile ===

Chile enslaved about 6,000 Africans, about one-third of whom arrived before 1615; most were utilized in agriculture around Santiago. Today there are very few people who identified themselves as Afro-Chileans, at the most, fewer than 0.001% can be estimated from the 2006 population.

In 1984, a study called &quot;Sociogenetic Reference Framework for Public Health Studies in Chile&quot;, from the Revista de Pediatría de Chile determined an ancestry of 67.9% European, and 32.1% Native American. In 1994, a biological study determined that the Chilean composition was 64% European and 35% Amerindian. The recent study in the Candela Project establishes that the genetic composition of Chile is 52% of European origin, with 44% of the genome coming from Native Americans (Amerindians), and 4% coming from Africa, making Chile a primarily mestizo country with traces of African descent present in half of the population. Another genetic study conducted by the University of Brasília in several American countries shows a similar genetic composition for Chile, with a European contribution of 51.6%, an Amerindian contribution of 42.1%, and an African contribution of 6.3%. In 2015 another study established genetic composition in 57% European, 38% Native American, and 2.5% African.

=== Colombia ===


People who were classified as Afro-Colombians make up 9.34% of the population, almost 4.7 million people, according to a projection of the National Administration Department of Statistics (DANE). most of whom are concentrated on the northwest Caribbean coast and the Pacific coast in such departments as Chocó, although considerable numbers are also in Cali, Cartagena, Barranquilla and San Andres Islands.

Approximately 4.4 million Afro-Colombians actively recognize their own black ancestry as a result of inter-racial relations with white and indigenous Colombians. They have been historically absent from high level government positions. Many of their long-established settlements around the Pacific coast have remained underdeveloped. In Colombia&#x27;s ongoing internal conflict, Afro-Colombians are both victims of violence or displacement and members of armed factions, such as the FARC and the AUC. Afro-Colombians have played a role in contributing to the development of certain aspects of Colombian culture. For example, several of Colombia&#x27;s musical genres, such as &quot;Cumbia&quot;, have African origins or influences. Some Afro-Colombians have also been successful in sports such as Faustino Asprilla, Freddy Rincón or María Isabel Urrutia.

San Basilio de Palenque is a village in Colombia that is noted for maintaining many African traditions. It was declared a Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2005. The residents of Palenque still speak Palenquero, a Spanish/African creole.

=== Ecuador ===

In 2006, Ecuador had a population of 13,547,510. According to the latest data from CIA World Factbook, the classified ethnic groups represented in Ecuador include mestizo (mixed Amerindian and white; 71.9%), Montubio (7.4%), Amerindian (7%), white (6.1%), Afroecuadorian (4.3%), mulato (1.9%), and black (1%). The Afro-Ecuadorian culture is found in the northwest coastal region of Ecuador and make up the majority (70%) in the province of Esmeraldas and the Chota Valley in the Imbabura Province. They can be also found in Ecuador&#x27;s two largest cities, Quito and Guayaquil. The best known cultural influence known outside Ecuador is a distinctive kind of marimba music. From the Chota Valley there is &quot;Bomba (Ecuador)&quot; music which is very different from marimba from Esmeraldas.

=== Paraguay ===

Black Paraguayans are descended from enslaved West Africans brought to Paraguay beginning in the 16th century. They became a significant presence in the country, and made up 11% of the population classified in 1785. Most Afro-Paraguayans established communities in towns such as Areguá, Emboscada, and Guarambaré. Many achieved their freedom during the Spanish rule. In the capital Asunción, there is a community of 300 Afro-Paraguayan families in the Fernando de la Mora municipality.

=== Peru ===
Some sources classified Afro-Peruvians around to 9% of the Peruvian population (2,850 million)

Over the course of the slave trade, approximately 95,000 slaves were brought into Peru, with the last group arriving in 1850. Today, Afro-Peruvians reside mainly on the central and south coasts. Afro-Peruvians can also be found in significant numbers on the northern coast. Recently, it has been verified that the community with the greatest concentration of Afro-Peruvians is Yapatera in Morropón (Piura), made up of around 7,000 farmers who are largely descended from African slaves of &quot;Malagasy&quot; (Madagascar) origin. They are referred to as &quot;malgaches&quot; or &quot;mangaches&quot;.

Afro-Peruvian music and culture was popularized in the 1950s by the performer Nicomedes Santa Cruz. Since 2006, his birthday, 4 June, has been celebrated in Peru as a Day of Afro-Peruvian Culture. Another key figure in the revival of Afro-Peruvian music is Susana Baca. Afro-Peruvian music was actually well known in Peru since the 1600s but oppressed by the Peruvian elite, as was Andean religion and language. Afro-Peruvian culture has not only thrived but influenced all aspects of Peruvian culture despite lacking any acknowledgment from mainstream media or history.

=== Uruguay ===

A 2009 DNA study in the &quot;American Journal of Human Biology&quot; showed the genetic composition of Uruguay as primarily European, with Native American ancestry ranging from one to 20 percent and sub-Saharan African &quot;from seven to 15 percent (depending on region)&quot;. Enslaved Africans and their descendants figured prominently in the founding of Uruguay.

In the late 18th century, Montevideo became a major arrival port for slaves, most brought from Portuguese colonies of Africa and bound for the Spanish colonies of the New World, the mines of Peru and Bolivia, and the fields of Uruguay. In the 19th century, when Uruguay joined other colonies in fighting for independence from Spain, Uruguayan national hero Jose Artigas led an elite division of black troops against the colonists. One of his top advisors was Joaquín Lenzina, known as Ansina, a freed slave who composed musical odes about his commander&#x27;s exploits and is regarded by Afro-Uruguayans as an unheralded father of the nation.

=== Venezuela ===
Self-identified Black Venezuelans are mostly descendants of enslaved Africans brought to Venezuela from the 17th to the 19th century to work the coffee and cocoa crops. Most Black Venezuelans live in the North-central region, in the coastal towns Barlovento, Northern Yaracuy, Carabobo and Aragua States, and Eastern Vargas State; but also in several towns and villages in areas in South Lake Maracaibo (Zulia State) and Northern Merida State in the Andes, among others. They have kept their traditions and culture alive, especially through music.

Venezuela is a very racially mixed nation, which makes it difficult to individually identify and/or distinguish their ethno-racial background with precision. Research in 2001 on genetic diversity by the Venezuelan Institute of Scientific Research (&quot;Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas&quot;, IVIC) in which the population was compared to the historical patterns of the colonial castes. According to the last population census in Venezuela conducted by the National Institute Estadististica (INE), 2.8% of the country&#x27;s population identifies as afrodescendientes of the national total, which is 181 157 result in the number of Venezuelans with African racial characteristics. However, most Venezuelans have some Sub-Saharan African heritage, even if they identify as white.

People who claim to be Afro-Venezuelans have stood out as sportsmen. Many Afro-Venezuelans are in the Major League Baseball and other sports – for example, former NBA/Houston Rockets forward Carl Herrera. However, most of them do not describe themselves as Afro-Venezuelan, but as Latinos or Hispanics or simply Venezuelans. Afro-Venezuelans have also stood out in the arts, especially in music; for example: Magdalena Sánchez, Oscar D&#x27;León, Morella Muñoz, Allan Phillips, Pedro Eustache, Frank Quintero, and many others. Miss Venezuela 1998, Carolina Indriago, Miss Venezuela Universe 2006, Jictzad Viña, and Miss Venezuela World 2006, Susan Carrizo are mulatto.

== Central America ==
The Afro–Latin Americans of Central America come from the Caribbean coast. The countries of Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, are of Garífuna, Afro-Caribbean and/or Mestizo heritage, as well as of Miskito heritage. Those of Costa Rica and Panama are mostly of Afro-Caribbean heritage. Many Afro-Caribbean islanders arrived in Panama to help build the Panama Canal and to Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica to work in the banana and sugar-cane plantations.

=== Belize ===
Belizean culture is a mix of African, European, and Mayan but only 21% of the population is considered to be of African descent. The main community of African descent are the Creoles and Garifuna concentrated from the Cayo District to the Belize District and Stann Creek District (Dangriga) on the Caribbean Sea. Belize City, on the Caribbean coast, is the center of West African culture in Belize, with its population being of mixed Black African, Maya, and European.

=== Costa Rica ===

About 8% of the population is of African descent or Mulatto (mix of European and African) who are called Afro-Costa Ricans representing more than 390,000 people spread nowadays all over the country, English-speaking descendants of 19th century Afro-Jamaican immigrant workers. The indigenous population numbers around 2.5%. In the Guanacaste Province, a significant portion of the population descends from a mix of local Amerindians, Africans and Spaniards. Most Afro-Costa Ricans are found in the Limón Province and the Central Valley.

=== El Salvador ===

Only 0.13% of the population identifies as black in El Salvador. Approximately 10,000 African slaves were brought to El Salvador. The African population, creating Afro-Mestizos in the certain areas where the Africans were brought. El Salvador has no English Antillean (West Indian), Garifuna, and Miskito population, largely due to laws banning the immigration of Africans into the country in the 1930s; these laws were revoked in the 1980s.

=== Guatemala ===

According to the 2018 census, 0.3% of the Guatemalan population identifies as having African ancestry. The main community of African heritage is the Garifuna, concentrated in Livingston and Puerto Barrios. The rest are Afro-Caribbean and mulattoes who live in Puerto Barrios and Morales. All these places belong to the Izabal department, located on the Caribbean coast. Because of unemployment and lack of opportunities, many Garifuna from Guatemala have left the country and moved to Belize and the United States. Also many people of African descent are located in different regions of the country, but most notable are in Amatitlán, San Jerónimo, and Jutiapa, although most of them may not recognize it because the loss of culture in these places. Based on oral local history in San Jeronimo of Alta Vera Paz, it is told that a ship carrying enslaved people from Africa broke on the shores of Guatemala prior to the European invasion. The ship had broken on the shores and the enslaved people became free people with the enslavers dead. The oral history continues to claim that the name Alta Verapaz – the land of &quot; High True Peace&quot; was given to that territory by the Spaniards after conquering the people of African and Mayan descent through religion – the cross – and not the sword as in other parts of Guatemala. The reason is Africans and Mayans had joined forces and defeated the Spanish Sword. Africans and Mayans have also intermarried tracing back generations prior to the Garifuna along the Coast. Many more Africans joined VeraPaz once the Spaniards conquered the area through religion, bringing about large sugar cane plantations that required more laborers, and unfortunately enslaved peoples.

Many of the slaves brought from Africa during colonial times came to Guatemala to work on cotton, sugar cane, tobacco, and coffee plantations. Most were brought as slaves and also servants by European conquistadors. The main reason for slavery in Guatemala was because of the large sugar-cane plantations and haciendas located on Guatemala&#x27;s Pacific and Caribbean coasts. Slavery didn&#x27;t last too long during those times and all slaves and servants brought were later freed. They spread to different locations, primarily Guatemala&#x27;s north, south and east. It is said that these freed slaves later mixed with Europeans, Native Indigenous, and Creoles (Criollos) of non-African descent.

The national folk instrument, the marimba, has its origins in Africa and was brought to Guatemala and the rest of Central America by African slaves during colonial times. The melodies played on it show Native American, West African and European influences in both form and style.

=== Honduras ===
According to Henry Gates: &quot;Estimates of people of African descent in Honduras vary widely, from 100,000 to 320,000 (1.8 to 5.8 percent of the country&#x27;s 5.8 million people in 1994).&quot;

If one uses the blood quantum definition of blackness, then blacks came to Honduras early in the colonial period. One of the mercenaries who aided Pedro de Alvarado in his conquest of Honduras in 1536 was a black slave working as a mercenary to earn his freedom. Alvarado sent his own slaves from Guatemala to work the placer gold deposits in western Honduras as early as 1534. The earliest black slaves consigned to Honduras were part of a license granted to the Bishop Cristóbal de Pedraza in 1547 to bring 300 slaves into Honduras. Honduras has the highest African ancestry in Central America from the Garifuna, Miskitos, Mulattoes, and Africans which make 30% of the country.

The self-identifying black population in Honduras is mostly of West Indian (Antillean origin), descendants of indentured laborers brought from Jamaica, Haiti, and other Caribbean Islands or of Garifuna (or Black Caribs) origin, a people of Black African ancestry who were expelled from the island of Saint Vincent after an uprising against the English and in 1797 and were exiled to Roatan. From there they made their way along the Caribbean coast of Belize, mainland Honduras and Nicaragua. Large Garifuna settlements in Honduras today include Trujillo, La Ceiba, and Triunfo de la Cruz. Even though they only came to Honduras in 1797, the Garifuna are one of the seven officially recognized indigenous groups in Honduras.

Slaves on the north coast mixed with the Miskito Indians, forming a group referred to as the Zambo Miskito. Some Miskito consider themselves to be purely indigenous, denying this Black African heritage. They do not, however, identify as such but rather as mestizo. The Black Creoles of the Bay Islands are today distinguished as an ethnic group for their racial difference from the mestizos and blacks, and their cultural difference as English-speaking Protestants. There has been practically
no ethnographic research conducted with this population.

All these circumstances led to a denial by many Hondurans of their Black African heritage which reflects in the census even to this day. &quot;Blacks were more problematic as national symbols because at the time they were neither seen to represent modernity nor autochthony, and their history of dislocation from Africa means they have no great pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas to call upon as symbols of a glorious past. Thus Latin American states often end up with a primarily &quot;Indo-Hispanic&quot; mestizaje where the Indian is privileged as the roots of the nation and blackness is either minimized or completely erased.&quot;

=== Nicaragua ===
About 9% of Nicaragua&#x27;s population is African and mainly reside on the country&#x27;s sparsely populated Caribbean coast. Afro-Nicaraguans are found on the autonomous regions of RAAN and RAAS. The African population is mostly of West Indian (Antillean) origin, the descendants of laborers brought mostly from Jamaica and other Caribbean islands when the region was a British protectorate. There is also a smaller number of Garífuna, a people of mixed Carib, Angolan, Congolese and Arawak descent. The Garífuna live along in Orinoco, La Fe and Marshall Point, communities settled at Laguna de Perlas.

Five main distinct ethnic groups exist: The Creoles who descend from Anglo-Caribbean countries and many of whom still speak Nicaragua English Creole, the Miskito Sambus descendants of Spanish slaves and indigenous Central Americans who still speak Miskito and/or Miskito Coast Creole, the Garifunas descendents of Zambos (Caribs, Arawaks, and shipwrecked maroons) expelled from St. Vincent who speak Garifuna, the Rama Cay zambos a subset of the Miskito who speak Rama Cay Creole, and the descendants of those enslaved by the Spanish.

=== Panama ===

Black people in Panama are the descendants of West African slaves as well as black people from Caribbean islands who arrived in the early 1900s for the construction of the Panama Canal. The Afro Colonials are the group of Hispanics, while the Antillanos are those of West Indian descent.

Famous Afro-Panamanians include boxer Eusebio Pedroza.

=== Cuba ===
According to a 2001 national census which surveyed 11.2 million Cubans, 1.1 million Cubans described themselves as Black, while 5.8 million considered themselves to be &quot;mulatto&quot; or &quot;mestizo&quot; or &quot;javao&quot; or &quot;moro&quot;. Many Cubans still locate their origins in specific African ethnic groups or regions, particularly Yoruba, Congo and Igbo, but also Arará, Carabalí, Mandingo, Fula and others, as well as a small minority of people who migrated in from surrounding Caribbean countries like Haiti and Jamaica.

An autosomal study from 2014 has found out the genetic ancestry in Cuba to be 72% European, 20% African and 8% Native American.

Among the most famous Afro-Cubans are writers Nicolás Guillén, Gastón Baquero, and Nancy Morejón; musicians Celia Cruz and Benny Moré— Compay Segundo, Rubén González, Orlando &quot;Cachaito&quot; López, Omara Portuondo, and Ibrahim Ferrer of the Buena Vista Social Club; jazz musicians including Mario Bauzá, Mongo Santamaría, Chucho Valdés, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Anga Díaz, X Alfonso, Pablo Milanés; other musicians such as Bebo Valdés, Israel &quot;Cachao&quot; López, Orestes López, Richard Egües, Dámaso Pérez Prado, Christina Milian and Tata Güines; and politicians Juan Almeida and Esteban Lazo.

=== Dominican Republic ===
According to the recent sources, 11% of the Dominican population is black, 16% is white and 73% is mixed from white European and black African and Native American ancestry. Other sources give similar figures, but also without naming a specific study. Other estimates puts the Dominican population at 90% Black and Mulatto, and 10% White.

Some Afrocentric commentators and race/ethnicity scholars have been harshly critical of Dominicans of mixed racial background for their reluctance to self-identify as &quot;Black&quot;. However, this reluctance is shared by many people of multiracial background, who find inappropriate to identify with only one side of their ancestry. Those people refuse to express a preference for any of the races that make up their background, and resent being ascribed to any single race.

Dominican culture is a mixture of Taino Amerindian, Spanish European, and West African origins. While Taino influences are present in many Dominican traditions, the European and West African influences are the most noticeable.

Afro-Dominicans can be found all over the island, but they makeup the vast majorities in the southwest, south, east, and the north parts of the country. In El Cibao one can find people of either European, Mixed, and African descent.

Most Afro-Dominicans descend from the Bantu tribes of the Congo region of Central Africa (Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Republic of Congo), and as well as the Ga people of west Ghana.

Notable Dominicans whose physical features suggest full or predominant Black African ancestry include bachata singer Antony Santos, baseballer Sammy Sosa and salsa singer José Alberto &quot;El Canario&quot;, and basketballer Al Horford, among others. However, there is no reliable procedure to ascertain the degree, if any, to which their ancestry is Black African.

A system of racial stratification was imposed on Santo Domingo by Spain, as elsewhere in the Spanish Empire.

=== Guadeloupe ===
The population of Guadeloupe, an overseas region of France, is 405,739 (1 January 2013 est.); 80% of the population has African and African-white-Indian mixture which emphasizes its diversity. Their West African ancestors were imported from the Bight of Biafra, West Central Africa and the Guinean Coast for sugar cane plantation labor during the 17th and 18th centuries.

Antillean Creole, which is a French-based creole, is the local language widely spoken among the natives of the island and even the immigrants who have been living on the island for a couple of years. French, the official language, is still the most common language used and heard on the island. Used during more intimate/friendly conversations, Guadeloupean people switch to French, which is their first and native language, when in public.

=== Haiti ===
The population of Haiti is 9.9 million, of which 80% are of African descent while 15-20% is mulatto and white. Slavery in Haiti was established by the Spanish and French colonialists. Many Haitians are descendants of Taino or Caribs who cohabited with the African descendant population.

Haiti is an Afro-Latin nation with strong African contributions to the culture as well as its language, music and religion with a fusion of French and Taino, with a sizable degree of Spaniard; all relate and are not limited to its food, art, music, folk religion and other customs. Arab customs are also present in their society today.

=== Martinique ===
The population of Martinique, an overseas region of France, is 390,371 (1 January 2012 est.); 80% of the population has African and African-white-Indian mixture which emphasizes its diversity. Their West African ancestors were imported from the Bight of Biafra, West Central Africa and the Guinean Coast for sugar cane plantation labor during the 17th and 18th centuries.

Antillean Creole, which is a French-based creole, is the local language widely spoken among the natives of the island and even the immigrants who have been living on the island for a couple of years. However, French, the official language, is still the most common language used and heard on the island. Used during more intimate/friendly conversations, Martinican people switch to French, which is their first and native language, when in public.

=== Saint Lucia and Dominica ===
The population of Saint Lucia is 179,651 (2021) and Dominica is 72,412 (2021); 75-85% of the population in both islands has African and African-white-Indian and Kaliango mixture.

The French were the first Europeans to settle on the islands. England and France fought 14 times for control of Saint Lucia and Dominica also went back and forth between France and Britain, and the rule of the islands changed frequently.

Jounen Kwéyòl (Creole Day) is celebrated in the Caribbean islands of Dominica and Saint Lucia, on the last Friday of October and the last Sunday of October to celebrate the mixed culture of the Islands mainly highlighting their French background along with their French/African dialect known on the islands as Kwéyòl. Both islands host cultural events and festivals which showcase different elements of their heritage and culture and they spend time reflecting on the importance of protecting their heritage.

Antillean Creole, which is a French-based creole, is the local language widely spoken among the natives of the islands and even the immigrants who have been living on the island for a couple of years. Dominican and Saint Lucian people switch to English which is their official language to conduct business and education or speak in their native language French Creole, when in public.

=== Puerto Rico ===

According to the 2020 U.S. Census taken in Puerto Rico, 17.1% of Puerto Ricans identified as being white, 7% of the population as being black or African American and 75.3% as mixed or of another ethnicity. An island-wide mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) study conducted by the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez revealed that 61% of Puerto Ricans have maternal Native American ancestry, 26.4% have maternal West or Central African ancestry, and 12.6% have maternal European ancestry. On the other hand, the Y chromosome evidence showed Puerto Ricans&#x27; patrilineage to be approximately 75% European, 20% African, and less than 5% indigenous.

An interesting anecdote to consider was that during this whole period, Puerto Rico had laws like the &quot;Regla del Sacar&quot; or &quot;Gracias al Sacar&quot; by which a person of African ancestry could be considered legally white so long as they could prove that at least one person per generation in the last four generations had also been legally white descent. Therefore, people of African ancestry with known European lineage were classified as &quot;whites&quot;, the opposite of the &quot;one-drop rule&quot; in the United States.

These critics maintain that a majority of Puerto Ricans are ethnically mixed, but do not feel the need to identify as such. They argue, furthermore, that Puerto Ricans tend to assume that they are of African, Native American, and European ancestry and only identify themselves as &quot;mixed&quot; if parents visibly &quot;appear&quot; to be of some other ethnicity. It should also be noted that Puerto Rico underwent a &quot;whitening&quot; process while under U.S. rule. The census-takers at the turn of the 20th Century recorded a huge disparity in the number of &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; Puerto Ricans (both, erroneous skin classifications) between the 1910 and 1920 censuses. The term &quot;black&quot; suddenly began to disappear from one census to another (within 10 years&#x27; time), possibly due to redefinition. It also appears that the &quot;black&quot; element within the culture was simply disappearing possibly due to the popular idea that in the U.S. one could only advance economically and socially if one were to pass for &quot;white&quot;.

Misinformation of ethnic populations within Puerto Rico also existed under Spanish rule, when the Native American (Taino) populations were recorded as being &quot;extinct&quot;. Biological science has now rewritten their history books. These tribes were not voluntary travelers, but have since blended into the mainstream Puerto Rican population (as all the others have been) with Taino ancestry being the common thread that binds.

Many persons of African descent in Puerto Rico are found along coastal areas, especially in the northeast of the island, areas traditionally associated with sugar cane plantations. These Afro-Puerto Ricans make up a significant percentage of the population especially in the cities and towns of San Juan, Loiza, Carolina, Patillas, Canóvanas, Maunabo, Río Grande, Culebra, Luquillo, Cataño, Ceiba, Juncos, Fajardo, and Guayama. African ancestry, and Puerto Ricans of notable African descent are found throughout the island, although they might not regularly associate themselves with an American concept of blackness. Due to the DNA evidence that is being presented by UPR at Mayaguez, many African bloodlines have also been recorded in the central mountains of the island, though not written in the Spanish history books of the time. Consequently, Taino bloodlines have begun appearing in the coastal towns. All of this suggests that escaped enslaved Africans ran off to the mountains to escape the slaveowners, while some Tainos remained close to their main staple food, fish.

The Puerto Rican musical genres of &quot;bomba&quot; and &quot;plena&quot; are of West African and Caribbean origin, respectively; they are danced to during parties and West African-derived festivals. Most Puerto Ricans who have African ancestry are descendants of enslaved Congo, Yoruba, Igbo and Fon from West and Central Africa. After the abolition of slavery in 1873 and the Spanish–American War of 1898, a number of African Americans have also migrated and settled in Puerto Rico.

Three of the most famous Afro–Latin Americans are Puerto Rican Boxer Felix &quot;Tito&quot; Trinidad, Hall of Fame baseball player Roberto Clemente and Bernie Williams-Figueroa Jr., New York Yankees outfielder and jazz guitarist.

== North America ==
=== Mexico ===

The vast majority of contemporary Afro-Mexicans inhabit the south central &amp; southern region of Mexico; those who migrated north in the colonial period assimilated into the general population. Some Afro-Mexican facts:
* Mexico&#x27;s second president, Vicente Guerrero, an Afro-Mexican, issued an official decree abolishing slavery and emancipating all slaves in 1821, during his short term as president. He also attempted to change the Official Census by aiming to get rid of the &quot;race&quot; category.
* Race was considered for the first time by the Encuesto Intercensal in 2015, which revealed that 1.2% of Mexicans identify as Afro-Mexican. Over half of these individuals also identified as indigenous.
* Gaspar Yanga founded the first free African township in the Americas in 1609.
* A Black man named Esteban el Negro (Steven the Black), a North African Moor from Spain, searched for the fabled city of Cíbola with Cabeza de Vaca.
* Veracruz, Campeche, Pánuco and Acapulco were the main ports for the entrance of African slaves.
* In the past, offspring of Black African/Amerindian mixtures were called &quot;jarocho&quot; (wild pig), &quot;chino&quot; or &quot;lobo&quot; (wolf). Today jarocho refers to all inhabitants of the state of Veracruz, without regard to ancestry.
* According to the 2020 (INEGI census), the countries population is now 2.4-3%

=== United States ===
Many Afro-Latino immigrants have arrived, in waves, over decades, to the United States, especially from the Caribbean, Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. In the state of California, the dominant population consisted of people of color, but as the years progressed the percentage has declined severely (or at least the way Californian residents claim to identify themselves has shifted towards a White population). A Pew Research Center survey of Latino adults shows that one-quarter of all U.S. Latinos self-identify as Afro-Latino, Afro-Caribbean or of African descent with roots in Latin America. This is the first time a nationally representative survey in the U.S. has asked the Latino population directly whether they considered themselves Afro-Latino. According to another Pew Research Center survey, &quot;Afro-Latino: A deeply rooted identity among U.S. Hispanics&quot; show some more statistics on how Afro-Latinos identify. As of October 2014, 39% of U.S. Afro-Latinos identify as white, 24% of them identify as just Hispanic, 18% as Black, 9% as mixed, and 4% as American Indian. Among the Chicano/a population, people who are both Black and Chicano/a may identify as AfroChicano/a. A May 2022 Pew Research Center survey stated that 12% of adult Latinos identified themselves as Afro-Latino, comprising an estimated total of six million people.

<text>Woolston Park is a modern park that is situated in the civil parish of Woolston, Warrington, in the English county of Cheshire.

Woolston Park covers 56 acres (230,000 m²) and was officially opened in 1977. It was created from neglected farmland to provide a valuable refuge for people and wildlife amongst the rapidly expanding local community. Running through the middle of the &quot;linear&quot; section runs &quot;Spittle Brook&quot;, a small stream often polluted with chemicals from the Grange Industrial Estate. The majority of the landscape of the park is manmade with soil being transported to build hills. The park is mainly open grassland for recreation. It is bordered by Hillock Lane playing fields. In its centre are the &quot;Jubilee Gardens&quot; commemorating the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.

Woolston Park has a number of football pitches used by Monks club and rugby posts; two cricket strips; several playing areas including the &quot;A B frame&quot; and a new play area which includes a zip wire. The park is popular with dog walkers.</text><links>

<text>The Second Mithridatic War (83–81 BC) was one of three wars fought between Pontus and the Roman Republic. This war was fought between King Mithridates VI of Pontus and the Roman general Lucius Licinius Murena.

==History==
At the conclusion of the First Mithridatic War, Lucius Cornelius Sulla had come to a hasty agreement with Mithridates because Sulla had to return to Rome to deal with his political enemies. The peace treaty allowed Mithridates to remain in control of his Kingdom of Pontus, but he had to relinquish his claim to Asia Minor and respect pre-war borders. Murena, as Sulla&#x27;s legate, was stationed in Asia as commander of the two legions formerly under the command of Gaius Flavius Fimbria. From Appian&#x27;s work on this war (The Mithridatic Wars), we can deduce that it was put in command over Phrygia, which had been annexed to the Attalid kingdom in 188 BC, and, possibly, Cappadocia, which was an ally of Rome.

Appian wrote that Murena marched across Cappadocia and attacked Comana, a town which belonged to Mithridates, because of suspicions that the latter was preparing for war against the Romans. Mithridates was fitting a fleet and raising an army to deal with a rebellion by the Colchians and the tribes around the Cimmerian Bosphorus (the Kerch Strait). It was the scale of these preparations and the fact that Mithridates had not restored the whole of Cappadocia to their king, Ariobarzanes I, who was a Roman ally, which led to this impression. Mithridates sent envoys to invoke the peace treaty. Murena replied that he did not see any treaties because Sulla had not written it down before he returned to Greece. He then began looting and then returned to Cappadocia to winter there. Mithridates sent envoys to Rome to complain. In 82 BC Murena seized 400 villages which belonged to Mithridates, who did not try to counter this, preferring to wait for the return of the ambassadors. Murena returned to Phrygia and Galatia loaded with plunder. He was reached by a messenger of the senate who told him that the senate ordered him to leave Mithridates alone as he had not broken the treaty. However, he did not bring a decree and he was seen talking to Murena alone.

Murena invaded Mithridates’ territory. The latter thought that this was done under the orders of Rome and sent Gordius, his commander, to retaliate on Roman villages. Gordius seized a large number of animals and property and advanced against Murena. When Mithridates arrived there, a tough battle was fought and Murena was defeated. Murena fled to Phrygia, harassed by the enemy. This led many states in Asia Minor which had sided with Rome to switch allegiance. Mithridates drove all the Roman garrisons out of Cappadocia. Sulla disapproved of a war against Mithridates because he had not broken the treaty. Aulus Gabinius was sent to tell Murena that the order not to fight Mithridates was to be taken seriously. Gabinius then arranged a conference with Mithridates and Ariobarzanes I to reconcile them. Mithridates betrothed his four-year-old daughter to Ariobarzanes and stipulated that Ariobarzanes was to retain the part of Cappadocia he held at the time and also have another part. Murena was recalled to Rome.&lt;br&gt;

Mennon wrote that when Mithridates sent his envoys to Murena, he ignored them because they were mostly Greek philosophers who disparaged Mithridates. He installed Ariobarzanes as king of Cappadocia and founded the city of Licinia near the border with Pontus. Meanwhile, Murena and Mithridates both sent envoys to the Heracleians to bid for their alliance. These replied that they could hardly protect themselves and could not help others. Some of Murena&#x27;s advisers said that he should attack Sinope and then march on the capital of Pontus. If he seized it, other towns could be won over. Mithridates protected Sinope with a large force and prepared for war. At first he had the advantage, but then the battle was even. This blunted the two sides&#x27; appetite for war. Mithridates went further east and Murena returned to Asia.

This war was followed by the Third Mithridatic War.

<text>The Corps of Volunteer Troops () was a Fascist Italian expeditionary force of military volunteers, which was sent to Spain to support the Nationalist forces under General Francisco Franco against the Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War, 1936–39.

==Background==
In July 1936, at the beginning of Spanish Civil War, most of the elite Nationalist forces were isolated in Spanish Morocco or on the Canary Islands. Meanwhile, in Spain, smaller formations of Nationalists and Guardia Civil forces were locked in combat with pro-government militias, Assault Guards and those army units which remained loyal to the leftist Popular Front government. Making the situation more difficult for the Nationalists was the fact that the Spanish Republican Air Force and Navy generally remained loyal to the government.

If the Nationalist forces fighting in Spain did not receive reinforcements, the rebellion could soon fail. General Francisco Franco and the other Nationalist leaders sent emissaries to Berlin and to Rome to ask for help. The German dictator, Adolf Hitler, and the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, immediately responded in a positive manner. They sent transport aircraft and crews to Morocco to airlift Nationalist forces from there to Spain. The colonial troops from Morocco allowed the Nationalist forces to take the initiative on mainland Spain.

The Italians also used Nationalist-held and Portuguese harbours as staging points for sending supplies to the Nationalist forces and for landing Spanish troops to support the rebellion. Italian submarines began to sink Spanish, Soviet and other nations&#x27; ships that were transporting materials through the Mediterranean to Republican harbours. However, action by the League of Nations resulted in the Nyon Agreement of September 1937, which classed these operations as acts of piracy and was enforced by the French Navy and the British Royal Navy.

== Organization ==

=== The CTV under Roatta (February-April 1937) ===
When founded, the CTV consisted of four all-Italian divisions, under the joint command of General Mario Roatta as CTV commander:
* the 1st Blackshirt Division &quot;Dio lo Vuole&quot; under General Edmondo Rossi
* the 2nd Blackshirt Division &quot;Fiamme Nere&quot; under General Amerigo Coppi
* the 3rd Blackshirt Division &quot;Penne Nere&quot; under General Luigi Nuvolini
* the &quot;Littorio&quot; division provided by the army under General Annibale Bergonzoli

=== The CTV under Bastico (April-October 1937) ===
After the defeat of the Italian troops in the Battle of Guadalajara, Roatta was replaced by Ettore Bastico on April 15, 1937. Bastico immediately initiated a reorganization of the CTV: the blackshirt divisions &quot;Dio lo Vuole&quot; and &quot;Penne Nere&quot;, which had proven useless in combat, were sent back to Italy. In return, 1,500 new soldiers arrived from Italy in June, after which the CTV was divided into three larger units:
* the &quot;Littorio&quot; division under General Bergonozoli
* the &quot;Fiamme Nere&quot; division under General Luigi Frusci
* the division &quot;XXIII Marzo&quot;
In addition, the mixed division &quot;Frecce Nere&quot; was added.

=== The CTV under Berti (October 1937–October 1938) ===
After the victory at Santander, the CTV was reorganized again in the fall of 1937. The new commander was General Mario Berti, and the divisions under his command were reduced from three to two (&quot;Littorio&quot; and &quot;XXIII Marzo&quot;) due to the high losses. In the winter, the mixed &quot;Frecce&quot; Division was added, which essentially consisted of the &quot;Frecce Azurre&quot; and &quot;Frecce Nere&quot; brigades.

=== The CTV under Gambara (October 1938 - April 1939) ===

For the final phase of the war, command of the CTV was transferred to Gastone Gambara on October 24, 1938. The CTV forces at the Catalonia Offensive now consisted of the new division &quot;Littorio d&#x27;Assalto&quot; as well as the three mixed divisions &quot;Frecce Nere&quot;, &quot;Frecce Azurre&quot; and &quot;Frecce Verdi&quot;.

== Recruitment ==
The casualty registers suggest that the army personnel consisted disproportionately of recruits from the southern regions of Italy and the islands. Northern and central Italy contained about two-thirds of the total Italian population, but only a third of all of the CTV&#x27;s fallen army soldiers came from these regions. In contrast, southern Italy and the islands, with only a third of the total population, accounted for two thirds of the fallen army soldiers.

==Timeline==
===1936===

3 September: Republican forces from Catalonia, under the command of Captain Alberto Bayo, made a landing on Majorca. His formations were the target of the Italian Air Force, which attacked on 24 October. On the same date, Italian bombers and fighters launched their first air raid on Madrid. That was intended to demonstrate to the Republican forces the power of Franco&#x27;s allies. In the following days, they began a series of bombing raids on the Spanish capital.

2 November: Italian and German bombers and their fighter escorts were attacked by Soviet aircraft, nicknamed &quot;Chatos&quot; by the Spanish, which resulted in some losses for the Italians.

12 December: After the failure of Franco&#x27;s offensive on Madrid, Mussolini decided to send regular army forces to Spain. Mussolini made that decision after he had consulted Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Galeazzo Ciano and General Mario Roatta, who were then two of the most influential men in Italy. Roatta was made the Commander-in-Chief of the Italian &quot;expeditionary force&quot;. General Luigi Frusci became his Deputy Commander.

23 December: The first formation of 3,000 troops landed in Cadiz and was called the &quot;Italian Army Mission&quot;.

===1937===
January: By then, approximately 44,000 regular Italian army soldiers and members of the Fascist paramilitary (&quot;Blackshirts&quot;) were in Spain. In late February, the &quot;expeditionary force&quot; was renamed the &quot;Corps of Volunteer Troops&quot; (&quot;Corpo Truppe Volontarie&quot;, or CTV). 

The Blackshirt (&quot;Camicie Nere&quot;, CCNN) Divisions contained regular soldiers and volunteer militia from the National Fascist Party. The CCNN divisions were semi-motorised. There, it also had the independent XXIII de Marzo Group of CCNN infantry.

The Italian CTV also had a Tank and Armoured Cars Group, Corps Artillery of ten regiments (Groups) of field artillery and four batteries of anti-aircraft artillery.

3 to 8 February: The 1st CCNN Division &quot;Dio lo Vuole&quot;, in support of the Nationalists, launched an offensive against Málaga. On 8 February, the Italians and Nationalists captured the city. The Battle of Málaga was a decisive victory for the Nationalists. About 74 Italian soldiers were killed, 221 wounded, and two missing in that battle.

March: The Corps of Volunteer Troops now numbered over 50,000 troops.

8 to 23 March: Mussolini decided that Fascist Italian forces should lead a fourth offensive on Madrid. The Italian offensive resulted in the Battle of Guadalajara, which ended as a decisive victory for the Republican forces. In contrast, the Italian forces suffered heavy losses. The Italian armour, consisting for the most part of L3/35 tankettes, proved to be no match for the tanks that were provided to the Republicans by the Soviet Union. The Italian offensive was repulsed by a strong Republican counter-offensive led by the 11th Division. Of the four Italian divisions engaged, only the Littorio Division did not suffer heavy losses. The three CCNN divisions had such heavy losses that they had to be reorganised into two divisions and a special weapons (armour and artillery) group. The 3rd CCNN Division was disbanded and consolidated with the 2nd CCNN Division in April 1937.

April to August: Following the reduction of the CCNN Divisions, Italians began to serve in mixed Italo-Spanish &quot;Flechas&quot; (&quot;Arrows&quot;) units, with the Italians providing the officers and technical personnel and the Spanish served in the rank and file. The first were the Flechas Azules (“Blue Arrows”) Mixed Brigade and the Flechas Negras (“Black Arrows”) Mixed Brigade, which served respectively in Extremadura and Viscaya from April to August 1937. Also in Viscaya were the CTV&#x27;s XXIII de Marzo Group and 11 Artillery Groups.

August to September: Roatta&#x27;s replacement, General Ettore Bastico, commanded the CTV forces including the Division XXIII di Marzo, formed from the XXIII de Marzo Group. The CTV broke the Republicans&#x27; lines near Soncillo; captured a key pass, the Puerto del Escudo; and penetrated deep into the Republican rear during the Battle of Santander, which resulted in a decisive victory for the Nationalists. They were then transferred to the Aragón front. Some CTV forces may have been involved in the Battle of El Mazuco, but details are unconfirmed.

October: After the northern campaigns, the 1st CCNN Division and 2nd CCNN Division were consolidated with the Division XXIII di Marzo and renamed the &quot;XXIII de Marzo - Llamas Negras&quot; Division.

===1938===
March: The Flechas Negras Brigade was expanded into the Flechas Division &quot;Arrows&quot; and served in the Aragon Offensive and the March to the Sea, with the CTV now under Mario Berti.

18 March: Barcelona was the target of 13 Italian large-scale air raids. Mussolini ordered the bombings without consulting Franco. The Italian aircraft were armed with incendiary and gas bombs, which resulted in the death of around 2,500 civilians.

November: The Flechas Division was strengthened and renamed &quot;Flechas Negras&quot;, and the Flechas Azules Brigade was expanded into two other Flechas Divisions, which took part in the Catalonia Offensive the final offensive of the war, along with the rest of the CTV under Gastone Gambara:

===1939===
February: After the victory of Franco and the Nationalists over the Republicans, General Bastico and the Italian volunteers left Spain.

==Aftermath==
On 1 April 1939, the success of the Nationalists meant that the Italians now had a friendly regime in the western Mediterranean. Of the approximately 78,500 men sent to Spain, 3,819 had been killed and 10,629 wounded. Most of the casualties were caused during the Catalan and the Aragonese Offensives, with about 44% of the deaths and 43% of the wounded, and the rest during the Guadalajara, Santander and Levante offensives. The Italian military left behind roughly 3,400 machine guns, 1,400 mortars, 1,800 artillery pieces, 6,800 vehicles, 160 tankettes and 760 aircraft. However, while the military equipment represented a loss to Italy&#x27;s war inventory, most of the equipment was obsolete and outdated. The financial cost of the CTV and AL to Italy was higher and amounted to between 6 and 8.5 billion lire. At 14 to 20 percent of annual expenditure, that represented an immense drain on the Italian economy. The high cost of the Spanish expedition further limited Italy&#x27;s economic output in the period before the Second World War.

<text>Cor!!, a British comic book, was launched in June 1970 by IPC (International Publishing Corporation), their sixth new comic in just over a year. &quot;Cor!!&quot; was edited by Bob Paynter.

The comic had 32 pages and included full-colour front and back pages and centre spread. It depicted traditional British characters, albeit with a slight tweak. The unruly schoolkids of &quot;The Gaswork Gang&quot; echoed &quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot; of &quot;The Beano&quot;, &quot;Tomboy&quot; was firmly in the &quot;Minnie the Minx&quot; vein, whilst &quot;Tricky Dicky&quot; seemed like a version of &quot;Roger the Dodger&quot;, albeit with longer hair and shorter trousers.

==History==

The first &quot;Cor!!&quot; featured &quot;Gus Gorilla&quot; on the front cover, drawn by Mike Lacey. The strip was in the shape of a glass, to promote the free fruit drink that came with this issue. The comic&#x27;s most popular strip was &quot;Ivor Lott and Tony Broke&quot;, a classic tale of two boys – one rich, one poor, with the latter usually the victor of the many battles they had. The strip continued long after the comic closed, finally ending in the last edition of &quot;Buster&quot; in January 2000.

Another popular strip, &quot;Whacky&quot;, debuted in the first edition, initially in a half-page format, sharing space with readers&#x27; letters. The strip later added the tagline &quot;He’s always getting whacked&quot; to emphasize the story of a schoolboy who is regularly caned by his sadistic teacher – the equally appropriately named Mr. Thwackery.

The first line-up changes occurred in the 1970 &quot;Bonfire&quot; issue when five new features debuted. 1972 saw three newcomers in the New Year issue, including Victorian miser &quot;Jasper the Grasper&quot; and &quot;Frankie Stein – Teenage Werewolf&quot;. One notable later strip featured the BBC comedians The Goodies. Drawn by Joe Colquhoun, the double-page feature lasted the whole of 1973.

Four years and 210 issues later the comic was eventually merged with &quot;Buster&quot; in June 1974, symptomatic of the diminishing market for British comics - though several further titles were launched by IPC and other publishers during the next few years. The long-running &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Scorcher&quot; also disappeared in 1974. The &quot;Cor!!&quot; name was kept alive by summer specials and annuals, finally ending in 1986.

<doc id="637367" wikidata="Q3568790" url="?curid=637367" title="William Lenthall">
<text>William Lenthall (1591–1662) was an English politician of the Civil War period. He served as Speaker of the House of Commons for a period of almost twenty years, both before and after the execution of King Charles I.

He is best remembered for his defiance of the king on 4 January 1642 when Charles entered the chamber of the House of Commons, supported by 400 armed men, in an attempt to seize five members whom he accused of treason. When Charles asked Lenthall where the five were, Lenthall famously replied &quot;I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as this House is pleased to direct me&quot;. It was the first time in English history that a speaker of the House of Commons had declared his allegiance to the liberty of parliament rather than the will of the monarch.

==Early life==
Lenthall was born in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, the second son of William Lenthall (died 1596) and Frances Southwell. His ancestors had migrated from Herefordshire to Oxfordshire in the 15th century. The family was recusant under Queen Elizabeth I, but this branch became Protestant after the early death of Lenthall&#x27;s father in 1596. Lenthall&#x27;s mother, Frances (sister of the Jesuit priest and poet Robert Southwell), conformed to the established Church. 

Lenthall was educated at Lord Williams&#x27;s School in Thame. He matriculated at St Alban Hall, Oxford in 1607 but left in 1609 without taking a degree. He moved to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and was called to the bar in 1616, becoming a bencher of the inn in 1633. He built up a successful legal practice, becoming recorder of Woodstock in 1621, an Oxfordshire magistrate in 1631, and recorder of Gloucester in 1638.

==Early parliamentary career and Short Parliament==
Lenthall&#x27;s parliamentary career began in 1624 when he sat as member for New Woodstock in Oxfordshire. He failed to be re-elected in 1625, but again represented the constituency during the 1640 Short Parliament, on several occasions being called upon to chair grand committees of the House on important subjects, including ship money and parliamentary grievances. The Short Parliament was dissolved on 5 May 1640 after only three weeks.

==Long Parliament==

When Charles I recalled parliament once more on 4 November 1640, at the start of what became known as the Long Parliament, Lenthall again attended on behalf of New Woodstock. Discovering that his preferred candidate for speaker, Sir Thomas Gardiner, had failed to be returned, the king reviewed the list of available lawyers and approved Lenthall as the new speaker, a position that Lenthall was to hold for most of the next twenty years.

From the start, Lenthall had his critics. Sir Henry Mildmay criticised him for letting too many speak during a debate, he was accused of partiality and procedural errors, and at one point was made to look foolish over a point of precedence. However, the journal of Sir Simonds d&#x27;Ewes (who was not generally supportive) suggests that in the opening months of the Long Parliament Lenthall was very much in control of proceedings.

During 1640 and 1641 Lenthall proved himself a competent speaker. He introduced or codified a variety of procedural rules including the establishment of the duration of parliamentary privilege before and after sittings, the imposition of a penalty for speaking when another member had the floor, and the rule that while one piece of business was before the House a motion on another could not be made.

By late 1641 Lenthall was finding the House&#x27;s long sittings physically exhausting and he became increasingly desperate to be relieved of the speakership. He was also concerned about his personal finances, pleading the prospect of financial ruin if he were to continue. In the event, however, he was to remain in post, with only a few gaps, for many more years.

===The king&#x27;s attempted seizure of the Five Members===

The relationship between the House of Commons and the king became increasingly fraught during 1641, and at the end of the year Charles launched in the House of Lords accusations of treason against five leading members of the Commons. The Commons sat to consider the allegations on 3 January 1642, and held them to be a breach of the House&#x27;s privilege. Provoked, and determined that the Five Members should not escape arrest, Charles decided to go to the House of Commons himself to apprehend them. The next day, 4 January, he arrived in person, accompanied by about 400 armed men, and entered the Commons chamber. Addressing Lenthall, he said &quot;Mr Speaker, I must for a time make bold with your chair&quot;. Lenthall vacated it. Calling first for one of the members, and then another, Charles was met with total silence. He asked the speaker where they were. Kneeling, Lenthall responded:
It was the first time that a speaker had declared his allegiance to the liberty of parliament rather than the will of the monarch.

The King paused. &quot;&#x27;Tis no matter, I think my eyes are as good as another&#x27;s&quot;. He studied the benches for &#x27;a pretty while&#x27; then lamented &quot;all my birds have flown&quot;. He left the chair and walked out &#x27;in a more discontented and angry passion than he came in&#x27;, followed by shouts of &quot;Privilege! Privilege!&quot; from the members.

Charles&#x27;s intended show of strength having failed, he left London less than a week later, and within months the country was plunged into civil war.

Lenthall&#x27;s defence of his office was acknowledged by the House on 9 April, when it awarded him the sum of £6000. In the last speech that Lenthall delivered to the king he talked of reconciliation, and invited Charles to rid himself of false counsellors.

===Civil War===

Parliament continued to sit during the civil war, acting now without the king&#x27;s authority. Lenthall remained in the chair, supporting the Parliamentary cause but without much sympathy toward those diehard Protestants who were seeking radical ecclesiastical reform. In November 1642, he argued forcefully that the Commons should send peace proposals to the king.

Lenthall&#x27;s appointment to a series of high offices during this period brought some relief to his preoccupation with his personal finances. He had already called attention to the inadequacy of his salary and been granted a sum of £6,000, and during the 1640s he became Master of the Rolls, a commissioner of the Great Seal, and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Nevertheless, his worries continued especially since with the coming of war his estates near Oxford were at risk of confiscation by the royalists. In June 1649 a labourer broke into his London house and stole £1900; he was later caught, tried, and sentenced to hang.

By 1647 popular dissent was growing against the power of the New Model Army and the oppressions of local committees. The Long Parliament found itself increasingly unpopular, having imposed punitive taxation and chosen a course which had led to slaughter without any identifiable achievement. On 26 July a mob invaded parliament to force it to agree to the army&#x27;s Solemn Engagement (its refusal to disband until its grievances were met). The speaker was held in the chair by force and was compelled to put to the vote a resolution inviting the king to London.

On 31 July 1647 Lenthall published a personal declaration stating that votes in the Commons had been forced, rendering them void. He declared that he would take himself to the army, and would return only when free to resume his office. Along with fifty-seven other members, eight peers and the speaker of the Lords, he left London. The fugitive members were well received by the soldiers, and they were invited by their commander Lord Fairfax to review 15,000 men on Hounslow Heath on 3 August. Fairfax&#x27;s regiments encircled London the next day, and under his protection Lenthall and the other fugitives were escorted in triumph back to parliament. Lenthall was re-installed in the chair, and all votes passed during his absence were subsequently annulled.

Lenthall sympathized with the Independents in parliament, and was portrayed by royalist newspapers in 1648 as being their tool, plotting to manipulate the House in their interests. But he did not always act as expected, for example using his casting vote in favour of continuing negotiations with the king.

===Pride&#x27;s Purge===
On 6 December 1648, in an event known as Pride&#x27;s Purge, troops of the New Model Army under the command of Colonel Thomas Pride forcibly removed from parliament all those who were not Independents or Army supporters. Lenthall remained silent, and had probably been warned in advance. He was certainly consulted on several occasions by Independent leaders during the December crisis.

=== Rump Parliament ===

The Purge had reduced the Commons to a rump of a little over 200 hard-line members. Lenthall remained in post during the debates and resolutions that led ultimately to Charles&#x27;s execution on 30 January 1649, though there is no evidence that he was otherwise active in the events leading up to the regicide. Later he claimed to have sent money to the king at Oxford, and to have helped with the care of the queen and the royal children. He also used his influence, when he thought it safe to do so, to help some royalists, using his casting vote at times to save the lives of some.

In February 1649, the House voted to abolish both the House of Peers and the monarchy, and Lenthall found himself speaker of a new supreme unicameral parliament. Though holding little real power, Lenthall as its representative became the leading citizen of England. Although the first to take the engagement of loyalty to the new Commonwealth, he remained cautious and conservative in his approach to public affairs.

In December 1651 Oliver Cromwell arranged a meeting at the speaker&#x27;s house to discuss options for future government. Lenthall, along with the other lawyers present, argued against the idea of a pure republic and in favour of a mixed constitution incorporating some role for a monarch.

===Cromwell&#x27;s dismissal of the Rump===

The Rump Parliament had undertaken to dissolve itself &quot;as soon as may possibly stand with the safety of the people&quot;. But it failed to do so, and on 20 April 1653 it was forcibly dissolved by Cromwell and other leading army officers. Supported by Colonel Thomas Harrison and 30 or 40 musketeers, Cromwell ordered the chamber to be cleared. Lenthall once again rose to the occasion, announcing to Harrison that he would not come down unless he was pulled out. Harrison stretched out an arm and Lenthall submitted, doubtless realising the futility of resistance.

Lenthall had become associated with the shortcomings of the Rump, and he found no place in the Nominated Assembly that sat between July and December 1653.

=== First Protectorate Parliament ===

The First Protectorate Parliament was summoned in 1654 by Cromwell, in his new role as Lord Protector. Lenthall was returned as member for Oxfordshire, and on 4 September was once again confirmed as speaker.

=== Second Protectorate Parliament ===
In the Second Protectorate Parliament, summoned by Cromwell on 17 September 1656, Lenthall was again returned as member for Oxfordshire, but this time was not selected as speaker. He nevertheless took a full part in the proceedings, being the senior member on the committee charged with settling the new constitutional arrangements. He was supportive of the Protector and was rewarded—after some agitation on his part—with a seat in Cromwell&#x27;s new Other House, taking up his place as Lord Lenthall 10 December 1657.

===Revival of the Rump Parliament===
After the death of Oliver Cromwell on 3 September 1658 his son Richard Cromwell succeeded him as Lord Protector. The Protectorate rapidly collapsed, and on 6 May 1659 Lenthall was visited by senior army officers who asked him to help with the revival of the Rump Parliament, and to return as speaker. Lenthall was reluctant to give up his seat in the Other House and pleaded ill health, but when he was bypassed and parliament summoned without his aid he felt himself obliged to resume his role as speaker the following day.

Lenthall now presided over a revived parliament of only 78 members, and in spite of his parallel role as head of the army, division between parliament and the army deepened. On 12 October 1659 the army surrounded and occupied the precincts of the House, and for a night and a day a stand-off with the parliamentary defenders ensued. Lenthall himself was denied access by the blockading soldiers, and had to turn back. To his remonstrance that he was their general, the soldiers replied that they would have known him as such had he marched before them on Winnington Bridge.

But the army leaders themselves were unclear whether their latest coup was intended to bring down the restored Rump or merely to bring it to terms. Lenthall began to manoeuvre away from the republicans, and in November was reported to have been in touch with General George Monck who was actively working against factions within the army that opposed the Rump. The situation had completely changed by 24 December when Lenthall was approached at home and his permission sought, as head of the army, for troops to parade in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. Soldiers who had earlier refused to recognise Lenthall&#x27;s authority now marched to his house to acclaim him with shouts and a volley of shots.

He arranged a sitting of the restored Rump on 26 December 1659 with only 42 members present, but then absented himself from the House for ten days pleading gout (probably to avoid taking the oath abjuring the House of Stuart, sought by the republicans in Parliament). By February 1660, Lenthall was fully co-operating with Monck and had broken completely with the republicans.

On 16 March 1660 The Rump Parliament voted to dissolve itself, bringing Lenthall&#x27;s long period of speakerships to a close and clearing the way for Monck to organise fresh elections for the Convention Parliament. Lenthall was active in bringing about the Restoration, with his advice and service, but found himself out of favour. Monck lobbied to have Lenthall elected for Oxford University, but without success.

==The Restoration==
The new parliament met for the first time on 25 April 1660 and on 8 May proclaimed that King Charles II had retrospectively been the lawful monarch since the execution of Charles I on 30 January 1649. Lenthall sent £3,000 to the new king, seeking to retain the Mastership of the Rolls, but was told it had been allocated elsewhere.

Lenthall was at risk of being put on trial by the new regime for some of his acts during the interregnum, and he was strongly denounced by William Prynne. Ultimately, however, he was merely barred by the Act of Indemnity and Oblivion 1660 from further public office for life. The act mentioned him by name as being exempt from its indemnity provisions if he ever again were to accept public office.

On 12 October 1660 he gave evidence at the trial of the regicide Thomas Scot, swearing that Scot had spoken in parliament in favour of executing the king; an act that disgusted many in the light of his famous defence of parliamentary privilege in 1642.

==Death==
Lenthall retired to Burford, Oxfordshire, where he died on 3 September 1662; he was buried at the church there. On his deathbed he made a confession: &quot;I confess with Saul, I held their clothes whilst they murdered him, but herein I was not so criminal as Saul was, for God, thou knowest, I never consented to his death&quot;. He requested that his only epitaph should be &quot;Vermis sum&quot; (&quot;I am a worm&quot;). His only surviving son was the politician John Lenthall (1624 or 1625 – 1681).

==Private life==
By 1619 Lenthall had married Elizabeth Evans (died April 1662), daughter of Ambrose Evans of Loddington, Northamptonshire, by his wife Lettice Symonds of Cley Next the Sea, Norfolk.

William Lenthall had two chief residences, Burford Priory in Oxfordshire (still standing) and Besselsleigh Manor in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). In 1637, he had purchased Burford from Lord Falkland. Lenthall was one of the overseers of the will of Sir Lawrence Tanfield, Lord Falkland&#x27;s grandfather, and had married into Tanfield&#x27;s second wife&#x27;s family. The house remained in the Lenthall family until 1828.

Lenthall had an extensive collection of paintings, some being family portraits and some that may have been at Burford when he purchased it. He may also have acquired paintings from the Royal collection following the execution of Charles I. The collection was sold by the family in 1833.

==Character assessment==
Lenthall has always been a figure who has divided opinion. In his early career, opponents frequently targeted him for perceived personal shortcomings and weaknesses as speaker. However, the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; contends that these criticisms do not stand up to scrutiny. His actions during this time demonstrate a clear commitment to upholding the authority of his office and contributing to parliamentary procedure.

On the other hand, his conservative outlook and adherence to tradition have been interpreted as evidence of a limited political vision. Allegations of self-serving corruption also surfaced repeatedly, casting a shadow over his reputation. While many of these accusations originated from those with grievances, and could be difficult to substantiate, they cannot be entirely dismissed.

Lenthall&#x27;s enduring legacy is shaped by his resolute defiance of Charles I in January 1642.

<text>The Coimbra Group (CG) is an international association of 40 universities in Europe. It was established in 1985. It works for the benefit of its members by promoting &quot;internationalization, academic collaboration, excellence in learning and research, and service to society&quot; through &quot;creating special academic and cultural ties&quot;, by lobbying at the European level, and by developing best-practice.

==History==

The Coimbra Group was founded in 1985 and formally constituted in 1987 by a charter signed between its members, then numbering 19. In 1994 it published &quot;Charters of Foundation and Early Documents of the Universities of the Coimbra Group&quot;. A second edition was published in 2005, by which time Caen had left the group while Bergen, Geneva, Graz, Lyon, Padua, Tartu and Turku had joined.

In 2013 the group consisted of 40 universities, but by the following year this had fallen to 37 with the departures of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Greece), the University of Cambridge (UK) and the University of Oxford (UK). Since then, the Group has added Vilnius University (Lithuania) in June 2015 and Durham University (UK) in June 2016. This brought the membership of the group to 39, but it subsequently fell to 38 in October 2016, when the University of Lyon (France) decided to leave the Group. At the General Assembly in June 2017, the University of Cologne was invited to join as the 39th member, while Utrecht University joined the group in December 2020.

==Members==
 the Coimbra Group includes 40 universities in 22 countries:

<doc id="637373" wikidata="Q1081659" url="?curid=637373" title="Common stock">
<text>Common stock is a form of corporate equity ownership, a type of security. The terms voting share and ordinary share are also used frequently outside of the United States. They are known as equity shares or ordinary shares in the UK and other Commonwealth realms. This type of share gives the stockholder the right to share in the profits of the company, and to vote on matters of corporate policy and the composition of the members of the board of directors.

The owners of common stock do not directly own any assets of the company; instead each stockholder owns a fractional interest in the company, which in turn owns the assets. As owners of a company, common stockholders are eligible to receive dividends from its recent or past earnings, proceeds from a sale of the company, and distributions of residual (left-over) money if it is liquidated. In general, common stockholders have lowest priority to receive payouts from the company. They may not receive dividends until the company has met obligations on any preference shares it has issued, and they receive distributions in liquidation only after bondholders, creditors (including employees) and preference share owners have been paid. When liquidation happens through bankruptcy, the ordinary shareholders typically receive nothing.

Since common stock is more exposed to the risks of the business than bonds or preferred stock, it offers a greater potential for capital appreciation. Over the long term, common stocks tend to outperform more secure investments, despite their short-term volatility.

== Shareholder rights ==
Owners of a company&#x27;s common stock are entitled to rights that are enumerated in its articles, bylaws and applicable corporate law. These can include the right to vote on directors, officers, compensation plans and major business actions such as acquisition or dissolution. Many companies also allow them to submit and vote on proposals to amend the bylaws or to mandate actions by the board. Pre-emption rights and shareholder rights plans regulate the terms under which new shareholders can affect the interests of existing ones. Shareholders have the right to request access to the company&#x27;s financial records, the list of shareholders, and other records that they legitimately require to fulfill their ownership duties.

== Classification ==
Common/Equity stock is classified to differentiate it from preferred stock. Each is considered a stock class, with different series of each issued from time to time such as Series B Preferred Stock. Nevertheless, using &quot;Class B Common Stock&quot; is a common label for a super-voting series of common stock.

== Ownership rights ==
Common stocks exist on both public and private markets, however the accessibility differs because only publicly traded companies may have common stock publicly listed. Some companies may for various reasons delist some or all of their shares from the public market and common stock may then be converted to limited common stock, other stock or be liquidated altogether.

Common stock listings may be used as a way for companies to increase their equity capital in exchange for dividend rights for shareowners. Listed common stock typically comes in the form of several stock classes in order for companies to remain in partial control of their stock voting rights. Non-voting stock may be issued as a separate class.

<doc id="637374" wikidata="Q3531336" url="?curid=637374" title="Tommy Maddox">
<text>Thomas Alfred Maddox (born September 2, 1971) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for nine seasons in the National Football League (NFL), most notably with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He also played one season each for the New Jersey Red Dogs of the Arena Football League (AFL) and the Los Angeles Xtreme of the XFL. In the XFL&#x27;s only season, Maddox was the league&#x27;s most valuable player (MVP) while leading the Xtreme to victory in the league&#x27;s championship.

Maddox played college football for the UCLA Bruins and was selected by the Denver Broncos in the first round of the 1992 NFL draft with the 25th overall pick. His first four seasons with the Broncos, Los Angeles Rams, and New York Giants saw limited playing time and minimal success, resulting in him being out of the NFL by 1997. Maddox became an insurance agent before pursuing a professional comeback in the AFL and XFL between 2000 and 2001. His MVP season with the latter saw Maddox lead the league in passing yards and touchdowns, while being the only quarterback to start all 10 regular season games.

Following his XFL success, Maddox signed with the Steelers the same year. He became the team&#x27;s starting quarterback during the 2002 season, helping lead them to the playoffs and earning Comeback Player of the Year. Maddox lost his starting position to rookie Ben Roethlisberger in 2004, although he was part of the team that won Super Bowl XL. He was released by Pittsburgh after the championship, leading to his final professional retirement. Maddox is one of four players on the Xtreme&#x27;s championship-winning team who were also on a Super Bowl-winning team.

==Early life==
Born in Shreveport, Louisiana, Maddox graduated from L. D. Bell High School at Hurst, Texas in 1989. At L. D. Bell, Maddox lettered in football, basketball, and baseball. As a senior, he was team captain, and was named the Southwest Texas Offensive Player of the Year, District Most Valuable Player, and the Area Most Valuable Player.

==College career==
Maddox played two seasons (1990–1991) of college football as quarterback at UCLA. In 1990, Maddox completed 182 of 327 (55.7%) of his passes for 2,682 yards, 17 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions. UCLA went 5–6 in 1990. The following season, Maddox led UCLA to a 9–3 record and the 1991 John Hancock Bowl title with a 209-for-343 (60.9%) completion rate for 2,681 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions. In his two years with UCLA, Maddox became the first Pac-10 player to pass 5,000 yards by sophomore year. In a Friday night news conference on January 31, 1992, Maddox announced his intention to declare for the 1992 NFL draft, reading from a prepared statement: &quot;While I fully understand that another year or two at UCLA would be enjoyable and beneficial to my development, I feel that it is time for me to stand on my feet as a man and take on the opportunities offered by the NFL.&quot; Maddox also announced his upcoming marriage and further explained: &quot;Playing in the NFL has been a dream of mine since childhood, and it&#x27;s a gut feeling that the time is now right.&quot;

===College career===
==Professional career==

===Denver Broncos===

====1992====
Maddox was selected by the Denver Broncos in the first round (25th overall) of the 1992 NFL draft. Covering the draft for television, Joe Theismann commented that Maddox should have stayed at UCLA for another year.

His selection by the Broncos did not sit well with Elway since the Broncos had greater needs at several other positions, which Elway felt should have been addressed with their first pick instead of using it on Maddox. However, Elway understood that Maddox had no control over the Broncos selection and was always professional in dealing with him, doing what he could to incorporate Maddox into the Broncos system. Maddox was expected to succeed John Elway as starting quarterback. As a rookie, Maddox served under coach Dan Reeves. Maddox took his first snaps during the Week 6 (October 6) game against the Washington Redskins, completing 2-of-8 passes for 10 yards and one interception in the 34–3 loss. In that game, Maddox became the youngest NFL quarterback to complete a pass since Elmer Angsman in 1946. Maddox took over the week 11 (November 15) game after Elway left with a shoulder injury, and he led the Broncos to a 27–13 victory over the New York Giants. Maddox would start the following four games from weeks 12-to-15, all losses. In his debut start in the week 12 24–0 loss to the Los Angeles Raiders, Maddox went 18-of-26 (69.2%) for 207 yards and two interceptions (both by Terry McDaniel), was sacked four times, and committed three fumbles (including one lost). Maddox only learned that he would start three hours before kickoff. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; account of the game reported: &quot;Every time Denver moved the ball, Maddox would be pressured, sacked or simply dropped the ball.&quot;

The following week, in a 16–13 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Maddox threw his first touchdown pass professionally, connecting with wide receiver Mark Jackson.

====1993====
Under coach Wade Phillips, Maddox played all games in 1993 as the placekicker&#x27;s holder. On Week 14 (December 5), in a 13–10 loss to the San Diego Chargers, Maddox completed one pass for one yard to linebacker Dave Wyman in a fake field goal attempt.

===Los Angeles Rams (1994)===
On August 27, 1994, the Los Angeles Rams traded a fourth-round 1995 NFL draft pick to the Broncos and acquired Maddox, as the salary cap forced the Broncos to trade him. Initially, Maddox was the Rams&#x27; third-string quarterback behind Chris Miller and Chris Chandler. With the Rams in 1994, Maddox played in five games as placekick holder and played as quarterback in two of those games. In an 8–5 loss to the Atlanta Falcons on Week 5 (October 2), Maddox was 7-for-15 in completed passes for 86 yards and 2 interceptions. In Week 12 (November 20), Maddox completed 3 out of 4 passes for one 55-yard drive to set up a field goal. This drive included a career-long 39-yard pass to Todd Kinchen. The Rams finished the 1994 season 4–12 and would move to St. Louis next season.

===New York Giants===
====1995====
Three days after the St. Louis Rams released him, Maddox signed as a free agent with the New York Giants on August 30, 1995, playing again under coach Dan Reeves. Maddox served as Dave Brown&#x27;s backup and played all 16 games as the placekick holder. In three games, Maddox replaced Brown as quarterback. Maddox replaced an injured Brown in the second half of the Week 7 (October 15) game against the Philadelphia Eagles. Although Maddox completed his first pass, Maddox finished 6-for-23 for 49 yards, three interceptions, and one sack in the 17–14 loss. In the Week 12 (November 19) game, again against the Eagles, Maddox took over for Brown, late in the fourth quarter. Maddox was sacked once for four yards and lost one fumble.

====1996====
In the Giants&#x27; 24–17 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars in the first exhibition game of 1996, Maddox played during the second half. In that game, Maddox fumbled his first snap from the line of scrimmage, and the Jaguars recovered that fumble. Maddox would repeat this mistake twice but would lead the game-winning drive.

Maddox started the second exhibition game of 1996, but the Giants lost that game 37–27 to the expansion Baltimore Ravens. Maddox was 5-of-10 for 42 yards, one touchdown, one interception, and two fumbles. The Giants released Maddox on August 20, 1996.

===Atlanta Falcons and hiatus from football (1997–1999)===
Maddox again joined coach Dan Reeves with the Atlanta Falcons but was released after training camp on August 18, 1997. In a preseason 35–31 loss to the Washington Redskins on August 16, Maddox completed only 4-of-11 passes for 35 yards and threw an interception during a potential game-winning drive.

On November 17, 1997, Maddox became an insurance agent with Allstate based in Dallas. In 1999, NFL Films did a feature on Maddox. While in Dallas, Maddox continued practicing football regularly and was a volunteer coach with his alma mater L. D. Bell High School.

===New Jersey Red Dogs (2000)===
After getting a phone call from the New Jersey Red Dogs of the Arena Football League in 1999, Maddox sold his insurance office and joined the team. With the Red Dogs, Maddox completed 284-of-490 passes for 3,800 yards, 64 touchdowns and 15 interceptions.

===Los Angeles Xtreme (2001)===
Maddox became the starting quarterback for the XFL team Los Angeles Xtreme during the first week of the season, despite the team using its first pick in the XFL Draft on quarterback Scott Milanovich. Maddox made an impact in his time in the XFL. He was the only quarterback of the league to start all 10 regular season games, led the league in passing yards, touchdowns, rushed for two touchdowns, and led the Xtreme to the Million Dollar Game, also known as the &quot;Big Game At The End.&quot; The Xtreme defeated the San Francisco Demons with a score of 38–6. Maddox was named the XFL MVP in 2001. The XFL folded after its inaugural 2001 season.

===Pittsburgh Steelers===
====2001====
Maddox signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2001 as backup to Kordell Stewart. His first game action was in Week 7 (October 29) in a 34–7 win over the Tennessee Titans, in which Maddox completed one 57-yard pass to Troy Edwards. In the final game of the season on Week 17 (January 6, 2002), Maddox completed 6-of-8 passes for 97 yards, a touchdown pass to Bobby Shaw, an interception, a sack, and an eight-yard rush. The 2001 Steelers finished 13–3 and first in the American Football Conference Central Division and lost the AFC Championship game to eventual Super Bowl XXXVI champion New England Patriots.

====2002====
In Week 4, Maddox replaced Kordell Stewart at quarterback and led a come from behind win against the Cleveland Browns. With 2:02 left in regulation, Maddox ended a seven-play, 84-yard drive with a 10-yard touchdown pass to Plaxico Burress to tie the game. Steelers coach Bill Cowher officially named Maddox the starter on October 2, 2002. Maddox started his first NFL game since 1992 against the New Orleans Saints, which was a 32–29 loss. He went 22-for-38 passing, Maddox threw for 268 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception. He was sacked four times for 24 yards and lost a fumble. In Week 6 (October 13), Maddox won in his third start with the Steelers in a 34–7 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. Maddox was 16-for-25 for 216 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions, and two sacks.

The Steelers played a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game on Week 7 with a 28–10 win over the Indianapolis Colts and quarterback Peyton Manning. Maddox passed 25-for-33 for 305 yards, three touchdowns and led the Steelers to touchdowns for the team&#x27;s first three drives. Since an 0–2 start under Kordell Stewart, the Steelers had gone 4–1 under Maddox.

In Week 10 (November 10), the Steelers tied against the Atlanta Falcons, 34–34, the first tied NFL game since 1997. Maddox passed for 473 yards on 28-for-41 passing with four touchdowns and one interception. He was sacked once for three yards and rushed twice for seven yards. On the final play of overtime, Maddox completed a 50-yard pass to Plaxico Burress as time expired that ultimately came up one yard short of what would have been the game-winning touchdown. Maddox left the Week 11 (November 17) game, a 31–23 loss to the Tennessee Titans, in an ambulance after being tripped by Lance Schulters. Kordell Stewart played the following game in Week 12 (November 24), a 29–21 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, while Maddox recovered from his injuries. Coach Bill Cowher chose to start Stewart the following game. Pittsburgh would win that Week 13 (December 1) game over the Jacksonville Jaguars 25–23. Maddox returned as starter in Week 14 (December 8), but the Steelers lost to the expansion team Houston Texans 24–6 as Maddox went down with six sacks and lost a fumble and had 30-for-57 passes for 325 yards and ended the game with a 55.1 quarterback rating. Aaron Glenn, Texans cornerback, returned two Maddox interceptions for 70 and 65 yards. Maddox, however, would lead the Steelers to victories in the final three games of 2002.

With 13 starts, Maddox led the Steelers into the playoffs as an aerial circus-type passing attack, with a 10–5–1 record in 2002. For the season, Maddox completed 234-of-377 passes (62.1%) for 2,836 yards, 20 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions. He was sacked 26 times for 148 yards, rushed 19 times for 43 yards, and committed eight fumbles (with three lost fumbles). Maddox&#x27;s passer rating for 2002 was 85.2.

Rallying the Steelers from a 24–7 deficit, Maddox delivered a comeback 36–33 win over the Browns at home, on 30-of-48 passing for 367 yards, and three touchdowns, in the wild card round before a 34–31 overtime loss at the Tennessee Titans in the divisional round.

====2003====
Maddox led the Steelers to a Week 1 (September 7) 34–15 victory in Heinz Field over rival Baltimore Ravens and rookie quarterback Kyle Boller. With a 134.3 passer rating, Maddox completed 21-for-29 passes for 260 yards and three touchdowns. Hines Ward caught two of the touchdowns and Jay Riemersma one. Although Maddox passed for 336 yards the following game in a Week 2 (September 14) 41–20 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Maddox regressed statistically, with 28-for-47 passing, one touchdown, three interceptions, four sacks, and a 62.0 rating. In Week 3 (September 21), the Steelers beat the Cincinnati Bengals at home, 17–10. On 21-of-34 passing, Maddox passed for 240 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Late in the second quarter, Maddox successfully completed a trick play called &quot;Bengal&quot;, in which on field goal formation (fourth-and-three at the 50), Maddox took the snap on his knee and passed to Jerame Tuman, who advanced 23 yards to the Bengals&#x27; nine yard line. This trick play would lead to a touchdown and Steelers 7–0 edge at halftime. With 5:54 left in the fourth quarter, the Steelers ran down the clock the point where Maddox took a knee to seal the victory. Afterwards, the Steelers would lose five in a row and fall to 2–6 for the first half of the season. The five-game losing streak included a 33–13 loss in Week 5 (October 5) to rival Cleveland Browns, the team that Pittsburgh eliminated from the previous season&#x27;s playoffs. On 11-of-24 passing for 136 yards and a 29.2 passer rating, Maddox threw two interceptions and lost one fumble; Cleveland cornerback Daylon McCutcheon returned one interception 75 yards for a touchdown. At Mile High Stadium on Week 6 (October 12), Pittsburgh lost 17–14 to the Denver Broncos. This game was Maddox&#x27;s first interception-free game since Week 1, but Maddox was sacked seven times for 56 yards.

Alternating wins and losses in the second half of the season, the Steelers went 4–4 to finish 2003 with a 6–10 record. Maddox completed a 16-yard touchdown pass to Hines Ward with nearly one minute left in the Week 13 (November 30) game against the Cincinnati Bengals and put the Steelers up 20–17, but the Bengals would score a touchdown in the final minute to win 24–20 and dash any chance that the Steelers would make the playoffs. Although Maddox broke the team record this season for most single-season completions, the Steelers offense ranked only 22nd league-wide.

====2004====
In the first round of the 2004 NFL draft, the Steelers drafted quarterback Ben Roethlisberger as the 11th overall pick. The pick of Roethlisberger indicated that Maddox might have earned the lowest salary ($750,000) among all starting NFL quarterbacks. Consequently, Maddox negotiated salary raises with Steelers owner Dan Rooney before the draft.

Maddox started the first two games of 2004: a Week 1 (September 12) victory over the Oakland Raiders, 24–21, and a Week 2 (September 19) 30–13, loss to the Baltimore Ravens. Against Oakland, Maddox was 13-of-22 (59.1%) in passing for 142 yards. Maddox left the game against Baltimore with an elbow sprain in the third quarter, and Roethlisberger took over as quarterback. Roethlisberger was named the new starting quarterback as Maddox would be sidelined until November. As starter, Roethlisberger would lead Pittsburgh to a franchise-record 13-game winning streak but would go down with a rib injury during the Week 16 (December 26) 20–7 win over Baltimore, the game that marked the 13th straight win. (Baltimore defensive end Terrell Suggs caused both injuries to Maddox and Roethlisberger that forced them to leave their games against the Ravens.) Maddox played during the fourth quarter. In the game, Maddox completed one pass to Verron Haynes for no gain, and the Steelers relied mostly on running plays by Haynes, Jerome Bettis, and Hines Ward. This scheme allowed Pittsburgh to keep the ball for the last 7:45 of the game. Maddox would start the final game of the season on January 2, 2005 (Week 17) in a 29–24 win over the Buffalo Bills that eliminated the Bills from playoff contention. Maddox completed 12-of-24 passes for 120 yards, a touchdown, and two interceptions. The Steelers became the first AFC team in NFL history to finish the regular season with a 15–1 record. In the playoffs, the Steelers would advance to the AFC championship and lose to eventual Super Bowl XXXIX champion New England Patriots.

====2005====
In October 2005, Maddox returned as starter after Roethlisberger suffered a knee injury. In Week 6 (October 16), the Steelers lost Maddox&#x27;s first start of the season to the Jacksonville Jaguars 23–17 as Maddox completed only 11 of 28 passes for 154 yards, 1 touchdown, and 3 interceptions. In a press conference following the loss, coach Bill Cowher stated he regretted not substituting third-stringer Charlie Batch for Maddox and not having Jerome Bettis in for more running plays. Cowher would demote Maddox to third string behind Batch. Maddox&#x27;s next game would be in Week 10 (November 13), a 34–21 victory over the Cleveland Browns, in which Maddox completed 4 of 7 passes for 22 yards. As Roethlisberger was undergoing knee surgery, Maddox would next start on Week 11 (November 20) against the Baltimore Ravens. Pittsburgh lost to Baltimore 16–13 in overtime, and Maddox was 19-for-36 for 230 yards, a touchdown, an interception, and a lost fumble. Although Maddox led the game-tying touchdown drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Willie Parker, Maddox threw an interception to Terrell Suggs during the Steelers&#x27; final drive in regulation. This would be Maddox&#x27;s final game of his career. The Steelers would win Super Bowl XL over the Seattle Seahawks in the postseason, but Maddox was among a handful of Steelers players, including linebacker James Harrison, who opted not to attend the ceremony at the White House honoring their Super Bowl championship. On March 3, 2006, the Steelers released Maddox for salary cap reasons.

In September 2006, Maddox tried out for the Oakland Raiders.

Maddox signed a contract with the Philadelphia Soul of the Arena Football League but was waived in November 2006.

On December 8, 2006, Maddox worked out for the Dallas Cowboys.

<text>Marist University is a private university in Poughkeepsie, New York, United State. Marist was founded by the Marist Brothers, a Catholic religious institute, in 1905 to prepare brothers for their vocations as educators. By 1969, the college had become private with a predominantly lay board of trustees, and in 2003 the Catholic Church recognized Marist as a secular institution.

In 1929, Marist became accredited by the state to offer a wider range of degrees in the arts and sciences. Today, Marist offers 47 bachelor&#x27;s programs, 11 master&#x27;s programs, one doctoral program and two certificate programs in many academic disciplines. Marist&#x27;s 180-acre main campus overlooks the Hudson River and is situated along its east banks. Marist has a branch campus in Florence, Italy and offers 50 semester or academic year abroad options.

A member of NCAA Division I, Marist sponsors 23 collegiate sports.

==History==

===Foundation as a training institution for Marist Brothers===

The Marist Brothers, a Catholic society founded in France by Saint Marcellin Champagnat in 1816, focused on educational work throughout the world. In 1905, members of the order arrived in the Mid-Hudson Valley to establish the first Marist house of studies in the United States. On the east bank of the Hudson River, just north of Poughkeepsie, they purchased property and a house from Thomas McPherson. They named the building and property &quot;Saint Ann&#x27;s Hermitage&quot;, in memory of Champagnat&#x27;s Hermitage in France, and began training young men for a life of &quot;study, work, prayer and service&quot; (from which the school motto is derived).

In 1908, the Brothers purchased the Edward Bech estate to enable the hermitage to expand, increasing the size of their property to .

By 1929, the training center at the hermitage had evolved into the Marist Normal Training School, offering college-level courses under the auspices of Fordham University. The charter for the Marist Normal Training School was obtained by Leo Brouilette. In 1946, the State of New York granted the institution an official four-year college charter under the name Marian College, led by Paul Ambrose Fontaine, FMS. Marian College continued the mission of training Marist Brothers as teachers of the congregation&#x27;s schools.

From 1947 to 1957, the Brothers began working on the weekends, during summers, and in their spare time to build a gymnasium (the original Marian Hall), Our Lady Seat of Wisdom Chapel, Adrian Hall (which was demolished in 2001), and a residence for the student Brothers (the original Fontaine Hall).

The Marist University Library was originally housed on the top floor of Greystone in 1928. In 1945, reference, periodical and work areas took over the second floor as well, and then in 1949, the library also claimed Greystone&#x27;s lowest level. The library remained in Greystone for 35 years.

In 1958, Marist Brother Linus Richard Foy took charge of the college. At 28, he was the youngest college president in the United States. Two years later, Marian College became Marist College and the mission of the college broadened to include the wider community; lay male students were admitted to pursue degree study. An evening division was also introduced to serve the educational needs of the surrounding communities.

Sheahan Hall, the first residence hall, opened in 1962. It was named for Monsignor J. F. Sheahan (pastor of St. Peter&#x27;s Church, Poughkeepsie) without whom the Marist Brothers might not have been able to purchase the Bech Estate that now comprises the entire south campus area. It was quickly followed by Leo Hall in 1963 and Champagnat Hall in 1965. They were named for Leo Brouiletter (Provincial of the Marist Brothers, 1921–1930) and Saint Marcellin Champagnat respectively. Donnelly Hall (named for Nilus Donnelly, who supervised construction of the 12 major campus facilities built by the Brothers), a dormitory at the time, was built in 1962 by the brothers themselves.

Women were admitted to the evening division classes in 1966, then to the day classes in 1968. Marist&#x27;s president, Linus Foy, resigned from the Marist Brothers around this time but continued serving as president. Benoit House and Gregory House were erected in 1968 as a residence for the Marist Brothers living on campus. Benoit House honored the memory of Francis Xavier Benoit who taught at Marist for nineteen years, while serving also as Director of Construction for the Marist Brothers. Gregory House was named in memory of Joseph Gregory Marchessault who was chairman of the Physics Department at Marist at the time of his death in 1969. Benoit and Gregory Houses became African American and Free University centers, respectively, during the sixties and seventies. They functioned as residences before being removed to make way for the Hancock Technology Center in 2009.

In 1969, due to the institution&#x27;s rapid expansion and laws regulating federal aid to religiously affiliated educational institutions in New York State, ownership of the college was transferred from the Marist Brothers to the Marist College Educational Corporation with an independent, predominantly lay board of trustees.

In the 1970s, programs for the educationally disadvantaged were expanded, a computer center was added, graduate programs in business administration and community psychology were instituted, and the James J. McCann Recreation Center was completed.

In 1973, President Foy began a cooperative program with area secondary schools, in which selected high school seniors would take freshman courses and &quot;bridge&quot; into college. In fall 1974, the college expanded its commitment to continuing education by increasing course offerings in the evening division and summer session and in 1984, opened an off-campus extension center in Fishkill; A second extension center was opened in the Orange County town of Goshen in fall 1993.

The burgeoning library, then known as The Spellman Library, was moved from Greystone to Donnelly Hall, in the area now occupied by the Computer Center and DN256, in 1963. Space constraints required moving the library again to Fontaine Hall in 1975.

On February 18, 1975, freshman Shelley Sperling was shot and killed in the dining hall by her ex-boyfriend, Louis Acevedo.

===Modern day===
In 1979, Dennis J. Murray was selected to be Marist&#x27;s president. Under his leadership, enrollment more than doubled and the Poughkeepsie campus expanded to its current size of . Every building on campus was renovated or newly constructed and numerous strategic partnerships were formed.

One of the first strategic partnerships was formed with IBM, a major employer in the Mid-Hudson Valley. In 1984, Marist received $2.5 million in equipment and almost $2 million in software from IBM to expand academic and administrative uses of computers on campus.

One of the first construction projects was the Foy Townhouses, named after Linus Richard Foy, completed in 1982. Marian Hall was built in 1983 within and around the college&#x27;s first gymnasium. It incorporates the first building to be constructed through the manual labor of the Brothers (1947). Because it is located adjacent to the spot where the Marian building (the college&#x27;s principal classroom building) once stood, it carries on the name of that building as well as the original of the four-year college.

To expand student housing, Gartland Commons was built on the north end of the campus in 1985. It was an apartment community, housing approximately 300 students. It was torn down in 2015.

In 1987, the Lowell Thomas Communications Center opened, providing space for communications, math, and computer science studies. The building was built over the site of an outdoor swimming pool from the early days of Marist that was fed by a natural spring.

In 1990, the Margaret M and Charles H Dyson Center opened, providing a home for the School of Management, School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, and School of Graduate and Continuing Education.

Construction continued in 1994 with a $27 million Student Center, bookstore, dining facilities, art gallery, and a new adjoining dormitory (Midrise Hall) In 1996, Talmadge Court was purchased by the college as an official student residence.

In 1997 the college purchased a private residence, St. Ann&#x27;s, which is part of the area now known as Fern Tor, located on the college&#x27;s northern boundary. It is named after the original St. Ann&#x27;s Hermitage which burned to the ground in 1958.

In 1998, across neighboring Route 9, the Lower West Cedar townhouses were built and the former Poughkeepsie Steel Plant was purchased to temporarily house the library while the original Fontaine Hall was razed and a new library constructed in its place. The Poughkeepsie Steel Plant is now the home of the fine arts program and includes a art gallery. The Art Gallery retains the industrial look of the former steel plant with concrete floors and exposed 15-foot ceilings.

Completed in 1999 and built out of fieldstone with a concentrated focus on technology, the James A. Cannavino Library is considered to be the jewel and the heart of the main campus. Architecturally, the library unifies the college&#x27;s historic district of Greystone, St. Peter&#x27;s, and the Kieran Gatehouse, three 1860s-era buildings that are listed on the New York State and National Register of Historic Places, which are also made of fieldstone. The library is named for James A. Cannavino, a long-time member of the Marist Board of Trustees.

A new Fontaine Hall was completed on the north end of campus in 2000 to replace the original building that was razed in 1998. The building holds four classrooms, a multimedia &quot;black box&quot; theatre and two conference rooms, including the striking Henry Hudson Room – a large conference space with skylights and a beautiful view of the Hudson. It also holds The School of Liberal Arts offices and faculty, the Office of College Advancement, which includes the offices of Public Affairs and Alumni Affairs.

With student enrollment increasing and a lack of housing for upperclassmen, the school purchased additional land across Route 9 for expansion. Upper West Cedar, built in 2000, was constructed in a similar style to the Lower West Cedar Townhouses. The Upper Fulton Townhouses followed in 2004 and then the Lower Fulton Townhouses in 2008. These housing areas are connected by a central walkway that leads to the main campus. Also, the Upper Fulton Townhouses were featured on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; in 2007 for a report on how some colleges and universities were building nicer dormitories to attract more students.
The housing expansion was a sore point with the Poughkeepsie residents, who blamed the college for excessive traffic on the Route 9 corridor. The New York State Department of Transportation and Marist University both blame massively increasing population in the Mid-Hudson Valley, a result of the migration of the residents of nearby New York City starting in late 2001. In May 2007, Marist was granted a variance allowing them to build despite a moratorium on new construction in the area.

Marist&#x27;s independence was emphasized in 2003, when Marist invited New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer to deliver the commencement address for the graduating class, incurring protests due to Spitzer&#x27;s public support of abortion rights. In response to complaints, then-president Murray assured the Archdiocese of New York that &quot;Marist College is truly independent, and does not identify itself as a Catholic college in any way.&quot; (Although Marist had become independent in 1969, under Pope John Paul II&#x27;s decree &quot;Ex Corde Ecclesiae&quot;, all colleges that claimed to be Catholic prior to 1991 were considered by the church to be Catholic until declared otherwise by a bishop.) Subsequently, Cardinal Edward Egan stated that Marist &quot;is no longer a Catholic institution&quot; and therefore not under the Church&#x27;s jurisdiction.

The institution&#x27;s Longview Park was completed in 2007 with a bike/walk path along the Hudson&#x27;s shore, a fishing pier, the renovation of the historic Cornell boathouse, and better access to scenic vistas, particularly from the gazebo built on a promontory in the center of the park.

In September 2009 Marist was bequeathed $75 million by the industrialist Raymond A. Rich. The donation consisted of the Col. Oliver Hazard Payne Estate located in the Ulster County town of Esopus plus $10 million. The mansion was designed by Carrère and Hastings, who also designed the New York Public Library Main Branch. The donation was used to establish the Raymond A. Rich Leadership Institute, which has since been focusing on teaching students the communication, interpersonal, and social skills necessary to lead complex organizations in a global setting. The gift was the twelfth largest donation in America in 2009.

In spring 2011, Marist completed construction of a new technology building, the Hancock Center, which is on the main campus where the Benoit and Gregory (residence houses) used to stand. The building is designed in a Gothic architecture style by the firm of Robert A. M. Stern. It comprises three computer labs, Marist Institute for Public Opinion, nine classrooms, six seminar rooms and a trading room for the business school.

During summer 2011, the New York State Department of Transportation completed a pedestrian underpass under US 9 to facilitate safer movement between the sections of campus, which the boulevard separates. Its construction eliminated a pedestrian-only traffic signal. In addition, one entrance near the Lowell Thomas Communication Center was closed to vehicular traffic. All three entrances were renovated and the main gate closed to vehicular traffic.

In the fall of 2013 construction of a new academic building to house the Music Department and renovations to the Lowell Thomas Communications Center, the student center and the dining hall were completed.

During the winter of 2015 a new science building was completed on the east campus.

In January 2018 construction of 4 new student housing buildings on the north side of the main campus was completed.

In September 2018 Marist announced that it will partner with Nuvance Health (formerly Health Quest) to create a medical school. Plans call for the construction of a building on the Vassar Brothers Medical Center campus in the City of Poughkeepsie, which will house school administration and classroom space. The proposed school will be named the Marist Nuvance School of Medicine. Plans for the medical school have since been put on hold indefinitely.

In January 2019 a major renovation and addition to the Steel Plant was completed. The new building features the renovated original 12,000-square-foot historic industrial Steel Plant Building and a 35,000-square-foot addition housing the Fine Arts, Digital Media, and Fashion Programs.

In October 2021, Kevin Weinman became the institution&#x27;s fifth president.

In August 2024, Marist completed a major renovation and addition to the Dyson Center. The new four-story, 107,000-square-foot building houses The School of Management and School of Social and Behavioral Sciences.

Marist College was renamed Marist University on January 29, 2025.

==Campuses==

The main campus, with an area of , is on the east bank of the Hudson River in the town of Poughkeepsie, New York, on US 9 in the historic Hudson Valley; it was a census-designated place in 2019. The part of the main campus east of US 9 is called the east campus. In addition to the main campus Marist owns the Payne Estate which has on the west bank of the Hudson River in the town of Esopus, in Ulster County, the Marist Executive Center encompassing the 14th floor of 420 Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan and a branch campus in Florence Italy. In 2004, Marist announced its Campus Master Plan, which called for the development of a pedestrian-friendly campus heart, with plenty of open and inviting green spaces for interaction. The creation of this campus heart involved the connection of the east and west campuses, the continued improvement of academic and recreational spaces, the addition of green space, and the relocation of parking to the periphery. The master plan is still being implemented, but the progress to date has created what many consider one of the more beautiful campuses in the Northeastern United States.

The area around the campus first appeared as a census-designated place (CDP) in the 2020 U.S. Census, with a population of 2,894.

===Branch campus in Florence, Italy===
The Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici School campus consists of ten buildings totaling , in the historic San Lorenzo district of the Florence city center. The main building, situated in Via Faenza, dates back to the 13th century and originated as a convent connected to a medieval church, San Jacopo in Campo Corbolini. This church, now deconsecrated, was founded in 1206 and for its first hundred years belonged to the Knights Templar. The facilities include studio space, lecture classrooms, and design workshops. Marist offers two housing options to its students: dedicated Marist residences and apartments that are located through the city.

===Payne Estate===
===Executive Center===
The Marist Executive Center encompasses the entire 14th floor of 420 Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan. The New York City location, , functions as a central location for academic offerings for graduate, adult, undergraduate, and corporate programs. Additionally, it serves as a featured location for prominent events such as the Marist Fashion Program&quot;s ongoing involvement with New York Fashion Week, programs featuring the nationally recognized Marist Poll, seminars and lecture series, receptions, and alumni networking events.

==Residential life==

Marist has standard dormitory buildings for all freshman students. There are townhouse and apartment facilities for upperclassmen. Freshman housing consists of four hall-style dormitories: Marian Hall, housing 100 students; Sheahan Hall, housing 140 students; Leo Hall, housing 300 students; and Champagnat Hall, housing over 400 students. Housing is guaranteed for freshmen and sophomores, but not for juniors and seniors. There is enough housing to hold a large portion of the upperclassmen. Townhouses, most of which were built within the last fifteen years, and the four north end residence halls make up all of the housing available for upperclassmen. Additionally, the Upper Fulton townhouses were featured on Good Morning America for a story on how some colleges and universities are constructing nicer student housing to attract more students. In Fulton housing students all have their own room; there are eight students in one townhouse with two bathrooms and a large kitchen and living area. 

All underclassmen live on the west side of Route 9, which is the main part of campus. Upperclassmen reside on the east side of Route 9, which is also considered the &quot;wet side&quot; of campus because the consumption of alcohol is allowed for students over the age of 21. Upperclassmen also reside in the north end residence halls on the main campus. While all incoming freshmen are assigned to a dorm, the housing for other classes is determined via a points system. Under the priority points system, students accumulate a certain number of points from clubs, sports, and grade point average. The students with the highest points are allowed to choose housing first, thus filling the nicer housing first. The students with the lower points choose last and are not always guaranteed housing. If students are entering as a group, the students&#x27; points are averaged together. According to Marist, this system promotes student activity in clubs and sports and offers an incentive to keep a high GPA.

==Academics==

Marist University offers 47 Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, 11 master&#x27;s degrees, and 2 certificate programs. These programs are divided between the six undergraduate schools and the School of Global and Professional Programs. The undergraduate schools are The School of Communication and the Arts, The School of Computer Science and Mathematics, The School of Liberal Arts, The School of Management, The School of Science and The School of Social and Behavioral Sciences.

All undergraduate Marist students must take what is known as &quot;core&quot; classes during their four years in order to graduate. There are a number of different 3-credit core classes students can take, usually consisting of writing, history, cultural diversity, and a philosophy class. The requirements are the same for all majors and emphasize Marist&#x27;s tradition of a liberal arts education while ensuring that students are introduced to a broad range of disciplines. The student-faculty ratio at Marist is 16:1, and the school has over 50 percent of its classes with fewer than 20 students. The average freshman retention rate is 88.8 percent.

Undergraduate admission to Marist is selective. The incoming 2026 freshman class had 49% of the 11,260 applicants accepted. The middle 50% of admitted students scored between 1220 and 1350 on the Math and Evidence-Based Reading and Writing sections of the SAT. The middle 50% of accepted students scored between 26 and 30 on the ACT. The middle 50% of accepted students took between 2 and 6 AP Courses.

===IBM partnership===
Marist also has had a longstanding partnership with IBM. IBM tests concepts and applications in education, business and communication. The joint study began in 1988 with the installation of a $10 million IBM 3090 mainframe computer on campus. In the fall 2002 semester, the institution installed a new zSeries 900 mainframe that provided a level of computing power ordinarily associated with large research universities and Fortune 500 companies. In 2009, Marist and IBM began three research projects involving grid computing, e-learning applications, and computing on demand.
In December 2011, it was announced that Marist and IBM were also working towards developing a &quot;cloud computing&quot; center to be housed at Marist&#x27;s Hancock Center. In early 2012, the School of Computer Science and Mathematics installed two IBM z114 mainframes with a zEnterprise BladeCenter Extension (zBX), making Marist the first college or university in the world to have this combination. The project has since been named The IBM SmartCloud solution at Marist University. In October 2019, Marist installed the world&#x27;s first IBM LinuxONE III, a secured enterprise platform for mission-critical applications and sensitive data for hybrid cloud.

Sponsored women&#x27;s teams are softball, volleyball, and water polo, while sponsored men&#x27;s teams are baseball and football. These varsity programs involve more than 550 Marist student-athletes. The crew programs are among the few in the nation that claim on-campus facilities. Marist has been recognized by Sports Illustrated as having one of the top 200 college athletic programs in the U.S. Student athletes at Marist routinely excel in the classroom. In 2019 for the 18th straight year Marist led the MAAC with 262 selections to the conference&#x27;s Academic Honor Roll. Marist also had 57 student athletes selected to the PFL&#x27;s Academic Honor Roll and four men&#x27;s rowers named to the Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA) 2019 All-Academic Team.

===Club and intramural sports===
In addition to Division I programs, the Department of Athletics also offers many other sports on the club and intramural levels. Club sports are very popular and give Marist students the opportunity to compete against other colleges and universities without the strict requirements of the NCAA. Club sports offered at Marist include men&#x27;s ice hockey, which competes in the American Collegiate Hockey Association, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rugby, cheerleading, men&#x27;s volleyball, equestrian, fencing, bowling, skiing, dance and ultimate, among others.

<text>Field Marshal John Colborne, 1st Baron Seaton, (16 February 1778 – 17 April 1863) was a British Army officer and colonial governor. After taking part as a junior officer in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, Sir Ralph Abercromby&#x27;s expedition to Egypt and then the War of the Third Coalition, he served as military secretary to Sir John Moore at the Battle of Corunna. He then commanded the 2nd Battalion of the 66th Regiment of Foot and, later, the 52nd Regiment of Foot at many of the battles of the Peninsular War. At the Battle of Waterloo, Colborne on his own initiative brought the 52nd Regiment of Foot forward, took up a flanking position in relation to the French Imperial Guard and then, after firing repeated volleys into their flank, charged at the Guard so driving them back in disorder.

He went on to become commander-in-chief of all the armed forces in British North America, personally leading the offensive at the Battle of Saint-Eustache in Lower Canada and defeating the rebel force in December 1837. After that he was high commissioner of the Ionian Islands and then Commander-in-Chief, Ireland.

==Early career and the Peninsular War==
Born in Lymington, Hampshire the only son of Samuel Colborne also from Lymington and Cordelia Anne Colborne (née Garstin), Colborne was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital in London and at Winchester College. He was commissioned as an ensign in the 20th Regiment of Foot on 10 July 1794 securing all subsequent steps in his regimental promotion without purchase. Promoted to lieutenant on 4 September 1795 and to captain lieutenant on 11 August 1799, he saw action at the Battle of Alkmaar in October 1799, where he was wounded, during the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland. Promoted to brevet captain on 12 January 1800, he took part in Sir Ralph Abercromby&#x27;s expedition to Egypt in August 1801 and was wounded again.

Colborne was deployed with his regiment to Italy where he distinguished himself at the Battle of Maida in July 1806 during the War of the Third Coalition. He became military secretary to General Henry Fox in 1806 and then became military secretary to Sir John Moore with the rank of major on 21 January 1808. In this capacity he accompanied Moore to Sweden in May 1808 and to Portugal in 1808 and served with him at the Battle of Benavente in December 1808 and Battle of Corunna in January 1809. It was Moore&#x27;s dying request that Colborne should be given a lieutenant colonelcy and this was complied with on 2 February 1809. He transferred to the 66th Regiment of Foot on 2 November 1809, and after returning to Spain with Sir Arthur Wellesley&#x27;s Army, he witnessed the defeat of the Spaniards at the Battle of Ocaña later that month. He commanded a brigade at the Battle of Bussaco in September 1810 and then commanded the 2nd Battalion of the 66th Regiment of Foot at the Battle of Albuera in May 1811 where his brigade was virtually annihilated by the Polish 1st Vistulan Lancers Regiment of the French Army. After transferring to the command of the 52nd Regiment of Foot he took part in the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812 where he was badly injured and had to be invalided back to England.

After recovering in England, Colborne returned to Spain and commanded the 52nd Regiment of Foot at the Siege of San Sebastián in August 1813 before taking temporary charge of the 2nd brigade of the Light Division in late 1813 and commanding it at the Battle of the Bidassoa in October 1813, at the Battle of Nivelle in November 1813 and at the Battle of the Nive in December 1813. He returned to the 52nd Regiment of Foot and commanded it at the Battle of Orthez in February 1814 and at the Battle of Toulouse in April 1814 and at the Battle of Bayonne also in April 1814. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 4 January 1815.

==Waterloo==
Colborne became aide-de-camp to the Prince Regent with the rank of colonel on 4 June 1814, and, following Napoleon&#x27;s escape from Elba, he managed to dissuade the Prince from attacking the French Army until the Duke of Wellington arrived.

At the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815 during the Hundred Days, Colborne led the 52nd Regiment of Foot. At the critical moment of the battle, when the French Imperial Guard attacked Wellington&#x27;s weakened centre, Colborne made a decisive intervention. On his own initiative, Colborne brought the 52nd Regiment of Foot forward, took up a flanking position in relation to the Imperial Guard and then, after firing repeated volleys into their flank, charged at the Guard so driving them back in disorder. As soon as General Sir Frederick Adam saw what Colborne was doing, he sent in extra troops to support him. Colborne drove forward towards La Haye Sainte, while Wellington rode back to the main line to order the general advance.

He was appointed a Knight of the Austrian Military Order of Maria Theresa on 2 August 1815. After the war he remained with his regiment as part of the Army of Occupation.

==Guernsey==
Colborne became Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey in July 1821 and was promoted to major-general on 27 May 1825.

==Canada==

In August 1828 Colborne was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. As Lieutenant Governor, Colborne increased the population of the province by 70% by initiating an organised system of immigration to bring in settlers from Britain. He also aided settlement by expanding the communication and transportation infrastructure through a campaign to build roads and bridges. He brought changes to the structure of the legislative council, increased fiscal autonomy and encouraged greater independence in the judiciary. In 1829 he founded Upper Canada College as a school based on the Elizabeth College, Guernsey model to educate boys in preparation for becoming leaders of the colonies.

During Colborne&#x27;s period of office as commander-in-chief, the Family Compact promoted resistance to the political principle of responsible government. At the end of its lifespan, the Compact would be condemned by Lord Durham as &quot;a petty corrupt insolent Tory clique&quot;. In both Upper Canada, which was under Colborne&#x27;s administration, and Lower Canada, which was under the direct administration of Colborne&#x27;s superior, Governor General Lord Gosford, this resistance to responsible government, together with conflicts between the assembly and the executive over fiscal matters, as well as a difficult economic situation, led to the Rebellions of 1837.

In January 1836 Colborne became commander-in-chief of all the armed forces in British North America. He was promoted to the local rank of lieutenant general on 8 July 1836. Colborne personally led the offensive at the Battle of Saint-Eustache in December 1837 defeating the rebel force which had become holed up in a church. His forces burnt the church and set fire to surrounding buildings. Afterwards, he led the sack of the nearby village of Saint-Benoît, burning much of the village. The French-Canadians gave him the nickname &quot;Le vieux brûlot&quot; (&quot;the old fire-breather&quot;).

Colborne was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 29 January 1838. Following Lord Gosford&#x27;s resignation in February 1838, he became acting Governor General of British North America. In Lower Canada but not Upper Canada, the 1791 constitution was suspended at this time, causing the colony&#x27;s bicameral parliament to be dissolved. To replace these bodies and assist in governing Lower Canada, Colborne established a 24-member Special Council.

Colborne stepped aside as acting Governor General until the arrival of Gosford&#x27;s formal successor, Lord Durham, on 27 May 1838. Colborne was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant-general on 28 June 1838. Durham remained in Canada only for a few months, resigning on 9 October and leaving for London on the fifth-rate HMS Inconstant on 1 November, after he learned that his policy of leniency towards the leaders of the prior year&#x27;s rebellion had been repudiated by the British Government. Durham&#x27;s departure caused Colborne to again become acting Governor General. Colborne put down a second revolt in November and was confirmed as Governor General of British North America on 14 December. He left Canada in October 1839 after the arrival of his successor, Charles Poulett Thomson (who shortly thereafter would be elevated to the peerage as Lord Sydenham). After arriving back in England, Colborne was himself elevated to the peerage as Baron Seaton, of Seaton in the County of Devon, on 5 December 1839.

In recognition of the &quot;important services&quot; rendered by Colborne, and following a message from Queen Victoria, Parliament settled an annuity of £2,000 on him and the next two heirs male who would succeed to the title.

==Later life==
Colborne became High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands in February 1843, and having been promoted to full general on 20 June 1854, he became Commander-in-Chief, Ireland, in 1855. After standing down from active service in Spring 1860, he was promoted to field marshal on 1 April 1860 and retired to his home at Beechwood House in Sparkwell.

Colborne also served as honorary colonel of the 94th Regiment of Foot, as honorary colonel of the 26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot and then as honorary colonel of the 2nd Regiment of Life Guards. He was also colonel-in-chief of the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own). He died at Valletta House in Torquay on 17 April 1863 and was buried in the churchyard of Holy Cross Church at Newton Ferrers.

In November 1866 a bronze statue of Colborne, sculpted by George Adams and financed by public donations, was erected at Mount Wise at Devonport: it was moved to Seaton Barracks in Crownhill in the early 1960s and then to Peninsula Barracks in Winchester in the 1990s. A second statue of Colborne also sculpted by George Adams was erected at Upper Canada College in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Colborne Street in London, Ontario is named after Colborne, as is the city of Port Colborne.

==Family==

In 1813 Colborne married Elizabeth Yonge; they had three daughters and five sons.

<text>A trilithon or trilith is a structure consisting of two large vertical stones (posts) supporting a third stone set horizontally across the top (lintel). It is commonly used in the context of megalithic monuments. The most famous trilithons are those of Stonehenge in England.

The word &quot;trilithon&quot; is derived from Greek &#x27;having three stones&#x27; (τρι- &quot;tri-&quot; &#x27;three&#x27; + λίθος &quot;líthos&quot; &#x27;stone&#x27;) and was first used in its modern archaeological sense by William Stukeley.

Other famous trilithons include those found in the Megalithic temples of Malta (which like Stonehenge are a UNESCO World Heritage Site), the Osireion in Egypt, and the Haʻamonga ʻa Maui in Tonga, Polynesia. The term is also used to describe the groups of three stones in the Hunebed tombs of the Netherlands.

<doc id="637406" wikidata="Q16998047" url="?curid=637406" title="Monster Fun">
<text>Monster Fun was originally a weekly British comic strip magazine for children aged seven to twelve. Published by IPC Media, it ran for 73 issues in 1975–1976, when it merged with &quot;Buster&quot;. Focused on humorous monster strips and stories, the magazine was known for &quot;The Bad Time Bedtime Books&quot; minicomic inserts, created by Leo Baxendale.

The nominal editor was &quot;Frankie Stein&quot; (a play on Frankenstein), a character who had previously appeared in the magazines &quot;Wham!&quot;, &quot;Shiver and Shake&quot;, and &quot;Whoopee!&quot;. Recurring artists included Robert Nixon, Thomas Williams, and Trevor Metcalfe.

The magazine was known for handing out free toys in its issues. The first issue, for instance, came with a free plate wobbler (a novelty item consisting of an inflatable rubber bladder and a hand-operated pump; the bladder is placed under a plate, and inflating it makes the plate wobble). The second issue had a &quot;Freaky Spider Ring&quot;, the third a &quot;Super Shaking Skeleton&quot;.

The comic was relaunched in April 2022, initially as a bi-monthly publication before moving to monthly publication.

==Publication history==
===Original IPC Run===
&quot;Monster Fun&quot;&#x27;s debut issue was dated 14 June 1975. &quot;Monster Fun Specials&quot; were printed in 1975 and 1976.

The magazine merged with &quot;Buster&quot; to form &quot;Buster and Monster Fun&quot; after the 30 October 1976 issue. Due to its ongoing popularity, the &quot;Monster Fun&quot; logo was printed on &quot;Buster&quot;&#x27;s cover until the summer of 1979.

Despite its short run, &quot;Monster Fun Annuals&quot; were printed every year, cover-dated from 1977 until 1985, though all contained some reprint material. They were all distributed in the UK from the autumn of the previous cover-dated year. &quot;Buster and Monster Fun Specials&quot; were printed (with much reprint material) every year from 1977 until 1996, making them one of the most long-lived of IPC / Fleetway titles. Almost all of the other original strips were reprinted in other titles in the 1980s and 1990s.

After &quot;Monster Fun&quot;&#x27;s 1976 merger into &quot;Buster&quot;, the strips &quot;Gums&quot;, &quot;Kid Kong&quot;, &quot;X-Ray Specs&quot;, &quot;Mummy&#x27;s Boy&quot;, &quot;Draculass&quot;, &quot;Teddy Scare&quot;, &quot;Terror TV&quot;, and &quot;Martha&#x27;s Monster Make-Up&quot; all made the merger.

In February 1982 these merged magazines merged again with &quot;Jackpot&quot;. &quot;Kid Kong&quot; was terminated on this occasion.

In June 1984 the magazine merged with &quot;School Fun&quot;. The comic strip &quot;Gums&quot; was terminated on this occasion.

In 1988 the magazine merged with &quot;Nipper&quot;. &quot;Mummy&#x27;s Boy&quot; was terminated on this occasion. &quot;X-Ray Specs&quot; had the most longevity continuing until &quot;Buster&quot;&#x27;s end (4 January 2000) though as with the all but one of the last &quot;Buster&quot; strips as reprints.

===Rebellion revival===
In September 2021 it was announced that Rebellion, publishers of &quot;2000 AD&quot;, would be relaunching the comic in April 2022, &quot;revived and reimagined for today&#x27;s kids&quot;.

Unlike the original IPC run, the Rebellion revival will be published every two months, rather than weekly. Characters who will appear within the comics include Frankie Stein, Kid Kong, Draculass, Sweeny Toddler, Gums, Teddy Scare, and The Leopard from Lime Street. The first issue in October 2021 was not part of the main sequence, as the publication&#x27;s main subscription started from April 2022.

In March 2023, Rebellion announced that from June 2023, due to popular demand, the issues will be published monthly rather than every two months.

<text>General Sir Hector Munro, 8th Laird of Novar, KB ( – 27 December 1805) was a British Army officer and politician who sat in the British House of Commons representing the constituency of Inverness Burghs from 1768 to 1802.

==Early military career in Scotland==

He was the son of Hugh Munro, 7th laird of Novar, in Ross, Scotland. His family also had a home at Clayside in Golspie, Sutherland, which was then a collection of cottages and not the formed town that it later became. He served in the Golspie militia which fought on the Government side at the Battle of Littleferry on 15 April 1746 in Sutherland where the Jacobites were defeated. He entered the regular army at an early age, probably in the 64th (Loudon&#x27;s Highlanders) Regiment of Foot in 1747.

Hector is said to have got his first commission in the army after helping the Duchess of Gordon who was travelling alone in Sutherland. Hector took over from a drunken coachman and brought her to safety. The Duchess later used her influence to procure him a Lieutenant&#x27;s commission in the 34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot.

Hector&#x27;s family home was at Novar House. Early maps call it &#x27;Tenuer&#x27; (Scottish Gaelic: Tigh &#x27;n fhuamhair, house of the giant).

==Apprehension of Jacobite rebels==
In 1753, or 1754, Hector Munro was ordered to Badenoch with three squadrons of Dragoons to apprehend certain rebels in that district, with special instructions to apprehend John Du Cameron, better known as &quot;Sergent Mòr&quot;. Hector Munro captured Cameron after he was betrayed by a local farmer. John Cameron was soon afterwards executed in Perth.

Hector Munro was also tasked with capturing Ewen MacPherson of Cluny, who took part in the Jacobite rising of 1745. However, Macpherson evaded Munro&#x27;s grasp and escaped to France. Macpherson tradition is that one day Munro, with a large party of soldiers, surrounded Macpherson&#x27;s house. With no means of escape, Macpherson dressed himself as a footman or groom, came forward and held Lieutenant Munro&#x27;s horse while Munro searched his house for him. On return Munro is said to have handed the groom a shilling and then rode off. Another version of the story, however, is that Munro of Novar actually knew Macpherson quite well and winked at him as he threw him the grooms fee.

In 1759 he was appointed major in the newly raised 89th (Highland) Regiment of Foot.

==War in India==

In December 1760, The 89th regiment embarked at Portsmouth for the East Indies, and arrived at Bombay in November following. The Duke of Gordon was desirous of accompanying the regiment, but, at the request of his mother, George II of Great Britain induced him to remain at home to finish his education by telling him that, &quot;there being only nine dukes in the Kingdom of Scotland&quot;, he could not be spared.

The 89th had no particular station assigned to it, but kept moving from place to place until a strong detachment under Major Hector Munro joined the army under the command of Major John Carnac, in the neighbourhood of Patna. Major Munro then assumed the command, and being well supported by his men, quelled a formidable mutiny among the troops. After 20 Sepoys had been executed by Major Munro by blowing them off guns, and with discipline restored, he attacked the enemy at Buxar, on 23 October 1764 in what became the Battle of Buxar. Though the force opposed to him was five times as numerous as his own, he overthrew and dispersed it. According to historian John William Fortescue, the Mughal troops had 2000 men killed, and left 133 pieces of cannon on the field; whilst Munro&#x27;s troops had 289 killed, 499 wounded and 85 missing.

Major Munro received a letter of thanks on the occasion from the President and Council of Calcutta. &quot;The signal victory you gained&quot;, they say, &quot;so as at one blow utterly to defeat the designs of the enemy against these provinces, is an event which does so much honour to yourself, Sir, in particular, and to all the officers and men under your command, and which, at the same time, is attended with such particular advantages to the Company, as call upon us to return you our sincere thanks.&quot; For this important service Major Munro was immediately promoted to the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel.

== Member of Parliament ==

In 1768, Returning home, he was elected as Member of Parliament for the Inverness Burghs, which he continued to represent for over thirty years, though much of this period was spent in India. He was one of the shareholders of the failed Ayr Bank of Douglas, Heron and Company which collapsed in the financial crisis of 1772. The resultant financial embarrassment may be why in 1778 he returned to take command of the East India Company&#x27;s Madras Army.

== Return to India ==

Later in 1778 Munro took Pondichéry from the French, but in 1780 in the Second Anglo-Mysore War the defeat of a British force by Hyder Ali at the Battle of Perambakam near Conjeeveram forced him to fall back on St. Thomas Mount. There, Sir Eyre Coote took command of the army, and in 1781 won a major victory against Hyder Ali at Porto Novo (Parangipettai), where Munro was in command of the right division. Negapatam was taken by Munro in November of the same year; and in 1782 he retired to Scotland.

In 1782, the Fyrish Monument was ordered built by Munro in Fyrish, near Evanton, Easter Ross, Scotland. He did this to provide work for the local unemployed population.

In 1787, he was given the colonelcy of the 42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot, a position he held until his death in 1805.

==Family==

Sir Hector Munro, 8th laird of Novar having reached the full rank of General finally retired in 1798. He died unmarried on or about 27 December 1805 at Novar House. He had four natural children by different mothers:

#Hector Sutherland Munro, born 10 July 1775 (but baptised and indexed in error only as Hector Sutherland). He joined the East India Company&#x27;s military service as a cadet in 1792, but on his way to Madras was mauled by a tiger on Saugor Island, Bengal on 21 December 1792 and died the following day. The incident was widely publicised in the British press and the story has been retold many times. It has also been also commemorated in a series of Staffordshire figures of the &quot;Death of Munrow&quot;. Mackenzie erroneously identified the victim as his half-brother Hugh (below)
#Hugh Munro born 22 March 1777, who joined the East India Company as a Writer in 1796, and rose to be a Senior Merchant, Collector and Mintmaster of Bombay. His father, who held the post of Barrack Master of North Britain, appears to have appointed him Deputy. He died in 1814, aboard the &quot;Henry Addington&quot;, on the journey home from India via China. 
#Alexander Munro, baptised 26 July 1787, who also joined the East India Company as a cadet in 1803 and died, said to have been devoured by a shark, at Bombay on 12 November 1804.
#Jane Munro, who married Sir Ronald Crawford Ferguson of Raith, county of Fife. She died in 1803, shortly after the birth of her second child. Her son Robert Munro-Ferguson of Raith and grandson Ronald Munro-Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar later succeeded to the Novar estate, in accordance with the terms of the entail executed by Jane&#x27;s father Sir Hector Munro.

Sir Hector Munro, 8th laird of Novar was initially succeeded by his brother, Sir Alexander Munro, 9th of Novar who was Consul-General at Madrid and then Commissioner of Customs in England. Alexander first married his cousin Margaret Munro (d. 1768) but their only son Capt. Alexander Munro was killed in India in 1778. Alexander remarried Miss Johnstone, sister of General Johnstone of Auchen Castle, Dumfries with two sons and a daughter. He was succeeded by his third son Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro of Novar who himself left several illegitimate children including Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro. However, as already mentioned, on the death of Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro of Novar the estate of Novar passed to Colonel Robert Munro-Ferguson, son of Jane Munro, natural daughter of General Sir Hector Munro, 8th of Novar. The Munro-Fergusons of Novar, descendants of Robert Munro-Ferguson&#x27;s daughter Alice, are still in possession of the Novar Estate today.
