<text>Leo Kanner (; born Chaskel Leib Kanner; June 13, 1894 – April 3, 1981) was an Austrian-American psychiatrist, physician, and social activist best known for his work related to infantile autism. Before working at the Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Kanner practiced as a physician in Germany and South Dakota. In 1943, Kanner published his landmark paper &quot;Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact&quot;, describing 11 children who displayed &quot;a powerful desire for aloneness&quot; and &quot;an obsessive insistence on persistent sameness.&quot; He named their condition &quot;early infantile autism&quot;. Kanner was in charge of developing the first child psychiatry clinic in the United States and later served as the &quot;Chief of Child Psychiatry&quot; at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. He is one of the co-founders of The Children&#x27;s Guild, a nonprofit organization serving children, families and child-serving organizations throughout Maryland and Washington, D.C., and dedicated to &quot;Transforming how America Cares for and Educates its Children and Youth.&quot; He is widely considered one of the most influential American psychiatrists of the 20th century.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Leo Kanner was born as Chaskel Leib Kanner in Klekotów, Austria-Hungary (present day Klekotiv, Ukraine) on June 13, 1894, to Abraham Kanner and Clara Reisfeld Kanner. In this area, approximately 70% of the total population was of Jewish descent. Kanner despised his given names, &quot;Chaskel&quot;, which is the Yiddish version of &quot;Ezekiel&quot;, and &quot;Leib&quot;, instead choosing to go by &quot;Leo”. Growing up in a traditional Jewish household, Kanner received both a religious and a secular education. Kanner spent the first years of his life in Klekotów with his family and was brought up according to Jewish tradition and custom.

In 1906, Kanner was sent to Berlin to live with his uncle. Later, the rest of his family followed. At a young age, Kanner appreciated the arts and wanted to pursue a career as a poet; unfortunately, he was not able to get his works published. In 1913, Kanner graduated from the Sophien-Gymnasium, a public state high school in Berlin, where he excelled in the sciences. He then passed the graduating Staatsexamen exam in 1919 and enrolled at the University of Berlin medical school. However, Kanner&#x27;s medical education was interrupted during World War I, when he was recruited to serve in the Austro-Hungarian Army in the medical service of the 10th Infantry Regiment. After the war, Kanner went back to medical school in Berlin and officially received his medical degree in 1921. Later that year, Kanner married June Lewin, with whom he would eventually have two children: Anita (born in 1923) and Albert (born in 1931).

=== Early career ===
After graduating medical school, Kanner worked as a cardiologist at the Charité Hospital in Berlin. Kanner began doing work with normal heart sound to the relationship of the electrocardiogram. At that time, the atmosphere at the Charité clinics and institutes inspired rapid progress in science, teaching and patient care. The Charité, situated in the middle of Berlin, attracted students, physicians and scientists from all over the world, resulting in a group of outstanding personalities and renowned clinicians.

Motivated by the post-war hyperinflation and poor economic conditions of Weimar Germany, Kanner immigrated to the United States in 1924. If he had stayed in Germany his fate might have been similar to other Jewish professionals who lost their lives during the war. He stated: &quot;Little did I know, if I had remained in Germany I would have been perished by Hitler in the Holocaust&quot;.
When he emigrated to the United States in 1924, he worked at the state hospital in Yankton, South Dakota, where he started his pediatric and psychiatric studies. Upon arrival, Kanner was appointed assistant physician at the Yankton State Hospital. It was there Kanner would learn the subtleties of pediatrics and psychiatry, two fields in which he was not experienced. To enhance his command of the English language, Kanner did the crossword puzzles in &quot;The New York Times.&quot; During his time in South Dakota, Kanner published his first works, which were on general paralysis and syphilis. Kanner also studied the effects of adrenalin on the blood pressure of patients with functional paralysis. Additionally, he published his first book, &quot;Folklore of the Teeth&quot;, an analysis of dental practices around the world in relation to customs and folklore, in 1928.
=== Career at the &quot;Johns Hopkins University&quot; and &quot;Johns Hopkins Hospital&quot; ===
After serving four years in South Dakota, Kanner attained a fellowship position at the Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland in 1928, after attracting the attention of Adolf Meyer who was the Psychiatrist-in-Chief and Director of the psychiatric clinic. In 1930, with monetary support from the Macy and Rockefeller Foundations, Meyer and Edward A. Park were able to establish the Children&#x27;s Psychiatry Service at the &quot;Harriet Lane Home&quot; at Johns Hopkins, which was the first child psychiatry clinic in the United States, and appointed Kanner to develop the program. Despite his inexperience in the fields of pediatrics and child psychiatry, Kanner was able to teach himself pediatric psychiatry. In 1933, Meyer promoted Kanner to associate professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University. In 1935 the first edition of his textbook, &quot;Child Psychiatry&quot; was published. This was the first English language textbook on child psychiatry.

Beyond his revolutionary clinical research, Kanner&#x27;s concern for the mentally ill manifested as social activism for which he is also remembered today. In the 1930s, a group of lawyers and judges arranged for 166 state-institutionalized, mentally ill residents to be released and assigned as unpaid domestic servants for affluent families around Baltimore. The release of these patients was justified through the Habeas Corpus writs and the claim to familial rights. Out of his own concern, Kanner decided to track down the 166 patients and found them plagued with a variety of dreadful outcomes such as STDs, tuberculosis, prostitution, imprisonment, institutionalization, and even death. Kanner reported that the 166 released patients had a total of 165 children, many of whom became orphans or died due to neglect. Kanner&#x27;s report on these patients, &quot;Scheme to Get Morons to Work in Homes Free Charged&quot;, made the headlines of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1938. The publicity helped spark community action and led to the better treatment of the mentally ill. Apart from his social activism for the mentally ill, during the run-up to World War II, Kanner was instrumental in rescuing hundreds of Jewish physicians from the horrors of the Nazis by relocating them to work in the United States. He and his wife opened their home to many of these European refugees.

Beginning in 1938, Kanner observed eleven of his patients and chronicled the lives and behavioral characteristics of the children in his seminal paper, &quot;Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact&quot;, published in 1943. In this landmark publication, Kanner describes these children, all born in the 1930s, as living very disparate lives, but appearing to share something he labeled as &quot;infantile autism&quot;, which is now simply known as autism. Later on, Kanner served as the Chief of Child Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins until his retirement from the position in 1959 and attaining the position of Emeritus. He was replaced by Leon Eisenberg. After retirement, Kanner continued to publish papers regarding autism until 1973. Moreover, he served as a visiting professor at Stanford University, the University of Wisconsin, and the University of Minnesota, and ran an active consulting practice until a few years before his passing.

=== Studies of autism ===
Kanner expressed a great deal of concern about the usual mistreatment of neurodivergent children. He expressed concern about a society where &#x27;intellectual haves&#x27; look down on the &#x27;intellectual have-nots&#x27;, which led many to look down on the child with intellectual disability as an object of adult manipulations rather than as a human being who reacts to affection and hostility, to acceptance and rejection, to approval and disapproval, to patience and irritability as any other child would. This led to his major work in 1943, &quot;Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact&quot;, published in 1943. In this paper, Kanner characterizes eleven cases, 3 girls and 8 boys, and would later call his observations &#x27;autism&#x27;.

==== &quot;Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact&quot; (1943) ====
Published in the journal &quot;Nervous Child&quot;, &quot;Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact&quot; was one of the most cited papers on autism in the twentieth century. In his landmark paper, Kanner took the term &quot;autism&quot;, which Eugen Bleuler previously attributed to the inward, introspective symptoms typical in adult schizophrenia patients, and labeled the eleven children in his study as having &quot;infantile autism.&quot; However, rather than relating his observations to the qualities and symptoms seen in schizophrenic adults, Kanner classified his description of &quot;autism&quot; to be &quot;independent&quot; from the psychotic disorder of schizophrenia, explaining how autism was not a precursor to schizophrenia, and that the symptoms of autism appeared evident and present at birth and early life. A significant work, this paper on &quot;Kanner Syndrome&quot; formed the basis for later research conducted by Kanner and others on what later became known as childhood autism spectrum disorder.

From 1938, Kanner began to study a group of eleven young children (eight boys and three girls) who came to see him at his clinic at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. For each of the cases, Kanner provides a detailed account of the symptoms, health, results of diagnostic tests, familial background, and future development and progression of the children. Adding to his own observations, Kanner further contextualized the lives of his patients by including typically epistolary inputs from family members and other individuals with whom the children interacted. Generally, all of the children shared certain core symptoms and came from similar socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds (all but two of the families were of Anglo-Saxon descent). The following are summaries of each of the eleven cases: 
# Donald T.: Born on September 8, 1933, Donald Triplett was first seen in October, 1938 when he was five years old. At birth, Donald was healthy, with his only complication being eating, which according to an account from his father, &quot;has always been a problem with him. He has never shown a normal appetite.&quot; From an early age, Donald demonstrated &quot;an unusual memory for face and names&quot; and &quot;could hum and sing many tunes accurately&quot;, being able to memorize phrases that rhymed or were of a similar nature. Donald&#x27;s parents observed that &quot;he was happiest when left alone&quot;, neither paying much attention to anyone in the room nor reacting to the absence or homecoming of his mother or father. What amused him was spinning round objects, such as pans and spinning blocks, but he was afraid of &quot;self-propelling vehicles&quot;, like tricycles and swings. Donald had erupted into destructive, terrible temper tantrums when he was disrupted. At his first meeting with Kanner, Donald was observed shaking his head from side-to-side, repeating the same three-note tune, spinning anything he could get his hands on, and organizing objects by color, much to his own merriment. Most of his actions were repetitious, &quot;carried out in exactly the same way in which they had been performed originally.&quot; Often, he would utter random words of phrases, and this formed much of his verbal output and speech. Another problem Donald had with language was his understanding of the meaning of words. Words had a &quot;literal, inflexible meaning&quot; to Donald, and he was unable to recognize and apply the denotation of a word to another context; each word had a definite, designated definition and association in his mind. For the most part, conversations with Donald consisted of a barrage of questions. Finally, Kanner noted that the relationship Donald had with others was of a nature insofar as when he needed or wanted to know about something.
# Frederick W.: An only child of two university graduates, Frederick was born May 23, 1936, in breech position and was referred to see Kanner in 1942 at the age of six. Described as being &quot;self-sufficient&quot;, Frederick was capable of entertaining himself happily and was easily absorbed by objects, demonstrating &quot;good attention and perseverance&quot; in playing with toys. In turn, he paid little attention to other people, viewing them as &quot;unwelcome intruders&quot;, ignoring them as much as possible in order to maintain his attention to his playthings. Furthermore, Frederick feared mechanical objects, such as vacuum cleaners and egg beaters, even running away at the sight of or hearing the things. Similar to Donald, Frederick liked a regimented lifestyle in which everything had to have been placed and arranged in the same fashion and pattern. Frederick had limited verbal interactions, ejaculating unintelligible sounds and responding to commands in &quot;echolalia fashion&quot;, but he was able to sing twenty to thirty songs, including a French lullaby. Due to a lack of cooperation during the Grace Arthur performance scale diagnostic tests, Frederick&#x27;s results were difficult to evaluate. He performed the best on the Seguin form board, which consisted of inputting variously shaped objects back into their respective form holes on a board, with a best time of 58 seconds. In the mare and foal test, it appeared that he put the pieces in the appropriate places based on their configuration because it did not matter to him whether the pieces were right side up or not. During the form board tests, he was very concentrated and determined, working on them in an interested manner, but between tests, he wandered about the room examining various objects, paying no attention the people in the room.
# Richard M.: Originally, Richard was referred to Johns Hopkins Hospital at the age of three on suspicion that he was deaf because he did not talk and did not respond to questions. Born on November 17, 1937, Richard was relatively healthy and developed in an ordinary fashion, but his mother noted that in comparing Richard to her younger child, the elder child failed to show any &quot;physiognomic or postural sign of preparedness&quot; when being picked up. It was first observed at the clinic that Richard seemed quite intelligent, &quot;playing with the toys in his bed and being adequately curious about instruments used in the examination.&quot; Like the other patients, he was described as being self-sufficient. Richard was deeply focused in active play with toys and did not care for the people in the room. Occasionally, he looked at the walls, smiled, and uttered &quot;Ee! Ee! Ee!&quot; sounds. It was noted that Richard &quot;performed well with the unrotated form board, but not with the rotated form board.&quot; Both of the subsequent times he was seen by Kanner, Richard paid little attention to those in his presence, fell into fusses when something was disagreeable with him or when he wanted something, and consistently turned on and off the lights of the rooms once he entered it. Eventually, his mother sent him to a foster home to a woman who was known to have a &quot;remarkable talent for dealing with difficult children&quot;, and during his stay, she heard him say his first intelligible words, &quot;Good night.&quot;
# Paul G.: Viewed as feebleminded as a result of his &quot;incoherent speech, inability to conform, and reaction with temper outbursts to any interference&quot;, Paul was referred to see Kanner when he was five years old. Paul was noted to have good manual dexterity when performing tasks. Rarely, he responded when spoken to, even when directly addressed, though an energetic &quot;Don&#x27;t!&quot; caused him to interrupt what he was doing at the moment. There was a distinct difference in the way he interacted with people and objects; when entering a room, Paul directly went after the objects, using them correctly and treating them with special attention, whereas he disregarded people, behaving as if they were not there. In terms of speech, Paul typically uttered words or phrases that were directly related to what he was doing at the time, but he sometimes ejaculated random declarations unrelated to the immediate situation. Paul clearly enunciated, had a good vocabulary, and had a satisfactory understanding of sentence construction and syntax, with the significant exception of the fact that he did not use the first-person pronoun nor his own name when addressing himself. Whenever he made statements pertaining to himself, he referred to himself in the second person as literal reiterations of statements said to him in the past. Although no formal testing was carried out, Kanner concluded that Paul was clearly not feebleminded, given his intelligence.
# Barbara K.: Born normally on October 30, 1933, Barbara came to the clinic at eight years of age. Verbal expression was limited as she had difficulties with diction and syntax, but she had the phenomenal ability to spell, read, and write. Common with the other children, she was repetitious and obsessive over the order and placement of objects and phrasing. Barbara was very timid and afraid of things that would change, like the wind and large animals. Upon request, she would shake hands and greet others by limply offering her hand, demonstrating a lack of affective contact. During the battery of tests, she was not engrossed because it appeared that the &quot;concept of test, or sharing an experience or situation, seemed foreign to her.&quot; On the Binet test, she read excellently, finishing the ten-year Binet fire story in 33 seconds with no errors, but when asked to recall anything from the story she read, Barbara failed to reproduce any from her memory. After repeated questions or commands, she complied almost immediately. Barbara frequently referred to &quot;motor transports&quot; and &quot;piggy-back&quot;, and was fascinated with appendages, such as pendulums and smoke stacks. Barbara is also the only child whose mother Kanner did not denigrate.
# Virginia S.: From an account by another psychologist, Virginia was recorded as being distinct from the other children at the training school she attended because she was neat and tidy, did not interact and play with the other students, and was not deaf, but did not talk. Rather, she spent much of her time amusing herself in her own company by putting picture puzzles together. Notably, her older brother commented on the cold nature of their home life, describing that he and Virginia lived in &quot;a frosty atmosphere&quot; with two inapproachable strangers for parents as both of them did not contribute much to raising the children. When seen in October 1942, Virginia stood &quot;listlessly, looking into space&quot;, and sometimes answered questions by muttering &quot;Mamma, baby.&quot; Appearing to be self-absorbed, Virginia did not interact with the other children grouped around the piano, seemingly not noticing what was occurring. Kanner mentioned that she had &quot;an intelligent physiognomy&quot;, but her eyes lacked any expression.
# Herbert B.: Thought to have been intellectually disabled and deaf, on account of his failure to interact with others, Herbert was born on November 16, 1937. Herbert was terribly frightened by many mechanical objects and devices, such as running water and gas burners, and became upset when any alterations were made to his routine or accustomed patterns. On his first visit, he was observed to be highly intelligent with a good motor coordination. Completely absorbed in whatever he did, with great difficulty could Herbert be distracted from his self-chosen tasks at hand, and when interfered, he would get annoyed by shoving intruders away or screaming. In later visits, he continued to not communicate verbally and entered the room paying no attention to the people present. Never seen smiling, Herbert would occasionally produce unintelligible sounds in a &quot;monotonous singsong manner.&quot; Herbert also had an elder sister, Dorothy, whose behavior in early childhood indicates that she too was autistic.
# Alfred L.: Noted by his mother to develop a specialized interest that would consume his whole day and to prefer to be a &quot;lone wolf&quot;, Alfred was born in May 1932 and was brought to see Kanner at three and a half years old. Entering the office, he paid no attention to the examiner, instead immediately going towards the toys in the room and getting absorbed by play with the toy train. A Binet test was attempted on Alfred, and it was initially difficult, but he finally complied in a manner which Kanner assessed as being indicative of Alfred wanting to get through with the intrusion; he achieved an I.Q. of 140. Later on, he began to play with children younger than he was, but continued to be fully immersed in his play and was fearful of mechanical sounds. In terms of speech, he was very specific with his definition of terms and was often confused by the meaning of words.
# Charles N.: Charles was brought to the clinic on February 2, 1943, at four and a half years of age. When he entered the examination room, he did not pay any attention to the people in the room. On the Seguin form board, he was interested with the name of each of the pieces before putting them in the appropriate holes. In a repetitious pattern, he spun the forms and reacted excitedly when they were spinning. In terms of language, he did not use it to communicate with others, but had a good memory for the names of numerous objects.
# John F.: Born September 19, 1937, John had difficulty in feeding and appeared to be slow in development. At the office, he wandered about the room aimlessly, but did not bring two objects into relation with each other. When interacting with objects, he was destructive with them, throwing them onto the ground. Unlike most of the other children observed, John had a pretty good command of language, being able to form elaborate and grammatically sentences, with the exceptions of using the second pronoun when he referred to himself and being unable to make comparisons between two things. Markedly obsessive, he had a rigid daily routine and had an excellent rote memory, capable of reciting numerous songs, rhymes, and prayers. Furthermore, similar to the other children, words had stiff, designated meanings, as in the case when he asked his father about a group photograph on the wall of the office. Whenever he saw anything broken or incomplete, John would get extremely upset. In December 1942 and January 1943, John had two series of right-sided convulsions, with &quot;conjugate deviation of the eyes to the right and transient paresis of the right arm.&quot; The electroencephalogram indicated that there were focal disturbances in the left part of the occipital lobe, but there was difficulty reading the results because of John&#x27;s lack of cooperation.
# Elaine C.: Elaine was brought by her parents because of her &quot;unusual development&quot;: she had difficulty playing with other children, appearing to be in a world of her own. She was deeply engrossed by all types of animals and would often mimic them by making noises and walking on all fours. Elaine started to talk at around five years old, but she communicated through simple sentences that were &quot;mechanical phrases&quot; typically not related to what was going on at the time. Moreover, she had difficulty with using pronouns properly as well as negatives, but she was able to recognize the meaning of the latter when others used them. Like many of the other patients, she was afraid of moving objects and mechanical sounds, such as that of a vacuum cleaner. In response to questions, she would produce an &quot;echolalia type reproduction&quot; of what was asked.
After profiling each of the patients, in the &quot;Discussion&quot; and &quot;Comment&quot; portions of the paper, Kanner stated that the common characteristics observed in the children formed a &quot;unique syndrome&quot; that may have been more frequent than what was reported at the time given the small sample size in the study.

Kanner indicated that the fundamental issue of this disorder is the children&#x27;s inability to relate to people and objects in an ordinary way from birth. Distinguishing between the symptoms of the two disorders, Kanner explained that a person with schizophrenia steps outside his or her world and departs from already existing relationships, whereas the children he described had never established such relationships, experiencing an extreme aloneness from very early on. The notion of the innate nature of what Kanner called &quot;extreme aloneness&quot; was evident by recurrent reports of the failure of the children to &quot;assume at any time an anticipatory posture&quot; and adjust their bodies upon being picked up by their parents. The preferences the children had towards solitude manifested in complete disregard and ignorance of any external outputs that may interfere with them, such as direct physical contact, sound, or motion. Regarding the children&#x27;s lack of interest towards people, Kanner stated that &#x27;it would be best to get these interferences over with, the sooner to be able to return to the still much desired aloneness&quot;.

Kanner further noted the centrality of speech disturbances in this neurodivergence, observing that many of the children were delayed in their speech, and that those who did speak often used speech in peculiar ways (e.g., echolalic repetition of phrases and/or inflexible use of language as seen in the exact repetition of pronouns).

Additionally, Kanner observed that the children&#x27;s behavior was governed by an anxious and obsessive desire for sameness, and that this resulted in their repetitions of actions, such as their verbal utterances, as well as limited spontaneous activity. A related cognitive attribute noted by Kanner was that many of the children had an excellent rote memory, which led their parents to &quot;stuff&quot; them with verse, lists of animal and botanical names, favorite songs, and random facts. Kanner indicated that four of the children had been considered deaf or hard of hearing early on. He also reported early difficulties with eating and suggested that eating may have represented the first intrusion into the children&#x27;s extreme aloneness. He noted that the children had no particular health difficulties and that their EEG results were normal. He did, however, observe that 5 of the 11 children had relatively large heads, and a few were somewhat clumsy in their gait.

Recounting his observations of the children&#x27;s families, Kanner noted the high level of intelligence characterizing parents and relatives, while at the same time asserting that there were few warm-hearted parents among the families he observed. He stated his opinion that the marriages of the parents of the children he observed seemed to be &quot;rather cold affairs&quot;, but also stated his opinion that the children&#x27;s autism were &quot;inborn autistic disturbances of affective contact.&quot;

=== Other studies ===
Kanner&#x27;s first research publication, &quot;General Paralysis Among The North American Indians&quot;, explored the rarity of general paralytic dementia, a neuropsychiatric disorder that occurs in late-stage syphilis, in the Native Americans he treated at the Yankton State Hospital. In his premier paper, Kanner stated that in what he considered the more &quot;civilized&quot; countries of Europe, there was a higher susceptibility to paralytic dementia from syphilis compared to the &quot;less civilized&quot; Native Americans. Although syphilis was very common amongst the Native Americans, Kanner only came across one patient, Thomas T. Robertson, who was Native American and had symptoms of the late-stage syphilis dementia. Kanner concluded that Native Americans rarely got general paralytic dementia because syphilis had been in their population for so long that it lost the power to produce general paralysis. On the other hand, Kanner argued, syphilis was relatively new to the white populations of Europe so it was more likely to produce general paralysis. However, Kanner believed that with time, the white race could also gain a similar resistance to general paralysis like that of the Native Americans.

In 1949, Kanner published another notable study, &quot;Problems of Nosology and Psychodynamics of Early Infantile Autism*.&quot; Kanner explored the issues surrounding &quot;early infantile autism&quot; as it moved from having a well-defined symptomatology to being ready for a place in psychiatric nosology. Kanner focused on how early infantile autism was related and unrelated to the &quot;intrinsic nature&quot; of other conditions such as dementia infantilis and childhood schizophrenia. While early infantile autism and childhood schizophrenia have virtually identical symptoms, Kanner argued that they &quot;differ&quot; in onset. Prior to the onset of childhood schizophrenia, there is a period of normal mental state. However, early infantile autism manifests itself essentially right after birth. Kanner reported that the babies with early infantile autism were unusually apathetic, did not respond normally to people, did not assume proper posture to be picked up, startled at anything that disrupts their isolation, and lacked responsiveness. Kanner raised doubts about the necessity of separating infantile autism entirely from the schizophrenias because it can be considered as &quot;the earliest possible manifestation of childhood schizophrenia.&quot; Unlike his other studies, Kanner decided to focus closely on the adult parents of the children and found something an intriguing pattern. Most of the adult parents had extremely successful careers: scientists, college professors, artists, clergymen, and business executives. In fact, Kanner had trouble finding autistic children of unsophisticated parents. This sparked Kanner&#x27;s curiosity about the attitudes of the parents and the relationship dynamic between the parents and the children. He found that most of the parents had unaffectionate, mechanical relationships with their autistic children and would oftentimes dismiss them entirely. Kanner concluded that this unaffectionate dynamic potentially causes the autistic children to turn away and &quot;seek comfort in solitude.&quot; He even argued that the children&#x27;s obsessive preoccupations and remarkable memory feats represent &quot;a plea for parental approval.&quot;

== Death and legacy ==
On April 3, 1981, Kanner died of heart failure in Sykesville, Maryland. In his lifetime, Kanner founded the field of child psychiatry and his research contributions laid the foundation for the fields of psychology, pediatrics, autism, and adolescent psychiatry. He is now known as the &quot;Father of Child Psychiatry&quot;. Kanner was the first physician in the United States to be identified as a child psychiatrist. His textbook, &quot;Child Psychiatry&quot; (1935) was the first English language textbook to focus on the psychiatric problems on children. In 1943, Kanner first described the syndrome of early infantile autism. His concise and cogent clinical descriptions of children with autism continues to inform, and is the standard against which current diagnostic criteria are measured. In his lifetime, Kanner published over 250 articles and eight books spanning the fields of psychiatry, pediatrics, psychology and history of medicine.

Since Kanner&#x27;s demarcation of childhood autism, research on autism continues to be an area of increasing interest. Although much progress has been made, this field is still in its infancy, and many avenues of research are just beginning to be pursued. Despite the time that has passed, the syndrome Kanner identified and his comments about the children he observed continue to have meaning today, and although some of his suggestions about the etiology and presentation of autism were grounded in the thinking of his day, many of his observations were quite prescient.

Currently, studies of autism focus on the genetic mechanisms that underlie the syndrome. There has been vast research into DNA mutations, epigenetic modifications, and rearrangements that may contribute to the onset of autism. In addition, environmental research, quantitative functional anatomy, and quantitative estimates of gene expression may help us understand &quot;the entire cast of characters&quot; involved in autism. These promising avenues of research heavily stem from Leo Kanner&#x27;s life research.

In honor of Kanner&#x27;s work, all Johns Hopkins Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Fellows are now called Kanner Fellows. The Dr. Leo Kanner Award was created by the Mind Research Foundation for those who actively serve children with autism and their families. Now there are numerous buildings, schools, and institutes that honor Leo Kanner both in the United States and abroad.

<text>Owen Moore (12 December 1886 – 9 June 1939) was an Irish-born American actor, appearing in more than 279 movies spanning from 1908 to 1937.

==Early life and career==
Moore was born in Fordstown Crossroads, County Meath, Ireland. Along with his parents, John and Rose Anna Moore, brothers Tom, Matt, and Joe, and sister Mary, he emigrated to the United States as a steerage passenger on board the S.S. &quot;Anchoria.&quot; The Moore family were inspected on Ellis Island in May 1896 and settled in the Toledo, Ohio area. Moore and his siblings went on to successful careers in motion pictures in Hollywood, California.

While working at D. W. Griffith&#x27;s Biograph Studios, Moore met a young Canadian actress named Gladys Smith, whom he married on January 7, 1911. Their marriage was kept secret at first because of the strong opposition of her mother. However, Smith soon overshadowed her husband under her stage name, Mary Pickford. In 1912, he signed on with Victor Studios, co-starring in a number of their films with studio owner/actress Florence Lawrence.

Pickford left Biograph Studios to join the Independent Moving Pictures (IMP) to replace their star, Florence Lawrence. Carl Laemmle, the owner of IMP (IMP later merged into Universal Studios), agreed to sign Moore as part of the deal. This humiliation, together with his wife&#x27;s meteoric rise to fame, drastically affected Moore, and alcohol became a problem that led to violent behavior and his physically abusing Pickford. In 1916, Pickford met actor Douglas Fairbanks. In 1920, Pickford filed for divorce from Moore when she agreed to his demand of $100,000 settlement. Pickford and Fairbanks married days later.
Moore appeared in many successful films for Lewis J. Selznick (father of producer David O. Selznick and agent Myron Selznick), in the late teens and early 1920s. He was a popular star at Selznick Pictures along with Olive Thomas, Elaine Hammerstein, Eugene O&#x27;Brien and Conway Tearle. He also appeared in films for his own production company as well as Goldwyn and Triangle.

Moore married a second time to silent film actress, Katherine Perry, in 1921. With the advent of sound film, Moore&#x27;s career declined, and he became a supporting actor for newer stars. He competed, as the third lead, with Cary Grant and Noah Beery, Sr. for the attentions of Mae West in &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot;, Paramount&#x27;s most lucrative film of 1933. His last film appearance was as a movie director in the 1937 drama &quot;A Star Is Born,&quot; starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March – ironically a movie about a former film star who turned to alcohol, much like himself at that time.

==Death==
After years of fighting alcoholism, Moore was found dead on June 9, 1939, in his apartment in Beverly Hills, California. An Associated Press news report said that he &quot;apparently had been dead two days&quot;. An autopsy was scheduled for the next day.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Moore has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6727 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>Matt Moore (January 8, 1888 – January 20, 1960) was an Irish-born American actor and director. He appeared in at least 221 motion pictures from 1912 to 1958. 

==Biography==
Born in Fordstown Crossroads, County Meath, Ireland, he and his brothers, Tom, Owen, and Joe, and a sister Mary Moore emigrated to the United States as steerage passengers on board the S.S. &quot;Anchoria&quot; and were inspected on Ellis Island in May 1896. They all went on to successful movie careers.

Once his brothers made a name for themselves, Moore made his debut in the role as the minister in the silent short &quot;Tangled Relations&quot; (1912) starring Florence Lawrence and Owen Moore. In 1913, Matt Moore had a prominent role in the &quot;white slavery&quot; drama, &quot;Traffic in Souls&quot;.

Moore played the role as Hector MacDonald in the MGM crime/drama &quot;The Unholy Three&quot; (1925) co-starring Lon Chaney and Mae Busch, which was a huge hit that year. He played the role as Stanley &quot;Stan&quot; Wentworth in &quot;Coquette&quot; (1929) opposite Mary Pickford and Johnny Mack Brown. &quot;Coquette&quot; was the first talkie of Pickford, ex-wife of his brother Owen.

As time passed, Moore took smaller character roles and remained active in the motion picture industry. His final appearance was in the uncredited role as Charlie Bates in the horror/thriller &quot;I Bury the Living&quot; (1958), which starred Richard Boone and Theodore Bikel.

Moore has a star for his work in motions pictures on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6301 Hollywood Boulevard. He was very fond of his two cats, having them appear in several of his movies, and both have a star in the animal section of the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

== Death ==
Moore died of undisclosed causes on January 20, 1960, in Hollywood, California, aged 72.

<text>The Metropolitan Borough of St Helens is a local government district with borough status in Merseyside, North West England. The borough is named after its largest settlement, St Helens. It is one of the six boroughs of the Liverpool City Region.

Other towns and villages in St Helens include Earlestown, Rainhill, Eccleston, Clock Face, Haydock, Billinge, Garswood, Rainford and Newton-le-Willows.

==History==
The Metropolitan Borough was formed on 1 April 1974 as a merger of the former County Borough of St Helens, along with the urban districts of Haydock, Newton-le-Willows and Rainford, and parts of Billinge-and-Winstanley and Ashton-in-Makerfield urban districts, along with part of Whiston Rural District, all from the administrative county of Lancashire.

Between 1974 and 1986 (when it was abolished), the borough council shared functions with Merseyside County Council. After abolition, the functions of this body were in part devolved to the boroughs and in part transferred to ad hoc agencies.

==Governance==

===St Helens Metropolitan Borough Council composition===

The Metropolitan Borough Council is made up of 48 councillors, three representing each of the 16 wards. Elections to St Helens Metropolitan Borough Council are held in three out of every four years, with one-third of the 48 seats on the council being elected at each election.

The Labour Party has had a majority on the council since the first election in 1973, except for a period between the 2004 election and the 2010 election when no party had a majority. This allowed an alliance between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives to take control after the 2006 election until Labour regained control in 2010.

Since then Labour has strengthened its position on the council, and following the 2022 election the council is composed of the following councillors:

===Parliamentary constituencies===
The members of parliament who represent St Helens are: 
*St Helens North - David Baines MP
*St Helens South and Whiston

===Liverpool City Region Combined Authority===
The Metropolitan Borough of St Helens is one of the six constituent local government districts of the Liverpool City Region. Since 1 April 2014, some of the borough&#x27;s responsibilities have been pooled with neighbouring authorities and subsumed into the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.

The combined authority has effectively become the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region, and the leader of St Helens Metropolitan Borough Council, along with the five other leaders from neighbouring local government districts, takes strategic decisions over economic development, transport, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure.

=== Mayor of the Liverpool City Region ===
As a district of the Liverpool City Region it is also governed by the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region who serves as the mayor of the region.

the incumbent mayor is Steve Rotheram of the labour party

==Geography==

The borough borders the borough of Knowsley, in the south-west, the district of West Lancashire in the north, the Borough of Wigan in the north-east, and to the south the boroughs of Warrington and Halton.

The St Helens Borough covers roughly 30 km2 over an area of soft rolling hills used primarily for agricultural purposes, mainly arable. The highest point in the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens, and the whole of Merseyside, is Billinge Hill, 4.5 miles (7.2 km) north from St. Helens centre. The borough is landlocked with a stream running through, Mill Brook/Windle Brook running through Eccleston and connecting with the (disused) St. Helens Branch/Section of the Sankey Canal in the town centre. 
The centre of St Helens is around 160 feet (50 m) above sea level.

From the top of Billinge Hill the cities of Manchester and Liverpool are visible on a clear day as well as the towns of Bolton and Warrington.

Carr Mill Dam is Merseyside&#x27;s largest body of inland water, offering picturesque lakeside trails and walks as well as national competitive powerboating and angling events.

The Burgies are two tailings on the site of the old Rushy Park coal mine. They were created by the dumping of toxic chemical waste from the manufacture of glass, they have since been covered with tall grass and woodland.

==Demography==

===Ethnicity===
==Education==

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of St Helens Metropolitan Borough Council was adopted in 1974. The crest above the helmet is that of Lord Newton representing Newton U.D.C. and Haydock U.D.C. The crest is suitably differenced by the inclusion of two red (gules) fleur-de-lys on the body of the ram.

The escutcheon is split into quarters by the Black (sable) Cross of Haydock &amp; Eccleston and the Blue (azure) Bars of Parr.
Each quarter contains a different charge:
*First Quarter: a saltire couped Gules - representing Ashton and Seneley Green,
*Second Quarter: a griffin Sable - representing Rainhill,
*Third Quarter: a cross flory - representing Windle,
*Fourth Quarter: a cross crosslet fitchy - representing Billinge.

Beneath the escutcheon is a scroll bearing the motto &#x27; &quot;Ex Terra Lucem&quot; &#x27; meaning &#x27;From the Earth, Light&#x27;.

<doc id="637096" wikidata="Q5086011" url="?curid=637096" title="Charlotte Hornets (WFL)">
<text>The Charlotte Hornets were an American football team in the short-lived professional World Football League. Despite their brief existence, the Hornets were North Carolina&#x27;s first attempt at a major league football team, predating the Carolina Panthers by two decades. They were relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina, from New York City in the middle of the 1974 season.

==History==
===Origins in Boston===
The Charlotte Hornets franchise began in 1973 in Boston as the Boston Bulldogs, which was also the name of the relocated Pottsville Maroons, Boston&#x27;s first professional football franchise. The name was shortened in October to Bulls. They were owned by Howard Baldwin, president and minority owner of the New England Whalers of the World Hockey Association. Unlike most other WFL owners, he didn&#x27;t have to pay a franchise fee because of his close ties to WFL founder and Commissioner Gary Davidson. He hired Vito &quot;Babe&quot; Parilli, who had been a backup to New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath in Super Bowl III, as head coach.

Baldwin was unable to find more investors, or even a suitable place to play. Realizing that he had no hope of putting together a viable product in Boston, Baldwin opted to merge with the WFL&#x27;s as-yet-unnamed New York franchise on January 26, 1974. That team was owned by Whalers and Boston Celtics majority owner Bob Schmertz and three of his New York-based limited business partners; Henry Fujawski, John Lander and Steven Cohen who together made up the core of the Stars ownership and like Baldwin hadn&#x27;t had to pay a franchise fee. The two teams had already worked together very closely in the draft. The merged team took the name New York Stars.

===New York Stars===
Finding a home field for the fledgling team in New York also proved difficult, partly due to bad timing. Yankee Stadium was closed for renovations right after the Yankees finished the 1973 season in October; it would not reopen until 1976. Shea Stadium was fully booked as the Yankees shared the park with the Mets as well as the NFL&#x27;s Jets and Giants. (Giants Stadium, future home of both New York football teams, wouldn&#x27;t open its doors until 1976.) The Stars had only two other options in the city proper: Downing Stadium, a 22,000-seat facility built during the Depression as a WPA Project on Randall&#x27;s Island near the East River, or Baker Field, the 32,000-seat wooden stadium that served as the home of Columbia University&#x27;s teams. Unable to come to terms with Columbia, Downing Stadium was ultimately chosen. The legendary Bob Sheppard, longtime voice of the New York Yankees, handled public address duties for the Stars.

Parilli signed a number of former Super Bowl III Jets including wide receiver George Sauer, who was coming out of retirement after three years, and former All-Pro defensive men Gerry Philbin, as well as John Elliott.

The WFL needed New York in order to have a presence in the largest U.S. media market. The Stars sold between 5,500 and 8,000 season tickets. After losing 14–7 at Jacksonville in front of a league high crowd of 59,112 at the Gator Bowl, the Stars&#x27; first home game against the Birmingham Americans attracted 17,943 New Yorkers. After leading 29–3 at halftime, the Stars were toppled by the efforts of Americans quarterback George Mira, who threw for three touchdowns and ran for another as Birmingham pulled out a 32-29 comeback win. The Stars achieved their first win as kicker Moses Lajterman kicked the winning field goal for a 17–15 win at Philadelphia. The Stars and Bell performed in front of the largest-ever WFL crowd, with 64,179 on hand; it later came out that most of the tickets were sold at large discounts or were given away free, to make the league appear more successful than it was.

New York then went on a tear, winning five in a row. Among the victims were the Jacksonville Sharks, Southern California Sun, Portland Storm, and Houston Texans. Coincidentally, the team&#x27;s winning streak was stopped by those same Texans a week later, with a surprise addition to the Houston roster: John Matuszak, who had been AWOL from the NFL&#x27;s Houston Oilers just 48 hours earlier. The Stars had mixed results in the next few weeks, beating Portland again, but losing to Florida in the rain and The Hawaiians in the sun. To improve the roster, New York picked up several NFL players from the waiver wire, including cornerback John Dockery (who played with Parilli for the Jets) and Don Highsmith, a running back released by Oakland who turned out to be a great addition to the Stars running attack. 

The Stars could have been a real alternative to the NFL&#x27;s Giants and Jets, both of whom were at historic low-points on the field. But despite their on-field success (and cheaper ticket prices), the Stars were dragged down by serious off-field financial problems; like most WFL teams, they were badly under-capitalized. The Stars opening-night crowd was the largest of the season; by September, they were drawing barely 5,000 per contest (ultimately, they drew just 74,692 total to their seven home games, an average of 10,670 per game, second-worst in the WFL.) Their fiscal structure began to founder when Schmertz&#x27;s construction company ran into trouble. He was also involved in a nasty divorce, as well as a legal dispute over his ownership of the Celtics.

The Stars&#x27; biggest problem was Downing Stadium. Located on an island in the East River and accessible primarily on foot, it was nearly inaccessible from most parts of the city, and it had not been well-maintained in at least twenty years. (Indeed, it had hosted little football in that time, most notably a partial season of the old Continental Football League in 1966.) Schmertz pumped over $200,000 into renovations, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to bring it to anything even approaching professional standards. The field was mostly sand and dirt, and amenities for fans, players and the press were virtually nonexistent. The toilets in the locker room frequently overflowed. During the home opener, the Stars&#x27; radio announcers John Sterling and Matt Snell had to sit on orange crates because there were no chairs in the press box; their Birmingham counterparts had to stand. Lighting was provided by four-decade-old light towers from Ebbets Field that were not nearly strong enough to completely illuminate the field. The lights were so dim that WFL&#x27;s national television broadcaster, TVS, pronounced them unfit for broadcast and refused to air any games from the stadium.

It soon became obvious that Schmertz and Baldwin were in no position to finish the season. With the Stars over a million dollars in debt and a stadium that was inadequate even for temporary use, the WFL resigned itself to abandoning the nation&#x27;s biggest market.

September 24, 1974 was their final game at New York, against the Detroit Wheels (the game was moved from Wednesday because of Yom Kippur). Coincidentally, that same day, the Wheels&#x27; 33 owners filed for bankruptcy, leading reporters to call the game the &quot;Bankrupt Bowl.&quot; The Stars blew out the destitute Wheels, 37–7, in front of 4,220 fans. The game was originally scheduled to be carried nationally by TVS, but the network begged off. Even without Downing&#x27;s inadequate lighting, it was clear by this time that both teams were headed for extinction.

===Charlotte Stars/Hornets===
While they were packing up for the next night&#x27;s game against the Chicago Fire, Parilli announced the team was moving to Charlotte for the rest of the season as the Charlotte Stars. Part-owner Bob Keating told reporters that poor attendance and Downing Stadium&#x27;s substandard playing conditions made it impossible for the team to go on in New York.

The league had found a buyer in Upton Bell, the son and heir of former NFL commissioner Bert Bell and himself a former executive with the New England Patriots, after Charlotte mayor John M. Belk helped engineer a deal that made the move feasible. Forced to find a new logo literally at the last minute, the equipment man simply stuck the Chicago Bears&#x27; &quot;C&quot; logo over the old New York logo. Despite everything, the Stars—renamed the Hornets a few days later—put out the Fire, 41–30. Shortly after they arrived in Charlotte, however, their uniforms were impounded due to an unpaid laundry bill from New York; the Hornets had to practice in shorts and T-shirts until Bell posted a bond for the equipment. The team&#x27;s first home game at Charlotte (the city&#x27;s first-ever &quot;big league&quot; franchise) was a rousing success, selling out all 25,133 tickets at American Legion Memorial Stadium, leaving some 5,000 out of luck. The visiting Memphis Southmen ruined their debut, winning 27–23. In four games at Charlotte, the Hornets sold over 80,000 tickets compared to just 75,000 in seven games at Downing Stadium.

Toward the end of the season, the Hornets struggled on the field, losing their last four games. Off the field, things were not much better, as Bell was still scrambling to get more financing; a public offering hadn&#x27;t attracted any investors. After their penultimate game, a federal judge ordered the seizure of most of the team&#x27;s equipment (again) to compensate creditors back in New York.

Despite their late-season slump, the Hornets finished second in the Eastern Division behind the Florida Blazers, earning them a playoff spot and a date against the Blazers in Orlando. Unfortunately, by November 16, six days before the game, Florida had only sold 1,000 advance tickets (the final attendance was reported as 9,712), leading to concerns that the Hornets&#x27; cut of the gate would not even begin to meet their travel expenses. The players would have been lucky to get $100 for the game, nowhere near enough to justify the trip. League executive committee chairman and Memphis Southmen owner John F. Bassett called Bell and told him that the game was off. Bell had little choice but to agree. The players hadn&#x27;t been paid since the third week of October, and he still hadn&#x27;t been able to attract enough financing to field a team for 1975. Additionally, he was still paying Schmertz for buying the team. The Philadelphia Bell, who finished one game behind the Hornets (and with a losing record) but had somewhat more robust finances, replaced the Hornets as the second Eastern qualifier.

The Hornets returned for the 1975 campaign. Meanwhile, the reconstituted Chicago Winds franchise looked to sign quarterback Joe Namath, offering him a multi-million dollar contract to jump leagues. (Part of the deal called for Namath&#x27;s eventual ownership of a WFL franchise in New York, which apparently would have involved moving the Hornets back to the Big Apple, perhaps playing in the refurbished Yankee Stadium.) But when Namath said no, league television partner TVS tore up its contract. The Hornets, like the rest of the league, felt the loss of TV coverage and revenue very hard. Despite fielding a competitive team (winning four in a row at one point), the Hornets didn&#x27;t come close to selling out any of their contests in &#x27;75, drawing 43,761 fans for their four home games, less than half of capacity. Finally, the WFL ceased operations in mid-season, and the Hornets finished with a 6–5 record.

<text>Plant physiology is a subdiscipline of botany concerned with the functioning, or physiology, of plants.

Plant physiologists study fundamental processes of plants, such as photosynthesis, respiration, plant nutrition, plant hormone functions, tropisms, nastic movements, photoperiodism, photomorphogenesis, circadian rhythms, environmental stress physiology, seed germination, dormancy and stomata function and transpiration. Plant physiology interacts with the fields of plant morphology (structure of plants), plant ecology (interactions with the environment), phytochemistry (biochemistry of plants), cell biology, genetics, biophysics and molecular biology.

==Aims==

The field of plant physiology includes the study of all the internal activities of plants—those chemical and physical processes associated with life as they occur in plants. This includes study at many levels of scale of size and time. At the smallest scale are molecular interactions of photosynthesis and internal diffusion of water, minerals, and nutrients. At the largest scale are the processes of plant development, seasonality, dormancy, and reproductive control. Major subdisciplines of plant physiology include phytochemistry (the study of the biochemistry of plants) and phytopathology (the study of disease in plants). The scope of plant physiology as a discipline may be divided into several major areas of research.
First, the study of phytochemistry (plant chemistry) is included within the domain of plant physiology. To function and survive, plants produce a wide array of chemical compounds not found in other organisms. Photosynthesis requires a large array of pigments, enzymes, and other compounds to function. Because they cannot move, plants must also defend themselves chemically from herbivores, pathogens and competition from other plants. They do this by producing toxins and foul-tasting or smelling chemicals. Other compounds defend plants against disease, permit survival during drought, and prepare plants for dormancy, while other compounds are used to attract pollinators or herbivores to spread ripe seeds.

Secondly, plant physiology includes the study of biological and chemical processes of individual plant cells. Plant cells have a number of features that distinguish them from cells of animals, and which lead to major differences in the way that plant life behaves and responds differently from animal life. For example, plant cells have a cell wall which maintains the shape of plant cells. Plant cells also contain chlorophyll, a chemical compound that interacts with light in a way that enables plants to manufacture their own nutrients rather than consuming other living things as animals do.

Thirdly, plant physiology deals with interactions between cells, tissues, and organs within a plant. Different cells and tissues are physically and chemically specialized to perform different functions. Roots and rhizoids function to anchor the plant and acquire minerals in the soil. Leaves catch light in order to manufacture nutrients. For both of these organs to remain living, minerals that the roots acquire must be transported to the leaves, and the nutrients manufactured in the leaves must be transported to the roots. Plants have developed a number of ways to achieve this transport, such as vascular tissue, and the functioning of the various modes of transport is studied by plant physiologists.

Fourthly, plant physiologists study the ways that plants control or regulate internal functions. Like animals, plants produce chemicals called hormones which are produced in one part of the plant to signal cells in another part of the plant to respond. Many flowering plants bloom at the appropriate time because of light-sensitive compounds that respond to the length of the night, a phenomenon known as photoperiodism. The ripening of fruit and loss of leaves in the winter are controlled in part by the production of the gas ethylene by the plant.

Finally, plant physiology includes the study of plant response to environmental conditions and their variation, a field known as environmental physiology. Stress from water loss, changes in air chemistry, or crowding by other plants can lead to changes in the way a plant functions. These changes may be affected by genetic, chemical, and physical factors.

==Biochemistry of plants==

The chemical elements of which plants are constructed—principally carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, etc.—are the same as for all other life forms: animals, fungi, bacteria and even viruses. Only the details of their individual molecular structures vary.

Despite this underlying similarity, plants produce a vast array of chemical compounds with unique properties which they use to cope with their environment. Pigments are used by plants to absorb or detect light, and are extracted by humans for use in dyes. Other plant products may be used for the manufacture of commercially important rubber or biofuel. Perhaps the most celebrated compounds from plants are those with pharmacological activity, such as salicylic acid from which aspirin is made, morphine, and digoxin. Drug companies spend billions of dollars each year researching plant compounds for potential medicinal benefits.

===Constituent elements===
Plants require some nutrients, such as carbon and nitrogen, in large quantities to survive. Some nutrients are termed macronutrients, where the prefix &quot;macro-&quot; (large) refers to the quantity needed, not the size of the nutrient particles themselves. Other nutrients, called micronutrients, are required only in trace amounts for plants to remain healthy. Such micronutrients are usually absorbed as ions dissolved in water taken from the soil, though carnivorous plants acquire some of their micronutrients from captured prey.

The following tables list element nutrients essential to plants. Uses within plants are generalized.

=== Pigments ===


Among the most important molecules for plant function are the pigments. Plant pigments include a variety of different kinds of molecules, including porphyrins, carotenoids, and anthocyanins. All biological pigments selectively absorb certain wavelengths of light while reflecting others. The light that is absorbed may be used by the plant to power chemical reactions, while the reflected wavelengths of light determine the color the pigment appears to the eye.

Chlorophyll is the primary pigment in plants; it is a porphyrin that absorbs red and blue wavelengths of light while reflecting green. It is the presence and relative abundance of chlorophyll that gives plants their green color. All land plants and green algae possess two forms of this pigment: chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; and chlorophyll &quot;b&quot;. Kelps, diatoms, and other photosynthetic heterokonts contain chlorophyll &quot;c&quot; instead of &quot;b&quot;, red algae possess chlorophyll &quot;a&quot;. All chlorophylls serve as the primary means plants use to intercept light to fuel photosynthesis.

Carotenoids are red, orange, or yellow tetraterpenoids. They function as accessory pigments in plants, helping to fuel photosynthesis by gathering wavelengths of light not readily absorbed by chlorophyll. The most familiar carotenoids are carotene (an orange pigment found in carrots), lutein (a yellow pigment found in fruits and vegetables), and lycopene (the red pigment responsible for the color of tomatoes). Carotenoids have been shown to act as antioxidants and to promote healthy eyesight in humans.

Anthocyanins (literally &quot;flower blue&quot;) are water-soluble flavonoid pigments that appear red to blue, according to pH. They occur in all tissues of higher plants, providing color in leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and fruits, though not always in sufficient quantities to be noticeable. Anthocyanins are most visible in the petals of flowers, where they may make up as much as 30% of the dry weight of the tissue. They are also responsible for the purple color seen on the underside of tropical shade plants such as &quot;Tradescantia zebrina&quot;. In these plants, the anthocyanin catches light that has passed through the leaf and reflects it back towards regions bearing chlorophyll, in order to maximize the use of available light

Betalains are red or yellow pigments. Like anthocyanins they are water-soluble, but unlike anthocyanins they are indole-derived compounds synthesized from tyrosine. This class of pigments is found only in the Caryophyllales (including cactus and amaranth), and never co-occur in plants with anthocyanins. Betalains are responsible for the deep red color of beets, and are used commercially as food-coloring agents. Plant physiologists are uncertain of the function that betalains have in plants which possess them, but there is some preliminary evidence that they may have fungicidal properties.

==Signals and regulators==

Plants produce hormones and other growth regulators which act to signal a physiological response in their tissues. They also produce compounds such as phytochrome that are sensitive to light and which serve to trigger growth or development in response to environmental signals.

===Plant hormones===
Plant hormones, known as plant growth regulators (PGRs) or phytohormones, are chemicals that regulate a plant&#x27;s growth. According to a standard animal definition, hormones are signal molecules produced at specific locations, that occur in very low concentrations, and cause altered processes in target cells at other locations. Unlike animals, plants lack specific hormone-producing tissues or organs. Plant hormones are often not transported to other parts of the plant and production is not limited to specific locations.

Plant hormones are chemicals that in small amounts promote and influence the growth, development and differentiation of cells and tissues. Hormones are vital to plant growth; affecting processes in plants from flowering to seed development, dormancy, and germination. They regulate which tissues grow upwards and which grow downwards, leaf formation and stem growth, fruit development and ripening, as well as leaf abscission and even plant death.

The most important plant hormones are abscissic acid (ABA), auxins, ethylene, gibberellins, and cytokinins, though there are many other substances that serve to regulate plant physiology.

===Photomorphogenesis===
While most people know that light is important for photosynthesis in plants, few realize that plant sensitivity to light plays a role in the control of plant structural development (morphogenesis). The use of light to control structural development is called photomorphogenesis, and is dependent upon the presence of specialized photoreceptors, which are chemical pigments capable of absorbing specific wavelengths of light.

Plants use four kinds of photoreceptors: phytochrome, cryptochrome, a UV-B photoreceptor, and protochlorophyllide &quot;a&quot;. The first two of these, phytochrome and cryptochrome, are photoreceptor proteins, complex molecular structures formed by joining a protein with a light-sensitive pigment. Cryptochrome is also known as the UV-A photoreceptor, because it absorbs ultraviolet light in the long wave &quot;A&quot; region. The UV-B receptor is one or more compounds not yet identified with certainty, though some evidence suggests carotene or riboflavin as candidates. Protochlorophyllide &quot;a&quot;, as its name suggests, is a chemical precursor of chlorophyll.

The most studied of the photoreceptors in plants is phytochrome. It is sensitive to light in the red and far-red region of the visible spectrum. Many flowering plants use it to regulate the time of flowering based on the length of day and night (photoperiodism) and to set circadian rhythms. It also regulates other responses including the germination of seeds, elongation of seedlings, the size, shape and number of leaves, the synthesis of chlorophyll, and the straightening of the epicotyl or hypocotyl hook of dicot seedlings.

===Photoperiodism===

Many flowering plants use the pigment phytochrome to sense seasonal changes in day length, which they take as signals to flower. This sensitivity to day length is termed photoperiodism. Broadly speaking, flowering plants can be classified as long day plants, short day plants, or day neutral plants, depending on their particular response to changes in day length. Long day plants require a certain minimum length of daylight to start flowering, so these plants flower in the spring or summer. Conversely, short day plants flower when the length of daylight falls below a certain critical level. Day neutral plants do not initiate flowering based on photoperiodism, though some may use temperature sensitivity (vernalization) instead.

Although a short day plant cannot flower during the long days of summer, it is not actually the period of light exposure that limits flowering. Rather, a short day plant requires a minimal length of uninterrupted darkness in each 24-hour period (a short daylength) before floral development can begin. It has been determined experimentally that a short day plant (long night) does not flower if a flash of phytochrome activating light is used on the plant during the night.

Plants make use of the phytochrome system to sense day length or photoperiod. This fact is utilized by florists and greenhouse gardeners to control and even induce flowering out of season, such as the poinsettia (&quot;Euphorbia pulcherrima&quot;).

==Environmental physiology==

Paradoxically, the subdiscipline of environmental physiology is on the one hand a recent field of study in plant ecology and on the other hand one of the oldest. Environmental physiology is the preferred name of the subdiscipline among plant physiologists, but it goes by a number of other names in the applied sciences. It is roughly synonymous with ecophysiology, crop ecology, horticulture and agronomy. The particular name applied to the subdiscipline is specific to the viewpoint and goals of research. Whatever name is applied, it deals with the ways in which plants respond to their environment and so overlaps with the field of ecology.

Environmental physiologists examine plant response to physical factors such as radiation (including light and ultraviolet radiation), temperature, fire, and wind. Of particular importance are water relations (which can be measured with the Pressure bomb) and the stress of drought or inundation, exchange of gases with the atmosphere, as well as the cycling of nutrients such as nitrogen and carbon.

Environmental physiologists also examine plant response to biological factors. This includes not only negative interactions, such as competition, herbivory, disease and parasitism, but also positive interactions, such as mutualism and pollination.

While plants, as living beings, can perceive and communicate physical stimuli and damage, they do not feel pain as members of the animal kingdom do simply because of the lack of any pain receptors, nerves, or a brain, and, by extension, lack of consciousness. Many plants are known to perceive and respond to mechanical stimuli at a cellular level, and some plants such as the venus flytrap or touch-me-not, are known for their &quot;obvious sensory abilities&quot;. Nevertheless, the plant kingdom as a whole do not feel pain notwithstanding their abilities to respond to sunlight, gravity, wind, and any external stimuli such as insect bites, since they lack any nervous system. The primary reason for this is that, unlike the members of the animal kingdom whose evolutionary successes and failures are shaped by suffering, the evolution of plants are simply shaped by life and death.

===Tropisms and nastic movements===
Plants may respond both to directional and non-directional stimuli. A response to a directional stimulus, such as gravity or sun light, is called a tropism. A response to a nondirectional stimulus, such as temperature or humidity, is a nastic movement.

Tropisms in plants are the result of differential cell growth, in which the cells on one side of the plant elongates more than those on the other side, causing the part to bend toward the side with less growth. Among the common tropisms seen in plants is phototropism, the bending of the plant toward a source of light. Phototropism allows the plant to maximize light exposure in plants which require additional light for photosynthesis, or to minimize it in plants subjected to intense light and heat. Geotropism allows the roots of a plant to determine the direction of gravity and grow downwards. Tropisms generally result from an interaction between the environment and production of one or more plant hormones.

Nastic movements results from differential cell growth (e.g. epinasty and hiponasty), or from changes in turgor pressure within plant tissues (e.g., nyctinasty), which may occur rapidly. A familiar example is thigmonasty (response to touch) in the Venus fly trap, a carnivorous plant. The traps consist of modified leaf blades which bear sensitive trigger hairs. When the hairs are touched by an insect or other animal, the leaf folds shut. This mechanism allows the plant to trap and digest small insects for additional nutrients. Although the trap is rapidly shut by changes in internal cell pressures, the leaf must grow slowly to reset for a second opportunity to trap insects.

===Plant disease===

Economically, one of the most important areas of research in environmental physiology is that of phytopathology, the study of diseases in plants and the manner in which plants resist or cope with infection. Plant are susceptible to the same kinds of disease organisms as animals, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi, as well as physical invasion by insects and roundworms.

Because the biology of plants differs with animals, their symptoms and responses are quite different. In some cases, a plant can simply shed infected leaves or flowers to prevent the spread of disease, in a process called abscission. Most animals do not have this option as a means of controlling disease. Plant diseases organisms themselves also differ from those causing disease in animals because plants cannot usually spread infection through casual physical contact. Plant pathogens tend to spread via spores or are carried by animal vectors.

One of the most important advances in the control of plant disease was the discovery of Bordeaux mixture in the nineteenth century. The mixture is the first known fungicide and is a combination of copper sulfate and lime. Application of the mixture served to inhibit the growth of downy mildew that threatened to seriously damage the French wine industry.

==History==
===Early history===

Francis Bacon published one of the first plant physiology experiments in 1627 in the book, &quot;Sylva Sylvarum.&quot; Bacon grew several terrestrial plants, including a rose, in water and concluded that soil was only needed to keep the plant upright. Jan Baptist van Helmont published what is considered the first quantitative experiment in plant physiology in 1648. He grew a willow tree for five years in a pot containing 200 pounds of oven-dry soil. The soil lost just two ounces of dry weight and van Helmont concluded that plants get all their weight from water, not soil. In 1699, John Woodward published experiments on growth of spearmint in different sources of water. He found that plants grew much better in water with soil added than in distilled water.

Stephen Hales is considered the Father of Plant Physiology for the many experiments in the 1727 book, &quot;Vegetable Staticks&quot;; though Julius von Sachs unified the pieces of plant physiology and put them together as a discipline. His &quot;Lehrbuch der Botanik&quot; was the plant physiology bible of its time.

Researchers discovered in the 1800s that plants absorb essential mineral nutrients as inorganic ions in water. In natural conditions, soil acts as a mineral nutrient reservoir but the soil itself is not essential to plant growth. When the mineral nutrients in the soil are dissolved in water, plant roots absorb nutrients readily, soil is no longer required for the plant to thrive. This observation is the basis for hydroponics, the growing of plants in a water solution rather than soil, which has become a standard technique in biological research, teaching lab exercises, crop production and as a hobby.

==Economic applications==

=== Food production ===
In horticulture and agriculture along with food science, plant physiology is an important topic relating to fruits, vegetables, and other consumable parts of plants. Topics studied include: &quot;climatic&quot; requirements, fruit drop, nutrition, ripening, fruit set. The production of food crops also hinges on the study of plant physiology covering such topics as optimal planting and harvesting times and post harvest storage of plant products for human consumption and the production of secondary products like drugs and cosmetics.

Crop physiology steps back and looks at a field of plants as a whole, rather than looking at each plant individually. Crop physiology looks at how plants respond to each other and how to maximize results like food production through determining things like optimal planting density.

<doc id="637104" wikidata="Q788469" url="?curid=637104" title="John Luther Adams">
<text>John Luther Adams (born January 23, 1953) is an American composer whose music is inspired by nature, especially the landscapes of Alaska, where he lived from 1978 to 2014. His orchestral work &quot;Become Ocean&quot; was awarded the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Music.

==Early life==
Born in Meridian, Mississippi, Adams began playing music as a teenager as a drummer in rock bands. He attended the California Institute of the Arts as an undergraduate in the early 1970s, studying with James Tenney and Leonard Stein, and graduated in 1973. After graduating, Adams began work in environmental protection, and through this work Adams first travelled to Alaska in 1975. Adams moved to Alaska in 1978 and lived there until 2014. He now splits his time between New York and the Sonoran desert in Mexico, though his time in Alaska continues to be a prominent influence in his music. From 1982 to 1989, he performed as timpanist and principal percussionist with the Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra and the Arctic Chamber Orchestra.

==Career==
Adams&#x27;s composition work spans many genres and media. He has composed for television, film, children&#x27;s theater, voice, acoustic instruments, orchestra, and electronics. Early in his career, Adams was influenced by the music and writings of Frank Zappa, whose enthusiasm for Edgard Varèse intrigued Adams. Through his careful listening to Varèse, Adams developed an interest in and was influenced by the music of John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen, among others. From 1998 to 2002, Adams served as associate professor of composition at Oberlin Conservatory of Music.

===Influence of nature===
Adams has described his music as, &quot;... profoundly influenced by the natural world and a strong sense of place. Through sustained listening to the subtle resonances of the northern soundscape, I hope to explore the territory of sonic geography—that region between place and culture...between environment and imagination&quot;.

His love of nature, concern for the environment and interest in the resonance of specific places led him to pursue the concept of sonic geography. Early examples of this idea include two works written during Adams&#x27;s sojourn in rural Georgia: &quot;Songbirdsongs&quot; (1974–80), a collection of indeterminate miniature pieces for piccolos and percussion based on free translations of bird songs, and &quot;Night Peace&quot; (1977), a vocal work capturing the nocturnal soundscape of the Okefenokee Swamp through slow-changing and sparse sonic textures.

His work, &quot;Sila: The Breath of the World,&quot; represents the &quot;air element&quot;, following the representation of water in &quot;Become Ocean&quot; and the &quot;earth element&quot; in &quot;Inuksuit&quot;, an outdoor percussion piece. His music, he says, is &quot;our awareness of the world in which we live and the world&#x27;s awareness of us&quot;.

His more recent works include, &quot;Across the Distance,&quot; for a large number of horns, was premiered on the 5th of July, 2015 at the Cambo estate in Fife, Scotland as part of the East Neuk Festival. His recording of &quot;Ilimaq&quot; (&quot;spirit journeys&quot;), a solo work for percussion, played by art-music percussionist, composer, and Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche, was released in October 2015. A combination of contemporary classical music, Alaskan field recordings, and found sounds from the natural world, it evokes the travels of a shaman riding the sound of a drum to and from the spirit world.

==Awards and honors==
In 2014 Adams won the Pulitzer Prize for Music for his orchestral piece &quot;Become Ocean&quot;, which Alex Ross of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called &quot;the loveliest apocalypse in musical history&quot;. It was premiered in 2013 by Ludovic Morlot and the Seattle Symphony and performed by the same conductor and orchestra at the 2014 Spring For Music music festival at Carnegie Hall. Adams had never been to Carnegie Hall before hearing his work played there to a sold-out house. The surround-sound recording of &quot;Become Ocean&quot; on Cantaloupe Music debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Traditional Classical Chart, stayed there for two straight weeks, and went on to win the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Classical Composition. All his works are published by Taiga Press (BMI) and available from .

In October 2015, Adams received the William Schuman Award from Columbia University. The events surrounding the award included a series of concerts of his music at the Miller Theater, including &quot;Clouds of Forgetting, Clouds of Unknowing&quot;, &quot;For Lou Harrison&quot;, and &quot;In the White Silence&quot;.

* On February 8, 2015, Adams was awarded a GRAMMY in the category Best Contemporary Classical Composition for his &quot;Become Ocean&quot;.
* In November 2014, Adams was named the Musical America 2015 Composer of the Year.
* Adams was the recipient of the 2010 Nemmers Prize in Music Composition. He was cited by the selection committee for melding the physical and musical worlds into a unique artistic vision that transcends stylistic boundaries.
* The Callithumpian Consort&#x27;s recording of Adams&#x27; &quot;Four Thousand Holes&quot; was noted as one of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s Best Classical Recordings of 2011.
* In 2012, he received the 17th Annual Heinz Award with a special focus on the environment.
* In 2006, Adams was named one of the first United States Artists Fellows. He has received awards and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Rasmuson Foundation, and the Foundation for Contemporary Arts.
* Adams received a 1993 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award.

<doc id="637106" wikidata="Q1925858" url="?curid=637106" title="Metropolitan Borough of Solihull">
<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Solihull is a metropolitan borough in West Midlands county, England. It is named after its largest town, Solihull, from which Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council is based. For Eurostat purposes it is a NUTS 3 region (code UKG32) and is one of seven boroughs or unitary districts that comprise the &quot;West Midlands&quot; NUTS 2 region. Much of the large residential population in the north of the borough centres on the communities of Castle Bromwich, Kingshurst, Marston Green and Smith&#x27;s Wood as well as the towns of Chelmsley Wood and Fordbridge. In the south are the towns of Shirley and Solihull, as well as the large villages of Knowle, Dorridge, Meriden and Balsall Common.

Since 2011, Solihull has formed part of the Greater Birmingham &amp; Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership along with neighbouring authorities Birmingham, Bromsgrove, Cannock Chase, East Staffordshire, Lichfield, Redditch, Tamworth and Wyre Forest.

==History==

Solihull probably derived its name from a &#x27;miry or muddy&#x27; or soily hill. The parish church was built on a hill of stiff red marl, which turned to sticky mud in wet weather.

Solihull was an ancient parish, covering the town itself and adjoining rural areas, including Shirley. Solihull was made the centre of a poor law union in 1836, covering eleven parishes: Baddesley Clinton, Balsall, Barston, Elmdon, Knowle, Lapworth, Nuthurst, Packwood, Solihull, Tanworth and Yardley. Yardley was in Worcestershire and the rest of the parishes were in Warwickshire.

Such poor law unions formed the basis for later local government areas. In 1872 poor law unions also became rural sanitary districts for the parts of their areas without urban authorities; there were no urban authorities in the Solihull union. In 1894 rural sanitary districts were converted into rural districts with their own elected councils under the Local Government Act 1894. The 1894 Act split districts which straddled county boundaries, and so Yardley became a separate rural district (which was later absorbed into Birmingham in 1911), whilst the Warwickshire parishes from the Solihull poor law union became the Solihull Rural District. The 1894 Act also created parish councils for rural parishes, including Solihull.

The Solihull Rural District and the Solihull Parish Council were abolished in 1932. A new urban district of Solihull was created; the parishes of Solihull, Elmdon, Knowle, Nuthurst, Packwood and Sheldon were abolished and most of their combined area became the new urban district, subject to various adjustments to the boundaries with neighbouring parishes. The parts of the old Solihull Rural District not included were added to neighbouring rural districts.

Expansion continued and Queen Elizabeth II granted a charter in 1954 making Solihull into a Municipal Borough; ten years later it was given the status of County Borough. Reorganisation of boundaries and council responsibilities in 1974 created the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull by the merger of the Solihull County Borough and most of the Meriden Rural District, which forms the main rural part of the borough and county. It included Balsall Common, Barston, Berkswell, Bickenhill, Castle Bromwich, Chelmsley Wood, Elmdon, Fordbridge, Hampton in Arden, Hockley Heath, Kingshurst, Knowle, Marston Green, Meriden, Olton, Smiths Wood, Solihull, Shirley and Temple Balsall.

In 1986 the Solihull borough effectively became a unitary authority when the West Midlands County Council was abolished. It remains part of the West Midlands for ceremonial purposes, and for functions such as police, fire and public transport. There is some support to return the borough to Warwickshire for ceremonial purposes, as was the case when the County of Avon was abolished and Bath was returned to Somerset. There were also complaints that Solihull was not involved in the design of the Warwickshire flag in 2016.

==Geography==
The borough is bordered by the M6 and the M40 and split by the M42 which divides the urban centre of the borough from the rural south and east. The borough&#x27;s transport links have led to a number of established large businesses being based in the borough, such as Land Rover, the National Exhibition Centre and Birmingham Airport. A short automatic light transport system links the airport to the nearby Birmingham International railway station. Around three-quarters of the borough is greenbelt and a large proportion of that is worked farmland. The borough shares its boundaries with Birmingham to the west and north, Coventry to the east, Warwickshire to both the north and south and Worcestershire to the south west. The borough contains a sizeable rural area known as the &quot;Meriden Gap&quot; (after the village of Meriden) which serves as a green belt separating the Birmingham conurbation from the city of Coventry. Parts of Solihull neighbour the suburbs of Minworth and Hall Green. Parts also lie close to (but not contiguous with) the town of Coleshill and city of Coventry.

===Council===

Elections to Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council are held in three out of every four years, with one third of the 51 seats on the council being elected at each election. Since the 2011 election The Conservative Party has had a majority on the council.

At the 2015 election to the council, the following members were returned:

For election purposes the council is divided up into the following wards based on civil parishes. Each ward is represented by three councillors:

*Bickenhill
*Blythe
*Castle Bromwich
*Chelmsley Wood
*Dorridge and Hockley Heath
*Elmdon
*Kingshurst and Fordbridge
*Knowle
*Lyndon
*Meriden
*Olton
*Shirley East
*Shirley South
*Shirley West
*Silhill
*Smith&#x27;s Wood
*St Alphege

==Coat of arms==
The constituent parts of the borough&#x27;s coat of arms are:
*Battlements, sickles and an oak tree with golden acorns, which represent the rural and agricultural nature of the Forest of Arden.
*The Black Griffin is taken from the arms of the Earls of Aylesford, who are associated with Meriden.
*The Silver Fleur-de-lys comes from the Digby family, who were associated with Fordbridge.
*The Black Greyhound is taken from the arms of the Greswolds, the family who built the 15th century house called the Manor House in the High Street, Solihull.

A stylised version of the coat of arms can be seen on the top left of Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council&#x27;s website pages, and the official, heraldic version appears on a dedicated page on the same site – external links below.

==Economy==
Solihull is regarded as having one of the strongest subregional economies in the West Midlands, with a significantly higher nominal GVA per capita and Silhillians enjoying considerably higher disposable income rates than both regional and UK averages.

Analysis also shows Solihull as having the lowest (and fastest falling) claimant count for Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance in the region.

The current Flybe airline maintains its head office on the second floor of Diamond House on the property of Birmingham Airport.

<doc id="637107" wikidata="Q7491542" url="?curid=637107" title="Shawnee Mission, Kansas">
<text>Shawnee Mission is a region of northern Johnson County, Kansas, part of the Kansas City metropolitan area in the United States. Since August 1, 1960, the United States Postal Service has used the name to denote a large postal coverage area (ZIP Codes 662xx) at the northeastern tip of Johnson County. It contains numerous towns, and the name was created to structure management of the post offices located therein. Effectively, these towns&#x27; post offices are subsidiaries of the Shawnee Mission Main Post Office in Mission, Kansas. Properly, a mailing address may indicate the delivery &quot;place&quot; as either Shawnee Mission, or the actual town name, and be treated the same.

The following towns are included in the postal area known as Shawnee Mission:
* Countryside (incorporated into the City of Mission in January, 2003)
* Fairway
* Lake Quivira (the northern part is in Wyandotte County, Kansas)
* Leawood
* Lenexa
* Merriam
* Mission
* Mission Hills
* Mission Woods
* Overland Park (except some southern parts)
* Prairie Village
* Roeland Park
* Shawnee
* Stanley (unincorporated)
* Westwood
* Westwood Hills

Parts of southern Overland Park are not part of Shawnee Mission, as they were later annexed from the town of Stillwell which was already covered by ZIP Code 66085. Additionally, delivery to the eastern edge of Overland Park was assigned to the Post Office in Prairie Village, with ZIP Code 66208, and the Prairie Village post office was not managed under the Shawnee Mission designation until 2012.

==History==
The name Shawnee Mission was derived from the Shawnee Methodist Mission. That historical mission to the Shawnee tribe was founded in 1830 by the Methodist church, in what became Wyandotte County, Kansas. The mission was moved to what became Johnson County in 1839. Shawnee Mission subsequently became a local, informal designation for the region surrounding the actual mission, especially before the development, expansion, and conjoint boundarying of the various towns in northeast Johnson County. The Shawnee Mission School District and Blue Valley School District encompass most of the area.

Shawnee Mission is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area. As of 2015, the estimated combined population of Shawnee Mission&#x27;s constituent cities is 402,662 (up from 325,147 in 2000). That is greater than the largest city in Kansas, Wichita.

<text>The San Antonio Wings were an American football team who played a single season in the World Football League in 1975. The team started as the Florida Blazers in 1974, then moved to San Antonio, Texas in 1975, becoming the San Antonio Wings.

==History==
The Florida Blazers never drew well, leading team owner Rommie Loudd to openly discuss moving the team to Atlanta in the middle of the 1974 season. The players and coaches were not paid for three months. Shortly after the Blazers&#x27; defeat in the World Bowl, Loudd was arrested on tax evasion and cocaine trafficking charges. He was convicted on the latter charge and served three years in prison. He was also sentenced to two years in prison for possession and distribution of cocaine.

The Blazers were one of two teams, the other being the Detroit Wheels, to outright fold after 1974 with no direct replacement in their markets in 1975 (not counting teams that moved midseason). Only one expansion team would be added, with Norman Bevan buying the franchise rights and establishing a team in San Antonio.

The new Wings were restocked with an expansion draft but retained 16 former Blazers, including running back Jim Strong and tight end Luther Palmer. Larry Grantham, a linebacker on the 1974 Blazers, retired but joined the Wings&#x27; coaching staff. The team&#x27;s head coach was Perry Moss, a former head coach at Marshall and a former NFL assistant coach; Blazers coach Jack Pardee, who wanted nothing more to do with the WFL, returned to the NFL during the offseason.

Quarterback Johnnie Walton, a relic from the old Continental Football League who had spent most of the early 1970s bouncing around NFL practice squads, led the WFL in passing in 1975. The Wings held their home games at Alamo Stadium, which seated 25,000. San Antonio finished with a 7-6 record (winning all seven home games and losing all six road games) before the league folded on October 22, 1975.

<doc id="637113" wikidata="Q427849" url="?curid=637113" title="Borough of Brentwood">
<text>The Borough of Brentwood is a local government district with borough status in Essex, England. The borough is named after its main town of Brentwood, where the council is based; it includes several villages and the surrounding rural area.

The neighbouring districts are Epping Forest, Chelmsford, Basildon, Thurrock and the London Borough of Havering.

==History==
The former Brentwood Urban District had been created in 1899. Urban districts were abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A new non-metropolitan district was created on 1 April 1974 covering the whole of the former Brentwood Urban District plus parts of another two districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Brentwood Urban District
*Chelmsford Rural District (two parishes only, rest went to Chelmsford)
**Ingatestone and Fryerning
**Mountnessing
*Epping and Ongar Rural District (five parishes only, rest went to Epping Forest)
**Blackmore
**Doddinghurst
**Kelvedon Hatch
**Navestock
**Stondon Massey

The new district was named Brentwood after its main town.
The district was awarded borough status on 10 March 1993, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
Brentwood Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Essex County Council. Parts of the borough are also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council went under no overall control at the 2023 Brentwood Borough Council election. A Liberal Democrat and Labour coalition subsequently formed an administration.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Brentwood. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1991 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election, the composition of the council is:

The next election is due in May 2026.

===Premises===
The council is based at Brentwood Town Hall on Ingrave Road, which had been built in 1957 for the former Brentwood Urban District Council.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2002, the council has comprised 37 councillors representing 15 wards; each ward elects one, two or three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with roughly a third of the council being elected each time for a four-year term. In the fourth year of the cycle, when there are no elections for the borough council, elections for Essex County Council are held instead.

==Geography==

There are still large areas of woodland including Shenfield Common, Hartswood (named after its last private owner, a Mr. Hart), Weald Country Park, and Thorndon Country Park. 

==Transport==
The main transport links run through the borough in a south-west to north-east direction, with other important links running west to east. 

===Railway===
Railway stations at Shenfield and Ingatestone facilitate services along the Great Eastern Main Line to Colchester, Clacton, Ipswich and London Liverpool Street; these are operated by Greater Anglia.

Brentwood and Shenfield stations are served by Greater Anglia trains between Liverpool Street, , and ; some peak hour services run to . Elizabeth line stopping trains run between London Paddington, Brentwood and Shenfield; this route is operated by MTR.

Also within the borough is West Horndon station, on the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend line; c2c provides direct trains to London Fenchurch Street, , Southend Central and .

===Roads===
A major trunk road running through the borough is the A12 dual-carriageway, running from East London to Chelmsford, Colchester, the ports of Harwich and Felixstowe, Ipswich and Lowestoft. The old Roman road (A1023) passes through the centre of Brentwood and joins the A12, which by-passes the town. Within different parts of Brentwood, the A1023 is called (from west to east) Brook Street, London Road, High Street, Shenfield Road, and Chelmsford Road. 

The other main road in the borough is the A127 &quot;Southend Arterial Road&quot;, which separates from the A12 near Romford and then proceeds easterly to Southend-on-Sea.

== Media ==
The borough is served by a dedicated community radio stations, Phoenix FM.

<text>A lunette (French &quot;lunette&quot;, &#x27;little moon&#x27;) is a crescent- or half-moon–shaped or semi-circular architectural space or feature, variously filled with sculpture, painted, glazed, filled with recessed masonry, or void. 
A lunette may also be segmental, and the arch may be an arc taken from an oval. 
A lunette window is commonly called a &quot;half-moon window&quot;, or fanlight when bars separating its panes fan out radially.

If a door is set within a round-headed arch, the space within the arch above the door, masonry or glass is a lunette. If the door is a major access, and the lunette above is massive and deeply set, it may be called a tympanum.

A lunette is also formed when a horizontal cornice transects a round-headed arch at the level of the imposts, where the arch springs. If the top of the lunette itself is bordered by a hood mould it can also be considered a pediment.

The term is also employed to describe the section of interior wall between the curves of a vault and its springing line. A system of intersecting vaults produces lunettes on the wall surfaces above a cornice. The lunettes in the structure of the Sistine Chapel ceiling inspired Michelangelo to come up with inventive compositions for the spaces.

In the Neoclassical architecture of Robert Adam and his French contemporaries such as Ange-Jacques Gabriel, a favorite scheme set a series of windows within shallow blind arches. The lunettes above lent themselves to radiating motifs: a sunburst of bellflower husks, radiating fluting, a low vase of flowers, etc.

The Flemish painter Giusto Utens rendered a series of Medicean villas in lunette form for the third grand duke of Tuscany, Ferdinando I, in 1599–1602.

<text>The Jacksonville Sharks were a professional American football team based in Jacksonville, Florida which competed in the World Football League in 1974. The Sharks folded during the 1974 season due to financial difficulties, and were succeeded by the Jacksonville Express which also folded when the league ceased operations during the 1975 season.

== History ==
The Sharks were one of the original franchises of the World Football League, a failed attempt to launch a major professional football league in the United States in competition with the National Football League. In 1974, the team played seven home games at the Gator Bowl Stadium in Jacksonville. The Sharks roster was a mixture of rookies such as Mike Townsend, Eddie McAshan and Reggie Oliver, and veterans like Ike Lassiter, John Stofa, Drew Buie, and former University of Florida All-American lineman Larry Gagner. Six weeks into the season, the team had a 2–4 record, and owner Fran Monaco fired head coach Bud Asher—who had actually loaned Monaco $27,000 a few weeks earlier in order to meet payroll. The Sharks did not improve under new coach Charlie Tate, however, losing six of their remaining eight games.

Despite their mediocre play on the field, the Sharks reported that they were second in the league in attendance. The front office claimed to have sold 18,000 season tickets, and listed attendance numbers of 59,112 for the home opener against the New York Stars and 46,780 for their second home game against the Southern California Sun. However, in a similar situation to that in Philadelphia, the club later admitted to giving away 44,000 tickets for the first two games and distributing many thousands more free or sharply discounted tickets for subsequent home games. As with several WFL teams, declining real ticket sales coupled with uncontrolled spending led to serious cash flow problems. The team also dealt with some infrastructure problems: while on national television, the power failed at the Gator Bowl during the team&#x27;s game against the New York Stars on July 11, forcing the game to be delayed while power was restored to the lights.

Monaco tried to sell the team to New York financier William Pease; however, after it emerged that Pease was under indictment regarding a Connecticut land deal, the WFL took over the franchise on September 22. The players, who had not been paid for over a month, threatened not to fly to Anaheim to play the Southern California Sun. League Commissioner Gary Davidson paid them $65,000 in escrow and the players made the trip. A week later, after vetoing several prospective owners, the WFL folded the team (as well as the hapless Detroit Wheels), and the Sharks&#x27; last six games were cancelled.

Today, the name is used by the National Arena League&#x27;s Jacksonville Sharks, which began play in the Arena Football League in 2010.

<text>The Jacksonville Express were a professional American football team based in Jacksonville, Florida which competed in the World Football League (WFL) in 1975. They were preceded in 1974 by the WFL&#x27;s Jacksonville Sharks, though the two teams had separate ownership and identities. The Express folded when the league ceased operations during the 1975 season.

== History ==
The Jacksonville Sharks were a professional American football team based in Jacksonville, Florida which competed in the 1974 WFL season. The Sharks folded during that season due to financial difficulties. The WFL returned to Jacksonville the following season with the Jacksonville Express. While head coach Charlie Tate and a few players returned from the Sharks, the Express had new owners (local businessman Earl Knabb along with several minor partners) and a mostly new front office staff. The team&#x27;s biggest player acquisitions were quarterback George Mira, who had been co-MVP of the 1974 WFL championship game with Birmingham and had been a college All-American with the in-state Miami Hurricanes, and Tommy Reamon, who had led the WFL in rushing in 1974 with the Florida Blazers. Paul Orndorff, later a famed professional wrestler, was briefly on the Express roster.

The new ownership group sought to be much more frugal than the free-spending Sharks had been. One notable example of this was that while the Sharks&#x27; headquarters had been located in a large suite atop a skyscraper in downtown Jacksonville, the offices of the Express were located in a mall in the basement of a hotel. Accordingly, the franchise was able to meet its financial obligations throughout its short existence. However, the WFL had lost their television contract right before the 1975 season, putting the entire league in serious financial difficulty. The Express had compiled a 6–5 record when the WFL folded in October 1975, 11 games into a planned 20-game schedule.

<text>Daniel J. Walker (August 6, 1922 – April 29, 2015) was an American lawyer, businessman and politician from Illinois. A member of the Democratic party, he served as the 36th governor of Illinois, from 1973 until 1977. Born in Washington, D.C., Walker was raised in San Diego, before serving in the Navy as an enlisted man and officer during World War II and the Korean War. He moved to Illinois between the wars to attend Northwestern University School of Law, entering politics in the state during the 1960s.

Walker was perhaps best known for walking the state of Illinois in 1971 during his candidacy for governor and for being an outsider to Illinois&#x27; machine politics. Running against the machine&#x27;s candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor, Walker scored a rare upset in the March 1972 primary election. He went on that year to defeat the Republican incumbent, but lost his own bid for re-election in 1976. His post political career was marked by high living, but marred by a guilty plea to bank fraud and perjury at the peak of the late 1980s savings and loan crisis. After a year and a half in federal prison, Walker retired to the San Diego metro area and wrote several books before he died in 2015.

== Early life and career ==

Walker was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Virginia May (Lynch) and Lewis Wesley Walker, who were both from Texas. He was raised near San Diego, California, and was valedictorian when he graduated from high school there in 1940. He joined the U.S. Naval Reserve while still in high school, serving on a four pipe destroyer during the summers. His college plans at San Diego State College were interrupted when he was called to active duty in 1940 and served as an enlisted man on a minesweeper out of Point Loma, San Diego. In 1941, he took an exam to become an officer, ranking fifth out of over three thousand that were tested. He was attending the Naval Academy Preparatory School in Norfolk when Pearl Harbor was attacked. He graduated the United States Naval Academy in 1946 and would later be the second governor of Illinois to graduate from Annapolis. After that, he served as a naval officer near the end of World War II.

Walker moved to Illinois to attend Northwestern in 1947. He was recalled to the Navy during the Korean War and was communications officer on . A 1950 graduate of the Northwestern University School of Law, Walker served as a law clerk for Chief Justice of the United States Fred M. Vinson, and as an aide to Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson II. Walker later became an executive for Montgomery Ward while supporting reform politics in Chicago. In 1970, Walker was campaign chairman for the successful U.S. Senate campaign of Adlai Stevenson III (son of Adlai II). The National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence appointed Walker to head the Chicago Study Team that investigated the violent clashes between police and protesters at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. In December, the team issued its report, &quot;Rights in Conflict&quot;, better known as the &quot;Walker Report&quot;. The &quot;Report&quot; became highly controversial, and its author well-known. The report stated that while protesters had deliberately harassed and provoked police, the police had responded with indiscriminate violence against protesters, journalists, and bystanders, which Walker described as a &quot;police riot&quot;. The &quot;Report&quot; charged that many police had committed criminal acts, and condemned the failure to prosecute or even discipline those police.

== Governor of Illinois ==
Walker announced his candidacy for Governor of Illinois in 1971 and attracted wide attention by walking across Illinois in 1971. At this time he was the General Counsel of Montgomery Ward and Company, a position he had for over 5 years. During his campaign, Montgomery Ward &amp; Company continued to pay him. They paid him $200,000 per year (equal to $2,000,000 in 2020 dollars.) He also employed his administrative assistant, working on his campaign, who was also paid by Montgomery Ward. Montgomery Ward hoped that this political support would yield benefits when Walker became governor. This never materialized. Walker&#x27;s political platform was to stop the &quot;Crosstown Expressway&quot; in Chicago. This was to run north–south, along Cicero Avenue and had been part of the State of Illinois Transportation plan since the 1950s. This expressway would have had 1 billion dollars of federal funding (10 billion in 2020 dollars). Walker received campaign funds from the Archdiocese of Chicago to stop this Expressway because it would have affected two of the most profitable parishes at the north end at Cicero and the Kennedy expressway.

When Walker was elected, he stopped the Illinois Department of Transportation from pursuing this expressway project. This was a direct political strike against Mayor Daley, who did not support Walker. He narrowly won the 1972 Democratic primary against then-Lieutenant Governor Paul Simon. Though Simon had a &quot;good government&quot; reputation, Walker attacked Simon for soliciting and accepting the endorsement of the Cook County Democratic Party chaired by Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, which Walker charged reflected servility to the &quot;Daley Machine&quot;. In the 1972 general election, he defeated incumbent Republican Richard B. Ogilvie by a 51% to 49% margin. In the early 1970s, Walker was discussed as a possible presidential candidate.
The enmity between Walker and Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley&#x27;s political organization was deep. In 1974, Walker supported state legislative candidates against Daley allies. Walker&#x27;s deputy governor, Victor deGrazia, later said: &quot;I knew from the beginning that every time Daley looked at Walker, he saw the Church of England and the British suppression of the Irish, and when Dan would look at Daley, he would see the quintessential politician who was only interested in political gain.&quot; &quot;We never established anything even approaching a personal rapport. To some degree, this was an obvious and natural result of my independent political activity. But it went deeper – much deeper,&quot; said Walker. During his tenure, Walker was often at odds with both Republicans and Democrats in the state legislature. He did obtain passage of the first law requiring disclosure of campaign contributions and issued a series of executive orders prohibiting corrupt practices by state employees. In 1976 Walker was defeated in the Democratic primary, losing to Illinois Secretary of State Michael Howlett, the candidate supported by Mayor Daley, by a 54% to 46% margin. In the general election, Howlett was overwhelmingly defeated by James R. Thompson. A Democrat would not serve as governor of the state for the next 26 years, when Rod Blagojevich was elected in 2002.

== Post-governorship ==

In the 1980s, Walker entered the private sector by forming Butler-Walker, Inc, a chain of self-named quick oil change franchises later bought by Jiffy Lube, and acquiring two savings and loan associations, one of which was First American Savings and Loan Association of Oak Brook which would later be declared insolvent. In 1987, Walker was charged with Federal bank fraud based on two loans. A private contractor borrowed $279,000 from First American to build schools. Walker later personally borrowed $45,000 from that individual on a &quot;handshake&quot; basis. Those two loans (&quot;borrowing from a borrower&quot; while serving as a director) constituted bank fraud. Walker agreed to a plea bargain with Federal prosecutors; he pleaded guilty to bank fraud in the loan, perjury (based on dealings by the Association with his son), and filing false financial statements. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment for bank fraud, three years for perjury, and probation for false financial statements; the sentences to be served consecutively. At his sentencing, U.S. District Judge Ann Williams stated, &quot;It&#x27;s clear to this court that a pattern was established and that you, Mr. Walker, thought this bank was your own personal piggy bank to bail you out whenever you got into trouble.&quot;

The U.S. Attorney General ruled that &quot;borrowing from a borrower&quot;, which was Walker&#x27;s main offense, was a violation of the regulations but not a violation of law. In 1987, news media reported Walker received over a million dollars in fraudulent loans for his business and repairs on his yacht &quot;Governor&#x27;s Lady&quot;. As part of a plea agreement no charges were laid against Walker for any other loans, and no other loans by First American were described as fraudulent. Walker served eighteen months of his seven-year sentence and was released in 1989 after his attorneys cited his failing health. Judge Williams ordered him released from prison based on &quot;time served&quot; and placed on probation until the two loans in question were repaid. This order eliminated the two other charges. During the mid-1980s Savings and loan crisis, First American was declared insolvent and taken over by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). It continued in business as before, run by individuals brought in by FSLIC. There were no bondholders of First American and Walker and his wife were the only stockholders. When the two loans described above were repaid, Walker was released from probation and the case against him was closed. There was no cost to taxpayers for his specific loans, but in 1989, First American and another Chicago area S&amp;L were bailed out by tax payers for just under $80 million. First American had $22.2 million in negative equity at that point. Walker became the second of four Governors of Illinois in the 20th and 21st centuries to be convicted on federal criminal charges. The others were Otto Kerner Jr., George Ryan, and Rod Blagojevich. However, unlike Kerner, Ryan, and Blagojevich, Walker&#x27;s crimes were not related to his term as governor.

== Later life and death ==

After his release from prison in 1989, Walker moved to San Diego. He found work as a paralegal. Walker also began writing. In 2003, it was reported that he was writing for six hours a day and had several writing projects in the works, including a cookbook for couples. By 2007, he had written several books, and published at least three. In January 2001, Walker requested a pardon from outgoing President Bill Clinton, but his request was not granted. In 2007, he published &quot;The Maverick and the Machine&quot;, in which he discussed his political career, his experiences in prison, and his business and law troubles. Of the latter, he wrote &quot;I knew this was against regulations, but, like most businessmen, I saw a huge difference between a law and a regulation.&quot; After his plea deal was reached in 1987, Walker stated, &quot;I have broken the law and pleaded guilty, I have deep regrets and no excuses.&quot; Walker died on April 29, 2015, at a veterans hospital in Chula Vista, California, from heart failure, aged 92.

== Personal life ==

Walker was married in 1947 to Roberta Dowse, a Catholic school teacher from Kenosha, Wisconsin. They had seven children, three boys—Daniel Jr., Charles, and William—and four girls, Kathleen, Julie, Roberta, and Margaret. They were divorced in 1977 after 30 years of marriage, when he left her for another woman. Walker later admitted that the breakdown of the marriage and the divorce was primarily his fault, caused by his stubbornness, arrogance, and lust, and apologized for the pain it caused his family. He also called the divorce the worst decision of his life. Roberta Dowse-Walker, the former First Lady of Illinois, died in December 2006 from colon cancer. Walker later married Roberta Nelson, who was 14 years his junior, and was divorced in 1989 while he was in prison. In 2007 he resided in Escondido, California, with his third wife, Lillian Stewart. In 2007, they adopted a son. As of 2007, he resided in Rosarito Beach, Baja California, Mexico.

<text>William Grant Stratton (February 26, 1914 – March 2, 2001) was an American politician who served as the 32nd governor of Illinois from 1953 to 1961.

==Early life and career==
Born February 26, 1914, in Ingleside, Lake County, Illinois, the son of William J. Stratton, an Illinois politician and former Secretary of State, and Zula Van Wormer Stratton, he served two non-consecutive terms as an at-large representative from Illinois after he was elected in 1940 and 1946. He was elected State Treasurer in 1942 and 1950.

Mr. Stratton was educated in the public schools of Lake County, Illinois and graduated from the University of Arizona in 1934 with a degree in Political Science. In 1953, he received the annual alumni award from his alma mater. He holds honorary degrees from the University of Arizona, Bradley University, Lincoln Memorial University, Elmhurst, North Central and Shurtlell Colleges and John Marshall Law School.

He was first elected to the United States Congress from the state at-large in 1940. At 26, he was the youngest member of the 77th Congress. Following this two year term, he was elected State Treasurer. In 1944 he volunteered for service in the U.S. Navy and served in the Pacific Theatre of Operations in World War II. He joined the U.S. Navy, where he served as a lieutenant from 1944 to 1946.

Returning to civilian life in 1946, he was elected to the U.S. Congress from the state-at-large for a second time. While in Congress he served on the following committees; Banking and Currency, Flood Control, Civil Service and District of Columbia.

In 1950 he was elected State Treasurer for a second term. Mr. Stratton reduced substantially the cost of operating this office during his administration. Mr. Stratton was inaugurated as the 32nd Governor of Illinois on January 12, 1953. At 38, he was the youngest man to hold this office in 70 years. He was re-elected to a second term in 1956.

After his military service, Stratton returned to politics, serving as a delegate to the 1952, 1956, 1960 and 1976 Republican National Conventions.

He served on the Executive Committee of the Governors&#x27; Conference and in 1955 brought the annual meeting of the nation&#x27;s governors to Illinois for the first time in history. In 1957, Governor Stratton was named chairman of the Governors&#x27; Conference, and served as president of the Council of State governments in 1958. In 1959, he was a member of the group of American Governors which visited Russia.

He was a candidate for Republican nomination for Vice President in 1960.

The Illinois governor has been instrumental in developing Governors&#x27; Conference programs in the fields of highway construction, traffic safety, and federal state governmental relations. President Eisenhower, in 1958, named Governor Stratton a member of the Lincoln Sesquicentennial commission and in 1959, Mr. Stratton was a delegate to the Republican National Convention, and in the latter year led the Illinois delegation as its chairman.

==Governor==
He won the Republican nomination for governor in 1952 and defeated Lieutenant Governor Sherwood Dixon to become the youngest governor in America at the time. Stratton was re-elected governor in 1956. in 1960, he ran for an unprecedented third consecutive term, but was defeated by Democrat Otto Kerner, Jr. 

Stratton was acquitted on charges of tax evasion in 1965. In 1968, he ran in the Republican primary for Governor and was defeated by Richard B. Ogilvie. Stratton finished a distant third, with only about seven percent of the primary vote.

Mr. Stratton considered the construction of the first 200 miles of the Illinois tollway system as one of his biggest achievements, his wife, Shirley, said in a telephone interview.

During his tenure, state hospital reforms were instituted that included beds for inmates, a bond issue was approved that funded the state’s expressway system, the first woman was chosen in a cabinet level status, and an improved state sales tax was initiated and used in school programs. After running unsuccessfully for a third term, Stratton left office on January 9, 1961.

==Personal life==
In 1934, Stratton married Marion Hook. They had two children, Sandra (born 1936) and Diana (born 1939). Stratton and his wife spent most of their time apart because of his hectic political schedule, and Marion became dissatisfied with the marriage. Also, Marion despised the political arena and expressed distaste at her husband&#x27;s relatively meager salary. Although Stratton did not want a divorce, his wife insisted that they end the marriage. He obtained a divorce from her on the grounds of desertion in 1949. Although Marion was granted custody of the children, they lived primarily with Stratton until 1952.

In 1950, Stratton married Shirley Breckenridge (1923-2019). They have a daughter, Nancy. His second marriage was a happier one, and Shirley actively campaigned for her husband. The two remained married until his death in 2001.

Stratton retired from politics after his failed 1968 gubernatorial race. Stratton died on March 2, 2001, and was buried at the Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago, Illinois. Interment at North Shore Garden of Memories, North Chicago, Ill.

<doc id="637133" wikidata="Q4916593" url="?curid=637133" title="Birmingham Americans">
<text>The Birmingham Americans were a professional American football team located in Birmingham, Alabama. They were members of the four-team Central Division of the World Football League (WFL). The Americans, founded in late December 1973, played in the upstart league&#x27;s inaugural season in 1974. The team was owned by William &quot;Bill&quot; Putnam, doing business as Alabama Football, Inc.

The club played all of their home games at Legion Field. The most successful of the World Football League franchises, the Americans led the league in attendance and won all 13 of their home games. They developed a reputation for come-from-behind victories and winning by narrow margins. The Americans finished the 1974 regular season at 15–5 and won the 1974 World Bowl by one point over the Florida Blazers.

Financially unstable due to investor reluctance and lavish signing bonuses paid to lure National Football League (NFL) players to the new league, the team folded after only one season. Most of the team&#x27;s assets were seized to pay back taxes; failed lawsuits to recover the signing bonus money kept the team in the headlines long after the WFL was itself defunct. The Americans were replaced as the Birmingham WFL franchise for the 1975 season by a new team called the Birmingham Vulcans.

==Franchise history==
Atlanta businessman William R. &quot;Bill&quot; Putnam was awarded an expansion franchise for Birmingham in the upstart World Football League and secured a lease to play at Legion Field. The five original investors in Alabama Football, Inc., all Atlanta businessmen, were majority owner Bill Putnam, Cecil Day, Lon Day, Jay Donnelly, and Erv Plesko. Between them they had already invested over US$1.5 million in the franchise and hoped to find ten investors in Birmingham to buy in for an additional $150,000 each. Unable to find local investors for the team, Putnam threatened to move the Americans from Birmingham before the start of the 1974 season. However, with more than 10,000 season tickets sold before the first game, the team&#x27;s position in Birmingham was secured for the year.

Vince Costello, an assistant coach with the Cincinnati Bengals, was chosen as head coach/general manager. A few days after the announcement, he turned down the job to become an assistant with the Miami Dolphins. Jack Gotta, head coach of the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League (CFL), was hired. Gotta put together a solid squad, including veteran quarterback George Mira, rookie passer Matthew Reed, wide receiver Dennis Homan, running back Charley Harraway of the Redskins, and former St. Louis Cardinals and Auburn standout safety Larry Willingham. Johnny Musso, a former Alabama fullback with the CFL&#x27;s BC Lions, was the Americans&#x27; first round pick in the WFL&#x27;s &quot;pro draft&quot; in March 1974. Birmingham selected 42-year-old retired professional basketball player and former Atlanta Hawks head coach Richie Guerin in the fortieth and last round of that draft, drawing laughter from the audience. Radio play-by-play duties were handled by Larry Matson with color commentary provided by a series of guest commentators.

==1974 season==
Birmingham competed in the Central Division, along with the Chicago Fire, Memphis Southmen, and Detroit Wheels. The team began training camp on June 3 at the Marion Military Institute in Marion, Alabama, and broke camp during the first week in July. The Americans played a 20-game regular season with no pre-season games. (The team did however play one &quot;controlled scrimmage&quot; against the Jacksonville Sharks on Saturday, June 29, 1974.) Most games were played on Wednesday nights with nationally televised games on Thursday nights. The Americans won their first ten games, finishing the regular season 15–5, in second place in the Central Division behind Memphis. Midway through the season, the World Football League Players Association was formed and Americans fullback Charley Harraway was selected to serve as its first president. Alfred Jenkins was named the team&#x27;s Most Valuable Player for the 1974 season.

===First half===
The Americans&#x27; first game was played on July 10, 1974, against the Southern California Sun in front of a crowd of 53,231 at Legion Field. (The announced attendance of 53,231 was inflated. The actual attendance figure was 43,031 for the opening game, of which 41,799 had paid.) Held scoreless by the Sun for the first three quarters and trailing by a touchdown at the start of the fourth quarter, the Americans came back to win 11–7. In their first road game, the Americans overcame a 26-point deficit at halftime to win 32–29 over the New York Stars in front of 17,943 at Downing Stadium on July 17, 1974. The second home game, a 58–33 win over the Memphis Southmen on July 24, drew an announced attendance of 61,319 fans (actual attendance was 54,413 with 40,367 paying).

In the first of back-to-back games against the Detroit Wheels, Birmingham quarterback Matthew Reed scored the game-winning touchdown with 2:12 remaining in the fourth quarter to secure a 21–18 victory. The July 31, 1974, road win was witnessed by 14,614 fans in Rynearson Stadium in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Reed led a four-play touchdown drive in the last 26 seconds of the Americans&#x27; third home game to give Birmingham another win, 28–22 over Detroit. An announced 56,453 (33,993 paying) fans sat through rain and foul weather to see the victory on August 7. Weather was also a factor in the Americans&#x27; fourth home game as driving rain delayed the start of the August 14 game against The Hawaiians and reduced attendance to 43,297. Fans at Legion Field saw a halftime show featuring grass skirt-clad hula dancers with music provided by the Tuscaloosa High School marching band in addition to the 39–0 victory by Birmingham.

The Americans travelled to Florida to face the Jacksonville Sharks, 27,140 Jacksonville fans, and the Sharks&#x27; new coach, Charlie Tate. Birmingham managed a 15–14 win with a touchdown by Charley Harraway and action point by quarterback Matthew Reed with 19 seconds remaining in the August 21 game. The Americans then went north to face the Chicago Fire on Thursday, August 29, 1974, in their first nationally televised game. Birmingham won that match-up 22–8 with 44,732 fans in attendance at Soldier Field.

A quick turnaround found the Americans back home for a Labor Day game against the Eastern Division-leading Florida Blazers on Monday, September 2, 1974, with 36,529 fans in the stadium. A fourth quarter scoring drive kept Birmingham&#x27;s winning streak intact with a narrow 8–7 win over Florida. Another short week found the Americans in action on Saturday, September 7, 1974, at home against the Chicago Fire. Weather was again a factor as Hurricane Carmen pushed &quot;torrential rains&quot; into the Birmingham area, drenching the field, the players, and the 54,872 fans in attendance. A 34-yard field goal by Earl Sark with less than one minute to go in the game was the difference in Birmingham&#x27;s 41–40 victory over Chicago.

===Second half===
Four games in just two weeks proved too much for the Americans as their ten-game winning streak came to an end on September 11 with a loss to the Memphis Southmen. After rallying for seven fourth-quarter comebacks in their first ten games, Birmingham lost 46–7 in front of a 30,675-strong crowd at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium.

The Americans&#x27; nationally televised September 19 home game against the Houston Texans proved to be the last WFL game for Houston as the following week the Texans were taken over by the league and relocated to Shreveport, Louisiana. Just 33,619 fans at Legion Field saw the 42–14 win for Birmingham, the beginning of a slow, downward trend in attendance figures that coincided with the start of college football season. The Americans who, in the words of UPI sportswriter Joe Carnicelli, &quot;made the last-minute score almost their trademark&quot;, were upset 26–21 by the Portland Storm with 14,273 in the stands at Portland&#x27;s Civic Stadium. The Storm scored the game-winning touchdown with 35 seconds left in the September 25 road contest.

The long flight across the Pacific Ocean did not help Birmingham for their October 2 game in Honolulu. The Americans lost 14–8 to The Hawaiians in front of 12,039 fans at Honolulu Stadium (demolished in 1976). Birmingham trailed after the first quarter but rallied to defeat the Portland Storm 30–8 in front of a below-average 25,621 hometown fans at Legion Field on October 9. The following week, on October 16, the Americans lost their third game in four weeks, falling 29–25 to the Southern California Sun before a crowd of 25,247 in Anaheim.
In mid-October, Americans team president Carol Stallworth announced that the team&#x27;s remaining home games would start at 7 p.m. to &quot;make it easier for our early-rising fans&quot; than the original 8 p.m. kickoffs. Also, the Americans&#x27; game schedule was adjusted to accommodate the league&#x27;s shifting and struggling franchises. The October 23 game against the Shreveport Steamer scheduled for Birmingham would be played on the road in Shreveport instead and, in return, their November 13 match-up was relocated from Shreveport&#x27;s State Fair Stadium to Birmingham&#x27;s Legion Field. On the road unexpectedly, the Americans suffered their only shutout of the season, falling to the Steamer 31–0 in front of 24,617 fans.

The October 30 game with the Florida Blazers was moved from Orlando to Birmingham, giving the Americans 11 home games in their 20-game regular season. This was one of two home games relocated out of Orlando as part of a legal settlement between the WFL and Blazers ownership to sell the financially troubled team, pay off debts, and get checks to players who had not been paid since mid-September. Not included in the Americans&#x27; season ticket package, this extra home game tallied the lowest home attendance to date for the Americans with 21,872 present at Legion Field. In that game, quarterback George Mira injured his shoulder in the second quarter and rookie Matthew Reed came off the bench to lead the Americans to a 26–18 victory.

Birmingham scored all of their points in the first half of their November 6 home game against the Philadelphia Bell then fought off a second-half comeback attempt by Philadelphia to win 26–23 before 22,963 at Legion Field. With this victory, the team clinched a spot in the WFL playoffs but the Birmingham franchise&#x27;s increasing financial woes put the playing of the final regular season game in doubt. A deal with tax officials was worked out and the Americans wrapped up the regular season on November 13 with a 40–7 win over the Shreveport Steamer, marking three consecutive home game victories. With doubts as to whether this game would be played persisting until the day of the contest, ticket sales were poor; only 14,794 fans saw the final regular season game the Americans would play. Although they slumped to a .500 record in the second half, it was enough to finish second, behind Central Division-winning Memphis, at 15–5 and take the wild card slot in the six-team playoff series and earn a bye in the first round.

===Post-season===
After receiving a bye from the quarterfinal playoff games, Birmingham beat the Western Division-winning The Hawaiians in the semifinals, 22–19, in front of a sparse 15,379 at Legion Field. The Americans advanced to host the World Bowl, the WFL&#x27;s championship game, on Thursday, December 5. Unpaid since early October, the Americans players staged a walkout on the Monday before the title game demanding back pay. The players returned when team ownership promised to buy each player a championship ring. The game went forward and Birmingham beat the Florida Blazers by a point, 22–21. This game was played with 32,376 fans in the stands, over 20,000 fewer than had witnessed the Americans&#x27; first game just five months before. This was the only championship game ever held by the WFL, as it folded 12 games into the 1975 regular season.

===Playoffs===
==Financial fallout==
In early November 1974, Alabama Attorney General Bill Baxley filed suit in Jefferson County Circuit Court for a tax lien against the team&#x27;s property. The suit sought to recover the $30,000 in state income withholding taxes and more than $57,000 in sales taxes for August and September 1974 (plus a then-undetermined amount due for October 1974) due to the state of Alabama. The judge ordered Jefferson County&#x27;s sheriff to &quot;attach the property, real, personal and mixed, of the defendant, wherever it may be in Jefferson County.&quot; The team also admitted it owed roughly US$14,000 in back sales taxes to both Jefferson County and to the city of Birmingham.

The Birmingham motel where the coaching staff had its offices evicted the team for non-payment on November 14. At that time, the Americans had not paid their players for five weeks, nor their staff and coaches for two weeks. On November 18, 1974, the Internal Revenue Service filed its own tax liens of about $237,000 against the Americans and $160,000 against team owner Bill Putnam.

Putnam announced at a press conference that he was trying to raise the funds to pay the team&#x27;s debts. He reported that the team had taken in about $2.3 million in gate receipts to that point, which left him &quot;only $300,000 short of operating the club&quot;, but revealed that the team had also &quot;paid out over $1.2 million in bonuses to future players.&quot; He asserted that the team would not be in such dire financial straits if that bonus money had not been paid. Putnam said that he would need to raise $750,000 by November 28 so the team could pay back taxes due to the state, county, and city as well as the salaries of players who had not been paid in four weeks. He said &quot;If the money comes from Birmingham, we&#x27;ll stay here but if the money comes from people in Timbuktu who want the team in Timbuktu, them we&#x27;ll move there.&quot; Putnam said a group from New York was interested in purchasing the Americans. Putnam speculated that one reason he had been unable to secure &quot;local money&quot; to invest in the franchise was that local interests were still hoping to bring an NFL franchise to the city.

===Loss of property===
To attempt to pay back the debt and to allow the World Bowl to be played, the teams negotiated a deal with creditors to accept a portion of the gate receipts. After paying fixed costs associated with the game, the IRS and others due money would split 30 percent of the revenue with the teams receiving the remaining 70 percent to pay long-overdue player salaries. This revenue was split by the Americans and Blazers on a 60/40 basis with the World Bowl winners receiving the larger share. Based on gate receipts, each Americans player was to be paid about US$1,400 for their World Bowl play with each Blazers player taking home about US$1,000.

Hibbett Sporting Goods had provided uniforms and football equipment to the Americans but still had not been paid US$38,800 by the end of the season. Immediately after the championship victory, members of the Jefferson County Sheriff&#x27;s Department seized the team&#x27;s equipment and uniforms from the locker room. One week later, Hibbett Sporting Goods began selling the reclaimed gear as souvenirs and Christmas presents in their retail stores.

===Loss of players===
Oakland Raiders quarterback Kenny Stabler signed a contract with Birmingham in 1974. In January 1975, a circuit court judge found that the team was in arrears on payment of the remaining US$30,000 due to Stabler of the US$100,000 he was guaranteed for 1974 and so ruled that the Americans were in breach of contract and thus Stabler was released. The three-year deal was to have paid Stabler US$100,000 in both 1974 and 1975 while he played out his contract option with the Raiders and US$135,000 for the 1976 season when he would have been playing for the Americans. The judge ruled Stabler released from his contract and voided any debt to him by the then-struggling Americans franchise.

While the successor to the Americans, the Vulcans were a different organization and ownership from the Americans and did not assume any of their debts or obligations, including any of the Americans&#x27; player contracts. The Internal Revenue Service seized the Americans player contracts and placed them up for auction in March 1975 to pay the team&#x27;s US$236,691 in overdue taxes but a judge ruled &quot;all&quot; of these player contracts breached and of no value. In any case, the auction was cancelled when a judge ruled that Birmingham Trust National Bank had a valid prior claim to the contracts.

===Loss of franchise===
Newly elected WFL president Chris Hemmeter was determined to impose a measure of financial sanity on the league. Among other things, he insisted that all potential owners establish a $650,000 line of credit with the league. Putnam tried to find more local investors to meet this requirement, but there were few takers.

In late January 1975, Hemmeter revoked the Americans&#x27; franchise due to the team&#x27;s chronic financial woes. Hemmeter stated that the Americans owed a total of $2 million in bills, taxes and missed player salaries. However, the league said it had every intention of placing a new team in Birmingham. Putnam responded by suing the league, demanding to be compensated with the rights to New York City. However, the suit went nowhere.

On March 7, 1975, Ferd Weil, as president of the board of directors of a new WFL franchise for Birmingham, announced that the Birmingham WFL team for 1975 would be called the Birmingham Vulcans, a name previously registered by a group of Birmingham businessmen who had been trying to secure an NFL franchise for Birmingham. The Vulcans began selling shares of stock to the general public. Priced at US$10 per share and sold only in blocks of 10 shares, the team hoped to raise $1.5 million with this offering. The Vulcans officially secured the Birmingham franchise in April 1975. When the WFL folded for good 12 games into the ill-fated 1975 season, the Vulcans had the best record.

===Legal pursuits===
Kenny Stabler was not the only NFL player that the Americans signed to contracts but who never played for the WFL team. Detroit Lions wide receiver Ron Jessie was paid a $45,000 signing bonus in early 1974, to begin playing for the Americans in the 1975 season after completing his option year with the Lions. Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Jethro Pugh and offensive tackle Rayfield Wright each received a $75,000 signing bonus, with Pugh set to start playing for the Americans in 1976 and Wright in 1977. Pittsburgh Steelers defensive end L. C. Greenwood received a $50,000 signing bonus to play from 1975. However, when the team folded both the WFL commissioner and a federal judge ruled that the player contracts had all been voided. These players remained in the NFL, playing neither for the Americans nor the successor Birmingham Vulcans team. Bill Putnam and his Alabama Football, Inc., still the legal owners of what little remained of the Americans&#x27; assets, made headlines through the late 1970s when he sued these NFL players claiming &quot;breach of contract&quot; to recover the signing bonus money. The players were ultimately able to keep the money after the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in their favor.

==Legacy==
Financially devastated, former Americans team president Carol Stallworth became a bartender in a downtown Birmingham sports bar in early 1975. Most of the former Americans players signed on with the Birmingham Vulcans for the 1975 WFL season. Notable exceptions included star players Charley Harraway, Alfred Jenkins, Paul Robinson, and veteran quarterback George Mira. The Birmingham Bulls of the World Hockey Association held &quot;Jack Gotta Night&quot; on December 26, 1976, in honor of the former Americans head coach.

By July 1976, Americans owner Bill Putnam was working to buy a World Hockey Association franchise and relocate it to Hollywood, Florida, as the &quot;Florida Breakers&quot;. The team was planned to start play in October 1976 with the Hollywood Sportatorium as its home ice. In August 1976, Putnam announced that his plan had &quot;collapsed&quot; but he would continue his attempts to bring a hockey franchise to south Florida.

Fans of the team organized a reunion celebration held July 9–10, 2004, in honor of the 30th anniversary of the Americans&#x27; first game played on July 10, 1974, against the Southern California Sun. One reason for the festivities was to help pay for the promised World Bowl championship rings that many players did not receive from the financial failing franchise. &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; sportswriter Chick Ludwig discovered the omission while doing research for a book. He used his investigative skills to find that Jonsil Manufacturing in El Paso, Texas, made the original rings and could create replacement rings for $809 each. The story received national attention which prompted Nestlé and the AF2 Birmingham Steeldogs to help sponsor the reunion at the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in Birmingham.

, three former Birmingham Americans players have been inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. Muscle Shoals native Dennis Homan, who also played in Super Bowl V for the Dallas Cowboys, was inducted in the Class of 1999. Oxford native Terry Henley, who also played pro football for the Atlanta Falcons, Washington Redskins, and New England Patriots, was inducted in the Class of 2000. Cullman native Larry Willingham, who played for the St. Louis Cardinals and retired for medical reasons in 1973 but made a comeback in 1974 with the Americans, was inducted in the Class of 2003. Willingham and Henley were also elected to the Auburn Tigers football &quot;1970s Team of the Decade&quot;.

<text>Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (; 8 September 685 – 3 May 762), personal name Li Longji, was an emperor of the Tang dynasty of China, reigning from 712 to 756. His reign of 44 years was the longest during the Tang dynasty. Through two palace coups, he seized the throne and inherited an empire still in its golden age. He was initially assisted by capable chancellors like Yao Chong, Song Jing and Zhang Yue who were already serving as government officials before Xuanzong ascended the throne. However, under Emperor Xuanzong, the empire reached its turning point and went into sharp decline and near collapse, due to numerous political missteps throughout his long reign, such as over-trusting Li Linfu, Yang Guozhong and An Lushan, with Tang&#x27;s golden age ending in the An Lushan rebellion.

==Background==

Li Longji was born at the Tang dynasty eastern capital Luoyang in 685, during the first reign of his father Emperor Ruizong (Li Dan) – but at that time, Emperor Ruizong&#x27;s mother Empress Dowager Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), not Emperor Ruizong, was in actual control of power as empress dowager and regent. Li Longji was the third son of Emperor Ruizong, and his mother was Emperor Ruizong&#x27;s concubine Consort Dou, who was highly ranked in the bureaucracy. In 687, as the emperor&#x27;s son, he was created the Prince of Chu. It was said that he was handsome, with an appearance that was &quot;majestic and beautiful&quot;, and was talented in music. He had two older brothers – Li Chengqi, born of Emperor Ruizong&#x27;s wife Empress Liu, and Li Chengyi (), as well as three younger brothers – Li Longfan (), Li Longye (), and Li Longti (). He had two full younger sisters, Princess Jinxian () and Princess Yuzhen (), who later became Taoist nuns.

==During Wu Zetian&#x27;s reign==
In 690, Empress Dowager Wu had her son Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her, and she took the throne as empress regnant of a new Zhou dynasty, interrupting Tang. She imposed upon Ruizong and his family the surname Wu () to match hers. In 692, Li Longji and his brothers were allowed to have residences outside the palace and were given staffs at their mansions. In 693, both his mother Consort Dou and Li Dan&#x27;s wife Crown Princess Liu (Li Dan&#x27;s having been reduced to crown prince rank at that point) were killed by Wu Zetian inside the palace after Wu Zetian&#x27;s lady-in-waiting Wei Tuan&#x27;er () falsely accused them of using witchcraft against Wu Zetian – and not even their bodies were recovered. Subsequently, all of Li Dan&#x27;s sons were reduced in title, and Li Longji&#x27;s title was reduced to Prince of Linzi. He and his brothers, along with their cousins Li Guangshun () the Prince of Yifeng, Li Shouli the Prince of Yong, and Li Shouyi () the Prince of Yong&#x27;an (the sons of their uncle Li Xián, formerly crown prince but who had been forced by Wu Zetian to commit suicide in 684), were kept inside the palace and not allowed to have contact with outsiders until 699, when they were allowed to leave the palace and take up residences outside.

==During Emperor Zhongzong&#x27;s second reign: under Empress Wei&#x27;s shadow==
In 705, Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup, and Li Longji&#x27;s uncle Li Xiǎn (note different person than the father of Li Guangshun, Li Shouli, and Li Shouyi), who was at that time crown prince (Li Dan having yielded that title to him in 698 and taken the title of Prince of Xiang), who had been briefly emperor prior to Li Dan, returned to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong). Li Longji was made the deputy minister of military supplies (衛尉少卿, &quot;Weiwei Shaoqing&quot;). In 708, he was made the secretary general of Lu Prefecture (潞州, roughly modern Changzhi, Shanxi). In 710, he was recalled to the capital Chang&#x27;an to attend to Emperor Zhongzong when Emperor Zhongzong was sacrificing to heaven and earth. Meanwhile, sorcerers engaged by Emperor Zhongzong believed that there was an aura of an emperor at the area of Chang&#x27;an where the mansions Li Longji and his uncles were, and Emperor Zhongzong tried to fulfill the vision by visiting Li Longji&#x27;s mansion and attending a feast there. While Li Longji was back in Chang&#x27;an, he spent time to cultivate relationships with imperial guard commanders, as he believed that Emperor Zhongzong&#x27;s powerful wife Empress Wei, who was in charge of government affairs, would bring harm to the Tang dynasty.

==Coup against Empress Dowager Wei==
In summer 710, Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly—a death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning by Empress Wei and her daughter Li Guo&#x27;er the Princess Anle so that Empress Wei could become &quot;emperor&quot; like Wu Zetian and Li Guo&#x27;er could become crown princess. For the time being, Emperor Zhongzong&#x27;s son by a concubine, Li Chongmao the Prince of Wen, was named emperor (as Emperor Shang), but Empress Wei retained actual power as empress dowager and regent. Originally, Empress Dowager Wei&#x27;s clan members, along with Zong, Li Guo&#x27;er&#x27;s husband Wu Yanxiu, and other officials Zhao Lüwen () and Ye Jingneng () were advising her to take the throne, like Wu Zetian did, and they also advised her to eliminate Li Dan and Princess Taiping. The official Cui Riyong leaked their plan to Li Longji. Li Longji responded by conspiring with Princess Taiping, Princess Taiping&#x27;s son Xue Chongjian (), as well as several low-level officials close to him—Zhong Shaojing, Wang Chongye (), Liu Youqiu, and Ma Sizong ()—to act first. Meanwhile, Empress Wei&#x27;s nephews Wei Bo () and Gao Song (), who had recently been put in command of imperial guards and who had tried to establish their authority by dealing with the guards harshly, had alienated the guards, and the guard officers Ge Fushun (), Chen Xuanli (), and Li Xianfu () thereafter also joined the plot.

Without first informing Li Dan, the conspirators enacted their plan on 21 July 710, first killing Wei Bo, Gao, and Empress Wei&#x27;s cousin Wei Gui (). They then began their attack on the palace, causing Empress Dowager Wei to flee to an imperial guard camp, where a guard beheaded her. Li Guo&#x27;er, Wu Yanxiu, and Lady Helou were killed as well. Li Longji soon slaughtered a number of officials in Empress Dowager&#x27;s faction as well as her clan, while displaying Empress Dowager Wei&#x27;s body on the street. At the urging of Princess Taiping, Li Longji, and Li Longji&#x27;s brother Li Chengqi, Li Dan soon took the throne from Li Chongmao and again became emperor (as Emperor Ruizong).

==During Emperor Ruizong&#x27;s second reign: under Princess Taiping&#x27;s shadow==

Emperor Ruizong once again ascended to the throne, which is different from the first time he was a puppet. This time he truly mastered the power and quickly used it handily. Emperor Ruizong was immediately faced with the issue of whom to make crown prince—as Li Chengqi, as the oldest son overall and the oldest son of his wife, was the appropriate heir under Confucian principles of succession, but Li Longji had been the one whose accomplishments had allowed him to retake the throne. He hesitated. Li Chengqi declined consideration to be crown prince—stating to his father:

Li Chengqi wept and begged to yield for several days, and after further persuasion by the chancellor Liu Youqiu—who had been part of Li Longji&#x27;s coup plans—Emperor Ruizong agreed and created Li Longji crown prince. Li Longji submitted a petition offering to yield to Li Chengqi, but Emperor Ruizong rejected it. After he came to the throne, whenever the chancellors and officials discussed political affairs with him, the first sentence he asked was: &quot;Have you ever discussed with Princess Taiping? &quot;If the answer is yes, he will continue to ask: &quot;Have you ever discussed with Li Longji?&quot; If both people have clear opinions, he will make a decision based on this, as a result, he relies heavily on Princess Taiping and Li Longji. Because of his achievements, having the crown prince title and the emperor&#x27;s trust, Li Longji was active and powerful in the politics of Emperor Ruizong&#x27;s reign, but, also, whenever Emperor Ruizong called a court meeting, Princess Taiping would listen to the courtiers&#x27; conversations with the emperor about the government behind a pearl curtain and had the government under her hands.

Under her ample reputation in the previous reigns, her great achievements in two coups, the trust of Emperor Ruizong&#x27;s, the vast privileges, attention, independence and wealth that Emperor Ruizong bestowed on her, and having countless allies, Princess Taiping has decision-making power on many serious events in the court and the country matters and was so powerful that she even surpassed Emperor Ruizong. She could often decide the promotion or demotion, deportation or summons of officials with a single sentence, and if the subject was undecided, it was changed or determined by a sentence from her, so most chancellors, forbidden troops, civil and military officials, regional warlords and senior servants of the Imperial palace were her associates. Initially, Princess Taiping agreed to Li Longji&#x27;s ascension as crown prince despite the fact that Li Longji was not Emperor Ruizong&#x27;s oldest son and was not born of Emperor Ruizong&#x27;s wife Empress Liu (Li Chengqi was both—and therefore pursuant to Confucian principles of succession should have been crown prince) as she believed that Li Longji was young (25 at the time he was made crown prince) and would be easy to control. However, once she began to see that Li Longji was strong-willed and criticized her influences, she became apprehensive and often had officials close to her publicly opine that Li Longji was an improper crown prince. She even spread rumors throughout the empire and tried to cause discontent among the common people, saying: Li Longji is not the eldest son of the emperor, so he should not become the crown prince. She further often paid Li Longji&#x27;s staff members to spy on him to try to find faults with him. She associated with a group of officials, including the chancellors Dou Huaizhen, Xiao Zhizhong, and Cen Xi, intending to find some way to remove Li Longji, but was unable to get two other chancellors—Wei Anshi and Song Jing—to join her group. When Princess Taiping tried to depose Li Longji in two actions, one with Emperor Ruizong himself and another time by summoning the chancellors at Xuanwu Gate and publicly accusing Li Longji of treason or incompetence, but it did not achieve the desired result.

In 711, Song and another chancellor, Yao Yuanzhi, tried to persuade Emperor Ruizong to carry out a plan that they believed would end her plotting and influence. They proposed that the two princes who arguably had superior claims on the throne than Li Longji—Li Chengqi and Li Shouli (whose father Li Xian (note different character than Emperor Zhongzong) was an older brother to both Emperors Zhongzong and Ruizong)—be sent out of the capital Chang&#x27;an to serve as prefectural prefects, while Princess Taiping and Wu Youji be sent to live in Luoyang. They also proposed that Li Longji be put in charge of most affairs of state. Emperor Ruizong initially agreed and made the orders as Song and Yao suggested, except that he believed that Luoyang was too far and therefore sent Princess Taiping and Wu Youji only to Pu Prefecture (蒲州, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). After Princess Taiping found out that the plan was conceived by Song and Yao, however, she was incensed and let Li Longji know her anger, and she mobilized her group to attack Song and Yao and oppose Emperor Ruizong&#x27;s decision. In fear, Li Longji submitted a petition accusing Song and Yao of alienating him from his brothers Li Chengqi and Li Shouli (who was actually a cousin but was raised with Emperor Ruizong&#x27;s sons) and aunt Princess Taiping, asking that the two be put to death. Emperor Ruizong, in response, demoted Song and Yao and recalled Princess Taiping, Li Chengqi, and Li Shouli to the capital. In the aftermaths, Li Longji submitted another request to yield the crown prince position to Li Chengqi, but Emperor Ruizong declined it. Also in 711, Emperor Ruizong posthumously honored both Empress Liu and Li Longji&#x27;s mother Consort Dou as empresses and built a temple for them to be worshipped, but was unable to locate their bodies for reburial, and therefore had to give them a ceremonial reburial without the bodies. But this posthumous honor for Li Longji&#x27;s mother further displeased Princess Taiping. Emperor Ruizong also ordered that all minor matters be decided by Li Longji, and with this, Emperor Ruizong established Li Longji as his sole successor, but diverted his participation in important matters and focused more on the advice of his sister, Princess Taiping.

By winter 711 Princess Taiping had become even more powerful than before. Because of her recommendations, Emperor Ruizong carried out a major reorganization of his administration, relieving the chancellors Wei, Guo Yuanzhen, Dou, Li Rizhi, and Zhang Yue of their chancellor positions, instead commissioning a number of chancellors that she recommended — Liu Youqiu, Wei Zhigu, Cui Shi, and Lu Xiangxian. (Cui was a lover of Princess Taiping, and when she offered to recommend him as chancellor, because he admired Lu, he requested to be made chancellor along with Lu, even though Lu was not an associate of Princess Taiping. It was said that Emperor Ruizong, however, was initially unwilling to make Cui chancellor, but relented after Princess Taiping begged in tears, although the account may be somewhat discountable in that neither Liu nor Wei was an associate of Princess Taiping either, and both were close associates of Li Longji.)

In 712, Princess Taiping had astrologers warn Emperor Ruizong that the constellation that symbolized the imperial throne, &quot;Dizuo&quot; (), showed that there would be a change in the emperor&#x27;s position—believing that Emperor Ruizong would suspect Li Longji of plotting a coup and that she could remove Li Longji this way. Instead, Emperor Ruizong, reasoning that the change in the emperor&#x27;s position could be accounted by an orderly transition, offered to pass the throne to Li Longji. Princess Taiping fervently opposed it, and Li Longji initially declined, but at Emperor Ruizong&#x27;s insistence finally accepted and took the throne on 8 September (as Emperor Xuanzong). However, at Princess Taiping&#x27;s suggestion, Emperor Ruizong retained much of the imperial power as &quot;Taishang Huang&quot; (retired emperor), and his edicts continued to carry greater force than Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s.

==As emperor==

===&quot;Xiantian&quot; era (712–713)===
Emperor Xuanzong made his wife Crown Princess Wang empress. Meanwhile, Princess Taiping continued to be listening to politics with curtains in the court, highly extremely influential in governmental matters through Emperor Ruizong, the group of chancellors openly frequented her house and most chancellors, forbidden troops, officials and warlords were her associates. (Of the seven chancellors at the time, five – Dou Huaizhen, Xiao Zhizhong, Cen Xi, Cui Shi, and Lu Xiangxian – were made chancellors at her recommendation, although Lu was not considered a member of her party.) As a result, the war between her and him continued more seriously. Liu Youqiu and the general Zhang Wei (), with Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s approval, planned to mobilize the imperial guards to kill several of those chancellors – Dou Huaizhen, Cui Shi and Cen Xi. However, after Zhang told the plan to the imperial censor Deng Guangbin (), the news was leaked. At the request of Princess Taiping&#x27;s, Emperor Ruizong issued an order to arrested Liu, and initially set to be executed. But Emperor Xuanzong interceded on his behalf with Emperor Ruizong, and Liu, Zhang, and Deng were spared but exiled.

Later in 712, in one of Princess Taiping&#x27;s plans to oust him, at her request, Emperor Ruizong decreed that Emperor Xuanzong lead a group of soldiers to examine the northern border. However, the group of conscripted soldiers was disbanded in spring 713, and the plan was never carried out.

By summer 713, it was said that Princess Taiping, Dou, Cen, Xiao, Cui; along with other officials Xue Ji, Li Jin () the Prince of Xinxing (a grandson of Li Deliang (), a cousin of Tang&#x27;s founder Emperor Gaozu), Li You (), Jia Yingfu (), Tang Jun (); the generals Chang Yuankai (), Li Ci (), and Li Qin (); and the monk Huifan, were plotting to overthrow Emperor Xuanzong. It was further said that they discussed, with the lady-in-waiting Lady Yuan, to poison the &quot;gastrodia elata&quot; that Emperor Xuanzong routinely took as an aphrodisiac. When this alleged plot was reported to Emperor Xuanzong by Wei Zhigu, Emperor Xuanzong, who had already received advice from Wang Ju (), Zhang Shuo, and Cui Riyong to act first, did so. He convened a meeting with his brothers Li Longfan the Prince of Qi and Li Longye the Prince of Xue (who had changed their names to Li Fan and Li Ye by this point to observe naming taboo for Emperor Xuanzong), Guo Yuanzhen, along with a number of his associates – the general Wang Maozhong (), the officials Jiang Jiao () and Li Lingwen (), his brother-in-law Wang Shouyi (), the eunuch Gao Lishi, and the military officer Li Shoude ()and decided to act first. On 29 July, Emperor Xuanzong had Wang Maozhong take 300 soldiers to the imperial guard camp to behead Chang and Li Ci. Then, Jia, Li You, Xiao, and Cen were arrested and executed as well. Dou fled into a canyon and committed suicide by hanging. Xue Ji was forced to commit suicide. When Emperor Ruizong heard about this, he quickly ascended the tower at Chengtian Gate () to ascertain what was happening. Guo reported to him Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s intentions, and Emperor Ruizong felt compelled to affirm Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s actions in an edict. The next day, on 30 July, Emperor Ruizong issued an edict transferring all authorities to Emperor Xuanzong. Meanwhile, Princess Taiping, hearing what happened to her associates, fled into a temple in the mountains, only appearing three days later. Emperor Ruizong asked Emperor Xuanzong for her pardon, but he refused. Emperor Xuanzong ordered her to commit suicide at home, and put to death her sons and associates, except for Xue Chongjian. Princess Taiping&#x27;s assets were confiscated, and it was said that there was so much treasure, livestock, and real estate that it took several years: more than thirty years for the accounting to be complete. Emperor Ruizong moved to a secondary palace, Baifu Hall () and would remain there until his death in 716.

===&quot;Kaiyuan&quot; era (713–741)===
Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s &quot;Kaiyuan&quot; era is usually viewed as one of the golden ages of Chinese history – a period of political stability, peace in society, and economic prosperity, in addition to advances in education, literature, music, painting, sculpture, and religion.

====Early &quot;Kaiyuan&quot; era====

Meanwhile, Zhang Yue and Liu Youqiu served as chancellors, but they were soon displaced by Yao Yuanzhi (who then changed his name to Yao Chong) and Lu Huaishen. Changing the system of having a large group of chancellors simultaneous, as had been the case throughout Tang, Emperor Xuanzong reduced the numbers to two (or sometimes three) for the rest of his reign. Yao was considered a highly capable administrator, and with him ruling on most important matters and Lu assisting, the government was said to be highly efficient.

In 714, Emperor Xuanzong carried out a series of political reprisals against the cruel secret police officials of Wu Zetian&#x27;s reign, exiling the ones that were still alive and eventually barring their descendants from holding political offices. At the urging of Jiang Jiao&#x27;s brother Jiang Hui (), he also exiled a number of chancellors – Wei Sili, Wei Anshi, Zhao Yanzhao, and Li Jiao – from Emperor Zhongzong&#x27;s reign whom Jiang accused of being unable to curb Empress Wei&#x27;s abuse of power.

Also in 714, Emperor Xuanzong, wanting to punish the Khitan and the Xi for having defeated Tang forces during Emperor Zhongzong&#x27;s reign, commissioned the general Xue Ne to attack them, but Xue suffered another devastating loss to them, at the casualty rate of 80–90%. However, later in the year, when the Tibetan Empire attacked, Emperor Xuanzong again commissioned Xue to defend against the attack, and Xue was able to repel the Tibetan forces. Subsequently, though, although both sides tried to invoke the marriage between Li Shouli&#x27;s daughter Princess Jincheng and Me Agtsom, emperor of the Tibetan Empire, in seeking peace, the two sides could not reach an agreement and remained in border conflict yearly. In response, Emperor Xuanzong established the office of &quot;jiedushi&quot; (military governor) of Longyou Circuit (, headquartered in what is now Haidong, Qinghai), with a centralized command of 12 prefectures under a single military general. Eventually, the establishment of &quot;jiedushi&quot; would be extended to other parts of the empire.

Also in 714, Emperor Xuanzong created Li Siqian, his second son and the son of his then-favorite concubine Consort Zhao, crown prince. (Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s wife Empress Wang was sonless.)

Meanwhile, the Tang relationship with Qapaghan Qaghan of the Göktürks had fluctuated during the first few years of the &quot;Kaiyuan&quot; era, as minor hostilities occurred at the borders as well as contests over vassals&#x27; loyalty for the two states, but they were also at times friendly to each other, with Qapaghan requesting at times to marry a Tang princess and Emperor Xuanzong agreeing to the proposal. In 716, however, Qapaghan was killed in battle against the Bayegu (), and from that point on, lacking his efficient leadership, the Göktürks, while remaining an important regional power, posed much less of a threat to China, although at times still capable of dealing serious defeats to Tang forces, as was the case in 720 when the Göktürk general Tonyukuk defeated the Tang garrison at Liang Prefecture (涼州, roughly modern Wuwei, Gansu) and the Tang vassal Basmyl. Meanwhile, Tang, the Tibetan Empire, and the Umayyad Caliphate were constantly engaging in a three-way tug of war for influence in the Xiyu (i.e., modern Xinjiang and former Soviet Central Asia) region. In 715, for example, when the king of Bahanna () was expelled by a new king supported by the Tibetan Empire and the Umayyad Caliphate, Tang forces commanded by the general () attacked the new king and restored the old king. General Tang Jiahui led the Chinese to defeat the following Arab-Tibetan attack in the Battle of Aksu (717). The attack on Aksu was joined by Turgesh Khan Suluk. Both Uch Turfan and Aksu were attacked by the Turgesh, Arab, and Tibetan force on 15 August 717. Qarluqs serving under Chinese command, under Arsila Xian, a Western Turkic Qaghan serving under the Chinese Assistant Grand Protector General Tang Jiahui defeated the attack. Al-Yashkuri, the Arab commander and his army fled to Tashkent after they were defeated.

In and around 716, there was a major locust infestation in the central China region. At Yao&#x27;s suggestion, Emperor Xuanzong ordered an extensive campaign of extermination, which was said to reduce the impact of the infestation and ward off a major famine. Later in 716, however, due a corruption scandal involving Yao&#x27;s sons and his associate Zhao Hui (), Yao incurred displeasure from Emperor Xuanzong and offered to resign. He and Yuan Qianyao, who replaced Lu after Lu&#x27;s death earlier in 716, were removed from their offices and replaced with Song Jing and Su Ting, with Song making more of the important decisions and Su assisting. Yao would not return to the chancellorship, but would remain influential as a key advisor for Emperor Xuanzong until Yao&#x27;s death in 721. Contrary to the practical and flexible Yao, Song was more interested in emphasizing integrity and rule of law in governance, and it was said that while Yao&#x27;s and Song&#x27;s emphases were different, they were both regarded as instrumental in establishing the rule of &quot;Kaiyuan&quot; and that subsequent chancellors could not compare to them.

Meanwhile, Song and Su had carried out a stern campaign against the use of coins that were not officially forged by the government, which brought popular resentment that Emperor Xuanzong found problematic. In 720, he removed Song and Su from chancellor offices and replaced them with Yuan and Zhang Jiazhen, and in 721 added Zhang Yue as a chancellor as well.

Meanwhile, by 722, Empress Wang, who had contributed to Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s reign by providing suggestions, had begun to lose favor to Consort Wu, a great-grandniece of Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s grandmother Wu Zetian. Emperor Xuanzong secretly discussed with Jiang Jiao the possibility of deposing her, but Jiang Jiao careless leaked the discussion. At the urging of Zhang Jiazhen, who was friendly with Empress Wang&#x27;s brother Wang Shouyi (), advocated that Jiang Jiao be punished and exiled, and Jiang died in exile.

Meanwhile, at Zhang Yue&#x27;s suggestion, the Tang northern border defense forces, which had about 600,000 men at that time, was reduced by 200,000 men to allow the soldiers to return home. Further, seeing that the Tang conscription system, due to abuses against the soldiers at the time, was near a collapse, as the soldiers were forced into long tours of duty but their families were not exempt from taxes, thus causing great numbers of desertions, Zhang suggested a switch to a recruitment-based system where soldiers were paid salaries. This allowed, for a time, Tang&#x27;s soldier supply to be replenished. (Some later historians condemned Zhang for the abolition of the conscription system, believing the abolition to be the root of Tang&#x27;s later fracturing, but some others, such as the modern historian Bo Yang, argued that Zhang&#x27;s actions not only were necessary to restore the supply of soldiers but saved many lives.)

====Middle &quot;Kaiyuan&quot; era====

In 723, Zhang Jiazhen was demoted on account of a corruption scandal involving his brother Zhang Jiayou (). His position was filled by Wang Jun, who was soon himself demoted over suspicions, never proven, that he was plotting treason. With Zhang Yue thus effectively being the senior chancellor, Zhang Yue promoted literary studies, which Emperor Xuanzong also favored. In 724, he also commissioned the chief imperial astronomer Nangong Shuo () to carry out a major astronomical survey to observe the sun and the North Star at various points of the empire.

Also in 724, it was discovered that Wang Shouyi had engaged sorcerers to make amulets for Empress Wang to wear, hoping that the use of magic would allow her to have a son. Empress Wang was deposed and reduced to commoner rank, while Wang Shouyi was exiled and subsequently ordered to commit suicide in exile. Empress Wang died later in the year, and it was said that the eunuchs and the ladies in waiting mourned her bitterly and Emperor Xuanzong much regretted his treatment of her. Still, after Empress Wang&#x27;s removal and death, Consort Wu became undisputed mistress of the palace and was treated inside the palace like an empress would be. Still, in 726, when Emperor Xuanzong considered creating her empress, he encountered oppositions from officials on two grounds – that her Wu clan was hated by the people and that as she had her own sons, the position of Li Siqian the Crown Prince (whose name had been changed to Li Hong by this point) would be threatened. As a result, Emperor Xuanzong never created her empress. But Consort Wu&#x27;s was a chief favorite of the emperor and undisputed mistress of the palace until her death and had political power.

In winter 725, Emperor Xuanzong, at Zhang Yue&#x27;s urging, carried out a magnificent ceremony at Mount Tai to offer sacrifices to heaven and earth.

On 11 May 726, Zhang Yue was accused of corruption by several officials that he had blocked the advances of – Cui Yinfu (), Yuwen Rong, and Li Linfu – and was found to have committed corruption. At the intercession of Gao Lishi, however, Zhang Yue was removed only from his chancellor post on 18 May and permitted to maintain his title and a number of other posts. He was replaced by Li Yuanhong on 15 May, and subsequently, Du Xian was also added as a chancellor.

In 727, at the suggestion of the general Wang Junchuo (王君㚟), Emperor Xuanzong commissioned Wang Junchuo to attack the Tibetan Empire, and after a Tibetan incursion in late 726, Wang counterattacked and inflicted losses on Tibetan forces commanded by the general Xinuoluogonglu (). Later in the year, though, Xinuoluogonglu and another general, Zhulongmangbuzhi () attacked and captured Wang&#x27;s home prefecture Gua Prefecture (瓜州, roughly modern Jiuquan, Gansu), taking Wang&#x27;s father Wang Shou () captive. As a result, Wang Junchuo did not dare to counterattack, and subsequently blamed the defeat on a number of tribal chiefs in the area and had them exiles. In response, Yaoluoge Hushu (), the nephew of one of the chiefs so exiled, Yaoluoge Chengzong (), ambushed Wang Junchuo and killed him, and while Yaoluoge Hushu was forced to flee thereafter, for several years Tang did not engage in any offensive campaigns in the region.

Around the same time, Emperor Xuanzong began to build a residential complex in the palace for imperial clan members, known as the Mansion of the Ten Princes (), to centralize their residence. Thereafter, imperial princes, including the crown prince, would rarely live outside the palace complex.

On 6 December 728, Emperor Xuanzong added the general Xiao Song as a chancellor. Subsequently, in 729, with Yuan, even though he was senior chancellor, unable to curb the disputes between Li Yuanhong and Du, Emperor Xuanzong removed all three from chancellor positions, promoting Yuwen and Pei Guangting to be chancellors in their stead – in Yuwen&#x27;s case, for his abilities to find ways to add to the imperial treasury by imposing special taxes and levies. Later in the year, though, Yuwen made false accusations against the general Li Hui () the Prince of Xin&#x27;an (Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s second cousin) and was exiled, and subsequently died in exile. Still, it was said that it was starting from Yuwen&#x27;s times that Emperor Xuanzong began to pay attention on taxes to replenish the imperial treasury, which traditional historians viewed as the start of his inflicting financial burdens on the people. Further, with Pei in charge of the civil service system, it was said that due to Pei&#x27;s strict adherence to seniority, the Tang civil service system began to lose its ability to find talented people to serve in offices.

In 730, the Khitan general Ketugan () killed the king Li Shaogu () and took over the reign of the Khitan and the Xi personally, forcing the king of the Xi, Li Lusu () to flee to Tang for protection. Tang sent an army to attack the Khitan, but meanwhile made peace with the Tibetan Empire. Initially, the campaign against the Khitan did not succeed, but in 732, with Li Hui in command, Tang forces dealt Ketugan a serious defeat and causing many of Ketugan&#x27;s subordinates to defect and submit to Tang, although Ketugan was not captured.

====Late &quot;Kaiyuan&quot; era====

Meanwhile, Tang also began to have periodic conflicts with Balhae, and in 733 Emperor Xuanzong tried to commission Dae Mun-ye (), the brother of Balhae&#x27;s King Mu, to attack Balhae, along with forces from Silla, but the attack was not successful.

Also in 733, Pei Guangting died, and at the recommendation of Xiao Song, he was replaced with Han Xiu, but soon, Song and Han were in repeated conflicts, and late in 733, both were removed and replaced with Pei Yaoqing, who became known for improving the food distribution system, and Zhang Jiuling, known for his integrity. In 734, Emperor Xuanzong added Li Linfu, a close associate of Consort Wu, as a chancellor as well.

Around the new year 735, Ketuhan was killed in an internal Khitan power struggle, and Khitan became a vassal again, although it would not stay so permanently.

By 736, Emperor Xuanzong was described as having been tired of important affairs of state and beginning to become wasteful and exuberant in his lifestyle. Zhang tried to curb his behavior but thus began to lose favor, while Li Linfu was gaining power due to his association with Consort Wu. Further, Zhang supported Li Hong (whose name had been changed to Li Ying by this point), while Li Linfu and Consort Wu supported her son Li Mao () the Prince of Shou and tried to have Li Mao made crown prince. In 736, due to Li Linfu&#x27;s machinations that made Emperor Xuanzong believed that Zhang and Pei Yaoqing were improperly engaging in factionalism, Zhang and Pei Yaoqing were removed and replaced by Niu Xianke, who closely followed Li Linfu&#x27;s will, and thereafter, Li Linfu would dominate the imperial government almost to the end of Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s reign. Li Linfu did all he could to stay in power, and carried out many dirty tricks against actual or potential threats to his power. He also severely discouraged criticism, ending the relative freedom that officials had to make proposals to Emperor Xuanzong. This was often viewed by traditional historians as the turning point of Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s reign, which up to that point was considered a golden age in Chinese history, toward a path of degeneration. The Song dynasty historian Sima Guang, in his &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, for example, commented:

In 737, with Zhang no longer in the government to protect him, Li Ying was deposed and subsequently forced to commit suicide. However, with Consort Wu dying later in the year, Emperor Xuanzong did not immediately accept Li Linfu&#x27;s proposal to have Li Mao made crown prince. Rather, he chose an older son, Li Yu the Prince of Zhong, in 738.

===&quot;Tianbao&quot; era (742–756)===

Historians said that Emperor Xuanzong forced tens of thousands of beautiful women to live in his palace to please him, more than many other Tang emperors. And he did not allow many to be set free even when they were old. As Emperor Xuanzong turned his attention to pleasure-seeking with his favorite concubine Yang Guifei and her family, he paid less and less attention to the running of his empire, and much of his power fell into the hands of the corrupt Li Linfu (who was succeeded by Lady Yang&#x27;s dissolute cousin Yang Guozhong) and the eunuch Gao Lishi.

At the same time, 751 saw the loss of the Battle of Talas against the Abbasid Caliphate. As a consequence, the Tang dynasty temporarily lost some of its influence in Central Asia to the emerging Abbasid Caliphate, as several Tang tributaries turned to the Abbasids.

Meanwhile, the &quot;jiedushi&quot; (military governors), most of whom were non-Han took more and more regional power into their own hands. Some successful generals included Geshu Han, known for victories over the Tibetan Empire; Gao Xianzhi, who conquered city states of the Xiyu region, eventually battling the Abbasids at Talas; and An Lushan who defeated and once again vassalized the Khitan. Eventually, in 755, An Lushan started the Anshi Rebellion at Fanyang. The rebels quickly seized the eastern capital Luoyang, and then the imperial capital Chang&#x27;an six months later. Emperor Xuanzong fled to Sichuan during the war and abdicated the throne to Li Yu (whose name had been changed to Li Heng at that point) (as Emperor Suzong).

====Early &quot;Tianbao&quot; era====
Meanwhile, at Li Linfu&#x27;s encouragement, Emperor Xuanzong began to promote non-Han generals to command large border armies, believing Li Linfu&#x27;s assertion that non-Han generals were more likely to be personally loyal to Emperor Xuanzong himself and would not have clan entanglements, even though Li Linfu&#x27;s own personal motivation was to prevent Han officials from going through the border command route to become chancellors, thus threatening him. Such generals who rose in ranks included An Lushan, An Sishun, Geshu Han, and Gao Xianzhi. By 742, the main Tang forces were all concentrated on the border, at nine different military circuits and one special military district (Lingnan), as well as three special coast defense districts (Changle, Donglai, and Dongmou):

Meanwhile, it was said that Emperor Xuanzong had paid less attention to increasing revenues after Yuwen Rong&#x27;s fall, but by 742 he was again interested in doing so, and such officials as Wei Jian (韋堅, a brother-in-law of Li Yu, whose name was changed by this point to Li Heng), Wang Hong (), and Yang Shenjin () became favored, and often, matters having to do with finances were stripped out of other officials&#x27; responsibilities and given to them as special commissions.

Late in 742, Niu Xianke died and was replaced by Li Shizhi.

In 744, Eastern Tujue, after a series of internal turmoil and rebellions from its vassals, finally collapsed. Its vassal Huige rose and became the dominant power of the region, but formally submitted to Tang as a vassal.
Meanwhile, after Consort Wu&#x27;s death, Emperor Xuanzong had been depressed. When he saw his son Prince of Shou Li Mao&#x27;s wife (his daughter-in-law) Yang Yuhuan (Princess of Shou, by virtue of marriage), he was infatuated with her, and he had her become a Taoist nun and gave Li Mao the wife of the general Wei Zhaoxun () as his new wife and princess. Meanwhile, he secretly took the nun, Yang, into the palace. She became his senior-ranking concubine (&quot;guifei&quot;), known as Yang Guifei, and soon became so powerful that officials were bribing her family members to get preferential treatment. She was referred to inside the palace as &quot;the Lady&quot; and treated like an empress (as was consort Wu until her death). He abducted more than 40000 women in his palace. Some were not set free even after they were over 60 years old.

Meanwhile, Li Linfu was beginning to conflict with Li Shizhi and Wei Jian, who were allies. Li Linfu, who engaged a group of secret police officials to investigate and manufacture evidence against political enemies, was able to get Wei and Li Shizhi demoted and exiled in 746. (Li Shizhi was replaced by Chen Xilie, who gained favor from Emperor Xuanzong for his knowledge in Taoism and sorcery.) In 747, Li Linfu further carried out a campaign of terror against exiled officials, and among the officials executed were Wei, Li Yong () and Pei Dunfu (). Li Shizhi and Wang Ju, who had been instrumental in Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s initial actions against Princess Taiping, committed suicide.

Meanwhile, in 747, Emperor Xuanzong wanted to expand the government&#x27;s talent pool, and so issued an edict ordering that the people who had unusual talents to come to Chang&#x27;an to be examined by himself. Li Linfu, fearing that these examinees might accuse him of improprieties when they get to meet the emperor, suggested that these examinees go through two levels of preliminary examinations – by the local governments, and then by the executive bureau. As a result, no one passed the first two levels of preliminary examinations, and Li Linfu subsequently submitted a note to Emperor Xuanzong congratulating him that no talent has been overlooked by the imperial administration.
Meanwhile, also as of 747, An Lushan had become greatly favored by Emperor Xuanzong due to his military achievements and his willingness to flatter Emperor Xuanzong, Consort Yang, and her family members. Further, Li Linfu, apprehensive about the general Wang Zhongsi, who at that time was in command of four circuits (Hexi, Longyou, Shuofang, and Hedong), deprecated Wang in favor of An Lushan. In 747, after Li Linfu implicated Wang in hindering a campaign against the Tibetan Empire and further accused Wang of plotting a coup to overthrow Emperor Xuanzong and replace him with Li Heng, Wang was arrested and demoted, escaping death only at the pleas of Geshu, who was Wang&#x27;s deputy and who subsequently was given the commands of Hexi and Longyou. An Lushan, who had already been in command of Fanyang and Pinglu Circuits, was also given Hedong, and thereafter was in command of the most elite troops of the empire. Meanwhile, the ethnically Goguryeo general Gao Xianzhi had become prominent in the Xiyu region, expanding Tang power to the west.

By 748, Consort Yang&#x27;s cousins Yang Guozhong, Yang Xian () and Yang Qi (), as well as her three sisters (who were created the Ladies of Han, Guo, and Qin), had become exceedingly wealthy and powerful due to the favors that Emperor Xuanzong showed them. It was said that their wealth topped all households in Chang&#x27;an. It was also said that by 749, the empire was so wealthy that Emperor Xuanzong viewed treasures as expendable and so awarded them without limit.

====Late &quot;Tianbao&quot; era====

Meanwhile, Li Linfu had a tight grip on power and favors from Emperor Xuanzong throughout the years, but as of 750, Yang Guozhong and Chen Xilie had allied with each other and were finding ways to eliminate Li Linfu&#x27;s allies from government.

As of 751, Tang was also facing defeats on two different external fronts – as Nanzhao&#x27;s king Geluofeng (), angry about unreasonable demands that the Zhang Qiantuo () the governor of Yunnan Commandery (雲南, roughly modern Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan) and Zhang&#x27;s subsequent false accusations that he was planning to rebel, rebelled for real, and attacked and occupied Yunnan Commandery. A major attack by the general Xianyu Zhongtong () against Nanzhao failed terribly in 751, and subsequent defeats by Tang forces eventually led to a total of some 200,000 casualties among Tang troops. On the western front, Gao Xianzhi suffered a major defeat at the Abbasid forces at the Battle of Talas in 751 as well, ending the Tang expansion to the west.

In 752, Wang Hong&#x27;s brother Wang Han () was accused of treason after his associates rose in a failed coup at Chang&#x27;an. In the aftermaths, Wang Hong was forced to commit suicide, and Yang Guozhong, Chen, and Geshu Han further tried to implicate Li Linfu in the plot as well. After Li Linfu died in winter 752, Yang Guozhong succeeded him, and almost immediately accused Li Linfu of having been complicit in the rebellion of another general, Li Xianzhong (). Li Linfu was posthumously disgraced, and his family was exiled.

A rivalry soon developed between Yang Guozhong and An Lushan, and Yang Guozhong began to repeatedly warn Emperor Xuanzong that An was plotting rebellion. Emperor Xuanzong ignored the warnings. In 754, Yang Guozhong suggested that if An were summoned to the capital, he would surely refuse, and Emperor Xuanzong decided to try An – and An arrived in Chang&#x27;an immediately after being summoned. After this incident, Emperor Xuanzong no longer believed that An was plotting rebellion. Nevertheless, because of Yang Guozhong&#x27;s opposition, he did not make An chancellor, as he was planning. Also in 754, with Yang Guozhong also trying to squeeze Chen out of the government, Chen resigned and was replaced by Wei Jiansu.
In 755, Yang Guozhong further provoked An, who was then back at his post in Fanyang, by surrounding An&#x27;s mansion at Chang&#x27;an and arresting and executing An&#x27;s staff members. An, in fear and anger, rebelled in winter 755, and quickly reached and captured Luoyang after defeating Feng Changqing&#x27;s undersupplied army. Subsequently, Emperor Xuanzong, believing in reports from the eunuch Bian Lingcheng () that Feng was cowardly and that Feng&#x27;s superior Gao Xianzhi was corrupt, executed both Feng and Gao and replaced Gao with Geshu in defending Tong Pass from An&#x27;s advances. An declared himself emperor of a new state of Yan at Luoyang, but with Geshu defending Tong Pass, An&#x27;s advances stalled, while Tang forces commanded by Li Guangbi and Guo Ziyi made advances against An-controlled territory north of the Yellow River. Meanwhile, though, Yang Guozhong, fearing that Geshu had designs against him, convinced Emperor Xuanzong to order Geshu to attack despite Geshu&#x27;s warnings that doing so was risky. Geshu was subsequently defeated by An&#x27;s forward commander Cui Qianyou (), and Tong Pass fell. With An&#x27;s forces advancing on Chang&#x27;an, on 14 July 756, Emperor Xuanzong, with Yang Guozhong suggesting that they flee to Jiannan Circuit, abandoned Chang&#x27;an and fled with Gao Lishi, Yang Guozhong, Wei, Li Heng, Consort Yang, and her family. The following day, 15 July, the imperial guards accompanying the emperor, angry at Yang Guozhong, rose and killed him and forced Emperor Xuanzong to kill Consort Yang as well. Subsequently, Emperor Xuanzong continued on to Jiannan, but Li Heng did not, but rather went to Lingwu, where, on 12 August, Li Heng was declared emperor (as Emperor Suzong). Meanwhile, without knowledge that Emperor Suzong had claimed the throne, Emperor Xuanzong, while still on his way to Chengdu, the capital of Jiannan Circuit, issued an edict that gave several of his sons various responsibility areas, under Li Heng&#x27;s command overall; until this edict was issued, most of the realm only knew that Chang&#x27;an had fallen and had not known where Emperor Xuanzong had fled. When the news of Emperor Suzong&#x27;s ascension reached Emperor Xuanzong at Chengdu on 10 September, he recognized Emperor Suzong as the new emperor, and thereafter took the title of &quot;Taishang Huang&quot; (retired emperor) – although his edict recognizing Emperor Suzong appeared to still indicate desire to retain control like his father Emperor Ruizong did early in his reign:

However, perhaps to avoid the impression that he was keeping a rival government to Emperor Suzong, he sent the several chancellors that he had retained or created while on the journey to or after he arrived in Chengdu – Wei, Fang Guan, and Cui Huan – to Lingwu to formally invest imperial power on Emperor Suzong and to serve under Emperor Suzong.

==As retired emperor==

Emperor Xuanzong, after becoming retired emperor, largely allowed Emperor Suzong to coordinate the campaign against Yan, but at times nevertheless stepped in to make decisions. For example, in spring 757, apparently without first consulting Emperor Suzong, he named Li Lin chancellor, although he subsequently sent both Li Lin and another chancellor, Cui Yuan, whom he had not sent to Emperor Suzong previously, to Emperor Suzong. He also posthumously honored Emperor Suzong&#x27;s mother Consort Yang (not Yang Yuhuan) as an empress. Meanwhile, remembering Zhang Jiuling had previously warned about An Lushan, Emperor Xuanzong sent messengers to Zhang&#x27;s tomb to offer sacrifices to him.

Late in 757, Emperor Suzong, with aid from Huige, recaptured Chang&#x27;an from Yan, then ruled by An Lushan&#x27;s son An Qingxu, who had killed An Lushan earlier in 757 and taken over the throne himself. After Emperor Suzong recaptured Chang&#x27;an, he sent messengers to Emperor Xuanzong requesting that he return to Chang&#x27;an and offering the throne back to Emperor Xuanzong. Emperor Xuanzong, apprehensive of the offer, initially not only declined but further requested to remain in Jiannan. Only after Emperor Suzong, at the suggestion of his strategist Li Mi, had the government officials make a joint submission to Emperor Xuanzong no longer mentioning the return of the throne, did Emperor Xuanzong agree to depart Jiannan to return to Chang&#x27;an. On the way back to Chang&#x27;an, he had Gao Lishi try to dig up Consort Yang Yuhuan&#x27;s body for reburial, but her body had already decomposed; only her fragrance bag remained. Emperor Xuanzong took the fragrance bag back to Chang&#x27;an and visited it daily, as if Consort Yang were still alive. On 17 January 758, he arrived at Chang&#x27;an, and in a grand ceremony where Emperor Suzong offered the throne back to him again, he formally declined again and personally put the yellow robe symbolizing imperial status on Emperor Suzong, commenting, &quot;I had been the Son of Heaven for 50 years, and I did not consider it a great honor. Now, I am truly honored to be the father to the Son of Heaven.&quot; He took up residence at Xingqing Palace, a palace that was remodelled from the residence that he and his brothers had when they were imperial princes.

After Emperor Xuanzong was back in Chang&#x27;an, he largely stayed out of policy decisions, although he at times still exerted his influence on Emperor Suzong. For example, Emperor Suzong had wanted to spare Zhang Shuo&#x27;s sons Zhang Jun () and Zhang Ji (), who had previously submitted to An Lushan, because of Zhang Shuo&#x27;s contributions and Zhang Jun&#x27;s and Zhang Ji&#x27;s prior efforts to protect him from Li Linfu&#x27;s machinations, but Emperor Xuanzong deeply hated them for having surrendered to An, and at Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s insistence, Zhang Jun was executed, and Zhang Ji was exiled to Lingnan.

Meanwhile, after a while, Emperor Xuanzong settled into a routine at Xingqing Palace, with Chen Xuanli and Gao Lishi attending to him. Also often attending to him were his daughter Li Chiying (), the Princess Yuzhen, the lady in waiting Ru Xianyuan (), and the eunuchs Wang Cheng&#x27;en () and Wei Yue (). The imperial musicians often played for him, and he often climbed up Changqing Tower () to receive well wishes from the populace. He also often held feasts for generals and people from Jiannan, with Li Chiying and Ru serving as hostesses. Meanwhile, though, Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s attendants looked down at the powerful eunuch Li Fuguo, who had served Emperor Suzong throughout the campaign against Yan. To retaliate, Li Fuguo began to try to convince Emperor Suzong that Emperor Xuanzong and his attendants were plotting to seize power back. In 760, with Emperor Suzong&#x27;s tacit, although not explicit, approval, on one occasion when Emperor Xuanzong was out riding, Li Fuguo intercepted him and forced him to move back to the main palace. Even on that occasion, however, Gao would not submit to Li Fuguo, and even yelled at Li Fuguo to force him to get off his horse and to escort Emperor Xuanzong on foot, along with Gao. Soon after Emperor Xuanzong was forcibly moved, Li Fuguo forced Chen to retire, Li Chiying to return to her temple (she had become an ordained Taoist nun in 711), and exiled Gao, Wang, Wei, and Ru.

After Emperor Xuanzong was forcibly moved back to the main palace, Emperor Suzong tried to please him by offering him the best of all of the tributes of the land first, but Emperor Xuanzong became depressed and rarely ate meat, and quickly became ill. Emperor Suzong had his daughters Princesses Wan&#x27;an and Xianyi attend to their grandfather, and initially frequently personally visited Emperor Xuanzong, but after some time became ill himself and could not visit Emperor Xuanzong. He began to regret forcibly moving Emperor Xuanzong and considered killing Li Fuguo, but as Li Fuguo wielded command of the imperial guards at this time, he did not dare to try to do so. Emperor Xuanzong died, in that depressed state, on 3 May 762.

Emperor Xuanzong was deeply criticized by later historians for his wastefulness and for his appointing of Li Linfu, Yang Guozhong, and An to prominent offices. The strength that Xuanzong had allowed the military governors to have, which was perpetuated after Tang had defeated Yan, led to a period of increasing conflict and instability which set the stage for the decline of the Tang dynasty and the ensuing Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period.

==Poetry==
Xuanzong had one poem collected in the famous poetry anthology &quot;Three Hundred Tang Poems&quot;, in the style of the five-character-regular-verse (&quot;wulu&quot;) form and in the &quot;huaigu&quot; genre, and which was translated by Witter Bynner as &quot;I Pass Through the Lu Dukedom with a Sigh and a Sacrifice for Confucius&quot;. This poem refers to the philosopher-sage Confucius and to Confucius&#x27; home state of Lu, during the by-then long-gone Spring and Autumn period, and expresses sadness for what is past and beyond recall, thus reflecting on the transience of mortal existence.

<text>Surgeon general (: surgeons general) is a title used in several Commonwealth countries and most NATO nations to refer either to a senior military medical officer or to a senior uniformed physician commissioned by the government and entrusted with public health responsibilities. The title originated in the 17th century, as military units acquired their own physicians.

In the United Kingdom, the Surgeon-General is the head of the military medical services. The post is held by the senior of the three individual service medical directors and carries the rank of vice admiral, lieutenant general, or air marshal.

In the United States, the chief public health officer is the Surgeon General of the United States, and a small number of states have state surgeons general. Moreover, three of the U.S. military services have their own surgeon general, namely the Surgeon General of the United States Army, Surgeon General of the United States Navy, and Surgeon General of the United States Air Force.

<doc id="637138" wikidata="Q17157202" url="?curid=637138" title="Transfer principle">
<text>In model theory, a transfer principle states that all statements of some language that are true for some structure are true for another structure. One of the first examples was the Lefschetz principle, which states that any sentence in the first-order language of fields that is true for the complex numbers is also true for any algebraically closed field of characteristic 0.

==History==
An incipient form of a transfer principle was described by Leibniz under the name of &quot;the Law of Continuity&quot;. Here infinitesimals are expected to have the &quot;same&quot; properties as appreciable numbers. The transfer principle can also be viewed as a rigorous formalization of the principle of permanence. Similar tendencies are found in Cauchy, who used infinitesimals to define both the continuity of functions (in Cours d&#x27;Analyse) and a form of the Dirac delta function.

In 1955, Jerzy Łoś proved the transfer principle for any hyperreal number system. Its most common use is in Abraham Robinson&#x27;s nonstandard analysis of the hyperreal numbers, where the transfer principle states that any sentence expressible in a certain formal language that is true of real numbers is also true of hyperreal numbers.

==Transfer principle for the hyperreals==

The transfer principle concerns the logical relation between the properties of the real numbers R, and the properties of a larger field denoted *R called the hyperreal numbers. The field *R includes, in particular, infinitesimal (&quot;infinitely small&quot;) numbers, providing a rigorous mathematical realisation of a project initiated by Leibniz.

The idea is to express analysis over R in a suitable language of mathematical logic, and then point out that this language applies equally well to *R. This turns out to be possible because at the set-theoretic level, the propositions in such a language are interpreted to apply only to internal sets rather than to all sets. As Robinson put it, &quot;the sentences of [the theory] are interpreted in *R in Henkin&#x27;s sense.&quot;

The theorem to the effect that each proposition valid over R, is also valid over *R, is called the transfer principle.

There are several different versions of the transfer principle, depending on what model of nonstandard mathematics is being used. 
In terms of model theory, the transfer principle states that a map from a standard model to a nonstandard model is an elementary embedding (an embedding preserving the truth values of all statements in a language), or sometimes a &quot;bounded&quot; elementary embedding (similar, but only for statements with bounded quantifiers).

The transfer principle appears to lead to contradictions if it is not handled correctly.
For example, since the hyperreal numbers form a non-Archimedean ordered field and the reals form an Archimedean ordered field, the property of being Archimedean (&quot;every positive real is larger than formula_1 for some positive integer formula_2&quot;) seems at first sight not to satisfy the transfer principle. The statement &quot;every positive hyperreal is larger than formula_1 for some positive integer formula_2&quot; is false; however the correct interpretation is &quot;every positive hyperreal is larger than formula_1 for some positive hyperinteger formula_2&quot;. In other words, the hyperreals appear to be Archimedean to an internal observer living in the nonstandard universe, but appear
to be non-Archimedean to an external observer outside the universe.

A freshman-level accessible formulation of the transfer principle is Keisler&#x27;s book &quot;Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach&quot;.

===Example===
Every real formula_7 satisfies the inequality
formula_8
where formula_9 is the integer part function. By a typical application of the transfer principle, every hyperreal formula_7 satisfies the inequality
formula_11
where formula_12 is the natural extension of the integer part function. If formula_7 is infinite, then the hyperinteger formula_14 is infinite, as well.

== Generalizations of the concept of number ==
Historically, the concept of number has been repeatedly generalized. The addition of 0 to the natural numbers formula_15 was a major intellectual accomplishment in its time. The addition of negative integers to form formula_16 already constituted a departure from the realm of immediate experience to the realm of mathematical models. The further extension, the rational numbers formula_17, is more familiar to a layperson than their completion formula_18, partly because the reals do not correspond to any physical reality (in the sense of measurement and computation) different from that represented by formula_17. Thus, the notion of an irrational number is meaningless to even the most powerful floating-point computer. The necessity for such an extension stems not from physical observation but rather from the internal requirements of mathematical coherence. The infinitesimals entered mathematical discourse at a time when such a notion was required by mathematical developments at the time, namely the emergence of what became known as the infinitesimal calculus. As already mentioned above, the mathematical justification for this latest extension was delayed by three centuries. Keisler wrote:
:&quot;In discussing the real line we remarked that we have no way of knowing what a line in physical space is really like. It might be like the hyperreal line, the real line, or neither. However, in applications of the calculus, it is helpful to imagine a line in physical space as a hyperreal line.&quot;

The self-consistent development of the hyperreals turned out to be possible if every true first-order logic statement that uses basic arithmetic (the natural numbers, plus, times, comparison) and quantifies only over the real numbers was assumed to be true in a reinterpreted form if we presume that it quantifies over hyperreal numbers. For example, we can state that for every real number there is another number greater than it:

: formula_20

The same will then also hold for hyperreals:

: formula_21

Another example is the statement that if you add 1 to a number you get a bigger number:

: formula_22

which will also hold for hyperreals:

: formula_23

The correct general statement that formulates these equivalences is called the transfer principle. Note that, in many formulas in analysis, quantification is over higher-order objects such as functions and sets, which makes the transfer principle somewhat more subtle than the above examples suggest.

== Differences between R and *R==

The transfer principle however doesn&#x27;t mean that R and *R have identical behavior. For instance, in *R there exists an element &quot;ω&quot; such that

: formula_24

but there is no such number in R. This is possible because the nonexistence of this number cannot be expressed as a first order statement of the above type. A hyperreal number like &quot;ω&quot; is called infinitely large; the reciprocals of the infinitely large numbers are the infinitesimals.

The hyperreals *R form an ordered field containing the reals R as a subfield. Unlike the reals, the hyperreals do not form a standard metric space, but by virtue of their order they carry an order topology.

== Constructions of the hyperreals ==

The hyperreals can be developed either axiomatically or by more constructively oriented methods. The essence of the axiomatic approach is to assert (1) the existence of at least one infinitesimal number, and (2) the validity of the transfer principle. In the following subsection we give a detailed outline of a more constructive approach. This method allows one to construct the hyperreals if given a set-theoretic object called an ultrafilter, but the ultrafilter itself cannot be explicitly constructed. Vladimir Kanovei and Shelah give a construction of a definable, countably saturated elementary extension of the structure consisting of the reals and all finitary relations on it.

In its most general form, transfer is a bounded elementary embedding between structures.

== Statement ==

The ordered field *R of nonstandard real numbers properly includes the real field R. Like all ordered fields that properly include R, this field is non-Archimedean. It means that some members &quot;x&quot; ≠ 0 of *R are infinitesimal, i.e.,

: formula_25

The only infinitesimal in &quot;R&quot; is 0. Some other members of *R, the reciprocals &quot;y&quot; of the nonzero infinitesimals, are infinite, i.e.,

: formula_26

The underlying set of the field *R is the image of R under a mapping &quot;A&quot;  *&quot;A&quot; from subsets &quot;A&quot; of R to subsets of *R. In every case

: formula_27

with equality if and only if &quot;A&quot; is finite. Sets of the form *&quot;A&quot; for some formula_28 are called standard subsets of *R. The standard sets belong to a much larger class of subsets of *R called internal sets. Similarly each function

: formula_29

extends to a function

: formula_30

these are called standard functions, and belong to the much larger class of internal functions. Sets and functions that are not internal are external.

The importance of these concepts stems from their role in the following proposition and is illustrated by the examples that follow it.

The transfer principle:

* Suppose a proposition that is true of *R can be expressed via functions of finitely many variables (e.g. (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;)  &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;), relations among finitely many variables (e.g. &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot;), finitary logical connectives such as and, or, not, if...then..., and the quantifiers

:: formula_31

: For example, one such proposition is

:: formula_32

: Such a proposition is true in R if and only if it is true in *R when the quantifier

:: formula_33

: replaces

:: formula_34

: and similarly for formula_35.

* Suppose a proposition otherwise expressible as simply as those considered above mentions some particular sets formula_28. Such a proposition is true in R if and only if it is true in *R with each such &quot;A&quot; replaced by the corresponding *&quot;A&quot;. Here are two examples:
:* The set
::: formula_37
:: must be
::: formula_38
:: including not only members of R between 0 and 1 inclusive, but also members of *R between 0 and 1 that differ from those by infinitesimals. To see this, observe that the sentence
::: formula_39
:: is true in R, and apply the transfer principle.
:* The set *N must have no upper bound in *R (since the sentence expressing the non-existence of an upper bound of N in R is simple enough for the transfer principle to apply to it) and must contain &quot;n&quot; + 1 if it contains &quot;n&quot;, but must not contain anything between &quot;n&quot; and &quot;n&quot; + 1. Members of
::: formula_40
:: are &quot;infinite integers&quot;.)
* Suppose a proposition otherwise expressible as simply as those considered above contains the quantifier
:: formula_41
: Such a proposition is true in R if and only if it is true in *R after the changes specified above and the replacement of the quantifiers with
:: formula_42
: and
:: formula_43

==Three examples==
The appropriate setting for the hyperreal transfer principle is the world of &quot;internal&quot; entities. Thus, the well-ordering property of the natural numbers by transfer yields the fact that every internal subset of formula_15 has a least element. In this section internal sets are discussed in more detail.
* Every nonempty &quot;internal&quot; subset of *R that has an upper bound in *R has a least upper bound in *R. Consequently the set of all infinitesimals is external.
** The well-ordering principle implies every nonempty &quot;internal&quot; subset of *N has a smallest member. Consequently the set
::: formula_45
:: of all infinite integers is external.
* If &quot;n&quot; is an infinite integer, then the set {1, ..., &quot;n&quot;} (which is not standard) must be internal. To prove this, first observe that the following is trivially true:
::: formula_46
:: Consequently
::: formula_47
* As with internal sets, so with internal functions: Replace
:: formula_48
: with
:: formula_49
: when applying the transfer principle, and similarly with formula_35 in place of formula_51.
: For example: If &quot;n&quot; is an infinite integer, then the complement of the image of any internal one-to-one function &quot;ƒ&quot; from the infinite set {1, ..., &quot;n&quot;} into {1, ..., &quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot; + 1, &quot;n&quot; + 2, &quot;n&quot; + 3} has exactly three members by the transfer principle. Because of the infiniteness of the domain, the complements of the images of one-to-one functions from the former set to the latter come in many sizes, but most of these functions are external.

: This last example motivates an important definition: A *-finite (pronounced star-finite) subset of *R is one that can be placed in &quot;internal&quot; one-to-one correspondence with {1, ..., &quot;n&quot;} for some &quot;n&quot; ∈ *N.

<text>Legion Field is an outdoor stadium in the southeastern United States in Birmingham, Alabama, primarily designed to be used as a venue for American football, but occasionally used for other large outdoor events. Opened in 1927, it is named in honor of the American Legion, a U.S. organization of military veterans.

The stadium served as the primary venue for Alabama Crimson Tide home games until the late 1990s and was for many years the site of the annual Iron Bowl rivalry game against Auburn. The UAB football team played at Legion Field from their inception in 1991 through the 2020 season. It has also hosted teams from various professional football leagues.

Since the removal of its east-side upper deck in 2005, Legion Field has a seating capacity of approximately 71,594. At its peak, it seated 83,091 for football and had the name &quot;Football Capital of the South&quot; emblazoned from the facade on the upper deck. Legion Field is colloquially called &quot;The Old Gray Lady&quot; and &quot;The Gray Lady on Graymont&quot;.

==Stadium history==

Construction of a 21,000-seat stadium began in 1926 at the cost of $439,000. It was completed in 1927 and named Legion Field as a war memorial in honor of the recently-established American Legion. In the stadium&#x27;s first event, 16,800 fans watched Howard College (now known as Samford University) shut out Birmingham–Southern College 9–0 on November 19, 1927.

Over the years, the stadium grew. The expansions didn&#x27;t follow the designer&#x27;s initial intent on the stadium becoming a monumental horseshoe-shaped amphitheater. Capacity was increased to 25,000 in 1934 and to 45,000 in 1948, and the bowl was enclosed. In 1961, a 9,000 seat upper deck was added to the east side of the stadium, increasing capacity to 54,600. In 1965, a new press box was built in the stadium and capacity was further increased to 68,821. The first nationally televised night college football game at Legion Field was between Ole Miss and Alabama on October 4, 1969.

In 1970, the natural grass turf was replaced with Poly-Turf, which was in turn replaced by AstroTurf in 1975. Seating capacity was increased to 75,808 in 1977 and further increased to 83,091 in 1991. The turf was changed back to a natural Bermuda grass surface in 1995 in order to host soccer events for the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. In 2006, the field went back to an artificial surface with infilled FieldTurf. The field has a conventional north–south alignment at an approximate elevation of above sea level.

In 2004, a structural evaluation determined that the 9,000 seat upper deck would need major remediation to meet modern building codes. With little prospect of adequate repairs on the way, the University of Alabama withdrew the few home games it still scheduled for Birmingham. The city removed the upper deck in 2005 since the capacity was greater than the need for its tenants. In 2015, renovations took place including general improvements and overall renovations including a new and larger video scoreboard along with a new and improved sound system.

The stadium&#x27;s future beyond the 2020 college football season is uncertain. The Birmingham–Jefferson Civic Center Authority started construction of a new stadium on the Birmingham–Jefferson Convention Complex grounds in July 2019. UAB football moved into the new 47,000-seat Protective Stadium, in 2021.

==College football==
===UAB Blazers===

Legion Field served as the home field of the UAB Blazers, members of Conference USA, from 1991 to 2020. The Blazers temporarily left Legion Field without a primary tenant during the school&#x27;s two-year hiatus from football. The Blazers returned to Legion Field for the first time in two years on September 2, 2017, setting a new attendance record in a 38–7 victory over Alabama A&amp;M.

===Iron Bowl===

Legion Field was well known for hosting the regular season-ending rivalry between Alabama and Auburn each year from 1948 to 1988. Because of Birmingham&#x27;s major industry of iron and steel manufacturing, the game became known as the &quot;Iron Bowl.&quot; From the series&#x27; resumption in 1948 to 1987, each team rotated claiming home-field rights, with Alabama as the nominal home team in even-numbered years and Auburn as the nominal home team in odd-numbered years. Tickets were split equally between the two athletic departments to sell, similar to other rivalries like the Red River Shootout between Oklahoma and Texas or the World&#x27;s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party between Georgia and Florida.

For many years, the Iron Bowl was played in Birmingham more or less out of necessity. Neither Alabama&#x27;s Bryant-Denny Stadium nor Auburn&#x27;s Jordan-Hare Stadium were nearly large enough to accommodate the large crowds that attended the game even in the 1950s. Additionally, Birmingham was much more accessible to the rest of the state well into the 1970s.

By the 1980s, Jordan-Hare Stadium had expanded to seat over 80,000 people. Combined with Legion Field&#x27;s decades-long association with Alabama football (see below), this led Auburn fans to lobby for making the Iron Bowl a home-and-home series, or at the very least allow Auburn to move its home games to Jordan-Hare. At the time, Alabama was Auburn&#x27;s only major rival to have never played a game on the Plains. Ultimately, in 1989, Auburn moved its home games in the series to Jordan-Hare. Thus, tickets for games held at Legion Field were no longer split equally. Auburn did host an Iron Bowl home game at Legion Field in 1991, but since then all Iron Bowls have been played at Auburn in odd-numbered years. In 2000, Alabama followed suit and decided to no longer play its home games against Auburn at Legion Field. Alabama holds a 32–15 advantage over Auburn in games played at Legion Field.

===Other Alabama and Auburn football games===

Alabama and Auburn used Legion Field as an alternate home stadium for much of the 20th century. At its height, Legion Field seated over 20,000 more people than Alabama&#x27;s Bryant-Denny Stadium and Auburn&#x27;s Jordan-Hare Stadium, making it a natural choice for games likely to attract large crowds. Between its use for the Iron Bowl and as an alternate home stadium for the Crimson Tide and Tigers, Legion Field played host to many of the most important football games in Alabama&#x27;s history.

Well into the 1980s, Alabama played most of its important games, as well as the Iron Bowl, at Legion Field—to the point that most of Alabama&#x27;s &quot;home&quot; football history from the 1920s to the 1980s took place in Birmingham. In addition to the larger capacity, Birmingham was more accessible than Tuscaloosa for much of the 20th century—even though Tuscaloosa is only 45 minutes west of Birmingham. The Crimson Tide hosted Tennessee in odd-numbered years in Birmingham until 1998, and hosted LSU in even-numbered years from 1964 through 1986, except for 1980. Well into the 1990s, Alabama usually played anywhere from three to four home games a year at Legion Field. Alabama also played its entire 1987 home schedule at Legion Field due to major renovations at Bryant–Denny Stadium. The stadium&#x27;s association with Alabama football was so strong that from the 1980s onward, Auburn lobbied to have its home games in the Iron Bowl played in Auburn.

Until 1999, Alabama played at least three games at Legion Field every season. In 1998, Alabama double-decked the east stands at Bryant-Denny, bringing its capacity to a few hundred more seats than that of Legion Field. Due to the disrepair of Legion Field and the added capacity in Tuscaloosa, Alabama moved major conference games on campus. In the ensuing years, Alabama decreased the number of games scheduled in Birmingham. The last home game for Alabama at Legion Field was against the University of South Florida on August 30, 2003. Though Alabama had a couple of games scheduled at Legion Field in 2005 and 2008, the stadium&#x27;s poor state of repair (see above) led Alabama to end its contract with the city of Birmingham in 2004 and move all home games to Tuscaloosa.

Auburn also used Legion Field for some home games well into the 1970s due to the larger capacity and the difficulty in traveling to Auburn for most of the 20th century. Auburn played all home games against Tennessee at Legion Field until 1978, except in 1974, when the game was played in Auburn. Auburn also played all home games against Georgia Tech at Legion Field until 1970. Auburn played its last home game at Legion Field in 1991, but took part in the Birmingham Bowl at the same stadium in 2015 as a postseason bowl game.

===Other college football games===

Legion Field has hosted a number of other college football games. The annual Magic City Classic between Alabama A&amp;M University and Alabama State University has been played here since 1946. The Steel City Classic featuring Miles College and Stillman College is also played at Legion Field. The MEAC/SWAC Challenge was played at Legion Field from 2005 to 2007, but moved to Orlando in 2008.

Birmingham–Southern College played against Mississippi College&#x27;s junior varsity team in Legion Field on September 6, 2007, in their first football game since 1939.

In terms of postseason play, the Southwestern Athletic Conference used the stadium for their conference championship from 1999 to 2012, but moved to Houston&#x27;s NRG Stadium in 2013. The Southeastern Conference played their first two conference title games here in 1992 and 1993.

This stadium has also hosted four different bowl games in its history:
*Dixie Bowl (1947–48)
*Hall of Fame Bowl (1977–1985) This game moved to Tampa, Florida in 1986 and was renamed the Outback Bowl in 1995.
*All-American Bowl (1986–1990)
*TicketSmarter Birmingham Bowl (2006–2020)

==Professional football==

Legion Field has served as the home stadium for various professional football teams in Birmingham. It served as home field for the Birmingham Americans (1974) and Birmingham Vulcans (1975) of the World Football League (1974–1975), the Alabama Vulcans of the American Football Association (1979), the Birmingham Stallions of the United States Football League (1983–1985), and the Birmingham Fire of the World League of American Football (later NFL Europe) in 1991–92. In 1995, it was the home field of the Birmingham Barracudas for their single season of play as part of the short-lived expansion of the Canadian Football League into the United States. In 2001, it was the home field for the single season of the Birmingham Thunderbolts of the XFL. In 2019, it was the home field for the Birmingham Iron of the Alliance of American Football. There have also been at least two NFL preseason games here, on August 8, 1970, when the New York Jets defeated the Buffalo Bills 33–10, and on August 27, 1988, when the Washington Redskins defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–17.

In 1968, the Boston Patriots of the American Football League played one &quot;home&quot; game against the New York Jets at Legion Field. The Jets, featuring former Alabama quarterback Joe Namath, won the game 47–31.

The inaugural 2022 season of the USFL was played at Protective Stadium and Legion Field. For the 2023 season, Protective Stadium served as the home stadium for the Birmingham Stallions and New Orleans Breakers.

==High school football==

Legion Field has hosted various high school football games throughout its history. From 1996 until 2008, Legion Field was used by the Alabama High School Athletic Association for the Super Six high school football championships.

==Soccer==

Legion Field has been used as a site for major soccer events, including preliminary matches in the 1996 Summer Olympics—the opening match between the United States and Argentina drew 83,810 spectators, the stadium&#x27;s all-time record for any event. All of the later-round soccer games moved to Athens, Georgia, after preliminary games had been played in various other cities.

Legion Field has also hosted exhibition games by the U.S. men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national soccer teams. The men&#x27;s team played a World Cup qualification match against Guatemala at the stadium on March 30, 2005.

When the City of Birmingham changed back to an artificial turf field in 2006, the United States Soccer Federation announced that it would no longer be scheduling men&#x27;s national team games for Legion Field.

===1996 Olympic Soccer Men&#x27;s tournament matches===


===1996 Olympic Soccer Women&#x27;s tournament matches===


==Concerts and other events==
Legion Field has also been used as a concert venue, hosting famous artists of many different genres, including U2, Ruben Studdard, Pink Floyd, and The Rolling Stones.

In 1979 and 1980, the facility played host to the Drum Corps International World Championships.

If Protective Stadium had not been completed in time for the 2022 World Games, that event&#x27;s opening and closing ceremonies would have been held at Legion Field. It remains in use at least through the World Games, as it served as the venue for flag football.

<text>Shawnee Mission USD 512 is a public unified school district headquartered in Shawnee Mission, Kansas, United States. The district comprises five high schools, five middle schools, 34 elementary schools, and six District centers. In the 2023–2024 school year, district enrollment is approximately 26,200 students.

==History==

In 1969, several school districts unified to become the Shawnee Mission School District. These districts were Greenwood District 39, Shawnee District 22, Lenexa District 500, Districts 10 and 90, Valley View District 49, Overland Park District 10, Linwood District 1, Roeland District 92, Merriam District 99, Antioch District 61, Westwood View District 93, Prairie District 44, and Corinth District 82.
South Park Elementary school, in Merriam, Kansas, played a role in school desegregation before the unification of the Shawnee Mission School District. South Park opened in 1948 for white students, leaving African-American students in the inadequate Walker Elementary using an outdated curriculum. Corinthian Nutter, an African-American teacher, resigned in protest and taught the students from her home. In 1949, the Webb vs. School District 90 case paved the way for Brown v. Topeka Board of Education five years later.

McAuliffe Elementary School in Lenexa, Kansas, was one of the first schools in the nation named in honor of Christa McAuliffe.

The district converted from the 7–8–9 junior high model to the 7–8 middle school model in 1986.

The Superintendent is Michael Schumacher and was selected by the Board of Education on February 12, 2024. 

==Shawnee Mission North High School==

Shawnee Mission Rural High School opened on September 12, 1922, having cost $950,000 to build. It had 12 faculty members and a senior class of 20. The school colors are Red, Black, and White, and the school mascot was the Indian.

There had been a vote on September 21, 1921, on a &quot;proposal to organize a rural high school district.&quot; The school was named &quot;&#x27; Shawnee Mission Rural&quot; until 1945 when senior Robert F. Bennett was sent to Topeka to petition the legislature for a name change to more accurately reflect the school&#x27;s suburban status. Later elected Governor of Kansas, Bennett was named North&#x27;s first Distinguished Alumnus by the class of 1975. It was thus named Shawnee Mission High School until 1958 when Shawnee Mission East High School opened and Shawnee Mission High School was renamed Shawnee Mission North High School. The student body of Shawnee Mission High School had petitioned the school board to name the new school anything other than Shawnee Mission East High School in an attempt to avoid a renaming of their school.

In the 2023–2024 school year, enrollment is approximately 1,507 students.

<doc id="637147" wikidata="Q2989851" url="?curid=637147" title="The Keys of Marinus">
<text>The Keys of Marinus is the fifth serial in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast on BBC TV/BBC1 in six weekly parts from 11 April to 16 May 1964. Written by Terry Nation and directed by John Gorrie, the serial takes on a &quot;mini-adventures&quot; format, in which the First Doctor (William Hartnell), his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford), and her teachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell), and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) search for four keys to restore the Conscience of Marinus, a computer which maintains law and order. The group travel to two cities, a jungle, and an icy wasteland in search of the keys.

&quot;The Keys of Marinus&quot; was written to replace a different script which was deemed problematic. When commissioned to write the script, Nation was intrigued by the idea of the TARDIS crew searching for pieces of a puzzle; he and script editor David Whitaker decided to construct the serial around a series of &quot;mini-adventures&quot;, each with a different setting and cast. Incidental music was composed by Norman Kay, while Raymond Cusick, Daphne Dare, and Jill Summers worked as designers. The serial premiered with nine million viewers, maintaining audience figures for several weeks before seeing a significant drop from the fifth episode. Response for the serial was mixed, and it received several print adaptations and home media releases.

== Plot ==
The First Doctor (William Hartnell), his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford), and her teachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) arrive on a small island on the planet Marinus where they meet Arbitan (George Coulouris), Keeper of the Conscience of Marinus—a vast computer developed as a justice machine which kept law and order across the entire planet. Arbitan explains that the society of Marinus is in danger, as the Voord, humanoid creatures protected by amphibian-like black rubber wet suits, are seeking to enter the tower to take control of the Conscience. To prevent this, the Conscience requires five keys, and Arbitan coerces the Doctor and his friends to gather them by placing a force field around the TARDIS. As they teleport to the City of Morphoton, Arbitan is stabbed to death by a Voord that has gained access to the tower.

In Morphoton, the crew are impressed by the luxuries of the city; however, Barbara soon realises that they have been hypnotised, and that Morphoton is actually a place of dirt and squalor. The creatures who govern Morphoton order Barbara&#x27;s death, but Barbara escapes and hides in the city, where she makes contact with the slave girl Sabetha (Katharine Schofield), who has been blamed for Barbara&#x27;s awakening and sentenced to death. Barbara notices one of the keys around her neck. They escape and destroy the creatures, freeing the subjects of the city. Another slave, Altos (Robin Phillips), remembers that he was also sent by Arbitan, and he and Sabetha join the Doctor and his crew on their quest. While the Doctor continues to the City of Mellennius, the others search in a dangerous screaming jungle. After triggering a trap, Barbara is lost in an ancient temple in the jungle; while Ian remains at the temple to search for the key, Sabetha and Susan continue to the next location.

Ian finds Barbara in the temple, where they discover an aged scientist, Darrius (Edmund Warwick), who reveals the location of the next key before dying; Ian and Barbara retrieve the key and teleport to an icy wasteland. They meet the duplicitous trapper Vasor (Francis de Wolff), who steals their keys. Ian and Altos confront Vasor and force him to take them to the ice caves, where they find Sabetha and Susan with mechanised Ice Soldiers, and discover the next key frozen in a block of ice. As they flee, Vasor takes Susan hostage, but an Ice Soldier kills him and the group escapes. At the next location, Ian is accused of the murder of Eprin (Dougie Dean), a friend of Altos. At Ian&#x27;s trial, the Doctor returns and postpones the trial while he gathers evidence. Susan is kidnapped as a hostage to persuade the Doctor to stop investigating. The kidnapper has persuaded the judges to find Ian guilty; however, Susan is found bound and gagged, and the plot is uncovered. The Doctor finds the final key, hidden in the murder weapon, and Ian is freed.

The travellers return to Arbitan&#x27;s island, where Altos and Sabetha have been held prisoner by Yartek (Stephen Dartnell)—Arbitan&#x27;s killer—and the four keys have been seized. The Doctor frees Altos and Sabetha and unmasks the Voord. Ian gives Yartek a false key found in the screaming jungle; when Yartek places the key in the Conscience, the machine explodes and he is killed along with the occupying Voord. The Doctor, Susan, Ian, and Barbara flee the tower with Altos and Sabetha before the growing blaze overtakes the ancient structure.

== Production ==
=== Conception and writing ===
&quot;The Keys of Marinus&quot; was written to replace a different script, &quot;Dr Who and the Hidden Planet&quot; by Malcolm Hulke, which was deemed problematic and required rewrites. The production team approached Terry Nation, writer of the second serial &quot;The Daleks&quot;, to write the serial. Nation had been due to write &quot;Doctor Who&quot;″s eighth serial, &quot;The Red Fort&quot;, but had focused on other projects in the interim. Due to the quick turnaround required for the script, Nation and script editor David Whitaker decided to base the serial around a series of &quot;mini-adventures&quot;, each with a different setting and cast; Nation was intrigued by the idea of the TARDIS crew searching for parts of a puzzle. As the first two episodes were written with mostly interior sets, Nation wanted to tell a story more &quot;out in the open&quot;, setting the third episode in a jungle to allow the designer an opportunity for different settings. Whitaker suggested a cold snow-scape setting for the fourth episode to contrast with the hot jungle. Nation used many existing words for location and character names in the story: Marinus originated from the Latin word &quot;marinus&quot;, meaning &quot;of the sea&quot;; Morphoton is based on Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams; Millennius came from the term &quot;millennium&quot;, for a thousand years; and Arbitan is based on the Latin word &quot;Arbiter&quot;, meaning a judge. Producer Verity Lambert selected John Gorrie as the serial&#x27;s director; even though Gorrie was unhappy with the quality of the scripts, he agreed to direct the serial to advance his career.

=== Characters and casting ===
Carole Ann Ford was displeased with the portrayal of Susan in the serial, as she felt that she was written like a child, describing her character as &quot;pathetic&quot;. By mid-March 1964, the serial&#x27;s guest cast had been finalised. Veteran actor George Coulouris was cast in the role of Arbitan; Gorrie immediately thought of Coulouris for the role while reading the script, and was delighted when he accepted the part, describing Coulouris as his &quot;hero&quot;. Francis de Wolff was selected to play Vasor, while Donald Pickering played Eyesen. Gorrie cast Henley Thomas as Tarron; the two were old friends who had previously worked together. Robin Phillips, who was also friends with Gorrie, was cast as Altos; Gorrie felt that Phillips&#x27; handsome looks fit the role of Altos accurately. Similarly, he wanted the character of Sabetha to resemble a princess, and selected former drama student Katharine Schofield. Gorrie was impressed by the sinister voice of Heron Carvic, casting him as the Voice of Morpho, and the role of Kala was given to Fiona Walker, who had written to Gorrie for a role. For the role of the Voord, among other villains, three young actors, who were friends of Gorrie, were cast: Martin Cort, Peter Stenson, and Gordon Webster.

=== Music and design ===
Norman Kay, who had scored the show&#x27;s first serial, composed the incidental music for &quot;The Keys of Marinus&quot;. The score, performed by seven musicians, was recorded in Maida Vale Studio on 7 March 1964; several standard instruments were used, including a clarinet, bass clarinet, double bass, guitar, flute, harp, piccolo, trumpet and percussion. Nineteen new sound effects were recorded for the serial by Brian Hodgson of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, including the sounds of the Conscience of Marinus and the clocks in Millennius. Raymond Cusick, Daphne Dare and Jill Summers were commissioned as the designers for the serial. Dare based the design of the Voord on a rubber wetsuit, while the heads were created using vulcanised rubber by prop builders Jack and John Lovell. The submersible props and the Conscience machine were designed by Shawcraft Models. Cusick used leftover fibreglass to complete the design of the Conscience machine, as the budget was running low. The moving vegetation in the third episode was constructed by Design and Display Ltd. Jablite polystyrene was used to simulate snow in the third and fourth episodes. The tank-top worn by Susan in the serial was knitted by Ford&#x27;s mother.

=== Filming ===
Model filming for &quot;The Keys of Marinus&quot; commenced in March 1964 at Ealing Studios. For the shots of the wolves in the fourth episode, the BBC purchased 14 feet of film from the 1957 Russian thriller &quot;Seryy razboynik&quot; (&quot;The Grey Robber&quot;) from distributor Sovexport. Rehearsals for the first episode took place from 16–19 March, and weekly recording for the serial began on 20 March in Lime Grove Studios. Gorrie found the recording days difficult, due to the complexity of the show and the small size of the studio. William Hartnell was absent from the recording of the third and fourth episodes, as he was on holiday. Ford recalled that the cast could &quot;have a few more giggles&quot; during rehearsals, as Hartnell&#x27;s tendency to forget lines was time-consuming. The final episode was recorded on 24 April 1964. The first episode was edited on 23 March. While most episodes were edited within three hours in an evening, the second episode required two evenings, on 31 March and 2 April 1964.

== Reception ==
=== Broadcast and ratings ===
The first episode was broadcast on BBC TV on 11 April 1964, and was watched by 9.9 million viewers, maintaining the audience from previous weeks. The following episode dropped to 9.4 million viewers, while the third returned to 9.9 million. The third episode became the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode to be transmitted on BBC1, following its renaming from BBC TV due to the launch of BBC2. The fourth episode was the serial&#x27;s most watched, with 10.4 million viewers, followed by a significant drop for the fifth and sixth episodes, with 7.9 million and 6.9 million viewers, respectively; from the fifth episode, the show&#x27;s broadcast time returned to its original slot of 5:15pm. The drop in viewers for the sixth episode was attributed to the absence of &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot;—the programme that followed &quot;Doctor Who&quot;—which was replaced by the film &quot;Where Coco Lives&quot;. The Appreciation Index was an average of 61 for the six episodes, ranging from 60 to 63.

=== Critical response ===
The serial received mixed reviews. Bob Leeson of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; felt that the fifth episode of the serial was the show&#x27;s low point, noting that the introduction of a trial scene represented a rushed script. In &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping felt that the episodic narrative left little room for each story to develop, and that the show&#x27;s limited budget was evident. In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker praised Cusick&#x27;s work with a limited budget, and enjoyed the serial&#x27;s conclusion. In &quot;A Critical History of Doctor Who&quot; (1999), John Kenneth Muir lauded the serial&#x27;s depiction of co-existing—but not strictly interconnected—cultures and the development of their world. In a 2008 review, Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; wrote that &quot;standards slip appreciably&quot; after the four preceding serials in terms of &quot;ambitious but slapdash&quot; script quality, as well as the below-par sets and supporting characters.

In 2009, Graham Kibble-White in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; derided Susan&#x27;s character for &quot;devolving into a bit of a shrill&quot;, but was generally positive towards the episodic story structure and the timing of Hartnell&#x27;s holiday. Despite this, he wrote that the final two episodes &quot;never truly engages with the tenets of courtroom drama&quot;. Elliot Thorpe of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; felt that the episodic story structure &quot;works incredibly well&quot; by keeping the momentum and making each episode &quot;fresh&quot;. In 2010, &quot;DVD Talk&quot; J. Doyle Wallis attributed the serial&#x27;s weakness to the Doctor&#x27;s absence, the lack of a main antagonist that would thread the episodes together, the &quot;lacking and disparate&quot; world of Marinus, and the &quot;ramshackle&quot; execution of the concept. Arnold T. Blumberg of &quot;IGN&quot; described the serial as &quot;a clichéd premise ... handled poorly and with no spark at all apart from Hartnell&#x27;s late-hour rally&quot;. He cited the poor production quality and the &quot;hodge-podge&quot; leaps to various locations on Marinus which were &quot;boring if not inept&quot;.

== Commercial releases ==

A novelisation of this serial, written by Philip Hinchcliffe, was published by Target Books in August 1980, with artwork by David McAllister. The paperback version of the book was also included in &quot;The Doctor Who Gift Set&quot; in 1986. The serial was released on VHS in March 1999, and on DVD in September 2009; the latter included several special features, including audio commentary and a documentary on the sets featured in the serial. While remastering the serial for the DVD release, it was discovered that the second and fourth episodes had been slightly edited; off-air soundtracks recorded by David Holman were used to restore the cuts. Sound effects from the serial, under the title &quot;Sleeping Machine&quot;, were included on &quot;Doctor Who: The 50th Anniversary Collection&quot;, originally released on CD in December 2013.

<doc id="637149" wikidata="Q6531032" url="?curid=637149" title="Les Moonves">
<text>Leslie Roy Moonves (; born October 6, 1949) is an American media executive who was the chairman and CEO of CBS Corporation from 2003 until his resignation in September 2018 following numerous allegations of sexual harassment, sexual assault and abuse. He has been married to TV personality Julie Chen since 2004.

He held a series of executive positions at CBS from July 1995 to September 2018. He was also on the board of directors at ZeniMax Media from 1999 until 2021. Later, he was co-president and co-chief operating officer (COO) of the original Viacom, the legal predecessor to CBS Corporation, from 2004 until the company split in December 2005. He became chairman of CBS in February 2016. In September 2018, Moonves stepped down as chairman of CBS after multiple women brought forth sexual assault allegations against him. Moonves allegedly destroyed evidence of his sexual misconduct.

According to various media reports, Moonves has amassed a net worth of over US$800 million through compensation from CBS. Moonves earned $68.4 million in 2017, combined with stock options of the media company, worth over $100 million.

==Early life==
Leslie Roy Moonves was born in Brooklyn, New York City to a Jewish family, the son of Josephine (Schleifer) and Herman Moonves, and grew up in Valley Stream, New York. His mother was a nurse. He has one sister, Melissa Moonves Colon, and two brothers, including entertainment attorney Jonathan Moonves. He attended Valley Stream Central High School and went to Bucknell University, graduating in 1971. In his sophomore year, he decided that his science courses were unfulfilling and switched his major from pre-medical to the Spanish language (a subject he found vastly more enjoyable) and acted in a few plays; following graduation in 1971 he moved to Manhattan to pursue an acting career where he eventually graduated from the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. He landed a few parts, playing tough guys on &quot;Cannon&quot; and &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, which he described as &quot;forgettable&quot; TV roles before deciding on the career change. He also worked as one of casting director Caro Jones&#x27; first office assistants early in her career.
==Business career==
Moonves was in charge of first-run syndication and pay/cable programming at 20th Century Fox Television. Also at 20th Century Fox Television, he was vice president of movies and mini-series. Other positions included vice president of development at Saul Ilson Productions (in association with Columbia Pictures Television) and development executive for Catalina Productions.

===Lorimar Television and Warner Bros. Television (1985–1995)===
Moonves joined Lorimar Television in 1985 as executive in charge of its movies and mini-series, and in 1988, became head of creative affairs. From 1990 to 1993, he was president at Lorimar. In July 1993, he became president/CEO of Warner Bros. Television, when Warner Bros. and Lorimar Television combined operations. In this phase of his career, he green-lighted the shows &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;ER&quot;, among many others.

===CBS (1995–2018)===
He joined CBS in July 1995 as President of CBS Entertainment. From April 1998 until 2003, he was president and chief executive officer at CBS, then was promoted to chairman and CEO of CBS in 2003. CBS had six of the ten most-watched primetime shows in the final quarter of 2005: &quot;&quot;, &quot;Without a Trace&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;NCIS&quot;, and &quot;Cold Case&quot;.

In February 2005, Moonves was identified as the executive directly responsible for ordering the cancellation of UPN&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; and the ending of the 18-year revival of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television franchise. In January 2006, Moonves helped make the deal that brought together the CBS-owned United Paramount Network (UPN) with The WB Television Network to form The CW Television Network that fall.

Moonves was the second most highly-paid executive for 2012 and 2013: he received $58.8 million and $65.4 million. He is considered the second-highest paid CEO, having been paid $68.4 million in 2017.

In 2013, Moonves was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. He became chairman of CBS in February 2016.

Of the tone of the 2016 Republican presidential campaign, and the advertising dollars it delivered, Moonves said, &quot;It may not be good for America, but it&#x27;s damn good for CBS ... Man, who would have expected the ride we&#x27;re all having right now? ... The money&#x27;s rolling in and this is fun ... I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this, and this [is] going to be a very good year for us. Sorry. It&#x27;s a terrible thing to say. But, bring it on, Donald. Keep going.&quot; He added, &quot;Donald&#x27;s place in this election is a good thing.&quot;

Moonves was also open to acquiring smaller film production companies to expand the company&#x27;s CBS Films division. At the end of July 2017, Moonves was a part of a first-look television production deal between CBS and Imagine Entertainment, a feature film, television programming and documentary production company run by filmmaker Ron Howard and film producer Brian Grazer.

In September 2018, following allegations of sexual assault, it was reported that CBS was negotiating a $100 million exit package for Moonves and that CBS Chief Operating Officer Joe Ianniello would be his interim replacement. On September 9, 2018, CBS Corporation announced he had resigned and Joe Iannello would become interim CEO. Moonves and CBS will donate $20 million to the #MeToo movement, money that will be deducted from any severance benefits Moonves may be owed, the company said. The donation to charities promoting women&#x27;s equality in the workplace would come upon the conclusion of an independent investigation into the allegations, according to the statement. In May 2021, Moonves dropped his claim for $120 million in severance pay, which reverted to ViacomCBS (the result of the 2019 merger of CBS Corporation and the second Viacom, later Paramount Global in 2022), and law firm Covington &amp; Burling paid an undisclosed settlement fee to Moonves.

===Janet Jackson===
Following his firing from CBS due to sexual harassment, Moonves was revealed to have been obsessed with ruining R&amp;B singer-songwriter Janet Jackson&#x27;s career. His actions had followed the February 1, 2004, Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, also known as Nipplegate. Jackson&#x27;s right breast, adorned with a pierced nipple shield (with a silver sun), had been exposed by ex-NSYNC member, vocalist Justin Timberlake, for 9/16ths of a second.

The brief exposure became, what was at the time, the most rewatched moment in the history of TiVo.

According to the documentary &quot;&quot;, Moonves wanted an apology from both Jackson and Timberlake. Moonves deemed Jackson&#x27;s apology as &quot;insufficient&quot; and implemented a blacklist of her music and music videos on MTV, VH1 and Infinity Broadcasting radio stations, all of which were owned by the original incarnation of Viacom at the time. MTV also had produced the halftime show, and it was permanently disallowed from producing future halftime shows as a consequence. Jackson had been scheduled to attend the 46th Annual Grammy Awards where she was to perform a tribute to Luther Vandross, after collaborating with him on the #1 single &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free&quot;, which was created for the soundtrack to the 1992 film &quot;Mo&#x27; Money.&quot; She, along with Timberlake, however, were disinvited from attending unless they released on-air apologies for the &quot;Nipplegate&quot; incident. Only Timberlake went to the ceremony after having approached Moonves in person at CBS&#x27;s Los Angeles offices, where he tearfully apologized to him. The Vandross tribute was instead performed by Celine Dion, Alicia Keys and Richard Marx. CBS was fined $27,500 for the incident. In June 2006, that amount later was later increased to $325,000 by the Federal Communications Commission.) Moonves allegedly asked fellow CBS executives if the corporation could compel Jackson to pay the FCC fines following the investigation of the halftime show incident by Congress.

Moonves&#x27;s anger at Jackson over the occurrence continued well into 2011, when Jackson signed a book deal with publisher Simon &amp; Schuster, owned by CBS Corporation, for the self-help book &quot;True You: A Journey to Finding and Loving Yourself.&quot; &quot;How the f*** did she slip through?,&quot; he reportedly inquired. Moonves also said, according to one source, that &quot;...heads were going to roll,&quot; as a result of the settlement to which Jackson had agreed.

===Howard Stern litigation===
In February 2006, Moonves led CBS to file a $500 million lawsuit against Howard Stern for allegedly breaching his contract by failing to disclose the details of his deal with Sirius Satellite Radio while still employed by Infinity Broadcasting. Stern vowed to fight the suit, and said on his radio program that Moonves and CBS were trying to &quot;bully&quot; him and his agent, Don Buchwald. Stern later appeared on CBS&#x27;s own &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, wearing a shirt mocking Moonves and his wife. In June 2006, Stern announced that the lawsuit had been settled. As part of the settlement, Sirius acquired the exclusive rights to all of the WXRK tapes (over two decades&#x27; worth of shows) for $2 million.

===ZeniMax Media===
Moonves was on the board of ZeniMax Media from its foundation in 1999 until 2021, alongside his friend and ZeniMax president Ernest Del. Moonves&#x27;s personal investment in the company has been noted, as well as his appearances at several launch parties, including for Bethesda Softworks&#x27; &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot;, and &quot;Rage&quot;.

===Sexual assault allegations===

Moonves voiced support for the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment in the workplace, even describing it as a &quot;watershed moment&quot; during a November 2017 press conference, and was a founding member of the Commission on Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equality in the Workplace, formed in late 2017 to &quot;tackle the broad culture of abuse and power disparity&quot;. In January 2018, CBS Cares released public service announcements concerning how to combat sexual harassment.

In July 2018, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published an article by Ronan Farrow saying that six women accused Moonves of harassment and intimidation, and dozens have described abuse at CBS. Moonves was subsequently placed under investigation by the CBS board. In August 2018, Bucknell University removed references to Moonves on its website, and University of Southern California suspended Moonves&#x27;s name from its Media Center. In September 2018, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; reported that six more women (in addition to the six original women reported in July) had raised accusations against Moonves, going back to the 1980s. Shortly after resigning as CEO of CBS that month, Moonves released a statement denying all of the sexual misconduct allegations.

In November 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article in which actress Bobbie Phillips alleged that Moonves sexually assaulted her during the mid-1990s, and was attempting to bury the allegations. The next month, it was revealed Moonves had been involved in paying a $9.5 million settlement to actress Eliza Dushku, who claimed she was written out of her starring role on CBS drama &quot;Bull&quot; as retaliation for reporting sexual harassment by co-star Michael Weatherly; actress Cybill Shepherd alleged in a radio interview that Moonves cancelled her sitcom, &quot;Cybill&quot;, after she rejected his advances.

On December 18, 2018, CBS announced that the board would deny Moonves his $120 million severance pay, as their investigation had found Moonves violated his contract. According to investigators, claims made by the women were credible and led to more claims that were found to be credible during the course of the investigation. In addition, it was claimed that Moonves attempted to interfere with the investigation. Allegations of examples include Moonves refusing to cooperate with investigators, acting &quot;evasive and untruthful&quot; towards investigators, deleting hundreds of messages, and passing off his son&#x27;s iPad as his own to investigators.

On June 21, 2019, advice columnist E. Jean Carroll wrote in a first-person essay in &quot;New York&quot; that Moonves sexually assaulted her in an elevator in the mid-1990s after she interviewed him for a story. Moonves denied the allegation.

On May 14, 2021, CBS and Moonves agreed to settle their disputes over the latter&#x27;s $120 million severance. A joint statement from Moonves and CBS explained that the $120 million would &quot;revert&quot; to CBS, that the cost of the settlement would be borne by CBS&#x27;s law firm, and that Moonves would contribute the settlement money to various charities.

On February 8, 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Moonves had founded his own company in West Hollywood, California named Moon Rise Unlimited after being fired from CBS.

==Public appearances==
On April 7, 2003, Moonves portrayed himself in an episode of &quot;The Practice&quot;. From early 2004 until its end in May 2015, Moonves made regular appearances on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. One of these came when Letterman declared outrage that CBS featured his late-night competitor Jay Leno in an ad for CBS&#x27;s telecast of the People&#x27;s Choice Awards. Letterman jokingly warned the &quot;CBS stooge in the control room&quot; to call his buddies &quot;before things turn ugly&quot;; Moonves obliged. Later appearances took the same format, with Letterman discussing current events and the CBS network with the company&#x27;s CEO.

On the March 23, 2015, premiere episode of &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot;, Moonves portrayed himself as the head of CBS who sends out a golden ticket granting whoever finds it a chance to host &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, in an homage to &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;. Moonves also appeared on the September 8, 2015, premiere of &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, operating a large switch he could use to switch back to reruns of &quot;The Mentalist&quot; if he was unhappy with the new program.

==Personal life==

Moonves is a grand-nephew of Paula Ben-Gurion, born Paula Munweis, wife of David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel.

In 1978, Moonves married Nancy Wiesenfeld, with whom he has three children including &quot;W&quot; magazine editor in chief Sara Moonves. In April 2003, Nancy Moonves filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences. Nancy and Les Moonves were already living apart.

While still married to Nancy, Moonves began dating Julie Chen, CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Early Show&quot; reporter and host of the reality series &quot;Big Brother&quot; and &quot;The Talk&quot;. On December 10, 2004, Moonves got a court to grant an early divorce, on a motion citing a &quot;desire to return to the status of being single&quot;. Thirteen days later in Mexico, he married Chen. In 2009, Chen gave birth to a son.

Moonves resides in Beverly Hills, California, in a house he bought from Andy Heyward. He also owns residences in Malibu, California and New York City.

Moonves practices Transcendental Meditation, and has said, &quot;It puts me in a calm state, which I&#x27;m not always in.&quot;

===Philanthropy===
In 2015, Moonves and Chen made a major donation to University of Southern California, resulting in a media center being named the Julie Chen/Leslie Moonves and CBS Media Center. Moonves was already a USC School of Cinematic Arts&#x27; board of councilors member. Previously Moonves was a University of Southern California&#x27;s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism board member.

In August 2018, Moonves was &quot;suspended&quot; from the USC School of Cinematic Arts&#x27; board of councilors in the wake of sex abuse allegations.

In September 2018, at the same time Moonves resigned, CBS announced that Moonves and the network would be donating $20 million to #MeToo-related organizations.

<doc id="637150" wikidata="Q3496444" url="?curid=637150" title="Birmingham Stallions">
<text>The Birmingham Stallions were a franchise in the United States Football League, an attempt to establish a second professional league of American football in the United States in competition with the National Football League. They played their home games at Birmingham, Alabama&#x27;s Legion Field. They competed in all three USFL seasons, 1983–1985. During their run, they were one of the USFL&#x27;s more popular teams, and seemed to have a realistic chance of being a viable venture had the USFL been better run.

The owner was Cincinnati financier and Birmingham native Marvin Warner. The team&#x27;s coach was Rollie Dotsch, who was previously the offensive line coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers during its Super Bowl years and ended up with the second most wins in USFL history. The Stallions starting quarterback for their final two seasons was Cliff Stoudt, a long-time backup to Terry Bradshaw with the Steelers. Stoudt had finally taken over for the injured Bradshaw in 1983 and had played very well for the first half of the season, but his game fell apart in the second half of the season, leading Steeler fans to harshly turn on him. After the season, Stoudt quickly decided it was not worth staying in Pittsburgh and signed with the Stallions. (Amusingly, the expansion Pittsburgh Maulers&#x27; lone sellout was the game where Cliff Stoudt returned to Pittsburgh. Steeler fans pelted the hated Stoudt with snowballs throughout the game, but Stoudt and Birmingham won, 30–18.)

In Birmingham, Stoudt proved to be an excellent QB, finishing in the league&#x27;s top 5 in 1984 and 1985, among such peers as Jim Kelly and Chuck Fusina and leading the team to two divisional titles. The Stallions also added Bills star HB Joe Cribbs in 1984. Cribbs led the league in rushing in 1984 and finished 6th in 1985. Former Steeler WR Jim Smith was another of the team&#x27;s stars. Many other Stallions players would play in the NFL once the USFL went out of existence.

==1983 season==
Warner was initially slated to be the owner of the USFL&#x27;s Washington franchise–what became the Washington Federals. However, when he learned that the USFL was putting a franchise in his hometown, he jumped at it. Without Warner&#x27;s wealth behind them, the Federals were forced to abandon the capital after two seasons and move to Orlando as the Renegades.

The Stallions scrambled to put a roster together after training camp and signed or claimed approximately 20 players via trades or waivers in the week prior to their first game. However, Dotsch managed to mold them into a fairly competitive team that finished 9-9.

Although the team made a splash in signing their first-round draft pick, quarterback Reggie Collier out of Southern Mississippi, the remainder of the Stallions consisted of mostly unsung former NFL reserves and college free agents.

One of the few pro veterans signed was center Tom Banks (a Birmingham native), who spent ten seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals. Banks played 116 NFL games (starting 63) while with the Cardinals and was brought in by coach Rollie Dotsch to serve as a mentor to a very young club. Banks eventually retired after the 1984 Stallions&#x27; season and became an assistant coach on the Birmingham staff in 1985.

Other NFL veterans who signed with the Stallions included former Kansas City Chief RB Earl Gant (2 years, 20 games with the Chiefs), RB Ken Talton (1 year, 2 games with the Lions), WR/KR Kevin Miller (3 years, 20 games with the Vikings), TE Steve Stephens (1 year, 16 games with the Jets), OT Robert Woods (8 years, 99 games with the Jets and Saints), OG Buddy Aydelette (1 year, 9 games with the Packers), DE Mike Raines (7 years, 104 games with the CFL Ottawa Rough Riders), DE Reggie P. Lewis (2 years, 22 games with the Buccaneers), LB Dallas Hickman (6 years, 91 games with the Redskins), CB Mike Thomas (6 years, 77 games with the Redskins and Chargers) and SS Billy Cesare (5 years, 46 games with the Buccaneers, Dolphins and Lions),

The Stallions had some success in signing several of their 1983 draft picks to go along with Collier. Guard Pat Saindon (8th round, Vanderbilt), nose tackle Charles Martin (15th round, Livingston College) and reserve guard Mike Turner (16th round, Louisiana State). Martin would go on to play for the Green Bay Packers and was involved in an infamous bodyslam tackle of Chicago Bears QB Jim McMahon in 1986 at Soldier Field. They also signed two key territorial draft selections in defensive end Jackie Cline from Alabama and offensive tackle Pat Phenix from Ole&#x27; Miss.

The Stallions also signed a rookie free agent named Scott Norwood who would later be infamous as the Buffalo Bills kicker who missed a field goal in the dying minutes of the Super Bowl in 1990.

After dropping their opening game on a Monday night (9-7, at home to the Michigan Panthers) the Stallions rebounded on the road the following week with a 20–14 overtime victory in Oakland against the Invaders to record their first franchise win.

However, the Stallions struggled out of the gate with a 2–5 record as Coach Rollie Dotsch and his staff put a patchwork, blue-collar, run-oriented club together.

Prior to the Stallions&#x27; sixth game of the season, former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Jim Smith (6 years, 73 games with the Steelers) was signed by Dotsch to add some punch to a listless receiving corps. Smith did not disappoint as his arrival helped the offense almost immediately. Dotsch was very familiar with Smith as they were members of two Super Bowl Championship clubs in the Steel City.

The turning point in the season, however, was during a home game in Week #8 (Sunday, April 24) against the Oakland Invaders when backup quarterback Bobby Lane took the reins of the Stallions offense from Collier, who struggled with injuries and inconsistency.

Lane&#x27;s heroics won the game vs. Oakland and the Stallions went on to win four subsequent games that improved their record to a 7–5 mark. However, the club managed to only win two of their last six games to finish with a 9–9 mark and a fourth-place finish in the Central Division.

All four teams in the USFL Central Division in 1983 were at .500 or above (Michigan 12–6, Chicago 12-6 and Tampa Bay 11-7 all recorded strong campaigns).

The biggest game of the 1983 season for the Stallions came in Week #11 on a Saturday night (May 14, 1983) when they defeated the visiting Los Angeles Express, 35–20, in front of the largest crowd of the year at Legion Field (42,212). The crowd featured over 20,000 people from the families of local steel and Iron workers unions.

The following week, the Stallions went on the road and defeated the eventual USFL Champion Michigan Panthers, 23–20 at the Pontiac Silverdome. The game was highlighted by a disputed touchdown late in the game when a Michigan defender intercepted a ball in the end zone, spiked the ball and had it recovered by a Stallions&#x27; player before the play was blown dead.

Birmingham finished the season as the top rushing club in the USFL with 3,017 yards on 701 carries, however, the Stallions ranked 11th in the 12-team loop with 2,999 yards passing.

Late in the season, the club also announced the signing of former Buffalo Bills running back Joe Cribbs, who would join the club at the start of the 1984 season. Cribbs, who played his college ball locally for the Auburn Tigers, signed a three-year contract with the Stallions.

==1984 season==

With the off-season signing of former NFL&#x27;ers quarterback Cliff Stoudt, running back Joe Cribbs, full back Leon Perry, defensive end Dave Pureifory and CFL cornerback Ricky Ray, the Stallions outlook for the 1984 campaign was bright.

Coach Dotsch shored up several areas, including the defensive line where three players from the 1983 squad were let go. Also added to the lineup was a college free agent in safety Chuck Clanton who burst onto the scene with the Stallions in 1984 as a major force on a re-build defense.

The Stallions also employed a re-vamped defense with a regular &quot;Nickel&quot; formation featuring, two linebackers and 5 defensive backs – one of the first defenses of its kind utilized in the USFL (the San Antonio Gunslingers were the other team to feature the nickel defense as well in 1984). They already had a reputation as a hard-hitting team, which was thought to be carried over from Dotsch&#x27;s days with the Steelers.

The Stallions&#x27; first game of the 1984 campaign was before a league record 62,500 fans at Legion Field against another re-constructed club in the New Jersey Generals. With the Generals arriving in town like a circus with new owner Donald Trump, running back Herschel Walker and quarterback Brian Sipe in tow, Birmingham was abuzz with anticipation for the new season.

The opening game against New Jersey was broadcast on national television on ABC, however, the Stallions were listless in a 17–6 loss to the Generals to start the season.

However, the game would mark the start of a nine-game unbeaten streak that took the Stallions into a May 6 contest at Legion Field with a 9–1 record against the 9-1 Philadelphia Stars. In its biggest game since the opener against New Jersey, the Stallions came up flat in a 43-11 spanking at the hands of the Stars who would go on to win the 1984 USFL Championship.

The game against the Stars drew a crowd of 49,500, however, the loss sullied interest in the team for the rest of the season as the club averaged only averaged 27,000 fans per game for their last four home games, despite chalking up a 14–4 record. The decline was also blamed on the USFL&#x27;s decision in May to move to a fall schedule for the 1986 season – a scenario that transpired in several USFL markets.

With their 14–4 mark, the Stallions captured the Southern Division Championship and a berth in the USFL playoffs with a 35–20 win over the Memphis Showboats in Week #17 at a sold-out Liberty Bowl.

In the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals, the Stallions defeated their southern division rivals the Tampa Bay Bandits with a convincing 36–16 win at Legion Field in front of 32,000.

One week later, the Stallions dropped the Eastern Conference Championship, 20–10 to the Philadelphia Stars in a game played at Franklin Field. The venue was moved to the University of Pennsylvania campus when Veterans Stadium was occupied by the Philadelphia Phillies.

==1985 season==

After having a very successful 1984 season and coming to within a win of the USFL Championship game, the Stallions entered 1985 with high hopes. However, the team was nearly derailed in mid-season. On March 4, ESM Government Securities, a Florida-based securities dealer owned by Tampa Bay Bandits co-owner Steve Arky, was raided and shut down by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The ESM raid, and Arky&#x27;s subsequent suicide, triggered a massive run on Home State Savings Bank, the Cincinnati-based savings and loan Warner controlled, resulting in its seizure by Ohio regulators.

With most of his money tied up in either Home State or the Stallions, Warner was forced to give up control of the Stallions just days after Home State&#x27;s collapse. The league had required its owners to post a $1.3 million letter of credit for just such an emergency. Unfortunately, the Stallions&#x27; letter of credit was backed by Home State, rendering it worthless.

In response, team president Jerry Sklar urged the Stallions&#x27; limited partners to chip in more money, and persuaded the city government to buy a $100,000 stake in the team along with a $900,000 credit line. This allowed the Stallions to stay in business and remain in Birmingham.

More or less out of necessity, the Stallions exercised more fiscal responsibility in 1985 and made only minor upgrades to their roster in the off-season. The only notable addition during the off-season was defensive tackle Doug Smith who was a 2nd round pick by the Houston Oilers in 1984. Smith, an Auburn graduate, was a territorial selection of the Stallions in 1984, and signed with the Stallions after being unable to come to a contract agreement with the Oilers.

After acquiring the first overall pick in the 1985 USFL Open Draft, the Stallions selected a wide receiver from Mississippi Valley State University named Jerry Rice. The USFL draft was held in January 1985, however, when the NFL Draft was held four months later, Rice was considered a &quot;project&quot; by several NFL scouting staffs and dropped to the 16th overall pick to the San Francisco 49ers.

Although Rice signed with the 49ers, credit should be given to GM Jerry Sklar and his staff for realizing the potential of Rice well ahead of most other professional scouting staffs.

With the USFL from 18 to 14 teams, the Stallions also acquired some solid depth in safety David Dumars from the Denver Gold, offensive tackle Phil McKinnely from the Memphis Showboats, linebacker Ken Kelley from the Chicago Blitz and defensive back Mickey Sutton from the Pittsburgh Maulers.

Birmingham opened the season, as they did in 1984, by hosting the New Jersey Generals at Legion Field. The game featured the USFL debut of 1984 Heisman Trophy winner Doug Flutie at quarterback for the Generals. In front of 34,785 at Legion Field, the Stallions controlled the majority of the game and won their opener, 38–28 over New Jersey.

The Stallions jumped out to a 5–1 record in 1985 and finished the regular season on a 6-1 clip to claim the Eastern Conference title and the #2 seed in the USFL Playoffs with a 13-5-0 mark. Only the Oakland Invaders had a better record in 1985 with a 13-4-1 record.

Quarterback Cliff Stoudt had a solid season passing for 3,358 yards, 34 touchdowns and 19 interceptions. Stoudt&#x27;s 34 touchdown passes was second only to Houston&#x27;s Jim Kelly who tossed for 39 majors in 1985.

Stoudt&#x27;s primary target in 1985 was wide receiver Jim Smith who had a career year catching a USFL record 20 touchdown passes. Smith caught 87 passes for a league leading 1,322 yards and was named to the USFL All-Star team.

Running back Joe Cribbs recorded his second consecutive 1,000+ yard season with 1,047 yards on 267 carries and 7 touchdowns.

Safety Chuck Clanton also set a professional football record with 16 interceptions in 1985 as he also added 275 returns yards and a major picking off passes. The NFL record of 14 in a season was set in 1952 by Dick &#x27;Night Train&#x27; Lane of the Los Angeles Rams. The CFL record of 15 in a season was set in 1972 by Al Brenner of the Calgary Stampeders.

In the USFL Quarter-Final, the Stallions defeated the visiting Houston Gamblers 22–20, at Legion Field.

The following week, the Stallions hosted the defending champion, and nemesis, the Baltimore Stars at Legion Field. After losing to the Stars in the Eastern Conference final in 1984, the Stallions were hoping to exact revenge, however, they dropped a 28-14 decision to Baltimore in what would eventually be Birmingham&#x27;s last USFL game.

==After football==
A few of those associated with the Stallions made their mark in Birmingham after the league folded:
* Joey Jones, who played wide receiver, coached football at two local high schools. In 2006, he became the first head football coach at Birmingham Southern College since 1939, when football was cancelled as a varsity sport. In 2008, after just one year at BSC, he returned to his hometown of Mobile and started the college football program at the University of South Alabama.
* Joe Cribbs returned to the NFL to finish out his football career. He returned to Birmingham to help those recovering from drug and alcohol addiction.
* Jim Hilyer, an assistant coach, went on to be the first ever football coach at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He would also be an assistant to three other pro football teams to play in Birmingham. After football, he was an instructor in physical fitness at the Birmingham Police Academy.
* Buddy Aydelette is a city councilman with Trussville. Aydelette played offensive lineman for the Stallions and the University of Alabama.

==Other history==
The Stallions were the first pro football team to draft Jerry Rice. They received the first overall pick in the 1985 USFL Draft, due to a trade with the Orlando Renegades. Rice never played in Birmingham.

Among those considered to be Birmingham&#x27;s coach were Bobby Bowden, Gene Stallings, and Hank Stram.

<text>Lagavulin distillery is an Islay single malt Scotch whisky distillery located in the village of Lagavulin on the south of the island of Islay, Scotland.

Lagavulin is owned by Diageo, a multinational beverage alcohol company headquartered in London. It was previously marketed under the &quot;Classic Malts&quot; range of single malts, which is now defunct.

The standard bottling is a 16-year-old, bottled at 43% ABV. They also bottle a Distiller&#x27;s edition, finished in Pedro Ximénez Sherry casks. Alongside these, they regularly release a 12-year-old cask strength version and various older and rarer expressions.

The name &quot;Lagavulin&quot; is an anglicisation of &quot;Lag a&#x27; Mhuilinn&quot;, the Scottish Gaelic for &quot;hollow of the mill&quot;.

== History ==

The distillery of Lagavulin officially dates from 1816, when John Johnston and Archibald Campbell Brooks constructed two distilleries on the site. One of them became Lagavulin, taking over the other—which one is not exactly known. Records show illicit distillation in at least ten illegal distilleries on the site as far back as 1742, however. 

The distillery was run by John Johnston until 1835 at which point the distillery had a valuation of £1,103 9s 8d. (). It was taken over by Alexander Graham who installed his son Walter Graham as the distiller. Walter ran it until 1848 when he moved to Laphroaig and presumably his brother John Crawford Graham took charge. In 1849 improvements were carried out to extend the buildings and provide new roads and access. Later John Crawford Graham entered into a partnership with James Logan Mackie. John Crowford had other business interested in Glasgow and gradually lessened his direct influence over the distillery which left James Logan Mackie in charge from 1856. In 1878 Peter Mackie joined his uncle&#x27;s firm and in the mid-1880s, they established Mackie &amp; Co. to market Lagavulin and other whiskies in London and further afield. Several legal battles ensued with their neighbour Laphroaig, brought about after the distiller at Lagavulin, Peter Mackie, leased the Laphroaig distillery. It is said that Mackie attempted to copy Laphroaig&#x27;s style. Since the water and peat at Lagavulin&#x27;s premises was different from that at Laphroaig&#x27;s, the result did not match. Peter Mackie took over as sole partner in 1889. In 1895 the two businesses amalgamated as Mackie &amp; Co (Distillers) and began to blend White Horse using whisky from Lagavulin. In 1895, Mackie&#x27;s became a limited company. Peter was in charge until 1902 by which time he was in partnership with Andrew Hair Holm. The partnership held a lease of Lagavulin for £800 per year for 50 years. 

The White Horse brand became well-known for its quality and won many awards. In 1908 Mackie and Co were honoured by Royal Warrant Appointment as purveyors of White Horse whisky to King Edward VII. 

In the early 1920s the distillery was sold off by Iain Ramsay to Peter Mackie for £16,000 (). In 1923 the firm was acquired by Buchanan Dewar Ltd who continued with the White Horse brand. The company joined Distillers Company in 1925.

Distillers Company was acquired by Guinness in 1986. Guinness merged with Grand Metropolitan to form Diageo in 1997.

== Production ==

== Accolades ==

International spirits ratings competitions have generally given Lagavulin&#x27;s 16-year spirit extremely high scores. The San Francisco World Spirits Competition, for instance, gave the 16-year four consecutive double gold medals between 2005 and 2008 and has awarded it gold medals in the years since. &quot;Wine Enthusiast Magazine&quot; put the 16-year in its 90–95 point interval in 2004. Spirits ratings aggregator &quot;proof66.com&quot;, which averages scores from the San Francisco Spirits Competition, &quot;Wine Enthusiast&quot;, and others, classifies the spirit in its highest (&quot;Tier 1&quot;) performance category.

** 51 % of The Lagavulin distillery was bought by Ron Swanson in the last episode of the show&#x27;s seventh season, titled &quot;One Last Ride.&quot;
** Following the series, Offerman appeared in several commercials for the product and Lagavulin issued an Offerman edition.
* In The West Wing (season 3, episode 15, titled &#x27;Dead Irish Writers&#x27;), Lagavulin was featured as the drink of choice of Lord John Marbury (Roger Rees).
* Lagavulin 16 was offered to the character Lionel Toussaint (Leslie Odom Jr.) as his preferred drink in &quot;Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery&quot;.

* Lagavulin is ordered by Lisbeth Salander in a bar in Gibraltar near the end of the book, &quot;The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets&#x27; Nest &quot;. She tastes it, then asks for something that could not be used to tar a boat and returns to Tullamore Dew.
* A glass of Lagavulin is purchased by Chrisjen Avasarala for Admiral Souther in Season 2, Episode 2 of The Expanse. She does so by turning to the bartender and saying &quot;get him a proper Scotch please, Lagavulin.&quot; This means that Lagavulin remains a high-end Scotch at least until the year 2350.

<text>Sir George Thomas Napier (30 June 1784 – 16 September 1855) was a British Army officer who saw service in the Peninsular War and later commanded the army of the Cape Colony.

==Life==
He entered the British Army in 1800, and served with distinction under Sir John Moore and the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsula—losing his right arm at the 1812 storming of Ciudad Rodrigo, where, as a major in the 52nd Foot, he led the Light Division&#x27;s storming party.

He became major-general in 1837, KCB in 1838 and lieutenant-general in 1846. He was governor and Commander-In-Chief of the army in the Cape Colony from 1839 to 1843, during which time the abolition of slavery and the expulsion of the Boers from Natal were the chief events. He was offered, but declined, the chief command in India after the Battle of Chillianwalla, and also that of the Sardinian army in 1849. He became full general in 1854. He died at Geneva, Switzerland on 16 September 1855, aged 71.

His autobiography, &quot;Passages in the Early Military Life of General Sir G.T. Napier&quot;, was published by his surviving son, General William Craig Emilius Napier (the author of an important work on outpost duty) in 1885.

The town of Napier, Western Cape, and also Napier House at Fairbairn College, Goodwood, Cape Town, are named after Sir George Thomas Napier.

<text>Ralf Schumann (born 10 June 1962) is a former German 25 m rapid fire pistol shooter. He is a three-time Olympic Champion and twice the World Champion. One of the most decorated shooters of the modern era, he is the first of two sport shooters to have won three Olympic gold medals in one individual event (25 metre rapid fire pistol) and became the first of three sport shooters to have won three Olympic individual gold medals. He won the gold medals for the 25 metre rapid fire pistol event at the 1992, 1996 and 2004 Olympics and also won two silver medals at this event, becoming the most successful Olympic shooter at this event. Schumann participated in seven consecutive Olympic Games from 1988 to 2012, setting a new record for most Olympic appearances by a German athlete.

==Career==
His international breakthrough came in the years before the Seoul Olympics in 1988, where he was considered the most likely winner. However, he was beaten by Afanasijs Kuzmins of the Soviet Union (later Latvia) by 598 to 597 in the qualification round, and could not close the gap in the finals as Kuzmins achieved a perfect 100. 
After this, the targets were changed, lowering results considerably, but Schumann&#x27;s hegemony has only increased. He won the 1990 World Championships and the 1992 Olympics. He scored 596 points on several occasions before raising the World Record to 597 in 1995, which he equalled in 2000. After the major rule change in 2005, he beat the world record again with 588 points, bettered by Sergei Alifirenko later the same year. He also held the pre-2005 final World Record and the Olympic records (from 1996), excelling in the four-second final shooting.

Being the favourite in every competition he entered, it was natural that his failures to win received some attention. Most notable among these is his performance in the Sydney Olympics in 2000, when at the prospect of winning his third Olympic gold medal (something no RFP shooter before has managed) he only finished fifth. However, his results since then have proved that this was not the beginning of a long-term decline, and in the Athens Olympics in 2004, he finally won his third Olympic gold.

==Sponsorships==
Ralf has worked as a precision mechanic during his shooting career, and his employers have sponsored his competitive shooting by offering Ralf a 3-month paid leave of absence each year to train. He also designed a custom .22 caliber pistol which is sold by Italian manufacturer Pardini.

==Personal life==
Schumann was born in Meissen in Saxony. He took up pistol shooting in 1977 and was eventually trained at the East German national shooting arena in Suhl, Thuringia. He has on several occasions been voted the athlete of the year in Thuringia. He now lives in nearby Stockheim, Bavaria. His wife, Anke Völker-Schumann is also a shooter; she joined Ralf in competing at the 1988, 1996, and 2000 Olympics.

<text>Gérald Tremblay (born September 20, 1942) is a former Canadian politician and businessman who served as mayor of Montreal from 2002 until his resignation in 2012. He also served as president of the Montreal Metropolitan Community. Before becoming mayor he had a long career in business and management. Tremblay resigned as Mayor on November 5, 2012, following allegations of corruption made at the Charbonneau Commission.

==Early life and career==
Born in Ottawa, Ontario, Tremblay grew up in Montreal, where his family moved when he was four years old. His parents, Georges Albert Tremblay, a notary, and Rollande Forest, had four boys: Michel, Gérald, Marcel, and François. He obtained a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Ottawa in 1969, and was admitted to the Bar of Quebec in 1970. He earned a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Harvard Business School in 1972.

He was a professor and lecturer at HEC Montréal from 1974 to 1977.

He then served as a senior manager in several companies. He worked at a consulting firm from 1977 to 1981, the &quot;Fédération des caisses d&#x27;entraide économique du Québec&quot; from 1981 to 1982, as well as various businesses in the hospitality and retail industry from 1982 to 1986 and the Société de développement industriel from 1986 to 1989. He was also a member of the board of directors of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec and Hydro-Québec, as well as the governor of the Quebec MBA Association.

He was elected as the Liberal MNA for Outremont in 1989. He first sat in the National Assembly and served as Minister of Industry, Commerce, Science and Technology in the Bourassa Cabinet from October 11, 1989, to January 11, 1994, and in the Johnson Jr. Cabinet from January 11 to September 26, 1994.

He was re-elected to the National Assembly in September 1994, and was named president of the &quot;Commission de l&#x27;économie et du travail&quot; from December 1, 1994, until his resignation on April 15, 1996.

After his second term in the legislature and up until his election as mayor on November 4, 2001, Tremblay returned to the private sector. He taught again at HEC Montréal, worked at Monitor Company and Rolland, and sat on the board of directors of various companies. He was also a successful entrepreneur, setting up a chain of specialty boutiques called &quot;Dans un Jardin&quot; which sold mostly perfume, but also jam, and other small delicacies. He also served as president of World Skills 1999, held in Montreal.

Gérald Tremblay and his wife, Suzanne Tailleur, were married on November 24, 1979, and four years later adopted twins, Marie-Laurence and Georges-Etienne.

==Mayoral career==

Tremblay ran for mayor of Montreal after the controversial merging of the 29 municipalities that made up the Montreal Urban Community (MUC) into one single city spanning the entire island of Montreal, which caused then-mayor Pierre Bourque, who was associated with orchestrating the merger, to call an election. Tremblay&#x27;s municipal political party was known as the Montreal Island Citizens Union (now known as Union Montréal), and his election campaign was based on re-evaluating the merger and decentralizing the city structure. In the 2001 election, shortly after the towns on the island of Montreal had been forcibly merged into a new Island-wide city of Montreal, Tremblay campaigned as the defender of towns and cities. He received a great deal of support from opponents of the amalgamation. He was elected mayor on November 4, 2001, with the support of a diverse coalition, formed mostly of opponents of the merger.

However, in the subsequent referendum on the question of demerger, he was accused of betraying his supporters by coming out strongly in favour of the &quot;no&quot; side, supporting the megacity.

On November 6, 2005, Gérald Tremblay won his second term in office, easily winning against long-time rival Pierre Bourque by 74,646 votes. The voter turn-out estimated at 39.13% was the lowest ever in the history of the Montreal municipal elections. (See 2005 Quebec municipal elections).

Since he took office, Tremblay has streamlined the city&#x27;s operations but also generated controversy in some quarters. While his administration improved public consultation mechanisms, it is also considered by many to be one of the most secretive administrations in Montreal history, causing some to declare that the democratic deficit has grown during his tenure despite improvements to consultation.

In 2006, Tremblay was appointed vice president for North America of United Cities and Local Governments and re-elected vice president of the International Association of Francophone Mayors.

Gérald Tremblay was re-elected for a third term on November 1, 2009, with 37.90% of the vote. He defeated Louise Harel (32.73%) of Vision Montreal and Richard Bergeron (25.45%) of Projet Montréal. The 2009 campaign focused on ethics and governance in the wake of the scandal of water meters and collusion in the awarding of contracts in infrastructure.

===Criticism===

His administration decentralized the city by giving more power to the boroughs. He has been criticized by suburban mayors who decry his clear preference for Montreal to receive a much larger share of the island&#x27;s tax revenues than it would have had the merger not taken place. However, many argue that these boroughs are even less responsive to the public than City Hall, since they are not required to offer public consultations on their decisions. Nevertheless, the public can (and sometimes does) force referendums on particular bylaw proposals.

Tremblay received criticism for his proposal to change the name of &quot;Avenue du Parc&quot; to &quot;Avenue Robert-Bourassa&quot;, in honour of former Quebec premier Robert Bourassa, without public consultation. The proposal was approved by City Council in a vote on November 29, 2006. Much of the criticism of the proposal came from residents and businesses who inhabit Avenue du Parc. On February 6, 2007, Mayor Tremblay backed away from his position on Avenue du Parc after losing the support of Bourassa&#x27;s family. In a press conference on the issue, the mayor claimed to &quot;have learned that the opinion of citizens is important.&quot;

===Resignation===
During a hearing at the Charbonneau Commission on October 1, 2012, construction industry contractor Lino Zambito alleged that Tremblay&#x27;s party, Union Montreal received a sum equivalent to 3% of the value of sewerage rehabilitation contracts awarded by the City of Montreal to a mafia-linked cartel.

On October 30, 2012, a former Union Montreal party organizer alleged that Mayor Tremblay was involved in illegal financing with the mafia. He claimed that Tremblay knew of these dubious financial practices and did not want to be made aware of them. These statements caused a series of negative reactions from the spokes people of all the provincial political parties.

Following the allegations, Tremblay announced that he would be taking a few days off. On November 5, 2012, Tremblay announced that he was resigning as mayor, and was leaving politics.

<text>Cael Norman Sanderson ( ; born June 20, 1979) is an American former folkstyle and freestyle wrestler who is the current head coach of Penn State&#x27;s wrestling team. As a wrestler, he won an Olympic gold medal and was undefeated in four years of college wrestling at Iowa State (159–0), becoming a four-time NCAA Division I champion (1999–2002).

Sanderson is the only wrestler in NCAA Division I history to go undefeated in official matches with more than 100 wins. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named his college career as the second most impressive college sports feat of all-time, behind the setting of four world records by Jesse Owens in a single hour at the 1935 Big Ten track and field conference championship meet.

==Early life==
Sanderson was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, to Steve and Debbie Sanderson, Cael attended Wasatch High School in Heber City, Utah, where he was coached by his father, a former wrestler at Brigham Young University. As a high school wrestler, Sanderson was a four-time Utah state champion (1994–97) and compiled a record of 127–3.

==Wrestling career==
=== College ===
After graduating from high school, Sanderson followed his brothers, Cody and Cole, to Iowa State. After redshirting the 1997-98 college wrestling season, Sanderson won all 39 of his matches to win his first NCAA and Big 12 Conference titles at 184 pounds. He was also the first freshman in NCAA history to be named the Outstanding Wrestler at nationals. His next three seasons were virtually identical, compiling 40 wins and no losses in each and finishing with the only perfect record in NCAA Division I history at 159-0. By winning all of his matches, he became only the second wrestler in history to that point to win four NCAA Division I titles. He was also named the Outstanding Wrestler in all NCAA tournaments he competed in. He did lose 1 match in his career while redshirting and wrestling unattached at the UNI open to Paul Glynn of Iowa. As he was redshirting and wrestling unattached, it did not count against his overall record of 159-0.

Sanderson was a three-time Dan Hodge Trophy winner (collegiate wrestling&#x27;s equivalent to the Heisman Trophy), being the first to win the award multiple times and the only person to win it three times. For his performance as a senior in 2002, he received the Wade Schalles Award for best collegiate pinner. He holds the longest win-streak across all NCAA divisions. This makes him the most accomplished collegiate wrestler ever.

In 2017, Sanderson was inducted into the Iowa State Hall of Fame.

=== Freestyle ===
Sanderson was a two-time US Cadet World Team Member, placing third and fourth in 1994 and 1995, respectively. He was also a US University National Champion in 1999 and a University World Champion in 2000.

He became the US National Champion in 2001, 2002 and 2003. He was also an original US World Team Member in 2001 and 2002, however, he chose not to participate at the 01&#x27; World Championships to focus in folkstyle, and the USA team chose to not compete in 2002.

In 2003, he won the Manitoba Open in Canada in February, placed second at the World Cup in April, third at the 2003 Pan American Games and second at the World Championships. In 2004, he once again claimed the Manitoba Open title and won the US Olympic Team Trials.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Sanderson claimed wins over Magomed Kurugliyev, Siarhei Borchanka, Majid Khodaei, Yoel Romero and Moon Eui-jae to become an Olympic Gold medalist in Athens, Greece.

While already a full-time coach at Penn State, Sanderson came out of retirement in 2011 and took home an Ion Corneanu Memorial title, won the US World Team Trials and placed fifth at the World Championships.

In 2011, Sanderson was inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame as a Distinguished Member.

<text>Zuph means &quot;honeycomb&quot; in Hebrew

* According to the Books of Chronicles, a Kohathite Levite, a fact not mentioned in the books of Samuel. He was the ancestor of Elkanah and Samuel (1 Samuel 1:1); called also Zophai in the parallel passage, (or in Hebrew Bible). 
* Land of Zuph (), a district in which lay Samuel&#x27;s city, Ramathaim-Zophim. It was probably so named after Zuph (). Zuph and the city of Ramathaim-Zophim are mentioned in the Bible together with Mount Ephraim, suggesting that they shared a similar locality.

<text>7 Iris is a large main-belt asteroid and possible remnant planetesimal orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. It is the fourth-brightest object in the asteroid belt. 7 Iris is classified as an S-type asteroid, meaning that it has a stony composition.

==Discovery and name==
Iris was discovered on 13 August 1847, by J. R. Hind from London, UK. It was Hind&#x27;s first asteroid discovery and the seventh asteroid to be discovered overall. It was named after the rainbow goddess Iris in Greek mythology, who was a messenger to the gods, especially Hera. Her quality of attendant of Hera was particularly appropriate to the circumstances of discovery, as Iris was spotted following 3 Juno by less than an hour of right ascension (Juno is the Roman equivalent of Hera).

Iris&#x27;s original symbol was a rainbow and a star: or more simply . It is in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1CEC1 𜻁 ().

==Characteristics==
===Geology===
Iris is an S-type asteroid. The surface is bright and is probably a mixture of nickel-iron metals and magnesium- and iron-silicates. Its spectrum is similar to that of L and LL chondrites with corrections for space weathering, so it may be an important contributor of these meteorites. Planetary dynamics also indicates that it should be a significant source of meteorites.

Among the S-type asteroids, Iris ranks fifth in mean diameter after Eunomia, Juno, Amphitrite and Herculina. Its shape is consistent with an oblate spheroid with a large equatorial excavation, suggesting it is a remnant planetesimal. No collisional family can be associated with Iris, likely because the excavating impact occurred early in the history of the Solar System, and the debris has since dispersed.

===Brightness===

Iris&#x27;s bright surface and small distance from the Sun make it the fourth-brightest object in the asteroid belt after Vesta, Ceres, and Pallas. It has a &quot;mean&quot; opposition magnitude of +7.8, comparable to that of Neptune, and can easily be seen with binoculars at most oppositions. At typical oppositions it marginally outshines the larger though darker Pallas. But at rare oppositions near perihelion Iris can reach a magnitude of +6.7 (last time on 31 October 2017, reaching a magnitude of +6.9), which is as bright as Ceres ever gets.

===Surface features===
A study by Hanus et al. using data from the VLT&#x27;s SPHERE instrument names eight craters 20 to 40 km in diameter, and seven recurring features of unknown nature that remain nameless due to a lack of consistency and their occurrence on the edge of Iris. The names are Greek names of colors, corresponding to the rainbow as the sign of Iris. It is unknown whether these names are under consideration by the IAU. The other 7 features are labeled A through G.

===Rotation===
Iris has a rotational period of 7.14 hours. Iris’ north pole points towards the ecliptic coordinates (λ, β) estimated to be (18°, +19°) with a 4° uncertainty (Viikinkoski et al. 2017) or (19°, +26°) with a 3° uncertainty (Hanuš et al. 2019). This gives an axial tilt of 85°, so that on much of each hemisphere, the sun does not set during summer, and does not rise during winter. On an airless body this gives rise to very large temperature differences.

==Observations==

Iris was observed occulting a star on 26 May 1995, and later on 25 July 1997. Both observations gave a diameter of about 200 km.

In February 2024, water molecules were discovered on 7 Iris, alongside 20 Massalia, marking the first time water molecules were detected on asteroids.

<doc id="637172" wikidata="Q381851" url="?curid=637172" title="John I, Duke of Brittany">
<text>John I (, ; 1217/12188 October 1286), known as John the Red due to the colour of his beard, was Duke of Brittany from 1221 to his death and 2nd Earl of Richmond in 1268.

John was the eldest of three children born to Duchess Alix and her husband and co-ruler, Duke Peter I. He became duke upon his mother&#x27;s death in 1221. His father, who had reigned as duke due to his marriage to Alix, ruled as regent until John reached adulthood. In 1268, Henry III granted the earldom of Richmond to John, and the title continued in his family, through frequent temporary forfeitures and reversions, until 1342.

He experienced a number of conflicts with the Bishop of Nantes and the Breton clergy. In 1240, he issued an edict expelling Jews from the duchy and cancelling all debts to them. He joined Louis IX of France in the Eighth Crusade in 1270, and survived the plague that killed the king. The duchy of Brittany experienced a century of peace, beginning with John I and ending with Duke John III&#x27;s reign in 1341.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1236 John married Infanta Blanche, daughter of King Theobald I of Navarre. They had the following surviving issue:

*John II, Duke of Brittany (1239–1305), married Beatrice of England and had issue.
*Peter (1241–1268), Lord of Dinan, Hade, Léon, Hennebont and La Roche-Derrien.
*Alix (1243–1288), Dame de Pontarcy; married John of Châtillon, Count of Blois.
*Theobald (1245–1246), interred in the church abbey of Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys.
*Theobald (1247died young), interred in the church abbey of Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys.
*Eleanor (1248died young), interred in the church abbey of Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys.
*Nicolas (1249–1251), interred in the church abbey of Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys.
*Robert (1251–1259), interred in the church abbey of Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys.

<doc id="637177" wikidata="Q423439" url="?curid=637177" title="Cerivastatin">
<text>Cerivastatin (INN, brand names: Baycol, Lipobay) is a synthetic member of the class of statins used to lower cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular disease. It was marketed by the pharmaceutical company Bayer A.G. in the late 1990s, competing with Pfizer&#x27;s highly successful atorvastatin (Lipitor). Cerivastatin was voluntarily withdrawn from the market worldwide in 2001, due to reports of fatal rhabdomyolysis.

During postmarketing surveillance, 52 deaths were reported in patients using cerivastatin, mainly from rhabdomyolysis and its resultant kidney failure. Risks were higher in patients using fibrates, mainly gemfibrozil (Lopid), and in patients using the highest (0.8 mg/day) dose of cerivastatin. Bayer A.G. added a contraindication for the concomitant use of cerivastatin and gemfibrozil to the package 18 months after the drug interaction was found. The frequency of deadly cases of rhabdomyolysis with cerivastatin was 16 to 80 times higher than with other statins. Another 385 nonfatal cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. This put the risk of this (rare) complication at 5-10 times that of the other statins. Cerivastatin also induced myopathy in a dose-dependent manner when administered as monotherapy, but that was revealed only after Bayer was sued and unpublished company documents were opened.

== Structure and reactivity ==
Cerivastatin consists of a fluorophenyl linked to a pyridine. The pyridine has two isopropyl groups, one methoxy group and a dihydroxyheptanoic acid side chain. The dihydroxyheptanoic acid group is the functional part of the molecule. This part will bind to the HMG-CoA reductase making it unavailable for HMG-CoA. Cerivastatin is a pure synthetic drug, produced to create a more potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Cerivastatin was the most potent inhibitor with an inhibitory constant of 0.5 μg/L, which made it already effective at a low dose. It is taken up orally as tablets, where it is combined with sodium salt. The IUPAC name is then (+)-(3R,5S,6E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2,6-diisopropyl-5-methoxymethylpyridin-3-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid monosodium salt. Cerivastatin sodium (C22H33FNO3Na) is administered orally via a tablet. The molecular weight is 481.5 g/mol. It is odorless and it is soluble in water, methanol and ethanol. Under acidic circumstances, it undergoes cyclization to form pyridinolactone.

== Mechanism of action ==
Five main classes of agents can be used to treat hyperlipidemia, a condition that comes with high cholesterol levels. Those are bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid, fibric acid derivatives, probucol and HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors. Cerivastatin mainly acts by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA-reductase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme step in cholesterol biosynthesis. It occurs during the mevalonate pathway in the liver, where hydroxylmethylglutaryl is converted to mevalonate.
Cerivastatin is a synthetic and enantiomerically pure inhibitor of the reductase, meaning it can fit into the enzyme&#x27;s active site, and therefore compete with the substrate HMG-CoA, which is the native substrate for the reductase. Due to the competition, the rate of mevalonate production by the enzyme is reduced. This also means that the rates subsequent biosynthesis is reduced, since less starting material is available. Eventually, this will lead to lower cholesterol levels.

The location of cholesterol biosynthesis and inhibition of HMG-CoA is of significance, since most circulating cholesterol originates from internal production, rather than the diet. If the liver cannot produce more cholesterol, the cholesterol levels in the blood will decrease. Also, HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors cause secondary up-regulation of hepatic LDL receptors, with increased LDL-cholesterol clearance and reduction of both total and LDL cholesterol in the serum.

== Metabolism ==
Cerivastatin is metabolized via the hepatic pathway. &quot;In vitro&quot; studies with human liver cells showed that two metabolic pathways are equally important; demethylation of the benzylic methyl ether and hydroxylation at one methyl group of the 6-isopropyl substituent. Demethylation is catalysed by the enzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, which generates a metabolite that is known as M-1 in the cerivastatin metabolite pathway. Hydroxylation is catalysed by CYP2C8, which generates the major active metabolite, M-23. M-1 and M-23 are, like cerivastatin, pharmacologically active, with comparable potencies. Combination of the latter leads to another minor metabolite, that is not detectable in plasma, which is also known as M-24. Following a 0.8 mg dose of cerivastatin, the mean steady state Cmax values for cerivastatin, M-1 and M-23 were 12.7, 0.55 and 1.4 μg/L, respectively. Hence, it can be concluded that the cholesterol-lowering effect is mostly due to the cerivastatin itself.

== Efficacy, toxicity and side effects ==
=== Efficacy and toxicity ===
The inhibitory activity of cerivastatin was compared to that of other statins, specifically lovastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin. This comparison was made by determining the IC50 values of each compound. These values were 77 nM, 66 nM and 176 nM for these statins, respectively, while the value for cerivastatin was found to be 1.1 nM.
Using Dixon plots, the inhibitory constant of cerivastatin was found to be 1.3 x 10-9 M, which is over 100 times lower than the inhibitory constant of lovastatin, known to be 150 x 10-9 M.
To compare cerivastatin activity to that of other statins, its IC25 value was also determined for various types of human smooth muscle cells: cells from the left internal mammary artery (HSMC), cornea fibroblasts (HCF), myoblasts from striated muscle (HM) and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The activity in these groups of muscle cells was compared to the activity of the statins listed above, as well as atorvastatin and fluvastatin.

The pharmacological results from cerivastatin show that it is the most active HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor among reported statins. Due to its high enzyme affinity, it would seem to offer ultra-low dose therapy in the microgram range. However, due to its relatively severe adverse effects in comparison to other statins, its market use was discontinued.

The strengths of the available cerivastatin medicine ranged from 0.2 - 0.8 mg, resulting in an actual dose of 1.9 - 13.1 μg/kg body weight for which rhabdomyolysis has been reported. Although the mechanism of the cerivastatin induced myopathy is not exactly known, the risk increases with statin dose. This risk also appears to increase among patients who received gemfibrozil or lovastatin concomitantly, and there is a known interaction between these drugs and cerivastatin. There are 31 cerivastatin-related deaths reported in the US and a further 21 deaths worldwide. There were also 385 cases of non-fatal rhabdomyolysis reported among the estimated 700.000 users in the USA. In 12 of the 31 reported deaths of cerivastatin-related rhabdomyolysis in the US the cerivastatin-gemfibrozil interaction was implicated, while in 7 of the 31 fatal cases in the US, cerivastatin was combined with lovastatin. The reporting rate of fatal rhabdomyolysis in association with cerivastatin monotherapy is 1.9 per million prescriptions, which is 10-50 times as high as for other statins.

=== Adverse effects ===
Cerivastatin was generally found to be well tolerated, side effects being rare. Minor side effects include diarrhea, fatigue, gas, heartburn, nasal congestion and headache. Patients with alcoholic or other liver diseases were advised to use cerivastatin with caution.

<doc id="637178" wikidata="Q453989" url="?curid=637178" title="John II, Duke of Brittany">
<text>John II (; ; 123918 November 1305) reigned as Duke of Brittany from 1286 until his death, and was also Earl of Richmond in the Peerage of England. He took part in two crusades prior to his accession to the ducal throne. As a duke, John was involved in the conflicts between the kings of France and England. He was crushed to death in an accident during the celebrations of a papal coronation.
==Life==
John was the eldest son of Duke John I of Brittany and Blanche of Navarre. On 22 January 1260, he married Beatrice, a daughter of King Henry III of England. John was very close to his brother-in-law, Edward I. In 1271, he accompanied Edward to the Ninth Crusade, meeting there with his father and King Louis IX of France. Louis succumbed to an illness in Tunis, and John&#x27;s father returned to Brittany. John, however, followed Edward to Palestine. The crusade ended the following year, having achieved little. In 1285, John took part in the Aragonese Crusade at the side of King Philip III of France.

Upon the death of his father on 8 October 1286, John succeeded him as duke of Brittany, inheriting also the Earldom of Richmond in the Peerage of England. His namesake son was governing Aquitaine in the name of his uncle EdwardI, when King PhilipIV declared Edward&#x27;s rule forfeit in May 1294 after Edward&#x27;s refusal to stand before the Parlement of Paris over fishing disputes the previous year that had escalated into naval warfare between the two countries. John assisted his brother-in-law in the ensuing Gascon War but suffered only defeats. When the English army sought to recover by plundering the Breton Abbaye Saint-Mathieu de Fine-Terre in 1296, however, John abandoned Edward&#x27;s cause. In response, Edward deprived him of the earldom. John proceeded to ally himself with the French, arranging a marriage between his grandson John and King Philip&#x27;s cousin Isabella of Valois. Philip then raised him into the Peerage of France in September 1297. During the negotiations over the final Treaty of Paris ending the war, John was among Philip&#x27;s chief negotiators with the English.

From 1294 until 1304, John assisted the King of France in his campaign against Count Guy of Flanders, taking part in the decisive Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle. Following King Philip&#x27;s victory, in 1305, John travelled to Lyon to attend the coronation of Pope Clement V. John was leading the Pope&#x27;s horse through the crowd during the celebrations. So many spectators had piled atop the walls that one of them crumbled and collapsed on top of the Duke. He died four days later, on 18 November. His body was placed in a lead coffin and sent down the Loire. He was buried on 16 December in the Carmelite convent he had founded in Ploërmel.

== Issue ==
John and Beatrice had six children, several of whom were raised at the English court of their uncle EdwardI.
* Arthur II, Duke of Brittany (1262–1312)
* John, Earl of Richmond (c. 1266–1334)
* Marie, wife of Guy III of Châtillon (1268–1339)
* Peter, Viscount of Leon (1269–1312)
* Blanche, wife of Philip of Artois (1271–1327)
* Eleanor of Brittany, Abbess of Fontevrault (1275–1342)

<doc id="637186" wikidata="Q119203" url="?curid=637186" title="Granola">
<text>Granola is a food consisting of rolled oats, nuts, seeds, honey or other sweeteners such as brown sugar, and sometimes puffed rice, that is usually baked until crisp, toasted and golden brown. The mixture is stirred while baking to avoid burning and to maintain a loose breakfast cereal consistency. Dried fruit, such as raisins and dates, and confections such as chocolate are sometimes added. Granola is often eaten in combination with yogurt, honey, fresh fruit (such as bananas, strawberries or blueberries), milk or other forms of cereal. It also serves as a topping for various pastries, desserts or ice cream. Muesli is similar to granola, except that it is traditionally neither sweetened nor baked.

Granola is sometimes taken when hiking, camping, or backpacking because it is nutritious, lightweight, high in calories, and easy to store (properties that make it similar to trail mix and muesli). Manufacturers also add honey, corn syrup, or maple syrup to it and compress it into granola bars, which make it easy to carry for packed lunches, hiking, or other outdoor activities.

== History ==

Granula was invented in Dansville, New York, by Dr. James Caleb Jackson at the Jackson Sanitarium in 1863. The Jackson Sanitarium was a prominent health spa that operated into the early 20th century on the hillside overlooking Dansville. It was also known as Our Home on the Hillside; thus the company formed to sell Jackson&#x27;s cereal was known as the Our Home Granula Company. Granula was composed of Graham flour and was similar to an oversized form of Grape-Nuts. A similar cereal was developed by John Harvey Kellogg. It was also initially known as Granula, but the name was changed to Granola to avoid legal problems with Jackson.

The food and name were revived in the 1960s, and fruits and nuts were added to it to make it a health food that was popular with the health and nature-oriented hippie movement. Due to this connection, the descriptors &quot;granola&quot; and &quot;crunchy-granola&quot; have entered colloquial use as a way to label people and things associated with the movement.

Another major promoter was Layton Gentry, profiled in &quot;Time&quot; as &quot;Johnny Granola-Seed&quot;. In 1964, Gentry sold the rights to a granola recipe using oats, which he claimed to have invented himself, to Sovex Natural Foods for $3,000. The company was founded in 1953 in Holly, Michigan by the Hurlinger family with the main purpose of producing a concentrated paste of brewers yeast and soy sauce known as &quot;Sovex&quot;. Earlier in 1964, it had been bought by John Goodbrad and moved to Collegedale, Tennessee. In 1967, Gentry bought back the rights for west of the Rockies for $1,500 and then sold the west coast rights to Wayne Schlotthauer of Lassen Foods in Chico, California, for $18,000. Lassen was founded from a health food bakery run by Schlotthauer&#x27;s father-in-law.

In 1969, during Woodstock, Lisa Law asked the festival organizers for $3,000 to buy, in New York City, rolled oats, bulgar wheat, wheat germ, dried apricots, currants, almonds, soy sauce, and honey to make muesli. Volunteers fed circa 130,000 people with Dixie cups.&lt;ref name=&quot;americanhistory.si.edu/lisalaw/7&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, an executive at Pet Milk, St. Louis, Missouri, introduced Heartland Natural Cereal, the first major commercial granola. At almost the same time, the Quaker Oats Company introduced Quaker 100% Natural Granola. Quaker was threatened with legal action by Gentry, and they subsequently changed the name of their product to Harvest Crunch. Within a year, Kellogg&#x27;s had introduced its &quot;Country Morning&quot; granola cereal and General Mills had introduced its &quot;Nature Valley&quot;. In 1974, McKee Baking (later McKee Foods), makers of Little Debbie snack cakes, purchased Sovex. In 1998, the company also acquired the Heartland brand and moved its manufacturing to Collegedale. In 2004, Sovex&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Blue Planet Foods&quot;.

== Granola bar ==

Granola bars (or muesli bars) have become popular as a snack, similar to the traditional flapjack familiar in the British Isles and Newfoundland. Granola bars consist of granola mixed with honey or other sweetened syrup, pressed and baked into a bar shape, resulting in the production of a more convenient snack. The product is most popular in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, parts of southern Europe, Brazil, Israel, South Africa, and Japan.

==Matzo granola==
Matzo granola is a breakfast food eaten by some Jewish people during the holiday of Passover. It consists of broken up matzo pieces in place of oats. Many variations are possible by adding other ingredients.

==Trademark==
The names &quot;Granula&quot; and &quot;Granola&quot; were registered trademarks in the late 19th century United States for foods consisting of sweetened whole grain products crumbled and then baked until crisp. The name is now a trademark only in Australia and New Zealand. However, the use of the term granola in Australia was clarified in 2012 when Sanitarium Health foods alleged trademark infringement by the word&#x27;s usage on the product labels of Irrewarra sourdough. The Federal Court of Australia concluded that use of the word granola had become commonplace and could not infringe Sanitarium&#x27;s right to the term when used to describe the product itself, rather than as a trademark.

<text>Beyond Borders is a 2003 American romantic-drama film about aid workers, directed by Martin Campbell and starring Angelina Jolie, Clive Owen, Teri Polo and Kate Ashfield. The original music score was composed by James Horner.

Reflecting Jolie&#x27;s real-life interest in promoting humanitarian relief, the film was critically and financially unsuccessful. The film was marketed with the tagline &quot;In a place she didn&#x27;t belong, among people she never knew, she found a way to make a difference.&quot;

Concurrently with the release of the film, Jolie published &quot;Notes from My Travels&quot;, a collection of journal entries from her real-life experiences as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) — similar to her character in the film.

==Plot==

While attending a fund-raising gala, Sarah Jordan, a naive, married American socialite living in England, witnesses a fiery plea delivered by an intruder – a renegade humanitarian, Dr. Nick Callahan. His plea made on behalf of impoverished children under his care turns Sarah&#x27;s life upside down. Attracted to Nick and his cause, she impulsively abandons her job at an art gallery and sheltered life in England to do what she can to aid his efforts at the refugee camps. She travels to Ethiopia bringing with her a caravan of essential medical supplies to the impossibly remote camp, where she finds Nick and his closest colleague, Dr. Elliott Hauser.

As Sarah&#x27;s work based in England takes her to other volatile areas, where few people have traveled and even fewer have survived, she discovers that the harsh realities she encounters, and her persistent romantic attraction to the charismatic, unpredictable doctor, ignite in her a burning passion for saving lives, while risking her own in the process. She works for humanitarian and human rights organizations for ten years after first traveling to Ethiopia. At Dr Hauser&#x27;s urging, she helps with another key shipment blocked by warring factions and corruption, and again finds Nick, now in the border region of Cambodia and Vietnam. Here she discovers the same nexus of war and refugee suffering but even more tightly bound than in Ethiopia. Khmer Rouge forces terrorize the camp, and Dr. Hauser is killed in a successful effort to free the camp from their grip. Upon her return to London, she gives birth to Nick&#x27;s daughter and eventually is appointed the regional representative for the United Kingdom for the U.N.H.C.R.

At the same time, Nick now finds himself inevitably caught up in the humanitarian crisis in Chechnya, and goes missing. Sarah realizes she must find him a third time and tell him he is a father, and that she can never forget him. As they desperately escape his captors, she defiantly refuses to abandon him and dies in a landmine which Nick survives. The film ends with Nick arriving at Sarah and Henry&#x27;s home in England to first meet his young daughter.

Oliver Stone was initially attached as director and producer. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, and Meg Ryan were considered for the role of Sarah Jordan Beauford, while Kevin Costner and Ralph Fiennes were considered for Dr. Nick Callahan.

The film was shot on location in Thailand, Namibia, and Canada.

==Reception==
&quot;Beyond Borders&quot; received negative reviews from critics, as the movie currently holds a 14% &quot;rotten&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 103 reviews. Critical consensus on the film has it that &quot;&quot;Beyond Borders&quot; is good-intentioned, but the use of human suffering as a backdrop for a romance comes across as sanctimonious and exploitative.&quot;

It was nominated for the Political Film Society Award for Peace, losing to &quot;Sandstorm&quot;. Angelina Jolie received a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress nomination for her performances in this and &quot;Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life&quot;, but lost to Jennifer Lopez for &quot;Gigli&quot;.

<text>Michael M. Rozier (born March 1, 1961) is an American former football running back who played in the United States Football League (USFL) for two seasons and the National Football League (NFL) for seven seasons from 1985 to 1991. He played college football for the Coffeyville Red Ravens before transferring to the Nebraska Cornhuskers, where he won the Heisman Trophy in 1983. Afterward, he played for the Pittsburgh Maulers and the Jacksonville Bulls of the USFL, then played for the Houston Oilers and the Atlanta Falcons of the NFL. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Early life==
Rozier was born in Camden, New Jersey.
He attended Woodrow Wilson High School in Camden, where he was a standout high school football player. Today, the football field bears his name.

==College career==
Rozier went largely unnoticed by most of the major college programs. His recruitment to Nebraska was a complete accident. Former Nebraska head coach Frank Solich, at the time an assistant to head coach Tom Osborne, had been a keen observer of high school game films. While watching film of Pennsauken&#x27;s game against nearby Woodrow Wilson High School, one player on the opposing team (Rozier) continually caught Solich&#x27;s eye.

Rozier spent his freshman season at Coffeyville Junior College in Kansas, in order to get his grades up. In his one season with the Coffeyville Ravens, he led them to a 9–0 season in 1980, gaining 1157 yards with a gaudy 7.4 yards-per-carry average, and scored ten touchdowns.

As a sophomore in 1981, Rozier first dazzled Husker fans with a 93-yard touchdown run against Kansas State. As the season progressed, Rozier began challenging Roger Craig for the starting position, a job he would eventually win in the fall of 1982 prior to his junior year. Rozier&#x27;s progress was so pronounced that the talented and established Craig moved to fullback.

During his junior season, Rozier broke Bobby Reynolds&#x27;s long-standing school record for rushing yards in a single season, with 1,689 yards, and led Nebraska to a second consecutive outright Big 8 title and a 12–1 record, losing only in controversial fashion to eventual national champion Penn State. In a performance against Missouri, Rozier came off the bench in the second half to rush for 139 yards on 17 carries to lead Nebraska to a comeback victory despite suffering from a painful hip-pointer injury. Rozier finished the 1982 season a consensus All-American and finished 10th in the Heisman voting.

As a senior, Nebraska&#x27;s high-octane offense was often unstoppable, averaging 52 points and 401 rushing yards per game. Rozier had a nation&#x27;s best 2,486 total yards with 2,148 of those coming on the ground and twenty-nine touchdowns scored. His 7.8 yards-per-carry mark on the season stands as the third-highest mark for players with more than 214 carries in a season. Against Kansas, Rozier rushed for 230 yards in the first half and finished with 285 rushing yards total, at that time a school record. Rozier went over 200 yards in each of his last four regular-season games of the 1983 season. His senior season was capped when he was awarded the Heisman Trophy, given to the best individual player in college football and was again an All-American.

His college career would end in disappointment, losing the 1984 Orange Bowl in which Miami defeated Nebraska 31-30 for the national championship. Rozier had 138 yards on 21 carries at halftime against a Miami Hurricanes team with the second-ranked defense in football, but he had to leave in the third quarter following an ankle injury. Rozier finished the game with 147 yards on 26 carries.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
Rozier was selected by the Pittsburgh Maulers first overall in the 1984 USFL Draft. He played his first two professional seasons in the United States Football League, in 1984, with the Pittsburgh Maulers, and 1985, with the Jacksonville Bulls. In 1985 Rozier played for the Jacksonville Bulls in the spring and the Houston Oilers in the fall.

He was drafted by the Houston Oilers in the 1st round (2nd pick overall) of the 1984 NFL Supplemental Draft of USFL and CFL Players, joining them in the fall of 1985. Rozier played six seasons for the Oilers, amassing a total of 900 carries for 3171 yards, including a 1,002-yard rushing season in 1988. While playing for the Oilers, Rozier was elected to the AFC Pro Bowl squad in both 1987 and 1988.

In 1990, Rozier only played three games for the Oilers, rushing 10 times for a total of 42 yards, before being released after they found no suitable trade partners. He was quickly picked up by the NFC&#x27;s Atlanta Falcons, where he finished the year with 153 carries for 675 yards. His final season in the NFL came the next year with the Falcons. He completed the 1991 season with 361 yards on 96 carries, announcing his retirement during the off-season.

Rozier finished his career with a total of 1159 carries for 4462 yards, having averaged 3.8 yards per carry, and scoring 30 touchdowns.

As of the end of the 2020 season, Rozier is ranked 172nd on the NFL All-Time Rushing Yards list.

==Personal life==
Mike has been married to his wife Rochelle, an attorney, since 2005. They reside in the Sicklerville section of Winslow Township, New Jersey and together they have one son, Michael Guy Pacheco Rozier. He has two other children, Amber and JaMichael Rozier, who reside in Houston, Texas.

In 1996, he was shot in his hometown of Camden, New Jersey.

Rozier, along with his wife and three other family members, appeared on the October 22, 2013 episode of &quot;Family Feud&quot;.

Rozier was called one the most stylish dressers in the history of the Heisman Trophy by SBNation.

On April 9, 2024, Rozier was honored in his hometown of Camden, New Jersey, with a street dedication. Additionally, a sign was erected in the city proclaiming it the home of the renowned former Nebraska, USFL, and NFL running back.

<text>Enrico Caterino Davila (30 October 157626 May 1631) was an Italian historian and diplomat.

==Life==
Born in Piove di Sacco, near Padua, he was descended from a Spanish noble family and was the youngest son of Antonio Davila, Grand Constable of Cyprus. His name was given in honour of Henry III of France and Catherine de&#x27; Medici.

His immediate ancestors had been constables of the Kingdom of Cyprus for the Venetian republic since 1464. In 1570 the island was taken by the Turks; and Antonio Davila, the father of the historian, had to leave for Padua, despoiled of all his possessions. In 1583 Antonio took this son to France, where he became a page in the service of Catherine de&#x27; Medici, wife of King Henry II.

In due time he entered the military service and fought through the French civil wars until the peace in 1598. In 1599, he returned to Padua where he stayed until 1606. Subsequently, he travelled to Parma, Rome and Rovigo and finally settled to Tinos (1609–1615) where he held the post of governor. At Tinos he met and married his wife Ursula delli Ascuffi.

Later in his life Enrico was assigned as a governor of the Venetian possessions of Cattaro (1618–1621) and Zara (1623–1628). Also in 1621, he participated in a Venetian diplomatic mission to Florence, under the leadership of Alvise Valaresso.

Enrico Davila was murdered, while on his way to take possession of the government of Cremona for Venice in May 1631, by a ruffian, with whom a dispute arose about relays of horses ordered for his use by the Venetian government. Davila was killed by a pistol bullet; the murderer&#x27;s aides also killed the family chaplain but the murderer was killed by Enrico&#x27;s son &#x27;Antonio&#x27; and the rest of the attackers were captured and then publicly executed in Verona.

==The &quot;Istoria&quot;==

He planned a history of the civil wars in France in which he had taken part, and during which he had seen the leading personages and events. This work was completed about 1630 and was offered by the author to the publishers in Venice. At last Tommaso Baglioni, who had no work for his presses, undertook to print the manuscript, on condition that he should be free to leave off if more promising work offered itself. The printing of the &quot;Istoria delle guerre civili di Francia&quot; was, however, completed, and the success of the work was immediate.

The &quot;Historia delle guerre civili di Francia&quot; is based on first-hand knowledge of events and personalities. Sceptical about the religious claims of both sides (Catholic and Huguenot), Davila vividly portrayed the French wars of religion mainly as a struggle between noble factions for the control of the royal government and, within limits, is still a rich source of information for a troubled period of French history.

Over two hundred editions followed, of which perhaps the best is the one published in Paris in 1644. An English translation was made for Charles I of England by William Aylesbury and Charles Cotterell, published as &quot;The Historie of the Civil Warres of France&quot; (1647). Samuel Pepys was appreciative.

Lord Bolingbroke, in his fifth letter on the Study of History, recommends him very strongly as a writer equal in many respects to Livy. The American statesman and political thinker John Adams wrote his last work of political theory, the &quot;Discourses on Davila&quot;, as an extended commentary on Davila&#x27;s history of the French civil wars, following the example of Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;Discorsi&quot; on Livy&#x27;s history of Rome.

His name is often anglicised as &quot;Henry Catherine Davilla&quot;.

<doc id="637192" wikidata="Q506501" url="?curid=637192" title="Arthur II, Duke of Brittany">
<text>Arthur II (25 July 1261 – 27 August 1312), of the House of Dreux, was Duke of Brittany from 1305 to his death. He was the first son of John II and Beatrice, daughter of Henry III of England and Eleanor of Provence.

After he inherited the ducal throne, his brother John became Earl of Richmond.

As duke, Arthur was independent of the French crown. He divided his duchy into eight &quot;battles&quot;: Léon, Kernev, Landreger, Penteur, Gwened, Naoned, Roazhon, and Sant Malou. In 1309, he convoked the first Estates of Brittany. It was the first time in French history that the third estate was represented.

Arthur died at Château de l&#x27;Isle in Saint Denis en Val and was interred in a marble tomb of the cordeliers of Vannes. The tomb was vandalised during the French Revolution, but later repaired and is on display today.

==Marriages and children==
In 1275, Arthur married Marie, Viscountess of Limoges, daughter of Guy VI, Viscount of Limoges, and Margaret, Lady of Molinot. Her maternal grandparents were Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy, and his first wife, Yolande of Dreux. They were parents of three children:

* John III, Duke of Brittany (8 March 1286 – 30 April 1341).
* Guy de Penthièvre, Count of Penthièvre (1287 – 1331); father of Joanna of Penthièvre.
* Peter of Brittany, Seigneur of Dol-Combourg and Sant-Maloù (1289 – 1312).

Marie died in 1291. In May 1292, Arthur married Yolande of Dreux, who was Countess of Montfort, daughter of Robert IV, Count of Dreux, and Beatrice de Montfort. Yolande had briefly been Queen of Scotland by her first marriage. They were parents of six children:

* John of Montfort (1295 – 16 September 1345).
* (1295–1384); married Guy X, Lord of Laval.
* ; married Robert, Count of Marle, Lord of Cassel (son of Robert III, Count of Flanders).
* (1297–1377); married Bouchard VI, Count of Vendôme, a member of the House of Montoire.
* Blanche of Brittany (born ); considered to have died young.
* Marie of Brittany (1302–1371); a nun.

<doc id="637197" wikidata="Q62179" url="?curid=637197" title="Collapse of the World Trade Center">
<text>The World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, New York City, was destroyed on September 11, 2001, as a result of al-Qaeda&#x27;s terror attacks. Two commercial airliners hijacked by terrorists were deliberately flown into the Twin Towers of the complex, resulting in a total progressive collapse that killed almost 3,000 people. It was the deadliest and costliest building collapse in history.

The North Tower (WTC 1) was the first building to be hit when American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into it at 8:46 a.m., causing it to collapse at 10:28 after burning for one hour and 42 minutes. At 9:03 a.m., the South Tower (WTC 2) was struck by United Airlines Flight 175; it collapsed at 9:59 a.m. after burning for 56 minutes.

The towers&#x27; destruction caused major devastation throughout Lower Manhattan, and more than a dozen adjacent and nearby structures were damaged or destroyed by debris from the plane impacts or the collapses. Four of the five remaining World Trade Center structures were immediately crushed or damaged beyond repair as the towers fell, while 7 World Trade Center remained standing for another six hours until fires ignited by raining debris from the North Tower brought it down at 5:21 that afternoon.

The hijackings, crashes, fires and subsequent collapses killed an initial total of 2,760 people. Toxic powder from the destroyed high-rises was dispersed throughout the city and gave rise to numerous long-term health effects that continue to plague many who were in the towers&#x27; vicinity, with at least three additional deaths reported. The 110-story towers are the tallest freestanding structures ever to be destroyed, and the death toll from the attack on the North Tower represents the deadliest terrorist act in world history.

In 2005, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published the results of its investigation into the collapse. It found nothing substandard in the towers&#x27; design, noting that the severity of the attacks was beyond anything experienced by buildings in the past. The NIST determined the fires to be the main cause of the collapses, finding that sagging floors pulled inward on the perimeter columns, causing them to bow and then buckle. Once the upper section of the building began to move downward, a total progressive collapse was unavoidable.

The cleanup of the World Trade Center site involved round-the-clock operations and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Some of the surrounding structures that had not been hit by the planes still sustained significant damage, requiring them to be torn down. Demolition of the surrounding damaged buildings continued even as new construction proceeded on the Twin Towers&#x27; replacement, the new One World Trade Center, which opened in 2014.

==Background==
When they opened in 1973, the Twin Towers were the tallest buildings in the world. At the time of the attacks, only the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and the Willis Tower (known then as the Sears Tower) in Chicago were taller. Built with a novel &quot;framed tube&quot; design that maximized interior space, the towers had a high strength-to-weight ratio requiring 40 percent less steel than more traditional steel-framed skyscrapers. In addition, atop WTC 1 stood a telecommunications antenna erected in 1978, bringing that tower&#x27;s total height to , though as a nonstructural addition, the antenna was not officially counted.

===Structural design===
The towers were designed as framed tube structures, which provided tenants with open floor plans uninterrupted by columns or walls. The buildings were square and on each side but had chamfered corners, making each building&#x27;s exterior roughly wide. One World Trade Center (WTC 1), the &quot;North Tower&quot;, was, at , six feet taller than Two World Trade Center (WTC 2), the &quot;South Tower&quot;, which was tall. Numerous closely spaced perimeter columns provided much of the structural strength, along with gravity load shared with the steel box columns of the core. Above the tenth floor, there were 59 perimeter columns along each face of the building spaced on center. While the towers were square, the interior cores were rectangular and supported by 47 columns that ran the full height of each tower. All the elevators and stairwells were in the core, leaving a large column-free space between it and the perimeter that was bridged by prefabricated floor trusses. As the core was rectangular, this created a long and short span distance to the perimeter columns.

The floors consisted of lightweight concrete slabs laid on a fluted steel deck. A grid of lightweight bridging trusses and main trusses supported the floors with shear connections to the concrete slab for composite action. The trusses had a span of in the long-span areas and in the short-span area. The trusses connected to the perimeter at alternate columns, and were therefore on centers. The top chords of the trusses were bolted to seats welded to the spandrels on the perimeter side and a channel welded to interior box columns on the core side. The floors were connected to the perimeter spandrel plates with viscoelastic dampers, which helped reduce the amount of sway felt by building occupants.

The towers also had a &quot;hat truss&quot; or &quot;outrigger truss&quot; between the 107th and 110th floors, consisting of six trusses along the long axis of core and four along the short axis. This system allowed optimized load redistribution of floor diaphragms between the perimeter and core, with improved performance between the different materials of flexible steel and rigid concrete allowing the moment frames to transfer sway into compression on the core, which also mostly supported the transmission tower. These trusses were installed in each building to support future transmission towers, but only the north tower was ultimately fitted with one.

===Evaluations for aircraft impact===

Though fire studies and even an analysis of the impacts of low-speed jet aircraft impacts had been undertaken before the towers&#x27; completion, the full scope of those studies no longer exists. Nevertheless, since fire had never before caused a skyscraper to collapse and aircraft impacts had been considered in their design, their destruction initially came as a surprise to some in the engineering community.

The structural engineers working on the World Trade Center considered the possibility that aircraft could crash into the building. In July 1945, a B-25 bomber that was lost in fog had crashed into the 79th floor of the Empire State Building. A year later, a C-45F Expeditor crashed into the 40 Wall Street building. Once again, fog was believed to have been the contributing factor in the collision. Leslie Robertson, one of the chief engineers working on the design of the World Trade Center, said that he considered the scenario of the impact of a Boeing 707, which might be lost in the fog and flying at relatively low speeds while seeking to land at either JFK or Newark Airports. In an interview with the BBC two months after the towers collapsed, Robertson said: &quot;with the 707, the fuel load was not considered in the design. I don&#x27;t know how it could have been considered.&quot; He also said that the main difference between the design studies and the event that caused the towers to collapse was the velocity of the impact, which greatly increased the absorbed energy, and was never considered during the construction process.

During its investigation into the collapse, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) obtained a three-page white paper that stated the buildings would survive an aircraft-impact of a Boeing 707 or DC 8 flying at . In 1993, John Skilling, lead structural engineer for the WTC, said in an interview conducted after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing: &quot;Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed. The building structure would still be there.&quot; In its report, NIST stated that the technical ability to perform a rigorous simulation of aircraft impact and ensuing fires is a recent development, and that the technical capability for such analysis would have been quite limited in the 1960s. In its final report on the collapses, the NIST stated that it could find no documentation examining the impact of a high-speed jet or of a large-scale fire fueled by aviation fuel.

===Fireproofing===

Until the mid-1970s, the use of asbestos for fireproofing was widespread in the construction industry. But in April 1970, the New York City Department of Air Resources ordered contractors building the World Trade Center to stop the spraying of asbestos as an insulating material and vermiculite plaster was used instead.

After the 1993 bombing, inspections found fireproofing to be deficient. Before the collapses, the towers&#x27; owner, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, was in the process of adding fireproofing, but had completed only 18 floors in WTC 1, including all the floors affected by the aircraft impact and fires, and 13 floors in WTC 2, although none were directly affected by the aircraft impact.

NIST concluded that the aircraft impact sheared off a significant portion of the fireproofing, contributing to the buildings&#x27; collapse. In &quot;WTC 1&quot;, the impact stripped the insulation off most core columns (43 of 47) on more than one floor, as well as floor trusses over a space of . In &quot;WTC 2&quot; the impact knocked off insulation from 39 of the 47 columns on multiple floors, and also from floor trusses spanning an area of .

After the collapses, Leslie E. Robertson said: &quot;To the best of our knowledge, little was known about the effects of a fire from such an aircraft, and no designs were prepared for that circumstance. Indeed, at that time, no fireproofing systems were available to control the effects of such fires.&quot;

==The two crashes==
===Aircraft impacts and resultant fires===
During the September 11 attacks, four teams of al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four different jetliners. Two of these jetliners, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, both Boeing 767s, were hijacked after takeoff from Boston&#x27;s Logan International Airport. In its final moments, American Airlines Flight 11 flew south over Manhattan and crashed at roughly into the northern facade of the North Tower (WTC 1) at 8:46 a.m., hitting the 93rd through 99th floors. Seventeen minutes later, United Airlines Flight 175 flew northeast, over New York Harbor, and crashed into the southern facade of the South Tower (WTC 2) at 9:03 a.m., striking between the 77th through 85th floors at .

The impacts failed the exterior columns in the regions hit by the fuselage, engines, and fuel-filled wing section (34 columns in the North Tower and 26 in the South Tower). Damage also extended to the tips of the wings and tailfin. In addition, several core columns were either severed or heavily damaged, especially in the path of the fuselage.

About one third of the fuel was consumed in the initial impact and resulting fireball. Some fuel from the impact traveled down at least one elevator shaft and exploded on the 78th floor of the North Tower, as well as in the main lobby. The towers&#x27; light construction and hollowness allowed the jet fuel to penetrate far inside them, igniting many large fires simultaneously over a wide area of the impacted floors. The fuel burned for at most a few minutes, but the buildings&#x27; contents burned over the next hour or hour and a half.

As Flight 175 struck the South Tower, the shockwave shattered glass on the east face of the North Tower adjacent to the fireball, which aggravated the fires already burning in the North Tower and released plumes of smoke from the newly opened windows. It is unknown whether Flight 11&#x27;s impact did the same to windows on the South Tower. In any case, the major debris from Flight 11 flew past the South Tower, while the more significant pieces of wreckage from Flight 175 similarly missed the already burning North Tower. In both instances, some of these parts landed on other nearby buildings, resulting in further destruction.

The fires in each building had different attributes, as was evident in the responses and behavior of people trapped in each. Countless windows in the North Tower were smashed by occupants seeking relief from the hellish conditions inside. While some windows were broken in the South Tower, it was relatively uncommon by comparison. Victims were only occasionally spotted inside open windows, and no crowds were present outside of the tower, as in the &quot;Impending Death&quot; photograph of the North Tower burning.

Numerous people fell or jumped to their deaths from the burning towers. Three were spotted from an east-facing window on the south side of the 79th floor, while the 100–200 people who fell or jumped from the four faces of the North Tower had no other means of escape from the insufferable heat, smoke and fire consuming its top 18 stories.

Such differences imply that conditions did not deteriorate as rapidly, or become as inhospitable, in the South Tower as in the North. The damage to the North Tower by Flight 11&#x27;s centered impact severed all escape routes above the 91st floor and left the stranded workers in an insufferable inferno from which jumping was their only means of escape; Flight 175 struck the South Tower through the southeast corner of the skyscraper&#x27;s southern facade and left the northwesternmost stairwell undamaged from top to bottom. The intact stairway meant people in the South Tower were not completely trapped, which may have influenced their decision to jump.

The fireballs resulting from each impact were likely very similar, but appeared vastly different in size despite the planes carrying similar amounts of combustibles. This is because a substantial portion of the jet fuel was channelled into the North Tower instead of being sprayed out into the open. Flight 11 crashed almost midway into the North Tower&#x27;s central core, causing the ignited jet fuel to shoot through elevator shafts down as far as the basement and concourse levels, with a flash fire exploding from elevators in the ground floor lobby, more than 90 floors below the impact. Flight 175&#x27;s impact into the South Tower&#x27;s south face was offset to the east rather than being centralized like Flight 11, leaving the sides of the tower as the only real direction in which the fuel could travel, producing a visibly larger fireball on the outside.

===Emergency response and evacuation===
Almost all the deaths in the Twin Towers occurred in the zones above the points of aircraft impact. As the North Tower had been struck almost directly midway into the structure, the three main stairways (A, B, and C) in the tower core were all damaged or blocked by debris preventing escape to lower floors. In the South Tower, the impact was east of center to the central section of the tower and close to the southeast corner, resulting in stairway A in the northwest portion of the central core being intact and only partially blocked, and 18 civilians managed to escape from the point of aircraft impact and the floors above that. The exact numbers of who perished and where in some cases is not precisely known; however the National Institute of Standards and Technology report indicated that a total of 1,402 civilians perished at or above the impact point in the North Tower with hundreds estimated to have been killed at the moment of impact. In the South Tower, 614 civilians perished at the impacted floors and the floors above that. Fewer than 200 of the civilian fatalities occurred in the floors below the impact points but all 147 civilian passengers and crew on the two aircraft as well as all 10 terrorists perished, along with at least 18 people on the ground and in adjacent structures.

All told, emergency personnel killed as a result of the collapse included 342 members of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY), 71 law enforcement officers including 23 members of the New York City Police Department (NYPD), 37 members of the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD), five members of the New York State Office of Tax Enforcement (OTE), three officers of the New York State Office of Court Administration (OCA), one fire marshal of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) who had sworn law enforcement powers (and was also among the 343 FDNY members killed), one member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and one member of the United States Secret Service (USSS). The total death toll for civilian and non-civilians is estimated to be 2,606 persons.

==Collapse of the Towers==
The destruction of the Twin Towers has been called &quot;the most infamous paradigm&quot; of progressive collapse. Each collapse began with the local failure of the vertical load-bearing components of the floors that were hit by the planes and progressed to encompass the whole of the structure. Structural components were severed, releasing gravitational energy that transferred loads downwards by way of serially propagating impact forces. Excepting the top floors of the building, which would not have released sufficient gravitational energy to bring about a total collapse, the collapses could have begun with the failure of any story.

The towers collapsed symmetrically and more or less straight down, though there was some tilting of the tops of the towers and a significant amount of fallout to the sides. As the collapse progressed, dust and debris could be seen shooting out of the windows several floors below the advancing destruction, caused by the sudden rush of air compressed under the descending upper levels.

During each collapse, large portions of the perimeter columns and the cores were left without any lateral support, causing them to fall laterally towards the outside, pushed by the increasing pile of rubble. Consequently, the walls peeled off and separated from the buildings by a large distance – about in some cases – hitting neighboring buildings and starting fires that would later lead to the collapse of Building 7. Some connections broke as the bolts snapped, leaving many panels randomly scattered. The first fragments of the outer walls of the collapsed North Tower struck the ground 11 seconds after the collapse started, and parts of the South Tower after 9 seconds. The lower portions of both buildings&#x27; cores (60 stories of WTC 1 and 40 stories of WTC 2) remained standing for up to 25 seconds after the start of the initial collapse before they too collapsed.

===Collapse initiation===
In both towers, the section of the building that had been damaged by the airplanes failed. Aside from the structural damage, the impacts had removed fireproofing from a large part of the impact zone allowing the structural steel to heat rapidly. As a result, the core columns were weakened and began to shorten due to creep. The hat truss resisted this by shifting loads to the perimeter columns. Meanwhile, web diagonals of the 60 foot trusses supporting the long-span tenant floor area began to buckle, causing the floors to sag by more than 2 feet. This pulled in the perimeter walls, which buckled. The floors above the impact zone now fell freely onto the undamaged structure below.

The North Tower lasted around 46 minutes longer than its twin, having been struck 17 minutes before the South Tower was attacked and standing another half-hour after the South Tower collapsed. This was because Flight 11 struck more or less in the center, causing more symmetrical impact damage to the North Tower&#x27;s core and leaving more of its structural support intact. The fires also took more than an hour to spread to the south side of the building, where there was fireproofing damage. Traveling at 440 miles per hour, Flight 11 crashed through Floors 93 and 99, leaving only 10 floors&#x27; worth of structural weight pressing down on the damaged, burning section of the North Tower.

Flight 175&#x27;s much higher impact speed inflicted structural damage even more catastrophic than Flight 11&#x27;s, which was compounded by the plane slicing through the southeastern corner rather than the center, unbalancing the South Tower on one side. The uneven weight distribution was significantly aggravated by Flight 175 crashing much lower down, between Floors 77 and 85, resulting in more pressure on both the perimeter wall columns and core columns than in the North Tower and causing them to snap more quickly. The difference in the impacts was such that a senior FDNY chief reportedly expressed strong disbelief that the North Tower would collapse even after witnessing the collapse of the South Tower, because the North had not been struck at a corner.

===Total progressive collapse===
When the columns failed, the entire building above fell onto the first intact floor beneath impact. The vertical capacity of the connections supporting an intact floor below the level of collapse was adequate to carry the load of 11additional floors if the load were applied gradually, but of only 6additional floors if the load were applied suddenlyas was the case. Since the number of floors above the approximate floor of collapse initiation exceeded six in each WTC tower (12 floors in WTC 1 and 29 floors in WTC 2), the floors below the level of collapse initiation were unable to resist the suddenly applied gravitational load from the upper floors of the buildings.
From there collapse proceeded through two phases. During the &quot;crush-down&quot; phase, the upper block destroyed the structure below in a progressive series of floor failures roughly one story at a time. Each failure began with the impact of the upper block on the floor plate of the lower section, mediated by a growing layer of rubble consisting mainly of concrete from the floor slabs. The energy from each impact was &quot;reintroduced into the structure in [the] subsequent impact, ... concentrate[d] in the load-bearing elements directly affected by the impact.&quot; This overloaded the floor connections of the story immediately beneath the advancing destruction, causing them to detach from the perimeter and core columns. The perimeter columns peeled away and the cores were left without lateral support.

This continued until the upper block reached the ground and the &quot;crush-up&quot; phase began. Here, it was the columns that buckled one story at a time, now starting from the bottom. As each story failed, the remaining block fell through the height of the story, onto the next one, which it also crushed, until the roof finally hit the ground. The process accelerated throughout, and by the end each story was being crushed in less than a tenth of a second.

===South Tower collapse===

As the fires continued to burn, occupants trapped in the upper floors of the South Tower provided information about conditions to 9-1-1 dispatchers. At 9:37 a.m., an occupant on the 105th floor of the South Tower reported that floors beneath him &quot;in the 90-something floor&quot; had collapsed. The New York City Police Department aviation unit also relayed information about the deteriorating condition of the buildings to police commanders. At 9:51 a.m., seven minutes before the collapse, the NYPD aviation unit reported that large pieces of debris were hanging or falling from the South Tower. The implied threat of an imminent collapse was sufficient for the NYPD to order its officers to evacuate, although none of the helicopter pilots specifically predicted that either tower would fall. During the emergency response, there was little communication between the NYPD and the FDNY, and overwhelmed 9-1-1 dispatchers did not pass along information to FDNY commanders at the scene. At 9:59 a.m., the South Tower collapsed, 56 minutes after Flight 175 crashed into it.

Before the South Tower collapsed, 18 people escaped from the impact zone and the floors above, including Stanley Praimnath, who had seen the plane coming at him. They made it out via Stairwell A, the only stairway left intact after the crash. There may have been other previously trapped occupants who were descending from the impact zone when the tower collapsed. Numerous police hotline operators who received calls from people in the South Tower were not well informed of the situation as it rapidly unfolded. Many operators told callers not to descend on their own, even though it is now believed that Stairwell A was probably passable at and above the point of impact.

===North Tower collapse===
The South Tower&#x27;s collapse shattered windows and damaged other exterior elements along the North Tower&#x27;s southern and eastern facades, although this was insufficient to cause its subsequent collapse. After the South Tower fell, NYPD helicopters relayed information about the deteriorating conditions of the North Tower, while FDNY commanders issued orders for firefighters in the North Tower to evacuate. Poor radio reception meant firefighters inside the North Tower did not hear the evacuation order from their supervisors on the scene, and most were unaware that the other tower had collapsed. An NYPD officer said at 10:06 a.m. that the North Tower was not going to last much longer and recommended that emergency vehicles be pulled away from the complex. At 10:20 a.m., the NYPD aviation unit reported that &quot;the top of the tower might be leaning&quot;, and a minute later confirmed that the North Tower was buckling on the southwest corner and leaning to the south, prompting an officer to begin urging all NYPD personnel in the building&#x27;s vicinity to retreat at least three blocks in every direction. The aviation unit declared at 10:27 &quot;the roof is going to come down very shortly&quot;; this proved correct less than a minute later, when the North Tower collapsed at 10:28 a.m., one hour and 42 minutes after being struck.

Because all escape routes from within, above, and immediately below the impact zone were severed when Flight 11 crashed, no one above the 91st floor survived. The collapsing towers generated enormous clouds of dust and debris, which enveloped lower Manhattan; light dust reached as far as the Empire State Building, away. The debris cloud from the North Tower collapse was also larger and more widespread than that of the South Tower, because the collapse of the North also kicked up dust from the South Tower.

==Building 7 collapse==
As the North Tower collapsed, heavy debris hit 7 World Trade Center, causing damage to the south face of the building and starting fires that continued to burn throughout the afternoon. Structural damage occurred to the southwest corner between Floors 7 and 17 and on the south facade between Floor 44 and the roof; other possible structural damage includes a large vertical gash near the center of the south facade between Floors 24 and 41. The building was equipped with a sprinkler system, but had many single-point vulnerabilities for failure: the sprinkler system required manual initiation of the electrical fire pumps, rather than being a fully automatic system; the floor-level controls had a single connection to the sprinkler water riser; and the sprinkler system required some power for the fire pump to deliver water. Also, water pressure was low, with little or no water to feed sprinklers.

Some firefighters entered 7 World Trade Center to search the building. They attempted to extinguish small pockets of fire, but low water pressure hindered their efforts. Fires burned into the afternoon on the 11th and 12th floors of 7 World Trade Center, the flames visible on the east side of the building. During the afternoon, fire was also seen on floors 6–10, 13–14, 19–22, and 29–30. In particular, the fires on floors 7 through 9 and 11 through 13 continued to burn out of control during the afternoon. At approximately 2:00 pm, firefighters noticed a bulge in the southwest corner of 7 World Trade Center between the 10th and 13th floors, a sign that the building was unstable and might cave to one side or &quot;collapse&quot;. During the afternoon, firefighters also heard creaking sounds coming from the building and issued uncertain reports about damage in the basement. Around 3:30 pm FDNY Chief Daniel A. Nigro decided to halt rescue operations, surface removal, and searches along the surface of the debris near 7 World Trade Center and evacuate the area due to concerns for the safety of personnel. At 5:20:33 pm EDT on September 11, 2001, 7 World Trade Center started to collapse, with the crumble of the east mechanical penthouse, while at 5:21:10 pm EDT the entire building collapsed completely. There were no casualties associated with the collapse.

When 7 World Trade Center collapsed, debris caused substantial damage and contamination to the Borough of Manhattan Community College&#x27;s Fiterman Hall building, located adjacent at 30 West Broadway, to the extent that the building was not salvageable. In August 2007, Fiterman Hall was scheduled for dismantling. A revised plan called for demolition in 2009 and completion of the new Fiterman Hall in 2012, at a cost of $325 million. The building was finally demolished in November 2009 and construction of its replacement began on December 1, 2009. The adjacent Verizon Building, an Art Deco building constructed in 1926, had extensive damage to its east facade from the collapse of 7 World Trade Center, though it was successfully restored at a cost of US$1.4 billion.

==Other buildings==
Many of the surrounding buildings were also either damaged or destroyed as the towers fell. 5 World Trade Center endured a large fire and a partial collapse of its steel structure and was torn down. Other buildings destroyed include 3 World Trade Center, 4 World Trade Center, 6 World Trade Center, and St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church. The World Financial Center buildings, 90 West Street, and 130 Cedar Street suffered fires. The Deutsche Bank Building, the Verizon Building, and 3 World Financial Center had impact damage from the towers&#x27; collapse, as did 90 West Street. One Liberty Plaza survived structurally intact but sustained surface damage including shattered windows. 30 West Broadway was damaged by the collapse of 7 World Trade Center. The Deutsche Bank Building, which was covered in a large black &quot;shroud&quot; after September 11 to cover the building&#x27;s damage, was deconstructed because of water, mold, and other severe damage caused by the neighboring towers&#x27; collapse. In addition to this, many works of art were destroyed in the collapse.

==Investigations==
===Initial opinions and analysis===

In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, numerous structural engineers and experts spoke to the media, describing what they thought caused the towers to collapse. Abolhassan Astaneh-Asl, a structural engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley, explained that the high temperatures in the fires weakened the steel beams and columns, causing them to become &quot;soft and mushy&quot;, and eventually they were unable to support the structure above. Astaneh-Asl also suggested that the fireproofing became dislodged during the initial aircraft impacts. He also explained that, once the initial structural failure occurred, progressive collapse of the entire structure was inevitable. César Pelli, who designed the Petronas Towers in Malaysia and the World Financial Center in New York, remarked, &quot;no building is prepared for this kind of stress.&quot;

On September 13, 2001, Zdeněk P. Bažant, professor of civil engineering and materials science at Northwestern University, circulated a draft paper with results of a simple analysis of the World Trade Center collapse. Bažant suggested that heat from the fires was a key factor, causing steel columns in both the core and the perimeter to weaken and experience deformation before losing their carrying capacity and buckling. Once more than half of the columns on a particular floor buckled, the overhead structure could no longer be supported and complete collapse of the structures occurred. Bažant later published an expanded version of this analysis. Other analyses were conducted by MIT civil engineers Oral Buyukozturk and Franz-Josef Ulm, who also described a collapse mechanism on September 21, 2001. They later contributed to an MIT collection of papers on the WTC collapses edited by Eduardo Kausel called &quot;The Towers Lost and Beyond&quot;.

Immediately following the collapses, there was some confusion about who had the authority to carry out an official investigation. While there are clear procedures for the investigation of aircraft accidents, no agency had been appointed in advance to investigate building collapses. A team was quickly assembled by the Structural Engineers Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers, led by W. Gene Corley, Senior Vice President of CTLGroup. It also involved the American Institute of Steel Construction, the American Concrete Institute, the National Fire Protection Association, and the Society of Fire Protection Engineers. ASCE ultimately invited FEMA to join the investigation, which was completed under the auspices of the latter.

The investigation was criticized by some engineers and lawmakers in the U.S. It had little funding, no authority to demand evidence, and limited access to the WTC site. One major point of contention at the time was that the cleanup of the WTC site was resulting in the destruction of the majority of the buildings&#x27; steel components. Indeed, when NIST published its final report, it noted &quot;the scarcity of physical evidence&quot; that it had had at its disposal to investigate the collapses. Only a fraction of a percent of the buildings remained for analysis after the cleanup was completed: some 236 individual pieces of steel, although 95% of structural beams and plates and 50% of the reinforcement bars were recovered.

FEMA published its report in May 2002. While NIST had already announced its intention to investigate the collapses in August of the same year, by September 11, 2002 (a year after the disaster), there was growing public pressure for a more thorough investigation. Congress passed the National Construction Safety Team bill in October 2002, giving NIST the authority to conduct an investigation of the World Trade Center collapses.

===FEMA building performance study===
FEMA suggested that fires in conjunction with damage resulting from the aircraft impacts were the key to the collapse of the towers. Thomas Eagar, Professor of Materials Engineering and Engineering Systems at MIT, described the fires as &quot;the most misunderstood part of the WTC collapse&quot;. This is because the fires were originally said to have &quot;melted&quot; the floors and columns. Jet fuel is essentially kerosene and would have served mainly to ignite very large, but not unusually hot, hydrocarbon fires. As Eagar said, &quot;The temperature of the fire at the WTC was not unusual, and it was most definitely not capable of melting steel.&quot; This led Eagar, FEMA and others to focus on what appeared to be the weakest point of the structures, namely, the points at which the floors were attached to the building frame.
===NIST report===
After the FEMA report had been published, and following pressure from technical experts, industry leaders and families of victims, the Commerce Department&#x27;s National Institute of Standards and Technology conducted a three-year, $16 million investigation into the structural failure and progressive collapse of several WTC complex structures. The study included in-house technical expertise, along with assistance from several outside private institutions, including the Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Society of Fire Protection Engineers, National Fire Protection Association, American Institute of Steel Construction, Simpson Gumpertz &amp; Heger Inc., Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, and the Structural Engineers Association of New York.

The scope of the NIST investigation was focused on identifying &quot;the sequence of events&quot; that triggered the collapse, and did not include detailed analysis of the collapse mechanism itself (after the point at which events made the collapse inevitable). In line with the concerns of most engineers, NIST focused on the airplane impacts and the spread and effects of the fires, modeling these using Fire Dynamics Simulator software. NIST developed several highly detailed structural models for specific sub-systems such as the floor trusses as well as a global model of the towers as a whole which is less detailed. These models were static or quasi-static, including deformation but not the motion of structural elements after rupture.

James Quintiere, professor of fire protection engineering at the University of Maryland, called the fact that only a small portion of the building&#x27;s steel was preserved for study &quot;a gross error&quot; that NIST should have openly criticized. He also noted that the report lacked a timeline and physical evidence to support its conclusions. Some engineers have suggested that understanding of the collapse mechanism could be improved by developing an animated sequence of the collapses based on a global dynamic model, and comparing it with the video evidence of the actual collapses. The NIST report for WTC 7 concluded that no blast sounds were heard on audio and video footage, or were reported by witnesses.

===7 World Trade Center===
In May 2002, FEMA issued a report on the collapse based on a preliminary investigation conducted jointly with the Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers under leadership of Dr. W. Gene Corley, P.E. FEMA made preliminary findings that the collapse was not primarily caused by actual impact damage from the collapse of 1 WTC and 2 WTC but by fires on multiple stories ignited by debris from the other two towers that continued unabated due to lack of water for sprinklers or manual firefighting. The report did not reach conclusions about the cause of the collapse and called for further investigation.

In response to FEMA&#x27;s concerns, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was authorized to lead an investigation into the structural failure and collapse of the World Trade Center twin towers and 7 World Trade Center. The investigation, led by Dr S. Shyam Sunder, drew not only upon in-house technical expertise, but also upon the knowledge of several outside private institutions, including the Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers (SEI/ASCE), the Society of Fire Protection Engineers (SFPE), the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC), the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), and the Structural Engineers Association of New York (SEAoNY).

The bulk of the investigation of 7 World Trade Center was delayed until after reports were completed on the collapse of the World Trade Center twin towers. In the meantime, NIST provided a preliminary report about 7 World Trade Center in June 2004, and thereafter released occasional updates on the investigation. According to NIST, the investigation of 7 World Trade Center was delayed for a number of reasons, including that NIST staff who had been working on 7 World Trade Center were assigned full-time from June 2004 to September 2005 to work on the investigation of the collapse of the twin towers. In June 2007, Shyam Sunder explained, &quot;We are proceeding as quickly as possible while rigorously testing and evaluating a wide range of scenarios to reach the most definitive conclusion possible. The 7 WTC investigation is in some respects just as challenging, if not more so, than the study of the towers. However, the current study does benefit greatly from the significant technological advances achieved and lessons learned from our work on the towers.&quot;

In November 2008, NIST released its final report on the causes of the collapse of 7 World Trade Center. This followed their August 21, 2008 draft report which included a period for public comments. In its investigation, NIST utilized ANSYS to model events leading up to collapse initiation and LS-DYNA models to simulate the global response to the initiating events. NIST determined that diesel fuel did not play an important role, nor did the structural damage from the collapse of the twin towers, nor did the transfer elements (trusses, girders, and cantilever overhangs), but the lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor. The fires burned out of control during the afternoon, causing floor beams near Column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat, triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14. With a loss of lateral support across nine floors, Column 79 soon buckled – pulling the East penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the entire building above to fall downward as a single unit. From collapse timing measurements taken from a video of the north face of the building, NIST observed that the building&#x27;s exterior facade fell at free fall acceleration through a distance of approximately 8 stories (32 meters, or 105 feet), noting &quot;the collapse time was approximately 40 percent longer than that of free fall for the first 18 stories of descent.&quot; The fires, fueled by office contents, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse.

The collapse of the old 7 World Trade Center is remarkable because it was the first known instance of a tall building collapsing primarily as a result of uncontrolled fires. Based on its investigation, NIST reiterated several recommendations it had made in its earlier report on the collapse of the twin towers, and urged immediate action on a further recommendation: that fire resistance should be evaluated under the assumption that sprinklers are unavailable; and that the effects of thermal expansion on floor support systems be considered. Recognizing that current building codes are drawn to prevent loss of life rather than building collapse, the main point of NIST&#x27;s recommendations is that buildings should not collapse from fire even if sprinklers are unavailable.

===Other investigations===
In 2003, Asif Usmani, Professor of Structural Engineering at University of Edinburgh, published a paper with two colleagues. They provisionally concluded the fires alone, without any damage from the airplanes, could have been enough to bring down the buildings. In their view, the towers were uniquely vulnerable to the effects of large fires on several floors at the same time. When the NIST report was published, Barbara Lane, with the UK engineering firm Arup, criticized its conclusion that the loss of fire proofing was a necessary factor in causing the collapses; &quot;We have carried out computer simulations which show that the towers would have collapsed after a major fire on three floors at once, even with fireproofing in place and without any damage from plane impact.&quot; Jose L. Torero, formerly of the BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering at the University of Edinburgh, pursued further research into the potentially catastrophic effects of fire on real-scale buildings.

==Aftermath==
===Cleanup===

The cleanup was a massive operation coordinated by the City of New York Department of Design and Construction. On September 22, a preliminary cleanup plan was delivered by Controlled Demolition, Inc. (CDI) of Phoenix, Maryland. Costing hundreds of millions of dollars, it involved round-the-clock operations with many contractors and subcontractors. By early November, with a third of the debris removed, officials began to reduce the number of firefighters and police officers assigned to recovering the remains of victims, in order to prioritize the removal of debris. This caused confrontations with firefighters. Despite efforts to extinguish the blaze, the large pile of debris burned for three months, until the majority of the rubble was finally removed from the site. In 2007, the demolition of the surrounding damaged buildings was still ongoing as new construction proceeded on the World Trade Center&#x27;s replacement, One World Trade Center.

===Health effects===

The collapse of the World Trade Center produced enormous clouds of dust that covered Manhattan for days. On September 18, 2001, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assured the public that the air in Manhattan was &quot;safe to breathe&quot;. In 2003 the EPA&#x27;s inspector general found that the agency did not at that time have sufficient data to make such a statement. Dust from the collapse seriously reduced air quality and is likely the cause of many respiratory illnesses in lower Manhattan. Asbestosis is such an illness, and asbestos would have been present in the dust. Significant long term medical and psychological effects have been found among first responders including elevated levels of asthma, sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Health effects also extended to residents, students, and office workers of Lower Manhattan and nearby Chinatown. Several deaths have been linked to the toxic dust, and the victims&#x27; names will be included in the World Trade Center memorial. More than 18,000 people have suffered from illnesses from the dust.

<text>The Great Smoky Mountains (, &quot;Equa Dutsusdu Dodalv&quot;) are a mountain range rising along the Tennessee–North Carolina border in the southeastern United States. They are a subrange of the Appalachian Mountains and form part of the Blue Ridge Physiographic Province. The range is sometimes called the Smoky Mountains, and the name is commonly shortened to the Smokies. The Smokies are best known as the home of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which protects most of the range. The park was established in 1934 and, with over 11 million visits per year, is the most visited national park in the United States.

The Smokies are part of an International Biosphere Reserve. The range is home to an estimated of old-growth forest, constituting the largest such stand east of the Mississippi River. The coves hardwood forests in the range&#x27;s lower elevations are among the most diverse ecosystems in North America, and the Southern Appalachian spruce–fir forest that covers the upper elevations is the largest of its kind. The Smokies are home to the densest black bear population in the Eastern United States and the most diverse salamander population outside of the tropics.

Along with the biosphere reserve, the Great Smoky Mountains have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The U.S. National Park Service preserves and maintains 78 structures within the national park that were once part of the numerous small Appalachian communities scattered throughout the range&#x27;s river valleys and coves. The park contains five historic districts and nine individual listings on the National Register of Historic Places.

The name &quot;Smoky&quot; comes from the natural fog that often hangs over the range and presents as large smoke plumes from a distance. This fog is caused by the vegetation emitting volatile organic compounds, chemicals that have a high vapor pressure and easily form vapors at normal temperature and pressure.

==Geography==


The Great Smoky Mountains stretch from the Pigeon River in the northeast to the Little Tennessee River in the southeast. The northwestern half of the range gives way to a series of elongate ridges known as the &quot;Foothills,&quot; the outermost of which include Chilhowee Mountain and English Mountain. The range is roughly bounded on the south by the Tuckasegee River and to the southeast by Soco Creek and Jonathan Creek. The Smokies comprise parts of Blount County, Sevier County, and Cocke County in Tennessee and Swain County and Haywood County in North Carolina.

The sources of several rivers are located in the Smokies, including the Little Pigeon River, the Oconaluftee River, and Little River. Streams in the Smokies are part of the Tennessee River watershed and are thus entirely west of the Eastern Continental Divide. The largest stream entirely within the park is Abrams Creek, which rises in Cades Cove and empties into the Chilhowee Lake impoundment of the Little Tennessee River near Chilhowee Dam.

Other major streams include Hazel Creek and Eagle Creek in the southwest, Raven Fork near Oconaluftee, Cosby Creek near Cosby, and Roaring Fork near Gatlinburg. The Little Tennessee River passes through five impediments along the range&#x27;s southwestern boundary, namely Tellico Lake, Chilhowee Lake, Calderwood Lake, Cheoah Lake, and Fontana Lake.

===Notable peaks===
The highest point in the Smokies is Kuwohi, the tallest mountain in Tennessee, which rises to an elevation of . It has the range&#x27;s highest topographic prominence at . Mount Le Conte is the &quot;tallest&quot; (i.e., from immediate base to summit) mountain in the range, rising from its base in Gatlinburg to its summit.

===Climate===
The Smokies rise prominently above the surrounding low terrain. For example, Mount Le Conte () rises more than a mile (1.6 km) above its base. Because of their prominence, the Smokies receive a heavy annual amount of precipitation. Annual precipitation amounts range from , and snowfall in the winter can be heavy, especially on the higher slopes. For comparison, the surrounding terrain has annual precipitation of around . Flash flooding often occurs after heavy rain.

In 2004, the remnants of Hurricane Frances caused major flooding, landslides, and high winds, which were soon followed by Hurricane Ivan, making the situation worse. Other post-hurricanes, including Hurricane Hugo in 1989, have caused similar damage in the Smokies.

As for temperatures, the average temperature difference between the mountains (Newfound Gap around MSL and the valleys (Park Headquarters around MSL in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is between with highs and between with lows. The difference between high temperatures is similar to the moist adiabatic lapse rate (3.3 degrees Fahrenheit per 1,000 ft), while the smaller difference between low temperatures is the result of frequent temperature inversions developing in the morning, especially during autumn.

Strong damaging winds (, or sometimes greater) are observed a few times each year around the Smoky Mountains during the cool season (October through April), as a result of a phenomenon known as mountain waves. These mountain wave winds are strongest in a narrow area along the foothills and can create extensive areas of fallen trees and roof damage, especially around Cades Cove in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Camp Creek community. Strong winds created by mountain waves were a contributing factor with the devastating Gatlinburg fire on November 28, 2016, during the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires. Damaging winds can also be generated by strong thunderstorms, with tornadoes and strong thunderstorm complexes (also known as mesoscale convective systems) occasionally affecting the Smoky Mountains.

The climate of Kuwohi is hemiboreal (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Dcb&quot;). As with much of the southern Blue Ridge, the area qualifies as part of the Appalachian Rainforest. On the other hand, Gatlinburg&#x27;s climate is four-season subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;) under Köppen (oceanic &quot;Do&quot; under Trewartha), typical of Tennessee.



==Geology==
Most of the rocks in the Great Smoky Mountains consist of Late Precambrian rocks that are part of a formation known as the Ocoee Supergroup. The Ocoee Supergroup consists primarily of slightly metamorphosed sandstones, phyllites, schists, and slate. Early Precambrian rocks, which include the oldest rocks in the Smokies, comprise the dominant rock type in the Raven Fork Valley (in the Oconaluftee valley) and lower Tuckasegee River between Cherokee and Bryson City. They consist primarily of metamorphic gneiss, granite, and schist. Cambrian sedimentary rocks are found among the outer reaches of the Foothills to the northwest and in limestone coves such as Cades Cove.

The Precambrian gneiss and schists—the oldest rocks in the Smokies—formed over a billion years ago from the accumulation of marine sediments and igneous rock in a primordial ocean. In the Late Precambrian period, this ocean expanded, and the more recent Ocoee Supergroup rocks formed from accumulations of the eroding land mass onto the ocean&#x27;s continental shelf.

By the end of the Paleozoic era, the ancient ocean had deposited a thick layer of marine sediments which left behind sedimentary rocks such as limestone. During the Ordovician period, the North American and African plates collided, destroying the ancient ocean and initiating the Alleghenian orogeny—the mountain-building epoch that created the Appalachian range. The Mesozoic era saw the rapid erosion of the softer sedimentary rocks from the new mountains, re-exposing the older Ocoee Supergroup formations.

Around 20,000 years ago, subarctic glaciers advanced southward across North America, and although they never reached the Smokies, the advancing glaciers led to colder mean annual temperatures and an increase in precipitation throughout the range. Trees were unable to survive at the higher elevations and were replaced by tundra vegetation. Spruce-fir forests occupied the valleys and slopes below approximately . The persistent freezing and thawing during this period created the large blockfields that are often found at the base of large mountain slopes.

Between 16,500 and 12,500 years ago, the glaciers to the north retreated and mean annual temperatures rose. The tundra vegetation disappeared, and the spruce-fir forests retreated to the highest elevations. Hardwood trees moved into the region from the coastal plains, replacing the spruce-fir forests in the lower elevations. The temperatures continued warming until around 6,000 years ago, when they began to gradually grow cooler.

==Flora==
Heavy logging in the late 19th century and early 20th century devastated much of the forests of the Smokies, but the National Park Service estimates of old-growth forest remains, comprising the largest old-growth stand in the Eastern United States. Most of the forest is a mature second-growth hardwood forest. The range&#x27;s 1,600 species of flowering plants include over 100 species of native trees and 100 species of native shrubs. The Smokies are also home to over 450 species of non-vascular plants and 2,000 species of fungi.

The forests of the Smokies are typically divided into three zones:
* The cove hardwood forests in the stream valleys, coves, and lower mountain slopes
* The northern hardwood forests on the higher mountain slopes
* The spruce-fir or boreal forest at the very highest elevations

Appalachian balds—patches of land where trees are unexpectedly absent or sparse—are interspersed through the mid-to-upper elevations in the range. Balds include grassy balds, which are highland meadows covered primarily by thick grasses, and heath balds, which are dense thickets of rhododendron and mountain laurel typically occurring on narrow ridges. Mixed oak-pine forests are found on dry ridges, especially on the south-facing North Carolina side of the range. Stands dominated by the Eastern hemlock (&quot;Tsuga canadensis&quot;) are occasionally found along streams and broad slopes above .

===Cove hardwood forest===
Cove hardwood forests, which are native to southern Appalachia, are among the most diverse forest types in North America. The cove hardwood forests of the Smokies are mostly second-growth, although some are still old-growth. The Albright Grove along the Maddron Bald Trail (between Gatlinburg and Cosby) is an accessible old-growth forest with some of the oldest and tallest trees in the entire range.

Over 130 species of trees are found among the canopies of the cove hardwood forests in the Smokies. The dominant species include yellow birch (&quot;Betula alleghaniensis&quot;), basswood (&quot;Tilia americana&quot;), yellow buckeye (&quot;Aesculus flava&quot;), tulip tree (&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot;; commonly called &quot;tulip poplar&quot;), silverbells (&quot;Halesia carolina&quot;), sugar maple (&quot;Acer saccharum&quot;), cucumber magnolia (&quot;Magnolia acuminata&quot;), shagbark hickory (&quot;Carya ovata&quot;), Carolina hemlock (&quot;Tsuga caroliniana&quot;) and eastern hemlock (&quot;Tsuga canadensis&quot;). The American chestnut (&quot;Castanea dentata&quot;), which was arguably the most beloved tree of the range&#x27;s pre-park inhabitants, was killed off by the introduced Chestnut blight in the 1920s.

The understories of the cove hardwood forest contain dozens of species of shrubs and vines. Dominant species in the Smokies include the Eastern redbud (&quot;Cercis canadensis&quot;), flowering dogwood (&quot;Cornus florida&quot;), Catawba rhododendron (&quot;Rhododendron catawbiense&quot;), mountain laurel (&quot;Kalmia latifolia&quot;), and smooth hydrangea (&quot;Hydrangea arborescens&quot;).

===Northern hardwood forest===
The mean annual temperatures in the higher elevations in the Smokies are cool enough to support forest types more commonly found in the northern United States. The northern hardwood forests constitute the highest broad-leaved forest in the eastern United States. About are old-growth.

In the Smokies, the northern hardwood canopies are dominated by yellow birch (&quot;Betula alleghaniensis&quot;) and American beech (&quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot;). White basswood (&quot;Tilia heterophylla&quot;), mountain maple (&quot;Acer spicatum&quot;) and striped maple (&quot;Acer pensylvanicum&quot;), and yellow buckeye (&quot;Aesculus flava&quot;) are also present. The understory is home to diverse species such as coneflower, skunk goldenrod, Rugels ragwort, bloodroot, hydrangea, and several species of grasses and ferns.

A unique community is the beech gap, or beech orchard. Beech gaps consist of high mountain gaps that have been monopolized by beech trees. The beech trees are often twisted and contorted by the high winds that occur in these gaps. Why other tree types such as the red spruce fail to encroach into the beech gaps is unknown.

===Spruce-fir forest===
The Southern Appalachian spruce–fir forest—also called the &quot;boreal&quot; or &quot;Canadian&quot; forest—is a relict of the ice ages, when mean annual temperatures in the Smokies were too cold to support a hardwood forest. While the rise in temperatures between 12,500 and 6,000 years ago allowed the hardwoods to return, the spruce-fir forest has managed to survive on the harsh mountain tops, typically above . About of the spruce-fir forest are old-growth.

The spruce-fir forest consists primarily of two conifer species—red spruce (&quot;Picea rubens&quot;) and Fraser fir (&quot;Abies fraseri&quot;). The Fraser firs, which are native to southern Appalachia, once dominated elevations above in the Smokies. Most of these firs were killed, however, by an infestation of the balsam wooly adelgid, which arrived in the Smokies in the early 1960s. Thus, red spruce is now the dominant species in the range&#x27;s spruce-fir forest. Large stands of dead Fraser firs remain atop Kuwohi and on the northwestern slopes of Old Black. While much of the red spruce stands were logged in the 1910s, the tree is still common throughout the range above . Some of the red spruces are believed to be 300 years old, and the tallest rise to over .

The main difference between the Southern Appalachian spruce–fir forest and the spruce-fir forests in northern latitudes is the dense broad-leaved understory of the former, which are home to catawba rhododendron, mountain ash, pin cherry, thornless blackberry, and hobblebush. The herbaceous and litter layers are poorly lit year-round and are thus dominated by shade-tolerant plants such as ferns, namely mountain wood fern and northern lady fern, and over 280 species of mosses.

===Wildflowers===


Many wildflowers grow in mountains and valleys, including bee balm, Solomon&#x27;s seal, Dutchman&#x27;s breeches, various trilliums, the Dragon&#x27;s Advocate and even hardy orchids. There are two native species of rhododendron in the area. The catawba rhododendron has purple flowers in May and June, while the rosebay rhododendron has longer leaves and white or light pink blooms in June and July.

The orange- to sometimes red-flowered and deciduous flame azalea closely follows along with the catawbas. The closely related mountain laurel blooms in between the two, and all of the blooms progress from lower to higher elevations. The reverse is true in autumn, when nearly bare mountaintops covered in rime ice (frozen fog) can be separated from green valleys by very bright and varied leaf colors. The rhododendrons are broadleafs, whose leaves droop in order to shed wet and heavy snows that come through the region during winter.

==Fauna==
The Great Smoky Mountains are home to 66 species of mammals, over 240 species of birds, 43 species of amphibians, 60 species of fish, and 40 species of reptiles. The range has the densest black bear population east of the Mississippi River. The black bear has come to symbolize wildlife in the Smokies, and the animal frequently appears on the covers of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park&#x27;s literature. Most of the range&#x27;s adult eastern black bears weigh between , although some grow to more than .

Other mammals include the white-tailed deer, the population of which drastically expanded with the creation of the national park. The bobcat is the only remaining wild cat species, although sightings of cougars, which once thrived in the area, are still occasionally reported. The coyote is not believed to be native to the range but has moved into the area in recent years and is treated as a native species. Two species of fox (red fox and the gray fox) are found within the Smokies, with red foxes being documented at all elevations.

European boar, introduced as game animals in the early 20th century, thrive in southern Appalachia but are considered a nuisance because of their tendency to root up and destroy plants. The boars are seen as taking food resources away from bears as well, and the park service has sponsored a program that pays individuals to hunt and kill boars and leave their bodies in locations frequented by bears.

The Smokies are home to over two dozen species of rodents, including the endangered northern flying squirrel and 10 species of bats, including the endangered Indiana bat. The National Park Service has successfully reintroduced river otters and elk. An attempt to reintroduce the red wolf in the early 1990s ultimately failed. These wolves were removed from the park and relocated to the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in North Carolina.

The Smokies are home to a diverse bird population due to the presence of multiple forest types. Species that thrive in southern hardwood forests, such as the red-eyed vireo, wood thrush, wild turkey, northern parula, ruby-throated hummingbird, and tufted titmouse, are found throughout the lower elevations and cove hardwood forests. Species more typical of cooler climates, such as the raven, winter wren, black-capped chickadee, yellow-bellied sapsucker, dark-eyed junco, and Blackburnian, chestnut-sided, and Canada warblers, are found in the sruce-fir and northern hardwood zones.

Ovenbirds, whip-poor-wills, and downy woodpeckers live in the drier pine-oak forests and heath balds. Bald eagles and golden eagles have been spotted at all elevations in the park. Peregrine falcon sightings are also not uncommon, and a peregrine falcon eyrie is known to have existed near Alum Cave Bluffs throughout the 1930s. Red-tailed hawks, the most common hawk species, have been sighted at all elevations. Owl species include the barred owl, eastern screech owl, and northern saw-whet owl.

The timber rattlesnake, one of two venomous snake species in the Smokies, is found at all elevations. The other venomous snake, the copperhead, is typically found at lower elevations. Other reptiles include the eastern box turtle, the eastern fence lizard, the black rat snake, and the northern water snake.

The Smokies are home to one of the world&#x27;s most diverse salamander populations. Five of the world&#x27;s nine families of salamanders are found in the range, consisting of up to 31 species. The red-cheeked salamander is found only in the Smokies. The imitator salamander is found only in the Smokies and the nearby Plott Balsams and Great Balsam Mountains. Two other species—the southern gray-cheeked salamander and the southern Appalachian salamander—occur only in the general region. Other species include the shovelnose salamander, blackbelly salamander, eastern red-spotted newt, and spotted dusky salamander. The hellbender inhabits swift streams. Other amphibians include the American toad and the American bullfrog, wood frog, upland chorus frog, northern green frog, and spring peeper.

Fish include trout, lamprey, darter, shiner, bass, and sucker. The brook trout is the only trout species native to the range, although northwestern rainbow trout and European brown trout were introduced in the first half of the 20th century. The larger rainbow and brown trout outcompete the native brook trout for food and habitat at lower elevations. As such, most of the brook trout found in the park today are in streams above 3,000 feet in elevation. Trout generally smaller than in different locales. Protected fish species include the smoky madtom and yellowfin madtom, the spotfin chub, and the duskytail darter.

The firefly &quot;Photinus carolinus&quot;, whose synchronized flashing light displays occur in mid-June, is native to the Smoky Mountains with a population epicenter near Elkmont, Tennessee.

==Ecosystem threats==
Air pollution is contributing to increased red spruce tree mortality at higher elevations and oak decline at lower elevations, while invasive hemlock woolly adelgids attack hemlocks, and balsam woolly adelgids attack Fraser firs. &quot;Pseudoscymnus tsugae&quot;, a type of beetle in the ladybug family, Coccinellidae, has been introduced in an attempt to control the pests.

Visibility is dramatically reduced by smog from both the Southeastern United States and the Midwest, and smog forecasts are prepared daily by the Environmental Protection Agency for both nearby Knoxville, Tennessee and Asheville, North Carolina.

Environmental threats are the concern of many non-profit environmental stewardship groups, especially The Friends of the Smokies. Formed in 1993, the group assists the National Park Service in its mission to preserve and protect the Great Smoky Mountains National Park by raising funds and public awareness, and providing volunteers for needed projects.

==History==
===Prehistory===
Native Americans have likely been hunting in the Great Smoky Mountains for 14,000 years. Numerous Archaic period (–1000 B.C.) artifacts have been found within the national park&#x27;s boundaries, including projectile points uncovered along likely animal migration paths. Woodland period ( - 1000 A.D.) sites found within the park contained 2,000-year-old ceramics and evidence of primitive agriculture.

The increasing reliance upon agriculture during the Mississippian period (–1600 A.D.) lured Native Americans away from the game-rich forests of the Smokies and into the fertile river valleys on the outer fringe of the range. Substantial Mississippian-period villages were uncovered at Citico and Toqua (named after the Cherokee villages that later thrived at these sites) along the Little Tennessee River in the 1960s. Fortified Mississippian-period villages have been excavated at the McMahan Indian Mounds in Sevierville and as well as mounds in Townsend.

Most of these villages were part of a minor chiefdom centered on a large village known as Chiaha, which was located on an island now submerged by Douglas Lake. The 1540 expedition of Hernando de Soto and the 1567 expedition of Juan Pardo passed through the French Broad River valley north of the Smokies, both spending a considerable amount of time at Chiaha. The Pardo expedition followed a trail across the flanks of Chilhowee Mountain to the Mississippian-period villages at Chilhowee and Citico (Pardo&#x27;s notary called them by their Muskogean names, &quot;Chalahume&quot; and &quot;Satapo&quot;).

===Cherokee===
By the time the first English explorers arrived in southern Appalachia in the late 17th century, the Cherokee controlled much of the region, and the Great Smoky Mountains lay at the center of their territory. One Cherokee legend tells of a magical lake hidden deep within the range but inaccessible to humans. Another tells of a captured Shawnee medicine man named Aganunitsi who, in exchange for his freedom, travels to the remote sections of the range in search of the Uktena. The Cherokee called Gregory Bald &quot;Tsitsuyi&quot; ᏥᏧᏱ, or &quot;rabbit place,&quot; and believed the mountain to be the domain of the Great Rabbit. Other Cherokee place names in the Smokies included &quot;Duniskwalgunyi&quot; ᏚᏂᏍᏆᎫᏂ, or &quot;forked antlers&quot;, which refers to the Chimney Tops, and &quot;kuwahi&quot; ᎫᏩᎯ, or &quot;mulberry place&quot;.

Most Cherokee settlements were located in the river valleys on the outer fringe of the Smokies, which along with the Unicoi Mountains provided the main bulwark dividing the Overhill Cherokee villages in modern Tennessee from the Cherokee Middle towns in modern North Carolina. The Overhill town of Chilhowee was situated at the confluence of Abrams Creek and the Little Tennessee, and the Overhill town of Tallassee was located just a few miles upstream near modern Calderwood (both village sites are now under Chilhowee Lake). A string of Overhill villages, including Chota and Tanasi, dotted the Little Tennessee valley north of Chilhowee.

The Cherokee Middle towns included the village of Kittowa (which the Cherokee believed to be their oldest village) along the Tuckasegee River near Bryson City. The village of Oconaluftee, which was situated along the Oconaluftee River near the modern Oconaluftee Visitor Center, was the only known permanent Cherokee village located within the national park&#x27;s boundaries. Sporadic or seasonal settlements were located in Cades Cove and the Hazel Creek valley.

===European settlement===
European explorers and settlers began arriving in Western North Carolina and East Tennessee in the mid-18th century. The influx of settlers at the end of the French and Indian War brought conflict with the Cherokee, who still held legal title to much of the land. When the Cherokee aligned themselves with the British at the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1776, American forces launched an invasion of Cherokee territory.

The Middle towns, including Kittuwa, were burned by General Griffith Rutherford, and several of the Overhill towns were burned by John Sevier. By 1805, the Cherokee had ceded control of the Smokies to the U.S. government. Although much of the tribe was forced west along the Trail of Tears in 1838, a few—largely through the efforts of William Holland Thomas—managed to retain their land on the Qualla Boundary and today comprise the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.

In the 1780s, several frontier outposts had been established along the outskirts of the Smokies, namely Whitson&#x27;s Fort in what is now Cosby and Wear&#x27;s Fort in what is now Pigeon Forge. Permanent settlers began arriving in these areas in the 1790s. In 1801, the Whaley brothers, William and John, moved from North Carolina to become the first settlers in what is now the Greenbrier section of the park.

In 1802, Edgefield, South Carolina resident William Ogle arrived in White Oak Flats where he cut and prepared logs for cabin construction. Although Ogle died shortly after returning to Edgefield, his wife, Martha Jane Huskey, eventually returned with her family and several other families to White Oak Flats, becoming the first permanent settlers in what would eventually become Gatlinburg. Their children and grandchildren spread out southward into the Sugarlands and Roaring Fork areas.

Cades Cove was settled largely by families who had purchased lots from land speculator William &quot;Fighting Billy&quot; Tipton. The first of these settlers, John and Lucretia Oliver, arrived in 1818. Two Cades Cove settlers, Moses and Patience Proctor, crossed over to the North Carolina side of the Smokies in 1836 to become the first Euro-American settlers in the Hazel Creek area. The Cataloochee area was first settled by the Caldwell family, who migrated to the valley in 1834.

Like most of southern Appalachia, the early 19th-century economy of the Smokies relied on subsistence agriculture. The average farm consisted of roughly , part of which was cultivated and part of which was woodland. Early settlers lived in log cabins, although these were replaced by more elaborate log houses and eventually, as lumber became available, by modern frame houses. Most farms included at least one barn, a springhouse (used for refrigeration), a smokehouse (used for curing meat), a chicken coop (protected chickens from predators), and a corn crib (kept corn dry and protected it from rodents). Some of the more industrious farmers operated gristmills, general stores, and sorghum presses. Religion was a central theme in the lives of the early residents of the Smokies, and community life was typically centered on churches. Christian Protestantism—especially Primitive Baptists, Missionary Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians; dominated the religious culture of the region.

===American Civil War===
While both Tennessee and North Carolina joined the Confederacy at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Union sentiment in the Great Smoky Mountains was much stronger relative to other regions in these two states. Generally, the communities on the Tennessee side of the Smokies supported the Union, while communities on the North Carolina side supported the Confederates. On the Tennessee side, 74% of Cocke Countians, 80% of Blount Countians, and 96% of Sevier Countians voted against secession. In the North Carolina Smokies—Cherokee, Haywood, Jackson, and Macon counties—about 46% of the population favored secession.

While no major engagements took place in the Smokies, minor skirmishes were fairly common. Cherokee chief William Holland Thomas formed a Confederate legion made up mostly of Cherokee soldiers. Thomas&#x27; Legion crossed the Smokies in 1862 and occupied Gatlinburg for several months to protect saltpeter mines atop Mount Le Conte. Residents of predominantly Union Cades Cove and predominantly Confederate Hazel Creek routinely crossed the mountains to steal one another&#x27;s livestock. Residents of Cosby and Cataloochee did likewise. One notable Civil War incident was the murder of long-time Cades Cove resident Russell Gregory (for whom Gregory Bald is named), which was carried out by bushwhackers in 1864 shortly after Gregory had led an ambush that routed a band of Confederates seeking to wreak havoc in the cove. Another incident was George Kirk&#x27;s raid on Cataloochee, in which Kirk killed or wounded 15 Union soldiers recovering at a makeshift hospital.

===Logging===
While selective logging occurred in the Great Smoky Mountains throughout the 19th century, the general inaccessibility of the forests prevented major logging operations, and lumber firms relied on the lowland forests in the northeastern United States and the Mississippi Delta in the southeast. As timber resources in these regions became exhausted, and as the demand for lumber skyrocketed after the Civil War, entrepreneurs began looking for ways to reach the virgin forests of southern Appalachia. The first logging operations in the Smokies, which began in the 1880s, used splash dams or booms to float logs down rivers to lumber mills in nearby cities. Notable splash dam and boom operations included the English Lumber Company on Little River, the Taylor and Crate operations along Hazel Creek, and the ambitious operations of Alexander Arthur on the Pigeon River. All three of these operations failed within their first few years, however, after their dams and boom systems were destroyed by floods.

Innovations in logging railroads and band saw technology in the late 19th century made large-scale logging possible in the mountainous areas of southern Appalachia. The largest logging operation in the Smokies was the Little River Lumber Company, which logged the Little River watershed between 1901 and 1939. The company also established company towns at Townsend (named for the company&#x27;s chief owner and manager, Wilson B. Townsend), Elkmont, and Tremont.

The second-largest operation was the Ritter Lumber Company, which logged the Hazel Creek watershed between 1907 and 1928. Ruins of Ritter&#x27;s lumbering operations are still visible along the Hazel Creek Trail. Other lumbering operations included Three M Lumber and Champion Fibre, both of which logged the Oconaluftee watershed. By the time all operations ceased in the 1930s, logging firms had removed two-thirds of the virgin forests from the Smokies. According to the National Park Service, 80% of the Smokies was clear cut in the early 20th century.

===National park===
Wilson B. Townsend, the head of Little River Lumber, began advertising Elkmont as a tourist destination in 1909. Within a few years, the Wonderland Hotel and the Appalachian Club had been established to cater to elite Knoxvillians seeking summer mountain getaways. In the early 1920s, several Appalachian Club members, among them Knoxville businessman Colonel David Chapman, began seriously considering a movement to establish a national park in the Smokies. As head of the Great Smoky Mountains Park Commission, Chapman was largely responsible for raising funds for land purchases and coordinating park efforts between local, state, and federal entities.

The creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park proved much more complex than the creation of its predecessors, such as Yellowstone and Yosemite, which were already federally owned. Along with convincing logging firms to sell lucrative lumber rights, the Park Commission had to negotiate the purchase of thousands of small farms and remove entire communities. The commission also had to deal with the Tennessee and North Carolina legislatures, which at times were opposed to spending taxpayer money on park efforts. In spite of these difficulties, the Park Commission had completed most major land purchases by 1932. The national park officially opened in 1934, with President Franklin D. Roosevelt presiding over the opening ceremony at Newfound Gap.

==Culture and tourism==
The culture of the area is that of southern Appalachia, and previously the Cherokee people. Tourism is key to the area&#x27;s economy, particularly in cities like Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg, and Cherokee. In 2006, the Great Smoky Mountains Heritage Center opened in Townsend with the mission of preserving various aspects of the region&#x27;s culture. The Tennessee Smokies baseball team plays in Sevierville and is named for the mountain range.

The Great Smoky Mountains are home to The Gatlinburg SkyLift and SkyBridge.
The SkyBridge is the longest skybridge in the United States, at about 680 feet long.

<text>Automatic summarization is the process of shortening a set of data computationally, to create a subset (a summary) that represents the most important or relevant information within the original content. Artificial intelligence algorithms are commonly developed and employed to achieve this, specialized for different types of data.

Text summarization is usually implemented by natural language processing methods, designed to locate the most informative sentences in a given document. On the other hand, visual content can be summarized using computer vision algorithms. Image summarization is the subject of ongoing research; existing approaches typically attempt to display the most representative images from a given image collection, or generate a video that only includes the most important content from the entire collection. Video summarization algorithms identify and extract from the original video content the most important frames (&quot;key-frames&quot;), and/or the most important video segments (&quot;key-shots&quot;), normally in a temporally ordered fashion. Video summaries simply retain a carefully selected subset of the original video frames and, therefore, are not identical to the output of video synopsis algorithms, where &quot;new&quot; video frames are being synthesized based on the original video content.

== Commercial products ==
In 2022 Google Docs released an automatic summarization feature.

==Approaches==

There are two general approaches to automatic summarization: extraction and abstraction.

===Extraction-based summarization===

Here, content is extracted from the original data, but the extracted content is not modified in any way. Examples of extracted content include key-phrases that can be used to &quot;tag&quot; or index a text document, or key sentences (including headings) that collectively comprise an abstract, and representative images or video segments, as stated above. For text, extraction is analogous to the process of skimming, where the summary (if available), headings and subheadings, figures, the first and last paragraphs of a section, and optionally the first and last sentences in a paragraph are read before one chooses to read the entire document in detail. Other examples of extraction that include key sequences of text in terms of clinical relevance (including patient/problem, intervention, and outcome).

===Abstractive-based summarization===

Abstractive summarization methods generate new text that did not exist in the original text. This has been applied mainly for text. Abstractive methods build an internal semantic representation of the original content (often called a language model), and then use this representation to create a summary that is closer to what a human might express. Abstraction may transform the extracted content by paraphrasing sections of the source document, to condense a text more strongly than extraction. Such transformation, however, is computationally much more challenging than extraction, involving both natural language processing and often a deep understanding of the domain of the original text in cases where the original document relates to a special field of knowledge. &quot;Paraphrasing&quot; is even more difficult to apply to images and videos, which is why most summarization systems are extractive.

===Aided summarization===

Approaches aimed at higher summarization quality rely on combined software and human effort. In Machine Aided Human Summarization, extractive techniques highlight candidate passages for inclusion (to which the human adds or removes text). In Human Aided Machine Summarization, a human post-processes software output, in the same way that one edits the output of automatic translation by Google Translate.

==Applications and systems for summarization==
There are broadly two types of extractive summarization tasks depending on what the summarization program focuses on. The first is &quot;generic summarization&quot;, which focuses on obtaining a generic summary or abstract of the collection (whether documents, or sets of images, or videos, news stories etc.). The second is &quot;query relevant summarization&quot;, sometimes called &quot;query-based summarization&quot;, which summarizes objects specific to a query. Summarization systems are able to create both query relevant text summaries and generic machine-generated summaries depending on what the user needs.

An example of a summarization problem is document summarization, which attempts to automatically produce an abstract from a given document. Sometimes one might be interested in generating a summary from a single source document, while others can use multiple source documents (for example, a cluster of articles on the same topic). This problem is called multi-document summarization. A related application is summarizing news articles. Imagine a system, which automatically pulls together news articles on a given topic (from the web), and concisely represents the latest news as a summary.

Image collection summarization is another application example of automatic summarization. It consists in selecting a representative set of images from a larger set of images. A summary in this context is useful to show the most representative images of results in an image collection exploration system. Video summarization is a related domain, where the system automatically creates a trailer of a long video. This also has applications in consumer or personal videos, where one might want to skip the boring or repetitive actions. Similarly, in surveillance videos, one would want to extract important and suspicious activity, while ignoring all the boring and redundant frames captured.

At a very high level, summarization algorithms try to find subsets of objects (like set of sentences, or a set of images), which cover information of the entire set. This is also called the &quot;core-set&quot;. These algorithms model notions like diversity, coverage, information and representativeness of the summary. Query based summarization techniques, additionally model for relevance of the summary with the query. Some techniques and algorithms which naturally model summarization problems are TextRank and PageRank, Submodular set function, Determinantal point process, maximal marginal relevance (MMR) etc.

===Keyphrase extraction===
The task is the following. You are given a piece of text, such as a journal article, and you must produce a list of keywords or key[phrase]s that capture the primary topics discussed in the text. In the case of research articles, many authors provide manually assigned keywords, but most text lacks pre-existing keyphrases. For example, news articles rarely have keyphrases attached, but it would be useful to be able to automatically do so for a number of applications discussed below.
Consider the example text from a news article:

:&quot;The Army Corps of Engineers, rushing to meet President Bush&#x27;s promise to protect New Orleans by the start of the 2006 hurricane season, installed defective flood-control pumps last year despite warnings from its own expert that the equipment would fail during a storm, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press&quot;.

A keyphrase extractor might select &quot;Army Corps of Engineers&quot;, &quot;President Bush&quot;, &quot;New Orleans&quot;, and &quot;defective flood-control pumps&quot; as keyphrases. These are pulled directly from the text. In contrast, an abstractive keyphrase system would somehow internalize the content and generate keyphrases that do not appear in the text, but more closely resemble what a human might produce, such as &quot;political negligence&quot; or &quot;inadequate protection from floods&quot;. Abstraction requires a deep understanding of the text, which makes it difficult for a computer system.
Keyphrases have many applications. They can enable document browsing by providing a short summary, improve information retrieval (if documents have keyphrases assigned, a user could search by keyphrase to produce more reliable hits than a full-text search), and be employed in generating index entries for a large text corpus.

Depending on the different literature and the definition of key terms, words or phrases, keyword extraction is a highly related theme.

====Supervised learning approaches====
Beginning with the work of Turney, many researchers have approached keyphrase extraction as a supervised machine learning problem.
Given a document, we construct an example for each unigram, bigram, and trigram found in the text (though other text units are also possible, as discussed below). We then compute various features describing each example (e.g., does the phrase begin with an upper-case letter?). We assume there are known keyphrases available for a set of training documents. Using the known keyphrases, we can assign positive or negative labels to the examples. Then we learn a classifier that can discriminate between positive and negative examples as a function of the features. Some classifiers make a binary classification for a test example, while others assign a probability of being a keyphrase. For instance, in the above text, we might learn a rule that says phrases with initial capital letters are likely to be keyphrases.
After training a learner, we can select keyphrases for test documents in the following manner. We apply the same example-generation strategy to the test documents, then run each example through the learner. We can determine the keyphrases by looking at binary classification decisions or probabilities returned from our learned model. If probabilities are given, a threshold is used to select the keyphrases.
Keyphrase extractors are generally evaluated using precision and recall. Precision measures how
many of the proposed keyphrases are actually correct. Recall measures how many of the true
keyphrases your system proposed. The two measures can be combined in an F-score, which is the
harmonic mean of the two (&quot;F&quot; = 2&quot;PR&quot;/(&quot;P&quot; + &quot;R&quot;) ). Matches between the proposed keyphrases and the known keyphrases can be checked after stemming or applying some other text normalization.

Designing a supervised keyphrase extraction system involves deciding on several choices (some of these apply to unsupervised, too). The first choice is exactly how to generate examples. Turney and others have used all possible unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams without intervening punctuation and after removing stopwords. Hulth showed that you can get some improvement by selecting examples to be sequences of tokens that match certain patterns of part-of-speech tags. Ideally, the mechanism for generating examples produces all the known labeled keyphrases as candidates, though this is often not the case. For example, if we use only unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, then we will never be able to extract a known keyphrase containing four words. Thus, recall may suffer. However, generating too many examples can also lead to low precision.

We also need to create features that describe the examples and are informative enough to allow a learning algorithm to discriminate keyphrases from non- keyphrases. Typically features involve various term frequencies (how many times a phrase appears in the current text or in a larger corpus), the length of the example, relative position of the first occurrence, various Boolean syntactic features (e.g., contains all caps), etc. The Turney paper used about 12 such features. Hulth uses a reduced set of features, which were found most successful in the KEA (Keyphrase Extraction Algorithm) work derived from Turney&#x27;s seminal paper.

In the end, the system will need to return a list of keyphrases for a test document, so we need to have a way to limit the number. Ensemble methods (i.e., using votes from several classifiers) have been used to produce numeric scores that can be thresholded to provide a user-provided number of keyphrases. This is the technique used by Turney with C4.5 decision trees. Hulth used a single binary classifier so the learning algorithm implicitly determines the appropriate number.

Once examples and features are created, we need a way to learn to predict keyphrases. Virtually any supervised learning algorithm could be used, such as decision trees, Naive Bayes, and rule induction. In the case of Turney&#x27;s GenEx algorithm, a genetic algorithm is used to learn parameters for a domain-specific keyphrase extraction algorithm. The extractor follows a series of heuristics to identify keyphrases. The genetic algorithm optimizes parameters for these heuristics with respect to performance on training documents with known key phrases.

====Unsupervised approach: TextRank====
Another keyphrase extraction algorithm is TextRank. While supervised methods have some nice properties, like being able to produce interpretable rules for what features characterize a keyphrase, they also require a large amount of training data. Many documents with known keyphrases are needed. Furthermore, training on a specific domain tends to customize the extraction process to that domain, so the resulting classifier is not necessarily portable, as some of Turney&#x27;s results demonstrate.
Unsupervised keyphrase extraction removes the need for training data. It approaches the problem from a different angle. Instead of trying to learn explicit features that characterize keyphrases, the TextRank algorithm exploits the structure of the text itself to determine keyphrases that appear &quot;central&quot; to the text in the same way that PageRank selects important Web pages. Recall this is based on the notion of &quot;prestige&quot; or &quot;recommendation&quot; from social networks. In this way, TextRank does not rely on any previous training data at all, but rather can be run on any arbitrary piece of text, and it can produce output simply based on the text&#x27;s intrinsic properties. Thus the algorithm is easily portable to new domains and languages.

TextRank is a general purpose graph-based ranking algorithm for NLP. Essentially, it runs PageRank on a graph specially designed for a particular NLP task. For keyphrase extraction, it builds a graph using some set of text units as vertices. Edges are based on some measure of semantic or lexical similarity between the text unit vertices. Unlike PageRank, the edges are typically undirected and can be weighted to reflect a degree of similarity. Once the graph is constructed, it is used to form a stochastic matrix, combined with a damping factor (as in the &quot;random surfer model&quot;), and the ranking over vertices is obtained by finding the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 1 (i.e., the stationary distribution of the random walk on the graph).

The vertices should correspond to what we want to rank. Potentially, we could do something similar to the supervised methods and create a vertex for each unigram, bigram, trigram, etc. However, to keep the graph small, the authors decide to rank individual unigrams in a first step, and then include a second step that merges highly ranked adjacent unigrams to form multi-word phrases. This has a nice side effect of allowing us to produce keyphrases of arbitrary length. For example, if we rank unigrams and find that &quot;advanced&quot;, &quot;natural&quot;, &quot;language&quot;, and &quot;processing&quot; all get high ranks, then we would look at the original text and see that these words appear consecutively and create a final keyphrase using all four together. Note that the unigrams placed in the graph can be filtered by part of speech. The authors found that adjectives and nouns were the best to include. Thus, some linguistic knowledge comes into play in this step.

Edges are created based on word co-occurrence in this application of TextRank. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the unigrams appear within a window of size N in the original text. N is typically around 2–10. Thus, &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;language&quot; might be linked in a text about NLP. &quot;Natural&quot; and &quot;processing&quot; would also be linked because they would both appear in the same string of N words. These edges build on the notion of &quot;text cohesion&quot; and the idea that words that appear near each other are likely related in a meaningful way and &quot;recommend&quot; each other to the reader.

Since this method simply ranks the individual vertices, we need a way to threshold or produce a limited number of keyphrases. The technique chosen is to set a count T to be a user-specified fraction of the total number of vertices in the graph. Then the top T vertices/unigrams are selected based on their stationary probabilities. A post- processing step is then applied to merge adjacent instances of these T unigrams. As a result, potentially more or less than T final keyphrases will be produced, but the number should be roughly proportional to the length of the original text.

It is not initially clear why applying PageRank to a co-occurrence graph would produce useful keyphrases. One way to think about it is the following. A word that appears multiple times throughout a text may have many different co-occurring neighbors. For example, in a text about machine learning, the unigram &quot;learning&quot; might co-occur with &quot;machine&quot;, &quot;supervised&quot;, &quot;un-supervised&quot;, and &quot;semi-supervised&quot; in four different sentences. Thus, the &quot;learning&quot; vertex would be a central &quot;hub&quot; that connects to these other modifying words. Running PageRank/TextRank on the graph is likely to rank &quot;learning&quot; highly. Similarly, if the text contains the phrase &quot;supervised classification&quot;, then there would be an edge between &quot;supervised&quot; and &quot;classification&quot;. If &quot;classification&quot; appears several other places and thus has many neighbors, its importance would contribute to the importance of &quot;supervised&quot;. If it ends up with a high rank, it will be selected as one of the top T unigrams, along with &quot;learning&quot; and probably &quot;classification&quot;. In the final post-processing step, we would then end up with keyphrases &quot;supervised learning&quot; and &quot;supervised classification&quot;.

In short, the co-occurrence graph will contain densely connected regions for terms that appear often and in different contexts. A random walk on this graph will have a stationary distribution that assigns large probabilities to the terms in the centers of the clusters. This is similar to densely connected Web pages getting ranked highly by PageRank. This approach has also been used in document summarization, considered below.

===Document summarization===
Like keyphrase extraction, document summarization aims to identify the essence of a text. The only real difference is that now we are dealing with larger text units—whole sentences instead of words and phrases.

====Supervised learning approaches====
Supervised text summarization is very much like supervised keyphrase extraction. Basically, if you have a collection of documents and human-generated summaries for them, you can learn features of sentences that make them good candidates for inclusion in the summary. Features might include the position in the document (i.e., the first few sentences are probably important), the number of words in the sentence, etc. The main difficulty in supervised extractive summarization is that the known summaries must be manually created by extracting sentences so the sentences in an original training document can be labeled as &quot;in summary&quot; or &quot;not in summary&quot;. This is not typically how people create summaries, so simply using journal abstracts or existing summaries is usually not sufficient. The sentences in these summaries do not necessarily match up with sentences in the original text, so it would be difficult to assign labels to examples for training. Note, however, that these natural summaries can still be used for evaluation purposes, since ROUGE-1 evaluation only considers unigrams.

====Maximum entropy-based summarization====
During the DUC 2001 and 2002 evaluation workshops, TNO developed a sentence extraction system for multi-document summarization in the news domain. The system was based on a hybrid system using a Naive Bayes classifier and statistical language models for modeling salience. Although the system exhibited good results, the researchers wanted to explore the effectiveness of a maximum entropy (ME) classifier for the meeting summarization task, as ME is known to be robust against feature dependencies. Maximum entropy has also been applied successfully for summarization in the broadcast news domain.

==== Adaptive summarization ====
A promising approach is adaptive document/text summarization. It involves first recognizing the text genre and then applying summarization algorithms optimized for this genre. Such software has been created.

====TextRank and LexRank====
The unsupervised approach to summarization is also quite similar in spirit to unsupervised keyphrase extraction and gets around the issue of costly training data. Some unsupervised summarization approaches are based on finding a &quot;centroid&quot; sentence, which is the mean word vector of all the sentences in the document. Then the sentences can be ranked with regard to their similarity to this centroid sentence.

A more principled way to estimate sentence importance is using random walks and eigenvector centrality. LexRank is an algorithm essentially identical to TextRank, and both use this approach for document summarization. The two methods were developed by different groups at the same time, and LexRank simply focused on summarization, but could just as easily be used for keyphrase extraction or any other NLP ranking task.

In both LexRank and TextRank, a graph is constructed by creating a vertex for each sentence in the document.

The edges between sentences are based on some form of semantic similarity or content overlap. While LexRank uses cosine similarity of TF-IDF vectors, TextRank uses a very similar measure based on the number of words two sentences have in common (normalized by the sentences&#x27; lengths). The LexRank paper explored using unweighted edges after applying a threshold to the cosine values, but also experimented with using edges with weights equal to the similarity score. TextRank uses continuous similarity scores as weights.

In both algorithms, the sentences are ranked by applying PageRank to the resulting graph. A summary is formed by combining the top ranking sentences, using a threshold or length cutoff to limit the size of the summary.

It is worth noting that TextRank was applied to summarization exactly as described here, while LexRank was used as part of a larger summarization system (MEAD) that combines the LexRank score (stationary probability) with other features like sentence position and length using a linear combination with either user-specified or automatically tuned weights. In this case, some training documents might be needed, though the TextRank results show the additional features are not absolutely necessary.

Unlike TextRank, LexRank has been applied to multi-document summarization.

====Multi-document summarization====

Multi-document summarization is an automatic procedure aimed at extraction of information from multiple texts written about the same topic. Resulting summary report allows individual users, such as professional information consumers, to quickly familiarize themselves with information contained in a large cluster of documents. In such a way, multi-document summarization systems are complementing the news aggregators performing the next step down the road of coping with information overload. Multi-document summarization may also be done in response to a question.

Multi-document summarization creates information reports that are both concise and comprehensive. With different opinions being put together and outlined, every topic is described from multiple perspectives within a single document. While the goal of a brief summary is to simplify information search and cut the time by pointing to the most relevant source documents, comprehensive multi-document summary should itself contain the required information, hence limiting the need for accessing original files to cases when refinement is required. Automatic summaries present information extracted from multiple sources algorithmically, without any editorial touch or subjective human intervention, thus making it completely unbiased. 

=====Diversity=====
Multi-document extractive summarization faces a problem of redundancy. Ideally, we want to extract sentences that are both &quot;central&quot; (i.e., contain the main ideas) and &quot;diverse&quot; (i.e., they differ from one another). For example, in a set of news articles about some event, each article is likely to have many similar sentences. To address this issue, LexRank applies a heuristic post-processing step that adds sentences in rank order, but discards sentences that are too similar to ones already in the summary. This method is called Cross-Sentence Information Subsumption (CSIS). These methods work based on the idea that sentences &quot;recommend&quot; other similar sentences to the reader. Thus, if one sentence is very similar to many others, it will likely be a sentence of great importance. Its importance also stems from the importance of the sentences &quot;recommending&quot; it. Thus, to get ranked highly and placed in a summary, a sentence must be similar to many sentences that are in turn also similar to many other sentences. This makes intuitive sense and allows the algorithms to be applied to an arbitrary new text. The methods are domain-independent and easily portable. One could imagine the features indicating important sentences in the news domain might vary considerably from the biomedical domain. However, the unsupervised &quot;recommendation&quot;-based approach applies to any domain.

A related method is Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), which uses a general-purpose graph-based ranking algorithm like Page/Lex/TextRank that handles both &quot;centrality&quot; and &quot;diversity&quot; in a unified mathematical framework based on absorbing Markov chain random walks (a random walk where certain states end the walk). The algorithm is called GRASSHOPPER. In addition to explicitly promoting diversity during the ranking process, GRASSHOPPER incorporates a prior ranking (based on sentence position in the case of summarization).

The state of the art results for multi-document summarization are obtained using mixtures of submodular functions. These methods have achieved the state of the art results for Document Summarization Corpora, DUC 04 - 07. Similar results were achieved with the use of determinantal point processes (which are a special case of submodular functions) for DUC-04.

A new method for multi-lingual multi-document summarization that avoids redundancy generates ideograms to represent the meaning of each sentence in each document, then evaluates similarity by comparing ideogram shape and position. It does not use word frequency, training or preprocessing. It uses two user-supplied parameters: equivalence (when are two sentences to be considered equivalent?) and relevance (how long is the desired summary?).

===Submodular functions as generic tools for summarization===
The idea of a submodular set function has recently emerged as a powerful modeling tool for various summarization problems. Submodular functions naturally model notions of &quot;coverage&quot;, &quot;information&quot;, &quot;representation&quot; and &quot;diversity&quot;. Moreover, several important combinatorial optimization problems occur as special instances of submodular optimization. For example, the set cover problem is a special case of submodular optimization, since the set cover function is submodular. The set cover function attempts to find a subset of objects which &quot;cover&quot; a given set of concepts. For example, in document summarization, one would like the summary to cover all important and relevant concepts in the document. This is an instance of set cover. Similarly, the facility location problem is a special case of submodular functions. The Facility Location function also naturally models coverage and diversity. Another example of a submodular optimization problem is using a determinantal point process to model diversity. Similarly, the Maximum-Marginal-Relevance procedure can also be seen as an instance of submodular optimization. All these important models encouraging coverage, diversity and information are all submodular. Moreover, submodular functions can be efficiently combined, and the resulting function is still submodular. Hence, one could combine one submodular function which models diversity, another one which models coverage and use human supervision to learn a right model of a submodular function for the problem.

While submodular functions are fitting problems for summarization, they also admit very efficient algorithms for optimization. For example, a simple greedy algorithm admits a constant factor guarantee. Moreover, the greedy algorithm is extremely simple to implement and can scale to large datasets, which is very important for summarization problems.

Submodular functions have achieved state-of-the-art for almost all summarization problems. For example, work by Lin and Bilmes, 2012 shows that submodular functions achieve the best results to date on DUC-04, DUC-05, DUC-06 and DUC-07 systems for document summarization. Similarly, work by Lin and Bilmes, 2011, shows that many existing systems for automatic summarization are instances of submodular functions. This was a breakthrough result establishing submodular functions as the right models for summarization problems.

Submodular Functions have also been used for other summarization tasks. Tschiatschek et al., 2014 show that mixtures of submodular functions achieve state-of-the-art results for image collection summarization. Similarly, Bairi et al., 2015 show the utility of submodular functions for summarizing multi-document topic hierarchies. Submodular Functions have also successfully been used for summarizing machine learning datasets.

===Applications===

Specific applications of automatic summarization include:
* The Reddit bot &quot;autotldr&quot;, created in 2011 summarizes news articles in the comment-section of reddit posts. It was found to be very useful by the reddit community which upvoted its summaries hundreds of thousands of times. The name is reference to TL;DR − Internet slang for &quot;too long; didn&#x27;t read&quot;.
* Adversarial stylometry may make use of summaries, if the detail lost is not major and the summary is sufficiently stylistically different to the input.

==Evaluation==

The most common way to evaluate the informativeness of automatic summaries is to compare them with human-made model summaries.

Evaluation can be intrinsic or extrinsic, and inter-textual or intra-textual.

=== Intrinsic versus extrinsic ===
Intrinsic evaluation assesses the summaries directly, while extrinsic evaluation evaluates how the summarization system affects the completion of some other task. Intrinsic evaluations have assessed mainly the coherence and informativeness of summaries. Extrinsic evaluations, on the other hand, have tested the impact of summarization on tasks like relevance assessment, reading comprehension, etc.

=== Inter-textual versus intra-textual ===
Intra-textual evaluation assess the output of a specific summarization system, while inter-textual evaluation focuses on contrastive analysis of outputs of several summarization systems.

Human judgement often varies greatly in what it considers a &quot;good&quot; summary, so creating an automatic evaluation process is particularly difficult. Manual evaluation can be used, but this is both time and labor-intensive, as it requires humans to read not only the summaries but also the source documents. Other issues are those concerning coherence and coverage.

The most common way to evaluate summaries is ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation). It is very common for summarization and translation systems in NIST&#x27;s Document Understanding Conferences. ROUGE is a recall-based measure of how well a summary covers the content of human-generated summaries known as references. It calculates n-gram overlaps between automatically generated summaries and previously written human summaries. It is recall-based to encourage inclusion of all important topics in summaries. Recall can be computed with respect to unigram, bigram, trigram, or 4-gram matching. For example, ROUGE-1 is the fraction of unigrams that appear in both the reference summary and the automatic summary out of all unigrams in the reference summary. If there are multiple reference summaries, their scores are averaged. A high level of overlap should indicate a high degree of shared concepts between the two summaries.

ROUGE cannot determine if the result is coherent, that is if sentences flow together in a sensibly. High-order n-gram ROUGE measures help to some degree.

Another unsolved problem is Anaphor resolution. Similarly, for image summarization, Tschiatschek et al., developed a Visual-ROUGE score which judges the performance of algorithms for image summarization.

===Domain-specific versus domain-independent summarization===
Domain-independent summarization techniques apply sets of general features to identify information-rich text segments. Recent research focuses on domain-specific summarization using knowledge specific to the text&#x27;s domain, such as medical knowledge and ontologies for summarizing medical texts.

===Qualitative===
The main drawback of the evaluation systems so far is that we need a reference summary (for some methods, more than one), to compare automatic summaries with models. This is a hard and expensive task. Much effort has to be made to create corpora of texts and their corresponding summaries. Furthermore, some methods require manual annotation of the summaries (e.g. SCU in the Pyramid Method). Moreover, they all perform a quantitative evaluation with regard to different similarity metrics.

==History==
The first publication in the area dates back to 1957 (Hans Peter Luhn), starting with a statistical technique. Research increased significantly in 2015. Term frequency–inverse document frequency had been used by 2016. Pattern-based summarization was the most powerful option for multi-document summarization found by 2016. In the following year it was surpassed by latent semantic analysis (LSA) combined with non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Although they did not replace other approaches and are often combined with them, by 2019 machine learning methods dominated the extractive summarization of single documents, which was considered to be nearing maturity. By 2020, the field was still very active and research is shifting towards abstractive summation and real-time summarization.

===Recent approaches===
Recently the rise of transformer models replacing more traditional RNN (LSTM) have provided a flexibility in the mapping of text sequences to text sequences of a different type, which is well suited to automatic summarization. This includes models such as T5 and Pegasus.

<text>Nipper was a short-lived British comic book magazine, published between 31 January to 12 September 1987. Unlike most British comics by this time, which had A4 paper size, this was an A5 comic, which meant it was half the size of all the others, hence the name &#x27;Nipper&#x27;. &quot;Nipper&quot; ran for 16 Issues, had just one holiday special (in 1987) and just one annual in 1988. By the time of its last issue, however, it had become an A4 comic like the others. After that it merged with Buster.

It should not be mistaken by the &quot;Daily Mail Nipper&quot; annuals from the 1930s, 40s and 50s.

==Comics published in the magazine==
* Blaster and Bignoise
* Brad Break — An accident-prone young man who spent most of his time in hospital with at least one limb in plaster. Strips would frequently focus on Brad&#x27;s discharge from hospital, only for him to suffer another accident before even leaving the building. Merged into Buster.
* Double Trouble — Twins Jon and Suzy, who would constantly bicker and attempt to outdo each other. Most strips saw one sibling having the upper hand until the end of the story, when the tables would be turned, although sometimes the two were forced to work together. Merged into Buster.
* Felix The Pussycat — A superhero-obsessed boy dresses up as a cat to fight crime ineptly, parodying Billy the Cat from &quot;The Beano&quot;. Illustrated by Tom Paterson.
* First-Time Fred
* Frankie&#x27;s Flashlight
* Flapper
* James Pond
* Kelpie&#x27;s Kingdom
* Magic Trainers
* Mighty Mouth — A young man with the ability to &#x27;throw&#x27; his voice, ventriliquist-style. He would usually use this ability to cause mischief (for example, making it appear as if a teacher had insulted the headmaster) but occasionally threw his voice to help others. Mighty Mouth had inherited his talent from his father, who would sometimes use it to turn the tables on his son. Merged into Buster.
* My &#x27;Dad&#x27; Mum — A single mum who tries to prove to her son, Sam, that she can give him anything a dad could and can do anything a man can do. Merged into Buster.
*Nipper — A very small boy frequently mocked for his size. Strips usually focused on his (failed) attempts to appear taller, or situations where his stature unexpectedly proved to his advantage. Merged into Buster.
* Nursery Crimes
* Ricky Rainbow — A boy with the ability to change colour at will; something he would often use to escape from or foil the schemes of local bully, Bruiser. Although he could usually control his colour changing, occasionally his mood would dictate it (for example literally turning green with envy, or blue when depressed). Ricky could also turn multi-coloured, such as turning tartan, but the difficulty of this would temporarily drain his colour-changing powers. Merged into Buster.
* Roy&#x27;s Toys — A boy whose toys secretly came to life when he left the room. A recurring theme was Roy deciding to throw away one of his toys, with the other toys having to plot to save their friend (without Roy realising they could come to life). Merged into Buster.
* School Funds — A school constantly under threat of closure due to lack of money. Its pupils would frequently come up with schemes to raise funds to keep the school open, with varying success. Sometimes fate would intervene and save the day, whilst on other occasions schemes would go wrong and leave the school worse off than before. Merged into Buster.
* Strong Arm

<text>Great Malvern is an area of the civil parish of Malvern, in the Malvern Hills district, in the county of Worcestershire, England. It lies at the foot of the Malvern Hills, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, on the eastern flanks of the Worcestershire Beacon and North Hill, and is the historic centre of Malvern and includes its town centre.

It is a designated conservation area in recognition of the special architectural and historic interest of the area. The growth of Great Malvern began with the founding of an 11th-century priory. During the 19th century, it became a popular centre for hydrotherapy and swelled to include the bordering settlements of Barnards Green, Malvern Link with Link Top, Malvern Wells (South Malvern), North Malvern, and West Malvern. This urban area, along with the hills they surround and several villages, are collectively referred to as &quot;The Malverns&quot;.

Great Malvern is a seat of local government, being the location of the headquarters of Malvern Town Council, the Malvern Hills Conservators and Malvern Hills AONB Partnership, and Malvern Hills District Council. It has many of the town&#x27;s amenities including the Malvern Theatres complex, the Priory Park, the Splash leisure and swimming complex, the main library, the police station, the tourist information centre, and the main post office.

==Location==
Great Malvern is approximately south-west of the city of Worcester, on the eastern slopes of the Malvern Hills. The elevation of the town ranges from about 50 to 200 metres (164 to 656 feet) above sea level. The River Severn runs roughly north-south about to the east of the town.

Belle Vue Island (a public terraced garden on an &quot;island&quot; between roads) is the finishing point for the Worcestershire Way, a waymarked long-distance trail that runs from Bewdley to Great Malvern.

==Town centre==
The town centre comprises two main streets at right angles to each other: the steep Church Street and Bellevue Terrace, a relatively flat north–south extension of the A449 which forms Malvern&#x27;s western extremity along the flank of the hills. In the heart of the town is a statue of the composer Edward Elgar, while other statuary is dedicated to Malvern water.

Among the many shops are two large modern supermarkets, both in Edith Walk, formerly a steep and unmade lane that served the rear entrances of the shops in Church Street. As well as traditional high street shops such as butchers, bakers, grocers etc., there are also cafés, bookshops, health food shops, art and craft shops, galleries, antique dealers, delis, restaurants, complementary therapists, charity shops, law firms, and estate agents. There is also a public library that includes access to many community services. On the Worcester to Hereford railway line is the Victorian Great Malvern station, a listed example of classical Victorian railway architecture close to the nearby former Imperial Hotel by the same architect, E. W. Elmslie.

There are many specimens of mature trees in Great Malvern. When Lady Foley, the widow of Edward Thomas Foley, sold off parts of her estate in the 1800s, she stipulated that all plots around the town centre should be planted with trees.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name &quot;Malvern&quot; is first attested in a charter of around 1030, as &quot;Mælfern&quot;, and then in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Malferna&quot;. The name derives from the Common Brittonic words that survive in modern Welsh as (&quot;bare&quot;) and (&quot;hill&quot;); thus it once meant &quot;bare hill&quot;. The name perhaps applied originally to the hill now called Worcester Beacon, after which Great Malvern was then named. Additions corresponding to the &quot;Great&quot; part of &quot;Great Malvern&quot;, made to distinguish the settlement from Little Malvern, are first attested in 1228 (&quot;Magna Malverna&quot;, using the Latin word for &quot;great&quot;) and 1521 (&quot;Moche Malv&#x27;ne&quot;, using the English word &quot;much&quot;). Great Malvern in turn then gave its name to the whole range of hills beside which it lies, the Malvern Hills.

Before the beginning of academic place-name studies, the name attracted some fanciful explanations. William of Malmesbury&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Pontificum&quot; suggests that the name comes from the Latin words (&quot;badly&quot;) and (&quot;flourishes&quot;), implying that it meant &quot;thrives poorly&quot; and that this was used ironically because spiritual life in Malvern was so successful. Jabez Allies, a nineteenth-century antiquarian from Worcestershire, speculated that &quot;-vern&quot; derived from supposed Brittonic words &quot;sarn&quot; or &quot;varn&quot; meaning &quot;pavement&quot; or &quot;seat of judgement&quot;.

===Monastic Malvern===
The town developed around its 11th-century priory, a Benedictine monastery, the remains of which make up some of the early parts of Great Malvern Priory, now a large parish church. Several slightly different histories explain the actual founding of the religious community. Legend tells that the settlement began following the murder of St. Werstan, a monk of Deerhurst, who escaped and fled through the Malvern Chase, finding sanctuary on the Malvern Hills and establishing a hermitage near St. Ann&#x27;s Well. St Werstan&#x27;s oratory is thought to have been located on the site of St Michael&#x27;s Chapel, which is believed to have stood on the site of Bello Sguardo, a Victorian Villa. Bello Sguardo was built on the site of Hermitage Cottage. The cottage was demolished in 1825 and ecclesiastical carvings were found within it. A Mediaeval undercroft, human bones and parts of a coffin were also uncovered. Although the legend may be monastic mythology, historians have however concluded that St. Werstan was the original martyr.
The first prior was Aldwyn, who founded the monastery on his bishop&#x27;s advice, and by 1135 the monastery included thirty monks. Aldwyn was succeeded by Walcher of Malvern, an astronomer and philosopher from Lorraine, whose gravestone inside the priory church records details that the priory arose in 1085 from a hermitage endowed by Edward the Confessor. An ancient stained glass window in the Priory church depicts the legend of St. Werstan, with details of his vision, the consecration of his chapel, Edward the Confessor granting the charter for the site, and Werstan&#x27;s martyrdom.

An 18th-century document states that in the 18th year of William&#x27;s kingship (probably 1083), a priory was dedicated to St Mary the Virgin. &quot;Victoria County History&quot; describes how a hermit Aldwyn, who lived in the reign of Edward the Confessor, had petitioned the Earl of Gloucester for the original site (of the Priory) in the wood, and cites his source as &quot;Gervase of Canterbury, &quot;Mappa Mundi&quot; (Rolls ser.)&quot;.

Large estates in Malvern were part of crown lands given to Gilbert &quot;the Red&quot;, the seventh Earl of Gloucester and sixth Earl of Hertford, on his marriage to Joan of Acre the daughter of Edward I, in 1290. Disputed hunting rights on these led to several armed conflicts with Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford, that Edward resolved. Nott states that Gilbert made gifts to the Priory, and describes his &quot;great conflict&quot; with Thomas de Cantilupe, Bishop of Hereford,
also about hunting rights and a ditch that Gilbert dug, that was settled by costly litigation. Gilbert had a similar conflict with Godfrey Giffard, Bishop and Administrator of Worcester Cathedral (and formerly Chancellor of England. Godfrey, who had granted land to the Priory, had jurisdictional disputes about Malvern Priory, resolved by Robert Burnell, the current Chancellor.
A discussion in 2005 about the stained glass windows of Great Malvern Priory in terms of the relationship between Church and Laity stresses the importance of Malvern in the development of stained glass. It refers to &quot;the vast and strategically important estates of which Malvern was a part&quot; in the 15th and 16th centuries, to a widespread awareness of Great Malvern Priory, to the likelihood of a pilgrimage route through the town. The discussion also mentions Thomas Walsingham&#x27;s view that Malvern was a hiding place of the Lollard knight Sir John Oldcastle in 1414. Chambers wrote, in relation to the stained glass, &quot;the situation of Malvern was so much admired by Henry VII, his Queen (Elizabeth of York) and their two Sons, Prince Arthur, and Prince Henry&quot; that they made substantial endowments.

===Post dissolution===

During the Dissolution of the Monasteries the local commissioners were instructed to ensure that, where abbey churches were also used for parish worship, they should continue or could be purchased by parishioners. Accordingly, Malvern Priory survived by being acquired by a William Pinnocke and with it, much of its 15th-century stained glass windows. The monastic buildings were taken apart and anything usable was sold off. With the exception of the church building (of which the south transept adjoining the monastery&#x27;s cloisters was destroyed), all that remains of Malvern&#x27;s monastery is the Abbey Gateway (also known as the Priory Gatehouse) that houses today&#x27;s Malvern Museum.

===Development as a spa (17th–19th centuries)===
The health-giving properties of Malvern water and the natural beauty of the surroundings led to the development of Malvern as a spa, with resources for invalids and for tourists, seeking cures, rest and entertainment. Local legend has it that the curative benefit of the spring water was known in mediaeval times. The medicinal value and the bottling of Malvern water are mentioned &quot;in a poem attributed to the Reverend Edmund Rea, who became Vicar of Great Malvern in 1612&quot;. Richard Banister, the pioneering oculist, wrote about the &quot;Eye Well&quot;, close to the &quot;Holy Well&quot;, in a short poem in his &quot;Breviary of the Eyes&quot; (see Malvern water), in 1622. In 1756, Dr. John Wall published a 14-page pamphlet on the benefits of Malvern water, that reached a 158-page 3rd edition in 1763. Further praise came from the botanist Benjamin Stillingfleet in 1757, the poet Thomas Warton in 1790, and William Addison, the physician of the Duchess of Kent (mother of Queen Victoria) in 1828, all quoted in a review
 by the medical historian W.H. McMenemy.
 In his lecture about Malvern at the Royal Institution, Addison spoke of &quot;its pure and invigorating air, the excellence of its water, and the romantic beauty of its scenery&quot;. Similar views appeared in the press, Nicholas Vansittart brought his wife Catherine to Malvern for a rest cure in 1809. Chambers, in his book about Malvern, praised Elizabeth, Countess Harcourt (daughter-in-law of the 1st Earl Harcourt), whose patronage contributed to the development of hillside walks.

Bottling and shipping of the Malvern water grew in volume. In 1842, Dr. James Wilson and Dr. James Manby Gully, leading exponents of hydrotherapy, set up clinics in Malvern (Holyrood House for women and Tudor House for men). Malvern expanded rapidly as a residential spa. Several large hotels and many of the large villas in Malvern date from its heyday. Many smaller hotels and guest houses were built between about 1842 and 1875. By 1855 there were already 95 hotels and boarding houses and by 1865 over a quarter of the town&#x27;s 800 houses were boarding and lodging houses. Most were in Great Malvern, the town centre, while others were in the surrounding settlements of Malvern Wells, Malvern Link, North Malvern and West Malvern.
Queen Adelaide visited St. Ann&#x27;s Well in September 1842. &quot;Throughout the 1840s and 1850s Malvern attracted a stream of celebrated visitors, including royalty.&quot; Patients included Charles Darwin, Catherine, wife of Charles Dickens,
 Thomas Carlyle, Florence Nightingale, Lord Lytton, who was an outspoken protagonist, Lord Tennyson and Samuel Wilberforce. The hydrotherapists came under heavy criticism from Sir Charles Hastings (a founder of the British Medical Association) and other physicians.

The extension of the railway from Worcester to Malvern Link was completed on 25 May 1859. The following year, &quot;Besides middle class visitors ... the railway also brought working class excursionists from the Black Country with dramatic effect ... At Whitsuntide ... 10,000 came from the Black Country to the newly opened stations at Great Malvern and Malvern Wells. Throughout June to September, day trips were frequent, causing the &quot;town to be crowded with &#x27;the most curious specimens of the British shopkeeper and artisan on an outing&#x27; &quot;.
Following Malvern&#x27;s new-found fame as a spa and area of natural beauty, and fully exploiting its new rail connections, factories from as far as Manchester were organising day trips for their employees, often attracting as many as 5,000 visitors a day. In 1865, a public meeting of residents denounced the rising rail fares – by then twice that of other lines – that were exploiting the tourism industry, and demanded a limitation to the number of excursion trains. The arrival of the railway also enabled the delivery of coal in large quantities, which accelerated the area&#x27;s popularity as a winter resort.

The 1887 Baedeker&#x27;s includes Malvern in a London–Worcester–Hereford itinerary and described as &quot;an inland health resort, famous for its bracing air and pleasant situation&quot; and &quot;a great educational centre&quot;, with five hotels that are &quot;well spoken of&quot;, a commercial hotel, the Assembly Rooms and Gardens, and many excursions on foot, pony and by carriage. Other descriptions of the diversions mention bands, quadrilles, cricket (residents &quot;vs&quot; visitors) and billiard rooms. The Duchess of Teck stayed, with her daughter Mary (later queen consort of George V), in Malvern in the Autumn of 1891, joined by Lady Eva Greville.
 and the Duke of Teck. The Duchess was &quot;perfectly enchanted with Malvern and its surroundings&quot; and, with the Duke, visited Malvern College. The Duchess returned to open the new waterworks at Camp Hill in 1895. In 1897, the painter Edward Burne-Jones came to Malvern for the &quot;bracing air&quot;, on the recommendation of his doctor, but stayed in his hotel for a week. The 7-year-old Franklin D. Roosevelt visited in 1889, during a trip to Europe with his parents.

Fearing that Malvern would become the &quot;Metropolis of Hydrotherapy&quot;, a Malvern Hills Act had been secured in parliament in 1884 and later Acts empowered the Malvern Hills Conservators to acquire land to prevent further encroachment on common land and by 1925 they had bought much of the manorial wastelands.

Towards the end of the 19th century, the popularity of the hydrotherapy had declined to the extent that many hotels were already being converted into private boarding schools and rest homes, and education became the basis of Malvern&#x27;s economy. By 1865, the town already had 17 single-gender private schools, increasing to 25 by 1885. The area was well suited for schools due to its established attractive environment and access by rail. Children could travel unaccompanied with their trunks by rail to their boarding schools near the stations in Great Malvern, Malvern Wells, and Malvern Link. The Girls College, in a former hotel directly opposite Great Malvern railway station, has a dedicated (now derelict) tunnel to the basement of the building, which is clearly visible from both platforms of the station.

==Governance==
In 1900 the former urban districts and towns of Great Malvern and Malvern Link were merged and the area forms the current six (parish) wards that constitute the civil parish of Malvern, which has a town council (based in Great Malvern). In 1951 the parish of Great Malvern had a population of 9954. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished. As Great Malvern is no longer an area with an administratively-defined boundary, it straddles the wards of Priory and (to small extents) Pickersleigh and Chase.

The other tiers of local government that cover Great Malvern are Malvern Hills District Council (also based in Great Malvern) and Worcestershire County Council (based in Worcester).

==Culture and leisure==
The Priory Park with its adjoining Malvern Splash pool and Winter Gardens occupies a large area in the centre of the town. The Winter Gardens complex is home to the Malvern Theatre, a leading provincial centre for dramatic arts, a cinema (film theatre), a concert venue/banqueting room, bars and cafeterias.

For almost half a century, the Malvern Winter Gardens has also been a major regional venue for classical music, and concerts by legendary rock bands of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. 

The Splash Leisure Complex flanks the eastern boundary of Priory Park and has an indoor swimming pool and gymnasium.

Located between the former community hospital and the Malvern Hills College are the grounds and buildings of the Manor Park Club Multi Sports Complex that provides the Malvern area with extensive indoor and outdoor sports facilities. It is assisted by grants and loans from various bodies, including the Malvern Hills District Council, the Sport of England (Lottery) and the Lawn Tennis Association.

===Drama===
Malvern Theatres, housed in the Winter Gardens complex in the town centre, is a provincial centre for the arts. The first Malvern Drama Festival, which took place in 1929, was dedicated to Bernard Shaw and planned by Sir Barry Jackson. A number of works have had their first performances at Malvern, six by Shaw including In &quot;Good King Charles&#x27; Golden Days&quot;, the 1929 English première of &quot;The Apple Cart&quot;, and the world première of &quot;Geneva&quot; in 1938. In 1956 Malvern held a Shaw centenary week. In February 1965 a Malvern Festival Theatre Trust was set up, and extensive refurbishment was undertaken. J B Priestley presided over the opening ceremony of the first summer season. In 1998, a further £7.2 million major redesign and refurbishment took place with the help of contributions from the National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF), administered by the government Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

The Theatre of Small Convenience entered the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; in 2002 as the smallest theatre in the world. Located in a former Victorian public convenience in the centre of the town in Edith Walk in, the theatre has a capacity of 12 people. The theatre regularly hosts puppetry, professional and amateur actors, drama, poetry, storytelling and opera, and has become a regular venue of the Malvern Fringe Festival.
The theatre has hosted a range of famous actors over the years including Simon Callow, Nicholas Hoult and Jane Asher.

===Literature===

William Langland&#x27;s famous 14th century poem &quot;The Visions of Piers Plowman&quot; (1362) was inspired by the Malvern Hills and the earliest poetic allusion to them occurs in the poem &quot;And on a Maye mornynge on Malverne hylles&quot;. Langland, was possibly educated at the priory of Great Malvern.

C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien are among the authors that have frequented Malvern. Legend states that, after drinking in a Malvern pub one winter evening, they were walking home when it started to snow. They saw a lamp post shining out through the snow and Lewis turned to his friends and said &quot;that would make a very nice opening line to a book&quot;. The novel &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; by Lewis later used that image as the characters enter the realm of Narnia.
J.R.R. Tolkien found inspiration in the Malvern landscape which he had viewed from his childhood home in Birmingham and his brother Hilary&#x27;s home near Evesham. He was introduced to the area by C. S. Lewis, who had brought him here to meet George Sayer, the Head of English at Malvern College. Sayer had been a student of Lewis, and became his biographer, and together with them Tolkien would walk the Malvern Hills. Recordings of Tolkien reading excerpts from &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; were made in Malvern in 1952, at the home of George Sayer. The recordings were later issued on long-playing gramophone records. In the liner notes for &quot;J.R.R Tolkien Reads and Sings his The Hobbit &amp; The Fellowship of the Rings&quot;, George Sayer wrote that Tolkien would relive the book as they walked and compared parts of the Malvern Hills to the White Mountains of Gondor.

Great Malvern is the setting for several episodes in Jonathan Coe&#x27;s 2004 novel &quot;The Closed Circle&quot;.

===Architecture===

In 1969 Great Malvern was designated a Conservation Area by the Local Authority in recognition of the architecture which includes Stuccoed, Classical, Victorian, Regency, Edwardian, Gothic Revival and Italianate styled buildings. Many of the houses were built during the Industrial Revolution, and Malvern&#x27;s boom years as a spa town, by wealthy families from the nearby Birmingham area. Following the collapse of the spa industry, many of the hotels and villas became schools, and some have since been further converted to apartments, while some of the smaller hotels are now retirement homes. The Imperial Hotel in red brick with stone dressings, which later became a school, is one of the largest buildings in Malvern. It was built in 1860 by the architect E. W. Elmslie who also designed the Great Malvern railway station, and the Council House on the plot where Dr. Gully&#x27;s original house stood. The Grove in Avenue Road in 1867, originally to be his private residence in 1927 became part of the Lawnside School for girls, and in 1860 Whitbourne Hall, a Grade II* listed building, in Herefordshire.
 The Imperial was the first hotel to be lit by incandescent gas. It was equipped with all types of baths and brine was brought specially by rail from Droitwich.

Much architecture and statuary in the town centre is dedicated to Malvern water, including the St Ann&#x27;s Well, which is housed in a building dating from 1813. The drinking spout, &quot;Malvhina&quot;, by the sculptor Rose Garrard, was unveiled on 4 September 1998. The Enigma Fountain, also by Garrard, was unveiled by The Duke of York in 2000.

===Music===
Sir Edward Elgar, British composer and Master of the King&#x27;s Musick, lived much of his life around Malvern and is buried in Little Malvern Roman Catholic churchyard. A sculpture group by artist Rose Garrard comprising the &quot;Enigma&quot; fountain together with a statue of Elgar gazing over Great Malvern stands on Belle Vue Terrace in the town centre. The &quot;Elgar Route&quot;, a drive passing some key landmarks from Elgar&#x27;s life, passes through Malvern.

Malvern Concert Club, founded in 1903 by Elgar, holds concerts are held in the Forum Theatre, Malvern Theatres. Its programmes focus on in renaissance, baroque, classical, romantic and contemporary music.

In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the Malvern Winter Gardens was a major regional venue for concerts by popular rock bands, including T-Rex, The Jam, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, The Undertones, and Joy Division. Many of the events were promoted by Cherry Red, a London-based independent record label formed in 1978.

The Chandos Symphony Orchestra, under the professional direction of Michael Lloyd, has over 100 players. It specialises in performances of major works of the 19th and 20th Centuries. The &quot;Autumn in Malvern Festival&quot; is an annual event featuring performances of artists of music, poetry, writers and film makers held during October every year. The Colwell and other brass bands of the early century were part of the music of the town. The opera singer Jenny Lind lived and died in Malvern, and is buried in Great Malvern cemetery. Julius Harrison (1885–1963), who was a contemporary of Elgar and Professor of Composition at the Royal Academy of Music, lived in Pickersleigh Road for most of the 1940s. He was music director at Malvern College and director of the early Elgar Festivals in Malvern.

Malvern Fringe Festival was officially founded in 1977 as a reaction to the Malvern Festival which was perceived to be biased towards classical music and appealing towards a national and international audience rather than a local one. It takes place over three days in June as a fringe to the Elgar Festival. The Fringe also organise the Malvern May Day and Parade, an annual community event which has been held in Priory Park on the Saturday before the May Bank Holiday since 1993 and various musical and other live events throughout the year. The Fringe aims to be inclusive; bridging the generation gap by providing a varied programme of events for the local people of Malvern aimed at all ages.

===Art===

Works of art in Great Malvern include fountains, statues, and Malvern water spouts by the sculptor Rose Garrard. Among her sculptures are the statue of Sir Edward Elgar and the &quot;Enigma Fountain&quot; (Unveiled by Prince Andrew, Duke of York on Belle Vue Terrace, Malvern on 26 May 2000). and the drinking spout, &quot;Malvhina&quot;, also on Belle Vue Terrace, which was unveiled on 4 September 1998.

A sculpture of two buzzards by Walenty Pytel was installed in Rosebank Gardens, Great Malvern to commemorate the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in November 2012.

Paintings of Great Malvern include Joseph Powell&#x27;s &quot;Great Malvern Priory ... from the North East&quot; (1797), now in the British Watercolours collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum and J. M. W. Turner&#x27;s &quot;Porch of Great Malvern Abbey&quot;.

===Television===
&quot;Elgar&quot;, a drama documentary made in 1962 by the British director Ken Russell, was filmed on location in Malvern and Worcester. Several scenes were filmed in Malvern at locations including the Bluebird Tea Rooms in Church Street and St Ann&#x27;s Well in Great Malvern. Made for BBC Television&#x27;s long-running &quot;Monitor&quot; programme, it dramatised the life of the composer Edward Elgar. The film significantly raised the public profile of the composer.

Great Malvern railway station featured in 1975 as the commuter-belt railway station in the first episode of Survivors (1975 TV series), the post-apocalyptic fiction drama television series created by Terry Nation and produced by Terence Dudley at the BBC.

==Education==
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries following the decline in Malvern&#x27;s popularity as a spa town, many private boarding schools were established in Great Malvern, often occupying the premises of former hotels and large villas. Two large independent &#x27;public&#x27; schools – Malvern College for boys and girls and Malvern St James for girls – now remain following mergers of Malvern&#x27;s many private primary and secondary schools.
Malvern College is a coeducational public school, founded in 1865. Until 1992, it was a school for boys aged 13 to 18. Following a series of mergers from 1992 to 2008 with private primary schools in the area it has become coeducational with pupils from 3 to 18 years old. Among its alumni are two Nobel Laureates (James Meade and Francis William Aston), an Olympic Gold medallist (Arnold Jackson), and leading politicians.

Malvern St James was formed in 2006 by the merger of Malvern Girls&#x27; College and St. James&#x27; School, West Malvern (formerly St James&#x27; and The Abbey) and other mergers with local private schools over the last thirty years. It is now the last of the independent girls&#x27; schools in the Malvern area. The main building of Malvern St James on the campus of the former Malvern Girls&#x27; College is the former Imperial Hotel, built in the second half of the 19th century.

There are several state-controlled or voluntary-assisted primary schools in the Great Malvern area. Secondary schools serving the area are located in the suburbs of Barnards Green, Malvern Link, and the nearby village of Hanley Castle, and further afield in the city of Worcester.

==Transport==

===Rail===
Great Malvern railway station is located just off Avenue Road, downhill from the priory church and town centre, and provides direct services to Worcester, Hereford, Bristol, Westbury, Weymouth, Birmingham, Oxford and London.

===Bus===
Several local bus services connect Great Malvern with the surrounding area.
===Air===
The nearest major airport is Birmingham approximately one hour by road via the M5 and M42 motorways. Gloucestershire Airport located at Staverton, in the borough of Tewkesbury is a busy general aviation airport used mainly for private charter and scheduled flights to destinations such as the islands of Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man, pilot training, and by the aircraft of emergency services.

<text>Frank Sherwood &quot;Sherry&quot; Rowland (June 28, 1927 – March 10, 2012) was an American Nobel laureate and a professor of chemistry at the University of California, Irvine. His research was on atmospheric chemistry and chemical kinetics. His best-known work was the discovery that chlorofluorocarbons contribute to ozone depletion.

==Education and early life==
Born in Delaware, Ohio, Rowland received a majority of his education in public schools and, due to accelerated promotion was able to graduate high school several weeks before his 16th birthday. In the summers during his high school career, Frank was entrusted to run the local weather service station. This was Rowland&#x27;s first exposure to systematic experimentation and data collection. After entering Ohio Wesleyan University, Rowland was about to graduate shortly before his 18th birthday. Instead, he was enlisted to the Navy to train radar operators. Rowland was discharged after 14 months as a non commissioned officer. After entering the University of Chicago, Rowland was assigned Willard F. Libby as a mentor and began to study radiochemistry. Rowland&#x27;s thesis was about the chemical state of cyclotron-produced radioactive bromine atoms. Rowland received his B.A. from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1948. He then earned his M.S. in 1951 and his Ph.D. in 1952, both from the University of Chicago.

==Career and research==
Rowland held academic posts at Princeton University (1952–1956) and at the University of Kansas (1956–1964) before becoming a professor of chemistry at the University of California, Irvine, in 1964. At Irvine in the early 1970s he began working with Mario J. Molina. Rowland was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1978 and served as a president of American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in 1993. His best-known work was the discovery that chlorofluorocarbons contribute to ozone depletion. Rowland theorized that man made organic compound gases will decompose as a result of solar radiation in the stratosphere, releasing atoms of chlorine which react with oxygen (ozone) to form chlorine monoxide, and that they are individually able to destroy large numbers of ozone molecules. It was obvious that Rowland had a good idea of what was occurring at higher altitudes when he stated &quot;...I knew that such a molecule could not remain inert in the atmosphere forever, if only because solar photochemistry at high altitudes would break it down&quot;. Rowland&#x27;s research, first published in &quot;Nature&quot; magazine in 1974, initiated a scientific investigation of the problem. In 1978, a first ban on CFC-based aerosols in spray cans was issued in the United States. The actual production did however not stop and was soon on the old levels. It took till the 1980s to allow for a global regulation policy.

Rowland performed many measurements of the atmosphere. One experiment included collecting air samples at various cities and locations around the globe to determine CCl3F North-South mixing. By measuring the concentrations at different latitudes, Rowland was able to see that CCl3F was mixing between hemispheres quite rapidly. The same measurement was repeated 8 years later, and the results showed a steady increase in CCl3F concentrations. Rowland&#x27;s work also showed how the density of the ozone layer varied by season increasing in November and decreasing until April where it levels out for the summer only to increase in November. Data gained throughout successive years showed that although the pattern was consistent, the overall ozone levels were dropping. Rowland and his colleagues interacted both with the public and the political side and suggested various solutions, which allowed to step wise reduce the CFC impact. CFC emissions were regulated first within Canada, the United States, Sweden and Norway. In the 1980s, the Vienna Agreement and the Montreal Protocol allowed for global regulation.

==Awards and honors==
Rowland won numerous awards for his work:
*Tolman Medal, 1976
*Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
*Leo Szilard Lectureship Award, 1979
*Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement, 1983

*In 1998, the UC Irvine physical sciences building was named after Rowland. A bust of Rowland is visible in the lobby.
* Elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2004
* Mount Rowland in Antarctica was named after him in 2007
*STEM Wing At Rutherford B. Hayes High School in Delaware, Ohio named in his honor

==Personal life==
Frank Rowland was the father of art historian Ingrid Rowland and Jeff Rowland. He had two granddaughters. After suffering from a short bout of ill health, Rowland died on March 10, 2012, of complications from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Upon hearing the news, renowned chemist and good friend Mario J. Molina stated: &quot;Sherry was a prime influence throughout my career and had inspired me and many others to walk in the shadow of his greatness&quot;.

<doc id="637219" wikidata="Q251255" url="?curid=637219" title="Maine penny">
<text>The Maine penny, also referred to as the Goddard coin, is a Norwegian silver coin dating to the reign of Olaf Kyrre King of Norway (1067–1093 AD). It was claimed to be discovered in Maine in 1957, and it has been suggested as evidence of pre-Columbian transoceanic contact.

==Discovery==
Guy Mellgren, a local resident and amateur archaeologist, said he found this coin on August 18, 1957, at the Goddard Site. This was an extensive archeological site at an old Native American settlement at Naskeag Point on Penobscot Bay in Brooklin, Maine. A 1978 article in &quot;Time&quot; called the discovery site an ancient Indian rubbish heap near the coastal town of Blue Hill. Over a lengthy period, a collection of 30,000 items from the site was donated to the Maine State Museum. The coin was donated in 1974.

==The coin==

Much of the circumstances of the finding of the coin were not well preserved in the record (as was the case with the majority of the 30,000 finds). The coin was at first misidentified as a British penny from the 12th century. In 1978, experts from London considered that it might have been of Norse origin. Today the identity of the Maine Penny as an Olaf Kyrre silver coin is not in doubt. Kolbjørn Skaare of the University of Oslo determined the coin had been minted between 1065 and 1080 AD and widely circulated in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The penny was found with a perforation, probably for use as a pendant. This area of the coin has since crumbled to dust from corrosion.

==Norse origin==
The Goddard site has been dated to 1180–1235, within the circulation period of pennies of this type. The people who lived at the site at that time are generally considered to be ancestors of the Penobscot. While the date is around two hundred years after the last of the Vinland voyages ( 1000) described in Norse sagas, it is well within the period during which the Norse lived in Greenland (10th to 15th centuries) and could have visited North America.

The penny&#x27;s coastal origin has been offered as evidence either that the Norsemen from Greenland traveled farther south than Newfoundland or that the coin might have been traded locally. However, the penny was the only Norse artifact found at the site, which according to substantial evidence was a hub in a large native trade network. For example, a single artifact generally identified as a Dorset culture burin was also recovered there, and may support the idea that both the burin and the penny could plausibly have come to Maine through native trade-channels from Norse sources in Labrador or Newfoundland.

The Maine State Museum website favors the view that the coin was found at the site and is therefore evidence of Norse presence on the North American continent, although the Museum states &quot;the most likely explanation for the coin&#x27;s presence is that it was obtained by natives somewhere else, perhaps in Newfoundland where the only known New World Norse settlement has been found at L’Anse aux Meadows, and that it eventually reached the Goddard site through native trade channels&quot;. The Maine State Museum describes it as &quot;the only pre-Columbian Norse artifact generally regarded as genuine found within the United States&quot;.

However, the possibility that it may be a hoax has been raised. Notably this Norwegian silver coin and other similar coins of that era were available on the open market during 1957. Thus, Mellgren could have had the means and the opportunity to plant the coin at the site, or he could have been deceived by someone planting the coin – though it is unclear what the motive would have been. There are enough questions regarding the provenance of the coin to leave its archaeological significance unclear. An assessment of the validity of the find by anthropologist Edmund Snow Carpenter concluded: &quot;Not proven&quot;.

Robert Hoge, writing for the American Numismatic Society in 2006, stated that &quot;There is no reliable confirmation on the documentation of the Goddard coin, and much circumstantial evidence suggests that someone was deliberately trying to manipulate or obfuscate the situation. The Norse coin from Maine should probably be considered a hoax.&quot;

A November 2017 paper by Norwegian numismatist Svein Gullbeck suggests that the coin is a genuine find.

<text>The Shreveport Steamer were a professional American football team in the World Football League. The franchise began the 1974 season in Houston, Texas, as the Houston Texans (no connection to the current NFL team of the same name), playing their home games at the Houston Astrodome. Toward the end of the season, the team relocated to Shreveport, Louisiana, and became the Shreveport Steamer. They played at the 30,000-seat State Fair Stadium, now named Independence Stadium. Larry King, of future CNN fame, was one of their broadcasters.

The Steamer showcased a number of veterans and a few rookies. Among them were ambidextrous quarterback and former University of Houston star D. C. Nobles and several American Football League veterans: quarterbacks Mike Taliaferro and Don Trull, fullback Jim Nance, wide receivers Don Maynard and Rick Eber, tight end Willie Frazier, former Houston Oiler and All-AFL tackle Glen Ray Hines, linebacker Garland Boyette, defensive end Al Dotson, defensive backs Daryl Johnson, Richmond Flowers, Jr., John Mallory, and Art McMahon, and rookie linebacker John Villapiano, brother of Oakland Raiders defender Phil Villapiano.

==History==

===1974 season===
The Texans played in Houston for 11 games, going 3-7-1. The team relocated to Shreveport on September 18, 1974. On September 23, 1974, they were rechristened the Shreveport Steamer. The franchise, according to the WFL, was operated on a &quot;play now, pay later&quot; basis. The team was coached by Marshall Taylor, a former star player at Tennessee Tech. The Steamer made their home debut on September 25 against the Memphis Southmen. They played in front of just over 21,000 fans, and lost 17-3. They had a 4-5 record after the move, finishing 7-12-1 overall in 1974.

In 1974, under federal court order, Sheriff James M. Goslin seized equipment of the Charlotte Hornets, who were in Shreveport playing at Independence Stadium for the WFL against the Shreveport Steamer. Goslin was complying with a suit seeking more than $26,000 in accumulated debts that had been filed against the Hornets by plaintiffs in New York, where the team had been domiciled during the first half of 1974. However, Goslin allowed the Hornets to play the Steamer before the impounding of the equipment.

===1975 season===
The Steamer returned for the 1975 WFL season with a different coaching staff. Right from the start, both the &quot;Boats&quot; and the resurrected league struggled. (The second Chicago franchise, the Chicago Winds, unrelated except by venue to the previous year&#x27;s Chicago team, the Chicago Fire, ceased operations on September 2, after five games.) After a mediocre 5-7 record and with the franchise almost out of money, the Steamer and the WFL sank permanently on October 22, 1975. The second WFL ceased operations little more than halfway through the planned 1975 season.

An unrelated &quot;Shreveport Steamer&quot;, also known as the plural &quot;Steamers&quot;, played in the American Football Association from 1979 to 1981. (All copyrights and trademarks for the WFL&#x27;s teams were allowed to lapse after the league&#x27;s shutdown.) This team renamed itself the &quot;Steamers-Americans&quot; after merging with the Orlando Americans in 1982. Billy Kilmer served as the team&#x27;s coach in its first season.

<doc id="637224" wikidata="Q1378427" url="?curid=637224" title="Administrative divisions of the Republic of Tatarstan">
<text>This is a list of units of administrative division of the [[Republic of Tatarstan]], a federal subject of Russia.

Tatarstan is located in the center of the East European Plain, between the Volga and the Kama Rivers, stretching east towards the Ural Mountains. It was originally established as the Tatar ASSR within the Russian SFSR on May 27, 1920 from Kazansky, Chistopolsky, Mamadyshsky, Sviyazhsky, Tetyushinsky, Laishevsky, and Spassky Uyezds of the former Kazan Governorate, Yelabuzhsky Uyezd of Ufa Governorate, as well as the part of Simbirsk, Samara, and Vyatka Governorates. In 1922, Yelabuga with environs was transferred to the Tatar ASSR from Vyatka Governorate.

Initially, the territory of the ASSR was divided into ten &quot;kanton&quot;s - Sviyazhsk, Tetyushi, Buinsk, Spassk, Chistopol, Menzelinsk, Bugulma, Arsk, Laishevo, and Mamadysh. On the territories transferred to the Tatar ASSR in 1922, Yelabuga and Agryz kantons were established, while Chelny Kanton was separated from Menzelinsk Kanton. All kantons had roughly the same borders and the territory as the uyezds which preceded them, and preserved the division into volosts.

In the 1930s, &quot;kantons&quot; were finally abolished and replaced with forty-five districts (raions). In 1935, they were broken down into smaller units, resulting in sixty districts. By 1940, the number of districts increased to forty-three and peaked at seventy in 1944–1955. By 1957, the number of districts decreased to sixty-three.

During the 1960s, some of the districts were merged, and their number diminished to thirty-seven. Only some of them were broken into smaller units again. The number of districts stabilized at forty-three after Atninsky District was split from Arsky District in 1990.

In 1952–1953, the Tatar ASSR was administratively divided into three oblasts—Bugulma, Chistopol, and Kazan Oblast, but due to the oblasts&#x27; small sizes they were abolished in 1954. On August 30, 1990, the Tatar ASSR became the first one to be elevated in status as a republic within the Russian SFSR, becoming the Republic of Tatarstan.
