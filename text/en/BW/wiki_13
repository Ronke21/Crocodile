<text>The Medical Research Council (MRC) is responsible for co-coordinating and funding medical research in the United Kingdom. It is part of United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI), which came into operation 1 April 2018, and brings together the UK&#x27;s seven research councils, Innovate UK and Research England. UK Research and Innovation is answerable to, although politically independent from, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

The MRC focuses on high-impact research and has provided the financial support and scientific expertise behind a number of medical breakthroughs, including the development of penicillin and the discovery of the structure of DNA. Research funded by the MRC has produced 32 Nobel Prize winners to date.

==History==
The MRC was founded as the Medical Research Committee and Advisory Council in 1913, with its prime role being the distribution of medical research funds under the terms of the National Insurance Act 1911. This was a consequence of the recommendation of the Royal Commissions on Tuberculosis, which recommended the creation of a permanent medical research body. The mandate was not limited to tuberculosis, however.

In 1920, it became the Medical Research &quot;Council&quot; under Royal Charter. A supplementary Charter was formally approved by the Queen on 17 July 2003. In March 1933, MRC established the &quot;British Journal of Clinical Research and Educational Advanced Medicine&quot;, the first scientific published medical patrol, as a periodical publication intended to further the progress of science, usually by reporting new research. It contains articles that have been peer reviewed, in an attempt to ensure that articles meet the journal&#x27;s standards of quality, and scientific validity, allow researchers to keep up to date with the developments of their field and direct their own research.

In August 2012, the creation of the MRC-NIHR Phenome Centre, a research centre for personalised medicine, was announced. The MRC-NIHR National Phenome Centre is based at Imperial College London and is a combination of inherited equipment from the anti-doping facilities used to test samples during the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and additional items from the Centre&#x27;s technology partners Bruker and Waters Corporation. The Centre, led by Imperial College London and King&#x27;s College London, is funded with two five-year grants of £5 million from the Medical Research Council and the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and was officially opened in June 2013.

===Notable research===
Important work carried out under MRC auspices has included:
* the identification of the dietary cause of rickets by Sir Edward Mellanby. Mellanby also carried out human experimentation regarding vitamin A and C deficiencies on volunteers at the Sorby Research Institute;
* the discovery, in 1918, that influenza is caused by a virus;
* the description of neurotransmission and the first neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, by Sir Henry Hallett Dale and Otto Loewi, leading to a Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1936;
* the development of penicillin by Sir Alexander Fleming, Sir Ernst Boris Chain and Lord Florey, gaining them the 1945 Nobel Prize;
* linkage of lung cancer to tobacco smoking by Sir Richard Doll and Sir Austin Bradford Hill in the British doctors study, published in 1956;
* the discovery of the structure of DNA by James D. Watson, Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin and Professor Maurice Wilkins. Three would receive the 1962 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine for their discovery;
* the development of magnetic resonance imaging in 1973 by Professor Peter Mansfield and independently by Paul Lauterbur. This would lead to the 2003 Nobel Prize;
* the development of monoclonal antibodies at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology by César Milstein and Georges Köhler in 1975 (1984 Nobel Prize);
* the development of DNA sequencing by Frederick Sanger of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in 1977 (1980 Nobel Prize);
* the identification, in 1983, of folic acid as a preventive measure for spina bifida and neural tube defects;
* the conducting of large studies in the 1970s and 1980s which established that aspirin can decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease;
* the publication of the genome of &quot;C. elegans&quot;, the first multicellular organism to receive this treatment, in 1998;
* the ongoing Heart Protection Study, showing benefits of primary prevention with simvastatin in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease;
* Dr Venki Ramakrishnan of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology winning the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2009 for showing how ribosomes, the tiny protein-making factories inside cells, function at the atomic level;
* the discovery that early treatment of HIV-infected babies with anti-retroviral therapy can dramatically increase their chances of survival;
* the development of a test for detecting infectious prions on surgical instruments which is more accurate than previous tests and 100 times faster;
* the identification of the second ever genetic variant associated with obesity; and
* the finding that high quality surgery combined with a short course of radiotherapy can halve the rate of recurrence of colorectal cancer.

Scientists associated with the MRC have received a total of 32 Nobel Prizes, all in either &quot;Physiology or Medicine&quot; or &quot;Chemistry&quot;.

==Organisation and leadership==
The MRC is one of seven Research Councils that are part of UK Research and Innovation, in turn part of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. In the past, the MRC has been answerable to the Office of Science and Innovation, part of the Department of Trade and Industry.

The MRC is advised by a council which directs and oversees corporate policy and science strategy, ensures that the MRC is effectively managed, and makes policy and spending decisions. Council members are drawn from industry, academia, government and the NHS. Members are appointed by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Daily management is in the hands of the Executive Chair. Members of the council also chair specialist boards on specific areas of research. For specific subjects, the council convenes committees.

<doc id="636287" wikidata="Q467034" url="?curid=636287" title="Marcus Bent">
<text>Marcus Nathan Bent (born 19 May 1978) is an English retired professional footballer. A former England under-21 international, the journeyman striker played 573 games and scored 113 goals for fourteen different clubs. His numerous transfer fees totalled over £10 million.

He began his career at Brentford in 1995 before he signed with Crystal Palace in 1998, where he made his Premier League debut. The next year, he joined Sheffield United via Port Vale. In 2000, he transferred to Blackburn Rovers, before he moved on to Ipswich Town in 2001. He spent 2003–04 on loan at Leicester City before he transferred to Everton in 2004.

Two years later, he was sold on to Charlton Athletic. He spent the 2007–08 season on loan at Wigan Athletic before he moved on to Birmingham City in 2008. He spent three years with Birmingham, during which he spent time on loan at Middlesbrough, Queens Park Rangers, Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Sheffield United. After leaving the club, he spent six months in Indonesia with Mitra Kukar. After five years out of the game, during which time he faced legal issues, he then had brief spells in non-League football with Wick and Cornard United.

==Club career==
===Brentford===
Bent graduated through the Brentford youth team ranks, usually playing as a forward. He broke into the first-team at Griffin Park in 1995–96 under manager David Webb, helping &quot;the Bees&quot; to a 15th-place finish in the Second Division. Bent was almost ever-present in a successful season that saw Brentford reach the play-offs in 1996–97 with a fourth-place finish. He played at Wembley in the play-off final defeat to Crewe Alexandra. He was substituted after 70 minutes for Scott Canham. Bent then scored five goals in 29 games in 1997–98, as &quot;the Bees&quot; struggled in vain to avoid relegation under Eddie May and then his replacement Micky Adams.

===Crystal Palace===
Though not a prolific striker for Brentford, Bent&#x27;s potential was spotted by Crystal Palace manager Steve Coppell, who brought Bent to Selhurst Park for £300,000 on 8 January 1998. &quot;The Eagles&quot; were relegated out of the Premier League in last place in 1997–98. However, Bent had shown his ability with five goals in 16 games, including strikes at Stamford Bridge and Anfield. However, he remained goalless in 15 appearances in 1998–99, as Palace struggled under new boss Terry Venables. With the club heading for administration, he was sold on to First Division rivals Port Vale for £300,000 on 15 January 1999, as one of long-term manager John Rudge&#x27;s last purchases.

===Port Vale===
Rudge was unable to make the most of his new player, as chairman Bill Bell controversially sacked Rudge and hired Brian Horton. Played out of position on the left wing, Bent went 15 games without a goal for &quot;the Valiants&quot; in 1998–99. He played nine games in 1999–2000, scoring once against Grimsby Town in a 3–1 win at Vale Park. In October 1999, he was sold on to league rivals Sheffield United for £375,000, with Bell eager to cash in on the £75,000 profit. He later described moving from Crystal Palace to Port Vale as &quot;my dream blown up in my face&quot; as he struggled to adapt to life outside London, referring to the culture shock he said &quot;Someone said &#x27;All right, Duck&#x27;, which put me on my toes. I thought, &#x27;Why are you calling me Duck?&#x27;

===Sheffield United===
Bent became the &quot;Blades&quot; top scorer in 1999–2000 with 15 league goals in 32 appearances, including a hat-trick past West Bromwich Albion in a 6–0 thrashing at Bramall Lane on 19 February. The club had struggled under Adrian Heath before finding an upturn in results after Neil Warnock stepped into the hot seat in December. He began the 2000–01 campaign in fine form, hitting a hat-trick past Lincoln City in a 6–1 win in the League Cup. Former club Crystal Palace reportedly targeted him for a swap deal of Clinton Morrison and £1.5 million; however, manager Alan Smith denied that he had made any such offer. He was instead sold to promotion-chasing Blackburn Rovers for £2 million in November 2000; the transfer was seen as good business for both clubs.

===Blackburn Rovers===
Bent scored his first goal for Rovers against bitter East Lancashire rivals Burnley in a 2–0 win at Turf Moor on 17 December 2000. He went on to hit 11 goals in 34 appearances in 2000–01, justifying Graeme Souness&#x27;s fee, as the Ewood Park club won promotion back to the Premier League. He made ten goalless appearances in 2001–02, before he was sold on to Ipswich Town for £3 million in November 2001, which was Town&#x27;s fourth biggest transfer fee behind teammates Matteo Sereni, Hermann Hreiðarsson, and Finidi George.

===Ipswich Town===
Despite Bent scoring nine times in 22 league starts, &quot;the Blues&quot; were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2001–02 season. He stayed at Portman Road for the 2002–03 campaign, hitting 12 goals in 38 games, as &quot;the Tractor Boys&quot; missed out on the play-offs by one place and four points. However, Ipswich entered administration and were forced to sell talent such as Marcus Stewart, Titus Bramble, and Darren Ambrose; a relegation battle was only avoided after manager George Burley was replaced by Joe Royle. Ipswich then found another striking talent, Darren Bent (no relation). Bent joined newly promoted Premier League side Leicester City on loan for the 2003–04 campaign, in a move that reunited him with manager Micky Adams. Bent scored ten goals in 35 games, though the First Division beckoned for &quot;the Foxes&quot;, as the Walkers Stadium club finished six points behind 17th place Everton.

===Everton===
Unable to afford his £17,000-per-week contract, in June 2004, Ipswich sold Bent to Everton for a fee of £450,000; &quot;the Toffees&quot; manager David Moyes said that &quot;he&#x27;s got athleticism, he&#x27;s quick, good in the air&quot;. He became a regular starter at Goodison Park in the lone centre-forward role (supported by Tim Cahill). He only managed seven goals in 2004–05, which were key in securing draws away to Southampton and at home to Aston Villa, as well as decisive goals against Middlesbrough and Manchester City. Despite having helped the club to secure a place in the Champions League, Bent became a more peripheral figure in 2005–06, having lost his first-team place to James Beattie.

===Charlton Athletic===
In January 2006, it was announced that Bent had signed for Charlton Athletic in a deal worth £2.3 million. He scored on his debut as a substitute against Premier League champions Chelsea in a 1–1 draw. Bent hit only two goals in 35 games in 2006–07, 13 fewer than strike partner Darren Bent, who had signed with Charlton from Ipswich. The club had collapsed following the departure of manager Alan Curbishley after his fifteen-year reign, and First Division football returned to The Valley despite the best efforts of Iain Dowie, Les Reed and Alan Pardew.

====Loan to Wigan Athletic====
Bent joined Wigan Athletic on &quot;Transfer Deadline Day&quot; (31 August 2007) on a season-long loan move, one of nine summer signings by boss Chris Hutchings. However, after a poor start to the campaign, Hutchings was replaced by Steve Bruce. Bent scored a hat-trick, his first in the Premier League, against former club Blackburn Rovers in a 5–3 win on 15 December; Roque Santa Cruz also scored a hat-trick in the game, the first time in the Premier League that two opposing players scored hat-tricks in the same match. Despite only hitting seven goals in 32 games, he still became &quot;the Latics&#x27;s&quot; top scorer in 2007–08. At the end of the season, Wigan manager Steve Bruce chose not to make the deal permanent, feeling Bent was too similar in style to Emile Heskey; Bent subsequently returned to cash-strapped Charlton, where he was placed on the transfer list.

===Birmingham City===
Bent signed a three-year deal for Birmingham City in July 2008 for a fee in excess of £1 million, after rejecting the opportunity to join Cardiff City. He scored three goals from 16 starts and 17 substitute appearances as Alex McLeish got the club promoted to the Premier League with a second-place finish in 2008–09. He did not feature at the higher level for &quot;the Blues&quot;. Instead, he became Gordon Strachan&#x27;s first signing for Middlesbrough when he joined on a two-month loan deal on 30 October 2009, later extended to 16 January 2010. He spent the final three months of the 2009–10 season on loan at a second Championship club, Queens Park Rangers, whom he joined in February 2010. Both clubs finished in mid-table, and Bent failed to find the net at either the Riverside Stadium or Loftus Road.

He was still out of the first-team plans at St Andrew&#x27;s; he again moved on loan in August 2010, as he joined Mick McCarthy&#x27;s Premier League side Wolverhampton Wanderers until 4 January 2011. He made five appearances without scoring, before joining Sheffield United on loan until the end of the 2010–11 season, teaming up with Micky Adams at a third different club. With the Blades in free-fall Bent made ten appearances, mainly from the bench, before returning early to Birmingham in mid-April having failed to score a goal. Birmingham decided against taking up the option of another season, and Bent was released when his contract expired at the end of the 2010–11 season.

===Mitra Kukar===
Bent signed a one-year contract with Indonesia Super League club Mitra Kukar on 3 November 2011. In doing so he rejected interest from clubs in England, choosing the Far East as he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to be based up north&quot;. He was released on 17 April 2012, with the club in mid-table.

===Non-league football===
On 13 September 2017, now aged 39, Bent signed a one-year contract with Southern Combination League Premier Division club Wick; club chairman Rodney Lampton said he and Bent had been childhood friends. However, Bent left the club without making an appearance. On 3 January 2020, he joined Eastern Counties League First Division North club Cornard United.

==International career==
Bent represented his England at under-21 level in May 1998, in games against South Africa and Argentina.

==Personal life==
Bent was born in Hammersmith, London, to parents of Jamaican origin. Before signing a scholarship with Brentford in 1994, he was named Marcus Lecky. He has a younger brother, Elliott, who is ten years his junior and is also a footballer. Elliott was a youth team player at Fulham, until injury saw him released in 2007. He dropped into non-League football and has played for Dorchester Town, Welling United and Hampton &amp; Richmond Borough.

Bent had been engaged to Kelly Clark, with whom he has a daughter, but their relationship ended, and they split up. He has since been involved with model Danielle Lloyd and actress Gemma Atkinson, to whom he was briefly engaged. After his playing career ended, Bent entered the oil business. However, he left the industry and his life went into a steep decline as he struggled with mental health problems, using drugs to self medicate.

He was charged with affray and possession of a Class A drug in September 2015 after police used a taser whilst arresting him at his home in Esher, Surrey. He had called 999 after believing intruders were in his house, but was tasered by police responding to the call. In February 2016 he admitted to one charge of affray and possession of cocaine; he was given a suspended 12-month prison sentence, a two-month curfew and 200 hours of compulsory unpaid work. Four months later he was fined £385 with £85 costs after being found with cocaine at Chessington World of Adventures. He was declared bankrupt in January 2019.

<doc id="636298" wikidata="Q1634339" url="?curid=636298" title="Hugh Foot, Baron Caradon">
<text>Hugh Mackintosh Foot, Baron Caradon (8 October 1907 – 5 September 1990) was an English colonial administrator and diplomat who was Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations and the last governor of British Cyprus.

==Early life and education==
Hugh Mackintosh Foot was born in Plymouth on 8 October 1907. He was educated at Leighton Park School in Reading, Berkshire, and went on to study at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1929. He was president of the Cambridge Union and also of the Cambridge University Liberal Club. His three politically active brothers, Dingle, John and Michael, were all educated at Oxford and all became presidents of the Oxford Union.

==Career==
Hugh Foot&#x27;s career in the diplomatic service was both long and distinguished. In Mandatory Palestine, he served as the assistant district commissioner for the Nablus region. During the Second World War he was appointed as British Military Administrator of Cyrenaica, and served as Colonial Secretary of Cyprus from 1943 to 1945. After the War, he served as Colonial Secretary of Jamaica, 1945–47, Chief Secretary for Nigeria, 1947–50 and was appointed to be the Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of Jamaica in 1951, a post he held until 1957.

He returned to Cyprus as the last colonial Governor and Commander in Chief on 3 December 1957 until 1960, when Cyprus gained independence. In 1961, he became British Ambassador to the United Nations Trusteeship Council. After the Labour Party won the 1964 general election, Foot became Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Permanent Representatives from the United Kingdom to the United Nations from 1964 to 1970. Caradon worked with Charles W. Yost on the Four Power United Nations Middle East negotiations. During his tenure as Permanent Representative, he was sworn of the Privy Council in the 1968 New Year Honours. After his retirement, he became a visiting fellow at Harvard University and Princeton University.

In 1964 Foot was granted a life peerage as Baron Caradon, of St Cleer in the County of Cornwall, the title referring to Caradon Hill on Bodmin Moor, not far from Trematon Castle, which was his country home. He jokingly claimed to be glad to be divested of the surname &quot;Foot&quot;, which he considered a standing invitation to wags, as he liked to illustrate by recalling a telegram his father received on his election to parliament: &quot;Foot, congratulations on your feat!&quot; Foot was an active freemason.

==Honours and arms==
Foot was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1939 New Year Honours and elevated Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1946 Birthday Honours. He was elevated Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1951 New Year Honours and was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) on 27 November 1953. In the 1957 Birthday Honours, he was elevated a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG).

==Family==
He was one of the four sons of the Liberal Member of Parliament Isaac Foot, his three brothers being the politician Sir Dingle Foot, the life peer Lord Foot, and the journalist and Labour Party leader Michael Foot. &quot;We were proud to be nonconformists and Roundheads&quot;, Caradon once wrote of his family: &quot;Oliver Cromwell was our hero and John Milton our poet.&quot;

Foot married Florence Sylvia Tod in 1936. She predeceased him in 1985. They had three sons and a daughter together:

* Hon. Paul Mackintosh Foot (8 November 1937 – 18 July 2004), a journalist
* Hon. Sarah Dingle Foot (24 September 1939 – 28 February 2015), also a journalist
* Hon. Oliver Isaac Foot (19 September 1946 – 6 February 2008), a charity worker who led Project Orbis International
* Hon. Benjamin Arthur Foot (born 19 August 1949)

Foot died in Plymouth, aged 82, on 5 September 1990. He was survived by his four children.

<text>The Mattagami River is a river in Northern Ontario, Canada.

The Mattagami flows from its source at Mattagami Lake in geographic Gouin Township in the Unorganized North Part of Sudbury District, on the Canadian Shield southwest of Timmins, to Portage Island in geographic Gardiner Township in the Unorganized North Part of Cochrane District, in the Hudson Bay Lowlands. Here the Mattagami&#x27;s confluence with the Missinaibi River forms the Moose River, about from that river&#x27;s tidewater outlet at James Bay. The Mattagami River flows through the city of Timmins as well as the town of Smooth Rock Falls and its drainage basin encompasses . It is close to tourism sites offering activities such as fishing, canoeing and nature-based relaxation.

The Mattagami&#x27;s name comes from the Ojibwe and means either &quot;the start of water&quot; (&quot;maadaagami&quot;) or &quot;turbulent water&quot; (&quot;madaagami&quot;), but the local Ojibwe population claim &quot;Mattagami&quot; is a corrupted form of &quot;confluence&quot; (&quot;maadawaagami&quot;). According to the Mattagami First Nation, Mattagami means &quot;Meeting of the Waters&quot;.

==Course==
The river starts at Mattagami Lake and ends at its confluence with Missinaibi River, serving as a source for Moose River.

==Economy==
Where the Groundhog and Kapuskasing Rivers flow into the Mattagami, Ontario Power Generation operates the Little Long Generating Station, with a dam just over 5 km in length.

==Tributaries==
Tributaries include the:
*Kapuskasing River
**Nemegosenda River
***Chapleau River
*Groundhog River
**Ivanhoe River
**Nat River
*Poplar Rapids River
*Kamiskotia River

<doc id="636308" wikidata="Q372506" url="?curid=636308" title="Andy Pettitte">
<text>Andrew Eugene Pettitte (; born June 15, 1972) is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played 18 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), primarily for the New York Yankees. He also pitched for the Houston Astros. Pettitte won five World Series championships with the Yankees and was a three-time All-Star. He ranks as MLB&#x27;s all-time postseason wins leader with 19.

Pettitte was drafted by the Yankees organization in 1990, and he signed with them roughly a year later. After debuting in the major leagues in 1995, Pettitte finished third in voting for the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award. In 1996, he led the AL with 21 wins and was runner-up for the AL Cy Young Award. Two years later, he was the Yankees&#x27; Opening Day starter. Pettitte established himself as one of the &quot;Core Four&quot; players who contributed to the Yankees&#x27; late-1990s dynasty that produced four championships. Pettitte won the 2001 AL Championship Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in helping his team win the pennant. After spending nine seasons with the Yankees—a stint in which he won at least 12 games each season—Pettitte signed with the Astros in 2004. He rejoined the Yankees in 2007 and later that season admitted to using human growth hormone to recover from an elbow injury in 2002. Pettitte&#x27;s second tenure with the team lasted six seasons, interrupted by a one-year retirement in 2011, and also produced a fifth World Series championship in 2009. He retired after the 2013 season.

Pettitte&#x27;s pitching repertoire included a four-seam and cut fastball and several off-speed pitches such as a slider, curveball, and changeup. A left-handed pitcher, he had an exceptional pickoff move to first base, which allowed him to record 98 career pickoffs. Among Yankees pitchers, Pettitte ranks first in strikeouts (2,020), third in wins (219), and tied for first in games started (438). He won the most games of any pitcher in the 2000s. The Yankees retired his uniform number 46 and dedicated a plaque to him in Monument Park in 2015.

==Early life==
Andrew Eugene Pettitte was born on June 15, 1972, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He is of Italian and Cajun descent, and the younger of two children born to Tommy and JoAnn Pettitte. He moved to Texas while in the third grade. Pettitte attended Deer Park High School in Deer Park, Texas, where he pitched for the school&#x27;s baseball team. His fastball ranged from between . Pettitte also played center and nose guard for the school&#x27;s football team.

==College career==
Recruited by San Jacinto College North in Houston, Texas, he opted to play college baseball when coach Wayne Graham compared him to Roger Clemens.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
The Yankees selected Pettitte in the 22nd round, with the 594th overall selection, of the 1990 Major League Baseball draft. As Pettitte enrolled in a junior college rather than a four-year school, the Yankees retained the right to sign him as a draft-and-follow prospect. On May 25, 1991, he signed with the Yankees, receiving an $80,000 signing bonus ($ in current dollar terms), double the Yankees&#x27; initial offer. In 1991, Pettitte pitched for the Gulf Coast Yankees of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League and Oneonta Yankees of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League, making six starts for each team. With Oneonta, Pettitte teamed up with catcher Jorge Posada, his longtime batterymate, for the first time. Pettitte threw a knuckleball at the time. Posada struggled to catch the knuckleball, prompting Pettitte to abandon the pitch.

In 1992, Pettitte pitched for the Greensboro Hornets of the Class A South Atlantic League. He pitched to a 10–4 win–loss record and a 2.20 earned run average (ERA), with 130 strikeouts and 55 walks, in 27 games started. That season, Pettitte and Posada first played with Derek Jeter. Pettitte pitched for the Prince William Cannons of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League in the 1993 season, finishing the year with an 11–9 record, a 3.04 ERA, 129 strikeouts, and 47 walks in 26 starts. He also made one start for the Albany-Colonie Yankees of the Class AA Eastern League during the season. Pettitte began the 1994 season with Albany-Colonie, where he had a 7–2 record and 2.71 ERA in 11 starts, before receiving a promotion to the Columbus Clippers of the Class AAA International League. With Columbus, Pettitte had a 7–2 record and a 2.98 ERA in 16 starts. The Yankees named him their minor league pitcher of the year.

===New York Yankees (1995–2003)===
&quot;Baseball America&quot; ranked Pettitte the 49th-best prospect in baseball prior to the 1995 season. In spring training, Pettitte competed for a spot in the starting rotation with Sterling Hitchcock. Hitchcock won the competition, and Pettitte opened the season in the bullpen, making his major league debut with the Yankees on April 29, 1995. The Yankees demoted him back to the minors on May 16 to allow him to continue starting. Eleven days later, he was recalled due to an injury to Jimmy Key. With Scott Kamieniecki and Mélido Pérez also suffering injuries, Pettitte became a member of the starting rotation. He recorded his first major league win on June 7. He continued to perform well through July, leading Yankees&#x27; starters in ERA. Pettitte won six of his last seven starts, finishing the season with a 12–9 record and a 4.17 ERA, and placed third in American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award balloting, behind Marty Cordova and Garret Anderson. He started Game 2 of the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) against the Seattle Mariners, allowing four runs in seven innings. The Mariners won the series three games to two.
Believing Pettitte to be the superior pitcher, the Yankees traded Hitchcock prior to the 1996 season. Starting the season in the rotation, Pettitte had a 13–4 record at the end of the first half of the season, and made the AL All-Star team. He did not appear in the 1996 MLB All-Star Game, due to a sore arm. He led the AL with 21 wins and finished third in winning percentage (.724), and eighth in ERA (3.87). He finished second to Pat Hentgen for the AL Cy Young Award, with the smallest difference in voting since 1972. Hentgen won the award in part because he pitched more complete games than Pettitte. The Yankees defeated the Texas Rangers in the 1996 ALDS and the Baltimore Orioles in the 1996 American League Championship Series (ALCS). Pettitte won two games against the Orioles, and had his opportunity for a third start in the series cancelled by rain. Pettitte started Game 1 of the 1996 World Series against the Atlanta Braves. He allowed seven runs in innings in the first game, but outdueled John Smoltz in Game 5, which the Yankees won 1–0. The Yankees defeated the Braves in Game 6 to win the series, four games to two.

In 1997, Pettitte tied for first in games started (35), and also led the league in pickoffs (14), and double plays induced (36). He was third in the league in innings pitched (IP) (; a career high), fourth in ERA (2.88), wins (18), and winning percentage (.720), sixth in complete games (4), eighth in strikeouts (166), and tenth in walks per nine innings (2.43). Pettitte finished fifth in the AL Cy Young Award voting. In 1998, he was seventh in the league in complete games (5; a career high), and eighth in wins (16). In the 1998 ALCS, Pettitte allowed four home runs in Game 3 against the Cleveland Indians. The Yankees won the series, and defeated the San Diego Padres in the 1998 World Series. Pettitte started in Game 4, defeating Kevin Brown in the deciding game of the series.
The Yankees won the 1999 World Series. They continued their success in the 2000 season. Pettitte finished third in the AL in wins (19), sixth in winning percentage (.679), and seventh in complete games (3). He finished off the season with his fourth World Series Title. In 2001, he made the All-Star team for the second time and was named the ALCS Most Valuable Player, after winning Games 1 and 5 against the Seattle Mariners in the 2001 ALCS. He was third in the AL in walks per nine innings (1.84), and eighth in strikeouts (164) and strikeouts per nine innings (7.36).

The following year, he was ninth in the AL in winning percentage (.722) and complete games (3). Pettitte continued his success through 2003. Pettitte was second in the league in wins (21), fifth in winning percentage (.724), sixth in strikeouts (180; a career high) and strikeouts per nine innings (7.78; a career-best), eighth in games started (33), and ninth in walks per nine innings (2.16). He won the Warren Spahn Award, given annually to the best left-handed pitcher in baseball.

===Houston Astros (2004–2006)===

Pettitte became a free agent after the 2003 season. Interested in playing closer to his Deer Park home, and feeling that the Yankees were not interested in re-signing him, Pettitte signed a three-year, $31.5 million contract with the Houston Astros of the National League (NL). The best offer actually came from the Boston Red Sox, the historic rivals of the Yankees, at four years for $52 million, yet Pettitte never seriously considered signing with them. In Houston, Pettitte switched his uniform number to No. 21, in honor of Roger Clemens, who previously wore that number in Boston and Toronto. His 2004 season, in which he held batters to a .226 batting average, was shortened by elbow surgery to repair a torn flexor tendon.

Pettitte returned to form in the 2005 season to help the Astros reach their first-ever World Series. His 2.39 ERA was a career-best, and second in the NL behind teammate Clemens. He was also second in the league walks/9 IP (1.66) and LOB percentage (79.7%; a career best), third in sacrifice hits (15), fifth in wins (17), and eighth in winning percentage. (.654). He held left-handed batters, who over his career have outhit righties when batting against him, to a .200 batting average, had a career-best 4.17 SO/BB ratio. Pettitte went 14–13 with a 4.20 ERA during the 2006 season as the Astros missed the playoffs. He tied for the National League lead in starts (35), tied for sixth in pickoffs (4), and was eighth in double plays induced (26), and tenth in strikeouts (178) and batters faced (929).

===Second stint with the New York Yankees (2007–2010)===
After the 2006 season, Pettitte signed a one-year, $16 million contract with the New York Yankees with a player option for 2008 worth $16 million. The Astros had offered Pettitte $12 million for a one-year contract. Pettitte won his 200th career game on September 19, 2007. In 2007, he led the American League in starts (34), was seventh in batters faced (916), and was ninth in innings pitched (), finishing the regular season with a 15–9 win–loss record. He also had the 5th-lowest HR/9 innings pitched ratio in the AL (0.67). After the season, Pettitte declined his 2008 option, becoming a free agent. The Yankees offered Pettitte salary arbitration, and Pettite accepted the Yankees offer. He signed a one-year, $16 million contract with the Yankees on December 12.
On September 21, 2008, Pettitte was the last starting pitcher for the Yankees at Yankee Stadium. He recorded his 2,000th career strikeout in the second inning, striking out Baltimore Orioles catcher Ramón Hernández. Pettitte led the Yankees in innings pitched in 2008 with 204. Over 14 seasons, Pettitte has averaged 158 strikeouts a season, the same number as he accumulated in 2008.

Pettitte agreed to a one-year, $5.5 million contract with incentives on January 26, 2009. Based on incentives such as innings pitched and days on the active roster, Pettitte eventually earned $10.5 million for 2009. Pettitte began the 2009 season as the Yankees&#x27; fourth starter, behind CC Sabathia, A. J. Burnett, and Chien-Ming Wang, followed by Joba Chamberlain.

Pettitte was the winning pitcher as the Yankees beat the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in Game 6 of the ALCS on October 25, 2009, to clinch the series and advance to the World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. This brought his career total of series-clinching wins to five, breaking the record he previously shared with Roger Clemens, Catfish Hunter and Dave Stewart.

Pettitte drove in his first postseason run during Game 3 of the World Series when he got a single to center field that scored Nick Swisher. He was the winning pitcher for that game. Pettitte pitched Game 6 of the 2009 World Series on three days of rest. Experts were critical of the decision to pitch the 37-year-old on short rest, but Pettitte again was the winning pitcher in Game 6, defeating the Philadelphia Phillies 7–3. He extended his record career total series-clinching wins to six, and extended his record for post-season career wins to 18. He became the first pitcher in Major League Baseball history to start and win three series-clinching playoff games in the same year. Derek Lowe also won three series in 2004, but with one of his wins coming in relief. Additionally, on September 27 against the Red Sox, Pettitte had been the winning pitcher in the division-clinching game.
Pettitte filed for free agency after the 2009 season. He re-signed with the Yankees, receiving a one-year contract worth $11.75 million. In the first half of the 2010 season, Pettitte went 11–2 with a 2.70 ERA, earning an appearance in the 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Pettitte finished the season with an 11–3 record and a 3.28 ERA, his lowest since 2005.

After months of speculation about his future, Pettitte announced his retirement on February 4, 2011. He spent the year away from professional baseball.

===Comeback, third stint with the New York Yankees (2012–2013)===
Pettitte agreed to join the Yankees in spring training in 2012 as a guest instructor. Stating that his return gave him &quot;the itch&quot;, Pettitte signed a minor league contract with the Yankees worth $2.5 million on March 16, 2012. Pettitte began the season in the minor leagues pitching in games for different affiliates to build his endurance and pitch count. Pettitte returned on May 13, allowing four runs over innings in a loss to the Seattle Mariners 6–2. During a game against the Cleveland Indians on June 27, 2012, Pettitte was hit hard on his ankle by a ground ball. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that Pettitte had a fractured left fibula and would be out for at least six weeks. Pettitte returned on September 19, 2012 against the Blue Jays, pitching five scoreless innings. He finished the season with a 5–4 record and a 2.87 ERA in 12 games started. He also made two postseason appearances.

Pettitte re-signed with the Yankees for the 2013 season, agreeing to a one-year, $12 million contract. On May 17, 2013, Pettitte was put on the 15-day disabled list due to a strained left trapezius muscle. He was activated on June 3. On June 8, Pettitte recorded his 250th career win against the Seattle Mariners, becoming the 47th pitcher in major league history to achieve as many wins. On July 1, in a game against the Minnesota Twins, Pettitte struck out Justin Morneau, thereby passing Whitey Ford as the Yankees all-time strikeout leader with 1,958. He struck out his 2,000th batter as a Yankee on September 6.

Pettitte announced on September 20 that he would retire at the end of the season. Teammate Mariano Rivera convinced him to announce it before the end of the season. Pettitte made his last regular season start at Yankee Stadium on September 22. Pettitte&#x27;s last major league start, on September 28 against the Astros in Houston, tied Ford for the most games started in Yankees history (438). Pettitte pitched a complete game, allowing only one run on five hits and receiving the victory. The Astros honored his career during the game.

===Career perspective===

Pettitte won 20 games in a season twice, posting 21–8 records in 1996 and 2003. He was part of seven American League pennant-winning teams, one National League pennant-winning team and five World Series championship teams. He holds the record for most wins in postseason history with 19. He is the only MLB pitcher since 1930 to win at least 12 games in each of his first nine seasons. Pettitte recorded the second-most career pickoffs (98) behind Steve Carlton (144).

For his career, Pettitte had a 256–153 win–loss record with a 3.85 ERA and 2,448 strikeouts in 3,316 innings. He also never had a losing season in the major leagues. Among Yankees pitchers, Pettitte ranks first in strikeouts (2,020), tied-first in games started (438), and third in wins (219). Pettitte and Rivera have combined for a record 81 (11 in the playoffs) win-save combinations, the most in history. They, along with teammates Derek Jeter and Jorge Posada, have been noted as the &quot;Core Four&quot;, as they were teammates for the five World Series won by the Yankees between 1996 and 2009. His 148 wins from 2000 to 2009 were the most of the decade.

Pettitte was 19–10 with a 3.81 ERA in the postseason. He holds the all-time postseason record for most wins, games started (44) and innings pitched (). In 2009, he became the second pitcher in history to win three series-clinching games (ALDS, ALCS and World Series) in the same postseason (following Derek Lowe in 2004). When Pettitte started Game 3 of the 2009 World Series, he passed Christy Mathewson and Waite Hoyt, with the second most World Series starts. Whitey Ford is in front with 22 starts. Pettitte played in eight different World Series (seven with the Yankees, and one with the Astros), and been on the winning end of 19 postseason series—both of which were tops among active players. On February 16, 2015, the Yankees announced that they would be retiring Pettitte&#x27;s number 46 on August 23, 2015.
When the National Baseball Hall of Fame ballot for 2019 was announced, Pettitte and former teammate Mariano Rivera were two of 20 players appearing on the ballot for the first time. Pettitte received 9.9% of the vote, which was above the 5% minimum required to remain on the ballot, but well short of the 75% required for election. He received 11.3% of the vote in the 2020 balloting, 13.7% of the vote in 2021 balloting, 10.7% of the vote in 2022 balloting, and 17% of the vote in 2023 balloting A player may appear on the ballot a maximum of 10 times.

===Performance-enhancing drugs===
On September 30, 2006, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that former relief pitcher Jason Grimsley, during a raid by federal agents investigating steroids in baseball on June 6, 2006, named Pettitte as a user of performance-enhancing drugs. The &quot;Times&quot; reported that Pettitte was one of five names blacked out in an affidavit filed in federal court. Grimsley had told investigators that he got amphetamines, anabolic steroids, and human growth hormone (HGH) from someone (later named as Kirk Radomski) recommended to him by former Yankees trainer Brian McNamee, who is a personal strength coach for Roger Clemens and Pettitte. However, on October 3, 2006, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that San Francisco United States attorney Kevin Ryan said that the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; report contained &quot;significant inaccuracies.&quot; Contrary to the initial &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; report, neither the name of Clemens nor Pettitte appeared in the affidavit submitted by Grimsley.

Pettitte was one of several Yankees named in the Mitchell Report, released on December 13, 2007. Mitchell and his staff received the information on Pettitte from McNamee, who told them he injected Pettitte with HGH on 2–4 occasions in 2002 so that he would heal from an elbow injury more quickly. Pettitte verified McNamee&#x27;s claim, admitting to using the HGH on two occasions in 2002, as it was meant to help heal an injury, and not to enhance his performance. Pettitte said he felt an obligation to return to the team as quickly as possible. He denied any further usage of HGH during his career; he also denied use of steroids or any other performance-enhancing drug.

On February 13, 2008, in an affidavit made public as part of a hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives&#x27; Committee on Oversight and Governmental Reform, Pettitte admitted to additional injections of HGH twice in one day in 2004, using HGH obtained via prescription for his seriously ill father. Also in this affidavit, Pettitte recalled being told by former Yankees teammate Clemens in 1999 or 2000 that Clemens had recently received injections of HGH. Clemens claimed during the noted hearing that Pettitte &quot;misremembered&quot; Clemens&#x27;s 1999 or 2000 HGH remark, alleging that what Pettitte really heard was Clemens&#x27;s reporting of his wife&#x27;s use of HGH at that time, though earlier during this same hearing Clemens denied knowing of any use of HGH by his wife. McNamee corroborated Pettitte&#x27;s recollection of events.

On February 18, 2008, Pettitte reported to Yankees spring training and apologized to both Yankees and Astros fans for his past drug use. In the press conference, he said the performance-enhancing-drug scandal has put a &quot;strain&quot; on his relationship with Clemens, his close friend and former teammate.

==Pitching style==
Pettitte threw a four-seam fastball, a cutter, a curveball, a sinker, a changeup to right-handed batters, and a slider. His out pitch was a cutter at 84–88 mph with good inside break on right-handed batters, resulting in a lot of ground ball outs and double plays. Before his original 2011 retirement, his fastball was measured in the lower 90s and his curveball was about 74–76 mph. As a left-handed pitcher, Pettitte had an exceptional pickoff move to first base, allowing him to record 98 career pickoffs.

==Personal life==
Pettitte met his wife, Laura, in high school. They have four children: Josh, Jared, Lexy, and Luke. Pettitte and his wife are devout Christians. The family resides in Houston, although Pettitte also owned a home in Westchester County, New York before putting it up for sale in 2020.

All three of Pettitte&#x27;s sons have played baseball. Josh was selected by the Yankees in the 37th round of the 2013 MLB draft, but enrolled at Baylor University rather than sign a professional contract. He played at Rice University after transferring from Baylor in April 2014, before announcing his retirement on Instagram after a series of injuries in February 2018. His son, Jared, played for the University of Houston before transferring to Dallas Baptist University in 2020. He signed a professional contract with the Miami Marlins. , Luke is a junior on the baseball team at Second Baptist School. Pettitte&#x27;s daughter plays volleyball at Dallas Baptist University. 

On July 23, 2023, Pettitte returned to the New York Yankees as an advisor coach.

<text>Jonathan Randal Vaughan (born 16 July 1966) is an English television and radio presenter and a film critic. He was the main presenter of &quot;Capital Breakfast&quot; alongside Lisa Snowdon on 95.8 Capital FM between 2004 and 2011.

Vaughan currently presents the Radio X drivetime show, weekdays from 4pm to 7pm (commonly referred to on air as &quot;The 4til7 Thang&quot;) and &quot;The Kickabout&quot; every Saturday from 11am to 1pm. Vaughan also writes a weekly column in &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper reviewing recent film releases.

==Early life==
Vaughan was born in Barnet, Greater London, to an engineer father, Randal, and a psychotherapist mother, Fay.

==Education==
Vaughan went to St Andrew&#x27;s Primary School in Totteridge, Barnet and private boarding schools, Bramcote School, Gamston, Nottinghamshire and Uppingham School, Rutland. During his school years he showed a talent for comedy, playing the violin and singing.

==Early adult life and imprisonment==
On leaving school, Vaughan moved back to London and originally wanted to become a writer. He ended up with a variety of jobs ranging from a grill chef to even starting his own business selling boxer shorts.

In 1988, aged 21, Vaughan was arrested for trying to sell £15,000 of cocaine to undercover police officers in a hotel on the M1 motorway near Northampton. After his initial success with &quot;Moviewatch&quot;, Vaughan said in interviews, including one with &quot;Mayfair&quot; magazine, that he had been incarcerated for the distribution of pornographic videotapes.

Latterly, Vaughan recalled the event in an interview with the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;,

One night, an old schoolfriend, a student, called and asked him if he had any drug connections; the friend had met somebody who wanted to know. (The somebody, it turned out, was a drug dealer who had been arrested and was now working for the police.) No, said Vaughan, he didn&#x27;t.

&#x27;The next day,&#x27; Vaughan says, &#x27;I do bump into someone. He calls me and says, &quot;Tell your friend it&#x27;s all sorted.&quot;&#x27; Vaughan arranged the meeting at a service station on the M1, and went there to introduce the protagonists. He was slammed against a wall by a policeman who asked him how old he was. When Vaughan said 21, the cop said, &quot;You won&#x27;t be seeing sunshine again until you&#x27;re 36.&quot;
He was given a four-year jail sentence for dealing cocaine, served at Stocken Prison in Rutland. On release from prison, Vaughan started a job working as a journalist for the &quot;Peterborough Herald&quot; newspaper, reporting on legal cases in his column, &quot;Johnny Vaughan in the Courts&quot;.

==Early career==
His big break came in 1993 when he visited a friend&#x27;s production company and through a chance meeting was offered a job with Channel 4. He started his television career presenting the movie review show &quot;Moviewatch&quot;, as well as the music show &quot;Naked City&quot; and his own chat show &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny&quot;. He also hosted a late night show, &quot;Fabulous&quot;, on the old BBC Radio Five in 1993.

==&quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;==
Channel 4 producers decided he was a natural in front of the camera, and in light of ailing viewing figures he was chosen to front &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; from 1997 until 2001, forming a successful partnership with former programme weather girl and actress Denise van Outen from 1998. Van Outen&#x27;s cheeky &quot;Essex girl&quot; personality played off well against the quick wit of Vaughan, and together they recovered audience figures to record levels. One feature of Vaughan&#x27;s presentation was the way in which he frequently interacted with the various cameramen and technical people in the studio, turning some of them into popular characters in their own right. His ability to build a rapport with regulars from different walks of life such as Trevor Baylis, Mark Bright and Drusilla Beyfus, as well as the depth of knowledge he revealed in his Shed interviews, established him as something of a polymath. Also notable was that each programme finished with a zany situational competition in which Johnny revealed considerable talent as a character actor. In parallel with &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; Vaughan presented another film show, &quot;The Johnny Vaughan Film Show&quot;.

Van Outen left to pursue her acting career at the end of 1998. The partnership with replacement model Kelly Brook failed to reproduce the chemistry between Vaughan and Van Outen, and audience figures &quot;plummeted&quot;. Brook was replaced by Liza Tarbuck and Van Outen returned again as main female presenter in 2000 but the show was unrevivable. Vaughan and Van Outen left the show in January 2001 after both their contracts had run out.

==Move to the BBC==
In 2001, the BBC reportedly paid Vaughan £2.5 million to leave Channel 4. He transferred to the BBC to present a late-night talk show, &quot;Johnny Vaughan Tonight&quot; in the same vein of American shows by Johnny Carson and Jay Leno. Viewing figures were good (the show regularly received 2.5 – 3 million viewers a night) and commentators suggested that the format was best suited to the free-wheeling Vaughan. However, a highly promoted BBC Two sitcom vehicle &quot;&#x27;Orrible&quot;, which Vaughan wrote and acted in, was poorly received by the critics. The show lost 40% of its audience over its first three episodes and was not renewed for a second series.

In October 2003 he devised and produced and was the first presenter of BBC Radio Five Live&#x27;s &quot;Fighting Talk&quot;, a sport-related comedy show. Further television appearances ensued, when Vaughan tried a revival of his on screen relationship with Van Outen in 2004 in the BBC&#x27;s Saturday night family show &quot;Passport to Paradise&quot;, which lasted for one series. During this period at the BBC, Vaughan also co-hosted 12 episodes of &quot;Superstars (British TV programme)&quot;, a revival of the hugely popular sports competition which ran on British TV from 1973 to 1985.

==95.8 Capital FM==
On 2 April 2004, Vaughan moved to radio and returned to the &quot;zoo&quot; format, when he replaced Chris Tarrant as the presenter of &quot;Capital Breakfast&quot; on 95.8 Capital FM, which saw the listening figures for his show drop from over 1.3 million to 980,000 listeners, according to RAJAR statistics.

In January 2008, Vaughan was reunited with van Outen when she joined him on the breakfast show in a move to boost listening figures, but she left the show halfway through her contract in June 2008. In August 2008, van Outen was replaced by model Lisa Snowdon. The show rose in the ratings, reclaiming the top spot of London&#x27;s breakfast radio chart in October 2008, with an average weekly audience of 862,000 listeners. In 2010–11, his breakfast show had regular audiences in excess of 1 million. On 18 November 2011, Vaughan left &quot;Capital Breakfast&quot;, and was replaced by Dave Berry.

==talkSPORT &amp; Radio X==
In August 2013, it was announced Vaughan had signed for talkSPORT hosting a new show for Saturday morning from 11am to 1pm called the Warm Up alongside friends James Brown and Gavin Woods. The show looked ahead to the weekend&#x27;s football action and went head to head with Vaughan&#x27;s former show Fighting Talk on BBC Radio 5 Live. Alongside this role, he also covered for Colin Murray in his 10am1pm slot when he was unavailable. His last show on talkSPORT was on 19 September 2015 leaving talkSPORT to host the new drivetime show from 4pm to 7pm as part of the new weekday daytime lineup on Radio X.

==Other work==
Vaughan wrote the UK&#x27;s first &quot;dope opera&quot;, &quot;Top Buzzer&quot;, which aired in 2004 on MTV and later on Five. Vaughan has also been heavily involved with telethon charity drives such as &quot;Children in Need&quot;, &quot;Comic Relief&quot; and &quot;Sport Relief&quot;. In 2004 the BBC ran &quot;a search to find the nation&#x27;s best-loved sitcom&quot; with a format that aped that of the 100 Greatest Britons. One celebrity championed each of the top ten sitcoms, presenting an hour-long special on why their favourite was the best. Vaughan was the presenter of the segment on prison-based sitcom &quot;Porridge&quot;.

In 2005, Vaughan became the host of the American reality/game show &quot;My Kind of Town&quot; on ABC. The show was cancelled after four episodes. He was also featured in the 2005 film &quot;Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo&quot;, playing an awards ceremony host.

Vaughan presented the controversial hoax &quot;reality&quot; show &quot;Space Cadets&quot; for Channel 4. In June 2006, Vaughan appeared as a guest on &quot;TV Heaven, Telly Hell&quot;. He was a team captain on the Channel 4 comedy panel show &quot;Best of the Worst&quot; that also features team captain David Mitchell and chairman Alexander Armstrong.

In December 2006, Vaughan made a guest appearance on the BBC comedy panel game QI (Series D, Episode 10, &quot;Divination&quot;). Vaughan has his own television production company, &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot;. In 2009, he presented a Premier League Football DVD titled &quot;Johnny Vaughan&#x27;s Own Goals &amp; Gaffs III&quot;.

In 2011, Vaughan appeared in the TV show &quot;Mud Men&quot; on History Channel. Accompanied by Steve Brooker, he ventured out into the Thames shoreline in search of hidden artefacts and treasures.

During the London 2012 Olympics, Vaughan joined Absolute Radio to present the Olympic Drivetime show. As Absolute Radio was also the official station of the BT London Live concerts in Hyde Park, which were also held during the Games, Vaughan also participated in the on-stage presenting of the acts and interviews with Team GB athletes and medalists.

Vaughan participated in a 2018 episode of quiz show &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot;, reaching the final round alongside fellow Radio X DJ Toby Tarrant.

In 2023 Vaughan reunited with his former colleague Denise Van Outen to present an episode of &quot;Steph&#x27;s Packed Lunch&quot;.

==Personal life==
Vaughan married his long-term partner costume designer Antonia Davies in August 1999. The couple met when he was working in a video store as a teenager. Elvis Costello performed at their wedding. In 2003 they lived in Wandsworth Common, South London. Vaughan&#x27;s father-in-law was Nick Davies, once foreign editor of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. They had two children and a bulldog, and divorced in 2014.

In March 1999, as a result of his experience of prison Catholic chaplains, Vaughan was received into the Catholic Church at Westminster Cathedral. He is a supporter of Chelsea F.C.

In July 2008, he shaved his head to raise money for the Capital Radio charity, &quot;Help a London Child&quot;, of which he is an ambassador.

<text>Lieutenant Orr is a fictional character in the classic 1961 novel &quot;Catch-22&quot; by Joseph Heller. Orr is a World War II bomber pilot who shares a tent with his good friend, the protagonist of the novel, Yossarian. Described as &quot;a warm-hearted, simple-minded gnome,&quot; Orr is generally considered crazy. His most notable feature is repeatedly being shot down over water, but, until his final flight, always managing to survive along with his entire crew. On his final flight, perhaps two-thirds of the way through the novel, he is again shot down into the Mediterranean, and is lost at sea. Only in the last ten pages of the novel does Heller reveal that Orr&#x27;s crashes were part of an elaborate (and successful) plot to escape the war.

Orr is the only airman of the group to successfully get away by the end of the novel.

==Character sketch==

===Motivations===
Orr&#x27;s motivation throughout is to escape the squadron and the war. He is also known for being very mechanically adept and uses his skills to make his and Yossarian&#x27;s tent as comfortable as possible.
This is because Yossarian is his friend, and although it is Orr&#x27;s intent to escape, he wants to make the tent comfortable for Yossarian.

===Goals===
Orr attempts to escape the war in two main ways. His first goal is to get a prostitute to knock him unconscious, so that he can be grounded. When this fails, Orr plans to ditch in the sea and make his way to a neutral country where he can wait out the war. Orr practices this second goal by getting shot down every mission he flies, and so becomes an expert in ditching, without losing a single crewman.

Orr also has a goal of making his and Yossarian&#x27;s tent as comfortable as possible e.g. by installing a heating system for the tent in time for winter.

===Relationships and conflicts===
Orr is good friends with Yossarian and enjoys winding him up with his stories of crabapples and horse-chestnuts or about the prostitute that kept hitting him over the head. He tries to encourage Yossarian to fly with him, intimating that it would be to his advantage, but Yossarian refuses as he is scared of being shot down. It is not until Orr escapes to Sweden that Yossarian realises that Orr was trying to offer him an escape out of the war with him.

Orr seems to take offense at Appleby, who is patriotic and a conformist. Appleby is also a renowned table tennis player in the squadron, &quot;who won every game he started until the night Orr got tipsy on gin and juice and smashed open Appleby’s forehead with his paddle after Appleby had smashed back each of Orr’s first five serves. ... Pandemonium broke loose.&quot; While Orr is a small man, Appleby is large, strong and athletic, and so is able to get a hold of Orr and almost &quot;smite him dead&quot;. However, Yossarian intervened and &quot;took Orr away from him.&quot; Yossarian fights Appleby instead; this is the first instance in the novel of Yossarian&#x27;s protectiveness of Orr. The next day, Orr informs Yossarian that Appleby has &quot;flies in his eyes&quot;:

&quot;Oh, they&#x27;re there, all right,&quot; Orr had assured him about the flies in Appleby&#x27;s eyes after Yossarian&#x27;s fist fight with Appleby in the officers&#x27; club, &quot;although he probably doesn’t even know it. That&#x27;s why he can’t see things as they really are.&quot;
&quot;How come he doesn&#x27;t know it?’ inquired Yossarian.
&quot;Because he’s got flies in his eyes,&quot; Orr explained with exaggerated patience. &quot;How can he see he&#x27;s got flies in his eyes if he&#x27;s got flies in his eyes?&quot;

Everyone in the squadron presumes that Orr is a simpleton, as evidenced by his optimism, despite the increasing numbers of missions, and the fact that when he crashes his plane into the sea, M&amp;M Enterprises has stolen the cylinders from the life jackets: &quot;Orr hasn’t got brains enough to be unhappy.&quot; Yossarian says. However, he is eventually revealed to have had the clearest view of the absurdities of their situation through his carefully planned escape to Sweden. Although he has been shot down more times than anyone else in the unit (17), he continues to fly and does not appear afraid of the missions, and he is therefore assumed to be crazy. They do not know that this is part of his plan to escape the war.

Doc Daneeka uses Orr as an example, when explaining the grounding of the insane and “Catch-22.” Orr is insane for not requesting to be grounded, even though he is shot down every mission he flies. If he did request to be grounded he would be considered sane for realising the risks of continuing to fly. The “Catch-22” is that you can only be grounded if you are insane. But you must request it, and by requesting it you are considered sane.

===Epiphany===
In a conversation with Yossarian in their tent, Orr tries to hint at his reasons for being so obscure, why the prostitute was hitting him over the head and why Yossarian should fly with Orr. In the next mission Orr is lost at sea, and Yossarian believes that he is dead. Only later does Yossarian realize it was all part of a grand plan to escape the war to Sweden, which Orr was trying to encourage Yossarian to be a part of.

==Biographical summary==

===Prior story===
Apart from a brief explanation that Orr is &quot;from the wilderness outside New York City&quot;, there is no real detail of Orr&#x27;s past. We also do not learn his first name in the novel; in the mini-series, however, Milo Minderbinder introduces him as &quot;Ivor Orr&quot; (which sounds like &quot;either or&quot;).

===Actions in &quot;Catch-22&quot;===

====Improving the Tent====
Orr shares a tent with Yossarian, and is very mechanically adept, as he manages to make for them the most luxurious tent in the squadron. When working on small pieces for an oven stove in the tent, Yossarian sees his work as arduous and highly unnecessary as the pieces are too small for anything of real concern, yet at the end while using his stove, he realizes the intricate simplicity of improving the stove&#x27;s performance. Although this tinkering drives Yossarian mad, any idea of harming Orr is so absurd that Yossarian can&#x27;t follow through with it.

====Crab apples====
Orr has a bucktoothed smile and frequently puts crabapples or horse chestnuts in his cheeks and rubber balls in his hands. He constantly teases Yossarian asking him if he wants to know why, to which Yossarian invariably says &quot;yes&quot;. Orr never gives any straightforward explanation for this other than he wants big cheeks and to detract from the peculiarity of this he keeps rubber balls in his hands. As he explains the latter, &quot;Every time someone asked me why I was walking around with crab apples in my cheeks, I&#x27;d just open my hands and show them it was rubber balls I was walking around with, not crab apples, and that they were in my hands, not my cheeks. It was a good story. But I never knew if it got across or not, since it&#x27;s pretty tough to make people understand you when you&#x27;re talking to them with two crab apples in your cheeks.&quot;

This oddity is analogous to other absurd and ambiguous conversations in the novel, which are circular and end up having little or no significance. He uses this behaviour to draw Yossarian into circular arguments that never seem to be resolved and serve to only frustrate Yossarian (which amuses Orr who generally chortles at his cleverness).

====Incident with prostitute====
An incident with an unnamed prostitute in a hotel in Rome is a puzzling event in the novel, and is only explained to the reader at the end of the novel.

The whole apartment watches as the prostitute jumps up and down naked, and hits a giggling, equally naked Orr on the head with her heeled shoes. Each time she jumps and hit him, Orr giggles louder, making her even more angry. She then would jump even higher and hit him harder, causing him to giggle even more. The vicious cycle ends after fifteen to twenty minutes when she knocks him out cold with a good whack to his head, leaving him with a concussion &quot;that kept him out of combat for only twelve days.&quot;

Yossarian, on learning that Orr has escaped to Sweden, in the concluding pages of the novel, understands that she was hired by Orr as part of a plan to be discharged. Yossarian realises that the prostitute was hitting Orr on the head &quot;because he was paying her to, that&#x27;s why! But she wouldn&#x27;t hit him hard enough, so he had to row to Sweden.&quot; The incident was simply another of Orr&#x27;s plans to escape from the war.

===Plane crashes===
Orr (like Yossarian) has a firm grasp of his situation in the war effort. As the story unfolds between harrowing war scenes and more personable ones such as Orr and Yossarian meeting prostitutes in Rome, Orr more and more enunciates his guile and clever techniques to move toward his freedom from war. At first, his frequent airplane crashes seems to hint toward a clumsy, foolish pilot who has little knack and knowledge for his craft. In the concluding chapters, Orr purposefully crashes for two reasons: to throw off all of the commanding officers who would believe he met his demise and to learn where and how to crash in order to escape to Sweden. The generals, colonels, and other commanding officers in the higher echelons constantly and consistently appear to be vain and care only about their own careers. To expect that Orr could survive a crash would certainly fall out of their range of focus and would not create much of an uproar, especially because of Orr&#x27;s unfailing &quot;ability&quot; to crash. It is also paradoxical, in the classic way of the novel, that Orr has to crash his plane repeatedly - practising for the time that he will crash his plane.

Throughout the last ten chapters Yossarian along with Orr thinks diligently about crashing near a neutral country such as Switzerland or Sweden to be interned there for the rest of the war. Since heading directly toward one of the two countries would give the appearance of fleeing similar to AWOL, a more surreptitious and clandestine indirect path would work better. By practicing to crash, Orr learned how to do so in a fashion where he could escape as narrowly as possible to hint at death; those in higher power would simply wave it off and move on with their bureaucratic motives, leaving Orr to his especially spacious freedom. He used the crashes as practice for ocean survival techniques, as is evident when he and his crew members are in a life raft. He learns not only the physical but mental aspects as well, keeping himself jocular and humorous while on the seas to keep from getting bored or going mad. The news of this escape eventually reaches Yossarian while he is in hospital, causing him to undergo a revelation as to Orr&#x27;s motives about his actions and re-energizes him to keep on &quot;fighting the system&quot;. It is only then that he realises that Orr&#x27;s requests that Yossarian should fly with him was actually a scheme for them both to escape to Sweden.

==Adaptations in other media==
In Mike Nichols&#x27; 1970 film adaptation of the novel, Orr was played by Bob Balaban. He was played in Hulu&#x27;s 2019 mini-series by Graham Patrick Martin.

<text>The University of Madras is a public state university in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Established in 1857, it is one of the oldest and most prominent universities in India, incorporated by an act of the Legislative Council of India under the British government.

The university is the alma mater of five Presidents of India, including A. P. J. Abdul Kalam; three Chief Justices of the Supreme Court of India; two Indian physics Nobel laureates, CV Raman and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar; several notable mathematicians including Srinivasa Ramanujan and Abel Prize winner S. R. Srinivasa Varadhan; and Turing Award winner Raj Reddy among others.

The University of Madras is a collegiate research university and has six campuses in the city: Chepauk, Marina, Guindy, Taramani, Maduravoyal and Chetpet. It offers more than 230 courses under 87 academic departments of post-graduate teaching and research grouped under 18 schools, covering diverse areas such as sciences, social sciences, humanities, management and medicine along with 121 affiliated colleges and 53 approved research institutions. The university houses national centres for advanced research in nanotechnology, photonics and neurotoxicity. In addition, it has three &quot;Centres of Advanced Study&quot; in biophysics, botany and the Ramanujan Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics.

The National Assessment and Accreditation Council has conferred &#x27;five star&#x27; accreditation to the university in the first cycle, and subsequently with its highest A++ grade. The University of Madras has been given the status of &quot;university with potential for excellence (UPE)&quot; by the University Grants Commission. Madras University is also recognized among the 18 universities in India having the &#x27;Centre with Potential for Excellence in Particular Area (CPEPA)&#x27; with a focus on drug development and climate change.

==History==

The first-ever demand for higher education in Madras Presidency was given in a public address to Lord John Elphinstone, governor of Madras, signed by 70,000 residents when the Governor-in-Council was contemplating &quot;some effective and liberal measures for the establishment of an improved system of national education&quot;. This public petition, which was presented by the Advocate General Mr George Norton on 11 November 1839, pressed the need for an English college in the city of Madras. Pursuant to this, Lord Elphinstone evolved a plan for the establishment of a central collegiate institution or a &quot;university&quot;. This university had twin departments – a high school for the cultivation of English literature, regional language, philosophy and science, and a college for instruction in the higher branches of literature, philosophy and science.

The University Board was constituted in January 1840 with Mr George Norton as its president. This was the precursor of the present Presidency College, Chennai. A systematic educational policy for India was formulated 14 years later by Wood&#x27;s despatch, which pointed out the rationale for &quot;creating a properly articulated system of education from the primary school to the University.&quot; The dispatch recommended the establishment in the universities of professorships &quot;for the purposes of the delivery of lectures in various branches of learning including vernacular as well as classical languages&quot;. As a result, the University of Madras, organised on the model of the University of London, was incorporated on 5 September 1857 by an act of the Legislative Council of India.

The university progressed and expanded through the 19th century to span the whole of South India, giving birth to universities like Mysore University (1916), Osmania University (1918), Andhra University (1926), Annamalai University (1929), Travancore University (1937) presently University of Kerala, Sri Venkateswara University (1954), Madurai Kamaraj University (1966), Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (1971), Anna University (1978), Tamil University (1981), Bharathidasan University (1982), Bharathiar University (1982), Mother Teresa Women&#x27;s University (1984), Alagappa University (1985), Dr. M.G.R. Medical University (1989), Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (1989), Manonmaniam Sundaranar University (1990), Periyar University (1997), Dr. Ambedkar Law University (1996) and Thiruvalluvar University (2002).

In 1912 endowments were made to the university to establish departments of Indian History, Archaeology, Comparative Philology and Indian Economics. In that year the university had 17 departments, 30 teachers, and 69 research scholars. Later the research and teaching functions of the university were encouraged by the Sadler Commission and the gains of the university were consolidated by the enactment of the Madras University Act of 1923. About this time, the territorial ambit of the Madras University encompassed from Berhampur of Odisha in the North East, Trivandrum of Kerala in the South West, Bangalore and Mangalore of Karnataka in the West and Hyderabad of Andhra Pradesh in the North.

Between 1926 and 1939, the university published the comprehensive &quot;Tamil Lexicon&quot; dictionary, which is the first among the dictionaries published in any Indian language.

<text>A [[Peerage|peer]] of the realm is a member of the highest aristocratic social order outside the ruling dynasty of the kingdom.

Notable examples are:

* a member of the peerages in the United Kingdom, who is a hereditary peer or a life peer
* a member of the Peerage of France (from French noble style &quot;pair&quot; in monarchies), of a similar order, as used in 
** the Kingdom of France
** the Kingdom of Jerusalem (crusader state)
** the Monarchy of Canada: Canadian nobility in the Peerage of France
* nobility proper of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth who enjoyed hereditary &quot;paritas&quot;: those who would sit by hereditary right in Land Parliaments, or be Royal Electors, enjoy personal immunity, and the right to be judged only by the King&#x27;s Court or the Court of Peers; also the exclusive right to be granted State or Land dignities and titles. The Skartabelli who were middle-nobility in law were not peers, whilst noblemen who were not direct barons of the Crown but held land from other Lords were not peers &quot;de facto&quot; as they would not enjoy full noble privileges.
* a member of the Portuguese Chamber of Most Worthy Peers, upper house of the Cortes Gerais, during the constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Portugal.

<doc id="636331" wikidata="Q2335779" url="?curid=636331" title="Maltese alphabet">
<text>The Maltese alphabet is based on the Latin alphabet with the addition of some letters with diacritic marks and digraphs. It is used to write the Maltese language, which evolved from the otherwise extinct Siculo-Arabic dialect, as a result of 800 years of independent development. It contains 30 letters: 24 consonants and 6 vowels (a, e, i, o, u, ie).
There are two types of Maltese consonants:

* (sun consonants): &quot;ċ d n r s t x ż z&quot;
* (moon consonants): &quot;b f ġ g għ h ħ j k l m p q v w&quot;

==Samples==
In the alphabetic sequence &quot;c&quot; is identical either to &quot;k&quot; (in front of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;u&quot; or consonant or as the last letter of the word) or to &quot;z&quot; (in front of &quot;e&quot; or &quot;i&quot;). The letter &quot;y&quot; is identical to &quot;i&quot;.

==Older versions of the alphabet==


Before the standardisation of the Maltese alphabet, there were several ways of writing the sounds peculiar to Maltese, namely , , , , , , and .

 was formerly written as (in front of and , in Italian fashion). Vella used for . was used in other books during the 19th century. Rather than using a c with a cedilla, , Panzavecchia used a c with ogonek . &quot;A Short Grammar of the Maltese Language&quot; used for , in English fashion. However, the first appearance of the letter for its current sound was in 1822 in the first ever Maltese written gospel by Martin Cannolo instituting the modern .

 and , now written with and respectively, were formerly confused. When they were differentiated, was written as , , and (by Vassalli) as a mirrored Arabic/Syriac gimel resembling a sideways V. On the other hand, was more commonly written as or in English fashion. Vella used a with diaeresis, , but in 1843 reduced it to one dot. The first appearance for this letter was once again in the first Maltese Gospel by Martin Cannolo instituting yet again the modern .

Until the middle of the 19th century, two sounds which would merge into were differentiated in Maltese. These were variously represented as , , , and with two letters not represented in Unicode (they resembled an upside down U). Panzavecchia used a specially designed font with a curly . &quot;A Short Grammar of the Maltese Language&quot; used with a superscript Arabic ʿayn () to represent . itself was first used in &quot;Nuova guida alla conversazione italiana, inglese e maltese&quot;.

The letter had the most variations before being standardised in 1866. It was variously written as , and as a with various diacritics or curly modifications. Some of these symbols were used for and some for . None of these are present in Unicode. The letter was first used by Martin Cannolo in the same aforementioned script, although the capital was used later on (in 1845), where its lower case counterpart was a dotted h. 

 was written as , or as a modified u (not present in Unicode).

The sounds , (now represented with ) were traditionally written as or . Vassalli invented a special character similar to , just wider, and Panzavecchia used an ligature to represent and , in the Italian fashion. Interestingly, the first ever use of for was in the first ever Maltese document (that we know of) Il-Kantilena by Pietru Caxaro, which makes sense as he was of Spanish descent (hence the surname) and the Spanish language also used to use the same letter for that sound at the time.

 and (now represented with ) were formerly confused with, (now represented with ). When they were differentiated, and were written as , , or even . On the other hand, was written as , , , and .

Prior to 1900, was written as , as well as , and (in words derived from Italian and Latin).

Vassalli&#x27;s 1796 work contained several new letters to represent the sounds of the Maltese language, which included the invention of several ad-hoc letters as well as the importation of Cyrillic ge, che, sha, and ze. His alphabet is set out in full with modern-day equivalents where known:
A, a = a

B, b = b

T, t = t

D, d = d

E, e = e

F, f = f

[V, or a Syriac/Arabic gimel open to the right] = g

[Ч], ɥ = ċ

H, h = h

ȣ

Ө, ө

Y, y = j

Г = ġ

З, з

U = ħ

I, i = i

J, j = j

K, k = k

[I with a small c superimposed on it]

L, l = l

M, m = m

N, n = n

O, o = o

P, p = p

R, r = r

S, s = s

Ɯ, ɯ = x

V, v = v

U, u = u

W, w = w

Z, z = z

Ʒ, ʒ = ż

Æ, æ = final e

Five grave accented vowels are also used to indicate which syllable should be stressed: Àà, Èè, Ìì, Òò, and Ùù.

<text>Gordon James Ramsay (; born ) is a British celebrity chef, restaurateur, television presenter, and writer. His restaurant group, Gordon Ramsay Restaurants, was founded in 1997 and has been awarded 17 Michelin stars overall and currently holds eight. His signature restaurant, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea, London, which he founded, has held three Michelin stars since 2001 and is currently run by Chef Matt Abé. After rising to fame on the British television miniseries &quot;Boiling Point&quot; in 1999, Ramsay became one of the best-known and most influential chefs in the world.

Ramsay&#x27;s television persona is defined by his fiery temper, aggressive behaviour, strict demeanour, and frequent use of profanity, while making blunt, critical, and controversial comments, including insults and sardonic wisecracks about contestants and their cooking abilities. He combines activities in the television, film, hospitality and food industries, and has promoted and hired various chefs who have apprenticed under his wing. He is known for presenting television programmes about competitive cookery and food, such as the British series &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; (2004), &quot;Ramsay&#x27;s Kitchen Nightmares&quot; (2004–2009, 2014), and &quot;The F Word&quot; (2005–2010), with &quot;Kitchen Nightmares&quot; winning the 2005 British Academy Television Award for Best Feature, and the American versions of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; (2005–present), &quot;Kitchen Nightmares&quot; (2007–present), &quot;MasterChef&quot; (2010–present), and &quot;MasterChef Junior&quot; (2013–present), as well as &quot;Hotel Hell&quot; (2012–2016), &quot;Gordon Behind Bars&quot; (2012), &quot;Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s 24 Hours to Hell and Back&quot; (2018–2020), and &quot;Next Level Chef&quot; (2022–present).

Ramsay was appointed an OBE by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2006 New Year Honours list for services to the hospitality industry. He was named the top chef in the UK at the 2000 Catey Awards, and in July 2006 he won the Catey for Independent Restaurateur of the Year, becoming the third person to win three Catey Awards. &quot;Forbes&quot; listed his 2020 earnings at US $70 million and ranked him at No.19 on its list of the highest-earning celebrities.

==Early life==
Gordon James Ramsay was born in Johnstone, Scotland, on 8 November 1966, the son of Helen (née Cosgrove), a nurse, and Gordon James Sr., who worked as a swimming pool manager, welder, and shopkeeper. He has an older sister, a younger brother, and a younger sister. When he was nine years old, he moved with his family to England and grew up in the Bishopton area of Stratford-upon-Avon. He has described his early life as &quot;hopelessly itinerant&quot; and said his family moved constantly owing to the aspirations and failures of his father, who was an occasionally violent alcoholic; Ramsay described him as a &quot;hard-drinking womaniser&quot;. In his autobiography, he revealed that his father abused and neglected the children and his mother. He worked as a pot washer in a local Indian restaurant where his sister was a waitress. He had hoped to become a footballer and was first chosen to play under-14 football at the age of 12, but his early footballing career was marked by injuries; after a serious knee injury, he was forced to give it up. At the age of 16, he moved out of the family home and into an apartment in Banbury.

==Early cooking career==
Ramsay&#x27;s interest in cooking began in his teenage years; rather than be known as &quot;the football player with the gammy knee&quot;, he decided to pay more serious attention to his culinary education at age 19. Ramsay enrolled at North Oxfordshire Technical College, sponsored by the Rotarians, to study hotel management. He described his decision to enter catering college as &quot;a complete accident&quot;.

In the mid-1980s, Ramsay worked as a commis chef at the Wroxton House Hotel. He ran the kitchen and 60-seat dining room at the Wickham Arms until he quit after having sex with the owner&#x27;s wife. Ramsay then moved to London, where he worked in a series of restaurants until being inspired to work for Marco Pierre White at Harveys.

After working at Harveys for two years and ten months, Ramsay, tired of &quot;the rages and the bullying and violence&quot;, decided that the way to further advance his career was to study French cuisine. White discouraged Ramsay from taking a job in Paris, instead encouraging him to work for Albert Roux at Le Gavroche in Mayfair. Ramsay decided to take his advice, and there, Ramsay met Jean-Claude Breton, who later became his &quot;maître d&#x27;hôtel&quot; at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. After Ramsay worked at Le Gavroche for a year, Roux invited him to work with him at Hotel Diva, a ski resort in the French Alps, as his number two. From there, a 23-year-old Ramsay moved to Paris to work with Guy Savoy and Joël Robuchon, both Michelin-starred chefs. He continued his training in France for three years, before giving in to the physical and mental stress of the kitchens and taking a year to work as a personal chef on the private yacht &quot;Idlewild&quot;, based in Bermuda. The role on the boat saw him travel to Sicily and Sardinia, Italy, and learn about Italian cuisine.

==Head chef==

Upon his return to London in 1993, Ramsay was offered the position of head chef, under chef-patron Pierre Koffmann, at the three-Michelin-starred La Tante Claire in Chelsea. Shortly thereafter, Marco Pierre White reentered his life, offering to set him up with a head chef position and 10% share in the Rossmore, owned by White&#x27;s business partners. The restaurant was renamed Aubergine and won its first Michelin star 14 months later. In 1997, Aubergine won its second Michelin star. A dispute with Ramsay&#x27;s business owners, who wanted to turn Aubergine into a chain, and Ramsay&#x27;s dream of running his own restaurant led to his leaving the partnership in July 1998. He has described the decision to set out on his own as &quot;the most important day of my entire cooking career; the most important decision of my life&quot;.

In 1998, Ramsay opened his own restaurant in Chelsea, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, with the help of his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, and his former colleagues at Aubergine. The restaurant gained its third Michelin star in 2001, making Ramsay the first Scot to achieve that feat. In 2011, &quot;The Good Food Guide&quot; named Restaurant Gordon Ramsay the second best restaurant in the UK, behind the Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire.
After establishing his first restaurant, Ramsay&#x27;s empire expanded rapidly. He next opened Pétrus, then Amaryllis in Glasgow (which he was later forced to close), and later Gordon Ramsay at Claridge&#x27;s. He hired his friend and maître d&#x27;hôtel Jean-Philippe Susilovic, who works at Pétrus and also appears on Ramsay&#x27;s US television programme &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;. Restaurants at the Dubai Creek and Connaught hotels followed, the latter branded with his protegee Angela Hartnett&#x27;s name. Ramsay has opened restaurants outside the UK, beginning with Verre in Dubai. Two restaurants, Gordon Ramsay at Conrad Tokyo and Cerise by Gordon Ramsay, both opened in Tokyo in 2005. In November 2006, Gordon Ramsay at the London opened in New York City, winning top newcomer in the city&#x27;s coveted Zagat guide, despite mixed reviews from professional critics.

In 2007, Ramsay opened his first restaurant in Ireland, Gordon Ramsay at Powerscourt, at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Powerscourt, County Wicklow. This restaurant closed in 2013. In May 2008, he opened his first restaurant in the Western US, in The London West Hollywood Hotel (formerly the Bel-Age Hotel) on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. The contract expired in 2015, closing the restaurant.

On 9 August 2011, Ramsay opened his first Canadian restaurant, Laurier Gordon Ramsay (at the former Rotisserie Laurier BBQ) in Montreal. In February 2012, Danny Lavy, the owner of the restaurant, announced the restaurant was disassociating itself from Ramsay, citing a lack of involvement and understanding on Ramsay&#x27;s part. The restaurant closed in 2013.

==Awards==
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, located at Royal Hospital Road, London, was voted Top Restaurant in the UK in the London Zagat Survey in 2001 and was awarded its third Michelin star. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2006 New Year Honours list for services to the hospitality industry, but almost missed the award ceremony when his plane was delayed.

In July 2006, Ramsay won the Catey award for &quot;Independent Restaurateur of the Year&quot;, becoming only the third person to have won three Catey awards. Ramsay&#x27;s two previous Catey awards were in 1995 (Newcomer of the Year) and 2000 (Chef of the Year). The other two triple-winners are Michel Roux and Jacquie Pern. In September 2006, he was named as the most influential person in the UK hospitality industry in the annual Caterersearch 100 list, published by &quot;Caterer and Hotelkeeper&quot; magazine. He overtook Jamie Oliver, who had been top of the list in 2005. Also in 2006, Ramsay was nominated as a candidate for Rector of the University of St Andrews, but lost at the polls to Simon Pepper.

Ramsay&#x27;s flagship restaurant, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, was voted London&#x27;s top restaurant in &quot;Harden&#x27;s&quot; for eight years, but in 2008 was placed below Pétrus, a restaurant run by former protégé Marcus Wareing. In January 2013, Ramsay was inducted into the Culinary Hall of Fame.

On 14 June 2017, Ramsay set a new Guinness World Record for the &#x27;Fastest time to fillet a 10 lb fish&#x27;, achieving the record in one minute and five seconds. On 16 August 2017, Ramsay set a &#x27;Guinness World Record for the Longest Pasta Sheet Rolled in 60 Seconds&#x27;, which measured 1.45 metres. In June 2022, he was recognised by the International Hospitality Institute as one of the 100 Most Powerful People in Global Hospitality. On 11 May 2023, Ramsay along with Nick DiGiovanni set the Guinness World Record for the largest Beef Wellington. It came in at a weight of 25.76 kg (56.79 lb). It also measured 2 ft 5 inches long by 13 inches wide and 8 inches tall.

==Gordon Ramsay Holdings==
All of Ramsay&#x27;s business interests (restaurants, media, consultancy) are held in the company Gordon Ramsay Holdings Limited, which was run in partnership with his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, and incorporated on 29 October 1997. Ramsay owns a 69% stake, valued at £67 million in 2007. Whereas previous ventures acted as a combined consultant/brand, in November 2006 Ramsay announced plans to create three restaurants in the United States. These opened in 2006/2007 at the London Hotel in Manhattan, in October 2006, the Cielo in Boca Raton, Florida, and at the London Hotel in West Hollywood, California. Ramsay acts as a consultant to numerous catering organisations. In 2005 he was recruited by Singapore Airlines as one of its &quot;International Culinary Panel&quot; consultants.

In late 2006, Gordon Ramsay Holdings purchased three London pubs, which were converted into gastropubs. These are: The Narrow in Limehouse, which opened in March 2007, the Devonshire in Chiswick, which opened in October 2007 and The Warrington in Maida Vale, which opened in February 2008. Both The Devonshire and The Warrington were sold in 2011. In May 2008, it was confirmed that Ramsay&#x27;s protege of 15 years, Marcus Wareing, was going solo, having opened and operated Pétrus at The Berkeley Hotel on behalf of Gordon Ramsay Holdings since 2003. With the name Pétrus owned by Gordon Ramsay Holdings, industry sources suggested it was likely to transfer to another restaurant in the group with the former La Noisette site identified as the most likely. In April 2010, Jason Atherton, executive chef of Maze restaurants worldwide, resigned to open his own venue in Mayfair.

On 19 October 2010, the company Gordon Ramsay Holdings Limited announced that Chris Hutcheson had left his position as CEO. Shortly afterwards, Ramsay released a letter to the press describing how he had unravelled the &quot;manipulative&quot; Hutcheson&#x27;s &quot;complex life&quot; after having had him followed by a private detective. His father-in-law&#x27;s &quot;away days,&quot; wrote Ramsay, &quot;were rarely what I thought they were.&quot; Company accounts show Hutcheson borrowed up to £1.5 million from Gordon Ramsay Holdings, though Hutcheson says he reported the borrowings to the company and paid the money back. Hutcheson said he had been &quot;vaporised&quot; and subjected to a &quot;public hanging&quot; by Ramsay, whom he described as a friendless egotist. In April 2017, Hutcheson pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to hack into the computers of Gordon Ramsay Holdings Limited.

In October 2012, Ramsay opened The Fat Cow in Los Angeles at The Grove, a shopping area that is also popular with tourists. Ramsay explained his intention for the Fat Cow in a press release to signify the opening of the venue: &quot;The concept for The Fat Cow came from my desire to have a neighbourhood restaurant that you could go to all the time to just relax and enjoy a terrific meal.&quot; The Fat Cow closed in 2014 amid legal issues. That year also saw the opening of Gordon Ramsay Steak in Las Vegas. The steakhouse concept has since expanded to other locations including the Horseshoe Casino Lake Charles, LA; Atlantic City, and Baltimore, with an announced location due in Vancouver in 2024.

In partnership with footballer David Beckham, Ramsay opened the Union Street Café in the Southwark district of London, UK in September 2013. The Italian cuisine of the Union Street Café, with a menu that revolved on a daily basis, was overseen by Chef Davide Degiovanni. The Union Street Café&#x27;s location in Southwark was taken over in 2020–21 by two other Gordon Ramsay restaurants: Street Pizza, and Bread Street Kitchen &amp; Bar. In December 2012, the Las Vegas opening of Gordon Ramsay Burger occurred. Other locations of the gourmet hamburger dining establishment would open up in the 2020s, Notably in Chicago, Boston, Seoul, and at Harrods Department Store in London. 

In October 2013, the Gordon Ramsay at The London restaurant in New York lost its two Michelin stars owing to issues encountered by the Michelin reviewers. The guide&#x27;s director Michael Ellis stated that he was served &quot;some very erratic meals&quot; and also experienced &quot;issues with consistency.&quot; The loss followed the closure of another of Ramsay&#x27;s restaurants, Gordon Ramsay at Claridge&#x27;s, in June 2013. In January 2018, Ramsay opened his first location of Gordon Ramsay Hell&#x27;s Kitchen restaurants, based on the television show. After that site opened on the Las Vegas Strip, six other locations have either been opened or announced, with one in Dubai and the others in the United States.

On 17 April 2018, Ramsay&#x27;s first &quot;Street Pizza&quot; opened, situated in the downstairs area of his One New Change &quot;Bread Street Kitchen&quot; offering &quot;bottomless&quot; pizza. The second &quot;Street Pizza&quot; was opened at the chef&#x27;s &quot;York and Albany&quot; restaurant, with further locations opening elsewhere later on in London, Dubai, and the USA. On 26 June 2019, Chloe Sorvino from &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine reported that Ramsay had struck a $100 million deal with Lion Capital, a private equity firm headquartered in London. Together they formed a subsidiary of the Gordon Ramsay Restaurant group, with Ramsay and Lion each taking 50% ownership, naming it Gordon Ramsay North America (GRNA), and originally intended to open 100 restaurants in the USA by 2024. Those plans were slowed down by the COVID-19 pandemic: in December 2021 GRNA CEO Norman Abdallah stated in a new interview that their updated strategy was to open 75 new company-owned locations across the United States between 2022 and 2026.

On 24 March 2020, Ramsay laid off more than 500 staff in the UK after a number of Ramsay&#x27;s restaurants had to close temporarily under the coronavirus lockdown. Ramsay, whose personal net income was estimated to be US$63 million in 2019 by &quot;Forbes&quot;, was criticised for the lay-offs. 

On 3 December 2020, Ramsay&#x27;s first &quot;Street Burger&quot; opened, in the St. Paul&#x27;s area of London. In March 2021, Ramsay launched his own brand of California wines; produced in collaboration with Master Sommelier Chris Miller and International Wine Expert Nick Dumergue at Seabold Cellars in Monterey, California. The Gordon Ramsay Academy, a cookery school, opened in Woking, Surrey, in September 2021.

On 11 October 2023 Ramsay opened his first restaurant in Macao, &quot;Gordon Ramsay Pub &amp; Grill&quot;, at the new &quot;The Londoner Macao&quot; hotel and casino (formerly the Sands Cotai Central).

The Gordon Ramsay Bar &amp; Grill Philippines opened in Newport World Resorts in August 2024.

==Television==
Ramsay&#x27;s first documented role in television was in two fly-on-the-kitchen-wall documentaries: &quot;Boiling Point&quot; (1999) and &quot;Beyond Boiling Point&quot; (2000), but he had appeared previously as a judge on a MasterChef-like series for young catering students in 1997, with his then restaurant partner. Ramsay appeared on series three of &quot;Faking It&quot; in 2001, helping the prospective chef, a burger flipper named Ed Devlin, learn the trade. This episode won the 2001 BAFTA for &quot;Best Factual TV Moment.&quot;

In 2004, Ramsay appeared in two British television series. &quot;Ramsay&#x27;s Kitchen Nightmares&quot; aired on Channel 4 and saw the chef troubleshooting failing restaurants over one week. This series ran its fifth series in 2007. &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, a reality show which aired on ITV1, saw Ramsay attempt to train ten British celebrities to be chefs, as they ran a restaurant on Brick Lane in the East End of London, which opened to the public for the two-week duration of the show. Although he was the creator of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, Ramsay only starred in the first series, as he signed a four-year contract with Channel 4, ruling out any possibility of him appearing on future episodes of the ITV-produced show.

In May 2005, the Fox network introduced Ramsay to American audiences in an American version of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; produced by Granada Entertainment and A. Smith &amp; Co. The show follows a similar premise to the original British series, showcasing Ramsay&#x27;s perfectionism and infamously short temper. Ramsay had also hosted an American version of &quot;Kitchen Nightmares&quot;, which premiered on Fox on 19 September 2007. On 23 June 2014, Ramsay announced he was ending the series. In June 2018, &quot;Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s 24 Hours to Hell and Back&quot;, a new series with a premise much like &quot;Kitchen Nightmares&quot; but a shorter timeline, premiered on Fox.

Ramsay has presented five series of a food-based magazine programme titled &quot;The F Word&quot;; it launched on Channel 4 on 27 October 2005. The show is organised around several key recurring features, notably a brigade competition, a guest cook competition, a food-related investigative report, and a series-long project of raising animals to be served in the finale. The guest cook (usually a celebrity) prepares a dish of their own choosing and places it in competition against a similar dish submitted by Ramsay. The dishes are judged by diners who are unaware of who cooked which dish and, if the guest wins (as they have on numerous occasions), their dish is served at Ramsay&#x27;s restaurant. The American version premiered on 31 May 2017 on Fox.

In July 2006, Channel 4 announced that it had re-signed Ramsay to an exclusive four-year deal at the network, running until July 2011. The series became one of the highest rated shows aired on Channel 4 each week. During one episode of &quot;The F Word&quot;, Ramsay cooked in Doncaster Prison in Marshgate for its inmates. The chef was so impressed by the speed at which a prisoner, Kieron Tarff, chopped vegetables that he offered him a job at his restaurant following his release in 2007.

In 2010, Ramsay served as a producer and judge on the American version of &quot;MasterChef&quot;. (A second season of the show began in June 2011, again starring Ramsay.) On that same show, he was joined by culinary judges Graham Elliot and Joe Bastianich. He starred in a travelogue about his visit to India, &quot;Gordon&#x27;s Great Escape&quot; followed by a series set in Asia. He hosted the series &quot;Ramsay&#x27;s Best Restaurant&quot;, which was the first British series by Ramsay&#x27;s own production company, One Potato Two Potato.

Ramsay joined several other celebrity chefs in the 2010 series, &quot;The Big Fish Fight&quot;, where he, along with fellow chef Jamie Oliver and a few others, spent time on a trawler boat to raise awareness about the discarding of hundreds of thousands of sea fish. In March 2012, Fox announced the coming of Ramsay&#x27;s fourth series for the Fox network, &quot;Hotel Hell&quot;; the series is similar to &quot;Kitchen Nightmares&quot;, except that it focuses on struggling hotels, motels, and other lodging establishments in the United States. Originally slated for debut 6 April 2012 and 4 June 2012, the series debuted 13 August 2012. In August 2021, he signed a deal with Fox.

===Guest appearances===
In September 2005, Ramsay, along with Jamie Oliver, Heston Blumenthal, Wolfgang Puck, and Sanjeev Kapoor, were featured in CNN International&#x27;s &quot;Quest&quot;, in which Richard Quest stepped into the shoes of celebrity chefs. In 2006 and 2008, Ramsay took part in a television series for ITV, following the lead-up to &quot;Soccer Aid&quot;, a celebrity charity football match, in which he played only the first half, nursing an injury picked up in training. Ramsay captained the Rest of the World XI against an England XI captained by Robbie Williams.
During his second appearance on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot;, he stated that his current cars were a Ferrari F430 and a Range Rover Sport Supercharged, the latter replacing the Bentley Continental GT he previously owned. On 14 May 2006, he appeared on &quot;Top Gear&quot; in the &quot;Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car&quot; segment. Ramsay held the top spot on &quot;Top Gear&quot;&#x27;s celebrity leader board, with a lap time of 1.46.38 until overtaken by Simon Cowell.

Ramsay starred in part of a National Blood Service &quot;Give Blood&quot; television advertisement in England, in which he said that he would have died from a ruptured spleen had it not have been for another person&#x27;s blood donation. On 13 October 2006, he was guest host on the first episode of the BBC&#x27;s comedy panel show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;&#x27;s 32nd series. On 27 December 2007, Ramsay appeared in the &quot;Extras&quot; Christmas special.

In January 2008, Ramsay also guest featured on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack&quot; as the &quot;Big Brother&quot; housemates took part in his &quot;Cookalong Live&quot; television show. Gordon spoke directly to the &quot;Big Brother&quot; House via the house plasma screens, regularly checking on the progress of the contestants. In 2011, during the results show of &quot;American Idol&quot;, footage of the top 5 contestants taking on a challenge of cooking with Gordon Ramsay was shown. The Top 5 were given 10 minutes to make the best omelettes.

In November 2011, Ramsay appeared on the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Food Wife&quot;. In February 2017, Ramsay made a guest appearance on &quot;New Girl&quot; episode &quot;Operation: Bobcat&quot;. Ramsay made an appearance on 11 December 2017 broadcast of &quot;Please Take Care of My Refrigerator&quot;, a South Korean reality television show on JTBC. In November, Ramsay drew criticism for appearing as a brand ambassador for the mass-produced Korean beer Cass; Ramsay defended it as unpretentious and affordable. Ramsay voices the character Bolton Gramercy in &quot;Big Hero 6: The Series&quot;. The character, a chef with a fiery temper, is loosely based on him.

===Legal proceedings===
In 1998, following Ramsay&#x27;s resignation from the Aubergine, A-Z restaurants sued him for £1 million citing lost revenue and breach of contract, but eventually settled out of court. In June 2006, Ramsay won a High Court case against the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; newspaper, in which Victor Lewis Smith had alleged, after reports from previous owner Sue Ray, that scenes and the general condition of Bonaparte&#x27;s had been faked for &quot;Ramsay&#x27;s Kitchen Nightmares&quot;. Ramsay was awarded £75,000 plus costs. Ramsay said at the time: &quot;I won&#x27;t let people write anything they want to about me. We have never done anything in a cynical fake way.&quot;

In June 2007, Ramsay&#x27;s show was sued by the terminated general manager (Martin Hyde) of the New York restaurant Purnima (Dillon&#x27;s), who also alleged fakery. Hyde had quit his position at the restaurant during the show, when Ramsay suggested that the owner hire top Indian chef Vikas Khanna as the consultant chef for Purnima. The lawsuit alleged that &quot;unknown to the viewing audience, some or all of &quot;Kitchen Nightmares&quot; are fake and the so-called &#x27;problems uncovered and solved&#x27; by Ramsay are, for the most part, created by Ramsay and his staff for the purpose of making it appear that Ramsay is improving the restaurant.&quot; In August 2007, the case was dismissed voluntarily and ordered into arbitration as stipulated in their contract. On 21 March 2012, Ramsay filed a $2.7 million lawsuit against his former partners of his restaurant in Montreal, Quebec, the Laurier Gordon Ramsay (since renamed The Laurier 1936), over lost licensing fees and defamatory statements made against him. On 16 April 2013, just over a year later, Laurier 1936 closed.

In January 2014, Ramsay lost a high court case in relation to the York &amp; Albany pub. Ramsay claimed that his father-in-law had misused a &quot;ghost writing&quot; machine to make Ramsay a personal guarantor for the £640,000 annual rent of that pub. Ramsay tried to nullify the 25-year lease, signed in 2007. The judge said that Ramsay had known about the guarantee beforehand but that he had total trust in his father-in-law, Christopher Hutcheson, and left the deal to him. The judge dismissed the case and ordered Ramsay to pay all legal costs and outstanding monies, in total more than one million pounds. In May 2022, A New York Superior Court judge ended an eight-year legal battle between Gordon Ramsay and his former business partner at The Fat Cow Gordon Ramsay restaurant in Los Angeles, Rowan Seibel, ruling that Gordon Ramsay should be paid $4.5 million (£3.6 million) in damages and court fee coverage.

===Personality===
Ramsay&#x27;s reputation is built upon his goal of culinary perfection, which is associated with winning three Michelin stars. His mentor, Marco Pierre White, noted that he is highly competitive. Since the airing of &quot;Boiling Point&quot;, which followed Ramsay&#x27;s quest of earning three Michelin stars, the chef has also become infamous for his fiery temper and use of expletives. Ramsay once famously ejected food critic A. A. Gill, whose dining companion was Joan Collins, from his restaurant, leading Gill to state that &quot;Ramsay is a wonderful chef, just a really second-rate human being.&quot; Ramsay admitted in his autobiography that he did not mind if Gill insulted his food, but a personal insult he was not going to stand for. Ramsay has also had confrontations with his kitchen staff, including one incident that resulted in the pastry chef calling the police. A 2005 interview reported Ramsay had retained 85% of his staff since 1993. Ramsay attributes his management style to the influence of previous mentors, notably chefs Marco Pierre White and Guy Savoy, and his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson.

Ramsay&#x27;s ferocious temper has contributed to his media appeal in both the United Kingdom and the United States, where his programmes are produced. MSN Careers featured an article about television&#x27;s worst bosses, which listed Ramsay as the only non-fictional boss. They cited his frequent loss of his temper and his harsh critiques, notably when he picks on something other than cooking ability, such as calling someone a &quot;chunky monkey&quot;. Although Ramsay often mocks the French, one of his most trusted maîtres d&#x27;hôtel, Jean-Baptiste Requien (Royal Hospital Road), is French and Ramsay also speaks fluent French from his time in Paris. As of 2023, one of his final goals as a chef and restaurateur is to earn the third Michelin Star for Le Pressoir d&#x27;Argent, a French restaurant in France.

In November 2007, Ramsay installed 29-year-old Clare Smyth as head chef at his three-Michelin-starred flagship restaurant on Royal Hospital Road. Smyth is the second high-profile appointment of a female chef by Ramsay, after Angela Hartnett. Smyth was the first three-Michelin-starred woman; she moved on to start her own restaurant in 2017. Ramsay has been criticised for his frequent use of strong language on his programmes, first by British celebrity cook Delia Smith, then, in relation to &quot;Ramsay&#x27;s Kitchen Nightmares&quot;, by Australian Senator Cory Bernardi, who introduced a motion in the Senate to investigate broadcast standards as a result. In his autobiography, Ramsay himself said he was unaware of the extent of his swearing until he watched an episode of &quot;Boiling Point&quot;. While he stated he did not have a problem with it, &quot;Mum was appalled&quot;.

On 5 June 2009, Ramsay started trading insults with Australian &quot;A Current Affair&quot; journalist Tracy Grimshaw. The day after his interview, he was a guest feature at the Melbourne Food and Wine festival. While doing his display, he allegedly insulted Grimshaw and made insinuations about her sexuality. Grimshaw responded the next day, calling Ramsay an &quot;arrogant, narcissist bully.&quot; Ramsay eventually apologised, stating that his behaviour &quot;was a joke&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; included him in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time. Ramsay has also acted as a judge on &quot;MasterChef Junior&quot; since 2013; in contrast to his interaction with adults, Ramsay states that he takes a more sensitive attitude when working with the underage contestants.

===Food views===
Ramsay has previously expressed a dislike for vegetarianism and veganism. In the first episode of the second series of &quot;Ramsay&#x27;s Kitchen Nightmares&quot; (2005), he offered pizza to a vegetarian and said it was vegetarian. After he took a bite, Ramsay said that it contained ham, laughing and asked if he wanted more. In 2003, when asked for his most recent lie, he said &quot;To a table of vegetarians who had artichoke soup. I told them it was made with vegetable stock when it was chicken stock.&quot; In a 2007 interview, he joked: &quot;My biggest nightmare would be if the kids ever came up to me and said &#x27;Dad, I&#x27;m a vegetarian.&#x27; Then I would sit them on the fence and electrocute them.&quot; In 2016, when asked on Twitter whether he was allergic to anything, he wrote &quot;Vegans&quot; and followed up with: &quot;It&#x27;s a joke jack it&#x27;s not vegans! It&#x27;s vegetarians&quot;.

In 2006, on the second series of &quot;The F Word&quot;, Ramsay showed a softened stance on vegetarianism after learning about intensive pig farming practices, including castration and tail docking, while letting two young family piglets live in an intensive farm. On the programme, Ramsay commented: &quot;It&#x27;s enough to make anyone turn fucking vegetarian, for God&#x27;s sake. And I&#x27;ve always sort of knocked vegetarians and vegans for missing out on the most amazing flavour you can get from meat. But you can see why so many people change instantly&quot;. In 2019, he launched a vegan menu at his restaurants for Veganuary, and introduced more vegan items to his restaurants, such as a vegan roast. In 2022, on an episode of &quot;Master Chef: Back to Win&quot;, Ramsay said, &quot;After all these years, I can finally admit, that I actually love vegan food.&quot;

===Other chefs===

He was a head judge of &quot;MasterChef USA&quot; when Nick DiGiovanni came third place in season 10. On 11 May 2023, DiGiovanni, alongside Gordon Ramsay, broke the Guinness World Record for the largest beef Wellington, which weighed 25.76 kilograms (56.79 pounds). This was DiGiovanni&#x27;s 8th Guinness World Record and was broken in partnership with celebrity chefs: Max the Meat Guy, Guga Foods and The Golden Balance.

===Eating and exercising habits===
Ramsay said in 2016 that he exercised semi-competitively for his general well-being. He said he had seen overweight and unfit chefs collapse or become unable to move quickly around the kitchen. He often competes in Ironman events, marathons, and triathlons. Ramsay also eats very little per meal and prefers to graze throughout the day, partly due to the habit he built up as a judge and chef and also because of his busy schedule. He has a black belt in karate. Ramsay told Joe Wicks that cycling had improved his physical and mental health, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Personal life==

===Family===
Ramsay married Tana Hutcheson, a Montessori-trained schoolteacher, in 1996. They divide their time between Los Angeles and the Wandsworth Common area of London, and have six children. Tilly Ramsay is a television chef and presenter, Megan works with the Metropolitan Police as of 2023, Jack is a Royal Marines commando, and Holly is a fashion designer and blogger.

Until 2010, Ramsay&#x27;s father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, was responsible for the business operations of Ramsay&#x27;s restaurant empire. On 7 June 2017, Hutcheson was jailed for six months for conspiring to hack a computer system relating to the Ramsays&#x27; business interests. Hutcheson was accused, along with his sons, of accessing company systems almost 2,000 times between 23 October 2010 and 31 March 2011. 

Ramsay has three houses in Cornwall that are collectively worth an estimated £11 million: a £4 million mansion in Trebetherick, a £4.4 million property in Rock, and a £2 million Grade II listed property in Fowey. In August 2020, the Fowey property was put on sale for £2.75 million.

=== Car collection ===
Ramsay is a car enthusiast with a love for Ferrari. He maintains a sizeable car collection in the UK which includes the following:

* Ferrari LaFerrari painted in Grigio Ferro
* Ferrari LaFerrari Aperta painted in Bianco Italia
* Ferrari F12tdf painted in Bianco Italia
* Ferrari Monza SP2 painted in Nero Daytona
* Ferrari 488 Spider
* Ferrari 488 Pista
* Ferrari 812 Superfast
* Ferrari 575 Superamerica painted in Giallo Modena
* Aston Martin DBS Superleggera
* McLaren Senna in exposed carbon fibre and yellow accents
* McLaren 675LT Spider painted in Chicane Grey
* Porsche 918 Spyder painted in Sapphire Blue Metallic
* BAC Mono

Ramsay displayed his collection in a video posted to his YouTube channel filmed at Brands Hatch.

===Charity work===
Ramsay has been involved in a series of charitable events and organisations. He fulfilled his aim of finishing 10 marathons in 10 years by running his 10th consecutive London Marathon on 26 April 2009, sponsoring the Scottish Spina Bifida Association. Ramsay has been Honorary Patron of the Scottish Spina Bifida Association since 2004, and in 2005 he launched The Gordon Ramsay &quot;Buy a Brick&quot; appeal to help the organisation raise funds to build a new Family Support Centre and Head Office in Glasgow. In 2006, he launched a new appeal to help the charity raise the funds required to continue to run the support centre: &quot;What&#x27;s your favourite &#x27;F&#x27; Word? Gordon&#x27;s is Fundraising.&quot; In November 2007, Ramsay hosted a St Andrew&#x27;s Day Gala Dinner at Stirling Castle in aid of the Association and has now made this fundraising Gala Dinner an annual event.

During March 2005, Ramsay teamed up with Indian chef Madhur Jaffrey to help the VSO, an international development charity group, to support its &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; event. The charity hoped to raise £100,000 for VSO&#x27;s work in HIV and AIDS in India. The Ramsays were the first couple to become ambassadors for the women&#x27;s charity Women&#x27;s Aid in 2005. The couple ran the Flora Families marathon to support Women&#x27;s Aid. In 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014, Ramsay took part in the biennial charity event Soccer Aid to raise money for UNICEF. On 6 June 2010 he played for the Rest of the World team alongside former professional footballers Zinedine Zidane and Luís Figo as well as Hollywood actors Woody Harrelson, Mike Myers, and Michael Sheen. The match took place at Old Trafford in Manchester and was won by the Rest of the World for the first time, the winning penalty scored by Harrelson in the shoot-out. On 28 August 2020, the media reported that Ramsay and his wife Tana had become ambassadors for Cornwall Air Ambulance.

===Life-threatening experiences===
In 2008, Ramsay was in Iceland&#x27;s Westman Islands filming a puffin hunting segment when he lost his footing and fell during a descent off an cliff, landing in the icy water below. He was able to swim back up to the surface of the water by removing his heavy boots and waterproof clothing. His film crew, who rescued him by throwing him a rope, reported that he was submerged for at least 45 seconds. He later recalled, &quot;I thought I was a goner. I was panicking and my lungs were filling with water. When I got to the top after getting my boots off, I was dazed and my head was totally massive.&quot; 

In June 2024, Ramsay was involved in a bicycle accident in the US state of Connecticut that left bruising on the entirety of his left abdomen. He later remarked on social media that his helmet saved his life, and emphasized the importance of wearing a helmet whilst cycling.

===Pre-prepared meal controversy===
On 17 April 2009, it was revealed that one of Ramsay&#x27;s restaurants, Foxtrot Oscar in London&#x27;s Chelsea area, used pre-prepared food that was heated up and sold with mark-ups of up to 586%. It was also revealed that three of his gastropubs in London did the same thing. A spokeswoman for Ramsay said, &quot;Gordon Ramsay chefs prepare components of dishes devised and produced to the highest Gordon Ramsay standards. These are supplied to those kitchens with limited cooking space such as Foxtrot Oscar and Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s highly acclaimed pubs, including the Narrow. These are sealed and transported daily in refrigerated vans and all menu dishes are then cooked in the individual kitchens. This is only for the supply of Foxtrot Oscar and the three pubs and allows each establishment to control the consistency and the quality of the food served.&quot; Reflecting on the controversy in 2010, Ramsay was unapologetic: &quot;When I was working at the Gavroche all those years ago, the duck terrine wasn&#x27;t made there. It was made outside, then brought to the restaurant wrapped in plastic. This is standard practice. What on earth was the fuss about?&quot;

===Controversy over Cornwall===
On 23 March 2022 in an interview for BBC Radio 2, Ramsay remarked, &quot;...Trust me I absolutely love Cornwall, it&#x27;s just the Cornish I can&#x27;t stand.&quot; This received a response from the leader of the political party Mebyon Kernow, Clir D. Cole saying;

I am really disappointed to hear Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s divisive comments and his lack of respect for the Cornish people. It is shocking that he deems it OK to make such a public statement that he would presumably not make about other national or ethnic groups. It does need to be pointed out that the Cornish are protected as a &#x27;national minority&#x27; just like the Welsh and Scots through the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. I sincerely hope he will reflect on his words and apologise. Many people living to the west of the Tamar do not enjoy as good a life as Mr Ramsay, and I would welcome the media doing some features on poverty, the housing crisis and other socio-economic problems suffered by ordinary people in Cornwall, as well as the need for greater support for Cornish identity and culture.

Ramsay&#x27;s spokesman said: &quot;Gordon has made these tongue-in-cheek comments many, many times.&quot;

=== Football ===
Ramsay played football and was first chosen to play under-14 football at age 12. He was chosen to play for Warwickshire. His footballing career was marked by injuries, causing him to remark later in life, &quot;Perhaps I was doomed when it came to football.&quot; In mid-1984, Ramsay had a trial with Rangers, the club he supported as a boy. He seriously injured his knee, smashing the cartilage during training. Ramsay has claimed to have played two first-team games for Rangers. According to his autobiography, Ramsay played &quot;a couple of non-league matches as a trialist&quot; for Rangers and was signed by the club at the age of 15. Allan Cairns, a photographer who took a picture of Ramsay playing for Rangers in September 1985, said the photo was not one of the Rangers first team but a side picked to play a testimonial match. A Rangers spokesman said: &quot;Ramsay was a trialist in that testimonial game. He trained with us for a few months after that but then got injured.&quot;

====Rangers revisited====
In series 4, episode 12, of &quot;The F Word&quot; (originally aired on 29 July 2008), Ramsay visited Ibrox, the home ground of his favourite childhood team, Rangers, and exclaimed, &quot;Home sweet home!&quot; He explained, &quot;My dream came true when I was spotted in the mid-[19]80s and I joined the youth team here in Ibrox.&quot; He related that one of his fondest memories is playing alongside former Rangers and Scotland striker Ally McCoist, who said about Ramsay: &quot;I remember him well and the one thing that never ever will change is that he&#x27;s a competitive so-and-so and wants to do and be the best that he can.&quot; Ramsay recalled that &quot;the pain of being released on the back of an injury&quot; was only assuaged many years later &quot;after receiving [his] third Michelin Star&quot;, and concluded, &quot;Without the upset at Ibrox, I would not be the chef I am today.&quot;

===Other interests===
Ramsay is a football fan and supports Rangers and Chelsea. As a baseball fan, he follows the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Angels. However, he feels that the game of baseball is often too long, joking that this leads to fans spending most of the time eating or sleeping which could lead to them being unhealthy. Ramsay is also a fan of Formula One, having grown up close to Silverstone Circuit and idolizing world champions Ayrton Senna and Nigel Mansell.

<text>Sir Horace Darwin, (13 May 1851 – 22 September 1928) was an English engineer specializing in the design and manufacture of precision scientific instruments. He was a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.

== Personal life and education ==

Darwin was born in Down House in Kent in 1851, the fifth son and ninth child of the British naturalist Charles Darwin and his wife Emma, and the youngest of their seven children who survived to adulthood.

He was educated at a private school in Woodbridge, Suffolk, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1874.

In January 1880 Darwin and Emma Cecilia &quot;Ida&quot; Farrer married. She was the daughter of Thomas Farrer, 1st Baron Farrer and was styled Lady Ida Darwin after her marriage. They had one son and two daughters:
* Erasmus Darwin IV (7 December 1881 – 24 April 1915) was killed in the Second Battle of Ypres during the First World War.
* Ruth Frances Darwin (1883–1972), married Dr. William Rees-Thomas, was a notable advocate of eugenics.
* Emma Nora Darwin (1885–1989) plant geneticist, edited the 1959 edition of &quot;The Autobiography of Charles Darwin&quot; and married the civil servant Sir Alan Barlow.

He is buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge with his wife; his brother Sir Francis Darwin is interred in the same graveyard. His other brother Sir George Darwin is buried in the Trumpington Extension Cemetery, Cambridge.

His family home, &quot;the Orchard&quot;, in Huntingdon Road, Cambridge, is now the site of Murray Edwards College.

==Career==
In 1881 he co-founded the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company with Albert George Dew-Smith. Darwin led the company when the partnership ended in 1891. He was Mayor of Cambridge between 1896 and 1897, became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1903 and was knighted in 1918.

<text>Sir Francis Darwin (16 August 1848 – 19 September 1925) was a British botanist. He was the third son of the naturalist and scientist Charles Darwin.

==Biography==

Francis Darwin was born in Down House, Downe, Kent in 1848. He was the third son and seventh child of Charles Darwin and his wife Emma Wedgwood. He was educated at Clapham Grammar School.

He then went to Trinity College, Cambridge, first studying mathematics, then changing to natural sciences, graduating in 1870. He then went to study medicine at St George&#x27;s Medical School, London, earning an MB in 1875, but did not practise medicine.

Darwin was married three times and widowed twice. First he married Amy Richenda Ruck in 1874, but she died in 1876 four days after the birth of their son Bernard Darwin, who was later to become a golf writer. In September 1883 he married Ellen Wordsworth Crofts (1856–1903) and they had a daughter Frances Crofts Darwin (1886–1960), a poet who married the poet Francis Cornford and became known under her married name. His third wife was Florence Henrietta Fisher, daughter of Herbert William Fisher and widow of Frederic William Maitland, whom he married in 1913, the year in which he was knighted. Her sister Adeline Fisher was the first wife of Darwin&#x27;s double first cousin once removed Ralph Vaughan Williams.

Francis Darwin worked with his father on experiments dealing with plant movements, specifically phototropism. They co-authored &quot;The Power of Movement in Plants&quot; (1880) and Francis Darwin published a second expanded edition of &quot;Insectivorous Plants&quot; (1888) after his father&#x27;s death. Their experiments showed that the coleoptile of a young grass seedling directs its growth toward the light by comparing the responses of seedlings with covered and uncovered coleoptiles. These observations would later lead to the discovery of auxin.

Darwin was nominated by his father to the Linnean Society of London in 1875, and was elected as a Fellow of the Society on 2 December 1875. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 8 June 1882, the same year in which his father died. Darwin edited &quot;The Autobiography of Charles Darwin&quot; (1887), and produced some books of letters from the correspondence of Charles Darwin; &quot;The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin&quot; (1887) and &quot;More Letters of Charles Darwin&quot; (1905). He also edited Thomas Huxley&#x27;s &quot;On the Reception of the Origin of Species&quot; (1887).

Darwin was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1909. That same year, Cambridge University awarded him an honorary doctorate (DSc). He also received honorary doctorates from Dublin, Liverpool, Sheffield, Brussels, St Andrews, Upsala, and Prague. He was knighted in 1913.

He is buried in Cambridge. His daughter, Frances Cornford, was later buried with him.

==Family==

His first wife, Amy Ruck, died in 1876, a few days after the birth of her son Bernard, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Corris, North Wales. According to a letter written by Charles Darwin to his close friend, Joseph Dalton Hooker: &quot; I never saw anyone suffer so much as poor Frank. He has gone to N. Wales to bury the body in a little church-yard amongst the mountains&quot;.

He married his second wife, Ellen Wordsworth Crofts, in 1883. She was a Fellow and lecturer at Newnham College. She was a member of the Ladies Dining Society in Cambridge. She died in 1903, and is buried in the churchyard of St. Andrew&#x27;s Church, Girton.

In 1913, he married his third wife, Lady Florence Henrietta Fisher, the widow of Frederic William Maitland. She died in 1920 and is interred in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground, Cambridge, opposite the grave of Sir Francis Darwin and his daughter Frances Cornford.

<text>Lourenço Marques was a 16th-century Portuguese trader and coloniser.

==Biography==
Lourenço Marques explored the area that is now Maputo Bay in 1544 and settled permanently in present-day Mozambique, where he spent most of his life with his indigenous wife and their children.
By order of King John III, Maputo Bay was named Baía de Lourenço Marques in his honour, but this name was never in common use among the foreign community.

==Other uses==
Maputo, the capital city of Portuguese Mozambique since 1898, was founded as Lourenco Marques before this Overseas Province of Portugal, the so-called Portuguese East Africa where was the seat of the governor-general, became independent from the colonial power in 1975: the city got its present name on 3 February 1976, giving its name to one of the six districts into which the province was divided.

Chalmers presented many programmes from Manchester, including &quot;Children&#x27;s Television Club&quot; which later metamorphosed into &quot;Blue Peter&quot; based in London. She spent some time at secretarial college in Manchester in the early 1950s.

In the 1960s, Chalmers presented two major BBC radio programmes: &quot;Family Favourites&quot; and &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;. She also appeared as the original Susan in &quot;The Clitheroe Kid&quot;, and was a foil for Ken Dodd in his radio show. Chalmers presented ballroom dancing competition programme &quot;Come Dancing&quot; for the BBC from 1961 to 1965.

During the 1970s, Chalmers regularly presented ITV&#x27;s daytime magazine programme &quot;Good Afternoon&quot; and its successors, which included &quot;Afternoon Plus&quot; and &quot;A Plus&quot;. She started presenting ITV&#x27;s holiday programme &quot;Wish You Were Here?&quot; in 1974 and continued in this role until 2003, initially working alongside Chris Kelly, and later with John Carter.

In the 1980s Chalmers was a regular host of the Miss World contest on ITV, also presenting the associated UK beauty pageants such as Miss United Kingdom and the British Beauty Championships. Chalmers presented BBC Radio 2&#x27;s mid-morning show from 1990 to 1992, taking over from Ken Bruce, who took over the show again following Chalmers&#x27;s departure from the station in 1992.

In 2001, Chalmers appeared on &quot;Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank&quot;. She took part in an episode of the BBC Two series &quot;Celebrity Antiques Road Trip&quot;, with her son Mark, in 2013.

Her television appearances in later years have been limited to short spots on chat show programmes such as Good Morning Britain, &quot;Lorraine&quot; and Graham Norton&#x27;s chat shows. In 2017, Chalmers took part in Channel 5’s &quot;Celebrity Taste of Italy&quot;.

==Personal life==
Chalmers has been married to sports commentator Neil Durden-Smith since 1964. The couple live in north London and have two children, including television presenter Mark. Chalmers has six grandchildren.

She was appointed an OBE in 1994.

<text>Serine proteases (or serine endopeptidases) are enzymes that cleave peptide bonds in proteins. Serine serves as the nucleophilic amino acid at the (enzyme&#x27;s) active site. 
They are found ubiquitously in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Serine proteases fall into two broad categories based on their structure: chymotrypsin-like (trypsin-like) or subtilisin-like.

==Classification==

The MEROPS protease classification system counts 16 superfamilies (as of 2013) each containing many families. Each superfamily uses the catalytic triad or dyad in a different protein fold and so represent convergent evolution of the catalytic mechanism. The majority belong to the S1 family of the PA clan (superfamily) of proteases.

For superfamilies, P: superfamily, containing a mixture of nucleophile class families, S: purely serine proteases. superfamily. Within each superfamily, families are designated by their catalytic nucleophile, (S: serine proteases).

==Substrate specificity==

Serine proteases are characterised by a distinctive structure, consisting of two beta-barrel domains that converge at the catalytic active site. These enzymes can be further categorised based on their substrate specificity as either trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like or elastase-like.

===Trypsin-like===

Trypsin-like proteases cleave peptide bonds following a positively charged amino acid (lysine or arginine).
This specificity is driven by the residue which lies at the base of the enzyme&#x27;s S1 pocket (generally a negatively charged aspartic acid or glutamic acid).

===Chymotrypsin-like===

The S1 pocket of chymotrypsin-like enzymes is more hydrophobic than in trypsin-like proteases. This results in a specificity for medium to large sized hydrophobic residues, such as tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan.

===Thrombin-like===
These include thrombin, tissue activating plasminogen and plasmin. They have been found to have roles in coagulation and digestion as well as in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s induced dementia. Many highly-toxic thrombin-like serine protease isoforms are found in snake venoms.

===Elastase-like===

Elastase-like proteases have a much smaller S1 cleft than either trypsin- or chymotrypsin-like proteases. Consequently, residues such as alanine, glycine and valine tend to be preferred.

===Subtilisin-like===
Subtilisin is a serine protease in prokaryotes. Subtilisin is evolutionarily unrelated to the chymotrypsin-clan, but shares the same catalytic mechanism utilising a catalytic triad, to create a nucleophilic serine. This is the classic example used to illustrate convergent evolution, since the same mechanism evolved twice independently during evolution.

==Catalytic mechanism==

The main player in the catalytic mechanism in the serine proteases is the catalytic triad. The triad is located in the active site of the enzyme, where catalysis occurs, and is preserved in all superfamilies of serine protease enzymes. The triad is a coordinated structure consisting of three amino acids: His 57, Ser 195 (hence the name &quot;serine protease&quot;) and Asp 102. These three key amino acids each play an essential role in the cleaving ability of the proteases. While the amino acid members of the triad are located far from one another on the sequence of the protein, due to folding, they will be very close to one another in the heart of the enzyme. The particular geometry of the triad members are highly characteristic to their specific function: it was shown that the position of just four points of the triad characterize the function of the containing enzyme.

In the event of catalysis, an ordered mechanism occurs in which several intermediates are generated. The catalysis of the peptide cleavage can be seen as a ping-pong catalysis, in which a substrate binds (in this case, the polypeptide being cleaved), a product is released (the C-terminus &quot;half&quot; of the peptide with amino group visible), another substrate binds (in this case, water), and another product is released (the N-terminus &quot;half&quot; of the peptide with carboxyl group visible).

Each amino acid in the triad performs a specific task in this process:
*The serine has an -OH group that is able to act as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of the scissile peptide bond of the substrate.
*A pair of electrons on the histidine nitrogen has the ability to accept the hydrogen from the serine -OH group, thus coordinating the attack of the peptide bond.
*The carboxyl group on the aspartic acid in turn hydrogen bonds with the histidine, making the nitrogen atom mentioned above much more electronegative.

The whole reaction can be summarized as follows:
*The polypeptide substrate binds to the surface of the serine protease enzyme such that the scissile bond is inserted into the active site of the enzyme, with the carbonyl carbon of this bond positioned near the nucleophilic serine.
*The serine -OH attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the nitrogen of the histidine accepts the hydrogen from the -OH of the [serine] and a pair of electrons from the double bond of the carbonyl oxygen moves to the oxygen. As a result, a tetrahedral intermediate is generated.
*The bond joining the nitrogen and the carbon in the peptide bond is now broken. The covalent electrons creating this bond move to attack the hydrogen of the histidine, breaking the connection. The electrons that previously moved from the carbonyl oxygen double bond move back from the negative oxygen to recreate the bond, generating an acyl-enzyme intermediate.
*Now, water comes into the reaction. Water replaces the N-terminus of the cleaved peptide, and attacks the carbonyl carbon. Once again, the electrons from the double bond move to the oxygen making it negative, as the bond between the oxygen of the water and the carbon is formed. This is coordinated by the nitrogen of the histidine, which accepts a proton from the water. Overall, this generates another tetrahedral intermediate.
*In a final reaction, the bond formed in the first step between the serine and the carbonyl carbon moves to attack the hydrogen that the histidine just acquired. The now electron-deficient carbonyl carbon re-forms the double bond with the oxygen. As a result, the C-terminus of the peptide is now ejected.

===Additional stabilizing effects===
It was discovered that additional amino acids of the protease, &quot;Gly 193&quot; and &quot;Ser 195&quot;, are involved in creating what is called an &quot;oxyanion hole&quot;. Both &quot;Gly 193&quot; and &quot;Ser 195&quot; can donate backbone hydrogens for hydrogen bonding.
When the tetrahedral intermediate of step 1 and step 3 are generated, the negative oxygen ion, having accepted the electrons from the carbonyl double bond, fits perfectly into the oxyanion hole. In effect, serine proteases preferentially bind the transition state and the overall structure is favored, lowering the activation energy of the reaction. This &quot;preferential binding&quot; is responsible for much of the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme.

==Regulation of serine protease activity==

Host organisms must ensure that the activity of serine proteases is adequately regulated. This is achieved by a requirement for initial protease activation, and the secretion of inhibitors.

===Zymogen activation===

Zymogens are the usually inactive precursors of an enzyme. If the digestive enzymes were active when synthesized, they would immediately start chewing up the synthesizing organs and tissues. Acute pancreatitis is such a condition, in which there is premature activation of the digestive enzymes in the pancreas, resulting in self-digestion (autolysis). It also complicates postmortem investigations, as the pancreas often digests itself before it can be assessed visually.

Zymogens are large, inactive structures, which have the ability to break apart or change into the smaller activated enzymes. The difference between zymogens and the activated enzymes lies in the fact that the active site for catalysis of the zymogens is distorted. As a result, the substrate polypeptide cannot bind effectively, and proteolysis does not occur. Only after activation, during which the conformation and structure of the zymogen change and the active site is opened, can proteolysis occur.

As can be seen, trypsinogen activation to &quot;trypsin&quot; is essential, because it activates its own reaction, as well as the reaction of both &quot;chymotrypsin&quot; and &quot;elastase&quot;. Therefore, it is essential that this activation does not occur prematurely. There are several protective measures taken by the organism to prevent self-digestion:
*The activation of trypsinogen by trypsin is relatively slow
*The zymogens are stored in zymogen granules, capsules that have walls that are thought to be resistant to proteolysis.

===Inhibition===

There are certain inhibitors that resemble the tetrahedral intermediate, and thus fill up the active site, preventing the enzyme from working properly. Trypsin, a powerful digestive enzyme, is generated in the pancreas. Inhibitors prevent self-digestion of the pancreas itself.

Serine proteases are paired with serine protease inhibitors, which turn off their activity when they are no longer needed.

Serine proteases are inhibited by a diverse group of inhibitors, including synthetic chemical inhibitors for research or therapeutic purposes, and also natural proteinaceous inhibitors. One family of natural inhibitors called &quot;serpins&quot; (abbreviated from serine protease inhibitors) can form a covalent bond with the serine protease, inhibiting its function. The best-studied &quot;serpins&quot; are antithrombin and alpha 1-antitrypsin, studied for their role in coagulation/thrombosis and emphysema/A1AT, respectively.
Artificial irreversible small molecule inhibitors include AEBSF and PMSF.

A family of arthropod serine peptidase inhibitors, called pacifastin, has been identified in locusts and crayfish, and may function in the arthropod immune system.

==Role in disease==
Mutations may lead to decreased or increased activity of enzymes. This may have different consequences, depending on the normal function of the serine protease. For example, mutations in protein C can lead to protein C deficiency and predisposing to thrombosis. Also, some proteases play a vital role in host cell-virus fusion activation by priming virus&#x27;s Spike protein to show the protein named &quot;fusion protein&quot; (TMPRSS2 activate SARS-CoV-2 fusion). Exogenous snake venom serine proteases cause a vast array of coagulopathies when injected in a host due to the lack of regulation of their activity.

==Diagnostic use==
Determination of serine protease levels may be useful in the context of particular diseases.
* Coagulation factor levels may be required in the diagnosis of hemorrhagic or thrombotic conditions.
* Fecal elastase is employed to determine the exocrine activity of the pancreas, e.g., in cystic fibrosis or chronic pancreatitis.
* Serum prostate-specific antigen is used in prostate cancer screening, risk stratification, and post-treatment monitoring.
* Serine protease, as released by mast cells, is an important diagnostic marker for type 1 hypersensitivity reactions e.g., anaphylaxis. More useful than histamine due to the longer half-life, meaning it remains in the system for a clinically useful length of time.

== Antimicrobial effect ==
Due to their catalytic activity, some serine proteases possess potent antimicrobial properties. Several in vitro studies have demonstrated the efficacy of some proteases in reducing virulence by cleaving viral surface proteins. Viral entry into host cells is mediated by the interaction of these surface proteins with the host cell. When these proteins are fragmented or inactivated on the viral surface, the viral entry is impaired, leading to a reduction in infectivity of a broad spectrum of pathologically relevant microorganisms like Influenza, hRSV and others.

<doc id="636377" wikidata="Q16147874" url="?curid=636377" title="List of English words of Yiddish origin">
<text>This is a list of words that have entered the English language from the Yiddish language, many of them by way of American English. There are differing approaches to the romanization of Yiddish orthography (which uses the Hebrew alphabet); thus, the spelling of some of the words in this list may be variable (for example, is a variant of , and , ).

==Background==
Yiddish is a Germanic language, originally spoken by Jews in Central and later Eastern Europe, written in the Hebrew alphabet, and containing a substantial substratum of Hebrew words as well as numerous loans from Slavic languages. For that reason, some of the words listed originated in Hebrew or Slavic languages, but have entered English via Yiddish.

Yiddish is closely related to modern German, and many Yiddish words have German cognates; in some cases it is difficult to tell whether a particular word was borrowed from Yiddish or from German. Yiddish is written in the Hebrew alphabet, and Yiddish words may be transliterated into Latin spelling in a variety of ways; the transliterated spelling of Yiddish words and the conventional spelling of German are usually different, but the pronunciations are frequently the same (e.g., in Yiddish is pronounced the same way as in German).

==List of words==
These English words of Yiddish origin, except as noted, are in the online editions of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED), &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language&quot; (AHD), or the &quot;Merriam-Webster&quot; dictionary (MW). The parentheses-enclosed information at the end of each word&#x27;s entry starts with the original Yiddish term in Hebrew script, the Latin script transliteration, and the literal English translation (if different from the English definition given earlier). This may be followed by additional relevant languages (mostly Hebrew and German). One or more dictionary references appear at the end.

<text>Malo Ioane Luafutu, also called Jeshua Ioane Luafutu (born on 29 May 1979), and better known by his stage name Scribe, is a New Zealand rapper of Samoan descent. He achieved two solo number ones on the singles chart from his debut album, &quot;The Crusader&quot;, which was released in 2003 in New Zealand and later certified four times platinum. He also reached number one as a featured artist on P-Money&#x27;s 2004 song &quot;Stop the Music&quot;, and in 2010 on R&amp;B singer J.Williams&#x27; single &quot;You Got Me&quot;.

== Early life ==
Scribe was born Malo Loane Luafutu on 29 May 1979 in Christchurch, New Zealand, to Caroline &#x27;Carol&#x27; Luafutu and Fa&#x27;amoana John Luafutu. He grew up in the suburb of Philipstown, Christchurch.

== Career ==
With the initial focus on the song &quot;Stand Up&quot;, director Chris Graham gave the video for the single the energy of a rock video. He invited music guests, DJs and even the general public to participate as extras in the video. The song debuted at number 6 on the New Zealand top 40 singles chart and soon rose to number 1. The single spent 12 (non-consecutive) weeks at number one.

Dirty Records released Scribe&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Crusader&quot; in New Zealand in October 2003 with distribution through Festival Mushroom Records. The album went gold within hours and platinum within days. It sold 60,000 copies in New Zealand, which is four times platinum status in that country.

Scribe followed the success of the album with the limited-edition release of &quot;Not Many – The Remix!&quot; featuring guest vocals from MCs Savage and Con Psy which peaked at No. 2. He then released a new single, &quot;Dreaming&quot; in January 2004; this also reached No. 1.

Scribe took a break from new singles and toured the country on the Hook It Up tour before he returned in late 2004 with a new single off P-Money&#x27;s &quot;Magic City&quot; album called &quot;Stop the Music&quot;, again reaching No. 1.

In 2005, he opened for the Beastie Boys at shows in Australia.
=== &quot;Rhyme Book&quot; ===
Scribe&#x27;s second studio album, titled &quot;Rhyme Book&quot;, was released by Scribe in Australia on 29 September 2007 and in New Zealand on 1 October 2007. &quot;Rhyme Book&quot; did not sell as well as its predecessor. It featured collaborations with New York hip-hop artist Talib Kweli (of Reflection Eternal and Black Star fame) on the track &quot;Be Alright&quot;.

The first single off the album in New Zealand, &quot;My Shit&quot;, had its video premiere on 12 August 2007 on local music channel C4. &quot;F.R.E.S.H.&quot; was the second single released in New Zealand. The first single in Australia however was &quot;F.R.E.S.H.&quot;, followed by &quot;My Shit&quot;. The third single in both countries, &quot;Say It Again&quot;, features Scribe&#x27;s cousin Tyra Hammond.
=== &quot;Scribe is Dead&quot; ===
After a decade hiatus, Scribe released a single titled &quot;Non Attachment&quot; which will feature on the forthcoming independently released album &quot;Scribe is Dead&quot;, due for release in 2025, originally announced for release in 2024. This effectively shelved his third album &quot;Therapy&quot; that was announced in 2011 but never released.

A second single for the album, titled &quot;Glowstick&quot;, was released at the end of 2023. A third song, &quot;Do or Die, Don’t or Die&quot;, was premiered in late April 2024. Scribe said in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that it would be his final album.

==Personal struggles and addictions==
In 2011, in an interview on &quot;Campbell Live&quot;, Scribe described how he became addicted to drugs, alcohol and gambling between 2005 and 2007 following lacklustre sales of his second album, &quot;Rhyme Book&quot;. His addiction led to his family denying him access to money. He decided to pawn off the platinum awards he had won with his debut album.

In November 2011 Scribe was arrested in Wellington for disorder and released after being formally warned. Scribe said his arrest was illegal, but he admitted he was &quot;dissing&quot; the police but that &quot;their ego couldn&#x27;t handle it&quot;.

Following the assault on cricketer Jesse Ryder in late March 2013, Scribe took to Twitter, implying that Ryder was somehow responsible because his behaviour was not &quot;humble&quot; enough for someone visiting Christchurch. He further noted that &quot;Cantabrians don&#x27;t beat people up for no reason.&quot; Scribe&#x27;s comments were widely vilified on Twitter and numerous blogs, with many posters alluding to Scribe&#x27;s role in the violent, unprovoked assault on Phil Armstrong in 2004 as further evidence that he condones violence. Ryder later jokingly thanked Scribe for his &quot;support&quot;.

In August 2018, Scribe was imprisoned for two months after breaching his curfew and performed in Motueka. He was released on 29 October. He was later due in court on 13 December for methamphetamine possession and breach of protection order.

==Christchurch earthquake==
Scribe released a remix of his single &quot;Not Many&quot; to show support for the victims of the 2011 Christchurch earthquakes. &quot;Not Many Cities&quot; features Scribe rapping in different parts of the CBD&#x27;s red zone, with altered lyrics such as &quot;I don&#x27;t know any city&quot; instead of &quot;I don&#x27;t know anybody&quot;. Although his video received positive attention from the media, there was outcry from some Christchurch residents who claimed it was unfair that Scribe was allowed in the red zones when red zone business owners were not.

Shortly after the remix&#x27;s release, Scribe announced that he was working on a third album, titled &quot;Therapy&quot;, but it was later shelved.

==Family==
Scribe is the cousin of other prominent Samoan New Zealand musicians Ladi6 and Tyra Hammond of The Opensouls. His father is Fa&#x27;amoana John Luafutu, who wrote the 2022 film &quot;A Boy Called Piano&quot;, directed by Nina Nawalowalo. Scribe&#x27;s brother Matthias Luafutu is an actor. 

Scribe, Matthias and their father John also collaborated with Tom McCrory and Nina Nawalowalo on the stage play &quot;A White Guitar&quot; in 2015, which was an autobiographical story that did an eight-city sold-out tour in 2016.

<text>David Bates is a historian of Britain and France during the period from the tenth to the thirteenth centuries. He has written many books and articles during his career, including &quot;Normandy before 1066&quot; (1982), &quot;Regesta Regum Anglo-Normannorum: The Acta of William I, 1066–1087&quot; (1998), &quot;The Normans and Empire&quot; (2013), &quot;William the Conqueror&quot; (2016) in the Yale English Monarchs series (translated into French as &quot;Guillaume le Conquérant&quot; (2019)) and &quot;La Tapisserie de Bayeux&quot; (co-authored with Xavier Barral i Altet) (2019).

== Education and career ==

*King Edward VI Grammar School, Nuneaton (1955–1963)
*University of Exeter (BA, 1966, and PhD, 1970)
* Archivist at the Imperial War Museum in London (1969–1971)
* Fellow of the University of Wales, University College, Cardiff (now the University of Cardiff) (1971–73). He remained there as lecturer, senior lecturer, reader, and professor until 1994.
*Edwards Professor of Medieval History at the University of Glasgow (1994–2003)
* Director of the Institute of Historical Research in the University of London (2003–08)
* Professor of Medieval History at the University of East Anglia (2008–2010). He is now Emeritus Professor there.
*Visiting Professorship at the University of Caen Normandie from 2009 to 2012
* The University of Caen Normandie awarded him an honorary doctorate (Docteur Honoris Causa) in 2000.

During this peripatetic career, he has held several positions that have involved responsibilities for the general development of his subject, such as Head of History and Welsh History in Cardiff, Head of the Department of Medieval History, Head of the School of History and Archaeology, and Head of History in Glasgow, and Director of the Centre of East Anglian Studies at the University of East Anglia. His time at the Institute of Historical Research, among other things, required that he animate public debate about History&#x27;s role in British education and in public life and that he participate in delegations and projects that took him to Japan, Russia, Israel, and the United States.

== Publications ==

=== Books ===
The most important of his books are:
* &quot;Normandy before 1066&quot; (London and New York, Longmans, 1982)
* &quot;A Bibliography of Domesday Book&quot; (Woodbridge, The Boydell Press, 1986)
* &quot;William the Conqueror&quot; (George Philip, 1989; reprinted, Tempus, 2001,2004)
* &quot;Regesta Regum Anglo-Normannorum: The Acta of William I, 1066–1087&quot; (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1998)
* &quot;The Normans and Empire&quot; (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2013)
* &quot;William the Conqueror&quot; (London and New Haven, Yale University Press, 2016). Translated into French as &quot;Guillaume le Conquérant&quot; (Paris, Flammarion, 2019)
*&quot;La Tapisserie de Bayeux&quot; (Paris: Citadelles &amp; Mazenod, 2019). Co-authored with Xavier Barral i Altet).

&quot;The Normans and Empire&quot; argues for a new analytical framework for the expansion of the Normans in Western Europe and for the experience of the British Isles. &quot;William the Conqueror&quot; (&quot;Guillaume le Conquérant&quot;) proposes a radical revision of the life of William the Conqueror.

All of his books are based on extensive researches in the archives and libraries in France and Normandy that have uncovered a lot of new or inadequately known material, some of it published in &quot;Regum Anglo-Normannorum: The Acta of William I&quot;. He retains an interest in the interpretation of charters as literary sources and is currently working on a book on William the Conqueror&#x27;s half-brother Odo, bishop of Bayeux and further innovative approaches to the history of northern Europe during the period from the tenth to the thirteenth century. A Festschrift has been published in his honour:

*&quot;Normandy and its Neighbours, 900-1250: Essays for David Bates&quot;, ed. David Crouch and Kathleen Thompson (Turnhout, Brepols, 2011).

He has co-edited a volume in honour of Professor Elisabeth van Houts, &quot;Lives, Identities and Histories in the Central Middle Ages&quot;, ed. Julie Barrau and David Bates (Cambridge, 2021).

<doc id="636406" wikidata="Q154222" url="?curid=636406" title="Craig David">
<text>Craig Ashley David (born 5 May 1981) is an English singer. He rose to fame in 1999, featuring on the single &quot;Re-Rewind&quot; by Artful Dodger. David&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Born to Do It&quot;, was released in 2000, after which he has released a further five studio albums and worked with a variety of artists such as Sting and Tinchy Stryder.

==Early life==
David was born in Southampton, Hampshire, the only child of Tina (née Loftus), a retail assistant at Superdrug, and George David, a carpenter, and grew up in the Holyrood estate. David&#x27;s father is from Grenada in the Caribbean and David&#x27;s mother is Anglo-Jewish and related to the founders of the Accurist watch-making company; David&#x27;s maternal grandfather was an Orthodox Jew and his maternal grandmother a convert to Judaism. David&#x27;s parents separated when he was eight and he was brought up by his mother.

He attended Bellemoor School and Southampton City College. David was bullied by other students at school. He wrote and released the song &quot;Johnny&quot; in 2005 about his memories of being bullied.

David&#x27;s father, George David, played bass in a reggae band called Ebony Rockers. As a teen, David began accompanying his father to local dance clubs, where DJs let him take the microphone. He also began creating his own music and lyrics and working in youth and community clubs as an MC and DJ.

==Career==
===Early career===
David&#x27;s earliest exposure came when he worked on a B-side to British group Damage&#x27;s cover of &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot;, on the track &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot;. He then started doing vocals for the UK garage duo Artful Dodger, on tracks such as &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;What Ya Gonna Do&quot;.

Wildstar Records first became aware of David when the artist&#x27;s then manager Paul Widger met the label&#x27;s co-owner Colin Lester and played some of his music. Lester later told HitQuarters that he was particularly impressed by the first song he heard, &quot;Walking Away&quot;, saying &quot;That was an absolute stand-out ... It struck me that any seventeen-year-old that could write a song like this had huge potential.&quot; The Wildstar boss was further won over when, on later visiting the artist&#x27;s home in Southampton, he found David&#x27;s tiny bedroom stacked from floor to ceiling with 12&quot; vinyl records, commenting: &quot;That convinced me he was the real deal and not just some kid acting out the part.&quot; At that point Lester offered him a development deal with his label. When Lester later heard the song &quot;7 Days&quot;, he said he immediately heard a number-one record and promoted the contract to an album deal the same day.

===1999–2003: &quot;Born to Do It&quot; and &quot;Slicker Than Your Average&quot;===
The song &quot;Re-Rewind (The Crowd Say Bo Selecta)&quot;, from the Artful Dodger album &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Stragglers&quot;, hit number two on the UK charts in 1999; thus, paving the way for a solo career. David&#x27;s first single, &quot;Fill Me In&quot;, released on Colin Lester&#x27;s and Ian McAndrew&#x27;s Wildstar Records, topped the UK chart and was the first of a string of four top 10 singles from his debut album &quot;Born to Do It&quot;, which eventually sold more than 8 million copies worldwide, earning multi-platinum status in more than 20 countries. The song &quot;Key to My Heart&quot;, taken from the US version of the album, was also featured in the award-winning Warner Bros. animated film &quot;Osmosis Jones&quot;.

The success of David&#x27;s debut, which was written almost entirely by David and Mark Hill of Artful Dodger, led to the United States release of &quot;Fill Me In&quot; in May 2001. It reached number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. &quot;Born to Do It&quot; was released in the United States on 17 July 2001, peaking at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and sold over 1 million copies. The single &quot;7 Days&quot; hit the top 10 in the U.S.; although &quot;Walking Away&quot;, which had reached number 3 in the UK and number 5 in Australia, missed the top 40 in the U.S. and was the last of his singles to chart there.

In April 2009, MTV viewers voted &quot;Born to Do It&quot; as number 2 on their &quot;Greatest Album of All Time&quot; poll, behind Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;.

The follow-up album, &quot;Slicker Than Your Average&quot;, was released in 2002. The album&#x27;s first four singles continued David&#x27;s streak of top 10 hits in the UK, bringing a total of nine consecutive top 10 hits until &quot;World Filled with Love&quot; peaked at number 15 in 2003. None of the six singles released from the album charted in the U.S. Although &quot;What&#x27;s Your Flava?&quot; and &quot;Rise &amp; Fall&quot; (duet with Sting) received airplay on the urban contemporary and soft adult contemporary formats, they did not make the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs or Adult Contemporary charts. However, &quot;What&#x27;s Your Flava?&quot; made the Rhythmic Top 40 chart (number 32), Mainstream Top 40 chart (number 24) and the Top 40 Tracks chart (number 37). According to the RIAA, &quot;Slicker Than Your Average&quot; was certified gold in the U.S.

David also commented that the album title could be looked at in two different ways: &quot;On the one hand, it&#x27;s coming across like I&#x27;m arrogant. On the other hand, it&#x27;s saying I have a lot more composure on the album.&quot; The album was leaked onto the internet prior to its official release but David was not too bothered as he felt it &quot;spreads the word&quot;.

===2005–2009: &quot;The Story Goes...&quot; and &quot;Trust Me&quot;===

David later signed on with Warner Music and put together his third album, &quot;The Story Goes...&quot;, which was released worldwide in August 2005 (excluding the U.S. where it was never released). The first single, &quot;All the Way&quot;, returned him to the top 3. The second single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Love You No More (I&#x27;m Sorry)&quot;, tied with &quot;7 Days&quot; as his longest-running single in the charts since &quot;Re-Rewind&quot;, spending 15 weeks inside the UK top 75. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Unbelievable&quot;, debuted at number 18 in March 2006.

The second single, &quot;Insomnia&quot;, produced by Jim Beanz from Timbaland productions, a dance track with hard bassline beats, was released the following week on 17 November 2008.

He met fans at a meet and greet session at Singapore Changi Airport before his show.

===2009–2013: &quot;Signed Sealed Delivered&quot; and TS5 launch===
On 18 September 2009, fans got the first taste of the new album with an exclusive demo posted on his official website, a thirty-second snippet covering Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered I&#x27;m Yours&quot;. On 2 October 2009, David revealed to his fans via Twitter and his website that he had signed a new record deal with Universal Motown. The UK edition of Jay Sean&#x27;s new album &quot;All or Nothing&quot; which was released on 30 November 2009, features David on a track entitled &quot;Stuck in the Middle&quot;. David performed a bold new cover of &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be Like You&quot; from Walt Disney&#x27;s 1967 film &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; on the ITV programme &quot;Ultimate Movie Toons&quot;, broadcast 28 March 2010.
The first single from David&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Signed Sealed Delivered&quot; was &quot;One More Lie (Standing in the Shadows)&quot; and it was released in the UK on 22 March 2010 where it made number 76 with the album following one week later on 29 March 2010, which entered the UK chart at number 13.

On 17 March 2010, David released a UK garage compilation album titled &quot;Rewind Old Skool Classics&quot; mixed with DJ Spoony featuring some of their favourite UK garage hits from the last ten years.

Two weeks later on 31 May 2010, the second single to be taken from &quot;Signed Sealed Delivered&quot;, titled &quot;All Alone Tonight (Stop, Look, Listen)&quot; was released. The chorus of the single samples the Stylistics&#x27; hit &quot;Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart)&quot; but features completely new verses. In the weeks leading up to the release, BBC Radio Two backed the single by naming it their &#x27;Record of the Week&#x27; and adding it to their &#x27;A-List&#x27;. On 20 May 2010, David appeared as a co-host on &quot;The Morning Show&quot; in Australia alongside Kylie Gillies, whilst regular male presenter Larry Emdur was on holiday. On 27 August 2010, Swiss DJ Remady released an album titled &quot;No Superstar&quot; on which David features on the track &quot;Do It on My Own&quot;. David was nominated for &#x27;Best Video&#x27; at the 2010 Urban Music Awards for the song &quot;One More Lie (Standing in the Shadows)&quot;. The 2010 &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List indicated that Craig David was worth £8 million.
David revealed on Twitter that he had worked with record producer Jim Beanz on material for his new album. He also tweeted about working with August Rigo and more recently Fraser T. Smith. Whilst doing a show in Russia, David confirmed he had left Universal Music Group and hopes to release his new album in America as well as the UK. In February 2011, David agreed to do a desert trek for Comic Relief as part of Red Nose Day 2011. A host of celebrities including Dermot O&#x27;Leary, Olly Murs and Lorraine Kelly trekked 100 kilometres across a Kenyan desert to raise money for preventable blindness across Africa.

In May 2011, David made a guest appearance on NRJ12&#x27;s French reality TV show &quot;Les Anges 2&quot; where he offered advice to contestants trying to make a life in Miami. Released on 1 August 2011, David featured on Erick Morillo&#x27;s new mix CD &quot;Subliminal Invasion&quot; on the track &quot;Fly Away&quot;. David performed at the Michael Jackson tribute concert, held in Cardiff at the Millennium Stadium on 8 October 2011.

Further to their earlier collaboration, David and Erick Morillo also canvassed a promotional track to DJs and radio stations titled &quot;Get Drunk Up&quot; and also featured it on YouTube. Morillo revealed David would appear on a project with Harry Romero and José Nunez, featuring a remix of the track. In December, he featured on the Blackout Mode dance track &quot;Freak on the Dancefloor&quot; that appeared on the compilation album &quot;R&amp;B Collection 2012&quot;.

In September 2024 David released the single &quot;In Your Hands&quot;, based on the children&#x27;s song &quot;He&#x27;s Got the Whole World in His Hands&quot;.

==Publishing deals==
On 9 September 2020, David signed a global publishing deal with New York-based Round Hill Music. The agreement includes all of David&#x27;s music catalogue to date, and also includes a futures agreement that will see all of his new music administered by the company.

==Caricature on &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot;==
David was frequently caricatured by comedian Leigh Francis on the British TV comedy show &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot;; the show&#x27;s title itself being a reference to his song &quot;Re-Rewind (The Crowd Say Bo Selecta)&quot;. Although many other celebrities lampooned in the series appreciated the jokes and even appeared in the series themselves, David—the series&#x27; most prominently mocked target—did not enjoy the attention, remarking that the public were no longer taking him seriously. Speaking to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 2007, David said that &quot;The whole &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot; thing was killing me for a while because this idiot had a cult following and I was the main caricature. ... Inside it was absolutely pissing me off and hurtful beyond belief. There were times when I thought I just want to knock this guy out&quot;.

Although he made an appearance himself on the programme (as the pseudo-fictional tribute act &quot;Craig Davis&quot;), he regretted it. However, he has also denied that his career had been ruined as a result of the show, and has said that he was satisfied with his musical output over the years.

In a 2015 interview with the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, David stated that he had no hard feelings towards Francis, explaining how he had seen him at a wedding and given him a hug, assuring him they were &quot;cool&quot;. He further explained in the interview that it was his PR team who suggested that he &quot;play hurt&quot; by the caricature. He reiterated this stance on &quot;The Jonathan Ross Show&quot; in 2016 and explained that, contrary to popular belief, he had not fled the UK to escape negative attention brought about from the show.

In June 2020, Francis apologised for his portrayal of David (among other black and mixed race celebrities such as Michael Jackson, Mel B and Trisha Goddard) in the show as a response to the Black Lives Matter movement and George Floyd protests, stating that &quot;I want to say sorry for any upset I caused whether I was Michael Jackson, Craig David or Trisha Goddard... all people who I am a big fan of.&quot; &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot; was removed from the video on demand service All 4 later that same month for similar reasons.

David raised the topic again in October 2022. &quot;Every sketch felt personal&quot;, he told &quot;The Times&quot;. &quot;It felt like a vendetta and when it got a following, it became something that affected me. People would shout at me on the street and I felt the same feeling I had when I was bullied at school. Leigh Francis had normalised bullying by making it comedy. When he put blackface on, that was being racist. We can all apologise when on the back foot. Has he reached out to any of the people he did on his show? He hasn&#x27;t reached out to me. Has he gone to communities to talk about bullying? Racism? And to be educated? You can only ask him.&quot;

==Personal life and activism==
David is Jewish.

He is an avid supporter of Southampton F.C., his hometown football team.

On 24 March 2010 (World Tuberculosis Day), the World Health Organization appointed Craig David as a Goodwill Ambassador against tuberculosis. His first activity in this role was to travel to South Africa to learn more about tuberculosis, where he met people suffering from the disease and those who have recovered, and scientists who have dedicated their lives to fighting tuberculosis. David stated that his mission is to help overcome the social stigma of TB in order to combat the disease. He has also been criticised by Action on Smoking and Health in 2013 for appearing in another Big Tobacco–funded appearance in Penang, Malaysia, where Japan Tobacco International sponsored a concert.

In January 2021 it was announced that Craig David would appear in an esports series in a campaign with McLaren and British American Tobacco (BAT) in order to enable them to reach their customers &quot;in new, exciting and engaging ways&quot; to push the nicotine pouch brand VELO. He appears in the series alongside other UK stars including presenter Rory Reid and Fred Sirieix.

In October 2022, David released a track titled &quot;Better Days (I Came by Train)&quot; in association with Trainline to encourage use of trains instead of flying or driving to lower CO2 emissions and save the planet.

<text>David Bates (March 6, 1809 – January 25, 1870) was an American poet.

He was born in Indian Hill, Ohio, and educated in Buffalo, New York, before working in first Indianapolis then Philadelphia. In 1849, he published a volume of poetry, &quot;Eolian&quot;.

Among his best-known works are &quot;Speak Gently&quot;, which was parodied by Lewis Carroll in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, as well as &quot;Chiding&quot;, and &quot;Childhood&quot;.

He started his adult life as a lowly clerk but, through hard work and determination, made his way in the business and eventually became a full member and chief buyer for an Indianapolis mercantile house. Apart from that Bates had a talent for writing easy going, gentle poetry and, at the age of 40, he had a collection of poems published under the title Eolian. One of the best known poems in this collection – Speak Gently – has become something of a universal hymn for people all over the world.

<doc id="636424" wikidata="Q804658" url="?curid=636424" title="Manilkara bidentata">
<text>Manilkara bidentata is a species of &quot;Manilkara&quot; native to a large area of northern South America, Central America and the Caribbean. Common names include bulletwood, balatá, ausubo, massaranduba, quinilla, and (ambiguously) &quot;cow-tree&quot;.

==Description==
The balatá is a large tree, growing to tall. The leaves are alternate, elliptical, entire, and long. The flowers are white, and are produced at the beginning of the rainy season. The fruit is a yellow berry, in diameter, which is edible; it contains one (occasionally two) seed(s). Its latex is used industrially for products such as chicle.

==Uses==
The latex is extracted in the same manner in which sap is extracted from the rubber tree. It is then dried to form an inelastic rubber-like material. It is almost identical to gutta-percha (produced from a closely related southeast Asian tree), and is sometimes called &quot;gutta-balatá&quot;.

Balatá was often used in the production of high-quality golf balls, to use as the outer layer of the ball. Balatá-covered balls have a high spin rate, but do not travel as far as most balls with a Surlyn cover. Due to the nondurable nature of the material the golf club strikes, balatá-covered balls do not last long before needing to be replaced. While once favored by professional and low-handicap players, they are now obsolete, replaced by newer Surlyn and urethane technology.

In 1943, Major League Baseball used balata instead of rubber in its baseballs due to wartime rationing. The balata balls initially displayed significantly less resilience (bounce) than rubber-core balls, forcing MLB to reformulate the balata-ball design several weeks into the season. MLB resumed using rubber in 1944.

Today, Brazil is the largest producer of Massaranduba wood, where it is cut in the Amazon rainforest.

The tree is a hardwood with a red heart, which is used for furniture and as a construction material where it grows. Locals often refer to it as bulletwood for its extremely hard wood, which is so dense that it does not float in water. Drilling is necessary to drive nailed connections. In trade, it is occasionally (and incorrectly) called &quot;brazilwood&quot;.

The fruit, like that of the related sapodilla (&quot;M. zapota&quot;), is edible.

Though its heartwood may present in a shade of purple, &quot;Manilkara bidentata&quot; should not be confused with another tropical tree widely known as &quot;purpleheart&quot;, &quot;Peltogyne pubescens&quot;.

This timber is being used to produce outdoor furniture and is being marketed as &quot;Pacific Jarrah&quot; in Australia.

<doc id="636427" wikidata="Q6734194" url="?curid=636427" title="Mahler's compactness theorem">
<text>In mathematics, Mahler&#x27;s compactness theorem, proved by , is a foundational result on lattices in Euclidean space, characterising sets of lattices that are &#x27;bounded&#x27; in a certain definite sense. Looked at another way, it explains the ways in which a lattice could degenerate (&quot;go off to infinity&quot;) in a sequence of lattices. In intuitive terms it says that this is possible in just two ways: becoming &quot;coarse-grained&quot; with a fundamental domain that has ever larger volume; or containing shorter and shorter vectors. It is also called his selection theorem, following an older convention used in naming compactness theorems, because they were formulated in terms of sequential compactness (the possibility of selecting a convergent subsequence).

Let &quot;X&quot; be the space

:formula_1

that parametrises lattices in formula_2, with its quotient topology. There is a well-defined function Δ on &quot;X&quot;, which is the absolute value of the determinant of a matrix – this is constant on the cosets, since an invertible integer matrix has determinant 1 or −1.

Mahler&#x27;s compactness theorem states that a subset &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is relatively compact if and only if Δ is bounded on &quot;Y&quot;, and there is a neighbourhood &quot;N&quot; of 0 in formula_2 such that for all Λ in &quot;Y&quot;, the only lattice point of Λ in &quot;N&quot; is 0 itself.

The assertion of Mahler&#x27;s theorem is equivalent to the compactness of the space of unit-covolume lattices in formula_2 whose systole is larger or equal than any fixed formula_5.

Mahler&#x27;s compactness theorem was generalized to semisimple Lie groups by David Mumford; see Mumford&#x27;s compactness theorem.

<text>Pachmarhi is a hill station in the Hoshangabad district of Madhya Pradesh state of central India. It has been the location of a cantonment (Pachmarhi Cantonment) since the British Raj. The municipality is located in a valley of the Satpura Range and is widely known as &quot;Satpura ki Rani.&quot; (&quot;Queen of Satpura&quot;)

Pachmarhi has an altitude of 1067. Dhupgarh, the highest point (1,352 meters) in Madhya Pradesh and the Satpura range, is located nearby. The town is wholly located within the Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve and the Satpura Tiger Reserve.

==History==
Pachmarhi contains several caves including hilltop caves. The community&#x27;s name is believed to be derived from the Hindi words &quot;Panch&quot; (&quot;five&quot;) and &quot;Marhi&quot; (&quot;caves&quot;). According to a legend, these caves were built by five Pandava brothers of Mahabharatha era during their thirteen years of exile

The region was part of the Bhonsle Kingdom and was later ruled by the Marathas in the 18th century.

It was later part of the Gondi kingdom of Bhagvat Singh in the 19th century, although there was no permanent settlement at that time. The origins of modern Panchmarhi can be traced back to 1857, when Captain James Forsyth of the British Army and Subhedar Major Nathoo Ramji Powar noticed the plateau while en route to Jhansi. It quickly developed into a hill station and sanatorium for British troops in the Central Provinces of India, and Powar was made Kotwal. (a person in charge of the armoury) 

In 1901, the year-round population was 3,020, with a population of double this number during the hot summer months. Pachmarhi served as the summer capital for the Central Provinces.

UNESCO added the Pachmarhi area to its list of Biosphere Reserves in May 2009, due to the many rare plant species in the vicinity. The total area of Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve is 4981.72 km2, and it is located at latitude 22° 11’ to 22° 50’N and longitude 77° 47’ to 78° 52’E. The reserve spans parts of three civil districts, viz; Hoshangabad (59.55%), Chhindwara (29.19%) and Betul (11.26%). It includes three wildlife conservation units viz., Bori Sanctuary 485.72 km2), Satpura National Park (524.37 km2) and Pachmarhi Sanctuary (491.63 km2).

==Town==
Pachmarhi is a small community, and most of its land area is under the administration of the Pachmarhi Cantonment Board, which serves the Indian Army. The Indian Army Education Corps (AEC) are located in the community.

As of 2011 Indian census, Pachmarhi had a population of about 12,062. Most are employed by the army, or in forestry or tourism industries.

An airstrip and helipad located between the town and the mountain of Dhupgarh. The airstrip has been described as being seldom used, overrun with grass, and frequented by wild animals such as tigers and bison.

==Climate==
Pachmarhi&#x27;s climate is mild, with temperatures ranging from warm to cool, with a Köppen and Geiger classification of Cwa. (humid subtropical) Summers have significantly more rainfall than winters. The town&#x27;s average temperature is 21.7 °C and the average annual rainfall in is 2012 milimeters. May is the hottest month of the year, with an average temperature of 30.3 °C, while December is the coldest month of the year, with an average temperature of 15.5 °C.

==Tourism==



Pachmarhi has a significant tourist industry and there are numerous hotels as well as a few cottages and resorts. Many tourists come to see the local cave pavements, some of which are estimated to be 10,000 years old. Tourists also tend to visit the Pandav caves and the local wilderness, much of which is preserved due to governmental limitations on new construction. Many visitors also go paragliding and boating.

Some of the places of tourist interest there are:

*Rajat Prapat (large waterfall)
*Bee Fall

===Wildlife===
The Satpura Tiger Reserve contains several large mammal species, including the tiger, leopard, wild boar, gaur (&quot;Bos gaurus&quot;), chital deer (&quot;Axis axis&quot;), muntjac deer, sambar deer (&quot;Cervus unicolor&quot;), and rhesus macaques.

The endemic fauna also includes chinkara, nilgai, wild dogs, the Indian wolf, bison, Indian giant squirrels, and flying squirrels.

===Biosphere===
The forests of Pachmarhi have many fruit trees such as mangoes, jamun, custard fruit, and lesser-known local fruits such as khatua, tendu, chunna, khinni, and chaar. Oak and blue pine are also abundant, and additionally, the forest is also known for having many medicinal plants and herbs.

===Dhupgarh===
The Satpura Range&#x27;s highest point is 1,352 m. It&#x27;s well-known for its sunrise and sunset views. At night, one can see the lights of neighbouring towns such as Itarsi. The summit can be reached by road or by foot.

===Chauragarh===

This is the third highest peak in the Satpura ranges. It is a pilgrimage site with Lord Siva&#x27;s temple at the top. The Chauragarh fort there was built by king Sangram Shah of the Gond dynasty. It was developed by SenaSahebSubha Janoji Maharaj of Nagpur। from the Maratha Era the Pilgrimage from Nagpur Start।. It is also a widely known spot for sunrise viewing. During the festivities of Nagpanchami and Mahashivratri, devotees flock to Chauragarh temple in large numbers, leaving about 2 lakh &quot;trishuls&quot; as offerings which are kept in front of the temple and also in the way of the temple.

===Bee Hill and Bee Falls===
This is a waterfall in Pachmarhi. It is so named because from a distance the waterfall sounds like a bee. Bee Falls takes its name from bees since this place is famous for honeybees.

=== Dutchess Fall ===
This waterfall is the most remote. There are Doctor Fish in the pool made by the waterfall. The road to this waterfall is extreme, with very steep inclinations. There is straight downward trekking of 1 km.

===PanarPani===
Panarpani has a natural freshwater lake with forest around it.

===Sangam===
This is a conflux of mountain streams behind Dhupgarh. The water in these streams is crystal clear in all seasons except of course autumn.

===Jatashankar and Mahadev caves===
These are mountain caves with fresh water dripping from them. Mountains feed the streams with fresh water, that they soak in during autumn. As the name suggests, these caves and many others are the abode of lord Siva.

===Silver Falls===
Also called Rajat Prapat/Big Fall. The falls drop over 2800 feet through the gorge, leaving a silver streak behind that gives its name .

===Apsara Vihar===

This is a mountain stream that creates a natural water pool, cascades and waterfall in its course.

===Other waterfalls===

Pachmarhi&#x27;s ecosystem includes other waterfalls such as Little Fall.

New year event in Pachmarhi utsav

<text>Balata Camp () is a Palestinian refugee camp established in the northern West Bank in 1950, adjacent to Balata village on the outskirts of the city of Nablus. Balata Camp had a population of 14,635 in 2017.

==History==
In 1950, the UN gave the refugees from the Jaffa area temporary housing. These people initially refused the UN&#x27;s offers, stating their eagerness to return to their homes. They desired no sense of permanence. After two years, they accepted the offer and settled at Balata. In 1956, the Jaffa refugees desired more permanent housing. After the border with the State of Israel was sealed, the refugees moved into concrete housing that replaced the original tents.

==Education and culture==
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) funds a school in the Balata camp, with approximately 5,000 pupils.
The Yaffa Cultural Center in Balata operates a guesthouse, children&#x27;s theater and cinema, children&#x27;s library and media center. The American NGO, Tomorrow&#x27;s Youth Organization, also operates classes for children from Balata.

==Political violence==
In the 1980s and 1990s, Balata residents played a leading role in the uprising known as the First Intifada. In November 2007, Palestinian National Authority police officers climbed rooftops in Balata and engaged in gun battles with militants of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades who had turned the camp into a military stronghold. Five residents and a policeman were wounded in the shooting.

<text>The Crusader is the debut studio album by New Zealand rapper Scribe. Scribe recorded his debut album in 2003. Dirty Records released the album, with distribution through Festival Mushroom Records.

==Critical reception==
Andrew Hughes of &quot;NZ Musician&quot; called &quot;The Crusader&quot; &quot;undoubtedly the best NZ hip-hop album to date, consistent the whole way through&quot;.

&quot;The Crusader&quot; won Album of the Year, Best Urban/Hip-hop Album and Best Male Solo Artist at the New Zealand Music Awards in 2004.

==Commercial reception==
&quot;The Crusader&quot; debuted at number one on the New Zealand Albums Chart, slipping to number two the next week.

The week that the album entered the chart, &quot;Stand Up&quot;/&quot;Not Many&quot;, the first single off the album, was number one on the New Zealand Singles Chart. This was the first time in the charts&#x27; histories that a New Zealand artist simultaneously topped the singles and albums chart.

In Australia, the album debuted on the Australian Albums Chart at number forty-four. Ten months later, it peaked at number twelve. It was certified platinum, shipping over 70,000 copies.

==Singles==
All of the singles from the album were double A-sides. The first, &quot;Stand Up/&quot;Not Many&quot;, spent twelve weeks at number one on the New Zealand Singles Chart. It was certified double platinum.
The second single was &quot;Not Many – The Remix&quot;/&quot;Stand Up&quot;. It included a remix of &quot;Not Many&quot;, and &quot;Stand Up&quot;, and went to number two on the New Zealand Singles Chart. It also appeared on the Australian Singles Chart, peaking at number twenty-one. It later went gold in Australia.
&quot;Dreaming&quot;/&quot;So Nice&quot; was the third single, and also topped the New Zealand Singles Chart. It peaked at number twenty-three on the Australian Singles Chart.

Working at University College London from 1945 until 1951, he then returned once more to the Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast where he founded the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. Although he officially retired in 1982 he continued to work in the department as an emeritus professor until his death.

<doc id="636462" wikidata="Q245273" url="?curid=636462" title="Aetolian League">
<text>The Aetolian (or Aitolian) League () was a confederation of tribal communities and cities in ancient Greece centered in Aetolia in Central Greece. It was probably established during the early Hellenistic era, in opposition to Macedon and the Achaean League. Two annual meetings were held at Thermon and Panaetolika. The league occupied Delphi from 290 BC and steadily gained territory until, by the end of the 3rd century BC, it controlled the whole of central Greece with the exception of Attica and Boeotia. At its peak, the league&#x27;s territory included Locris, Malis, Dolopes, parts of Thessaly, Phocis, and Acarnania. In the latter part of its power, certain Greek city-states joined the Aetolian League such as the Arcadian cities of Mantineia, Tegea, Phigalia and Kydonia on Crete.

During the classical period the Aetolians were not highly regarded by other Greeks, who considered them to be semi-barbaric and reckless. Their League had a complex political and administrative structure, and their armies were easily a match for the other Greek powers. However, during the Hellenistic period, they emerged as a dominant state in central Greece and expanded by the voluntary annexation of several Greek city-states to the League. Still, the Aetolian League had to fight against Macedonia and were driven to an alliance with Rome, which resulted in the final conquest of Greece by the Romans.

== History ==

The Aetolians were a recognised ethnic group with a religious centre at Thermos from at least the seventh century BC. 
During the Peloponnesian War, the Aetolians were initially neutral, but when the Athenians tried to invade Aetolia in 426 BC, the Aetolians forced them to retreat. In the course of the fourth century, the league offered passive support to more powerful states and was rewarded for it, receiving Aeolis from the Thebans in 367 BC and Naupactus from Philip II of Macedon in 338 BC. Sometime in this century, the Koinon tōn Aitōlōn (League of the Aetolians) was founded, but it is uncertain when. One suggestion is that the league was founded by Epaminondas in 367 BC. Grainger believes that it was founded much later, around the time of the rise of Philip II of Macedon. Archaeology indicates that settlements in Aetolia began to grow in size and complexity over the course of this century.

After the death of Philip II in 336 BC, the Aetolians joined the Thebans in opposing Alexander the Great and the stress of their defeat caused the league to implode. Over the next decade it seems to have been reconstituted and in the later years of Alexander&#x27;s reign the Aetolians seized Oeniadae against his will. 

The Aetolian League joined the Athenians in the Lamian war against Antipater which broke out after Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC and continued to oppose Macedonian power throughout the Wars of the Diadochi, participating in invasions of Macedon in 320, 316/5 and 313 BC. Around 301 BC, the Aetolians took control of Parnassus, including the panhellenic sanctuary of Delphi, which they would continue to control for over a century. Demetrius Poliorcetes launched the Fifth Sacred War, 289-287 BC, in an attempt to remove them, but was defeated and driven from Macedonia altogether with the help of Pyrrhus of Epirus. A Sixth Sacred War, 281 BC, led by Areus I was rebuffed by the Aetolians alone and in 280 BC, they took control of Heraclea in Trachis, which gave them control over the crucial pass at Thermopylae.

In 279 BC, they were victorious in battle against the Gauls, who had invaded Greece and were threatening the sanctuary of Delphi. After their victory they earned the appreciation of the rest of the Greeks and they were admitted as a new member into the Amphictyonic League.

In 232 BC, the Illyrians under Agron attacked the Aetolians, and managed to take many prisoners and booty.

In 229 BC, the Aetolians participated in a naval battle off the island of Paxos in a coalition with Korkyra and the Achaean League, and were defeated by a coalition of Illyrians and Acarnanians; as a result, the Korkyreans were forced to accept an Illyrian garrison in their city, which was put under the command of Demetrius of Pharos.

In the Social War, 220-217 BC, the Aetolian League fought against the Kingdom of Macedonia. Philip V of Macedon invaded Aetolia and sacked the city of Thermos as a response to the Aetolians&#x27; invasion at the city of Dodona in Epirus.

The league was the first Greek ally of the Roman Republic, siding with the Romans during the First Macedonian War, 215-205 BC, and helping to defeat Philip V of Macedon at the Battle of Cynoscephalae in 197 BC, during the Second Macedonian War. However, it grew increasingly hostile to Roman involvement in Greek affairs and only a few years later sided with Antiochus III, the anti-Roman king of the Seleucid Empire, during the Roman-Syrian War. The defeat of Antiochus in 189 BC robbed the league of its principal foreign ally and made it impossible to stand alone in continued opposition to Rome. The league was forced to sign a peace treaty with Rome that made it a subject ally of the republic. Although it continued to exist in name, the power of the league was broken by the treaty and it never again constituted a significant political or military force.

==Administrative system==
The league had a federal structure, which could raise armies and conduct foreign policy on a common basis. It also implemented economic standardization, levying taxes, using a common currency and adopting a uniform system of weights and measures. There may not have been any central archive of state documents. However, the constituent communities of the league enjoyed substantial autonomy. At times the league was unable (or unwilling) to prevent its members from undertaking military actions against states that had treaties with it. The league members were grouped together in a number of &quot;tele&quot; (districts), which seem to have had administrative and juridical powers of some sort. 
The league&#x27;s central administrative apparatus consisted of an assembly, a council, and a number of magistrates. The &quot;Ekklesia&quot; (Assembly) was open to all citizens of all member communities of the league. The assembly was the ultimate authority within the league, with responsibility for declarations of war and peace, but its power was limited by the infrequency with which it met. Two meetings took place a year, one at the Thermica festival which was held at Thermos on the autumnal equinox and another in spring at the Panaetolica festival which took place at a different site each year. Emergency meetings could also be called.

The exact competencies of the Council, referred to as a &quot;boula&quot; or synedrion in different documents, relative to the Assembly are not clear. It consisted of delegates elected by each of the constituent communities of the league in proportion to their size. By the late third century BC it had around 1500 members - too large for it to have been in continuous session. A small portion of the council&#x27;s members, known as the &quot;apokletoi&quot; (&quot;Select-men&quot;), conducted day-to-day business, such as sending and receiving embassies.

The league&#x27;s &quot;archons&quot; (magistrates) were elected by the assembly each year at the Thermica. The chief executive was the &quot;strategos&quot; (General), who commanded the league&#x27;s armies, received all diplomatic contacts from other states in first instance, and presided over meetings of the assembly, the council, and the select-men. The office could be held multiple times, but only after an interval of, probably, four years. The &quot;hipparchos&quot; (Cavalry Commander), originally a minor post, became the General&#x27;s deputy from the late 260s BC, but his exact responsibilities are not clear. The third in command was the &quot;Grammateus&quot; (&quot;Secretary&quot;). These three officials were Eponymous archons (eponymous magistrates), which is to say that they were named in the dating formula for all decrees of the league. From around 260 BC, there were also seven &quot;tamiai&quot; (Treasurers) and seven &quot;epilektarchoi&quot; (Commanders of the Elite), who managed financial and military matters respectively. There were a number of &quot;boularchoi&quot; (Council Commanders) who seem to have been a steering committee for the Council. When these first appear in the 260s, there were two of them, but by the end of the third century BC they had risen to six or more, presumably as a result of the continued expansion of the league&#x27;s membership (and thus of the size of the Council).

From 278 the league sent delegates to the Amphictyonic League (Delphic Amphictyony), gradually increasing over time until the league held a majority of the seats on the council, which increasingly became an instrument of Aetolian power projection. From the 260s, the secretary of the Amphictyonic council was always an Aetolian. These delegates seem to have been elected along with the other magistrates at the Thermica, but their relative rank is not clear.

==Piracy==
The Aetolian League acquired a reputation for piracy and brigandage. Though some historians recognize a pro-Achaean bias in the portrayal of the League by Polybius, many modern historians also accept his portrayal as largely justified. For example, Walbank is explicit in seeing the Aetolians as systematically using piracy to supplement their income due to the meager resources of their region and Will simply assumes the truth of the charge.

By contrast, Grainger concludes that Aetolian involvement in piracy appears unlikely given that they lacked the necessary ships.

<doc id="636466" wikidata="Q4741716" url="?curid=636466" title="Ambresbury Banks">
<text>Ambresbury Banks is the name given to the remains of an Iron Age hill fort in Epping Forest, Essex, England. It lies in &#x27;Long Running &amp; Ambresbury Banks&#x27;, south of Bell Common and north of Loughton and its neighbouring hillfort Loughton Camp. It is a Scheduled Monument. Its surrounding forest is a Special Area of Conservation and Site of Special Scientific Interest.

== Investigation ==
The first dig at Ambresbury Banks was initiated by the Essex Field Club in 1881, under general Augustus Pitt Rivers. Another dig under Hazzeldine Warren in 1933 found sherds of pottery. In 1971 &amp; 2 Iron Age gold coins were found near the Banks using a metal detector. Flints and an arrowhead have also been found at the site Materials including a clay smoking pipe and a horseshoe have been recovered at the site.

==Description==
The univallate fort encloses an area of roughly 5 hectares. In the Middle Ages it was &quot;used for quarrying&quot;.

==Legend==
According to legend, it is the site of the last stand by Boudica against the Romans in the year 61. There is no evidence to support this. Another legend contends that the construction and name derive from the fifth-century hero Ambrosius Aurelianus, so contradicting the supposed connection to the first-century battle; other theories for the location of the battlefield include Mancetter in Warwickshire and Kings Cross in London. Nevertheless, Ambresbury Banks forms, along with Loughton Camp, Wallbury Camp, Little Hadham, Barkway and Littlebury, a line of hill-forts that arguably delineate the disputed territories of the warring Trinovantes and Catuvellauni.

== Access to the site ==
In June 2006 Loughton Camp, Loughton Brook, and Ambresbury Banks were &quot;designated as out of bounds to cyclists&quot; due to damage to the sites.

<doc id="636471" wikidata="Q7989177" url="?curid=636471" title="Westminster Larger Catechism">
<text>The Westminster Larger Catechism, along with the Westminster Shorter Catechism, is a central catechism of Calvinists in the English tradition throughout the world.

== History ==
In 1643 when the Long Parliament of England called the Westminster Assembly to produce the Westminster Confession, it also asked for a directory of &quot;catechising&quot;. The Assembly asked Herbert Palmer to produce a draft of the Larger Catechism. Robert Baillie and other Scottish delegates found the work disappointing. In December 1643 a committee was formed to write the Catechism. In January 1647 the Assembly gave up writing one catechism and split it into two. The Westminster Shorter Catechism was to be &quot;easier to read and concise for beginners&quot; and the Larger Catechism was to be &quot;more exact and comprehensive&quot;. The Catechism was completed by the Westminster Assembly in 1647. It was then adopted by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1648 and (with modifications relating to the civil magistrate) by the Presbyterian Synod of New York and Philadelphia in 1788, and by the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., upon its formation the following year. In 1967, it was dropped by the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. in the formulation of their &quot;Book of Confessions&quot;. However, it was embraced by the successor denominations such as the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) in that church&#x27;s &quot;Book of Confessions&quot; as well as the more conservative successors, the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, the Evangelical Presbyterian Church, and the Bible Presbyterian Church.

==Form and content==
The purpose of the Larger Catechism was to help ministers prepare their own catechesis, as they taught the faith to their congregations in preaching, while the purpose of the Shorter Catechism was to educate children and others &quot;of weaker capacity&quot; (according to a preface written by the Church of Scotland) in the Reformed faith. Both the Larger and Shorter Catechisms are in a question and answer format, which had been popularized by Martin Luther as a way to help children learn the meaning of the material, rather than simply memorizing the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, Ten Commandments, and Apostles&#x27; Creed as had been the practice prior to the Reformation. 

Being the larger of the two catechisms, the questions and answers go into much greater detail than the Shorter Catechism is summarizing the chief points of doctrine explained in the Westminster Confession. The Larger Catechism consists of 196 questions and answers. The first set of questions and answers, 1-5, concern the chief and highest end of man, the existence of God, and the Holy Scriptures as the Word of God. The next set of questions and answers, 6-90, concern God as Creator, original sin, the fallen state of man&#x27;s nature, Christ the Redeemer, and the benefits that flow from redemption. Following that, the next set of questions, 91-152, discuss the duty God requires of man, as summarized in the Ten Commandments. Questions 153-177 concern the outward and ordinary means of grace, especially the preaching of the Word of God and the Sacraments of Baptism and Holy Communion. The final set of questions, 178–196, teach and explain prayer, using the Lord&#x27;s Prayer as a model. This organization mimics the earlier Heidelberg Catechism used by many Continental Reformed churches.

<doc id="636475" wikidata="Q2390424" url="?curid=636475" title="African Hebrew Israelites in Israel">
<text>The African Hebrew Israelites in Israel comprise a new religious movement that is now mainly based in Dimona. Officially self-identifying as the African Hebrew Israelite Nation of Jerusalem, they originate from African American Ben Carter who later Renamed Himself to Ben Ammi Ben-Israel who immigrated to the State of Israel in the late 1960s (Around 1966). The community claims Israelite descent in line with the philosophy of the Black Hebrew Israelites, who believe that Black people in the United States are descended from the Twelve Tribes of Israel and thus rightfully belong to the Land of Israel. , their total population stood at about 5,000 people.

Believing that they were Jews by blood (i.e., through the Hebrews or Israelites), the community first settled in Liberia, where they were not welcomed by the Liberian government. Later moving to Israel, they were recognized as non-Jews by the Israeli government and by Israeli religious authorities. A number of the African Hebrew Israelites were illegal immigrants in Israel and were thus deported, prompting allegations from the community that the Israeli government&#x27;s conduct against them was racist. Since 2004, however, some African Hebrew Israelites have been granted permanent residency and have enlisted in the Israel Defense Forces.

Many of the community&#x27;s beliefs were developed on the basis of revelations experienced by African-American steel worker Ben Carter, who claimed that the angel Gabriel had called on him to return his people—the &quot;true&quot; Children of Israel—to what is often referred to as the Holy Land in the Abrahamic religions. Born a Baptist Christian, Carter later changed his name to Ben Ammi Ben-Israel () and began rallying other African Americans to his cause. He rejected Judaism and Christianity, but asserted that the Jewish Bible was still divine and claimed that Abraham and Moses were Black people, while also perceiving Jesus as one of many messiahs. Some of Carter&#x27;s statements and the community&#x27;s beliefs have led to accusations of antisemitism against them: he alleged that there was an international Jewish conspiracy through which the Israeli government maintained control over the Holy Land. Claiming that Black people were the &quot;true inheritors of Israel&quot; suffering under &quot;Euro-gentile dominion&quot; in the United States, Carter stated that Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs in the Holy Land had a false tradition of being descended from Isaac and Ishmael, respectively, and were instead descended from European Crusaders.

== Origins ==

The group was founded in Chicago by former steel worker Ben Carter (1939–2014, also known as Ben Ammi Ben-Israel). In his early twenties Carter was given the name Ben Ammi by Rabbi Reuben of the Chicago Congregation of Ethiopian Hebrews (Not Beta Israel). Ben Ammi was working in an airline factory when he first discovered the Black Hebrew movement and its philosophy. According to Ben Ammi, in 1966, at the age of 27, he had a vision in which the Archangel Gabriel called him to take his people, African Americans, back to the Holy Land of Israel.

Ammi and his followers draw on a long tradition in black American culture which is based on the belief that black Americans are the descendants of the Ancient Israelites (Ammi cites Charles Harrison Mason of Mississippi, William Saunders Crowdy of Virginia, Bishop William Boome of Tennessee, Charles Price Jones of Mississippi, and Elder Saint Samuel of Tennessee as early exponents of black descent from the Israelites).

They are also influenced by the teachings of the Jamaican proponent of Black nationalism, Marcus Garvey (1887–1940), and the black civil rights milieu in 1960s America, including figures such as the Black Panthers and Malcolm X. From these figures and their teachings, they have incorporated elements of black separatism as well as the doctrine which advocates the repatriation of the African Diaspora to its ancestral lands in a &quot;return to Africa&quot;, of which they consider Israel to be a part. To them, Israel is located in Northeast Africa instead of West Asia.

The inspiration to move to Israel was born from several components. One component was the hardship which black community members faced within America as well as within American culture, especially in Chicago in the 1960s, at the height of the Civil rights movement. Another component was the community&#x27;s willingness to form a confident and positive African identity, as opposed to the damaging identity which the group felt it carried in America. The last component was this spout of religious and spiritual connection to a long-standing culture, an ancient history and a Promised Land. An additional factor may have been the expectation of a coming apocalyptic war in which America would be destroyed.

== Settlement in Liberia (1967–1969) ==
Ben Ammi and 350 of his followers first settled in Liberia in 1967. There, they built a community which adhered to the &quot;laws of righteousness&quot;. Prince Rakhamim, who was a community leader at that time, described what living in Liberia did for the community:

We chose to stay there about two and a half years in order to get rid of the foolishness of America before making way to the land of Israel. To make a person born again. To die from the hell we came out of, to get rid of it—to learn to get rid of the hate... to get rid of our bitterness... Liberia was always conceived as the place where we would learn to be righteous. Those of us who wanted to do right shedded off the hate and came home to Israel.

== Status in Israel ==
It is unclear whether Israel was always the end-goal for the community, or whether Ben Ammi received another vision in 1969, when the community was in Liberia, telling him to take the community to its real promised land: Israel. The African Hebrew Israelite community believes that this ambiguity does not lessen its desire to establish a home in Israel. The group aimed to immigrate to Israel under the Israeli Law of Return, which states that all Jews who emigrate to Israel will be granted citizenship. However, in order to qualify for citizenship under the Law of Return, a person must be born a Jew, or he or she must be the child or grandchild of a Jew, or he or she must have converted to Judaism, and he or she must not be an active member of another religion.

Because Ben Ammi and his followers did not meet this requirement, they did not qualify for Israeli citizenship. This deterrent did not stop them from moving to Israel. In 1969, the group began to move to Israel by using temporary visas. Most Black Hebrews entered Israel on tourist visas and they overstayed their visas by living in Israel as illegal immigrants.

Initially, the African Hebrew Israelites asserted that they were the only rightful heirs of the Land of Israel. They refused to convert to Judaism and they also asserted that most Israeli Jews were not the descendants of the ancient Israelites. By the late 1980s, the group tempered their beliefs. They came to see Israel as a nation of many cultures, races, and religions.

Members of the group continued to arrive and settle in the desert town of Dimona. For two decades, their population continued to grow through natural increase and illegal immigration. Throughout the 1970s, tensions between the group and the government grew as the group faced low employment, inadequate housing, and attempted deportations, while the government considered its members illegal aliens. Ben Ammi accused the government of practicing racism and he also accused it of occupying the holy land, he did this by claiming that &quot;The greatest conspiracy ever conceived in the minds of men was the creation of a National Homeland for Jewish People.&quot;

In 1973, the International League for the Rights of Man rejected the group&#x27;s claims, stating that the group made no attempt to comply with the citizenship laws of Israel. In 1981, a six-person Black Americans to Support Israel Committee delegation assessed all aspects of the treatment of the community and concluded that racism was not the cause of its problems. Although the delegation&#x27;s leader Bayard Rustin called Ben Ammi &quot;a dictator&quot; without &quot;the same moral standards as democratic leaders&quot;, the other members of the delegation disassociated themselves from Rustin&#x27;s accusation.

They are generally not considered Jews in Israel. The Israeli government especially in the past refused to grant the group citizenship, while occasionally pursuing deportation.

In May 1990, the group was granted tourist status and visas that permitted its members to work. In 1992, the Congressional Black Caucus of the United States Congress intervened, leading to the signing of an agreement which stated that the Black Hebrews would be granted temporary residency status if they did not receive new members. At the end of 2003, the group was granted permanent residency status by the Israeli Interior Ministry. It is believed that in 2009, Elyakim Ben-Israel became the first Black Hebrew to receive Israeli citizenship without converting to Judaism or marrying an Israeli. The Israeli government said that more Black Hebrews may be granted citizenship.

In 2004, Uriyahu Butler became the first member of the community to enlist in the Israel Defense Forces. The IDF agreed to accommodate some of the group&#x27;s religious requirements, especially its dietary requirements.

Today, young men and to a lesser degree young women from the African Hebrew community of Jerusalem serve in the IDF, and they have entered international sporting events and academic competitions under the Israeli flag, as well as having represented Israel twice in the Eurovision song contest.

== Way of life ==
The group maintains a vegan diet, citing Genesis 1:29, &quot;And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.&quot; They appear to have become vegan in the early 1970s, although some members were vegetarian prior. While they value non-violence, the primary motive for their veganism appears to be health-based: mirroring a Rabbinic tradition, they argue that meat-eating is linked to humanity&#x27;s fallen state, and must be overcome to attain righteousness. They practice abstinence from alcohol, other than the naturally fermented wine which they make themselves, as well as abstinence from both illegal and pharmaceutical drugs, so as to stay within the &quot;cycles of life&quot;.

The group grows much of its own food and its members are authorized to be organic growers by the Israel Bio-Organic Agricultural Association.

Members wear only clothing made from natural fibers, which are sewn by members of the community, and all must bear blue thread and fringes as mandated in the Bible (Deut.22:11-12, Num.15:37–40). Men wear a form of kippah (head-covering) and beards.

The group practices &quot;polygyny&quot;, meaning that a man can marry several wives (up to six). Within the community this is termed &quot;Divine Marriage&quot;, being based on Biblical examples such as King David. Polygyny is not required, constituting approximately 37% of marriages in 1992.

=== Beliefs ===

The group believes that the ancient Israelites are the ancestors of black Americans. It objects to the use of the term &#x27;Jew&#x27; based on its belief that black Americans are descended from all 12 tribes, not just the Tribe of Judah. Even though they reject the religious forms of both Judaism and Christianity, the Black Hebrews maintain the belief in the divine inspiration of the Tanakh, and they also value the New Testament as a record of the words of Yeshuah, one man in an ongoing line of &#x27;messiahs&#x27; who were sent by God to keep the people of Israel in the ways of righteousness.
The core of the group&#x27;s lifestyle is the Tanakh. Ben Ammi claims that &quot;the Law and the Prophets...are the light; they are the essence of what is required to set man on the path and show him the way back to his Maker.&quot; However, the group rejects the traditions of Rabbinic Judaism, including the Talmud, based on its belief that they are inauthentic as opposed to the Hebrew religion.

Ben Ammi claims that black Africans are the victims of &quot;a cruel plot to control us, an international religious plot that came about as a result of Blacks disobeying the law and commandments of God.&quot; The enslavement of black Africans is seen as punishment for straying from the righteous path and he cites an &quot;oral tradition that our people were cursed by God for violating His laws, statutes and commandments.&quot; He links this oral tradition to Deuteronomy 28:68, which speaks of a second captivity in a second Egypt which the Israelites would be carried to in ships. The &quot;Euro-gentile&quot; establishment hatched &quot;a deliberate scheme to conceal the truth that ancient Hebrews were Black&quot; and it also &quot;perpetuated the white Jesus deception&quot;.

In an attempt to overcome the history of slavery in the United States, Ammi argues that it is essential to &quot;reexamine and redefine all things...we must question every facet of existence under Euro-gentile dominion.&quot; The ability to name and classify the word and social concept which Ammi calls &quot;The Power to Define&quot;, which is in the wrong hands, is &quot;one of the greatest weapons that can be used to control men and nations,&quot; is the key to salvation from past oppression. Thus, Ammi claims that true freedom can never be found within a society that is intrinsically corrupt but can only be attained by establishing a new society based solely on the laws of God: &quot;No government, no party or system can bring salvation unto the Children of God...Their salvation is only of God.&quot;

Based on the Hebrew word &quot;eved&quot; (עבד, meaning &#x27;slave&#x27; or &#x27;servant&#x27;), Ammi has argued that the distinction between work and worship is false – in fact, the activity we pursue with our lives is both our work and our worship. Therefore, &quot;every job that does not enhance God as creator is the worship of the devil. There is no neutral position.&quot;

However, Ammi&#x27;s concern is not solely for his own people but for the whole of humanity – the role of the Black Hebrew Israelite community is to serve as &quot;a light unto the gentiles&quot;: &quot;Black Americans...were initially chosen by God to guide the world out of its state of ignorance.&quot; Recently the group has also begun to claim that Hebrew status is not solely from genealogy, but can be conferred by spiritual behaviour.

Ammi does not believe in the existence of an afterlife; he prefers to focus on life on earth: &quot;Heaven is the reality of the righteous as they live, not a place for spirits after death.&quot;

As well as claiming that Jews are not the descendants of the ancient Israelites, they also claim that the members of the Palestinian Arab population are not the descendants of Ishmael: &quot;Our studies and experience have shown that the present-day inhabitants of this region are not the original people of the land. The majority of those today defined by modern historians as Arabs, are veritably the descendents of European Crusaders.&quot;

The group believes that the value system of a society is seen through its culture. According to one source, it is therefore &quot;important that our clothing, music, food and language reflect the glory and the higher standards of Yah (God).&quot;

==Accusations of antisemitism==
On several occasions, Ben Ammi and the Black Hebrew community have been accused of anti-semitism. As well as denying the Israelite heritage of world Jewry and its claim to the land of Israel, the stalemate which existed between the Black Hebrew community and Israel in the late 1970s led to heightened tensions and according to &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, &quot;Ben Ammi mounted a worldwide public relations offensive against the government that dripped with anti-semitism. Community newspapers compared the Israelis to Nazis and they also included images of money-grubbing Jews and other stereotypical images&quot;. However, relations improved during the 1990s as the Black Hebrew community distanced itself from the ineffective extremist stance which it had taken up in earlier years. Since then, the group has become a valuable part of both the Dimona community and the wider Israeli society and it has also pursued integration in ways such as volunteering to serve in the IDF.

In 2011, the Georgia General Assembly passed a resolution which &quot;recognize(s) the Hebrew Israelite Community for its service to the nation of Israel and commends their 40 years of history.&quot; Citing the fact that the Dimona-based community is &quot;one of the largest urban kibbutzim in Israel&quot; and &quot;has attracted visitors from around the world because of its healthy lifestyle and organic agriculture,&quot; the Assembly concluded and declared that &quot;the culture and tradition of the Hebrew Israelite Community is a rich one, and the Community&#x27;s numerous contributions are worthy of recognition.&quot;

In response to concerns about anti-Jewish prejudice and stereotyping that arose during its formative years in Israel, community leader Prince Immanuel Ben Yehuda simply states that they have &quot;grown up.&quot; &quot;As you look back over 30 years you realize that this has grown from the ground up. We&#x27;ve been here 30 years, that means we&#x27;ve grown up together... Our children have gone to schools (and) played in games together so there is another kind of relationship that has grown up.&quot;

In August 2008, the Village of Peace received a visit from Israel&#x27;s president, Shimon Peres, who told the Hebrew Israelites &quot;Your community is beloved in Israel...You give the country happiness and song and hope for a better world&quot;

And in March, 2012, during the community&#x27;s annual &quot;New World Passover&quot; celebration in honor of their historic &quot;&quot; from America in 1967, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed appreciation for &quot;the cooperative society that is working towards the inclusion of the Hebrew Israelite community in Israeli society at large,&quot; and he also declared that their experience in the land is &quot;an integral part of the Israeli experience.&quot;

The Black Hebrews still express concerns as to the direction in which Israel is heading. During an interview with &quot;Haaretz&quot;, a popular Israeli newspaper, Ben Ammi stated that &quot;We must understand that peace will never come, and true freedom will never come, by way of politicians... There&#x27;s a major difference between the peace that was promised by the Creator and the peace that is being sought after by politicians.&quot; &quot;We do give advice to politicians; because these individuals who are seen as leaders, if they would hear a message based upon truth, then it would influence that which they say they seek after – and that is peace. But without truth, and without spirituality, there can never be any genuine peace achieved in those lands.&quot;

==Institutions==
The AHIJ’s institutions include:

The School of the Prophets, a higher education academy, incorporating an international branch, The Institute of Regenerative Truth.

The Dr Martin Luther King Jr/ SCLC Ben Ammi Institute for a New Humanity, a research center for the study of non-violence.

The Middle East African Diaspora Unity Council, an NGO promoting the knowledge and interests of Africana peoples in Israel and the Middle East.

The African Hebrew Development Agency (AHDA). AHDA is a non-governmental organization (NGO) which operates primarily on the African continent. It specializes in &quot;providing technical assistance, training and consultancy in essential areas... such as health, agriculture, rural development, environmental maintenance and related fields.&quot; The AHDA has also collaborated with indigenous African organizations to help mobilize the African Boreholes Initiative (ABI). ABI is a social enterprise built around the need to provide clean water to local African villages that would be otherwise incapable of accessing it.

=== Outreach ===
In April 2011, Ben Ammi led a seven-member delegation to South Africa to engage in discussions with Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini and the South African government in an attempt to explore options of replicating the &quot;Dimona Model&quot; for community development in that country.

<doc id="636476" wikidata="Q181129" url="?curid=636476" title="Moldovan leu">
<text>The leu (, plural lei ; sign: L; ISO 4217 code: MDL) is the currency of Moldova. Like the Romanian leu, the Moldovan leu is subdivided into 100 bani ( ban). The name of the currency originates from a Romanian word which means &quot;lion&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name of the currency means &quot;lion&quot;, and is derived from the Dutch thaler ( &quot;lion thaler/dollar&quot;). The Dutch &quot;leeuwendaalder&quot; was imitated in several German and Italian cities. These coins circulated in Moldova, Romania and Bulgaria and gave their name to their respective currencies: the &quot;Moldovan leu&quot;, the &quot;Romanian leu&quot; and the &quot;Bulgarian lev&quot;.
==History==
Between 1918 and 1940 and again between 1941 and 1944, when Moldova was part of Romania, the Romanian leu was used in what was then the eastern part of the broader Romanian region of Moldavia (&quot;Moldova&quot; in Romanian). The Moldovan leu was established on 29 November 1993, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the creation of the independent Republic of Moldova. It replaced the temporary cupon currency at a rate of 1 leu = 1000 cupon.

In Transnistria, an unrecognized breakaway state which is internationally recognized as part of Moldova, the Transnistrian ruble is used instead. The currency is not honoured by Moldova or any other state.

==Coins==
A first series of mostly small aluminum coins entered circulation in November 1993. A second series consisting of larger denomination coins was issued in 2018.
Most Moldovan coins are minted at the Monetăria Statului in Romania.

===First series (1993–present)===
In November 1993, the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) issued its first coins of 1, 5, 25 and 50 bani and 1 and 5 lei.

The 1 and 5 lei coins were withdrawn from circulation in 1994. Due to their low quality and relatively high nominal value many forgeries appeared.

In April 1996, a 10 bani coin was introduced.

In 1997, the NBM announced that it would replace the existing aluminum 50 bani coin with a new one made from brass-plated steel with a new and improved design featuring anti-counterfeit elements such as reeding. A first for modern Moldovan coins.

The new 50 bani coins were put into circulation on 2 February 1998. At the same time the NBM began withdrawing old aluminum 50 bani coins. They were demonitized on 1 January 1999.

1 ban coins remain legal tender but are rarely used or seen in circulation, effectively leading to &quot;Swedish rounding&quot;.

===Second series (2018–present)=== 
In 2017, the NBM announced plans to reintroduce 1 and 5 lei coins alongside new 2 and 10 lei coins citing &quot;superior durability and cheaper manufacturing and maintenance cost over time compared to banknotes&quot; as the main reason and asking people to submit their designs for the new coins. The design of the new coins was unveiled on February 28, 2018, featuring elements of both the coat of arms of the Principality of Moldavia on the obverse and the coat of arms of the Republic of Moldova on the reverse, with 1 and 2 lei coins being made from nickel-plated steel and 5 and 10 lei coins featuring a bi-metallic design with elements made from nickel-plated steel and brass-plated steel. The new coins were put into circulation starting 28 February 2018. All of the new lei coins are currently intended to be used alongside banknotes of equal value.

===Commemorative coins===
Since 1996, several commemorative coins for collectors have been issued. A complete listing can be found here.

==Banknotes==
There have been two series of Moldovan leu banknotes. The first series was short-lived and only included 1, 5, and 10 lei. The front of all of these notes—and all subsequent notes—feature a portrait of Ștefan cel Mare (Stephen the Great, also known as Stephen III of Moldavia), the prince of Moldavia from 1457 to 1504.

The first two lines of the Miorița (The Little Ewe) ballad appear on the back, printed vertically between the denomination numeral and the vignette of the fortress. These lines, “Pe-un picior de plai, pe-o gură de rai”, translate as “near a low foothill at Heaven’s threshold”.

* On the front side of each banknote only one man is represented - the best-known ruler of Moldavia - Ștefan cel Mare (Stephen the Great).
* The first two lines of the Miorița ballad are written in the white circle on the front side of each banknote.
* On the back side of all the banknotes there are depicted Trajan&#x27;s Column and The Endless Column.

Moldovan leu banknotes were notable for not using intaglio printing until 2015: the main security features on all denominations were limited, initially consisting mainly of a watermark of Ștefan, a solid security thread, and a see-through registration device. In 2015, the National Bank of Moldova finally rolled out intaglio printing and embossing for denominations between 10 and 500 lei, and also introduced revised security features on all denominations except for 1,000 lei. The banknote for 1,000 lei, valued at €51.60 by currency exchange service XE.com on 31 December 2019, continues to use the original design.

<doc id="636484" wikidata="Q847804" url="?curid=636484" title="Triangle offense">
<text>The triangle offense is an offensive strategy used in basketball. Its basic ideas were initially established by Hall of Fame coach Sam Barry at the University of Southern California. His system was further developed by former Houston Rockets and Kansas State University basketball head coach Tex Winter, who played for Barry in the late 1940s. Winter later served as an assistant coach for the Chicago Bulls in the 1980s and 1990s and for the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2000s, mostly under head coach Phil Jackson.

The system&#x27;s most important feature is the sideline triangle created by the center, who stands at the low post, the forward at the wing, and the guard at the corner. The team&#x27;s other guard stands at the top of the key and the weak-side forward is on the weak-side high post—together forming the &quot;two-man game&quot;. The goal of the offense is to fill those five spots, which creates good spacing between players and allows each one to pass to four teammates. Every pass and cut has a purpose and everything is dictated by the defense. 

It has been claimed that the triangle offense is the optimal way for five players to space the floor on the basketball court.

==Strategy==
The offense starts when a guard passes to the wing and cuts to the strong-side corner. The triangle is created from a post player on the strong-side block, the strong-side corner, and the extended strong-side wing, who gains possession on the first pass. The desired initial option in the offense is to pass to the strong-side post player on the block who is in good scoring position. From there the player has the options of looking to score or pass to one of the perimeter players who are exchanging from strong-side corner and wing, a dive cut down the lane, or the opposite wing flashing to the top of the key which initiates another common option known as the &quot;pinch post&quot;.

If a pass to the block is not possible, the second option is either to pass to the weak-side guard who flashes top of the key from the weak-side wing position or passing to the strong-side corner. If the ball is passed to the corner the options are either shoot, pass to the strong-side block, or pick and pop with the wing. If it is passed to the weak-side guard it initiates the &quot;pinch post&quot; option. There are two options. The first and most common is to pass to the weak-side forward who flashes to the elbow (corner of the key at the free throw line) to receive the pass. When he does the options are a rub handoff, back door cut by guard without the ball, post up of the guard on a smaller player, or face up and attack. The second option is a pick and roll with the forward. The advantage to the first option is there are so many weapons to attack the defense it opens up a lot of freedom and ability to score effectively. The advantage on the second option is that the player who has the ball and uses the screen now has the entire side of the floor to work with to go one on one. Meanwhile, on the other side, the wing sets a screen for the corner guard on the triangle split. If the hand-off is not available, the forward or the guard can pass to the corner guard coming off the screen. If the defense overplays or expects the split, both the wing and the corner guard can back cut to the basket. During all of this time the original strong-side block player is able to establish position for an easy shot while the defender is lured by all of the movement and cutting by the other players.

If the strong-side wing-to-guard pass is not possible, the third option is for the weak-side forward to flash to the strong-side elbow, take the pass, and cut to the basket on the trademark backdoor play of the offense. Meanwhile, the wing and corner guard exchange on a down screen. The forward with the ball can pass to the cutting guard or to the corner guard coming off the wing&#x27;s screen. If nothing&#x27;s available, he can shoot the basketball himself.

The offense also has a variety of options if there is heavy pressure from the defense. If the initial wing-pass by the guard is not available, the triangle can be created on the other side by passing to the other guard, who then passes to the weak-side forward (who then becomes the strong-side wing). The guard, who initially had the ball, then cuts to the other corner. The center or the pressured wing can flash to the opposite post. If the guard-to-guard pass is not available, the weak-side forward can make a similar flash cut that was mentioned earlier. That also creates many cutting opportunities. If there is heavy pressure on everybody, the center can release the pressure by cutting to the high post for a pass by the ball-handling guard. That would also create space for possible cuts.

==NBA==
Head coach Phil Jackson, with help from assistant coach Tex Winter, won 11 NBA Finals with the triangle offense. Jackson coached the Bulls from 1989–1998. He next served as the head coach of the Lakers twice, first from 1999–2004, and then from 2005–2011. The Chicago Bulls under Jackson won six championships in the 1990s playing in the triangle. His first three title-winning teams in Chicago featured superstars Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. Jackson&#x27;s later three titles with the Bulls came with Jordan, Pippen, and Dennis Rodman. Jackson&#x27;s Los Angeles Lakers won five championships employing the triangle. His first three Lakers championship squads fielded superstars Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Kobe Bryant, while his last two title teams saw him pair Bryant with fellow All-Star Pau Gasol.

Winter initially wanted to teach the triangle offense to Doug Collins, who the Bulls hired as head coach ahead of the 1986–87 season. However, Collins refused and instead he implemented an isolation-heavy offense centered around Jordan&#x27;s scoring abilities. Collins even went as far as banishing Winter to the end of the Bulls bench. Despite a conference finals appearance in the 1989 playoffs, Bulls general manager Jerry Krause fired Collins after the playoffs due to his refusal to adopt Winter&#x27;s system.

When Jackson became the head coach of the Chicago Bulls before the start of the 1989–1990 NBA season, he and Winter originally installed the triangle offense in an attempt to subvert the Jordan Rules strategy employed by their Eastern Conference rivals, the Detroit Pistons. The &quot;Jordan Rules&quot; was a defensive strategy which consisted of solely targeting Michael Jordan. Jordan had already established himself as an elite NBA superstar by single-handedly turning Chicago into a playoff contender. However, by sharing responsibility rather than shouldering it, he continued to blossom as a great all-around basketball player. More importantly, the Bulls also improved notably as a team, finishing with a 55–27 record. The Bulls fell to the Pistons in 7 games in the 1990 Eastern Conference Finals. The following year, however, Chicago finished the 1990–1991 NBA season with a then-franchise best 61–21 record, good for first place in the East, then swept the archrival Pistons 4–0 in the 1991 Eastern Conference Finals. The Bulls then defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals, four games to one. Michael Jordan won his second NBA Most Valuable Player Award that season and won his first championship.

The triangle offense was used very effectively by the Bulls during the 1995–96 season. Jordan, back at the helm for the team in his first full season since coming out of retirement, won his fourth NBA MVP award. He also finished the season as the league&#x27;s leading scorer for the 8th time. The Bulls recorded a then NBA-record 72–10 season en route to what was then their fourth NBA championship. Jackson won his first (and only) NBA Coach of the Year Award for his efforts during his team&#x27;s record-breaking season. Overall, the Bulls won six NBA titles during the 1990s, and the team is considered to be one of the NBA&#x27;s greatest dynasties.

Jackson installed the triangle offense again when he started coaching the Lakers in the 1999–2000 season, with Winter once again serving as an assistant on his staff. This time, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Kobe Bryant served as the focal points of the team&#x27;s offense. O&#x27;Neal won the NBA MVP Award in 2000, and Bryant rose to prominence as one of the NBA&#x27;s newest stars. The Lakers became an elite NBA team during Jackson&#x27;s first term as their coach, making four NBA Finals appearances in five years and winning three straight championships from 2000–2002. At the end of the 2004 Finals, which resulted in losing to the Detroit Pistons, his contract was not renewed. Jackson returned to the Lakers as head coach starting in the 2005–2006 season. Despite the presence of Bryant as the centerpiece of the team, the Lakers could not get past the first round of the playoffs in 2006 or 2007. However, the team acquired versatile forward Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies during the 2008 season. With Bryant and Gasol running the triangle offense, the Lakers made the NBA Finals three straight times and won in 2009 and 2010. In the process, Jackson surpassed Red Auerbach&#x27;s record of most titles won by an NBA coach.

When Phil Jackson retired as a head coach at the end of the 2010–2011 season, he finished his career with over 1000 victories over the course of his coaching career, regular season and playoff games combined. Jackson, Jordan, Pippen, Rodman, O&#x27;Neal, Bryant and Gasol are all Hall of Famers. Tex Winter earned induction into the Hall of Fame in 2011 for his contributions to basketball involving the triangle offense. He was an assistant for both the Bulls and Lakers on the first nine of Jackson&#x27;s 11 championship teams, and served as a consultant to the Lakers on the final two.

Several other coaches, some of whom were either Jackson&#x27;s former players or assistant coaches, tried to implement the triangle with varying degrees of success. In 1996, former Jackson assistant Jim Cleamons took over as head coach of the Dallas Mavericks, but only lasted until early in the 1997–98 season, when general manager Don Nelson fired him. Cleamons&#x27; triangle failed to click with the Mavericks&#x27; players, and after Nelson became head coach, the team abandoned it in favor of his Nellie Ball offense. Similarly, in 1993, Quinn Buckner tried to implement the triangle without success during his brief coaching career in Dallas, finishing his lone season with a 13–69 record.

After Tim Floyd replaced Jackson as Bulls head coach in 1998, he was asked by general manager Jerry Krause to use the triangle offense, and even retained Winter as an assistant for one season. However, Krause had infamously dismantled the championship team, and an inexperienced Bulls squad finished with only a 13–37 record in the lockout-shortened 1999 season. This was followed by a 17–65 record in the 1999–2000 season, and a 15–67 record in the 2000–01 season. Floyd resigned early in the 2001–02 season, and abandoned the triangle in favor of the Princeton offense during his lone season coaching the New Orleans Hornets in the 2003–04 season. 

Floyd&#x27;s successor, Bill Cartwright, continued to use the triangle during his three seasons with the Bulls. However, Cartwright was fired early in the 2003–04 season, and at this time, the Bulls were now under John Paxson as general manager. Paxson soon hired Scott Skiles, who promptly abandoned the triangle in favor of a more defensive-oriented, low-scoring style similar to the Detroit Pistons of the era. 

Another former Jackson assistant, Kurt Rambis, tried using the triangle without success during his brief two-year stint with the Minnesota Timberwolves from 2009 to 2011. In 2014, former Bulls player Steve Kerr began using a hybrid triangle upon joining the Golden State Warriors as head coach, mixing in certain aspects of run and gun and small ball to huge success. Kerr has so far coached the Warriors to four NBA championships between 2015 and 2022.

In 2014, Jackson joined the New York Knicks as president of basketball operations, and hired former Laker Derek Fisher as the head coach in hopes of installing the triangle offense. However, the Knicks failed to finish with a winning season. Nor did the team make the playoffs in each of Jackson&#x27;s three seasons. Fisher&#x27;s tenure lasted until midway through the 2015–16 season, after which he was fired and replaced by Kurt Rambis for the remainder of the season. Jeff Hornacek took over as the Knicks head coach for the 2016-2017 season, but he, too, couldn&#x27;t deliver a winning season for the Knicks. 

The triangle offense, while successful during Jackson&#x27;s legendary coaching career, has proved to be less effective in comparison to modern NBA offenses, which place more emphasis on perimeter shooting and player versatility. This is due in large part to the increased efficiency of the 3-point shot. In addition, players&#x27; improving 3-point proficiency and range provides much of the floor spacing that is one of the hallmarks of the triangle. It also did not help that Knicks players, especially Carmelo Anthony, were reluctant to learn the offense, and lacked the necessary discipline and patience to run the triangle. Jackson was dismissed after the 2016–17 season.

==International==
Tim Cone, the current head coach of the Barangay Ginebra San Miguel, continued the movement in the triangle offense and brought it to the PBA in 1989 when he was in Alaska Milkmen, thus aiding him to win a league-record 25 championships with three different franchises.

<doc id="636486" wikidata="Q593594" url="?curid=636486" title="West Hallam">
<text>West Hallam is a large village and civil parish west of Ilkeston in the county of Derbyshire in the East Midlands region of England. West Hallam has had its own parish council since 1894 and, since 1974, has been part of the Erewash borough. The population of the civil parish was 4,829 at the 2001 census reducing to 4,686 at the 2011 census.

==Early history==

Although it is not known exactly when the village was founded, it existed at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086. St Wilfrid&#x27;s Church is over 700 years old. In the 16th and 17th centuries, West Hallam had a reputation for Catholic sympathies at a time when Catholics were persecuted.

Until the early 20th century West Hallam was a small rural village and the property of the Newdigate family. Most jobs were in the agricultural area with mining work locally in the Erewash Valley coalfield. There was also a West Hallam railway station, connected to the Great Northern Railway and Derby Friargate Station.

==Twentieth century==

The Newdigate family finally parted with their interest as Lords of the Manor in 1914.

The later 20th century saw rapid change, with both the collieries and the railway disappearing during the 1960s. Stanley Colliery (known locally as &#x27;Nibby Pit&#x27;) on Station Road was the last to close in 1959 and some buildings remain, now in industrial use. The railway station is now Station House, a private residence.

The colliery spoil tips were removed and landscaped and after much opencast coal extraction the area regained its traditional rural appeal from the 1970s onward. In the 1970s and 1980s a major new housing development dramatically increased the village&#x27;s population.

The former Second World War Army Ordnance Depot off Cat and Fiddle Lane to the south of the village was reopened in the 1960s as Midland Storage (now known as TDG Pinnacle) and remains a significant local employer.

Most residents are now employed away from West Hallam, some even commuting daily as far as London.

==Amenities==
One of present-day West Hallam&#x27;s more notable places is the Bottle Kiln. On the site of the former West Hallam Pottery – which once had two such kilns and was virtually derelict for many years – this well-renovated bottle kiln and supporting buildings now houses an art and crafts gallery, a café and a Japanese-style tea garden and gift shop.

A valuable open space is the recreational area at Straw&#x27;s Bridge (also known as Swan Lake) on West Hallam&#x27;s eastern border, on the A609, with Ilkeston. This popular lake and walking area was formed from a flood meadow and the site of the old West Hallam Sewage Works in around 1990. This site was opencast mined in the late 1980s and the restored site along with some adjacent land forming part of the Ilkeston area known as &#x27;Manor&#x27; or &#x27;Manners Floods&#x27; forms the Straw&#x27;s Bridge area today.

Other facilities include a village hall in The Village, a community centre on Station Road, and Scargill Church of England Primary School on Beech Lane. There is now only one functioning pub, the busy Newdigate (formerly The Newdigate Arms); The 17th-century Punch Bowl closed (perhaps permanently) in 2022 and the White Hart was demolished in August 2020 to make way for four- and five-bedroom houses. The Dales Shopping Centre in The Village includes a Tesco Express Store, chemist, pizzeria, a Chinese and an Indian take-away as well as a fish and chip shop. Two medical centres/doctors surgeries and a chiropractor&#x27;s practice can also be found there. Four public recreation grounds can also be found within West Hallam.

West Hallam is also well provided as far as local charities are concerned. As well as the Rev John Scargill&#x27;s charity, established in 1662 and still going strong, needy locals may benefit from the Ann Powtrell Foundation and the West Hallam Trust (West Hallam United Charities), all of which are long established.

==Sport==
=== Cricket ===
West Hallam has two established cricket clubs:
* West Hallam White Rose Cricket Club was founded in 1880.

<doc id="636489" wikidata="Q2399350" url="?curid=636489" title="Memphis Southmen">
<text>The Memphis Southmen, also known as the Memphis Grizzlies, were an American football team based in Memphis, Tennessee. They played in the World Football League (WFL), which operated in 1974 and 1975. They played their home games at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium.

==From North to South==
The team was originally slated to be based in Toronto, Canada, with the nickname of the Northmen. However, when Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau announced that no U.S.-based professional football league would be allowed in Canada in competition with the Canadian Football League under the Canadian Football Act, a change in venue and nickname was announced. From the beginning, Memphians disliked &quot;Southmen&quot; and the team was informally known as the Memphis Grizzlies. The name appeared to come from the logo, a representation of a bear backed by the sun.

The &quot;Grizzlies&quot; were owned by John F. Bassett. A multi-millionaire, Bassett gave the league instant credibility by signing three stars from the National Football League&#x27;s Miami Dolphins for the 1975 season: running backs Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick, and wide receiver Paul Warfield. A Grizzlies quarterback was Danny White, who later became a quarterback and punter with the Dallas Cowboys from 1976 to 1988. John McVay was introduced as the head coach of the Grizzlies before the 1974 season. After his tenure with the Grizzlies, McVay would later serve as Vice-President and General Manager of the San Francisco 49ers for nineteen years, from 1980 to 1999. During this period, McVay presided over five Super Bowl-winning seasons and was named NFL Executive of the Year in 1989.

The Southmen&#x27;s home opener against the Detroit Wheels drew 30,122 fans, including Elvis Presley, a professed football fanatic. Country superstar Charlie Rich sang the national anthem. After Rich took his seat next to Elvis afterward, Presley commented, &quot;That&#x27;s a tough song to sing, ain&#x27;t it?&quot; Rich replied, &quot;It ain&#x27;t no &#x27;Behind Closed Doors&#x27;.&quot;

Even before the &quot;Miami Trio&quot; arrived, the 1974 Southmen found two durable running backs in J. J. Jennings and John Harvey, and they finished with the league&#x27;s best record at 17–3. They lost in the semifinals to the Orlando-based Florida Blazers, 18–15.

In 1975, Larry Csonka, Jim Kiick, and Paul Warfield finally came to Memphis (now officially dubbed the Grizzlies), but even they couldn&#x27;t save the league, which folded during the middle of its second season. The 1975 Grizzlies finished 7–4; in their last WFL game, they were shut out by the Birmingham Vulcans, 21–0.

Memphis eventually not only received another professional sports team via a relocation from Canada, but one that was &quot;officially&quot; called the Grizzlies – the Vancouver Grizzlies of the National Basketball Association would move to Memphis in 2001. The NBA Grizzlies are the only major professional sports team to keep its nickname after moving from Canada to the United States.

In 2004, Mississippi&#x27;s Johnny Wofford produced a DVD honouring the 1974–75 Southmen/Grizzlies. It included pictures from the 2004 30-year reunion conference.

==Memphis and the NFL==
The Southmen were one of the stronger and better-supported WFL franchises. With the wealth of Bassett, by far the richest owner in the WFL, behind them, the Southmen would have almost certainly been a viable venture had the WFL&#x27;s overall management been more financially sound. After the WFL folded, Bassett applied for membership in the NFL as an expansion team. Over 40,000 deposits for season tickets were collected in this effort, which included a December 1975 telethon dubbed the &quot;NFL-a-Thon&quot; on Memphis television station WMC-TV Channel 5. To their dismay, the NFL refused to accept the team. McVay and many of the Southmen moved on to join the New York Giants, where in what has been described as &quot;the closest approximation to a meeting between the champions of the WFL and the NFL&quot;, the Southmen reinforcements helped the Giants defeat the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers 17–0 in a 1976 preseason matchup.

Still, there were fans who would not quit. A lawsuit, &quot;Mid-South Grizzlies v. NFL&quot;, tried to force the league to accept the Grizzlies. It was not settled until 1984, by which time Bassett owned the Tampa Bay Bandits of the United States Football League and the case was rendered moot.

Long after Presley&#x27;s death in 1977, his estate was involved in an attempt to bring the NFL to Memphis; the Memphis Hound Dogs proposal ultimately lost (professional football would eventually come to the city in 1995 in the form of the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Mad Dogs, which Presley&#x27;s estate had no involvement with; the team folded after that single season).

The NFL&#x27;s Tennessee Oilers (newly relocated from Houston) played their 1997 season in Memphis before making their permanent home in Nashville.

<doc id="636496" wikidata="Q123955" url="?curid=636496" title="Euskotren Tranbia">
<text>Euskotren Tranbia is the brand under which the tramway networks in the cities of Vitoria-Gasteiz and Bilbao (both in the Basque Country) are run. The system in Bilbao started operations in 2002, and the one in Vitoria-Gasteiz in 2008. It is one of the four commercial divisions under which Euskotren (a public company managed by the Basque Government) operates. The infrastructure is owned by the public entity Euskal Trenbide Sarea (Basque Railway Network) and tracks use narrow gauge.

== Services ==

Euskotren Tranbia operates tram networks in Vitoria-Gasteiz (province of Álava) and Bilbao (province of Biscay). The first network, then named &quot;EuskoTran&quot; started operations in Bilbao in 2002 after two years under construction, connecting Bilbao-Atxuri Station with Uribitarte. The line was eventually expanded to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, Basurto Hospital and finally La Casilla.

The tramway system in Vitoria-Gasteiz opened in 2008 and has a Y-shaped network, with two different lines that cross the city from south to north.

Trams run on the street (shared with other traffic or on dedicated tracks) and on grass tracks. It also shares dedicated lanes with the local bus services, TUVISA in Vitoria-Gasteiz and Bilbobus in Bilbao.

=== Stop design ===

The two tram systems have their own, distinguishable stops, some of them shared with bus systems and with low platforms. The stops of Atxuri, Ribera and Abando, all of them in Bilbao, do not have a dedicated platform, they use the sidewalk. Except for Atxuri, all stops are unstaffed and rely on automated ticket machines. All the stations have displays and screens with the network map, the current time and temperature and the frequencies. Due to the low platforms, the access between them involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing. They are virtually level with the doors and are all wider than . This allows wheelchairs, prams, pushchairs and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps. In street sections, the pavement is integrated with the tram stop. The system in Bilbao has 14 stops, while the one in Vitoria has 23.

=== Systems ===

==== Bilbao ====
==== Vitoria-Gasteiz ====
=== Fares and ticketing ===

The two systems use both regular paper tickets and smartcards (BAT, Barik and Mugi). There are single, daily and monthly tickets available. In both networks, ticket pricing is not based on zone-based rules, as there&#x27;s a unique fare for the whole of each network.

== Rolling stock ==
Euskotren Tranbia operates a fleet of 26 CAF Urbos trams, distributed between both networks.

=== Current fleet ===

The 400 series consists of 8 vehicles (numbered 401-408), built for the Bilbao network. The trams are long, have 70% low floor access and are made up of three cars. Each tram can carry 196 passengers. They are the only CAF Urbos 1 trams to have been built.

The 500 series consists of 11 vehicles (numbered 501-511), originally built for the Vitoria-Gasteiz network. The trams are long, have 100% low floor access and are made up of five cars. Each tram can carry 261 passengers. Due to the introduction of the larger 600 series in Vitoria-Gasteiz, three vehicles will be transferred to Bilbao.

The 600 series consists of 7 vehicles (numbered 601-607), built for the Vitoria-Gasteiz network. The trams are long, have 100% low floor access and are made up of seven cars. Each tram can carry 398 passengers.

=== Livery ===

The trams were originally painted in grey and green stripes, the colours of &quot;Euskotren Tranbia&quot;. The current livery is white and green.

== Planned developments ==

=== Bilbao ===
=== Vitoria-Gasteiz ===
== Shelved projects ==

=== Barakaldo tram ===

There were plans to create a tram network in the municipality of Barakaldo, in the Greater Bilbao area, which would have started in Urbinaga (where it would have been connected to the Leioa tram) and from there create a circular line around the city center. The project included fifteen stops within Barakaldo plus two in Sestao, where it would connect with the Leioa line. Even if this project hasn&#x27;t been officially canceled, no progress has been made since 2010.

=== Leioa tram ===

The construction of a tramway for the municipality of Leioa, in the Greater Bilbao area had two phases. The first phase consisted in the construction of the depot and offices. The second phase would have involved the line itself including the rail track and stops from the University of the Basque Country campus to downtown Leioa. It would have included nine stops. A third phase would have made the tramway cross the Estuary of Bilbao and connect Leioa with the Left Bank with two extra stations.

Only the first phase (the depot and offices) has been built. After being postponed several times, the project was shelved in 2018.

<text>The Algebraist is a science fiction novel by Scottish writer Iain M. Banks, published in print in 2004. It was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novel in 2005.

It was his third science fiction novel not to be based or set in The Culture, the earlier two being &quot;Against a Dark Background&quot; and &quot;Feersum Endjinn&quot;.

== Plot summary ==
The novel takes place in 4034. With the assistance of other species, humans have spread across the galaxy,
which is primarily ruled by the Mercatoria, a complex feudal hierarchy with a religious zeal to rid the galaxy of artificial intelligences, which were blamed for a previous war.

The central character is the human Fassin Taak, a &quot;Slow Seer&quot; at the Court of the Nasqueron Dwellers. The Nasqueron&#x27;s star system has been cut off from the rest of Mercatoria civilization because their portal (the only means of faster than light travel) was destroyed by the Beyonders. The Beyonders are a large fleet of space marauders originating from the galaxy&#x27;s fringes. The local Mercatoria adherents await the delivery of a wormhole connection from a neighboring system via sub-lightspeed travel.

The Nasqueron Dwellers are an advanced and ancient civilisation of non-humanoids who inhabit gas giants. They lead an almost anarchic existence based on kudos and occupy the majority of gas giant planets in the galaxy. They are the only major species outside the control of the Mercatoria, and they are rumoured to possess devastating defensive weaponry. Dweller societies try not to get involved with &quot;Quick&quot; species: those with sentient beings who experience life at around the speed human beings do. Dwellers are one of the &quot;Slow&quot; species who experience life at a much slower rate. Dweller individuals live for millions of years, and the species has existed for billions of years, long before the foundation of the Mercatoria. Slow Seers like Taak are a dynasty of researchers who attempt to glean information from the Dwellers&#x27; vast but disorganised knowledge libraries. They do it partly by artificially slowing their metabolisms to better communicate with the Dwellers.

Taak looks forward to a life of quiet scholarship when he is astonished to be drafted into one of the Mercatoria&#x27;s religio-military orders. In a previous research expedition to the Dweller-inhabited gas giant Nasqueron, Taak inadvertently uncovered a book containing information about the legendary &quot;Dweller List&quot; of coordinates for their own private systems of wormholes. Since Dwellers are sufficiently long-lived to colonise the galaxy at sublight speed, the very existence of such a network was considered doubtful.

The Dweller List is only a list of star systems. Portals are relatively small and can be anywhere within a system so long as they are at a point of low gravitational gradient, such as a Lagrange point. The list is useless without a particular mathematical transform needed to give the exact location of the portals. Taak must go on a further expedition to Nasqueron to find the Transform.

The Archimandrite Luseferous is a tyrannical warlord of the Starveling Cult. He is in a loose alliance with the Beyonders. He sets out to invade the Ulubis system from the Cluster Epiphany Five Disconnect while also aiming to possess the secrets of the Dweller portals. A Mercatoria counter-attack fleet hurries to defend Ulubis against the Starveling Cult ships and their Beyonder allies. Both fleets are forced to travel at sublight speeds, leaving the inhabitants of the Ulubis system anxiously wondering which will arrive first.

Taak&#x27;s hunt for the Transform takes him on a journey, partly through the Dweller wormhole network. In a backstory, it is revealed that he has been out of sympathy with the Mercatoria for some time, particularly over their treatment of artificial intelligence, and has, in fact, been a Beyonder agent. It is also revealed that the Dwellers harbor artificial intelligences from Mercatoria persecution.

The Beyonder/Starveling forces arrive and easily overwhelm Ulubis&#x27;s native defenses. To their dismay, they discover that the counter-attack force is coming much sooner than predicted and is superior. The Beyonder factions despair of locating Taak and the secret in the time available before the recapture of Ulubis and retreat. The Starvelings under Luseferous remain. He makes a last-ditch attempt to force the Dwellers to yield up Taak, threatening them with antimatter weapons. The Dwellers respond with devastating blows to his fleet. Luseferous flees under the Mercatoria&#x27;s pursuit.

Taak returns from his journey with his memory partly erased. He can still piece together the secret from the remaining clues: every massive body has a region of zero-net gravitational attraction at its exact centre. The Dwellers have hidden wormhole portals in the cores of all their occupied planets, and the Transform was never necessary. Now that the secret is out, whether the Dwellers will cooperate to allow other species access to their network remains unclear.

The novel ends with Taak, having left Ulubis and joined the Beyonders, suggesting to a lifelong friend he has just discovered is an artificial intelligence, &quot;One day we&#x27;ll all be free.&quot;

== Reception ==

In an interview in 2004, Banks stated that &quot;It probably could become a trilogy, but for now it’s a standalone novel.&quot; &quot;The Algebraist&quot; was shortlisted for the 2005 Hugo Award for Best Novel. In 2011, the novel was short-listed for the NPR Top-100 Science Fiction, Fantasy Titles.

<text>A styrophone is an acoustic device made from expanded polystyrene foam (often referred to by the genericized trademark &quot;Styrofoam&quot;). There are at least two varieties:

* an acoustic musical instrument 
* a type of loudspeaker

==Musical instrument==

The musical Styrophone is a type of friction idiophone created by Robert Rutman in the 1990s as a parody of his well-known sheetmetal instrument, the Bow Chimes. It consists of a foam box from which protrude a series of thin brass rods played with a violin bow. Rutman&#x27;s ensemble would build the impromptu instruments prior to a performance, and then destroy them through the process of their use. Other versions have been created with wooden sticks used in place of metal.

==Styrophone loudspeaker==

An inexpensive alternative to heavy-duty amplification systems, the Styrophone loudspeaker is usually of a cheap homemade variety that consists of a crystal earpiece attached to a cone made from a foam cup or sections of packing material.

<text>AutoZone, Inc. is an American retailer of aftermarket automotive parts and accessories, the largest in the United States. Founded in 1979, AutoZone has 7,140 stores across the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Brazil, and the US Virgin Islands. AutoZone is based in Memphis, Tennessee.

==History==
===1970s===
Originally a division of Memphis-based wholesale grocer Malone &amp; Hyde, the company was known as Auto Shack. After the sale of the grocery operation to the Fleming Companies of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the name of the company was changed to AutoZone to better reflect the company focus just prior to the company going public. 

On July 4, 1979, the first store opened in Forrest City, Arkansas under the name of Auto Shack. Doc Crain was the store&#x27;s first manager. Sales that first day totaled $300.00.

===1980s===
In 1981, Express Parts or VDP was implemented to get the customers hard to find parts by special ordering them through wholesalers. The total stores were 73 in 7 states.

In 1984, the company became the first auto parts retailer to create a quality control program for its parts. Total stores were 194 in 13 states.

In 1985, Doc Crain coined the term WITTDTJR, which stands for &quot;What it takes to do the job right.&quot; The total store count is 263 in 14 states. Peter Formanek stepped in as president. He oversaw the auto parts firm&#x27;s daily operations and worked on growth strategy.

By 1986, expansion had made the company grow into a large store chain across the South and the Midwest. That year, Darren Reltherford, manager of Auto Shack&#x27;s Memphis, Tennessee store, received the first Extra Miler award, which has since been given to AutoZoners who show their dedication to customer satisfaction by &quot;going the extra mile&quot; for customer service. The Duralast line of alternators and starters was released. The Loan-A-Tool program began allowing customers to borrow specific tools for jobs. The fourth distribution center in Greenville, South Carolina opened. The total number of stores was 339 in 15 states.
In 1986, Auto Shack was sued by Radio Shack for trademark infringement. In 1987 Auto Shack announced plans to change its name to AutoZone. The first AutoZone store was in Enid, Oklahoma. That year also, the company introduced WITT-JR, an electronic catalog used to look up parts and keep warranty information. The total number of stores was 459 in 16 states.

In 1989, the company began using a computerized store management system (SMS). The Duralast battery line consisting of Sub-Zero, Desert, and long life was released. The total number of stores was 513 in 17 states.

===1990s===
In 1991, its stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange using the ticker symbol &quot;AZO.&quot; It opened up at $27.50 a share. The fifth DC opens in Lafayette, Louisiana. The company also became the first auto parts retailer to register customer warranties in a computer database.

In 1994, AutoZone began using satellites to facilitate communication between stores and the corporate office. Sales hit $1.5 billion.

In 1995, AutoZone opened its 1,000th store in Louisville, Kentucky. Also, the &quot;Duralast&quot; trademark made its debut with the &quot;Duralast&quot; and &quot;Duralast Gold&quot; batteries. Total of stores is now 1,143 in 26 states.

1996 was the year when the Internet era arrived at the company, when AutoZone opened its company Web site. The new commercial program debuted in Germantown, Tennessee. ALLDATA, a software company based in Elk Grove, California that provides automotive diagnostic and repair information, was acquired.

Company founder Pitt Hyde retired as chairman and CEO in 1997. John Adams became the new chairman and CEO.

In 1998, AutoZone acquired ADAP Inc, who had stores under the ADAP Discount Auto Parts and Auto Palace nameplates respectively, both being auto parts chains in the northeastern United States with 112 stores, TruckPro L.P., a chain with 43 stores in 14 states, and the 560-store Chief Auto Parts Inc., a chain with a presence in 5 states. At the commencement of fiscal 1999, AutoZone made another acquisition by purchasing 100 Express stores from The Pep Boys—Manny, Moe &amp; Jack. The company began a process of internationalization with their first store abroad, which opened in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. AutoZone closed the 1990s by debuting at the Fortune 500 list in 1999.

===2000s===
Steve Odland became AutoZone&#x27;s third CEO in 2001. Also in 2001, AutoZone sold TruckPro to Paratus Capital Management.
In 2002, AutoZone developed a network of &quot;hub, feeder, and satellite&quot; stores to have more product in the market area, while reducing inventory investment. Sales hit $5.33 billion.

In 2003, the &quot;Duralast tool&quot; line was introduced. This was a year of important negotiations for AutoZone, as the company partnered with other important auto parts industry companies, such as CarMax and Midas. AutoZone de Mexico opens the first DC in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Total stores number 3,219 in 48 states and 49 in Mexico. In 2004, founder J.R. &quot;Pitt&quot; Hyde III was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame.

In 2004, Auto Zone was sponsored by the NCAA Liberty Bowl at Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee 

In 2005, William C. Rhodes III was named president and CEO. Steve Odland left to become the chairman and CEO of Office Depot.

In 2007, Bill Rhodes, then 42, was named chairman, president and chief executive officer of AutoZone, Inc. on June 6.

In 2008, AutoZone opened their 4,000th store in Houston, Texas. Sales hit $6.2 billion.

===2010s===

On December 15, 2011, ALLDATA LLC, an operating unit of AutoZone, expanded its direct presence in Canada to better serve its growing customer base.

On August 17, 2012, AutoZone expanded into their 49th state Alaska by opening their 5,000th store in Wasilla, Alaska.

In 2012 AutoZone opened their first store in Brazil.

In December 2012, AutoZone purchased AutoAnything.com, an e-commerce leader in aftermarket automotive parts based in San Diego, California.

By April 2017, AutoZone had been the largest retailer of automotive parts in North America for three consecutive years. As of August 2017, AutoZone had 5,465 locations in the United States, 524 locations in Mexico, and 46 locations in Brazil, for a total of 6,035.

On October 22, 2018, Pitt Hyde announced that he would be stepping down from AutoZone&#x27;s board of directors.

=== 2020s ===

In late May 2020, two AutoZone stores were destroyed by arson during the George Floyd protests in Minneapolis–Saint Paul.

In early Jan 2024 Phillip Daniele, was promoted to CEO. 

==Corporate affairs==
AutoZone is incorporated in the state of Nevada.

===Headquarters===

Since October 1995, AutoZone has been headquartered in its J.R. Hyde, III Store Support Center (SSC), a , eight-story building in Downtown Memphis, Tennessee. As of 2013 there were over 1,200 employees there.

The project manager of the building&#x27;s construction was Rob Norcross, a principal at LRK Inc. The building has the capability to withstand a 9.0 magnitude earthquake because it has a special base isolation system that had a price tag of $950,000.

==Private labels==

Valucraft, Duralast, and Duralast Gold are AutoZone&#x27;s private label brands for lead-acid automotive batteries (manufactured primarily by Johnson Controls, but also East Penn, Exide, and other manufacturers). Duralast Platinum is an AGM line of batteries. AutoZone also sells tools under the Duralast brand which carry a lifetime warranty.

Brake pad labels include (ranging from least to most expensive):
*Duralast - OEM-like performance; semi-metallic or organic.
*Duralast Gold - OEM design and performance; semi-metallic or ceramic.
*Duralast Max (in the process of being phased out) - superior to OEM design and performance; ceramic.
*Duralast Elite (currently being introduced selectively by market) - superior to OEM design and performance; ceramic; copper-free.
*Duralast GT Street - performance pads for select applications.

Valucraft pads are being phased out, as of early 2015. Duralast GT Street pads introduced early 2018.

The Valucraft, Duralast, and Duralast Gold names are used on various other parts and accessories as well.

Duralast Elite pads were first trademarked and began being introduced to select markets in early 2020.

==Retail stores==

AutoZone&#x27;s 7,140 retail outlets throughout the United States, Mexico and Brazil stock a variety of aftermarket parts as well as some OEM parts. All AutoZone stores are corporately owned; the company does not have franchise operations.

==Sponsorships==
In 2004, AutoZone celebrated its 25th anniversary and announced a corporate sponsorship agreement with auto racing association NASCAR.

In 2007, AutoZone sponsored Kevin Harvick and Timothy Peters in the NASCAR Busch Series.

AutoZone holds the naming rights to the downtown Memphis baseball stadium that is the home of the Memphis Redbirds of the Pacific Coast League. The company also sponsors the AutoZone Liberty Bowl. The AutoZone Liberty Bowl, alongside the College Football Playoff Foundation donated $250,136.03 to the St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital. The AutoZone Liberty Bowl awarded 2018&#x27;s Distinguished Citizen Award to Priscilla Presley.

They are an official sponsor of Bellator MMA, the world&#x27;s second largest Mixed Martial Arts promotion.

==Lawsuits==
AutoZone paid $3.3 million to settle a lawsuit by the families of a family who was killed due to being rear-ended by an AutoZone-owned truck. The suit alleges that AutoZone was negligent in training the driver of the truck.

AutoZone faced a lawsuit for gender discrimination in which the plaintiff alleged that men treated her differently when she was promoted and that she feared revealing a pregnancy to her superior. When the pregnancy was discovered, she alleges that her district manager pressured her to step down from her position. She was demoted in February 2006 and fired in November 2011. The jury on the case ruled in 2014 in favor of the plaintiff, awarding her $185 million in punitive damages as well as approximately $873,000 in back wages. AutoZone has announced its intention to appeal the verdict. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;&#x27;s Jacob Gershman suggested that the verdict would be scaled back, noting that the jury verdict is not the end-all be-all.

A Georgia woman was fired after a customer insulted her and used multiple racial epithets against her. She alleges that the district manager told her to &quot;suck it up,&quot; and she is filing a lawsuit against AutoZone for violating her civil rights.

AutoZone came under fire from allegations that a district manager had told an employee to remove a flag displayed on the company&#x27;s premises for the sake of improved diversity. AutoZone denies that and claimed that it was the poor means by which the flag was put up, with duct tape and suction cups.

In June 2019 AutoZone entered into an $11 million settlement against with the State of California to resolve allegations that the company had violated state laws governing hazardous waste, hazardous materials, and confidential consumer information. AutoZone is charged with illegally disposing of millions of hazardous waste items, including used motor oil and automotive fluids, at landfills not authorized to accept hazardous waste.

<doc id="636522" wikidata="Q1369279" url="?curid=636522" title="General Electric F110">
<text>The General Electric F110 is an afterburning turbofan jet engine produced by GE Aerospace (formerly GE Aviation). It was derived from the General Electric F101 as an alternative engine to the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 for powering tactical fighter aircraft, with the F-16C Fighting Falcon and F-14A+/B Tomcat being the initial platforms; the F110 would eventually power new F-15 Eagle variants as well. The engine is also built by IHI Corporation in Japan, TUSAŞ Engine Industries (TEI) in Turkey, and Samsung Techwin in South Korea as part of licensing agreements.

The F118 is a non-afterburning variant of the F110 that powers the Northrop B-2 stealth bomber and Lockheed U-2S reconnaissance aircraft.

==Design and development==
The F110 emerged from an intersection of efforts in the 1970s by General Electric to reenter the U.S. fighter engine market and the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s desire to address the reliability, longevity, and maintenance issues with the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 engines that powered its F-15s and F-16s. In 1975, General Electric used its own funds to begin developing the F101X, a derivative of its F101 engine for the B-1 bomber; the F101X would inherit much of the core design while having a smaller fan that was upscaled from the F404 so that its thermodynamic cycle and thrust were better suited for a fighter engine. The convergent-divergent iris nozzle was also derived from the F404.

The cancellation of the B-1A by the Carter Administration (in lieu of the Advanced Technology Bomber which became the B-2) meant a loss of business for General Electric, and provided further impetus to provide the F101X for the fighter engine market. The engine attracted the interest of the Air Force&#x27;s Engine Model Derivative Program (EMDP), and in 1979 began funding it as the F101 Derivative Fighter Engine, or F101 DFE. The Air Force saw the F101 DFE as a potential alternative to the F100 and also a way to coerce better performance from Pratt &amp; Whitney in addressing issues with the F100.
Following the completion of ground tests in 1980, the F101 DFE was first fitted on an F-16 for flight testing, where it showed considerable improvement in performance and operability over the existing F100. In 1982, the Air Force began the full-scale development of the F101 DFE as an option to compete with the F100 for application in future F-15 and F-16 production; the engine was eventually selected for the F-16 and designated F110-GE-100. The threat by the F110 has been cited as a reason for Pratt &amp; Whitney to more quickly rectify the issues affecting the F100 and developing the improved F100-PW-220 variant. Seeking to drive unit costs down and improve contractor performance, the Air Force implemented the Alternate Fighter Engine (AFE) competition between the F100 and F110 in 1983 in what was nicknamed &quot;The Great Engine War&quot;, where the engine contract would be awarded through competition. The Air Force would buy both engines starting in 1984, with contracts being competed every fiscal year and the percentages of F100 versus F110 would vary based on contract; the competitions eventually ended in 1992.
The F101 DFE was also tested in the F-14B prototype in 1981, and the aircraft saw considerable performance improvement over the existing Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30. Although further testing was halted by the Navy in 1982, it would use the results of the Air Force&#x27;s AFE evaluation to choose the powerplant for future F-14s. The F101 DFE was eventually chosen by the Navy in 1984 and was designated F110-GE-400.

===Design===

The F110-GE-100/400 is a low-bypass axial-flow afterburning turbofan. It has a 3-stage fan driven by a two-stage low-pressure turbine and a 9-stage compressor driven by a one-stage high-pressure turbine; overall pressure ratio is 30.4 and bypass ratio is 0.87. In contrast to the ambitious raw performance goals for the F100 of high thrust and low weight, the F110 placed a greater emphasis on balancing between reliability, operability, and performance. The fan and inlet guide vanes were designed to smooth airflow to increase resistance to compressor stalls. The engine has an electronic and hydromechanical control system that make it more forgiving of rapid throttle inputs. The main difference between the -100 and the -400 is the latter&#x27;s augmentor section, being about 50 inches longer. The -100, used on the F-16C/D Block 30/40, had an uninstalled static thrust of in intermediate power and in afterburner; the figures for the -400, used on the F-14B/D, were and respectively.

===Further developments===
In the mid-1980s, the Air Force sought greater power for its tactical fighters and began Improved Performance Engine (IPE) programs for the F100 and F110, with the goal of achieving thrust in the class, while retaining the durability improvements achieved in the F100-PW-220 and F110-GE-100. The result would be the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-229 and General Electric F110-GE-129. Compared to the F110-100, the -129 incorporated component improvements, including a full authority digital engine control (FADEC), that allowed maximum thrust to be achieved in a wider range of conditions and across larger portions of the flight envelope, while retaining 80% commonality; bypass ratio was reduced to 0.76. The -129 produces of thrust in intermediate power and in full afterburner, and was first fielded in 1992 on the F-16C/D Block 50; the engine would also power enhanced F-15E variants, starting with the F-15K for South Korea.
A non-afterburning variant of the F110, designated the F118, would power the B-2 stealth bomber and the re-engined U-2S reconnaissance aircraft. A variant of the F110-100 fitted with a 3-dimensional axisymmetric thrust vectoring nozzle, referred by General Electric as the Axisymmetric Vectoring Exhaust Nozzle (AVEN), was tested on a specially modified F-16 called the NF-16D VISTA under the Multi-Axis Thrust-Vectoring (MATV) program; the nozzle could vector the exhaust up to 17 degrees from the axial line in any direction.

The F110 would see the development of a further enhanced variant starting in 2000 with the F110-GE-132, initially referred to as the F110-GE-129EFE (Enhanced Fighter Engine). Both the -132 and its competitor, the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-232, were designed to make full use of the F-16&#x27;s Modular Common Inlet Duct (MCID), or &quot;Big Mouth&quot; inlet introduced in the Block 30 variant. The -132 incorporates an improved fan that is more efficient and can increase maximum airflow, composite fan duct, durability improvements to the hot section, radial augmentor, and control system improvements. The engine leveraged research performed under the Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) program. The -132 produces of thrust in intermediate power and in afterburner but can also be tuned to run at -129 thrust levels to increase inspection intervals from 4,300 cycles to 6,000; the older -129 can be upgraded to the -132 configuration, with the new fan being a modular component. The F110-132 was selected to power the F-16E/F Block 60 for the United Arab Emirates. Engine flight tests began in 2003, and first delivery was in 2005.

Technology from the -132 as well as from commercial CFM56 developments are shared with the F110 Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), and F110-129 upgraded with SLEP technology were given the designation -129C. Further improved subvariants with 6,000-cycle intervals were designated -129D (for the F-16) and -129E (for the F-15). The -129E also powers the TAI Kaan prototype.

==Major applications==
===F-14===
The F-14A entered service with the United States Navy in 1973 powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30s. By the end of the decade, following numerous problems with the original engine (and similar problems with the F100 on the F-15 and F-16), the DoD began procuring the upgraded TF30-P-414As. While these engines solved the serviceability problems, the fuel consumption and thrust was comparable to the initial model—considerably less than what the F-14 had been designed for; the F-14&#x27;s originally planned Pratt &amp; Whitney F401, an upscaled naval development of the F100 design, was also canceled due to costs and reliability issues.

After reviewing the results of the Air Force&#x27;s AFE evaluation, the Navy would choose the F101 DFE to re-engine the F-14 in 1984, with the variant designated the F110-GE-400; the primary difference between the -400 and the Air Force&#x27;s F110-GE-100 is length — the -400 had a tailpipe extension to suit the F-14 airframe, which was fitted downstream of the augmentor. During initial years of service, the -400&#x27;s lengthened tailpipe created unanticipated hot spots in the afterburner liner, resulting in the loss of several F-14s before the issue was rectified. The engine produced of uninstalled thrust with afterburner; installed thrust is with afterburner at sea level, which rose to at Mach 0.9. This was similar to the F-14&#x27;s originally intended F401 and provided a significant increase over the TF30&#x27;s maximum uninstalled thrust of 20,900 lbf (93 kN). These upgraded jets were initially known as F-14A+ before being re-designated as the F-14B, as were new production aircraft powered by the F110. The same engine also powered the final variant of the aircraft, the F-14D.

Proposed upgraded variants of the F-14, such as the Super Tomcat 21 (ST-21), were to be powered by the F110-GE-429, the naval variant of the F110-GE-129 IPE.

===F-16===
The F-16 Fighting Falcon entered service powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 afterburning turbofan. Seeking a way to drive unit costs down, the USAF implemented the Alternate Fighter Engine (AFE) program in 1984, under which the engine contract would be awarded through competition. As of June 2005, the F110 powered 86% of the USAF&#x27;s F-16C/Ds. While the F110-GE-100 can provide around more thrust than the F100-PW-200, it requires more airflow for the jet to fully exploit the engine; the standard normal shock inlet (NSI) limited the F110 to . This led to the increase in the area of the engine inlet for the MCID. The F-16C/D Block 30/32s were the first to be built with a common engine bay, able to accept both engines, with Block 30s having the bigger MCID inlet (also known as &quot;Big Mouth&quot;) for the F110 and Block 32s retaining the standard inlet for the F100.
The F-16C/D Block 30 and 40 were powered by the F110-GE-100, while the Block 50 was powered by the F110-GE-129 IPE. The United Arab Emirates&#x27; F-16E/F Block 60 is powered by the F110-GE-132, as was the proposed Lockheed Martin-Tata F-21, based on the Block 60 and initially designated F-16IN, for the Indian Air Force MMRCA competition. Current production F-16C Block 70 are equipped with the F110-129D with increased lifespan and durability.

Two derivatives of the F-16, the Mitsubishi F-2 and the General Dynamics F-16XL, are powered by the -129 IPE. The engines for the F-2 were license-built by IHI Corporation and designated F110-IHI-129, prior to the reporting of an IHI company whistleblower in February 2024. On April 24, 2024, IHI announced that investigation was underway by Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of its subsidiary, IHI Power Systems Co., which had falsified its engine data since 2003, impacting over 4,000 engines globally.

===F-15===
Although the Air Force chose the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-229 as the IPE for the F-15E Strike Eagle, a pair of F110-GE-129s were mounted on one aircraft for flight testing. South Korea would choose the -129 to power 40 F-15K fighters, the first time production F-15s were powered by a General Electric engine. The engines were manufactured through a joint licensing agreement with Samsung Techwin Company. It has also been chosen by the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) to power its F-15SG.

The F-15E would be further developed into the Advanced Eagle with a new fly-by-wire control system that incorporates the F110-GE-129&#x27;s FADEC. The Advanced Eagle with the F110-129E would be the basis for Saudi Arabia&#x27;s F-15SA, Qatar&#x27;s F-15QA, and the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s F-15EX.

<text>Treniota (also spelled &quot;Troniata&quot;; ; – 1264) was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1263 to 1264.

==Life==
Treniota was the nephew of Mindaugas, the first and only king of Lithuania. While Mindaugas had converted to Christianity in order to discourage Livonian Order and Teutonic Knights attacks on Lithuania, becoming king in the process, Treniota remained a staunch pagan. It is believed that Treniota was trusted to rule Samogitia.

Despite Mindaugas&#x27;s conversion, the Teutonic Knights regularly made incursions in Lithuanian territory. After the Battle of Durbe in 1260, Treniota convinced Mindaugas to relapse from Christianity and attack the Teutonic Order, though the attack was ineffective and the Teutonic Knights were barely weakened. Mindaugas began to question his alliance with Treniota. However, before he was able act against his pagan nephew, Treniota together with Daumantas assassinated Mindaugas and two of his sons in 1263. Treniota usurped the throne and reverted the nation to paganism. However, he only ruled for a year before being deposed by Vaišvilkas, the younger son of Mindaugas.

<doc id="636555" wikidata="Q417942" url="?curid=636555" title="Fluvastatin">
<text>Fluvastatin is a member of the statin drug class, used to treat hypercholesterolemia and to prevent cardiovascular disease.
It was patented in 1982 and approved for medical use in 1994. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Adverse effects==
Adverse effects are comparable to other statins. Common are nausea, indigestion, insomnia and headache. Myalgia (muscle pain), and rarely rhabdomyolysis, characteristic side effects for statins, can also occur.

== Interactions ==

Contrary to lovastatin, simvastatin and atorvastatin, fluvastatin has no relevant interactions with drugs that inhibit the liver enzyme CYP3A4, and a generally lower potential for interactions than most other statins. Fluconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP2C9, does increase fluvastatin levels.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===

Fluvastatin works by blocking the liver enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which facilitates an important step in cholesterol synthesis.

===Pharmacodynamics===

In a Cochrane systematic review the dose-related magnitudes of fluvastatin on blood lipids was determined. Over the dose range of 10 to 80 mg/day total cholesterol was reduced by 10.7% to 24.9%, LDL cholesterol by 15.2% to 34.9%, and triglycerides by 3% to 17.5%.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The drug is quickly and almost completely (98%) absorbed from the gut. Food intake slows down absorption, but does not decrease it. Due to its first-pass effect, bioavailability is lower: about 24–30% according to different sources. Over 98% of the substance is bound to plasma proteins.

Several cytochrome P450 enzymes (mainly CYP2C9, but also CYP3A4 and CYP2C8) are involved in the metabolism of fluvastatin, which makes is less liable to interactions than most other statins. The main metabolite is inactive and is called &quot;&quot;N&quot;-desisopropyl propionic acid&quot; in the literature.

93–95% of the drug is excreted via the feces, less than 2% of which in form of the original substance.

==Names==
Fluvastatin is the INN. Brandnames include Lescol, Canef, Vastin.

==Research==
Data from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists&#x27; (CTT) publication was used to determine the effects of fluvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin on LDL cholesterol lowering and reduction of myocardial infarction. In two RCTs an average dose of 72 mg/day fluvastatin reduced LDL cholesterol by 31.9%, and reduced myocardial infarction, relative risk, 0.68 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.85) as compared to placebo. In five RCTs a mean atorvastatin dose of 26 mg/day reduced LDL cholesterol by 44.0% and reduced myocardial infarction, relative risk, 0.67 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.77) as compared to placebo. In four RCTs a mean rosuvastatin dose of 16 mg/day reduced LDL cholesterol by 48.8% and reduced myocardial infarction, relative risk, 0.82 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.93) as compared to placebo. Thus despite reducing LDL cholesterol by a much lesser amount with fluvastatin than atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, fluvastatin reduced myocardial infarction similarly to atorvastatin and to a greater degree than rosuvastatin.

Later, on 1 May 1912, the village was incorporated and became a town. Roblin celebrated its 100th anniversary in July 2013. The current mayor of the municipality of Roblin is Robert Misko.

Krosney Lake (east of East Goose Lake) is a commemorative lake officially named by the Geographical Names Board of Canada in memory of Private Darren Michael Krosney (4 July 1965, Winnipeg, Manitoba – 21 August 1983).

== Demographics ==
According to the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Roblin had a population of 1,709 living in 820 of its 903 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 1,697. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="636559" wikidata="Q808113" url="?curid=636559" title="Walking on Glass">
<text>Walking on Glass is the second novel by Scottish writer Iain Banks, published in 1985.

&quot;Walking on Glass&quot; is formed of three storylines that initially do not appear to be linked, but eventually come together. The extent to which these stories are interconnected is dependent on how deeply into the book the reader is willing to read.

==Plot summary==
Each part of &quot;Walking on Glass&quot;, apart from the last, is divided into three sections, which appear at first sight to be independent stories. Two of the stories are set in and around Islington in North London; the other is set in the far distant future.

*Graham Park is a young man in love with a girl he met at a party, Sara ffitch. Richard Slater is his friend. Bob Stock, a &quot;macho black-leathered never-properly-seen image of Nemesis&quot; seems all that stands in the way of Graham&#x27;s happiness.
*Steven Grout is a paranoid roadmender who believes himself to be an admiral from a galactic war imprisoned in the body of an Earthman. He believes he is under constant threat from the Microwave Gun, and reads much science fiction, since &quot;he had long ago realised that if he [were] going to find any clues to the whereabouts of the Way Out, the location or identity of the Key, there was a good chance he might get some ideas from that type of writing.&quot;
*Quiss and Ajayi are war criminals from opposing sides in a galactic war, who are imprisoned in the Castle of Bequest (also Castle Doors) and forced to play impossible games until they can solve the riddle: &quot;What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?&quot;

Eventually, links between the three storylines become apparent.

==Literary significance and criticism==

Iain Banks commented that the book &quot;didn&#x27;t do exactly what it set out to do and I think you have failed to an extent if the reader can&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re saying. I worry sometimes that people will read &quot;Walking on Glass&quot; and think in some way I was trying to fool them, which I wasn&#x27;t.&quot;

<doc id="636562" wikidata="Q302869" url="?curid=636562" title="Bridgestone Arena">
<text>Bridgestone Arena (originally Nashville Arena, and formerly Gaylord Entertainment Center and Sommet Center) is a multi-purpose indoor arena in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, United States. Completed in 1996, it is the home of the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League.

==Ownership==
Designed by HOK Sport (now Populous) in conjunction with the Nashville-based architecture/engineering firm Hart Freeland Roberts, INC., it was designed at an angle on the corner of Broadway and 5th Avenue in Nashville in physical homage to the historic Ryman Auditorium, the original home of the Grand Ole Opry.

Bridgestone Arena is owned by the Sports Authority of Nashville and Davidson County and operated by Powers Management Company, a subsidiary of the Nashville Predators National Hockey League franchise, which has been its primary tenant since 1998.

==Events==
The Predators hosted the NHL Entry Draft here in 2003 and 2023; it was also the location for the 2016 NHL All-Star Game.

In 1997, it was the venue of the United States Figure Skating Championships, and in 2004 hosted the USA Gymnastics National Championships. It was the home of the Nashville Kats franchise of the Arena Football League from 1997 until 2001, and hosted the team&#x27;s revival from 2005 to 2007, when the Kats franchise folded.

The arena has hosted college basketball events, including both men&#x27;s (2001, 2006, 2010) and women&#x27;s tournaments of the Southeastern Conference and the Ohio Valley Conference. Nashville will serve as a primary venue for the SEC men&#x27;s basketball tournament nine times between 2015 and 2025 (2015–2017, 2019–2021, and 2023–2025) after the SEC signed a long-term agreement with the Nashville Sports Council in 2013. It hosted the 2014 NCAA Women&#x27;s Final Four, the 2018 SEC women&#x27;s basketball tournament and will host again in 2022 and 2026.

In odd-numbered years, the arena was regularly one of eight sites to host the first and second rounds of the men&#x27;s NCAA Basketball Tournament for the first ten years of its existence, though it was taken out of the rotation for several years, partly due to the obsolete octagonal mid-1990s-style scoreboard that hung above the arena floor. It was replaced in the summer of 2007 by a new $5 million scoreboard and digital control room. The NCAA Tournament returned to Nashville in 2012.

Beginning in 2002, the arena hosted a Professional Bull Riders (PBR) Premier Series event every year (except in 2005 and 2006) through 2019 and again in 2021. The event moved to the Arena in 2002 after having previously occupied the Municipal Auditorium from 1993 through 2001. Since 2022, Bridgestone Arena is the home venue of the Nashville Stampede; one of ten bull riding teams of the PBR Team Series held during the summer and autumn in the United States. 

The venue has also hosted numerous concerts and religious gatherings. Beginning in 2006, the Country Music Association Awards have been held in the arena, after the awards show moved from the Grand Ole Opry House with a one-year stop in New York City at Madison Square Garden in 2005.

Due to the 2012–13 NHL lockout, the Predators did not host any games that season until January 19, 2013. Instead, the arena hosted a Southern Professional Hockey League preseason game between the only other Tennessee pro hockey franchise, the Knoxville Ice Bears, and their cross-border rivals Huntsville Havoc on October 20.

==Seating capacity==
Bridgestone Arena has a seating capacity of 17,159 for ice hockey, 19,395 for basketball, 10,000 for half-house concerts, 18,500 for end-stage concerts and 20,000 for center-stage concerts, depending on the configuration used. It has also hosted several professional wrestling events and a boxing card since its opening.

The seating configuration is notable for the oddly-shaped south end, which features two large round roof support columns, no mid-level seating, and only one level of suites, bringing the upper-level seats much closer to the floor.

The arena can be converted into the 5,145-seat Music City Theater, used for theater concerts and Broadway and family shows, by placing a stage at the north end of the arena floor and hanging a curtain behind the stage and another to conceal the upper deck. The arena also features of space in a trade show layout. 

Nate Bargatze set the attendance record on April 15, 2023, with 19,365 fans in attendance. The previous record (19,292) had been set six weeks earlier by Morgan Wallen. Kacey Musgraves set the record for the highest attendance for a female headliner with 18,373 fans during the Oh, What a World: Tour. Which was later broken again by Cody Johnson on February 2nd 2024 with a sold out show of 20,000 fans in attendance for the Leather album tour

===Concerts===
==Awards and nominations==
The Bridgestone Arena was nominated for the 2007 Pollstar Concert Industry Venue of the Year Award. This is the fourth time the venue has been nominated. The first was in 1998 as the Nashville Arena, and then in 1999 and 2000 as the Gaylord Entertainment Center. In 2017 it was named loudest arena in sports.

==Naming rights==

When completed in 1996, the venue was known as Nashville Arena. In 1999, the arena was renamed Gaylord Entertainment Center after a 20-year, $80 million naming rights contract was signed between the Predators and Nashville-based Gaylord Entertainment Company, which at the time was a minority owner of the team.

In February 2005, it was announced that the Predators and Gaylord (which had earlier sold its stake in the team) had reached an agreement terminating any further involvement between them, and that the Gaylord name would remain on the building only until a new purchaser could be found for the naming rights. As a result, many in the Nashville media quickly reverted to calling the facility by its original name. With the beginning of the 2006 season, the Predators began referring to the arena by its original name as well. In doing so, the team replaced the &quot;Gaylord Entertainment Center&quot; wordmark on the center ice circle with the original &quot;Nashville Predators&quot; wordmark from the inaugural season. The &quot;Gaylord Entertainment Center&quot; name, however, was still displayed on the building&#x27;s exterior signage at that point.

The facility was officially renamed Nashville Arena again, and all Gaylord signage was removed from the building&#x27;s exterior on March 16, 2007.

On May 18, 2007, Sommet Group, a Franklin-based collection of companies whose services included human resources administration, payroll processing, software development, computer repair, insurance, and risk management bought the naming rights to the arena, and it became known as Sommet Center. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The company had previously been the corporate title sponsor for the Predators during the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs. The agreement had lasted little more than two years when the Predators sued the Sommet Group on November 25, 2009, for breach of contract, alleging the latter had failed to make numerous payments under the naming rights agreement. As part of the suit, the Predators stated intentions to seek a new title sponsor for the arena. Unlike the Gaylord parting-of-ways, Sommet Group&#x27;s name was stripped from all signage inside and outside the arena as soon as the team was legally allowed to do so. The arena reverted to the Nashville Arena name after a Nashville Sports Authority meeting approving the change on December 3, 2009. On July 6, 2010, Sommet Group&#x27;s headquarters were raided by the FBI and IRS due to suspicion of fraudulent activities, and the company subsequently filed for bankruptcy and was liquidated. Sommet&#x27;s founder, Brian Whitfield, was eventually convicted of fraud, including using some of the fraudulent funds to secure the arena naming rights.

The building briefly resumed using the Nashville Arena moniker until February 23, 2010, when it was announced that the Predators had signed a naming rights deal with Nashville-based Bridgestone Americas, Inc., the North American subsidiary of Japanese tire manufacturer Bridgestone. The arena became known as Bridgestone Arena.

==Renovations==
In the summer of 2007 a number of renovations were made to what was then called the Sommet Center at a cost of several million dollars. Renovations included changes to concession stands and public areas, as well as major changes to infrastructure. The most obvious change was the August 2007 replacement of the original center-hanging scoreboard (at a cost of $3.6 million) with a new scoreboard made by ANC Sports. The original analog scoreboard had become outdated and was no longer supported by the original manufacturer, making parts difficult to come by. The new scoreboard is referred to as the &quot;megatron&quot; by arena and Predators staff. In addition, the TV–media control room was renovated at a cost of $2.6 million.

During the summer of 2011, a new NHL-mandated ice and dasherboard system was constructed and installed in the arena. In addition, the south side of the upper concourse was redesigned as a &quot;fan zone&quot;. The wall separating the arena and that part of the upper concourse was removed.

In the summer of 2015, the Predators began replacing all of the arena&#x27;s seating. This project was completed in Summer of 2016.

In the summer of 2019, the scoreboard above center ice was replaced with a new model known as &quot;FangVision&quot; which measures high and wide, along with the replacement of urinals in the men&#x27;s toilets with waterless versions.

==Flood damage==
Twice in the building&#x27;s history, event level space (located below street level) has sustained significant flood damage.

In early May 2010, downtown Nashville was heavily impacted by a major flooding event. Located 0.3 miles away and uphill from the bank of the Cumberland River, Bridgestone Arena escaped heavy damage, but drainage system backups caused several inches of standing flood water to seep into the building. The Predators had been eliminated from the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs the week prior, and the arena&#x27;s schedule was mostly clear for the remainder of May as a result. No events were affected by cleanup and repairs.

On November 25, 2022, a water main beneath Demonbreun Street ruptured, spilling thousands of gallons of water into the arena. Two Predators games were postponed as a result, and a college hockey game planned for Bridgestone Arena was moved to another facility in Nashville.

<doc id="636570" wikidata="Q3369299" url="?curid=636570" title="Privy seal">
<text>A privy seal is the personal seal of a reigning monarch, used to authenticate official documents of a personal nature, in contrast to a great seal, which is used for documents of greater importance.

==Privy Seal of England==

The Privy Seal of England can be traced back to the reign of King John. It has been suggested that it was originally the seal that accompanied the person of the Sovereign, while the Great Seal was required to remain in the Chancery. Eventually, the Privy Seal took on a broader function and was replaced by the Signet as the king&#x27;s personal seal. The Great Seal Act 1884 (47 &amp; 48 Vict. c. 30) effectively ended the use of the Privy Seal in England by providing that it was no longer necessary for any instrument to be passed under the Privy Seal.

==Privy Seal of Scotland==

There is also a separate Privy Seal of Scotland, which existed from at least the reign of Alexander III.

Article XXIV of the Treaty of Union provided that

The Seal was last used in 1898 to execute the commission appointing the Rev. James Cooper to a Regius Chair at the University of Glasgow, but has never been abolished. The office of Keeper of the Privy Seal has not been filled since the death of the Marquess of Breadalbane in 1922.

==Privy Seal of Ireland==
The &quot;signet or privy seal&quot; of the Kingdom of Ireland was a single seal, whereas in England and Scotland the signet was a separate seal kept by the Clerk of the Signet and Keeper of the Signet respectively. Fiants were issued under the privy seal or signet seal by the Keeper of the Signet or Privy Seal to authorise the issue of letters patent by the Lord Chancellor of Ireland under the Great Seal of Ireland.
==Privy Seal of Japan==
The Privy Seal of Japan is the official seal of the Emperor of Japan. While it is printed on many state documents, it is separate from the State Seal of Japan. The Privy Seal was made from copper beginning in the Nara period. After the Meiji Restoration, a new seal was made from stone in 1868. The present seal was made from gold in 1874.

The Seal has been kept by the Chamberlain of Japan since 1945, when the office of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal was abolished. The Lord Keeper was a personal adviser to the Emperor, a position adapted in 1885 from the earlier post of &quot;Naidaijin&quot;.

<doc id="636579" wikidata="Q6405248" url="?curid=636579" title="Kielder Forest">
<text>Kielder Forest is a large forestry plantation in Northumberland, England, surrounding Kielder village and the Kielder Water reservoir. It is the largest man-made woodland in England with three-quarters of its covered by forest. The majority of the forest lies within Kielder Water and Forest Park, with the southern tip known as Wark Forest lying within Northumberland National Park. The forest is next to the Anglo-Scottish border.

==History==
The forest is owned and managed by Forestry England, which (as the Forestry Commission) initiated the first plantings in the 1920s. During the 1930s, the Ministry of Labour supplied men from among the ranks of the unemployed. Many came from the mining communities and shipyards of North East England. They were housed in one of a number of instructional centres created by the Ministry, most of them on Forestry England property; by 1938, the Ministry had 38 Instructional Centres across Britain. The hutted camp in Kielder is now under Kielder Water. Numerous purpose-built villages were also constructed for workers&#x27; families, including Stonehaugh.

Prior to the 1920s, the land was predominantly open moorland, managed for grouse shooting and sheep grazing with remnants of native upland woodland existing along stream sides and in isolated craggy areas. Forestry England, funded from the public purse, purchased land across the country with the brief of establishing a strategic reserve of timber for the nation. This single objective held sway until the 1960s. Since that time, management principles have changed in order to reflect rising awareness of environmental needs and to provide recreational facilities whilst seeking to maintain a sustainable supply of timber. Kielder today remains state-owned and its development from a single-objective plantation to a multi-purpose forest mirrors the development of plantation forestry across the United Kingdom.

Many archaeological remains can be found within the forest and are an important cultural link to the often turbulent history of the area.

==Geography==
The name &quot;Kielder Forest&quot; is often also applied to the area of hills and remote moorland that surround the forestry plantations. The group of hills merges into the Cheviots to the north-east but is generally well-defined on other sides. It reaches a maximum height of at Peel Fell and also contains the Marilyns of Sighty Crag and Larriston Fells. These hills, despite not being very high, are particularly remote owing to the scarcity of settlement in the region. Indeed, Sighty Crag is the furthest hill in England from a road, at four miles&#x27; distance.

==Environment==
===Trees===
Kielder is dominated by conifers. Sitka spruce (&quot;Picea sitchensis&quot;) covers 75% of the planted area; this species thrives in the damp conditions afforded by northern Britain. Other species include Norway spruce (&quot;Picea abies&quot;) and lodgepole pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot;), which cover 9% of the area each. The remainder is made up of Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;), larch (&quot;Larix&quot; spp.), Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;), and broadleaves including birch (&quot;Betula&quot; spp.), rowan (&quot;Sorbus aucuparia&quot;), cherry (&quot;Prunus&quot; spp.), oak (&quot;Quercus&quot; spp.), beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;), and willow (&quot;Salix&quot; spp.).

===Timber===
475,000 cubic metres of timber are harvested annually to supply local sawmilling, chipboard, pulp and wood fuel customers. Most of this volume comes from clearfelling areas; an increasing percentage however is sourced from stands harvested under continuous cover silviculture systems. Clear-felled areas are replanted with a mix of coniferous and broadleaf tree species; opportunities are also taken to increase the proportion of open space and to improve the riparian habitat. As with all Forestry England&#x27;s woodlands, the timber is independently certified under the Forest Stewardship Council scheme.

===Wildlife===
The forest contains a number of sites of special scientific interest, primarily associated with the upland moorland environment. A programme of restoration of Border mires is ongoing.

The forest is also home to around 50% of England&#x27;s red squirrel population, and is their biggest remaining stronghold in the country. The best place to catch a glimpse of one is at the squirrel hide at Kielder waterside. It also provides excellent habitat for many species of birds of prey. In 2009 a pair of osprey (&quot;Pandion haliaetus&quot;) nested successfully in the forest. This pair have continued to nest there each year since, and a second pair nested in 2011. In 2014 eight young were fledged and by 2016 there were four nesting osprey pairs fledging eleven young. A large population of roe deer is actively managed.

Due to the low human population and scarcity of roads and railways, Kielder Forest was proposed in July 2016 as one of the preferred reintroduction sites for the Eurasian lynx, which has been extinct in Britain for 1,300 years. Interest in reintroducing the species was further bolstered in 2016 in relation to a successful breeding programme for the Iberian lynx in Spain.

==Recreation==

===Kielder Castle===

Kielder Castle Visitor Centre is an 18th-century hunting lodge built by the Duke of Northumberland, which has been converted into a visitor and information centre. It is located on the edge of Kielder Village at the head of the River North Tyne valley. The Castle serves as a hub for the growing number of recreational facilities on offer, walking and cycling trails, picnic areas and a forest drive. A great football match is reported to have taken place between the men of Tynedale and Redesdale at Kielder Castle in 1790.

===Other attractions===
The forest contains a number of art and architectural installations including a Skyspace designed by James Turrell and &quot;Wave Chamber&quot;, a camera obscura in a stone cairn by Chris Drury.

The forest also contains Kielder Observatory which is an astronomical observatory.

In 2010, former British distance runner Steve Cram inaugurated the Kielder Marathon which is a circuit around the lake taking in the surrounding gentle contours.

In the same decade the local authority began a reduction of late night street lights to enhance the dark skies of the park and sponsored observation facilities and advertising to attract visitors to the darkest skies in the mainland of Britain.

The Kielder forest has been used extensively for rallying. The forest&#x27;s tracks are regarded among crews and enthusiasts as particularly challenging, featuring lengthy straight sections on which very high speeds can be reached, but also deceptive corners, exacerbated by ditches that are very deep and close to the road and the often rough nature of the road surfaces. Notable Motorsport UK marshalls, such as Anthony Jamieson, hold the area in very high regard. Historically, the WRC RAC Rally would include several stages set in Kielder, often nicknamed &quot;Killer Kielder&quot; by commentators due to the high number of rally cars which could be expected to retire from the event at Kielder through accidents and mechanical failures. National rallies, Historic rallies, and British Rally Championship events continue to use the forest.

In 2020, an episode of series 11 of Michael Portillo&#x27;s &quot;Great British Railway Journeys&quot; featured Kielder Forest, referring to the 1936 &quot;Bradshaw&#x27;s Guide&quot;.

<doc id="636582" wikidata="Q5937348" url="?curid=636582" title="Human Remains (TV series)">
<text>Human Remains is a British black comedy television series written by and starring Rob Brydon and Julia Davis that aired in 2000. Each episode documented the relationship of a different couple, all of whom were played by Brydon and Davis and were unhappy, in the style of a fly on the wall documentary. The show&#x27;s humour derives from such bleak topics as domestic violence, chronic depression and death. Davis later used some of these themes in her solo project, &quot;Nighty Night&quot;. Ruth Jones, who would later work with Davis in &quot;Nighty Night&quot;, appears in the third episode. She would later co-write the acclaimed series &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;, in which both Brydon and Davis appear.

==Writing and production==
The series was written by Julia Davis and Rob Brydon, who were so sure of a commission they wrote all six episodes before finalising the deal. They wrote it in a flat in the same building complex where the late Kenneth Williams once lived. It was directed by Matt Lipsey and produced by Alison Mcphail. Executive producers were Henry Normal and Steve Coogan.

After creating the concept for the series, Davis and Brydon set about developing the material for the six episodes. Avoiding more conventional methods of writing the scripts, the pair instead opted to record themselves on camera and in character, to develop their various characters and written material. These recordings were then later on used as the basis for the written scripts.

==Episodes==
===&quot;An English Squeak&quot;===

The apparently bucolic aristo-existence of Peter and Flick is shadowed by an ailment on her part that makes physical intimacy impossible. Still reeling from the death of her true love Geoffrey, Flick has little time for the downtrodden, childish, and unimpressive Peter. However, he waits on his reluctant wife hand and foot, nursing her through her struggle with an imaginary illness which, in Flick&#x27;s own words, means &quot;penile accommodation is absolutely impossible&quot;, despite a highly suspicious relationship with her masseur. Flick rarely acknowledges this compassion, is utterly exasperated with Peter&#x27;s small stature, and is more than happy to bury him in the pet cemetery when his time to leave this world comes. Peter&#x27;s main goal is to win a juvenile showjumping competition he is taking part in, but this falls on his birthday, much to the annoyance of Flick, who has gone to great efforts to throw a children&#x27;s birthday party complete with clown and macabre piano music.

===&quot;Slither In&quot;===
&quot;Ignorance is bliss, that to me is the beauty of a coma&quot;. Brummie B&amp;B owners Gordon and Sheila fit their swinging lifestyle alongside looking after Sheila&#x27;s coma stricken sister. Despite a relatively happy marriage Sheila isn&#x27;t physically attracted to Gordon, describing the first time she saw him naked as &quot;like a road accident. Shocking, but you can&#x27;t help looking!&quot; Uneasy at the thought of eventually losing her sister Val, Sheila doesn&#x27;t know how to handle it. Gordon reminds her Val&#x27;s death will be a blessing, as they can expand their swinging room into the bedroom she currently occupied. The episode concludes with Val having been relegated to the corner of the room and covered in a dust sheet as the sex-dungeon &#x27;play room&#x27; is expanded into her current bedroom.

===&quot;All Over My Glasses&quot;===
Michelle and Stephen are planning their wedding day. The first dance is R-Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Bump and Grind&quot; and there are five boxes of Doritos for the reception. The more than a little &quot;simple&quot; Michelle seems oblivious to abusive yob Stephen&#x27;s latent homosexual tendencies, perhaps more preoccupied with her unhealthy obsession with Princess Diana. In fact, Michelle is so obsessed that on the night of Diana&#x27;s death she drove down to the local underpass to &quot;feel how she must have felt&quot;. Stephen was in the driver&#x27;s seat &quot;rightly or wrongly, speeding like a maniac&quot; and her Uncle Roy was Mr. Dodi, &quot;Laughing and swearing and that.&quot;

===&quot;Straight as a Flute&quot;===
When not making curly sausage casseroles for the vicar, Beverly and Tony survey their neighbour&#x27;s Satan-inspired garden and tell of life under the full gaze of the Lord. They do have other ways of keeping busy though, to the detriment of Tony&#x27;s heart. Whilst he isn&#x27;t conducting bizarre demonstrations at his workplace and Beverly isn&#x27;t dabbling in a bit of hair and beauty, they can be found attending to their dogs or indulging in Scottish country dancing. The pair also run &quot;top up&quot; meetings for their fellow church goers. As Beverly puts it &quot;If Church is your vaccination against Satan, these meetings are your boosters&quot;.

===&quot;Hairless&quot;===
&quot;My songs are like my children,&quot; says singer Fonte. &quot;Yet they&#x27;re also like my parents, or a special uncle who is particularly friendly at Christmas time&quot;. Fonte Bund seems to have no reservation at all about passing off the work of Alanis Morissette as her own (&quot;All I&#x27;m taking is the tune and the lyrics, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m taking&quot;), and is often casting aside her more creative musical partner Barne when it comes to singing - now opting to double up with her crippled lesbian pal Susan on stage. After the events of this episode, Fonte is left devastated after Susan&#x27;s death. But, as Barne puts it; &quot;If you&#x27;ve got an electric wheelchair and a cliffside bungalow, you&#x27;re asking for trouble, and that&#x27;s what she got!&quot;

===&quot;More Than Happy&quot;===
Coastal shopkeeper Les&#x27;s optimism has carried him and wife Ray through eight traumatic married years, which includes the loss of their children and subsequent suspicion that they were somehow involved. The two of them try and eke out a living by diversifying their trade as a florist by selling body piercings, bras and a banal range of sandwiches - &quot;We don&#x27;t do your fancy sandwiches, brown bread, or anything...&quot;
Ray seems to be getting ever more depressed by the loneliness, financial worries and the devastating events of the past. Her fleeting solace comes from an interest in arts and crafts (although she&#x27;s clearly no Picasso) and a rather painful form of sexual relief. Les comments, &quot;You hear of people who have all sorts of sexual hang-ups...and I&#x27;m one of them.&quot;

===&quot;The Fonte Bund Band Live&quot;===
Follow Fonte and Barne as they try to make a good impression as a support act at a real life music event. Will Fonte&#x27;s flirting and sugary compliments help their chances of securing a place on the tour bus? Or will creative differences as well as Fonte&#x27;s total hatred of Barne put a spanner in the works? Although in many respects a seventh episode, this special that was released as an extra on the 2003 DVD was never classed as part of the series as a whole, and differs in writing and visual style to the televised episodes.

== Reception ==
In 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;one of the best comedies in the past ten years&quot;. Vice wrote that it &quot;stands as one of Britain&#x27;s most unusual and innovative comedies&quot;.

<doc id="636587" wikidata="Q415159" url="?curid=636587" title="Rosuvastatin">
<text>Rosuvastatin, sold under the brand name Crestor among others, is a statin medication, used to prevent cardiovascular disease in those at high risk and treat abnormal lipids. It is recommended to be used together with dietary changes, exercise, and weight loss. It is taken orally (by mouth).
Common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, headaches, and muscle pains. Serious side effects may include rhabdomyolysis, liver problems, and diabetes. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Like all statins, rosuvastatin works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme found in the liver that plays a role in producing cholesterol.
Rosuvastatin was patented in 1991 and approved for medical use in the United States in 2003. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the thirteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 37million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023.

==Medical uses==
The primary use of rosuvastatin is for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in those at high risk and the treatment of abnormal lipids.

===Effects on cholesterol levels===
The effects of rosuvastatin on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are dose-related. Higher doses were more efficacious in improving the lipid profile of patients with hypercholesterolemia than milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of simvastatin and pravastatin.

Meta-analysis showed that rosuvastatin can modestly increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, as well as with other statins. A 2014 Cochrane review determined there was good evidence for rosuvastatin lowering non-HDL levels linearly with dose.

==Side effects and contraindications==
Side effects are uncommon:
* constipation
* heartburn
* dizziness
* sleeplessness
* depression
* joint pain
* cough
* memory loss or forgetfulness
* confusion

The following rare side effects are more serious. Like all statins, rosuvastatin can possibly cause myopathy, rhabdomyolysis:
* muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness
* lack of energy
* fever
* chest pain
* jaundice: yellowing of the skin or eyes
* dark colored, or foamy urine
* pain in the upper right part of the abdomen
* nausea
* extreme tiredness
* weakness
* unusual bleeding or bruising
* loss of appetite
* flu-like symptoms
* sore throat, chills, or other signs of infection

Allergic reactions can develop:
* rash
* hives
* itching
* difficulty breathing or swallowing
* swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs
* hoarseness
* numbness or tingling in fingers or toes

Rosuvastatin has multiple contraindications, including hypersensitivity to rosuvastatin or any component of the formulation, active liver disease, elevation of serum transaminases, pregnancy, or breastfeeding. Rosuvastatin is not prescribed nor used while pregnant, as it can cause serious harm to the fetus. In the case of breastfeeding, it is unknown whether rosuvastatin is passed through breast milk.

The risk of myopathy may be increased in Asian Americans: &quot;Because Asians appear to process the drug differently, half the standard dose can have the same cholesterol-lowering benefit in those patients, though a full dose could increase the risk of side effects, a study by the drug&#x27;s manufacturer, AstraZeneca, indicated.&quot; Therefore, the lowest dose is recommended in Asians.

===Myopathy===
As with all statins, there is a concern of rhabdomyolysis, a severe undesired side effect. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has indicated that &quot;it does not appear that the risk [of rhabdomyolysis] is greater with Crestor than with other marketed statins&quot;, but has mandated that a warning about this side-effect, as well as a kidney toxicity warning, be added to the product label.

===Diabetes mellitus===
Statins increase the risk of diabetes, consistent with FDA&#x27;s review, which reported a 27% increase in investigator-reported diabetes mellitus in rosuvastatin-treated people.

==Drug interactions==
The following drugs can have negative interactions with rosuvastatin and should be discussed with the prescribing doctor:
* Coumadin anticoagulants (&#x27;blood thinners&#x27;, e.g. warfarin) can affect the removal of rosuvastatin
* Ciclosporin, colchicine
* Drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, e.g. cimetidine, ketoconazole, and spironolactone
* Additional medications for high cholesterol such as clofibrate, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, and niacin (when taken in lipid-modifying doses of 1 g/day and above)
* Specific protease inhibitors including atazanavir (when taken with ritonavir), lopinavir/ritonavir and simeprevir
* Alcohol intake should be reduced while on rosuvastatin to decrease the risk of developing liver damage
* Aluminum and magnesium hydroxide antacids should not be taken within two hours of taking rosuvastatin
* Coadministration of rosuvastatin with eluxadoline may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis and myopathy

Grapefruit juice negatively interacts with several specific drugs in the statin class, but it has little or no effect on rosuvastatin.

==Structure==
Rosuvastatin has structural similarities with most other statins, e.g., atorvastatin, cerivastatin and pitavastatin, but unlike other statins, rosuvastatin contains sulfur (in sulfonyl functional group).
Crestor is a calcium salt of rosuvastatin, i.e. rosuvastatin calcium, in which calcium replaces the hydrogen in the carboxylic acid group on the right of the skeletal formula at the top right of this page.

==Mechanism of action==
Rosuvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, having a mechanism of action similar to that of other statins.

Putative beneficial effects of rosuvastatin therapy on chronic heart failure may be negated by increases in collagen turnover markers as well as a reduction in plasma coenzyme Q10 levels in patients with chronic heart failure.

==Pharmacodynamics==

The dose-related magnitude of rosuvastatin on blood lipids was determined in a Cochrane systematic review in 2014. Over the dose range of 1 to 80 mg/day strong linear dose‐related effects were found; total cholesterol was reduced by 22.1% to 44.8%, LDL cholesterol by 31.2% to 61.2%, non-HDL cholesterol by 28.9% to 56.7% and triglycerides by 14.4% to 26.6%.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Absolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is about 20% and Cmax is reached in 3 to 5 hours; administration with food did not affect the AUC according to the original sponsor submitted clinical study and as per product label. However, a subsequent clinical study has shown a marked reduction in rosuvastatin exposure when administered with food. It is 88% protein bound, mainly to albumin. Fraction absorbed of rosuvastatin is frequently misquoted in the literature as approximately 0.5 (50%) due to a miscalculated hepatic extraction ratio in the original submission package subsequently corrected by the FDA reviewer.

Rosuvastatin is metabolized mainly by CYP2C9 and not extensively metabolized; approximately 10% is recovered as metabolite &quot;N&quot;-desmethyl rosuvastatin. It is excreted in feces (90%) primarily and the elimination half-life is approximately 19 hours.

Both AUC and Cmax are approximately 2-fold higher in Asian patients compared to Caucasian patients given the same dose of rosuvastatin.

==Society and culture==
Rosuvastatin is the international nonproprietary name (INN).

===Economics===
Because low- to moderate dose statins are strongly recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults aged 40–75 years who are at risk, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in the United States requires most health insurance plans to cover the costs of these drugs without charging the insured patient a copayment or coinsurance, even if he or she has not yet reached his or her annual deductible. Rosuvastatin 5 mg and 10 mg are examples of regimens meeting the USPSTF guideline; however, insurers have discretion as to which low- and moderate-dose statin regimens to cover under this requirement, and some only cover other statins.

The drug was billed as a &quot;super-statin&quot; during its clinical development; the claim was that it offered high potency and improved cholesterol reduction compared to rivals in the class. The main competitors to rosuvastatin are atorvastatin and simvastatin. However, people can also combine ezetimibe with either simvastatin or atorvastatin and other agents on their own, for somewhat similar augmented response rates. some published information for comparing rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and ezetimibe/simvastatin results are available, but many of the relevant studies are still in progress.

First launched in 2003, sales of rosuvastatin were $129million and $908million in 2003, and 2004, respectively, with a total patient treatment population of over 4million by the end of 2004.
Annual cost to the UK National Health Service (NHS) in 2018, for 5–40 mg rosuvastatin daily (of one person) was £24-40, compared to £10-20 for 20–80 mg simvastatin.

In 2013, it was the fourth-highest-selling drug in the United States, accounting for approximately $5.2billion in sales. In 2021, it was the thirteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 32million prescriptions.

===Legal status===
Rosuvastatin is approved in the United States for the treatment of high LDL cholesterol (dyslipidemia), total cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia), and/or triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia). In February 2010, rosuvastatin was approved by the FDA for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.

, rosuvastatin had been approved in 154 countries and launched in 56. Approval in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) came on 13 August 2003.

===Patent protection and generic versions===
The main patent that protected rosuvastatin (RE37,314, which expired in 2016) was challenged as being an improper reissue of an earlier patent. This challenge was rejected in 2010, and thus patent protection continued until 2016.

In April 2016, the FDA approved the first generic version of rosuvastatin (from Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc). In July 2016, Mylan gained approval for its generic rosuvastatin calcium.

===Debate and criticisms===
In October 2003, several months after its introduction in Europe, Richard Horton, the editor of the medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot;, criticized the way Crestor had been introduced. &quot;AstraZeneca&#x27;s tactics in marketing its cholesterol-lowering drug, rosuvastatin, raise disturbing questions about how drugs enter clinical practice and what measures exist to protect patients from inadequately investigated medicines,&quot; according to his editorial. &quot;The Lancet&#x27;s&quot; editorial position is that the data for Crestor&#x27;s superiority rely too much on extrapolation from the lipid profile data (surrogate end-points) and too little on hard clinical end-points, which are available for other statins that had been on the market longer. The manufacturer responded by stating that few drugs had been tested so successfully on so many patients. In correspondence published in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, AstraZeneca&#x27;s CEO Tom McKillop called the editorial &quot;flawed and incorrect&quot; and slammed the journal for making &quot;such an outrageous critique of a serious, well-studied medicine.&quot;

In 2004, the consumer interest organization Public Citizen filed a Citizen&#x27;s Petition with the FDA, asking that Crestor be withdrawn from the US market. On 11 March 2005, the FDA issued a letter to Sidney M. Wolfe of Public Citizen both denying the petition and providing an extensive detailed analysis of findings that demonstrated no basis for concerns about rosuvastatin compared with the other statins approved for marketing in the United States. In 2015, Wolfe explained why he thought that &quot;the drug should have been withdrawn and why it should not be used&quot;, due to the incidence of rhabdomyolysis, renal problems, and significant increase in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and fasting insulin levels, and decreased insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients. Rosuvastatin indeed lowered cholesterol more than other statins, but Wolfe asked &quot;what about actually improving health, preventing heart attacks and strokes?&quot;

<text>Tanaji Kaloji Malusare or Subedar Tanaji Malusare was a military commander of the Maratha kingdom and a companion of Shivaji. A local poet Tulsidas, wrote a powada describing Subhedar Tanhaji&#x27;s heroics and sacrifice of life in the Battle of Sinhagad, which has since made him a popular figure in Indian folklore.

== Background ==
According to the historian David Hardiman, Kolis were the early helpers of Shivaji Maharaj in a revolt. Tanhaji Malusare is one such prominent example whose name is memorizalized due to his act of capturing the fort of Singhad and handing it to Shivaji. Tanhaji&#x27;s father&#x27;s name was Kaloji Malusare.

== Military career ==
Early military career

According to many historians including Jadunath Sarkar, Tanaji was involved in the capture of Torna fort or Battle of Torna (1646). In 1646, Shivaji along with his fellow commanders Netaji Palkar, Yesaji Kank, Baji Phalaskar and Tanaji Malusare captured the fort of Torna taking advantage of the illness of the Adil Shahi Sultan, Mohammad Adil Shah.

As an official Army Officer

Tanaji was with Shivaji Maharaj around the time when he took his pledge at Rayareshwar temple to establish a sovereign kingdom. He was the commander of Maratha troops in the Battle of Jawali and also in the Battle of Pratapgarh, where Shivaji Maharaj killed Afzal Khan.

Final Battle and Death

Shivaji following his reconquest, he sent Maratha forces under the command of Tanaji Malusare to recapture the fort of Sinhagad (then,Kondhana fort) at the night of 4 February 1670. Mughal Kiledar (fortress commander), Udaybhan Rathore and Tanaji was martyred in the battle but However, the Marathas recaptured the fort.

<doc id="636597" wikidata="Q201911" url="?curid=636597" title="CNAME record">
<text>A Canonical Name (CNAME) record is a type of resource record in the Domain Name System (DNS) that maps one domain name (an alias) to another (the [[Canonical form|canonical]] name).

This can prove convenient when running multiple services (like an FTP server &quot;and&quot; a web server, each running on different ports) from a single IP address. One can, for example, use CNAME records to point &quot;ftp.example.com&quot; and &quot;www.example.com&quot; to the DNS entry for &quot;example.com&quot;, which in turn has an A record which points to the IP address. Then, if the IP address ever changes, one only has to record the change in one place within the network: in the DNS A record for &quot;example.com&quot;.

CNAME records must always point to another domain name, never directly to an IP address.

== Details ==
DNS CNAME records are specified in and clarified in Section 10 of .

CNAME records are handled specially in the domain name system and have several restrictions on their use. When a DNS resolver encounters a CNAME record while looking for a regular resource record, it will restart the query using the canonical name instead of the original name. However, if the resolver is specifically told to look for CNAME records, the canonical name (right-hand side) is returned, rather than restarting the query. The canonical name that a CNAME record points to can be anywhere in the DNS, whether local or on a remote server in a different DNS zone.

For example, consider a DNS zone as follows:

When an A record lookup for &quot;bar.example.com&quot; is carried out, the resolver will see a CNAME record and restart the lookup for &quot;foo.example.com&quot; and will then return 192.0.2.23.

=== Possible confusion ===
With a CNAME record, one can point a name such as &quot;&quot;bar.example.com&quot; to &quot;foo.example.com&quot;. Because of this, during casual discussion, the &quot;bar.example.com.&quot;&quot; (left-hand) side of a DNS entry can be incorrectly identified as &quot;the CNAME&quot; or &quot;a CNAME&quot;. However, this is inaccurate. The canonical (true) name of &quot;&quot;bar.example.com&quot; is &quot;foo.example.com&quot;&quot;. Because CNAME stands for Canonical Name, the right-hand side is the &quot;actual&quot; &quot;CNAME&quot;; on the same side as the address &quot;A&quot;.

This confusion is specifically mentioned in RFC 2181, &quot;Clarifications to the DNS Specification&quot;. The left-hand label is an alias for the right-hand side (the RDATA portion), which &quot;is&quot; (or should be) a canonical name. In other words, consider the following CNAME record:

This may be read as saying that &quot;&quot;bar.example.com&quot; is an alias for the canonical name (CNAME) &quot;foo.example.com&quot;. A client will request &quot;bar.example.com&quot; and the answer will be &quot;foo.example.com&quot;&quot;.

=== Restrictions ===
== DNAME record ==
A DNAME record or Delegation Name record is defined by (original RFC 2672 is now obsolete). The DNAME record provides redirection (alias) for a subtree of the domain name tree in the DNS. That is, all names that end with a particular suffix are redirected to another part of the DNS. In contrast, the CNAME record creates an alias for a single name and not its subdomains. Like the CNAME record, the DNS lookup will continue by retrying the lookup with the new name. The name server synthesizes a CNAME record to actually apply the DNAME record to the requested name—CNAMEs for every node on a subtree have the same effect as a DNAME for the entire subtree.

For example, if there is a DNS zone as follows:

An A record lookup for &quot;foo.example.com&quot; will return no data because a DNAME is not a CNAME and there is no A record directly at &quot;foo&quot;.

However, a lookup for &quot;xyzzy.foo.example.com&quot; will be DNAME mapped and return the A record for &quot;xyzzy.bar.example.com&quot;, which is 192.0.2.24; if the DNAME record had been a CNAME record, this request would have returned name not found.

Lastly, a request for &quot;foobar.foo.example.com&quot; would be DNAME mapped and return 192.0.2.25.

== ANAME record ==

Several managed DNS platforms implement a non-standard ALIAS or ANAME record type. These pseudo records are managed by DNS administrators like CNAME records, but are published and resolved by (some) DNS clients like A records. ANAME records are typically configured to point to another domain, but when queried by a client, answer with an IP address. While ANAME record types were submitted for standardization, there are other non-conforming implementations, so they can do whatever the owner of the DNS platform chooses, including existing at the apex of a zone and existing for domains that receive mail.

The main advantage of ANAME records over CNAME records is that they can be used on a zone apex, while a standards-following resolver will not treat domain names with CNAME records as a zone apex.
Also, while a DNS client requires at least two queries to resolve a CNAME to an A record to an IP address, an ANAME will shift the second and subsequent query to the server. If the DNS server can resolve the A record and cache the requested IP address more efficiently and with less latency than its DNS clients can, then the DNS client can resolve the query faster.

The ANAME record type was submitted as a draft standard to IETF. However, the latest draft document expired in January 2020 and has been superseded by a series of proposals, the most recent of which is the one for the SVCB and HTTPS record types.

<doc id="636598" wikidata="Q4848886" url="?curid=636598" title="Baji Prabhu Deshpande">
<text>Baji Prabhu Deshpande ( 1615 – 13 July 1660) was a general of the Maratha Army. He is known for his role in the Battle of Pavan Khind at Ghod Khind, where he sacrificed his life defending Shivaji Maharaj from incoming Adil Shahi forces of Siddi Johar. He also was a landlord or &quot;Vatandar&quot; in the Maval region.

== Early life ==
Baji Prabhu was born around 1615 in a Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu family. Earlier he worked under Krishnaji Bandal of Rohida near Bhor. After Shivaji Maharaj defeated Krishnaji at Rohida and captured the fort, many commanders along with Baji Prabhu joined Shivaji Maharaj.

==Battle of Pavan Khind==

Shivaji Maharaj continued to push into the Bijapur territory, after defeating Afzal Khan and the rout of the Bijapur army at Pratapgad. Within a few days, the Marathas captured Panhala fort (near the city of Kolhapur). Meanwhile, another Maratha force, led by Netaji Palkar, pushed towards Bijapur. Bijapur forces repulsed this attack, forcing Shivaji Maharaj, some of his commanders and soldiers to retreat to Panhala fort.

The Bijapur troops was led by Siddhi Johar, an Abyssinian general. Discovering Shivaji Maharaj location, Johar laid siege to Panhala. Netaji Palkar made repeated attempts to break the Bijapur force siege from outside, but these failed.

A risky plan was then put into action: Shivaji Maharaj, Baji Prabhu Deshpande with a select band of troops would attempt to break through the siege at the night, and make for Vishalgad. In order to deceive the Bijapur forces, to avoid a chase if they found out that Shivaji Maharaj had broken the siege, Shiva Kashid a barber by profession, had physical resemblance to Shivaji Maharaj, volunteered to dress like the king and let himself be captured.

On a stormy full moon night (night of Guru Purnima) 600 men led by Baji Prabhu and Shivaji Maharaj, broke through the siege. They were pursued by the Bijapur force. As planned, Shiva Kashid allowed himself to be captured and taken back to the Bijapur camp, guessing that he would be put to death once the charade was discovered. This gave the fleeing Maratha force some breathing space.

As soon as the Bijapur force realized their mistake, the chase was on again, led by Siddhi Masood, the son-in-law of Siddhi Johar. Near the pass of Ghodkhind (Horse&#x27;s Pass), the Marathas made a final stand. Shivaji and half of the Maratha force pushed for Vishalgadh, while Baji Prabhu, his brother Phulaji and the remaining &quot;Bandal Sena&quot; of a few hundred men blocked the pass and fought against 10000 Bijapur soldiers in the &quot;Ghodkhind Pass&quot; for more than 18 hours.

Baji Prabhu used a weapon called &quot;Dand Patta&quot;. Through the battle, Baji Prabhu, though grievously injured, continued fighting, inspiring his men to fight on until Shivaji&#x27;s safe journey to Vishalgadh was signaled by the firing of three cannon volleys. It should be mentioned that when Shivaji Maharaj approached Vishalgad with 300 men, the fort was already under siege by Bijapur sardars named Suryarao Surve and Jaswantrao Dalvi. Shivaji Maharaj with his 300 men had to defeat Surve to reach the fort.

The Ghod Khind pass was subsequently named &quot;Pavan Khind&quot; (&quot;Holy Pass&quot;) by Shivaji, in honor of the sacrifice of Baji Prabhu and his troops.

==Descendants ==
Baji Prabhu Deshpande was born in Bhor, Maharashtra. The descendants of Baji Prabhu Deshpande still live in Bhor, and continue the fiery spirit of their ancestor.

Vishnu Narayan Deshpande, the 10th descendant and former Sarapanch of Parhar Budruk, was a freedom fighter. His wife Latika Deshpande was a relative of the author Ram Ganesh Gadkari. The family has a relationship with the family of Rango Bapuji Gupte. Vishnu Narayan Deshpande had four sons and four daughters. His son Dilip Deshpande helped people displaced by dam building, and farming is their family business. The family conducts social work and is aware of the legacy of Baji Prabhu.

One of Baji Prabhu Despande&#x27;s descendants, Ramchandra Kashinath Deshpande, was an Indian freedom fighter against the British rule, an educationalist and a social activist who worked in Dhule and Jalgaon. He participated in the Quit India Movement during the British rule and was imprisoned for 19 months in the Kolhapur Central Jail. He was congratulated after Independence by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. For his social work, he was given the title of ‘Special Executive Magistrate’ by the Maharashtra government in 1989.

<text>Frank A. Gerbode wrote of a method known as traumatic incident reduction (TIR). He is an Honors graduate of Stanford University and later pursued graduate studies in philosophy at Cambridge University. He received his medical degree from Yale University, and completed a psychiatric residency at Stanford University Medical Center in the early 1970s.

Gerbode is the author of numerous papers and articles, which have been published in the &quot;Journal of Neurochemistry&quot;, the &quot;International Journal of Neuropharmacology&quot;, the &quot;Journal of Rational Emotive and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&quot;, &quot;IRM Newsletter&quot; and elsewhere. They include at least one article in &quot;Nature&quot; 

He teaches and lectures internationally, and is the author of &quot;Beyond Psychology: An Introduction to Metapsychology&quot; (), published in 1988. This book provided the first published description of TIR.

He edited the special issue &quot;Trauma treatment techniques : innovative trends&quot; of Haworth Press&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment &amp; Trauma&quot;.

Gerbode was for many years a Scientologist, and at one time ran the Palo Alto, California Mission of Scientology. He broke from the Church of Scientology in 1982. He later developed TIR, starting from Dianetics and working back to its origins.

In 1984, Gerbode founded the Institute for Research in Metapsychology and the Center for Applied Metapsychology in Palo Alto, California. Today, this function is fulfilled by the Traumatic Incident Reduction Association, a division of Applied Metapsychology International.

Gerbode currently resides in Sonoma, California.

== Gerbode and &quot;Modern Metapsychology&quot; ==
Frank A. Gerbode created a psychotherapeutic modality (whose adherents often characterize it as a &quot;movement&quot;) that he called &quot;metapsychology,&quot; forming the term not as a compound of &quot;psychology&quot; with the prefix &quot;meta,&quot; but as a portmanteau representing a fusion of metaphysics and psychology. Gerbode uses a client-centered approach that supports clients in their efforts to improve their self-organization, enhancing their strength for coping with past negative experiences. Using metapsychology as the basis, Gerbode uses traumatic incident reduction (TRI) to treat people experiencing psychological effects from traumatic incidents or clients suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. Gerbode&#x27;s Metapsychology is a theoretically explicit psychology, which has the main purpose to connect the mind and body while maintaining a client-centered setting. It serves as a solid base in a client-centered psychology system because it involves what is common in experience, leading to an agreement and understanding It considers different aspects and views from the client to explain how the psychological issue is functioning in whole. This psychology is meant to emphasize the experiences as viewed by the client and not by the views of a psychologist trying to find out what the experience means to that person. Metapsychology allows people to recognize that they are in control of their own experiences. Once they can recognize these experiences, then they become aware of ways in which they can improve themselves and the environment around them. The &quot;modern metapsychology&quot; movement was founded by psychiatrist Frank A. Gerbode, and frames therapy as a way of developing the spirit for personal growth, rather than as a treatment for mental disorders. Gerbode&#x27;s reasoning in his choice of the term &quot;metapsychology&quot; is best illustrated in his formulation, &quot;While parapsychology and metaphysics concern themselves with uncommon experiences, metapsychology deals with what is common in experience.&quot;

Note that while the term &quot;parapsychology&quot; is universally understood (by its practitioners and critics alike) to refer to the study of unexplained powers of the human mind, &quot;metaphysics&quot; has two separate meanings that have little to do with each other. In the popular discourse of the New Age movement, upon which Gerbode&#x27;s work draws, metaphysics is an important but vague term with a broad range of usages, generally having to do with &quot;alternatives&quot; to physics, rather than philosophical foundations for it. New Age metaphysics concerns claims about the numerous elements of New Age culture including reincarnation, divination, psychedelics, and parapsychology (each of which has its own history and outside the New Age movement). But among philosophers, metaphysics is a term coined by Aristotle, denoting the branch of philosophy that engages with fundamental questions that transcend physics (especially ontology, the study of existence and being). Gerbode used the term in its New Age sense, not the philosophical one.

Gerbode has a main focus in traumatic incident reduction (TIR) which is a very structured and self-centered process that is used to lessen the negative effects of past traumas and encourage the person to become more aware of their inner strengths and embrace them. In 1985, he founded the Applied Metapsychology International (AMI). The main objective of this group was to develop metapsychological &quot;techniques, methods, and training material&quot; for psychologists seeking to practice TIR. Gerbode strongly believed in TIR as a way to treat patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). His metapsychology promotes a person-centered process, based on direct experiences, to eliminate psychological symptoms experienced by people who experiences traumatic incidents.

<doc id="636608" wikidata="Q1930787" url="?curid=636608" title="Shadow Warrior (1997 video game)">
<text>Shadow Warrior is a first-person shooter video game developed by 3D Realms and published by GT Interactive. The shareware version was released for the PC on May 13, 1997, while the full version was completed on August 25, 1997 and released in stores on September 16, 1997.
&quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; was developed using Ken Silverman&#x27;s Build engine and improved on 3D Realms&#x27; previous Build engine game, &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;. Mark Adams ported &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; to Mac OS in August 1997.

The game&#x27;s improvements included introduction of true room-over-room situations, the use of 3D voxels instead of 2D sprites for weapons and usable inventory items, transparent water, climbable ladders, and assorted vehicles to drive (some armed with weapons). Although violent, the game had its own sense of humor and contained some sexual themes. A combination of &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; and &quot;Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition&quot; was published by GT Interactive in March 1998, titled &quot;East Meets West&quot;.

In 2005, 3D Realms released the source code for &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; (including compiled Build engine object code) under the GPL-2.0-or-later license, which resulted in the first source port a day later on April 2, 2005. In 2013, Devolver Digital announced the game would be free to obtain for a limited time on Steam. Later, Devolver Digital announced that they would permanently offer the game for free.

A reboot, also titled &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot;, was developed by Flying Wild Hog and published by Devolver Digital, launched on September 26, 2013.

==Plot==
Lo Wang is a bodyguard and enforcer for Zilla Enterprises, a powerful conglomerate that controls every major industry in a futuristic Japan. Although he is aware of the unchecked corruption and crime that has resulted from Zilla Enterprises&#x27; dominance, Lo Wang is too content with his well-paid position to challenge his employers. This changes when Master Zilla, the company president who desires even more power and wealth, embarks on a plan to conquer Japan using creatures from the &quot;dark side&quot;, having formed an alliance with the ancient deities that rule over them. When he discovers this, Lo Wang finds he can no longer stomach Zilla&#x27;s evil and quits his job. Master Zilla soon realizes the threat that Lo Wang poses and orders the creatures to kill him.

Forced to fight for his life, Lo Wang manages to slaughter dozens of Zilla&#x27;s minions until he discovers that Zilla also had his old mentor, Master Liep, murdered. Following his mentor&#x27;s dying words, Lo swears to put an end to Zilla&#x27;s schemes. The game ends with Lo Wang defeating Master Zilla, who tries and fails to kill him while piloting a massive war mech styled after a samurai. However, Zilla is able to escape, and informs his old bodyguard that they will meet again someday.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; is a first-person shooter similar to &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; and using the same Build engine. Players navigate the protagonist, Lo Wang, through three-dimensional environments or &quot;levels&quot;. Throughout levels are enemies that attack Lo Wang, which can be killed by the player using weapons such as a katana. &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; also features puzzles that must be solved to progress in various levels.

Lo Wang&#x27;s arsenal of weaponry includes Japanese-themed weapons such as shurikens—which were &quot;likely [to] be dropped in favor of [a] high tech fun weapon&quot; in development—and a katana, and marked the first appearance of a sticky bomb in an FPS, an idea popularized later by &quot;&quot;. It also includes guns such as Uzis, a riot gun that fires shotgun shells, and the &quot;Eraser&quot;-inspired railgun (Lo Wang frequently says &quot;Time to get erased! Ha ha!&quot; when picking up this weapon). In addition, the head and heart of certain enemies can be used as weapons.

&quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; was an ambitious game, containing many features not seen until later first-person shooter games. For example, the game features turrets and various vehicles (such as tanks) that the player can drive around freely in, climbable ladders, and multiple firing modes for various weapons.

==Development==
Development of &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; began in early 1994 as &quot;Shadow Warrior 3D&quot;, and preliminary screenshots were released with &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; in May 1994. Jim Norwood came up with the game idea, George Broussard designed the character Lo Wang and Michael Wallin did some concept sketches.

Broussard in 1996 stated: &quot;We want Shadow Warrior to surpass Duke Nukem 3D in features and gameplay and that&#x27;s a TALL order.&quot; To this end, more tongue-in-cheek humor was added to the existing game in order to better match the style of the popular &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;. The shareware version of &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; was published in North America by GT Interactive on May 13, 1997, and the full version was published on September 12, 1997. At E3 1997, an area in the GT Interactive booth was dedicated to &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot;.

===Soundtrack===
Lee Jackson, who had already composed the soundtrack for &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; also composed the soundtrack for &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot;. A Kurzweil K2500RS keyboard was used to produce the music. &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; uses the audio tracks of the game&#x27;s CD for music playback rather than the system&#x27;s MIDI device, which allows for a higher general quality and the use of samples and effects not possible with MIDI music. This allowed Lee Jackson to include a wide variety of instruments which support the game&#x27;s East Asian theme as well as to include ambient tracks which depend on advanced sound design. MIDI support including MIDI versions of five songs from the game&#x27;s soundtrack was added exclusively to the shareware version which had to be kept small in size.

A special song called &quot;Lo Wang&#x27;s Rap&quot; was included in one of the game disc&#x27;s audio tracks. It was created out of sound bites and outtakes from recording sessions with John William Galt, the voice actor cast in the role of Lo Wang. This song was played during the credits sequence after completing the game. Jackson wrote and recorded a backing music track and then used a DAW to arrange the vocals over it in a way that made it sound like Lo Wang was actually rapping. The song was released as an MP3 on 3D Realms&#x27; website in 1999.

===Expansion packs===
Two expansion packs, &quot;Wanton Destruction&quot; and &quot;Twin Dragon&quot;, were released. The third one, &quot;Deadly Kiss&quot; from SillySoft, remains unreleased, but screenshots were released in January 1998.

* Twin Dragon was released as a free download on July 4, 1998. It was created by Level Infinity and Wylde Productions. The game reveals that Lo Wang has a twin brother, Hung Lo, with whom he was separated in early childhood. Hung Lo becomes a dark person whose goal is to destroy the world. Similar to Master Zilla, he uses the creatures from the &quot;dark side&quot;, criminal underworld and Zilla&#x27;s remnants to further his goals. Lo Wang has to journey through his dark minions, reach his palace and defeat the evil Twin Dragon Hung Lo once and for all. The game features 13 new levels, new sounds, artwork and a new final boss, Hung Lo, who replaced Zilla.
* Wanton Destruction was created by Sunstorm Interactive and tested by 3D Realms, but was not released by the distributor. Charlie Wiederhold presented the four maps he created to 3D Realms, and was consequently hired as a level designer for &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot;. With permission, he released the maps on March 22, 2004. On September 5, 2005, Anthony Campiti—former president of Sunstorm Interactive—notified 3D Realms by e-mail that he found the &quot;Wanton Destruction&quot; add-on, and it was released for free on September 9, 2005. The add-on chronicles Lo Wang&#x27;s adventures after the original game. He visits his relatives in USA, but is forced to fight off Zilla&#x27;s forces again. The game culminates with a battle against Master Zilla above the streets of Tokyo, which ends with Master Zilla&#x27;s death. The game features 12 new levels, new artwork and a couple of new enemy replacements, such as human enemies; though they still act as their original counterparts.

==Reception==
NPD Techworld, a firm that tracked sales the United States, reported 118,500 units sold of &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; by December 2002. The shareware version has been downloaded 400,000 times.

Reviews from critics are mostly positive and ratings vary from average to positive. Thierry Nguyen of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; commented: &quot;Shadow Warrior is an average action game. While there are some good enhancements to the BUILD engine and some good level design and enemy AI, the rest of the game is mediocre.&quot; By contrast, &quot;GamePro&quot; said that &quot;&quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; scores high in both style and level design. ... It&#x27;s enhanced by a high difficulty level, a great audio soundtrack, and ambient music and environments you can can really believe exist ...&quot; Tim Soete of &quot;GameSpot&quot; called it &quot;a late entry into the realm of sprite-based action games that&#x27;s pretty fun despite its dated qualities.&quot; &quot;AllGame&quot; editor Jason White described it as &quot;a solid game&quot; and &quot;a keeper&quot;.

===Legacy===
3D Realms released the source code of the &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; engine on April 1, 2005 under the GPL-2.0-or-later license. Due to the timing of the source code release, some users initially believed that it was an April Fools joke. The first source port, &quot;JFShadowWarrior&quot;, was created by Jonathon Fowler and released a day later on April 2, 2005, including Linux support and improvements from his &quot;JFDuke3D&quot; source port. It was later forked by Ben &quot;ProASM&quot; Smit for the SWP port. &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; for iOS was released on December 19, 2012 by 3D Realms and indie developer General Arcade. Modern source ports for the game include WangGDX, VoidSW and its forks IcedSW and Raze.

The official website was created by Jeffrey D. Erb and Mark Farish of Intersphere Communications Ltd.

Two original novels featuring Lo Wang were published. &quot;For Dead Eyes Only&quot; was written by Dean Wesley Smith and &quot;You Only Die Twice&quot; by Ryan Hughes. The titles of the novels parody titles in the &quot;James Bond&quot; book series by Ian Fleming.

<text>A yacht club is a boat club specifically related to yachting.

==Description==
Yacht clubs are mostly located by the sea, although there some that have been established at a lake or riverside locations. Yacht or sailing clubs have either a marina or a delimited section of the beach or shoreline with buoys marking the areas off-limits for swimmers as well as safe offshore anchorages. On shore they also include a perimeter reserved for the exclusive use of the members of the club as well as a clubhouse with attached bar, café or restaurant where members socialize in a pleasant and informal setting.

Although the terms &quot;Yacht Club&quot; and &quot;Sailing Club&quot; tend to be synonymous, some general differences regarding the recreational use of boats can be broadly outlined. Historically a &quot;Yacht Club&quot; tended to focus on a membership composed of yacht owners, including motorboats. This type of club often was extremely exclusive, attracting the aristocracy or the high class and leaving small boat owners out of the circle. On the other hand, a &quot;Sailing Club&quot; tended to focus on a membership composed exclusively of owners of sailboats, including smaller boats such as dinghies. These became very popular towards the end of the 19th century when small boats began to be produced on an industrial scale.

Yacht clubs are often known by their initials (e.g. New York Yacht Club abbreviated as NYYC and Kingston Yacht Club abbreviated as KYC). Many well known yacht clubs, including the Yacht Club de France, the Yacht Club Italiano and the Royal Yacht Squadron, have been established under royal patronage or have been granted the title at some point in their history.

Organized and run by the membership, Yacht Clubs became a place to promote the sport of sailboat racing and cruising, as well as provide a meeting place for the particular social community. The membership is a mixture of people with specific recreational affinities, and the members often include those who sail as crew for cruising or racing, as well as boat owners. Also it is up to the members decide on the objectives of the club to satisfy the membership and to attract other like-minded individuals. For example, some clubs include owners of powerboats, while others specifically exclude them. In order to overcome difficulties concerning the affinities of their members one particular club may have two sections, a sailing section and a powerboat section.

Members Clubs often have paid staff for catering, bar duty, boat yard duty, accounts, office etc. Control and organization of the club is done for the membership via members elected by the membership into roles such as Sailing Secretary, Commodore, Cruising Captain, Racing Captain etc. Smaller clubs typically have a condition of membership which requires active participation of the membership in activities such as maintenance of club facilities and equipment.

Unlike the classical clubs where the membership is the focus, certain &#x27;clubs&#x27; are run on a commercial basis. They may be owned by individuals or a company to provide a service and generate a profit. Often they are associated with a particular marina or port. Objectives are usually broadly similar to members clubs, but the social side may be more dominant.

==Traditions==

There is a long historical tradition behind yacht clubs. According to the date of establishment, the Neva Yacht Club, founded in 1718 in Russia, is the oldest yacht club. However, since this Russian Yacht Club was established by a decree of Tsar Peter the Great, it does not fully qualify as a proper club in the modern sense, understood as a voluntary association of members who organize and run the club. Therefore, the Royal Cork Yacht Club founded in Ireland in 1720 is also widely acknowledged as the oldest yacht club in the world, despite having gone through periods of dormancy and undergone name changes in its long history, much in the same manner as the Neva Yacht Club. It was only in 1846 that the first yacht club in Russia to adopt British-style Members Club regulations was established. Using this Western understanding of what a club or society is, the Royal Swedish Yacht Club, KSSS, founded 1830, becomes the oldest European yacht club outside the British Isles, and the fifth oldest in the world.

A number of the world&#x27;s most renowned Yacht Clubs are located in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Canada, and the United States. The first yacht club in North America was the Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Squadron, located on the Northwest Arm in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada established in July 1837. Some yacht clubs are affiliated with an international body, the International Council of Yacht Clubs, which exists to improve the quality of the services yacht clubs provide to their members as well as to promote environmental awareness and responsibility towards the environment.

The Kieler Yacht-Club in Northern Germany organizes the yearly Kiel Week, the second-biggest sailing event in the world, that is celebrated since 1882. Kiel Week was an attempt to imitate the much older and larger Cowes Week, long-admired by Wilhelm II.

===Racing and sailing activities===
Most clubs, regardless of the size of their craft, have a well defined racing program. Clubs may host regattas ranging from informal local events to national championships. Often clubs have a regular weekday evening racing schedule or a weekend racing schedule organized by the membership. Many yacht clubs field teams to compete against other clubs in team racing. There are also some specific boat models and lengths which have their own club. These boat ownership clubs often hold single design races for their members. With the growth of sailing at secondary schools and universities many yacht clubs host Interscholastic Sailing Association or Intercollegiate Sailing Association regattas. Additionally, a number of yacht clubs enter into agreements with schools to provide dock space and practice facilities for the school teams year-round.

Clubs with active adult sailing programs most often feature junior sailing programs as well. Most often these programs enroll children from ages 8 to 16. Children most often learn to sail in the optimist (dinghy) and then progress to a larger single handed dinghy such as starling or laser dinghy or two handed such as 420 (dinghy). These junior sailing programs often also teach children rowing, kayaking, general seamanship and navigation. Children are also taught how to race competitively from an early age and most clubs host junior sailing regattas each season.

===Yacht club burgee===
Members belonging to a yacht club or sailing organization may fly their club&#x27;s unique flag (usually triangular), called a &quot;burgee&quot;, both while under way and at anchor (however, not while racing). Traditionally, the burgee was flown from the main masthead; however, it may also be flown from a small pole on the bow pulpit, or on the starboard rigging beneath the lowest starboard spreader on a flag halyard. Some traditional clubs have also been granted the right to fly a special yacht ensign at the stern.

At traditional clubs the burgee and the ensign is hoisted at 08:00 each morning and lowered each evening at sunset. This ceremony is called colors. Traditionally, the first time a member of one club visits another, there is an exchange of burgees. Exchanged burgees are often displayed on the premises of clubs, such as at their clubhouse or bar.

===Organization===

Yacht clubs are organized like any other club or organisation with committees, chairman, directors, etc. Due to the connection with the sea and hence the navy, the various posts use naval terminology. For example, the chairman/CEO is the &quot;Commodore&quot;. Usually, under the Commodore there are also the &quot;Vice Commodore&quot; (in charge of land-based activities) and the &quot;Rear Commodore&quot; (in charge of water-based activities); for clubs in the United States they might in turn be assisted by the &quot;Port Captain&quot; and the &quot;Fleet Captain&quot; respectively. In a few clubs in the United Kingdom the &quot;Admiral&quot;, which is one rank &quot;above&quot; the Commodore, is the senior officer. Each of these ranks has specific responsibilities to ensure the smooth sailing of the club.

===Clubhouse or shore station===
Members of yacht clubs typically gather at a clubhouse or shore station which may also have docks. The oldest yacht club in the world without a clubhouse is Sheldrake Yacht Club (Mamaroneck, New York).

==Use of the term &quot;yacht club&quot;==

The traditions and prestige normally associated with yacht clubs have to some extent been subverted or appropriated unofficially by groups and businesses calling themselves &quot;yacht clubs&quot;. For example, the &quot;Gowanus Yacht Club&quot; is a beer garden restaurant in Brooklyn, NY, the Van Buren Yacht Club is a bar and hotel in Maine, the &quot;Crystal Bay Yacht Club&quot; is a beach resort in Ko Samui, Thailand and &quot;The Eagle Rock Yacht Club&quot; is a non-profit dodgeball league in Glassell Park, Los Angeles. These so-called &quot;yacht clubs&quot; don&#x27;t necessarily involve sailing on private yachts of members as their main purpose or activity, but often outwardly maintain a nautical or water-oriented theme.

Tonkin Gulf Yacht Club was the unofficial name for the United States Seventh Fleet during the Vietnam War. In this case the term &quot;yacht club&quot; was appropriated with humorous intentions. The Seventh Fleet&#x27;s nickname became very popular among its members at the time.

<text>William James Carter Mayne (16 March 1928 – 24 March 2010) was an English writer of children&#x27;s fiction. &quot;The Oxford Companion to Children&#x27;s Literature&quot; calls him one of the outstanding children&#x27;s authors of the 20th century and The Times Literary Supplement reportedly called him &quot;the most original good writer for young people in our time&quot;. In 2004, he was convicted of sexual abuse.

==Life==
Mayne was born in Hull, the son of a doctor. He attended school until the age of 17 but &quot;the only part of his education he valued&quot; was five years at the choir school attached to Canterbury Cathedral; those experiences were the foundation for his Choir School series of four novels. The school was evacuated during the Second World War from Kent to Cornwall. 

He lived for most of his life in North Yorkshire.

In 2004, Mayne was charged with eleven counts of indecent assaults of &quot;young girl fans&quot; aged between eight and sixteen. At trial one victim gave evidence of events some forty years in the past. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the prosecutor said Mayne had &quot;treated young visitors as adults&quot;. He was described in the courtroom as &quot;the greatest living writer of children&#x27;s books in English&quot;. Mayne had pleaded guilty to the charges, but his solicitor said he had done so while under huge stress and would try to clear his name. On conviction, Mayne was imprisoned for two and a half years and was placed on the sex offenders register for life. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Mayne&#x27;s books were largely deliberately removed from shelves from 2004 onwards&quot;, as a result of his conviction.

Mayne was found dead at his home in Thornton Rust, North Yorkshire, on the morning of 24 March 2010.

==Writer==

Mayne&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Follow the Footprints&quot;, was published in 1953. He wrote more than a hundred books, including the Choir School quartet, comprising &quot;A Swarm in May&quot;, &quot;Choristers&#x27; Cake&quot;, &quot;Cathedral Wednesday&quot; and &quot;Words and Music&quot; (1955–1963); and the Earthfasts trilogy, an unusual evocation of the King Arthur legend, comprising &quot;Earthfasts&quot;, &quot;Cradlefasts&quot; and &quot;Candlefasts&quot; (1966–2000).

For &quot;A Grass Rope&quot; he won the 1957 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book by a British subject. He was also a commended runner up for the Medal five times – twice in competition with himself – for &quot;A Swarm in May&quot; (1955), &quot;Choristers&#x27; Cake&quot; (1956), &quot;Member for the Marsh&quot; (1956), &quot;Blue Boat&quot; (1957), and &quot;Ravensgill&quot; (1970).
Finally he won the 1993 &quot;Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize&quot; for &quot;Low Tide&quot;, a once-in-a-lifetime book award established in 1966, judged by a panel of British children&#x27;s writers.

&quot;A Swarm in May&quot; was adapted as a feature film by the Children&#x27;s Film Unit in 1983 and a five-part television series of &quot;Earthfasts&quot; was broadcast by the BBC in 1994.

After 1957, Mayne wrote mostly under his own name, but he also used the names Dynely James, Charles Molin, and Martin Cobalt.

The contemporary children&#x27;s author Aidan Chambers calls Mayne &quot;notoriously little read by children and much read by adults&quot;, essentially an observer and watcher.
&quot;The Guardian&quot; Children&#x27;s Book Editor Julia Eccleshare calls him &quot;one of the most highly regarded writers&quot; and influential although &quot;sometimes thought of as inaccessible for his young readers&quot;. He once said, &quot;All I am doing is looking at things now and showing them to myself when young.&quot;

<text>The Round Table class, also known as the &quot;Sir Lancelot&quot; class, was a British ship class designed for amphibious warfare missions in support of the main amphibious warfare ships. They were designated landing ship logistics (LSL). 

All ships were named after Knights of the Round Table.

==Class history==
In December 1961, the Ministry of Transport ordered the first in a new class of 6,000-ton military supply vessels from Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Govan. The class was designed to replace the World War II-era Mark 8 Landing Craft Tank vessels in service. The first ship, , was launched in June 1963. In March 1963, two more vessels were ordered, with and launched by Alexander Stephen and Sons of Linthouse in April 1966 and January 1967. The final three ships were ordered in April 1965; and were launched by Hawthorn Leslie and Company of Hebburn in July and December 1966, followed by from Swan Hunter of Wallsend in October 1967. At , &quot;Sir Lancelot&quot; was slightly larger than her successors, and was powered by two 12-cylinder Sulzer diesel engines, while the others were and had two 10-cylinder Mirrlees Monarch engines.

The ships had both bow and stern doors leading onto the main vehicle deck, making them roll-on/roll-off, combined with ramps that led to upper and lower vehicle decks. Thanks to their shallow draught, they could beach themselves and use the bow doors for speedy unloading of troops and equipment. The ships also had helicopter decks on both the upper vehicle deck and behind the superstructure.
The ships were operated and managed by the British India Steam Navigation Company for the Royal Army Service Corps until January 1970, then were transferred to the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. One vessel, , was lost during the Falklands War, while another, , was badly damaged. The former was replaced by a new, vessel of the same name, while the latter was rebuilt and returned to service. All of the vessels in this class were replaced by the , with the last to leave service in 2008.

, formerly operated by the Royal Australian Navy, was based on the Round Table design.

<doc id="636621" wikidata="Q7113981" url="?curid=636621" title="Overspill">
<text>In nonstandard analysis, a branch of mathematics, overspill (referred to as &quot;overflow&quot; by Goldblatt (1998, p. 129)) is a widely used proof technique. It is based on the fact that the set of standard natural numbers N is not an internal subset of the internal set *N of hypernatural numbers. 

By applying the induction principle for the standard integers N and the transfer principle we get the principle of internal induction:

For any &quot;internal&quot; subset &quot;A&quot; of *N, if
:# 1 is an element of &quot;A&quot;, and
:# for every element &quot;n&quot; of &quot;A&quot;, &quot;n&quot; + 1 also belongs to &quot;A&quot;,
then
:&quot;A&quot; = *N

If N were an internal set, then instantiating the internal induction principle with N, it would follow N = *N which is known not to be the case.

The overspill principle has a number of useful consequences:
* The set of standard hyperreals is not internal.
* The set of bounded hyperreals is not internal.
* The set of infinitesimal hyperreals is not internal.

In particular:
* If an internal set contains all infinitesimal non-negative hyperreals, it contains a positive &quot;non-infinitesimal&quot; (or &quot;appreciable&quot;) hyperreal.
* If an internal set contains N it contains an unlimited (infinite) element of *N.

==Example==
These facts can be used to prove the equivalence of the following two conditions for an &quot;internal&quot; hyperreal-valued function ƒ defined on *R.

: formula_1
and

: formula_2

The proof that the second fact implies the first uses overspill, since given a non-infinitesimal positive &quot;ε&quot;,

: formula_3

Applying overspill, we obtain a positive appreciable δ with the requisite properties.

These equivalent conditions express the property known in nonstandard analysis as S-continuity (or microcontinuity) of ƒ at &quot;x&quot;. S-continuity is referred to as an external property. The first definition is external because it involves quantification over standard values only. The second definition is external because it involves the external relation of being infinitesimal.

<text>The Western Football League is a football league in South West England, covering Bristol, Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, western Dorset, parts of Gloucestershire and Wiltshire. The league&#x27;s current main sponsor is Jewson, so it is also known as the Jewson Western League for sponsorship reasons.

Recent restructuring of the English football league system has placed the two divisions, known as the Premier Division and Division One (each a maximum of twenty-two clubs) at the ninth and tenth tiers overall, known as Step 5 and Step 6 of the National League System.

The champion club get promoted to a Step 4 league, which in practice will almost certainly be the Southern League Division One South. Below the Western League are four local leagues covering smaller areas, the Gloucestershire County League, the Somerset County League, the Dorset Premier League and the Wiltshire League. The South West Peninsula League Premier Divisions East and West are also feeders to the Western League but due to having Step 6 status (the same level as the Western League Division One), they feed directly into the Western League Premier Division.

==List of 2024–25 member clubs==

===Premier Division===


===Division One===
==History==
The league was formed in 1892 as the Bristol &amp; District League, and became the Western League in 1895. Another Bristol &amp; District League was later formed, which remains active at a much lower level than the Western League. In the years before World War II, many teams played in both the Southern and Western Leagues; the Western League was considered as secondary to the Southern League.

On four occasions, member clubs have lifted the FA Vase, Tiverton Town twice, Taunton Town once and most recently Truro City, who beat A.F.C. Totton in 2007 at the first final to be held at the new Wembley Stadium before a competition record crowd of 27,754. Truro City were the only one of the three to win the FA Vase while in Division One, while none are current members of the Western League, as all three have since progressed to the Southern League.

===Founder members===
* Bedminster (later merged with Bristol South End to form Bristol City) 
* Clevedon (later Clevedon Town) 
* Clifton Association 
* Eastville Rovers (later Bristol Rovers)
* Mangotsfield 
* St. George (later merged with Roman Glass F.C. to form Roman Glass St George) 
* Trowbridge Town 
* Warmley 
* Wells

<doc id="636630" wikidata="Q1346563" url="?curid=636630" title="William Caslon">
<text>William Caslon I (1692/93 – 23 January 1766), also known as William Caslon the Elder, was an English typefounder. The distinction and legibility of his type secured him the patronage of the leading printers of the day in England and on the continent. His typefaces transformed English type design and first established an English national typographic style.

==Life==
Caslon was born in Cradley, Worcestershire in 1692 or 1693 and trained as an engraver in nearby Birmingham. In 1716, he started business in London as an engraver of gun locks and barrels and as a bookbinder&#x27;s tool cutter. Having contact with printers, he was induced to fit up a type foundry, largely through the encouragement of William Bowyer.

He died on 23 January 1766, and was buried in the churchyard of St Luke Old Street, London, where the family tomb is preserved (bearing his name and others).

==Typefaces==

Though his name would come to be identified with an enduring style of Latin alphabet, Caslon&#x27;s first typefaces were what contemporary typefounders called &quot;exotics.&quot; His first design was an Arabic made at the English size (14pt), commissioned by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge before 1725, followed by a Hebrew created for William Bowyer in 1726, and a Coptic for Wilkins first used in 1731. His first Latin typefaces were a roman and italic cut in the pica size (12pt), of a style that was fully realized by the publication of his foundry&#x27;s specimen sheet in 1734.

Caslon&#x27;s typefaces were inspired by the Dutch Baroque types, the most commonly used types in England before Caslon&#x27;s faces.

Caslon typefaces were immediately popular and used for many important printed works, including the first printed version of the United States Declaration of Independence. Caslon&#x27;s types became so popular that the expression about typeface choice, &quot;when in doubt, use Caslon,&quot; came about. The Caslon types fell out of favour in the century after his death, but were revived in the 1840s. Several revivals of the Caslon types are widely used today.

==The Caslon Foundry as a business==

William Caslon I founded the Caslon Foundry in 1739, based on what previously had been Godfrey Head&#x27;s (1685–1700). The other half of that business was purchased by John James, son of Thomas James. John James in the period 1716–1764 also built up by purchase what became the leading English type foundry of the 18th and early 19th centuries. He acquired moiety of half of Robert Mitchell and Jacob Ilive in 1740. A later and important purchase was the foundry of Thomas Grover in 1758. James ultimately combined under his own direction nine old English Foundries. 

John James, William Caslon I and John Baskerville were left by consolidation as the only three representatives of the trade in the country. Caslon had two apprentices in his Foundry, Thomas Cottrell and Joseph Jackson. They started a foundry of their own in direct competition to their employer in 1757. In 1759 Jackson entered the Navy leaving Cottrell to carry on alone. Jackson left the navy in 1763 and continued to be employed in Thomas Cottrell, Neveil&#x27;s court 1759–1785 Foundry for a short time. He commenced business in a separate Foundry with two fellow workman who helped to find the capital 1764 – 1792. When Jackson died in 1792 it was William Caslon I&#x27;s grandson, William Caslon III who purchased the foundry in Salisbury Square.

Following the death of William Caslon I in 1766, his son William Caslon II took over the Caslon Foundry, running it with the assistance of his wife, Elizabeth Cartlich, until his own death in 1778. Elizabeth Caslon then continued to manage it jointly with her two sons, William Caslon III (1754–1833) and Henry Caslon (c.1755–1788) trading as &quot;Elizabeth Caslon and Sons&quot;. Henry died in 1788, and in 1792 William III sold his share of the business to his mother and his sister-in-law, Elizabeth Rowe, Henry&#x27;s widow: the two Elizabeth Caslons continued to run it until the elder Elizabeth&#x27;s death in 1795. As a result of a legal dispute over the terms of her will, the Foundry was then thrown into Chancery and put up for auction in 1799. It was bought by the younger Elizabeth Caslon, who took into partnership a distant relative, Nathaniel Catherwood. Both partners died in 1809. The subsequent proprietors were: Henry Caslon II and F. F. Catherwood, 1809–1821; Henry Caslon II, H. W. Caslon and M. W. Livermore (trading as Caslon, Son and Livermore), 1821–1840; Caslon &amp; Son, 1840–1850; H. W. Caslon and Co., 1850–1873. H. W. Caslon died in 1873, when the Foundry was acquired by T. W. Smith and partners. However, the Company name remained H. W. Caslon and Co. Ltd., and continued running until 1937, when it was acquired by Stephenson Blake.

Meanwhile, following his sale of his share in the original foundry in 1792, William Caslon III had purchased (in the same year) the Salisbury Square foundry from the estate of the recently deceased Joseph Jackson, and renamed it W. Caslon &amp; Son. In 1807, W. Caslon &amp; Son was passed to William Caslon IV. In 1819, William IV sold the business to the new Sheffield foundry of Blake, Garnett &amp; Co. In 1837, the Salisbury Square Caslon Foundry became the property of Stephenson, Blake &amp; Co.

===H. W. Caslon and Company Limited===
In 1998, Justin Howes reestablished the Caslon foundry, under the name &quot;H. W. Caslon &amp; Company Limited&quot;, with an expanded version of ITC Founder&#x27;s Caslon as the company&#x27;s initial product. However, following the death of Justin Howes in 2005, the revived H. W. Caslon &amp; Company was no longer in business, and the expanded Founders Caslon is no longer offered in the retail market.

<text>The four-leaf clover is a rare variation of the common three-leaf clover that has four leaflets instead of three. According to traditional sayings, such clovers bring good luck, a belief that dates back to at least the 17th century. The earliest example of this idea may be from the 1620 play &quot;Astologaster&quot;, by Sir John Melton. The 1640 &quot;Theatrum Botanicum&quot; mentions a &quot;fower-leafed or purple grasse&quot; that was kept in gardens because it was &quot;good for the purples in children or others&quot;.

The term &quot;four-leaf&quot; is botanically a misnomer, as cloverplants have multiple leaves (multiple clovers) consisting of varying numbers of leaflets each, typically three.

==Occurrence==
A 2017 survey of approximately 5.7 million clovers in six European countries found the frequency of 4-leaf clovers to be around 5000 to 1 (one 4-leaf clover for every 5076 normal 3-leaf clovers), almost twice the commonly stated probability of 10,000 to 1. According to this survey, the frequency of a 5-leaf clover is 24,390 to 1, and that of a 6-leaf clover is 312,500 to 1.

According to Guinness World Records, the clover with the most leaflets ever found had 63 of them, and was discovered by Yoshiharu Watanabe of Nasushiobara city, Tochigi prefecture, Japan, on 2 August 2023. The clover was from the species &quot;Trifolium repens&quot; L., or the white clover; beating the previous record, a 56-leaf clover (of the same species) found by Shigeo Obara of Hanamaki city, Iwate prefecture, Japan, on 10 May 2009. Both men obtained clovers with such a number of leafleats through crossbreeding clover plants with a high rate of clovers with an abnormal number of leaflets, causing that, on average, cloverplants generated clovers with a higher and higher number of leaflets in each generation. Shigeo Obara used the method of natural crossbreeding, while Yoshiharu Watanabe used both natural crossbreeding and manual crossbreeding.

In 2019, American Gabriella Gerhardt set the record for collecting the most 4-leaf clovers in one hour (451). In 2018, she also set the record for finding the most 4-leaf clovers in eight hours (887). On January 1, 2023, she certified two more records: the largest collection of 6-leaf clovers (1,437, surpassing the previous record of 43) and the largest collection of 7-leaf clovers (209, surpassing the previous record of 17). In 2023, she broke the record for the largest collection of 4-leaf clovers with 118,791, exceeding the previous record of 111,060 held by American Edward Martin. In total Gabriella Gerhardt holds five Guinness World Records. 

As stated, clovers can have more than four leaflets. 5-leaf clovers are less commonly found naturally than 4-leaf clovers; however, they too have been successfully cultivated. Some 4-leaf clover collectors, particularly in Ireland, regard the 5-leaf clover, known as a rose clover, as a particular prize.

==Cause==

It is debated whether the fourth leaflet is caused genetically or environmentally. Its relative rarity (1 in ~5,000 clovers) suggests a possible recessive gene appearing at a low frequency. Alternatively, four-leaf clovers could be caused by somatic mutation or a developmental error of environmental causes. They could also be caused by the interaction of several genes that happen to segregate in the individual plant. It is possible all four explanations could apply to individual cases. This means that multiple four-leaf clovers could be found in the same cloverplant, and a cloverplant that already has a clover with an abnormal number of leaflets has a higher chance of growing or having another abnormal clover than a cloverplant that doesn&#x27;t have any.

Researchers from the University of Georgia have reported finding the gene that turns ordinary three-leaf clovers into the coveted four-leaf types. Masked by the three-leaf gene and strongly influenced by environmental conditions, molecular markers now make it possible to detect the presence of the gene for four-leaves and for breeders to work with it. The results of the study, which also located two other leaf traits in the white-clover genome, were reported in the July/August 2010 edition of &quot;Crop Science&quot;, published by the Crop Science Society of America.

The other leaf traits, the red fleck mark and red midrib, a herringbone pattern that streaks down the center of each leaflet in a bold red color, were mapped to nearby locations, resolving a century-old question as to whether these leaf traits were controlled by one gene or two separate genes. White clover has many genes that affect leaflet color and shape, and the three in the study were very rare. These traits can be quite attractive, particularly if combined with others, and can turn clover into an ornamental plant for use in flower beds.

According to an experiment made in 2019 by the, at that moment, 17-year old Minori Mori, from Tsukuba, Japan, four-leaf clovers seem to be more likely to appear in well-fertilized soil. Phosphates (a common ingredient in fertilizers) have been proved to play a role in the frequency of development of four-leaf clovers in cloverplants. A plant hormone called auxin, which plays an important role in plant development, has also been shown to increase the probability of mutations in clovers, especially the development of clovers with more than four leaflets. One study reportedly achieved clovers with five to eight leaflets (within a ten day span) using double of the regular dose of phosphate fertilizer and seeds from a cultivar that produces clovers with four leaflets more frequently. Auxin was also given to the plants with their water, with a concentration of 0.7%.

There are reports of farms in the US which specialize in four-leaf clovers, producing as many as 10,000 a day (to be sealed in plastic as &quot;lucky charms&quot;) by introducing a genetically engineered ingredient to the plants to encourage the aberration (there are, however, widely available cultivars that regularly produce leaves with multiple leaflets – see below).

==Multi-leaved cultivars==
There are some cultivars of white clover (&quot;Trifolium repens&quot;) which regularly produce more than three leaflets, including purple-leaved &quot;T. repens&quot; &quot;Purpurascens Quadrifolium&quot; and green-leaved &quot;T. repens&quot; &quot;Quadrifolium&quot;. 

Some clovers have more spade-shaped leaves, rather than the usual rounded ones. This may be a genetic mutation. Some other genetic mutations in clovers include the previosuly mentioned dotted rusty color on the leaves. &quot;Trifolium repens&quot; &quot;Good Luck&quot; is a cultivar which has three, four, or five green, dark-centered leaflets per leaf.

==Other species==
Other plants may be mistaken for, or misleadingly sold as, &quot;4-leaf clovers&quot;; for example, &quot;Oxalis tetraphylla&quot; is a species of wood sorrel with leaves resembling a 4-leaf clover. Other species that have been sold as &quot;4-leaf clovers&quot; include &quot;Marsilea quadrifolia&quot;.

==As a good luck charm==
Sir John Melton&#x27;s 1620 satirical play &quot;Astrologaster&quot; includes the line &quot;That if a man walking in the fields, finde any foure-leaued grasse, he shall in a small while after finde some good thing.&quot; in a list of superstitious beliefs and rituals. This is often thought to be the first reference to four-leaf clovers bringing good luck.

A description from 1869 says that 4-leaf clovers were &quot;gathered at night-time during the full moon by sorceresses, who mixed it with vervain and other ingredients, while young girls in search of a token of perfect happiness made quest of the plant by day.&quot; In an 1877 letter to &quot;St.Nicholas Magazine&quot;, an 11-year-old girl wrote, &quot;Did the fairies ever whisper in your ear, that a 4-leaf clover brought good luck to the finder?&quot;

==Symbolic usage==
* Italian automobile maker Alfa Romeo uses a &quot;quadrifoglio&quot; (4-leaf clover) icon to delineate its racing cars and performance-oriented road models. This tradition started in the 1923 Targa Florio race, when driver Ugo Sivocci decorated his car with a green clover on a white background. As of 2022, the &quot;quadrifoglio&quot; is used on the company&#x27;s race liveries.
* American space exploration company SpaceX includes a 4-leaf clover on each space mission embroidered patch as a good luck charm. Inclusion of the clover has become a regular icon on SpaceX&#x27;s flight patches ever since the company&#x27;s first successful Falcon 1 rocket launch in 2008, which was the first mission to feature a clover &quot;for luck&quot; on its patch.
* Celtic Football Club, an association football team from Glasgow, Scotland, have used the four leaf clover as the club&#x27;s official badge for over 40 years. 
* Former Japanese video game developer studio Clover Studio used a 4-leaf clover as their logo.
* Several businesses and organizations use a 4-leaf clover in their logos to signify Celtic origins.
* The global network of youth organizations 4-H uses a green 4-leaf clover with a white H on each leaf.
* The logo of the New Jersey Lottery features an outline of the state in white on a green 4-leaf clover printed on a lottery draw machine ball.
* The imageboard 4chan features a 4-leaf clover in its logo as a nod to its predecessor, the Japanese site Futaba Channel (2chan), whose name means two leaves, leading 4chan to be referred to in Japan as yotsuba, meaning four leaves.
* Traditional symbol of agrarian parties popularized by Republican Party of Farmers and Peasants, Bulgarian Agrarian National Union, People&#x27;s Party, and International Agrarian Bureau in interwar period. Used until today among others by Polish People&#x27;s Party, Estonian Centre Party, and Nordic agrarian parties.
* In Japan, the Green Cars of Shinkansen use a 4-leaf clover logo.
* Jewelry brand Van Cleef &amp; Arpels the Alhambra lines feature motifs of 4-leaf clover.

==Meanings==
Some folk traditions assign a different attribute to each leaflet of a clover. The leaves have been used by Christians to represent hope, faith, love and luck. Others say that 4-leaf clovers granted the power to see fairies.

<text>Hubert Lagardelle (; 8 July 1874 – 20 September 1958) was a pioneer of French revolutionary syndicalism. He regularly authored reviews for the &quot;Plans&quot; magazine, was co-founder of the journal &quot;Prélude&quot;, and Minister of Labour in the Vichy regime.

== Revolutionary syndicalism ==

Finishing his studies in Law with a thesis on trade unions, Hubert Lagardelle began his career in journalism by founding the Toulouse Marxist journal Socialist Youth (1895). In 1896 he became a member of the French Workers&#x27; Party (Marxist) of Jules Guesde. In 1899 he founded the Le Mouvement socialiste, a theoretical journal of socialism and syndicalism which remains a benchmark in the history of French socialism. Lagardelle took influence from the theories of Proudhon, Marx and Georges Sorel. As a socialist activist, he attended meetings of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and was a contributor to the development of the revolutionary syndicalist movement in the years 1904–1908.

== Fascism and national syndicalism ==

In 1910, disappointed with the evolution of the CGT, Lagardelle retired to Toulouse where he became responsible for the local chamber of commerce. Like many other contemporary French revolutionary unionists, such as Gustave Hervé and Georges Valois, he left the labour movement and developed a tendency towards fascism. In 1926, he joined the Toulouse section of the Faisceau, the first French fascist party. Benito Mussolini attributed the genesis of Fascism in part to Lagardelle, writing in his &quot;Doctrine of Fascism&quot; (1932): &quot;In the great river of fascism, you will find that the veins run back to Sorel, Peguy, to the Lagardelle Socialist Movement and the Italian trade unionists, who from 1904 to 1914, carried a new note in socialist circles with Pagine libere Olivetti, La Lupa of Orano He Divenire Social E. Leone.&quot;

== Vichy government and later life ==

Fascinated by Italian fascism, Lagardelle assisted the Ambassador of France to Rome, Henry de Jouvenel, from 1932 to 1937 in an attempt to establish a Franco-Italian alliance to prevent further German expansionism.

Lagardelle became Minister of Labour for the Vichy government of Pierre Laval (April 1942 – November 1943). In 1943, he was forced to resign from the government and became editor of the Socialist France newspaper. In 1946, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for collaboration but released because of his age in 1949.

He died on 20 September 1958 and was buried at the Saint-Ouen Cemetery.

<text>The diets of Augsburg were the meetings of the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire held in the German city of Augsburg. Both an Imperial City and the residence of the Augsburg prince-bishops, the town had hosted the Estates in many such sessions since the 10th century. In 1282, the diet of Augsburg assigned the control of Austria to the House of Habsburg. In the 16th century, twelve of thirty-five imperial diets were held in Augsburg, a result of the close financial relationship between the Augsburg-based banking families such as the Fugger and the reigning Habsburg emperors, particularly Maximilian I and his grandson Charles V. Nevertheless, the meetings of 1518, 1530, 1547/48 and 1555, during the Reformation and the ensuing religious war between the Catholic emperor and the Protestant Schmalkaldic League, are especially noteworthy. With the Peace of Augsburg, the principle let each prince decide the religion of his subjects and inhabitants who chose not to conform could leave.

==The Diet of 1518==
An Imperial Diet took place at Augsburg from July to October 1518, during the reign of Maximilian I, who died a few months later. He tried, among other things, to appoint his grandson Charles as King of Romans, in order to guarantee his accession to the throne, but he failed. (His only son Philip had died in 1506.)

The Elector Frederick persuaded the pope Leo X to have Luther examined at Augsburg, instead of being called to Rome, where the Imperial Diet was held. Between 12 and 14 October 1518 Luther defended himself under questioning by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan. The pope&#x27;s right to issue indulgences was at the centre of the dispute between the two men. The hearings degenerated into a shouting match. More than writing his theses, Luther&#x27;s confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope: &quot;&#x27;His Holiness abuses Scripture&#x27;, retorted Luther. &#x27;I deny that he is above Scripture&#x27;.&quot; Cajetan&#x27;s original instructions had been to arrest Luther if he failed to recant, but the legate desisted from doing so. With help from the Carmelite friar Christoph Langenmantel, Luther slipped out of the city at night, unbeknownst to Cajetan.

==Proceedings==
Emperor Charles V could not bring himself to openly discuss the matters of religious dispute and cause for division throughout Europe so he often stayed away from the sessions of the Diet. Instead he sent his younger brother Ferdinand I to have authority over discussions. 

The Diet was organized into three separate colleges: Prince-electors, ecclesiastical and secular sovereigns, and imperial cities. However, unlike other diets, the Diet did not possess fixed rules or methods to conduct. Tradition for the Diet of Augsburg began to emerge in the 1530s and the sessions were to be conducted under these guidelines. Either the emperor or the estates organized day-to-day business of the diet and the proposito functioned as the agenda for the Diet but could be easily altered by the convention. 

The business of the Diet was conducted on three levels; the committees, the colleges, and the plenary session. The plenary sessions or colleges created the committees; this level was staffed by members and/or experts of the Diet. The committees would prepare material that would be discussed by colleges and once acted upon, the issue entered the plenary session stage, however this was only ceremonial during the Diet of Augsburg.

The issue would continue to be discussed independently then collectively by the College of Electors and College of Sovereigns. Once they were able to confer on a decision the College of Cities would be informed. If they also agreed to the decision this would become a final decision and passed to the Emperor. If the Emperor approved this recommendation he could adopt it but if there were any issues or concerns he would send it back and the process would start again.

== The Diet of 1530 and the Augsburg Confession ==
The 1530 Imperial Diet of Augsburg was requested by Emperor Charles V to decide on three issues: first, the defense of the Empire against the Ottoman threat; second, issues related to policy, currency and public well being; and, third, disagreements about Christianity, in attempt to reach some compromise and a chance to deal with the German situation. The Diet was inaugurated by the emperor on 20 June. It produced numerous outcomes, most notably the 1530 declaration of the Lutheran estates known as the Augsburg Confession (&quot;Confessio Augustana&quot;), a central document of Lutheranism that was presented to the emperor.

=== Background ===
The Ninety-five Theses, published by Martin Luther in 1517, had sparked the Reformation in the German lands and an increasing number of princes turned Protestant. After the Great Peasants&#x27; Revolt was suppressed, the 1530 Diet was convoked to calm rising tensions over Protestantism, especially due to fears of the Ottoman advance; the forces of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent had almost taken the Habsburg residence Vienna in 1529 and Emperor Charles V wanted Christianity to unite against the invasions. After the 1521 Diet of Worms had imposed an Imperial ban on Martin Luther and his tracts, problems of enforcement emerged, as Charles&#x27; wars against France and commitments in the rest of his empire prevented him from focusing on German religious problems. 

On August 3rd, 1529, the emperor having witnessed the protest at Speyer signed a successful peace treaty with France. After these successes, Charles aimed to assert his control over what he saw as German religious heresies. At the Diet of Speyer, the Edict of Worms was affirmed, resulting in the Protestation at Speyer enacted by the Lutheran princes. 

=== Creation ===
The Augsburg Confession was intended &quot;to be an expression of the faith of the universal Church, and thus a basis for a reconciliation between the Lutheran Reformers and the Roman Church&quot;. It had been prepared by Philipp Melanchthon and Johannes Brenz at the behest of John, Elector of Saxony. Based on Melanchthon&#x27;s earlier Articles of Schwabach, it contained twenty-one succinct articles of faith to show that the doctrines preached did not violate the norms that were traditionally present as well as justifications for the changes in worship and life that occurred from abusive traditions. 

The Confession was presented to the emperor on 25 June. During the Diet, Melanchthon withstood a variety of attacks while formulating the text. According to Joachim Camerarius, his first biographer, he &quot;did not bend the truth to win favor or meet objections; at the same time he avoided unnecessary conflict&quot;. Camerarius also mentions that during the diet, Melanchthon cried when hearing his work during this intense time of negotiations. Melanchthon hastily rewrote the materials that he brought with him to Augsburg upon learning of the 404 articles which condemned the writings of the reformers as heretical.

There has been a long dispute regarding the Augsburg Confession and what type of confession it truly is. One suggestion is that it is a political and theological confession, which established the Protestant church. A second view is that it is a catholic confession that dispensed with minor teachings such as penance. During the 16th century the tensions and relationship that existed between the Emperor, the Pope, the German Princes and the Protestants were quite complex. The confessions of the early centuries of the church were evoked by the Protestant Reformation and of the tensions that existed in the Church. The confession represented Protestant beliefs during the time of intense political and religious pressures. The Confession did discuss the basis and role of the papal authority in the Church &quot;but it was decided not to incorporate a statement of the Lutheran position on the papacy in the confession in order to avoid upsetting Charles V and running the risk that he might simply refuse to negotiate with the Lutheran part at the Diet&quot;.

=== Martin Luther&#x27;s contribution ===
At the time of the Diet of Augsburg, Martin Luther was an outlaw of the Empire and as a result was unable to be present at the Diet. Staying at the Veste Coburg, he made himself present through a variety of publications including the composition of &quot;Admonition to All the Clergy Assembled at Augsburg&quot;. Five hundred copies were quickly sold and circulated around during the Diet. A member of the Saxon group, Justus Jonas, wrote that Luther&#x27;s work seemed inspired while &quot;rebuking the haughtiness of the higher clergy, forcefully asserting &#x27;the article on necessity&#x27;, and reducing the opponents to silence&quot;. 

Further, Luther&#x27;s impact was evident in August 1530 with the increased resistance of the Protestants to demands for concessions in the later stages of negotiations. Luther was able to read Melanchthon&#x27;s confession at an early stage, and admitted that he could have never written it in such a finely-argued way. He did later note that there &quot;was no article on purgatory and no unmasking of the papal Antichrist&quot;. Additionally, after reading Melanchthon&#x27;s work he stated &quot;I have read Master Philip&#x27;s Apologia and it pleases me very much. During mid-July 1530 Luther was reported as having told a number of friends that he had no expectation that the Diet would lead to any sort of agreement between the two sides. 

The General Synod of the Lutheran church accepted the twenty-one doctrinal articles with the Abuses altered.

== Augsburg Interim ==
Following the Diet of Augsburg in 1530 was the Nuremberg Religious Peace which gave the Reformation more time to spread. At the end of this was the Schmalkaldic War and the ensuing Augsburg Interim in 1548 which was the Imperial decree given by Charles V after his army won against the Schmalkaldic League during the Schmalkaldic War of 1547/48. The tensions between Charles V and the German Lutheran princes were finally resolved with the Peace of Augsburg in 1555, which formally acknowledged Protestantism as a legitimate religion of the Empire.

After his victory over the Schmalkaldic League, Charles V convened the Diet of 1547/48 (&quot;geharnischter Reichstag&quot; - &#x27;harnessed diet&#x27;, due to its tense atmosphere, very close to outright hostility), where the Augsburg Interim was proclaimed. This attempt to give Catholicism the priority was rejected by many princes, though, and a resolution of the confessional tensions was only achieved at the session in 1555, where the Peace of Augsburg was concluded. The treaty acknowledged the Augsburg Confession and codified the &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot; principle, which gave each prince the power to decide the religion of his subjects.

The decrees of the Council of Trent were acknowledged by the Catholic princes of Germany at the Diet of Augsburg held in 1566.

==History==
The electoral district was originally created in 1924 from the ridings of Winnipeg South and Winnipeg Centre. Its first iteration was generally located west of the Red River and north of the Assiniboine River. In 1952, it gained parts the Rural Municipality (and later city) of St. James. In 1966, it gained parts the municipalities of Assiniboia, and Charleswood, and the Town of Tuxedo. By this time, the riding had moved further west and crossed the Assiniboine.

In 1976, it was abolished with its territory transferred to the ridings of Winnipeg—Assiniboine and Winnipeg—St. James.

The electoral district was re-created in 1987 from parts of the redrawn ridings of St. Boniface and Winnipeg North Centre, and the abolished Winnipeg—Assiniboine and Winnipeg—Fort Garry. The new riding was almost entirely south of the Assiniboine River, except for Downtown Winnipeg, and had very little territory in common with the original Winnipeg South Centre. The riding contained all of Downtown Winnipeg south of Portage Avenue, plus the neighbourhoods of Alpine Place, Crescentwood, Earl Grey, Winnipeg, Ebby-Wentworth, Elm Park, Glenwood, Grant Park, J. B. Mitchell, Kingston Crescent, Lord Roberts, Mathers, McMillan, the northern half of Norberry, River-Osborne, River Heights, Riverview, Rockwood, Roslyn, St. George, Varennes, Wellington Crescent, and Tuxedo east of Edgeland Blvd.

The district&#x27;s boundaries were redistributed in 1996. It lost all of its territory east of the Red River to St. Boniface; it lost all of Downtown Winnipeg north of York Avenue and east of Main Street to Winnipeg Centre. It gained Armstrong&#x27;s Point and West Broadway south of Portage Avenue from Winnipeg North Centre; and it gained the remainder of Tuxedo plus the neighbourhoods of Assiniboine Park, Edgeland, Old Tuxedo, Sir John Franklin, and Vialoux from Winnipeg South.

The 2003 redistribution moved the riding entirely south of the Assiniboine for the first time, losing its territory north of the Assiniboine to Winnipeg Centre. The riding also lost Assiniboine Park and Vialoux to Charleswood—St. James. It gained the neighbourhoods of Beaumont, Buffalo, Chevrier, Crescent Park, Maybank, the western half of Pembina Strip, Point Road, and Wildwood from Winnipeg South.

This riding gained the neighbourhoods of Brockville, Linden Woods, Tuxedo Industrial and the remainder of the Pembina Strip from Winnipeg South during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

Following the report from the 2022 electoral redistribution, the riding is set to lose the Tuxedo area to the new riding of Winnipeg West, while adding Whyte Ridge, Linden Ridge and West Fort Garry Industrial from Winnipeg South.

<text>Emily Anne Hart (born May 2, 1986) is an American former actress. She is the younger sister of actress Melissa Joan Hart and is best known for her roles as Sabrina Spellman in &quot;&quot; and Amanda Wiccan in &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;.

== Biography ==
Hart is a daughter of television producer Paula Hart (née Voje) and William Hart, a businessman. She has six sisters (three of whom are half-sisters) and one brother. Her stepfather (since 1994) is television executive Leslie Gilliams, who competed on Season 5 of the American version of &quot;MasterChef&quot; in 2014, finishing in 3rd place. Her older siblings Melissa, Trisha, Elizabeth, and Brian Hart have all been in show business to varying degrees, as have younger half-sisters Alexandra Gilliams, Samantha Gilliams, and Mackenzie Hart.

Hart started acting influenced by her older sister Melissa. In 1994, she played 4-year-old Tommy in the Broadway production of &quot;The Who&#x27;s Tommy&quot;. In 1998, she won a Young Artist Award for her role in the television movie &quot;The Right Connections&quot;. She was also nominated that year for a guest appearance on the series &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;, in which her sister Melissa Joan Hart starred. A later episode of that series, entitled &quot;Witchright Hall&quot;, served as a backdoor pilot for a possible spin-off series starring Hart as Sabrina&#x27;s younger cousin Amanda, but the show was not picked up by The WB.

In 1999, Hart was cast in the title role of &quot;&quot; while her older sister Melissa co-starred as Hilda and Zelda Spellman, for which she was nominated for the Young Artist Awards in 2000 and 2001, winning the second of the two. Also in 2001, Hart starred as the teenaged Shirley Temple in the TV movie &quot;Child Star: The Story of Shirley Temple&quot;. In 2003, she won another Young Artist Award for a guest appearance on the series &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;.

In 2005, Hart starred in the short film &quot;Mute&quot;, which was directed by her older sister Melissa. In 2009 she played York in the horror thriller film &quot;Nine Dead&quot;, which also featured her older sister Melissa. She was the narrator for the 2016 audio book &quot;Things I Can&#x27;t Explain: A Clarissa Novel&quot;.

== Personal life ==

In September 2013, Hart married Alex Madar. They have two sons.

<doc id="636651" wikidata="Q259270" url="?curid=636651" title="Henri Padé">
<text>Henri Eugène Padé (; 17 December 1863 – 9 July 1953) was a French mathematician, who is now remembered mainly for his development of Padé approximation techniques for functions using rational functions.

==Education and career==
Padé studied at École Normale Supérieure in Paris. He then spent a year at Leipzig University and the University of Göttingen, where he studied under Felix Klein and Hermann Schwarz.

In 1890 Padé returned to France, where he taught in Lille while preparing his doctorate under Charles Hermite. His doctoral thesis described what is now known as the Padé approximant. He then became an assistant professor at Université Lille Nord de France, where he succeeded Émile Borel as a professor of rational mechanics at École Centrale de Lille.

Padé taught at Lille until 1902, when he moved to Université de Poitiers. He became recteur of Académie de Besançon and Dijon in 1923. He later became Recteur of Académie de Aix-Marseilles until he retired in 1934.

<text>John Mark Ainsley (born 9 July 1963) is an English lyric tenor. Known for his supple voice, Ainsley is particularly admired for his interpretations of baroque music and the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. In the course of his career, he has gravitated towards 20th-century music, singing in operas by Henze, Janáček, and Britten.

==Early life and education==

After further engagements with Gothic Voices and other groups he made his professional opera debut in 1988 as Armindo in Scarlatti&#x27;s &quot;Gli equivoci nel sembiante&quot; at Innsbruck&#x27;s Early Music Festival. This was followed by his debut with English National Opera the following year as Eurimaco in &quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria&quot;, and his United States debut in 1990 in a series of concerts in Boston and New York. He has subsequently performed all around the world in operas and concerts.

Other roles have included Lensky in &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, Lysander in Britten&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, David in Carl Nielsen&#x27;s &quot;Saul og David&quot;, and Jupiter in &quot;Semele&quot;, the latter of which he performed to acclaim at the English National Opera in 1999. At the 2003 Salzburg Festival, he created the role of &#x27;Der Daemon&#x27; in the world premiere of Hans Werner Henze&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Upupa und der Triumph der Sohnesliebe&quot;, which he later reprised at the Teatro Real in Madrid.

More recently, Ainsley has sung the roles of Soliman in &quot;Zaide&quot; and Belfiore in &quot;La finta giardiniera&quot; at the Salzburg Festival (2006), The Madwoman in Britten&#x27;s &quot;Curlew River&quot; with Oper Frankfurt (2006), Pelléas in &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; with the Deutsche Oper Berlin (2006), Skuratov in Janáček&#x27;s &quot;From the House of the Dead&quot; with both the Amsterdam and Vienna Festivals (2007), Hippolyt in the world premiere of Henze&#x27;s &quot;Phaedra&quot; with the Berlin State Opera (2007) and La Monnaie (2007), Vere in &quot;Billy Budd&quot; with Oper Frankfurt (2007), Chevalier de la Force in &quot;Dialogues des Carmelites&quot; with the Hamburg State Opera (2008), and both Bajazete in &quot;Tamerlano&quot; and the title role in &quot;Idomeneo&quot; with the Bavarian State Opera (2008). Ainsley sung the role of Emilio in &quot;Partenope&quot; with the English National Opera in the autumn of 2008 and returned for performances at the Bavarian State Opera and Berlin State Opera in 2009.

<text>Yorkton—Melville is a federal electoral district in Saskatchewan, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1968.

==Geography==

The district is in east-central Saskatchewan.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 1966 from Yorkton, Melville and Mackenzie ridings.

In 2006, 30.2% of the population of the Yorkton—Melville constituency were of Ukrainian ethnic origin, the highest such percentage in Canada. Also during the 2006 election, the Yorkton—Melville riding had the highest percentage of eligible voters over the age of 65, and highest average age of all the then-308 federal electoral districts.

This riding lost a fraction of territory to Regina—Qu&#x27;Appelle and gained territory from Saskatoon—Humboldt and a fraction from Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

<doc id="636666" wikidata="Q3303084" url="?curid=636666" title="Kiriath-Jearim">
<text>Kiriath-Jearim (also Kiryat Ye&#x27;arim; [[Kiriath-Jearim|&#x27;, &quot;city of woods&quot;; ; &#x27;) was a city in the [[Land of Israel]]. It is mentioned 18 times in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The biblical place was identified with [[Abu Ghosh]].

==Etymology==
Other names are Kiriath-Ba&#x27;al, Ba&#x27;alah and Ba&#x27;ale-Judah (see, e.g. Joshua 15:60; [[2 Samuel 6:2]]; 1 Chronicles 13:6), which implies the city was affiliated with Baal worship at an earlier date.

==History==

In [[Eusebius]]&#x27; &quot;[[Onomasticon (Eusebius)|Onomasticon]]&quot;, Kiryat Ye&#x27;arim is placed about 9 [[Roman miles]], or about , from [[Jerusalem]]. [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] explorers [[C. R. Conder|Claude Reignier Conder]] and Henderson have identified it with the site now known as &quot;Khirbet &#x27;Erma&quot;, a ruin located south of [[Kasla, Jerusalem|Kasla]] and east of . However, starting with [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]], biblical Kiriath-Jearim has been more often identified with Deir el-Azar (&quot;Tel Qiryat Yearim&quot;), a place near [[Abu Ghosh]] on a hill where the Deir El-Azar Monastery currently stands, about west of Jerusalem. This site was the only major biblical site in ancient Judah that had not been excavated, until an excavation began in 2017 by a team from [[Tel Aviv University]] and the .

Kiriath-Jearim was described as a [[Hivites|Hivite]] city linked to the [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeonites]] (see [[Joshua 9:17]]). It was a key landmark in identifying the border between the tribes of [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] and [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]] (see [[Joshua 15#Judah&#x27;s boundaries (15:1–12)|Joshua 15:9]] &amp; [[Joshua 18#Allotment for Benjamin (18:11–28)|18:14]], 15). It is mentioned as the place the [[Ark of the Covenant]] may have been moved after being in ([[1 Samuel 6#Verse 21|1 Samuel 6:21]]–[[1 Samuel 7#Verse 2|7:2]]). More than twenty years afterward, the ark was moved to Jerusalem and placed in a tent outside the palace of [[David]].

Kiriath-Jearim&#x27;s change in designation from Kiriath-Ba&#x27;al (meaning City of Baal, or City of the Lord) may indicate the population change that took place after [[Joshua]]&#x27;s military campaign to take possession of the land from its previous inhabitants. According to [[Israel Finkelstein]] and Thomas Romer, the possibility that Kiriath-ba‘al/Ba‘alah was the original name of the town, or more correctly its Northern name, hints that the god [[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]] was worshipped as [[Baal]], before that title became a negative link with &quot;foreign&quot; (Phoenician or other) storm gods.

The [[Hebrew Bible]] identifies at least one prophet of God who came from this town. [[Uriah (prophet)|Uriah]], the son of Shemaiah, was from Kiriath-Jearim, and was a contemporary of [[Jeremiah]] who prophesied against Jerusalem (see [[Jeremiah 26]]:20). This aroused the wrath of [[Jehoiakim|King Jehoiakim]] (r. 609–598 BC) who sought to put Uriah to death. Uriah escaped to Egypt, where he was apprehended by the king&#x27;s henchman and extradited to Jerusalem for execution and burial in an unmarked grave (Jeremiah 26:22–23).

The writer of the [[Books of Chronicles]] teaches that [[Shobal]] (possibly a descendant of [[Caleb]]) was &quot;the father of Kiriath-Jearim&quot; (see 1 Chronicles 2:50–53), possibly in the sense of being the founder of this town.

Descendants of Kiriath-Jearim were among the Jewish exiles who returned to Judea with [[Zerubbabel]] (see [[Nehemiah 7#The census (7:4–73)|Nehemiah 7:29]]).
