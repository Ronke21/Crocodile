<text>The Chinese New Left is a term used in the People&#x27;s Republic of China to describe a diverse range of left-wing political philosophies that emerged in the 1990s that are critical of the economic reforms instituted under Deng Xiaoping, which emphasized policies of market liberalization and privatization to promote economic growth and modernization.

Chinese intellectual Wang Hui links the emergence of New Leftism with the financial crisis of 1997 and the 1999 United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, which damaged the credibility of liberalism in China, as well as the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. Some of the Chinese New Left intellectuals enjoyed prominence, especially with the rise of Chongqing Communist Party secretary Bo Xilai, who promoted a set of socio-economic policies collectively termed the &quot;Chongqing model&quot;, though they suffered a blow after the end of Bo&#x27;s career in 2012 due to the Wang Lijun incident.

There is an ambiguity of the term &quot;New Left&quot; in discourse drawing from the diversity of the movement. Generally speaking, the New Left can be applied to a person who embraces leftist theories, ideals, and traditions rooted in variations of socialist ideology, and other schools criticizing postmodernism and neoliberalism.

The New Left&#x27;s relationship with Maoism and capitalism is complicated. Although some schools of thought suggest that the New Left wants the return to mass political movements of the Mao Zedong era and an abandonment of capitalism, others believe that it combines capitalism&#x27;s open markets with socialist elements (particularly in rural China). Additionally, the views within the New Left are diverse, ranging from hardline Maoists to more moderate social democrats.

==Terminology==

The term was first used by Chinese journalist Yang Ping, who published a review in the 21 July 1994, issue of &quot;Beijing Youth Daily&quot; about intellectual Cui Zhiyuan&#x27;s article &quot;New Evolution, Analytical Marxism, Critical Law, and China&#x27;s Reality&quot;, remarking that China had produced its own &quot;New Left wing&quot;.

Although many New Left intellectuals oppose certain Maoist approaches, the term &quot;New Left&quot; implies some agreement with Maoism. Since it is associated with the ultra-leftism of the Cultural Revolution, many scholars and intellectuals supporting socialist approaches and reforms, but opposing the radical and brutal approaches of the Maoist period, do not completely accept the &quot;New Left&quot; label. Some are concerned about the fact that adopting leftism implies that China, historically different from the West, is still using a Western model to strategise its reforms and would be limited by how the West defines the Left. Intellectual Wang Hui explains the origin of, and his skepticism about, the term:

However, liberal intellectual Xu Youyu points out that Wang Hui&#x27;s performance in his interview with the &quot;New Left Review&quot; suggests that he fully understood that the term was inevitably generated by social change and intellectual antagonism in China. The term &quot;New Left&quot; remains fraught with confusion due to the lack of clarity in its definition. Some intellectuals labeled as New Leftists, including but not limited to Gan Yang, are associated with Western conservatives, including Leo Strauss, rather than the New Left movement of the 1960s.

==Origin==

The concept of the New Left arose in China during the 1990s. According to New Left theory, market-economy challenges stem from the fact that under Chinese economic reform, the market economy has become the dominant economic system; China&#x27;s socialist economic reforms have brought the country into the global capitalist sphere.

The development of the New Left is correlated to increased Chinese nationalism after its period of low-profile presence on the world stage during the Deng Xiaoping era. It is seen as a response to problems faced by China during its modernization drive since the 1980s, which has led to growing social inequality between the coast and hinterlands, and rich and poor. Some scholars believe that, based on its unique and drastic 20th-century economic and political changes, China cannot adopt the social-democratic, capitalist model of many Western countries.

The Chinese New Left is concerned with the country&#x27;s social-inequality issues. Some scholars believe that although the movement is not yet mature, it is likely to embed itself in Chinese society over the next century (assuming that polarization continues). Strikes, sit-ins, slow-downs, and peasant uprisings, sporadic due to government suppression, are on the rise and may become more organized with the development of the New Left.

Although they are skeptical and critical of capitalism, New Leftists recognize its influence on China and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of capitalist models. Cui Zhiyuan, a leading New Left intellectual, believes that it is imperative that socialism and capitalism are not viewed as opposites. According to Zhang Xudong, &quot;An advocate for New Deal-style economic and social policies in China was considered to be liberal in the 1980s, but as &#x27;New Left&#x27; by the century&#x27;s end.&quot; This overlap suggests that ideals set forth by the New Left strongly resemble the democratic socialism of the 1980s.

==Intellectual views==

Economics plays a significant role in the Chinese New Left, whose development is closely associated with Chinese economic reform. Many supporters of the New Left generally believe that a leftist economic model should be found to tackle China&#x27;s dependence on exports and savings, reduce the growing economic gap between rural and urban areas, and stimulate private business through public ownership and state planning. The capitalist free-market model applied in most social-democratic programs is undesirable because, instead of challenging and reforming the existing market economy and representative democracy, it seeks to moderate the social consequences of structural division and hierarchy. A suitable, sustainable market model is vital for China&#x27;s leftist movement. At the same time, the New Left criticized market reforms by citing the damage they caused to the countryside as an argument.

New Left economist Cui Zhiyuan believes that a labour-capital partnership, based on the ideas of James Meade and John Maynard Keynes, can be used to introduce some flexibility to the labour market. Outside shareholders own capital-share certificates; workers own labour and share certificates, which replace a fixed wage and reduce the conflict of interest between workers and capitalists. Any decision that will improve one group (by raising the dividend on its share) will automatically raise the dividend on the shares of the other group. Many New Left intellectuals are confident in the outcome of collective economic-development planning, anticipating rural industrialization.

In 2010, when asked about the difference between the New Left in China and the New Left in the West, Professor Ding Xueliang of the Social Sciences Department of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology replied that, &quot;there is no New Left in China at all, because the primary claim of the New Left is that human rights are greater than sovereignty&quot;, &quot;The New Left in the West, they oppose the governments of their own countries on the one hand and the monopolies of their own countries on the other. Although their practical path may not be realistic, they at least have courage. The &#x27;New Left&#x27; in China mostly appeals to the government, so how can this be called the New Left?&quot;

==Social movements==
According to the Financial Times in 2016, several experts estimate that if there were free elections in China, a neo-Maoist candidate would win. This Maoist revival movement precedes the tenure of Xi Jinping, whose own revival of Mao-era elements seem to be intended as a conciliatory move towards the neo-Maoists. It is believed that the rising popularity of neo-Maoism is due to the growing economic dislocation and inequality under market reforms and globalisation.

Critiques of Jiang Zemin&#x27;s 2001 decision to allow private business people to become party members, referring to the decision as &quot;political misconduct&quot; and &quot;ideological confusions&quot;, helped fuel the rise of what would become known as the New Left movement.

Neo-Maoists first became prominent under Hu Jintao&#x27;s administration, delivering far-left attacks on CCP policy from websites such as &quot;Utopia&quot;, or &quot;MaoFlag&quot;. They expanded into a political movement through association with the Chongqing Party Secretary Bo Xilai, and succeeded in surviving crackdowns. It is believed that the CCP leadership is reluctant to eradicate these groups due to their connection with CCP history and ideology.

Maoism and neo-Maoism have been increasingly popular after the rise of Xi Jinping among millennials and poor Chinese people, and they are more frequently covered by foreign media.

=== Nanjie Village and land reform ===

National Public Radio&#x27;s website posted a story about Nanjie on 13 May 2011, calling it a prime example of recent &quot;re-collectivizations&quot; inspired by Mao&#x27;s ideas: &quot;The furniture and appliances in each home are identical, including the big red clocks with Chairman Mao&#x27;s head, radiating psychedelic colours to the tune &quot;The East Is Red.&quot; [Villager] Huang Zunxian owns virtually nothing in his apartment. The possessions are owned by the collective, right down to the couch cushionsÂ ... &quot; Some villages around the country have followed Nanjie&#x27;s example and re-collectivized.&quot;

During the 1990s, rural industry began to stagnate and China&#x27;s large peasant population was seen as a hindrance to the country&#x27;s development. Popular demand for further modernization, urbanization, and marketization began to outweigh the successes of the previous Township and Village Enterprises. Cui Zhiyuan and Gan Yang began to establish small, rural industries and collectives to mitigate the increasing socioeconomic gap and provide an alternative to large-scale capitalism.

Although Hegang has had the largest number of laid-off workers since 1996, the city has registered China&#x27;s highest rate of economic growth. Cui Zhiyuan suggests that the cause of this phenomenon is its &quot;combining public land ownership and the market&quot;. Hegang has focused on stimulating its real estate market to stimulate the development of related industries.

Of the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s current ideology, the idea of privatising China&#x27;s countryside has not been accepted and it remains in public hands. Although most non-urban land is used privately, it cannot be sold (unlike urban property).

In 2008, the Third Session of the 17th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party () began a new round of land-privatization reforms, but these measures were limited; the transfer of land remains ambiguous, not &quot;officially endorsed and encouraged&quot;.

=== Zhengzhou incident ===
On 24 December 2004, four Chinese protesters were sentenced to three-year prison terms for distributing leaflets entitled &quot;Mao Forever Our Leader&quot; at a gathering in Zhengzhou honouring Mao Zedong on the anniversary of his birth. Attacking the current leadership as &quot;imperialist revisionists,&quot; the leaflets called on lower-level cadres to &quot;change the current line (of the party) and return to the socialist road&quot;. The Zhengzhou incident is one of the first manifestations of public nostalgia for the Mao era reported by the international press, although it is unclear whether these feelings are widespread. It is an example of Marxist Chinese New Leftism in action.

Chinese New Leftists are often criticised by liberal intellectuals such as Liu Junning, who consider China as not liberal enough economically and politically. These liberals think that inequality and the widening gap between rich and poor are serious problems which exist in every developing country. Democracy and personal freedom are seen as important for China, although perhaps not attainable in the near future.

=== Maoist Communist Party of China ===
A group of workers and students formed the Maoist Communist Party of China in 2008, an underground, non-recognized political party opposing the ruling Communist Party government. A reported party manifesto, &quot;The Ten Declarations of the Maoist Communist Party of China&quot;, was posted on the Internet, in which the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party was questioned. The party advocates a reversal of the Deng Xiaoping reforms and a return to socialism.

=== Chongqing model ===
Politician Bo Xilai was promoted in October 2007 to party chief of Chongqing, a troubled province with high levels of pollution and unemployment and poor public health. Bo began a policy of expanding state-owned industries, in contrast with the rest of China, which was embracing market reforms. He led an economic reform of the region which was known as the Chongqing model and focused on expanding state influence in the economy, anti-corruption campaigns, and the promotion of &quot;Red Culture&quot;. The policy also supported strong public welfare programs for the poor, unemployed, and elderly.

Bo began the Red Culture Movement in 2008, which promoted Maoist culture in opposition to the capitalist culture that characterized the Chinese reformists. Radio and television played Maoist propaganda and students were organized to &quot;return to the countryside&quot; and promote the singing of &quot;red songs&quot; during this period.

From 2009 to 2011, Chongqing began prosecuting alleged Triad members in the Chongqing gang trials. An estimated 4,781 people were arrested during the crackdown. The prosecution was controversial in its use of torture, forced confessions, and inhumane treatment of witnesses.

In 2013, Bo was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to life imprisonment. He is incarcerated at Qincheng Prison. Bo was removed as Chongqing&#x27;s party chief and lost his seat on the Politburo. Bo&#x27;s supporters formed the Zhi Xian Party to protest his conviction, but it was swiftly banned.

=== Xi era ===

The Xi administration, while imposing political controls on businesses, has also promoted greater economic liberalisation in Shenzhen, which was then held up as a model for the rest of China. In September 2020, the former mayor and party chief of Shenzhen, Li Youwei, published a sharply-worded commentary in &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot;, warning that due to the resurgence of leftists discussing class struggle, China was at a crossroads for economic reform. In 2021, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Maoism is being revived among China&#x27;s generation Z due to China&#x27;s growing wealth gap and the 996 working hour system, as they call for a crackdown on capitalists and posting &quot;Ã la lanterne!&quot; on social media.

==== 2015 Luoyang meeting ====

In February 2015, a group from 13 provinces and municipalities in China, calling themselves &quot;Chinese Maoists Communists&quot;, held a two-day secret meeting in Luoyang, calling for a &quot;new socialist revolution&quot; to &quot;reverse the restoration of capitalism&quot;. The group seemed to claim to have party elders as backers. The group was quietly arrested. Luoyang was an industrial area that declined after the Chinese economic reforms of the 1990s and experienced extensive unemployment as a result. Maoist nostalgia is pervasive in the city. The neo-Maoists received online support across many blogs, &quot;Weibo&quot;, and websites such as RedChina.net. However some neo-Maoist groups refused to back it, typically those who regarded Xi Jinping&#x27;s policies as sufficiently aligned to their neo-Maoist agenda.

====2017 Guangzhou incident====
In November 2017, a group of Maoist students and workers was arrested in Guangzhou for organizing a Maoist salon.

====2018 Cultural Revolution anniversary celebrations====
On the 52nd anniversary of the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, dozens of neo-Maoists from all over China gathered in Hong Kong for commemorations, saying that their activities had been banned in the mainland. They wore Mao-era blue military uniforms and waved hammer-and-sickle flags. These Maoist groups are highly critical of the CCP&#x27;s market economics, which they claim are responsible for rising inequality and corruption.

====Jasic protests====
A number of Maoist students participated in the JulyâAugust 2018 Jasic incident, protesting in support of factory workers and workers&#x27; rights. The students formed the Jasic Workers Solidarity Group, which included #Me Too advocate Yue Xin. The rally was largely organized through the popular far-left neo-Maoist online forum website Utopia. Fifty student advocates were later arrested; their whereabouts are unknown. Political suppression has been expanded to universities, factories, and the general public. Student leaders of the Jasic protests have been detained, punished and subjected to forced education by the CCP.

==== Common prosperity ====
After Xi&#x27;s emphasis on a more equal society and promotion of the term &quot;common prosperity&quot;, Li Guangman, a retired newspaper editor affiliated with the Chinese New Left, published an article that claims a &quot;profound revolution&quot; was close that would take the party closer to masculinity and its socialist roots. Major Chinese state news agencies published the article, including &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; and Xinhua News Agency, setting off widespread worries about parallels to the Cultural Revolution. In response, the news agencies tried to downplay the incident by not carrying the article in their print versions, some of them removing the article from their sites and, in the case of &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, publishing a front-page editorial in support of market forces.

<text>Kittanning (Lenape Kithanink; ) was an 18th-century Native American village in the Ohio Country, located on the Allegheny River at present-day Kittanning, Pennsylvania. The village was at the western terminus of the Kittanning Path, an Indian trail that provided a route across the Alleghenies between the Ohio and Susquehanna river basins.

Together with Logstown, Pickawillany, Sandusky, and Lower Shawneetown, Kittanning was one of several large multiethnic and autonomous &quot;Indian republics&quot; made up of a variety of smaller disparate social groups: village fragments, extended families, or individuals, often survivors of epidemics and refugees from conflicts with other Native Americans or with Europeans.

Kittanning served as a staging area for Delaware and Shawnee raids on British colonial settlements during the French and Indian War, until Pennsylvania provincial troops under the command of Colonel John Armstrong destroyed the village on 8 September 1756.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Kithanink&quot; means &#x27;on the main river&#x27; in the Lenape language, from &quot;kit-&quot; &#x27;big&#x27; + &quot;hane&quot; &#x27;mountain river&#x27; + -&quot;ink&quot; (suffix used in place names). &quot;The main river&quot; is a Lenape epithet for the Allegheny and Ohio, considered as all one river. The Six Nations tribes referred to the town as Adego, or Atiga, from which the French derived the names they used for the town, &quot;AttiguÃ©&quot; or &quot;AttiquÃ©&quot;.

==History==
===Establishment, 1724===
The village was initially settled in 1724 by Delaware (Lenape) of the Turtle (&quot;PÃ¹kuwÃ nku&quot;) and Turkey (&quot;PÃ«le&quot;) clans who were relocating westward due to pressure from expanding European settlements near Shamokin. It eventually became one of the largest Native American villages on the western side of the Alleghenies, having an estimated 300â400 residents in 1756. In a conference between Pennsylvania provincial authorities and the chiefs of the Six Nations at Albany on 3 July 1754, Conrad Weiser, an interpreter from Pennsylvania, told the colonials: &quot;The road to Ohio is no new road; it is an old and frequented road; the Shawnese and Delawares removed thither above thirty years ago from Pennsylvania.&quot;

By 1727, Pennsylvania traders including Edmund Cartlidge, Jonah Davenport, and James Le Tort, along with others, were trading at the Allegheny, with headquarters on the &quot;Kythenning River&quot;. Anthony Sadowski established a trading post at Kittanning in June, 1729. In October 1731, Jonah Davenport and James Le Tort, in separate affidavits made before Lieutenant Governor Patrick Gordon, reported that &quot;last spring there were at Kythenning on the Kythenning River, fifty families and one hundred and fifty men, most Delaware.&quot; The population grew as groups of Lenape, Cayugas, Senecas, and Shawnees migrated west into the Ohio River Valley seeking to escape a smallpox epidemic in 1733 and a drought in 1741, creating a multi-ethnic community. The Shawnee established several smaller communities nearby, including Neucheconeh&#x27;s Town, later known as Chartier&#x27;s Town after the Shawnee leader Peter Chartier. Kittanning, with two or three smaller villages, and several on the Kiskiminetas River, constituted a center of Lenape and Shawnee population known as &quot;Allegeney&quot; or &quot;Allegania&quot;.

===Trade with New France===
As early as 1726 the French made contact with the inhabitants of Kittanning and other Native American communities on the Allegheny. In a report written 1 October 1728, the Marquis de Beauharnois, Governor of New France, wrote that the Nation of the Chaouanons (Shawnees)

:&quot;has been much attached to the FrenchÂ ... These Indians have begun a village on the river Ohio, which already contains more than 150 men and their families. They have traded from all time with the French, and are a very industrious people, cultivating a good deal of landÂ ... Cavillier is the name of the person whom M. de Beauharnois has permitted to return to the Chaouanons. He is understood and known by these Indians, and will probably negotiate this affair with success.&quot;

In a deposition made by James Le Tort and Jonas Davenport at Philadelphia on 29 October 1731, they stated that they had

...Â lately come from Allegeney, where there are Indian settlements consisting of about three hundred Delawares, two hundred and sixty Shawnees, one hundred Asswekalaes, and some MingoesÂ ... and thatÂ ... a French gentleman, in appearance, came down the river to a settlement of the Delaware Indians on the Ohio River, which the Delawares call Kithanning, with an intentionÂ ... to enquire into the numbers of English Traders in those parts, and to sound the minds of the Indians.

On 7 December 1731, the Quaker trader Edmund Cartlidge, in a deposition in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania stated: &quot;For these five years past except that of 1729, a French gentleman who calls himself Cavalier has made it his practice to come every spring among the Indians settled thereÂ ... and that it is generally believed by all the Traders at AllegeneyÂ ... that this Cavalier is the bearer of the Governor of Montreal&#x27;s messages to the Indians in these parts.&quot;

===Petitions to the Pennsylvania Provincial Council, 1733-43===
On 24 April 1733, the Shawnee chiefs at Kittanning sent a petition to Governor Gordon complaining that &quot;There is yearly and monthly some new upstart of a trader without license, who comes amongst us and brings with him nothing but rumÂ ...&quot; and asking permission to destroy the casks of rum: &quot;We therefore beg thou would take it into consideration, and send us two firm orders, one for Peter Chartier, the other for us, to break in pieces all the [casks] so brought.&quot; Chartier was a licensed trader for Shawnee communities who later became a Shawnee leader.

In 1734 the Council received a second letter, dated 1 May, from Neucheconeh and other Shawnee chiefs living in Kittanning and other communities on the Allegheny, responding to Pennsylvania&#x27;s repeated requests that the Shawnees return to the Susquehanna Valley. The letter complained about certain traders who sold rum to the Shawnees, and they requested that these men be &quot;kept particularly&quot; from trading amongst the Shawnees. They then endorsed several traders whom &quot;we desire may have Licence to come and trade with us, as also Peter Cheartier, who we reckon one of us, and he is welcome to come as long as he pleases.&quot; They also petitioned that &quot;no trader above-mentioned may be allowed to bring more than 30 Gallons of Rum, twice in a year and no more&quot;, as excessive drinking was starting to have social and economic effects on the Shawnee people.

On 6 June 1743, Governor Thomas informed the Pennsylvania Council that traders living at Allegheny had been advised by some friends of theirs among the Indians to leave &quot;in order to avoid being murdered by the Indians, who had come to the resolution of cutting off all the white people.&quot; The Governor concluded that Peter Chartier had been spreading rumors in order to frighten traders who were still bringing quantities of rum into the Allegheny communities. In 1745 Chartier, dissatisfied with the Pennsylvania government&#x27;s unwillingness to restrict the sale of alcohol to Native Americans, led Neucheconeh, Meshemethequater and over 400 Pekowi Shawnees out of Pennsylvania to found the community of Eskippakithiki in Kentucky.

===Visit by CÃ©loron de Blainville, 1749===
In the summer of 1749 Pierre Joseph CÃ©loron de Blainville, leading a force of eight officers, six cadets, an armorer, 20 soldiers, 180 Canadians, 30 Iroquois and 25 Abenakis, moved down the Ohio River on a flotilla of 23 large boats and birch-bark canoes, on his &quot;lead plate expedition&quot;, burying lead plates at six locations where major tributaries entered the Ohio and nailing copper plates bearing royal arms to trees to claim the territory for New France.

CÃ©loron arrived at Kittanning, which he referred to as &quot;AttiguÃ©&quot;, on 6 August 1749. He found the village of 22 cabins (probably wickiups) abandoned except for a Lenape chief and two young men. Through his interpreter Philippe-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire, CÃ©loron told them, &quot;I come only to speak to the nations of the Beautiful River (the Ohio), to animate the children of the (French) government which inhabit it.&quot; CÃ©loron gave this chief wampum belts to deliver to the villages lower down as an invitation to hear CÃ©loron speak at a council he was planning to hold in the nearby village of ChininguÃ© (Logstown). He requested that anyone attending his council should &quot;remain quiet upon their mats [listen attentively without interrupting], since I only came to treat of affairs with them, which would be advantageous to them.&quot;

=== Captives ===

At the beginning of the French and Indian War, the defeat of General Edward Braddock in July 1755 left Pennsylvania without a professional military force. Shingas and Captain Jacobs launched dozens of Shawnee and Delaware raids against British colonial settlements, killing and capturing hundreds of colonists and destroying settlements across western and central Pennsylvania. Kittanning was used as a staging point for these raids, where warriors would gather to prepare and where prisoners were brought immediately afterwards. At the time of the Kittanning Expedition in September 1756, up to a hundred prisoners may have been temporarily held at Kittanning. Accounts of some captives mentioned their visit to the village, including:

* James Smith probably spent three weeks in June 1755, at Kittanning, which he does not name, but refers to as &quot;an Indian town that was on the north side of the [Allegheny] River, about forty miles above Fort Duquesne.
* Charles Stuart and his wife and children, along with about 13 other captives taken at the Great Cove massacre, were taken to Kittanning in November 1755, and after being forced to run the gauntlet, spent one night there before being given as a gift to a Wyandot chief and sent to Ohio.
* Marie Le Roy and Barbara Leininger, both age 12, were held at Kittanning from December 1755 until the day the village was attacked and destroyed:

We remained at Kittanny until the month of September, 1756. The Indians gave us enough to do. We had to tan leather to make shoes (moccasins), to clear land, to plant corn, to cut down trees, to build hutts, to wash and cook. The want of provisions, however, caused us the greatest suffering. During all the time we were at Kittanny we had neither lard nor salt, and sometimes we were forced to live on acorns, roots, grass and bark. There was nothing in the world to make this new sort of food palatable, excepting hunger itself. In the month of September, Colonel Armstrong arrived and attacked Kittanny town. Both of us happened to be in that part of it that lies on the other side of the river. We were immediately conveyed ten miles further into the interior, in order that we might have no chance of trying, on this occasion, to escape. The savages threatened to kill usÂ ... After the English had withdrawn, we were again brought back to Kittanny, which town had been burned to the ground.

* John Cox or Coxe, 18, reported that he and his brother Richard, and another man named John Craig, were taken in early February, 1756 by Delaware Indians,

...Â and brought to Kittanning &quot;on the Ohio.&quot; On his way hither he met Captain Jacobs and 15 men, whose design was to destroy the settlements on Conococheague Creek. When [Coxe] arrived at Kittanning, he saw about 100 fighting men of the Delaware tribe, with their families, and about 50 English prisoners, consisting of men, women and children. During his stay here Shingas&#x27; and Jacobs&#x27; parties returnedÂ ... The warriors held a war council which, with their war dances, continued a week, when Captain Jacobs left with 48 men, intending, as Coxe was told, to fall upon the inhabitants at Paxtang.

:Cox was later taken to Tioga, Pennsylvania and managed to escape to Fort Augusta on 14 August 1756.

* About 21 captives taken after the attack on Fort McCord on 1 April 1756 were brought to Kittanning, arriving on 12 April, according to the 1760 account of Jean Lowry, who was one of the prisoners. They stayed only one night before going to Fort Machault.
* George Woods, (father-in-law of Pennsylvania senator James Ross), was captured during the assault on Fort Bigham on 11 June 1756. After running the gauntlet, Woods was adopted into the tribe. He reportedly bargained with his captors to pay an annual fee of ten pounds of tobacco for life, in exchange for his freedom. Eventually Woods was taken to Fort Pitt and released.
* Simon Girty, then only 15 years old, was captured when Fort Granville was taken by the French and Indians in July 1756, and taken to Kittanning with his stepfather, his mother, and his brothers Thomas, John, George, and James Girty. There he had to witness the torture and death of his stepfather, John Turner. His older brother Thomas was one of the seven prisoners rescued by Colonel Armstrong, although Simon, his mother and his other brothers remained in captivity. Simon was released by order of Colonel Henry Bouquet in November 1764. Later he fought on both sides during the American Revolutionary War and took part in several other campaigns.
* Hugh Gibson, 14, was captured in July 1756, by Delaware Indians, outside Robinson&#x27;s Fort, near present-day Southwest Madison Township, Pennsylvania. His mother and a neighbor were killed by the Indians, and he was brought to Kittanning, where he was adopted by Shingas&#x27; brother Pisquetomen, a Delaware chief (who Gibson refers to as &quot;Bisquittam&quot;). Gibson was living in Kittanning when Armstrong&#x27;s attack began, and asked Pisquetomen what he should do. Pisquetomen told him to stay with the women. After the attack, he was forced to witness the torture of a woman who had attempted to escape with Armstrong&#x27;s men. Gibson was then taken to Saucunk, and later to Muskingum. In March 1759, he escaped, together with Marie Le Roy, Barbara Leininger and David Brackenridge, a Scotsman, and walked 250 miles to Fort Pitt (then under construction).

By the summer of 1756, over three thousand colonists had been killed or captured in Pennsylvania, Virginia and the Carolinas. Numerous settlements had been burned or abandoned. Between Braddock&#x27;s defeat in July 1755 and the raid on Kittanning in September 1756, Native American war parties conducted at least seventy-eight raids in Pennsylvania, killing 484 Pennsylvanians and capturing at least 202.

===Destruction, 1756===

In response, Governor Robert Hunter Morris ordered the construction of forts garrisoned with colonial militia, and in early 1756 Fort Augusta, Fort Shirley, Fort Lyttleton and Fort Granville were built. However, over a hundred well-supplied Indian warriors, with the support of 55 professional French troops, attacked and burned Fort Granville on 2 August 1756, capturing 27 soldiers and civilians and killing the fort&#x27;s commander, Lieutenant Edward Armstrong. Governor Morris wanted to launch an attack that would strike into the Indians&#x27; home territory and kill one or more of their leaders. Provincial authorities offered a substantial reward for the death of Shingas and Captain Jacobs.

At a council in Carlisle, George Croghan informed Governor Morris that &quot;he had sent a Delaware Indian called Jo HickmanÂ ... to KittanningÂ ... where he found 140 men, chiefly Delawares and Shawanese, who had then with them above 100 English prisoners, big and little, taken from Virginia and Pennsylvania.&quot; A map of Kittanning drawn by John Baker, who was held captive in Kittanning from January 1756 until March, when he escaped, was included in Armstrong&#x27;s proposal for the raid. It is labelled

Kittanning, a Rough Sketch. John Baker, Soldier at Fort Shierley, who last Winter made his escape from the Indians at the Kittanning, says there are generally near 100 Warriors beside Elderly men and boys at said Town and that more than [100] English prisoners were there when he came off, that the Alleghany Hills will not admit any Road that can be travel&#x27;d from the Forts Shirley or Lyttleton to that Town in less than 150 Miles or thereabout.

The map states that the village was &quot;200 perches in length&quot;, (about 1005 meters or 3,300 feet) and labels the homes of Shingas (separated from the village on the north bank of the river), Captain Jacobs, Pisquetomen, King Beaver (Tamaqua), John and Joseph (Jo) Hickman, and &quot;Bill&#x27;s House&quot; (the home of Bill Hickman), as well as a cornfield and a &quot;long house, 30 feet, where frolicks and war dances are held.&quot; The map depicts 40 houses, grouped according to clans, set in an arc overlooking the fields, and shows the town as situated to the south of the Allegheny River and to the west of Cowanshannock Creek.

In August, Lieutenant Colonel John Armstrong (brother of Fort Granville&#x27;s commander) led 300 Pennsylvanian provincial troops on the Kittanning Expedition, attacking and destroying the village on 8 September 1756. Several of the town&#x27;s houses were destroyed when they caught fire and kegs of gunpowder stored in them exploded: &quot;Nearly thirty houses were fired, and while they were burning, the ears of Col. Armstrong and his men were regaled by the successive discharges of loaded guns, and still more so by the explosion of sundry bags and large kegs of powder stored away in every house.&quot;

Little is known of the houses at Kittanning. Robert Robinson&#x27;s eyewitness account of the battle says that Captain Jacobs barricaded himself and his wife and son inside his cabin, which appears to have been a European-style home with a &quot;garret or cock loft window&quot; from which he attempted to escape after it was set on fire by the Pennsylvanians. Robinson also refers to another &quot;house covered with bark&quot;, which may have been a traditional Lenape wickiup.

Armstrong described the
...Â vast Explosion of sundry Bags and large Cags of Gunpowder wherewith almost every House abounded, the Prisoners afterwards informing that the Indians had frequently said they had a sufficient Stock of Ammunition for ten Years War with the English. With the Rooff of Capt Jacob&#x27;s House when the Powder blew up, was thrown the Leg &amp; Thigh of an Indian with a Child of three or four Years old such a Height that theyÂ ... fell in the adjacent Corn Field. There was also a great Quantity of Goods burnt which the Indians had received in a present but ten Days before from the French.
 Robinson notes, &quot;When the Indian magazine blew up in the town...[the] report was heard at Fort Pitt.&quot;

After the destruction of the town, many of its inhabitants returned and erected their wigwams on the ashes of their former homes. The town was reoccupied briefly and two of the Pennsylvanian prisoners who had attempted to escape with Armstrong&#x27;s men were tortured to death. The Indians then harvested their corn and moved to Fort Duquesne, where they requested permission from the French to resettle further to the west, away from British colonists. According to Marie Le Roy and Barbara Leininger, many of Kittanning&#x27;s inhabitants moved to Saucunk, Kuskusky or Muskingum.

== Fort Armstrong ==

The site was later used as a staging ground for Native American campaigns. In August, 1763, a force of Delaware, Shawnee, Mingo, and Huron warriors assembled at the site before attacking Colonel Henry Bouquet at the Battle of Bushy Run.

In 1774, the militia of Hannastown, Pennsylvania was briefly stationed at the site of the village, which was still uninhabited. Arthur St. Clair suggested in a letter the construction of a &quot;stockade fort, and of laying out a town at the Kittanning, as the basis for the Indian trade on the part of the Province.&quot; Governor John Penn responded: &quot;I approve of the measure of laying out a town in the Proprietary Manor at Kittanning, to accommodate the Traders and other inhabitants who may chuse to reside there, and therefore I inclose you an Order for that purpose. But I cannot, without the concurrence of the Assembly, give any directions for erecting a Stockade.&quot; The project to build a town was not put into action, but the site was used by the 8th Pennsylvania Regiment as a transient military camp from 15 July to 15 September 1776 during the American Revolutionary War.

In March 1779 George Washington sent Colonel Moses Rawlings from Fort Frederick in Maryland to &quot;take post at Kittanning and immediately throw up a stockade fort for the security of the convoys.&quot; This project was given to Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Brodhead, who wrote to Washington on 24 June: &quot;Lt. Colonel Bayard, with 121 Rank and file, is now employed at Erecting a Stockade Fort at Kittanning.&quot; On 1 July he wrote to Colonel Bayard: &quot;I think it is a compliment due to Colonel Armstrong to call that fort after him, therefore it is my pleasure that from this time forward it be called Fort Armstrong.&quot; On 20 July he wrote to Bayard: &quot;You will order two officers, two sergeants, and twenty-four rank and file of the worst kind to remain at the post.&quot; The fort was abandoned on 27 November, as the garrison was needed elsewhere. Attempts were made to re-establish a garrison there, but due to difficulties in providing food and supplies, this was never done. In July 1782, Seneca Indian warriors led by Guyasuta gathered at the site in preparation for their attack on Hannastown, Pennsylvania.

Ruins of the fort, including a well, were still visible as late as 1875.

<doc id="645727" wikidata="Q7488446" url="?curid=645727" title="Shanghai Foreign Language School">
<text>Shanghai Foreign Language School (SFLS, ) is a secondary school based in Shanghai, China providing education encompasses grades 6 through 12. Foreign language teaching is traditionally a specialty.

Shanghai Foreign Language School (SFLS), affiliated with the Shanghai International Studies University (SISU), is a seven-year boarding school located in northeast Shanghai. It covers an area of 33 mu, with the total construction area of 22,508 square meters. SFLS was established in 1963, and reports directly to the Chinese Ministry of Education.

==Location==
The school is located at 295 Zhongshan Bei Yi Road(), Hongkou District(), Shanghai, China.

In February 2012, SFLS campus was temporarily moved to 730 North Station Road (è½¦ç«åè·¯730å·) because of the demolition and refurbishment project on old school buildings.

In September 2015, SFLS moved back to the campus due to the finish of the project.

==History==
It was founded in 1963 as one of China&#x27;s seven earliest foreign language schools in the metropolis. The school is affiliated with the Shanghai International Studies University.

It is a full-time boarding school specializing in foreign language education. Receiving funds from China&#x27;s Ministry of Education, it is a renowned middle school in Shanghai supervised jointly by Shanghai Municipal Education Commission and Shanghai International Studies University (SISU).

==Teaching methods==

SFLS adopts &quot;An Integrated Course of English&quot; as its main teaching material for English classes. Supplementary materials include &quot;Look, Listen and Learn&quot; (Louis George Alexander) for students in 6th to 9th grade (Junior High), and &quot;Look Ahead Books 3 and 4&quot; for students in 9th to 12th grade (Senior High).

Languages classes are smaller than other classes, and are usually between 20-25 students. Teaching focuses on cultivating students&#x27; oral and written abilities in foreign languages. Some of the teaching activities are conducted by foreign experts. The school is equipped with advanced audio-visual equipment.

The school shifted from the traditional teaching methods centering on translation and grammar to a set of &quot;elicitation method of teaching in situations&quot;. This emphasizes the students&#x27; audio-lingual skills by training their pronunciation and intonation.

==Teaching focus==

In teaching foreign languages, besides emphasizing students&#x27; abilities in different practical situations, the school practices the &quot;going out and inviting in&quot; method. The so-called &quot;going out&quot; means that a number of students are provided with opportunities to study abroad as exchange students at locations like Sukura Nobirin College in Japan, Christina College in Hamburg, Germany, La Salle College, Hong Kong, and The Culver Academies, in Indiana US. The so-called &quot;inviting in&quot; means that the school invites foreign visitors so as to provide the students with the opportunity to practice what they have learned in school. Every year, more than 100 students in the school have the chance to receive foreign visitors including members of government delegations, foreign students, and foreign reporters.

In order to extend students&#x27; scope of knowledge, the school provides additional courses in the form of the Second Classroom, such as:
* Second foreign language courses
* Selective courses in foreign language study (e.g. Newspaper Reading in Original, Foreign Literature, Foreign History, and Survey of the Countries in the World, etc.)
* Public Relations
* English of Science and Technology
* Cultures and Customs Worldwide
* Reading on Ancient Poems

In Activities courses, there are seminars on Spare-time Politics school, and workshops such as &quot;Green-Grass&quot; Literature, Cartoon, Computer, Film Review, Chinese Calligraphy, Sketch, Wind Band, Chorus, Piano, Food Sculpture, Handcraft, and so on.

With the help of the League Branch in each class, the school organizes students to read books in groups. The Senior class has a mobile bookshelf whereas a mini library is found in the Junior class. Now half of the classes have put this program into full play.

SFLS is the head of the National Association of Foreign Language Teaching and Research of foreign languages schools in China. Research results of the association are exchanged at the annual meeting.

==Club Activities==
The school offers more than 50 club activities for students that include Model United Nations, AI and Algorithm Design, United States Academic Decathlon, robotics and architecture. Model United Nations has been one of the key activities that students take part in as it is directly related to foreign languages and also foreign relations, two main focuses of the school.
The school also has a football and baseball team. SFLS&#x27;s floorball team has been one of the most successful in the East China Region, winning the championship twice.

==Awards==
In 1999, SFLS was awarded Advanced Secondary School in moral education in Shanghai. SFLS students have won prizes such as the first prize in the National Japanese Speech Contest, two special awards in the National English Oral Contest (Junior and Senior respectively), the 3rd, 5th and 7th prizes in the National &quot;World of Water&quot; Contest in German (mainly for Chinese college students). Students of SFLS&#x27; &quot;Five Elements Group&quot; (the only team representing Shanghai) were sent to the USA for the Summit of International High School after competition on the Internet.

SFLS students have won many other rewards, such as the first awards, Junior and Senior respectively, in Sino-USA Students&#x27; Speech Contest in using the other party&#x27;s mother tongue; the first and third awards in the global Math Model Contest for college students as well as the first award for four years in a succession in Shanghai&#x27;s Popular Science English Contest.

==Modern technology==
To meet the development of modern science and technology, SFLS provides courses like English of Science and Technology and English Newspaper Reading. It has invested 100,000 Yuan in these science courses.

For the past three years, SFLS has spent 300,000 Yuan on relief funds, Hope Project, financial aids to the students in the straightened circumstance, and to the underprivileged students, reducing the fees of government-funded students who study aboard.

<text>MontaVista Software is a company that develops embedded Linux system software, development tools, and related software. Its products are made for other corporations developing embedded systems such as automotive electronics, communications equipment, mobile phones, and other electronic devices and infrastructure.

MontaVista is based in Santa Clara, California and was founded in 1999 by James &quot;Jim&quot; Ready (formerly at Mentor Graphics and creator of Versatile Real-Time Executive (VRTX)) and others. On November 10, 2009 Cavium Networks announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to purchase MontaVista for $50 million. After Cavium got acquired by Marvell, Montavista operated as an independent entity.

==Products==

===Linux===
May 12, 2009, MontaVista announced MontaVista Linux 6 (MVL6) comprising Market Specific Distributions, MontaVista Integration Platform, Software Development Kit, MontaVista Zone Content Server, and support and services. There are several differences between MVL6 and prior MontaVista Linux products. The main ones are:

* Market Specific Distributions (MSD)Linux operating systems (kernel + userland) optimized for each specific semiconductor vendor&#x27;s hardware.
* MontaVista Integration Platformbased on BitBake, analogous to &quot;make&quot;, which analyzes a set of directives and then builds a task dependency tree to satisfy a user command. BitBake then executes the defined tasks to completion.
* MontaVista Zone Content Serveraccessed from behind a proxy server, or local web mirror for offline operations, to fetch software and updates. Rather than depending on a mix of public HTTP, Concurrent Versions System (CVS), Git, and Subversion servers across the Internet, there is one source for each original source archive and patch.

&quot;MontaVista Linux&quot; (formerly named &quot;Hard Hat Linux&quot;) is a Linux distribution that has been enhanced to become a full real-time operating system. The work on real-time performance has since continued to a point where MontaVista claims to support hard real-time tasks on embedded Linux as of MontaVista Linux 4.0, with response times as fast as other real-time operating systems.

MontaVista sells &quot;subscriptions&quot;, which consist of software, documentation, and technical support. The software includes a Linux kernel and toolchain aimed at a specific hardware configuration, collectively called a Linux Support Package (LSP), and other integrated tools including the Eclipse-based DevRocket integrated development environment (IDE). The distribution is available in three editions, each aimed at different market segments: &quot;Professional Edition&quot;, &quot;Carrier Grade Edition&quot;, and &quot;Mobilinux&quot;. The MontaVista Linux toolkit includes specific code libraries to easily migrate from Wind River Systems&#x27; VxWorks and the pSOS operating systems.

==== OpenCGX ====
Project OpenCGX is an open and free to use embedded Linux distribution from MontaVista Software LLC. OpenCGX is based on MontaVistaâs eleventh generation Carrier Grade Linux. Engineers can quickly jumpstart their ARM and x86 development with a full embedded Linux distribution that is easily customizable. OpenCGX in its introduction is based on Yocto 2.4 with Linux Kernel 4.14 (or latest LTS kernel) and GNU 7.2 toolchain.

=== Carrier Grade eXpress (CGX) ===
As a cornerstone in MontaVista&#x27;s product lineup, Carrier Grade eXpress (CGX) is a robust operating system equipped with Carrier Grade Linux (CGL) specifications, ensuring unparalleled performance and security for a wide array of interconnected smart applications across industries. 

MontaVista Linux CGX 5.0, the 15th generation of MontaVistaâs Carrier Grade Linux, is built on the foundation of the Yocto Project 5.0 LTS release and the Linux kernel 6.6 LTS. With the GCC 13 and CLANG 18 toolchain, MontaVista CGX 5.0 provides a commercially supported Linux distribution for creating diverse embedded products on major CPU architectures, including x86, ARM, PPC, MIPS, and RISC-V.

===Carrier Grade Edition===
MontaVista Linux Carrier Grade Edition (CGE) is a commercial-grade Linux development platform for developers working with reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) managed hardware (Hardware Platform Interface (HPI), Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI)) or custom hardware, who need long-term support and high availability.
Carrier Grade Linux is governed by the Linux Foundation CGL working group.

===DevRocket===
&quot;MontaVista DevRocket&quot; is a set of Eclipse plug-ins for facilitating application and system development with MontaVista Linux. DevRocket integrated development environment (IDE) runs on Linux, Solaris and Windows. It uses the Eclipse C++ Development Toolkit (CDT). Starting with DevRocket 5.0, users can add MontaVista&#x27;s plug-ins into an existing Eclipse installation, or install Eclipse with the plugins already loaded.

DevRocket is available in two varieties: a Platform Developer Kit (PDK) and Application Developer Kit (ADK). The Platform Developer Kit includes the ability to communicate with a target (RSE, SSH), create and manage file systems, debugging (kgdb), and performance tuning (memory leak, memory use, system profiling). The application developer kit includes a virtual target for developing applications earlier in the development cycle, one-click edit/compile/debug, and performance tuning.

== Services ==

=== Custom Hardware Enablement ===

=== RTOS/Legacy Migration ===

=== System Certification ===
MontaVista Linux is being used in applications within IT and telecom that need to be certified according to Common Criteria, up to EAL4+ level. Evaluation Assurance Level 4+ (EAL4+) is commonly used to secure connectivity in critical environments, such as fire and police departments, or aviation and industry control systems. With the help of EAL4+ these critical environments can, for example, ensure secure and safe phone calls, control communication in-flight and for the assembly line, and achieve secure internet access.

== Legacy products ==
Several legacy products are available from MontaVista under long-term support agreements.

=== Mobilinux ===
MontaVista Mobilinux is for wireless handsets and other mobile devices such as Global Positioning System (GPS) devices, portable medical devices, and wireless POS terminals. Mobilinux&#x27;s key features include dynamic power management, real-time performance, fast booting, and small memory footprint.

===Professional Edition===
MontaVista Professional Edition (Pro) is for general embedded Linux developers. Pro is for intelligent device markets, including networking and communications, instrumentation and control, aerospace and defense, small office/home office (SOHO) devices, and medical devices. Future development of MontaVista Pro has been folded into MontaVista Linux, effectively ending this as a separate edition starting version 5.0.24.

==Open source contributions==
MontaVista has a history of being a major contributor to the Linux kernel and the open source community. From the start, Jim Ready said he wanted to make it &quot;100% pure Linux&quot; under the GPL. The core changes to make MontaVista Linux into a real-time operating system were made by Nigel Gamble and later updated by Robert Love. Robert Love submitted the changes to the Linux kernel in 2001. The Linux 2.6 stable kernel series is the first to include similar features, such as priority-based preemption. As of 2008, MontaVista had contributed 1.2% of the Linux kernel, making it the 9th-largest corporate contributor to the Linux kernel, according to a survey by the Linux Foundation.

MontaVista has also spun off independent open source projects based on several of its features, including dynamic power management, high resolution POSIX timers, the pramfs file system, and the &quot;openais&quot; implementation of the Service Availability Forum&#x27;s (SA Forum) Application Interface Specification.

Other versions of MontaVista Linux are used in devices made by a number of partners, including Sony Bravia TVs, NEC routers, and others, especially in Japan. A version of MontaVista Linux OS is used in Dell Latitude E4200 and E4300 notebooks to provide the Latitude ON feature.

Cisco NX-OS is based on HardHat Linux.

===Mobile phones===
Motorola became the first company to use Linux on a mobile phone when it released the Motorola A760 to the Chinese market on February 16, 2003. Motorola chose to use MontaVista Linux in the Motorola A760 and future Linux-based phones, despite the fact that Motorola was a founding member of the competing Symbian OS. Since then, Motorola has increased focus on its Linux platform and publicly stated that the future platform for all its mid- and high-tier mobile phones will be Linux with Java, and other phone manufacturers NEC and Panasonic have developed a common platform based on MontaVista Linux.

<text>The Kal-Haven Trail, formally known as the Kal-Haven Trail Sesquicentennial State Park, is a rail trail in the US that originally ran between South Haven, Michigan, to a point just west of the city of Kalamazoo, Michigan, where there is a trailhead. In 2008, the trail was extended east from the trailhead to downtown Kalamazoo as part of the Kalamazoo River Valley Trail.

==Description==
The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and Pure Michigan designated the Kal-Haven trail as one of the &quot;Pure Michigan&quot; trails because it &quot;provide[s] access to high quality scenic views.

The Kal-Haven trail is a former railroad bed that has been converted to trail using Limestone/slag surface.

==Location==

Most of the trail is in Van Buren County and that county operates it between the trailhead and South Haven, including the parts within Kalamazoo County. The Van Buren-controlled portion previously required a trail pass, but as of 2011, the usage fee was dropped.

The Kal-Haven Trail runs along the former route of the Kalamazoo and South Haven Railroad, as does a section of the Kalamazoo River Valley Trail. It traverses wooded areas, farmland and small towns. It is primarily used by hikers and bicyclists in the summer, and by snowmobilers in the winter. The trail is surfaced with crushed limestone. Horseback riding was allowed on an 11-mile section adjacent to the trail. The starting point for riding was at 67th street and Baseline road. Due to lack of use the horse trail has been left to nature and is no longer a part of the trail.

Currently, the trail passes through the following locations, from east to west:
==History==
In 1870 the Kalamazoo-South Haven Railroad was built to transport mostly lumber. The railroad operated between Kalamazoo and South Haven for just over 100 years spanning from 1870-1973 when the line was abandoned.

The Kal-Haven Trail State Park was slated to be dedicated October of 1976; the trail was to run along the abandoned Penn Central Railroad route from Kalamazoo to South Haven. The 1976 opening dedication was not to happen. The trail was to be a pilot project that was modeled off other trails that had been done in Wisconsin and Illinois.

The first proposal for the Kal-Haven trail was not welcomed by all local government officials. A supervisor of Alamo township claimed to have a &quot;bad premonition&quot; of the proposed project. One of the main concerns is the responsibility for patrolling and controlling the trail to respect the private property owners rights bordering the small 100 foot wide park. A public meeting was held in August 1976 to discuss the pros and cons of the proposed park; issues to be discussed were concerns over possible problems like law enforcement, litter, and trespassing onto private property. After a public meeting, the public reaction was reported to be about 50â50 with most objections coming from land owners that owned land nearby.

After years of dangling the trail before the citizens of between South Haven and Kalamazoo, the Kal-Haven Trail Association was formed and a public meeting was scheduled. The hope of the Kal-Haven was labeled &#x27;Dormant Monster&#x27; in 1984 with the trail being called an ill-conceived plan that would have included &quot;such evils as rampant theft, vandalism, littering and drug and alcohol abuse.&quot; However, these views were in the minority at the time and a poll taken at the time found that 80% of people were in support but the vocal minority had disproportionate influence in opposition. In what looked to be another nail in the coffin of the proposed Kal-Haven trail, Bloomingdale Township voted against the trail in 1984.

The Kal-Haven Trail Association was met with opposition by Property Owners United, a Citizens group that was against the trails creation. In November 1984, a public meeting was held that had over 100 people attending to discuss the trail. At the meeting one local resident expressed concerns that they had already experienced an invasion of privacy by people already using the abandoned rail line. Pine Grove Township passed a resolution against the trail stating &quot;[the] state has made no declaration or commitments to assure safety and tranquility of property owners, and has made no assurances for safety and welfare of users of the park.&quot;

The Columbia Township board voted in November 1984 opposing the proposed trail.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) worked with the Michigan Department of Transportation (M-DOT) on the development of the trail. To build the trail MDOT had to acquire the abandoned rail bed which was 498 acres of land spread over 200 different parcels of real estate. The park was built as the first &quot;linear park&quot; in Michigan. To acquire the land from Penn Central would take approval from the Federal Bankruptcy court because in 1970 the company went into bankruptcy and eight years later the court was still dealing with liquidating Penn Central&#x27;s assets including real estate holdings which included the Kal-Haven Rail bed. In 1987, the Natural Resource Commission voted to buy the 36 1/2 miles from the Penn Central Corp for $428,750 with the Penn Central Board of Directors giving an unofficial approval.

In November 1987, Property Owners United wrote a letter to the editor of The Herald-Palladium laying out 11 areas of concern: invasion of privacy, wasteful use of tax money for the benefit of a few, crime on the trail (thievery, vandalism, illicit sex, drug use, etc.), cost would be &quot;astronomical&quot;, incompatibility of the proposals (how can hikers, bikers, horses, and snowmobiles all use the same path), loss of tax money being paid by Penn Central for property tax, declining property value, and alleged violation of the Public Act No. 116 of 1974 of preserving farm land.

On January 13, 1988, a ceremony was held at the Bloomingdale Depot Museum where the State of Michigan handed a check for $428,750 to a representative of Penn Central Corp. The site was chosen as it was the midway point in the trail, and the Friends of the Kal-Haven Trail presented a golden spike symbolizing the completion of the sale to the DNR chief administrative officer.

The DNR added four additional parcels of land to totaling 35 more acres to the trail; all of the parcels were tax revered land in Van Buren County.

=== Bridge Ownership Dispute ===
In 1987, a historic &quot;humpback&quot; wooden bridge in Pine grove township was slated to be taken down and removed from County Road 653. Local residents started a protest after the contract was awarded for demolition of the bridge. The cost to replace the bridge was going to be only $40,000 but the cost to repair would have been $100,000. The historic humpback bridge was built in the 1800s which was built to have CR-653 cross the Penn Central Rail line. The bridge was closed because the deck was unsafe to carry traffic. 425 citizens signed a petition asking that the bridge be spared. The county was going to pay $1,500 to have the bridge demolished, but voted to pay an additional $4,500 to have the bridge disassembled. A group was formed called Save the Bridge Fund.

During the building of the Kal-Haven trail, the DNR contacted the Van Buren County Road Commission to ask about the bridge; hearing no objection, they started to almost completely reconstruct the old bridge for use on the trail. The group Pine Grove Association was asked if they had any objection to relocating the bridge; not hearing back, the DNR began reconstruction in September. It was determined after the group asked the DNR to stop work that the Association and not the county owned the bridge. The Association had objection to the bridge being moved out of Pine Grove. One main objection the group had was DNR&#x27;s plan to change the bridge from a width of 22 feet down to just 14 feet. The County Road commission took the stance that the rights to the timber were awarded to the contractor who took the bridge apart. The contractor then sold the bridge to the association. For a short period of time, the partially rebuilt bridge was known as the &#x27;bridge to nowhere&#x27; while the dispute was ongoing.

=== Opening of the Kal-Haven Trail ===
The trail was projected to open in May, but the opining was delayed because Property Owners United sought a court injunction to stop the opening of the trail. On May 3, 1989, the group filed their lawsuit against the DNR. During settlement talks between the DNR and property owners, fencing was agreed to and delay of the grand opening till labor day the injunction was lifted for the trail to open August 15, 1989. The project that was supposed to open in 1976 and had spent years being debated was opened in 1989 without any fanfare or ceremony. This opening marks the first linear park opening in the state of Michigan.

==Funding==
The cost to acquire all the land in 1976 was estimated at $300,000 and to build the original 8-foot-wide asphalt pathway was an estimated $1,330,000. The Federal Government agreed to pay half the cost of the Kal-Haven trail via grant for $1,012,500 with matching funds provided by the state of Michigan.

In 1981, Michigan State Senator Edgar Fredricks proposed a bill earmarking $8.2 million for the trail; the money earmarked came from a sum of $22 million paid to the state from Penn Central as back taxes owed. However, because of state budget problems, the money proposed from this fund was moved to the state&#x27;s general fund and many people assumed the trail was done for.

The cost for the acquiring the land and developing it in 1984 was estimated to cost $2.7 million with about $30,000 needed annually to operate and maintain the trail for public use. The Michigan Land Trust Board was created from oil and gas lease revenues from wells on state lands and only used to buy lands which are environmentally sensitive or provided &quot;significant&quot; recreational opportunities. In January 1985, the Michigan Land Trust Board passed the trail proposal. The cost of the land was now up to $700,000 with a total project cost estimated to cost $1.15 million. The Michigan Land Trust Board received about 1,000 postcards sent from the group Property Owners United.

A $100,000 grant was approved by Gov. James Blanchard to employ 27 Michigan Youth Corps workers to clear the 36 1/2 miles of abandoned right-of-way.

A $250,000 grant from the Michigan Natural Resources Trust Fund was awarded for grading and surfacing work on the trail.

The trail is owned by the state of Michigan but, due to state budget cutbacks, in 2004 operation was taken over by Van Buren County, including the portion in Kalamazoo County. A trail pass system was re-instituted to pay for trail maintenance, but was dropped again in 2011.

For the Kalamazoo River Valley Trail, in November 2004 the State of Michigan completed a tunnel underneath the U.S. Highway 131 freeway, which was the major impediment to extending the trail to downtown Kalamazoo. The city of Kalamazoo approved a $1 million project to extend the trail southeast under U.S. 131 along Ravine Road to Westnedge Avenue in downtown Kalamazoo. Most of the extension was built along the former roadbed of the Kalamazoo and South Haven Railroad.

In the summer of 2022, it was announced that Michigan Department of Natural Resources had been awarded a $5 million grant to do resurface 17 miles of the trail. The project will resurface from the trail head in South Haven to Bloomingdale. The money is coming from the Building Michigan Together Plan, signed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2022. The Build Michigan Together Plan is a $4.8 billion federal funding to invest in roads, water, high-speed internet.

==Amenities==

There are two primitive campgrounds that can be used at an additional cost. One, near Gobles, has water and restrooms. The other, near South Haven, has restrooms but no water.

Van Buren County offered a shuttle service through Van Buren Public Transit from South Haven to Kalamazoo and can accommodate up to four bikes and their riders. As of August 2015 this service was no longer offered.

The Kalamazoo Trail Head to South Haven Trail Head contain major deer fly populations. Several miles south of the western terminus is another trailâthe Van Buren Trail State Park. This is also an old railroad bed, ending in Hartford, Michigan. The trail is unimproved and the largest group of users are snowmobilers and horse and buggy riders. This is also operated by Michigan D.N.R.

<doc id="645737" wikidata="Q598995" url="?curid=645737" title="Guy Maddin">
<text>Guy Maddin (born February 28, 1956) is a Canadian screenwriter, director, author, cinematographer, and film editor of both features and short films, as well as an installation artist, from Winnipeg, Manitoba. Since completing his first film in 1985, Maddin has become one of Canada&#x27;s most well-known and celebrated filmmakers.

Maddin has directed twelve feature films and numerous short films, in addition to publishing three books and creating a host of installation art projects. A number of Maddin&#x27;s recent films began as or developed from installation art projects, and his books also relate to his film work. Maddin is known for his fascination with lost Silent-era films and for incorporating their aesthetics into his own work. Maddin has been the subject of much critical praise and academic attention, including two books of interviews with Maddin and two book-length academic studies of his work. Maddin was appointed to the Order of Canada, the country&#x27;s highest civilian honour, in 2012.

Maddin first served as a visiting lecturer at Harvard University&#x27;s Department of Art, Film, and Visual Studies in 2015. Until then, he lived in Winnipeg.

== Life and career ==
=== Early life (1956â84) ===
Guy Maddin was born on February 28, 1956, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, to Herdis Maddin (a hairdresser) and Charles &quot;Chas&quot; Maddin (grain clerk and general manager of the Maroons, a Winnipeg hockey team). Maddin has three older siblings: Ross (b. 1944), Cameron (1946â63), and Janet (b. 1949). Maddin attended Winnipeg public schools: the Greenway School (elementary school), General Wolfe (junior high school), and the Daniel McIntyre Collegiate Institute (high school). In February 1963, his brother Cameron killed himself on the grave of his girlfriend, who had died in a car crash.

Maddin studied economics at the University of Winnipeg, graduating in 1977 without a plan to become a filmmaker. That same year, Maddin&#x27;s father died suddenly after a stroke, and Maddin married Martha Jane Waugh. Their daughter, Jilian, was born in 1978, and Maddin and Waugh divorced in 1979.

After graduating, Maddin held a variety of odd jobs, including bank manager, house painter, and photo archivist. Maddin began to take film classes at the University of Manitoba. There, Maddin met film professor Stephen Snyder, who held regular film screenings of titles from the school&#x27;s film library at his home. Maddin attended, as did some early collaborators, including his friend John Boles Harvie, the future star of Maddin&#x27;s first film, and filmmaker John Paizs. Maddin appeared as an actor in two of Paizs&#x27; short films, as a student in &quot;Oak, Ivy, and Other Dead Elms&quot; (1982) and as a transvestite, homicidal nurse in &quot;The International Style&quot; (1983). Maddin drew early inspiration from the films of John Paizs, as well as experimental shorts by Stephen Snyder. Other early influences included &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; by Luis BuÃ±uel (in collaboration with Salvador DalÃ­) and &quot;Eraserhead&quot; by David Lynch. Maddin has stated that these films, along with the work of Paizs and Snyder, &quot;were movies that were primitive in many respects. They were low budget, they used nonactors or nonstars, they used atmospheres and ideas, and were unbelievably honest, frank, and, therefore, exciting to me. They made moviemaking seem possible to me.&quot; Maddin also met film professor George Toles, who became Maddin&#x27;s cowriter on many of his future films. Maddin&#x27;s core group of friends from this period, who played various roles in the production of his early film projects, were known as &quot;the Drones&quot; and included Harvie, Ian Handford, and Kyle McCulloch (now a writer for South Park).

Maddin joined the Winnipeg Film Group around this time, and also became friends with producer Greg Klymkiw, with whom he began making a cable access television show, &quot;Survival&quot; (c. 1985â87). &quot;Survival&quot; was a satirical talk show centred around, as its opening credits noted, how &quot;we must survive the inevitable social/economic collapse and/or nuclear holocaust&quot;. The show became a cult hit in Winnipeg and excerpts were re-released on the compilation DVD &quot;Winnipeg Babysitter&quot;. Maddin plays a masked character on the show named &quot;Concerned Citizen Stan&quot;.

=== &quot;The Dead Father&quot; and &quot;Tales from the Gimli Hospital&quot; (1985â88) ===
Maddin&#x27;s first short film (as director, writer, producer, and cinematographer) was &quot;The Dead Father&quot;, a 25-minute black-and-white film about a young man whose father dies but continues to visit his family and disapprove of his son&#x27;s life. Its budget is estimated at CA$5,000 (). Maddin began shooting &quot;The Dead Father&quot; in 1982 and finished the film in 1985. Spurred by the work of Snyder and Paizs, and together with Harvie and Handford, Maddin decided to begin making films and founded a film company called &quot;Extra Large Productions&quot; (they first decided on the name &quot;Jumbo Productions&quot; and went to get a jumbo pizza to celebrate, but changed the name when the pizzeria in Gimli, Manitoba, only served &quot;extra large&quot; pizzas).

Maddin cast John Harvie in the lead role as the son, and University of Manitoba medical professor Dr. Dan P. Snidal as the dead father. &quot;The Dead Father&quot; (1985) was shot in black-and-white on sixteen-millimetre film. The style of the film owes much to the work of the Surrealists, with Maddin citing Luis BuÃ±uel and Man Ray as its main influences. Critics routinely cite, as an example of Maddin&#x27;s dream-like tone, the climactic scene of the film, where the son attempts to resolve his relationship with his dead father by uncovering his corpse (hidden to sleep at night in some nearby brush) and attempting to devour his father using a large spoonâsince the dead father awakens, the son cannot finish eating him and must instead pack his body away into a trunk in the family&#x27;s attic. Although Maddin did not feel that the film&#x27;s initial, Winnipeg premiere had gone well, John Paizs convinced him to submit the film to the Toronto Film Festival and the festival accepted the film. At the festival Maddin met Atom Egoyan, Jeremy Podeswa, Norman Jewison, and began to form connections with Canadian filmmakers across the national scene.

Maddin next began work on his feature film debut, &quot;Tales from the Gimli Hospital&quot; (1988), also shot in black-and-white on sixteen-millimetre film. Kyle McCulloch starred in the film as Einar, a lonely fisherman who contracts smallpox and begins to compete with another patient, Gunnar (played by Michael Gottli) for the attention of the young nurses. Maddin had himself endured a recent period of male rivalry and noticed that he found himself &quot;quite often forgetting the object of jealousy&quot; and instead becoming &quot;possessive of my rival&quot;. The film was originally titled &quot;Gimli Saga&quot; after the amateur history book produced locally by various Icelandic members of the community of Gimli (Maddin himself is Icelandic by ancestry).

Maddin&#x27;s aunt Lil had recently retired from hairdressing, and allowed Maddin to use her beauty salon (also Maddin&#x27;s childhood home) as a makeshift film studio (Lil appears in the film briefly as a &quot;bedside vigil-sitter in one quick shot [taken] just a couple of days before she died&quot; at the age of 85. After Maddin&#x27;s mother sold the house/studio, Maddin completed the remaining shots of the film at various locations, including his own home, over a period of eighteen months. Maddin received a grant from the Manitoba Arts Council for CA$20,000 (), and often cites that figure as the film&#x27;s budget, although he has also estimated the actual budget to have been between CA$14,000 and CA$30,000.

Although &quot;Tales from the Gimli Hospital&quot; upset some of the residents of Gimli, who believed that the film made light of the historical smallpox epidemic that ravaged the community, and was rejected by the Toronto Film Festival, it nevertheless became a cult success and established Maddin&#x27;s reputation in independent film circles. The film garnered the attention of Ben Barenholtz, who had successfully distributed other cult films such as the John Waters film &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; and David Lynch&#x27;s debut feature &quot;Eraserhead&quot;. &quot;Tales from the Gimli Hospital&quot; consequently succeeded on the festival circuit and screened for a full year as a midnight movie at a theatre in New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village. Maddin received a Genie award nomination for Best Original Screenplay.

=== &quot;Archangel&quot;, &quot;Careful&quot;, and &quot;Twilight of the Ice Nymphs&quot; (1989â97) ===
Having proven himself as a filmmaker and established a reputation outside of Canada, Maddin began work on a series of feature films produced on larger budgets and more traditional production schedules and processes. His second feature, &quot;Archangel&quot; (1990), fictionalizes in a general sense historical conflict related to the Bolshevik Revolution occurring in the Arkhangelsk (Archangel) region of Russia, a basic concept presented to Maddin by John Harvie. Boles, a Canadian soldier suffering from amnesia, arrives in the town of Archangel as World War I is ending (due to the Bolshevik uprising, it appears as if the townspeople have, like Boles, contracted amnesia and &quot;forgotten&quot; that the war is over). Boles confuses the warrior-woman Veronkha with his lost love Iris and pursues her throughout the fighting. Fellow &quot;drone&quot; Kyle McCulloch stars as Boles. The film marks Maddin&#x27;s first formal collaboration with fellow screenwriter George Toles.

Maddin shot &quot;Archangel&quot; in black-and-white, on 16Â mm film, on a budget of CA$430,000 (). Maddin modeled the film on the style of a part-talkie, an early cinema genre. Film critic J. Hoberman praised the film, and noted that such stylistic approaches were typical of Maddin&#x27;s growing body of work: &quot;Maddin&#x27;s most distinctive trait is an uncanny ability to exhume and redeploy forgotten cinematic conventions.&quot; &quot;Archangel&quot; premiered at the Toronto Film Festival, and in 1991 was awarded Best Experimental Film by the National Society of Film Critics.

Maddin&#x27;s third feature, &quot;Careful&quot; (1992), was styled after another early cinema genre, the German mountain picture (or Bergfilm) â a surprising choice, given that (as filmmaker Caelum Vatnsdal has noted), &quot;Winnipeg&#x27;s highest peak is, in fact, an artificial hill that had been created by laying sod over a garbage dump.&quot; Maddin was ordered by the producers to shoot in colour, and so &quot;Careful&quot; became Maddin&#x27;s first colour film, shot on 16Â mm film with a budget of CA$1.1 million (). the colour style of the film emulated the two colour Technicolor movies of the early 1930s. Kyle McCulloch again starred, alongside other Maddin regulars such as Brent Neale and Ross McMillan. At one point, Martin Scorsese had agreed to act in the film, as Count Knotkers, but bowed out to complete &quot;Cape Fear&quot;. Maddin pursued casting hockey star Bobby Hull, but ended up casting Paul Cox.

&quot;Careful,&quot; also cowritten by George Toles, is set in the mountain town of Tolzbad, where the townspeople are forced to repress their behaviour pathologically, since the slightest expression of emotion can trigger a devastating avalanche. Brothers Grigorss (McCulloch) and Johann (Neale) seem secure of bright futures as butlers, but Johann becomes incestuously obsessed with their widowed mother (driving him away from his fiancÃ© and towards a dramatic suicide). Grigorss, who is in love with Klara, begins to work for Count Knotkers, who also harbours love for Grigorss&#x27; mother. Klara convinces Grigorss to duel the Count, resulting in the death of his mother, Klara&#x27;s father, Klara, and finally Grigorss himself. &quot;Careful&quot; premiered at the New York Film Festival and, although it was not a commercial success elsewhere, &quot;single-handedly saved a struggling art-house cinema in Missoula, Montana&quot; where &quot;sell-out crowds had filled the house twice every night for two weeks&quot;.

For his next feature film, written by Toles, Maddin attempted to make an operetta called &quot;The Dikemaster&#x27;s Daughter&quot; &quot;set in a nineteenth-century Holland populated almost entirely by opera singers and dike-building navvies&quot; about &quot;a short-lived romance between the titular daughter and a fey opera singer&quot;. The singer is killed and the daughter is forced to marry a dike-builder who is also killed. A local alchemist then constructs an automaton copy of the latter, which the daughter succeeds in having implanted with two hearts (of both her opera singer love and her dike-builder husband) and a lever that switches control of the mechanical body between the two hearts. The movie was to feature Christopher Lee and Leni Riefenstahl, but Telefilm Canada &quot;declared the project a &#x27;lateral move&#x27;&quot; for Maddin and the movie could not secure enough funding, so was aborted.

Maddin consequently flirted with the idea of moving to Los Angeles to become a director-for-hire. He met with Claudia Lewis, who worked for Fox Searchlight, but Maddin found himself dispirited with the projects he was offered: &quot;I remember one was a love story set in a TB sanatorium. The only thing odd or bizarre about it was the very off-putting sight of people horking up blood and phlegm into little paper cups, and these paper cups would accumulate in volume until there were moonlit paper cups of phlegm floating on a lake, and it was supposed to be very beautiful, but it was nauseating. I&#x27;m making it sound better than it was, actually.&quot; Maddin also directed the TV film &quot;The Hands of Ida&quot; (which he &quot;later repudiated&quot;) and married Elise Moore in 1995 (the marriage ended in 1997), and directed the short film &quot;Odilon Redon, or The Eye Like a Strange Balloon Mounts Toward Infinity&quot; (which was commissioned by the BBC and won a Special Jury Citation at the Toronto International Film festival). In 1995, Maddin also became the youngest recipient ever of the Telluride Film Festival&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award.

Maddin&#x27;s fourth feature, also scripted by Toles and inspired by the novel &quot;Pan&quot; by Knut Hamsun, ended up being &quot;Twilight of the Ice Nymphs&quot; (1997), his second in colour and his first shot in 35Â mm, on a budget of CA$1.5 million (). Set in the fictional land of Mandragora, where the sun does not set, a newly released convict returns to his family&#x27;s ostrich farm and is embroiled in a host of romantic complications involving a heavy-breasted statue of Venus. &quot;Twilight of the Ice Nymphs&quot; featured Shelley Duvall and Frank Gorshin; The film&#x27;s star, Nigel Whitmey, had his name removed from the film&#x27;s credits after Maddin chose to remove Whitmey&#x27;s voice from the film and replace it with Ross McMillan&#x27;s.

As seen in Noam Gonick&#x27;s documentary &quot;Waiting for Twilight&quot;, Maddin was dissatisfied with the film-making process due to such creative interference from his producers, saying &quot;just close the mausoleum lid on me&quot; since he was possibly done making films. Maddin then entered a relatively &quot;fallow period&quot; although he continued to make short films, music videos (including the video for the song &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; by Sparklehorse), and advertisements.

=== &quot;The Heart of the World&quot;, &quot;Dracula: Pages from a Virgin&#x27;s Diary&quot;, &quot;The Saddest Music in the World&quot; (1998â2003) ===
During his break from making feature films, Maddin began teaching film classes at the University of Manitoba, where he met and encouraged the younger filmmaker Deco Dawson. After being impressed with Dawson&#x27;s short films, Maddin hired Dawson to work on a short film for the Toronto International Film Festival â Maddin was one of a number of directors (including Atom Egoyan and David Cronenberg) commissioned to make four-minute short films that would screen prior to the various feature films at the 2000 festival. After hearing rumours that other directors were planning films with a small number of shots, Maddin decided that his film would instead contain over a hundred shots per minute, and enough plot for a feature-length film. Maddin then wrote and shot &quot;The Heart of the World&quot; (2000) in the style of Russian constructivism, taking the commission at its literal face value, as a call to produce a propaganda film. The plot of &quot;The Heart of the World&quot; concerns two brothers, Osip and Nikolai, who compete for the love of the same woman: Anna, a state scientist studying Earth&#x27;s core. Anna discovers that the heart of the world is in danger of a fatal heart attack (which would mean the end of the world), and the brothers compete amongst the public panic. Nikolai is a mortician and tries to impress Anna with assembly-line embalming, while Osip is an actor playing Christ in the Passion Play and tries to impress Anna through his suffering. Anna is instead seduced by an evil capitalist, but has a change of heart and strangles the plutocrat, then slides down into the heart of the world, where she manages to save the world from destruction by transforming into cinema itself, the world&#x27;s &quot;new and better heart â Kino!&quot; &quot;The Heart of the World&quot; won a 2001 Genie Award for Best Short, and the 2001 U.S. National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Experimental Film (the same award Maddin had won in 1991 for &quot;Archangel&quot;).

The success of &quot;The Heart of the World&quot; marked the beginning of a productive period for Maddin, who produced five feature films within the following eight years. Maddin&#x27;s next feature deepened but also ended his collaboration with Deco Dawson, who was credited as &quot;Editor and Associate Director&quot; on &quot;&quot; (2002). Maddin and Dawson had a falling out in the wake of the production and have not worked together again (Dawson nevertheless spoke kindly of Maddin&#x27;s following feature, &quot;The Saddest Music in the World&quot;. &quot;Dracula: Pages from a Virgin&#x27;s Diary&quot; was budgeted at $1.7-million and produced for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) as a dance film documenting a performance by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet adapting Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel &quot;Dracula&quot;. Maddin elected to shoot the dance film in a fashion uncommon for such films, through close-ups and using jump cuts. Maddin also stayed close to the source material of Stoker&#x27;s novel, emphasizing the xenophobia in the reactions of the main characters to Dracula (played by Zhang Wei-Qiang in Maddin&#x27;s film). The resulting film was greeted with critical acclaim, with an 84% average rating on Metacritic and an 85% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert gave the film 3Â½ stars out of 4, writing that &quot;so many films are more or less alike that it&#x27;s jolting to see a film that deals with a familiar story, but looks like no other.&quot; &quot;Dracula: Pages from a Virgin&#x27;s Diary&quot; won first prize (Prague D&#x27;Or) at the 2002 Golden Prague Television Festival, two 2002 Gemini Awards for Best Canadian Performing Arts Show and Best Direction, and a 2002 International Emmy for Best Performing Arts. Originally a television feature, &quot;Dracula: Pages from a Virgin&#x27;s Diary&quot; was released theatrically in 2003.

Maddin&#x27;s next feature, &quot;The Saddest Music in the World&quot; (2003) was budgeted at $3.8-million (a large budget in Canadian terms) and shot over 24 days. The film was Maddin&#x27;s first collaboration with Isabella Rossellini, who subsequently appeared in a number of Maddin&#x27;s films, and cocreated a film with him about her father Roberto Rossellini. The film also starred Mark McKinney (of the comedy troupe Kids in the Hall), Maria de Medeiros, David Fox, and Ross McMillan. Maddin and cowriter Toles based the film on an original screenplay written by Booker Prize-winning novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, from which they kept &quot;the title, the premise and the contest â to determine which country&#x27;s music was the saddest&quot; but otherwise re-wrote. The action of &quot;The Saddest Music in the World&quot; centres around a contest run by Beer Baroness Lady Port-Huntley (Rossellini) to discover which country has the saddest music in the world. Chester Kent (McKinney), a failed Broadway producer, returns home to Winnipeg and competes with his father Fyodor (Fox) and brother Roderick (McMillan) to win the contest and its $25,000 prize. It&#x27;s discovered that Chester&#x27;s girlfriend, Narcissa (de Medeiros) was Roderick&#x27;s wife but forgot this due to amnesia resulting from the death of their son (Roderick keeps his son&#x27;s heart in a jar that travels with him). Chester reunites with Port-Huntley, his former lover, who lost her legs in a car accident. Fyodor, who is in love with Port-Huntley, has built prosthetic legs for her out of glass (and filled with beer), which she loves although she spurns Fyodor, leading to his drunken death. As the contest proceeds, things end tragically. &quot;The Saddest Music in the World&quot; won a number of awards, including three Genie Awards (Best Achievement in Costume Design, Best Achievement in Editing, and Best Achievement in Music, Original Score) and Maddin was also nominated for Best Achievement in Direction. Maddin received the same nomination from the Directors Guild of Canada, who awarded the film Outstanding Achievement in Production Design, Feature Film, and Maddin won the Film Discovery Jury Award for Best Director at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival.

=== &quot;Cowards Bend the Knee&quot;, &quot;Brand Upon the Brain!&quot;, &quot;My Winnipeg&quot; (2003â07) ===
While in pre-production on &quot;The Saddest Music in the World&quot;, Maddin directed &quot;Cowards Bend the Knee&quot; (2003), shooting entirely on Super-8mm film with a budget of $30,000. Developed as a series of short films, commissioned as part of an installation art project by Toronto art gallery The Power Plant that was curated by Philip Monk, these 10 short films, collected together, constituted a short feature, so that Maddin ended up completing and releasing two feature films in 2003. &quot;Cowards Bend the Knee&quot; is the first in Maddin&#x27;s &quot;autobiographical &#x27;Me Trilogy&#x27;&quot; of feature films starring protagonists named &quot;Guy Maddin&quot;, the second being &quot;Brand Upon the Brain!&quot; (2006) and &quot;My Winnipeg&quot; (2007). &quot;Cowards Bend the Knee&quot; concerns the murderous exploits of a young &quot;Guy Maddin&quot; (played by Darcy Fehr), a hockey player whose forgets his beloved as she dies through complications during an illegal abortion. Guy becomes entwined in a love affair with the daughter of the abortionist, who compels him to murder her mother to revenge the death of her father. Guy meanwhile falls in love with the ghost of his dead lover, not recognizing her, and competes with his own father for her affection. Maddin based the film&#x27;s premise loosely on the story &quot;The Hands of Ida&quot; and Euripedes&#x27;s play &quot;Medea&quot;. Critic J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called the film &quot;Maddin&#x27;s masterpiece&quot;, noting that the film &quot;not only plays like a dream but feels like one&quot;.

Maddin was next approached by the Seattle-based not-for-profit film production company called The Film Company and offered a budget to make any film he wanted, with complete freedom as long as he shot it in Seattle with local actors. Maddin ended up producing &quot;Brand Upon the Brain!&quot; (2006), from a script cowritten by Toles, shooting the film over nine days and editing it over three months with an estimated budget of $40,000. The plot concerns &quot;Guy Maddin&quot; (played by Erik Steffen Maahs as an adult, and Sullivan Brown as a child), whose domineering mother runs a lighthouse orphanage on an island where she and her husband perform scientific experiments upon the children in an effort to extend her youth. &quot;Brand Upon the Brain!&quot; was shot as a silent film, and premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival, where it was accompanied by a live orchestra, singer, an interlocutor (in the style of Japanese &quot;benshi&quot;), and Foley artists. The film was toured across North America in a similar fashion, with a host of celebrity narrators including Crispin Glover and John Ashbery. The film&#x27;s normal theatrical run featured narration by Isabella Rossellini. In 2006, Maddin was presented with two lifetime achievement awards, the Persistence of Vision Award from the San Francisco International Film Festival and the Manitoba Arts Council&#x27;s Award of Distinction. Roger Ebert wrote, of the film and Maddin&#x27;s work in general, that &quot;For me, Maddin seems to penetrate to the hidden layers beneath the surface of the movies, revealing a surrealistic underworld of fears, fantasies and obsessions.&quot;

Maddin&#x27;s next feature stemmed from a commission to produce a documentary film about his hometown of Winnipeg, for which Maddin&#x27;s producer directed &quot;Don&#x27;t give me the frozen hellhole everyone knows that Winnipeg is.&quot; Taking what he described as a &quot;docufantasia&quot; approach that melded &quot;personal history, civic tragedy, and mystical hypothesizing&quot;, Maddin produced &quot;My Winnipeg&quot; (2008), with a budget of $500,000. Maddin re-cast Darcy Fehr in the role of &quot;Guy Maddin&quot; and structured the documentary around a metafictional plot whereby &quot;Guy Maddin&quot; attempts to &quot;film his way out&quot; of the frozen city. Maddin rents out his former home and hires actors to play his family (including Ann Savage as his mother) in the recreation of pivotal scenes from his memories of youth. Along the way, Maddin documents facts, rumours, and fabricated myths about Winnipeg, including the demolition of the Winnipeg hockey arena (during the period after the sale of the Winnipeg Jets had left the city without a national hockey team), an epidemic of sleepwalking, the ghosts of frozen horse heads returning every winter when the rivers freeze over, and If Day (an actual historical event when a faked Nazi invasion of the city was mounted during World War II to promote the sale of war bonds). &quot;My Winnipeg&quot; received the award for Best Canadian Feature Film from the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, Best Documentary from the 2008 San Francisco Film Critics Circle Awards, Best Canadian Film from the 2008 Toronto Film Critics Association Awards, and Best Experimental Documentary from the 2009 International Urban Film Festival, Tehran. In 2007, Maddin also became the first artist-curator of the UCLA Film and Television Archive.

=== &quot;Keyhole&quot;, &quot;Hauntings&quot;, &quot;Seances&quot;, &quot;The Forbidden Room&quot; and &quot;The Green Fog&quot; (2008â2017) ===
Maddin soon received two other career awards, the Filmmaker on the Edge Award at the 2009 Provincetown International Film Festival and the 2010 Canada Council for the Arts Bell Award in Video Art for lifetime achievement in the field. Maddin then returned to installation art with a commission to celebrate the opening of the Bell Lightbox cultural centre in Toronto, producing an installation series titled &quot;Hauntings&quot; based on the concept of reimagining lost films from the silent film era that are known to have existed or been planned by influential filmmakers, but either destroyed or not produced. In December 2010, Maddin married the L.A. film critic Kim Morgan, and they separated in 2014.

Maddin shot his tenth feature film, &quot;Keyhole&quot; (2011), digitally rather than his usual method of shooting on sixteen-millimetre or Super-8. Filming began in Winnipeg on July 6, 2010. The film screened at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and the 2011 Whistler Film Festival, where it won the Best Canadian Film Award. In 2012, &quot;Keyhole&quot; screened at the South by Southwest Film Festival, the Independent Film Festival of Boston, the Wisconsin Film Festival, Fantasporto, and the Berlin International Film Festival. The film was released theatrically in 2012. &quot;Keyhole&quot; stars Jason Patric as Ulysses Pick, a gangster who leads his gang to break into his former home and odysseys through the haunted house (in a plot inspired by Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;), searching room-by-room to find his wife Hyacinth Isabella Rossellini. The film was cowritten by Maddin and Toles and also stars Udo Kier, Brooke Palsson, David Wontner, Louis Negin, and Kevin McDonald from the comedy troupe Kids in the Hall.

Also in 2011, Maddin participated in Performa 11 with &quot;Tales from the Gimli Hospital: Reframed&quot; &quot;,&quot; an ambitious live performance that reframes the original 1988 film. Maddin and the composer Matthew Patton gathered a group of musicians to compose and perform the new score which centered on Icelandic musician KristÃ­n Anna ValtÃ½sdÃ³ttir.

In 2012, Maddin produced another installation for the Winnipeg Art Gallery, &quot;Only Dream Things&quot;, for which he recreated his childhood bedroom and produced a short film by manipulating his family&#x27;s home movies.

Maddin expanded the approach of his &quot;Hauntings&quot; installation into another film/installation project, &quot;Seances&quot;, which combines &quot;a film shoot, an experience and an installation, which will subsequently become an interactive work&quot;. Maddin started shooting &quot;Seances&quot; in 2012 in Paris, France at the Centre Georges Pompidou and continued shooting at the Phi Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The film shoots themselves were presented as art installation projects, during which Maddin, along with the cast and crew, held a &quot;sÃ©ance&quot; during which Maddin &quot;invite[d] the spirit of a lost photoplay to possess them&quot;. &quot;Seances&quot; will be launched online by the National Film Board of Canada in 2015, in an interactive web project that allows users to randomly generate a combination of the 100 short films, &quot;connected together into a paranormally eerie, semi-coherent whole.&quot; The number of films will ensure &quot;hundreds of billions of unique permutations&quot;.

Maddin and Evan Johnson also co-directed and shot, concurrently, a feature film titled &quot;The Forbidden Room&quot;, with the same writers. Although often misreported as the same project, &quot;The Forbidden Room&quot; &quot;is a feature film with its own separate story and stars&quot; while &quot;&quot;Seances&quot; will be an interactive Internet project.&quot; &quot;The Forbidden Room&quot; is Maddin&#x27;s eleventh feature film, with its world premiere in January 2015 at the Sundance Film Festival.

Maddin&#x27;s next feature film, &quot;The Green Fog&quot; (2017), premiered at the San Francisco International Film Festival on April 16, 2017. The film features a score by composer Jacob Garchik, performed by Kronos Quartet, and is a collage-film, &quot;a scene-by-scene reimagining of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo&quot; Bay Area film footage from a variety of sources â &#x27;50s noir, experimental films, &#x27;70s prime-time TV, and more.&quot;

== Installations ==
Guy Maddin has cultivated a career as an installation artist alongside his film-making career. Maddin&#x27;s installations generally include short films screened in unusual fashions, and tend to draw on both his autobiography and on the history of cinema.

=== &quot;Cowards Bend the Knee&quot; (2003) ===
Maddin was commissioned by The Power Plant gallery in Toronto and, in an installation curated by Philip Monk, produced a series of ten short films. The exhibition premiered at the 42nd International Film Festival Rotterdam from January 22 to February 2, 2003, where the catalogue described it as &quot;A firstofitskind, tenpart peephole installation jampacked with enough kinetically photographed action to seem like a neverending cliffhanger.&quot; Each six-minute film is viewed through a peephole and together present a fictionalised autobiography, whose main character (named &quot;Guy Maddin&quot;) is embroiled in illegal abortion, murderous intrigue, sexual rivalry, and hockey. The installation was also exhibited at The Power Plant Contemporary Art Gallery in Toronto from March 22 to May 25, 2003. A literary screenplay for the film was also published by the gallery, and the short films were collected together as a feature film (released theatrically and to DVD).

=== &quot;Hauntings&quot; (2010) ===
Maddin was commissioned to produce an installation for the opening of the Toronto International Film Festival&#x27;s Bell Lightbox, a cultural centre and skyscraper, and configured eleven screens to show a series of original short films. The films consisted of reimagined &quot;lost&quot; films by famous directors that have been lost, destroyed or unrealized. Maddin stated in the press that &quot;I&#x27;ve been literally haunted by the idea that there are these really intriguing titles by some of my favourite filmmakers that I&#x27;d never get to see [... and] I told myself years ago that the only way I&#x27;d get to see any version of these is if I made the adaptation myself.&quot; The installation was also exhibited at Winnipeg&#x27;s Platform Gallery from September 2 to October 2, 2011, for the WNDX Festival of Moving Image and at Concordia University&#x27;s FOFA (Faculty of Fine Arts) Gallery from June 1â10, 2012.

=== &quot;Only Dream Things&quot; (2012) ===
For a 2012 installation at the Winnipeg Art Gallery, Maddin re-created his teenage bedroom. On the wall of the re-created bedroom screens a 19-minute short film Maddin produced by digitally distressing his family&#x27;s home movies.

=== &quot;Seances&quot; (2012â2015) ===
Expanding the approach of his &quot;Hauntings&quot; installation, Maddin&#x27;s ongoing film/installation project, Seances. The film shoots were open to the public and streamed online, and thereby presented as live art installation projects, during which Maddin, along with the cast and crew, held a sÃ©ance &quot;invit[ing] the spirit of a lost photoplay to possess them&quot;. The cameras used to record the shoots also live-streams their video online. Other writers on the project include Evan Johnson, Robert Kotyk, film critic Kim Morgan, and US poet John Ashbery. In 2015, the Maddin and National Film Board of Canada will release &quot;&quot;Seances&quot; [as] an interactive Internet project&quot;.

== Books by Maddin ==
Guy Maddin is also an author, and has published three books, two of which are literary companions to his feature films.

=== &quot;From the Atelier Tovar: Selecting Writings&quot; (2003) ===
Guy Maddin&#x27;s first book (followed the same year by &quot;Cowards Bend the Knee&quot;) contains selected &quot;journalism, treatments for films made and unmade and [. . .] selection[s] from the director&#x27;s [. . .] personal journals&quot; and also &quot;candid photos and unpublished storyboards&quot;. The book is introduced by film critic Mark Peranson and published by Coach House Books.

Maddin&#x27;s journalism features reviews of a variety of films, from &quot;Minority Report&quot; to &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot;, an article on the making of Maddin&#x27;s feature &quot;The Saddest Music in the World&quot;, and writing on Bollywood melodramas. The book contains four film treatments, for the short films &quot;The Eye, Like a Strange Balloon, Mounts Towards Infinity&quot;, &quot;Maldoror:Tygers&quot;, and the feature film &quot;Careful&quot;. The longest treatment is for an unmade film called &quot;The Child Without Qualities&quot;, an autobiographical work that reads like an experimental short story. This unfinished short film&#x27;s title alludes to the title of Robert Musil&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;The Man Without Qualities&quot;.

=== &quot;Cowards Bend the Knee&quot; (2003) ===
Guy Maddin wrote a lengthy treatment for the feature film &quot;Cowards Bend the Knee&quot;, which he published as a book through The Power Plant, the public art gallery in Toronto that commissioned the installation art show that both served as Maddin&#x27;s first major foray as an installation artist and for which Maddin produced the series of film &quot;chapters&quot; that collectively make up the feature film.

The book contains a foreword by Wayne Baerwaldt (then-Director of The Power Plant) and an introduction by Philip Monk, who also edited the book and curated Maddin&#x27;s installation. The main text is followed by an interview with Guy Maddin conducted by Robert Enright. The book also contains stills from the film and a list of credits for the film.

Most of the text is Maddin&#x27;s treatment for the film, which follows the same plot. In the words of Baerwaldt, the story is a fictional &quot;autobiography [that] features a diabolical plot surrounding a coward on a mission [named Guy Maddin] that resembles a cycle of dark spectacles dressed up as, among other things, lewd seduction, Canadian hockey, murder, amputations, hair design, general mayhem, fetish attractions and heartfelt loss.&quot;

In the interview with Enright, Maddin notes that the book&#x27;s genesis began with Maddin&#x27;s intention to clarify the narrative of his films, since &quot;it is a source of continuing frustration that people would say --- and it was always a compliment --- we really like your films, they&#x27;re so non-narrative. So I thought, damnit, I&#x27;m going to get a story that people are going to recognize, something that has legs. I started reading Greek tragedy, &quot;Electra&quot;, &quot;Medea&quot; and stuff like that, and basically I just took some premises from these super-durable stories. The things I end up layering around these rock-solid premises are invariably pure autobiography [. . .] once I slipped away what little remained of Euripides, what was left was some core sample of me.&quot;

Maddin&#x27;s book treatment is written in a highly literary fashion that is not typical of screen treatments, so that the text reads like a literary work rather than a blueprint for the film: &quot;It is the night before the [Winnipeg] Maroons&#x27; first game against the Soviets. Meta and Guy lie in bed, in the midst of a particularly spectacular recital of what could be called THE LIMBO-DANCE OF SELF-PITY --- a verbal choreography performed by lovers who manipulate each other through complicated displays of insincere self-loathing. Participants enter the Limbo in hopes of restructuring the unspoken terms of their relationship.&quot;

=== &quot;My Winnipeg&quot; (2009) ===
Guy Maddin also released a book titled &quot;My Winnipeg&quot; (Coach House Books, 2009). Maddin&#x27;s book contains the film&#x27;s narration as a main text surrounded by annotations, including outtakes, marginal notes and digressions, production stills, family photos, and miscellaneous material.

The book contains a &quot;Winnipeg Map&quot; by artist Marcel Dzama featuring such fictional attractions as &quot;The Giant Squid of the Red [River]&quot;, various poster designs for the film, and short articles about working with Maddin by Andy Smetanka, Darcy Fehr, and Caelum Vatnsdal. Maddin also includes an angry e-mail from an ex-girlfriend, collages and notebooks pages, and an X-ray of the dog Spanky from the film.

The book also includes an interview with Maddin&#x27;s mother Herdis, conducted by Ann Savage, and an interview with Maddin conducted by Michael Ondaatje.

== Books about Maddin ==
Maddin&#x27;s work has been the subject of critical attention, including the following substantive (book-length) works.

=== William Beard: &quot;Into the Past: The Cinema of Guy Maddin&quot; ===
William Beard, a professor in the Department of English and Film Studies at the University of Alberta, authored a critical book focused on Maddin&#x27;s work up until 2010, focusing chapter-by-chapter on Maddin&#x27;s feature films and also discussing his short film work. Beard previously published books focused on filmmakers Clint Eastwood and David Cronenberg.

=== David Church: &quot;Playing with Memories: Essays on Guy Maddin&quot; ===
David Church, a film historian affiliated with Indiana University, edited a collection of essays about Maddin&#x27;s work through 2009. The book contains both new and previously published essays by critics and scholars, including William Beard, Dana Cooley, Donald Masterson, David L. Pike, Steven Shaviro, Will Straw, Saige Walton, and others. Essays by several of Maddin&#x27;s friends and collaborators, including George Toles, Stephen Snyder, and Carl Matheson, are also included.

=== D.K. Holm: &quot;Guy Maddin: Interviews&quot; ===
D. K. Holm edited a collection of interviews with Maddin, selected from various sources, including the more comprehensive interview book by Vatnsdal. Holm also selects excerpts from Maddin&#x27;s DVD commentaries.

=== Caelum Vatnsdal: &quot;Kino Delirium: The Films of Guy Maddin&quot; ===
Caelum Vatnsdal, a director, producer, author, and actor (who has appeared in a number of Maddin&#x27;s films, most notably in The Heart of the World), published a book of interviews with Maddin discussing his filmography film-by-film (the book covers Maddin&#x27;s career up to 2000).

=== Darren Wershler: &quot;Guy Maddin&#x27;s My Winnipeg&quot; ===
Darren Wershler, a Canadian avant-garde poet, critic, and full Professor in the Department of English at Concordia University, has published an academic monograph on &quot;My Winnipeg&quot;. This book-length work contextualizes the film in relation to avant-garde literature and art by drawing on media and cultural theory. In Wershler&#x27;s words, &quot;I argue that Maddin&#x27;s use of techniques and media falls outside of the normal repertoire of contemporary cinema, which requires us to re-examine what we think we know about the documentary genre and even &#x27;film&#x27; itself. Through an exploration of the film&#x27;s major thematic concerns â memory, the cultural archive, and how people and objects circulate through the space of the city â I contend that &quot;My Winnipeg&quot; is intriguing because it is psychologically and affectively true without being historically accurate.&quot; In the context of its Canadian production, &quot;My Winnipeg&quot;&#x27;s difference from the documentary genre also marks the film as distinct from the work historically advanced by the National Film Board of Canada. Maddin has called &quot;My Winnipeg&quot; a &quot;docu-fantasia&quot; and Wershler similarly points out that the film&#x27;s &quot;truth&quot; lies somewhere &quot;in the irresolvable tension created by the gap between documentary and melodrama&quot;.

<text>Erosion (usually represented by â) is one of two fundamental operations (the other being dilation) in morphological image processing from which all other morphological operations are based. It was originally defined for binary images, later being extended to grayscale images, and subsequently to complete lattices. The erosion operation usually uses a structuring element for probing and reducing the shapes contained in the input image.

== Binary erosion ==

In binary morphology, an image is viewed as a subset of a Euclidean space formula_1 or the integer grid formula_2, for some dimension &quot;d&quot;.

The basic idea in binary morphology is to probe an image with a simple, pre-defined shape, drawing conclusions on how this shape fits or misses the shapes in the image. This simple &quot;probe&quot; is called structuring element, and is itself a binary image (i.e., a subset of the space or grid).

Let &quot;E&quot; be a Euclidean space or an integer grid, and &quot;A&quot; a binary image in &quot;E&quot;.
The erosion of the binary image &quot;A&quot; by the structuring element &quot;B&quot; is defined by:
:formula_3,
where &quot;B&quot;&quot;z&quot; is the translation of &quot;B&quot; by the vector z, i.e., formula_4, formula_5.

When the structuring element &quot;B&quot; has a center (e.g., a disk or a square), and this center is located on the origin of &quot;E&quot;, then the erosion of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;B&quot; can be understood as the locus of points reached by the center of &quot;B&quot; when &quot;B&quot; moves inside &quot;A&quot;. For example, the erosion of a square of side 10, centered at the origin, by a disc of radius 2, also centered at the origin, is a square of side 6 centered at the origin.

The erosion of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;B&quot; is also given by the expression: formula_6, where &quot;Aâb&quot; denotes the translation of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;-b&quot;.

This is more generally also known as a Minkowski difference.

=== Example ===

Suppose A is a 13 x 13 matrix and B is a 3 x 3 matrix:

 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Assuming that the origin B is at its center, for each pixel in A superimpose the origin of B, if B is completely contained by A the pixel is retained, else deleted.

Therefore the Erosion of A by B is given by this 13 x 13 matrix.
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0
 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0
 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 
 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 
 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 
 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
This means that only when B is completely contained inside A that the pixels values are retained, otherwise it gets deleted or eroded.

===Properties===

* The erosion is translation invariant.
* It is increasing, that is, if formula_7, then formula_8.
* If the origin of &quot;E&quot; belongs to the structuring element &quot;B&quot;, then the erosion is &quot;anti-extensive&quot;, i.e., formula_9.
* The erosion satisfies formula_10, where formula_11 denotes the morphological dilation.
* The erosion is distributive over set intersection

==Grayscale erosion==

In grayscale morphology, images are functions mapping a Euclidean space or grid &quot;E&quot; into formula_12, where formula_13 is the set of reals, formula_14 is an element larger than any real number, and formula_15 is an element smaller than any real number.

Denoting an image by &quot;f(x)&quot; and the grayscale structuring element by &quot;b(x)&quot;, where B is the space that b(x) is defined, the grayscale erosion of &quot;f&quot; by &quot;b&quot; is given by

::formula_16,

where &quot;inf&quot; denotes the infimum.

In other words the erosion of a point is the minimum of the points in its neighborhood, with that neighborhood defined by the structuring element. In this way it is similar to many other kinds of image filters like the median filter and the gaussian filter.

==Erosions on complete lattices==

Complete lattices are partially ordered sets, where every subset has an infimum and a supremum. In particular, it contains a least element and a greatest element (also denoted &quot;universe&quot;).

Let formula_17 be a complete lattice, with infimum and supremum symbolized by formula_18 and formula_19, respectively. Its universe and least element are symbolized by &quot;U&quot; and formula_20, respectively. Moreover, let formula_21 be a collection of elements from &quot;L&quot;.

An erosion in formula_17 is any operator formula_23 that distributes over the infimum, and preserves the universe. I.e.:
* formula_24,
* formula_25.

<text>White Horse Temple () is a Buddhist temple in Luoyang, Henan that, according to tradition, is the first Buddhist temple in China, having been first established in 68 AD under the patronage of Emperor Ming in the Eastern Han dynasty.

The site is just outside the walls of the ancient Eastern Han capital, some east of Luoyang in Henan Province. It is approximately 40 minutes by bus No. 56 from Luoyang railway station. The temple, although small in comparison to many others in China, is considered by most believers as &quot;the cradle of Chinese Buddhism&quot;. The geographical landmarks to the south are Manghan mountain and Lucoche River.

The main temple buildings, a large complex, were reconstructed during the Ming (1368 to 1644) and Qing (1644 to 1912) dynasties. They were refurbished in the 1950s, and again in March 1973 after the Cultural Revolution. It has numerous halls divided by courtyards and manicured gardens, covering an area of about . The display plaques in Chinese and English give ample descriptions of the Buddhist deities installed in the halls. Significant statues include ÅÄkyamuni Buddha, Maitreya (the laughing Buddha in China), AmitÄbha, the Jade Buddha, Bodhisattvas such as Guanyin, and arhats and stone statues of the two white horses which brought the Indian monks to China and two mythical lions at the entrance. Under international funding, the temple has undergone many changes, both structurally and internally. The most recent cooperative project, with India, was completed in 2008 when the Sanchi Stupa and the Sarnath Buddha statue were erected.

==Etymology==

On arrival of the two monks from India, they were housed in the temple. This temple was called the &quot;White Horse Temple&quot; (), where means &quot;white&quot;, means &quot;horse&quot;, and means &quot;shrine, temple, monastery&quot;.

Notably, the emperor ordered the suffix () to be used in the temple&#x27;s name, as a display of respect. This character had been used to denote the ministries of the government. In later periods, all temples, even mosques, came to use this character in their name and it was dropped from the names of government ministries. As a result, the temple&#x27;s name is sometimes translated as &quot;White Horse Ministry&quot;, a translation true to the time. &quot;White Horse Temple&quot; is the modern, literal reading.

However, this may be a folk etymology as there were other early temples in different centres with the same name. The monk Zhidun (or Chih Tun) (314â366), who was a famous propagator of Buddhism in the southern capital is recorded as having discussions with Fenghui at the Baima si (Pai ma) monastery in Jiankang (previously Jianye), the capital of the Eastern Jin (317-420). There was also a Baima si at Xiangyang where Daoan and his disciples stayed . To further complicate the search for the origin of the name, there were peoples known as the &#x27;White Horse Qiang&#x27; and &#x27;Di&#x27; who lived in the &#x27;White Horse Valley&#x27; on the upper reaches of the Min River, which flows south from the Min Mountains near the town of Zhangla ([Chang-la]: 32.50Â° N, 103.40Â° E) and there are still people calling themselves the &#x27;White Horse Di&#x27; living there. It is possible, but unprovable, that the name Baima derived from some of these peoples, who may have been influenced by Buddhism at an early period, rather than from literal white horse(s) carrying scriptures.

==Background, legends and importance==
Here are several forms of the legends relating to the foundation and naming of the temple:

:Following Emperor Ming&#x27;s dream vision about a Buddha who established Buddhism, two of Ming&#x27;s emissaries departed to search for Buddhist scriptures. They encountered two Indian Buddhist monks in Central India and persuaded them to join them and return to China, bringing their book of Buddhist scriptures, relics and statues of Buddha with them on two white horses. Pleased with their arrival in China, the king built a temple in their honour and named it the &quot;White Horse Temple&quot; or &quot;Baima Temple&quot;, as an appreciation of the white horses that had carried the monks. The monks resided at the new temple and here they translated the Buddhist scriptures into the Chinese language. The Buddhist religion prospered from here and with the arrival of Bodhidarma, another monk from South India in the 5th century, Chinese Buddhism evolved, spreading to other countries.

:At the invitation of the Chinese Emperor Ming Di, two Indian monks named Kasyapa Matanga and Dharmaratna or Gobharana, translated the Buddhist classics at the Baima Temple at Luo Yang, which was then the nationâs capital. They translated many scriptures, the notable of these was the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters (), which was translated by Matanga. This was the first Buddhist sutra in Chinese and has the pride of place in the history of Chinese Buddhism. Gobharana translated the &#x27;Dasa Bhumi&#x27; or the &#x27;Ten stages of Perfection&#x27;, apart from five others. The temple then increased in importance as Buddhism grew within China and spread to Korea, Japan and Vietnam. The introduction of Buddhism in China was a significant influence on Chinese morals, thought and ethics.

:The temple&#x27;s story begins with the dream of Emperor Mingdi and his establishing the temple in 68 AD honouring the two Indian monks and the white horses that brought them to China with Buddhist scriptures. The two monks translated many scriptures while living in the temple, which was named as White Horse Temple. They died in the temple precincts and are buried in the first courtyard of the temple. Following the establishment of the temple, 1000 monks lived here practicing Buddhism.

According to &#x27;The Chapter on the Western Regions&#x27; of the &quot;Hou Hanshu&quot; (&quot;Book of Later Han&quot;), which was based on a report to the Emperor , but was not compiled until the 5th century: 
:&quot;Tradition is that Emperor Ming dreamt that he saw a tall golden man the top of whose head was glowing. He questioned his group of advisers and one of them said: &quot;In the West there is a god called Buddha. His body is sixteen &quot;chi&quot; tall [], and is the colour of gold.&quot; That is why the Emperor sent envoys to Tianzhu [South or Central India] to inquire about the Buddhaâs doctrine, after which paintings and statues [of the Buddha] appeared in the Middle Kingdom.&quot;

There are differing accounts explaining how the temple was established. Yang HsÃ¼an-chih says in the preface to his book, &quot;A Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Lo-yang&quot; (completed &quot;c&quot;. 547 CE), that, after his dream, Emperor Ming ordered that statues of the Buddha be erected at the [K&#x27;ai-]yang Gate (Opening to the Morning Sun Gate) of the Southern Palace and on near the [Ch&#x27;ang]yeh Terrace (The Eternal Night Terrace). He, however, makes no mention of the temple.

The Emperor is said to have sent a monk or monks to India or Scythia who returned carrying the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters on a white horse. The Sutra was received by the Emperor and housed in a temple built outside the walls of Luo Yang. It was China&#x27;s first Buddhist temple.

Other versions mentioned in the book &quot;Indian Pandits in the Land of Snow&quot; by Sri Sarat Chandra give the following legendary versions:

The legends related to this temple have direct link to the emergence and spread of Buddhism in China. Two visions are stated in this context.

The first vision was witnessed by Chow Wang, the fifth ruler of the Tang dynasty. The Emperor saw, in the southwestern region of China, a very bright light in the sky, like a halo or aureola from the west which lit the whole space. The astrologers of his court predicted that a saint was born in that quarter of the world where he saw the bright halo light. It was also prophesied that the religion practised by the saintly person, would spread to China. This was recorded by the king in his royal register. This year happened to be the year when Gautam Buddha was born in Nepal. 

The second vision happened at Luo Yang during the reign of Mingdi, the second emperor of the Eastern Han dynasty. In 60 CE, on an auspicious day, the Emperor had a vision (dream) of a saintly person of golden complexion with the Sun and the Moon shining behind his back came near his throne from the heavens and then circled his palace. This incident was correlated with the ancient recorded version and the events were interpreted to mean that the period prophesied in the past, of Buddhism coming to China, was now. History chronicler Fu Hi interpreted this vision as that of the divine person known as Buddha who was born in a place to the west of China in India. Emperor Mingdi forthwith selected emissaries named Taai Yin, Tain King, Wangtrun and others, in all 18 people, to go toward the west to India in search of the religion practiced by Buddha. After travelling through several countries bordering India such as Getse and Yuchi (the Saka Tartars), they reached (Gandhara country) where they met two Buddhist monks (Arhats) named Kasyapa Pandita (a Brahmin from Central India) and Bharana Pandita from South India. They accepted the invitation of the emissaries to go to China. They then proceeded to China on two white horses accompanied by the emissaries. They carried with them a few sacred texts of sutras â the &quot;Sutra of Forty-two Chapters&quot; â statues of Buddha, portraits and sacred relics. They reached Lou Yang where they were put up in a temple. The king met them in 67 CE, with due reverence and was pleased with the presents the monks had brought for him. It was the 30th day in the 12th month of Chinese calendar. The Emperor was particularly happy with the Buddha image which had striking similarity to the one he had seen in his dream vision. At this time, the monks performed some miracles, which further strengthened the belief of the Emperor in Buddhism.
However, some Taoist priests protested and wanted the Emperor to test the merits of both parties. The Emperor agreed and convened a meeting at the southern gate of the White Horse Temple. He ordered that the sacred texts and religious paraphernalia of the Taoists be placed on the eastern gate and the sacred texts, relics and Buddha image of the westerners in the hall of seven gems on the west. He then ordered that the objects be thrown into the fire, and whichever documents survived the fire then that religion would receive his patronage. The Taoists expected that their texts would survive. This did not happen as all the texts of Taoists were burnt and that of the Buddhists from the west survived. With this test, the Emperor was convinced of the Buddhist religion. He with all his entourage of ministers and kinsmen embraced Buddhism. He built several temples, which included &#x27;Pai-masai&#x27;, the White Horse Temple and three convents for nuns.

Now that there are many contradictory versions of this story, most modern scholars accept it as a Buddhist fable and not a valid historical event. The White Horse Temple is not recorded in contemporary sources before 289. However, there is a Poma si mentioned in Chang&#x27;an in 266 and another of the same name at Jingcheng in central Hubei at about the same date.

It is said that the next year, the Emperor ordered the construction of the White Horse Temple on the south side of the Imperial Drive three &quot;li&quot; outside the Hsi-yang Gate of the capital Luoyang, to remember the horse that carried back the sutras. After the death of the Emperor a meditation hall was built on his tomb. In front of the stupa luxuriant pomegranate and grape vines were grown which were said to be larger than those elsewhere.

Buddhism evolved in China after arriving from India, as a blend of Chinese beliefs and needs, particularly in respect of its folk heritage. It is Mahayana Buddhism practice, which is widely followed even though the Theravada or Hinayana came to China first.

==History==
===Early history===
In 258 a royal Kuchean monk, Po-Yen, translated six Buddhist texts into Chinese at the temple, including the important &quot;Infinite Life Sutra&quot;.
The famous Indo-Scythian Buddhist translator Dharmaraká¹£a (), active ca. 266â308 CE, came to Luoyang in 266 and resided at the White Horse Temple from at least the spring of 289 to 290 CE.

Furthermore, the renowned monk Xuanzang of the Tang dynasty, who spent 16 years on a pilgrimage to India (630â635 CE) as a result of his desire to visit the Buddha&#x27;s homeland, started his pilgrimage from this temple. On his return, Xuanzang remained the abbot of the White Horse Temple until his death. During his stay, apart from his teaching duties and other religious activities at the temple, he translated many Buddhist scriptures that he had brought from India, skillfully rendering Sanskrit into Chinese.

In 1175, an inscription on a stone tablet next to Qilun Pagodaâa tall, multi-eaved square-based tower to the southeast of the White Horse Templeâstated that a fire occurred five decades previously and destroyed the temple and the Sakya Tathagata sarira stupa, a predecessor to the pagoda. The same inscription of 1175 stated that a Jin official had the stone Qilun Pagoda erected soon after. The pagoda is built with the design style imitating the square-based pagodas of the Tang dynasty.

Between the 13th century and the 20th century, the temple underwent restoration/renovation under the Ming dynasty (1368â1644) and the Qing dynasty (1644â1911). Significant restoration took place in the 16th century and some buildings date to this period, although some have since been renovated.

===Modern history===

Under the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the temple has seen many renovations in the period between 1952 and 1973 following the Cultural Revolution. The Cultural Revolution had left the temple ravaged and emptied of relics, with many buildings burnt down.

In 1973, Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia visited the temple. Cambodia was a communist ally of China and Prince Sihanouk was staying in a palatial residence in Beijing. He was permitted to visit parts of the country on a tour for propaganda purposes, to show to the outside world that all was normal within China. As an ardent Buddhist, Sihanouk expressed a wish to Premier Zhou Enlai to visit the White Horse Temple. This put the administration into a frenzy, since many parts of the temple had been damaged during the Cultural Revolution and items were missing. Post haste, 2900 artefacts, which were in other palaces and museums in China, such as the Palace of Benevolent Tranquillity on the western side of the Forbidden City and statues in the Arhat Hall (&quot;Luohan Tang&quot;) of the Temple of Azure Clouds in Beijing&#x27;s Fragrant Hills were secretly shifted to the temple, and the White Horse Temple was fully restored. The newly restored temple impressed the Cambodians, who were oblivious to the events that had gutted the temple. The shift of artefacts to this temple was announced as permanent by Premier Zhou Enlai when the original owners wanted the artefacts to be returned.

In 1992, with the assistance of Thai and Chinese donors, the Hall of the Thai Buddha was constructed slightly west of the old temple.

====India-China cultural cooperation====
The symbolic importance of the temple for the ancient cultural relations between China and India was demonstrated when the Prime Minister of India P.V. Narasimha Rao visited the temple in 1993. A decade later, in 2003, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee also visited the temple.

To enhance the Buddhist cultural links between India and China, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed on 11 April 2005. It stipulated that India would build an Indian-style Buddhist temple to the west side of the White Horse Temple, in the International Garden of the complex. Under this agreement, India was to provide the architectural design, material for construction, the Buddha statue, landscaping and technical advice from architects and experts during construction. Chinese authorities were to allot a piece of land of .

Following the MOU, a Buddhist shrine that is a close replica of the Sanchi Stupa was completed in 2008. Its presence in the precincts of China&#x27;s first temple was inspired by Buddhist saints from India. The architectural features of the new temple closely recreate those of Sanchi&#x27;s Stupa, including Sanchi&#x27;s east gate. An image of the Buddha was transported from India and consecrated in the new temple, in conformity with the Indian Buddhist tradition. It is worth noticing that this temple was built on land donated by the Chinese government. The shrine is a two-storied structure with circular walls on both floors. Its circular walls are embellished with murals of scenes from the Jataka tales and the life of Buddha. The temple was executed in close co-ordination with the Indian design experts selected for the project, and Architects Akshaya Jain &amp; Kshitij Jain made several visits to the site in relation with their work as consultants.

The Buddha statue was designed following the pattern of the 5th-century image of the Buddha kept at Sarnath, and it has been consecrated in the temple&#x27;s central congressional hall. The president of India, Pratibha Patil, inaugurated this temple on May 27, 2010. The new temple incorporates features from the most revered Indian Buddhist shrines of Sanchi and Sarnath.

==Architecture==
The temple faces south and is aligned along a central axis starting from the entrance gate followed by several halls and courtyards in succession. The temple compound covers an area of 200 mu () and faces south. A stone paifang (archway), a three-door covered archway, has been recently built, in front of the original gate. The stone horses at the front of the temple are in the Ming architectural style, representing the white horses which carried the scriptures and the Indian monks to China. Between the archway and gate lies a pool with fountains, crossed by three stone bridges. The two horses at the entrance gate facing each other are made of green stone dated to the Song dynasty (960â1279).

Entering the temple today, plaques (in English and Chinese) and signposts are seen, which guide the visitors and pilgrims through the halls. The plaques briefly explain the statues in each hall. The halls are discerned in the inscriptions on the plaques, include the &#x27;Hall of Greetings&#x27;, &#x27;Hall of Six Foundersâ, &#x27;Hall of jade Buddha&#x27;, the &#x27;Hall of Heavenly Kings&#x27;, Hall of Mahavira and Hall of Changing Ge (repository of ancient scriptures).

In addition, the &#x27;Cool and Clear Terrace&#x27; known as the &#x27;Qingliang Terrace&#x27; is behind the main hall, the place where the original sutras were translated. This terrace is amidst bamboo forest of old pine trees and has halls which are interconnected. Four sides of the terrace are piled with green bricks. The central building of the terrace is the Vairocana Pavilion, which was originally constructed during the Han dynasty. The present building dates back to the Ming dynasty and was built with a &quot;xieshan&quot; style roof with double eaves. The pavilion principally enshrines statues of Vairocana Buddha and the Bodhisattvas Manjushri and Samantabhadra. In addition, a total of 5,050 wood-carved Buddha statues, made with incense ash, are enshrined on both sides of the pavilion. The terrace also has the Kunlu Pavilion with halls on its east and west that house the statues of the two eminent monks, She Moteng and Zhu Falan. They were buried inside the temple gate after they died here; the Bell Tower and the Drum Tower, in front of their tombs, were once prominent sights of Luo Yang City.
In the courtyard, large burners are kept for worshipers to light incense sticks, creating a pungent odour. In the Main hall and other halls where images are worshiped, the altars are filled with fruit and other offerings made by the devotees. Multicoloured tapestry hang from the ceilings of the halls and lighted candles float in the basins, presenting a divine spiritual setting.

The smallest hall is known as the âHall of greetingsâ. It is a relatively new building that was built during the 9th year of Guangho period as replacement to the original hall which was burned down at the beginning of the Tonghzi period. This hall has deified statues of three western paradise (Indian) saints. Amitabha, the founder, is at the centre and is flanked by Guanyin on the left and Mahasthamaprapta on the right.

The founders of the temple whose statues are worshiped in the âHall of Six Foundersâ belonged to the sect of Chan. The names of the founders as displayed in the order of their succession: Bodidharma, the first founder who hailed from ancient India where he was the 28th generation patriarch preaching the Buddhist philosophy; the second was Huike; the third founder was Sengcan; the fourth was Daoxn, the fifth founder was Hongren; and the sixth was Huineng. Subsequent to Huineng, five schools of Buddhism and Seven Orders were established.

In the &quot;Hall of the Jade Buddha,&quot; stands an image of the Sakyamuni Buddha. The tall image made in jade was donated in 1988 by a Chinese man who had settled in Burma. This elegantly sculpted and cherished statue has a precious stone embedded in its forehead. Before it was shifted to this temple in 1992, it had been stored in the Pilu pavilion.

The first large hall in the temple complex is known as &quot;The Hall of Heavenly Kings,&quot; where a statue of the Maitreya, known in China as the laughing Buddha, is the main deity located in the hall&#x27;s front. This statue is flanked on the eastern and western sides by four heavenly kings, each representing one fourth of the universe. The eastern side is ruled by Chigua (guardian of the State) carrying a Pipa, the western side is controlled by Guangmu (Sharp-seer) with a dragon in his hand, the southern direction is represented by Zengzhang (Growth Protector), carrying an umbrella and the northern direction is represented by Duowen (Knowledge Preserver), carrying a Pagoda. In addition, there is a statue of Wei Tuo (a high ranking heavenly general and defender of Buddhist law) at the rear of the Maitreya statue.

The Hall of Changing Ge, built in 1995, is a repository of ancient scriptures, which has more than ten types of Buddhist texts, including the &quot;Longzang Jing Dazong Jing&quot;, the &quot;Dazeng Zong Jing&quot;, the &quot;Tibet Jing&quot; and so forth. An ancient Buddha statue of China is installed at the centre of the repository. The making of this Buddha statue is traced to the Eastern Han dynasty. The statue was misplaced at the early 20th century. However, it was later found in Thailand and was replicated in bronze into two tall statues and then gilded. One of these is deified in the library and the other was sent to Thailand.

The Mahavira Hall enshrines the statues of three principal Buddhas. The central image is of the Sakyamuni Buddha. This statue is flanked on the left by Bhaisajyaguru and on the right by Amitabha; these in turn are flanked by two heavenly generals named Wei Tuo and Wei Li. Statues of the Eighteen Arhats adorn the side of the hall. All the statues were made in ramie-cloth during the Yuan dynasty. The walls on both sides are adorned with carvings of ten thousand Buddhists. A statue of Jialan is installed facing north of the backdoor.

In the Main Hall, at the altar, there are three statues, the central statue is that of Sakhyamuni Buddha flanked by statue of Manjushri and Samantabhadra. There is a very large bell weighing more than 1 tonne (a figure of 2.5 tonnes is also mentioned), installed during the reign of the Jiajing Emperor of the Ming dynasty, near the altar, which is struck in time during the chanting of prayers by the monks. A community of ten thousand monks resided here during the Tang dynasty. The inscription on the bell reads: &quot;The sound of the Bell resounds in Buddha&#x27;s temple causing the ghosts in Hell to tremble with fear.&quot;

The living quarters of the monks are in an exclusive pagoda, with restricted entry, called the &quot;Qiyun Ta,&quot; or Qiyun Pagoda. It is approachable after crossing the manicured garden and a bridge to the left of the main temple. This pagoda was built in the 12th century in the fifteenth year of the Dading reign of the Jin dynasty (1115â1234). It is a 13 tiered, ), high cubic shaped brick tower. It has been renovated in subsequent periods. The tomb of the famous Tang dynasty official Di Renjie is also located in the eastern end of the complex.

Although the temple is open to the public, visitors are closely monitored for security purposes. While the chief abbot stays informed about the country&#x27;s political situation through a TV installed in his room, monks dwelling in this facility are required to carry an identification card at all times.

==Cultural relics==
===Statue of Maitreya===
A stone statue of Maitreya, which was made in the 6th century, was stolen and lost to the United States, now it is preserved at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

==Peony Festival==
Peony Festival (&quot;mudan huahui&quot;) is an important flower festival, which is held in Luoyang every year on April 10â25 and which attracts large crowds to the city and the White Horse Temple. The legend linked to this festival is that peony flower did not follow the orders of the queen Empress Wu of the Tang dynasty to bloom during winter and she became enraged that it did not obey her command. As a result, she ordered that peony flowers be banished from Xi&#x27;an to Luoyang. It is this banishment which is celebrated as the Peony Festival in Luoyang.

<doc id="645744" wikidata="Q1225412" url="?curid=645744" title="Dilation (morphology)">
<text>Dilation (usually represented by â) is one of the basic operations in mathematical morphology. Originally developed for binary images, it has been expanded first to grayscale images, and then to complete lattices. The dilation operation usually uses a structuring element for probing and expanding the shapes contained in the input image.

==Binary dilation==
In binary morphology, dilation is a shift-invariant (translation invariant) operator, equivalent to Minkowski addition. 

A binary image is viewed in mathematical morphology as a subset of a Euclidean space R&quot;d&quot; or the integer grid Z&quot;d&quot;, for some dimension &quot;d&quot;. Let &quot;E&quot; be a Euclidean space or an integer grid, &quot;A&quot; a binary image in &quot;E&quot;, and &quot;B&quot; a structuring element regarded as a subset of R&quot;d&quot;.

The dilation of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;B&quot; is defined by

::formula_1

where &quot;A&quot;&quot;b&quot; is the translation of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;b&quot;.

Dilation is commutative, also given by formula_2.

If &quot;B&quot; has a center on the origin, then the dilation of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;B&quot; can be understood as the locus of the points covered by &quot;B&quot; when the center of &quot;B&quot; moves inside &quot;A&quot;. The dilation of a square of size 10, centered at the origin, by a disk of radius 2, also centered at the origin, is a square of side 14, with rounded corners, centered at the origin. The radius of the rounded corners is 2.

The dilation can also be obtained by formula_3, where &quot;B&quot;&quot;s&quot; denotes the symmetric of &quot;B&quot;, that is, formula_4.

=== Example ===

Suppose A is the following 11 x 11 matrix and B is the following 3 x 3 matrix:

 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 
 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 
 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1
 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1
 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1
 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 
 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 
 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

For each pixel in A that has a value of 1, superimpose B, with the center of B aligned with the corresponding pixel in A.

Each pixel of every superimposed B is included in the dilation of A by B.

The dilation of A by B is given by this 11 x 11 matrix.
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0

=== Properties of binary dilation ===

Here are some properties of the binary dilation operator

* It is translation invariant.
* It is increasing, that is, if formula_5, then formula_6.
* It is commutative.
* If the origin of &quot;E&quot; belongs to the structuring element &quot;B&quot;, then it is extensive, i.e., formula_7.
* It is associative, i.e., formula_8. 
* It is distributive over set union

==Grayscale dilation==
In grayscale morphology, images are functions mapping a Euclidean space or grid &quot;E&quot; into formula_9, where formula_10 is the set of reals, formula_11 is an element greater than any real number, and formula_12 is an element less than any real number.

Grayscale structuring elements are also functions of the same format, called &quot;structuring functions&quot;.

Denoting an image by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and the structuring function by &quot;b&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), the grayscale dilation of &quot;f&quot; by &quot;b&quot; is given by

::formula_13

where &quot;sup&quot; denotes the supremum. 

===Flat structuring functions===

It is common to use flat structuring elements in morphological applications. Flat structuring functions are functions &quot;b&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) in the form

::formula_14

where formula_15.

In this case, the dilation is greatly simplified, and given by

::formula_16

(Suppose &quot;x&quot;Â =Â (&quot;px&quot;,Â &quot;qx&quot;), &quot;z&quot;Â =Â (&quot;pz&quot;,Â &quot;qz&quot;), then &quot;x&quot;Â âÂ &quot;z&quot;Â =Â (&quot;px&quot;Â âÂ &quot;pz&quot;,Â &quot;qx&quot;Â âÂ &quot;qz&quot;).)

In the bounded, discrete case (&quot;E&quot; is a grid and &quot;B&quot; is bounded), the supremum operator can be replaced by the maximum. Thus, dilation is a particular case of order statistics filters, returning the maximum value within a moving window (the symmetric of the structuring function support &quot;B&quot;).

==Dilation on complete lattices==

Complete lattices are partially ordered sets, where every subset has an infimum and a supremum. In particular, it contains a least element and a greatest element (also denoted &quot;universe&quot;).

Let formula_17 be a complete lattice, with infimum and supremum symbolized by formula_18 and formula_19, respectively. Its universe and least element are symbolized by &quot;U&quot; and formula_20, respectively. Moreover, let formula_21 be a collection of elements from &quot;L&quot;.

A dilation is any operator formula_22 that distributes over the supremum, and preserves the least element. That is, the following are true:
* formula_23
* formula_24

<text>Griffith Observatory is an observatory in Los Angeles, California, on the south-facing slope of Mount Hollywood in Griffith Park. It commands a view of the Los Angeles Basin including Downtown Los Angeles to the southeast, Hollywood to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the southwest. The observatory is a popular tourist attraction with a close view of the Hollywood Sign and an extensive array of space and science-related displays. It is named after its benefactor, Griffith J. Griffith. Admission has been free since the observatory&#x27;s opening in 1935, in accordance with the benefactor&#x27;s will.

Since its opening, over 9 million people have looked through the 12-inch (30.5Â cm) Zeiss refracting scope, making it the most viewed telescope in the world. The space theme prevails in the interior.

==History==
On December 16, 1896, of land surrounding the observatory was donated to the City of Los Angeles by Griffith J. Griffith. In his will he donated funds to build an observatory, exhibit hall, and planetarium on the donated land. Griffith&#x27;s objective was to make astronomy accessible to the public, as opposed to the prevailing idea that observatories should be located on remote mountaintops and restricted to scientists.

Griffith drafted detailed specifications for the observatory. In drafting the plans, he consulted with Walter Sydney Adams, the future director of Mount Wilson Observatory, and George Ellery Hale, who founded (with Andrew Carnegie) the first astrophysical telescope in Los Angeles.

As a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project, construction began on June 20, 1933, using a design developed by architects John C. Austin and Frederic Morse Ashley (1870â1960), based on preliminary sketches by Russell W. Porter. The observatory and accompanying exhibits were opened to the public on May 14, 1935, as the country&#x27;s third planetarium. In its first five days of operation the observatory logged more than 13,000 visitors. Dinsmore Alter was the museum&#x27;s director during its first years.

The building combines Greek and Beaux-Arts influences, and the exterior is embellished with the Greek key pattern.

During World War II, the planetarium was used to train pilots in celestial navigation. The planetarium was again used for this purpose in the 1960s to train Apollo program astronauts for the first lunar missions.

===Griffith Observatory Foundation===
Griffith Observatory Foundation was chartered in 1978 as Friends of the Observatory. It was founded by Debra Griffith and Harold Griffith (the grandson of the observatory&#x27;s benefactor) with Dr. E.C. Krupp (the current Observatory Director) and a small group of dedicated partners. The foundation supports the observatory in its mission of public astronomy and advocated the restoration and expansion of the observatory. The foundation continues to promote the observatory as an agent of science literacy, education, and experiential astronomy.

===Renovation and expansion===
The observatory closed on January 6, 2002, for renovation and a major expansion of exhibit space. It reopened to the public on November 2, 2006, retaining its Art Deco exterior. The $93 million renovation, paid largely by a public bond issue, restored the building, as well as replaced the aging planetarium dome. The building was expanded underground, with completely new exhibits, a cafÃ©, gift shop, and the new Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon Theater.

On May 25, 2008, the Observatory offered visitors live coverage of the &quot;Phoenix&quot; landing on Mars.

Ed Krupp has been the director of the Observatory since 1974. He has been responsible for updating the technology and the building for over 45 years.

==Exhibits==

The first exhibit visitors encountered in 1935 was the Foucault pendulum, which was designed to demonstrate the rotation of the Earth. The exhibits also included a 12-inch (305mm) Zeiss refracting telescope in the east dome, a triple-beam coelostat (solar telescope) in the west dome, and a thirty-eight foot relief model of the moon&#x27;s north polar region.

Griffith requested that the observatory include a display on evolution which was accomplished with the Cosmochron exhibit which included a narration from Caltech Professor Chester Stock and an accompanying slide show. The evolution exhibit existed from 1937 to the mid-1960s.

Also included in the original design was a planetarium under the large central dome. The first shows covered topics including the Moon, worlds of the Solar System, and eclipses.

The planetarium theater was renovated in 1964 and a Mark IV Zeiss projector was installed.

The CafÃ© at the End of the Universe, an homage to Restaurant at the End of the Universe, is one of the many cafÃ©s run by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. One wall inside the building is covered with the largest astronomically accurate image ever constructed ( long by high), called &quot;The Big Picture&quot;, depicting the Virgo Cluster of galaxies; visitors can explore the highly detailed image from within arm&#x27;s reach or through telescopes away. In 2006 the 1964-vintage Zeiss Mark IV star projector was replaced with a Zeiss Mark IX Universarium. The former planetarium projector is part of the underground exhibit on ways in which humanity has visualized the skies.

Centered in the Universe features a high-resolution immersive video projected by an innovative laser system developed by Evans and Sutherland Corporation, along with a short night sky simulation projected by the Zeiss Universarium. A team of animators, directed by observatory art director Don Dixon who also co-wrote the script, worked more than two years to create the 30-minute program. Actors, holding a glowing orb, perform the presentation, under the direction of Chris Shelton. Tickets for the show are purchased separately at the box office within the observatory. Tickets are sold on a first-come, first-served basis. Children under 5 are free, but are admitted to only the first planetarium show of the day. Only members of the observatory&#x27;s support group, Friends of the Observatory, may reserve tickets for the planetarium show.

The observatory is split up into six sections: The Wilder Hall of the Eye, the Ahmanson Hall of the Sky, the W. M. Keck Foundation Central Rotunda, the Cosmic Connection, the Gunther Depths of Space Hall, and the Edge of Space Mezzanine.

The Wilder Hall of the Eye, located in the east wing of the main level focuses on astronomical tools like telescopes and how they evolved over time so people can see further into space. Interactive features there include a Tesla coil and a &quot;Camera Obscura&quot;, which uses mirrors and lenses to focus light onto a flat surface.

The Ahmanson Hall of the Sky, located in the west wing, focuses on objects that are normally found in the sky, like the Sun and Moon. The main centerpiece of this section is a large solar telescope projecting images of the Sun, using a series of mirrors called coelostats. Exhibits here include a periodic table of the elements, a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and several alcoves showing exhibits about topics like day and night, the paths of the Sun and stars, the seasons, the phases of the Moon, tides, and eclipses. 
The W. M. Keck Foundation Central Rotunda features several Hugo Ballin murals on the ceiling and upper walls restored since 1934, a Foucault pendulum that demonstrates the Earth&#x27;s rotation, and a small exhibit dedicated to Griffith J. Griffith, after whom the observatory is named.
The Cosmic Connection is a 150Â ft long hallway connecting the main building and the underground exhibition areas (see below) that depicts the history of the universe, and dramatizes the amount of time that has passed from the Big Bang to the present day, using hundreds of individual pieces of astronomy-related jewelry.

The Gunther Depths of Space Hall is the lower level of the observatory, dominated by &quot;The Big Picture,&quot; and scale models of the Solar System. The planets (including dwarf planet Pluto) are shown relative to the size of the Sun, which is represented by the diameter of the Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon Theater. Below each planet are listed facts, as well as scales indicating a person&#x27;s weight on planets having a solid surface (or weight at an altitude where atmospheric pressure would equal one bar otherwise). In addition, beneath the Earth&#x27;s model, there is a small room containing a large model Earth globe, an older Zeiss planetarium projector, and a set of seismograph rolls, including one tracking room motion caused by occupants. The other rolls are attached to seismographs monitoring movement at the bedrock level, and indicate actual seismic activity. On the north wall of the Depths of Space is &quot;The Big Picture&quot;, a by photograph (the largest astronomical image in the world) showing a portion of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies at an angular scale of 0.1 degree per foot. This image was taken over the course of 11 nights by the 48-inch Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Mountain. There is also a bronze statue of Albert Einstein sitting on a bench in the Depths of Space. Einstein is holding his index finger about in front of his eyes, to illustrate the visual area of space that is captured in The Big Picture.

The Edge of Space Mezzanine, which overlooks the Depths of Space Hall, focuses more on astronomy related topics that involve celestial bodies much closer to Earth, with exhibits including meteorite displays, an asteroid impact simulator, cloud and spark chambers, a large globe of the Moon, and telescopes that allow inspection of The Big Picture from a distance.

===Tesla coil===
On display at the Observatory is a large Tesla coil, named for its inventor, Nikola Tesla. Dubbed &quot;GPO-1&quot;, it is one of a pair which were built in 1910 by Earle Ovington. Ovington, who would go on to fame as an aviator, ran a company which built high voltage generators for medical X-ray and electrotherapy devices. In public demonstrations of his generators, the spectacular displays drew crowds. Ovington designed the Observatory&#x27;s coil to surpass a coil made by Elihu Thomson in 1893 which generated a 64-inch spark. (Tesla had secretly produced much larger sparks in 1899.) The project caught the attention of an Edison Electric Illuminating Company official, who offered $1,000 if the coil were displayed at an upcoming electrical show in Madison Square Garden, with the stipulation that the machine would produce sparks not less than ten feet long.

The machine, dubbed the &quot;Million Volt Oscillator&quot;, was installed in the band balcony overlooking the arena. At the top of each hour the lights in the main hall were shut off, and sparks would shoot from the copper ball atop the coil to a matching coil 122 inches away, or to a wand held by an assistant. The chief engineer of the General Electric Company estimated that the discharges were at least 1.3 million volts.

Ovington, who died in 1936, gave the matching Tesla coils to his old electrotherapy colleague Frederick Finch Strong, who in 1937 donated them to Griffith Observatory. The Observatory had room to exhibit only one of the pair. By this time the machine was missing parts, so Observatory staffer Leon Hall restored it with the notable assistance of Hollywood special effects expert Kenneth Strickfaden who designed the special effects for &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931) among many other movies.

===&quot;Astronomers Monument&quot;===

The &quot;Astronomers Monument&quot; on the front lawn of the Observatory that pays homage to six of the greatest astronomers of all time: Hipparchus (about 150 BC); Nicolaus Copernicus (1473â1543); Galileo Galilei (1564â1642); Johannes Kepler (1571â1630); Isaac Newton (1642â1727); and William Herschel (1738â1822). The 1934 New Deal artwork, which was a collaboration between six local artists, is topped with an armillary sphere.

==Visiting==
Admission to the building and grounds of Griffith Observatory is free of charge. Planetarium shows at the Observatory are offered eight times a day on weekdays and ten times a day on weekends. A nominal fee is charged for admission to the planetarium shows. As long as the weather permits, the Observatory offers free public telescope viewing every night the observatory is open - usually beginning at 7:00Â p.m. This includes the historic 12&quot; Zeiss Refracting Telescope on the roof, and up to four portable telescopes placed outside offering views of visible celestial objects for the night. At 9:30Â p.m., the doors to the Zeiss dome close, and lines for the portable telescopes outside stop allowing guests into the queues - though the lines may close earlier on the busier nights. In poor weather, the roof may be closed to the public, but if still accessible under overcast skies, the Zeiss Telescope can still be visited as an exhibit during viewing hours.

There is a small parking lot next to the Observatory, plus more spaces along Western Canyon Rd, which require payment of $8â10 an hour, depending on the season. During busier times, the roads can get congested and limit access to the top. The Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) operates daily low cost DASH Observatory public bus service from the Vermont/Sunset Metro Red Line station to the Observatory, including a stop at the nearby Greek Theater, which can be used as a free parking area when there are no concerts. When parking at the Greek Theater parking lot on nights there are no concerts, visitors can choose to take trails up to the observatory (primarily by using the sidewalk along the road that leads up to the observatory) or by taking the bus that runs up the road and drops visitors off right outside the observatory grounds. The bus can be quite congested at peak times of the day but only takes about 5 minutes to reach the top. Walking the distance from the parking lot at the Greek Theater to the top would take approximately 15â20 minutes. The observatory is closed on Mondays.
There are photo opportunities and scenery at and around the Observatory, with views of the Pacific Ocean, the Hollywood Sign and Downtown Los Angeles.

==In popular culture==

===Other media===
* The song &quot;Observatory Crest&quot; from Captain Beefheart and The Magic Band&#x27;s album &quot;Bluejeans &amp; Moonbeams&quot; (1974) is about two lovers spending a romantic evening at Griffith Observatory. Lead vocalist Don Van Vliet lived nearby and frequently visited it in his youth.
* It was a filming location for the music video for &quot;Rush Rush&quot; (1991) by Paula Abdul which starred Keanu Reeves and was directed by Stefan WÃ¼rnitzer. This video was based on &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;.
* An image of the observatory is shown in a 2Pac music video, &quot;To Live &amp; Die in L.A.&quot;. The video pays homage to Los Angeles and its best known landmarks.
* Some interview segments with rock musician Ringo Starr for the &quot;Beatles Anthology&quot; video were conducted on the observatory grounds during the mid-1990s. Starr and Neil Aspinall are shown viewing Los Angeles from the Observatory.
* The 2004 Rockstar Games video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, set in a parody of both the states of California and Nevada, features a parody of the Griffith Observatory named &quot;Los Santos Observatory&quot;.
* On September 12, 2010, Linkin Park performed a brief set for a thousand fans onsite. &quot;The Catalyst&quot; from this performance was later shown by MTV for that night&#x27;s Video Music Awards.
* The photographs on the cover of The Byrds&#x27; album &quot;Untitled&quot; (1970) were taken on the staircase of Griffith Observatory.
* In the comic &quot;Runaways&quot;, the Runaways battle Geoffrey Wilder at Griffith Observatory, which is destroyed in the fight.
* Cartoonist Bill Griffith is known for his satirical cartoon commentary on American culture and values. He drew and released a one-shot magazine format collection of &quot;one-pager&quot; treatments of odd bits of American cultural life, entitled &quot;Griffith Observatory&quot;. It opens with a clever premise piece, in which he falls into the opportunity to rent the actual Griffith Observatory as a living space. The agent showing the property mentions the telescope in an offhand way as a &quot;plus&quot;, and Bill realizes it would be a tremendous boon to his amateur anthropological pastime.
* The 2013 Rockstar Games video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, which is set in a highly accurate and detailed parody of Los Angelesânamed &quot;Los Santos&quot;âas well as various surrounding areas of Southern California (the state itself is named &quot;San Andreas&quot;), features the &quot;Galileo Observatory&quot;, a fictionalized version of the Griffith Observatory.
* In 2019, a photo of the observatory was one of many splash screens for Windows 10.
* In the 2023 video game &quot;Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores&quot;, the observatory was purchased by billionaire and antagonist Walter Londra after a lengthy court battle, as a headquarters for his company.

<text>In mathematical morphology, opening is the dilation of the erosion of a set A by a structuring element B:

:formula_1

where formula_2 and formula_3 denote erosion and dilation, respectively.

Together with closing, the opening serves in computer vision and image processing as a basic workhorse of morphological noise removal. Opening removes small objects from the foreground (usually taken as the bright pixels) of an image, placing them in the background, while closing removes small holes in the foreground, changing small islands of background into foreground. These techniques can also be used to find specific shapes in an image. Opening can be used to find things into which a specific structuring element can fit (edges, corners, ...).

One can think of &quot;B&quot; sweeping around the inside of the boundary of &quot;A&quot;, so that it does not extend beyond the boundary, and shaping the &quot;A&quot; boundary around the boundary of the element.

==Properties==

* Opening is idempotent, that is, formula_4.
* Opening is increasing, that is, if formula_5, then formula_6.
* Opening is anti-extensive, i.e., formula_7.
* Opening is translation invariant.
* Opening and closing satisfy the duality formula_8, where formula_9 denotes closing.

==Example==

Perform Erosion formula_10:

Suppose A is the following 16 x 15 matrix and B is the following 3 x 3 matrix:

 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 
 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1
 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1
 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 
 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 
 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

First, perform Erosion on A by B formula_11):

Assuming that the origin of B is at its center, for each pixel in A superimpose the origin of B, if B is completely contained by A the pixel is retained, else deleted.

Therefore the Erosion of A by B is given by this 16 x 15 matrix.

formula_10 is given by:

 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Then, perform Dilation on the result of Erosion by B: formula_13:

For each pixel in formula_10 that has a value of 1, superimpose B, with the center of B aligned with the corresponding pixel in formula_10.

Each pixel of every superimposed B is included in the dilation of A by B.

The dilation of formula_10 by B is given by this 16 x 15 matrix.

formula_13 is given by :

 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 
 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 
 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 
 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 
 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Therefore, the opening operation formula_18 removes small protrusions from the boundary of the object represented by A, while preserving the overall shape and size of the larger components.

== Extension: Opening by reconstruction ==
In morphological opening formula_13, the erosion operation removes objects that are smaller than structuring element B and the dilation operation (approximately) restores the size and shape of the remaining objects. However, restoration accuracy in the dilation operation depends highly on the type of structuring element and the shape of the restoring objects. The opening by reconstruction method is able to restore the objects more completely after erosion has been applied. It is defined as the reconstruction by geodesic dilation of formula_20 erosions of formula_21 by formula_22 with respect to formula_21 :

formula_24

where formula_25 denotes a marker image and formula_21 is a mask image in morphological reconstruction by dilation. formula_27 formula_28 denotes geodesic dilation with formula_29 iterations until stability, i.e., such that formula_30 Since formula_31, the marker image is limited in the growth region by the mask image, so the dilation operation on the marker image will not expand beyond the mask image. As a result, the marker image is a subset of the mask image formula_32 (Strictly, this holds for binary masks only. However, similar statements hold when the mask is not binary.)

The images below present a simple opening-by-reconstruction example which extracts the vertical strokes from an input text image. Since the original image is converted from grayscale to binary image, it has a few distortions in some characters so that same characters might have different vertical lengths. In this case, the structuring element is an 8-pixel vertical line which is applied in the erosion operation in order to find objects of interest. Moreover, morphological reconstruction by dilation, formula_33 iterates formula_34 times until the resulting image converges.

:formula_1

where formula_2 and formula_3 denote the dilation and erosion, respectively. 

In image processing, closing is, together with opening, the basic workhorse of morphological noise removal. Opening removes small objects, while closing removes small holes.

== Example ==

Perform Dilation ( formula_4 ):

Suppose A is the following 11 x 11 matrix and B is the following 3 x 3 matrix:

 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0

 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

For each pixel in A that has a value of 1, superimpose B, with the center of B aligned with the corresponding pixel in A.

Each pixel of every superimposed B is included in the dilation of A by B.

The dilation of A by B is given by this 11 x 11 matrix.

formula_5 is given by :
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 

Now, Perform Erosion on the result: (formula_4) formula_7

formula_4 is the following 11 x 11 matrix and B is the following 3 x 3 matrix:

 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0

Assuming that the origin B is at its center, for each pixel in formula_4 superimpose the origin of B, if B is completely contained by A the pixel is retained, else deleted.

Therefore the Erosion of formula_4 by B is given by this 11 x 11 matrix.

(formula_4) formula_7 is given by:
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0

 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Therefore Closing Operation fills small holes and smoothes the object by filling narrow gaps.

<doc id="645780" wikidata="Q545955" url="?curid=645780" title="Abdulrab Rasul Sayyaf">
<text>Abdulrab Rasul Sayyaf ( ; ; born 1946) is an exiled Afghan politician and former mujahideen commander. He took part in the war against the MarxistâLeninist People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) government in the 1980s, leading the Afghan mujahideen faction &quot;Ittehad-al-Islami&quot; (Islamic Union).

Compared to other Afghan mujahideen leaders, Sayyaf was closely tied with international mujahideen from the Arab world. During the Soviet-Afghan War he had close relations with Saudi Arabia and helped mobilize Arab jihadist volunteers for the mujahideen forces.

Internally, Sayyaf was allied with the Rabbani government in the 1990s until the rise of the Taliban militia; this led to him joining the Northern Alliance in opposition of the Taliban, despite his close relationship with Saudi Arabia that supported the Taliban. In 2005 after the creation of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Sayyaf&#x27;s Islamic Union was converted into a political party and he was elected as a member of the Afghan Parliament, where he maintained political influence. Following the Taliban capture of Kabul in 2021, Sayyaf fled to exile in New Delhi, India.

==Early life==
Sayyaf was born in 1946 in Paghman, Kabul Province to a Pashtun family of Ghilzai tribe. 
Sayyaf () is an Arabic word that means &quot;swordsman.&quot; He is fluent in Arabic language and holds a degree in religion from Kabul University and a masters from the illustrious Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. He has been described as &quot;a big, beefy man with fair skin and a thick gray beard.&quot; Sayyaf is reported to be approximately in height and weigh . &quot;He usually wears a white skullcap or a large turban, and a traditional Afghan partug kameez, a tunic with loose pants.&quot; He was also noted for his photographic memory; Abdullah Anas, one of the leading Afghan Arabs, recalls in his memoirs that &quot;once when the hugely influential Abu&#x27;l Hassan al-Nadawi, known as the Syed Qutb of India, was delivering a lecture at Kabul University, Sayyaf translated the whole lecture into Persian word for word without mistakes after the former had finished delivering the entire lecture.&quot;

Sayyaf was a member of the Afghan-based Ikhwan al-Muslimin, founded in 1969 by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Dr. Burhanuddin Rabbani and having strong links to the original and much larger Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Sayyaf was a professor at the Shariat (Islamic law) faculty of Kabul University until 1973, when he plotted with his group to overthrow President Mohammed Daoud Khan. The uprising attempt in July 1975, in Panjshir Valley, failed significantly and he was forced to flee to Pakistan but was arrested when he returned. However another account claims Sayyaf was not part of the plot but was merely arrested by the government for his ideology.

==As a warlord==
===Soviet war and Bin Laden friendship===

Being imprisoned by the Communist People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan in April 1978, he was freed in controversial circumstances by General Secretary Hafizullah Amin, who, coincidentally, was Sayyaf&#x27;s distant relative. Although he did not arrive in Peshawar until 1980, after the actual Soviet intervention, due to having been incarcerated, he was recognized by the Pakistanis as the leader of the Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan (&quot;Ittihad-i-Islami Baraye Azadi Afghanistan&quot;), a coalition of several parties fighting the Soviet and Afghan government forces. The Islamic Union soon imploded, and Sayyaf retained the name as the title of his own organization. After presenting his organization and the jihad to Arabs in Saudi Arabia, Sayyaf is thought to have been most responsible for internationalizing the Afghan jihad against the Soviets, and thus creating a vocal point of concerns to Muslims in the Middle East. Sayyaf further made a name change and growing his beard very long, which were symbols of his close relations with the royal Saudis and their Wahhabist tradition. The Saudi General Intelligence Presidency tried to coerce the leaders of the other mujahideen movements to accept Sayyaf as their leader. In 1980 Prince Turki bin Faisal invited the major mujahideen leaders to a conference in Taif and locked them in a jail until they agreed to accept Sayyaf&#x27;s command, but they reneged on the agreement immediately after being freed.

Sayyaf fought against government forces and Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan during the 1980s, and was generously financed, and apparently favoured, by Saudi Arabia, seemingly due to his close religious affinities with the Wahhabist Saudi Royal and religious establishment and his excellent command of the Arabic language. During the jihad against the Soviet Union and its Afghan allies, he formed a close relationship with Osama bin Laden. Together in the Jalalabad area they established a training camp network, later used by Al-Qaeda personnel, with bunkers and emplacements. In 1981, Sayyaf formed and headed the &quot;Ittihad-i-Islami Baraye Azadi Afghanistan&quot;, or Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan. In 1985, he founded a university in an Afghan refugee camp near Peshawar called &quot;Dawa&#x27;a al-Jihad&quot; (Call of Jihad), which has been described the &quot;preeminent school for terrorism.&quot; Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, attended it.

Despite his growing wealth, he continued to live a spartan life, avoiding modern conveniences like mattresses and air conditioning; although he enjoyed a nightly game of tennis.

During the post-war period, Sayyaf retained his training camps, using them for militarily training and indoctrinating new recruits to fight in Islamic-backed conflicts such as Chechnya, Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the Southern Philippines, his name and example inspired the early leaders of the Abu Sayyaf group, who took the name Abu Sayyaf as a &quot;nom de guerre&quot;.
Also, in these camps, Sayyaf trained and mentored the soon-to-be-infamous, Kuwaiti-born, future Al-Qaeda operative and senior commander and principle architect of the 9/11 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, after being introduced by the latter&#x27;s brother, Zahid, during the Afghan Jihad in 1987. Sayyaf has also been alleged to be the true mastermind of 9/11. This is due to his probable role in assassinating Ahmad Shah Massoud two days before 9/11 and his connections to and mentoring of the perpetrators of 9/11, something acknowledged even in the official 9/11 commission report.

===Battle of Kabul===
After the forced withdrawal of the demoralised Soviet forces in 1989, and the overthrow of the Mohammad Najibullah regime in 1992, Sayyaf&#x27;s organization&#x27;s human rights record became noticeably worse, underlined by their involvement in the infamous massacres and rampages in the Shia Hazara-majority Afshar district of Kabul in 1992-1993 during the Battle of Kabul. Sayyaf&#x27;s faction was responsible for, &quot;repeated human butchery&quot;, when his faction of Mujahideen turned on civilians and the Shia Hezb-i Wahdat group in west Kabul starting May 1992. Amnesty International reported that Sayyaf&#x27;s forces rampaged through the neighborhood, slaughtering and raping inhabitants and burning homes. Sayyaf, who was allied with the &quot;de jure&quot; Kabul government of Burhanuddin Rabbani, did not deny the abductions of Hazara civilians, but merely accused the Hezb-i Wahdat militia of being an Iranian agent.

===Opposition to the Taliban===
Sayyaf claimed and claims he is a vituperative opponent of the Taliban movement, which is the reason he officially joined the Northern Alliance, despite his religious and ideological affinities with the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. Sayyaf was initially the only Pashtun leader in the Northern Alliance fighting against the Taliban. Sayyaf is rumored to have helped Arab suicide assassins to kill the Northern Alliance leader, Ahmad Shah Massoud. He is also rumored to have helped during their preparations, raising suspicion he was involved in killing Massoud. Sayyaf&#x27;s forces participated in the Northern Alliance&#x27;s capture of Kabul during the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.

==Since 2001==
===2003 Constitutional Loya Jirga===
In 2003, Sayyaf was elected as one of the 502 representatives at the Constitutional Loya Jirga in Kabul, chairing one of the working groups. Originally wanted Loya Jirga intended to divide the 502 delegates randomly among 10 working groups, but Sayyaf objected, suggesting delegates be divided among the groups to ensure equal distribution of professional expertise, provincial origin, gender and other criteria. &quot;Those who know the constitution, the ulema [Islamic scholars], and the lawyers should be split into different groups so that the results of the discussion and debate will be positive, and closer to each other,&quot; said Sayyaf.

Abdul Sayyaf&#x27;s influence in the convention was felt further when his ally Fazal Hadi Shinwari was appointed by Hamid Karzai as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, in violation of the constitution, as Fazal was over the age limit and trained only in religious, not secular, law. Shinwari packed the Supreme Court with sympathetic mullahs, called for Taliban-style punishments and renewed the Taliban-era Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, which was renamed the Ministry of Haj and Religious Affairs.

===Member of parliament===
He launched his newly converted Islamic Dawah Organisation of Afghanistan party in 2005 and was elected as a member of parliament that same year in parliamentary elections. Later in 2005 he was running for Speaker of the Lower House, where he surprisingly gained the support of Muhammad Mohaqiq, an ethnic Hazara and former member of the Hazara militia that fought against Sayyaf&#x27;s militia in west Kabul in the 1990s. Although Sayyaf lost the Speaker election to Yunus Qanuni, Mohaqiq&#x27;s support helped to fix the relationship between Sayyaf and Hazaras.

During his years as MP and in the 2010s, Sayyaf has become an influential elderly lawmaker, presenting himself as a &quot;voice of wisdom&quot;. He was noted as being having the &quot;greatest authority&quot; to speak on religious matters. Sayyaf was a loyal supporter of the incumbent president, Hamid Karzai. However he controversially supported a bill granting amnesty for former mujahideen warlords accused of crimes in the past.

On the first anniversary of Burhanuddin Rabbani&#x27;s assassination, Sayyaf spoke at a gathering saying that the actions of suicide bombers are against Islam and unforgivable by God.

Sayyaf announced himself as a candidate for the President of Afghanistan in the 2014 election, campaigning in fighting against corruption and in favor of women&#x27;s rights. He received 7.04% of the vote in the first round, as the candidate for the aforementioned Islamic Dawah Organisation of Afghanistan, and winning Kandahar Province.

In 2015, Sayyaf strongly criticized the Taliban in a speech, calling their actions &quot;un-Islamic&quot; and called the group &quot;slaves of Pakistan&quot; â his remarks were widely hailed by different Afghan social segments. On proposed peace talks with the Taliban in 2018, Sayyaf commented that peace is the &quot;order of Allah&quot;.

In April 2019, Sayyaf was chosen by President Ghani to chair the four-day loya jirga for peace efforts, attended by 3,200 representatives in Kabul. He called for unity in his opening remarks. In his main speech, Sayyaf stressed the importance of women&#x27;s rights, saying &quot;The Prophet of Islam is also a descendant of a woman&quot;, and called defending women a &quot;religious principle&quot;. This countered reports from the western press that he is a hardliner opposed to women&#x27;s rights.

===2021 exile in India===
After the fall of Kabul on August 15, 2021, Sayyaf refused to pledge allegiance and was rumored to have fled to India. In October, there were unconfirmed reports that he is part of a planned government in exile in Tajikistan alongside other exiled politicians. This resistance movement was declared a few days later, alongside Atta Muhammad Nur. It was later revealed that Sayyaf had been based in New Delhi, India, after fleeing the Taliban&#x27;s take over of Afghanistan.

<doc id="645784" wikidata="Q5881887" url="?curid=645784" title="Holly (Red Dwarf)">
<text>Holly is a fictional character in the science fiction situation comedy &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. The character, who is the eponymous spaceship&#x27;s onboard computer, has been played by Norman Lovett (series I-II, VII-VIII, XII, The Promised Land) and Hattie Hayridge (series III-V).

==Actors==
The character was played by Norman Lovett in Series I and II. In series III the character had a &quot;head sex change&quot; and was played by Hattie Hayridge. Hayridge played the part of Holly from Series IIIâV. Holly did not appear in Series VI, but reappeared in the Series VII finale as the original male version, again played by Lovett. The male version of Holly appeared throughout Series VIII, but does not appear in &quot;Red Dwarf: Back to Earth&quot;, Series X, or Series XI. Lovett reprised the role for the final episode of Series XII and has appeared in the role again in an extended special episode The Promised Land in 2020. Doug Naylor also revealed on Twitter that Lovett&#x27;s return was permanent for any future series or specials.

In the unaired pilot for the American version of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, Holly was played by Jane Leeves.

==Appearance==
Holly is an &quot;intelligent&quot; computer. Holly&#x27;s user interface appears on ship screens as a disembodied human head on a black background, and can also be downloaded into a watch worn by Lister, Kryten&#x27;s chest display, and on a motorcycle speedometer when the crew visited Waxworld. In Series I his face appears pixelated, but this idea was dropped in Series II. As a male, Holly appears to be approximately 50 years old and has receding brown hair.

After meeting his female counterpart, Hilly, in the series 2 episode &quot;Parallel Universe&quot; Holly&#x27;s adopted Hilly&#x27;s likeness due to falling in love with Hilly and adopting her persona. 

In reality, the switch from Norman Lovett to Hattie Hayridge as Holly came down to practical and production decisions. Norman Lovett left the show after Series II due to dissatisfaction with how production was handled. Hattie Hayridge, who had already appeared as Hilly in the episode Parallel Universe, was brought on as the new Holly.

When Red Dwarf returned for Series III, the creators (Rob Grant and Doug Naylor) opted for a time skip and used a tongue-in-cheek text crawl at the beginning of the series to hand-wave changes to the ship, crew, and other details. This crawl didnât specifically address Hollyâs change, leaving it largely unexplained in-universe.

In series VIIâVIII, the upgraded male version of Holly appears to be around 60 years old with receding grey hair and a bald patch.

In &#x27;Skipper&#x27;, the final episode of Series XII, Holly re-appears in a brief appearance when Rimmer travels to a point in time where the crew are about to be killed by the radiation leak as demonstrated in &quot;The End&quot;. He appears to be approximately 70 years old, has less hair than his previous appearances and that hair has become more grey.

==Character==
Holly is the ship&#x27;s Tenth Generation AI hologrammatic computer. After releasing Dave Lister from stasis in &quot;The End&quot;, Holly told him that the crew have been wiped out by a radiation leak and that he had spent three million years in stasis. Holly prides himself on the fact he had an IQ of 6,000, but after three million years by himself, he had become computer senile, or as Holly put it, &quot;a bit peculiar&quot;. The crew often ridicule Holly on his senility, but Holly often comes out on top. He often plays practical jokes on the crew, such as fooling Lister into thinking that NORWEB Federation space fighters were after him and wanted Â£180 billion in arrears for leaving his bathroom light on three million years ago, as well as wanting to arrest him for &quot;Crimes against Humanity&quot; as he had left some mouldy German sausages alone in his apartment for three million years and now the mould covered 7/8 of the Earth&#x27;s surface. This love of practical jokes culminated in his generating an alternate personality, &quot;Queeg&quot;, and passing him off as the ship&#x27;s backup computer which was seizing control of the ship; Holly&#x27;s Queeg persona is portrayed by Charles Augins in the episode.

Holly always speaks in a droll, slightly monotonous, and quiet voice, even when sounding alarms, which consist of himself speaking simply &quot;Ding-dong. There&#x27;s an emergency going on. (pauses) It&#x27;s still going on.&quot; and repeating as much. He often greets the crew with &quot;All right dudes?&quot;

Among his achievements was the invention of Hol Rock, where he decimalised music (having ten notes instead of eightâalthough he admits that this would result in &quot;piano keyboards being the width of a zebra crossing, and women being banned from playing the cello&quot;), writing an A-Z guide to the universe and reading every book in existence (concluding that the worst was &quot;Football: It&#x27;s a Funny Old Game&quot; by Kevin Keegan).

He was friends with another computer called Gordon, who had an IQ of 8,000 and was an Eleventh Generation AI hologrammatic computer. Gordon resembled Holly in that he was represented as a balding middle-aged man. Despite having a higher IQ than Holly, Gordon showed a lesser understanding of technology than Holly. One of the more worrying aspects of Holly&#x27;s senility is that he has developed a blind spot for the number 7. When he invents the Holly Hop Drive, he claims that one mistake in his 13 billion calculations and they would be blown up. He then misses the seven in his countdown, possibly the cause of the error that sent them to the parallel universe.

Holly runs most of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;&#x27;s systems, although in several episodes such as &quot;Quarantine&quot;, Holly is shown to not have complete control of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, and in Holly&#x27;s absence in Series VI and VII, a computer is mentioned by the crew, and is seen to control autopilot.

Holly was lost for some time, along with the ship, which had been stolen by Kryten&#x27;s nanobots. He was found on a planet made of junk from &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, having reverted to his original male form, and was downloaded into Lister&#x27;s Holly-watch. When the nanobots rebuilt the ship, there were two versions of Holly: the original, who usually remains in the watch, and a rebuilt version who had not suffered the effects of three million years alone. The non-senile version only appeared in one episode, &quot;Back in the Red, Part III&quot;, and was distinguished by having an enormous forehead shaped like an egg. The original Holly then states that he was responsible for re-engineering the Nanobots to resurrect the dead crew, all for the purposes of distracting Lister from going insane.

In &quot;Red Dwarf: Back to Earth&quot; it is revealed that sometime after the events of &quot;Only The Good...&quot; Holly is offline due to water damage, later elaborated as being the result of Lister leaving a bath running in the officers&#x27; quarters for nine years and the water subsequently flooding the ship.

Kryten briefly mentions Holly in the series X episode &quot;Fathers and Suns&quot;, saying that the crew &quot;miss&quot; him before installing Pree, another computer.

Holly made a return appearance in the final episode of Series XII (&quot;Skipper&quot;), once again played by Lovett. This version of Holly was still senile but located in an alternate universe which Rimmer enters, set just before the crew are wiped out by the radiation leak.

In &quot;Red Dwarf: The Promised Land&quot;, Lister discovers Holly&#x27;s back-up personality disc and uses it to reactivate him, but the &#x27;new&#x27; Holly, although once again smart, begins steps to destroy the ship as he concludes it is no longer fulfilling a worthwhile function for the company. Temporarily retreating to Starbug, the crew are eventually able to trick the new Holly into downloading the experiences of the original from the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; archives, which restores his senility but also his old personality, prompting him to help them reclaim the ship from the rogue Cats.

<text>Samuel Stillman Berry (March 16, 1887 â April 9, 1984) was an American marine zoologist who specialized in cephalopods.

== Early life ==

Berry was born in Unity, Maine, but the family home was the Winnecook Ranch in Montana, which had been founded by his father Ralph in 1880. In 1897, he moved with his mother to Redlands, California.

Berry received a B.S. (1909) from Stanford and his M.S. (1910) from Harvard. He then returned to Stanford for his Ph.D. work on cephalopods and got his doctorate in 1913.

== Career ==

From 1913 until 1915, he worked as a librarian and research assistant at the Scripps Institution for Biological Research in La Jolla, California. This was the last paid employment he ever held in academiaâall his later studies and expeditions were financed by the profits from the family ranch in Montana.

From November 1946 to December 1969, Berry published his own journal, &quot;Leaflets in Malacology&quot;, which primary contained articles which he had written himself.

Despite his independent status, he became a renowned malacologist, publishing 209 articles and establishing 401 mollusc taxa. His scientific publications dealt with chitons, cephalopods, and land snails. Forty-seven of his published papers were about cephalopods.

Berry also had an interest in horticulture, where he concentrated on the hybridization of irises and daffodils. For some time, from the 1920s until the late 1940s, he ran a horticultural business from Winnecook Ranch, which he had taken over after the death of his father in 1911. In 1917 he became the president of the Winnecook Ranch Company, a post he occupied until his death in 1984.

<doc id="645792" wikidata="Q2561743" url="?curid=645792" title="Chronology protection conjecture">
<text>The chronology protection conjecture is a hypothesis first proposed by Stephen Hawking that laws of physics beyond those of standard general relativity prevent time travelâeven when the latter theory states that it should be possible (such as in scenarios where faster than light travel is allowed). The permissibility of time travel is represented mathematically by the existence of closed timelike curves in some solutions to the field equations of general relativity. The chronology protection conjecture should be distinguished from chronological censorship under which every closed timelike curve passes through an event horizon, which might prevent an observer from detecting the causal violation (also known as chronology violation).

==Etymology==
In a 1992 paper, Hawking uses the metaphorical device of a &quot;Chronology Protection Agency&quot; as a personification of the aspects of physics that make time travel impossible at macroscopic scales, thus apparently preventing temporal paradoxes. He says:

The idea of the Chronology Protection Agency appears to be drawn playfully from the Time Patrol or Time Police concept, which has been used in many works of science fiction such as Poul Anderson&#x27;s series of &quot;Time Patrol&quot; stories or Isaac Asimov&#x27;s novel &quot;The End of Eternity&quot;, or in the television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. &quot;The Chronology Protection Case&quot; by Paul Levinson, published after Hawking&#x27;s paper, posits a universe that goes so far as to murder any scientists who are close to inventing any means of time travel. Larry Niven, in his short story âRotating Cylinders and the possibility of Global Causality Violationâ expands this concept so that the universe causes environmental catastrophe, or global civil war, or the local sun going nova, to any civilisation which shows any sign of successful construction.

==General relativity and quantum corrections==
Many attempts to generate scenarios for closed timelike curves have been suggested, and the theory of general relativity does allow them in certain circumstances. Some theoretical solutions in general relativity that contain closed timelike curves would require an infinite universe with certain features that our universe does not appear to have, such as the universal rotation of the GÃ¶del metric or the rotating cylinder of infinite length known as a Tipler cylinder. However, some solutions allow for the creation of closed timelike curves in a bounded region of spacetime, with the Cauchy horizon being the boundary between the region of spacetime where closed timelike curves can exist and the rest of spacetime where they cannot. One of the first such bounded time travel solutions found was constructed from a traversable wormhole, based on the idea of taking one of the two &quot;mouths&quot; of the wormhole on a round-trip journey at relativistic speed to create a time difference between it and the other mouth (see the discussion at Wormhole#Time travel).

General relativity does not include quantum effects on its own, and a full integration of general relativity and quantum mechanics would require a theory of quantum gravity, but there is an approximate method for modeling quantum fields in the curved spacetime of general relativity, known as semiclassical gravity. Initial attempts to apply semiclassical gravity to the traversable wormhole time machine indicated that at exactly the moment that wormhole would first allow for closed timelike curves, quantum vacuum fluctuations build up and drive the energy density to infinity in the region of the wormholes. This occurs when the two wormhole mouths, call them A and B, have been moved in such a way that it becomes possible for a particle or wave moving at the speed of light to enter mouth B at some time T2 and exit through mouth A at an earlier time T1, then travel back towards mouth B through ordinary space, and arrive at mouth B at the same time T2 that it entered B on the previous loop; in this way the same particle or wave can make a potentially infinite number of loops through the same regions of spacetime, piling up on itself. Calculations showed that this effect would not occur for an ordinary beam of radiation, because it would be &quot;defocused&quot; by the wormhole so that most of a beam emerging from mouth A would spread out and miss mouth B. But when the calculation was done for vacuum fluctuations, it was found that they would spontaneously refocus on the trip between the mouths, indicating that the pileup effect might become large enough to destroy the wormhole in this case.

Uncertainty about this conclusion remained, because the semiclassical calculations indicated that the pileup would only drive the energy density to infinity for an infinitesimal moment of time, after which the energy density would die down. But semiclassical gravity is considered unreliable for large energy densities or short time periods that reach the Planck scale; at these scales, a complete theory of quantum gravity is needed for accurate predictions. So, it remains uncertain whether quantum-gravitational effects might prevent the energy density from growing large enough to destroy the wormhole. Stephen Hawking conjectured that not only would the pileup of vacuum fluctuations still succeed in destroying the wormhole in quantum gravity, but also that the laws of physics would ultimately prevent &quot;any&quot; type of time machine from forming; this is the chronology protection conjecture.

Subsequent works in semiclassical gravity provided examples of spacetimes with closed timelike curves where the energy density due to vacuum fluctuations does not approach infinity in the region of spacetime outside the Cauchy horizon. However, in 1997 a general proof was found demonstrating that according to semiclassical gravity, the energy of the quantum field (more precisely, the expectation value of the quantum stress-energy tensor) must &quot;always&quot; be either infinite or undefined on the horizon itself. Both cases indicate that semiclassical methods become unreliable at the horizon and quantum gravity effects would be important there, consistent with the possibility that such effects would always intervene to prevent time machines from forming.

A definite theoretical decision on the status of the chronology protection conjecture would require a full theory of quantum gravity as opposed to semiclassical methods. There are also some arguments from string theory that seem to support chronology protection, but string theory is not yet a complete theory of quantum gravity. Experimental observation of closed timelike curves would of course demonstrate this conjecture to be false, but short of that, if physicists had a theory of quantum gravity whose predictions had been well-confirmed in other areas, this would give them a significant degree of confidence in the theory&#x27;s predictions about the possibility or impossibility of time travel.

Other proposals that allow for backwards time travel but prevent time paradoxes, such as the Novikov self-consistency principle, which would ensure the timeline stays consistent, or the idea that a time traveler is taken to a parallel universe while their original timeline remains intact, do not qualify as &quot;chronology protection&quot;.

<text>Gennady Borisovich &quot;Genndy&quot; Tartakovsky (; born January 17, 1970) is a Soviet-born American animator, screenwriter, film producer, and director. He is best known as the creator of various animated television series on Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, including &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Clone Wars&quot;, &quot;Sym-Bionic Titan&quot;, &quot;Primal&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

For Sony Pictures Animation, he directed the first three films and wrote the fourth film in the &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot; series and is currently directing two adult animated films for the studio, &quot;Fixed&quot; and &quot;Black Knight&quot;. Additionally, he was a pivotal crew member of &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; and worked on other series such as &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Tartakovsky is well known for his unique animation style, including fast-paced action, horror elements and minimal dialogue.

Throughout his career, Tartakovsky has won five Emmy Awards, three Annie Awards, one WAC Winner, one OIAF Award, and one Winsor McCay Award, among other nominations for his works.

==Early life==
Tartakovsky was born on January 17, 1970, in Moscow to Jewish parents. His father worked as a dentist for government officials and the Soviet Union national ice hockey team. Tartakovsky felt that his father was a very strict and old-fashioned man, but they had a close relationship. His mother, Miriam, was an assistant principal at a school. He has a brother, Alexander, who is two years older and a computer consultant in Chicago. Before coming to the United States, his family moved to Italy. There, Tartakovsky was first drawn to art, inspired by a neighbor&#x27;s daughter. Tartakovsky later commented, &quot;I remember, I was horrible at it. For the life of me, I couldn&#x27;t draw a circle&quot;.

Tartakovsky&#x27;s family moved to the United States when he was seven due to concerns about the effect of antisemitism on their children&#x27;s lives. The family originally settled in Columbus, Ohio and later moved to Chicago. He was greatly influenced by the comics he found there; his first purchase was an issue of &quot;Super Friends&quot;. Tartakovsky began attending Chicago&#x27;s Eugene Field Elementary School in the third grade. School was difficult because he was seen as a foreigner. He went on to attend Chicago&#x27;s prestigious Lane Tech College Prep High School and says he did not fit in until his sophomore year. When he was 16, his father died of a heart attack. Afterwards, Tartakovsky and his family moved to government-funded housing, and he began working while still attending high school.

To satisfy his ambitious family, who were encouraging him to be a businessman, Tartakovsky tried to take an advertising class, but signed up late and thereby had little choice over his classes. He was assigned to take an animation class and this led to his study of film at Columbia College Chicago before moving to Los Angeles to study animation at the California Institute of the Arts with his friend Rob Renzetti. There he met Craig McCracken. At CalArts, Tartakovsky directed and animated two student films, one of which became the basis for &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;. After two years at CalArts, Tartakovsky got a job at Lapiz Azul Productions in Spain on &quot;&quot;. There, &quot;he learned the trials of TV animation, labor intensive and cranking it out&quot;. While he was in Spain, his mother died of cancer.

==Career==
Craig McCracken acquired an art director job at Hanna-Barbera for the show &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot; and recommended hiring Rob Renzetti and Tartakovsky. This was a major turning point in Tartakovsky&#x27;s career. Hanna-Barbera let Tartakovsky, McCracken, Renzetti and Paul Rudish work in a trailer in the parking lot of the studio, and there Tartakovsky started creating his best-known works. &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; grew out of a student film with the same title that he produced while at the California Institute of the Arts. Tartakovsky co-wrote and pencilled the 25th issue of the &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; comic book series, titled &quot;Stubble Trouble&quot;, as well as several stories which are collected in the &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory Classics&quot; trade paperback. Additionally, he helped produce &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, co-directed several episodes and served as the animation director and a cinematographer for &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;; he co-wrote one of the franchise&#x27;s comics. Both &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; and &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; were nominated repeatedly for Emmy Awards.

Tartakovsky created the action-adventures series &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, which premiered in 2001; he also wrote comics for the franchise. The series won him an Emmy in the category of &quot;Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour)&quot; in 2004. &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas hired Tartakovsky to direct &quot;Star Wars: Clone Wars&quot; (2003â2005), an animated series taking place between &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; and &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. The series won three Emmy Awards: two for &quot;Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming One Hour or More)&quot; in 2004 and 2005, and another for &quot;Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation&quot; (for background designer Justin Thompson in 2005). Tartakovsky was not involved in the 2008 follow-up series.

In 2005, Tartakovsky was appointed creative president of Orphanage Animation Studios. In 2006, he was chosen as the director for a sequel to &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, but was replaced and the film was later scrapped. Tartakovsky served as animation director on the pilot episode of &quot;Korgoth of Barbaria&quot;, which aired on Adult Swim in 2006 but was not picked up as a series. He also directed a series of anti-smoking advertisements, one for Nicorette in 2006 and two for Niquitin in 2008. In 2009, Tartakovsky created a pilot entitled &quot;Maruined&quot; for Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;The Cartoonstitute&quot; program, which was not picked up. Around this time, Tartakovsky unsuccessful pitched Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige a superhero-themed series similar to &quot;Clone Wars&quot;. He then did some storyboarding work on Jon Favreau&#x27;s &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; (2010).
In 2009, it was announced that Tartakovsky would write and direct a &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; film from Fred Seibert&#x27;s Frederator Studios and J.Â J. Abrams&#x27; Bad Robot Productions. In June 2012, Tartakovsky said that he had a story to conclude the series and title character&#x27;s story, but the project had been shelved after Abrams moved on to direct &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Tartakovsky created a new series for Cartoon Network, &quot;Sym-Bionic Titan&quot;, between 2010 and 2011. He had hoped to expand on the initial season, but it was not renewed. On 7 April 2011, an animated prologue by Tartakovsky for the horror film &quot;Priest&quot; premiered online.

In early 2011, Tartakovsky moved to Sony Pictures Animation, where he made his feature film directing debut with &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot; (2012). In July 2012, he signed a long-term deal with Sony to develop and direct his own original projects. In June 2012, Sony announced that Tartakovsky was slated to direct an animated &quot;Popeye&quot; feature. On September 18, 2014, Tartakovsky revealed an &quot;animation test&quot;. In March 2015, Tartakovsky announced that despite the well-received test footage, he was no longer working on the project. He moved onto directing original story &quot;Can You Imagine?&quot;, announced in 2014, but it was cancelled.

Tartakovsky directed &quot;Hotel Transylvania 2&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot;, released in 2015. In December 2015, Adult Swim announced that Tartakovsky would return for a final season of &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, during which he stepped away from Sony Pictures Animation. When the series finished airing in 2017, Tartakovsky returned to Sony and directed &quot;Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation&quot; (2018). After its financial success, two original projects were announced: an R-rated comedy called &quot;Fixed&quot; and an action-adventure film entitled &quot;Black Knight&quot;.

In May 2019, it was announced that Adult Swim had commissioned a new series from Tartakovsky entitled &quot;Primal&quot;, which is about &quot;a caveman at the dawn of evolution ... [and a] dinosaur on the brink of extinction&quot;. It began airing on 7 October 2019.

On May 11, 2020, it was announced that Tartakovsky&#x27;s &quot;Popeye&quot; project was being revived by King Features Syndicate, with T. J. Fixman writing the script. Tartakovsky later clarified that he was not working on it yet and funding was still needed, saying that if he had the time he would do it. In mid-2022, an animatic for the film was leaked online and subsequently taken down.

Tartakovsky was involved in the development of the video game &quot;Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time&quot;, which was released on August 21, 2020. On 28 October, a new series by him called &quot;Unicorn: Warriors Eternal&quot; was announced; it focuses on a group of teen heroes, drawing inspiration from world mythology, and has been billed as all-ages animation. It was produced by Cartoon Network Studios and aired on Cartoon Network and HBO Max as part of an attempt by WarnerMedia to reach a broader range of the &quot;older kid and tween market.&quot; This was confirmed in a February 2021 announcement which mentioned the series. Tartakovsky described the project as an &quot;extension of everything that I&#x27;ve done from &quot;Dexter&quot; to &quot;Powerpuff&quot; to &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;. It&#x27;s all those ideas that we practiced, that sometimes were successful, sometimes not as much&quot;.

On June 15, 2022, Tartakovsky signed a cross-studio overall deal with Cartoon Network Studios and Warner Bros. Animation that lets him develop, create and produce animated programs for a variety of platforms, either with original characters or with a Warner Bros. Discovery IP. Sam Register, president of both companies, said &quot;Genndy is a true visionary who embodies the creator spirit of Cartoon Network Studios. As he continues to push the boundaries of storytelling and animation, we are excited to have a front row seat both here and now also at Warner Bros. Animation.&quot;

On March 30, 2023, it was announced that Tartakovskyâs show &quot;&quot; was moved to Adult Swim, which premiered on the programming block on May 1, 2023. On April 25, 2023, he stated that he had no intention of developing a &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; reboot after the death of Christine Cavanaugh, the original voice of Dexter.

==Personal life==
In 2000, Tartakovsky married Dawn David. As of 2017, he had three children.

<doc id="645797" wikidata="Q2095862" url="?curid=645797" title="Steven Isserlis">
<text>Steven John Isserlis (born 19 December 1958) is a British cellist. An acclaimed soloist, chamber musician, educator, writer and broadcaster, he is widely regarded as one of the leading musicians of his generation. He is also noted for his diverse repertoire and distinctive sound which is deployed with his use of gut strings.

Isserlis is the recipient of numerous awards including the Royal Philharmonic Society Music Award in 1993, the Robert Schumann Prize of the City of Zwickau in 2000, and both the Wigmore Hall Medal and GlashÃ¼tte Original Music Festival Award in 2017. His recordings have garnered two Gramophone Awards, a Classical BRIT Award, a BBC Music Magazine Award, and two Grammy Award nominations among others. He is also one of the only two living cellists inducted into the Gramophone Hall of Fame. 

Isserlis currently plays on the 1726 &quot;Marquis de Corberon&quot; cello made by Antonio Stradivari on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. 

==Early life and education==
Isserlis was born into a musical family in London. His mother was a piano teacher, and his father was a keen amateur musician. One of his sisters Annette is a viola player, and his other sister Rachel is a violinist. Isserlis has described how &quot;playing music, playing together&quot;, was an integral part of his early family life. His grandfather, Julius Isserlis, who was a Russian Jew, was one of 12 musicians allowed to leave Russia in the 1920s to promote Russian culture, but he never returned.

On the &quot;Midweek&quot; programme in January 2014, Isserlis revealed that on arrival in Vienna in 1922, his pianist grandfather and father found a flat, but the 102-year-old landlady refused to take in a musician, because her aunt had a previous musician tenant who was noisy and would spit on the floorâthis tenant was Ludwig van Beethoven.

Isserlis went to the City of London School, which he left at the age of 14 to move to Scotland to study under the tutelage of Jane Cowan. From 1976 to 1978 Isserlis studied at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music with Richard Kapuscinski. Ever since his youth Daniil Shafran has been his cello hero, of whom Isserlis has described how &quot;his vibrato, his phrasing, his rhythm all belonged to a unique whole... he was incapable of playing one note insincerely; his music spoke from the soul.&quot;

The name Isserlis is one of many European variations of the Hebrew name &#x27;Israel&#x27;.

==Career==
Isserlis&#x27;s major career breakthrough came in 1988, when he asked John Tavener to write a work for cello and orchestra. The result of this was &quot;The Protecting Veil&quot;, and Isserlis premiered it at the BBC Proms with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Oliver Knussen. The piece and also Isserlisâ subsequent recording of it
were met with both critical and public acclaim. The recording became a classical bestseller.

Since then, Isserlis has had an active solo career and regularly appears with many of the world&#x27;s leading ensembles. He has performed with orchestras such as the Berlin Philharmonic, Vienna Philharmonic, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, Tonhalle-Orchester ZÃ¼rich, Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, London Symphony Orchestra, London Philharmonic Orchestra, Philharmonia Orchestra, Boston Symphony Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, and the NHK Symphony Orchestra. He has also curated concert series for Wigmore Hall, 92nd Street Y in New York and the Salzburg Festival.

Isserlis is committed to authentic performance and also frequently performs with period instrument orchestras. He has performed Beethoven with fortepianist Robert Levin in Boston and London, and DvoÅÃ¡kâs Cello Concerto with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment with Sir Simon Rattle. He has also published several editions and arrangements, principally for Faber Music, and was an advisor on new editions of Beethoven&#x27;s cello works, as well as the cello concertos of DvoÅÃ¡k and Elgar. 

On the other end of the spectrum, Isserlis has premiered works by composers John Tavener, Lowell Liebermann, Carl Vine, David Matthews, John Woolrich, Wolfgang Rihm, Mikhail Pletnev and Thomas AdÃ¨s. He also commissioned a new completion of Prokofievâs Cello Concertino from the Udmurt musicologist Vladimir Blok, which was premiered in 1997 with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales conducted by Mark Wigglesworth.

Isserlis has presented a number of festivals with long-term collaborators such as Joshua Bell, Stephen Hough, Mikhail Pletnev, AndrÃ¡s Schiff, DÃ©nes VÃ¡rjon, Olli Mustonen, Tabea Zimmermann, and actors Barry Humphries and Simon Callow. He is artistic director of the International Musicians Seminar, Prussia Cove in West Cornwall, where he both performs and teaches.

==Instruments==

Isserlis currently plays on the 1726 &quot;Marquis de Corberon&quot; cello made by Antonio Stradivari on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. The instrument was previously owned by Zara Nelsova and Hugo Becker.

He also part-owns a Domenico Montagnana cello from 1740 and a Giovanni Battista Guadagnini cello from 1745, which he played exclusively from 1979 to 1998. Previously, he also performed on the &quot;De Munck-Feuermann Stradivarius&quot; which was loaned from the Nippon Music Foundation.

==Writings==
Isserlis is the author of two books for children on the lives of famous composers: the first is &quot;Why Beethoven Threw the Stew&quot; (Faber, 2001), and the second is &quot;Why Handel Waggled His Wig&quot; (Faber, 2006). He has also written three stories that have been set to music by Oscar-winning composer Anne Dudley. The first of the series &quot;Little Red Violin (and the Big, Bad Cello)&quot; received its first performance in New York in March 2007, followed by &quot;Goldipegs and the Three Cellos,&quot; and &quot;Cindercella&quot;.

In September 2016, Isserlis&#x27;s book targeted towards young musicians, &quot;Robert Schumann&#x27;s Advice to Young Musicians Revisited by Steven Isserlis&quot;, was published by Faber &amp; Faber.

In October 2021, Faber &amp; Faber published Isserlis&#x27;s book &quot;The Bach Cello Suites â A Companion&quot;, a volume entirely devoted to the history and music of Bach&#x27;s Suites for unaccompanied cello.

Recent releases included a disc in 2013 of DvoÅÃ¡k&#x27;s Cello Concerto with Daniel Harding and the Mahler Chamber Orchestra on Hyperion and Martinu&#x27;s complete cello sonatas with Olli Mustonen on the BIS label in 2014 which received a Grammy nomination.

<text>Highland Park is a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, located in the city&#x27;s Northeast region. It was one of the first subdivisions of Los Angeles and is inhabited by a variety of ethnic and socioeconomic groups.

==History==
The area was settled thousands of years ago by Paleo-Indians, and would later be settled by the Kizh. After the founding of Los Angeles in 1781, the Corporal of the Guard at the Mission San Gabriel ArcÃ¡ngel, Jose Maria Verdugo, was granted the 36,403 acre Rancho San Rafael which included present day Highland Park. Drought in the mid-19th century resulted in economic hardship for the Verdugo family, which eventually compelled them to auction off Rancho San Rafael in 1869 for $3,500 over an unpaid loan. The San Rafael tract was purchased by Andrew Glassell and Albert J. Chapman, who leased it out to sheep herders. In 1885, during the 1880s land boom, it was sold to George Morgan and Albert Judson, who combined it with other parcels they had purchased from the Verdugo family to create the Highland Park tract in 1886. Two rail lines were built to Highland Park, which later helped the town to survive the burst of the property bubble. Highland Park was annexed to Los Angeles in 1895. In the early 20th century, Highland Park and neighboring Pasadena became enclaves for artists and intellectuals who were adherents of the Arts and Crafts movement.

With the completion of Arroyo Seco Parkway in 1940, Highland Park began to experience white flight, losing residents to the Mid-Wilshire district and newer neighborhoods in Temple City and in the San Fernando Valley. By the mid-1960s, it was becoming a largely Latino district. Mexican immigrants and their American-born children began owning and renting in Highland Park, with its schools and parks becoming places where residents debated over how to fight discrimination and advance civil rights.

In the final decades of the 20th century, portions of Highland Park suffered waves of gang violence as a consequence of the Avenues street gang claiming them and the adjacent neighborhood of Glassell Park as its territory. At the beginning of the 21st century, then-City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo, a Highland Park native, intensified efforts to rid Northeast Los Angeles of the Avenues. In 2006, four members of the gang were convicted of violating federal hate crime laws. In June 2009, police launched a major raid against the gang, rooting out many leaders of the gang with a federal racketeering indictment, demolishing the gang&#x27;s Glassell Park stronghold. Law enforcement, coupled with community awareness efforts such as the annual Peace in the Northeast March, have led to a drastic decrease in violent crime in the 2010s.

In the early 2000s, relatively low rents and home prices, as well as Highland Park&#x27;s pedestrian-friendly streets and proximity to Downtown Los Angeles attracted people of greater affluence than had previously been typical, as well as a reversal of the white flight from previous decades. Of special interest were the district&#x27;s surviving Craftsman homes. Similar to Echo Park and Eagle Rock, Highland Park has experienced rapid gentrification. The topic of Highland Park&#x27;s rapid neighborhood changes has garnered national and international attention.

In the 2010s, Highland Park experienced significant job growth, especially with businesses along Figueroa Street and York Boulevard. Its educational, health, and social service careers also developed robustly during this period. However, most workers employed in Highland Park do not live there but commute from surrounding areas instead. The benefits of Highland Park&#x27;s 21st century economic revitalization have been experienced unevenly, bypassing many of the areaâs longtime Latino residents.


==Geography and climate==
Highland Parkâs boundaries are roughly the Arroyo Seco Parkway (California Route 110) on the southeast, Pasadena on the northeast, Oak Grove Drive on the north, South Pasadena on the east, and Avenue 51 on the west. Primary thoroughfares include York Boulevard and Figueroa Street.

Highland Park sits within the Northeast Los Angeles region along with Mount Washington, Cypress Park, Glassell Park, and Eagle Rock.

==Demographics==

The 2000 U.S. census counted 56,566 residents in the 3.42-square-mile neighborhoodâan average of 16,835 people per square mile. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 60,841. The median age for residents was 28.

The ethnic composition of Highland Park in 2000 was 72.4% Latino, 11.3% Non-Hispanic White, 11.2% Asian, 8.4% Black, and others, 2.6%. Among the 45% of residents born abroad, Mexico and El Salvador were the most common countries of origin. Mexican and German were the most common ancestries.

The median household income in 2008 dollars was $45,478, and 59% of households earned $40,000 or less. The average household size was 3.3 people. Renters occupied 60.9% of the housing units.

The percentage of never-married men was 41%. The 2000 census found that 21% of families were headed by single parents. There were 1,942 military veterans in 2000, or 4.9% of the population.

According to the 2020 United States census, the ethnic composition of Highland Park in 2020 was 58.7% Latino, 21.8% Non-Hispanic White, 13.4% Asian, 1.8% Black, and 4.3% others. Overall, the population of Highland Park decreased by 7% between 2010 and 2020.

Highland Park was served by a series of public libraries starting in 1890. It housed a collection of 50 books at the now demolished Miller&#x27;s Hall, formerly located on York Boulevard between Avenues 63 and 64. As the library&#x27;s collection grew, it was moved to other locations along nearby Avenue 64 in order to accommodate. A grant from Andrew Carnegie made possible a purpose-built facility which eventually became the original Arroyo Seco Library. Its location was decided upon in 1911 as a compromise between the competing residential centers of the district, as well in order to adhere to the stipulations of the grant. The library was opened in 1914.

On October 17, 1960, a newly constructed Arroyo Seco Library was opened to the public, replacing the original building after 46 years of service. Designed by architect John Landon, the second Arroyo Seco Library was the base of operations for the entire northeast region of the Los Angeles Public Library system. It also was equipped with rooftop parking which had access to the library&#x27;s front door, a feature that was first of its kind among public libraries in the United States. This building would itself be replaced by another, modernized facility in 2003.

==Religion==
Highland Park is home to a wide array of religious practitioners. The St. Ignatius Church has been the house of worship for followers of Roman Catholicism in the district since the early 20th century. Originally located on Avenue 52, the church was moved to its present location on the corner of Avenue 60 and Monte Vista Street in 1915.

Temple Beth Israel of Highland Park and Eagle Rock was founded in Highland Park in 1923 and constructed its building in 1930. It is the second oldest synagogue in Los Angeles still operating in its original location, after the Wilshire Boulevard Temple (built in 1929).

<doc id="645839" wikidata="Q1365309" url="?curid=645839" title="Glioma">
<text>A glioma is a type of primary tumor that starts in the glial cells of the brain or spinal cord. They are malignant but some are extremely slow to develop. Gliomas comprise about 30 percent of all brain tumors and central nervous system tumors, and 80 percent of all malignant brain tumors.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of gliomas depend on which part of the central nervous system (CNS) is affected. A brain glioma can cause headaches, vomiting, seizures, and cranial nerve disorders as a result of increased intracranial pressure. Also, different cognitive impairments can arise as a sign of tumor growth. A glioma of the optic nerve can cause vision loss. Spinal cord gliomas can cause pain, weakness, or numbness in the extremities. Gliomas do not usually metastasize by the bloodstream, but they can spread via the cerebrospinal fluid and cause &quot;drop metastases&quot; to the spinal cord. Complex visual hallucinations have been described as a symptom of low-grade glioma.

A child who has a subacute CNS disorder that produces cranial nerve abnormalities (especially of cranial nerve VII and the lower bulbar nerves), long-tract signs, unsteady gait secondary to spasticity, and some behavioral changes is most likely to have a pontine glioma.

==Causes==
===Hereditary disorders===
The exact causes of gliomas are not known. Hereditary disorders such as neurofibromatoses (type 1 and type 2) and tuberous sclerosis complex are known to predispose to their development. Different oncogenes can cooperate in the development of gliomas.

===Radiation===
The best-known risk factor is exposure to ionizing radiation, and CT scan radiation is an important cause. The dose-response for the relationship between low-dose ionising radiation and glioma risk is a risk increase of 55% per 100 milligray of radiation. A link between gliomas and electromagnetic radiation from cell phones has not been conclusively proven. It was considered possible, though several large studies have found no conclusive evidence, as summarized by the NIH&#x27;s National Cancer Institute review of the topic and its numerous citations, and the FCC. However, further research is still being pursued to obtain more robust evidence and verify that there is no relationship (the NIH&#x27;s National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences most recent press release discussed an ongoing study showing mildly positive results, although it appears there may have been issues with the control group dying prematurely).

===Infection with cytomegalovirus===
Some studies have reported that glioblastomas are infected with cytomegalovirus, with suggestions that this may speed the development of tumors. However, this is a controversial opinion, with recent in-depth studies failing to find an association between viral infection and glioma growth. There is also evidence that previous studies may have been impacted by false-positive antibody staining artifacts.

===Farming===

Studies have shown that farmers have higher rates of gliomas compared to the general population. In a 2021 meta-analysis, 40 of 52 studies since 1998 reported positive associations between farming and brain cancer with effect estimates ranging from 1.03 to 6.53, of which 80% are gliomas. Livestock farming was associated with a greater risk compared with crop farming. Farmers with documented exposure to pesticides had greater than a 20% elevated risk of brain cancer The TRACTOR project study, including 1017 brain tumors among 1 036 069 farm managers, published in 2022, showed an increased risk of glioma in pig farming (HR = 2.28), crop farming (HR = 1.28) and fruit arboriculture (HR = 1.72)

===Other causes===
Data show that architects, surveyors, retail workers, butchers, and engineers have higher rates of gliomas.

===Inherited polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes===
Germ-line (inherited) polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes &quot;ERCC1&quot;, &quot;ERCC2&quot; (&quot;XPD&quot;) and &quot;XRCC1&quot; increase the risk of glioma. This indicates that altered or deficient repair of DNA damage contributes to the formation of gliomas. DNA damages are a likely major primary cause of progression to cancer in general. Excess DNA damages can give rise to mutations through translesion synthesis. Furthermore, incomplete DNA repair can give rise to epigenetic alterations or epimutations. Such mutations and epimutations may provide a cell with a proliferative advantage which can then, by a process of natural selection, lead to progression to cancer.

Epigenetic repression of DNA repair genes is often found in progression to sporadic glioblastoma. For instance, methylation of the DNA repair gene &quot;MGMT&quot; promoter was observed in 51% to 66% of glioblastoma specimens. In addition, in some glioblastomas, the MGMT protein is deficient due to another type of epigenetic alteration. MGMT protein expression may also be reduced due to increased levels of a microRNA that inhibits the ability of the &quot;MGMT&quot; messenger RNA to produce the MGMT protein. Zhang et al. found, in the glioblastomas without methylated &quot;MGMT&quot; promoters, that the level of microRNA miR-181d is inversely correlated with protein expression of MGMT and that the direct target of miR-181d is the &quot;MGMT&quot; mRNA 3&#x27;UTR (the three prime untranslated region of &quot;MGMT&quot; messenger RNA).

Epigenetic reductions in expression of another DNA repair protein, &quot;ERCC1&quot;, were found in an assortment of 32 gliomas. For 17 of the 32 (53%) of the gliomas tested, ERCC1 protein expression was reduced or absent. In the case of 12 gliomas (37.5%) this reduction was due to methylation of the &quot;ERCC1&quot; promoter. For the other 5 gliomas with reduced ERCC1 protein expression, the reduction could have been due to epigenetic alterations in microRNAs that affect &quot;ERCC1&quot; expression.

When expression of DNA repair genes is reduced, DNA damages accumulate in cells at a higher than normal level, and such excess damages cause increased frequencies of mutation. Mutations in gliomas frequently occur in either &quot;isocitrate dehydrogenase&quot; (&quot;IDH&quot;) &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; genes. One of these mutations (mostly in &quot;IDH1&quot;) occurs in about 80% of low grade gliomas and secondary high-grade gliomas. Wang et al. pointed out that &quot;IDH1&quot; and &quot;IDH2&quot; mutant cells produce an excess metabolic intermediate, 2-hydroxyglutarate, which binds to catalytic sites in key enzymes that are important in altering histone and DNA promoter methylation. Thus, mutations in &quot;IDH1&quot; and &quot;IDH2&quot; generate a &quot;DNA CpG island methylator phenotype or CIMP&quot; that causes promoter hypermethylation and concomitant silencing of tumor suppressor genes such as DNA repair genes &quot;MGMT&quot; and &quot;ERCC1&quot;. On the other hand, Cohen et al. and Molenaar et al. pointed out that mutations in &quot;IDH1&quot; or &quot;IDH2&quot; can cause increased oxidative stress. Increased oxidative damage to DNA could be mutagenic. This is supported by an increased number of DNA double-strand breaks in &quot;IDH1&quot;-mutated glioma cells. Thus, &quot;IDH1&quot; or &quot;IDH2&quot; mutations act as driver mutations in glioma carcinogenesis, though it is not clear by which role they are primarily acting. A study, involving 51 patients with brain gliomas who had two or more biopsies over time, showed that mutation in the &quot;IDH1&quot; gene occurred prior to the occurrence of a &quot;p53&quot; mutation or a 1p/19q loss of heterozygosity, indicating that an &quot;IDH1&quot; mutation is an early driver mutation.

==Pathophysiology==
High-grade gliomas are highly vascular tumors and have a tendency to infiltrate diffusely. They have extensive areas of necrosis and hypoxia. Often, tumor growth causes a breakdown of the bloodâbrain barrier in the vicinity of the tumor. As a rule, high-grade gliomas almost always grow back even after complete surgical excision, so are commonly called recurrent cancer of the brain.

Conversely, low-grade gliomas grow slowly, often over many years, and can be followed without treatment unless they grow and cause symptoms. 

Several acquired (not inherited) genetic mutations have been found in gliomas. Tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53) is mutated early in the disease. p53 is the &quot;guardian of the genome&quot;, which, during DNA and cell duplication, makes sure the DNA is copied correctly and destroys the cell (apoptosis) if the DNA is mutated and cannot be fixed. When p53 itself is mutated, other mutations can survive. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), another tumor suppressor gene, is itself lost or mutated. Epidermal growth factor receptor, a growth factor that normally stimulates cells to divide, is amplified and stimulates cells to divide too much. Together, these mutations lead to cells dividing uncontrollably, a hallmark of cancer. In 2009, mutations in &quot;IDH1&quot; and&quot; IDH2&quot; were found to be part of the mechanism and associated with a less favorable prognosis.

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===

====By type of cell====
Gliomas are named according to the specific type of cell with which they share histological features, but not necessarily from which they originate. The main types of glioma are:
* Ependymomas: ependymal cells
* Astrocytomas: astrocytes (glioblastoma multiforme is a malignant astrocytoma and the most common primary brain tumor among adults).
* Oligodendrogliomas: oligodendrocytes
* Brainstem glioma: develop in the brain stem
* Optic nerve glioma: develop in or around the optic nerve
* Chordoid glioma, a rare low-grade tumor of the third ventricle
* Mixed gliomas, such as oligoastrocytomas, contain cells from different types of glia

====By grade====
Gliomas are further categorised according to their grade, which is determined by pathologic evaluation of the tumor. The neuropathological evaluation and diagnostics of brain tumor specimens is performed according to WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System.
* Biologically benign gliomas [WHO grade I] are comparatively low risk and can be removed surgically depending on their location
* Low-grade gliomas [WHO grade II] are well-differentiated (not anaplastic); these tend to exhibit benign tendencies and portend a better prognosis for the patient. However, they have a uniform rate of recurrence and increase in grade over time so should be classified as malignant.
* High-grade [WHO grades IIIâIV] gliomas are undifferentiated or anaplastic; these are malignant and carry a worse prognosis. Despite being classified as a high-grade glioma, infant-type hemispheric gliomas have relatively good clinical outcomes, yet they endure significant deficits, making them good candidates for therapy de-escalation and trials of molecular targeted therapy.

Of numerous grading systems in use, the most common is the World Health Organization (WHO) grading system for astrocytoma, under which tumors are graded from I (least advanced diseaseâbest prognosis) to IV (most advanced diseaseâworst prognosis).

====By location====
Gliomas can be classified according to whether they are above or below a membrane in the brain called the tentorium. The tentorium separates the cerebrum (above) from the cerebellum (below).
* The supratentorial is above the tentorium, in the cerebrum, and mostly found in adults (70%).
* The infratentorial is below the tentorium, in the cerebellum, and mostly found in children (70%).
* The pontine tumors are located in the pons of the brainstem. The brainstem has three parts (pons, midbrain, and medulla); the pons controls critical functions such as breathing, making surgery on these extremely dangerous.

===Integrated diagnosis===

The modern approach to the diagnosis of diffuse gliomas takes mainly the histopathology and molecular profile into account. Tissue specimens obtained through biopsy sampling in patients with diffuse gliomas are routinely assessed by immunohistochemistry for the presence of R132H-mutant IDH1 and loss of nuclear ATRX. In patients aged &gt;55 years with a histologically typical glioblastoma, without a pre-existing lower grade glioma, with a non-midline tumor location and with retained nuclear ATRX expression, immunohistochemical negativity for IDH1 R132H suffices for the classification as IDH-wild-type glioblastoma. In all other instances of diffuse gliomas, a lack of IDH1 R132H immunopositivity should be followed by IDH1 and IDH2 DNA sequencing to detect or exclude the presence of non-canonical mutations. IDH-wild-type diffuse astrocytic gliomas without microvascular proliferation or necrosis should be tested for EGFR amplification, TERT promoter mutation and a +7/â10 cytogenetic signature as molecular characteristics of IDH-wild-type glioblastomas. In addition, the presence of histone H3.3 G34R/V mutations should be assessed by immunohistochemistry or DNA sequencing to identify H3.3 G34-mutant diffuse hemispheric gliomas, in particular in young patients with IDH-wild-type gliomas (such as those &lt;50 years of age with nuclear ATRX loss in tumour cells). Diffuse gliomas of the thalamus, brainstem or spinal cord should be evaluated for histone H3 K27M mutations and loss of nuclear K27-trimethylated histone H3 (H3K27me3) to identify H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline gliomas.

==Treatment==
Treatment for brain gliomas depends on the location, the cell type, and the grade of malignancy. Current treatment options include surgical removal, radiation (radiation therapy), and chemotherapy. In some cases, tumour treating fields (alternating electric field therapy), a recently developed technology, may be used.
Often, treatment is a combined approach, using surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. For many, treatment consists of just surgery, or even &quot;watchful waiting&quot; (waiting to see when an intervention is justified due to tumour progression). Doctors carefully balance the specifics of the patient&#x27;s tumour and the downsides of intervention, since there can be significant side effects from medical intervention, despite recent attempts to predict outcomes have been proposed.

Awake surgery can be performed to monitor for example language and other cognitive functions, as well as motor functions and vision. Awake surgery is known to improve extent of resection while perserving functions and exetent of resection is directly associated with survival in low-grade gliomas.

Radiation and chemotherapy remain the mainstays of treatment beyond surgery. Radiation therapy is delivered in the form of external beam radiation or the stereotactic approach using radiosurgery. Temozolomide is a common chemotherapy drug which can be administered easily in an outpatient setting and is able to cross the bloodâbrain barrier effectively.

There are a wide variety of novel treatments currently being tested in clinical trials, ranging from IDH inhibitors like Ivosidenib, to the recently approved Dendritic cell-based cancer vaccine approach. Treatment using immunotherapy is another promising research path that may help treat glioma in the near future. Experimental therapies like oncolytic viruses have shown potential therapeutic benefits in clinical trials (but have not been approved for use in non-experimental settings).

===Refractory disease===
For recurrent high-grade glioblastoma, recent studies have taken advantage of angiogenic blockers such as bevacizumab in combination with conventional chemotherapy, with encouraging results.

===Relative effectiveness===
A 2017 meta-analysis compared surgical resection versus biopsy as the initial surgical management option for a person with a low-grade glioma. Results show the evidence is insufficient to make a reliable decision. The relative effectiveness of surgical resection compared to biopsy for people with malignant glioma (high-grade) is unknown.

For high-grade gliomas, a 2003 meta-analysis compared radiotherapy with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. It showed a small but clear improvement from using chemotherapy with radiotherapy. A 2019 meta-analysis suggested that for people with less aggressive gliomas, radiotherapy may increase the risk of long term neurocognitive side effects. Whilst, evidence is uncertain on whether there are long term neurocognitive side effects associated with chemoradiotherapy.

Temozolomide is effective for treating Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) compared to radiotherapy alone. A 2013 meta-analysis showed that Temozolomide prolongs survival and delays progression, but is associated with an increase in side effects such as blood complications, fatigue, and infection. For people with recurrent GBM, when comparing temozolomide with chemotherapy, there may be an improvement in the time-to-progression and the person&#x27;s quality of life, but no improvement in overall survival, with temozolomide treatment. Evidence suggests that for people with recurrent high-grade gliomas who have not had chemotherapy before, there are similar survival and time-to-progression outcomes between treatment with temozolomide or the chemotherapy multidrug known as PCV (procarvazine, lomustine and vincristine).

A mutational analysis of 23 initial low-grade gliomas and recurrent tumors from the same patients has challenged the benefits and usage of Temozolomide. The study showed that when lower-grade brain tumors of patients are removed and patients are further treated with Temozolomide, 6 out of 10 times the recurrent tumors were more aggressive and acquired alternative and more mutations. As one of the last authors, Costello, stated &quot;They had a 20- to 50-fold increase in the number of mutations. A patient who received surgery alone who might have had 50 mutations in the initial tumor and 60 in the recurrence. But patients who received TMZ might have 2,000 mutations in the recurrence.&quot; Further, new mutations were verified to carry known signatures of Temozolomide induced mutations. The research suggests that Temozolomide for the treatment of certain brain tumors should be thoroughly thought. Unjudicious usage of Temozolomide might lower the prognosis of the patients further, or increase their burden. Further understanding of the mechanisms of Temozolomide induced mutations and novel combination approaches could be promising.
===New Research Directions===
Newcastle disease has been noted to be helpful in some cases of glioma. Phase III trials with Newcastle Disease Virus Vaccine (MTH-68/H) are expected soon. Strains of Newcastle disease virus have also been used to create viral vector vaccine candidates against Ebola and Covid-19. Torticollis in fowl shows the level of avian severity.

==Prognosis==

Prognosis of gliomas is given in relation to what grade (as scored by the World Health Organization system) of tumour the patient presents with. Typically, any tumour presenting as above WHO grade I (i.e. a malignant tumour as opposed to a benign tumour) will have a prognosis resulting in eventual death, varying from years (WHO grade II/III) to months (WHO grade IV). Prognosis can also be given based on cellular subtype, which may also impact prognosis.

===Low grade===
For low-grade tumors, the prognosis is somewhat more optimistic. Patients diagnosed with a low-grade glioma are 17 times as likely to die as matched patients in the general population.
The age-standardized 10-year relative survival rate was 47% according to research in 2014. One study reported that low-grade oligodendroglioma patients have a median survival of 11.6 years; another reported a median survival of 16.7 years. Unfortunately, approximately 70% of low-grade (WHO grade-II) will progress to high-grade tumours within 5â10 years Grade II gliomas, despite often being labeled as benign, are considered a uniformly fatal illness.

===High grade===
This group comprises anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastoma multiforme. Whereas the median overall survival of anaplastic (WHO grade III) gliomas is approximately 3 years, glioblastoma multiforme has a poor median overall survival of c. 15 months.

Postoperative conventional daily radiotherapy improves survival for adults with good functional wellâbeing and high grade glioma compared to no postoperative radiotherapy. Hypofractionated radiation therapy has similar efficacy for survival as compared to conventional radiotherapy, particularly for individuals aged 60 and older with glioblastoma.

===Diffuse midline glioma===
Diffuse midline glioma (DMG), also known as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), primarily affects children, usually between the ages of 5 and 7. The median survival time with DIPG is under 12 months. Surgery to attempt tumour removal is usually not possible or advisable for pontine gliomas. By their very nature, these tumours invade diffusely throughout the brain stem, growing between normal nerve cells. Aggressive surgery would cause severe damage to neural structures vital for arm and leg movement, eye movement, swallowing, breathing, and even consciousness. Trials of drug candidates have been unsuccessful. The disease is primarily treated with radiation therapy alone.

===&quot;IDH1&quot; and &quot;IDH2-&quot;mutated glioma===
Patients with glioma carrying mutations in either &quot;IDH1&quot; or &quot;IDH2&quot; have a relatively favorable survival, compared with patients with glioma with wild-type &quot;IDH1/2&quot; genes. In WHO grade III glioma, &quot;IDH1/2&quot;-mutated glioma have a median prognosis of ~3.5 years, whereas &quot;IDH1/2&quot; wild-type glioma perform poor with a median overall survival of c. 1.5 years.

<text>Philippine literature is literature associated with the Philippines from prehistory, through its colonial legacies, and on to the present.

==Characteristics==
The

According to journalist Nena Jimenez, the most common and consistent element of Philippine literature is its short and quick yet highly interpersonal sentences, with themes of family, dogmatic love, and persistence. The use of commas, conjunctions, and a variation of English known as Filipino-English or Taglish are also most present in Philippine literature. Many of these elements used by Filipino writers had an impact in the history of literature as a whole.

==History==
===Precolonial period===
According to Filipino historian Teodoro Agoncillo, the ethnicity that had the richest history in terms of story-telling were the Ilocano people, whose nomadic lifestyle in the highlands bred stories of adventures far moreso than other Filipinos living in the lowlands. Ilocano used an improvised, versified, and at times impromptu, long epic poem called a &quot;dallot&quot;, delivered and narrated in a song-like manner. The most famous of these epics was the &quot;Biag ni Lamang&quot;.

Other forms of literature written by pre-colonial Ilocano were songs (&quot;kankanta&quot;), dances (&quot;salsala&quot;), poems (&quot;dandaniw&quot;), riddles (&quot;burburtia&quot;), proverbs (&quot;pagsasao&quot;), and lamentations (&quot;dung-aw&quot;). Other traditional Filipino epics by other ethnicities include the &quot;Hudhud ni Aliguyon&quot; of the Ifugao, &quot;Hinilawod&quot; of Panay, &quot;Ibalon&quot; from Bicol, and &quot;Darangen&quot; of the Maranao. During this time, different oral myths and folk tales were developed, eventually leading to their embeddement in Filipino culture, such as Ibong Adarna, Bernardo Carpio, Maria Makiling, and several creation myths.
The Ilocano people, according to Filipino historian Teodoro Agoncillo, had the most rich history in story-telling due to their nomadic lifestyle. They used improvised, versified, and sometimes impromptu epic poems called dallots, with the famous being the Biag ni Lamang. Other traditional Filipino epics included Hudhud ni Aliguyon, Hinilawaod, Ibalon and Darangen.

===Spanish period===

The Spanish colonization of the Philippine islands led to the introduction of European literary traditions. Many of these were influenced heavily by the Spanish language and the Catholic faith. These traditions include poetry such as &quot;tanaga&quot;, &quot;ladino&quot;, &quot;corridos&quot;, and awit; religious dramas such as &quot;moriones&quot;, &quot;santacruzan&quot;, &quot;panunuluyan&quot; and &quot;senakulo&quot;; and secular dramas like &quot;comedia&quot;, &quot;duplo&quot;, and &quot;karagatan&quot;. Many Filipino authors rose to prominence during this time, such as Francisco Balagtas, the author of &quot;Florante at Laura&quot; (1838); and Huseng Sisiw, author of &quot;Singsing ng Pagibig&quot;. Balagtas&#x27;s title, which combines history, romance, and religion, became the premier Filipino story taught in schools nationwide. Another influential writer was Leona Florentino, the mother of Philippine women&#x27;s literature whose work catapulted feminism to the forefront of the revolution.

On December 1, 1846, the first daily newspaper, &quot;La Esperanza&quot;, was published in the country. Other early newspapers were &quot;La Estrella&quot; (1847), &quot;Diario de Manila&quot; (1848) and &quot;Boletin Oficial de Filipinas&quot; (1852). The first provincial newspaper was &quot;El Eco de Vigan&quot; (1884), which was issued in Ilocos. In Cebu City, &quot;El BoletÃ­n de CebÃº&quot; (&quot;The Bulletin of Cebu&quot;) was published in 1890. One of the most influential Spanish-language Filipino newspaper also include &quot;El Renacimiento&quot; (1901), printed in Manila by members of the Guerrero de Ermita family until the 1940s.

The Philippine Revolution brought a larger wave of nationalistic literary works. A bulk of the writers of the era were propagandists and revolutionaries who wanted either representation of the Filipino people or total independence from Spanish authority. These include the works of Ilustrados like Pedro Alejandro Paterno, who wrote the first novel written by a Filipino, &quot;NÃ­nay&quot; (1885); Graciano LÃ³pez Jaena and later on by Marcelo H. del Pilar, who edited and published the pro-Filipino newspaper &quot;La Solidaridad&quot; (1889); and the Philippine national hero, JosÃ© Rizal, who wrote two famous novels in Spanish, &quot;Noli Me TÃ¡ngere&quot; (1887) and &quot;El Filibusterismo&quot; (1891).

Spanish colonization of the Philippine islands introduced European literary traditions, including poetry, religious dramas, and secular dramas. Influential Filipino authors like Francisco Balagtas and Leona Florentino rose to prominence during this time. The first daily news paper, La Esperanza, was published in 1846, followed by La Estrella Dario de Manila, and Boletin Oficial de Filipinas. The Philippine revolution brought a wave of nationalistic literary works, with propagandists and revolutionaries advocating for Filipino representation or independence from Spanish authority. Illustrados like Pedro Alejandro Paterno, Graciano Lopez Jaena, Marcelo H. del Pilar, and Jose Rizal contributed to the development of Philippine literature.

===American period===

The American occupation and eventual colonization of the Philippines paved the way for newer styles and genres. Compared to the more rigid literature of the Spanish era, the American period saw the popularity of the &quot;free verse&quot; in the Philippines, allowing for flexible poetry, prose, and other wordcraft. The introduction of the English language was also of equal importance, as it became one of the most common languages that Filipino writers would use back then until today.

The first English novel written by a Filipino was &quot;The Child of Sorrow&quot; (1921) written by Zoilo Galang. The early writings in English were characterized by melodrama, unreal language, and unsubtle emphasis on local color. Short stories also gained popularity during this period with many serials and stories published independently or through newspapers. The most well-known was Manuel Arguilla and his anthology &quot;How My Brother Leon Brought Home a Wife and Other Short Stories&quot; (1940), which won first prize in the Commonwealth Literary Contest.

During this time, there was also a resurgence of interest in Filipino mythology and folklore, and many works concerning them would be published, with the most well-known being the many anonymous stories about the folk character &quot;Juan Tamad&quot; (1919). The level of poetry in the Philippines had also risen, with poet Jose Garcia Villa making impacts in poetry history for introducing the style of comma poetry and the &quot;reversed consonance rhyme scheme&quot;.

The American occupation and colonization of the Philippines led to the rise of &quot;free verse&quot; poetry, prose, and other genres. English became a common language for Filipino writers, with the first English novel written by a Filipino being the Child of Sorrow (1921). Short stories gained popularity, with Manuel Arguilla&#x27;s anthology How My Brother Leon Brought Home A Wife and other short stories winning prize in the Commonwealth Literary Contest. Filipino mythology and folklore also gained interest.

===Postwar Era===
As the Philippines gained its sovereignty from America, patriotism once again became a central theme in Filipino literature. Besides stories of Filipino mythology and history, there was also a boom in tales depicting the simple life of the common Filipino. These stories often took place in the countryside, and portrayed every day Filipino activities like church-going, farming, courting, and cockfighting. The most well-known example was the short story &quot;My Brotherâs Peculiar Chicken&quot; by Alejandro Roces. Other prominent writers during the mid-20th century were Carlos Bulosan, Nick Joaquin, Bienvenido Santos, Lualhati Bautista, and Rolando S. Rinio. 

Carlos Bulosan, in particular, published the novel &quot;America Is In The Heart&quot; (1946), which became one of the earliest glimpses and representations of the life of Asian-American immigrants in the West. F. Sionil Jose is also a similar author who tackled social injustice and elitism in his &quot;Rosales Saga&quot; (1973-1984). 

====Golden age of Philippine comics====
It was around this period as well that the golden age of Filipino comics and sequential art emerged. Many Filipino comic books, strips, and graphic novels soared in popularity, making names of writers and artists like Pablo S. Gomez, Mars Ravelo, Francisco V. Coching, Carlo J. Caparas and Gilda Olvidado.

===During the Marcos dictatorship===
Later on, political and protest literature became wildly present, especially during the Martial Law era. By this time, there became a focus on criticizing and satirizing the current status of the Philippines rather than just celebrating the nation like those before it. These works include the powerful &quot;Mga Ibong Mandaragit&quot; (1969) by Amado V. Hernandez and the &quot;Conjugal Dictatorship&quot; (1976) by Primitivo Mijares.

===Late 20th Century ===
The last decade and a half of the 20th century, after the ouster of the Marcos dictatorship by the civilian-led People Power Revolution of 1986, was characterized by rapid social and technological change, as Filipinos gained more access to the rest of the world. Some of the notable fiction from this period was strongly influenced by magic realism, including the works of CÃ©sar Ruiz Aquino, Alfred Yuson, and poet-fictionist Mario Gamalinda.

===21st century===
The rise of mass printing and digital technology led to better accessibility for Filipino authors who wanted to publish their work. The internet had become a revolutionary tool for Filipino authors to reach readers outside of the Philippines. Publishing houses like PSICOM flourished, and there was a rise in popularity of self-publishers and web fiction sites like Wattpad. The first title to achieve this was Danny R.âs webnovel &quot;Diary ng Pangit&quot; (2013).

Around this time, several Filipinos began to dabble into current literary trends, tackling modern issues of diversity and mental health, while also introducing international readers to Filipino culture. Two of the most popular Filipino writers of the early 21st century include Rin Chupeco, who made a name for herself publishing Young Adult fiction, many of which were inspired by Filipino mythology from Maria Makiling to the Mangkukulam; and Louis Bulaong, who is an important figure in the GameLit genre, and one who popularized the use of international Filipino terms like âkiligâ in his stories.

The 21st century also saw the rise in popularity of many Filipina writers. One of the most famous is Ivy Alvarez, a Filipino-Australian who gained acclaim for her collection of poets entitled &quot;Disturbance&quot; (2013), which contained themes of domestic abuse. Another writer is Yvette Fernandez, a childrenâs book author from Summit Media whose books tackled history and morality. Other contemporary Filipina writers include Marites Vitug and Merlie M. Alunan.

<text>Gaby Roslin (born 12 July 1964) is an English television and radio presenter who rose to fame co-presenting &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; on Channel 4 between 1992 and 1996. Roslin also presented the &quot;Children in Need&quot; charity telethons on the BBC between 1995 and 2004.

She presented the weekly the National Lottery Draws on Saturday evenings and co-presented the Channel 5 daytime programme &quot;The Saturday Show&quot; alongside Matt Allwright. In 2023 she was a presenter on the BBC One programme 
&quot;Morning Live&quot;.

== Early life ==
Roslin, daughter of former BBC radio announcer Clive Roslin, was born and raised in London. Her family is Jewish. She attended the Guildford School of Acting.

== Career ==
=== Television ===
Roslin began as a children&#x27;s television presenter. She first presented &quot;Hippo&quot; on the Superchannel and then &quot;Motormouth&quot; on ITV from 1989 until 1992. At the end of that show, she was approached by Planet 24 to present their new early-morning programme &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; alongside Chris Evans on Channel 4. Evans left the show in 1994 and Roslin continued with his replacement, Mark Little, until 1996. Following her departure, she hosted &quot;The Gaby Roslin Show&quot; for Channel 4.

Roslin presented &quot;Children in Need&quot; from 1995 until 2004. Other BBC presenting roles included &quot;The Real Holiday Show&quot;,
&quot;City Hospital&quot;, &quot;Watchdog Healthcheck&quot;, &quot;Whatever You Want&quot; and &quot;A Question of TV&quot;. She was one of several presenters for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;2000 Today&quot;, a 28-hour-long programme to see in the year 2000. She was the only presenter to stay on air for the duration. In 2002, Roslin briefly returned to breakfast television as a roving reporter for &quot;Breakfast&quot;.

In 2003, Roslin switched networks to Five (now Channel 5) where she co-hosted &quot;The Terry and Gaby Show&quot; with Terry Wogan. The magazine format could not compete with ITV&#x27;s similar, long-established &quot;This Morning&quot; and the show ended after 200 episodes on 26 March 2004.

In 2004, Roslin teamed up with Terry Wogan to co-host the first edition of &quot;Eurovision â Making Your Mind Up&quot;, the revamped successor to &quot;A Song for Europe&quot;, the UK&#x27;s long-running pre-selection show for the Eurovision Song Contest. In 2005, she was replaced by Natasha Kaplinsky.

She co-presented the daytime programme &quot;Solution Street&quot; with Ben Shephard. In February 2006, she took part in the BBC celebrity duet show &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot;, where she partnered ABC frontman Martin Fry.

Roslin frequently appeared on the ITV lifestyle programme &quot;This Morning&quot; as a newspaper reviewer, often starring with her former radio co-host Paul Ross.

From 2014 until 2016, she presented &quot;The National Lottery Draws&quot; live on BBC One. For three weeks in March 2014, Roslin presented a daily programme entitled &quot;Sport Relief&#x27;s Top Dog&quot; on BBC Two.

In 2014, Roslin co-presented the third series of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Food Inspectors&quot; programme with Matt Allwright and Chris Hollins.

On 25 January 2015, Roslin took part in celebrity talent show &quot;Get Your Act Together&quot;. Since 2015, Roslin has been a regular stand-in presenter on the ITV Breakfast show &quot;Lorraine&quot;.

In October 2015, it was announced that Roslin would co-present Channel 5&#x27;s daytime programme &quot;The Saturday Show&quot;, alongside Matt Barbet. Barbet was replaced by Matt Allwright in July 2016. In 2018, she co-presented &quot;Shop Smart: Save Money&quot; with Fiona Phillips, a series for Channel 5.

=== Stage ===
In 2004, Roslin appeared in a national tour of the Moira Buffini play &quot;Dinner&quot;. The following year she toured in a stage version of &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot;, and later in the year she sang and danced in the London stage production of &quot;Chicago&quot;.

=== Radio ===
Roslin sat in for Alan Carr on BBC Radio 2 on 15 and 22 August 2009 with Patrick Kielty and joined Carr to present a Christmas edition of his show on 24 December 2009. She was also a regular stand-in on BBC Radio London, covering on occasions for Vanessa Feltz and JoAnne Good. On 11 January 2010, Roslin permanently replaced Good as co-host (with Paul Ross) of the BBC London 94.9 breakfast show and remained until January 2013. She was given her own weekly Saturday show, live from noon until 2:00Â pm, in January 2013. A year later, she was moved to an extended Sunday afternoon show. In October 2021 Roslin sat in for Chris Evans on the &#x27;Chris Evans Breakfast Show&#x27; on Virgin Radio UK, alongside Ricky Wilson (of the Kaiser Chiefs).

In 2018 Roslin presented &quot;Gaby&#x27;s Talking Pictures&quot;, a panel show for BBC Radio 4, also featuring team captains Ellie Taylor and John Thomson.

Since 2023, Roslin has been a frequent cover presenter for various shows on BBC Radio 2, mainly covering for Zoe Ball on the station&#x27;s flagship breakfast show.

On 25th January 2025, Roslin is joining Magic Radio doing Saturday Mornings from 10am to 1pm.

== Personal life ==
Roslin married musician Colin Peel in 1995; they divorced in 2004. They have a daughter. In December 2006, Roslin had another daughter, with David Osmon. The couple became engaged in March 2012 and married in a Jewish ceremony on 22 June 2013.

Roslin is teetotal.

<text>The Longmen Grottoes () or Longmen Caves are some of the finest examples of Chinese Buddhist art. Housing tens of thousands of statues of Shakyamuni Buddha and his disciples, they are located south of present-day Luoyang in Henan province, China. The images, many once painted, were carved as outside rock reliefs and inside artificial caves excavated from the limestone cliffs of the Xiangshan () and Longmenshan, running east and west. The Yi River () flows northward between them and the area used to be called Yique (). The alternative name of &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Gate Grottoes&quot; derives from the resemblance of the two hills that check the flow of the Yi River to the typical &quot;Chinese gate towers&quot; that once marked the entrance to Luoyang from the south.
There are as many as 100,000 statues within the 2,345 caves, ranging from to in height. The area also contains nearly 2,500 stelae and inscriptions, hence the name &quot;Forest of Ancient Stelae&quot;, as well as over sixty Buddhist pagodas. Situated in a scenic natural environment, the caves were dug from a stretch of cliff running along both banks of the river. 30% date from the Northern Wei and 60% from the Tang dynasty, caves from other periods accounting for less than 10% of the total. Starting with the Northern Wei dynasty in 493 AD, patrons and donors included emperors, Wu Zetian, members of the royal family, other rich families, generals, and religious groups.

In 2000 the site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List as &quot;an outstanding manifestation of human artistic creativity,&quot; for its perfection of an art form, and for its encapsulation of the cultural sophistication of Tang China.

== Geography ==
This complex is one of the three notable grottoes in China. The other two grottoes are the Yungang Caves near Datong in Shanxi Province, and the Mogao Caves near Dunhuang in Gansu Province. The valley formed by the Yi River enclosed by two hills ranges of Xiangshan (to the east) and Longmenshan (to the west) hills have steep slopes on the western and eastern slopes along the river. Yi is a north flowing tributary of the Luo River. The grottoes are formed in 1Â km of the stretch of this river and were carved on both banks, in limestone formations creating the Longmen Caves. Most of the work was done on the western bank, while the eastern bank caves, of smaller numbers, served as residences for the large groups of monks.

Within the approximately 1,400 caves, there are 100,000 statues, some of which are only high, while the largest Buddha statue is in height. There are also approximately 2500 stelae and 60 pagodas. The grottoes are located on both sides of the Yi River. Fifty large and medium-sized caves are seen on the west hill cliffs which are credited to the Northern, Sui, and Tang dynasties, while the caves on the east hill were carved entirely during the Tang dynasty. The plethora of caves, sculptures and pagodas in Longmen Grottoes depict a definite &quot;progression in style&quot; with the early caves being simple and well shaped with carvings of statues of Buddha and religious people. The change of style is more distinct in the Tang dynastic periods which are &quot;more complex and incorporate women and court figures as well&quot;. The caves have been numbered sequentially from north to south along the west bank of the Yi River. Entry to the caves is from the northern end.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The earliest history of the creation of Longmen Grottoes is traced to the reign of Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei dynasty when he shifted his capital to Luoyang from DÃ tÃ³ng; Luoyang&#x27;s symbolic value is borne by the fact that it served as the historic capital for 13 dynasties. The grottoes were excavated and carved with Buddhist subjects over the period from 493 AD to 1127 AD, in four distinct phases. The first phase started with the Northern Wei dynasty (493â534). The second phase saw slow development of caves as there was interruption due to strife in the region, between 524 and 626, during the reign of the Sui dynasty (581â618) and the early part of the Tang dynasty (618â907). The third phase, was during the reign of the Tang dynasty when Chinese Buddhism flourished and there was a proliferation of caves and carvings from 626 to the mid 8th century. The last phase, which was the fourth, was from the later part of the Tang dynastic rule extending to the Northern Song dynasty rule, which saw a decline in the creation of grottoes. It came to an end due to internecine war between the Jin and Yuan dynasties.

Guyangdong or the Shiku Temple, credited to Emperor Xiaowen, was the first cave temple to be built at the center of the southern floor of the West Hill. Emperor Xuanwu of Northern Wei followed up this activity and excavated three more caves, two in memory of his father, Emperor Xiaowen, and one in memory of his mother; all three caves are grouped under the title of the &quot;Three Binyang Caves&quot; (Binyangsandong), which were built by the emperor over a 24-year period. Over 30% of the caves seen now were built during this period.

In 527, the Huangfugong or Shikusi grottoes, a major cave, was completed. It is a well conserved cave located to the south of the West Hill.

In 675, Fengxiansi Cave, on the southern floor of the West Hill was completed during the Tang dynasty rule. This marked the third phase of creation and the peak period of the gottoes&#x27; creation. It is estimated that 60% of the caves seen at Longmen came about in this period from 626 till 755. During this period, in addition to the caves which housed Buddha statues of various sizes, some Buddhist temples were also built in open spaces with scenic settings in the same complex. However, these are now mostly in ruins. During this phase, Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu Zetian were instrumental in intensifying the activity when they were ruling from Luyong.
=== Later history ===
During the period of 1368 to 1912, when two dynasties ruled in China, namely the Ming dynasty from 1368 to 1644, and the Qing dynasty from 1644 to 1912, there was cultural revival and the Longmen Grottoes received recognition both at the national and international level.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese looted the site and took many of the statues back to Japan. Many of these relics are now in Japanese museums. 

Vandalism occurred in the 1940s, a result of political unrest. With the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, the grottoes have been declared as protected area and are being conserved. The Constitution of China, under Article 22, which among other issues also provides for protection of the natural heritage sites, has been further defined under various legal instruments enacted to protect and conserve this cultural heritage of China.

The Longmen Relics Care Agency was established in 1953 under the Ministry of Culture. A 1954 site inventory was undertaken by the newly established Longmen Caves Cultural Relics Management and Conservation Office. The State Council declared the Longmen Grottoes as a national cultural monument needing special protection in 1961. In 1982, it was declared as one of the first group of scenic zones to be protected at the state level. The Management and Conservation Office was renamed the Longmen Grottoes Research Institute in 1990; and the People&#x27;s Government of Luoyang City became responsible for the management of the heritage monuments. The governing organization was renamed the Longmen Grottoes Research Academy in 2002.

During the Warring States period, the general Bai Qi of Qin once defeated the allied forces of Han and Wei at the site. The site was subjected to significant vandalism at several points in its history. Major artifacts were removed by Western collectors and souvenir hunters during the early 20th century. The heads of many statues were also destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Two murals taken from the grottoes are reported to be displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri.

== Panorama ==
== Grottoes ==

There are several major grottoes with notable displays of Buddhist sculptures and calligraphic inscriptions. Some of the main caves and the year when work began within them include: Guyang-dong (493), Binyang-dong (505), Lianhua-dong (520s), Weizi-dong (522), Shiku-si (520s), Weizi-dong (520s), Shisku (520s), Yaofang-dong (570), Zhaifu-dong (ca. 636), Huijian-dong (630s), Fahua-dong (650s), Fengxian-si (672), Wanfo-si (670-680s), Jinan-dong (684), Ganjing-si (684), and Leigutai-dong (684). The Guyang, Binyang, and Lianhua caves are horseshoe-shaped.

=== Guyangdong ===
Guyangdong, or Guyang Cave, or Old Sun Cave, is recorded as the oldest Longmen cave with carvings in the Northern Wei style. It is also the largest cave, located in the central part of the west hill. It was carved under the orders of Emperor Xiaowen. The earliest carving in this limestone cave has been now dated at 478 AD, during the period when Emperor Xiaowen is thought to have been moving his capital from Datong to Luoyang. The Buddhist statues in the niches of this cave are very well sculpted. Also found here are 600 inscriptions in fine calligraphy of writings in the Northern Wei style. Many of the sculptures inside the cave were contributed by royalty; religious groups supported this activity. The cave has three very large images â the central image is of Sakyamuni Buddha with Bodhisattvas on either side. The features of the images are indicative of the Northern Wei style, typically of slim and emaciated figures. There are about 800 inscriptions on the walls and in the niches inside the cave, the most in any cave in China. There are two rows of niches on the northern and southern walls of the cave, which house a very large number of images; the artists have recorded their names, the dates, and the reasons for carving them.

=== Binyang ===
Binyang has three caves, North Binyang Cave, Middle Binyang Cave and South Binyang Cave, of which the Middle Binyang Cave is the most prominent.
;Binyangzhongdong

Binyangzhongdong () or the Middle Binyang Cave, is carved in the Datong style on the west hill, on the northern floor. It was built by Emperor Xuanwu to commemorate his father Xiaowen, and also his mother. It is said that 800,000 workers created it over the period from 500 to 523. In the main wall of this cave, five very large Buddhist statues are carved all in Northern Wei style. The central statue is of Sakyamuni Buddha with four images of Bodhisattvas flanking it. Two side walls also have Buddha images flanked by Bodhisattva. The Buddhas, arranged in three groups in the cave, are representative of Buddhas of the past, the present, and the future. The canopy in the roof is designed as a lotus flower. There were two large bas-reliefs of imperial processions, that included Emperor Xiaowen, Empress Dowager Wenzhao, and the emperor&#x27;s late parents in worship. The reliefs were stolen completely in the mid-1930s. The emperor&#x27;s procession is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and two thirds of the empress&#x27;s is in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City. While a few statues are sculpted with &quot;long features, thin faces, fishtail robes and traces of Greek influence&quot;, others are in Tang period natural style and heavily built.

;Binyangnandong
Binyangnandong (), or the South Binyang Cave, has five very large images which were carved by Li Tai, the fourth son of Emperor Taizong of Tang, the first Tang Emperor. He made them in 641 AD in memory of his mother Empress Zhangsun. The central image in a serene appearance is that of Amitabha Buddha seated on a pedestal surrounded by Bodhisattvas, also serene looking in a blend of the Northern Wei and the Tang dynasty styles.

=== Fengxian ===

Fengxian, or Feng Xian Si (), or Li Zhi cave is the Ancestor Worshipping Cave, which is the largest of all caves carved on the west hill built between 672 and 676 for Empress Wu Zetian. The carvings are claimed to be the ultimate in architectural perfection of the Tang dynasty. The shrine inside the cave measures 39Â m x35m. It has the largest Buddha statue at the Longmen Grottoes. Of the nine huge carved statues, the highly impressive image of Vairocana Buddha is sculpted on the back wall of the Fengxian. The image is 17.14m high and has 2Â m long ears. An inscription at the base of this figure gives 676 as the year of carving. The Bodhisattva on the left of the main image of Buddha is decorated with a crown and pearls. Also shown is a divine person trampling an evil spirit. The main Vairocana image&#x27;s features are plumpish and of peaceful and natural expression. Each of the other large statues are carved with expressions matching their representative roles. These were carved at the orders of Empress Wu Zetian, and are considered uniquely representative of the Tang dynasty&#x27;s &quot;vigorous, elegant and realistic style.&quot; The huge Vairocana statue is considered as &quot;the quintessence of Buddhist sculpture in China.&quot;

The Vairocana statue also provides at its base the names of the artisans who worked here, the name of the Emperor Gaozong, who was the donor, and also honors Wu Zetian. It is said that Wu Zetian donated &quot;twenty-thousand strings of her rouge and powder money&quot; to complete this edifice. Hence, it is conjectured that the Vairocana Buddha was carved to resemble the Empress herself and termed a &quot;Chinese Mona Lisa, Venus or as the Mother of China&quot;. All the images here, which remain undamaged, project character and animation. Statues of Kasyapa and Ananda, the two principal disciples of Vairocana, and of two Bodhisattvas with crowns flank the main statue, in addition to numerous images of &quot;lokapalas (guardians or heavenly kings), dvarapalas (temple guards), flying devas and numerous other figures.&quot;

=== Others ===
;Huangfugong
Huangfugong, or Shikusi, a three-wall, three-niche cave, is situated south of the west hill, was carved out in 527. It was completed at one stretch as a single unit and is very well preserved. There are seven Buddhas carved on the lintel which give the appearance of a wood finish. Seven very large images are seen in the main hall with the Buddha image flanked by two Bodhisattvas and two disciples. Also seen are images of Buddhist groups in the niches of the cave. A very large design of a lotus flower is carved in the roof, flanked by eight musical apsaras (water spirits or nymphs). It was created by Huangfu Du, uncle of Empress Hu.
;Wan-fo-dung
Wan-fo-dung (&quot;Cave of Ten Thousand Buddhas&quot;ä¸ä½æ´), or Yung-lung-tung, was built in 680 by Gaozong and Wu Zetian. It houses 15,000 Buddhas carved in small niches, different from each other, with the smallest Buddha being in height.

;Yaofangdong
Yaofangdong (), or the Medical Prescription Cave, has small inscriptions of 140 medical prescriptions for a wide range of medical problems from the common cold to insanity. These are seen carved right at the entrance on both walls. These carvings are dated from the late Northern Wei period to the early Tang dynasty.

;Qianxisi

Reached by modern, concrete stairs up the face of a cliff, Qianxisi, or Hidden Stream Temple Cave, is a large cave on the northern edge of the west hill. Made during Gaozong&#x27;s reign (653â80), the cave has a statue of a huge, seated, early Tang Buddha (Amitabha Buddha), flanked by statues of the Bodhisattvas Avalokitesvara and Mahasthamaprapta. The statues are carved with a sophisticated expression typical of Tang style. It may have been sponsored by the Nanping princess, with the beneficiary being Gaozong, her recently deceased father.

;Lianhua
The Lianhua or the Lotus Flower Cave (), dated to 527, belongs to the Northern Wei period. The Grotto has a large lotus flower carved in high relief on its ceiling. Several small Buddhas are carved into the south wall. Also seen are shrines in the south and north wall in the niches.

;Laolong
The Laolong or the Old Dragon Cave () created during the Tang dynasty period, named after the Old Dragon Palace, has many niches dated to Gaozong&#x27;s reign.

== Temples ==

There are several temples at Longmen Grottoes. Some important ones include Xiangshan Temple, Bai Garden temple, and the Tomb of Bai Juyi. Others are Tongle temple, begun under Emperor Mingyuan; Lingyan and Huguo temples, under Emperor Wencheng; Tiangong temple, under Xiaowen; and Chongfu temple, under Qianer.

=== Xiangshan Temple ===
Xiangshan Temple is one of the earliest of the ten temples at Longmen. It is located in the midsection of the east hill. The name &#x27;Xiangshan&#x27; is derived from the name of the spices &quot;Xiangge&quot; found extensively on these hill slopes. It was reconstructed some time in 1707, during the reign of the Qing dynasty, patterned on an old temple that existed there. Longmen Grottoes Administration, expanded the temple in 2002, by adding the &quot;Belfry, the Drum Tower, the Wing Room, the Hall of Mahavira and Hall of Nine Persons, Eighteen Arhats, the Villa of Chiang Kai-shek and Soong Mei-ling&quot;. New additions included board walks, compound wall and a new gate from the southern end of the temple.

=== Bai Garden temple ===

Bai Garden is temple situated on the Pipa peak, to the north of the east hill (Xiangshan Hill). It was re-built in 1709 by Tang Youzeng of the Qing dynasty. The temple is surrounded by thick vegetation of pine and cypress trees.

=== Tomb of Bai Juyi ===
The Tomb of Bai Juyi on the east bank is that of the well-known poet during the Tang dynasty who lived in Luoyang during his later years. The tomb is located on the hill top. It is approached from the west bank after crossing a bridge across the Yi River. The tomb is a circular mound of earth of 4 meters height with a circumference of 52 meters. The tomb is 2.80 meters high and has the poet&#x27;s name inscribed on it as Bai Juyi.

== Preservation and restoration ==

One of the major achievements in this direction is the recognition given to the monuments by UNESCO in declaring the Longmen Grottoes a heritage monument, after due evaluation over a period, and inscribing it in the World Heritage List. The recognition is based on Criteria (i), (ii), and (iii): &quot;Criterion (i), the sculptures of the Longmen Grottoes are an outstanding manifestation of human artistic creativity; Criterion (ii) the Longmen Grottoes illustrate the perfection of a long-established art form which was to play a highly significant role in the cultural evolution of this region of Asia; and Criterion (iii), the high cultural level and sophisticated society of Tang dynasty China is encapsulated in the exceptional stone carvings of the Longmen Grottoes.&quot; This also enjoins the Government of China to take adequate steps to preserve the monument in its heritage status according to guidelines issued from time to time after frequent inspections of the site.

The Longmen Grottoes have undergone many concerted efforts of identifying, demarcating, planning, and implementing restoration works since 1951. To start with, a weather monitoring station was established near the grottoes to assess the environmental conditions prevailing in the area and to plan appropriate restoration measures. This was followed by intensive restoration works, initially in the form of strengthening the rock bases to arrest seepage of water from the roofs and sides of the grottoes. Overgrown vegetation with roots was cleared. Means of access to the caves were newly installed in the form of railings, footpaths and walkways with steps. All the efforts taken by the government of China over the last nearly six decades has ensured that the grottoes are preserved in a fairly presentable state of conservation. All this has been achieved by the integrated action of three institutions, namely: the China Institution of Cultural Relics Protection, who provided the professional scientific inputs, the China University of Geosciences, and the Longmen Cultural Relics Care Agency. Funds for the studies and restoration works have been provided for under the Revised Five-Year and Ten-Year Plans approved by the People&#x27;s Government of Luoyang City in 1999.

<doc id="645871" wikidata="Q11803259" url="?curid=645871" title="John Sutton, 1st Baron Dudley">
<text>John Sutton VI, 1st Baron Dudley (25 December 1400 â 30 September 1487) was an English nobleman, diplomat, and councillor of King Henry VI. He fought in several battles during the Hundred Years&#x27; War and the Wars of the Roses, as well as acted as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1428 to 1430.

==Family and peerage==
Born on 25 December 1400, John Sutton was baptised at Barton-under-Needwood, Staffordshire, became 1st Baron Dudley and a Knight of the Garter, and died at Stafford, Staffordshire. His father was Sir John de Sutton V and his mother was Constance Blount, daughter of Sir Walter Blount. John 1st Baron Dudley married Elizabeth de Berkeley, of Beverstone (died 1478), widow of Edward Charleton, 5th Baron Cherleton and daughter of Sir John Berkeley, of Beverstone, Gloucestershire (1349â1428) and Elizabeth Bettershorne and sister of Eleanor FitzAlan, wife of John FitzAlan, 6th Earl of Arundel, sometime after 14 March 1420. The children of Dudley by this marriage were: 
#Sir Edmund Sutton
#John Sutton Dudley, Knt. of Atherington, whose son was Henry VII&#x27;s minister Edmund Dudley, and whose grandson was John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland. 
#William Dudley, Bishop of Durham, 1476â1483.
#Oliver Dudley (d 1469)
#Eleanor Dudley (1439-1513) who married firstly Sir Henry Beaumont (1446-1471) of Wednesbury and secondly George Stanley (1440-1509) of West Bromwich and High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1473.

Dudley was summoned to Parliament on 15 February 1440, by writs directed to &quot;Johanni de Sutton de Duddeley militi&quot;, whereby he obtained a Barony by writ as Lord Dudley. He was the first of his family to adopt the surname of Dudley as an alias for Sutton. &quot;John Dudley, Knyght, Lord Dudley&quot; died testate in his 87th year. His will is dated 17 August 1487. The barony was inherited by his grandson, Edward Sutton, 2nd Baron Dudley, son of Sir Edmund Sutton who was the heir but died after 6 July 1483 but before his father.

==Royal service==
As Lord Steward in 1422 Sutton brought home the body of King Henry V to England, and was chief mourner and standard bearer at his funeral. From 1428â1430 he served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Dudley fought in several campaigns throughout the period of the wars with France, and on several occasions acted as a diplomat in the mid-1440s, when he also met Charles VII of France. In 1443 he was made a king&#x27;s councillor and became one of the favourite companions of King Henry VI. In 1451 he became a Knight of the Garter. Early on in the Wars of the Roses he was a resolute defender of the House of Lancaster, but changed his allegiance to York before the Battle of Towton in 1461.

==Wars of the Roses==
At the Battle of St Albans in 1455, Lord Dudley took part with his son Edmund, where he was taken prisoner along with Henry VI. At the Battle of Blore Heath on 23 September 1459 he was again present, equally with his son Edmund Sutton, commanding a wing under Lord Audley. Dudley was wounded and again captured. At Towton (1461) he was rewarded after the battle for his participation on the side of Edward, Earl of March, son of Richard, Duke of York. On 28 June that year, Edward IV was proclaimed King in London.

<doc id="645875" wikidata="Q2005645" url="?curid=645875" title="Social robot">
<text>A social robot is an autonomous robot that interacts and communicates with humans or other autonomous physical agents by following social behaviors and rules attached to its role. Like other robots, a social robot is physically embodied (avatars or on-screen synthetic social characters are not embodied and thus distinct). Some synthetic social agents are designed with a screen to represent the head or &#x27;face&#x27; to dynamically communicate with users. In these cases, the status as a social robot depends on the form of the &#x27;body&#x27; of the social agent; if the body has and uses some physical motors and sensor abilities, then the system could be considered a robot.

==Background==

While robots have often been described as possessing social qualities (see for example the tortoises developed by William Grey Walter in the 1950s), social robotics is a fairly recent branch of robotics. Since the 1990s, artificial intelligence and robotics researchers have developed robots which explicitly engage on a social level.

The evolution of social robots began with autonomous robots designed to have little to no interaction with humans. Essentially, they were designed to take on what humans could not. Technologically advanced robots were sent out to handle hazardous conditions and the assignments that could potentially put humans in danger, like exploring the deep oceans or the surface of Mars. Advancing these original intentions, robots are continually being developed to be inserted into human-related settings to establish their social aspect and access their influence on human interactions. Over time, social robots have been advanced to begin to have their own role in society.

Designing an autonomous social robot is particularly challenging, as the robot needs to correctly interpret people&#x27;s action and respond appropriately, which is currently not yet possible. Moreover, people interacting with a social robot may hold very high expectancies of its capabilities, based on science fiction representations of advanced social robots. As such, many social robots are partially or fully remote controlled to simulate advanced capabilities. This method of (often covertly) controlling a social robot is referred to as a Mechanical Turk or Wizard of Oz, after the character in the L. Frank Baum book. Wizard of Oz studies are useful in social robotics research to evaluate how people respond to social robots.

==Definition==
A robot is defined in the International Standard of Organization as a reprogrammable, multifunctional manipulator designed to move material, parts, tools or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for performance of a variety of tasks. As a subset of robots, social robots perform any or all of these processes in the context of a social interaction. It interacts socially with humans or evokes social responses from them. The nature of the social interactions is immaterial and may range from relatively simple supportive tasks, such as passing tools to a worker, to complex expressive communication and collaboration, such as assistive healthcare. Hence, social robots are asked to work together with humans in collaborative workspaces. Moreover, social robots start following humans into much more personal settings like home, health care, and education.

Social interactions are likely to be cooperative, but the definition is not limited to this situation. Moreover, uncooperative behavior can be considered social in certain situations. The robot could, for example, exhibit competitive behavior within the framework of a game. The robot could also interact with a minimum or no communication. It could, for example, hand tools to an astronaut working on a space station. However, it is likely that some communication will be necessary at some point.

Two suggested ultimate requirements for social robots are the Turing Test to determine the robot&#x27;s communication skills and Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Three Laws of Robotics for its behavior. The usefulness to apply these requirements in a real-world application, especially in the case of Asimov&#x27;s laws, is still disputed and may not be possible at all). However, a consequence of this viewpoint is that a robot that only interacts and communicates with other robots would not be considered to be a social robot: Being social is bound to humans and their society which defines necessary social values, norms and standards. This results in a cultural dependency of social robots since social values, norms and standards differ between cultures.

This brings us directly to the last part of the definition. A social robot must interact within the social rules attached to its role. The role and its rules are defined through society. For example, a robotic butler for humans would have to comply with established rules of good service. It should be anticipating, reliable and most of all discreet. A social robot must be aware of this and comply with it. However, social robots that interact with other autonomous robots would also behave and interact according to non-human conventions. In most social robots the complexity of human-to-human interaction will be gradually approached with the advancement of the technology of androids (a form of humanoid robots) and implementation of a variety of more human-like communication skills 

== Social interaction ==
Researches have investigated user engagement with a robot companion. Literature present different models regarding this concern. An example is a framework that models both causes and effects of engagement: features related to the user&#x27;s non-verbal behaviour, the task and the companion&#x27;s affective reactions to predict children&#x27;s level of engagement.

Many people are uneasy about interacting socially with a robot and, in general, people tend to prefer smaller robots to large humanoid robots. They also prefer robots to do tasks like cleaning the house rather than providing companionship. In verbal social interactions people tend to share less information with robots than with humans. Despite initial reluctance to interact with social robots, exposure to a social robot may decrease uncertainty and increase willingness to interact with the robot, and research shows that over time people speak for a longer time and share more information in their disclosures to a social robot. If people have an interaction with a social robot that is seen as playful (as opposed to focused on completing a task or being social) they may be more likely to engage with the robot in the future.

==Societal impacts==
The increasingly widespread use of more advanced social robots is one of several phenomena expected to contribute to the technological posthumanization of human societies, through which process âa society comes to include members other than ânaturalâ biological human beings who, in one way or another, contribute to the structures, dynamics, or meaning of the society.â

== Uses in healthcare ==
Social robots have been used increasingly in healthcare settings and recent research has been exploring the applicability of social robots as mental health interventions for children. A scoping review analyzed the impacts that robots such as Nao, Paro, Huggable, Tega and Pleo have on children in various intervention settings. Results from this work highlighted that depression and anger may be reduced in children working with social robots, however anxiety and pain yielded mixed results. Distress was found to be reduced in children who interacted with robots. Finally, this scoping review found that affect was positively impacted by interaction with robotsâsuch that children smiled for longer and demonstrated growth-mindsets when playing games. It is worth noting that robots have increased benefits in that they can be used instead of animal-assisted therapy for children who are allergic or immunocompromised. Sanitation is a necessary issue to consider, however with washable covers or sanitizable surfaces, this becomes less of a problem in medical settings. Another review analyzed data from previous studies and found further support that social robots may reduce negative symptoms children experience in healthcare settings. Social robots can be used as tools for distracting children from procedures, like getting a shot, and have demonstrated the ability to reduce stress and pain experience. Children who interacted with both a psychotherapist and robot assistant for therapy experienced reduced anger, anxiety, and depression when coping with cancer compared to a control group. There is some evidence that supports that free-play with a robot while hospitalized can help children experience more positive moods. More work needs to be done to analyze the impact of social robots on children in psychiatric wards, as evidence revealed that some children may dislike the robot and feel it is dangerous. Overall, further research should be conducted to fully understand the impact of social robots on reducing negative mental health symptoms in children, but there appears to be advantages of utilizing social robots in healthcare settings.

Social robots have been shown to have beneficial outcomes for children with Autism-spectrum disorder (ASD). As many individuals with autism-spectrum disorder tend to prefer predictable interactions, robots may be a viable option for social interactions. Previous research on the interactions between children with ASD and robots has demonstrated positive benefits, for instance shared attention, increased eye contact, and interpersonal synchrony. Various types of robots have the potential to reap these benefits for children with ASDâfrom humanoid robots like KASPAR, to cartoonish robots such as Tito, to animal-like robots like Probo, to machine-like robots such as Nao. One problem that may hinder the advantages of social robots as social interaction tools for children with ASD is the Uncanny Valley, as the eerily human-likeness of the robots may be overstimulating and anxiety-inducing. It appears that social robots provide an opportunity to increase social skills in children with ASD, and future research should investigate this topic further.

Individuals with cognitive impairments, such as dementia and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, may also benefit from social robots. In their study, Moro et al. (2018) utilized 3 social robots typesâa human-like robot, Casper; a character-like Robot, The Ed robot; and a tabletâto help six individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment make a cup of tea. Results demonstrated that, to an extent, the humanoid robot was most engaging to individuals with cognitive impairments, likely due to the expressiveness of its face compared to the minimal expression of Ed and the tablet. Participants also anthropomorphized the human-like and character-like robot more so than the tablet by addressing them and asking questions, further indicating a preference for the social robots. Additionally, participants perceived the human-like robot to be useful in both social situations and in completing activities of daily living, whereas the character-like robot and tablet were seen as only useful for activities of daily living. Another study by Moyle et al. (2019) investigated the impact that providing an individual with dementia a robot toy, Paro, versus a plush-toy would have on caregiver and family members&#x27; perception of the individuals&#x27; well-being. This study highlighted the ways in which some long-term care facilities may have minimal stimulation for dementia patients, which can lead to boredom and increased agitation. After completing the trial, caregivers and family members were asked to assess the individual with dementias&#x27; well-being and, overall, the group that interacted with Paro was perceived to be happier, more engaged, and less agitated. One of the main issues with utilizing Paro, despite its perceived benefits, is the costâfuture research must investigate more cost effective options for older adult care. Another issue of conducting research between individuals with cognitive impairments and social robots is their ability to consent. In some cases, informed consent by proxy can be utilized, however the benefits and risks should be weighed before conducting any research. Long-term research could show that residents of care home are willing to interact with humanoid robots and benefit from cognitive and physical activation that is led by the robot Pepper. Pepper was also used in assessing the feelings of safety and security the robot provided for older individuals. For these individuals, security is associated with trust and confidence developed by interpersonal relationships. Using videos and questionnaires, both safety and security ended up on the positive side for the participants and how they felt. Another long-term study in a care home could show that people working in the care sector are willing to use robots in their daily work with the residents. But it also revealed that even though that the robots are ready to be used, they do need human assistants, they cannot replace the human work force but they can assist them and give them new possibilities.

Social robots have been used as mental well-being coaches, for students, in public, and at the workplace. Robotic mental well-being coaches can perform practices such as positive psychology and mindfulness. Users&#x27; perceptions of robotic mental well-being coaches have been shown to depend on the robot&#x27;s appearance.

The ethics of social robots&#x27; use in healthcare should also be mentioned. One potential risk of social robots is deceptionâthere may be an expectation that the robot can perform certain functions when it actually cannot. For example, with increased human-likeness and anthropomorphic traits, humans interacting with robots might assume the robot to have feelings and thoughts, which is misleading. Isolating older adults from humans is also a risk of social robots in that these robots may make up a significant amount of the individual&#x27;s social interaction. Currently there is little evidence about the long-term impacts this limited human contact and increased robot interaction may have. Some social robots also have a built in telepresence capacity that can be utilized such that individuals can videoconference with family, caregivers, and medical staff, which may decrease loneliness and isolation. The video capability of some robots is a potential avenue for social interaction and increasing accessibility of medical assessments. Dignity for persons interacting with robots should also be respectedâindividuals might find some robots, like the cuddly toy-like Paro, to be infantilizing, and future investigations should explore how to best increase autonomy of patients interacting with robots. Furthermore, privacy is another ethical concern in that some social robots can collect and store video data or data from sensors. The stored data is at risk to be stolen or hacked into, which negatively impacts individual privacy. Safety of individuals interacting with robots is another concern in that robots may accidentally cause harm, like by bumping into someone and causing them to fall. Ethical considerations should be taken into account before introducing robots into healthcare settings.

== Presence in the workplace ==
The presence of social robots within the workplace makes a difference in the daily work lives of the employees. Due to the robot&#x27;s advanced technological knowledge, they are able to contribute and assist in completing tasks and contributing to the overall diversity of the work itself. Not to mention the work the robots contribute; they also alleviate the work piles and stress that are put on everyday employees. Social robots can be a key player in assisting when humans may not have the correct knowledge or skills to perform the task at hand, as well as reduce the exposure human employees have to accidents and health risks within the workplace.

Workplace difficulties arise when employees face illnesses, heavy workloads, or other obstacles preventing them from performing to their full potential. When these productivity and quality levels may be in danger, social robots offer a new solution and can be used to assist employees where necessary. This is especially true when it comes to the possible stress and depression employees face in being overworked. These robots can play a crucial role in alleviating pieces of tasks and the overall work demand for individual employees. In instances like Europe has been facing with a lack of labor force within the service industry, social robots play a crucial role in entering and restoring relatively normal workplace functionality.

==Examples==

One of the most well-known social robots currently in development is Sophia, developed by Hanson Robotics. Sophia is a social humanoid robot that can display more than 50 facial expressions, and is the first non-human to be given a United Nations title.

Tesla, Inc. has developed a commercially available robot called Optimus (robot), which as of February 2025, costs USD $30,000. This robot is a humanoid that uses an AI to learn and communicate, with a goal of performing tasks similar tasks as humans.

SoftBank Robotics has developed multiple social, semi-humanoid robots which are frequently used in research, including Pepper and Nao. Pepper is used both commercially and academically, as well as being used by consumers in over a thousand homes in Japan.

Other notable examples of social robots include ASIMO by Honda, Jibo, Moxi, and Kaspar, designed by University of Hertfordshire to help children with autism learn responses from the robot through games and interactive play. Anki&#x27;s robots Cozmo and Vector also fell into the category of social robots, but all were shut down between 2018 and 2019.

Social robots do not necessarily have to be humanoid. The most famous example of a non-humanoid social robot is Paro the seal.

<doc id="645878" wikidata="Q7782077" url="?curid=645878" title="Theodore Tylor">
<text>Sir Theodore Henry Tylor (13 May 1900 â 23 October 1968) was a lawyer and international level chess player, despite being nearly blind.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Bournville, Tylor learned to play chess at age seven.
His chess skill increased while he attended Worcester College for the Blind from 1909 to 1918.
He studied at Oxford University beginning in 1918, and captained the Oxford University Chess Club.
Tylor received First-class Honours in Jurisprudence in 1922 and was made an honorary scholar of Balliol College.
The next year, he became a Bachelor of Civil Law and a lecturer at Balliol College.
Called to the Bar by the Inner Temple with a certificate of honour, he was made a Fellow at Balliol College in 1928.

== Competitions and rankings ==
Tylor competed in twelve British Championships, finishing fourth in his first appearance in 1925. His best result was in 1933, finishing second to Mir Sultan Khan.
He tied for first at the 1929â30 Hastings Premier Reserves alongside George Koltanowski ahead of Salo Flohr, Josef RejfiÅ, Ludwig Rellstab, C.H.O&#x27;D. Alexander, DaniÃ«l Noteboom, and Milan Vidmar.
Tylor played in the top section, the Hastings Premier, nine times beginning in 1930â1.
His best finish was 6th= in 1936â7.
He was first reserve for the English team at the Hamburg 1930 Chess Olympiad.

Tylor won the British Correspondence Chess Championship in 1932, 1933, and 1934.
He shared 5â6th at Margate 1936 with P. S. Milner-Barry, but he won their individual game and drew with 2nd- to 4th-place finishers JosÃ© RaÃºl Capablanca, Gideon StÃ¥hlberg, and Erik Lundin (Salo Flohr won). Although he finished 12th at Nottingham 1936, he had the best score of the British participants, ahead of C. H. O&#x27;D. Alexander, G. A. Thomas, and William Winter. Mikhail Botvinnik noted that Tylor was using a tactile chess board that he incessantly fingered, as well as a device for counting the number of moves made.

== Other positions ==
Tylor was President of the Midland Counties&#x27; Chess Union from 1947 to 1950, but his work for the university and for the welfare of the blind limited the time he had to devote to chess. In 1965, he was knighted for his service to organisations for the blind. He was Fellow and Tutor in Jurisprudence at Balliol College, Oxford for almost forty years. Tylor also enjoyed bridge.

== Death ==
He died in Oxford on 23 October 1968.

<doc id="645892" wikidata="Q843558" url="?curid=645892" title="Alternative hypothesis">
<text>In statistical hypothesis testing, the alternative hypothesis is one of the proposed propositions in the hypothesis test. In general the goal of hypothesis test is to demonstrate that in the given condition, there is sufficient evidence supporting the credibility of alternative hypothesis instead of the exclusive proposition in the test (null hypothesis). It is usually consistent with the research hypothesis because it is constructed from literature review, previous studies, etc. However, the research hypothesis is sometimes consistent with the null hypothesis.

In statistics, alternative hypothesis is often denoted as Ha or H1. Hypotheses are formulated to compare in a statistical hypothesis test.

In the domain of inferential statistics, two rival hypotheses can be compared by explanatory power and predictive power.

== Basic definition ==
The &quot;alternative hypothesis&quot; and &quot;null hypothesis&quot; are types of conjectures used in statistical tests, which are formal methods of reaching conclusions or making judgments on the basis of data. In statistical hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are two mutually exclusive statements.

&quot;The statement being tested in a test of statistical significance is called the null hypothesis. The test of significance is designed to assess the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis. Usually, the null hypothesis is a statement of &#x27;no effect&#x27; or &#x27;no difference&#x27;.&quot; Null hypothesis is often denoted as &quot;H0&quot;.

The statement that is being tested against the null hypothesis is the alternative hypothesis. Alternative hypothesis is often denoted as &quot;Ha&quot; or &quot;H1&quot;.

In statistical hypothesis testing, to prove the alternative hypothesis is true, it should be shown that the data is contradictory to the null hypothesis. Namely, there is sufficient evidence against null hypothesis to demonstrate that the alternative hypothesis is true.

==Example==
One example is where water quality in a stream has been observed over many years, and a test is made of the null hypothesis that &quot;there is no change in quality between the first and second halves of the data&quot;, against the alternative hypothesis that &quot;the quality is poorer in the second half of the record&quot;.

If the statistical hypothesis testing is thought of as a judgement in a court trial, the null hypothesis corresponds to the position of the defendant (the defendant is innocent) while the alternative hypothesis is in the rival position of prosecutor (the defendant is guilty). The defendant is innocent until proven guilty, so likewise in a hypothesis test, the null hypothesis is initially presumed to be true. To prove the statement of the prosecutor, evidence must be convincing enough to convict the defendant; this is analogous to sufficient statistical significance in a hypothesis test. 

In the court, only legal evidence can be considered as the foundation for the trial. As for hypothesis testing, a reasonable test statistic should be set to measure the statistic significance of the null hypothesis. Evidence would support the alternative hypothesis if the null hypothesis is rejected at a certain significance level. However, this does not necessarily mean that the alternative hypothesis is true due to the potential presence of a type I error. In order to quantify the statistical significance, the test statistic variables are assumed to follow a certain probability distribution such as the normal distribution or t-distribution to determine the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct, which is defined as the &quot;p&quot;-value. If the p-value is smaller than the chosen significance level (&quot;Î±&quot;), it can be claimed that observed data is sufficiently inconsistent with the null hypothesis and hence the null hypothesis may be rejected. After testing, a valid claim would be &quot;at the significance level of (&quot;Î±&quot;), the null hypothesis is rejected, supporting the alternative hypothesis instead&quot;. In the metaphor of a trial, the announcement may be &quot;with tolerance for the probability &quot;Î±&quot; of an incorrect conviction, the defendant is guilty.&quot;

==History==
The concept of an alternative hypothesis in testing was devised by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson, and it is used in the NeymanâPearson lemma. It forms a major component in modern statistical hypothesis testing. However it was not part of Ronald Fisher&#x27;s formulation of statistical hypothesis testing, and he opposed its use. In Fisher&#x27;s approach to testing, the central idea is to assess whether the observed dataset could have resulted from chance if the null hypothesis were assumed to hold, notionally without preconceptions about what other models might hold. Modern statistical hypothesis testing accommodates this type of test since the alternative hypothesis can be just the negation of the null hypothesis.

==Types==
In the case of a scalar parameter, there are four principal types of alternative hypothesis:
* &quot;Point&quot;. Point alternative hypotheses occur when the hypothesis test is framed so that the population distribution under the alternative hypothesis is a fully defined distribution, with no unknown parameters; such hypotheses are usually of no practical interest but are fundamental to theoretical considerations of statistical inference and are the basis of the NeymanâPearson lemma.
* &quot;One-tailed directional&quot;. A one-tailed directional alternative hypothesis is concerned with the region of rejection for only one tail of the sampling distribution.
* &quot;Two-tailed directional&quot;. A two-tailed directional alternative hypothesis is concerned with both regions of rejection of the sampling distribution. 
* &quot;Non-directional&quot;. A non-directional alternative hypothesis is not concerned with either region of rejection; rather, it is only concerned that null hypothesis is not true.

<text>Fernando Kelley Poe, Jr. (May 4, 1943 â May 20, 1995), professionally known as Andy Poe, was a Filipino actor. He was a brother of Philippine action movie king Fernando Poe Jr.

==Early life and career==
He was born Fernando Kelley Poe Jr. on May 4, 1943, son of Filipino actor Fernando Poe, Sr. and Irish American mestiza wife Elizabeth &quot;Bessie&quot; Kelley. He siblings were Elizabeth (&quot;Liza&quot;), Genevieve, Evangeline, Ronald Allan (&quot;Ronnie&quot;) and Freddie; and half-brother of Conrad Poe.

Poe studied at the San Beda College in Mendiola, Manila from his elementary years up to his sophomore high school years. He transferred to the JosÃ© Rizal College for junior and senior high school. He enrolled at the University of the Philippines to study Architecture. After college, he pursued a career in the movies like his older brother Ronnie. Because his name was used by Ronnie professionally (&quot;Fernando Poe Jr.&quot;), he opted to use his nickname &quot;Andy&quot; as his professional name.

==Marriage==
In 1979, he met 20-year-old, Yvette Christine de Marcaida who was the leading lady of his brother FPJ in &quot;Ang Lihim Ng Guadalupe&quot; which was the entry of FPJ Productions in the 1979 Metro Manila Film Festival. Yvette descended from the Portuguese-Indian Barrettos of the Philippines and distantly related to the Barrettos based in Zambales. Poe and de Marcaida got married in Matinez County, California, on July 31, 1980. They had two sons, Fernando Poe IV (&quot;Donnie&quot;) and Alexander Vaughn Poe (&quot;Lex&quot;) in 1981 and 1983 respectively.

From 1982 to 1984, Poe and his wife Yvette de Marcaida established DAY FILMS and produced three movies namely: &quot;Pamilya Dimagiba&quot;, &quot;Brando Bandido&quot;, and &quot;Magtago Ka Na Sa Pinanggalingan Mo&quot;. In 1985, Poe and his family immigrated to the United States and resided in Jersey City, New Jersey, until 1993 where the couple became active in the real estate business as realtors with Century 21. Poe returned to the Philippines in 1993 and did several movies until his sudden demise in 1995.

<text>Lincoln () is a town in the Selwyn District, in the Canterbury Region of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. The town is located on the Canterbury Plains to the west of Banks Peninsula, 22Â kilometres southwest of Christchurch. The town has a population of making it the second largest town in the Selwyn District behind nearby Rolleston.

Lincoln is part of the Christchurch metropolitan area; at the 2006 Census, 53% of employed Lincoln residents worked in the city. The town is home to Lincoln University, the oldest agricultural tertiary institution in the Southern Hemisphere and the smallest of New Zealand&#x27;s eight universities.

==History==

In 1862, James Edward FitzGerald of &#x27;The Springs&#x27; subdivided some of his freehold land for the new township of Lincoln, named after the Earl of Lincoln, a foundation member of the Canterbury Association and from 1851 a member of the management committee. The site of Lincoln on the L1 River would allow for a flour mill to be built to service the growing farming district. Lincoln was laid out in a grid layout and FitzGerald named the four belts North, East, South and West and the cross streets after his own children Robert, Maurice and William. The main streets James, Edward and Gerald were names after himself.
The new township steadily grew and by 1873 Lincoln had a post office, butcher, brewers, a baker and confectioner, a storekeeper who had a hotel, a wheelwright and a carpenter, and a blacksmith. The peaceful quality of Lincoln changed with the arrival of the railway line in 1875 and the opening of the Little River line in 1886.

On 26 April 1875, a branch line railway was opened to Lincoln from a junction with the Main South Line in Hornby. This line became the Southbridge Branch. Within a few years, Lincoln became a junction itself, with the Little River Branch diverging from the Southbridge Branch in Lincoln. This branch opened to Birdling&#x27;s Flat on 16 May 1882 and Little River itself on 11 March 1886. On 30 June 1962, Lincoln became a railway terminus when the Little River Branch and the Lincoln-Southbridge section of the Southbridge Branch were both closed. The railway did not last much longer in Lincoln, closing on 1 December 1967. Today, the Little River Rail Trail is being established along the railway&#x27;s old route. The Prebbleton to Lincoln leg of the route was opened on 30 November 2006. The trail is used extensively for recreation.

In 2021, a proposal to increase the size of the town by a further 5400 residents was proposed by the Carter Group. They intend to turn 186 hectares of farmland to the immediate south of the town into a new large subdivision. The proposal sets out a plan for homes to be built on sections which are between 400 square metres and 600sqm in size. Selwyn District Mayor Sam Broughton and Green MP Eugenie Sage spoke out against the development, however all but two councillors voted in favour.

== Demographics ==
Lincoln is described by Statistics New Zealand as a small urban area, and covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. 
Before the 2023 census, Lincoln had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Lincoln had a population of 6,510 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 2,643 people (68.3%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 3,690 people (130.9%) since the 2006 census. There were 2,136 households, comprising 3,165 males and 3,345 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.95 males per female, with 1,356 people (20.8%) aged under 15 years, 1,443 (22.2%) aged 15 to 29, 2,886 (44.3%) aged 30 to 64, and 831 (12.8%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 84.1% European/PÄkehÄ, 5.6% MÄori, 1.1% Pasifika, 12.0% Asian, and 3.3% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 27.4, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 55.5% had no religion, 33.6% were Christian, 0.2% had MÄori religious beliefs, 0.6% were Hindu, 1.4% were Muslim, 1.3% were Buddhist and 1.8% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 1,554 (30.2%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 525 (10.2%) people had no formal qualifications. 1,239 people (24.0%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 2,487 (48.3%) people were employed full-time, 933 (18.1%) were part-time, and 183 (3.6%) were unemployed.

==Educational, research institutions and amenities==
Lincoln has three schools, two primary and one secondary.
*Lincoln Primary School is a state full primary (Year 1â8) school. It was established in 1866 and has a roll of students as of 
*Lincoln High School is a state secondary (Year 9â13) school. It was established in 1959 and has a roll of students as of 
*Ararira Springs Primary School is a state full primary (Year 1â8) school. It opened in 2019 and has a roll of students as of 

Ararira Springs Primary School is the second primary school for the town. It was tentatively named Lincoln South School and open in February 2019.

Lincoln is the site of Lincoln University. As well as the university, there are a number of other research facilities in Lincoln, including AgResearch, Institute for Plant and Food Research, FAR (Foundation for Arable Research), and Landcare Research. The High Performance Cricket training centre is also based at Lincoln University. Over 400 people are employed at these organisations making Lincoln a busy little country village.

Lincoln also has a maternity hospital, kindergarten and golf course.

Lincoln also hosts the first New Zealand supermarket to have wind turbines generating some of its power: Lincoln New World. The supermarket was built with a number of sustainable initiatives in keeping with the Enviro town it is servicing.

== Cricket ==
The New Zealand Cricket Board decided in December 1995 to create the high performance centre. Once they had made the decision, they quickly moved to find suitable premises and develop the high performance centre. The first intake of players occurred four months later. John Reid (former New Zealand cricketer) led the establishment of the High Performance Centre in 1996 as its first cricket operations manager.

Lincoln became the home to the New Zealand Cricket High Performance Centre. It is situated at Lincoln University. There are three cricket grounds. These include the Bert Sutcliffe Oval which was the venue for several high-profile matches: the 2000 Women&#x27;s world cup and two under 19 world cup finals. Three national tournaments are held in at these grounds each summer. They are the Women&#x27;s under 21 tournament, the men&#x27;s provincial A tournament and men&#x27;s under 18 tournament. Many other games and training camps are also held at the high performance centre.

Facilities also include a six lanes of indoor nets, a gym, accommodation for cricketers and multiple ground staff to keep the pitches in top condition. All weather facilities allow cricketers to train on grass pitches all year round. A marquee cover and climate control system were installed in 2018 to provide a winter training base.

<text>Katherine Thomas (born June 6, 1966), best known by her stage name The Great Kat, is an American guitarist and singer best known for her thrash metal interpretations of well-known pieces of classical music. Most feature her using the electric guitar, but on some she uses the violin. Thomas is a classically trained violinist, graduating from the Juilliard School and touring for a time playing conventional classical music before crossing over to metal.

&quot;Guitar One&quot; magazine listed her as one of the &quot;Fastest Shredders of All Time&quot;. Her classical background, technical skills and self-promotion are sometimes compared to Yngwie Malmsteen. In an interview in metallian.com she claimed to be the reincarnation of Beethoven.

Her public persona, as portrayed in her publicity photos and videos, is mainly compared to that of a dominatrix, albeit in an over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek manner.

In 1990, Swiss black metal band Mordor recorded for their first demo tape &quot;Odes&quot; a tribute song for Thomas, titled &quot;The Great Kat Is God&quot;.

<text>Marc Riley (born 10 July 1961) is an English radio DJ, alternative rock critic, musician, and former music businessman. He currently presents on BBC Radio 6 Music.

Formerly a member of The Fall, he co-owned a record label, In-Tape, and also worked as a record plugger for bands such as Massive Attack, Pixies, Cocteau Twins and Happy Mondays. Riley has worked in radio since about 1991; for 14 years of that he worked with Mark Radcliffe on BBC Radio 5 and BBC Radio 1, during which time he was known as [[Mark and Lard|Lard]]. He joined 6 Music in April 2004.

== Musical career ==
Riley was born on 10 July 1961 in Manchester. Raised in Manchester, Riley was in a band at school called the Sirens with Craig Scanlon and Steve Hanley (both of whom were later members of the Fall). Riley was an early fan of the Fall, and worked for the group as a roadie. He was added to the line-up, playing bass, in May 1978. Riley&#x27;s recording debut was the Fall&#x27;s second single, &quot;It&#x27;s the New Thing&quot;, and their debut album &quot;Live at the Witch Trials&quot;.

Riley switched to guitar and keyboards in 1979 and held this position with the Fall, until he fell out with Mark E. Smith in 1982, during the group&#x27;s first tour of Australia and New Zealand. Riley was dismissed by Smith â according to Smith this occurred on Riley&#x27;s wedding day. Riley was actually married on Christmas Eve 1982 and remained in the Fall until January 1983, when Smith met Riley in the Old Garratt pub, Princess Street, and told him that the group was undertaking a European tour without him and should it not work out he would be asked back.

Riley is quoted as saying &quot;Joining The Fall was the second best thing that ever happened to me in my working life. The best thing was getting kicked out&quot;.

Later in 1983, Riley began to record under the name &#x27;Marc Riley with The Creepers&#x27; (later The Creepers). Steve Hanley, Paul Hanley and Craig Scanlon, while remaining members of the Fall, played on Riley&#x27;s first solo single, &quot;Favourite Sister&quot;. Riley released several albums during the following years.

Animosity between Smith and Riley continued to influence both bands&#x27; material. This included the Fall&#x27;s &quot;Hey Marc Riley&quot; (a rewritten version of Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;Hey Bo Diddley&quot;), which has only been available on live bootlegs. Riley responded in kind with his 1983 single &quot;Jumper Clown&quot; â a reference to Smith&#x27;s then affection for 1970s jumpers â as well as &quot;Snipe&quot; on the 1985 EP &quot;Shadow Figure&quot; and his own rewrite of a Bo Diddley song: &quot;Marc Riley is a Gunslinger&quot;. Riley co-owned the In-Tape label with Jim Khambatta, until it went bust in 1991, managing the label between 1983 and 1986.

Between 1986 and 1989, Riley drew and wrote the comic strips &quot;Harry the Head&quot; and &quot;Doctor Mooney&quot; for the comic &quot;Oink!&quot;, as well as recording a flexidisc single for the comic as a giveaway.

The Creepers disbanded in 1987. Riley then formed a band that included ex-members of Pere Ubu, The Magic Band and The Mekons called the Lost Soul Crusaders (named after a fictional group in an episode of the detective series &#x27;Columbo&#x27; whose lead singer was played by one of Riley&#x27;s heroes, Johnny Cash). However, the record company funding the band went bankrupt before any material could be recorded.

In 1988, Riley co-produced (with Jon Langford) a Johnny Cash tribute album, &quot;Til Things are Brighter&quot;, to raise funds for the Terrence Higgins Trust.

== Radio career ==

Riley is perhaps better known as one half of the duo Mark and Lard with fellow DJ Mark Radcliffe, who together presented &quot;Hit the North&quot; on BBC Radio 5 (at the time a children&#x27;s, comedy, and drama network). During this period Riley also presented a programme on Radio 5 called &quot;Cult Radio&quot;, and wrote and produced a BBC Radio 1 series presented by Noddy Holder called &quot;Glitter and Twisted&quot;. Mark and Lard moved to Radio 1&#x27;s 10Â pm slot in 1993, followed by an unsuccessful move to the more mainstream orientated breakfast show in February 1997, and finally to the 1Â pm to 3Â pm slot in October that year. Their final show on the station was in March 2004. 

After leaving Radio 1, the duo cordially went their separate ways; Riley moving to BBC Radio 6 Music and Radcliffe to BBC Radio 2. In 2009 Mark and Lard reformed to front radio adverts for Manchester City in North West England (Riley is a long-time fan of the club).

Up until the end of May 2023, he presented the Sony Radio Academy Award-nominated 7â9 pm show, Monday to Thursday on Radio 6 Music. The show featured almost daily sessions from artists chosen by Riley himself. Among the bands championed by Riley have been Metronomy, Field Music, Everything Everything, Wild Beasts, Sweet Baboo and King Creosote and more recently Ty Segall, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Thee Oh Sees. He previously presented &quot;Mint&quot; with Rob Hughes on Sunday evenings. Hughes joined Riley&#x27;s early evening show on Tuesdays (The A to Z series) and Thursdays (The Parallel Universe).

Riley currently co-presents &quot;Riley &amp; Coe&quot; with Gideon Coe, from 9 pm to 11 pm on Monday to Thursday evenings.

February 2015 saw the first episode of &quot;All Shook Up&quot;, a made-for-iPlayer &#x27;TV&#x27; programme featuring live music presented and curated by Riley. Series 1 is made up of four episodes, all filmed in the University of Salford studio. Episode 1 featured performances from The Wave Pictures, Slug and Lonelady. Episode 2 features Wire, Monotony and Jane Weaver, Episode 3 Teleman, Sara Lowes and Sauna Youth and Episode 4 Jesca Hoop, The Wytches and Richard Dawson.

Riley, together with Rob Hughes, wrote and presented an &#x27;A to Z of Punk and New Wave&#x27; on 6 Music, which was then turned into a successful podcast. That was followed by the long-term project &#x27;The A to Z of David Bowie&#x27;, a commercially available podcast, which was launched on 30 January 2018 and ran for 72 episodes.

Riley and Radcliffe formed the parody group Shirehorses, once appearing at the Glastonbury Festival in 1997 in what they called the headline slot, going on as they did at 10.00am. They also did shows in various parts of the country including three dates supporting Blur. They released two comedy/parody albums under the guise of the Shirehorses: &quot;The Worst...Album in the World...Ever...EVER!&quot; (which reached number 22 in the UK Albums Chart) and &quot;Our Kid Eh&quot;, the latter an affectionate parody of Radiohead&#x27;s album &quot;Kid A&quot; (which reached number 20).

== Personal life ==
Riley married Tracy Magee on Christmas Eve 1982.

<doc id="645924" wikidata="Q1486950" url="?curid=645924" title="Lloyd Quinan">
<text>Lloyd John Quinan (born 29 April 1957) is a Scottish broadcaster and pro-independence politician. He was a Scottish National Party (SNP) Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the West of Scotland region from 1999 to 2003.

Born and raised in Edinburgh, Quinan is a longtime campaigner for Scottish independence, initially joining the Scottish National Party in 1974, later leaving in 2003. In 2015 the SNP selected him as a list candidate for the Lothian region.

==Theatre and television career==
A trained actor, he appeared in theatres throughout Scotland, including the Royal Lyceum, the Traverse, Perth Theatre, the Tron, Eden Court and the Pavilion. He was assistant director of the Scottish Theatre Company and founder of the independent company, United Artists (Scotland).

He directed new plays by Peter Arnott and George Gunn as well as the first Scottish production of Howard Barker&#x27;s &quot;Pity In History&quot;. Working as a freelance director he worked with many companies and theatres including the Citizens Theatre Glasgow, Unit One, the Traverse, Mayfest, the Borders Festival, Craigmillar Festival Society and directed plays, pantomimes and community pageants. He was an elected member of the Scottish committee of the Equity Union for 12 years. Like so many theatre workers he had a parallel career in television appearing in a number of dramas for BBC Scotland, Granada, STV and ITV. While working for STV in 1983 he became a presenter in the education department making over 200 programmes on Scottish history and society.

In 1994 he returned to STV as a weather presenter on the station&#x27;s lunchtime show. In 1995 he succeeded Bernard Ponsonby as the presenter of &quot;Trial By Night&quot;, a late night debate show.

In 1996 he was producer/director on the Scottish Reporters series and co-produced &quot;The Professional Beggar&quot; for ITV First Tuesday. Quinan was an elected official of the National Union of Journalists and was involved in the work to rule dispute at the station. In 1998, he left STV after an acrimonious contract dispute. From 1998-99 Quinan worked as for Channel 4 News, UTV and RTE as a presenter/director.

==Political career==
===Scottish Parliament===
In 1999 he was elected to represent the West of Scotland as an SNP candidate at the first Scottish Parliament election.

During his time as an MSP, he served as the SNP&#x27;s Deputy spokesperson for Social Inclusion 1999-2000, a member of the European Committee and the Audit Committee. He also served as Convener of the Cross Party Group on Autism in the Scottish Parliament, Vice-Convener of the Cross Party Group on Contemporary Music and was a member of the Cross Party Groups on Palestine and Cuba.

An active anti-nuclear campaigner, Quinan was twice arrested for breach of the peace during blockades of the Faslane Nuclear Submarine base during his time as an MSP. Quinan went on to challenge his conviction in the High Court of Justiciary introducing a point of law which resulted in one of his convictions being set aside, this was seen as a minor victory for the anti-nuclear movement in Scotland.

In 2002, while a vice-convener of the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s cross-party group on Palestine, Quinan visited the Middle East on a week-long tour, linking with the Red Crescent and International Solidarity Movement. Quinan travelled to the West Bank as part of a group, but Israelis soldiers denied them entrance to Yasser Arafat&#x27;s compound in Ramallah. The Israeli security forces shot at him and fired stun grenades in order to force him away.

For the 2003 Parliament election Quinan stood down from being a candidate in the West of Scotland, and instead sought nomination in his home city of Edinburgh. Quinan was unsuccessful in his bid, and went on to unsuccessfully contest the seat of Motherwell and Wishaw at the 2003 election. The seat was held by the Labour candidate, First Minister Jack McConnell.

===After Parliament===
In December 2003 Quinan left the SNP for the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP), explaining that he felt the SNP no longer represented his political beliefs. Quinan subsequently unsuccessfully attempted to become one of the SSP&#x27;s candidates for the 2004 European Parliament election. He left the SSP later that year.

Quinan was a &#x27;Yes&#x27; supporter who was active during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum campaign. At one public meeting in North Berwick where he spoke, some of his closing remarks were seized upon by sections of the No campaign. Quinan had said that Scottish people &quot;have an opportunity to change the lives and life chances of our children for the future&quot;, but added that &quot;if you vote &#x27;No&#x27; [and] you leave them with more of the same, then you&#x27;re a bad parent.&quot;

Having returned to the SNP in 2014, Quinan represented the party in the 2016 Scottish parliamentary election as a candidate for the Lothian region, but was not elected.

==Personal life==
Quinan is a Hibernian F.C. supporter.

<text>IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS (request to send/clear to send) is the optional mechanism used by the 802.11 wireless networking protocol to reduce frame collisions introduced by the hidden node problem. Originally the protocol fixed the exposed node problem as well, but later RTS/CTS does not, but includes ACKs.

== Frame format ==
The RTS, CTS and ACK frame headers all contain

* frame control (two bytes of metadata flags)
* duration
* receiver MAC address
* frame check sequence. 
* RTS frames contain the transmitter&#x27;s MAC address.

== Exposed terminal problem ==
This protocol was designed under the assumption that all nodes have the same transmission ranges. RTS/CTS frames can cause the exposed terminal problem in which a wireless node that is nearby, but is associated with another access point, overhears the exchange and then is signaled to back off and cease transmitting for the time specified in the RTS.

== Carrier sensing ==
RTS/CTS is an additional method to implement virtual carrier sensing in carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). By default, 802.11 relies on physical carrier sensing only.

== Frame size ==
The RTS/CTS packet size threshold is 0â2347 octets. Typically, sending RTS/CTS frames does not occur unless the packet size exceeds this threshold. If the packet size that the node wants to transmit is larger than the threshold, the RTS/CTS handshake gets triggered. Otherwise, the data frame gets sent immediately.

<text>Cornelis Vreeswijk (; ; 8 August 1937 â 12 November 1987) was a Dutch-Swedish singer-songwriter and poet.

He emigrated to Sweden with his parents in 1949 at the age of twelve. He was educated as a social worker and hoped to become a journalist, but became increasingly involved in music, performing at events for students with idiosyncratic humor and social engagement. Vreeswijk is considered one of the most influential and successful troubadours in Sweden. In 2010, the Swedish drama film &quot;Cornelis&quot; was made about his life, directed by Amir Chamdin.

==Early life==
Cornelis Vreeswijk was born and grew up in the Netherlands. He emigrated to Sweden with his parents in 1949 at the age of twelve. He left school in 1955 and went to sea, where he passed the time playing the blues. He returned to Sweden in 1959. He was educated as a social worker at Stockholm University and hoped to become a journalist, but became increasingly involved in music, performing at events for students with idiosyncratic humor and social engagement.

==Swedish career==
Vreeswijk explained in one of his few interviews that he had taught himself to sing and play in the fifties by imitating his first idols Josh White and Lead Belly. His first album, &quot;Ballader och ofÃ¶rskÃ¤mdheter&quot; (&quot;Ballads and rudenesses&quot;, 1964), was a hit which immediately gained him a large following among the emerging radical student generation. In this period he also played with Swedish jazz pianist Jan Johansson and his trio. His songs &quot;ÃngbÃ¥tsblues&quot; (&quot;Steam Boat Blues&quot;) and &quot;Jubelvisa fÃ¶r Fiffiga Nanette&quot; (&quot;Joyful song for Clever Nanette&quot;) are classics from these recordings. His abrasive, frequently political lyrics and unconventional delivery were a deliberate break with what he was later to describe as a Swedish song tradition of pretty singing and harmless lyrics, &quot;a hobby for the upper classes&quot;. Influenced by jazz and blues and especially by the singing style and social criticism of Georges Brassens, Vreeswijk &quot;speak-sings&quot; his &quot;insults&quot;, and compels his listeners to pay close attention to the words.

His translation of Allan Sherman&#x27;s masterpiece &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh&quot; remains beloved to Swedes as &quot;Brev frÃ¥n kolonien&quot; (Letter from the summer camp) decades later, and could be said to have passed into folklore.

A political singer with a bohemian lifestyle, Vreeswijk remained controversial in the sixties and early seventies, idolized by his fans but disapproved of by many others for his &quot;rude&quot; language and persistent interest in &quot;unsuitable&quot; people like prostitutes and criminals. Some of his records were blacklisted by the public broadcasting company Sveriges Radio. During this period, he not only wrote and recorded songs now considered classics, such as &quot;Sportiga Marie&quot; (&quot;Sporty Marie&quot;) and several affectionate salutes to the ever less employable &quot;Polaren PÃ¤r&quot; (&quot;My Buddy PÃ¤r&quot;), but he was an actor on the stage, receiving considerable critical acclaim, most notably as Pilate in the Swedish version of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, and as Tevye in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. He participated in &quot;Melodifestivalen&quot; (the Swedish preselection for the Eurovision Song Contest) in 1972 with &quot;Ãnskar du mig, sÃ¥ Ã¶nskar jag dig&quot;, which finished sixth. He also appeared in movies, including &quot;Svarta Palmkronor&quot; (&quot;Black Palm Trees&quot;, 1968), which was filmed on location in Brazil. Spending four months in Brazil began Vreeswijk&#x27;s lifelong interest in Latin American music and social and political conditions, later seen for example in his &quot;Victor Jara&quot; album of 1978.

Later in his career, Vreeswijk was to gain increasing fame and a wider audience both for his songs and his other work. He published several volumes of poetry in his lifetime and left a considerable manuscript legacy of poems which have been published since. He also became an important musical interpreter of the works of other people, recording the songs of Carl Michael Bellman, Evert Taube, and Lars Forssell. His fresh, bluesy renderings of Bellman and Taube, who had up to then been classics belonging to the &quot;harmless&quot; tradition that Vreeswijk despised, were artistic and commercial successes which extended his fanbase. The choice of Bellman was significant: Bellman&#x27;s lively, romantic, pastoral, drinking and sometimes bawdy songs gained Vreeswijk the reputation of being a drunken womaniser, with the association of being &quot;something of a Bellman himself&quot;. Like his friend Fred ÃkerstrÃ¶m, he gave Bellman&#x27;s songs, &quot;a new and more powerful expression&quot; than they had had before, and like him identifying himself with Bellman&#x27;s fictional character Fredman, expressing his drunkenness, poverty, and despair, with an intensity that increased in his performances over the years. Bellman&#x27;s songs featured in many of his performances; two of his albums were dedicated to Bellman&#x27;s songs, namely the 1971 &quot;Spring mot Ulla, spring! Cornelis sjunger Bellman&quot; containing 13 of &quot;Fredman&#x27;s Epistles&quot;, and the 1977 &quot;Movitz! Movitz!&quot;, containing 12: the popular Epistle 81, &quot;MÃ¤rk hur vÃ¥r skugga&quot;, appears on both albums.

Vreeswijk&#x27;s own best-known songs of the later seventies and early eighties tend to be dark in tone, like &quot;Sist jag Ã¥kte jumbojet blues&quot; (&quot;Last time I Went by Jumbojet Blues&quot;, a metaphorical bad trip) and &quot;Blues fÃ¶r Fatumeh&quot;, both addressing heavy drug addiction. Even though in this period Vreeswijk was a prey of tabloid scandal and in the news for his drinking problem and his debts (about both of which he spoke with frankness) rather than for his achievements, he remained highly productive. He is also known as the co-writer of the Hep Stars song &quot;Speleman&quot; which was released for their album &quot;Songs We Sang 68&quot;.

Towards the end of his life his reputation soared again, aided by the televising of some highly regarded nightclub shows, and by Agneta Brunius&#x27; TV documentary &quot;Balladen om den flygande hollÃ¤ndaren&quot; (&quot;The Ballad of the Flying Dutchman&quot;) in 1986. By the time of his death from liver cancer at the age of fifty, Vreeswijk had become an icon of the Swedish music scene, and he was honored with burial at the cemetery of Katarina kyrka, a national cemetery in Stockholm. It was broadcast live on Swedish television. In 2010, &quot;Cornelis&quot;, a movie about his life, premiered in Swedish cinemas. Norwegian singer Hans Erik Dyvik Husby (previously in Turbonegro) played the role of Vreeswijk.

== Dutch career ==

In 1966, the Dutch broadcasting organisation VARA invited Vreeswijk to the Netherlands. He translated several of his songs into Dutch, and wrote a couple of new ones. One of his songs, &quot;De nozem en de non&quot; (&quot;The Greaser and the Nun&quot;), was released as a single, without much popular success. His first Dutch album was only released in 1972, after ten successful Swedish albums. 100,000 copies of &quot;Cornelis Vreeswijk&quot; were sold, and the single &quot;Veronica&quot; became a big hit after it was picked up by the pirate radio station Veronica. His old song &quot;De nozem en de non&quot; was then re-recorded and released with much success. His later albums could not match the success of the first one, and Vreeswijk never achieved the fame in the Netherlands that he did in Sweden.

Nowadays, only &quot;De nozem en de non&quot; is still known by the general Dutch public. Vreeswijk still has some fans in the Netherlands, however, and in 2000 the Cornelis Vreeswijk society was founded.

One reason for his lack of popularity in the Netherlands was the impression that he was a bit old-fashioned. Because of his long stay in Sweden, though he never became a citizen, the Dutch pronunciation and idiom that he had learned to speak in his youth were out-of-date in the seventies and eighties.

Although he was fluent in both Dutch and Swedish, the latter became his primary language. His Stockholm-accented Swedish was famously witty and expressive.

==Later life==
He gave his last concert in Uppsala in September 1987, suffering from liver cancer and diabetes. He recorded his last album and a book of poetry, both entitled &quot;Till Fatumeh&quot;. He travelled one last time to the Netherlands to see his family, returned to Stockholm and died soon afterwards.

<text>Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense (CBRN defense) or Nuclear, biological, and chemical protection (NBC protection) is a class of protective measures taken in situations where chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (including terrorism) hazards may be present. CBRN defense consists of CBRN passive protection, contamination avoidance, and weapons of mass destruction mitigation.

A CBRN incident differs from a hazardous material incident in both scope (i.e., CBRN can be a mass casualty situation) and intent. CBRN incidents are responded to under the assumption that they are intentional and malicious; evidence preservation and perpetrator apprehension are of greater concern than with Hazmat team incidents.

A 2011 forecast concluded that worldwide government spending on CBRN defense products and services would reach US$8.38Â billion that year.

==Etymology==
In English, the 1990s term &quot;CBRN&quot; (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) was created as a replacement for the 1960sâ1980s term &quot;NBC&quot; (Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical), which had previously replaced the earlier 1950s term &quot;ABC&quot; (Atomic, Biological, and Chemical). The addition of the &quot;R&quot; (for &quot;Radiological&quot;) is a consequence of the &quot;new&quot; threat of a radiological weapon (also known as &quot;dirty bombs&quot;). In the 2000s, the term &quot;CBRNE&quot; (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive) was introduced as an extension of &quot;CBRN&quot;, the inclusion of the &quot;E&quot; (for &quot;Explosive&quot;) is for the enhanced (improvised) explosives threat.

In Spanish the term () has replaced &quot;NBQ&quot;.

==By country or region==

===Argentina===

The Argentine Armed Forces has the BatallÃ³n de Ingenieros QBN 601 of the Argentine Army, was the first CRBN response team created, in the 1990s, as a part of the country&#x27;s Rapid Deployment Force. The PolicÃ­a Federal Argentina have the Brigada de Riesgos Especiales, this unit is the only national response for CBRN/HAZMAT incidents. Also, has three units called Riesgo Quimico y BiolÃ³gico, Riesgo RadiolÃ³gico y Nuclear, and the tactical response unit called ProtecciÃ³n QBNR.

===Brazil===

Brazilian firefighters are trained for NBC situations. During the 2016 Summer Olympics, police forces like the GATE from SÃ£o Paulo, the Federal Police, and the National Public Security Force were prepared.

In the military, there is CBRN equipment and personnel in all branches of the Armed Forces. The Brazilian Army has two specific teams: the 1st Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense Battalion, which is based in Rio de Janeiro and is responsible for decontaminating military equipment, weapons, and personnel, and the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense Company, based at GoiÃ¢nia and part of the Brazilian Special Operations Command, that makes the decontamination and defense in CBRN situations. The Brazilian Presidential Guard and Army Police also have CBRN units.

The Brazilian Marine Corps has the CDefNBQR (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical and Radiological Defense Center) that controls the ARAMAR Nuclear, Biological, Chemical and Radiological Defense Battalion, at IperÃ³, SÃ£o Paulo, conceived to provide physical security and to perform CBRN emergencies control actions at the Centro Experimental Aramar, responsible for developing Brazilian Navy nuclear researches; the ItaguaÃ­ Nuclear, Biological, Chemical and Radiological Defense Battalion, at ItaguaÃ­, Rio de Janeiro, which is to be the host of the first Brazilian Navy nuclear-powered submarine; and the Nuclear, Biological, Chemical and Radiological Defense Company, at Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro. The Air Force is making special teams for transporting victims from CBRN attacks/accidents.

===Canada===

The term &quot;CBRN&quot; is in common use in disaster and emergency services organizations across the country. Since July 2005, the Canadian Armed Forces also started using the term &quot;CBRN Defence&quot;, instead of &quot;NBC Defence&quot;, due to the increased threat of dirty bomb use (which is radiological in nature). &quot;CBRNE&quot; is a new term that is being used in both civilian and military organizations. The Canadian Joint Incident Response Unit is a Canadian Forces unit, under the direction of the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command, charged with supporting &quot;the Government of Canada in order to prevent, control and mitigate CBRN threats to Canada, Canadians and Canadian interests.&quot;

All members of the Canadian Armed Forces are trained in CBRNE defense and maintain minimum standards, tested at least every three years.

At the provincial level, cities are provided opportunities for emergency services with CBRN training. In Ontario, emergency services in Windsor, Peterborough, Toronto, and Ottawa have obtained CBRN standing at NFPA Standard 472 Level 3 Technician level.

=== European Union ===
In mid-July 2016, the European Parliament negotiated a new draft counterterrorism directive aimed at protecting Europe&#x27;s people from biological, chemical and other attacks. The timeline of the directive is illustrated in the following table:

The directive would criminalize:
* Certain acts related to preparing for a terrorist attack, such as traveling abroad to meet with a terrorist group
* Training to make explosives, firearms, and other dangerous substances
* Public incitement or praise for terrorism and financing of terrorism
The directive also includes text to help victims of terror attacks.

===Hong Kong===
Hong Kong has had CBRN response capabilities since the early 1990s and advanced training from 1998. The Standing CBRN Planning Group (known as the SRPG) plans for all CBRN incidents in Hong Kong. The SRPG was set up with the support of the Secretary for Security by the Senior Bomb Disposal Officer in Hong Kong, Dominic Brittain. It consists of representatives from 9 government departments who plan the response to CBRN threats. These departments include Police EOD, Fire Services, the Hospital Authority and the Department of Health, amongst others. The operational arm of the SRPG is the CBRN Incident Advisory Group (RIAG) form in the initial stages of a CBRN incident using telephone conferencing. RIAG consists of five experts who assist with the technical response to the incident by providing real-time advice and support to the departments involved. The Hong Kong capability is well rehearsed, with regular departmental exercises conducted and a full-scale CBRN exercise conducted every year.

Main products such as SR6 and SR6M NBC Respirator licensed United Kingdom production. MAKSAM Panoramic Mask MKE NEFES (breath) CBRN Gas Mask SR10 and SR10 ST Masks

===United Kingdom===

&quot;CBRN&quot; is also used by the UK Home Office as a civil designation. Police, fire and ambulance services in the UK must all have some level of CBRN providers. Within the ambulance service, this is performed by the Hazardous Area Response Team (HART) and Special Operations Response Team (SORT). Since the introduction of new equipment to UK fire services under the New Dimension program, CBRN decontamination of personnel (including members of the public) has become a task carried out by fire services in the UK and they regularly train for such scenarios. 

Army

All personnel are trained in CBRN through basic training and are to complete an online assessment annually. 

The British Army has a single dedicated regiment for all C-CBRN (Counter) matters in the armed forces. 28 Engineer Regiment is the only regiment within the armed forces that has full C-CBRN capability. Formed in 2019 the regiment will officially be at full operational capability from early 2023, with the need for CBRN specialists becoming of more importance.

Personnel within the regiment are trained in live environments where CBRN materials are used.

===United States===


The United States Army uses &quot;CBRN&quot; as an abbreviation for their Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Operations Specialists (MOS). The United States Army trains all US Army soldiers pursuing a career in CBRN at the United States Army CBRN School (USACBRNS) at Fort Leonard Wood.

The USAF uses Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC 3E9X1) U.S. Air Force Emergency Management, who are also CBRN Specialists. The USAF trains all US Airmen pursuing a career in counter-CBRN operations at the USAF CBRN School at Fort Leonard Wood.

The USN requires all personnel to take a web-based CBRNE training annually to get a basic understanding of facts and procedures related to responding to a CBRNE incident.

===Russia===

The Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops (NBC Protection Troops) of the Russian Federation are special forces designed to conduct the most complex set of measures aimed at reducing the loss of associations and formations of the Ground Forces and ensuring their combat tasks assigned during operations in conditions of radioactive, chemical and biological contamination, as well as at enhancing their survivability and protection against high-precision and other weapons.

The Russian government vaccinated around half a million reindeer against anthrax in 2015. Around 1.5 million reindeer carcasses in Russian permafrost are at risk of melting due to global warming in the Arctic. There is a risk that global warming in the Arctic can thaw the permafrost, leading to new infections in reindeer. An anthrax outbreak in 2016 in reindeer caused the Russian Armed Forces to evacuate a nomadic reindeer herding tribe.

In May 2012, BioPrepWatch reported that the Russian security service ordered over 100 &quot;capsule cradles&quot;, which are devices that people can use to protect infants or even small pets in the event of a nuclear, chemical, biological, or radiological threat. According to the article, Soviet military engineers invented capsules in the 1960s. A company is currently producing the capsules in a factory in Russia.

==CBRN products==

Numbers vary, but news reports and market forecast reports place the market for CBRN products in 2013 and 2014 between US$8.7â8.8 billion. The market for CBRN products was expected to grow to over US$13 billion by 2023.

<doc id="645962" wikidata="Q325017" url="?curid=645962" title="Causewayed enclosure">
<text>A causewayed enclosure is a type of large prehistoric earthwork common to the early Neolithic in Europe. It is an enclosure marked out by ditches and banks, with a number of causeways crossing the ditches. More than 100 examples are recorded in France and 70 in Southern England and Wales, while further sites are known in Scandinavia, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Ireland and Slovakia.

The term &quot;causewayed enclosure&quot; is now preferred to the older term, causewayed camp, as it has been demonstrated that the sites did not necessarily serve as occupation sites.

Archaeologists have speculated on the purposes of such sites, but have not arrived at a consensus as to their function.

==Construction==
Causewayed enclosures are often located on hilltop sites, encircled by one to four concentric ditches with an internal bank. Enclosures located in lowland areas are generally larger than hilltop ones. Crossing the ditches at intervals are causeways which give the monuments their names. It appears that the ditches were excavated in sections, leaving the wide causeways intact in between. They should not be confused with segmented, or causewayed ring ditches, which are smaller and are thought to relate only to funerary activity, or with hillforts, which appeared later and had a definite defensive function. With regard to defensive functionality, however, evidence of timber palisades has been found at some sites such as Hambledon Hill.

==Function==
Archaeological evidence implies that the enclosures were visited occasionally by Neolithic groups rather than being permanently occupied. The presence of human remains in the banks and ditches of the enclosures has been seen as an attempt by the builders to connect their ancestors with the land and thus begin to anchor themselves to specific areas. Longitudinal sections excavated along the ditches by archaeologists suggest that the builders repeatedly redug the ditches and each time deliberately deposited pottery and human and animal bones, apparently as a regular ritual. Environmental archaeology suggests that the European landscape was heavily forested when the enclosures were built; they were rare clearings in the woodland that were used for various social and economic activities.

In the 1970s the archaeologist Peter Drewett suggested seven possible functions for the sites:

* Settlement
* Defence
* Cattle compounds or kraals
* Trade centres
* Communal meeting places for feasting and other social activities
* Cult/ritual centres
* Burial sites

Other interpretations have seen the causeways as symbolic of multi-directional access to the site by scattered communities, the enclosures as funerary centres for excarnation or the construction of the site being a communal act of creation by a fragmented society.

Animal remains (especially cattle bone), domestic waste and pottery have been found at the sites, however there has been limited evidence of any structures. In some locations, such as Windmill Hill, Avebury, evidence of human occupation predates the enclosure. Generally, it appears that the ditches were permitted to silt up, even while the camps were in use, and then re-excavated episodically. It is unlikely that they had a strong defensive purpose. The earthworks may have been designed to keep out wild animals rather than people. The sequential addition of second, third and fourth circuits of banks and ditches may have come about through growing populations adding to the significance of their peoples&#x27; monument over time. In some cases, they appear to have evolved into more permanent settlements.

Most causewayed enclosures have been ploughed away in the intervening millennia and are recognized through aerial archaeology.

== Dating ==
The first causewayed enclosures were constructed in Western Europe in the fifth millennium BC and by the early third millennium BC; notable regional variations occur in their construction. French examples begin to demonstrate elaborate horn-shaped entrances which are interpreted as being designed to impress from afar rather than serve any practical purpose.

The dates of construction and use of causwayed enclosures in Britain and Ireland were the subject of a seminal study using Bayesian analysis of radiocarbon dates, &quot;Gathering Time&quot;, which provided unprecedented historical precision for the Neolithic period. This showed that following the start of the Neolithic in Britain, i.e. the arrival of the first farmers in the 41st century BC, the first monuments built were long barrows, which became popular at the end of the 39th century, that is, around 3800 BC (or a few decades later ). The fashion for causewayed enclosures took off in the late 38th century, starting in east Britain and rapidly spreading west, with construction peaking in the third quarter of the 37th century. At this time the long barrows were closed up or at least went out of use. Following a lull, a final round of construction of causewayed enclosures happened in the 36th century, and at the same time the usage of existing enclosures (as marked by deposition in the ditches, and continued re-cutting) increased. Some enclosures were in use for only a generation, while others, such as the type site, Windmill Hill, Avebury, and Hambledon Hill, were used for centuries, continuing until the 35th or 34th centuries BC. Throughout this period of primary use, a number of examples were identified of violence and attacks at enclosures. After the 36th century, a new type of monument, the cursus, became popular. All this long preceded the earliest henge monuments, including Stonehenge I.

<text>The United States Shipping Board (USSB) was a corporation established as an emergency agency by the 1916 Shipping Act (39 Stat. 729), on September 7, 1916. The United States Shipping Board&#x27;s task was to increase the number of US ships supporting the World War I efforts. The program ended on March 2, 1934.

== Initiation ==
The United States had a maritime position that had been eroding for decades with some congressional concern. Some remedies actually worsened the situation since European shipping companies dominated overseas trade, and just over 10% of the value of trade carried in American-owned ships. The 1916 Act was the result of congressional efforts to create a board to address the problem dating from 1914. The legislation was not then a part of any war effort with specific intent, as stated in the act:

:An Act to establish a United States Shipping Board for the purpose of encouraging, developing, and creating a naval auxiliary and naval reserve and a Merchant Marine to meet the requirements of the commerce of the United States with its territories and possessions and with foreign countries; to regulate carriers by water engaged in the foreign and interstate commerce of the United States for other purposes.

A board of five commissioners was to be appointed by the US president with confirmation by the US Senate as the United States Shipping Board (USSB) to acquire and construct suitable vessels and to create corporations under its control to execute the programs. In essence, the board was given &quot;complete control over American ships and shipping.&quot;

US President Woodrow Wilson made public his nominations for the board on December 22, 1916, with some dissatisfaction in the shipping industry about particular nominees and the board&#x27;s power to set ocean freight rates raising particular concern and skepticism. The initial nominees were:

* William Denman (chairman), who was instrumental in drafting the legislation for the establishment of the board for a term of six years.
* Bernard N. Baker for five years.
* John A. Donald for four years.
* James B. White for three years.
* Theodore Brent for a term of two years. 

The members of the board gathered in Washington in the first week of January 1917 to plan and organize while they awaited confirmation, which came in late January. The board&#x27;s formal organization was on January 30.

US vessels had suffered a disadvantage, and the laws passed by Congress had in some cases had the effect of giving advantage to European shipping, instead of the desired effect of making the country no longer heavily dependent on foreign shipping. With the outbreak of war in Europe, the national fleets of the warring countries became involved in those countries&#x27; wartime efforts and were withdrawn from commercial trade, which was vital to US commerce. One initial step was granting authority to the president to allow registration of foreign-built ships owned by US companies to enter the US registry and operate under the US flag and to repeal certain penalties for those using foreign-built vessels. The net effect was negligible as shipbuilding in the United States declined almost equally with the benefits gained.

The US entered the war just over two months after the board had begun its work, which completely changed its focus from generally strengthening the nation&#x27;s maritime position to a massive wartime program. Though it was sometimes referred to as the War Shipping Board, the official title remained the United States Shipping Board.

The board was to address the shortage of shipping through acquisition of existing hulls and, with the declaration of war by the United States on Germany on 6 April 1917, a construction program through its Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFC) was created 16 April. The precedent for using such a corporation had been set during the construction of the Panama Canal during which the Panama Railway Company was charged with much of the construction and had its stock entirely owned by the US Secretary of War. The Shipping Act had explicitly empowered the board to found such a company, which was done with issuance of $50,000,000 in stock all initially held by the board; the majority portion had to be retained, and another provision required the trustees of the EFC to hold stock. During the war, Congress granted the president extraordinary wartime powers, which were used by means of Executive Orders to expand the board&#x27;s authority and its corporation. The board, as a regulatory and policy body, executed its programs largely through the EFC, a separate entity that was fully under the policy control of the majority stockholder, the board. The Chairman of the USSB was initially the head of the EFC, but the General Manager had all real authority except the power to sign contracts.

The division of authority between the USSB and the EFC and the construction program&#x27;s direction led to conflict between USSB Chairman Denman and EFC General Manager Major-General George Washington Goethals. That resulted in the resignation of both men and the reconstitution of the board and the corporation.

The new USSB composition, which remained throughout the war was Edward N. Hurley as chairman, with Raymond B. Stevens replacing James B. White as vice-chairman and John Donald, Bainbridge Colby and Charles R. Page as members. Rear Admiral Washington L. Capps, formerly Constructor of the Navy and Chief of the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Construction, became the General Manager of the EFC.

==World War I==
Shipbuilding before America entered the war had been expanded to some extent, with domestic shipping companies replacing ships withdrawn from trade by belligerents and both the United Kingdom and neutral countries contracting for ships in US yards. The UK had contracted for ships through private British companies for security and for US neutrality needs. In March 1917, just before the US entered the war and the USSB shifted to full wartime operations, there were about 700,000 tons of new construction underway for the private US owners, and all 234 building ways in the US were occupied by either those or by ships for neutral and domestic shipping lines. There was no possibility for a quick expansion of capacity to incorporate the USSB/EFC shipbuilding program.

===Providing hulls===
====Interned enemy ships====

The most readily available hulls were 91 German vessels of aggregate tonnage refurbished for use by the USSB and under legislation of 12 May 1917 and an executive order of 30 June 1917 giving the USSB formal power to seize the vessels and enter them into the US registry. The report of December 1918 showed one Austrian steamer, 87 German steamers that now included four from Cuba, and seven sailing vessels seized. Some of Germany&#x27;s premier liners, such as , , , &quot;Astoria&quot;, &quot;Pensacola&quot;, &quot;Aeolus&quot;, &quot;Mercury&quot;, &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, &quot;Powhatan&quot;, &quot;Prinz Eitel Friedrich&quot;, &quot;Republic&quot;, &quot;President Lincoln&quot;, &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm II&quot;, &quot;Antigone&quot;, &quot;Rhein&quot;, &quot;Kronprinz Wilhelm&quot;, &quot;Covington&quot;, &quot;Friedrich der GroÃe&quot; and , were among the seized ships.

On 15 November 1917, the USSB authorized negotiations with foreign countries that had seized German or Austrian ships with actual discussions that continued until January 1918. The result was the charter or the outright purchase of a number of ships interned from South America to China.

====Commandeering existing construction====

The USSB&#x27;s first action regarding new construction was commandeering every contract, hull, and even steel in the US yards for ships over . The first order was signed by Chairman Hurley on 3 August 1917, to be executed by the EFC to secure control of the shipyards and construction already underway. The action was immediately protested by nearly every shipyard and owner of the ships under construction, with the foreign owners protesting through the US State Department. A large number of the contracts and ships under construction for foreign accounts were for the United Kingdom, and the protest was solved with the British government&#x27;s agreement that the ships would be used in the total war effort. With one exception, a new ship from Union Iron Works that had already loaded for departure, &quot;War Sword&quot;, the contracts and the ships were requisitioned.

Out of 431 such ships, totaling , 414 of the requisitioned were completed after cancellations of some contracts for ships of unwanted design that were in early stages of construction or not yet laid down. A very large group of these ships, contracted with names prefixed with &quot;War&quot; and renamed before completion, were being built for the British Shipping Controller of Ministry of Shipping under various shipping line contracts. Examples of such ships are , which became USS &quot;West Bridge&quot;, and one of the Great Lakes built ships, originally &quot;War Bayonet&quot;, which became USS &quot;Lake Superior&quot; for the first war and USS &quot;Tuluran&quot; for the second. Others among the ships found service in the next war; for example, &quot;War Dido&quot; was torpedoed and sunk as in 1941, and &quot;War Dragon&quot; was seized by Japan and sunk as &quot;Renzan Maru&quot; by on 1 January 1943. Some being built for domestic shippers had long careers, with and &quot;Oriente&quot; being examples.

====Construction program====
The Board&#x27;s construction program, most notably the Hog Islander ships, was executed through the Emergency Fleet Corporation, which it established on 16 April 1917.
The shipbuilding program was concluded with the 9 May 1922 delivery of the ship completed and delivered as &quot;Western World&quot;, launched as &quot;Nutmeg State&quot; 17 September 1921, by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation at Sparrows Point, Maryland.

===Ship management===
When ships were delivered from the builder to the USSB, they came under the management of the Division of Operations, which allocated them to the US War Department, US Navy Department, or commercial service, based on needs and the class and type of ship. By December 1918, the division had become the largest ship operating entity in US history, with a total fleet of 1,386 vessels totaling owned outright, managed, or chartered.

For more control of traffic required by the war effort, methods applied by the British were employed in which rates were adjusted and control was exercised through the division&#x27;s Chartering Committee, whose approval was necessary to obtain license to refuel in US ports. With American-registered ships already under tight control, those regulations were largely directed at neutrals. A specific example was the preferred trade by neutrals in manganese with eastern South America when the war effort required nitrates from the west of the continent. The board&#x27;s efforts were directed to shift the balance. Enforcement of rates was strict and at one point, before wide compliance, 136 steamers were held in US ports. By December 1918, the USSB directly controlled such a large portion of US shipping through ownership and charter that the USSB&#x27;s prewar rate-setting regulatory function had largely become a minor factor.

A Maritime Intelligence Department in the division and a separate Division of Planning and Statistics collected and analyzed shipping data to help determine what level of shipping was necessary for commerce and how much could be shifted to the war effort.

===Ship manning===
As of 1 June 1917, the USSB established a recruiting service with headquarters in Boston, with the first of an eventual 43 training centers, in recognition that traditional methods were too slow for the rapid wartime expansion for deck officers, at Cambridge, Massachusetts on 4 June. A second set of schools was created for engineering officers with those engineers destined for turbine powered ships being sent to the builders of turbines for training. The early result, between 1 June 1917 and 1 October 1918 was 11,618 licensed officers. The officer training was expanded to training for crew, deck sailors, firemen, wipers, cooks, and stewards by December 1917 and was open to all male citizens of the ages 18 to 20 or 32 to 35 with a goal expanded from an estimated 85,000 to 200,000 because of the revised estimates of ships by the end of the war.

To ensure that labor problems did not disrupt necessary war shipping, the USSB employed special labor consultants and entered agreements with labor and other government agencies to resolve labor disputes directly and also to standardize wages across the industry. One of the USSB organizations that as specifically concerned with the issue was the Marine and Dock Industrial Relations Division, which was to coordinate all labor related matters, and by late 1918, industry and labor had begun referring disputes to the board and thus avoided any stoppages.

=== National Adjustment Commission ===
The National Adjustment Commission was established in 1917 as an adjunct to the USSB for the adjustment and control of wages, hours, and conditions of labor in the loading and the unloading of vessels. In 1918, the initial operation and policies of the commission was agreed to between the USSB and the following parties:
* US Secretary of War
* US Secretary of Labor
* American Federation of Labor
* International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association
* Major shipping companies on the Atlantic and the Gulf Coasts.

Subsequently, additional shipping companies and labor organizations entered the agreement with modifications. William Z. Ripley was chairman of the commission from 1919 to 1920.

In July 1920, the USSB withdrew from the commission agreement and decided to deal with shipping workers directly. The commission ceased operations on October 1, 1920.

==Postwar and abolishment==
In 1921, the USSB was described as &quot;probably the wealthiest corporation in the United States, and certainly by far the largest shipping organization in the world.&quot; At the time, it had approximately 1,500 sea-going vessels and employed approximately 60,000 seamen, as well as paid for the services of 75,000 workers in shipyards and 100,000 longshoremen.

The USSB operated a shipping business with its surplus ships until 1920, when the overseas freight market collapsed, and it began to lay up its vessels. In 1925, Henry Ford bought 199 of the out-of-service ships for $1,697,470 as part of an investigation into the secondary use of materials. The first ship reached the Ford River Rouge Complex in November, and all of the remaining ships were broken down and recycled the following summer.

The USSB was abolished effective March 2, 1934.

Its successor agencies have been:

* The US Shipping Board Bureau of the US Department of Commerce (1933â36).
* The US Maritime Commission (1936â50).
* The US Federal Maritime Board of the US Department of Commerce (regulatory functions only, 1950â61).
* The US Federal Maritime Commission (regulatory functions only, 1961â).
* The US Maritime Administration of the Department of Commerce (all other functions, 1950â81).
* The US Maritime Administration of the US Department of Transportation (all other functions, 1981â).

== U.S. Shipping Commissioners ==
* 1920â1921 Joseph Nathan Teal
*1921 - 1923 Albert Lasker
*1923 - Edward P. Farley

From 1924 to 1933, the board was instead chaired by T. V. O&#x27;Connor.

<text>The Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP) was the police force of Dublin in British-controlled Ireland from 1836 to 1922 and then the Irish Free State until 1925, when it was absorbed into the new state&#x27;s Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na.

==History==
===19th century===
The Dublin city police had been subject to major reforms in 1786 and 1808. Organised rural policing in Ireland began when Robert Peel, then Chief Secretary for Ireland, created the Peace Preservation Force in 1814. This rudimentary paramilitary police force was designed to provide policing in rural Ireland, replacing the 18th century system of watchmen, baronial constables, revenue officers and British military forces. Peel went on to found the London Metropolitan Police.

In 1822, a new act created four improved &quot;county&quot; constabularies, whose organisation was based around the traditional provinces of Ireland.

====1836: reform====

In 1836, the county constabularies were merged into a new centralised Constabulary of Ireland, and the Peace Preservation Force ceased to exist. At the same time separate non-paramilitary forces were set up in the largest cities: Dublin, Belfast, and Derry. A perceived lack of impartiality following rioting in the municipal police forces of Belfast and Derry saw both forces absorbed by the national force in 1865 and 1870 respectively, and only Dublin maintained its separate force. The DMP was established under the Dublin Police Act 1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4. c. 29) as an unarmed, uniformed force of one thousand day and night constables. The Castle-controlled organisation was more accountable than the untrained constables and night watchmen it replaced.

The 1836 Act authorised the &quot;chief governor of Ireland&quot; to establish a police office in Dublin, supported by two salaried justices, to administer the police force which would be under the direction of the Chief Secretary for Ireland. It also provided for the recruitment and appointment of policemen and the regulation of their conduct. It also created powers of arrest and made arrangements for the financial affairs of the new force, including new taxation.

The DMP was modelled closely on London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police. Not only were the uniforms of the two forces almost indistinguishable, especially after the helmet and Bath Star were adopted, but the two forces also had a similar organisational structure; rather than a Chief Constable, they were commanded by a Commissioner, who was not a police officer, but a magistrate holding a Commission of the Peace. The first Commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police was John Lewis More O&#x27;Ferrall, brother of Richard More O&#x27;Ferrall. This was descended from the 18th century system of controlling parish constables, and was a sop to the public&#x27;s fears about the danger of a standing police force under government control.

====1880s: Land War====
The force came under considerable pressure in the 1880s during the Land War, in which 500 policemen were injured. A series of protest meetings were held and strikes were threatened in 1882.

===20th century===
====1913â14: Dublin Lock-out====
Two men died and several hundred people were injured over the course of the five-month Dublin Lock-out, including two hundred policemen. Although the police were involved in &quot;frequent collisions&quot; with union members and used tactics such as baton charges against them, a vice-regal commission cleared them of wrongdoing after the events â though their reputation had suffered considerably.

====1916 onwards====
As an unarmed urban force, the Dublin Metropolitan Police did not participate as actively in the War of Independence as did the RIC, and as such did not suffer the casualty rate of that force, although three men were killed and seven injured. One of their number David Neligan (who was an IRA agent) records in his book &quot;The Spy in the Castle&quot; that the majority of the DMP uniformed personnel observed a neutral role, restricted to traditional policing functions. The political &quot;G&quot; Division did not come off so lightly, and selected &quot;G men&quot; were first given warnings by the Irish Republican Army in April 1919. Five members of &quot;G&quot; Division were subsequently killed by the IRA, the first in July 1919. Several DMP officers actively assisted the IRA, most notably Edward Broy, who passed valuable intelligence to Michael Collins throughout the conflict.

In the 1996 film &quot;Michael Collins&quot;, Broy is discovered and subsequently tortured and killed by the British. In reality, he was not caught and went on to become the Commissioner of the in the 1930s. His fate in the film is based on that of Dick McKee, who, with Peadar Clancy and the civilian Conor Clune, was murdered after torture in Dublin Castle on &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;, 21 November 1920.

After the creation of the Irish Free State, the DMP became known as (&quot;Police of Dublin&quot;) from 1922 to 1925, after which the force ceased to exist as a separate entity, being absorbed into the (&quot;Guardians of the Peace&quot;). Its last Commissioner was W.R.E. Murphy. &quot;Dublin Metropolitan&quot; is today a geographic region of the &#x27;s command structure.

Unlike the RIC, but in common with police forces in Great Britain, the DMP was an unarmed force. In contrast to the green uniformed RIC, the DMP wore dark blue with silver insignia.

<doc id="645972" wikidata="Q5304088" url="?curid=645972" title="Dr. Finlay">
<text>Dr Finlay is a fictional character, the hero of a series of stories by Scottish author A. J. Cronin.

==Short stories==
The character Dr Finlay first appeared in Cronin&#x27;s novella &quot;Country Doctor&quot; and in several subsequent short stories published in &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International Combined with Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine from 1935 to 1939. The stories were later collected and republished under several titles, including &quot;Adventures of a Black Bag&quot;, &quot;Dr Finlay of Tannochbrae&quot;, &quot;Further Adventures of a Country Doctor&quot; and &quot;Dr Finlay&#x27;s Casebook&quot;. 

Dr Finlay is a general physician beginning his practice in the fictional Scottish town of Levenford. One of the later short stories takes him to the lochside village of Tannochbrae. In these stories he is charming and becomes well-acquainted with his patients over many years. It is thus his trademark to know them from birth to death and so provide a continuous relationship.

==Adaptations==
The stories were used as the basis of the long-running BBC television programme &quot;Dr Finlay&#x27;s Casebook&quot;, screened from 1962 to 1971, and the radio series of the same title (1970â78). In these productions the main character, rechristened Dr Alan Finlay, was played by Bill Simpson. He was made the newly joined junior partner in the Tannochbrae practice of Dr Angus Cameron, played by Andrew Cruickshank, with Janet, their unflappable housekeeper and receptionist at Arden House, played by Barbara Mullen. 

Dr Finlay returned to television in the ITV series, &quot;Doctor Finlay&quot;, continuing the stories into the late 1940s. This version starred David Rintoul as Dr Finlay, Ian Bannen as Dr Cameron and Annette Crosbie as Janet. It was later broadcast in the U.S. on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;. 

The characters made their return to radio in 2001, when BBC Radio 4 broadcast a six-episode series, &quot;Dr Finlay: Adventures of a Black Bag&quot;, set in Levenford, with John Gordon Sinclair voicing Dr Finlay, Brian Pettifer as Dr Cameron, Katy Murphy as Janet and the nurse Peggy Angus played by Sharon Small. This was followed by two series of &quot;Dr Finlay: Further Adventures of a Black Bag&quot; in 2002 and 2003, with Sinclair and Pettifer joined by Celia Imrie as Janet and Stella Gonet as Nurse Angus.

A Dutch adaptation of the Doctor Finlay series entitled &quot;Memorandum van een dokter&quot; was broadcast on Dutch television from 1963 to 1965 , starring Bram van der Vlugt.

<doc id="645979" wikidata="Q1466284" url="?curid=645979" title="FA Youth Cup">
<text>The Football Association Youth Challenge Cup is an English football competition run by The Football Association for under-18 sides. Only those players between the age of 15 and 18 on 31 August of the current season are eligible to take part. It is dominated by the youth sides of professional teams, mostly from the Premier League, but attracts over 400 entrants from throughout the country.

At the end of the Second World War the FA organised a Youth Championship for County Associations considering it the best way to stimulate the game among those youngsters not yet old enough to play senior football. The matches did not attract large crowds but outstanding players were selected for Youth Internationals and thousands were given the chance to play in a national contest for the first time. In 1951 it was realised that a competition for clubs would probably have a wider appeal. The FA Youth Challenge Cup (1952â53 season) was restricted to the youth teams of clubs, both professional and amateur, who were members of the FA.

The notion of a youth cup was thought of by Sir Joe Richards, the late President of the Football League. He initially put forward the idea to the league clubs but they were not enthused; Richards then took the idea to the Football Association, who liked the idea and created the competition in the same year. The Youth Cup trophy itself was purchased by the Football League during World War II. However, they never found a use for it. Football League secretary Fred Howarth found the trophy in a cupboard at the Starkie Street office and handed it over to the Football Association.

Manchester United are the competition&#x27;s most successful club, winning it eleven times. The current holders are Manchester City, who defeated Leeds United 4â0 in the 2024 final.

The tournament has served as a springboard into the professional game for many top British players. The likes of George Best, John Barnes, Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Frank Lampard, Michael Owen, Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher, Joe Cole, Wayne Rooney, Theo Walcott, Daniel Sturridge, Jack Wilshere, and Gareth Bale had all won the tournament or played in the final. The 1991â92 FA Youth Cup famously spawned the rise of Fergie&#x27;s Fledglings.

==Finals==

==Performance by clubs==
== Hat-tricks ==
&quot;Including qualifying and preliminary round matches.&quot;

=== Multiple hat-tricks ===
Players who have scored multiple hat-tricks in the FA Youth Cup. As players are usually only eligible for the FA Youth Cup for one or two seasons (rather than indefinitely/their whole career), scoring multiple hat-tricks is an even more exceptional feat.
=== FA Girls&#x27; Youth Cup hat-tricks ===

The FA Girls&#x27; Youth Cup has been contested since at least 2012, and is the equivalent competition for under-17 women&#x27;s association football teams. Of the known hat-tricks, all have been in scored in matches featuring Blackburn Rovers W.F.C.: two for Blackburn Rovers and one in the 2012â13 final against them.
==Attendance record==
The highest attendance at an FA Youth Cup match was 67,492 for the Manchester United vs Nottingham Forest final at Old Trafford on 11 May 2022, which Manchester United won 3â1.

<text>The Travers River is in the South Island of New Zealand.

It lies within the borders of the Nelson Lakes National Park. The valley through which the river flows is popular with trampers and is part of the Travers-Sabine tramping circuit, which follows a major portion of the river, starting from Kerr Bay at Saint Arnaud and, after crossing the Travers Saddle (1787 metres), descends the valley of the Sabine River.

The river feeds into Lake Rotoiti. It is not a navigable waterway due to its small size and numerous rocky cascades. The lower reaches of the river lie in open tussock which was burnt and grazed by early European settlers. Further upstream the river flows through unmodified beech forest. The upper reaches are in subalpine scrub above the bushline.

The New Zealand Department of Conservation maintains a number of mountain huts and shelters along the length of the Travers Valley and within the surrounding mountains. These include the Lake Head Hut, Coldwater Hut, the Angelus Hut, the Hopeless Hut, the Cupola Basin Hut, John Tait Hut, and the Upper Travers Hut. Details of these can be obtained from the DOC Visitors Centre in Saint Arnaud.

The river, as well as the nearby Mount Travers, the Travers Range, and the Travers-Sabine Circuit in Nelson Lakes National Park are named after the 19th-century New Zealand politician and naturalist William Travers.

<doc id="645983" wikidata="Q7305148" url="?curid=645983" title="Red Symons">
<text>Redmond Symons (born 13 June 1949) is an Australian musician and television and radio personality. He was the lead guitarist in the band Skyhooks, the snide judge of &#x27;Red Faces&#x27; (a segment of the long-running variety show &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;) and a judge on talent search show &quot;Australia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. He hosted ABC Radio Melbourne&#x27;s breakfast show from 2003 until 2017.

==Early life and education==

Born in England, he emigrated to Australia at the age of nine in 1958 (on the same ship as the members of the Bee Gees). Symons was educated at Emerald Primary School, Monbulk High School, Upwey High School and the University of Melbourne, where he resided at Queen&#x27;s College and obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in pure mathematics and computer science.

==Career==
===Musical career===
After graduating, Symons joined the Australian rock band Skyhooks as a guitarist in the 1970s. He also worked in the theatre as a musical director for several organisations, including The Pram Factory, a famous 1970s Melbourne theatre group. Symons also had three solo singles, &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Flipside&quot; (EMI 1976); &quot;The Big Time&quot; (Mushroom 1987); and &quot;Sex Appeal&quot; (Mushroom 1988); none of these songs entered the Australian top 100.

===Television career===

In 1985, Symons guest-starred in &quot;Neighbours&quot; as criminal Gordon Miller, Terry Robinson&#x27;s ex-husband.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, he combined his on-air role on &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; (also playing in the house band) with composing for various film and television shows (such as &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;) and jingle-writing.

Between 1992 and 1995, he played the role of the narrator in &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;, touring Australia and Singapore.

In 2003, he appeared on the Australian version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; and became the first Australian celebrity to reach the $500,000 question; however, he lost $218,000 after failing to answer that Benvenuto Cellini was an architect and not a sculptor, going away with $16,000 for his chosen charity and $16,000 for his home viewer.

Between 2001 and 2011, Symons appeared in advertisements for Thrifty-Link Hardware.

In February 2002, he hosted the Nine Network show &quot;Shafted&quot;, which was cancelled in April the same year. Later in 2002, he was a contestant on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;.

Symons&#x27; on-camera persona is a sarcastic killjoy, a role he apparently adopted through his appearance as third judge on &#x27;Red Faces&#x27;. On &quot;Test Australia: The National IQ Test&quot; he scored higher than any of the other celebrities with an IQ of 131.

In October 2005, Symons together with his wife, Elly, competed in and won the &#x27;Celebrity Couples Great Temptation&#x27; with Elly answering all the questions in the fast money round during the grand final. He also competed in Network Ten&#x27;s &quot;Australia&#x27;s Brainiest Comedian&quot; the following month, in which he came third.

In 2007, he signed with Channel Seven to be a judge on &quot;Australia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; along with Dannii Minogue and Tom Burlinson. He remained on the show until 2009 and was replaced by Brian McFadden.

In August 2008, Symons participated on a celebrity edition of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, on which he won $4,000 for a home viewer. He was also a regular member of the brains trust on ABC TV&#x27;s &quot;The Einstein Factor&quot;.

In 2009, Symons appeared on the two &quot;Hey Hey Reunion Specials&quot;, and in 2010, returned to the 20-episode airing of &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;.

He appeared on &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; again in February 2021 and won $1,000 after missing his tenth question, this time saying that the word &#x27;entrepreneur&#x27; came from the French for &#x27;present yourselves&#x27;, rather than &#x27;rendezvous&#x27;.

===Radio career===
Symons originally appeared as a presenter in a weekly slot on the ABC Radio Melbourne&#x27;s breakfast radio program. He then filled in for Lynne Haultain on the breakfast program while she was on maternity leave, replacing her permanently in that slot in 2003, and continuing in the role until late 2017.

In June 2017, Symons interviewed fellow ABC radio presenter Beverley Wang about her new podcast, &quot;It&#x27;s Not a Race&quot;. During the interview, Symons asked Wang questions such as &quot;What&#x27;s the deal with Asians?&quot;, &quot;Are they all the same?&quot; and &quot;Are you yellow?&quot;, and defended the infamous &quot;blackface&quot; skit on &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;. Most of the controversial comments were edited out of the broadcast interview, but Wang released the full interview on the podcast feed. The ABC removed the recording, saying that &quot;a review of the editorial processes around this content and its use is in progress&quot; and apologised for its broadcast.

In December 2017 Symons announced that he would not return to the breakfast presenter role in 2018 after he was advised that the ABC did not renew his contract.

==Personal life==
Symons married Elly Agrotis in 1990 and together they had three sons, Samuel, Raphael and Joel.

An &quot;Australian Story&quot; episode aired in February 2010 documented his son Samuel&#x27;s fifteen-year battle with cancer. The episode won a silver medal at the 2011 New York Festivals &quot;Worlds Best T.V. and Films&quot; Category and a Quill award in 2010 from the Melbourne Press Club for Best Current Affairs Feature.
Samuel died from an aggressive brain cancer on 3 October 2018 at the age of 27.

<doc id="645984" wikidata="Q5566957" url="?curid=645984" title="Glasgow University Union">
<text>Glasgow University Union (GUU) is one of the largest and oldest students&#x27; unions in the UK, serving students and alumni of the University of Glasgow since 1885.

The GUU organises social affairs for its members, provides catering and entertainment. Students are eligible to become members for free at any point throughout their University career and alumni may become Life Members by applying to the Board of Management.

==History==

===Foundation===
Students at the university instituted the idea of a union building in 1885 to help promote social interaction on campus. The union&#x27;s formation was driven by members of Glasgow University Dialectic Society, the Glasgow University Medico-Chirurgical Society and the Glasgow University Athletic Club. The same group formed a Studentsâ Representative Council in 1886 to raise funds for the building and procured the sum of Â£5000 from John McIntyre of Odiham, Hampshire.

In 1889 the Glasgow University Students&#x27; Representative Council obtained statutory recognition under the Act of 1889 and in 1890 they managed to raise sufficient funds to build the union.
The union was originally accommodated in the John McIntyre Building, named for a major benefactor, which opened in 1890 and was designed by John James Burnet. These premises soon proved to be inadequate however, and a new building at the foot of University Avenue was designed by the architect and former assistant to J.J. Burnet, Alan McNaughton of Arthur &amp; McNaughton in the Scots Baronial style. The new Union building was financed from funds raised by donations to the Student Welfare Scheme, started in 1921 to re-invigorate student life and was erected between 1929 and 1931, with the women of the Queen Margaret Union (QMU) moving into the John McIntyre Building in 1932. The John MacIntyre has been the location of the Glasgow University Students&#x27; Representative Council, since the new QMU building opened in 1969. An extension to the Glasgow University Union building was designed by Keppie, Henderson &amp; Partners and opened in 1965, which housed four bars: Deep Six, the Gallery Bar, Altitude and Playing Fields - and the union&#x27;s nightclub, The Hive.
The extension was closed in late January 2013, with demolition of the building following in July of that year. Construction of a new 4,191m2, Â£13.4 million sports and social facility designed by Page/Park Architects and ECD Architects began in June 2014. This is a shared premises with Glasgow University Sports Association. The GUU element of the building includes a revitalised Hive nightclub and three bars: The Well, Base and G12. The new facility was completed in September 2015 and formally launched on 17 October 2015.

===Two-union structure===
The GUU is one of two unions at the University of Glasgow, the other being the Queen Margaret Union, which was established in 1890, after the first matriculation of women at the university in the wake of its merger with Queen Margaret College.

The reason for this separation is that the GUU originally only permitted men to join, while the QMU only admitted women; in fact, the GUU was the last student union in the UK to have single-sex membership. In 1977, in the wake of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, there was a referendum to mix the two unions, but this was defeated by a large majority. A mixing campaign got seriously under way in 1979, at one point the strictly all-male &quot;Beer Bar&quot; being occupied by a large mixed group of students. An extraordinary general meeting of the QMU voted overwhelmingly to admit men into membership, a move which subverted the whole structure of separate unions. Eventually, in 1980, a GUU special general meeting voted overwhelmingly to admit women into membership, under threat from the University Court of losing the lease on the extension to its building, with just 139 votes against.

==Services==

===Board of Management===

Unlike most student unions, the GUU has no sabbatical officers. Instead, the Union&#x27;s affairs are controlled on behalf of the membership by a 26-member board of management, featuring 17 elected student positions, seven alumni positions and two ex-officio seats for the President of the Glasgow University Sports Association and the Past President.

The three-person executive committee is made up of the President, Honorary Secretary and Assistant Honorary Secretary. The President chairs the board and is responsible for special projects, external communications and external relations. The Honorary Secretary is responsible for day-to-day operations, membership experience and security &amp; licensing matters, as well as organising flagship events such as Freshers&#x27; Week and Daft Friday. This is supported by the Assistant Honorary Secretary, who is also responsible for managing the board and supporting them in operating the Union, whilst also handling the Union&#x27;s relationships with affiliated clubs and societies.

The Executive liaise with the building management daily to organise operations, and are supported by two alumni Vice Presidents (each elected for two-year terms with one up for re-election each year) and the Honorary Treasurer, who provide strategic guidance. Four conveners operate below this, managing their own committees of Debates, Games, Libraries and Entertainments, made up of Union members, which organise regular events during term-time. Ten Present Student Members are elected, five per year on a two-year term, to represent the members and partake in operational committees ranging from PR to Student Welfare and Sustainability. Four Former Student Members provide a voice for the Union&#x27;s alumni members as well as experience and support for the student members.

===Activities===

The GUU is a social hub for the university, providing the largest billiard hall in the West End, bars, live entertainment and a nightclub. It is one of the largest licensed premises in Scotland with nine bars (and a tenth which is portable for use during functions). In addition, members can eat in the Servery, relax in the Drawing Room Coffee Shop (formerly the Smoking Room), purchase essentials in the Union Shop and take advantage of two libraries provided for study.

The two libraries and the Reading Room, available for study and social events, are maintained by the Libraries Convener. The &quot;Elliot Library&quot; is named after former inter-war Cabinet Minister Walter Elliot; the &quot;Bridie Library&quot; after Osborne Mavor, physician, dramatist and founder of the Citizens Theatre, who wrote under the pseudonym, &quot;James Bridie&quot;. A mural by Fyffe Christie hangs in the room, illustrating the &quot;West End Perk&quot;, a poem by Bridie. The Reading Room is dedicated to Donald Dewar, former President of the Union, Secretary of State for Scotland and First Minister of Scotland, and a portrait hangs there in his memory.

==Daft Friday==
After its impromptu initiation as a piano Sing-along and Smoking concert by the then Honorary Secretary Osborne Henry Mavor on the last day of the 1908 Martinmas Academic term, the highlight of the Union&#x27;s social calendar is the annual &#x27;Daft Friday&#x27; black tie ball which continues to be held at the end of the Martinmas term exam diet. Over the years the event has become increasingly elaborate with the entire union building decorated to a theme and devoted to the festivities. Daft Friday is held as a celebration for the president of the union.

Over 2000 students attend the event, which includes revolves around a secret theme and hosts entertainments such as a swing band, string quartet, DJs, ceilidhs and laserquest. Well known bands have also played Daft Friday in recent years, including: Arcade Fire in 2008, Jack Penate in 2009, Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, Frightened Rabbit in 2011, Basshunter in 2012, Chvrches in 2013, Sub Focus in 2015, Gabrielle Aplin in 2016, Fickle Friends in 2017 and the Hoosiers in 2018.

The evening also includes the James Bridie Memorial dinner; a seven course meal for around 150 guests. Speakers at the 2011 dinner included Charles Kennedy and David Ross, both of whom are former presidents of the union.

==Debating==
The GUU is one of the most successful university debating institutions in the world, winning the World Universities Debating Championship five times, the European Universities Debating Championships once and the John Smith Memorial Mace a record 16 times.

The Convener of Debates on the GUU Board is elected from the Union membership and heads the Union Debates Committee. The Convener is responsible for the internal and intervarsity debating activities of the GUU. The Union&#x27;s Debates Chamber spans the first and second floors of the building.

The Union historically held the biennial John Smith Memorial Debate in memory of the former Leader of the Labour Party and former member of the union and Convener of Debates. The last of these was held in 2011, when guest speakers included Shadow Scottish Secretary Ann McKechin and former Conservative Health Minister Gerry Malone, and which was chaired by then Rector of the University and former leader of the Liberal Democrats Charles Kennedy. A bust of John Smith by Eduardo Paolozzi stands at the entrance to the Debates Chamber gallery.

The Union holds a biennial Charles Kennedy Memorial Debate, the first having been held in 2015. In attendance at the inaugural memorial debate were: Alex Cole-Hamilton, subsequent Liberal Democrat MSP for Edinburgh Western; Alistair Darling, former Chancellor of the Exchequer and Labour MP for Edinburgh South West; Fiona Hyslop, SNP MSP for Linlithgow and Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs; Ian Duncan, Conservative MEP; Graham Stringer, Labour MP for Blackley and Broughton; and Alastair Campbell, former Director of Communications and Strategy at Number 10. The debate was chaired by Former President of the Union and former leader of the Liberal Democrats and MP for North East Fife Sir Menzies Campbell.

===World Debating Anniversary===
To mark the 30th anniversary of the World Universities Debating Championships, which were founded by GUU, it held a Grand Show Debate on the subject of Scottish independence. This was held in the union on 19 November 2011.

The debate featured eight of the union&#x27;s ten former world champions and was chaired by the union president, Chris Sibbald.

The debate garnered national press attention and was filmed live and broadcast internationally by STV. STV&#x27;s political editor Bernard Ponsonby covered the event.

===Inter-Varsity Debating===
The GUU has an established record of international debating success and prominence. It hosted the first World Universities Debating Championship in its current form in 1981 and again in 1990 and 2001. The Union won the Championship five times, in 1983, 1987, 1992, 1994 and 1997. In addition, the GUU has a distinguished history in the John Smith Memorial Mace, a competition between the winners of regional competitions in Ireland, England, Scotland and, latterly, Wales. It holds the record for the most overall wins with a total of sixteen.

In more recent years, the GUU has regularly reached the advanced stages of both the World and European Universities Debating Championships, in addition to winning several domestic UK competitions. The Union most recently made the World Universities Debating Championships Finals in Chennai 2014 and, with a team of Bethany Garry and Owen Mooney, won the European Universities Debating Championship for the first time in August 2017.

===Parliamentary Debating===
The Union is notable for its five annual Parliamentary Debates. This format is unique to the Union, involving an Afternoon Session and an Evening Session of five rounds each. GUU Parliamentaries are not to be confused with the British Parliamentary style of debating. Parliamentary debates currently involve five (fictitious) clubs: the Scottish Nationalist Association, Her Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Tory Club, the Whigs Club, the Independent Socialists and The World Almighty Distributist League. During Parliamentary debates, speakers are referred to by Parliamentary names, assigned to them akin to &quot;constituencies&quot;, but usually of a humorous nature.

Some members join clubs to which they are politically aligned; others join clubs for social reasons or for competitive reasons, hoping to be selected by that club&#x27;s leader to deliver speeches during desirable rounds of the debate. In each year, the clubs rotate roles, as the &quot;Government&quot;, &quot;Opposition&quot;, Strong Support, Strong Opposition, and Weak Support/Opposition. The Government presents a Bill containing a preamble and three clauses, which is then argued over the course of about nine hours of debate, concluded by the &quot;Prime Minister&quot; who typically gives a speech of between thirty and sixty minutes to sum up the debate.

The debate is judged by the Clerks Bench, consisting of the Clerk to the House, the Deputy Clerk, and three Assistant Clerks. The current Clerk to the House is Mischa Watson, and the Deputy Head Clerk is Emma Walker. The scores are revealed during the last (and longest) debate. In addition to the Club Championship, individual prizes are awarded to the Best Speaker, Most Promising Speaker, Best Maiden Speaker. There are two additional prizes, the Frederick Richters Cup for best performing speaker for whom English is their Second Language and the John Morrison &quot;Hobbit&quot; Prize for outstanding contributions to the GUU debating community.

Each Parliamentary Debate has a theme and the order is usually as follows: The President&#x27;s Debate (dedicated to the President of the Union), The Secretary&#x27;s Debate (dedicated to the Board of Management of the GUU), The Dialectic Debate (dedicated to the Dialectic Society), The Old Hacks&#x27; debate (where graduates and former members of the House return for a dedicated additional round) and the Guests&#x27; Debate (where members of other debating institutions are invited to participate in the &quot;Guest Round&quot;).

The Club Leaders for 2024â2025 are:

* Scottish Nationalist Association â Lucy Hindmarsh
* Her Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Tory Club â Sophia Alvi
* The Whig Club â Alyssa Mills
* Independent Socialists â Angus MacDonald
* The World Almighty Distributist League â Rhea Abraham

===Dialectic Society===

The Glasgow University Dialectic Society was the original debating society for students at the University, thought to have originated from some time around the University&#x27;s foundation in 1451 but re-instituted in 1861. The Dialectic Society was one of the organisations which contributed to the establishment of the union in 1885 and continues to be involved in the debating activities of the union, whilst retaining an independent status. The GUU Convenor of Debates is an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Board of the Dialectic Society, and the third Parliamentary of the year is dedicated the &quot;Dialectic Parliamentary&quot;.

==Entertainment==
The union offers regular entertainments and competitions for members and non-members. Open Mic runs on a Friday evening from 9pm in The Well along with a number of occasional events such as comedy nights and &#x27;GUU&#x27;s Got Talent&#x27;. The Union currently runs two club nights in The Hive - HIVE Thursdays and Switch Saturday.

==Games==
The Games Convener was originally charged with ensuring that the tables in the union&#x27;s Billiard room were kept to a good standard. The Games Committee now runs free weekly events as well as the annual &#x27;Month of Games&#x27;.

Weekly events include the Beer Bar Quiz (Mondays at 8pm), Snooker Competition (Wednesdays), Darts and Pool Competitions (Fridays) and annual events comprise snooker and darts competitions, a dodgeball tournament, drinking and Iron Stomach competitions and B.A.D.G.E. (Big All Day Games Event).

==Closure of The Hive==
In the autumn of 2011, it emerged that the university was considering proposals to demolish the union&#x27;s extension building and replace it with increased sports facilities. The union&#x27;s extension building housed five of the union&#x27;s bars and its nightclub, The Hive. The reaction to these proposals was met with anger among the student population, particularly as loss of the union&#x27;s nightclub, would result in the closure of the union.

As a result, the union Board of Management campaigned and lobbied the university senior management group, which resulted in national press attention. Many of the union&#x27;s alumni reacted to the news of this decision with Duncan Hamilton saying: &quot;This is a total failure to appreciate that for many alumni the GUU was the most influential and important part of their university life.&quot;

As a result, the university abandoned its original proposals; rather, opting for a joint-venture for union and sports facilities. University of Glasgow principal Professor Anton Muscatelli issued a statement saying: &quot;The University will only commit the Sports Extension when we are also able to commit to a development of GUU social space that will sustain its activities.&quot; This was ultimately achieved, with construction of a new extension building starting in June 2014 and completed in September 2015. The Board of Management of 2015â16, along with the Union&#x27;s General Manager Anne Marie Bennett, formally opened the Hive on 17 October 2015.

==Friends of Glasgow University Union==
Friends of Glasgow University Union (FoGUU) was formed in 2011 as an independent charity to raise funds for projects at Glasgow University Union. A committee of various life members runs FoGUU and meets on a monthly basis. The committee seeks monthly donations from alumni, with patrons&#x27; names being displayed in a Patrons&#x27; Board in the union.

FoGUU runs activities for life members, including: reunion dinners, golf days and anniversary events. The charity is an extension of the committee that the union&#x27;s 125th celebrations in October 2010. This culminated in a dinner for over two hundred alumni, hosted by broadcaster, and former union board member, Andrew Neil.

==Controversy==

In March 2013, two female debaters visiting the university from Edinburgh and Cambridge for the GUU Ancients Debating Championship complained of incidents of sexist heckling and misogynistic objectification by a number of GUU members. The University&#x27;s Senate launched disciplinary proceedings against two students, holding a hearing before finding there was &quot;no case to answer&quot;. As a result of a separate inquiry launched by the University Union into sexism in its community, conducted by Professor Noreen Burrows, Sandra White MSP and Roddy Neilson, the GUU introduced a new Equality and Diversity policy, Harassment and Bullying policy and Complaints Procedure and made several changes to its Constitution. As part of its response to the culture of sexism identified in the report, the GUU also became the first debating Union in Scotland to introduce diversity quotas, directed towards the increased participation of women in competitions. As a result of these policies, the GUU fielded the team to the European Universities Debating Championships that contained the first woman to win the competition and be named Best Open Speaker.

<doc id="645985" wikidata="Q6775846" url="?curid=645985" title="Martin K. Weiche">
<text>Martin K. Weiche (January 6, 1921 â September 2, 2011) was a neo-Nazi political figure in Canada.

==Background==
Born in Lebus, Germany, January 6, 1921. Weiche was a self-confessed Nazi, but he never belonged to the Hitler Youth or the Nazi Party. As a teenager, Weiche joined the NSKK (National Socialist Motor Corps). Weiche fought for Nazi Germany as a pilot and soldier during World War II. He was later held as a prisoner of war at a Canadian-run internment camp in the Netherlands.

Weiche entered Canada on November 13, 1951, at Halifax, arriving on the steamship SS &quot;Homeland&quot;.

Coming to Canada after the war, he earned a living from the 1950s onwards by buying houses cheaply, renovating them and then selling them at a profit.

In 1957, Weiche started building apartment buildings in the cities of London and Sarnia. In London, he built a total of thirteen buildings, from a nine unit with a large penthouse suite to the complex known as &quot;Skyview&quot; with 234 units. In Sarnia, in 1965, Weiche built &quot;Huron View Towers&quot; with 74 units and a large penthouse suite, which was the largest apartment building in Sarnia at the time.

Weiche quit his building activities in 1980 and retired to his residence, known as &quot;The Berghof&quot;, in Hyde Park, Ontario. 
==Political activity==
In the 1968 federal election in Canada, Weiche ran for election to the House of Commons of Canada as a &quot;National Socialist&quot; candidate in the Ontario riding of London East. Weiche won only 89 votes, 0.3% of the total cast in the riding.

He was identified as a leading figure in the &quot;Canadian Nazi Party&quot; which was led by William John Beattie of Sarnia until 1978 and was later identified as president of the &quot;Canadian National Socialist Party&quot;, which was likely the same organization. This party was inspired by the Nazi ideology.

In 1971, he and Beattie disrupted the Social Credit Party of Canada national convention when they refused to leave. Their memberships in the party had been revoked by the party&#x27;s executive council because their presence was &quot;inimical to the interests of the party&quot;. Yelling that the party would have to &quot;bring in storm troopers&quot; to get them out, they disrupted the party&#x27;s public affairs workshop, and the whole convention. They were allowed to stay as non-voting observers.

Weiche also ran as an independent candidate endorsed by the breakaway Social Credit Association of Ontario and the Western Guard in Trinity riding in the 1974 federal election. He won 64 votes, 0.3% of the total.

Until the 1970s, candidates were free to identify their political affiliation as they saw fit. As of the 1972 election, however, candidates who were not nominated by officially registered political parties could only identify themselves as &quot;Independent&quot; or &quot;no party&quot;.

In 1980, Weiche was identified in the media as president of the Canadian National Socialist Party (an unregistered political party) when, in Sarnia, Weiche was invited to appear on radio station CHOK. The appearance was cancelled due to public complaints. Despite the cancellation, a clash broke out between followers of Weiche and members of the Conference Against Racist and Fascist Violence during a protest outside the station.

Later that year, a Ku Klux Klan cross burning and rally led by Alexander McQuirter was held on Weiche&#x27;s farm in southwestern Ontario. McQuirter described Weiche as &quot;nothing more than a friend (who) doesn&#x27;t necessarily agree with our principles.&quot;

A subsequent cross burning on his property in 1993 attended by approximately 40 people dressed in Klan regalia led the provincial government of Bob Rae to consider amending the Ontario Human Rights Code to ban the activity.

==Operation Red Dog==
In 1981, Weiche was named as one of the financial backers of Operation Red Dog, a failed white supremacist plot to overthrow the government of Dominica. Don Andrews described Weiche as &quot;a National Socialist, or Nazi [with] money and vast real estate holdings&quot; who was interested in Dominica for business reasons. Weiche admitted he had been approached by ringleader Michale Purdue to invest in the scheme but denied any involvement saying &quot;I wasn&#x27;t interested in his revolution... Perdue is a liar about everything. Perdue is an infiltrator who had to stick it to some people.&quot; However, Weiche told a reporter that he would like to see a population transfer where Blacks from the Caribbean are relocated to Canada and whites repopulate the islands and set up an ideal society on white supremacist principles. Though he denied contributing anything financially to the plot, he admitted in an interview that he was &quot;involved with the idea of Dominica since the middle of &#x27;79,&quot; wanting to create a colony for &quot;all pure whites - Aryan stock, physically as well as mentally.&quot;

==Later activities==
In the 1990s, Weiche worked with the Nationalist Party of Canada&#x27;s Don Andrews in an attempt to have municipalities recognize &quot;European Heritage Week&quot; following up from a successful 1995 attempt to have London, Ontario recognize &quot;European Heritage Day&quot;. Weiche filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission when the city rejected Weiche&#x27;s proposal.

Weiche made his fortune as a developer and, in 2000, was reported by &quot;Now Magazine&quot; to be a major financial backer of far-right leader Paul Fromm.

His property near London, Ontario, included a room designed to approximate Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Alpine retreat. The room reportedly included &quot;oil paintings and photographs of Hitler hang[ing] on walls inside, [along with] two faded swastika pennants. An autographed copy of Hitler&#x27;s Mein Kampf sits on a study bookshelf. And there are photographs of former U.S. Nazi leader George Lincoln Rockwell and the Queen,&quot; according to a 1981 &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; report.

His son, David Weiche, was a member of the Bandidos biker gang and was described as the &quot;right-hand man&quot; of Wayne Kellestine, the leading perpetrator of the Shedden massacre in which eight fellow members of the Bandidos were murdered. David Weiche moved to Winnipeg three months before the massacre. When the murders came to light, Martin Weiche told the &quot;London Free Press&quot;, &quot;If I was David... I&#x27;d go and hide, I would quickly disappear for a few weeks. The murderers are still out there.&quot;

A large backward swastika cut into a field behind Weicheâs home drew international attention to London with the launch of Google Earth.

Weiche died of kidney failure on September 2, 2011, at the age of 90.

<doc id="645986" wikidata="Q725686" url="?curid=645986" title="David Morrissey">
<text>David Mark Joseph Morrissey (born 21 June 1964) is an English actor and filmmaker. He had numerous small roles in films and television series throughout the 1990s before achieving wider recognition for playing Gordon Brown in &quot;The Deal&quot; (2003), Stephen Collins in &quot;State of Play&quot; (2003), and The Governor in the third, fourth, and fifth seasons of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; (2012â2015). He has also acted extensively on stage with companies such as the Royal Shakespeare Company and Royal National Theatre.

Morrissey has directed short films and the television dramas &quot;Sweet Revenge&quot; (2001) and &quot;Passer By&quot; (2004). His feature-length directorial debut, the television film &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry About Me&quot; (2010), premiered on BBC Two. He was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for &quot;State of Play&quot; and won a Best Actor award from the Royal Television Society for &quot;The Deal&quot;. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by Edge Hill University in 2016.

== Early life ==
David Mark Joseph Morrissey was born in the Kensington area of Liverpool on 21 June 1964, the son of Littlewoods employee Joan and cobbler Joe Morrissey. He has two older brothers named Tony and Paul, and an older sister named Karen. The family lived at 45 Seldon Street in Kensington. Decades later, as part of National Museums Liverpool&#x27;s Eight Hundred Lives project, Morrissey wrote that the house had been in his family since at least 1900; his grandmother had been married there and his mother was born there. In 1971, the family moved to a larger and more modern house on the new estates at Knotty Ash, while Seldon Street was later demolished.

Morrissey was greatly interested in film, television, and Gene Kelly musicals as a child. He decided to become an actor after seeing a broadcast of &quot;Kes&quot; on television. At St Margaret Mary&#x27;s Primary School, he was encouraged by a teacher named Miss Keller, who cast him as the Scarecrow in a school production of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; when he was 11 years old. Keller left the school soon after, leaving him without encouragement. His secondary school, De La Salle School, had no drama classes and made him think that the fear of bullying often dissuaded pupils from participating in lessons. On the advice of a cousin, he joined the Everyman Youth Theatre. For the first couple of weeks, he was quite shy and did not join in with the workshops. When he eventually participated, he ended up appearing in their production of &quot;Fighting Chance&quot;, a play about the 1981 riots in Liverpool.

By the age of 14, Morrissey was one of two youth theatre members who sat on the board of the Everyman Theatre. His contemporaries included Cathy Tyson, brothers Mark and Stephen McGann, and Ian Hart, the last being his friend since they were both five years old. He became friends with the McGann brothers and they introduced him to their brother Paul, who was on a break from his studies at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). When he was 15 years old, his father developed a terminal blood disorder, and was ill for some time before dying of a haemorrhage at the age of 54 in the family home. After leaving school at the age of 16, Morrissey moved to Wolverhampton to join a theatre company there, where he worked on sets and costumes.

== Career ==
=== Acting ===
====1980s====
In 1982, Morrissey auditioned for &quot;One Summer&quot;, a television series by Willy Russell for Yorkshire Television and Channel 4 about two Liverpool boys who run away to Wales one summer. Russell had been attached to the Everyman for many years, and Morrissey had seen him while he was working behind the bar downstairs from the theatre, though the two had never been introduced. Morrissey went to at least eight auditions, and in one read for the part of Icky opposite Paul McGann, who was reading for Billy. McGann, five years older than Morrissey, believed that he was too old to be playing the part of 16-year-old Billy and stepped back from the production, leaving the role to go to Morrissey. Spencer Leigh got the part of Icky and Ian Hart played the supporting role of Rabbit. Russell had a professional disagreement with the director Gordon Flemyng and producer Keith Richardson over the casting of 18-year-old Morrissey and Leigh; he believed that the sympathy of 16-year-olds running away was lost by casting older actors. Russell subsequently had his name removed from the credits of the original broadcast. After filming &quot;One Summer&quot; for five months, Morrissey went travelling in Kenya with his cousins. When he returned to Britain, &quot;One Summer&quot; was being broadcast, and he dealt with the new experience of being recognised in public.

Morrissey had planned to study at RADA in London, but his colleagues at the Everyman encouraged him not to as he already had his Equity card. His &quot;One Summer&quot; co-star James Hazeldine convinced him otherwise, and he went to London for a year. He became homesick while there and did not enjoy the way RADA was turning him into a &quot;bland actor&quot;. On a visit back to Liverpool he told Paul McGann&#x27;s mother that he was considering leaving the college. Back in London, McGann met with him and reassured him that he had been through the same homesickness phase when he first went to RADA. Morrissey continued his studies at RADA and graduated on 1 December 1985.

After a year at RADA, Morrissey went back to Liverpool to perform in &quot;WCPC&quot; at the Liverpool Playhouse. He then did &quot;Le Cid&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; with Cheek by Jowl, and spent two years with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), principally with director Deborah Warner for whom he played the Bastard in &quot;King John&quot; in 1988. He saw the role as a learning opportunity, as he had often wondered at RADA if he would ever have the chance to act in classical theatre. His performance has been described as &quot;the most contentious characterisation of the production&quot;; he received negative critical reaction from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;Independent&quot; critics, but a positive opinion from the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Nicholas de Jongh wrote, &quot;The Bastard, who has the most complex syntax in early Shakespeare, half defeats David Morrissey. His slurred, sometimes unintelligible diction helps to deflate the Bastard, but his bawling rhetoric strikes as mere sham rather than fierce plain speaking.&quot; Morrissey also spent time with the National, where he played the title role in &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; (1990). Michael Billington praised the unkempt energy of his performance. During this time, he lived on the housing estate in White City, where he and his flatmates were the frequent victims of burglars.

Morrissey&#x27;s second television role came in 1987 when he played the 18-year-old chauffeur George Bowman, whose obsession with his employer and lover Alma Rattenbury (Helen Mirren) leads him to murder her husband, in an Anglia Television adaptation of Terence Rattigan&#x27;s play &quot;Cause CÃ©lÃ¨bre&quot;. At the end of the 1980s, Morrissey met director John Madden for the first time. Madden was looking for an actor who could portray an ordinary man who turns out to be a mass murderer, in his film &quot;The Widowmaker&quot; (1990). He knew Morrissey was right for the part in his first audition. The next year, Morrissey appeared as Theseus in an episode of &quot;The Storyteller&quot; directed by Madden (&quot;Theseus and the Minotaur&quot;, 1991), and as Little John in &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1991). &quot;Robin Hood&quot;â³s cinema release clashed with that of &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; (1991). The latter, starring Kevin Costner in the title role, was a box office hit and left Morrissey&#x27;s version forgotten. Morrissey was out of work in film and television for eight months after it was released. Eventually, he was cast in a leading role as a CID officer in the BBC television drama &quot;Clubland&quot; (1991). He almost lost the role a week into rehearsals when his appendix ruptured. In order to keep the part, and a flat in Crouch End he had just bought, Morrissey performed while he stilll had his stitches in.

====1990s====
His role in &quot;The Widowmaker&quot; led to him being offered and taking many obsessive character roles; he played police officers in &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, &quot;Framed&quot;, &quot;Between the Lines&quot; and &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, and soldier Andy McNab in &quot;The One That Got Away&quot; (1996). Morrissey first met screenwriter Peter Bowker when he played Detective Sergeant Jim Llewyn in the second series of Bowker&#x27;s &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;. In 1994, he played customs officer Gerry Birch in the first series of &quot;The Knock&quot;, and Stephen Finney in the six-part ITV series &quot;Finney&quot;. In &quot;Finney&quot;, Morrissey assumed the role originated by Sting in &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; (Mike Figgis, 1988). He was the first choice for the part and had to learn to play the double bass.

Morrissey made his first appearance in a Tony Marchant drama playing Michael Ride in &quot;Into the Fire&quot; (1996), and the following year played the lead role of Shaun Southerns in Marchant&#x27;s BBC series &quot;Holding On&quot; (1997). Southerns, a crooked tax inspector, was the first of many &quot;men in turmoil&quot; roles for Morrissey, and it earned him a nomination for the Royal Television Society (RTS) Programme Award for Best Male Actor the next year. In 1998, he appeared in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; alongside Paul McGann. As he was a fan of the book, Morrissey asked director Julian Farino if he could play Eugene Wrayburn, but the role went to McGann. Farino had Morrissey in mind to play schoolmaster Bradley Headstone, a part Morrissey was reluctant to take until he read the script. He studied the role and decided to take it on the basis that the character was unloved and that his motivation by social class causes his mental health problems. His performance was described by a writer for &quot;The Guardian&quot; as bringing &quot;unprecedented depth to a character [...] who is more commonly portrayed as just another horrible Dickens git.&quot; In the same year, he played Christopher &quot;Kiffer&quot; Finzi in Anand Tucker&#x27;s &quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot;. His roles in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; and &quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot; were described as his breakthrough roles by Zoe Williams of &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

In 1999, Morrissey returned to the theatre for the first and last time in nine years to play Pip and Theo in &quot;Three Days of Rain&quot; (Robin Lefevre, Donmar Warehouse). He continued to take in offers for stage roles, but turned them down because he did not want to be away from his family for long periods. Writing in &quot;Time Out&quot;, Jane Edwardes suggested that his role as Kiffer in &quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot; had inspired his casting as Pip in &quot;Three Days of Rain&quot; as the characters have similarities with each other. Morrissey was attracted to the role because the play began with a long speech and the cast and crew had only two weeks&#x27; rehearsal time. Next, he starred in &quot;Some Voices&quot; (2000), playing Pete. Morrissey researched the character of Pete, a chef, by shadowing the head chef at the Terrace Restaurant in Kensington, London and chopping vegetables in the kitchen for two hours a day. An &quot;Independent&quot; critic called him &quot;an instinctive actor who can use his whole body to convey an inner turbulence&quot;. For his next film role as Nazi Captain Weber in &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot; (2001), Morrissey researched the Hitler Youth and read Gitta Sereny&#x27;s biography of Albert Speer, &quot;Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth&quot;. As with all of his roles, Morrissey created an extensive back story for Weber to build up the character.

====2000s====

Morrissey returned to television in 2002 playing Franny Rothwell, a factory canteen worker who wants to adopt his dead sister&#x27;s son, in an episode of Paul Abbott&#x27;s &quot;Clocking Off&quot;. His performance was described as characteristically powerful in &quot;The Independent&quot;. He also played tabloid journalist Dave Dewston in the four-part BBC serial &quot;Murder&quot;, and prison officer Mike in the part-improvised single drama &quot;Out of Control&quot;. He researched the latter part by shadowing prison officers in a young offenders&#x27; institution for a week. At the beginning of 2003, he played the role of Richie MacGregor in &quot;This Little Life&quot;, a television drama about a mother who has to cope with her 16-week-premature baby. Morrissey researched premature births by speaking to paediatricians at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead.

Morrissey&#x27;s next major leading role was as Member of Parliament (MP) Stephen Collins in Paul Abbott&#x27;s BBC serial &quot;State of Play&quot; (2003). Morrissey received the scripts for the first three episodes and was keen to read the last three. They had not been completed when he originally requested them but Abbott told him how Collins&#x27; story concludes. Unsure how to approach the role, Morrissey was advised by his friend, director Paul Greengrass, to get Collins&#x27; job as politician right. Morrissey contacted &quot;State of Play&quot; producer Hilary Bevan Jones, who set up meetings between Morrissey and select committee members Kevin Barron and Fabian Hamilton. Both politicians educated Morrissey on how difficult it is to commute to London from a constituency outside the capital. Morrissey was also able to shadow Peter Mandelson around the House of Commons for a fortnight. He questioned Mandelson about his job as a cabinet minister but did not ask about his personal life. Mandelson told him about how politics can quickly &quot;seduce&quot; MPs who have worked hard to get into Parliament.

That same year, he played Gordon Brown in Peter Morgan&#x27;s single drama &quot;The Deal&quot; (2003), about a pact made between Brown and Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) in 1994. Unlike his research for the fictional &quot;State of Play&quot;, Morrissey discovered that no politicians wanted to talk to him for this fact-based drama, so he turned to journalists Jon Snow and Simon Hoggart. He also travelled to Brown&#x27;s hometown of Kirkcaldy and immersed himself in numerous biographies of the man, including Ross Wilson&#x27;s documentary films on New Labour in the year surrounding the 1997 election. When speaking to many of Brown&#x27;s friends to gain insight into his &quot;private persona&quot;, Morrissey discovered that Brown was funny, approachable and charming, which were characteristics he did not see in his &quot;public persona&quot;. To look like Brown, Morrissey had his hair dyed and permed, and put on 2 stone (28Â lb/13Â kg) in body weight in six weeks. The director Stephen Frears originally wanted to cast a Scottish actor as Brown but was persuaded by other production staff to cast Morrissey.

His acting in &quot;State of Play&quot; and &quot;The Deal&quot; won him considerable acclaim; he was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for his role as Collins but lost to his co-star Bill Nighy. His performance in &quot;The Deal&quot; was acclaimed by Charlie Whelan, Gordon Brown&#x27;s former spin doctor, and Tim Allan, a deputy press secretary of Tony Blair. A BBC News Online writer praised Morrissey&#x27;s grasp of Brown&#x27;s physical tics in a review that criticised the rest of the film. Morrissey&#x27;s performance won the RTS Programme Award for Best Male Actor the next year, this time beating Nighy. The RTS jury wrote of Morrissey, &quot;The strength of this performance brought to the screen, and to life, all of the characteristics and traits of the man he portrayed in a way that was both credible and convincing.&quot; In 2009, Morrissey declined the opportunity to play Brown again in &quot;The Special Relationship&quot;, Morgan&#x27;s third Blair film, as he did not want to get into the mindset of playing Brown for just one scene.
Morrissey was eager to play a comic role after starring in these dramas. He subsequently reunited with Peter Bowker for the BBC One musical serial &quot;Blackpool&quot;, in which he plays Blackpool arcade owner Ripley Holden. Bowker remembered Morrissey from &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; and wanted to build on the actor&#x27;s sense of humour and to cast him against type. Before filming began, Morrissey spent four days in Blackpool talking to the locals and finding out how the arcades worked. His performance was described in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as &quot;a powerful mixture of barely suppressed danger and vulnerable, boyish charm.&quot; A public poll on bbc.co.uk ranked him the second best actor of 2004. Morrissey reprised the role in 2006 in the one-off sequel &quot;Viva Blackpool!&quot;. He was pleased to revive Ripley after filming dramatic roles since the original serial.

The following years saw Morrissey cast in two high-profile feature films; while filming the Brian Jones biopic &quot;Stoned&quot; (2005), he got an audition for psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass, the male lead in &quot;Basic Instinct 2&quot; (2006). He was flown out to Los Angeles for a one-hour screen test with Sharon Stone. Their immediate rapport led to the screen test being extended by another hour and Morrissey&#x27;s casting in the role. Morrissey had enjoyed the first film and liked the script for the sequel. He read up on psychiatry and worked out in a gym for the nudity scenes. The film was a box office and critical failure. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; criticised the film&#x27;s focus on Morrissey&#x27;s character and called the actor &quot;overmatched by Stone&quot; and &quot;a sad sack&quot;, and the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; called him &quot;a charisma-challenged non-entity&quot;. The same &quot;Washington Post&quot; critic later wrote in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that because Morrissey was not a film star, the chemistry between him and Stone had been spoiled. Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that Morrissey had &quot;the charisma of beige wallpaper&quot; and that &quot;the producers could have replaced him halfway through shooting with a handsome mahogany coat rack and nobody would be able to tell the difference&quot;. The bad reviews depressed Morrissey, and he briefly considered giving up acting, but instead saw the role as a chance to learn.

Immediately after filming &quot;Basic Instinct 2&quot;, he began work on &quot;The Reaping&quot; (2007) in Louisiana, in which he played science teacher Doug Blackwell opposite Hilary Swank. The role had been offered to him quite late in pre-production, and he flew to Baton Rouge the Monday after &quot;Basic Instinct 2&quot; wrapped. He took the role because he was a fan of Swank, and Hopkins&#x27; film &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot; (2004), and he preferred the thriller aspect of the &quot;Reaping&quot; script above the horror aspect. After a week of filming, production had to be suspended when Hurricane Katrina hit the state. He found the filming schedule quite demanding, particularly the three weeks of night filming and a scene in which his character is attacked by a plague of locusts, most of which were computer-generated in post-production but some were real on camera. &quot;The Reaping&quot; was released in 2007 and performed badly in cinemas. Despite the failures of both films, Morrissey was grateful that they opened him up to more film offers from Hollywood.

In March 2006, Morrissey filmed a role in &quot;The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep&quot; (2007) in New Zealand. While there, he was offered the role of father Danny Brogan in &quot;Cape Wrath&quot;, an Ecosse Films series about a family being moved on a witness protection scheme to a mysterious village. He signed on to the seven-part series in September 2006 and filmed the series until the end of the year. He relished working on the character&#x27;s back story as it confounded the expectations of both him and the audience. The series was broadcast in Britain and America in 2007. The following year, he played the part of Colonel Brandon in Andrew Davies&#x27; serial &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;. When he first got the script in 2007, he was unsure if British television needed another Jane Austen adaptation, but he took the role when he saw how Davies had given more screen time to the male characters than they get in the 1995 film adaptation. He also appeared as Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk in &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; (2008). He compared Norfolk to bassist Lemmy from MotÃ¶rhead and researched the role by reading history books and literature from the 16th century.

From November 2008 to January 2009, Morrissey returned to the theatre for the first time in nine years to appear in the Almeida Theatre&#x27;s British premiere of Neil LaBute&#x27;s &quot;In a Dark Dark House&quot;. He played Terry, one of two brothers who had been abused as a child, opposite Steven Mackintosh and Kira Sternbach. He took the role because he liked LaBute&#x27;s previous play, &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot; (2002). After accepting the part, he researched the character by reading case studies of adults who were abused when they were children. He learned about how they coped with the shame of their abuse, and incorporated those feelings into his acting. He was also able to consult LaBute during rehearsals but avoided asking him exactly how to play Terry. In &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; review that criticised the play, Charles Spencer wrote that Morrissey&#x27;s was the best performance &quot;as the blue-collar older brother who reveals extraordinary depths of grief, damage and forgiveness that finally light up this dark, flawed play.&quot; Benedict Nightingale of &quot;The Times&quot; initially believed that Morrissey&#x27;s acting was &quot;a bit stiff, almost as if he was waiting for his cues rather than reacting instantaneously to their content&quot; but found him more impressive as the play went on.

In December 2008, he appeared alongside his &quot;Blackpool&quot; co-star David Tennant in &quot;The Next Doctor&quot;, the 2008 Christmas special of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, playing Jackson Lake, a man who believes he is the Doctor after his mind is affected by alien technology. Morrissey had been asked to appear in the series before but had to turn down the offers due to other commitments. He approached the character like any other dramatic part, and was influenced in his performance by previous Doctor actors William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton and Tom Baker. Secrecy surrounded the exact details of Morrissey&#x27;s role in the episode; until the day of broadcast his character was referred to only as &quot;the other Doctor&quot;. This prompted media speculation that Morrissey would be taking over the lead role after Tennant quit, and in October 2008 he was reported as a favourite of bookmakers. He was pleased that the episode was a &quot;decoy&quot; for the truth that actor Matt Smith had actually been chosen for the part of the Eleventh Doctor. In September 2009, he told entertainment website Digital Spy that he would gladly return to the show if asked.

In March 2009, Morrissey appeared as corrupt police detective Maurice Jobson in &quot;Red Riding&quot;, the Channel 4 adaptation of David Peace&#x27;s &quot;Red Riding&quot; novels. Morrissey already knew the directors of the films, enjoyed reading the script and had either worked with his co-stars on other projects, or wanted to work with them. He liked the flaws in the Jobson character and that he differs from typical vigilante police officers portrayed on television. Morrissey said of Jobson, &quot;I think he sets out to be a good cop, he tries to do his job well but he gets involved in some corruption and realises that being a &#x27;bit&#x27; corrupt is like being a &#x27;bit&#x27; pregnant. You either are or you&#x27;re not.&quot; He received a Best Actor nomination from the Broadcasting Press Guild for the role. At the end of the year, Morrissey played Bobby Dykins in the John Lennon biopic &quot;Nowhere Boy&quot; (2009). As a self-confessed &quot;Beatles geek&quot;, Morrissey relished the opportunity to star in the film about Lennon&#x27;s childhood.

He was described by the British Film Institute as one of the most versatile English actors of his generation.
====2010s====
Morrissey was active on screen throughout 2010. He starred as Theunis Swanepoel, the interrogator of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, in the BBC single drama &quot;Mrs Mandela&quot;. His performance was praised by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Independent&quot; critics. The following months saw him star as British Transport Police officer Mal Craig in the second series of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Five Days&quot;, Roman soldier Bothos in Neil Marshall&#x27;s feature &quot;Centurion&quot;, stalking victim Jan Falkowski in &quot;U Be Dead&quot;, and Colonel John Arbuthnot in the &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; adaptation of &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;. 

Morrissey returned to a weekly television role at the end of 2010 playing police detective Tom Thorne in &quot;Thorne&quot;, a six-part television series for Sky1 that was adapted from Mark Billingham&#x27;s novels &quot;Sleepyhead&quot; and &quot;Scaredy Cat&quot;. After reading &quot;Lifeless&quot; during his time filming &quot;The Water Horse&quot; in New Zealand, Morrissey searched the Internet for more information. He found an interview in which Billingham stated his preference for Morrissey to play Thorne should a screen adaptation ever be made. When he returned to the UK, Morrissey arranged a meeting with Billingham and the two began developing the TV series. Morrissey shadowed officers in the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s murder unit during their duties to learn about their jobs. He discovered that the officers felt undervalued in their jobs, and he incorporated these feelings into the series. Sky first broadcast the series on 10 October. Morrissey received approval for the role; Andrea Mullaney wrote in &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, &quot;Morrissey is never less than watchable and he brings a brooding presence to the role of Thorne.&quot; and Adam Sweeting for The Arts Desk called him &quot;authentic as the phlegmatic, low-key Thorne.&quot;

In 2011, Morrissey starred as Robert Carne in &quot;South Riding&quot;, and played Dunlop in the Lionsgate crime drama feature &quot;Blitz&quot;. In May 2011, he returned to the Everyman Theatre to play the eponymous king in &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Morrissey talked about the role to criminologists, to draw parallels with real-life serial killers, and focused on Macbeth&#x27;s status as a war hero and his childless relationship with Lady Macbeth. Morrissey&#x27;s performance was commended by Laura Davis in the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot;, who highlighted his delivery of his lines and portrayal of Macbeth &quot;[shifting] from straight-spined statesman to a fervent slayer&quot;. Clare Brenan of &quot;The Observer&quot; offered similar praise but noted that Morrissey&#x27;s vocal inflections were sometimes &quot;flat and rushed&quot;. Continuing his roles in Shakespeare productions, Morrissey played Northumberland in a BBC Two production of &quot;Richard II&quot;, broadcast in July 2012.

Morrissey joined the cast of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; for its third season in 2012. He portrayed The Governor, a major villain from the graphic novel upon which the series is based. Morrissey read the prequel novel &quot;Rise of the Governor&quot; to gain insight into the character and his motivations. He also worked with an accent coach and listened to politicians with Southern accents, including Bill Clinton. He returned for the fourth season in 2013, and made a cameo appearance in 2015. In 2014, Morrissey returned to British television in the David Nicholls drama &quot;The 7.39&quot; and the three-part serial &quot;The Driver&quot;, written by Danny Brocklehurst.

Morrissey was made an Honorary Doctor of Arts (HonDA) by Edge Hill University in 2016. From 10 September to 10 October, he starred in &quot;Hangmen&quot; by Martin McDonagh, at the Royal Court Theatre. The play followed Harry Wade, a former hangman, after the abolition of hanging in Great Britain in 1965. In 2017, Morrissey joined the cast of The League of Gentlemen for their 2017 revival.

From January 2018, Morrissey appeared as Mark Anthony in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; at the new Bridge Theatre. That year, he also starred as Inspector Tyador BorlÃº in the BBC2 drama &quot;The City and the City&quot;, adapted from China MiÃ©ville&#x27;s novel of the same name by screenwriter Tony Grisoni.

====2020s====
In 2022, he played the main antagonist Gorka in the Italian horror-fantasy film &quot;Dampyr&quot;. He also starred in the 2024 sci-fi film &quot;Slingshot&quot;.

=== Filmmaking ===

In the early 1980s, Morrissey developed a filmmaking craft at the Rathbone Theatre Workshop, a Youth Opportunities Programme that taught school-leavers skills for a year. With the workshop, Morrissey shot short silent films on Super 8, where he was taught by Bert Byron, who introduced him to US Independent and foreign films for the first time. Although the scheme paid Â£23.50 a week and took young people off unemployment benefits, Morrissey reflected in 2009 that many of the participants were just used as lackeys. After his acting career escalated, he started directing because he was aware that, as an actor, he was coming into a project quite late into development and then leaving before post-production, and he wanted to see a film through to the end. Morrissey has said that he prefers to keep acting and directing separate, and would not direct anything he is acting in.

His first major project was &quot;Something for the Weekend&quot; (1996), which he wrote and produced. Initially called &quot;The Barber Shop&quot;, the title was changed to avoid a clash with another film. His directorial debut, the short &quot;A Secret Audience&quot;, centres on a meeting between Napoleon Bonaparte and Pope Pius VII. His second short, &quot;Bring Me Your Love&quot;, was based on the short story by Charles Bukowski, and stars Ian Hart as a journalist bringing flowers to his wife in a mental hospital. It was screened in front of &quot;Some Voices&quot;. An &quot;Independent&quot; critic wrote that &quot;Bring Me Your Love&quot; &quot;holds out great promise&quot; for Morrissey and &quot;The Observer&quot; reviewer wrote that it was worth seeing but was not as impressive as &quot;A Secret Audience&quot;. &quot;Bring Me Your Love&quot; was produced by Tubedale Films, a studio Morrissey formed with his brother Paul and wife Esther Freud. In 2001, Morrissey directed &quot;Sweet Revenge&quot;, a two-part BBC television film starring Paul McGann that got him a BAFTA nomination for Best New Director (Fiction). In 2004, Morrissey reunited with Tony Marchant to direct the two-part television film &quot;Passer By&quot;, about a man (James Nesbitt) who witnesses an attack on a woman (Emily Bruni) but does nothing to stop it. Morrissey was brought onto the project after reading the first draft of Marchant&#x27;s script. The script went through five more drafts before being filmed over 30 days. Morrissey developed his directing techniques by watching the directors on films and television series that he acted in; he took the minor role of Tom Keylock in &quot;Stoned&quot; so that he could watch Stephen Woolley at work.

On 20 July 2007, Morrissey was given an Honorary Fellowship from Liverpool John Moores University for contributions to performing arts. In the same year, he made his feature debut directing &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry About Me&quot;, a film about a London boy falling in love with a Liverpool girl. The film was shot on a budget of Â£100,000 on location in Liverpool in September and October 2007 and had its world premiere at the 2009 London Film Festival. Joseph Galliano wrote in &quot;The Times&quot; that &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry About Me&quot; is &quot;a very understated film and feels more like European Art Cinema.&quot; The film was broadcast on BBC Two on 7 March 2010 and released on DVD the next day.

In 2009, Morrissey and Mark Billingham launched the production company Sleepyhead, which produced the &quot;Thorne&quot; television series. The company was a part of Stagereel, a production house previously set up by Morrissey&#x27;s brother Paul. The company bought the rights to adapt the &quot;Thorne&quot; novels and Morrissey was already developing it to pitch to television channels when Sky made an offer to broadcast it. As of 2010, Morrissey and Tubedale Films were developing two feature films with financing from the UK Film Council. Morrissey criticised the CameronâClegg coalition government&#x27;s decision to close the UK Film Council, as he believed it was an asset to first-time filmmakers. The organisation&#x27;s funding role was taken over by the British Film Institute in 2011.

==Charity work==
In 2009, Morrissey and a team of filmmakers ran a series of drama workshops for Palestinian refugee children in Beirut, in conjunction with the UNRWA. On his return to England, he set up the Creative Arts School Trust (CAST), a charity for the purpose of training teachers and continuing the workshops in Lebanon and elsewhere.

Morrissey is a patron of The SMA Trust (a charity that funds research into spinal muscular atrophy), Liverpool&#x27;s Unity Theatre, and the human rights organisation Reprieve.

== Personal life ==
Morrissey was introduced to novelist Esther Freud by actor Danny Webb, and the two dated for around 13 years before marrying in a ceremony on Southwold Pier on 12 August 2006. They had a daughter and two sons together before separating in 2020. They had split their time between homes in North London and Walberswick.

Morrissey is a lifelong supporter of his hometown football team Liverpool FC and the Labour Party. In 2014, he was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to an open letter in &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in that year&#x27;s referendum on the issue.

<text>The Flying P-Liners were the sailing ships of the German shipping company [[F. Laeisz]] of Hamburg.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1824 by Ferdinand Laeisz as a hat manufacturing company. He was quite successful and distributed his hats even in South America. In 1839, he had the three-masted wooden brig &quot;Carl&quot; (named after his son) built and entered the shipping business, but lack of success made him sell the ship a short five years later.

Ferdinand&#x27;s son Carl Laeisz entered the business in 1852. It was he who turned the F.Â Laeisz company into a shipping business. In 1857, they ordered a barque which they named &quot;Pudel&quot; (which was the nickname of Carl&#x27;s wife Sophie), and from the mid-1880s on, all their ships had names starting with &quot;P&quot; and they became known as &quot;the P-line&quot;. The last ship without a &quot;P-name&quot; was the wooden barque &quot;Henriette Behn&quot; which was stranded on the Mexican coast in 1885.
The Laeisz company specialized in the South American nitrate trade. Their ships were built for speed, and they soon acquired an excellent reputation for timeliness and reliability, which gave rise to the nickname &quot;the Flying P-Line&quot;. The five-masted barque made the voyage from Chile to England around Cape Horn in 1904 in just 57 days, a record at the time.

The Laeisz company had some of the largest sailing ships ever built. They experimented with steel-hulled five-masters, first the barque &quot;Potosi&quot; (1895) and in 1902 the huge full-rigged ship with a length of , , and over . She could sail faster than and her best 24-hour distance was 392 sm in 1908 on her voyage to Yokohama. However, these ships turned out to be too big: their crews did not like them, and it became increasingly difficult to achieve a satisfactory utilization on the outbound leg from Europe to Chile. The later ships, such as or , returned to being smaller four-masted barques.

During World War I, many of Laeisz&#x27; ships were blocked in Chilean ports and had to be handed over as war reparations. However, the Laeisz company was able to re-acquire many ships after the war and put them into service again.

Towards the end of the 1920s, the company began pulling out of the nitrate trade and increasingly started transporting other goods, e.g. bananas. They also sold some of their older ships, for instance to Gustav Erikson in Finland who already had acquired the former Norddeutscher Lloyd-ship . The last sailing ship ordered by the Laeisz company was in 1926. Subsequently, the Laeisz company only ordered steamships.

== Ships ==
Four of the Flying P-Liners still exist today:
* is a museum ship in Mariehamn, Finland.
* &quot;Peking&quot; is a museum ship in Hamburg, Germany.
* &quot;Passat&quot; is a museum ship in LÃ¼beck&#x27;s sea resort TravemÃ¼nde, Germany.
* &quot;Padua&quot; is the only ship still active: she is today a school ship and sails as under a Russian flag.

Other famous Flying P-Liners were a five-masted barque and a five-masted full-rigged ship (both built by Joh. C. Tecklenborg ship yard in GeestemÃ¼nde)
* &quot;Potosi&quot;, (barque) built 1895, sold 1923, caught fire and sunk off Argentina in 1925
* &quot;Preussen II&quot;, (full-rigged ship) built 1902, beached in 1910 after being rammed by a steamer
and the four-masted barques 
* , built 1905, capsized and sunk in 1957, 80 died, 6 rescued.
* , built 1892, stranded 1912 South Shetlands
* , built 1892, stranded in Norfolk 1905
* , built 1903 in Italy, scrapped 1936
* , built 1917, giving to the Chilean navy, in 1943 as it was in Valparaiso when the Chilean government declared war on Germany, later became the Chilean Navy schoolship Lautaro, which was caught by fire in his way to Mexico and sunk off the coast of Peru in 1945.
* , built 1902, after an accident in 1936 was scrapped in 1938

Other P-Line ships were:
* &quot;Pudel&quot;, built 1857, sunk 1870
* &quot;Palmyra&quot;, steel full-rigged ship built in 1889 by Blohm &amp; Voss, Hamburg. Stranded on the Wellington Islands on the South Chilean coast 2 July 1908. The captain and the first mate were able to reach shore but the rest of the crew of 21 men disappeared in one of the lifeboats.
* &quot;Pera&quot;, built 1890, torpedoed 1917
* &quot;Pitlochry&quot;, built 1894, sunk 1913 in the English Channel
* &quot;Preussen I&quot;, built 1902, sunk in South Atlantic 1909
* &quot;Pellworm&quot;, built 1902, sunk 1944
* &quot;Pangani&quot;, built 1903, sunk 1913
* &quot;Penang&quot;, built 1905, torpedoed 1940

The Laeisz shipping company still exists today, operating many freighters under traditional names.

<text>Forest &amp; Bird (), also known by its formal name as the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand, is an environmental organisation specialising in the protection and conservation of New Zealand&#x27;s indigenous flora and fauna and unique wild places and natural ecosystems.
Forest &amp; Bird consists of 47 branches located in urban and rural centres throughout New Zealand. Branches are actively engaged in conservation projects and advocacy on a community, regional and national basis. Forest &amp; Bird has offices and staff located in Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington, Nelson and Dunedin. Forest &amp; Bird publishes a quarterly magazine &quot;Forest &amp; Bird&quot;, one of New Zealand&#x27;s definitive natural history and conservation publications.

Forest &amp; Bird has published a comprehensive commentary book on environmental law in New Zealand. Forest &amp; Bird are also actively engaged in advocating and lobbying for resource management law and practices to more consistently protect ecosystems.

== History ==
Forest &amp; Bird was founded as the Native Bird Protection Society in 1923. Later renamed as the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand, it has consistently advocated conservation issues, particularly for forested land.

Val Sanderson is acknowledged as the founder of Forest &amp; Bird. In 1921, after his return from the First World War, the then Captain Val Sanderson was angered that the Kapiti Island wildlife reserve was unfenced and extensively damaged by cattle, sheep and goats. Sanderson campaigned for better management of Kapiti Island and succeeded in having it re-dedicated as a Wildlife Reserve. After this success, Sanderson held a public meeting in March 1923 which established the Native Bird Protection Society with Sir Thomas Mackenzie as the Society&#x27;s first President. The New Zealand Forestry League, a forest conservation group already existed but it gradually died out. In 1935 Mackenzie and Sanderson renamed the society the Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand. Sanderson drove an expansion of the society&#x27;s range of interests into such areas as soil erosion and use of native trees for soil stabilisation. He became the president in 1933 a position which he held until his death in 1945 aged 79.

Until the 1970s, the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society remained the only New Zealand environmental group. However, in October 1971 the New Zealand Government proposed to harvest large areas of native South Island lowland beech forest with half the cleared area to be converted to exotic &quot;Pinus radiata&quot;. Along with the Save Manapouri campaign, the native forest harvesting prompted more public awareness of conservation and the formation of new environmental groups such as the Beech Forest Action Committee. In response to the native forest harvesting, on 4 July 1975 Forest &amp; Bird and Beech Forest Action Committee started the Maruia Declaration as a public petition demanding an end to native forest logging and legal recognition of native forests. The Maruia Declaration was submitted to the New Zealand Government in 1977.

From 2005 the society has held an annual poll Bird of the Year, voted on by the public. Winners to date include the kÄkÄpÅ, the tÅ«Ä« and the New Zealand long-tailed bat.

In 2021, all proceeds from Lorde&#x27;s Te Ao MÄrama EP went to Forest &amp; Bird as well as the Te Hua Kawariki Charitable Trust.

In April 2022, Nicola Toki took over from Kevin Hague as Chief Executive of Forest &amp; Bird.

=== Centenary ===
The first 100 years of the society is detailed in &quot;Force of nature: te aumangea o te ao tÅ«roa : a conservation history of Forest &amp; Bird 1923-2023.&quot;

== Attitudes ==

Perceptions of Forest &amp; Bird are varied. While the group is one of the most well-known mainstream environmental groups of the country, it has also come under criticism, such as in 2010 when Prime Minister John Key accused them of engaging in &quot;predictable scaremongering&quot; when the group warned that a yet unreleased government report proposed to allow mining in 7000ha of high-value conservation land in Paparoa National Park, Great Barrier Island and the Coromandel Peninsula. Key also labelled news coverage quoting Forest &amp; Bird&#x27;s revelations of the Government&#x27;s intentions for mining conservation land as &quot;hysterical&quot;.

A week later, as predicted by Forest &amp; Bird, the Government released the &quot;Schedule 4 stocktake&quot; proposal to open up 7058 hectares of protected conservation land for mining. Parts of the Coromandel Peninsula, Great Barrier Island, and parts of Paparoa National Park were proposed for removal from Schedule Four of the Crown Minerals Act 1991, which otherwise prevents mining. Journalist John Armstrong commented that &quot;Forest and Bird knocked the Government sideways with leaked information revealing the extent of National&#x27;s plans to open up land currently off limits to mining companies&quot; and that the Government was suffering from hysteria if any one was.

After 40,000 people marched in Auckland in protest against the proposal, and after the vast majority of 37,552 public submissions opposed the proposal, the Government announced that no conservation land would be removed from Schedule 4 to allow mining.

<text>Marshall Howard Crenshaw (born November 11, 1953) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and guitarist best known for hit songs such as &quot;Someday, Someway&quot;, a US top 40 hit in 1982, &quot;Cynical Girl&quot;, and &quot;Whenever You&#x27;re on My Mind&quot;. He is also the co-author of one of the biggest radio hits of the 1990s, Gin Blossoms&#x27;s &quot;Til I Hear It from You&quot;. His music has roots in classic soul music and Buddy Holly, to whom Crenshaw was often compared in the early days of his career, and whom he portrayed in the 1987 film &quot;La Bamba&quot;.

Born in Michigan, Crenshaw performed in the musical &quot;Beatlemania&quot; before releasing his self-titled album in 1982. Crenshaw could not replicate the commercial success of &quot;Marshall Crenshaw&quot; and follow-up &quot;Field Day&quot; (1983) with later albums. Crenshaw has also contributed songs to other artists, writing singles for Kirsty MacColl and Gin Blossoms. A quote from &quot;Trouser Press&quot; summed up Marshall Crenshaw&#x27;s early career: &quot;Although he was seen as a latter-day Buddy Holly at the outset, he soon proved too talented and original to be anyone but himself.&quot;

==Early life==
Born in Detroit, Michigan, he grew up in the northern suburb of Berkley. His brother, Robert, would join Crenshaw&#x27;s touring band during the 1980s. He graduated from Berkley High School in June 1971.

He began playing guitar at age ten. During and after high school he led the band Astigfa (an acronym for &quot;a splendid time is guaranteed for all&quot;, a lyric from The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite&quot;). He got his first break in 1978, playing John Lennon in the musical &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, first as an understudy in New York, then in the West Coast company, then in a national touring company. He left the show in February 1980.

==Career==
===1970sâ1985===
After launching a trio in New York with brother Robert on drums and Chris Donato on bass, Crenshaw recorded his debut single, &quot;Something&#x27;s Gonna Happen,&quot; for Alan Betrock&#x27;s Shake Records in 1981. He then signed to Warner Bros. Records, crediting its welcoming environment as instrumental in his decision.

Crenshaw&#x27;s eponymous first album reached number 50 on the American album charts in 1982 and included his signature US hit, &quot;Someday, Someway&quot;. Neo-rockabilly musician Robert Gordon had recorded the song in 1981, reaching number 76; Crenshaw&#x27;s own version made number 36 the next year, becoming his only solo &quot;Billboard&quot; top 40 hit; the single would also reach number 31 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; charts and number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart. Other songs from the album, including &quot;There She Goes Again,&quot; &quot;Cynical Girl,&quot; and &quot;Mary Anne,&quot; have since become fan favorites. Crenshaw himself later expressed a dislike for the album&#x27;s production, though the album saw critical acclaim and was ranked by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as one of the top 100 albums of the 1980s.

His second album, &quot;Field Day&quot;, was released in June 1983 with a bigger production courtesy of producer Steve Lillywhite that divided opinion at the time. Despite positive critical reception, the album was a commercial disappointment, charting lower than his debut at number 52. Despite Crenshaw&#x27;s enthusiasm for the song, lead single &quot;Whenever You&#x27;re on My Mind&quot; failed to reach the Hot 100, peaking third on the Bubbling Under charts. Crenshaw later defended the album&#x27;s production, criticizing the UK-released &quot;U.S. Remix&quot; EP of watered-down alternate mixes of the album tracks &quot;Our Town&quot;, &quot;For Her Love&quot; (in standard and extended versions) and &quot;Monday Morning Rock.&quot;

Due to the commercial decline of &quot;Field Day&quot;, Crenshaw&#x27;s relationship with Warner Bros. began to deteriorate and he sought to change his sound on his third album. 1985&#x27;s &quot;Downtown&quot; featured a rootsier sound and was stewarded by producer T Bone Burnett (except for &quot;Blues Is King&quot;, produced by Mitch Easter). The album reached number 110 on the Billboard chart.

===1986â1996===
In 1986, Crenshaw and his band made a feature appearance playing in the high school reunion scenes in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s film &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;, and contributed &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; to the soundtrack album. Crenshaw also portrayed Buddy Holly in the 1987 Ritchie Valens biopic &quot;La Bamba&quot;, performing his cover of Holly&#x27;s &quot;Crying, Waiting, Hoping&quot; on screen and on the soundtrack album. The album reached number one on Billboard and was certified double platinum. Also in 1986, Owen Paul&#x27;s recording of &quot;You&#x27;re My Favorite Waste of Time&quot; reached number three in the UK and was awarded a Silver Disc. Crenshaw had written the song in 1979 backstage at the Stanley Theater in Pittsburgh, while appearing there with âBeatlemaniaâ.

In 1987, Crenshaw released his fourth album, &quot;Mary Jean &amp; 9 Others&quot;, produced by Don Dixon and featuring Joe Jackson Band bassist Graham Maby on bass. His final album for Warner Bros. in 1989, &quot;Good Evening&quot;, included several cover songs, a decision Crenshaw attributed to his lack of faith in the album and his label. &quot;Good Evening&quot; featured the first released version of Diane Warren&#x27;s &quot;Some Hearts&quot;, later covered by Carrie Underwood.

In 1989, he compiled a collection of Capitol Records country performers of the 1950s and 1960s called &quot;Hillbilly Music...Thank God, Vol. 1&quot;. In 1993, he made an appearance in the TV show &quot;The Adventures of Pete and Pete&quot; as a guitar-playing meter reader, and in 1994, he published a book as editor and contributor, &quot;Hollywood Rock: A Guide to Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll in the Movies&quot;. In 1995, he appeared in the music video for Yo La Tengo&#x27;s single Tom Courtenay.

Crenshaw released two more studio albums during this period, &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Short&quot; (1991) on MCA Records and the self-produced and largely self-performed &quot;Miracle of Science&quot; (1996) on the independent label Razor &amp; Tie. &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Short&quot; featured &quot;Better Back Off&quot;, which reached number 17 on Billboard&#x27;s Alternative Songs Chart. Crenshaw also released the concert album &quot;Live â¦My Truck Is My Home&quot; on Razor &amp; Tie in 1994.

In 1995, Crenshaw co-wrote &quot;Til I Hear It from You&quot; with Jesse Valenzuela and Robin Wilson of the Gin Blossoms. As the band&#x27;s soundtrack contribution to the cult film &quot;Empire Records&quot;, the song played over the closing credits and became a hit single in the US, reaching number 9. Crenshaw was among those who received a Gold record for the film&#x27;s soundtrack album.

===1997âpresent===
Crenshaw has released three more studio albums since 1997: &quot;#447&quot; (1999), &quot;What&#x27;s in the Bag?&quot; (2003), and &quot;Jaggedland&quot; (2009). In 2015, he released &quot;#392: The EP Collection&quot;, a collection of EPs he had released between 2013 and 2015. In 2004 he played guitar as a special guest with the reunited members of the MC5.

Crenshaw penned the title track from the 2007 film &quot;Walk Hard&quot; starring John C. Reilly; the song, as sung by Reilly, was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, and a Grammy. From 2011 until a hiatus in 2017, Crenshaw hosted a radio show called &quot;The Bottomless Pit&quot; on WFUV in New York, featuring his vast collection of recorded music. The show went on a hiatus in 2017 while Crenshaw works on a documentary about producer Tom Wilson.

In 2013, Marshall joined his young friend Viktor Huganet in France, recorded in studio a few songs and played in Paris.

Crenshaw continues to perform about 40-50 concerts a year, most of them within driving distance of his family home. Crenshaw himself has dubbed these shows part of &quot;the NPR singer-songwriter circuit&quot;. Crenshaw has also performed as a guest vocalist for the Smithereens since the 2017 death of their lead singer Pat DiNizio. Crenshaw alternates touring duties with Robin Wilson of the Gin Blossoms and other guest lead vocalists.

==Legacy==
Crenshaw has been lauded by critics as one of the key musicians of the new wave and power pop genres, although he has expressed a dislike for the latter connection, stating, &quot;Some of the stuff I&#x27;ve done you could call power pop, but the term does have sort of a dodgy connotation.&quot; Crenshaw has named 1950s and 60s-era top 40 music as his greatest influence, stating, &quot;I hold that music and that kind of pop approach in really high regard. I have those records in my head. They really won&#x27;t go away.&quot; Crenshaw has frequented comparisons to Buddy Holly. Crenshaw said of Holly:

In 2014, Marshall Crenshaw was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.

Many notable artists have recorded cover versions of Crenshaw&#x27;s songs, including Lou Ann Barton, Ronnie Spector, Robert Gordon, Marti Jones, Bette Midler, and S Club. Scottish musician Owen Paul had an international hit with his version of Crenshaw&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re My Favorite Waste of Time&quot; in 1986, peaking at number 3 in the UK singles charts. Gin Blossoms singer Robin Wilson cited Crenshaw as an inspiration, stating, &quot;A few years back, I dug up one of Marshall&#x27;s records and was listening to it. I thought, &#x27;This is how I sing. This is what I&#x27;m shooting for.

==History==
Evidence of human habitation come from 3,000-year-old remains in a cave in Bacon and ancient burial sites dug upstream of Sorsogon rivers. Spanish missionaries came upon settlements in both sites when they arrived in the 1600s. Moro pirates had already frequented the territorial waters before the arrival of the Spanish missions.

Bacon was established as a &quot;visita&quot; of Casiguran while Sorsogon, originally in Sitio Pocdol in Capuy, was then established as a visita of Bacon. Sorsogon then became an independent, full-fledged parish in 1628 due to an increase in population. The two parishes later became civilian political units.

The Pueblo Civil de Bacon was established in 1754, with Juan Elias as its first gobernadorcillo. Sorsogon became an independent pueblo in 1864. Both Bacon and Sorsogon were under the territorial jurisdiction of the province of Albay until the establishment of the independent province of Sorsogon on October 17, 1894.

<text>Alive is a 1993 American biographical survival drama film based on Piers Paul Read&#x27;s 1974 book &quot;&quot;, which details a Uruguayan rugby team&#x27;s crash aboard Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 into the Andes mountains on October 13, 1972.

Filmed in the Purcell Mountains in British Columbia, the film was directed by Frank Marshall, written by John Patrick Shanley, and narrated by John Malkovich. It features an ensemble cast including Ethan Hawke, Josh Hamilton, Vincent Spano, Bruce Ramsay, John Haymes Newton, Illeana Douglas, and Danny Nucci. One of the survivors, Nando Parrado (portrayed by Hawke in the film), served as the technical advisor for the film.

== Plot ==
A group of photographs of the Stella Maris College&#x27;s Old Christians Rugby Team are seen as Carlitos PÃ¡ez points out several members of the team and reflects on the accident in a brief monologue.

Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 flies over the Andes on October 13, 1972. The raucous rugby players and a few of their relatives and friends are eagerly looking forward to an upcoming match in Chile.

Upon emerging from clouds, the plane encounters turbulence and collides with a mountain. The wings and tail are separated from the fuselage, which slides down a mountain slope before coming to a stop. Six passengers and one flight attendant are ejected from the plane and die. Antonio, the team captain, coordinates efforts to help the injured. Roberto Canessa and Gustavo Zerbino, both medical students, aid the injured. Another six passengers soon die, including both pilots and Nando&#x27;s mother, Eugenia. Nando, who sustained a head injury, falls into a coma, and his sister Susana has suffered severe internal injuries.

As the sun sets, the survivors make preparations for the night. Canessa discovers that the seat covers can be unzipped and used as blankets. The survivors go inside the fuselage and curl up beside one another to stay warm. Antonio, Roy Harley, and Rafael Cano plug the gaping hole at the end of the fuselage with luggage to keep out the wind. Two passengers die overnight. With nothing to hunt or gather on the mountain, Antonio declares they will use rationing when the survivors find a tin of chocolates and a case of wine. After seeing a plane fly past, they think it dipped its wings, and the survivors celebrate. Expecting to be rescued the next day, everyone except Javier, his wife Liliana, and Antonio finish the remaining chocolates. This causes a quarrel among Antonio and several others.

Nando regains consciousness. After learning of his mother&#x27;s death, Nando watches over Susana vigilantly. Knowing she will die of her injuries within a few days, he vows to set off on foot and find a way out of the mountains. When Carlitos reminds him that he will need food, Nando jokingly suggests eating the flesh of the deceased pilots to give him the strength to survive the journey to find help. Susana dies from her injuries. The survivors listen to a radio for word of their rescue but are devastated to hear that the search is to be called off after nine days.

After great debate, the starving passengers decide to eat the flesh of their dead relatives and friends. Zerbino, Rafael, and Juan Martino set off to search for the tail of the plane in hopes of finding batteries for the plane&#x27;s radio to transmit their location. Among pieces of the wreckage, the teammates find additional corpses, but return to the group with news that the tail of the plane is likely a little further away. Later in the week, an avalanche strikes the plane and fills much of the interior with snow. Eight of the survivors, including Antonio and Liliana, are smothered to death by the snow. The remaining 19 survivors are forced to stay inside the plane when they realize there is a blizzard outside.

A second team, made up of Nando, Canessa, and Antonio &quot;Tintin&quot; Vizintin, sets out and finds the tail of the plane. Unable to bring the batteries to the fuselage, they return to the fuselage to get Roy, who is thought to have experience with electrical equipment. They bring him to the tail of the plane to see if he can fix the radio. When Roy is unsuccessful, the team decides to return to the fuselage.

Federico and Alberto die from their injuries, as does Rafael, leading Nando to convince a reluctant Canessa to search for a way out of the mountains, taking Tintin with them. Two days into the journey, they send Tintin back to the fuselage so they can appropriate his rations and continue on their own. After a 12-day trek, the two escape the mountains and alert the authorities to their companions&#x27; location. Two helicopters, one of which has Nando and Canessa on board, appear overhead of the survivors on the mountain, leading the remaining 14 survivors to celebrate their impending rescue.

In the present, Carlitos describes how a group later returned to the site of the crash and buried the corpses under a pile of stones, marked with a cross. The memorial to the 29 deceased and 16 survivors is shown.

== Cast ==
The film opens with a monologue by an older Carlitos Paez played by John Malkovich (uncredited). The names of the people who died in the disaster were changed for the film. There were three key exceptions: Eugenia and Susana Parrado (Nando Parrado&#x27;s mother and sister, respectively), and Liliana Methol (Javier Methol&#x27;s wife).

== Reception ==
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 62% of 29 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.3/10.

David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; said that, while, &quot;Piers Paul Read&#x27;s acclaimed book ... paid special attention to the social structure that evolved among the group ... Marshall ... downplays the fascinating sociological detailsâand the ambiguities of characterâin favor of action, heroism and a vague religiosity that&#x27;s sprinkled over the story like powdered sugar.&quot;

Others, such as Ray Green, praised the tactful nature of the film stating that, &quot;despite the potential for lurid sensationalism, Marshall manages to keep his and the film&#x27;s dignity by steering an effectively downbeat course through some grim goings on thanks in no small manner to the almost allegorical ring of Shanley&#x27;s stylized dialogue.&quot; Green continues by describing the film as, &quot;thrilling and engrossing as it is at times, &quot;Alive&quot; is more than an action filmâin its own way it is also a drama of ideas, and of the human spirit as well.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film a mixed two-and-a-half stars out of a possible four. He praised the &quot;first-rate cast&quot; and cinematography. Yet he wrote: &quot;There are some stories you simply can&#x27;t tell. The story of the Andes survivors may be one of them [due to the] sheer enormity of the experience.&quot; He also questioned the realism of how normal the actors&#x27; bodies looked after portraying two months of near-starvation.

The film grossed $36.7 million in the United States and Canada and $45.8 million internationally for a worldwide total of $82.5 million.

== Documentary ==
A companion documentary, &quot;&quot;, was released at the same time as the film. It includes interviews with the survivors, as well as documentary footage of the rescue. The 30th Anniversary Edition of &quot;Alive: The Miracle of the Andes&quot; (on DVD) includes this documentary in the &quot;Extras&quot; section.

<text>The New Zealand Party operated as a political party in New Zealand from 1983 to 1993. Established by millionaire property tycoon Bob Jones, the party promoted economic liberalisationâit was the first political party to promote free market reforms. It failed to win any seats in Parliament, but it purportedly played a role in causing the defeat of Robert Muldoon&#x27;s National government in the 1984 election by splitting the vote (as a spoiler).

==History==
===Foundation===
At the time of the New Zealand Party&#x27;s foundation in 1983, the Prime Minister was Robert Muldoon. Muldoon was a social conservative but also a strong believer in the need for state intervention in the economy, claiming that only with government involvement could New Zealand be prosperous. In accordance with his economic theories, Muldoon introduced the so-called &quot;Think Big&quot; program, which saw massive overseas borrowing to finance large government construction projects. Later, as New Zealand&#x27;s economy declined and its deficit increased, Muldoon introduced wage and price controls.

Bob Jones, a self-made millionaire and author, strongly opposed these policies, comparing them to what he had recently observed in the Soviet bloc. In a number of newspaper opinion pieces, Jones spoke out against the government, claiming that the National Party had betrayed its principles of individual liberty and free enterprise. For example, Jones advocated a flat tax, while the top rate at the time was 66%. Since Jones had previously been a strong supporter of the National Party and a personal friend of Muldoon, his attacks on the government marked an end to both associations.

Jones attracted considerable attention with his comments. Although he had not originally considered it, a number of people encouraged him to start a new political party. Jones himself believed that a new party could conceivably split the National Party&#x27;s vote, bringing the government down. Jones appears to have hoped that losing an election would help to purge the National Party of &quot;Muldoonism&quot;. Along with some of the people who had contacted him about the matter, Jones began to lay the foundations for a new organization. The party&#x27;s name and motto were chosen, and its primary policies were set out.

When Muldoon heard of Jones&#x27;s plans, he initially dismissed them as a hoax, saying that the rumours were a publicity stunt by Jones. The comments galvanized Jones and his supporters into action, and it was decided to officially launch the new party on 21 August. The launch, which coincided with the release of the party&#x27;s manifesto, was well covered by the media, and the New Zealand Party gained considerable public recognition. Not long after it was founded, some polls showed the party with nearly 20% of the vote.

===Early days===
The policies established by the New Zealand Party differed substantially from those of most of the country&#x27;s other parties. Perhaps its most well-known views related to economic matters, particularly the liberalization of the economy and the adoption of laissez-faire principles. The party also, however, put forward a number of other significant proposals. One example was the party&#x27;s unorthodox defence policy, which advocated a large reduction in military expenditure and the abandonment of New Zealand&#x27;s defence links with Australia and the United States (particularly the ANZUS alliance). Jones himself favoured the total abolition of New Zealand&#x27;s armed forces, but that was considered too radical to be adopted as New Zealand Party policy.

While the New Zealand Party attracted considerable support, it also attracted a considerable amount of criticism. Muldoon labeled the party &quot;greedies&quot;, pointing to Jones&#x27;s personal wealth and to the fact that much of the party&#x27;s support came from the richer sections of society. The party was also attacked by left-wing groups, which objected to its support of free market economics. Both Muldoon and left-wing groups claimed that the New Zealand Party was out of touch with ordinary New Zealanders. In addition, the party also struggled to shake off the perception that it was &quot;the Bob Jones Party&quot; and not a full-fledged political movement. Jones himself was sometimes criticised for his blunt and &quot;politically incorrect&quot; style, but others found it refreshing.

Other prominent figures within the New Zealand Party included Janie Pearce (the deputy leader), Josephine Grierson (an economic policy specialist), Michael Batchelor (spokesman for defence) and Gordon Dryden. Dryden, whose views often clashed with those of other party members, was highly charismatic, and gained a substantial following within the party. In May 1984, he left the party after a major disagreement with Jones.

===1984 election===
When Muldoon unexpectedly called an early election, the New Zealand Party was caught by surprise and had only a month to prepare its campaign. Opinion polls gave a mixed view of the party&#x27;s strength. Some gave it up to 20% of the vote, but others gave it only around 2â3%. Perhaps unwisely, the party did not decide to focus on specific seats, but instead spread its efforts equally across the country.

On election day, the New Zealand Party failed to win any seats. New Zealand then used the plurality voting system, which made it hard for third parties to gain representation in Parliament. The party gained second place in several electorates, and gained third place in many more. However, its votes were dispersed, rather than concentrated in any one area, so it was unable to enter Parliament. In total, the New Zealand Party gained 12.2% of the vote, putting it in third place. The Social Credit Party, although winning only 7.6% of the vote, won two seats, probably as the result of having specifically focused its attention on them since the 1950s.

While its failure to win seats was a major disappointment to the New Zealand Party, it took comfort in the fact that it likely caused the defeat of the government. The opposition Labour Party soundly defeated Muldoon and the National Party, and many commentators believe that the New Zealand Party played a major role in drawing voters away from National. Once in power, the Labour Party (prompted by Finance Minister Roger Douglas) actually adopted many of the New Zealand Party&#x27;s economic policies, much to the resentment of traditional Labour supporters. Douglas even wanted a flat tax, but was stymied by the Labour Prime Minister David Lange. Shortly after the election, the National Party dropped Muldoon as leader and eventually came to embrace free market economics as well.

===Decline===
After the election, the New Zealand Party quickly deteriorated as a significant political force. Jones, his primary objective of ending the Muldoon government having been accomplished, and disappointed by the Party&#x27;s electoral performance in the 1985 Timaru by-election, unilaterally made a decision to put the Party into recess. He later said that with the &quot;Rogernomics&quot; reforms being undertaken by the new administration, he considered his party to be redundant. A few other prominent figures, most notably Party President Malcolm McDonald, also left the party at this stage. Not surprisingly, many in the Party&#x27;s ranks considered Jones&#x27; move to put the party into recess without reference to Party Members to be undemocratic and, despite Jones&#x27; opposition, proceeded to hold the scheduled annual conference in July 1985. At that conference, delegates elected John Galvin, a dairy farmer from Matamata, as Party Leader. In 1986, with its policy platform largely implemented by a reforming Labour Government, beset by funding problems and falling support, the New Zealand Party opted to &quot;merge&quot; into the National Party as an attempt to keep its strong free enterprise and libertarian philosophy alive. The merger was overshadowed by a leadership coup in National that occurred the same day.

However, the name &quot;New Zealand Party&quot; continued to be used by some individuals beyond that point as a Rump party. Galvin was replaced as leader with Stephen Greenfield, the Managing Director of a travel company, who led the remaining party members who opposed the merger with National. Greenfield (who stood in ) led the remaining New Zealand Party in the which saw a huge drop in support. Eventually the remaining members of the party ended up as part of a supposedly centrist party known as the New Zealand Coalition after joining together with fragments of Social Credit and the United NZ Party.

Some commentators see the modern ACT New Zealand party as being the successor of the New Zealand Party, and Bob Jones is counted among ACT&#x27;s supporters. Not everyone would agree with the link, however, and there are a number of notable differences in policy between the two. For example, ACT&#x27;s foreign and defence policies are directly contrary to New Zealand Party policy, with ACT advocating increased defence expenditure and the strengthening of traditional alliances. Even , ACT has never won as many votes as the New Zealand Party gained in 1984.

<text>Curcuma () is a genus of plants in the ginger family Zingiberaceae that contains such species as turmeric and Siam tulip. They are native to Southeast Asia, southern China, the Indian Subcontinent, New Guinea and northern Australia. Some species are reportedly naturalized in other warm parts of the world such as tropical Africa, Central America, Florida, and various islands of the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans. Generally, most curcuma grows well in loose and sandy soil in shaded areas.

== Botanical description ==

Curcuma is a perennial, herbaceous plant that can reach a height of 1 meter. It emits numerous, edible rhizomes whose interiors are yellow or orange. These rhizomes are reduced to a powder, which is the spice called curcuma. Its lanceolate leaves are oblong or elliptical and are of a uniform green, and about 50cm long and 7 to 25 cm wide. 

==Uses==
The name is derived from the Sanskrit &quot;kuá¹kuma&quot;, referring to turmeric. Turmeric is used to flavour or colour curry powders, mustards, butters, and cheeses; it may also be used as a substitute for saffron or other yellowish pigments.

<text>Milton Ager (October 6, 1893 â May 6, 1979) was an American composer, regarded as one of the top songwriters of the 1920s and 1930s. His most lasting compositions include &quot;Ain&#x27;t She Sweetâ and âHappy Days Are Here Againâ.

==Biography==
Ager was born to Jewish couple Fannie Nathan and Simon Ager, who worked as a livestock dealer. in Chicago, Illinois, the sixth of nine children. He taught himself to play the piano, and attended McKinley High School, but left after only three years and embarked on a career in music.

He worked as a song plugger for music publishers Waterson, Berlin &amp; Snyder in Chicago, and also accompanied touring singer Gene Greene and provided accompaniment to silent movies. He moved to New York City in 1914, as an arranger for the publishing firm, and began composing music in association with Pete Wendling. After some time in the US Army&#x27;s Morale Division in Fort Greenleaf, Georgia, he returned to work in 1918 and wrote his first hit song, &quot;Everything is Peaches Down in Georgia&quot; with lyricist Grant Clarke, for Al Jolson. He then started working with lyricist Jack Yellen, and they wrote together for the 1920 Broadway show &quot;What&#x27;s in a Name&quot;, featuring the song &quot;A Young Man&#x27;s Fancy&quot;. He continued to have success over the next few years with the songs &quot;I&#x27;m Nobody&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1921, written with Benny Davis and Lester Santly), and &quot;Who Cares?&quot; (1922, written with Yellen).

In 1922, Ager and Yellen co-founded the publishing company of Ager, Yellen and Bornstein. He composed many hit songs over the next decade, many with lyrics by Yellen, including âThe Last of the Red Hot Mamas!â, &quot;Lovin&#x27; Sam (The Sheik of Alabam&#x27;)â (1922), âHard Hearted Hannah (The Vamp of Savannah)â (1924), &quot;Ain&#x27;t She Sweetâ (1927), and âHappy Days Are Here Againâ (1929). In 1930, he moved to Hollywood, and contributed to such films as &quot;Chasing Rainbows&quot; and &quot;King of Jazz&quot; (both 1930). Together with &quot;A Bench in the Park&quot;, &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot; was included in the latter film, and was adopted by Franklin D. Roosevelt in his 1932 presidential election campaign. After Warner Brothers bought the firm of Ager, Yellen and Bornstein, Ager continued to write lyrics successfully in Hollywood for several years, his later successes including &quot;Auf Wiedersehen My Dear&quot; (1932) and &quot;Trust in Me&quot; (1937). He effectively retired in the 1940s.

Ager was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1979. He died in Inglewood, California, in the same year, aged 85, and was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

In 2007, a revue of Ager&#x27;s music called &quot;Vampin&#x27; Lady&quot; opened in New Hope, Pennsylvania, performed by singer Joyce Moody under the direction of Earl Wentz and transferred to New York City as part of the American Composer Series.

==Family==

<text>Laurie Foell (born Laurence Foel on 10 February 1968) is an Australian actress. She is best known for her portrayal of both Angela &quot;Angie&quot; Russell and her cousin Josie, in the successful Australian television soap opera &quot;Home and Away&quot;. Foell also starred as Dr. Justine Jones in the long running New Zealand hospital soap &quot;Shortland Street&quot;.

==Career==
===&quot;Home and Away&quot;===
Foell first appeared in &quot;Home and Away&quot; in 1999 in a small role playing Kelly McCane. She returned to the show as the conniving and psychotic super-bitch Angie Russell in September 2002, when the show&#x27;s ratings were slipping. Her character quickly became one of Australia&#x27;s favourite villainesses with many fans referring to her six months on the show (ending in April 2003) as the &quot;Angie Era&quot;. The storylines revolving around her â ultimately ending in her murder, and subsequent investigation â are credited with giving the show a resurgence in popularity.

Half a year later, viewers were shocked with the revelation in the 2003 season finale that new girl Tasha (played by Isabel Lucas) was Angie&#x27;s daughter â a move which led to Foell returning to the show briefly as Angie in 2004 as visions haunting Tasha. Foell returned to the show in August 2004 in a new role as Angie&#x27;s cousin Josie Russell, whom she played until June 2005.

===&quot;Shortland Street&quot;===
In 2005 she appeared in a six-week recurring guest role on &quot;Shortland Street&quot; as Justine Jones, an ambitious career driven doctor hired to assist Dr. Chris Warner (played by Michael Galvin) with the Plastics Unit. Justine used her position to undermine Chris and eventually stole the contract away from him and took it to Australia. In July 2006, Laurie Foell reprised her &quot;Shortland Street&quot; role full-time, with Justine being controversially given a senior surgeon role at the hospital.

It was announced on 22 November 2006 that &quot;Shortland Street&quot; would replace Foell in the role of Justine Jones with actress Lucy Wigmore. South Pacific Pictures, which makes the show, said Foell&#x27;s departure was a &quot;mutual decision&quot;. There was some speculation into the details of this due to anonymous postings on a fan website, which suggested the departure was less than mutual. &quot;Shortland Street&quot; producer Jason Daniel said Justine Jones was a popular character, central to both current and upcoming storylines, hence the decision to recast the role, a first for the kiwi soap opera.

===Other work===
Foell&#x27;s other acting credits include a starring role in the New Zealand soap opera &quot;City Life&quot; in 1996 and several small parts in various films.

Bishop was born in New York City on October 4, 1927. He had at least two sisters, Marian and Beverly. His father was composer Walter Bishop Sr. In his teens, Bishop Jr.&#x27;s friends included future jazz musicians Kenny Drew, Sonny Rollins, and Art Taylor. He was brought up in Harlem. He left high school to play in dance bands in the area. In 1945â47 he was in the Army Air Corps. During his military service in 1947 Bishop was based near St Louis and met touring bebop musicians.

==Later life and career==
Later in 1947, he returned to New York. That year (or 1949) he was part of drummer Art Blakey&#x27;s band for 14 weeks and recorded with them. Bishop developed his bebop playing in part by playing in jam sessions at Minton&#x27;s Playhouse.

He recorded with Milt Jackson and Stan Getz in 1949, then played with Charlie Parker (1951â54), Oscar Pettiford, Kai Winding, and Miles Davis (1951â53). At this time he was also a drug addict, which led to imprisonment and the withdrawal of his New York City Cabaret Card. In 1956, he recorded with Hank Mobley. According to the New Grove Dictionary of Jazz, &quot;at some point he became a Muslim and took the name Ibrahim ibn Ismail, but he did not use this publicly.&quot; In the early 1960s he also led his own trio with Jimmy Garrison and G. T. Hogan.

After studying at The Juilliard School with Hall Overton in the late 1960s, Bishop taught music theory at colleges in Los Angeles in the 1970s. At some point prior to moving from New York to Los Angeles, Bishop met and married the former Valerie Isabel Paul. They then moved to Los Angeles. According Jay Blotcher, Valerie Bishop&#x27;s son from a previous relationship, after divorcing Walter Bishop in the mid-1970s, Valerie Bishop worked as an assistant for Ike and Tina Turner in California. Valerie Bishop was cited by Tina Turner in Turner&#x27;s memoir &quot;I, Tina&quot; as the person who inspired Turner to pursue Buddhism.

In the 1980s, Bishop taught at the University of Hartford. By this time, he made frequent appearances at clubs and festivals in New York. He also wrote a book, &quot;A Study in Fourths&quot;, about jazz improvisation based on cycles of fourths and fifths. His debut recording as a leader was in the 1960s. He continued performing into the 1990s.

Bishop died of a heart attack at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Manhattan on January 24, 1998. He was survived by his wife, Keiko; his mother, and two sisters.

==Playing style==
Bishop was influenced at an early stage by Bud Powell. Later, Bishop was &quot;known for holding back on the beat, a device that added tension to the music.&quot;

<text>A bedroom or bedchamber is a room situated within a residential or accommodation unit characterized by its usage for sleeping. A typical western bedroom contains as bedroom furniture one or two beds, a clothes closet, and bedside table and dressing table, both of which usually contain drawers. In dwellings with multiple stories, bedrooms are often on the upper floors. Beds range from a crib for an infant; a single or twin bed for a toddler, child, teenager or single adult; to bigger sizes like a full, double, queen, king or California king). Beds and bedrooms are often devised to create barriers to insects and vermin, especially mosquitoes, and to dampen or contain light or noise to aid sleep and privacy.

==History==
In the 14th century, the lower class slept on mattresses that were stuffed with hay and broom straws. Servants usually slept in various rooms, rolling up and putting away their bedding during the day. During the 16th century, mattresses stuffed with feathers started to gain popularity, with those who could afford them. The common person was doing well if he could buy a mattress after seven years of marriage. In the 18th century cotton and wool started to become more common. 

The first coil spring mattress was not invented until 1871. The most common and most purchased mattress is the innerspring mattress, though a wide variety of alternative materials are available including foam, latex, wool, and even silk. The variety of firmness choices range from relatively soft to a rather firm mattress. A bedroom may have bunk beds if two or more people share a room. A chamber pot kept under the bed or in a nightstand was usual in the period before modern domestic plumbing and bathrooms in dwellings.

In larger Victorian houses it was common to have accessible from the bedroom a boudoir for the lady of the house and a dressing room for the gentleman. Attic bedrooms exist in some houses; since they are only separated from the outside air by the roof they are typically cold in winter and may be too hot in summer. The slope of the rafters supporting a pitched roof also makes them inconvenient. In houses where servants were living in they often used attic bedrooms.

==Furnishings==

Furniture and other items in bedrooms vary greatly, depending on taste, local traditions and the socioeconomic status of an individual. For instance, a master bedroom (also referred to as a &quot;masters bedroom&quot; in the Philippines) may include a bed of a specific size (double, king or queen-sized); one or more dressers (or perhaps, a wardrobe); a nightstand; one or more closets; and carpeting. Built-in closets are less common in Europe than in North America; thus there is greater use of freestanding wardrobes or armoires in Europe.

An individual&#x27;s bedroom is a reflection of their personality, as well as social class and socioeconomic status, and is unique to each person. However, there are certain items that are common in most bedrooms. Mattresses usually have a bed set to raise the mattress off the floor and the bed often provides some decoration. There are many different types of mattresses.

Night stands are also popular. They are used to put various items on, such as an alarm clock or a small lamp. In the times before bathrooms existed in dwellings bedrooms often contained a washstand for tasks of personal hygiene. In the 2010s, having a television set in a bedroom is fairly common as well. 43% of American children from ages 3 to 4 have a television in their bedrooms. Along with television sets many bedrooms also have computers, video game consoles, and a desk to do work. In the late 20th century and early 21st century the bedroom became a more social environment and people started to spend a lot more time in their bedrooms than in the past.

Bedding used in northern Europe (especially in Scandinavia) is significantly different from that used in North America and other parts of Europe. In Japan futons are common.

In addition to a bed (or, if shared by two or more children, a bunk bed), a child&#x27;s bedroom may include a small closet or dressers, a toy box or computer game console, bookcase or other items.
==Modern bedrooms==

Many houses in North America have at least two bedroomsâusually a master bedroom and one or more bedrooms for either children or guests.

In some jurisdictions, there are basic features (such as a closet and a &quot;means of egress&quot;) that a room must have in order to legally qualify as a bedroom. In many states, such as Alaska, bedrooms are not required to have closets and must instead meet minimum size requirements.

A closet by definition is a small space used to store things. In a bedroom, a closet is most commonly used for clothes and other small personal items that one may have. Walk in closets are more popular today and vary in size. However, in the past wardrobes have been the most prominent. A wardrobe is a tall rectangular shaped cabinet in which clothes can be stored or hung. Clothes are also kept in a dresser. Typically nicer clothes are kept in the closet because they can be hung up while leisure clothing and undergarments are stored in the dresser.

In buildings with multiple self-contained housing units (e.g., apartments), the number of bedrooms varies widely. While many such units have at least one bedroomâfrequently, these units have at least twoâsome of these units may not have a specific room dedicated for use as a bedroom. (These units may be known by various names, including &quot;studio, efficiency, bedsit&quot;, and others.)

Sometimes, a master bedroom is connected to a dedicated bathroom, often called an ensuite or master bathroom.

==Culture==

Bedrooms typically have a door for privacy (in some cases lockable from inside) and a window for ventilation. In larger bedrooms, a small desk and chair or an upholstered chair and a chest of drawers may also be used. In Western countries, some large bedrooms, called master bedrooms, may also contain a bathroom. Where space allows bedrooms may also have televisions and / or video players, and in some cases a personal computer.

==Around the world==
=== Japan ===
In Japan, the notion of having a bedroom is much less important than it is in the West, especially as it pertains to having a private space for personal use. Indeed, having a unified house corresponds to having a unified family, a concept so important that areas are seldom personalized, even those pertaining to relationships. Everything is subject to the concept of primitive cohesion. This makes for flexibility in terms of the way various spaces are utilized: Each evening, the Japanese unroll their futon directly on their tatami mats, typically close to one another. They then put them away come morning in the oshiire. The unity of the household is also reinforced by the use of sliding partitions (shoji) lined with rice paper and insulating in every way.

Materially, the Japanese tatami room, as opposed to its Western counterpart (deemed The Western Room), has no door, bed, or even wall, making it barely detectable in space.

This room is typically situated towards the back of the home, close to the place dedicated to the family ancestors and opposite of the southern faÃ§ade, the gardens, and the general exterior.

The second half of the twentieth century saw a considerable change in the bedroom style. Almost non-existent before World War Two, The Western Room continued to gain traction in new constructions to the point where there is a clear relationship between the age of a building and the presence of Western-style bedrooms. Cultural habits, however, have not shifted as rapidly.

In the most densely populated cities, there exists a type of hotel essentially consisting of stacks of individual rooms so cramped they hardly allow one to do more than lie down and sleep. These are called capsule hotels, and have spread to areas such as Singapore and Taiwan.
