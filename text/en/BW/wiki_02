==History==
===Roots and foundation===

Before 1907, rugby union in Toulouse was only played in schools or universities. In 1893, students of secondary school &quot;Lycée de Toulouse&quot; got together in a new team &quot;Les Sans-Soucis&quot;. Once attending university, the same students founded &quot;l&#x27;Olympique Toulousain&quot;, which became &quot;Stade Olympien des Étudiants de Toulouse&quot; (SOET) a few years later in 1896. In the same period, &#x27;non-students&#x27; grouped in &quot;le Sport Athlétique Toulousain&quot; (SAT) while students of the veterinary school created &quot;l&#x27;Union Sportive de l&#x27;École Vétérinaire&quot; (USEV). Both entities merged in 1905 and called themselves &quot;Véto-Sport&quot;. Finally in 1907, Stade Toulousain was founded resulting from a union between the SOET and Véto-Sport.

Since its creation in 1907, Stade Toulousain drew on the past of the city. The design of Stade Toulousain&#x27;s crest refers to the initials of Thomas Aquinas ( in French ; S and T, same as the club&#x27;s name) whose bones rest in the Church of the Jacobins, in Toulouse. The interlaced letters came from a famous tiled floor of the Basilica of Saint-Sernin, where the relics were temporarily moved for almost two centuries after the French Revolution. The historical colours, red and black, are rooted in the ceremonial costume of the capitouls of Toulouse. A municipal body created in 1147, the capitouls were until the French Revolution the consuls of the city. Their traditional costume was red and black (with white bands), as shown in the oldest portraits dating from the 14th century.

===Early years===

Stade Toulousain played its first final of the national title French Championship in 1909 and lost it to Stade Bordelais Université Club (17–0) in Toulouse. In 1912 Stade Toulousain won its first national title. It had to wait until 1922 before it won its second. However the 1920s were a golden era for the club. Their first final action in the 1920s was in 1921, when they were defeated by USA Perpignan. Despite losing in 1921, the side went on to win the 1922, 1923, 1924, 1926 and 1927 championships.

===1930s to 1950s===
The following decades were relatively quiet after such a dominant era during the 1920s. Stade Toulousain would not make it to any grand finals during the 1930s, and it would not be until the late 1940s when they would return. However they did contest the Challenge Yves du Manoir with RC Toulon in 1934, though it ended in a nil-all tie and both teams were winners. The club made it to the final of the 1947 championship, and claimed the premiership, beating SU Agen, 10 to 3. However, no such championships followed, the club was again relatively quiet on the championship. It was 22 years in the waiting; Toulouse made it to the final, but were defeated by the CA Bègles club.

===1970s to 1980s===
In 1971 Toulouse contested the Challenge Yves du Manoir against US Dax, losing 18 to 8. Eleven years after the CA Bègles defeat, the club was again disappointed in the final, being defeated by AS Béziers in the championship game of 1980. The latter end of the decade was however, reminiscent of the 1920s sides. Toulouse were again contesting the Challenge Yves du Manoir for the 1984 season, though they lost to RC Narbonne 17 to 3. They did however claim their first championship since 1947, defeating RC Toulon in the 1985 final. The following season saw them successfully defend their championship, defeating SU Agen in the final. After a number of defeats in the Challenge Yves du Manoir finals, Toulouse defeated US Dax to win the 1988 competition. Both Toulon and Agen won the following premierships (1987 and 1988) but Toulouse won another championship in 1989.

===1990s to present===
The dominance continued in the 1990s, starting with a grand final loss in 1991, and a Challenge Yves du Manoir championship in 1993, defeating Castres 13 to 8 in the final. The mid-1990s saw Stade Toulousain become a major force yet again, as the club claimed four premierships in a row, winning the championship in 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997, as well as the Challenge Yves du Manoir in 1995. The club emulated its success in the European Rugby Cup, becoming the first ever champions in the 1995–96 season.
The late 1990s and the 2000s saw the club again reach great heights. The club won the Challenge Yves du Manoir in 1998, defeating Stade Français Paris, the 1999 championship as well as the 2001 championship. They also were runners-up in the 2003 season, losing to Stade Français in the final. As the club had done in the mid-1990s, Stade Toulousain replicated this success in the European Rugby Cup, winning the 2002–03 and the 2004–05 cups. The club made it to the final of the 2005-06 Top 14, and despite only trailing Biarritz 9–6 at half time, Toulouse could not prevent a second-half whitewash, eventually going down 40–13. They ended their seven-year title drought with a 26–20 win over ASM Clermont Auvergne on 28 June 2008. In 2008 they narrowly lost a Heineken Cup Final to Munster by 3 points. In 2010 Toulouse defeated Leinster to reach the final where they faced Biarritz Olympique at Stade de France in Paris on Saturday 22 May 2010. Toulouse won the game by 21–19 to claim their fourth Heineken Cup title, making them the first club to win the title four times. Stade Toulousain is also the only French club to have taken part in all the editions of Heineken Cup since its creation (17, with the 2011–12 season). They won the French championship in 2011 against Montpellier (15–10) and 2012 against Toulon (18–12). Stade Toulousain reached the semi-finals of the French championship 20 consecutive years (from 1994 to 2013). In 2019, Toulouse came back to victory, earning a 20th French Rugby Union Championship title before making an historic double, winning the 2021 Champions Cup and the 2021 Top 14. Their latest title is the 2023 French championship earned against La Rochelle, teams were ranked respectively first and second of the regular season 2023.
They won the champions cup for the 6th time after beating Leinster 31–22 at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium and as a result became the highest ranked team in Europe

==Stadium==
Toulouse play their home games at the Stade Ernest-Wallon, which was built in the late 1980s and was recently renovated. It has a capacity of 19,500. Stade Toulousain is one of the rare teams, in France and especially in rugby union, that own its stadium. Since February 2020, it has also been home to rugby league team Toulouse Olympique, which currently competes in the 2nd tier Championship, following negotiations and an agreement between both executive boards.

The stadium however cannot always accommodate all the fans of the Toulouse club. For the larger fixtures, such as championship or Champions Cup games or play-offs, the fixture may be moved to Stadium de Toulouse, which has more capacity, 33,150. The stadium was used for numerous matches at the 2007 Rugby World Cup and will host the 2023 Rugby World Cup.

<doc id="633853" wikidata="Q2548752" url="?curid=633853" title="Collective behavior">
<text>The expression collective behavior was first used by Franklin Henry Giddings and employed later by Robert Park and Ernest Burgess, Herbert Blumer, Ralph H. Turner and Lewis Killian, and Neil Smelser to refer to social processes and events which do not reflect existing social structure (laws, conventions, and institutions), but which emerge in a &quot;spontaneous&quot; way. Use of the term has been expanded to include reference to cells, social animals like birds and fish, and insects including ants. Collective behavior takes many forms but generally violates societal norms. Collective behavior can be tremendously destructive, as with riots or mob violence, silly, as with fads, or anywhere in between. Collective behavior is always driven by group dynamics, encouraging people to engage in acts they might consider unthinkable under typical social circumstances.

==Defining the field==

Turner and Killian were the first sociologists to back their theoretical propositions with visual evidence in the form of photographs and motion pictures of collective behavior in action. Prior to that sociologists relied heavily upon eyewitness accounts, which turned out to be far less reliable than one would hope.

Turner and Killian&#x27;s approach is based largely upon the arguments of Blumer, who argued that social &quot;forces&quot; are not really forces. The actor is active: He creates an interpretation of the acts of others, and acts on the basis of this interpretation.

== Examples ==
Here are some instances of collective behavior: the Los Angeles riot of 1992, the hula-hoop fad of 1958, the stock market crashes of 1929, and the &quot;phantom gasser&quot; episodes in Virginia in 1933–34 and Mattoon, IL in 1944. The claim that such diverse episodes all belong to a single field of inquiry is a theoretical assertion, and not all sociologists would agree with it. But Blumer and Neil Smelser did agree, as did others, indicating that the formulation has satisfied some leading sociological thinkers.

===Four forms===
Although there are several other schema that may be used to classify forms of collective behavior the following four categories from Blumer are generally considered useful by most sociologists.

====The crowd====
Scholars differ about what classes of social events fall under the rubric of collective behavior. In fact, the only class of events which all authors include is crowds. 
Clark McPhail is one of those who treats crowds and collective behavior as synonyms. Although some consider McPhail&#x27;s work overly simplistic, his important contribution is to have gone beyond the speculations of others to carry out pioneering empirical studies of crowds. He finds them to form an elaborate set of types.

The classic treatment of crowds is Gustave LeBon, &quot;The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind&quot;, in which the author interpreted the crowds of the French Revolution as irrational reversions to animal emotion, and inferred from this that such reversion is characteristic of crowds in general. LeBon believed that crowds somehow induced people to lose their ability to think rationally and to somehow recover this ability once they had left the crowd. He speculated, but could not explain how this might occur. Freud expressed a similar view in &quot;Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego&quot;. Such authors have thought that their ideas were confirmed by various kinds of crowds, one of these being the economic bubble. In Holland, during the tulip mania (1637), the prices of tulip bulbs rose to astronomical heights. An array of such crazes and other historical oddities is narrated in Charles MacKay&#x27;s &quot;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&quot;.

At the University of Chicago, Robert Park and Herbert Blumer agreed with the speculations of LeBon and other that crowds are indeed emotional. But to them a crowd is capable of any emotion, not only the negative ones of anger and fear.

A number of authors modify the common-sense notion of the crowd to include episodes during which the participants are not assembled in one place but are dispersed over a large area. Turner and Killian refer to such episodes as &quot;diffuse&quot; crowds, examples being Billy Graham&#x27;s revivals, panics about sexual perils, witch hunts and Red scares. Their expanded definition of the crowd is justified if propositions which hold true among compact crowds do so for diffuse crowds as well.

Some psychologists have claimed that there are three fundamental human emotions: fear, joy, and anger. Neil Smelser, John Lofland, and others have proposed three corresponding forms of the crowd: the panic (an expression of fear), the craze (an expression of joy), and the hostile outburst (an expression of anger). Each of the three emotions can characterize either a &quot;compact&quot; or a &quot;diffuse&quot; crowd, the result being a scheme of six types of crowds. Lofland has offered the most explicit discussion of these types.

====The public====
Boom distinguishes the crowd, which expresses a &quot;common emotion&quot;, from a public, which discusses a &quot;single issue&quot;. Thus, a public is not equivalent to all of the members of a society. Obviously, this is not the usual use of the word, &quot;public.&quot; To Park and Blumer, there are as many publics as there are issues. A public comes into being when discussion of an issue begins, and ceases to be when it reaches a decision on it.

====The mass====
To the crowd and the public Blumer adds a third form of collective behavior, the mass. It differs from both the crowd and the public in that it is defined not by a form of interaction but by the efforts of those who use the mass media to address an audience. The first mass medium was printing.

====The social movement====

We change intellectual gears when we confront Blumer&#x27;s final form of collective behavior, the social movement. He identifies several types of these, among which are &quot;active&quot; social movements such as the French Revolution and &quot;expressive&quot; ones such as Alcoholics Anonymous. An active movement tries to change society; an expressive one tries to change its own members.

The social movement is the form of collective behavior which satisfies least well the first definition of it which was offered at the beginning of this article. These episodes are less fluid than the other forms, and do not change as often as other forms do. Furthermore, as can be seen in the history of the labor movement and many religious sects, a social movement may begin as collective behavior but over time become firmly established as a social institution.

For this reason, social movements are often considered a separate field of sociology. The books and articles about them are far more numerous than the sum of studies of all the other forms of collective behavior put together. Social movements are considered in many Wikipedia articles, and an article on the field of social movements as a whole would be much longer than this essay.

The study of collective behavior spun its wheels for many years, but began to make progress with the appearance of Turner and Killian&#x27;s &quot;Collective Behavior&quot; and Smelser&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Collective Behavior&quot;. Both books pushed the topic of collective behavior back into the consciousness of American sociologists and both theories contributed immensely to our understanding of collective behavior. Social disturbances in the U. S. and elsewhere in the late &#x27;60s and early &#x27;70s inspired another surge of interest in crowds and social movements. These studies presented a number of challenges to the armchair sociology of earlier students of collective behavior.

== Theories developed to explain collective behavior ==
Social scientists have developed various theories to explain crowd behavior.

#Contagion theory – according to the contagion theory as formulated by French thinker Gustave Le Bon (1841-1931), crowds exert a hypnotic influence over their members. Shielded by anonymity, large numbers of people abandon personal responsibility and surrender to the contagious emotions of the crowd. A crowd thus assumes a life of its own, stirring up emotions and driving people toward irrational, even violent action. Le Bon&#x27;s theory, although one of the earliest explanations of crowd behavior, is still accepted by many people outside of sociology. However, critics argue that the &quot;collective mind&quot; has not been documented by systematic studies. Furthermore, although collective behavior may involve strong emotions, such feelings are not necessarily irrational. Turner and Killian argue convincingly that the &quot;contagion&quot; never actually occurs and that participants in collective behavior do not lose their ability to think rationally.
#Convergence theory – whereas the contagion theory suggests that crowds cause people to act in a certain way, convergence theory states that people who want to act in a certain way come together to form crowds. Developed by Floyd Allport (1890-1979) and later expanded upon by Neal Miller (1909-2002) and John Dollard (1900-1980) as &quot;Learning Theory&quot;, the central argument of all convergence theories is that collective behavior reveals the otherwise hidden tendencies of the individuals who take part in the episode. The theory asserts that people with similar attributes find other like-minded persons with whom they can release these underlying tendencies. People sometimes do things in a crowd that they would not have the courage to do alone - because crowds can diffuse responsibility - but the behavior itself is claimed to originate within the individuals. Crowds, in addition, can intensify a sentiment simply by creating a critical mass of like-minded people.
#Emergent-norm theory – according to sociologists Ralph Turner (1919-2014) and Lewis Killian, crowds begin as collectivities composed of people with mixed interests and motives. Especially in the case of less-stable crowds — expressive, acting and protest crowds — norms may be vague and changing, as when one person decides to break the glass windows of a store and others join in and begin looting merchandise. When people find themselves in a situation that is vague, ambiguous, or confusing, new norms &quot;emerge&quot; on the spot and people follow those emergent norms, which may be at odds with normal social behavior. Turner and Killian further argue that there are several different categories of participants, all of whom follow different patterns of behavior due to their differing motivations.
#Value-added theory – Professor Neil Smelser (1930-2017) argues that collective behavior is actually a sort of release-valve for built-up tension (&quot;strain&quot;) within a social system, community, or group. If the proper determinants are present then collective behavior becomes inevitable. Conversely, if any of the key determinants are not present no collective behavior will occur unless and until the missing determinants fall into place. These are primarily social, although physical factors such as location and weather may also contribute to or hinder the development of collective behavior.
#Complex Adaptive Systems theory – Dutch scholar Jaap van Ginneken (1943- ) claims that contagion, convergence and emergent norms are just instances of the synergy, emergence and autopoiesis or self-creation of patterns and new entities typical for the newly discovered meta-category of complex adaptive systems. This also helps explain the key role of salient details and path-dependence in rapid shifts.
#Shared intentionality theory – Cognitive psychologist Professor Michael Tomasello (1950- ) developed the psychological construct of shared intentionality through his insights into cognition evolution and, specifically, the knowledge development about the contribution of shared intentionality to the formation of a social reality. Shared intentionality provides unaware processes in mother-child dyads during social learning when young organisms can only manifest simple reflexes. It increases the cognitive performance of children indwelling with mothers who know the correct answer. This interaction proceeds without communication within the dyad using sensory cues. Professor Igor Val Danilov argues that this performance succeeds due to sharing an essential stimulus during a single cognitive task in the shared ecological context. Furthermore, research shows that shared intentionality can appear even in groups of more mature organisms due to their physiological synchrony and group dynamics. Therefore, this interaction can provide subliminal compliance of the participants to the group decisions, encouraging people to engage in acts they might consider unthinkable under typical social circumstances. The hypothesis of neurobiological processes occurring during shared intentionality explains how organisms can share relevant sensory stimuli without communication within the group using sensory cues.

<text>Hart&#x27;s War is a 2002 American war drama film about a World War II prisoner of war (POW) camp based on the novel by John Katzenbach. It stars Bruce Willis as Col. William McNamara and Colin Farrell as Lt. Thomas Hart. The film co-stars Terrence Howard, Cole Hauser, and Marcel Iures. Directed by Gregory Hoblit, the film was shot at Barrandov Studios in Prague, and released on February 15, 2002. The film earned mixed reviews, grossing $33.1 million against its $70 million budget.

==Plot==
In late 1944 during the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, U.S. Army intelligence officer First Lieutenant Thomas Hart (Farrell) is captured by German forces. While interrogating Hart, the Germans coerce him to divulge intelligence by taking away his boots, causing his feet to become frostbitten and badly injured, and leaving him, naked, in a very cold cell. He is then transferred by train to Stalag VI-A prisoner of war camp at Hemer, Germany. While en route, a P-51 Mustang attacks (the letters POW were painted on the top of the train, but got covered by thick snow). To save themselves, the POWs leave the train and spell P-O-W with their bodies and prevent further strafing.

After arriving at the new POW camp, Lt. Hart is interviewed by the ranking American officer, Colonel William McNamara (Willis). When McNamara asks if he cooperated with the Germans after he was captured, Hart denies it. McNamara knows this to be a lie when Hart says he only endured three days of interrogation. McNamara does not reveal this to Hart, but sends him to bunk in a barracks for enlisted men, rather than allow him to bunk with the other officers.

Two Black pilots are brought to the camp and assigned to Hart&#x27;s barracks. They are the only African Americans in the camp, and their situation is compounded by their status as officers. Staff Sgt. Vic W. Bedford (Hauser), a racist, is their primary antagonist. One of the pilots, Lt. Lamar Archer, is executed when accused of keeping a weapon that Bedford had planted in his bunk. When Bedford himself subsequently turns up dead, the surviving pilot, Lt. Lincoln A. Scott (Howard) is accused of killing Bedford in retaliation. A law student before the war, Hart is appointed by McNamara to defend the accused pilot at his court-martial, a trial to which the amused camp commandant, Oberst Werner Visser (Iureş) agrees. As the court martial proceeds, Hart struggles to prove reasonable doubt while dismissing Lt. Scott&#x27;s motive, means, and opportunity. As the trial proceeds, Scott takes the stand and takes the opportunity to rail against the racism he and Archer faced in the Army, and excoriates McNamara for forcing two black pilots to bunk in the enlisted men&#x27;s barracks.

As Hart&#x27;s defense threatens to unintentionally call attention to subterfuge by the POWs, McNamara reveals to Hart in private that the &quot;defense,&quot; like the trial itself, is a sham, an elaborate distraction to hide a planned attack on a nearby ammunition plant (which the U.S. Army Air Force mistakenly believes to be a shoe factory) by McNamara and his men, in aid of the war effort. It is revealed that Bedford planted the weapon in Archer&#x27;s bunk, knowing the guards would kill Archer for it. In return, Bedford informed the guards of the location of a secret radio. It is also revealed Bedford planned to escape with money and clothes, likely in return for telling the Nazis about McNamara&#x27;s plan. Upon realizing Bedford&#x27;s plot, McNamara killed Bedford to prevent it. Hart is shocked that McNamara as a senior officer would sacrifice Scott to protect the planned attack on the ammunition plant. McNamara reminds Hart that in war, sometimes one man must be sacrificed to save the lives of many. Hart acknowledges this, but retorts that it is McNamara&#x27;s duty to ensure that he should be the sacrifice, not Scott. Disgusted, McNamara says that Hart does not know anything about duty, in reference to how Hart gave in to a &quot;Level 1&quot; interrogator after three days, whereas McNamara was tortured for a month. Nonetheless, McNamara is shaken by Hart&#x27;s words. The night before the court martial concludes, he visits Scott in his holding cell and gifts him his personal Bible.

On the last day of the court martial, McNamara and his men feign food poisoning in order to abstain from the trial. As they proceed to the ammunition plant via a hidden tunnel, McNamara overhears Hart falsely confessing to the murder of Bedford in order to save Lt. Scott&#x27;s life. Oberst Visser immediately dissolves the court martial and orders the entire camp to gather outside to witness Hart&#x27;s execution. Upon learning that the &quot;sick&quot; soldiers are missing, Visser examines the barracks and discovers the hidden tunnel. Infuriated, he orders that all prisoners involved in the court martial are to be executed immediately, starting with Hart. It is then that McNamara returns, just as explosives detonate and destroy the plant, and takes responsibility. Visser personally executes him on the spot, but spares the remaining prisoners. Three months later, the German army surrenders to the Allies. The prison camp is liberated and all of the surviving prisoners, including Hart, are sent home. Hart&#x27;s final comments are that he learned about honor, duty, and sacrifice.

==Cast==
==Production==
MGM purchased the film rights to the novel a year before it was published. Producer David Foster bought the rights after viewing the manuscript, seeing it was seven chapters long and had a memo saying where it was going. The film title was originally called &quot;Grant&#x27;s War&quot;, which they felt was too Civil War-esque for a film set during World War II. Jeb Stuart was hired to adapt the novel. Alfonso Cuarón was hired to direct, and Terry George provided rewrites to the screenplay. The studio planned to begin shooting in April 2000, but Cuarón left the film to work on &quot;Y tu mamá también&quot;. Edward Norton was initially cast as Tommy Hart.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Produced on a budget of $70 million, the film grossed $33.1 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
&quot;Hart&#x27;s War&quot; received mixed reviews. The film holds a 60% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 122 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Well-made and solidly acted, &quot;Hart&#x27;s War&quot; is modestly compelling. However, the movie suffers from having too many subplots&quot;. Metacritic rated it 49/100 based on 32 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

<text>The spotted moray (&quot;Gymnothorax moringa&quot;) is a medium to large moray eel. Other common names include conger, spotted eel, red moray, speckled moray, white cong, white jawed moray, white-chinned moray and white-jawed moray eel. Spotted eels have a long snake-like body, white or pale yellow in general with small overlapping reddish brown to dark-brown spots. They are commonly in length and can grow up to , weighing . They inhabit the Western Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina and Bermuda to Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. They are also found around the Mid- and Eastern Atlantic islands as far south as St Helena. They are typically found anywhere from the surface to a depth of . 

Spotted morays are solitary animals, and usually hide in narrow crevices and holes in reef structures with only their heads peeking out. They are active during the day, feeding on crustaceans, molluscs and fish at or near the sea bottom. Their bite can be dangerous to humans due to damage caused by the pull-back effect of the bite itself, and potential toxins that may be released into the wound. There is a minor fishery for spotted eels, and they are also kept in aquariums until their size makes it impractical to do so.

<doc id="633877" wikidata="Q7407050" url="?curid=633877" title="Sam (Book of Mormon)">
<text>Sam is a minor character in the early part of the Book of Mormon narrative. He is the third son of Lehi and the older brother of Nephi, the narrator of the Book of Mormon&#x27;s first two books. Sam is almost always allied with Nephi in conflicts with their older brothers, Laman and Lemuel. In the later books of the Book of Mormon, Sam&#x27;s descendants are combined with Nephi&#x27;s descendants and simply called &quot;Nephites.&quot;

==Family==


== Textual descriptions ==
The Book of Mormon presents Sam as a Nephi&#x27;s constant ally against their older brothers, Laman and Lemuel. When the original Lehite colony splits into Nephites and Lamanites, Sam and his family side with the Nephites. In their 1992 article &quot;Seven Tribes, and Aspect of Lehi&#x27;s Legacy,&quot; John L. Sorenson, John A. Tvedtnes, and John W. Welch point out that, while tribes of Nephites, Lamanites, and Lemuelites persist throughout the text, as do Jacobites and Josephites (Lehi&#x27;s younger sons born in the desert), there are never Samites in the Book of Mormon, which Grant Hardy suggests could mean that Sam &quot;only had daughters.&quot;

== Commentary ==
In a 1996 article, Ken Haubrock notes the paucity of information that the Book of Mormon provides about Sam. &quot;We have only the barest sketch of him as a person,&quot; laments Haubrock. &quot;This would not seem out of the ordinary except when we realize that Sam was witness to early Nephite history. Almost every hardship and adventure that Lehi&#x27;s family went through . . . [was] probably also experienced by Sam.&quot; Haubrook also suggests that, by directing that Sam&#x27;s posterity be combined with Nephi&#x27;s, Lehi &quot;implies that Nephi is receiving a double portion--just as his ancestor Joseph did through Ephraim and Manasseh--and that Sam and his decedents are to be the second half of that double portion.&quot;

Sam is the only one of Nephi&#x27;s brothers who partakes of the Tree of Life in Lehi&#x27;s Dream sequence in 1 Nephi 8. Grant Hardy identifies him as &quot;an early believer in Nephi&#x27;s revelations and a close ally.&quot; Brant Gardner refers to him as &quot;Nephi&#x27;s first convert&quot; and argues that Nephi and Sam represent the two gifts of the spirit identified in Doctrine and Covenants 46:13-14: &quot;To some it is given by the Holy Ghost to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world. To others it is given to believe on their words.&quot; In this case, Nephi&#x27;s gift was to receive &quot;direct confirmation&quot; of Lehi&#x27;s vision of the Tree of Life, while Sam&#x27;s gift was to hear and believe Nephi&#x27;s testimony. &quot;Both are gifts of the Spirit, and neither is superior to the other,&quot; Gardner concludes. &quot;Both methods lead to the same end. Both Nephi and Sam remain faithful and follow their father. Sam receives the same blessing as Nephi.&quot;

Writing in &quot;Understanding the Book of Mormon&quot;, Hardy suggests that Nephi flattens all of his brothers into collective characters who either help or hinder his own efforts. &quot;The only time that Laman does anything independently is when he goes to Laban&#x27;s house to ask for the plates,&quot; Hardy writes, &quot;otherwise, he always speaks and acts in conjunction with Lemuel. Lemuel, in turn, never opposes Laman in any way, and never appears without Laman close by.&quot; Similarly, Nephi portrays Sam as &quot;a rather passive ally of Nephi&#x27;s in family dynamics-who is bland to the point of being nearly a nonentity.&quot; Hardy calls this &quot;selective characterization&quot; that Nephi likely uses as a narrative strategy &quot;in order to sharpen the main conflict between himself and Laman and Lemuel.&quot;

== Literary representations ==
In most poetic and novelistic representations of the Book of Mormon, Sam is portrayed as Nephi&#x27;s loyal sidekick with very little personality of his own—much as he is portrayed in the text of the Book of Mormon. However, several Latter-day Saint poets have described Sam in poetry. Mildred Tobler Hunt&#x27;s poem &quot;Sam Speaks,&quot; for example, portrays Sam&#x27;s willingness to leave his beloved city of Jerusalem when his father and brother confirmed that it was God&#x27;s will:

<doc id="633883" wikidata="Q719823" url="?curid=633883" title="Two Weeks Notice">
<text>Two Weeks Notice is a 2002 American romantic comedy film written and directed by Marc Lawrence and starring Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant, with Alicia Witt, Dana Ivey, Robert Klein, and Heather Burns. 

In the film, an idealistic, liberal lawyer (Bullock) goes to work for a narcissistic, billionaire developer (Grant) and they form an unlikely pair.

The film was released in the United States on December 20, 2002, by Warner Bros. Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $199 million worldwide.

== Plot ==

Lucy Kelson is an intelligent, highly competent liberal lawyer who specializes in historic preservation, environmental law, and &quot;pro bono&quot; causes in New York City. George Wade is an arrogant, needy billionaire real estate developer and stylish womanizing playboy, who is also quite naïve. Lucy&#x27;s hard work and devotion to others contrasts sharply with George&#x27;s childish recklessness and greed.

Lucy meets George in an attempt to stop the destruction of the Coney Island community center from her childhood. Learning that she graduated from prestigious Harvard Law School, he asks to hire her to replace his old Chief Counsel, overlooking their opposing views of real estate development. She decides the benefits he offers for discretionary funding for community causes she espouses outweighs the negatives, especially as he promises to protect the community center.

Lucy finds what he really requires is advice in all aspects of his life. She regretfully becomes his indispensable assistant and he calls her for every little thing at all hours. After Lucy is disrupted at a friend&#x27;s wedding by George&#x27;s latest &quot;emergency&quot; (what to wear to an event he is attending), she gives him two weeks&#x27; notice of resignation.

Lucy looks for work at other firms, but George has called in advance asking them not to hire her, so he can keep her on. Eventually, he admits defeat and she offers to help him find a replacement, but unaware of how close and interdependent they have become. They act like an old married couple at a restaurant, able to simultaneously carry out a conversation while involuntarily exchanging food out of habit from knowing each other&#x27;s food preferences.

When potential interviewee June Carver shows up without an appointment seeking the position, Lucy speaks to her, but is concerned she lacks real estate experience. When George sees June, he is immediately attracted and is ready to hire her on the spot, seemingly disregarding Lucy&#x27;s concerns. Lucy becomes increasingly concerned and competitive with her replacement. When George invites June to business events that Lucy would normally go on, she acts increasingly jealous.

Lucy learns that despite George&#x27;s promise, the community center is going to be knocked down and so goes to confront him on his apparent betrayal. Arriving at his hotel, she finds George and June in his suite in lingerie during a game of &quot;strip chess&quot;. George confronts her the next day (her last day) where Lucy reminds him he promised her to spare the community center and storms out.

After Lucy is gone, George realizes his time with her has demonstrated he needs to change. Meanwhile, in her new job, she realizes she misses him. George goes in search of Lucy and reveals he decided to keep his promise to her. She initially rebuffs him but then runs after him and they declare their feelings.

In the DVD version of the film, an unreleased wedding scene of George and Lucy was featured. George and Lucy were married at the community center attended by family and friends.

== Cast ==

In addition, Jason Antoon portrays Norman and Sharon Wilkins plays Polly St. Clair, while Mike Piazza, Donald Trump, and Norah Jones make cameo appearances as themselves.

== Production == 
Director Marc Lawrence suffered headaches, sinus infections, a root canal, and a slipped disc, while making the film. Lawrence previously wrote the films &quot;Forces of Nature&quot; and &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot;, which starred Bullock, and it was on the latter film where he asked her to look at his unfinished script. Bullock liked it enough to star in and produce the film. Grant was first choice for the part, he and Bullock had already wanted to work together. Lawrence hoped the film would be different enough for Grant, not the same as his &quot;Notting Hill&quot; character, but not as unpleasant as his &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; character. Filming took place in New York City, and was noted as the first Hollywood production to take place after the September 11 attacks.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack music to &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; was released on January 28, 2003.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3 out of 4 and wrote: &quot;… some of the dialogue has a real zing to it. There were wicked little one-liners that slipped in under the radar and nudged the audience in the ribs.&quot; Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that it &quot;Knows what it needs to do for both its stars, does it, and doesn&#x27;t make a federal case about it. I&#x27;d watch these two together again in a New York minute.&quot; David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; called it: &quot;An affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer&#x27;s previous collaboration, &quot;Miss Congeniality.&quot;&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; opened at number two domestically, behind &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;, and spent its first five weeks in the Top 10 at the box office. It grossed $93.3million in the United States and Canada, and $105.7million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $199million, against a budget of $60million.

==Punctuation issue==
In the best-selling book on punctuation &quot;Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation&quot;, author Lynne Truss points out that the spelling of the film&#x27;s title is grammatically incorrect because it is missing an apostrophe (Two Weeks&#x27; Notice). The book&#x27;s original hardcover edition featured Truss in her author&#x27;s photo, glaring at the poster and holding a marker where the apostrophe should be.

<doc id="633896" wikidata="Q1332211" url="?curid=633896" title="Flight 19">
<text>Flight 19 was the designation of a group of five General Motors TBF Avenger torpedo bombers that disappeared over the Bermuda Triangle on December 5, 1945, after losing contact during a United States Navy overwater navigation training flight from Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale, Florida. All 14 naval aviators on the flight were lost, as were all 13 crew members of a Martin PBM Mariner flying boat that subsequently launched from Naval Air Station Banana River to search for Flight 19.

A report by Navy investigators concluded that flight leader Lt. Charles C. Taylor mistook small islands offshore for the Florida Keys after his compasses stopped working, resulting in the flight heading over open sea and away from land. The report was later amended by the Navy to read &quot;cause unknown&quot; to avoid blaming Taylor for the loss of five aircraft and 14 men. The report attributed the loss of the PBM search aircraft to an explosion in mid-air while searching for the flight.

== Navigation training flight ==

Flight 19 undertook a routine navigation and combat training exercise in TBM-type aircraft. The assignment was called &quot;Navigation problem No. 1&quot;, a combination of bombing and navigation that other flights had completed or were scheduled to undertake that day. The flight leader, United States Navy Lieutenant Charles Carroll Taylor, had about 2,500 flying hours, mostly in aircraft of this type, while his trainee pilots each had 300 total and 60 flight hours in the Avenger. Taylor had completed a combat tour in the Pacific theater as a torpedo bomber pilot on the aircraft carrier and had recently arrived from NAS Miami where he had also been a VTB (torpedo-bombing plane) instructor. The student pilots had recently completed other training missions in the area where the flight was to take place. They were U.S. Marine Captains Edward Joseph Powers and George William Stivers, U.S. Marine Second Lieutenant Forrest James Gerber and USN Ensign Joseph Tipton Bossi.

The aircraft were three TBM-1Cs (BuNo 45714, &#x27;FT3&#x27;; BuNo 46325, &#x27;FT81&#x27;; BuNo 73209, &#x27;FT117&#x27;), one TBM-1E (BuNo 46094, &#x27;FT36&#x27;); and one TBM-3 (BuNo 23307, &#x27;FT28&#x27;). Each aircraft was a version of the Grumman TBF Avenger, built by General Motors&#x27; Eastern Aircraft Division under wartime production license. Under the U.S. Navy aircraft designation system used during World War II, Grumman-built Avengers were designated TBF and GM-built aircraft such as these were designated TBM. Each was fully fueled, and during pre-flight checks, it was discovered they were all missing clocks. Navigation of the route was intended to teach dead reckoning principles, which involved calculating, among other things, elapsed time. The apparent lack of timekeeping equipment was not a cause for concern, as it was assumed each man had his own watch. Takeoff was scheduled for 13:45 local time, but the late arrival of Taylor delayed departure until 14:10. The weather at NAS Fort Lauderdale was described as &quot;favorable, sea state moderate to rough&quot;.

The exercise involved three legs, with the flight having flown four, the fourth being returning to NAS Ft. Lauderdale after reaching the Florida coast. After take off, they flew on heading 091° (almost due east) for until reaching Hens and Chickens Shoals, commonly called Chicken Rocks, where low level bombing practice was carried out. The flight was to continue on that heading for another before turning onto a course of 346° for , in the process over-flying Grand Bahama island. The next scheduled turn was to a heading of 241° to fly at the end of which the exercise was completed, and the Avengers would turn left to then return to NAS Ft. Lauderdale.

Radio conversations between the pilots were overheard by the base and other aircraft in the area. The practice bombing operation is known to have been carried out because, at about 15:00, a pilot requested and was given permission to drop his last bomb. Forty minutes later, another flight instructor, Lieutenant Robert F. Cox in FT-74, who was forming up with his group of students for the same mission, received an unidentified transmission.

An unidentified crew member asked Powers, one of the students, for his compass reading. Powers replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t know where we are. We must have got lost after that last turn.&quot; Cox then transmitted; &quot;This is FT-74, plane or boat calling &#x27;Powers&#x27; please identify yourself so someone can help you.&quot; The response after a few moments was a request from the others in the flight for suggestions. FT-74 tried again and a man identified as FT-28 (Taylor) came on. &quot;FT-28, this is FT-74, what is your trouble?&quot; &quot;Both of my compasses are out&quot;, Taylor replied, &quot;and I am trying to find Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I am over land but it&#x27;s broken. I am sure I&#x27;m in the Keys but I don&#x27;t know how far down and I don&#x27;t know how to get to Fort Lauderdale.&quot;
FT-74 informed the NAS that aircraft were lost, then advised Taylor to put the sun on his port wing and fly north up the coast to Fort Lauderdale. Base operations then asked if the flight leader&#x27;s aircraft was equipped with a standard YG (IFF transmitter), which could be used to triangulate the flight&#x27;s position, but the message was not acknowledged by FT-28. (Later he would indicate that his transmitter was activated.) Instead, at 16:45, FT-28 radioed: &quot;We are heading 030 degrees for 45 minutes, then we will fly north to make sure we are not over the Gulf of Mexico.&quot; During this time no bearings could be made on the flight, and IFF could not be picked up. Taylor was told to broadcast on 4805 kHz. This order was not acknowledged so he was asked to switch to 3000 kHz, the search and rescue frequency. Taylor replied – &quot;I cannot switch frequencies. I must keep my planes intact.&quot;

At 16:56, Taylor was again asked to turn on his transmitter for YG if he had one. He did not acknowledge but, a few minutes later, advised his flight &quot;Change course to 090 degrees (due east) for 10 minutes.&quot; About the same time, someone in the flight said, &quot;Dammit, if we could just fly west we would get home; head west, dammit.&quot; This difference of opinion later led to questions about why the students did not simply head west on their own. It has been explained that this can be attributed to military discipline. As the weather deteriorated, radio contact became intermittent, and it was believed that the five aircraft by this point were more than out to sea, east of the Florida peninsula. Taylor radioed &quot;We&#x27;ll fly 270 degrees west until landfall or running out of gas&quot; and requested a weather check at 17:24. By 17:50, several land-based radio stations had triangulated Flight 19&#x27;s position as being within a radius of ; Flight 19 was north of the Bahamas and well off the coast of central Florida.

At 18:04, Taylor radioed to his flight &quot;Holding 270. We didn&#x27;t fly far enough east; we may as well just turn around and fly east again&quot;. By that time, the weather had deteriorated even more and the sun had set. Around 18:20, Taylor&#x27;s last message was received. (It has also been reported that Taylor&#x27;s last message was received at 19:04.) He was heard saying, &quot;All planes close up tight ... we&#x27;ll have to ditch unless landfall ... when the first plane drops below 10 gallons [], we all go down together.&quot;

== PBM-5 (Bureau Number 59225) ==
As it became obvious the flight was lost, air bases, aircraft, and merchant ships were alerted. A Consolidated PBY Catalina departed after 18:00 to search for Flight 19 and guide them back if they could be located. After dark, two Martin PBM Mariner flying boats originally scheduled for their own training flights were diverted to perform square pattern searches in the area west of . US Navy Squadron Training No. 49 PBM-5 BuNo 59225 took off at 19:27 from Naval Air Station Banana River (now Patrick Space Force Base), called in a routine radio message at 19:30 and was never heard from again.

At 21:15, the tanker SS &quot;Gaines Mills&quot; reported it had observed flames from an apparent explosion leaping high and burning for 10 minutes, at position . Captain Shonna Stanley reported unsuccessfully searching for survivors through a pool of oil and aviation gasoline. The escort carrier also reported losing radar contact with an aircraft at the same position and time.

The PBM could hold 9.83 tonnes of aviation gasoline. Its flexible fuel lines had a noted tendency to get loose in rough conditions, and leak gasoline. The most likely conclusion is that the PBM had a mid-air explosion.

== Investigation ==
A 500-page Navy board of investigation report published a few months later made several observations:

*Flight leader Lt. Charles C. Taylor had mistakenly believed that the small islands he passed over were the Florida Keys, that his flight was over the Gulf of Mexico, and that heading northeast would take them to Florida. It was determined that Taylor had passed over the Bahamas as scheduled, and he did, in fact, lead his flight to the northeast over the Atlantic. The report noted that some subordinate officers did likely know their approximate position, as indicated by radio transmissions stating that flying west would result in reaching the mainland.
*As noted in the report, Taylor refused to change the radio training frequency to the search and rescue radio frequency. (The training frequency was difficult to use because of interference from Cuban radio stations and also a radio carrier wave.)
*Taylor was not at fault because the compasses stopped working.
*The loss of PBM-5 BuNo 59225 was attributed to an explosion.

This report was subsequently amended &quot;cause unknown&quot; by the Navy after Taylor&#x27;s mother contended that the Navy was unfairly blaming her son for the loss of 5 aircraft and 14 men, when the Navy had neither the bodies nor the airplanes as evidence.

Had Flight 19 actually been where Taylor believed it to be, the flight would have made landfall with the Florida coastline within 20 minutes, depending on how far down they were. However, a later reconstruction of the incident showed that the islands visible to Taylor were probably the Bahamas, well northeast of the Keys, and that Flight 19 was exactly where it should have been. The board of investigation found that because of his belief that he was on a base course toward Florida, Taylor actually guided the flight farther northeast and out to sea. Further, it was general knowledge at NAS Fort Lauderdale that, if a pilot ever became lost in the area, to fly a heading of 270° (due west). Likewise, a rule of thumb was that any pilot who got lost going south would simply turn his plane around with the sun on his port side [left] and then follow the Florida coast heading north. By the time the flight actually turned west, they were likely so far out to sea that they had already passed their aircraft&#x27;s fuel endurance. This factor, combined with bad weather and the ditching characteristics of the Avenger, meant that there was little hope of rescue, even if they had managed to stay afloat.

It is possible that Taylor overshot Gorda Cay and instead reached another land mass in the southern Abaco Islands. He then proceeded northwest as planned, where he fully expected to find the Grand Bahama Island lying in front of him. Instead, he eventually saw a land mass to his right side, the northern part of Abaco Island. Believing that this landmass to his right was Grand Bahama Island and his compass was malfunctioning, he set a course to what he thought was southwest to head straight back to Fort Lauderdale. However, in reality this changed his course farther northwest, toward open ocean.

To further add to his confusion, he encountered a series of islands north of Abaco Island, which look very similar to the Key West Islands. The control tower then suggested that Taylor&#x27;s team should fly west, which would have taken them to the landmass of Florida eventually. Taylor headed for what he thought was west, but in reality it was northwest, almost parallel to Florida.

After trying that for a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was impossible for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious conversations between Taylor, his other aircrew and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near the Bahamas or Key West, and he was not sure which direction he faced because of a compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of the aircrew believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should have taken them to Florida if they were in the Bahamas. If Taylor had stayed on this course, he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point, Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.

== Avenger wreckage mistaken for Flight 19 and other searches ==
In 1986, the wreckage of an Avenger was found off the Florida coast during the search for the wreckage of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;. Aviation archaeologist Jon Myhre raised this wreck from the ocean floor in 1990. He mistakenly believed that it was one of the missing planes.

In 1991, a treasure-hunting expedition led by Graham Hawkes announced that the wreckage of five Avengers had been discovered off the coast of Florida, but their tail numbers revealed they were not Flight 19. In 2004, a BBC documentary showed Hawkes returning with a new submersible 12 years later and identifying one of the planes by its bureau number (a clearly readable 23990) as a flight lost at sea on October 9, 1943, over two years before Flight 19 (its crew all survived), but he was unable to definitively identify the other planes; the documentary concluded that &quot;Despite the odds, they are just a random collection of accidents that came to rest in the same place from home.&quot;

In March 2012, Hawkes was reported as saying it had suited both him (and indirectly his investors) and the Pentagon to make the story go away because it was an expensive and time-consuming distraction, and that, while admitting he had found no conclusive evidence, a statistician he consulted said it was Flight 19.

Records showed that training accidents between 1942 and 1945 accounted for the loss of 95 aviation personnel from NAS Fort Lauderdale. In 1992, another expedition located scattered debris on the ocean floor, but nothing could be identified. In the 2000s, searchers expanded their search area farther east, into the Atlantic Ocean, but the remains of Flight 19 have still not been confirmed found.

A 2015 newspaper report claimed a wrecked World War II era warplane with Navy markings and two bodies still inside was retrieved by the Navy in the mid-1960s after being discovered by a hunter in the woods near Sebastian, Florida. The Navy initially said it was from Flight 19 but later recanted its statement. Despite Freedom of Information Act requests for details in 2013, the names are still not known because the Navy does not have enough information to identify the bodies.

A wrecked plane found in the Everglades in Broward County was also, incorrectly, postulated to be from Flight 19. In fact this TBN-3E crashed March 16, 1947. The crash reportedly occurred because its pilot, Ensign Ralph N. Wachob, developed vertigo. Wachob was killed in the crash.

As of the 2020s, no trace of the five TBM Avengers or the PBM Mariner and the 27 missing aviators have been found. The most likely conclusion is that the Avengers ran out of gas and ditched at sea, and the PBM experienced a mid-air explosion.

== In fiction ==
Flight 19 is featured in the 1977 science-fiction film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. In the film&#x27;s opening, the aircraft are discovered in the Sonoran Desert, in pristine condition with full fuel tanks, one of several mysterious events that imply extraterrestrial activity. In the film&#x27;s ending scene, the crew returns to Earth from the alien mothership, seemingly the same age as at their disappearance.

Flight 19 made an appearance in the 2006 direct-to-DVD movie &quot;Scooby-Doo! Pirates Ahoy!&quot;

<doc id="633899" wikidata="Q270524" url="?curid=633899" title="Parenchyma">
<text>Parenchyma () is the bulk of functional substance in an animal organ or structure such as a tumour. In zoology, it is the tissue that fills the interior of flatworms. In botany, it is some layers in the cross-section of the leaf.

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;parenchyma&quot; is Neo-Latin from the Ancient Greek word meaning &#x27;visceral flesh&#x27;, and from meaning &#x27;to pour in&#x27; from &#x27;beside&#x27; + &#x27;in&#x27; + &#x27;to pour&#x27;.

Originally, Erasistratus and other anatomists used it for certain human tissues. Later, it was also applied to plant tissues by Nehemiah Grew.

== Structure ==

The parenchyma is the &quot;functional&quot; parts of an organ, or of a structure such as a tumour in the body. This is in contrast to the stroma, which refers to the &quot;structural&quot; tissue of organs or of structures, namely, the connective tissues.

=== Brain ===

The brain parenchyma refers to the functional tissue in the brain that is made up of the two types of brain cell, neurons and glial cells. It is also known to contain collagen proteins. Damage or trauma to the brain parenchyma often results in a loss of cognitive ability or even death. Bleeding into the parenchyma is known as intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

=== Lungs ===

Lung parenchyma is the substance of the lung that is involved with gas exchange and includes the pulmonary alveoli.

=== Liver ===

The liver parenchyma is the functional tissue of the organ made up of around 80% of the liver volume as hepatocytes. The other main type of liver cells are non-parenchymal. Non-parenchymal cells constitute 40% of the total number of liver cells but only 6.5% of its volume.

=== Kidneys ===

The renal parenchyma is divided into two major structures: the outer renal cortex and the inner renal medulla. Grossly, these structures take the shape of 7 to 18 cone-shaped renal lobes, each containing renal cortex surrounding a portion of medulla called a renal pyramid.

=== Tumors ===

The tumor parenchyma, of a solid tumour, is one of the two distinct compartments in a solid tumour. The parenchyma is made up of neoplastic cells. The other compartment is the stroma induced by the neoplastic cells, needed for nutritional support and waste removal. In many types of tumour, clusters of parenchymal cells are separated by a basal lamina that can sometimes be incomplete.

== Flatworms ==

Parenchyma is the tissue made up of cells and intercellular spaces that fills the interior of the body of a flatworm, which is an acoelomate. This is a spongy tissue also known as a mesenchymal tissue, in which several types of cells are lodged in their extracellular matrices. The parenchymal cells include myocytes, and many types of specialised cells. The cells are often attached to each other and also to their nearby epithelial cells mainly by gap junctions and hemidesmosomes. There is much variation in the types of cell in the parenchyma according to the species and anatomical regions. Its possible functions may include skeletal support, nutrient storage, movement, and many others.

<text>A ghost ship, also known as a phantom ship, is a vessel with no living crew aboard; it may be a fictional ghostly vessel, such as the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;, or a physical derelict found adrift with its crew missing or dead, like the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;. The term is sometimes used for ships that have been decommissioned but not yet scrapped, as well as drifting boats that have been found after breaking loose of their ropes and being carried away by the wind or the waves.

More recently, ships which travel with their mandated Automatic identification system turned off to avoid detection and monitoring, have also been referred to as &quot;ghost ships&quot;.

==Chronology==
===Folklore, legends, and mythology===
* Undated – &quot;Chasse-galerie&quot; is a haunted canoe doomed to paddle the skies of Quebec.
* Undated – The &quot;Caleuche&quot; is a mythical ghost ship that, according to local folklore and Chilote mythology, sails the seas around Chiloé Island, Chile at night.
* Undated – The Fireship of Baie des Chaleurs is a form of ghost light, an unusual visual phenomenon that appears at Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada. The phenomenon has been the source of many a tall tale, and has been said to appear as a flaming three-mast galley much like the style of ship featured on New Brunswick&#x27;s provincial flag.
* 1748 onwards – The &quot;Lady Lovibond&quot; is said to have been deliberately wrecked on 13 February 1748 off Goodwin Sands, Kent, England, and to reappear off the Kent coast every fifty years.
* 18th century onwards – The Ghost Ship of Northumberland Strait is the apparition of a burning ship that is regularly reported between Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, Canada.
* 1795 onwards – The &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; is said to be a ship commanded by a captain condemned to eternally sail the seas. It has long been the principal ghost ship legend among mariners and has inspired several works.
* 19th century onwards – The &quot;Princess Augusta&quot;, misremembered in local folklore as the &quot;Palatine&quot;, was wrecked near Block Island, Rhode Island, U.S., in 1738. Since then, an apparition known as the Palatine Light has been reported.
* 1813 onwards – After the American schooner &quot;Young Teazer&quot; was sunk in an explosion in Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada during the War of 1812, a burning apparition known as the &quot;Teazer Light&quot; has been reported.
* 1858 onwards – The &quot;Eliza Battle&quot; was a paddle steamer that burned in 1858 on the Tombigbee River, Alabama, U.S. She is reported to reappear, fully aflame, on cold and windy winter nights to foretell of impending disaster.
* 1872 or 1882 – A legend states that the &quot;Iron Mountain&quot; mysteriously disappeared in 1872 and left barges it was towing floating down the river. In reality, the ship ran aground and sank north of Vicksburg, Mississippi, United States in 1882 and its destruction was never mysterious.
* 1878 onwards – An apparition of HMS &quot;Eurydice&quot; has been reported where the ship sank in 1878 off the Isle of Wight, English Channel. Witnesses include a Royal Navy submarine in the 1930s and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, in 1998.
* 1886 – The Phantom Canoe of Lake Rotomahana was a &quot;waka wairua&quot; (spirit canoe) in Lake Rotomahana, New Zealand seen eleven days before the deadly eruption of the nearby Mount Tarawera, which devastated the lake and the surrounding area.
* 1895 – A spectral Galleon was allegedly seen in Chapel Cove, Newfoundland. According to folklore, pirates supposedly buried riches in Chapel Cove, and it is said that those who have gone in search of the treasure have either observed the appearance of the phantom ship, or have encountered apparitions on land.
* 1902 – The vanished on Lake Superior on November 21, 1902, and subsequently gained a reputation as &quot;the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; of the Great Lakes.&quot;
* 1906 – Following the wreck of the in 1906 off the coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, there were reports of a lifeboat with eight skeletons in a nearby sea cave, lifeboats being rowed by skeletons of the Valencia&#x27;s victims, the shape of &quot;Valencia&quot; within the black exhaust emanating from the rescue ship &quot;City of Topeka&#x27;s&quot; funnel and a phantom ship resembling the &quot;Valencia&quot; with waves washing over her as human figures held on to the ship&#x27;s rigging; sailors also reported seeing the ship itself in the area in the years following the sinking, often as an apparition that followed down the coast. One of the lifeboats from &quot;Valencia&quot; was found adrift in 1933.
* 22 November 1912 – The &quot;Rouse Simmons,&quot; heavily laden with over 3,000 Christmas trees in its cargo hold and piled high on deck, set sail from Thompson, Michigan for Chicago. The following day it disappeared without trace. For years afterwards, Lake Michigan mariners claimed to have spotted the &#x27;Christmas Tree Ship&#x27; appearing out of nowhere with its sails in tatters.
* 1928 – The &quot;København&quot; was last heard from on December 28, 1928. For two years following its disappearance sightings of a mysterious five-masted ship fitting its description were reported in the Pacific Ocean.

===Unsubstantiated===
* 1775 – The &quot;Octavius&quot;, a British merchant ship returning from China, was supposedly found drifting off the coast of Greenland. The captain&#x27;s log showed that the ship had attempted the Northwest Passage, which at the time had never been successfully traversed. The ship and the bodies of her frozen crew apparently completed the passage after drifting amongst the pack ice for 13 years.
* 1811–1813 – Napoléon Gallois reported that a French frigate had found the French privateer &quot;Duc de Dantzig&quot; drifting, covered in blood, with the decaying corpses of the crew hacked and crucified to her masts and in the battery. Bloody papers identified &quot;Duc de Dantzig&quot; and her master, François Aregnaudeau. More soberly, the ships register of the maritime archives states &quot;&quot;Duc de Dantzig&quot;, unheard of as of 1813, presumed lost with all hands&quot;.
* 1840 – The schooner &quot;Jenny&quot; was supposedly discovered after spending 17 years frozen in an ice-barrier of the Drake Passage. Found by Captain Brighton of the whaler &quot;Hope&quot;, it had been locked in the ice since 1823, the last port of call having been Lima, Peru. The bodies of the seven people aboard, including one woman and a dog, preserved by the Antarctic cold, were buried at sea by the crew of the &quot;Hope&quot;, and Brighton passed the account on to the Admiralty in London. The &quot;Jenny&quot; is commemorated by the Jenny Buttress, a feature on King George Island near Melville Peak, named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1960.
* 27 October 1913 – The Singapore newspaper &quot;The Straits Times&quot; published a story according to which the &quot;Marlborough&quot; had been discovered near Cape Horn with the skeletons of her crew on board. &quot;The Straits Times&quot; attributed the story to one published in the London paper the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; of 3 October 1913. The &quot;Evening Standard&quot; mentioned that the story was based on an &quot;account cabled from New Zealand&quot; which was yet to be confirmed. The ship that sighted the &quot;Marlborough&quot; in 1913 was said to be the sailing ship &quot;Johnson&quot;.
* 1947 – The &quot;Ourang Medan&quot; is said to have been found adrift off Indonesia with all of its crew dead. The boarding party found the entire crew &quot;frozen, teeth baring, gaping at the sun.&quot; Before the ship could be towed to a home port, it exploded and sank. There is no record that a ship of this name ever existed, and it is believed to be an urban legend.
* 2014 – At least 243 refugees disappeared without a trace in the summer of 2014. A human trafficker who arranged a journey to Europe for the refugees claimed that the people were scheduled to depart from Khums, Libya, but the ship that they would have departed on was never named and no sign of a ship or the refugees has even been found. This incident is known as the ghost boat investigation.

===Historically attested===
* 1750 or 1760 – The SV &quot;Sea Bird&quot;: This merchant brig, under the command of John Huxham (or Husham or Durham), grounded herself at Easton&#x27;s Beach, Rhode Island. Her longboat was missing. She had been returning from a voyage to Honduras and was expected in Newport that day. The ship was apparently abandoned in sight of land (coffee was boiling on the galley stove) and drifted off course. The only living creatures found on the ship were a dog and a cat. A fictional account of how she became derelict appeared in the Wilmington, Delaware newspaper &quot;Sunday Morning Star&quot; for 11 October 1885.
* 15 May 1854 – was a barque-rigged ship of the British Royal Navy that was abandoned after being beset by ice in Viscount Melville Sound, Canada. She had been one of four vessels from Edward Belcher&#x27;s search expedition for John Franklin. The ship drifted some before it was found on 10 September 1855 off the coast of Baffin Island, Canada, freed from the ice. The Resolute desk, which was constructed from the timbers of the ship, resides today in the Oval Office of the White House.
* 25 November 1872 – The SV &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;, after passing Santa Maria Island in the Azores on 25 November 1872 (the last entry on the ship&#x27;s slate). The merchant brigantine became derelict in unknown circumstances. No boats were found on board. She was found on 4 December 1872 between mainland Portugal and the Azores archipelago. The ship was devoid of all crew, but largely intact and under sail, heading toward the Strait of Gibraltar. Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s story &quot;J. Habakuk Jephson&#x27;s Statement&quot; is based on this incident. Doyle alters certain aspects of the original story, including the name of the ship from &quot;Mary&quot; to &quot;Marie Celeste&quot;.
* 29 August 1884 – The SV &quot;Resolven&quot;: This merchant brig was found abandoned between Baccalieu Island and Catalina, Newfoundland and Labrador. Her boats were missing. Her logbook was posted to within six hours of being sighted. Other than a broken yard, she had suffered minimal damage. The galley fire was alight and the lamps were burning. A large iceberg was sighted nearby. It has been claimed that none of the seven crew members or four passengers were accustomed to northern waters and it was suggested that they panicked when the ship was damaged by ice, launched the lifeboat, and swamped, though no bodies were found. Three years later, &quot;Resolven&quot; was wrecked while returning to Newfoundland from Nova Scotia with a load of lumber.
* 1885 – The SV &quot;The Twenty One Friends&quot;: This three-masted (tern) schooner was built in 1872. She was financed by a group of 21 Philadelphia Quakers and consequently named the &quot;Twenty One Friends&quot;. In 1885, returning to Philadelphia with a full load of lumber from Brunswick, Georgia, the ship was rammed by the &quot;John D. May&quot; off the coast of Cape Hatteras. Capt. Jeffries removed his crew and abandoned the vessel. The ship and cargo were left to the mercy of the sea. Capt. Jeffries’ concern for the safety of his crew was appropriate; however, the Gaskill-made ship proved herself to be more seaworthy than expected. After the collision, the ship was sighted on both sides of the Atlantic over the next two years. She finally came ashore in Ireland, where her cargo was salvaged and she was employed as a fishing vessel.
* 1897 – The abandoned whaler &quot;Young Phoenix&quot; was reported to have been drifting in the Arctic.
* 22 January 1906 – The SS &quot;Valencia&quot;&#x27;s lifeboat no. 5: The lifeboat went adrift when the ship sank off the coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. The lifeboat was found floating in Barkley Sound, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada in remarkably good condition 27 years after the sinking.
* October 1917 – The SV &quot;Zebrina&quot;: This sailing barge departed Falmouth, Cornwall, England with a cargo of Swansea coal bound for Saint-Brieuc, France. Two days later she was discovered aground on Rozel Point, south of Cherbourg, France, without damage except for some disarrangement of her rigging, but with her crew missing.
* January 1921 – The SV &quot;Carroll A. Deering&quot;: After passing Cape Lookout Lightship, North Carolina, on 28 January 1921, the &quot;Carroll A. Deering&quot;, a five-masted cargo schooner, became derelict in unknown circumstances. The ship&#x27;s lifeboats and logbook were missing when she was found on 31 January 1921 at the Diamond Shoals, off the coast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The final voyage of the ship has been the subject of much debate and controversy, and was investigated by six departments of the US government, largely because it was one of dozens of ships that sank or went missing within a relatively short period of time. While paranormal explanations have been advanced, the theories of mutiny or piracy are considered more likely.
* 3 October 1923 – The SV &quot;Governor Parr&quot;: This four masted schooner was abandoned by her crew after she lost her mizzen and spanker in a storm while sailing from Ingramport, Nova Scotia, Canada to Buenos Aires, Argentina. The damage incurred by &quot;Governor Parr&quot; was significant to the masts and deck of the ship; however, she did not sink. Several attempts were made to either destroy or tow this derelict to shore, but all failed. &quot;Governor Parr&quot; was sighted for many years after her abandonment as she covered large spans of the Atlantic Ocean. She remained a derelict and “menace to navigation”, drifting as far as the Canary Islands. It is unknown what happened to her in the end.
* 24 November 1931 – The &quot;SS Baychimo&quot;: This cargo steamer was abandoned after being trapped in pack ice near Barrow, Alaska, U.S. and being thought doomed to sink. However, she remained afloat and was sighted at various times between 1931 and 1969 in the Chukchi Sea off the northwestern Alaskan coast without ever being salvaged. ´She was sighted numerous times, still unmanned and adrift, for nearly forty years. People managed to board her several times, but each time they were either unequipped to salvage her or were driven away by bad weather. This would make her one of the longest sailing ghost ships in the world.
* 3 October 1955 – The : After leaving Apia, Samoa, the refrigerated trading and fishing charter boat &quot;Joyita&quot; became derelict in unknown circumstances. The ship&#x27;s dinghy and three Carley-liferafts were missing, and her logbook was also missing, when she was found on 10 November 1955, north of Vanua Levu, Fiji. A subsequent inquiry found the vessel was in a poor state of repair, but determined the fate of passengers and crew to be &quot;inexplicable on the evidence submitted at the inquiry&quot;.
* 1959 – The Royal Navy submarine HMS &quot;Virulent&quot;, lent to the Hellenic Navy in 1946, was found empty in the Bay of Biscay off northern Spain. It subsequently became clear that she had been under tow by another vessel and that the chain had snapped, some three weeks earlier.
* 1 July 1969 – The SV &quot;Teignmouth Electron&quot;: After the last entry in her log was made on 1 July 1969, the trimaran yacht became derelict in unknown circumstances. The vessel was found on 10 July 1969 in the North Atlantic, latitude 33 degrees 11 minutes North and longitude 40 degrees 26 minutes West. Investigation led to the conclusion that its sole crewmember, Donald Crowhurst, had suffered a mental breakdown while competing in a solo around-the-world race and committed suicide by jumping overboard.
* 1975 – The SV &quot;Ocean Wave:&quot; Bas Jan Ader was lost at sea while attempting a single-handed west–east crossing of the Atlantic in a pocket cruiser, a modified Guppy 13 named &quot;Ocean Wave&quot;. The passage was part of an art performance titled &quot;In Search of the Miraculous&quot;. Radio contact broke off 3 weeks into the voyage, and Ader was presumed lost at sea. The boat was found after 10 months, floating partially submerged west-southwest of the coast of Ireland. His body was never found. The boat, after being recovered by the Spanish fishing vessel that found it, was taken to Coruña. The boat was later stolen. Ader&#x27;s mother wrote the poem &quot;From the deep waters of sleep&quot; after having what she described as a premonition of his death.
* December 2002 – The MV &quot;High Aim 6&quot;, after the owner last spoke to the captain by radio when the ship was near the Marshall Islands, halfway between Papua New Guinea and Hawaii, on 13 December 2002, the MV &quot;High Aim 6&quot;, a longline fishing boat, became derelict in unknown circumstances. The Taiwanese police deemed a mutiny probable. The ship was found drifting with its crew missing on 3 January 2003 approximately east of Rowley Shoals, Broome, Australia. The derelict was subsequently scuttled.
* 24 March 2006 – The MT &quot;Jian Seng&quot; was found drifting southwest of Weipa, Queensland, Australia. The ship&#x27;s origin or owner could not be determined, and its engines had been inoperable for some time.
* 24 August 2006 – The SV &quot;Bel Amica&quot;, a classic schooner, was found derelict near Punta Volpe, Sardinia, Italy. The owner later claimed to have gone home on 14 August 2006 to address an emergency. The Italian press suggested that he may have been avoiding taxation of luxury vessels. The Coast Guard crew that discovered the ship found half eaten Egyptian meals, French maps of North African seas, and a flag of Luxembourg on board.
* 18 April 2007 – The SV &quot;Kaz II&quot;, a catamaran set sail on 15 April 2007. She was filmed passing George Point, Hinchinbrook Island, Queensland later that day and on that same day, late in the afternoon, the GPS data showed her to be adrift. She was found adrift on 18 April 2007 near the Great Barrier Reef, off Townsville, Queensland, Australia. When boarded on 20 April, the engine was running, a laptop was running, the radio and GPS were working and a meal was set to eat, but the three-man crew were not on board. All the sails were up but one was badly shredded, while three life jackets and survival equipment, including an emergency beacon, were found on board. A search for the crew was abandoned on 22 April as it was considered unlikely that anyone could have survived for that period of time. The coroner believed that the men may have fallen overboard.
* 28 October 2008 – The MV &quot;Tai Ching 21&quot; (): The last radio transmission from the &quot;Tai Ching 21&quot;, a fishing vessel, was made on 28 October 2008. The boat was found empty on 9 November 2008 near Kiribati. Its lifeboat and three life rafts were missing. The abandoned 50 ton Taiwanese vessel had been gutted by fire several days previously. No mayday call was received. A search of of the Pacific Ocean north of Fiji by a US Air Force C-130 Hercules and a New Zealand Air Force P-3 Orion found no trace of the Taiwanese captain (顏金港 Yán Jīn-gǎng) or crew (18 Chinese, 6 Indonesians, and 4 Filipinos).
* January 2009 – The SV &quot;Lunatic&quot;: In December 2007 at age 70, Jure Šterk started a journey to sail around the world on his boat &quot;Lunatic&quot;. He used his amateur radio to communicate, and was last heard from on 1 January 2009. His sail boat &quot;Lunatic&quot; was spotted on 26 January, approximately off the coast of Australia. The boat appeared damaged and there was no sign of Jure Šterk on deck. Three months later, on 30 April 2009 the sail boat was found adrift by the crew of the science vessel &quot;RV Roger Revelle&quot;, south-east at 32° 18.0&#x27; S 091° 07.0&#x27; E. The sails were torn and there was no one on board. After boarding they found that the last log entry had been made on 2 January 2009.
* 20 March 2012 – The MV &quot;Ryou-Un Maru&quot;, a fishing vessel, was washed away from its mooring in Aomori Prefecture, Japan during the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. It was assumed sunk with no crew aboard, but a year later, it was found drifting about off the coast of Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, Canada. The United States Coast Guard sank it with 25 mm cannon fire on 5 April 2012.
* 19–20 June 2012 – The &quot;T.T. Zion&quot;, a private yacht, was grounded on Fort Lauderdale Beach around 1:15 a.m. on 20 June, with its navigation lights on and engines still running. The vessel appeared sea worthy but a broken tie-bar could have caused steering problems. Items belonging to owner Guma Aguiar were found on board, but no sign of him or any other passenger was found.
* February 2013 – The , a former Soviet cruise ship, was being towed to a scrapyard in the Caribbean when a cable snapped, setting her adrift in international waters, one day after leaving St John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, Canada. On 4 February 2013 she was found approximately east of St John&#x27;s (approximately outside Canada&#x27;s territorial waters) and drifting in a northeasterly direction. The crew did not pursue the vessel due to safety concerns. Some news reports claimed it was adrift and populated with &quot;cannibal rats&quot;.
* 2011–ongoing – Every year the remains of dozens of ghost ships reach Japanese waters; the ships are typically ill-equipped small wooden boats believed to be fishing for North Korea. Some boats were found empty but at least 25 people have been found in advanced states of decomposition, probably dead from starvation or exposure. At least some of the crude fishing vessels are believed to been owned and operated by the Korean People&#x27;s Army.
* 31 January 2016 – The &quot;Sayo&quot;: Manfred Fritz Bajorat of Germany was found dead in his private yacht, which was adrift in the Philippine Sea. His mummified body was found slumped on a desk by crew from the racing yacht &quot;LMAX Exchange&quot;. The yacht was re-discovered on 25 February 2016. An autopsy found Bajorat had died of a heart attack approximately one week before being found, and sea conditions preserved the body.
* February 2020 – The ran aground near Ballycotton, County Cork on the coast of Ireland during Storm Dennis. It had previously been encountered adrift and unmanned in the mid-Atlantic by HMS &quot;Protector&quot;, having been adrift since 2018 after it became disabled, and an operation by the US Coast Guard rescued its crew.
* January 2021 – The &quot;Yong Yu Sing No. 18&quot; was discovered adrift near Midway Island with all crew and a lifeboat missing, 
* April 2024 – Fishermen found an unnamed fishing ship on the Caeté River in the region of Bragança, Pará, Brazil, near the Amazon Delta, presumably having come from Mauritania. Speculated destination to the Canary Islands. The ship probably got lost at sea went adrift of the South Equatorial Current. Its last sighting at Mauritania was in January 2024, so presumably the voyage lasted for 3 months. All of the 9 occupants were found dead. Ship register showed the journey started with 25 occupants. Coroners stated their cause of death was dehydration and inanition. It is speculated that the first 16 dead people were thrown at sea by the last ones who endured, being found dead ashore.

<text>Operation Moses (, &quot;Mivtza Moshe&quot;) was the covert evacuation of Ethiopian Jews (known as the &quot;Beta Israel&quot; community or the derogatory &quot;Falashas&quot;) from Sudan during a civil war that caused a famine in 1984. Originally called &quot;Gur Aryeh Yehuda&quot; (&quot;Cub of the Lion of Judah&quot;) by Israelis, the United Jewish Appeal changed the name to &quot;Operation Moses&quot;.

==History==
The operation, named after the biblical figure Moses, was a cooperative effort between the Israel Defense Forces, the Central Intelligence Agency, the United States embassy in Khartoum, mercenaries, and Sudanese state security forces. Years after the operation completed, it was revealed that Sudanese Muslims and the secret police of Sudan also played a role in facilitating the mass migration of Ethiopian Jews out of Sudan. Operation Moses was the brainchild of then Associate U.S. Coordinator for Refugee Affairs, Richard Krieger. After receiving accounts of the persecution of Ethiopian Jews in the refugee camps, Krieger came up with the idea of an airlift and met with Mossad and Sudanese representatives to facilitate the Operation.

After a secret Israeli cabinet meeting in November 1984, the decision was made to go forward with Operation Moses. Beginning November 21, 1984, it involved the air transport by Trans European Airways of some 8,000 Ethiopian Jews from Sudan via Brussels to Israel, ending January 5, 1985.

Over those seven weeks, over 30 flights brought about 200 Ethiopian Jews at a time to Israel. Trans European Airways had flown out of Sudan previously with Muslims making the pilgrimage to Mecca, so using TEA was a logical solution for this semi-covert operation because it would not provoke questions from the airport authorities. Before this operation, there were approximately as few as 250 Ethiopian immigrants in Israel. Thousands of Beta Israel had fled Ethiopia on foot for refugee camps in Sudan, a journey which usually took anywhere from two weeks to a month. It is estimated as many as 4,000 died during the trek, due to violence and illness along the way. Sudan secretly allowed Israel to evacuate the refugees. Two days after the airlifts began, Jewish journalists wrote about “the mass rescue of thousands of Ethiopian Jews.”

Operation Moses ended on Friday, January 5, 1985, after Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres held a press conference confirming the airlift while asking people not to talk about it. Sudan killed the airlift moments after Peres stopped speaking, ending it prematurely as the news began to reach their Arab allies. Once the story broke in the media, Arab countries pressured Sudan to stop the airlift. Although thousands made it successfully to Israel, many children died in the camps or during the flight to Israel, and it was reported that their parents brought their bodies down from the aircraft with them. Some 1,000 Ethiopian Jews were left behind, approximately 500 of whom were evacuated later in the U.S.-led Operation Joshua. More than 1,000 so-called &quot;orphans of circumstance&quot; existed in Israel, children separated from their families still in Africa, until five years later Operation Solomon took 14,324 more Jews to Israel in 1991. Operation Solomon in 1991 cost Israel $26 million to pay off the dictator-led government, while Operation Moses had been the least expensive of all rescue operations undertaken by Israel to aid Jews in other countries.

==Operation Dove Wing 2010; 2015–2022==
On 14 November 2010, the Israeli cabinet approved a plan to allow an additional 8,000 Falash Mura to immigrate to Israel.

In 2015 it was reported the number of Jews in Ethiopia was 4,000.

On November 16, 2015, the Israeli cabinet unanimously voted in favor of allowing the last group of Falash Mura to immigrate over the next five years, but their acceptance would be conditional on a successful Jewish conversion process, according to the Interior Ministry. In April 2016, they announced that a total of 10,300 people would be included in the latest round of Aliyah, over the following 5 years.

On March 11, 2021, 300 Ethiopian Jews went to Israel–the last of 2,000 Jews from Operation Tzur Israel which began in December 2020.

In 2021, the estimated number of Jews remaining in Ethiopia was about 100.

On 2 February 2022 the Israeli Supreme Court suspended Aliyah from Ethiopia.

On 1 June 2022 180 Jews from Ethiopia made Aliyah to Israel as part of Operation Zur Israel to reunite 3,000 Jews in Ethiopia with their brethren in Israel.

As of 14 June 2022 500 Jews from Ethiopia made Aliyah to Israel.

==Cultural references==
This operation was the subject of an Israeli-French film titled &quot;Live and Become&quot;, directed by Romanian-born Radu Mihăileanu. The film centers on an Ethiopian child whose Christian mother passes him as a Jew so he can immigrate to Israel along with the Jews in order to escape the famine that is looming in Ethiopia. The film went on to win the 2005 award for Best Film at the Copenhagen International Film Festival.

In the book &quot;World War Z&quot; by Max Brooks, the evacuation of African Jews to Israel in response to the outbreak of the titular epidemic is referred to as Operation Moses II.

The film &quot;The Red Sea Diving Resort&quot; is loosely based on the events of Operation Moses and Operation Joshua.

<text>Lillian Roxon (8 February 1932 – 10 August 1973) was an Australian music journalist and author, best known for &quot;Lillian Roxon&#x27;s Rock Encyclopedia&quot; (1969).

==Early life==
Roxon was born Lillian Ropschitz in Alassio, Province of Savona, Italy. Her family, originally from Lwów in Ukraine, then Poland, moved to the coastal town of Alassio in Italy.

As the Ropschitz family were Jewish, they migrated to Australia in 1937 to escape the rise of fascism, and settled in Brisbane. Shortly after their arrival, the family anglicised their names; the surname Roxon was Lillian&#x27;s suggestion.

Roxon studied at the University of Queensland, where she met and had a brief affair with Zell Rabin, who gave Lillian her first job in the United States and who became a key associate of media magnate Rupert Murdoch in the early 1960s. She pursued further studies at the University of Sydney from 1949, where she developed an affinity for the cultural movement known as the Sydney Push, then congregating at the Lincoln Inn.

In the process, Roxon attracted the attention of an Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) operative and was identified in June 1951 as a communist sympathiser. She began her career in newspapers in Sydney and for several years worked for the tabloid magazine &quot;Weekend&quot;, owned by newspaper magnate Sir Frank Packer and edited by journalist and author Donald Horne.

In 1959, Roxon moved permanently to New York City, becoming the first Australian female overseas correspondent and the first Australian journalist to establish a high profile in the U.S. From 1962 onward, she was the New York correspondent for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and over the next ten years she carved out a career reporting on arts, entertainment and women&#x27;s issues for the Australian, American and British press.

==Career==
In the mid-1960s, Roxon became fascinated by pop music and the rise of groups like the Beatles, the Byrds and the Rolling Stones and she began to write regular articles on the subject. In early 1967, she visited San Francisco and was one of the first mainstream journalists to write about the nascent hippie movement, filing a landmark story for &quot;The Herald&quot; on the subject. She also contributed to &quot;Oz&quot; magazine along with the short lived &quot;Eye&quot; magazine in the late 1960s.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Roxon became close friends with critic and rock manager Danny Fields, &quot;Village Voice&quot; journalist Blair Sabol, musician and writer Lenny Kaye (later the guitarist in Patti Smith&#x27;s band and compiler of the original &quot;&quot; LP), music journalist Lisa Robinson, photographers Linda McCartney and Leee Black Childers and Australian academic, author and feminist Germaine Greer.

In 1965, Roxon was joined by &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&#x27;s&quot; autocratic foreign correspondent Margaret Jones. It was a clash of two unbending personalities which her biographer Robert Milliken described as &quot;like two sopranos sharing the same stage&quot;. Perhaps to keep these two apart, Margaret was posted to Washington the following year.

Linda McCartney (then Linda Eastman) was one of Roxon&#x27;s closest female friends and she did much to further Eastman&#x27;s career, but the friendship ended abruptly in 1969 when Eastman moved to London, married Paul McCartney and cut all ties with her former friends, a move which wounded Roxon deeply.

Roxon eventually retaliated, four years later, with a scathing review of the McCartneys&#x27; first American television special. Published in the New York &quot;Sunday News&quot; on 22 April 1973, Roxon&#x27;s review panned the documentary and poured scorn on Linda, slamming her for being &quot;catatonic with horror at having to mingle with ordinary people&quot;, &quot;disdainful if not downright bored ... her teeth relentlessly clamped in a Scarsdale lockjaw&quot;, and &quot;incredibly cold and arrogant&quot;.

During 1968-69, Roxon was commissioned to write what became the world&#x27;s first rock encyclopaedia, published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap in late 1969, and the work for which she is best remembered.

Roxon appears briefly, as an interviewed member of the audience, in the film &quot;Celebration at Big Sur&quot;, filmed at the 1969 Big Sur Folk Festival.

==1970s==
In the early 1970s, Roxon&#x27;s profile expanded and she became more widely known for her feminist writing. She wrote a groundbreaking and highly personal report about the August 1970 women&#x27;s rights march in New York, which was published in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; under the title &quot;There is a tide in the affairs of women&quot;. She wrote a regular column on sex and sexuality for &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; magazine (which continued after her death) and in 1971 she hosted a rock radio show that was syndicated to 250 stations. In late 1972, Roxon met and became friends with David Bowie and his first wife Angie on Bowie&#x27;s Ziggy Stardust Tour, his first tour of the U.S., and was a major champion of Bowie&#x27;s music in the American press as he was trying to break into the U.S. market.

Roxon&#x27;s health declined during the early 1970s. She made what would be her last visit to Australia in early 1973. While she was in Sydney in early February she was interviewed by Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) journalists Jeune Pritchard and Gary Hyde for the ABC&#x27;s pop magazine program &quot;GTK&quot;. The shorter Jeune Pritchard interview was included in a special on the current Australasian tour by The Rolling Stones, and showed Roxon looking unwell. In the longer Gary Hyde interview, Roxon was questioned about the current state of rock music in general; in response to Hyde&#x27;s questions about up-and-coming acts, she cited the New York Dolls and the then-unknown Bette Midler as names to watch.

One of Roxon&#x27;s last print articles reported on Iggy Pop and the Stooges&#x27;s landmark concerts at Max&#x27;s Kansas City in New York and her final piece, filed in early August, was on rising British glam rock star Marc Bolan.

Roxon wrote a novel, loosely based on her years in Sydney, which was never published. This manuscript now resides in Sydney&#x27;s Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales, along with her large collection of letters and other papers, donated by her family and her close friend, the film producer, Margaret Fink.

==Death==
Roxon died at the age of 41 on 10 August 1973, after suffering a severe asthma attack in her New York apartment. She was survived by two brothers Jack and Milo. Both parents predeceased her and she never married or had children.

Her niece, Nicola Roxon was the Attorney-General of Australia from 2012 to 2013.

Roxon Place, in the Canberra suburb of Gilmore with a tradition of street names honouring journalists, is named in her honour.

==Legacy==
In August 2002, a biography of Roxon was published in Australia by Black Inc.: &quot;Lillian Roxon, Mother of Rock&quot;, written by the Sydney-based journalist and author Robert Milliken.

A documentary film entitled &quot;Mother of Rock: Lillian Roxon&quot;, written and directed by Paul Clarke, premiered at the 2010 Melbourne International Film Festival and was partly financed by the Festival&#x27;s Premiere Fund.

In Lily Brett&#x27;s 2012 novel &quot;Lola Bensky&quot;, based on Brett&#x27;s own experience as a music journalist, Lola meets Lillian Roxon.

In the 2017 miniseries &quot;Friday On My Mind&quot;, the Easybeats travel to New York in 1967 and meet Roxon, portrayed by Ella Scott Lynch.

The 2019 film &quot;I Am Woman&quot; depicts Helen Reddy&#x27;s friendship with Lillian Roxon, portrayed by Tilda Cobham-Hervey and Danielle Macdonald respectively.

<doc id="633924" wikidata="Q4862410" url="?curid=633924" title="Baron Grandison">
<text>Baron Grandison was by modern doctrine a title in the Peerage of England created for two brothers, Sir Otton de Grandson and Sir William Grandison, who were summoned to Parliament in 1299. Any hereditary barony for Sir Otho lapsed on his death in 1328, as did that for Sir William on the death of his grandson Thomas Grandison in 1375.

The family originated in what is now the Swiss canton of Vaud by the name of Grandson, the anglicised Grandison was a shortening of the Latin form Grandisono. The family origins lay in the grant of land by Lake Neuchâtel during the last years of the Second Kingdom of Burgundy. 

==Simplified descent==
Pierre de Grandson (c1186-died 1258) marries Agnès de Neuchâtel, their children include

*Otto de Grandson (c1238-died 1328). Sheriff of Tipperary, Lord of the Channel Islands, Lieutenant of Gascony and Justiciar of North Wales
* Gérard de Grandson (1239-died 1278), Bishop of Verdun
*Henri de Grandson (c1252-died 1284), Pastor of Greystoke, Cumberland, Bishop of Verdun
*Jacques de Grandson (c1241-c1291), Seigneur de Belmont from whom the Swiss famille de Grandson will descend. 

*William Grandison (c1250-died 1335) married Jeanne de Gruyère then Sybille Tregoz, their children include
**Piers Grandison (died 1358)
**John Grandison, Bishop of Exeter (died 1369).
**Sir Otho Grandison (died 1359)
***Thomas Grandison (died 1375).
**Agnes Grandison, married John Northwood.
**Mabel Grandison, married Sir John Pateshull.
**Catherine Grandison, married William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury.

The British royal family descends from William through two of his daughters. From Catherine de Grandson through the Montacute and Mortimer families and Richard, Earl of Cambridge, grandfather of Edward IV. From Mabel de Grandson through the Beauchamp and Beaufort families to Henry VII, founder of the Tudor dynasty.

==Abeyance==
In 1858, after five centuries in abeyance, Sir Henry Paston-Bedingfeld, 6th Baronet of Oxburgh Hall (eldest son of Sir Richard Bedingfeld, 5th Baronet) was declared by the Committee of Privileges to be one of the co-heirs of the Barony of Grandison &quot;through &quot;the families of Paston, Tuddenham, Patteshull, and Grandison, heir to Dame Katherine Tuddenham, in whom one-fourth of a third of the representation of the Barony of Grandison had vested.&quot;

<text>Brent Robert Barry (born December 31, 1971), also known by the nickname &quot;Bones&quot;, is an American basketball coach, executive, broadcaster and former player. He is currently an assistant coach for the Phoenix Suns. The shooting guard played professionally in the National Basketball Association (NBA), winning two league championships with the Spurs in 2005 and 2007, and also won the Slam Dunk Contest in 1996. He is the son of Basketball Hall of Famer Rick Barry.

After retiring, Barry worked as a sports commentator for the &quot;NBA on TNT&quot; and was a studio host for the NBA TV show &quot;NBA Gametime&quot;. In 2018, he returned to the Spurs as an executive. He is also a commentator of the &quot;NBA 2K&quot; series and has been a commentator since the release of &quot;NBA 2K21&quot;.

==Early life==
Barry was born on December 31, 1971, in Hempstead, New York. He is the son of Hall of Famer Rick Barry. He attended De La Salle High School in Concord, California.

==College career==
Barry played four years on the Beavers basketball team of Oregon State University after redshirting his freshman season. Barry graduated from Oregon State with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology in 1995.

==Professional career==
Brent Barry was selected by the Denver Nuggets in the first round (15th pick) of the 1995 NBA draft, but was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers on draft night in a four-player trade with Rodney Rogers for the second overall pick in the draft (Antonio McDyess) and Randy Woods. Barry was generally considered a good passer and had three seasons where he averaged more than five assists per game. Barry was also a strong three-point shooter and shot 40% from the three-point line. These two strengths, combined with Barry&#x27;s frame, allowed him to play a variety of positions, including point guard, shooting guard, and small forward; because he was taller than most traditional point guards, he was often considered a point forward when he was running the offense. He was on the San Antonio Spurs championship teams in 2005 and 2007. He won the Slam Dunk Contest in the NBA All-Star Weekend in 1996 with a Julius Erving-inspired slam dunk in which he took off from the free throw line to sail in and dunk one-handed. He was the first white player to win the competition.

===Los Angeles Clippers (1995–1998)===
After being drafted by the Denver Nuggets, Barry was traded immediately to the Los Angeles Clippers. In his rookie season, Brent made 123 3-pointers, which broke the current rookie record. There, Barry would average 10.4 points and 38% on three-point field goals in 179 games. In his second season, he and the Clippers attempted a playoff run where Barry would average 11.7 points, his highest in the postseason. The Clippers only played in three games (one series; 1996–97) during the postseason while Barry was there.

===Miami Heat (1998)===
Barry was traded to the Miami Heat the day before the February 20 trade deadline from Los Angeles for Isaac Austin. In Miami, Barry would only play 17 games, not starting any of them, averaging only 4.1 points.

===Chicago Bulls (1999)===
Barry signed with the Bulls on January 25, 1999, and signed a 6-year $27 million contract. After sustaining an injury, he played only 37 of the 50 games played that season, starting 30 of those games, averaging 11.1 points. Failing to fill the void of a Jordan-less Bulls, the team traded Brent for Hersey Hawkins and James Cotton from Seattle on August 12, 1999.

===Seattle SuperSonics (1999–2004)===
Brent spent five seasons with the Seattle SuperSonics. Brent would begin his Seattle career as a back-up for fellow Oregon State alumnus Gary Payton. He would eventually move to play the point position as a starter, and filled in when needed as a small forward. There he would average 11.2 points, make 669 three-point shots, and start the majority of his NBA career (296 out of 328 games), and total 4,107 points. In Seattle he would play 10 postseason games, starting eight of those, the most in his career thus far.

===San Antonio Spurs (2004–2008)===
In the summer of 2004, Barry was signed as a free agent by the San Antonio Spurs, where he spent most of the season as a backup. After losing their first playoff game to the Denver Nuggets in the 2005 NBA playoffs, San Antonio inserted Barry into the starting lineup. The Spurs&#x27; new lineup helped them beat the Nuggets in the series four games to one. Later in those same playoffs, Barry earned his first championship ring when the Spurs defeated the Detroit Pistons in the 2005 NBA Finals.
Brent and his father, Rick Barry, are the second father-son duo to each win an NBA Championship as a player; the first was Matt Guokas, Sr. and his son Matt Guokas, Jr. The only other father-son duos are Bill Walton and his son Luke Walton, Mychal Thompson and his son Klay Thompson and Gary Payton and his son Gary Payton II.

In June 2007, he won his second NBA championship ring when the Spurs swept the Cleveland Cavaliers 4–0.

In January 2008, Barry tore his right calf muscle. On February 20, 2008, (not too long after his injury) Barry, along with Francisco Elson and a 2009 first-round draft pick, were traded by the San Antonio Spurs back to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for forward/center Kurt Thomas. Barry was waived the following day by the Sonics. After a mandatory 30-day waiting period, he re-signed with San Antonio on March 24, 2008, for one year with the possibility for the 2009–2010 season at Veteran Minimum.

Coming off of injury Barry did not see very much playing time in the first two rounds of the 2008 NBA playoffs. Barry would shine against the Lakers in the Western Conference finals, however, getting 23 points in Game 4, with a controversial no-call foul with 2 seconds on the clock. The Spurs would lose the series in 5 games, however.

San Antonio provided Barry with the most playoff experience (71 games) of his career. He totaled 356 3-point shots made and 1,888 points.

===Houston Rockets (2008–2009)===
Barry opted out of his contract and became a free agent on July 1, 2008. On July 10, Barry signed a 2-year contract with the Houston Rockets, becoming the third member of the family to join the franchise. His father, Rick, ended his career playing two seasons with the Rockets (1978–1980) and his older brother, Jon, also finished his career with the Rockets, playing from 2004 to 06. Financial terms were not released.

Brent&#x27;s other brother Richard Francis &quot;Scooter&quot; Barry IV (born August 13, 1966) is also a retired American professional basketball player.

On October 23, 2009, Brent Barry&#x27;s career ended when he was cut by the Rockets at the end of training camp, leading Barry to later remark that &quot;all the Barrys were buried in Houston&quot;.

==Post-playing career==
In 2013, Barry began making regular appearances on NBA TV&#x27;s &quot;The Starters&quot; in his own segment: &quot;The Bone Zone&quot;. He was a fill-in analyst for the &quot;NBA on TNT&quot; coverage, and was a play-by-play announcer for their &quot;Players Only&quot; broadcast starting in 2016. He was partnered with Ian Eagle for TNT&#x27;s coverage of the 2018 NBA playoffs.

In 2018, Barry joined the San Antonio Spurs&#x27; front office as their vice president of basketball operations.

In August 2024, Barry was hired as an assistant coach for the Phoenix Suns.

==Personal life==
Barry, born in Hempstead, New York, is the son of Hall of Famer Rick Barry, and was arguably the best player of the five basketball-playing Barry sons, the others being Scooter, Jon, Drew, and Canyon. His stepmother, Lynn Barry, also was an accomplished basketball player in college. Brent, the second youngest, played his high school basketball at athletic powerhouse De La Salle High School in Concord, California, and graduated in 1990.

Brent and Erin Barry were married in 1998, after being together from the time they were both in high school. They have two sons. In 2010, Brent Barry filed for divorce, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; after his wife reportedly engaged in an emotional affair with his Spurs teammate Tony Parker.

<doc id="633927" wikidata="Q158687" url="?curid=633927" title="Constitution of Medina">
<text>The Constitution of Medina (; or ; also known as the Umma Document), is a document dealing with tribal affairs during the Islamic prophet Muhammad&#x27;s time in Medina and formed the basis of a multi-religious state under his leadership. Many tribal groups are mentioned, including the Banu Najjar and Quraysh, as well as many tribal institutions, like vengeance, blood money, ransom, alliance, and clientage. The Constitution of Medina has striking resemblances with Surah 5 (Al-Ma&#x27;idah) of the Quran.

The name &quot;Constitution of Medina&quot; is misleading as the text did not establish a state. The name was coined by modern historians, whereas source texts just describe it as a document (&quot;kitāb&quot;, &quot;ṣaḥīfah&quot;). The text was recorded by Ibn Ishaq and Abu &#x27;Ubayd al-Qasim ibn Sallam, though how they encountered the text is unclear. Nevertheless, it is widely accepted as authentic. It may have been preserved due to interest in its manner of administration.

==Background==
According to traditional Islamic belief, in Muhammad&#x27;s last years in Mecca, a delegation from Medina from its twelve important clans invited him as a neutral outsider to serve as the chief arbitrator for the entire community. There had been fighting in Medina involving mainly its pagan and Jewish inhabitants for around 100 years before 620. The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the Battle of Bu&#x27;ath in which all the clans had been involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal conceptions of blood feud and an eye for an eye were no longer workable unless there was one man with the authority to adjudicate in disputed cases. The delegation from Medina pledged themselves and their fellow citizens to accept Muhammad into their community and to protect him physically as if he was one of them.

After emigration to Medina, Muhammad drafted the constitution, &quot;establishing a kind of alliance or federation&quot; of the eight Medinan tribes and Muslim emigrants from Mecca and specifying the rights and duties of all citizens and the relationship of the different communities in Medina, including that of the Muslim community to other communities: the Jews and the other &quot;Peoples of the Book&quot;. According to chroniclers such as Ibn Sa&#x27;d al-Baghdadi (785-845 CE), the composition of the population of Medina at that time consisted of two supergroup local Arab tribes, the Aus and the Khazraj, with eight clans and 33 other smaller groups under them. Meanwhile, the Jewish tribes at least consisted of around 20 groups, with the most well-known tribes Qaynuqa, Nadhir, and Qurayza among them, (who are not mentioned in the agreement).

==Text==
The following English translation is that of Michael Lecker from 2004. It is based on the version of the document found in Ibn Hisham&#x27;s recension of the Seerah of Ibn Ishaq, Abu Ubaid&#x27;s &quot;Kitab-al-Amwal&quot;, and Ibn Kathir&#x27;s &quot;al-Bidaya wa l-Nihaya&quot;. The translation was aimed at being clear, with clauses numbered in line with international standards for ease of future reference. There is general agreement on the authenticity of the text.
# This is a prescript of Muhammad, the Prophet and Messenger of God (to operate) between the faithful and the followers of Islam (&quot;Muslims&quot;) from among the Quraish and the people of Madina and those who may be under them, may join them and take part in wars in their company.

# And the Jews shall share with the believers the expenses of war so long as they fight in conjunction,

# The clients (mawla) shall have the same treatment as the original persons (i.e., persons accepting clientage). He shall neither be harmed nor shall he himself break the covenant.

# And this prescript shall not be of any avail to any oppressor or breaker of covenant. And one shall have security whether one goes out to a campaign or remains in Madina, or else it will be an oppression and breach of covenant. And God is the Protector of him who performs the obligations with faithfulness and care, as also His Messenger Muhammad.

==Historical sources==
The Constitution is only known from excerpts in early Muslim sources, primarily the Al-Sīrah Al-Nabawiyyah of Ibn Hisham (early 800s CE), a recension of the Al-Sīrah Al-Nabawiyyah of Ibn Ishaq, though transmitted without a chain of narration, a crucial criterion for hadith scholars. Other important sources for the Constitution includes those of Sayyid al-Nas and the &quot;Kitab al-Amwal&quot; of Abu &#x27;Ubayd al-Qasim ibn Sallam.

According to L. Ali Khan, scholars do not agree on whether the constitution was a single document or &quot;a compilation of multiple agreements reached at different times&quot;. According to mid-20th century scholar, Robert Bertram Serjeant, the &#x27;Constitution of Medina&#x27; consists of &quot;eight distinct documents ... issued on various occasions over the first seven years or so of Muhammad&#x27;s Medinan period&quot;. In its first recension, Serjeant hypothesizes that the text sanctioned the establishment of a confederation; in its second, it admonished the Aws and Khazraj to abide by their treaty; in its third, in conjunction with the proceeding verses, it encouraged of Muhammad&#x27;s adherents to face the Meccan forces they eventually fought at Uhud. He also suggests that 3:101–104 of the Qur&#x27;an may refer to the constitution.

== Genre and authenticity ==
The Constitution has been highly influential among contemporary Muslims, celebrated for its religious pluralism, unique character and the first &quot;Constitution&quot; and belief that God is its ultimate source. On the other hand, historians have variously characterized it as a &quot;municipal charter” (&quot;Gemeindeordnung&quot;); or as a &quot;unilateral proclamation&quot; by Muhammad, whose &quot;purpose was purely practical and administrative&quot;, rather than a treaty in the modern sense.

Most historians have accepted the authenticity of the Constitution of Medina. This is based on its inclusion of non-Muslims and its portrayal of the Quraysh as enemies of God, a view inconsistent with later Islamic periods. Other factors include the perceived archaic style of the text, its abundance of unexplained allusions that were considered to be likely understood only by contemporaries, and its apparent inclination towards tribal law over developed Islamic norms.

At least a few remain skeptical however, including Robert Hoyland, and some others think that the Constitution existed but its wording or content is no longer accessible. In the case of some historians, skepticism is constrained to particular aspects of the Constitution as well as the context of its emergence; disagreements persist on whether the documents resulted from negotiated settlements or were merely unilateral edicts by Muhammad, the identity of participants (including uncertainty about the inclusion of the three major Jewish tribes of Medina—Banu Qaynuqa, Banu Nadir, and Banu Qurayza), the quantity of documents, the precise timing of its creation (or that of its constituent parts), and the appropriate approach to its translation, among other issues.

== Dating ==
One 20th-century scholar, W. Montgomery Watt, suggested that the Constitution of Medina must have been written in the early Medinan period (i.e., in 622 CE or shortly thereafter), because if the document had been drafted any later, then it would have both had a positive attitude towards the Quraysh and given Muhammad a more prominent place. Malay scholars, Fadzilah Din and Mohamed Noh Abdul Jalil, as well as the noted Pakistani scholar, Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri, cite the 622 CE drafting. Others, such as Hubert Grimme, suggested that it must have been drafted after the 624 CE Battle of Badr. Still others, such as Leone Caetani, suggested that the document was written before that battle.

Portions of the constitution are corroborated by multiple sound hadith reports. Its validity in its stated single form, however, has been called into question, as there is no single sound chain of authorities (isnad) supporting it. There are differences of opinion as well as to how many documents the constitution comprises—from one to eight. It is also unclear with which Jews this agreement was made, whether it was only with some of the smaller Jewish social units that had lost their tribal structure and affiliated with the Arabs, with the Judaized Arabs, or also included what later sources described as the three major Jewish clans in the city, namely Banu Qaynuqa, Banu Nadir, and Banu Qurayza, (who are not mentioned in the agreement).

This constitution gave the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who had just escaped persecution in Mecca, a leading role in the community of Medina. By dating this treaty at the outset of his arrival, it credited Muhammad with honor and power earlier than he would later gain, but more importantly, it gives the justification for Muhammad&#x27;s subsequent attacks on the Jews as retaliation for their opposition to him. There is a suggestion, however, that if this constitution really existed, it was probably created after the elimination of the three major Jewish clans in Medina by Muhammad and his troops.

Another question raised about the constitution is that though it gives a list of Jewish tribes/clans of Medina involved, not among them are three famous in traditional Islamic history for being driven into exile (the Banu Qaynuqa and Banu Nadir tribes) or &quot;massacred and dumped into pits&quot; (the Banu Qurayza tribe), after conspiring and rising up against Muhammad.

==Relationships between signatories==

=== Relationship with Jewish tribes ===
One of the constitution&#x27;s more interesting aspects was the inclusion of the Jewish tribes in the ummah because although the Jewish tribes were &quot;one community with the believers&quot;, they also &quot;have their religion and the Muslims have theirs&quot;.

L. Ali Khan says that it was a social contract derived from a treaty and not from any fictional state of nature or from behind the Rawlsian veil of ignorance. It was built upon the concept of one community of diverse tribes living under the sovereignty of one God.

It also instituted peaceful methods of dispute resolution among diverse groups living as one people but without assimilating into one religion, language or culture. Welch in &quot;Encyclopedia of Islam&quot; states: &quot;The constitution reveals Muhammad&#x27;s great diplomatic skills, for it allows the ideal that he cherished of an ummah (community) based clearly on a religious outlook to sink temporarily into the background and is shaped essentially by practical considerations.&quot;

===Relationship between Believers===
Another important feature of the Constitution of Medina is the redefinition of ties between &quot;Believers&quot; (as they are described in the document). It sets faith relationships above blood-ties and emphasizes individual responsibility. Tribal identities are still important to refer to different groups, but the &quot;main binding tie&quot; for the newly created ummah is religion. That contrasts with the norms of pre-Islamic Arabia, which was a thoroughly tribal society, but Serjeant postulates the existence of earlier theocratic communities. According to Denny, &quot;Watt has likened the Ummah as it is described in the document to a tribe, but with the important difference that it was to be based on religion and not on kinship&quot;. That is an important event in the development of the small group of Muslims in Medina to the larger Muslim community and empire.

<text>Sanjay Gupta (born October 23, 1969) is an American neurosurgeon, medical reporter, and writer. He serves as associate chief of the neurosurgery service at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, associate professor of neurosurgery at the Emory University School of Medicine, member of the National Academy of Medicine and American Academy of Arts and Sciences and is the chief medical correspondent for CNN.

Gupta is known for his many TV appearances on health-related issues. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, he has been a frequent contributor to numerous CNN shows covering the crisis, as well as hosting a weekly town hall with Anderson Cooper. Gupta was the host of the CNN show &quot;Sanjay Gupta MD&quot; for which he has won multiple Emmy Awards. Gupta also hosted the 6-part miniseries &quot;Chasing Life&quot;. He is a frequent contributor to other CNN programs such as &quot;American Morning&quot;, &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;CNN Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot;. His reports from Charity Hospital, New Orleans, Louisiana, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina led to his winning a 2006 Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Feature Story in a Regularly Scheduled Newscast&quot;. He is also a special correspondent for CBS News.

Sanjay Gupta also co-hosts the health conference Life Itself, along with Marc Hodosh (co-creator of TEDMED). Gupta published a column in &quot;Time&quot; magazine and has written four books: &quot;Chasing Life&quot;, &quot;Cheating Death&quot;, &quot;Monday Mornings: A Novel&quot;, and &quot;Keep Sharp&quot; (Jan 2021).

== Early life and education ==
Gupta was born in Novi, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. In the 1960s, Gupta&#x27;s parents, Subhash and Damyanti Gupta, moved from India prior to their marriage and met in Livonia, Michigan, where they worked as engineers for Ford Motor Company. His mother was born in the village of Tharushah in Sindh (now Pakistan), but at age 5 fled to India as a Hindu refugee during the Partition of India. Gupta and his younger brother Suneel graduated from Novi High School and Gupta went on to receive his Bachelor of Science degree in biomedical sciences at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and his M.D. degree from the University of Michigan Medical School in 1993. He was part of Interflex, a since discontinued accelerated medical education program that accepted medical students directly from high school.

As an undergraduate, Gupta worked as an orientation leader for the freshman orientation program and was a member of the Men&#x27;s Glee Club. He also served as president of the Indian American Students Association (IASA), which is now the second-largest student organization at the university. Gupta completed his residency in neurological surgery within the University of Michigan Health System, in 2000, followed by a fellowship at the Semmes Murphy Clinic, in Memphis, Tennessee. Gupta plays the accordion, having taken ten years of lessons, as he noted in an interview with David Hochman for &quot;Playboy&quot;.

Gupta was a White House Fellow in 1997-1998.

==Career==

=== Medical practice ===

Gupta is an Emory Healthcare general neurosurgeon at Grady Memorial Hospital and has worked on spine, trauma and 3‑D‑image-guided operations. He has published medical journal articles on percutaneous pedicle screw placement, brain tumors, and spinal cord abnormalities. He is licensed to practice medicine in Georgia. From 1997 to 1998, he served as one of fifteen White House Fellows, primarily as an advisor to Hillary Clinton. In January 2009, it was reported that Gupta was offered the position of Surgeon General of the United States in the Obama Administration, but he withdrew his name from consideration.

During his reporting in Haiti following the January 2010 earthquake, Gupta received a call from the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; that an earthquake victim, a 12-year-old girl, was aboard and needed a neurosurgeon. Gupta, a pediatric surgeon, Henri Ford, and two U.S. Navy doctors removed a piece of concrete from the girl&#x27;s skull in an operation performed aboard the &quot;Vinson&quot;. Ford later wrote that Gupta &quot;proved to be a competent neurosurgeon&quot;.

=== Broadcast journalism, television, film and events ===

Gupta joined CNN in the summer of 2001. He reported from New York following the attacks on the U.S. on September 11, 2001. In 2003, Gupta traveled to Iraq to cover the medical aspects of the invasion of Iraq. While in Iraq, Gupta performed emergency surgery on both US soldiers and Iraqi civilians. Gupta was embedded with a Navy medical unit at the time, specifically a group of Corpsman called the &quot;Devil Docs&quot;, who supported the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force. Marine Sergeant Jesus Vindaña suffered a rear gunshot wound, and the Marines asked for Gupta&#x27;s assistance because of his background in neurosurgery. Vindaña survived and was sent back to the United States for rehabilitation.
In December 2006, CBS News president Sean McManus negotiated a deal with CNN that would have Gupta file up to ten reports a year for the &quot;CBS Evening News with Katie Couric&quot; and &quot;60 Minutes&quot; while remaining CNN&#x27;s chief medical correspondent and associate chief of neurosurgery at Grady Memorial Hospital.

On October 14, 2007, Gupta guest-hosted a health episode of &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; as its regular host Charles Osgood was on vacation. In February 2009, Gupta hosted &quot;AC360&quot; covering the White House Health Summit. He also guest hosted &quot;Larry King Live&quot; in October 2009. In January 2010, Gupta and Cooper led CNN&#x27;s coverage of the earthquake in Haiti. Gupta has regularly appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;, &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;, &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; and &quot;the Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. Winfrey referred to Gupta as CNN&#x27;s hero in January 2010.

In 2011, Gupta portrayed himself in the movie &quot;Contagion&quot;, which has received much renewed attention during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. His novel &quot;Monday Mornings&quot; became an instant &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller on its release in March 2012. It was adapted as a 2013 television series with David E. Kelley and Gupta serving as executive producers. In a 2013 editorial, Gupta announced that in the process of working on a documentary about marijuana he had changed his mind about the drug&#x27;s risks and benefits. Gupta had previously criticized laws that allowed patient access to medical marijuana, but he reversed his stance, saying, &quot;I am here to apologize,&quot; and, &quot;We have been terribly and systematically misled for nearly 70 years in the United States, and I apologize for my own role in that.&quot; The third part of his 3-hour documentary, &quot;Weed 3: The Marijuana Revolution&quot;, was released in April 2015. He was a co-producer of the 2017 CNN documentary &quot;Unseen Enemy&quot;, which warned of the risks of a global pandemic.

Gupta served as a commentator on the University of Michigan TeamCast with former Wolverines kicker Jay Feely for the school&#x27;s appearance in the 2018 NCAA Men&#x27;s Final Four, which aired on CNN sibling TNT. In April 2019, &quot;Chasing Life&quot; was adapted as a six-show TV miniseries on CNN that took him to Japan, India, Bolivia, Norway, Italy, and Turkey. In September 2019, Gupta and Marc Hodosh (Co-Creator of TEDMED) announced a new event called Life Itself in partnership with CNN. Both Gupta and Hodosh will serve as hosts and organizers. From June 28 to July 9, 2021, Gupta served as a guest host on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;.

=== Surgeon General candidate ===
On January 6, 2009, CNN announced that Gupta had been considered for the position of Surgeon General by President-elect Barack Obama. Some doctors said that his communication skills and high-profile would allow him to highlight medical issues and prioritize medical reform. Others raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest with drug companies who have sponsored his broadcasts and his lack of skepticism in weighing the costs and benefits of medical treatments. Representative John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI), wrote a letter opposing Gupta&#x27;s nomination. Conyers supported a single-payer health care system; Gupta has criticized Michael Moore and his film &quot;Sicko&quot;.

From the medical community, Donna Wright, of Creative Health Care Management, a regular commentator on medicine and politics, also defended the appointment on the grounds of his media presence, combined with his medical qualifications, which she viewed as an ideal combination for the post of surgeon general. Likewise, Fred Sanfilippo, executive vice president for health affairs at Emory University, supported Gupta&#x27;s nomination by issuing a press release saying: &quot;He has the character, training, intelligence and communications skills needed to help the United States improve its health and health care delivery systems in the next Administration.&quot; The American Council on Exercise, listed by PR Newswire as &quot;America&#x27;s leading authority on fitness and one of the largest fitness certification, education and training organizations in the world&quot;, endorsed the nomination of Gupta
&quot;because of his passion for inspiring Americans to lead healthier, more active lives&quot;. The ACE sent a letter of support to senator Edward M. Kennedy. Former surgeon general Joycelyn Elders also supported Gupta&#x27;s nomination, saying: &quot;He has enough well-trained, well-qualified public health people to teach him the things he needs to do the job.&quot; In March 2009 Gupta withdrew his name from consideration for the post, citing his family and his career.

== Criticisms ==
Some journalists and journalism professors specializing in health care have criticized the quality of Gupta&#x27;s coverage. Trudy Lieberman, a regular &quot;Nation&quot; contributor on healthcare and director of the health and medicine reporting program at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism, reviewed Gupta&#x27;s &quot;ineptitude&quot; in reporting on the McCain health plan. Lieberman criticized Gupta for relying on insurance industry statistics, and a health expert quoted by Lieberman said that Gupta&#x27;s reporting &quot;gives a gross oversimplification&quot;. Gary Schwitzer, professor of health journalism at the University of Minnesota School of Journalism and now an editor at &quot;Health News Review&quot;, has also criticized Gupta&#x27;s reporting.

Peter Aldhous criticized Gupta&#x27;s &quot;enthusiasm for many forms of medical screening – even when the scientific evidence indicates that it may not benefit patients&quot;. He and other medical journalists accuse him of a &quot;pro-screening bias&quot; in promoting widespread electrocardiogram and prostate cancer screening, even though medical authorities like the US Preventive Services Task Force recommend against it.

=== Michael Moore dispute ===
A July 9, 2007, broadcast of CNN&#x27;s &quot;The Situation Room&quot; aired a fact-check segment by Gupta on Michael Moore&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;Sicko&quot; in which Gupta stated that Moore had &quot;fudged facts&quot;. Immediately following the segment, Moore was interviewed live on CNN by Wolf Blitzer. Moore said that Gupta&#x27;s report was inaccurate and biased, and Moore later posted a detailed response on his website. Moore accused CNN of being biased in favor of the drug industry because most of the sponsors for their medical coverage were drug companies.

On July 10, 2007, Gupta debated Moore on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;; on July 15, CNN released a statement in response to Michael Moore&#x27;s rebuttal. In it, they apologized for an error in their on-air report, having stated that in the film Moore reported Cuba spends $25 per person for health care when the film actually gave that number as $251. CNN attributed this to a transcription error. CNN defended the rest of Gupta&#x27;s report responding point-by-point to Moore&#x27;s response, contending that comparison of data from different sources in different years was in effect cherry picking results, at the cost of statistical accuracy.

==Honors==
On April 28, 2012, Gupta was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree for his accomplishments in the medical field. He also gave the commencement address at the spring commencement ceremony held in the University of Michigan Stadium. On March 20, 2015, Gupta along with his wife, Rebecca, received the 2015 UNICEF Global Philanthropist Award. On June 12, 2016, Gupta addressed the Oregon Health &amp; Science University graduating class of 2016. On May 23, 2019, Gupta presented the commencement address to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine class of 2019. In October 2019, Gupta was elected to the National Academy of Medicine, to join its 2019 class consisting of 100 members, one of the highest honors in medicine. Gupta was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2021. On October 6, 2022, Gupta was honored with the Fitzwater Medallion for Leadership in Public Communication by Franklin Pierce University. On May 22, 2023, Gupta delivered Baylor College of Medicine’s commencement address and was awarded the honorary Doctor of Letters in Medicine degree. On May 25, 2023, Gupta was the featured keynote speaker at the Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Dental Medicine Class Day commencement ceremony.

<text>Overpeck Creek is a tributary of the Hackensack River, approximately long, in Bergen County in northeastern New Jersey in the United States. The lower broad mouth of the creek is part of the extended tidal estuary of the lower Hackensack and of the adjacent wetland region known as the New Jersey Meadowlands.

The upper creek flows through suburban communities west of New York City. The creek rises in Tenafly, on the west side of the Palisades, approximately from the Hudson River. It flows south-southwest through Englewood, past Teaneck, Leonia, and Palisades Park, where it flows past the Overpeck County Park. It joins the Hackensack on the south side of Ridgefield Park and the east side of Little Ferry.

In colonial times, the creek was called &quot;Tantaqua&quot; and was the site of a Hackensack village. An attempted European settlement, Achter Col, in 1642 was aborted after Lenape retaliations for the Pavonia Massacre. Later 17th and 18th century settlements were collectively known as the English Neighborhood. The creek lay along the main land route west of the Hudson and provided a consistently difficult barrier for transportation in the area until the construction of modern roads and bridges in the 19th century. Development of the region was facilitated by the New Jersey Midland Railway, the West Shore Railroad, and the Erie Railroad&#x27;s Northern Branch, the latter of which partially runs parallel to the creek. Restoration of rail service is the object of the Northern Branch Corridor Project and the Passaic–Bergen–Hudson Transit Project.

Although the creek is theoretically navigable, the mouth of the creek is blocked by the two bridges of the CSX River Line and NYS&amp;W railroads. Federal law requires that these bridges be opened to water traffic on 24 hours&#x27; notice. The NYS&amp;W bridge can still be opened manually, but the CSX bridge has been inoperable since being rebuilt in 2002, rendering the owning railroad liable to a fine of $25,000 per incident. Work to replace the bridge was funded in 2017 and work was scheduled to begin in 2018. The bridge collapsed under a train in August 2018.

Like the other tributaries of the Hackensack in the Meadowlands, the creek has suffered from severe pollution in the 20th century during the era of heavy industrialization. During the 1950s, tide gates were installed on the creek that largely cut off the tidal flow into the surrounding wetlands. The restoration of the surrounding wetlands has been an ongoing project of several state and private agencies.

<text>Jon Alan Barry (born July 25, 1969) is an American former professional basketball player and television analyst for ABC and ESPN. Barry is currently the lead analyst for ESPN Radio&#x27;s coverage of the NBA.

==Biography==
Barry is the son of Hall of Famer Rick Barry and Pam Connolly, and has three brothers: Scooter, Brent, and Drew, all of whom are also basketball players. Jon played his high school basketball at De La Salle High School in Concord, California. He then played one year each at University of the Pacific and Paris Junior College, before receiving a basketball scholarship to attend Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia.

Out of Georgia Tech, he was selected in the first round of the 1992 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics, but refused to sign a contract and sat out the season. The Celtics traded their rights to him, mid season, to the Milwaukee Bucks for Alaa Abdelnaby. Barry joined the Milwaukee Bucks, who finished last, tied for last, and 2nd to last in their division Barry&#x27;s first three years in the NBA.

Off to a slow start of a career as primarily a backup player, Barry did get chances to contribute to playoff runs of some good teams (scored 739 points in 82 appearances with the 2001–2002 Central Division champion Detroit Pistons) and scored 326 career playoff points in 63 NBA playoff games over 14 seasons. He had two games with 5 three-point shots and had six games with 5 steals, and has 5,041 season and playoff points total.

In addition to the Milwaukee Bucks and Detroit Pistons, Jon played for the Atlanta Hawks, Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State Warriors, Sacramento Kings, Denver Nuggets and most recently the Houston Rockets. Barry had 12 first-half points in a 3-minute span in the deciding game 5 of the first round of the 2002 NBA playoffs in the Detroit Pistons&#x27; series against the Toronto Raptors. Barry left the Pistons after the 2002–03 season, and was also released from the Rockets on March 1, 2006, which marked the end of his NBA playing career.

<text>Cirroteuthidae is a family of pelagic cirrate octopuses comprising at least three species in two genera.

== Description ==
The cirrate octopods have a unique internal shell, positioned dorsally above the viscera and with a &#x27;saddle-like&#x27; shape (or &#x27;butterfly-like&#x27; in &quot;Cirrothauma&quot; due to the anterior corners being more drawn out). The lateral faces of the &#x27;saddle&#x27; acting as large attachment sites for fin muscles, supporting proportionally large and powerful fins. The arms are elongate and have both a primary web, forming most of the webbing, and a secondary web connecting the primary webbing to the aboral (outer) faces of each arm. The cirri, pairs of small finger-like projections between each sucker, are very elongate. Both the elongate cirri and secondary web are features shared with Stauroteuthidae, but no other cirrate family.

==Taxonomy==
The family Cirroteuthidae contains two generally accepted genera containing at least four species, but also some possibly undescribed taxa.
*Genus &quot;Cirroteuthis&quot; Eschricht, 1838: this genus contains an additional undescribed species from around Australia and New Zealand.
**&quot;Cirroteuthis muelleri&quot; Eschricht, 1838 
*Genus &quot;Cirrothauma&quot; Chun, 1911
**&quot;Cirrothauma magna&quot; (Hoyle, 1885)
**&quot;Cirrothauma murrayi&quot; Chun, 1911&quot;:&quot; often known as the blind cirrate.
**&quot;Cirrothauma hoylei&quot; (Robson, 1932): originally described in genus &quot;Cirroteuthis&quot;, but almost certainly a &quot;Cirrothauma&quot; and possibly synonym of &quot;C. magna&quot;&quot;.&quot;
There are also two genera of uncertain affinity placed in this family, but both are in need of critical assessment.

* &quot;Laetmoteuthis&quot; Berry, 1913
* &quot;Froekenia&quot; Hoyle, 1904: One described species (&quot;Froekenia clara&quot;) and an undescribed species, quite likely synonymous with &quot;Stauroteuthis&quot; given shell form.

<text>Father of the Pride is an American animated sitcom created by Jeffrey Katzenberg and produced by DreamWorks Animation. The series aired on NBC from August 31, 2004 to May 27, 2005. The series was part of a short-lived trend of 3D animated series in prime-time network television (after &quot;Game Over&quot;).

&quot;Father of the Pride&quot; follows a family of white lions, the patriarch of which stars in a Siegfried &amp; Roy show in Las Vegas. Despite heavy promotion and support, the series was cancelled after one season due to declining ratings. Transmission and production were also delayed by the real-life on-stage injury of Roy Horn in October 2003.

==Premise==
The show follows the adventures of a family of white lions. The family contains Larry, the bumbling yet well-intentioned star of Siegfried &amp; Roy&#x27;s show; Kate, a pretty, stay-at-home mother who is a member of a special women&#x27;s group; Sierra, their teenage daughter who is frequently annoyed by her family; Hunter, their awkward young son, who is a huge fan of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;; Sarmoti, Kate&#x27;s father and Sierra and Hunter&#x27;s grandfather who has a dislike for Larry; and Snack, Larry&#x27;s mischievous gopher friend.

Recurring characters appear alongside the lion family; these include Larry&#x27;s friends Roger, Chutney, Vincent, and Nelson; Larry&#x27;s rival Blake and his wife Victoria; Sarmoti&#x27;s friends Bernie, Duke, Chaz, and the Snout Brothers; Hi Larious; Kate&#x27;s friends Foo-Lin, Lily, and Brittany; two lesbian gophers Chimmi &amp; Changa; and Sierra&#x27;s boyfriend Justin.

==Development==

More than 200 animators worked on &quot;Father of the Pride&quot; for 2 years. Computer animation was produced at Imagi Animation Studios in Hong Kong.

The series employed a small group of seasoned directors, which included Mark Risley, Bret Haaland, Steve Hickner, John Holmquist, John Stevenson, and Mark Baldo. Felix Ip served as creative director for Imagi. For the first season, DreamWorks created 30 principal sets, 500 special props, and about 100 characters. In fact, a typical episode unfolds across all 30 principal sets and features two or three unique locations as well. The lion habitat is inspired by the real Secret Garden in Las Vegas, where the actual Siegfried &amp; Roy lions reside. In &quot;Father of the Pride&quot;, the Secret Garden encompasses residences for the main characters and their families and public areas ranging from the community bar to a school classroom.

Since Larry and his family drive the story lines for most of the episodes, their residence is the most detailed, comprising separate, contiguous sets for the living room, the kitchen, and the children&#x27;s bedrooms. Meanwhile, the assets are stored in individual files in order to be loaded into separate layers and assembled modularly.

=== Production ===
In 2002, Jeffrey Katzenberg came up with the idea for the series when he visited Siegfried &amp; Roy&#x27;s show in Las Vegas: &quot;I thought, I wonder what it&#x27;s like for those lions. What must life be like from their point of view? [They&#x27;re] living in Las Vegas, trying to raise a family and earn a living. In animation, we look for those things — a way to look at our lives through a fantasy world. It allows us to take on subjects that are too difficult to do with real people. It allows us to be more controversial. Edgier. There can be parody and innuendo and satire. Things can be sophisticated in a way that even our feature films can&#x27;t be.&quot;

According to Katzenberg, the series was created for &quot;an 18- to 49-year-old. It&#x27;s not about checking to make sure you don&#x27;t leave the 6-, 7- and 8-year-olds behind. This is purely an adult show.&quot;

Each episode cost an estimated $2 million to $2.5 million to produce, making it at the time of its release one of the most expensive half-hour television comedies ever.

Long before its broadcast, the series was nearly cancelled, following the near-death of Roy Horn in October 2003; but after his condition improved, Siegfried &amp; Roy urged NBC to continue production. Katzenberg recalled, &quot;There was a short period of time where we all just rocked out on our heels and couldn&#x27;t be particularly creative and certainly not very funny. But Siegfried kept saying, every step of the way, that this show meant so much to them. So much to Roy. Then, even more than it ever did.&quot;

===Opening sequence===
The opening sequence starts off with a red sports car, with the Nevada license plate &quot;MAGIC1&quot;, being driven by Siegfried and Roy past many of the attractions in Las Vegas. Cast names are presented on the marquees of the Strip hotels that, along with the Mirage, belonged to the MGM / Mirage Group at the time, before the car swerves into the Mirage Hotel. The scene then changes to the lions&#x27; house. Larry (voiced by John Goodman) gets woken up by his wife Kate (voiced by Cheryl Hines), late for his performance, on the couch before dashing towards the stage (but not before having a beer given to him by Snack {voiced by Orlando Jones} at the Watering Hole). Larry sings a rendition of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; as the background music throughout the title sequence.

==Release and reception==
The series&#x27; debut on NBC on August 31, 2004 attracted 12.3 million viewers, making it the most-watched series of the week on American television. However, the series was expected to improve, especially considering heavy promotion during NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. Its opening ranked only the 13th of 16 fall comedies that NBC introduced since 1999.

When the series debuted, it got off to a good start with strong ratings. The ratings continued to show promise through early September 2004 before declining quickly. A few airings were preempted due to the 2004 presidential election. By November 2004, it was pulled from NBC&#x27;s sweeps line-up. In early December, Jeffrey Katzenberg announced that he did not think the series would be picked up for a second season. A few of the remaining episodes were burned off in late December 2004 and the series was not renewed for a second season.

&quot;Father of the Pride&quot; received a negative response from television critics, who considered it to be little more than a gimmick and a shill for other NBC and DreamWorks properties (two early episodes extensively featured &quot;The Today Show&quot;″s Matt Lauer and another featured Donkey from the &quot;Shrek&quot; franchise). Also, many television critics noticed that the series&#x27; humor was very similar to &quot;South Park&quot; (one episode even had a character say, &quot;Screw you guys, I&#x27;m goin&#x27; home!&quot;).

According to Katzenberg, Siegfried &amp; Roy&#x27;s reactions were more positive: &quot;They laughed. A lot. They kept asking us to create more contradiction. Literally, one&#x27;s blond and one&#x27;s dark, and every aspect of their life is as black and white as that. They are always playful with one another, always playing tricks on one another. They encouraged us to have fun with that.&quot;

===Protest from the Parents Television Council===
In October 2004, the Parents Television Council&#x27;s launched a campaign against &quot;Father of the Pride&quot;. Reasons cited for their opposition were the use of anthropomorphic animals and the use of &quot;from the creators of &quot;Shrek&quot;&quot; in their promotions. The film in question was seen by the Council as much more family-friendly than this series, which the PTC stated could inadvertently draw the wrong audience based on the way it was promoted by NBC. Their campaign led to over 11,000 complaints to the Federal Communications Commission. In March 2006, the FCC ruled that the show was not indecent.

=== Awards and nominations ===
&quot;Father of the Pride&quot; won an Annie Award in 2005 for Character Design in an Animated Television Production. It was also nominated for a 2005 People&#x27;s Choice Award in the category Favorite New TV Comedy Series.

=== Broadcast ===
&quot;Father of the Pride&quot; premiered in the United States on August 31, 2004, on NBC.

In the United Kingdom, the series premiered on March 6, 2005, originally on Sky One.

In Canada, the series premiered on September 5, 2008, on Teletoon Detour.

===Home media===
&quot;Father of the Pride&quot; was released on DVD on June 7, 2005. The DVD features the original pilot, an alternate pilot (which draws heavily on the original), two unaired episodes, and one episode that was voice-recorded and not animated (and therefore, remains at the storyboard stage).

Since July 15, 2020, the series became available on Peacock with its launch.

<doc id="633948" wikidata="Q2165446" url="?curid=633948" title="Grimpoteuthis">
<text>Grimpoteuthis is a genus of pelagic cirrate (finned) octopods known as the dumbo octopi. The name &quot;dumbo&quot; originates from their resemblance to the title character of Disney&#x27;s 1941 film &quot;Dumbo&quot;, having two prominent ear-like fins which extend from the mantle above each eye. There are 17 species recognized in the genus.

Prey include crustaceans, bivalves, worms and copepods. The average life span of various &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; species is 3 to 5 years. 

==Range and habitat==

Dumbo octopuses are the deepest living octopuses known, with some specimens captured or observed at hadal depths. One &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; specimen was captured southeast of Grand Cayman at , but this depth is uncertain (as the specimen may have been captured while the net was descending to this depth).

In 2020, &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; was spotted deep in the Java Trench, confirming the hadal distribution of this genus.

== Species and taxonomy ==
As noted below, many species collected on the &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition were initially classified in the genera &quot;Cirroteuthis&quot; and &quot;Stauroteuthis.&quot; Several species formerly classified as &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; were later moved to genera &quot;Cirroctopus&quot; and &quot;Opisthoteuthis&quot;. A new family, Grimpoteuthididae (alternatively spelled Grimpoteuthidae), has been proposed to accommodate &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; and those of genera &quot;Enigmatiteuthis&quot;, &quot;Cryptoteuthis&quot;, and &quot;Luteuthis&quot;. The persistent confusion and disparity about the taxonomy of these species has been attributed to the poor quality and limited number of specimens available for study.
:

==Movement, characteristics, and food supply==
Observations of animals in the Atlantic reveal that &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; often rest on the seafloor with the arms and web spread out and uses its arms to slowly crawl along the seafloor. When disturbed, the webbing and arms are contracted to propel the animal off the seafloor and using the mantle fins for rapid locomotion. 

The cushiony cartilage that can be found in the proximal position of the fin of &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; is responsible for acting as a support for the thick muscles that allow for rapid locomotion. 

Although it has been suggested that species of &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; are capable of jet-propulsion (while swimming using the fins), this has since been deemed unlikely. 

Feeding behavior has not been directly observed in &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot;, but presumably is similar to &quot;Opisthoteuthis&quot; which can trap small prey items in the webbing (either by enclosing the prey in the arm webbing or between the webbing and the seafloor) and then use the cirri (fingerlike projections along the arms) to move food to the mouth. Known prey items (from dissected animals) include benthic polychaetes, benthopelagic copepods, amphipods and isopods.

==Breeding==
The cirrate octopuses are classified as &#x27;continuous spawners&#x27;: Females carry multiple eggs in various stages of maturation, and only lay one or two eggs at a time, with no seasonality in spawning (however, most of these aspects of reproductive biology have only been confirmed in &quot;Opisthoteuthis&quot;, not &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot;). Mating in cirrate octopuses has never been observed, and unlike other octopuses, members of Cirrata lack a hectocotylus for the transfer of sperm packets.
Cirrate octopus eggs are large and have a tough casing surrounding the chorion (not found in other octopuses), and &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; in particular attach their eggs to deep sea corals (octocorals).

Unlike other octopuses, the female cirrate octopus does not guard or incubate the eggs.
&quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; hatchlings emerge as &quot;fully competent&quot; juveniles with all of the sensory and motor features to survive on their own.

Sexual dimorphism between males and females is less noticeable and consistent in &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; compared to other cirrate octopuses (such as &quot;Opisthoteuthis&quot;). In some species (e.g., &quot;G. bathynectes&quot; and &quot;G.. discoveryi&quot;), the males have enlarged suckers relative to the females, but no such enlargement is found in other &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; species.

== Threats ==
Species of &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; face few direct threats from humans largely due to living at depths of and below. Natural predators of cirrate octopuses include large teleost fish and sharks, and even marine mammals such as sperm whales and seals, but these are mostly predators of other cirrate genera&quot;. Grimpoteuthis&quot; has only been recorded in the stomach contents of a shark.

The &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; do not have an ink sac (as is the case with all cirrate octopuses). Furthermore, the cirrate octopuses lack innervated chromatophores and therefore are not capable of changing color (despite some unreferenced statements to the contrary).
How cirrate octopuses escape or avoid predators is largely unknown.

<doc id="633952" wikidata="Q3121925" url="?curid=633952" title="SS Stephen Hopkins">
<text>SS &quot;Stephen Hopkins&quot; was a United States Merchant Marine Liberty ship that served in World War II. She was the only US merchant vessel to sink a German surface combatant during the war.

She was built at the Permanente Metals Corporation (Kaiser) shipyards in Richmond, California. Her namesake was Stephen Hopkins, a Founding Father and signer of the Declaration of Independence from Rhode Island. She was operated by Luckenbach Steamship Company under charter with the Maritime Commission and War Shipping Administration.

==Action of 27 September 1942==

She completed her first cargo run, but never made it home. On September 27, 1942, en route from Cape Town to Surinam, she encountered the heavily armed German commerce raider and her tender . Because of fog, the ships were only apart when they sighted each other.

Ordered to stop, &quot;Stephen Hopkins&quot; refused to surrender, and &quot;Stier&quot; opened fire. Although greatly outgunned, the crew of &quot;Stephen Hopkins&quot; fought back, replacing the Armed Guard crew of the ship&#x27;s lone 4-inch (102 mm) gun with volunteers as they fell. The fight was fierce and short, and by its end both ships were wrecks.
&quot;Stephen Hopkins&quot; sank at 10:00. &quot;Stier&quot;, too heavily damaged to continue her voyage, was scuttled by its crew less than two hours later. Most of the crew of &quot;Stephen Hopkins&quot; died, including Captain Paul Buck. The 15 survivors drifted on a lifeboat for a month before reaching shore in Brazil.

Captain Buck was posthumously awarded the Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal for his actions. So was US Merchant Marine Academy cadet Edwin Joseph O&#x27;Hara, who single-handedly fired the last shots from the ship&#x27;s 4-inch gun. Navy reservist Lt. (j.g.) Kenneth Martin Willett, commander of the Armed Guard detachment which manned the ship&#x27;s 4-inch gun, was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.

The Liberty ships , , and , and the destroyer escort were named in honor of crew members of &quot;Stephen Hopkins&quot;, and in honor of the ship itself.

==Recognition==
*O&#x27;Hara Hall, the gymnasium facility at the United States Merchant Marine Academy, is named in honor of Midshipman O&#x27;Hara.
*Captain Paul Buck, master of SS &quot;Stephen Hopkins&quot;, was given the Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal by The President of the United States. For determination to fight his ship and his perseverance in engaging the enemy to the utmost until his ship was rendered helpless. The award was given by Admiral Emory S. Land.
*George S. Cronk, Second Engineer on the ship, sailed his lifeboat 2,200 miles for 31 days to save his shipmates. He was given the Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal by the President of the United States. The award was given by Admiral Emory S. Land.
*SS &quot;Stephen Hopkins&quot; was awarded the Gallant Ship Award for outstanding courage against overpowering odds by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration.

<text>A weather stick is a traditional means of weather prediction used by some Native Americans. It consists of a balsam fir or birch rod mounted outdoors which twists upwards in low humidity and downwards in high-humidity environments. These sticks were first used by the Native Americans of the American northeast and the Canadian east and southeast, who noted the behavior of dry branches before the arrival of weather changes. The weather stick is a rare example of a weather prediction tool that predates the mercury barometer

<text>Luteuthis dentatus, also known as Lu&#x27;s jellyhead, is a medium-sized species of cirrate octopus found in the southwestern Pacific, originally described by Steve O&#x27;Shea.

== Description ==
&quot;Luteuthis dentatus&quot; reaches a relatively large size with disproportionately long arms. The male holotype specimen from off New Zealand had a total length of 524 mm, while a large female from off Macquarie Island had a total length of 590 mm. However, for the latter specimen, this length was following considerable shrinkage in ethanol, with the original length estimated to be 850 mm. The fins are very large with a red or pink tinge.

The species was given the name &quot;dentatus&quot; because it has a radula, a tooth-like structure used for tearing food into pieces. Few other cirrate species possess this feature.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Luteuthis dentatus&quot; was originally described from material collected in the waters around New Zealand, with two specimens being collected over a depth range of 991–1050 m.

The species has more recently been confirmed to also occur off Macquarie Island (Australian Antarctic Territories), with a single large specimen collected at 870–979 m depth.

<doc id="633963" wikidata="Q410454" url="?curid=633963" title="Liposome">
<text>A liposome is a small artificial vesicle, spherical in shape, having at least one lipid bilayer. Due to their hydrophobicity and/or hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, particle size and many other properties, liposomes can be used as drug delivery vehicles for administration of pharmaceutical drugs and nutrients, such as lipid nanoparticles in mRNA vaccines, and DNA vaccines. Liposomes can be prepared by disrupting biological membranes (such as by sonication).

Liposomes are most often composed of phospholipids, especially phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol, but may also include other lipids, such as those found in egg and phosphatidylethanolamine, as long as they are compatible with lipid bilayer structure. A liposome design may employ surface ligands for attaching to desired cells or tissues.

Based on vesicle structure, there are seven main categories for liposomes: multilamellar large (MLV), oligolamellar (OLV), small unilamellar (SUV), medium-sized unilamellar (MUV), large unilamellar (LUV), giant unilamellar (GUV) and multivesicular vesicles (MVV). The major types of liposomes are the multilamellar vesicle (MLV, with several lamellar phase lipid bilayers), the small unilamellar liposome vesicle (SUV, with one lipid bilayer), the large unilamellar vesicle (LUV), and the cochleate vesicle. A less desirable form is multivesicular liposomes in which one vesicle contains one or more smaller vesicles.
Liposomes should not be confused with lysosomes, or with micelles and reverse micelles. In contrast to liposomes, micelles typically contain a monolayer of fatty acids or surfactants. 

==Discovery==
The word &quot;liposome&quot; derives from two Greek words: &quot;lipo&quot; (&quot;fat&quot;) and &quot;soma&quot; (&quot;body&quot;); it is so named because its composition is primarily of phospholipid.

Liposomes were first described by British hematologist Alec Douglas Bangham in 1961 at the Babraham Institute, in Cambridge—findings that were published 1964. The discovery came about when Bangham and R. W. Horne were testing the institute&#x27;s new electron microscope by adding negative stain to dry phospholipids. The resemblance to the plasmalemma was obvious, and the microscopic pictures provided the first evidence that the cell membrane is a bilayer lipid structure. The following year, Bangham, his colleague Malcolm Standish, and Gerald Weissmann, an American physician, established the integrity of this closed, bilayer structure and its ability to release its contents following detergent treatment (structure-linked latency). During a Cambridge pub discussion with Bangham, Weissmann first named the structures &quot;liposomes&quot; after something which laboratory had been studying, the lysosome: a simple organelle whose structure-linked latency could be disrupted by detergents and streptolysins. Liposomes are readily distinguishable from micelles and hexagonal lipid phases through negative staining transmission electron microscopy.

Bangham, with colleagues Jeff Watkins and Standish, wrote the 1965 paper that effectively launched what would become the liposome &quot;industry.&quot; Around that same time, Weissmann joined Bangham at the Babraham. Later, Weissmann, then an emeritus professor at New York University School of Medicine, recalled the two of them sitting in a Cambridge pub, reflecting on the role of lipid sheets in separating the cell interior from its exterior milieu. This insight, they felt, would be to cell function what the discovery of the double helix had been to genetics. As Bangham had been calling his lipid structures &quot;multilamellar smectic mesophases,&quot; or sometimes &quot;Banghasomes,&quot; Weissmann proposed the more user-friendly term liposome.

==Mechanism==

=== Encapsulation in liposomes ===
A liposome has an aqueous solution core surrounded by a hydrophobic membrane, in the form of a lipid bilayer; hydrophilic solutes dissolved in the core cannot readily pass through the bilayer. Hydrophobic chemicals associate with the bilayer. This property can be utilized to load liposomes with hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic molecules, a process known as encapsulation. Typically, liposomes are prepared in a solution containing the compound to be trapped, which can either be an aqueous solution for encapsulating hydrophilic compounds like proteins, or solutions in organic solvents mixed with lipids for encapsulating hydrophobic molecules.
Encapsulation techniques can be categorized into two types: passive, which relies on the stochastic trapping of molecules during liposome formation, and active, which relies on the presence of charged lipids or transmembrane ion gradients.
A crucial parameter to consider is the &quot;encapsulation efficiency,&quot; which is defined as the amount of compound present in the liposome solution divided by the total initial amount of compound used during the preparation.
In more recent developments, the application of liposomes in single-molecule experiments has introduced the concept of &quot;single entity encapsulation efficiency.&quot; This term refers to the probability of a specific liposome containing the required number of copies of the compound.

=== Delivery ===
To deliver the molecules to a site of action, the lipid bilayer can fuse with other bilayers such as the cell membrane, thus delivering the liposome contents; this is a complex and non-spontaneous event, however, that does not apply to nutrients and drug delivery. By preparing liposomes in a solution of DNA or drugs (which would normally be unable to diffuse through the membrane) they can be (indiscriminately) delivered past the lipid bilayer. Liposomes can also be designed to deliver drugs in other ways. Liposomes that contain low (or high) pH can be constructed such that dissolved aqueous drugs will be charged in solution (i.e., the pH is outside the drug&#x27;s pI range). As the pH naturally neutralizes within the liposome (protons can pass through some membranes), the drug will also be neutralized, allowing it to freely pass through a membrane. These liposomes work to deliver drug by diffusion rather than by direct cell fusion. However, the efficacy of this pH regulated passage depends on the physiochemical nature of the drug in question (e.g. pKa and having a basic or acid nature), which is very low for many drugs.

A similar approach can be exploited in the biodetoxification of drugs by injecting empty liposomes with a transmembrane pH gradient. In this case the vesicles act as sinks to scavenge the drug in the blood circulation and prevent its toxic effect.
Another strategy for liposome drug delivery is to target endocytosis events. Liposomes can be made in a particular size range that makes them viable targets for natural macrophage phagocytosis. These liposomes may be digested while in the macrophage&#x27;s phagosome, thus releasing its drug. Liposomes can also be decorated with opsonins and ligands to activate endocytosis in other cell types.

Regarding pH-sensitive liposomes, there are three mechanisms of drug delivery intracellularly, which occurs via endocytosis. This is possible because of the acidic environment within endosomes. The first mechanism is through the destabilization of the liposome within the endosome, triggering pore formation on the endosomal membrane and allowing diffusion of the liposome and its contents into the cytoplasm. Another is the release of the encapsulated content within the endosome, eventually diffusing out into the cytoplasm through the endosomal membrane. Lastly, the membrane of the liposome and the endosome fuse together, releasing the encapsulated contents onto the cytoplasm and avoiding degradation at the lysosomal level due to minimal contact time.

Certain anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin (Doxil) and daunorubicin may be administered encapsulated in liposomes. Liposomal cisplatin has received orphan drug designation for pancreatic cancer from EMEA. A study provides a promising preclinical demonstration of the effectiveness and ease of preparation of Valrubicin-loaded immunoliposomes (Val-ILs) as a novel nanoparticle technology. In the context of hematological cancers, Val-ILs have the potential to be used as a precise and effective therapy based on targeted vesicle-mediated cell death. 

The use of liposomes for transformation or transfection of DNA into a host cell is known as lipofection.

In addition to gene and drug delivery applications, liposomes can be used as carriers for the delivery of dyes to textiles, pesticides to plants, enzymes and nutritional supplements to foods, and cosmetics to the skin.

Liposomes are also used as outer shells of some microbubble contrast agents used in contrast-enhanced ultrasound.

==Dietary and nutritional supplements==
Until recently, the clinical uses of liposomes were for targeted drug delivery, but new applications for the oral delivery of certain dietary and nutritional supplements are in development. This new application of liposomes is in part due to the low absorption and bioavailability rates of traditional oral dietary and nutritional tablets and capsules. The low oral bioavailability and absorption of many nutrients is clinically well documented. Therefore, the natural encapsulation of lypophilic and hydrophilic nutrients within liposomes would be an effective method of bypassing the destructive elements of the gastric system and small intestines allowing the encapsulated nutrient to be efficiently delivered to the cells and tissues.

The term nutraceutical combines the words nutrient and pharmaceutical, originally coined by Stephen DeFelice, who defined nutraceuticals as “food or part of a food that provides medical or health benefits, including the prevention and/or treatment of a disease”. However, currently, there is no conclusive definition of nutraceuticals yet, to distinguish them from other food‐derived categories, such as food (dietary) supplements, herbal products, pre‐ and probiotics, functional foods, and fortified foods. Generally, this term is used to describe any product derived from food sources which is expected to provide health benefits additionally to the nutritional value of daily food. A wide range of nutrients or other substances with nutritional or physiological effects (EU Directive 2002/46/EC) might be present in these products, including vitamins, minerals, amino acids, essential fatty acids, fibres and various plants and herbal extracts. Liposomal nutraceuticals contain bioactive compounds with health-promoting effects. The encapsulation of bioactive compounds in liposomes is attractive as liposomes have been shown to be able to overcome serious hurdles bioactives would otherwise encounter in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract upon oral intake.

Certain factors have far-reaching effects on the percentage of liposome that are yielded in manufacturing, as well as the actual amount of realized liposome entrapment and the actual quality and long-term stability of the liposomes themselves. They are the following: (1) The actual manufacturing method and preparation of the liposomes themselves; (2) The constitution, quality, and type of raw phospholipid used in the formulation and manufacturing of the liposomes; (3) The ability to create homogeneous liposome particle sizes that are stable and hold their encapsulated payload. These are the primary elements in developing effective liposome carriers for use in dietary and nutritional supplements.

==Manufacturing==
The choice of liposome preparation method depends, i.a., on the following parameters:
# the physicochemical characteristics of the material to be entrapped and those of the liposomal ingredients;
# the nature of the medium in which the lipid vesicles are dispersed
# the effective concentration of the entrapped substance and its potential toxicity;
# additional processes involved during application/delivery of the vesicles;
# optimum size, polydispersity and shelf-life of the vesicles for the intended application; and,
# batch-to-batch reproducibility and possibility of large-scale production of safe and efficient liposomal products
Useful liposomes rarely form spontaneously. They typically form after supplying enough energy to a dispersion of (phospho)lipids in a polar solvent, such as water, to break down multilamellar aggregates into oligo- or unilamellar bilayer vesicles.

Liposomes can hence be created by sonicating a dispersion of amphipatic lipids, such as phospholipids, in water. Low shear rates create multilamellar liposomes. The original aggregates, which have many layers like an onion, thereby form progressively smaller and finally unilamellar liposomes (which are often unstable, owing to their small size and the sonication-created defects). Sonication is generally considered a &quot;gross&quot; method of preparation as it can damage the structure of the drug to be encapsulated. Newer methods such as extrusion, micromixing and Mozafari method are employed to produce materials for human use. Using lipids other than phosphatidylcholine can greatly facilitate liposome preparation.

==Prospect==

Further advances in liposome research have been able to allow liposomes to avoid detection by the body&#x27;s immune system, specifically, the cells of reticuloendothelial system (RES). These liposomes are known as &quot;stealth liposomes&quot;. They were first proposed by G. Cevc and G. Blume and, independently and soon thereafter, the groups of L. Huang and Vladimir Torchilin and are constructed with PEG (Polyethylene Glycol) studding the outside of the membrane. The PEG coating, which is inert in the body, allows for longer circulatory life for the drug delivery mechanism. Studies have also shown that PEGylated liposomes elicit anti-IgM antibodies, thus leading to an enhanced blood clearance of the liposomes upon re-injection, depending on lipid dose and time interval between injections. In addition to a PEG coating, some stealth liposomes also have some sort of biological species attached as a ligand to the liposome, to enable binding via a specific expression on the targeted drug delivery site. These targeting ligands could be monoclonal antibodies (making an immunoliposome), vitamins, or specific antigens, but must be accessible. Targeted liposomes can target certain cell type in the body and deliver drugs that would otherwise be systemically delivered. Naturally toxic drugs can be much less systemically toxic if delivered only to diseased tissues. Polymersomes, morphologically related to liposomes, can also be used this way. Also morphologically related to liposomes are highly deformable vesicles, designed for non-invasive transdermal material delivery, known as transfersomes.

Liposomes are used as models for artificial cells. 

Liposomes can be used on their own or in combination with traditional antibiotics as neutralizing agents of bacterial toxins. Many bacterial toxins evolved to target specific lipids of the host cells membrane and can be baited and neutralized by liposomes containing those specific lipid targets.

A study published in May 2018 also explored the potential use of liposomes as &quot;nano-carriers&quot; of fertilizing nutrients to treat malnourished or sickly plants. Results showed that these synthetic particles &quot;soak into plant leaves more easily than naked nutrients&quot;, further validating the utilization of nanotechnology to increase crop yields.

Machine learning has started to contribute to liposome research. For example, deep learning was used to monitor a multistep bioassay containing sucrose-loaded and nucleotides-loaded liposomes interacting with a lipid membrane-perforating peptide. Artificial neural networks were also used to optimize formulation parameters of leuprolide acetate loaded liposomes
and to predict the particle size and the polydispersity index of liposomes.

<text>Umbrella octopuses (family Opisthoteuthidae) are a group of pelagic octopuses. Umbrella octopuses are characterized by a web of skin between the arms, causing them to somewhat resemble an opened umbrella when the arms are spread.

== Description ==
Opisthoteuthidae are a group of octopuses characterized by a web of skin in between their arms. They broad U-shaped shell that support muscles for a pair of small fins on the mantle, these fins are far less developed than other families in Cirrina and essentially only act as stabilizers when the animal swims (using a medusoid motion of the arms and webbing). This structure makes the umbrella octopus resemble an umbrella when they spread their arms/web out. The structure of the umbrella octopus has the oral surface below the mantle of the octopuses and the web with their arms surround the bottom of the mantle. Their outer skin has a very delicate consistency that results in white spots appearing on their skin when damaged. Although Opisthoteuthidae are categorized as cirrates, unlike the other cirrates, they do not have an intermediate web; rather, they use the web in between their arms to mimic the intermediate web that other cirrates have. Lacking an intermediate web is what causes the indentations in the outer edge of their arms that make them look like an umbrella.

== Behavior ==

=== Defense mechanisms ===
Opisthoteuthidae lack an intermediate web but they mimic the defensive mechanism of ballooning by extending the web between their arms as much as possible and curving the outer edges of their arms inwards in order to have the edges touch the ground. They also extend their fins parallel to the floor to help keep their balance or they curve them around their mantle. Opisthoteuthidae have been observed to hold this position for five and a half minutes. Another defensive mechanism that Opisthoteuthidae have been observed using is web-inversion which is when they have their arms turned upwards and their web with the oral surface facing outwards. The oral surface can be facing the floor, or the octopuses may lie laterally so their side is in contact with the floor. It has been noted that these defensive behaviors are the positions the octopuses may go into while feeding as well, but it is possible that this could be because of the stress of being captured and placed in an aquarium to be observed.

=== Resting behavior ===
When resting at the floor, the octopus&#x27;s behavior falls into one of two tactics: bottom-resting or flat-spreading. Bottom-resting is when the octopus is resting near the floor. It will erect its mantle, curve the outer edges of its arms inwards to have them be the only part making contact with the floor. The fins are extended out parallel to the bottom to maintain balance. When flat-spreading they spread their arms and web, so it is parallel to the bottom and they keep the edges of their arms curved inwards. Their heads will point backwards at a small angle and their fins will be used for stabilization.

== Dispersion ==
Opisthoteuthidae are deep sea creatures that have been found in the Clipperton-Clarion Fracture Zone in the Pacific Ocean at a depth of about 4,800 m. They have also been found in the South China Sea. They stay within 3,000-4,000 meters below sea level and try to stay hovering over the ocean floor.

==Taxonomy==
Family Opisthoteuthidae has classically contained a single genus, &quot;Opisthoteuthis&quot;, which has recently been split into three genera on the basis of differences in enlarged suckers on male specimens. Genera &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot;, &quot;Luteuthis&quot;, and &quot;Cryptoteuthis&quot; now are included in the family Grimpoteuthidae.

<doc id="633969" wikidata="Q466950" url="?curid=633969" title="American Society of Mechanical Engineers">
<text>The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) is an American professional association that, in its own words, &quot;promotes the art, science, and practice of multidisciplinary engineering and allied sciences around the globe&quot; via &quot;continuing education, training and professional development, codes and standards, research, conferences and publications, government relations, and other forms of outreach.&quot; ASME is thus an engineering society, a standards organization, a research and development organization, an advocacy organization, a provider of training and education, and a nonprofit organization. Founded as an engineering society focused on mechanical engineering in North America, ASME is today multidisciplinary and global.

ASME has over 85,000 members in more than 135 countries worldwide.

ASME was founded in 1880 by Alexander Lyman Holley, Henry Rossiter Worthington, John Edison Sweet and Matthias N. Forney in response to numerous steam boiler pressure vessel failures. Known for setting codes and standards for mechanical devices, ASME conducts one of the world&#x27;s largest technical publishing operations. It holds numerous technical conferences and hundreds of professional development courses each year and sponsors numerous outreach and educational programs. Georgia Tech president and women engineer supporter Blake R Van Leer was an executive member. Kate Gleason and Lydia Weld were the first two women members.

== Codes and standards ==

ASME is one of the oldest standards-developing organizations in America. It produces approximately 600 codes and standards covering many technical areas, such as fasteners, plumbing fixtures, elevators, pipelines, and power plant systems and components. ASME&#x27;s standards are developed by committees of subject matter experts using an open, consensus-based process. Many ASME standards are cited by government agencies as tools to meet their regulatory objectives. ASME standards are therefore voluntary, unless the standards have been incorporated into a legally binding business contract or incorporated into regulations enforced by an authority having jurisdiction, such as a federal, state, or local government agency. ASME&#x27;s standards are used in more than 100 countries and have been translated into numerous languages.

== Boiler and pressure vessel code ==

The largest ASME standard, both in size and in the number of volunteers involved in its preparation, is the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC). The BPVC provides rules for the design, fabrication, installation, inspection, care, and use of boilers, pressure vessels, and nuclear components. The code also includes standards on materials, welding and brazing procedures and qualifications, nondestructive examination, and nuclear in-service inspection.

== Other notable standardization areas ==

Other Notable Standardization Areas include but not limited to are; Elevators and Escalators (A17 Series), Overhead and Mobile Cranes and related lifting and rigging equipment (B30 Series), Piping and Pipelines (B31 Series), Bio-processing Equipment (BPE), Valves Flanges, Fittings and Gaskets (B16), Nuclear Components and Processes Performance Test Codes.

== Publications ==
=== Journals ===

The journals published by ASME include:

* &quot;Applied Mechanics Reviews&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Applied Mechanics&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Biomechanical Engineering&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Dynamic Systems Measurement &amp; Control&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Fluids Engineering&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Heat Transfer&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Engineering Systems&quot;

=== Magazine ===

In addition to academic journals, since 1880 the ASME has also published the magazine &quot;Mechanical Engineering&quot;.

==Society awards==
ASME offers four categories of awards: achievement awards to recognize &quot;eminently distinguished engineering achievement&quot;; literature awards for original papers; service awards for voluntary service to ASME; and unit awards, jointly awarded by six societies in recognition of advancement in the field of transportation.

=== ASME Fellows ===

ASME Fellow is a Membership Grade of Distinction conferred by The ASME Committee of Past Presidents to an ASME member with significant publications or innovations and distinguished scientific and engineering background. Over 3,000 members have attained the grade of Fellow. The ASME Fellow membership grade is the highest elected grade in ASME.

==E-Fests==

ASME runs several annual E-Fests, or Engineering Festivals, taking the place of the Student Professional Development Conference (SPDC) series. In addition to the Human Powered Vehicle Challenge (HPVC), the Innovative Additive Manufacturing 3D Challenge (IAM3D), the Student Design Competition, and the Old Guard Competition, there are also talks, interactive workshops, and entertainment. These events allows students to network with working engineers, host contests, and promote ASME&#x27;s benefits to students as well as professionals. E-Fests are held in four regions in the United States and internationally—western U.S, eastern U.S., Asia Pacific, and South America—with the E-Fest location for each region changing every year.

==Student competitions==

ASME holds a variety of competitions every year for engineering students from around the world.

* Human Powered Vehicle Challenge (HPVC)
* Student Design Competition (SDC)
* Innovative Design Simulation Challenge (IDSC)
* Innovative Additive Manufacturing 3D Challenge (IAM3D)
* Old Guard Competitions
* Innovation Showcase (IShow)
* Student Design Expositions

== Organization ==

ASME has four key offices in the United States, including its headquarters operation in New York, N.Y., and three international offices in Beijing, China; Brussels, Belgium, and New Delhi, India. ASME has two institutes and 32 technical divisions within its organizational structure. Volunteer activity is organized into four sectors: 

* Technical Events and Content
* Public Affairs and Outreach
* Standards and Certification
* Student and Early Career Development

==Controversy==
In 1982, ASME was found to be the first non-profit organization to in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The United States Supreme Court found the organization liable for more than $6 million in &quot;American Society of Mechanical Engineers v. Hydrolevel Corp.&quot;

<text>Stauroteuthis is a genus of deepwater cirrate octopus, a cephalopod mollusk. This is the only genus in the family Stauroteuthidae, and only three species have been described in this genus.

The organisms live below water depth; although sometimes found as deep as underwater, they generally live at a water depth of around . They do not possess a radula.

The stauroteuthids have the distinction of being one of the few bioluminescent octopuses; some of the muscle cells that control the suckers in most species have been replaced with photophores which are believed to fool prey by directing them towards the mouth.

==Species==
* &quot;Stauroteuthis gilchristi&quot; (Robson, 1924): Known from two localities in the south Atlantic, and other southern ocean locations (Macquarie Island, and Kerguelen).
* &quot;Stauroteuthis syrtensis&quot; Verrill, 1879: Widespread in the North Atlantic. The population size of &quot;S. syrtensis&quot; is unknown.
* &quot;Stauroteuthis kengrahami&quot; Verhoeff, 2023: Known from a single specimen off eastern Australia.

<text>Most Extreme Elimination Challenge (MXC) is an American comedy television program that aired on TNN/Spike TV from April 19, 2003 to February 9, 2007. It is a re-purpose of footage from the Japanese game show &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;, which originally aired in Japan from 1986 to 1990. The re-purposed &quot;MXC&quot; created a completely new premise, storyline, and characters, with two teams competing against each other &quot;à la&quot; a typical team sports broadcast and players trying to win points for their teams by surviving through different challenges. In the original program the Count and his underlings would follow the progress of the players as they moved through the course. In the re-purpose Count Takeshi became veteran network announcer Vic Romano and the Count&#x27;s flunky became young upstart Kenny Blankenship.

&quot;Most Extreme Elimination Challenge&quot; was created and produced by RC Entertainment, Inc. (Paul Abeyta and Peter Kaikko) in Los Angeles, California, and Larry Strawther (a writer and producer on a number of network sitcoms). The three were friends who had worked together at Merv Griffin Productions in the late 1970s. Strawther was a staffer on &quot;Dance Fever&quot;, which Abeyta took over as executive producer the following season, while Strawther stayed with &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;. Between jobs they would occasionally try to create their own projects. One of these was the 1990s talk show spoof &quot;Night Stand with Dick Dietrick&quot;. &quot;MXC&quot; is the property of both Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) and RC Entertainment. The 2004 special episode &quot;MXC Almost Live&quot; is the property of Viacom International and was filmed in Orlando, Florida, by the producers of &quot;MXC&quot;.

==Episodes==

The premise of &quot;Most Extreme Elimination Challenge&quot; (as distinct from &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;) is a game show that is hosted by the eccentric characters Vic Romano (Vic Wilson) and Kenny Blankenship (Chris Darga), along with the field marshal Captain Tenneal (John Cervenka) and the field reporter Guy LeDouche (John Cervenka). The announcer (John Cervenka) would begin each episode with this standard introduction:

When the show was transitioning away from its full name, it briefly added &quot;Most Extreme Elimination Challenge!&quot; to the end of the opening.

Eventually, the opening introduction was changed to:

Usually, two or three teams of contestants compete in several turn-based and head-to-head challenges. The only episode done without a competitive team base was the first episode ever made, which was simply centered around the stereotypical antics of college girls. Even though this was the first episode made, it was the seventh episode of season one to air. Most other competitive teams do not truly have a real-life rivalry (e.g., Season 1, Episode 2 &quot;Donors vs Addicts&quot;), while others such as Democrats vs Republicans vs Third Party do.

The contestants compete in a variety of challenges, usually four per episode, but occasionally as many as six. The challenges are extremely hard, and a majority of the contestants fail to complete the challenges. Throughout the show, painful failures to complete challenges are reviewed by Vic and Kenny in the &quot;&quot;MXC&quot; Impact Replay&quot; (briefly given sponsor names like the &quot;Snickers Satisfies Replay&quot; and the &quot;Slim Jim Snap of the Day&quot;), which is essentially a sports-themed playback feature. Occasionally, the Impact Replay is used for Kenny&#x27;s pleasure, in looking at the female contestants, items, or random events in the series which he finds funny or disappointing. Contestants who do complete a challenge earn points for their team. The team with the most points at the end of the episode wins the competition. At the end of each episode, Kenny counts down the ten &quot;Most Painful Eliminations of the Day&quot;, which usually focus on the events shown in the Impact Replay, but sometimes includes random events that involved the main or recurring characters.

Kenny and Vic, along with any other people around them at the end of the show, all end the episode by saying: &quot;Don&#x27;t get eliminated!&quot; initiated by one of the two asking &quot;What do we always say?&quot;

===&quot;MXC Almost Live&quot; and other special episodes===
On April 22, 2004, Spike TV aired a special edition of the show to start the third season, featuring skateboarder Tony Hawk and snowboarder Tara Dakides. The special was taped at the Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, Florida, using students from nearby colleges and dubbed MXC Almost Live. The special edition is not based on the original &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; footage, but only has some added in for Vic, Ken, the Captain, and Guy LeDouche. Actors were hired to play those who would replace the roles of the latter two, named &quot;Major Babe&quot; (Michelle Sorrell) and &quot;Gip LeDouche&quot; (Eric Esteban).

Three other special episodes aired, all from Season 2, including a special nighttime episode, a &quot;Monsters vs. Mascots&quot; episode, and a special winter episode.

Spike initially held a contest in 2005 or 2006 in which the winner was to have his name and the name of five of his friends used in an episode of &quot;MXC&quot; and would also receive a viewing party of that episode for up to 50 people at a place of his choice. However, this contest never fully materialized and was canceled for unknown reasons.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
*Vic Romano (voiced by Victor Wilson) is the co-host and play-by-play commentator. In Takeshi&#x27;s Castle, Vic&#x27;s character is Count Takeshi himself, the main character of the show. In &quot;MXC&quot;, Vic is level-headed, has a dark past of alcohol abuse, failed marriages, and various addictions, and generally treats &quot;MXC&quot; as a serious competition. Vic was once also a professional baseball player who became addicted to &quot;everything&quot;, including every type of drug, alcohol, and easy women. He was a former news anchor who lost his job because &quot;the scotch made the teleprompter blurry&quot; and once was an airline pilot during his stint of alcohol abuse, but states: &quot;Luckily, nobody noticed.&quot; Notable catchphrases include &quot;Right you are, Ken!&quot;, &quot;Good to know!&quot;, &quot;I think you might be right, Ken!&quot;, &quot;Indeed!&quot;, and &quot;Kenny!&quot;, which is usually followed by him smacking Kenny&#x27;s head with a paper fan, in response to Kenny&#x27;s commentary of the action. He&#x27;s especially fond of his 1974 AMC Matador coupe. The character is played by Japanese actor and movie director Takeshi Kitano, who also created the original series from which &quot;MXC&quot; takes its footage, &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle.&quot;
*Kenny Blankenship (voiced by Chris Darga) is Vic&#x27;s co-host and color commentator. Blankenship is a high-school dropout whose uncle owns the network. Kenny&#x27;s character is very unprofessional about hosting, far less serious about the job than Vic&#x27;s character is. Despite his non-professional, simplistic stand-point, he claims to make ten times the amount that Vic does because of his uncle being one of the network bosses. Kenny has also been stated to own a condo complex from all the money that he earns from hosting and drives a Volkswagen Jetta. During hosting, in addition to providing additional information on each competitor or what entity they are a part of, Kenny usually spends his time commenting on the sexual appeal of the female competitors and how much he likes beer, pizza, and seeing the majority of competitors wipe out. Kenny&#x27;s character was originally played by Japanese politician and comedian Hideo Higashikokubaru.
*Captain Tenneal (voiced by John Cervenka), whose name comes from the 1970s musical act Captain &amp; Tennille, is the field marshal who conducts the contestants through each challenge with a sharp &quot;Get it on!&quot; (in the manner of former TV judge and boxing referee Mills Lane, whose courtroom show appeared on The Nashville Network, the predecessor of Spike TV). Near the beginning of each &quot;MXC&quot; episode, he is seen addressing the contestants as a group, asking whether some broad assertion relating to one of the topics in the episode is true. After the contestants raise their hands to show agreement, the Captain usually declares &quot;Well, you&#x27;re wrong!&quot;, but in a few episodes, he actually agrees with the contestants. He&#x27;ll sometimes defend his opinion by saying, &quot;Of course I&#x27;m right, I&#x27;m the Captain!&quot; After further explanation and give-and-take with individual contestants, he bellows &quot;Let&#x27;s go!&quot; and leads the contestants forward to begin playing the games. Captain Tenneal usually displays traditional attitudes towards social issues and speaks formally (calling Vic and Kenny &quot;Victor&quot; and &quot;Kenneth,&quot; respectively) and takes pride in both his military service and modest pension. He is the author of a best-selling book (&quot;Well, you&#x27;re wrong!&quot;) and is not above trading suggestive innuendo with the female competitors, almost all of whom are interested in him romantically. Captain Tenneal is played by Hayato Tani.
*Guy LeDouche (pronounced &quot;gee&quot; as in &quot;geezer&quot;, and also voiced by Cervenka) is the &quot;MXC&quot; field reporter. He is portrayed wearing a pith helmet and his personality is that of a deranged and maniacal pervert of suggested French descent who has an omnisexual orientation, as he makes passes to many of the contestants he interviews, regardless of gender. Almost any interaction with the contestants arouses Guy, even those where they do violence to him, and he will respond with, &quot;Guy like!&quot;, and sometimes responds with maniacal laughter. In addition to this, he is seen to have a romantic interest in Captain Tenneal, always calling him &quot;Skipper&quot;. He has other family member interviewers who show the same behavior, such as &quot;Lyndon&quot; (which plays off political figure Lyndon LaRouche), &quot;Geek&quot;, &quot;Giddy&quot;, &quot;Gip&quot;, &quot;Goon&quot;, &quot;Gawp&quot;, and &quot;Gawk&quot;, along with females named &quot;Gay&quot;, &quot;Grandmama&quot;, &quot;Gab&quot;, &quot;Gin&quot;, &quot;Gidget&quot;, and &quot;Gal&quot;, with an unrelated reporter named Al Frankincense. Guy is played by Junji Inagawa. The family (and Al) is voiced by John Cervenka (male) and Mary Scheer (female). Guy, and his family members, along with interviewing contestants, will also announce the games that will be played in each episode, and will sometimes explain one or more of the games&#x27; objectives.

===Recurring characters===
The following are characters who have established a semi-consistent name. However, their names may change to fit in with a show&#x27;s theme or style of game.

*&quot;Danny Glands&quot; (Cervenka), whose name is a play on the name of long-time Las Vegas entertainer Danny Gans, is an &quot;MXC&quot; staffer who works in many of the games. His primary responsibilities include asking questions in &quot;Finger It&quot; (later renamed &quot;Hand Job&quot;), knocking down contestants in &quot;Brass Balls&quot;, and launching the soccer balls in &quot;Dirty Balls&quot;. He was also known as &quot;Jimmy Junk&quot;, &quot;Sugar Ramos Phiss&quot;, &quot;Golden Shower Boy&quot;, &quot;Barry Sosa&quot;, and &quot;Spin&quot;. The original actor is early 1980s J-Pop star Michiru Jo; he is notably skinny, and his voice actor adopts a nasal, nerdy tone.
*&quot;Skanky&quot; is a samurai who punishes contestants who fail to complete the &quot;Wall Bangers&quot; game, and sometimes also the &quot;Tumbling Dominoes of Doom&quot; and &quot;Clear Sphere of Fear&quot; games.

*&quot;Chief Otto Parts&quot; (a parody of the Chief Auto Parts auto supply store chain) is a Native American who taunts the contestants in &quot;Rotating Surfboard of Death&quot;.
*&quot;Em on Em&quot; (a spoof of rapper Eminem) is a set of twin rappers dressed in rainbow ponchos and bowler hats. The main games in which these characters participate include &quot;Tumbling Dominos of Doom&quot; and &quot;Irritable Bowl Syndrome&quot;. The characters are also known as &quot;Babe and Ruth&quot;, &quot;Bud and Pud&quot;, and &quot;Jessie and Jackson&quot; among others. They are played by identical twins Shoji and Shoichi Kinoshita. In one of the episodes, a contestant was said to have the name Marshall Mathers.
*The &quot;Baba Ganoosh Family&quot; is a family of contestants from the Middle East who appear in nearly every episode. The last name &quot;Baba Ganoosh&quot; became a popular running gag throughout the series. It comes from Chris Darga&#x27;s Lebanese heritage, in which &quot;baba ganoush&quot; is a popular entree.
*The &quot;Brown Spider&quot; taunts contestants in various games, including &quot;Wall Buggers&quot; and &quot;Dash to Death&quot;. Usually played by Brad Lesley (also known as Brad Leslie).
*&quot;Herbie the Steamy Pile&quot; is a strange, brown creature who taunts and sprays fallen contestants with a fire-extinguisher in &quot;Buck Off!&quot;
*&quot;The Zygote Brothers&quot; are identical characters that appear in the game &quot;Dash to Death&quot;. They attempt to distract the contestants and knock them into the water as they run through the obstacle course.
*&quot;Levi Palmer&quot; is the only American to compete on and win a game of MXC, he is heavily featured in the episode starring Howard Stern&#x27;s wack pack.
*&quot;Sporky&quot; played by Shozo &quot;Strong&quot; Kobayashi is a character featured in the game &quot;Dash to Death&quot;. Hiding inside a jail cell near the &quot;spinner&quot; obstacle, Sporky taunts contestants as they pass by. If contestants fail in the area of the course around him, Sporky is usually credited with distracting the contestant into falling off the course.
*&quot;The Diddler&quot; is a character exclusive to the game &quot;Little Man in the Boat&quot;. If contestants don&#x27;t go far enough on the course, The Diddler appears out of nowhere and pushes the contestant off and into the water.
*&quot;Series Announcer&quot; John Cervenka became the announcer for the entire series after replacing Jamie Alcroft who only announced the first four episodes.

==Production==
In the show, the contestants&#x27; names are usually slightly altered names of celebrities, network bosses, or family members and friends of the producers or voice actors. Several recurring names appear in the show; the most common family name is &quot;Babaganoosh&quot;, since the producers of &quot;MXC&quot; were given short deadlines for producing episodes, therefore giving them limited time to write the scripts.

During the production of the show, the network bosses stated that they did not want the producers to repeat games from episode to episode, but the producers ignored this, knowing 1) they didn&#x27;t have the rights to enough episodes at the time to not repeat, and 2) some of the games (especially &quot;Log Drop&quot; and &quot;Sinkers or Floaters&quot;) proved to be interesting and funny every time. Some fan-favorite and recurring games included &quot;Log Drop&quot;, &quot;Wall Bangers&quot;, &quot;Dope on a Rope&quot;, &quot;Rotating Surfboard of Death&quot;, and &quot;Sinkers and Floaters&quot;, among many others.

While the basic premise of &quot;MXC&quot; is that of a legitimate game show, its true premise is that of a comedy not intended to be taken literally. All original audio was stripped from each show for legal reasons, and all audio was added by producer-writers and an audio technician, leaving none of the original audio from &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle.&quot; The script is completely unrelated to the original Japanese dialogue; both Abeyta and Strawther&#x27;s original notes deliberately avoided any references to Japanese or Asian culture. Some thought the only Japanese-related, albeit loosely, term used for the show was the name &quot;Most Extreme Elimination Challenge&quot;, which has a Japanese-like naming style. But Strawther noted that the title – pitched by Abeyta – was a spoof on network buying tendencies of the time – &quot;Extreme sports were big and the term was being thrown around everywhere. We thought it was funny to use &quot;Most Extreme.&quot; All the producers and writers admit that they had no knowledge of what the contestants or actors were originally saying during the filming of &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;. Nonetheless, the producer-writer&#x27;s ability to match the original Japanese dialog and action to something completely unrelated in English was uncanny. &quot;MXC&quot;&#x27;s early scripts spoofed pop culture, or mocked various celebrities, athletes, sports announcers, politicians, with the occasional sexual pun. In later seasons, with network encouragement, sexual puns and references took on a much larger role, to the dismay of some of the show&#x27;s producers who felt the cheap jokes led to its demise earlier than necessary. Contestants are given seemingly incongruous but humorous names and occupations based on their team and physical appearance (e.g. Sal Bloomberg from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, a meat handler team member in the Season 1 episode &quot;Meat Handlers vs. Cartoon Voice Actors&quot;, aka &quot;Network Boss&quot;). In addition, the various challenges are all given humorous names, such as &quot;Sinkers &amp; Floaters&quot; or &quot;Wall Bangers&quot;. Any water or mud used in a challenge is given humorous names from Kenny and Vic, notably &quot;safety fluid&quot;, with Kenny usually following it with a more specific name (e.g. &quot;runoff from &quot;&quot; chili cook off&quot;). The footage for a single episode of &quot;MXC&quot; can come from multiple episodes of &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;, and occasionally the same footage, including challenges, will be used in multiple episodes with different character names and dialogue. Unlike international editions of &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;, the original text that appeared on screen is left as is.

All four of the producer-performer-writers on the series are alumni of the famous &quot;Groundlings&quot; comedy troupe in Hollywood: John Cervenka, Christopher Darga, Mary Scheer, and Victor Wilson. The creators/Exec Producers Paul Abeyta and Larry Strawther had worked together at Merv Griffin Productions in the late 1970s. Strawther had worked on the company&#x27;s pilots for the re-boot of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Dance Fever&quot; in 1978. When both shows sold Strawther went with &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; as its head writer and Abeyta came over to Griffin&#x27;s talk show and became executive producer of &quot;Dance Fever&quot;. Kaikko worked for &quot;Dance Fever&quot;&#x27;s distributor, 20th Century Fox, and while overseeing that show he struck up a longtime friendship and business partnership with Abeyta. Kaikko and Abeyta teamed to co-create and Executive Produce the original series &quot;Burt Luddin&#x27;s Love Buffet&quot; on Game Show Network which starred John Cervenka. Strawther went on to write and produce network sitcoms, including &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, &quot;Night Court&quot;, and &quot;My Sister Sam&quot; and some movies like &quot;Without a Clue&quot;, but between jobs he would work with Abeyta and Kaikko on specific projects that seemed fun to him. Cervenka was also the announcer for &quot;Love Connection&quot; from 1990 (replacing Johnny Gilbert) until 1994 (the cancellation of the original version hosted by Chuck Woolery and again from 1998 to 1999 with Pat Bullard.

==Home video releases==
==Lawsuits==
The American gameshow &quot;Wipeout&quot; on ABC was accused of being &quot;a blatant copycat&quot; of shows such as &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; and &quot;Most Extreme Elimination Challenge&quot;, and a copyright infringement lawsuit was filed by Tokyo Broadcasting System against ABC in late 2008, claiming the obstacle-course game show closely resembled several Japanese shows. It alleged &quot;Wipeout&quot; violated its copyrights to shows such as &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; and &quot;Ninja Warrior&quot;.

The Japanese network later sued Dutch entertainment giant Endemol, which produces &quot;Wipeout&quot;.

The companies settled the case on November 30, 2011, after meeting with a federal magistrate judge in Los Angeles. No settlement terms were filed with the court.

<text>The Truth Machine (1996) is a science fiction novel by James L. Halperin about a genius who invents an infallible lie detector. Soon, every citizen must pass a thorough test under a Truth Machine to get a job or receive any sort of license. Eventually, people begin wearing them all the time, thus eliminating dishonesty in all parts of human interaction, and eliminating crime, terrorism and a great deal of general social problems.

==Plot==
The novel primarily focuses on the life story of Randall Peterson &quot;Pete&quot; Armstrong, a child prodigy with total recall memory, whose entire life&#x27;s outlook has been defined by the tragic murder of his younger brother, Leonard, by an ex-convict who was believed to be capable of committing violent crimes again, but could not be imprisoned any longer under the current law structure. Pete is committed to making a difference for humanity that will atone for his brother&#x27;s death and help millions of others, too. In his first year at Harvard at the age 13, Pete is recruited to enroll in a small, but exclusive, class of the brightest and most agile students on campus. In that class, he meets people and establishes friendships that will further his identity. It is there that the idea of a &#x27;truth machine&#x27; is conceived and Pete realizes that its existence is possible and that he could do it. The &#x27;truth machine&#x27; would be a mechanism that would be 100% accurate in determining if a person was lying or telling the truth. It could help eliminate crime and dishonesty in general. As long as it is employed universally (and not just by government officials), the &#x27;truth machine&#x27; could revolutionize humanity and take it to that next evolutionary step which would help it avert its coming self-destruction.

The protagonist places a back door in the book&#x27;s otherwise infallible lie detector, allowing him to avoid detection when he repeats fragments of Walt Whitman&#x27;s poem &quot;O Captain! My Captain!&quot; in his mind.

==Reception==
The novel was originally self-published but eventually was picked up by Random House.

The novel was extremely popular for several years, rising to #2 on Amazon.com at one point and selling several hundred thousand copies worldwide. It is still in print. In 2005 it was announced that the book was in development as a major motion picture at Lions Gate.

<text>In the Book of Mormon, Ishmael1 () is the righteous friend of the prophet Lehi in Jerusalem. When Lehi takes his family into the wilderness, Lehi brings Ishmael and his family too. The daughters of Ishmael marry the sons of Lehi, but the sons of Ishmael join Laman and Lemuel in their rebellion against Nephi. Ishmael dies in the wilderness, and is buried at Nahom. (&quot;See Archaeology and the Book of Mormon&quot;) After their arrival in the Americas, the children of Ishmael side with the Lamanites, except for those daughters who married Sam, Nephi, and Zoram1.

A second Ishmael2 is the grandfather of Amulek.

==Name==
According to Hugh Nibley, the proverbial ancestor of the Arabs is Ishmael. His name is one of the few Old Testament names which is also at home in ancient Arabia: &quot;[Thus] in Lehi&#x27;s friend &quot;Ishmael&quot; (1 Nephi 7:2) we surely have a man of the desert. The interesting thing is that Nephi takes Ishmael (unlike Zoram) completely for granted, never explaining who he is or how he fits into the picture--the act of sending for him seems to be the most natural thing in the world, as does the marriage of his daughters with Lehi&#x27;s sons. Since it has ever been the custom among the desert people for a man to marry the daughter of his paternal uncle (bint &#x27;ammi), it is hard to avoid the impression that Lehi and Ishmael were related. There is a remarkable association between the names of Lehi and Ishmael which ties them both to the southern desert, where the legendary birthplace and central shrine of Ishmael was at a place called Be&#x27;er Lehai-ro&#x27;i.&quot;

==Family==
According to John L. Sorenson, both Ishmael&#x27;s sons had &quot;families&quot; (1 Nephi 7:6) who accompanied them. The term &quot;families&quot; implies a wife and at least one child each, but there likely were more children.

==Book of Mormon Movie==
In &quot;The Book of Mormon Movie, Vol. 1: The Journey&quot;, adapted from First and Second Nephi, Ishmael was portrayed by Ron Frederickson. The portrayals were highly influenced by Arnold Friberg paintings of the characters.

<text>The Palisades, also called the New Jersey Palisades or the Hudson River Palisades, are a line of steep cliffs along the west side of the lower Hudson River in Northeastern New Jersey and Southeastern New York in the United States. The cliffs stretch north from Jersey City about 20 miles (32 km) to near Nyack, New York, and are visible at Haverstraw, New York. They rise nearly vertically from near the edge of the river, and are about high at Weehawken, increasing gradually to high near their northern terminus. North of Fort Lee, the Palisades are part of Palisades Interstate Park and are a National Natural Landmark.

The Palisades are among the most dramatic geologic features in the vicinity of New York City, forming a canyon of the Hudson north of the George Washington Bridge, as well as providing a vista of the Manhattan skyline. They sit in the Newark Basin, a rift basin located mostly in New Jersey.

&quot;Palisade&quot; is derived from the same root as the word &quot;pole&quot;, ultimately from the Latin word &quot;palus&quot;, meaning stake. A &quot;palisade&quot; is, in general, a defensive fence or wall made up of wooden stakes or tree trunks. The Lenape called the cliffs &quot;rocks that look like rows of trees&quot;, a phrase that became &quot;Weehawken&quot;, the namesake of a town in New Jersey that sits at the top of the cliffs across from Midtown Manhattan.

==Geology==
The basalt cliffs are the margin of a diabase sill, formed about 200 million years ago, at the close of the Triassic period, by the intrusion of molten magma upward into sandstone. The molten material cooled and solidified before reaching the surface. Water erosion of the softer sandstone left behind the columnar structure of harder rock that exists today. The cliffs are about 300 ft (100 m) thick in sections and originally may have reached 1,000 ft (300 m).

The end-Triassic extinction event that coincided with the formation of the Hudson Palisades, Central Atlantic magmatic province, 200 million years ago ranks second in severity of the five major extinction episodes that span geologic time. 

Franklyn Van Houten completed groundbreaking research on a rock formation known as the Newark Basin. His discovery of a consistent geological pattern in which lake levels rose and fell is now known as the &quot;Van Houten cycle&quot;.

==History==
The Palisades appear on the first European map of the New World, made by Gerardus Mercator in 1541 based on the description given him by Giovanni da Verrazzano, who suggested they look like a &quot;fence of stakes&quot;.

During the early stages of the American Revolution, British military commander Lord Cornwallis landed a force of between 2,500 and 5,000 at Huyler&#x27;s Landing on November 20, 1776. In an effort to ambush American general George Washington and crush the rebellion in the wake of the rebels&#x27; defeat in the Battle of Long Island and the Battle of Fort Washington, Cornwallis marched his men up the steep Palisades and southward through the Northern Valley. Washington, stationed near Fort Lee, was alerted to the ambush effort by an unknown horseback patriot, remembered only as the Closter Rider, and successfully fled west through Englewood and over the Hackensack River, avoiding capture in what is remembered as Washington&#x27;s Retreat.

The Palisades were the site of 18 documented duels and probably many unrecorded ones in the years 1798–1845. The most famous is the Burr–Hamilton duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, which took place in a spot known as the Heights of Weehawken on July 11, 1804.

An English visitor, Fanny Trollope, in her 1832 book &quot;Domestic Manners of the Americans&quot;, wrote of a park established at the Palisades by a Hoboken ferryboat entrepreneur at that time:

It is hardly possible to imagine one of greater attraction; a broad belt of light underwood and flowering shrubs, studded at intervals with lofty forest trees, runs for two miles along a cliff which overhangs the matchless Hudson; sometimes it feathers the rocks down to its very margin, and at others leaves a pebbly shore, just rude enough to break the gentle waves, and make a music which mimics softly the loud chorus of the ocean. Through this beautiful little wood, a broad well gravelled terrace is led by every point which can exhibit the scenery to advantage; narrower and wilder paths diverge at intervals, some into the deeper shadow of the wood, and some shelving gradually to the pretty coves below.

The price of entrance to this little Eden, is the six cents you pay at the ferry.

After the Civil War, signs advertising patent medicines and other products covered the rock face in letters high.

In the 19th century, the cliffs were heavily quarried for railroad ballast, leading to local efforts to preserve them. Beginning in the 1890s, several unsuccessful efforts were made to turn much of the Highlands into a forest preserve. Fearing that they would soon be put out of business, quarry operators responded by working faster: in March 1898 alone, more than three tons of dynamite was used to bring down Washington Head and Indian Head in Fort Lee, New Jersey, producing several million cubic yards of traprock. The following year, work by the New Jersey Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs led to the creation of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, headed by George W. Perkins, which was authorized to acquire land between Fort Lee and Piermont, New York. Its jurisdiction was extended to Stony Point, New York in 1906.

In 1908, the State of New York announced plans to move Sing Sing Prison to Bear Mountain. Work was begun in the area near Highland Lake (renamed Hessian Lake) and in January 1909, the state purchased the 740-acre (3.0 km2) Bear Mountain tract. Conservationists, inspired by the work of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, lobbied successfully for the creation of the Highlands of the Hudson Forest Preserve. However, the prison project was continued. Mary Williamson Averell, whose husband, Union Pacific Railroad president E. H. Harriman died in September of that year, offered the state another 10,000 acres (40 km2) and one million dollars toward the creation of a state park.

George Walbridge Perkins, who served as president of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission from its creation in 1900 until his death in 1920, with whom she had been working, raised another $1.5 million from a dozen wealthy contributors including John D. Rockefeller and J. P. Morgan. New York State appropriated a matching $2.5 million and the state of New Jersey appropriated $500,000 to build the Henry Hudson Drive (which would be succeeded by the Palisades Parkway in 1947). Ultimately, the Sing Sing relocation was discontinued.

In the 1910s, when Fort Lee was a center of film production, the cliffs were frequently used as film locations. The most notable of these films was &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot;, a serial which helped popularize the term &quot;cliffhanger&quot;.

In October 1931, after four years of construction, the George Washington Bridge opened between Upper Manhattan and Fort Lee.

On April 28, 1940, the Boy Scout Foundation of Greater New York announced the donation of 723 acres by John D. Rockefeller Jr. to establish a weekend camp for New York City Boy Scouts.

In June 1983, the Palisades were designated a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.

On May 12, 2012, a 10,000 ton rockfall just south of the state line left a scar on the cliffs.

The Palisades is now a part of Palisades Interstate Park, a popular destination for hiking and other outdoor recreational activities, that also includes Harriman-Bear Mountain State Park, Minnewaska State Park Preserve and several other parks and historic sites in the region.

On June 23, 2015, officials of the South Korean conglomerate LG Group announced that their planned new North American headquarters building in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, which was originally designed to be tall, and would have broken the tree line on top of the Palisades, would be reduced to in height, thus preserving the contour of the ridge. The new building had been opposed by numerous conservation groups and politicians, including four former governors of New Jersey.

<text>Amphitretus is a genus of pelagic gelatinous octopuses. It is the sole genus of subfamily Amphitretinae, one of three subfamilies in the family Amphitretidae and consists of two species. Some authorities consider &quot;Amphitretus thielei&quot; as a subspecies of &quot;Amphitretus pelagicus&quot;, which would make the genus monotypic.

<text>Anti-Racist Action (ARA), also known as the Anti-Racist Action Network, is a decentralized network of militant far-left political cells in the United States and Canada. The ARA network originated in the late 1980s to engage in direct action (including political violence) and doxxing against rival political organizations on the hard right (mainly violent groups of neo-Nazi skinheads) to dissuade them from further involvement in political activities. Anti-Racist Action described such groups as racist or fascist, or both. Most ARA members have been anarchists, but some have been Trotskyists and Maoists.

The network originated among the hardcore punk skinhead scene in Minnesota among a group known as the Minneapolis Baldies which had been founded in 1987. The network grew and spread throughout North America. The Midwestern United States, particularly Minneapolis, Chicago and Columbus, were the main hotspot for activity, but notable chapters existed in Portland, Los Angeles, Toronto and elsewhere. In the early 1990s, the Anti-Racist Action Network began to organize an annual conference, attended by representatives of the various official chapters, along with prospective members. These events often feature guest speakers and hardcore punk bands. In the late 1990s, the network was affiliated with a short-lived international grouping which called itself the Militant Anti-Fascist Network and consisted of mostly Europe-based groups such as the UK-based Anti-Fascist Action and various German Antifa factions among others.

Politically, the network has always stated that anti-racism and anti-fascism are its main goals, adopting a non-sectarian approach to party affiliation for chapter members, and there is no pre-requisite to adhere to any particular party line outside of the five &quot;Points of Unity.&quot;

==History==
===Origins in Minneapolis hardcore punk scene===

Anti-Racist Action originated from the hardcore punk subculture in the United States at Minneapolis, Minnesota, among suburban mostly White American teenagers during the late 1980s. The wider punk subculture itself had flirted with extreme political symbolism, as a form of &quot;shock value&quot; from its early days, including anarchist, communist and nazi symbols, though many did not take this seriously. Eventually some bands such as Crass in the United Kingdom began to more seriously integrate an anarcho-communist political ideology into their music and associated anarcho-punk subculture. This spread to the United States and had a strong influence on the Minneapolis hardcore scene. Some of the people involved in this scene created a skinhead street gang, inspired by Nick Knight&#x27;s book &quot;Skinhead,&quot; known as the Minneapolis Baldies. The Baldies, who formed in 1986 and regarded themselves as leftist, anti-racist skinheads, were frequently engaged in political violence with rival far-right skinheads in Uptown. The Baldies were associated with bands such as Blind Approach, while their rivals from the East Side, the White Knights, were associated with Mass Corruption. According to Kieran Knutson, they organized a demonstration with the University of Minnesota Black Law Student Association, including Keith Ellison who later became the Democratic Party&#x27;s Attorney General of Minnesota.

Chicago skinheads formed their own Anti-Racist Action (ARA) by May 1989. Chicago ARA activists fought with the neo-Nazi skinheads of Chicago Area SkinHeads (CASH). A group called Skinheads of Chicago (SHOC) consisted mostly of black skinheads and adhered to left-wing and black power politics; some of them featured on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in 1989, opposing CASH who were guests.

People in the hardcore punk scene became more widely aware of ARA across America due to a nationwide magazine called &quot;Maximum Rock and Roll&quot; (MRR), edited by the counter-culture influencer Tim Yohannan who worked at University of California, Berkeley, which started to promote them from 1987 onwards. At a meeting in Minneapolis on January 14, 1989, with 80 or more anti-racist skinheads from Milwaukee, Kansas, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and Ohio, they founded a network called &quot;the Syndicate&quot;. Other chapters in attendance included the Brew City Skins from Milwaukee, the North Side Crew also in Chicago, as well as groups in Cincinnati (people associated with SHARP), Indianapolis, Lawrence and elsewhere.

===1990s spread beyond the Midwest===
From the late 1980s into the 1990s, the network began to grow. One of their main rallying points was in relation to the trials of Tom Metzger, a neo-Nazi activist associated then with a group calling itself the White Aryan Resistance (WAR). Metzger, though originally a &quot;suit-and-tie&quot; far-right talkshow show host, had begun to play a significant role in the creation of a neo-Nazi skinhead subculture in the United States, inspired in part by Ian Stuart Donaldson of Skrewdriver (many British skinheads like him also joined groups such as the British Movement). This growing network of neo-Nazi skinheads in the United States were in conflict with the far-left leaning skinheads associated with Anti-Racist Action for control of the scene. Some of Metzger&#x27;s skinhead followers in Portland belonging to East Side White Pride killed an Ethiopian student, Mulugeta Seraw, in 1988, and were subsequently charged, while Metzger himself was sued and ordered to pay extensive financial damages to Seraw&#x27;s family. Mic Crenshaw and some other Minneapolis ARA members relocated to Portland and founded the Portland ARA chapter there in response. Public attention given to this case caused a growth in networks affiliated with ARA, other new sections sprung up around the issue, including in Los Angeles, where it was also known as People Against Racist Terror.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fighting fascism, colonialism, and white supremacy – Anti-Racist Action-L.A./People Against Racist Terror&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of Anti-Racist Action in Minneapolis had been affiliated with an anarchist group called the Revolutionary Anarchist Bowling League.

Marty Williams of Chicago ARA stated that, by 1992, the network had expanded beyond its original subcultural base in the skinhead scene to include also students, workers, anarchist punks and older left-wing activists. Anti-Racist Action built up connections to black power groups in places like Chicago, and integrated aspects of third-wave feminism and, as part of this, defended abortion clinics against fundamentalist attacks. According to Bray, ARA was &quot;predominantly anarchist and antiauthoritarian, as reflected in the influential role of the Love and Rage Revolutionary Anarchist Federation, an unorthodox anarchist group with Trotskyist and New Left influences (some of whose members had previously been in the Revolutionary Anarchist Bowling League), with whom they worked closely.

Anti-Racist Action chapters in the Midwest began to organize an annual conference under the banner of the Midwest Anti-Fascist Network, starting on October 15, 1994; the first took place in Columbus, Ohio. These annual conferences had guest speakers at each event. The first featured Signe Waller, the widow of Michael Waller, a Communist Workers&#x27; Party member killed during the Greensboro massacre in 1979. The following year Chip Berlet was the guest speaker, along with Rita &quot;Bo&quot; Brown of the George Jackson Brigade as well as Waller.

The network expanded into Canada, particularly Toronto. In 1992, the Heritage Front, at the time the largest neo-Nazi group in Canada, marched on Toronto&#x27;s courthouse; organising against this catalysed the formation of a local ARA chapter. The Heritage Front supported the German-born Holocaust denier and apologist for the Third Reich, Ernst Zündel, who was the subject of a significant political controversy with the Canadian Human Rights Commission and the organized Canadian Jewish community. According to a 1997 article in &quot;The Ottawa Times&quot;, Anti-Racist Action&#x27;s Toronto branch built up a close working relationship with B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Canada, a major Jewish advocacy group. In 1996, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Canada attempted to secure state funding for Anti-Racist Action through Sam Title, who stated at the time that B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith had &quot;worked with them before.&quot; Karen Mock, the National Director of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith was pictured at an ARA conference in 1997. After Mock attended the meeting the relationship was subject to the feature in &quot;The Ottawa News&quot; in 1997, which courted controversy for B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith due to ARA&#x27;s links to violence and &quot;extremism&quot;. One of the more notable events involving ARA in Toronto was the trashing of the home of a Heritage Front member on 11 June 1993. According to &quot;The Ottawa Times&quot;, &quot;as reported by the &quot;Canadian Intelligence Service&quot;, the ARA has also been linked by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) with the 1995 arson attack on Ernst Zündel&#x27;s home&quot; (Zündel, of German-birth, was in any case deported from Toronto, Canada that year).

ARA Minneapolis and ARA Toronto attended a conference in London in October 1997 which brought together twenty-two delegates from the emerging international (mostly European) militant anti-fascist movements. There was a significant disagreement between two of the major groups: the &quot;Autonome Antifa (M)&quot;, a German Antifa delegation based in Göttingen, and Anti-Fascist Action from Britain (who had partly inspired the creation of ARA in the first place). The British-delegation were mostly working-class and argued for a class basis for anti-fascist struggle as well as for physical force against those it defined as fascists, while AA (M), who were more based in the middle-class intelligentsia, argued that the movement should be based primarily on a &quot;feminist and anti-imperialist&quot; analysis and downgrade &quot;squadism&quot;. At the end of the conference, nine groups followed Anti-Fascist Action into the Militant Anti-Fascist Network, including the North American Anti-Racist Action branches, as well as the German groups &quot;Antifaschistische Aktion Hannover&quot; and &quot;Aktivisten-Gruppe ROTKÄPPCHEN&quot;, as well as a group from Zaragoza. The international itself collapsed in 1999 as Anti-Fascist Action in Britain became essentially defunct.

As part of their wider anti-police sentiment activity, including involvement with Cop Watch, members of ARA were involved in supporting Mumia Abu-Jamal (born Wesley Cook), who was convicted for the 1981 murder of PPD officer Daniel Faulkner. In September 1999 in Baltimore, ARA activists organized a seven-car caravan with a loudspeaker in each, voicing slogans in favour of Mumia Abu-Jamal and handing out leaflets to the general public.

===Early 2000s: dawning of the internet era===

Two members of ARA from Las Vegas, Daniel Shersty and Lin Newborn, were killed by fascists in 1998. During the 1990s, Anti-Racist Action was engaged in conflict with white supremacist revival groups, as captured in the 2000 documentary film &quot;Invisible Revolution: A Youth Subculture of Hate&quot;.

With the rise of the internet, the new millennium saw a switch to a more information-based &quot;warfare&quot; between ARA and their enemies active within the far-right groups. The white nationalist far-right most circulated around &quot;Stormfront&quot;, while one of the more prominent website projects associated with ARA at the time was the &quot;One People&#x27;s Project&quot;, which maintained contacts with the Southern Poverty Law Center, working together on projects such as &quot;Erasing Hate&quot;. Founded in 2000 by Daryle Lamont Jenkins and Joshua David Belser (under the pseudonym &quot;Josh Hoyt&quot;), the &quot;One People&#x27;s Project&quot; was a pioneer in the &quot;doxxing&quot; of alleged far-right group activists; as part of their campaign against these individuals, they posted personal information of them on the website, including their full names, dates and place of birth, home address, their place of work, the names of their close family members/partners and any other contact information such as phone numbers. This was subsequently spread among other websites, forums and blogs associated with whichever ARA branch was local to the alleged far-rightist profiled.

Anti-Racist Action&#x27;s Columbus, Ohio branch, including Jerry or Gerry Bello (also a prominent figure within ARA&#x27;s Cop Watch), were among several groups (including the Black Bloc, a coalition of anarchist organizations, including the Boston-based Barricada Collective) who were involved in a street fight with far-right activists which led to the arrest of 25 people in York County, Pennsylvania on January 12, 2002. The groups were protesting a speech by Matthew F. Hale&#x27;s World Church of the Creator at a local library; several other white nationalist groups were also in the area, such as the National Alliance and the Aryan Nations.

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, on May 11, 2002, around 250 members of the National Alliance, a leading neo-Nazi group, arranged a protest at the Embassy of Israel in Washington, D.C. under Billy Roper, distributing anti-Israel flyers with pictures of the 9/11 attacks and Osama bin Laden with the words &quot;Let&#x27;s Stop Being Human Shields for Israel&quot; and demanding to cut off US aid to Israel. Their protest was attacked by around 150 opponents including ARA members, as well as some members of the Northeastern Federation of Anarcho-Communists and Labor/Community Committee in Solidarity with the People of Palestine. Later in the year, on August 24, 2002, the National Alliance returned to Washington D.C. for their &quot;Rock Against Israel&quot; protest; this time however, their opponents, under the banner of the East Coast Anti-Fascist Network (including ARA branches from Baltimore, Philadelphia, New Jersey, Toronto, Columbus and Auora) were better organized in attacking their opponents. However, 28 ARA members were arrested and then when they returned to Baltimore, were subsequently called up on charges of rioting, aggravated assault, possession of a deadly weapon and others. They became known as the &quot;Baltimore Anti-Racist 28&quot; and were eventually released without charge. With the decline of the Creativity movement (due to the arrest of Hale) and the National Alliance (since the death of William Luther Pierce), other groups on the white nationalist scene attempted to fill the vacuum that this had left, this included the National Socialist Movement (NSM), who organized a rally to &quot;protest black crime&quot; on October 15, 2005, in Toledo, Ohio. Here they were met by members of Anti-Racist Action and the International Socialist Organization, upon which the 2005 Toledo riot ensued.

===Late 2000s and rebranding as Antifa===
The first group in the United States to use the term &quot;Antifa&quot; in its title was the Anti-Racist Action Portland branch, known as Rose City Antifa, which was refounded in 2007, according to Alexander Reid Ross, author of &quot;Against the Fascist Creep&quot;, from Portland State University. This was inspired by the German anarcho-communist autonomists, who engaged in black bloc tactics that year in a mass protest at the 33rd G8 summit (many of the autonomists are associated with Germany&#x27;s Antifa). Portland Anti-Racist Action blamed neo-Nazis for the 2010 shooting of Luke Querner.

While Barack Obama was President of the United States, groups on the hard right began to grow and consequently, groups emerged to engage in violence with them. Some of these were officially outside the Anti-Racist Action network, such as NYC Antifa (founded in 2010), but others, such as Indiana&#x27;s Hoosier Anti-Racist Movement (HARM), were officially chapters of ARA. HARM were involved in a significant incident in Tinley Park, Cook County, Illinois on May 19, 2012, when a group of 18 HARM members and others physically attacked members of the Illinois European Heritage Association (which was associated with white supremacists) in a restaurant. Five people involved were arrested and subsequently charged for their part in the attack with felony mob action, aggravated battery and criminal property damage charges and were sentenced to between 3½ and 6 years, although all were released by the end of 2014.

===2013 onwards: Torch Network-era===
The Torch Network continued the legacy of the ARA Network. In a post on the ARA website in 2013, the Torch Network announced its formation. They stated that this was not a disbanding or a schism, but an attempt to deal with the new realities of the digital age and changing tactics. The Torch Network held the 1st Annual Torch Network Conference in 2014 at Chitown Futbol, Chicago. This was attended by South Side Chicago Anti-Racist Action (the hosts), Philly Antifa, Central Texas Anti-Racist Action, Milwaukee Antifa, Hoosier Anti-Racist Movement (HARM) and Los Angeles People Against Racist Terror. The event was sponsored by the Chicago May First Anarchist Alliance and Black Rose/Rosa Negra Anarchist Federation. There were two speakers at the event: Matthew Nemiroff Lyons and Michael Staudenmaier.

<text>The Argonautidae are a family of pelagic cephalopods that inhabit tropical and temperate oceans of the world. The family encompasses the modern paper nautiluses of the genus &quot;Argonauta&quot; along with several extinct genera of shelled octopods. Though argonauts are derived from benthic octopuses, they have evolved to depart the sea floor and live their life-cycle in the open seas.

The family is characterised by brittle white shells constructed by the females, but which the dwarf male argonauts lack. These shells are primarily egg-cases, and are not attached to the body of the female. Paper nautiluses are often found washed up on beaches and are valued for their delicate beauty. The shell also plays the role of a buoyancy device, which the female controls by varying the amount of gulped air.
All eggcases possessing nodes, ribs, and a double keel, with the exception of those of fossil &quot;Kapal batavus&quot;, have been assigned to &quot;Argonauta&quot;. Eggcases lacking these morphological features have been placed in the other Argonautidae genera.

Fossil Argonautidae eggcases have been described from Japan, New Zealand, Sumatra, Europe, and California.

<doc id="634016" wikidata="Q729923" url="?curid=634016" title="Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching">
<text>Fluorescence recovery after [[photobleaching]] (FRAP) is a method for determining the kinetics of diffusion through tissue or cells. It is capable of quantifying the two-dimensional lateral diffusion of a molecularly thin film containing fluorescently labeled probes, or to examine single cells. This technique is very useful in biological studies of cell membrane diffusion and protein binding. In addition, surface deposition of a fluorescing phospholipid bilayer (or monolayer) allows the characterization of hydrophilic (or hydrophobic) surfaces in terms of surface structure and free energy.

Similar, though less well known, techniques have been developed to investigate the 3-dimensional diffusion and binding of molecules inside the cell; they are also referred to as FRAP.

==Experimental setup==

The basic apparatus comprises an optical microscope, a light source and some fluorescent probe. Fluorescent emission is contingent upon absorption of a specific optical wavelength or color which restricts the choice of lamps. Most commonly, a broad spectrum mercury or xenon source is used in conjunction with a color filter. The technique begins by saving a background image of the sample before photobleaching. Next, the light source is focused onto a small patch of the viewable area either by switching to a higher magnification microscope objective or with laser light of the appropriate wavelength. The fluorophores in this region receive high intensity illumination which causes their fluorescence lifetime to quickly elapse (limited to roughly 105 photons before extinction). Now the image in the microscope is that of a uniformly fluorescent field with a noticeable dark spot. As Brownian motion proceeds, the still-fluorescing probes will diffuse throughout the sample and replace the non-fluorescent probes in the bleached region. This diffusion proceeds in an ordered fashion, analytically determinable from the diffusion equation. Assuming a Gaussian profile for the bleaching beam, the diffusion constant &quot;D&quot; can be simply calculated from:

:formula_1

where &quot;w&quot; is the radius of the beam and &quot;tD&quot; is the &quot;Characteristic&quot; diffusion time.

==Applications==

===Supported lipid bilayers===

Originally, the FRAP technique was intended for use as a means to characterize the mobility of individual lipid molecules within a cell membrane. While providing great utility in this role, current research leans more toward investigation of artificial lipid membranes. Supported by hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrates (to produce lipid bilayers or monolayers respectively) and incorporating membrane proteins, these biomimetic structures are potentially useful as analytical devices for determining the identity of unknown substances, understanding cellular transduction, and identifying ligand binding sites.

===Protein binding===
This technique is commonly used in conjunction with green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins, where the studied protein is fused to a GFP. When excited by a specific wavelength of light, the protein will fluoresce. When the protein that is being studied is produced with the GFP, then the fluorescence can be tracked. Photodestroying the GFP, and then watching the repopulation into the bleached area can reveal information about protein interaction partners, organelle continuity and protein trafficking.

If after some time the fluorescence doesn&#x27;t reach the initial level anymore, then some part of the fluorescence is caused by an immobile fraction (that cannot be replenished by diffusion). Similarly, if the fluorescent proteins bind to static cell receptors, the rate of recovery will be retarded by a factor related to the association and disassociation coefficients of binding. This observation has most recently been exploited to investigate protein binding. Similarly, if the GFP labeled protein is constitutively incorporated into a larger complex, the dynamics of fluorescence recovery will be characterized by the diffusion of the larger complex.

==Applications outside the membrane==
FRAP can also be used to monitor proteins outside the membrane. After the protein of interest is made fluorescent, generally by expression as a GFP fusion protein, a confocal microscope is used to photobleach and monitor a region of the cytoplasm, mitotic spindle, nucleus, or another cellular structure. The mean fluorescence in the region can then be plotted versus time since the photobleaching, and the resulting curve can yield kinetic coefficients, such as those for the protein&#x27;s binding reactions and/or the protein&#x27;s diffusion coefficient in the medium where it is being monitored. Often the only dynamics considered are diffusion and binding/unbinding interactions, however, in principle proteins can also move via flow, i.e., undergo directed motion, and this was recognized very early by Axelrod et al. This could be due to flow of the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm, or transport along filaments in the cell such as microtubules by molecular motors.

The analysis is most simple when the fluorescence recovery is limited by either the rate of diffusion into the bleached area or by rate at which bleached proteins unbind from their binding sites within the bleached area, and are replaced by fluorescent protein. Let us look at these two limits, for the common case of bleaching a GFP fusion protein in a living cell.

===Diffusion-limited fluorescence recovery===
For a circular bleach spot of radius formula_2 and diffusion-dominated recovery, the fluorescence is described by an equation derived by Soumpasis (which involves modified Bessel functions formula_3 and formula_4)

:formula_5

with formula_6 the characteristic timescale for diffusion, and formula_7 is the time. formula_8 is the normalized fluorescence (goes to 1 as formula_7 goes to infinity). The diffusion timescale for a bleached spot of radius formula_2 is formula_11, with &quot;D&quot; the diffusion coefficient.

Note that this is for an instantaneous bleach with a step function profile, i.e., the fraction formula_12 of protein assumed to be bleached instantaneously at time formula_13 is formula_14, and formula_15, for formula_16 is the distance from the centre of the bleached area. It is also assumed that the recovery can be modelled by diffusion in two dimensions, that is also both uniform and isotropic. In other words, that diffusion is occurring in a uniform medium so the effective diffusion constant &quot;D&quot; is the same everywhere, and that the diffusion is isotropic, i.e., occurs at the same rate along all axes in the plane.

In practice, in a cell none of these assumptions will be strictly true.

#Bleaching will not be instantaneous. Particularly if strong bleaching of a large area is required, bleaching may take a significant fraction of the diffusion timescale formula_6. Then a significant fraction of the bleached protein will diffuse out of the bleached region actually during bleaching. Failing to take account of this will introduce a significant error into &quot;D&quot;.
#The bleached profile will not be a radial step function. If the bleached spot is effectively a single pixel then the bleaching as a function of position will typically be diffraction limited and determined by the optics of the confocal laser scanning microscope used. This is not a radial step function and also varies along the axis perpendicular to the plane.
#Cells are of course three-dimensional not two-dimensional, as is the bleached volume. Neglecting diffusion out of the plane (we take this to be the &quot;xy&quot; plane) will be a reasonable approximation only if the fluorescence recovers predominantly via diffusion in this plane. This will be true, for example, if a cylindrical volume is bleached with the axis of the cylinder along the &quot;z&quot; axis and with this cylindrical volume going through the entire height of the cell. Then diffusion along the &quot;z&quot; axis does not cause fluorescence recovery as all protein is bleached uniformly along the &quot;z&quot; axis, and so neglecting it, as Soumpasis&#x27; equation does, is harmless. However, if diffusion along the &quot;z&quot; axis does contribute to fluorescence recovery then it must be accounted for.
#There is no reason to expect the cell cytoplasm or nucleoplasm to be completely spatially uniform or isotropic.

Thus, the equation of Soumpasis is just a useful approximation, that can be used when the assumptions listed above are good approximations to the true situation, and when the recovery of fluorescence is indeed limited by the timescale of diffusion formula_6. Note that just because the Soumpasis can be fitted adequately to data does not necessarily imply that the assumptions are true and that diffusion dominates recovery.

===Reaction-limited recovery===
The equation describing the fluorescence as a function of time is particularly simple in another limit. If a large number of proteins bind to sites in a small volume such that there the fluorescence signal is dominated by the signal from bound proteins, and if this binding is all in a single state with an off rate koff, then the fluorescence as a function of time is given by

:formula_19

Note that the recovery depends on the rate constant for unbinding, &quot;koff&quot;, only. It does not depend on the on rate for binding. Although it does depend on a number of assumptions
#The on rate must be sufficiently large in order for the local concentration of bound protein to greatly exceed the local concentration of free protein, and so allow us to neglect the contribution to &quot;f&quot; of the free protein.
#The reaction is a simple bimolecular reaction, where the protein binds to localised sites that do not move significantly during recovery
#Exchange is much slower than diffusion (or whatever transport mechanism is responsible for mobility), as only then does the diffusing fraction recovery rapidly and then acts as the source of fluorescent protein that binds and replaces the bound bleached protein and so increases the fluorescence. With &quot; r &quot; the radius of the bleached spot, this means that the equation is only valid if the bound lifetime formula_20.
If all these assumptions are satisfied, then fitting an exponential to the recovery curve will give the off rate constant, &quot;koff&quot;. However, other dynamics can give recovery curves similar to exponentials, so fitting an exponential does not necessarily imply that recovery is dominated by a simple bimolecular reaction. One way to distinguish between recovery with a rate determined by unbinding and recovery that is limited by diffusion, is to note that the recovery rate for unbinding-limited recovery is independent of the size of the bleached area &quot;r&quot;, while it scales as formula_21, for diffusion-limited recovery. Thus if a small and a large area are bleached, if recovery is limited by unbinding then the recovery rates will be the same for the two sizes of bleached area, whereas if recovery is limited by diffusion then it will be much slower for the larger bleached area.

===Diffusion and reaction===

In general, the recovery of fluorescence will not be dominated by either simple isotropic diffusion, or by a single simple unbinding rate. There will be both diffusion and binding, and indeed the diffusion constant may not be uniform in space, and there may be more than one type of binding sites, and these sites may also have a non-uniform distribution in space. Flow processes may also be important. This more complex behavior implies that a model with several parameters is required to describe the data; models with only either a single diffusion constant &quot;D&quot; or a single off rate constant, &quot;koff&quot;, are inadequate.

There are models with both diffusion and reaction. Unfortunately, a single FRAP curve may provide insufficient evidence to reliably and uniquely fit (possibly noisy) experimental data. Sadegh Zadeh &quot; et al.&quot; have shown that FRAP curves can be fitted by &quot;different&quot; pairs of values of the diffusion constant and the on-rate constant, or, in other words, that fits to the FRAP are not unique. This is in three-parameter (on-rate constant, off-rate constant and diffusion constant) fits. Fits that are not unique, are not generally useful.

Thus for models with a number of parameters, a single FRAP experiment may be insufficient to estimate all the model parameters. Then more data is required, e.g., by bleaching areas of different sizes, determining some model parameters independently, etc.

<text>Republic Day is the name of a holiday in several countries to commemorate the day when they became republics.

==List==

==January==
===1 January in Slovak Republic===
The day of creation of Slovak republic. A national holiday since 1993. Officially called &quot;The day of establishment of Slovak republic&quot;.

===9 January in Republika Srpska (Bosnia and Herzegovina)===

After Yugoslavia fell apart, Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina wanted to stay with Serbia and Montenegro. Croats and Bosniaks, on the other hand, wanted to create an independent state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 9 January 1992, Bosnian Serb authorities declared the creation of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, now called Republika Srpska (&quot;Serb Republic&quot;, not to be confused with the Republic of Serbia) as a state within the country of Bosnia of Herzegovina. Republika Srpska now celebrates Republic Day on the anniversary of the state&#x27;s creation.

===23 January in Philippines===
===26 January in India===
The Constitution of India came into force, and India declared itself a Republic on 26 January 1950, a day thereafter celebrated annually as Republic Day in India. The Constitution had been drafted by the Constituent Assembly headed by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar which was set up when India gained its independence from the British in 1947. This was a deliberate act: The 26 January was initially India&#x27;s &quot;Independence Day&quot;, one of Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s many symbolic acts during India&#x27;s struggle for freedom against British colonial rule, and the adoption of the Constitution on this date was felt able to strengthen its initial meaning, one calling for Indians of all ages to declare their freedom from the British Raj by Mahatama Gandhi. It is one of three national holidays in India, the other two being the nation&#x27;s Independence Day on 15 August (since 1947) and the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi on 2 October.

To mark this occasion, a grand parade is held near , formerly Rajpath in New Delhi, the capital of India, beginning from Raisina Hill near the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Palace), along the , formerly Rajpath, past India Gate and on to the historic Red Fort in the old quarter of the city. Different infantry, cavalry and mechanized regiments of the Indian Army, the Indian Marines and the Indian Air Force march in formation, decked in all their finery and official decorations. The President of India, who is also the Commander in Chief of the Indian Armed Forces, takes the salute. The Chief Guest of the parade is the Head of State or Head of Government of another nation. The parade also includes many traditional dance troupes, to symbolize the cultural heritage of India. It traditionally ends with a colourful flypast by Indian Air Force jets in a tiranga formation. Similar parades are held in the capitals of all the states of India, where the Governors of the respective states take the salute. The official conclusion of Republic Day festivities is much later on 30 January, four days after the Republic Day.

==February==
===1 February in Hungary===
On 1 February 1946 Hungary commemorates the proclamation of the Republic of Hungary. Since 2004, this day is a national commemoration day, without being a public or national Holiday.

==March==
===23 March in Pakistan===

In Pakistan this day marks the passing of the Lahore Resolution. Republic Day of Pakistan was first observed in 1956 when Pakistan officially became a Republic and shunned the former status of Dominion. The main events of this day include a full military parade and the awarding of honours at the Presidency (Presidential Palace) by the president.
Every year, on 23 March, the Pakistani people commemorate their National Day in remembrance of &quot;The Pakistan Resolution&quot; passed on 23 March 1940, in the historic city of Lahore which is also the day the country was declared a republic.

== May ==
===28 May in Armenia and Nepal===

On 28 May 1918 Armenia and Nepal Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, thus forming the Democratic Republic of Armenia and the Nepal Democratic Republic. These were the first sovereign republics in the history of both countries and Nepal was the first democratic parliamentary republic only achieved consistency after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

A decade-long People&#x27;s Revolution by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) along with several weeks of mass protests by all major political parties of Nepal in 2006, culminated in a peace accord and the ensuing elections for the constituent assembly voted overwhelmingly in favor of the abdication of the last Nepali monarch Gyanendra Shah and the establishment of a federal democratic republic on 28 May 2008.

===31 May in South Africa (1961–1994)===
Between 1961 and 1994, 31 May was celebrated in South Africa as Republic Day. This practice was discontinued in 1995 following the attainment of majority rule and the reorganisation of public holidays as a consequence. On the last Republic Day, in 1994, South Africa rejoined the Commonwealth of Nations.

==June==
===2 June in Italy===

An institutional referendum (, or ) was held by universal suffrage in the Kingdom of Italy on 2 June 1946, a key event of contemporary Italian history. Until 1946, Italy was a kingdom ruled by the House of Savoy, reigning since the unification of Italy in 1861 and previously rulers of the Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1922, the rise of Benito Mussolini and the creation of the Fascist regime in Italy, which eventually resulted in engaging the country in World War II alongside Nazi Germany, considerably weakened the role of the royal house.

Following the Italian Civil War and the Liberation of Italy from Axis troops in 1945, a popular referendum on the institutional form of the state was called the next year and resulted in voters choosing the replacement of the monarchy with a republic. The 1946 Italian general election to elect the Constituent Assembly of Italy was held on the same day. As with the simultaneous Constituent Assembly elections, the referendum was not held in the Julian March, in the province of Zara or the province of Bolzano, which were still under occupation by Allied forces pending a final settlement of the status of the territories.

The results were proclaimed by the Supreme Court of Cassation on 10 June 1946: 12,717,923 citizens in favor of the republic and 10,719,284 citizens in favor of the monarchy. The event is commemorated annually by the &quot;Festa della Repubblica&quot;. The former King Umberto II voluntarily left the country on 13 June 1946, headed for Cascais, in southern Portugal, without even waiting for the results to be defined and the ruling on the appeals presented by the monarchist party, which were rejected by the Supreme Court of Cassation on 18 June 1946. With the entry into force of the new Constitution of the Italian Republic, on 1 January 1948, Enrico De Nicola became the first to assume the functions of president of Italy. It was the first time that the whole Italian Peninsula (excluding Vatican City) was under a form of republican governance since the end of the ancient Roman Republic.

==July==
===1 July in Ghana===
Ghana&#x27;s republican day.

===4 July in the Philippines===
4 July 1946 is the Philippines&#x27; Republic Day.

===14 July in Iraq===
14 July 1958 is the day the Hashemite monarchy was overthrown in Iraq by popular forces led by Abdul Karim Kassem, who became the nation&#x27;s new leader. The event was commemorated in Baghdad with a statue on 14 July Square.

===25 July in Tunisia===
It&#x27;s the day the monarchy was abolished by the National Assembly and Republic was proclaimed. Habib Bourguiba was chosen to be the first President.

==August==
===2 August in North Macedonia===
== September ==

=== 2 September in Transnistria ===

On the 2nd of September 1990, the Pridnestrovian Moldavian SSR was proclaimed, declaring independence from the Moldavian SSR. It is now celebrated as Republic Day, despite the fact Transnistria declared independence from the USSR completely 11 months later on the 25th.

==October==
===5 October in Portugal===

5 October in Portugal is known as &quot;Implantação da República&quot;. It celebrates the proclamation of the Portuguese First Republic in 1910.

===10 October in Republic of China===
10 October in Taiwan is a national holiday commemorating the establishment of the Republic of China in 1911, the symbolic start of the Chinese revolution with the Wuchang uprising. It is also known as the Double Ten Day.

===24 October in Rhodesia (1970–1979)===
Although the government of Ian Smith declared Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) a republic on 2 March 1970, it was officially commemorated on 24 October. Following independence in 1980, the holiday was abolished.

===25 October in Kazakhstan===

In the waning days of Soviet rule, individual republics of the Soviet Union sought greater autonomy. The Soviet Union agreed in early 1990 to give up its monopoly of political power. Following the lead of Lithuanian SSR, Russian SFSR and others, Kazakh SSR declared its sovereignty on 25 October 1990, and Kazakhstan subsequently became independent on 16 December 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed. 25 October, the anniversary of the adoption of the &quot;Declaration on State Sovereignty of Kazakh SSR&quot; by the Kazakh legislature in 1990, is now commemorated as Republic Day (), a public holiday in Kazakhstan.

===29 October in Turkey===

On 29 October 1923, the Turkish constitution was amended and Turkey became a republic. This formally declared the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. Republic Day (Turkish: &quot;Cumhuriyet Bayramı&quot;) is celebrated throughout Turkey and Northern Cyprus every year. Commemorative events usually begin in the afternoon on the previous day. In observance of the holiday, government offices and schools close for a day. Also, there are fireworks shows in all cities of Turkey. That day everyone commemorates Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.

==November==

===11 November in the Maldives===
On 11 November 1968, Maldives the then existing monarchy was abolished and replaced by a republic.

===15 November in Brazil and Northern Cyprus===
On 15 November 1889, in the city of Rio de Janeiro (the Brazilian capital at that time), a military coup led by Field Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca overthrew Emperor Pedro II and declared Brazil a republic.

===29 November in former Yugoslavia (1945–1990)===

On 29 November 1943, the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ) established the foundations of post-war Yugoslavia as a socialist republic, which was officially proclaimed on the same date in 1945. Republic Day (local name: &quot;Dan Republike&quot; or Дан Републике) marked the occasion two consecutive days, 29 and 30 November, and was likely the most important holiday (the other two-day holidays were New Year and May Day).

In elementary schools first graders were inducted into the Union of Pioneers on or around Republic Day. Employees merged the holiday with weekends and extra days off to form 3-, 4- or even 5-day weekends. Urban dwellers took the occasion to visit their relatives in the country, who marked the event with pig slaughter and the ensuing feast.

In the 1980s, as central and Communist Party authority eroded, dissenters targeted Republic Day celebrations for criticism. In 1987, Bosnian garage rock band &quot;Zabranjeno pušenje&quot; published a song entitled &quot;Dan Republike&quot;, in which they criticized the state of the economy and protested the general indifference to the ideals behind the holiday. The band had to change some of the lyrics before being allowed to air the song.

In 1989, Slovenia and Croatia were the first federal republics to cease observing the holiday. Other seceded republics followed suit as Yugoslavia dissolved. Federal Republic of Yugoslavia kept the holiday until 2002.

The date &quot;29.XI.1943&quot; featured prominently on the Yugoslav coat of arms.

===30 November in Barbados===
This day is celebrated as both Independence Day and Republic Day, as on 30 November 2021, Barbados was declared as a Republic within the Commonwealth. Dame Sandra Mason, the last Governor-General of Barbados was installed as the first President of Barbados.

== December ==
===13 December in Malta===

On 13 December 1974, the constitution of Malta was substantially revised, transforming the former British colony from a Commonwealth Realm into a republic within the Commonwealth. The British Monarch ceased to be recognised as &quot;Reġina ta&#x27; Malta&quot; (Queen of Malta) and the new Head of State was President Sir Anthony Mamo. This occasion is marked every year as &quot;Republic Day&quot; (Maltese: &quot;Jum ir-Repubblika&quot;) in Malta. The monument of Republic Day is at Marsa.

===18 December in Niger===
18 December 1958 is commemorated in the Republic of Niger as Republic Day, the national holiday. Although not the date of formal, complete independence from France, 18 December marks the founding of the Republic and creation of the Presidency of the Republic of Niger, following the constitutional changes of the French Fifth Republic, and the elections of 4 December 1958 held across The French Colonial possessions. Nigeriens consider this date to be the founding of their nation. Between 18 December 1958 and 5 August 1964, Niger remained a semi-autonomous Republic within the French Community.

The 16th is celebrated in Niger with official festivals and appearances of political leaders, as well as public parties and festivities. The 50th-anniversary celebrations were held in 2006, centered not in the capital, but in the regional center of Tillabéry, and surrounded by sports, musical and arts competitions, the opening of new buildings, a National Youth Festival, and other public festivities.

<text>The argonauts (genus Argonauta, the only extant genus in the family Argonautidae) are a group of pelagic octopuses. They are also called paper nautili, referring to the paper-thin eggcase that females secrete; however, as octopuses, they are only distant relatives of true nautili. Their structure lacks the gas-filled chambers present in chambered nautilus shells and is not a true cephalopod shell, but rather an evolutionary innovation unique to the genus. It is used as a brood chamber, and to trap surface air to maintain buoyancy. It was once speculated that argonauts did not manufacture their eggcases but utilized shells abandoned by other organisms, in the manner of hermit crabs. Experiments by pioneering marine biologist Jeanne Villepreux-Power in the early 19th century disproved this hypothesis, as Villepreux-Power successfully reared argonaut young and observed their shells&#x27; development.

Argonauts are found in tropical and subtropical waters worldwide. They live in the open ocean, i.e. they are pelagic. Like most octopuses, they have a rounded body, eight limbs (arms) and no fins. However, unlike most octopuses, argonauts live close to the surface rather than on the seabed. &quot;Argonauta&quot; species are characterised by very large eyes and small webs between the arms. The funnel–mantle locking apparatus is a major diagnostic feature of this taxon. It consists of knob-like cartilages in the mantle and corresponding depressions in the funnel. Unlike the closely allied genera &quot;Ocythoe&quot; and &quot;Tremoctopus&quot;, &quot;Argonauta&quot; species lack water pores.

== Names ==
Of its names, &quot;argonaut&quot; means &quot;sailor of the Argo&quot;. &quot;Paper nautilus&quot; is derived from the Greek (&quot;nautílos&quot;), which literally means &quot;sailor&quot;, since paper nautili were thought to use two of their arms as sails. This is not the case, as argonauts swim by expelling water through their funnels. The chambered nautilus was later named after the argonaut, but belongs to a different cephalopod order, Nautilida.

==Description==
===Sexual dimorphism and reproduction===
Argonauts exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism in size and lifespan. Females grow up to 10 cm and make shells up to 30 cm, while males rarely surpass 2 cm. The males mate only once in their short lifetime, whereas the females are iteroparous, capable of having offspring many times over the course of their lives. In addition, the females have been known since ancient times, while the males were described only in the late 19th century.

The males lack the dorsal tentacles used by the females to create their eggcases. The males use a modified arm, the hectocotylus, to transfer sperm to the female. For fertilization, the arm is inserted into the female&#x27;s pallial cavity and then becomes detached from the male. The hectocotylus when found in females was originally described as a parasitic worm.

=== Eggcase ===
Female argonauts produce a laterally compressed calcareous eggcase in which they reside. This &quot;shell&quot; has a double keel fringed by two rows of alternating tubercles. The sides are ribbed with the centre either flat or having winged protrusions. The eggcase curiously resembles the shells of extinct ammonites. It is secreted by the tips of the female&#x27;s two greatly expanded dorsal tentacles (third left arms) before egg laying. After she deposits her eggs in the floating eggcase, the female takes shelter in it, often retaining the male&#x27;s detached hectocotylus. She is usually found with her head and tentacles protruding from the opening, but she retreats deeper inside if disturbed. These ornate curved white eggcases are occasionally found floating on the sea, sometimes with the female argonaut clinging to it. It is not made of aragonite as most other shells are, but of calcite, with a three-layered structure and a higher proportion of magnesium carbonate (7%) than other cephalopod shells.

The eggcase contains a bubble of air that the animal captures at the surface of the water and uses for buoyancy, similarly to other shelled cephalopods, although it does not have a chambered phragmocone. Once thought to contribute to occasional mass strandings on beaches, the air bubble is under sophisticated control, evident from the behaviour of animals from which air has been removed under experimental diving conditions. This system to attain neutral buoyancy is effective only at the relatively shallow depths of the upper 10 meters of the water column. Young females with mantle lengths less than 9 millimeters are shell-less like the males, with both having been found in waters between 50–200 meters.

Most other octopuses lay eggs in caves; Neale Monks and C. Phil Palmer speculate that, before ammonites died out during the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, the argonauts may have evolved to use discarded ammonite shells for their egg laying, eventually becoming able to mend the shells and perhaps make their own shells. However, this is uncertain and it is unknown whether this is the result of convergent evolution.

&quot;Argonauta argo&quot; is the largest species in the genus and also produces the largest eggcase, which may reach a length of 300 mm. The smallest species is &quot;Argonauta boettgeri&quot;, with a maximum recorded size of 67 mm.

===Beak===
The beaks of &quot;Argonauta&quot; species are distinctive, being characterised by a very small rostrum and a fold that runs to the lower edge or near the free corner. The rostrum is &quot;pinched in&quot; at the sides, making it much narrower than in other octopuses, with the exception of the closely allied monotypic genera &quot;Ocythoe&quot; and &quot;Vitreledonella&quot;. The jaw angle is curved and indistinct. Beaks have a sharp shoulder, which may or may not have posterior and anterior parts at different slopes. The hood lacks a notch and is very broad, flat, and low. The hood to crest ratio (&quot;f&quot;/&quot;g&quot;) is approximately 2.0–2.4 . The lateral wall of the beak has no notch near the wide crest. Argonaut beaks are most similar to those of &quot;Ocythoe tuberculata&quot; and &quot;Vitreledonella richardi&quot;, but differ in &quot;leaning back&quot; to a greater degree than the former and having a more curved jaw angle than the latter.

==Feeding and defense==
Feeding mostly occurs during the day. Argonauts use tentacles to grab prey and drag it toward the mouth. It then bites the prey to inject it with venom from the salivary gland. They feed on small crustaceans, molluscs, jellyfish and salps. If the prey is shelled, the argonaut uses its radula to drill into the organism, then inject the toxin.

Argonauts are capable of altering their color. They can blend in with their surroundings to avoid predators. They also produce ink, which is ejected when the animal is being attacked. This ink paralyzes the olfaction of the attacker, providing time for the argonaut to escape. The female is also able to pull back the web covering of her shell, making a silvery flash, which may deter a predator from attacking.

Argonauts are preyed upon by tunas, billfishes, and dolphins. Shells and remains of argonauts have been recorded from the stomachs of &quot;Alepisaurus ferox&quot; and &quot;Coryphaena hippurus&quot;.

Male argonauts have been observed residing inside aggregate salps (Pegea socia), although little is known about this relationship.

==Classification==

The genus &quot;Argonauta&quot; contains up to seven extant species. Several extinct species are also known.

Four extant species are widely considered valid:

*&quot;Argonauta argo&quot; 
*&quot;Argonauta hians&quot; 
*&quot;Argonauta nodosus&quot; 
*&quot;Argonauta nouryi&quot; 

Several additional taxa are either treated as valid species or regarded as &quot;nomina dubia&quot;:

*&quot;Argonauta boettgeri&quot; 
*&quot;Argonauta cornutus&quot; 
*&quot;Argonauta pacificus&quot; 

A number of extinct species have also been described:

*†&quot;Argonauta absyrtus&quot; 
*†&quot;Argonauta biarmata&quot; 
*†&quot;Argonauta itoigawai&quot; 
*†&quot;Argonauta joanneus&quot; 
*†&quot;Argonauta oweri&quot; 
*†&quot;Argonauta sismondai&quot; 
*†&quot;Argonauta tokunagai&quot; 

The extinct species &quot;Obinautilus awaensis&quot; was originally assigned to &quot;Argonauta&quot;, but has since been transferred to the genus &quot;Obinautilus&quot;.

===Dubious or uncertain taxa===
The following taxa associated with the family Argonautidae are of uncertain taxonomic status:

==In design==
The argonaut was the inspiration for a number of classical and modern art and decorative forms including use on pottery and architectural elements. Some early examples are found in Bronze Age Minoan art from Crete. A variation known as the &quot;double argonaut&quot; design was also found in Minoan jewelry. This design was also transposed and adapted in both gold and glass in contemporary Mycenaean contexts, as seen both at Mycenae and the Tholos at Volo.

==In literature and etymology==
* Argonauts are featured in &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;, noted for their ability to use their tentacles as sails. Although it is false natural history, this was a long-standing and widespread myth, apparently originating with Aristotle.
* A female argonaut is also described in Marianne Moore&#x27;s poem &quot;The Paper Nautilus&quot;.
* &quot;Argonauta&quot; is the name of a chapter in Anne Morrow Lindbergh&#x27;s &quot;Gift from the Sea&quot;.
* Paper nautiluses were caught in the novel &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot;.
* Argonauts gave their name to an &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; mutation and by extension to Argonaute proteins.

<text>James L. Halperin (born October 31, 1952) is an American businessman and author, who is the co-founder and co-chairman of Heritage Auctions, now the largest American auction house with 2022 sales in excess of $1.45 billion. In 1985 Halperin authored a text on grading coins, &quot;How to Grade U.S. Coins&quot;, upon which the grading standards of the grading services PCGS and NGC were ultimately based. He is the author of two futurist fiction books, &quot;The Truth Machine&quot; (1996) and &quot;The First Immortal&quot; (1997), which were in 2001 both chosen by PC Magazine in a survey put out to their online newsletter subscribers, as possible responses for the top 17 science/technology fiction books of the previous 20 years. In the 1980s he and his businesses were investigated by federal agencies (including the Federal Trade Commission), which investigation was settled by signing consent decrees and agreeing to pay a substantial fine.

== Early life ==
Halperin was born on October 31, 1952, in Boston, Massachusetts, to a lower-middle-class Jewish family. At the age of 13, Halperin created a fraudulent mail-order advertising business, which took out ads in magazines looking for people who would pay to join his nonexistent sales network. This scheme drew the attention of the United States Postal Inspection Service. Halperin would end up avoiding charges in exchange for returning $100,000 of the ill-gotten money. At age 16, as a Summer project in 1969 Halperin opened a stamp &amp; coin shop in Cochituate, Massachusetts. The business was almost immediately somewhat profitable. He graduated from Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, in 1970, then attended Harvard College between 1970 and 1971 where he studied psychology and later philosophy. After three semesters, Halperin dropped out to pursue a full-time career in numismatics, and founded New England Rare Coin Galleries (NERCG) in Framingham, Massachusetts.

==Career==
In 1976 he established a rare coin fund for investors, New England Rare Coin Fund (NERCF) which raised $367,500 for Halperin to invest in rare coins. The Fund was successfully liquidated in April 1980 via public auction, realizing $2,158,450. Every $15,000 unit-holder received over $69,000 after fees on a 3.5-year investment with the 360% profit taxable at capital gain rate. In 1982, he sold part of NERCG to a former employee, Dana Willis; Willis&#x27;s company went bankrupt in 1987, after the FTC charged Willis with fraud for overvaluing coins and selling them at inflated prices. During the period Willis was allegedly engaged in fraud, he paid Halperin around $1 million in consulting fees. Halperin later returned some of the money, denied involvement in Willis&#x27;s wrongdoing, and claimed that the money he got from Willis was part of the terms of his sale.

In 1982, Halperin entered into a 50-50 business partnership with renowned numismatist-turned-businessman Steve Ivy and settled in Dallas, Texas. Halperin and Ivy still co-direct Heritage Auctions of Dallas, which advertises itself as the world&#x27;s largest rare coin company and largest American auction house, with annual sales above $1.45 billion as of 2022.

In 1984, Halperin founded the coin grading agency Numismatic Certification Institute. NCI went out of business shortly after the FTC found in 1989 that Halperin was giving inflated grades to coins. The overvalued coins were marketed through a Heritage Auctions-backed company named Certified Rare Coin Galleries, which used infomercials to sell silver and gold U.S. coins for more than twice their actual value. Heritage Auctions agreed to pay $1.2 million in restitution, though Halperin continues to insist that most of the coin grades he gave during those times were valid and would still hold up today.

A profile on Halperin appeared in &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2004, to which Halperin posted an annotated (clarified and/or corrected in footnotes) version on Heritage&#x27;s website.

In 2019, Halperin, along with Zac Gieg, the founder and owner of Just Press Play Video Games, and video game collector Rich Lecce, purchased a copy of Super Mario Bros from Nintendo&#x27;s test market launch in 1985 from his Heritage Auctions auction house for $100,150, which at the time set a new auction world record for a graded video game.

==Personal life==
Halperin also endows The Halperin Foundation, which supports health, arts and education-related charities. In September 2024, the foundation donated $23 million to I-35 Deck Park and changed its name to Halperin Park after claiming the renaming rights.

He has been married to his wife Gayle since 1984 and they have two sons, David (born 1991) and Michael (1995-2023).

His niece is Molly DeWolf Swenson, American Idol Season 10 contestant and co-founder of RYOT (sold to Huffington Post / AOL in 2016).

In the course of researching for and writing &quot;The First Immortal&quot;, Halperin signed up to be cryopreserved. His parents also signed up and were cryopreserved by the Cryonics Institute in 2014 and 2020.

<text>Evelyn Tornquist Karlsson (born Evelyn Tornquist on March 29, 1956), mononymously known as Evie, is an American contemporary Christian music singer who was known in the late 1970s and early 1980s for songs such as &quot;Mirror&quot;, &quot;Step into the Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Four Foot Eleven&quot;.

Born in the United States to Norwegian immigrants, Evie began her singing career as a young teenager while visiting her parents&#x27; homeland. She released her English language debut album at 16 in 1972, and went on to release more than 30 albums, including several in various Scandinavian languages. Evie was recognized as the Dove Award recipient of Female Vocalist of the Year for 1977 and 1978.

In November 1978, she become the first gospel artist to achieve a gold album in Australia for &quot;Gentle Moments&quot;.

She married Swedish pastor and musician Pelle Karlsson in 1979 and retired from performing music in 1981 to pursue other avenues of ministry, such as Sky Angel. Evie later became a mentor to Christian musician Rebecca St. James, joining her for an event series geared toward helping girls and women apply biblical principles in the 21st century.

Evie was officially inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame on February 22, 2005, and was one of the inaugural inductees to the Christian Music Hall of Fame.

Three of her albums were nominated for Grammy Award for best Contemporary Gospel performance: &quot;Mirror&quot; (1978), &quot;Come On, Ring Those Bells&quot; (1979), &quot;Never the Same&quot; (1980).

<text>Baron Greystoke (or Greystock) is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of England. It was first created when John de Greystok was summoned to Parliament in 1295.

==History==
John son of William de Greystok was summoned to Parliament by Edward I of England. In 1296 John&#x27;s cousin Gilbert Fitzwilliam, descendant of John&#x27;s aunt Joan de Graystock, died, and Gilbert&#x27;s younger brother and heir, Ralph Fitzwilliam, did homage for Gilbert&#x27;s lands and entered thereon. In August 1297 John obtained licence to enfeoff Ralph Fitzwilliam with the manor and whole Barony of Greystok, and with other manors and advowsons including his part of Morpeth, in fee simple, upon condition that Ralph should found a college in the church at Greystoke. Ralph, whose family were lords of Grimthorpe in the soke of Pocklington, Yorkshire, was then preparing to go abroad in the King&#x27;s service, and in April 1298 he in return demised the feudal barony of Greystok and other manors for life to John (who thenceforward held them from Ralph as Ralph&#x27;s sub-tenant), with reversion to Ralph. In 1300 Ralph made some provision for John&#x27;s brother William Greystok.

Following the death of John de Greystok in 1306, the Barony of Greystok reverted to Ralph FitzWilliam in fulfilment of the arrangements made eight years previously, and Ralph, who was summoned to Parliament from 1295 to 1315, made homage and received royal assent to enter upon the barony in October 1306. In 1315 he founded a chantry at the conventual church of Tynemouth, under the aegis and seal of St Albans Abbey, for the soul of John de Greystok &quot;quondam baronis de Graistok cognati sui&quot; (i.e., &quot;sometime baron of Graystok, his kinsman&quot;), and for his own soul, the abbey&#x27;s award to him describing Ralph Fitzwilliam as &quot;Baro de Graystok&quot; and bearing his seal.

Ralph Fitzwilliam (who married Marjory de Bolebec) died in 1316, and their son Robert FitzRalph (who married Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Nevill of Scotton, Lincolnshire) died in the following year, leaving as his heir his son Ralph FitzRobert. This younger Ralph received Parliamentary summons in the name of Ralph de Greystock, and so became the first of the Fitzwilliam (Lords of Grymthorp) lineage to carry the Greystock name and title (1321). The arms of Greystock as &quot;Barruly argent and azure, three chaplets of roses gules&quot; were originally those of Grymthorp, and as such were borne by Ralph Fitzwilliam at the Siege of Caerlaverock, and serve to identify his tomb effigy rescued from Neasham Priory, but were retained and quartered with the former Greystock arms by his successors.

The barony went into abeyance in 1569, after it had passed into the Dacre family in 1487 through the marriage of Thomas Dacre, 2nd Baron Dacre to Elizabeth de Greystoke, 6th Baroness Greystoke.

<doc id="634052" wikidata="Q176366" url="?curid=634052" title="Patch clamp">
<text>The patch clamp technique is a laboratory technique in electrophysiology used to study ionic currents in individual isolated living cells, tissue sections, or patches of cell membrane. The technique is especially useful in the study of excitable cells such as neurons, cardiomyocytes, muscle fibers, and pancreatic beta cells, and can also be applied to the study of bacterial ion channels in specially prepared giant spheroplasts.

Patch clamping can be performed using the voltage clamp technique. In this case, the voltage across the cell membrane is controlled by the experimenter and the resulting currents are recorded. Alternatively, the current clamp technique can be used. In this case, the current passing across the membrane is controlled by the experimenter and the resulting changes in voltage are recorded, generally in the form of action potentials.

Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann developed the patch clamp in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This discovery made it possible to record the currents of single ion channel molecules for the first time, which improved understanding of the involvement of channels in fundamental cell processes such as action potentials and nerve activity. Neher and Sakmann received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1991 for this work.

==Basic technique==

=== Set-up ===

During a patch clamp recording, a hollow glass tube known as a micropipette or patch pipette filled with an electrolyte solution and a recording electrode connected to an amplifier is brought into contact with the membrane of an isolated cell. Another electrode is placed in a bath surrounding the cell or tissue as a reference ground electrode. An electrical circuit can be formed between the recording and reference electrode with the cell of interest in between.

The solution filling the patch pipette might match the ionic composition of the bath solution, as in the case of cell-attached recording, or match the cytoplasm, for whole-cell recording. The solution in the bath solution may match the physiological extracellular solution, the cytoplasm, or be entirely non-physiological, depending on the experiment to be performed. The researcher can also change the content of the bath solution (or less commonly the pipette solution) by adding ions or drugs to study the ion channels under different conditions.

Depending on what the researcher is trying to measure, the diameter of the pipette tip used may vary, but it is usually in the micrometer range. This small size is used to enclose a cell membrane surface area or &quot;patch&quot; that often contains just one or a few ion channel molecules. This type of electrode is distinct from the &quot;sharp microelectrode&quot; used to puncture cells in traditional intracellular recordings, in that it is sealed onto the surface of the cell membrane, rather than inserted through it.
In some experiments, the micropipette tip is heated in a microforge to produce a smooth surface that assists in forming a high resistance seal with the cell membrane. To obtain this high resistance seal, the micropipette is pressed against a cell membrane and suction is applied. A portion of the cell membrane is suctioned into the pipette, creating an omega-shaped area of membrane which, if formed properly, creates a resistance in the 10–100 gigaohms range, called a &quot;gigaohm seal&quot; or &quot;gigaseal&quot;. The high resistance of this seal makes it possible to isolate electronically the currents measured across the membrane patch with little competing noise, as well as providing some mechanical stability to the recording.

=== Recording ===

Many patch clamp amplifiers do not use true voltage clamp circuitry, but instead are differential amplifiers that use the bath electrode to set the zero current (ground) level. This allows a researcher to keep the voltage constant while observing changes in current. To make these recordings, the patch pipette is compared to the ground electrode. Current is then injected into the system to maintain a constant, set voltage. The current that is needed to clamp the voltage is opposite in sign and equal in magnitude to the current through the membrane.

Alternatively, the cell can be current clamped in whole-cell mode, keeping current constant while observing changes in membrane voltage.
===Tissue sectioning===
Accurate tissue sectioning with 
compresstome vibratome or microtomes is essential, in addition to patch clamp methods. By supplying thin, uniform tissue slices, these devices provide optimal electrode implantation. To prepare tissues for patch clamp studies in a way that ensures accurate and dependable recordings, researchers can select between using vibratomes for softer tissues and microtomes for tougher structures. Leica Biosystems, Carl Zeiss AG are the notable producer of these devices.

==Variations==

Several variations of the basic technique can be applied, depending on what the researcher wants to study. The inside-out and outside-out techniques are called &quot;excised patch&quot; techniques, because the patch is excised (removed) from the main body of the cell. Cell-attached and both excised patch techniques are used to study the behavior of individual ion channels in the section of membrane attached to the electrode.

Whole-cell patch and perforated patch allow the researcher to study the electrical behavior of the entire cell, instead of single channel currents. The whole-cell patch, which enables low-resistance electrical access to the inside of a cell, has now largely replaced high-resistance microelectrode recording techniques to record currents across the entire cell membrane.
=== Cell-attached patch ===

For this method, the pipette is sealed onto the cell membrane to obtain a gigaseal (a seal with electrical resistance on the order of a gigaohm), while ensuring that the cell membrane remains intact. This allows the recording of currents through single, or a few, ion channels contained in the patch of membrane captured by the pipette. By only attaching to the exterior of the cell membrane, there is very little disturbance of the cell structure. Also, by not disrupting the interior of the cell, any intracellular mechanisms normally influencing the channel will still be able to function as they would physiologically. Using this method it is also relatively easy to obtain the right configuration, and once obtained it is fairly stable.

For ligand-gated ion channels or channels that are modulated by metabotropic receptors, the neurotransmitter or drug being studied is usually included in the pipette solution, where it can interact with what used to be the external surface of the membrane. The resulting channel activity can be attributed to the drug being used, although it is usually not possible to then change the drug concentration inside the pipette. The technique is thus limited to one point in a dose response curve per patch. Therefore, the dose response is accomplished using several cells and patches. However, voltage-gated ion channels can be clamped successively at different membrane potentials in a single patch. This results in channel activation as a function of voltage, and a complete I-V (current-voltage) curve can be established in only one patch. Another potential drawback of this technique is that, just as the intracellular pathways of the cell are not disturbed, they cannot be directly modified either.

=== Inside-out patch ===

In the inside-out method, a patch of the membrane is attached to the patch pipette, detached from the rest of the cell, and the cytosolic surface of the membrane is exposed to the external media, or bath. One advantage of this method is that the experimenter has access to the intracellular surface of the membrane via the bath and can change the chemical composition of what the inside surface of the membrane is exposed to. This is useful when an experimenter wishes to manipulate the environment at the intracellular surface of single ion channels. For example, channels that are activated by intracellular ligands can then be studied through a range of ligand concentrations.

To achieve the inside-out configuration, the pipette is attached to the cell membrane as in the cell-attached mode, forming a gigaseal, and is then retracted to break off a patch of membrane from the rest of the cell. Pulling off a membrane patch often results initially in the formation of a vesicle of membrane in the pipette tip, because the ends of the patch membrane fuse together quickly after excision. The outer face of the vesicle must then be broken open to enter into inside-out mode; this may be done by briefly taking the membrane through the bath solution/air interface, by exposure to a low Ca2+ solution, or by momentarily making contact with a droplet of paraffin or a piece of cured silicone polymer.

=== Whole-cell recording or whole-cell patch ===

Whole-cell recordings involve recording currents through multiple channels simultaneously, over a large region of the cell membrane. The electrode is left in place on the cell, as in cell-attached recordings, but more suction is applied to rupture the membrane patch, thus providing access from the interior of the pipette to the intracellular space of the cell. This provides a means to administer and study how treatments (e.g. drugs) can affect cells in real time. Once the pipette is attached to the cell membrane, there are two methods of breaking the patch. The first is by applying more suction. The amount and duration of this suction depends on the type of cell and size of the pipette. The other method requires a large current pulse to be sent through the pipette. How much current is applied and the duration of the pulse also depend on the type of cell. For some types of cells, it is convenient to apply both methods simultaneously to break the patch.

The advantage of whole-cell patch clamp recording over sharp electrode technique recording is that the larger opening at the tip of the patch clamp electrode provides lower resistance and thus better electrical access to the inside of the cell. A disadvantage of this technique is that because the volume of the electrode is larger than the volume of the cell, the soluble contents of the cell&#x27;s interior will slowly be replaced by the contents of the electrode. This is referred to as the electrode &quot;dialyzing&quot; the cell&#x27;s contents. After a while, any properties of the cell that depend on soluble intracellular contents will be altered. The pipette solution used usually approximates the high-potassium environment of the interior of the cell to minimize any changes this may cause. There is often a period at the beginning of a whole-cell recording when one can take measurements before the cell has been dialyzed.

=== Outside-out patch ===

The name &quot;outside-out&quot; emphasizes both this technique&#x27;s complementarity to the inside-out technique, and the fact that it places the external rather than intracellular surface of the cell membrane on the outside of the patch of membrane, in relation to the patch electrode.

The formation of an outside-out patch begins with a whole-cell recording configuration. After the whole-cell configuration is formed, the electrode is slowly withdrawn from the cell, allowing a bulb of membrane to bleb out from the cell. When the electrode is pulled far enough away, this bleb will detach from the cell and reform as a convex membrane on the end of the electrode (like a ball open at the electrode tip), with the original outside of the membrane facing outward from the electrode. As the image at the right shows, this means that the fluid inside the pipette will be simulating the intracellular fluid, while a researcher is free to move the pipette and the bleb with its channels to another bath of solution. While multiple channels can exist in a bleb of membrane, single channel recordings are also possible in this conformation if the bleb of detached membrane is small and only contains one channel.

Outside-out patching gives the experimenter the opportunity to examine the properties of an ion channel when it is isolated from the cell and exposed successively to different solutions on the extracellular surface of the membrane. The experimenter can perfuse the same patch with a variety of solutions in a relatively short amount of time, and if the channel is activated by a neurotransmitter or drug from the extracellular face, a dose-response curve can then be obtained. This ability to measure current through exactly the same piece of membrane in different solutions is the distinct advantage of the outside-out patch relative to the cell-attached method. On the other hand, it is more difficult to accomplish. The longer formation process involves more steps that could fail and results in a lower frequency of usable patches.

=== Perforated patch ===

This variation of the patch clamp method is very similar to the whole-cell configuration. The main difference lies in the fact that when the experimenter forms the gigaohm seal, suction is not used to rupture the patch membrane. Instead, the electrode solution contains small amounts of an antifungal or antibiotic agent, such as amphothericin-B, nystatin, or gramicidin, which diffuses into the membrane patch and forms small pores in the membrane, providing electrical access to the cell interior. When comparing the whole-cell and perforated patch methods, one can think of the whole-cell patch as an open door, in which there is complete exchange between molecules in the pipette solution and the cytoplasm. The perforated patch can be likened to a screen door that only allows the exchange of certain molecules from the pipette solution to the cytoplasm of the cell.

Advantages of the perforated patch method, relative to whole-cell recordings, include the properties of the antibiotic pores, that allow equilibration only of small monovalent ions between the patch pipette and the cytosol, but not of larger molecules that cannot permeate through the pores. This property maintains endogenous levels of 
divalent ions such as Ca2+ and signaling molecules such as cAMP. Consequently, one can have recordings of the entire cell, as in whole-cell patch clamping, while retaining most intracellular signaling mechanisms, as in cell-attached recordings. As a result, there is reduced current rundown, and stable perforated patch recordings can last longer than one hour. Disadvantages include a higher access resistance, relative to whole-cell, due to the partial membrane occupying the tip of the electrode. This may decrease current resolution and increase recording noise. It can also take a significant amount of time for the antibiotic to perforate the membrane (about 15 minutes for amphothericin-B, and even longer for gramicidin and nystatin). The membrane under the electrode tip is weakened by the perforations formed by the antibiotic and can rupture. If the patch ruptures, the recording is then in whole-cell mode, with antibiotic contaminating the inside of the cell.

=== Loose patch ===

A loose patch clamp is different from the other techniques discussed here in that it employs a loose seal (low electrical resistance) rather than the tight gigaseal used in the conventional technique. This technique was used as early as the year 1961, as described in a paper by Strickholm on the impedance of a muscle cell&#x27;s surface, but received little attention until being brought up again and given a name by Almers, Stanfield, and Stühmer in 1982, after patch clamp had been established as a major tool of electrophysiology.

To achieve a loose patch clamp on a cell membrane, the pipette is moved slowly towards the cell, until the electrical resistance of the contact between the cell and the pipette increases to a few times greater resistance than that of the electrode alone. The closer the pipette gets to the membrane, the greater the resistance of the pipette tip becomes, but if too close a seal is formed, and it could become difficult to remove the pipette without damaging the cell. For the loose patch technique, the pipette does not get close enough to the membrane to form a gigaseal or a permanent connection, nor to pierce the cell membrane. The cell membrane stays intact, and the lack of a tight seal creates a small gap through which ions can pass outside the cell without entering the pipette.

A significant advantage of the loose seal is that the pipette that is used can be repeatedly removed from the membrane after recording, and the membrane will remain intact. This allows repeated measurements in a variety of locations on the same cell without destroying the integrity of the membrane. This flexibility has been especially useful to researchers for studying muscle cells as they contract under real physiological conditions, obtaining recordings quickly, and doing so without resorting to drastic measures to stop the muscle fibers from contracting. A major disadvantage is that the resistance between the pipette and the membrane is greatly reduced, allowing current to leak through the seal, and significantly reducing the resolution of small currents. This leakage can be partially corrected for, however, which offers the opportunity to compare and contrast recordings made from different areas on the cell of interest. Given this, it has been estimated that the loose patch technique can resolve currents smaller than 1 mA/cm2.

=== Patch-Seq ===
A combination of cellular imaging, RNA sequencing and patch clamp this method is used to fully characterize neurons across multiple modalities. As neural tissues are one of the most transcriptomically diverse populations of cells, classifying neurons into cell types in order to understand the circuits they form is a major challenge for neuroscientists. Combining classical classification methods with single cell RNA-sequencing post-hoc has proved to be difficult and slow. By combining multiple data modalities such as electrophysiology, sequencing and microscopy, Patch-seq allows for neurons to be characterized in multiple ways simultaneously. It currently suffers from low throughput relative to other sequencing methods mainly due to the manual labor involved in achieving a successful patch-clamp recording on a neuron. Investigations are currently underway to automate patch-clamp technology which will improve the throughput of patch-seq as well.

== Automatic patch clamping ==
Automated patch clamp systems have been developed in order to collect large amounts of data inexpensively in a shorter period of time. Such systems typically include a single-use microfluidic device, either an injection molded or a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cast chip, to capture a cell or cells, and an integrated electrode.

In one form of such an automated system, a pressure differential is used to force the cells being studied to be drawn towards the pipette opening until they form a gigaseal. Then, by briefly exposing the pipette tip to the atmosphere, the portion of the membrane protruding from the pipette bursts, and the membrane is now in the inside-out conformation, at the tip of the pipette. In a completely automated system, the pipette and the membrane patch can then be rapidly moved through a series of different test solutions, allowing different test compounds to be applied to the intracellular side of the membrane during recording.

<doc id="634056" wikidata="Q990430" url="?curid=634056" title="Kingdome">
<text>The Kingdome (officially the King County Stadium) was a multi-purpose stadium located in the Industrial District (later SoDo) neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States. Owned and operated by King County, it was best known as the home stadium of the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL) and the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball (MLB); it was also home to the Seattle SuperSonics of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1978 to 1985 and additionally served as both the home outdoor and indoor venue for the Seattle Sounders of the North American Soccer League (NASL). The Kingdome measured wide from its inside walls.

The idea of constructing a covered stadium for a major league football or baseball team was first proposed to Seattle officials in 1959. Voters rejected separate measures to approve public funding for such a stadium in 1960 and 1966, but the outcome was different in 1968; King County voters approved the issue of $40 million in municipal bonds to construct the stadium. Construction began in 1972 and the stadium opened in 1976 as the home of the Sounders and Seahawks. The Mariners moved in the following year, and the SuperSonics moved in the year after that, only to move back to the Seattle Center Coliseum in 1985. The stadium hosted several major sports events, including the Soccer Bowl in August 1976, the Pro Bowl in January 1977, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in July 1979, the NBA All-Star Game in 1987, and the NCAA Final Four in 1984, 1989, and 1995.

During the 1990s, the Seahawks&#x27; and Mariners&#x27; respective ownership groups began to question the suitability of the Kingdome as a venue for each team, threatening to relocate unless new, publicly funded stadiums were built. An issue was that neither team saw their shared tenancy as profitable; both teams also questioned the integrity of the stadium&#x27;s roof as highlighted by the collapse of ceiling tiles onto the seating area before a scheduled Mariners game in 1994. As a result, public funding packages for new, purpose-built stadiums for the Mariners and Seahawks were respectively approved in 1995 and 1997.

The Mariners moved to Safeco Field, now known as T-Mobile Park, midway through the 1999 season, and the Seahawks temporarily moved to Husky Stadium after the 1999 season. On March 26, 2000, the Kingdome was demolished by implosion. The Seahawks&#x27; new stadium, now known as Lumen Field, was built on the site and opened in 2002. King County finally paid off the bonds used to build and repair the Kingdome in 2015, fifteen years after its demolition.

==Concept and construction==
In 1959, Seattle restaurateur David L. Cohn wrote a letter to the Seattle City Council suggesting the city needed a covered stadium for a major professional sports franchise. A domed stadium was thought to be a must because of Seattle&#x27;s frequent rain. At the time, the city had Husky Stadium and Sick&#x27;s Stadium for college football and minor league baseball, respectively, but both were deemed inadequate for a major league team.
In 1960, King County commissioners placed a $15 million bond issue measure on the ballot to fund construction of a stadium, but voters on November 8 defeated it with only 48 percent approval because of doubt the stadium could be built within that budget, and lack of a guarantee the city would have a team to play in the stadium. By 1966, the National Football League and the American League were both considering granting the city an expansion franchise, and as a result, the King County Council placed another bond issue measure on the ballot for a September vote. While it received 51.5 percent approval, it did not reach the 60 percent required to proceed; the requirement was due to a 1932 initiative that mandated a supermajority for tax levies over 40 mills.

In 1967, the American League granted Seattle an expansion franchise that would be known as the Seattle Pilots. The league clearly stated Sick&#x27;s Stadium was not adequate as a major-league stadium, and stipulated that as a condition of being awarded the franchise, bonds had to be issued to fund construction of a domed stadium that had to be completed by 1970; additionally, the capacity at Sick&#x27;s Stadium had to be expanded from 11,000 to 30,000 by Opening Day 1969, when the team was scheduled to begin playing. The Pilots were supposed to begin play in 1971 along with the Kansas City Royals. However, when Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri got wind of those plans, he demanded both teams begin play in 1969. The American League had birthed the Royals and Pilots as a result of the Kansas City Athletics moving to Oakland, and Symington would not accept the prospect of Kansas City waiting three years for baseball&#x27;s return.

On February 13, 1968, King County voters approved the issue of $40 million in bonds to fund construction of the &quot;King County Multipurpose Domed Stadium&quot; with 62 percent in favor; it was part of the Forward Thrust group of bond propositions that, among other items, had a regional rapid transit system rejected. That year, a committee considered over 100 sites throughout Seattle and King County for the stadium; they unanimously decided the best site would be on the grounds of Seattle Center, site of the 1962 World&#x27;s Fair. Community members decried the idea, claiming the committee was influenced by special interest groups.

The Pilots began play as planned in 1969, but Sick&#x27;s Stadium proved to be a problematic venue for fans, media, and visiting players alike. The Pilots only drew 677,000 fans that season, not nearly enough to break even. It soon became apparent that the Pilots would not survive long enough to move to their new stadium without new ownership. It was also obvious that the timetable for a new stadium would have to be significantly advanced, as Sick&#x27;s Stadium was completely unsuitable even for temporary use. However, a petition by stadium opponents brought the dome project to a halt. The Pilots&#x27; ownership group ran out of money by the end of the season, and with the stadium plans in limbo, the team was forced to declare bankruptcy. Despite efforts by Seattle-area businessmen to buy the team as well as an attempt to keep the team in Seattle through the court system, the Pilots were sold to Milwaukee businessman Bud Selig, who relocated the team to Milwaukee and renamed it the Milwaukee Brewers a week before the start of the 1970 season.
The push to build the domed stadium continued despite the lack of a major league sports team to occupy it. In May 1970 voters rejected the proposal to build the stadium at Seattle Center. From 1970 to 1972, the commission studied the feasibility and economic impact of building the stadium on King Street adjacent to Pioneer Square and the International District—a site that ranked at the bottom when the commission originally narrowed the field of possible sites in 1968. This drew sharp opposition primarily from the International District community, which feared the impact of the stadium on neighborhood businesses located east of the site. The King Street site was approved 8–1 by the county council in late 1971, and the groundbreaking ceremony in 1972 was held on November 2. Several protesters attended the ceremony, disrupted the speakers, and at one point threw mud balls at them.

In bidding for construction of the stadium, which had separate offers for the dome and the rest of the stadium, Donald M. Drake Construction Company of Portland, Oregon, was the winning contractor for both with respective bids of $28.9 million and $5.9 million. Peter Kiewit Sons Construction Company was the only other bidder, offering $30.57 million for the stadium and $5.8 million for the roof; the latter came with the caveat of the company using its own design consultant. To help alleviate tension between the International District community and county officials, Drake emphasized the hiring of minorities, with minorities eventually representing 13 percent of the workers at the site; a community center and a shelter were also built in the neighborhood. However, the stadium&#x27;s construction encountered numerous issues; in January 1973, six support beams for the roof were toppled as one or two of them buckled, bringing down the others in a domino effect. By January 1974, the stadium reached 50 percent completion; only reaching 60 percent completion in July, it was clear that Drake would not reach the December deadline at that point. It was also apparent that Drake was ill-prepared to work on a project with such scale, with numerous errors, delays, and short-staffing slowing down construction. Efforts to renegotiate the contract failed, and on November 22, Drake stopped work on the Kingdome. The county fired Drake on December 10, bringing in Kiewit to finish construction on the stadium.
After Ralph Wilson&#x27;s threats to move the Buffalo Bills to Seattle came to naught with the construction of Rich Stadium, on December 5, 1974, the NFL awarded Seattle an expansion franchise to occupy the new stadium; the team was later named the Seattle Seahawks. Construction lasted another two years, and the stadium held an opening ceremony on March 27, 1976. It hosted its first professional sporting event two weeks later on April 9, an exhibition soccer game between the Seattle Sounders and New York Cosmos of the NASL. It set a record for the largest soccer audience in North America at 58,120. The stadium was finished at $20 million over budget, with part of the cost overrun covered by a $12.8 million out-of-court settlement in 1980 between the county and Drake&#x27;s liability insurers.

==Surface==
Like virtually all other multi-purpose stadiums, the Kingdome featured AstroTurf artificial turf for its playing surface, with its baseball configuration featuring dirt sliding pits around each base. When it was constructed, artificial turf was considered a must because the roof was likely to inhibit the growth of natural grass, like the Astrodome&#x27;s roof.

The AstroTurf surface was first replaced in July 1983 during the MLB All-Star break; Monsanto, the then-owner of AstroTurf, won the turf replacement contract over SuperTurf (then used by the Metrodome) with a bid of $1.2 million. By request of the Mariners and Seahawks, it was replaced again in October and December 1990 at a cost of $2.56 million; the previous surface was sold off thereafter, with 25 rolls of it sold to the Tacoma Dome for $108,200. A strip 40 feet by 4 inches was ripped off left field near second base during a field invasion by celebrating fans after the Mariners won the AL West tiebreaker game in 1995; it was replaced before the first Mariners home game in the ALDS.

Before the 1990 replacement, the AstroTurf surface was converted from baseball to football configuration via the covering of the infield with turf strips; a one-piece surface was placed over the infield after the conclusion of the Mariners season. The surface was attached together via both Velcro and Ziploc fasteners. After the 1990 replacement, separate surfaces were installed for each team; the Seahawks specifically wanted a stiffer variation of AstroTurf. The replacement surfaces were attached together via zippers.

The underlying base of the surface was asphalt, with the AstroTurf essentially consisting of a carpet on top of a pad with respective thicknesses of one-half inch and five-eights inch. Lumps, holes, and ridges were also present in the surface along with gaps within its seams. These factors combined to create a playing surface that was despised by both football and baseball players alike; after the 1998 season, a survey by the NFL Players Association found that 56.7 percent of Seahawks players rated the surface as &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;fair&quot;, and was the worst-rated one in the AFC West.

Injuries from playing at the Kingdome and its contemporaries occurred more often compared to stadiums with natural grass. Of note, Seahawks running backs Sherman Smith and Curt Warner respectively suffered season-ending knee injuries in 1980 and 1984 during games at the Kingdome; additionally, the Kingdome&#x27;s surface is partly blamed for Ken Griffey Jr.&#x27;s subsequent injuries and decline in performance after the Mariners traded him to the Cincinnati Reds at the end of the 1999 season.

==Football==

===Seahawks===
The expansion Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL) played their first game ever on August 1, 1976, a preseason game against the San Francisco 49ers at the Kingdome in which they lost 27–20 before a crowd of 60,825. The Seahawks&#x27; first regular season game was against the St. Louis Cardinals at the Kingdome on September 12. The Cardinals defeated the Seahawks, 30–24, with 58,441 fans in attendance. At the end of that season, the venue hosted the Pro Bowl, the NFL&#x27;s all-star game, on January 17, 1977.

The Seahawks hosted &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games at the Kingdome twelve times in their history and were 9–3 in those games. The Seahawks and the Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders played five Monday Night games in the Kingdome in the 1980s with Seattle holding a 3–2 edge including a 37–0 blowout victory in 1986. The next year, in 1987, Bo Jackson of the Los Angeles Raiders rushed for 221 yards, the most ever on MNF, and scored 2 touchdowns. One of his scores was a 91-yard touchdown and the other was a historic plowing into Seahawks high-profile rookie linebacker Brian &quot;The Boz&quot; Bosworth.

The Seahawks regularly sold out games at the Kingdome from its inception and throughout the 1980s; 117 consecutive regular-season home games were sold out between 1979 and 1993. However, after Ken Behring took over ownership of the team from the Nordstrom family in 1988, the team began to decline in performance; after winning the AFC West that year, it suffered a franchise-worst 2–14 record in 1992. Season ticket sales, which had reached 62,000 that year with a waiting list of 30,000, gradually decreased to 46,000 in 1995, with the team averaging 46,218 in attendance over five games at the Kingdome in 1994; as a result, the Seahawks began failing to sell out games, resulting in their blackout in the Seattle market. After the blackout of the October 24, 1993 game versus the New England Patriots, one more game was blacked out that year, with five games blacked out the following year; KING-TV, which as Seattle&#x27;s NBC affiliate was the Seahawks&#x27; local broadcast home at the time, prevented further blackouts by purchasing all remaining unsold tickets for three games in 1993 and two games in 1994.

In the Seahawks&#x27; heyday, the Kingdome was known as one of the loudest stadiums in the league. Opposing teams were known to practice with jet engine sounds blaring at full blast to prepare for the painfully high decibel levels typical of Seahawks games. It was where Seahawks fans, who were long called &quot;the 12th Man&quot; and led the Seahawks to retire the number 12 in honor of them in 1984, made their reputation as one of the most ravenous fan bases in the NFL, a reputation that has carried over to what is now Lumen Field. The Kingdome&#x27;s reputation contributed to the NFL&#x27;s 1989 vote in favor of enacting a rule penalizing home teams for excessive crowd noise; it was especially loathed by Seahawks fans during preseason games, with fan displeasure throughout the league leading commissioner Pete Rozelle to soften enforcement of the rule before the start of the regular season. Raucous Seahawk fans at the Kingdome were also some of the earliest performers of The Wave.

The city of Seattle made numerous bids to host the Super Bowl during the Seahawks&#x27; tenure at the Kingdome. However, despite five bids over 12 years, the Kingdome was never awarded the opportunity to host a Super Bowl; its closest chance was in 1989 for Super Bowl XXVI, which was awarded to the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In its 1982 bid for Super Bowl XIX, the Seattle City Council voted to give tax exemptions to the NFL if the league selected the Kingdome to host the game.

The Seahawks played their final game at the Kingdome on January 9, 2000, suffering a first-round playoff loss to the Miami Dolphins in their first playoff appearance since the 1988 season. The Dolphins scored a fourth-quarter touchdown to win 20–17; it marked the first home playoff loss for the Seahawks as well as the first road playoff win in 28 years for the Dolphins. It was the last NFL victory for Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino and head coach Jimmy Johnson, and it was also the last event the Kingdome ever hosted before its implosion. The Seahawks had an overall record of in the Kingdome, and were 2–1 in the postseason.

===Amateur===

====College====
The first football (and college football by extension) game played in the Kingdome occurred just after it opened in 1976, when the Washington Huskies varsity team won 10–7 against a team of Husky alumni on May 1 before 20,470 fans. The Huskies looked into temporarily renting the Kingdome for the 1987 season when the north grandstand of Husky Stadium collapsed during construction on February 25; however, the Kingdome was ultimately not needed as the grandstand was completed in time for the team&#x27;s first home game against the Stanford Cardinal on September 5. (Seven years later, the Seattle Seahawks would use Husky Stadium as their home field during the first half of the 1994 season while the Kingdome&#x27;s ceiling was under repair.) 

The Kingdome also hosted a game between the Washington State Cougars and USC Trojans on October 9, 1976. With 37,268 in attendance, USC running back Ricky Bell rushed for 346 yards and set the Pac-8 single-game rushing record; the Trojans won by nine points, In 1994, under then-new athletic director Rick Dickson, the Cougars flirted with the idea of hosting an additional home game at the Kingdome starting in 1997; however, the plan never came to fruition.

In the late 1970s, the Kingdome hosted both instances of a Pacific-10 Conference all-star game called the Challenge Bowl; the bowl, sponsored by the Olympia Brewing Company, pitted an all-star team of Pac-10 players against a similar team from another conference. The Pac-10 went undefeated with a 27–20 victory (as the Pac-8) over the Big Ten on January 15, 1978, and a 36–23 victory over the Big Eight on January 13, 1979.

During the same period, the University of Puget Sound Loggers and Pacific Lutheran University Lutes also faced off at the Kingdome twice; the Loggers won both contests, defeating the Lutes 23–21 on September 17, 1977, with 13,167 in attendance, and then defeating them again 27–14 on September 23, 1978, before a crowd of 8,329. The 1977 game set a series attendance record at the time.

====Other levels====
The stadium also hosted the annual WIAA high school football state championships in an event called the Kingbowl from 1977 through 1994; the title games were moved to the Tacoma Dome in nearby Tacoma in 1995.
The Seattle and Tacoma Police Departments played a yearly game named the Bacon Bowl to raise money for charity from 1980 to 2005; the Kingdome hosted it from the beginning until 1982, then had a one-off in 1985 during a nine-year span in which the Tacoma Dome hosted the rest of the games. The Kingdome hosted the game again from 1992 to 1994 before it returned to the Tacoma Dome; the game came back for one final time in 1999 before the stadium was demolished.

==Baseball==
Shortly after the Pilots&#x27; departure for Milwaukee, the city of Seattle, King County, and the state of Washington sued the American League, claiming a breach of contract. The league agreed to grant Seattle another franchise in exchange for dropping the lawsuit, and the team that would later be known as the Seattle Mariners was born.

The Mariners held their first game in franchise history at the Kingdome on April 6, 1977, against the California Angels. The Angels shut out the Mariners 7–0 in front of a sellout crowd of 57,762. The first pitch was a strike thrown by the Mariners&#x27; Diego Seguí to Jerry Remy. In the top of the first inning, Don Baylor registered the first hit at the stadium with a double that scored Remy, who had stolen second and third base after drawing a walk from Seguí. The Mariners&#x27; first batter, Dave Collins, struck out; however, the next batter, José Báez, singled for the franchise&#x27;s first ever hit. The first home run at the venue was hit in the top of the third inning by Joe Rudi; designated hitter Juan Bernhardt scored the Mariners&#x27; first home run in their fifth game at the Kingdome on April 10. The Mariners had their first win at the Kingdome and team history two games after the opener (they were also shut out in their second game 2–0), defeating the Angels 7–6 on April 8 via a walk-off double from Larry Milbourne. The venue hosted the All-Star Game on July 17, 1979.

The Kingdome was somewhat problematic as a baseball venue. Foul territory was quite large, and seats in the upper deck as far as from home plate. Part of the problem was that the Kingdome was not a multipurpose stadium in the truest sense. Instead, it was built as a football stadium that could convert into a baseball stadium. For instance, most fans in the outfield seats on the 300 level were unable to see parts of right and center field; these areas were not part of the football playing field.
For most of the Mariners&#x27; first 18 years, their poor play (they did not have a winning season until 1991) combined with the Kingdome&#x27;s design, led to poor attendance. Some writers and fans called it &quot;the Tomb&quot; (because of its gray concrete and lack of noise) and &quot;Puget Puke.&quot; After their inaugural home opener, the Mariners didn&#x27;t have another sellout for the next 1,018 home games until their 1990 home opener on April 13. At one point the Mariners covered seats in the upper decks in right and right-center with a tarp in order to make the stadium feel &quot;less empty&quot;. Additionally, the Kingdome&#x27;s acoustics created problems for stadium announcers, who had to deal with significant echo issues. However, when the team&#x27;s fortunes began to change in the mid-1990s and they began drawing larger crowds, especially in the post-season, the noise created an electric atmosphere and gave the home team a distinct advantage similar to the effect on football games. The average attendance of 22,064 in 1995 was the lowest in three years with the removal of nine home games for the season, but when put in perspective, it was still higher compared to any of the Mariners&#x27; first 14 seasons.

Despite its cavernous interior, the Kingdome&#x27;s field dimensions were relatively small. It had a reputation as a hitter&#x27;s park, especially in the 1990s when Ken Griffey Jr., Edgar Martínez, Jay Buhner, Alex Rodriguez, and other sluggers played there.

The large number of in-play objects—speakers, roof support wires and streamers—contributed to an &quot;arena baseball&quot; feel. The Kingdome was somewhat improved in 1982 with the addition of a wall in right field nicknamed the &quot;Walla Walla&quot; (after the city in southeastern Washington); a nearly $100,000 Daktronics out-of-town scoreboard was later installed on it in 1990. In 1990 and 1991, the moving of home plate closer to the backstop, the addition of box seats down the third base line and the removal of a few rows of seats in left field reduced foul territory and made the outfield dimensions longer and asymmetrical.

In its early years, the outfield was symmetrical with a uniform wall height: deep in center, and short elsewhere. For the All-Star Game in 1979, center field was , power alleys were , and the foul lines were ; the unpadded wall was green with a top yellow stripe, approximately in height and did not have the power alley distances listed on it. Down the lines, the distance was also listed in fathoms (52.7 fm), presumably to maintain a nautical theme in line with the team name; however, this practice was ditched after the 1980 season. Like the Kingdome&#x27;s contemporaries, the bullpens were located in foul territory adjacent to the baselines and the stands.

The longest game in the Kingdome took place on July 30, 1998, when the Cleveland Indians defeated the Mariners 9–8 in 17 innings via a three-run homer from Manny Ramirez off Bob Wells; Paul Shuey staved off a comeback by the Mariners in the bottom of the inning to end the game the next morning after five hours and 23 minutes.

The most noteworthy baseball game in the Kingdome&#x27;s history took place on October 8, 1995; in the rubber game of the ALDS, the Mariners defeated the New York Yankees 6–5 in 11 innings in front of 57,411 raucous fans. In the bottom of the 11th, Martinez doubled to left, sending Joey Cora and Griffey home with the winning runs and vaulting the Mariners into the ALCS for the first time in franchise history.

On May 2, 1996, a game at the Kingdome between the Mariners and the Cleveland Indians was suspended in the bottom of the seventh inning because of a minor earthquake. The earthquake, estimated at a magnitude of 5.3 to 5.4, occurred during a pitching change as Indians&#x27; pitcher Orel Hershiser was walking off the mound following a home run by Edgar Martínez. After an inspection by engineers, the game was continued the next evening, resulting in a 6–4 win for the Indians.

Seguí, who retired from professional baseball after the 1977 season, was invited by the Mariners to throw the ceremonial last pitch after the final Mariners game at the Kingdome in 1999. However, while they were able to make the tickets and reservations for Seguí, a payment mix-up prevented him from boarding the flight out of Kansas City International Airport on the day of the game; the incident made him irate such that he refused to visit Seattle again until 2012, when he was invited as part of the Mariners&#x27; 35th anniversary celebration. Despite the disappointment from Seguí&#x27;s son, then-Mariners first baseman David Segui, the ceremony went on as planned; David&#x27;s son, then-seven-year-old Cory Segui, threw the last pitch to Bob Stinson, who was the Mariners&#x27; catcher in their first game.

In 1989, Griffey Jr. hit a home run in his first-ever plate appearance at the Kingdome on April 10. On June 27, 1999, Griffey Jr. hit the last home run ever at the Kingdome against the Texas Rangers. The Mariners played 1,755 games at the Kingdome, compiling an overall home record of during their 22½-season tenure there.

==Basketball==

===SuperSonics===

Besides the Mariners and Seahawks, the stadium also hosted the Seattle SuperSonics of the National Basketball Association (NBA) for seven seasons. The SuperSonics, having previously played at the Seattle Center Coliseum, announced on July 29, 1977, that they intended to move into the Kingdome for the 1978–79 season after the expiration of their contract with the city of Seattle, the owner of the Coliseum; the team pushed for a move to the Kingdome after the city balked at a $30 million plan to expand the Coliseum to 20,000 seats the previous year. On August 22, the King County Council voted 7–2 to approve a 17-year lease with the SuperSonics, with the agreement signed the following day. The following week, the council unanimously voted on August 29 to spend $1.5 million on improvements to the Kingdome in preparation for the team; the team would pay the same amount over the first seven years as part of the agreement. Additional terms of the agreement had the SuperSonics pay the county 10 percent of ticket sale proceeds (not including admissions taxes) and $2,539 in personnel costs per game; the county additionally kept all game concession and parking revenue. On the same day as the agreement signing, longtime Kingdome critic Frank Ruano filed a referendum petition in an attempt to halt the move, but he announced on September 17 that he would withdraw support from the petition for lack of support.

While the SuperSonics had played a few games at the Kingdome over the previous two seasons, their full-time tenancy required the addition of 5,000 portable stadium seats added onto the floor of the arena as well as additional scoreboards and a new basketball court. The center circle of the court was positioned over first base, with the court itself laid parallel and adjacent to the right-field seats; the portable seats were positioned across the court with one end hovering over home plate.

The first SuperSonics game in the Kingdome under the agreement was an exhibition game versus the Portland Trail Blazers on September 22, 1978. A few weeks later, a crowd of 15,219 watched as the SuperSonics defeated the Chicago Bulls, 104–86, on October 14 in their first regular-season game as a tenant. Captain Fred Brown and leading scorer Gus Williams helped lead the team to their first and only championship that season, defeating the Washington Bullets in the Finals and avenging their Finals loss to them the previous season. At the time, the Kingdome was known in the NBA for being the noisiest arena for basketball and for having the largest crowds, with stadium vendor Bill Scott ( Bill the Beerman) taking the duties as cheerleader.

In the 1979–80 season, the SuperSonics set an NBA record average attendance of 21,725 fans per game (since broken). The SuperSonics set the NBA single-game playoff attendance record at 39,457 during Game 4 of the 1978 NBA Finals; they set it again on April 15, 1980, during a conference semifinal game against the Milwaukee Bucks with an attendance record of 40,172 (also since broken). The Kingdome regular season, single-game attendance record of 38,067 was set on November 22, 1991, when the SuperSonics faced the Chicago Bulls.

While leaving a SuperSonics game on February 16, 1983, a 21-year-old man from Olympia fell off a ramp and plunged 47 feet to his death; this was despite the installation of signs warning about the chest-level barriers the previous year.

Logistics would be a problem throughout the team&#x27;s tenure at the Kingdome because the Seahawks and Mariners had scheduling priority over them, especially during the playoffs when the Mariners were playing there at the same time in the spring. As part of the 1977 agreement, King County agreed to pay the SuperSonics $15,000 for each game (up to five) that was moved elsewhere because of booking issues. Even then, the scheduling priority meant that the SuperSonics would only play home playoff games at the Kingdome while the Mariners were on the road, with most of the games played at the Coliseum; the team even had to use Hec Edmundson Pavilion at the University of Washington for a few games when both the Kingdome and the Coliseum were unavailable.

Along with the scheduling issues, as with other multipurpose stadiums used by the NBA the Kingdome proved itself to be a less-than-ideal venue for basketball. Although the Kingdome&#x27;s capacity allowed the SuperSonics to set attendance records, the vast space it afforded meant that it did not have the intimate environment of a dedicated arena; furthermore, fans were displeased about the poor sight lines and cold temperatures in the Kingdome. All these factors, plus dwindling attendance due to poor team performance towards the end of their tenancy at the Kingdome, led SuperSonics general manager Zollie Volchok to sign a 10-year contract with the city of Seattle in 1983, agreeing to have the team move back to the Coliseum after the 1984–85 season in exchange for upgrades there.

The SuperSonics faced the Phoenix Suns at the Kingdome on April 7, 1985, in their final game as a regular tenant, losing 110–125 with 5,672 in attendance. However, exemplifying the scheduling issues, it was not their final home game of the season; the SuperSonics were forced to play at the Tacoma Dome on April 11 because the Mariners hosted the Oakland Athletics at the Kingdome that day. By that point, the SuperSonics had an average attendance of 7,399, failing to surpass 10,000 seats sold in 29 of 37 games held at the Kingdome in their final season there.

Despite calling the Coliseum home again, the SuperSonics still played occasionally at the Kingdome over the next few years when large crowds were anticipated; as such, the SuperSonics hosted the 1987 NBA All-Star Game there, having previously hosted the 1974 game at the Coliseum before the Kingdome opened. However, SuperSonics owner Barry Ackerley, who had bought the team from Sam Schulman in October 1983 after the Coliseum deal was signed, started seeking a new arena for them in 1989; team president Bob Whitsitt claimed that the Coliseum was outdated and leaking. Ackerley proposed to build a new arena south of the Kingdome (where T-Mobile Park stands today), but the plan was initially rejected by King County because of objections from the Seahawks and Mariners over inadequate parking. The plan was eventually approved by the Seattle City Council 7–1 on May 30, 1990, but it was ultimately scrapped the following year on June 26 because of issues in financing it; as a compromise measure, the Coliseum was rebuilt as KeyArena during the 1994–95 season, with the SuperSonics playing home games at the Tacoma Dome instead of the closer Kingdome in the meantime. The SuperSonics played at KeyArena until they were controversially relocated to Oklahoma City by owner Clay Bennett after the 2007–08 season.

The SuperSonics played 303 games at the Kingdome in total, including 14 playoff games; they held an overall record of and a playoff record of at the stadium. Of those games, 20 of them had attendances of 30,000 or more.

===College===
The first men&#x27;s college basketball game at the Kingdome was held on January 9, 1984, when the Washington Huskies defeated the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, 63–61, in the second overtime in front of 7,466 fans. The Huskies held their only other basketball game at the Kingdome more than a decade later, defeating the Old Dominion Monarchs 71–61 on December 22, 1994, with 4,187 in attendance.

The only women&#x27;s basketball game at the Kingdome was held on December 6, 1979, when the Soviet national team beat Seattle University 135-45, before 7,239 spectators.

====Final Four====
The NCAA Final Four of men&#x27;s college basketball was held three times at the Kingdome, with the stadium hosting the 1984, 1989, and 1995 editions. The 1984 championship game saw the Georgetown Hoyas defeat the Houston Cougars, 84–75. Meanwhile, the 1989 championship game had the Michigan Wolverines beat the Seton Hall Pirates, 80–79, in overtime because of a controversial last-second foul call against the Pirates. Finally, with the 1995 championship game, the UCLA Bruins defeated the Arkansas Razorbacks, 89–78, to win their first championship since the retirement of coach John Wooden twenty years earlier in 1975.

The Kingdome was not the first venue in Seattle to host the Final Four; Hec Edmundson Pavilion had previously hosted it in 1949 and 1952. However, the Kingdome is credited with helping shape the Final Four into an event with a stature comparable to that of the Super Bowl because of its large capacity. It was the only such capable venue on the West Coast of the United States; the last time a non-Seattle West Coast site hosted the game was when the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena hosted it in 1972. The 1995 edition was the last time that Seattle hosted a Final Four, and it will likely remain that way for the foreseeable future since the Kingdome&#x27;s successors were not designed with a controlled environment in mind; it also remains the last time that the Final Four was held on the West Coast. The Final Four was not held again in the Western United States until 2017, when University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, hosted it for the Phoenix area.

===Other===
On February 18, 1979, the Harlem Globetrotters held an exhibition game at the Kingdome with close to 23,000 in attendance, of which around 3,500 were under 12 years old.

As a result of the boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics by the United States, the U.S. Olympic team faced off against a squad of NBA players in a six-game exhibition tournament called the &quot;Gold Medal Series&quot; that June. On June 20, the NBA All-Stars defeated the U.S. Olympic team, 78–76, before a crowd of 10,902; it was the only victory by the NBA squad in the tournament.

The Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA) held their 3A and 4A high school basketball state tournament five times at the Kingdome between 1993 and 1999. The boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; games were held simultaneously until the championship, at which point they took turns playing on a single court.

==Soccer==

===Sounders===
The Seattle Sounders of the North American Soccer League (NASL) were the first tenant to move into the Kingdome upon its opening, having played at Memorial Stadium for their first two seasons. As a result, they held the honor of hosting the first sporting event at the Kingdome with an exhibition game versus the New York Cosmos on April 9, 1976; the Cosmos defeated them 3–1 with 58,128 fans in attendance. Highlighting the secondary treatment of the Sounders, about 5,000 seats were not yet installed when the game occurred. Just weeks later, they hosted their first regular-season game in the Kingdome on April 26, defeating the Portland Timbers 1–0 via a Geoff Hurst penalty kick in the second overtime before 24,983 spectators.

The largest crowd to attend a Sounders match, regular or postseason, occurred on August 25, 1977, when 56,256 spectators watched as they defeated the Los Angeles Aztecs 1–0 in the second game of the Pacific Conference Final to advance to their first Soccer Bowl. The Sounders&#x27; regular-season attendance record was set on August 9, 1980, when the Cosmos defeated them 1–0 in front of 49,606 fans. Overall, the team drew an average attendance of 20,183 from 1975 to 1982, peaking in the 1980 season with an average attendance of 24,247.

Along with traditional soccer, the Sounders participated in NASL indoor soccer for the 1980–81 and 1981–82 seasons. However, the 1983 outdoor season proved to be a dire one for the Sounders; with the team&#x27;s front office heavily cutting costly foreign players from the roster, the team suffered their worst season ever performance-wise, resulting in a record low average attendance of 8,181. That season additionally saw the smallest crowd to attend a Sounders game, with only 4,270 spectators on hand to witness their 3–1 victory over the Tulsa Roughnecks on July 27. With the cuts not enough to keep the team afloat, the owners ultimately elected to fold it that year on September 6; their final home game was a 3–2 victory over the San Diego Sockers on August 25 with 7,331 fans in attendance.

The Kingdome hosted the NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Soccer Championship Finals twice in consecutive years. The final on December 17, 1984, featured the Clemson Tigers, coached by Dr. I. M. Ibrahim, and defending national champion Indiana Hoosiers, headed by coach Jerry Yeagley; 7,926 spectators watched as the Tigers won 2–1 in regulation to bring home their first national championship in soccer and deny the Hoosiers a third straight title. A year later, on December 14, 1985, a crowd of 5,986 watched as the UCLA Bruins defeated the American Eagles 1–0 after eight overtime periods to win their first national soccer championship; Bruin coach Sigi Schmid went on to coach the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS), a phoenix club of the NASL Sounders, from its inaugural season in 2009 to 2016.

===Other professional games===
A game of the 1976 U.S.A. Bicentennial Cup tournament was held at the Kingdome on May 28, with Brazil defeating Team America 2–0 before 20,245 spectators.

The Kingdome also hosted the NASL&#x27;s championship game, the Soccer Bowl, between the Minnesota Kicks and the Toronto Metros-Croatia on August 28, 1976; the Metros-Croatia defeated the Kicks 3–0 before a crowd of 25,765, setting an NASL championship attendance record at the time.

A CONCACAF Championship qualifier for the 1978 FIFA World Cup was hosted at the Kingdome on October 20, 1976; the game, which saw the United States defeat Canada 2–0 before a crowd of 17,675, was the first instance of a World Cup qualifier that was held indoors.

A doubleheader featuring both the U.S. Olympic and national squads was held at the Kingdome on February 3, 1979. The U.S. Olympic team defeated the Canadian Olympic team 2–0 in the first game, while the Soviet national team defeated the U.S. national team 3–1 in the second game; 13,317 spectators were present for both games.

The Kingdome was additionally considered in Seattle&#x27;s bid to be a host city for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, but it was rejected in favor of Husky Stadium because of concerns over its indoor environment and its turf; the bid ultimately failed in part because of apprehension from the University of Washington.

==Other events==
Upon its opening, the Kingdome served as one of the main convention centers in Seattle alongside the Seattle Center Coliseum. During preliminary studies for the then-proposed Washington State Convention Center (now the Seattle Convention Center) in the early 1980s, a proposal to build it on the stadium&#x27;s northern parking lot was floated, but it was never seriously considered and ultimately rejected by the convention center board in favor of building it in the Downtown area.

The largest crowd to attend a single event in the Kingdome came early, during an eight-day Billy Graham crusade in 1976. The Friday night edition on May 14 drew 74,000 and featured singer Johnny Cash; 5,000 were turned away. The stadium was also part of Seattle&#x27;s bid to host the 1988 Republican National Convention, but it ultimately failed because of a scheduling conflict with the Mariners.

Country singer CW McCall performed 8 shows during the 4-day Custom Van, Truck, 4-Wheel Drive and Motorcycle Show, March 17–20, 1977.
The Kingdome hosted a round of the AMA Supercross Championship from 1978 to 1999.

===Concerts===
Numerous rock concerts were held in the venue, despite significant echo and sound delay problems attributable to the structure&#x27;s cavernous size.

==Final years==

The loss of the Sounders and Sonics in the mid-1980s caused financial constraints as the Kingdome was left with 59 unfilled days in their annual schedule. By the 1990s, multi-purpose stadiums fell out of favor with the public, and the Kingdome&#x27;s suitability as an NFL and MLB venue came into doubt as a result. Neither the Seahawks&#x27; nor the Mariners&#x27; respective ownership groups saw the shared stadium arrangement as economically feasible because the Kingdome was unable to meet the needs of both tenants; they also noted the lack of revenue-generating luxury suites prominent in newer stadiums. After several years of threats to relocate the Mariners because of poor attendance and revenue, then-owner Jeff Smulyan put the team up for sale on December 6, 1991; he subsequently received approval by MLB to sell the team to an ownership group led by Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi on June 10, 1992. Almost immediately, the new ownership group began campaigning with local and state governments to secure public funding for a new baseball-only stadium. In March 1994, King County Executive Gary Locke appointed a task force to study the need for a baseball-only stadium.

===1994 ceiling collapse===
The Kingdome&#x27;s roof had been problematic from the beginning because of a design flaw. With the stadium&#x27;s limited budget compared to its contemporaries, its architects had the roof&#x27;s acoustic ceiling tiles serve a dual purpose as forms to pour concrete over for the roof sections. They were firmly placed via six metal clips on their edges, but the effectiveness of the clips was weakened as moisture from the polyurethane insulation accumulated in the tiles because it lacked proper water vapor management. As a result, leaks were discovered in the roof three months before the stadium opened, and several attempts at repairs made the situation worse or were quickly undone.

In 1993, the county decided to strip off the outer roof coating and replace it with a special coating. Sandblasting failed to strip the old roof material off, and the contractor changed its method to pressure washing. This pressure-washing resulted in water seepage through the roof, and on July 19, 1994, four , waterlogged acoustic ceiling tiles fell into the seating area. The tiles fell while the Mariners were on the field preparing for a scheduled game against the Baltimore Orioles, a half-hour before the gates were to open for fans to enter the stadium. As a result, the Kingdome was closed for repairs.

The Mariners were forced to play the last 20 games of the 1994 season on the road after the players&#x27; union vetoed playing the &quot;home&quot; games at Cheney Stadium in Tacoma, BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia, or a neutral site because the union believed that its members should play only in major-league venues. The extended road trip could have lasted over two months, but it was shortened because of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, which began on August 12 and ended up canceling the remainder of the 1994 MLB season; the strike also resulted in a delay to the start of the 1995 season. The Seahawks had to play both their two preseason home games and their first three regular-season home games of the 1994 season at nearby Husky Stadium.

The Kingdome held a reopening ceremony the weekend of November 4–6, 1994, which culminated with the Seahawks returning to the stadium for a regular-season game against the Cincinnati Bengals. Repairing the roof ultimately cost US$51 million, and two construction workers lost their lives in a crane accident on August 17 during the repair. The incident also motivated plans to replace the stadium.

===Replacement===

On September 19, 1995, King County voters defeated a ballot measure that would have funded the construction of a new baseball-only stadium for the Mariners. However, the following month, the Mariners made it to the MLB postseason for the first time and, on October 8, defeated the New York Yankees in the decisive fifth game of the 1995 ALDS on the heels of a walk-off game-winning double hit by Edgar Martínez. The Mariners&#x27; postseason run demonstrated that there was a fan base in Seattle that wanted the team to stay in town, and as a result, the Washington State Legislature approved a separate funding package for a new stadium on October 14.

In January 1996, Seahawks owner Ken Behring announced he was moving the team to Los Angeles and the team would play at Anaheim Stadium, which had recently been vacated as a football venue when the Los Angeles Rams moved to St. Louis (at the same time, the Los Angeles Raiders returned to Oakland, after 13 years away). His rationale for the decision included unfounded safety concerns surrounding the seismic stability of the Kingdome. Behring went so far as to relocate team headquarters to Anaheim, California, but his plans were defeated when lawyers found out that the Seahawks could not break their lease on the Kingdome until 2005. As a result, Behring tried to sell the team. He found a potential buyer in Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who stipulated that a new publicly funded stadium had to be built as a condition of his purchase of the team. Allen funded a special election held on June 17, 1997, that featured a measure that would allocate public funding for a new stadium for the Seahawks on the Kingdome site. The measure passed, Allen officially purchased the team, and the Kingdome&#x27;s fate was sealed.

Despite the intention of the Mariners to start playing at their new home at the beginning of the 1999 season, construction delays meant that installation of its retractable roof would not occur on time, leading to another sale threat by the team&#x27;s owners. However, the team eventually agreed to play at the Kingdome from the start of the season until after the All-Star Game, with construction on the new home starting on March 8, 1997. Two years later, a sold-out crowd of 56,530 watched as the Mariners defeated the Texas Rangers 5–2 in their final game at the Kingdome on June 27, 1999; they played their first game at their new home, Safeco Field, nearly three weeks later on July 15.

Meanwhile, the Seahawks temporarily relocated to Husky Stadium for two seasons following the 1999 season. To make way for construction of their new stadium, the Kingdome was stripped down and prepared for demolition. During the process, a security incident occurred on February 21, 2000, when a skateboarder disguised himself as a construction worker, climbed up onto the roof, and skated on it with two friends filming him on the nearby Alaskan Way Viaduct; demolition crews were unimpressed by the incident and implemented tighter security measures in response. On the morning of March 26, 2000 at 8:30 AM, the Kingdome was demolished by Controlled Demolition, Inc. via implosion, just one day short of 24 years after the stadium&#x27;s opening; it set a record recognized by Guinness World Records for the largest building, by volume, ever demolished by implosion. The Kingdome was the first large, domed stadium to be demolished in the United States; its demolition was also the first live event covered by ESPN Classic. The new stadium, Seahawks Stadium, eventually opened on July 20, 2002, in time for the beginning of the NFL season that year.

The Kingdome was demolished before the debt issued to finance its construction was fully paid, and as of September 2010, residents of King County were still responsible for more than $80 million in debt on the demolished stadium. The debt was retired in March 2015, nine months ahead of the original bond maturity and 15 years after the stadium&#x27;s demolition. The 2% of the 15.6% hotel/motel tax earmarked for the Kingdome debt no longer needed went instead to the county&#x27;s 4Culture program for arts, heritage, and preservation.

==Seating capacity==


==In popular culture==
Because of its versatility and its prominent position in the Seattle skyline for close to a quarter-century, the Kingdome was featured in numerous forms of media during and after its existence. On television, it served as the backdrop for a rescue in the 1978 TV movie &quot;Most Deadly Passage&quot; of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Emergency!&quot; series, which featured the work of Seattle Medic One paramedics. It was also mentioned in 1992 with the airing of &quot;Crushed&quot;, the sixteenth episode of the fifth season of ABC sitcom &quot;Full House&quot;; in the episode, guest star Tommy Page boasted to Jesse Katsopolis about playing there. The Kingdome was mentioned again in 1998 during the sixth season of NBC sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;, which was set in Seattle. In the sixth episode, &quot;Secret Admirer&quot;, Martin describes Daphne&#x27;s frustrating driving that repeatedly takes them right into various traffic delays, ending with them encountering traffic from the Kingdome. Furthermore, the Kingdome&#x27;s demolition was featured on The History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Modern Marvels&quot; series with their &quot;Concrete&quot; episode that first aired on May 31, 2000.

The Kingdome was not limited to just television mentions; numerous songs mentioned it in their lyrics. While playing with the Mariners, Lenny Randle recorded a song titled &quot;Kingdome&quot; with some of his teammates and family members in order to raise money to buy a speech synthesizer for a young fan with cerebral palsy. Rock band Foo Fighters mentioned the stadium in the refrain of &quot;New Way Home&quot;, which was featured on their 1997 album, &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot;. Rapper Macklemore also mentioned the Kingdome in &quot;My Oh My&quot;, a 2011 song that paid tribute to Dave Niehaus, the longtime play-by-play announcer of the Mariners who had recently died; in it, he talks about growing up in Seattle and going to the Kingdome. The song mentions the Double in the Mariners–Yankees 1995 ALDS, and its accompanying music video also contains footage of the Kingdome&#x27;s demolition.

With the rise of 3D computer graphics, video games started to depict the Kingdome as well. The Gran Turismo series of racing games on the PlayStation line of consoles featured the Kingdome in the Seattle Circuit race track, a street circuit based on the roads of Seattle. Seattle Circuit is featured in Gran Turismo 2, Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec, Gran Turismo 4, Tourist Trophy, and Gran Turismo PSP. Despite the Kingdome&#x27;s demolition occurring before the game was released, Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec still featured it in the track. The Kingdome also made an appearance in the 2007 RTS game &quot;World in Conflict&quot;, in which it was destroyed by Soviet artillery during a Soviet invasion of Seattle in an alternate timeline.

<doc id="634058" wikidata="Q7756461" url="?curid=634058" title="The Pee-wee Herman Show">
<text>The Pee-wee Herman Show is a stage show developed by Paul Reubens in 1980. The show is the first significant appearance of Reubens&#x27; fictional comic character, Pee-wee Herman. The show debuted as a midnight show in February 1981 at the Groundlings theater, and was later moved to the Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood, California in September that same year, where the HBO cable network taped one of the shows and aired it as a special. The special was later released on DVD by Image Entertainment in 2006. The nightclub show had more adult humor than the later children&#x27;s television series.

==Development==
&quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot; was developed when Paul Reubens was one of twenty-two finalists to be chosen as a regular on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, which was the infamous first season of an all-new cast, and one of five seasons without the show&#x27;s creator, Lorne Michaels, as a producer. When Gilbert Gottfried was chosen over Reubens, the latter thought his career was over. According to Reubens, he was about to return home when he came up with the idea of a stage show featuring his character he had premiered in 1977, Pee-wee Herman. That year, the character had made his first appearance to a national (but mostly adult) audience when he made a cameo in &quot;Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s Next Movie&quot;. With $3,000, most of which had been wired to him from his parents, and help from 60 people working for him, including three fellow Groundlings, Phil Hartman, John Paragon and writer/director Bill Steinkellner, Reubens created the show.

==Plot==
At home in his Puppetland playhouse, Pee-wee entertains his audience of &quot;boys and girls&quot; in a homage to low-budget 1950s’ TV kiddie-shows such as &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; and &quot;Pinky Lee&quot;.

Pee-wee spends the day with his friends and fellow citizens of Puppetland, including Pterri the pterodactyl, Mr. Knucklehead, Captain Carl, Miss Yvonne, Jambi the genie in a box, Clockey the USA wall-map and clock, Mailman Mike, Hammy and his sister Susan, Hermit Hattie, and the singing next-door neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Jelly Do-nut.

Pee-wee really wants to be able to fly after he is given a wish by Jambi the genie, but he decides to give his wish away to Miss Yvonne, who wants Captain Carl to &quot;really like her&quot; and think she&#x27;s &quot;beautiful from head to toe&quot;.

During the course of his busy day, Pee-wee sings and dances, reads pen pal letters &quot;from around the world&quot; (including prison), conducts a hypnosis puppet act with a female audience member who undresses under his command, and shows a cartoon and a condensed vintage 1959 educational film about proper deportment called &quot;Beginning Responsibility: Lunchroom Manners&quot;.

Later, Pee-wee gets upset that he gave away his magic wish when he sees Captain Carl and Miss Yvonne happily on a date. After much pouting and throwing a tantrum, Pee-wee finally runs away.

The concerned citizens of Puppetland find out about Pee-wee&#x27;s secret wish and after Captain Carl reveals that he had already liked Miss Yvonne, they all realize that Pee-wee still has a wish coming. Jambi the genie then grants Pee-wee&#x27;s wish to be able to fly.

Pee-wee triumphantly soars and roars above Puppetland and proclaims that he is the &quot;luckiest boy in the world&quot;.

==Vinyl record==
Originally released in 1981, a vinyl 12&quot; one-sided hand silk-screened picture disc was released of the performance by Fatima Recordz. The cover features a drawing of Pee-wee by Gary Panter, who would later win three Emmy Awards for his set design on &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;.

Silk-screening was done by Richard Duardo but the design of the sleeve and of the album was done by Gary Panter. The paper sleeve states that it was recorded at the Roxy Theater, L.A. June 1981. All music was composed and arranged by Jay Condom except as noted.

==2010 stage show revival==
Paul Reubens told the press in interviews that he hoped his revival of his Pee-wee Herman stage show would help garner producer interest and funding for a new feature film, possibly with a new actor playing the role of Pee-wee.

&quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot; was originally scheduled for November 8–29, 2009 at the Music Box Theatre in Hollywood. Due to high demand and technical needs, the show moved venues from Music Box to Club Nokia @ LA Live with a run between January 12 and February 7, 2010. The cast rehearsed at Sunset-Gower Studios before moving to technical rehearsals at Club Nokia.

The updated show re-written by Paul Reubens contains modern references to the Internet, iPad, abstinence rings, and ShamWow. It has several new characters, including handyman Sergio, firefighter Phineas, a talking horse named Ginger (replacing the Cowntess from the TV series), and a dancing-mute Bear. Elements of the TV series, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, were merged into the stage show. The plotline of Captain Carl&#x27;s (originally played the late Phil Hartman) crush on Miss Yvonne was switched to that of Cowboy Curtis. Added to the new version were the characters Chairry, the Flowers, Mr. Window, Globey, Clockey, Mr. Knucklehead, Conky the Robot (known as Conky 3000, originally known as Conky 2000), Magic Screen and King of Cartoons from the TV series.

The revival production was produced by Scott Sanders, directed by Alex Timbers, with scenic design by David Korins and Gary Panter and original music by Jay Cotton.

After several previews that began October 26, 2010, the production opened on Broadway at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre on November 11, 2010, playing a limited engagement through January 2, 2011. The Broadway production was produced by Scott Sanders Productions, Adam S. Gordon, Allan S. Gordon, Élan V. McAllister, Roy Miller, Carol R. Fineman, Scott Zeilinger Productions/Radio Mouse Entertainment and StylesFour Productions/Randy Donaldson/Tim Laczynski, with associate producers Jared Geller, David J. Foster, Anne Caruso and Kelly Bush. The production was recorded for an HBO special, &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show on Broadway&quot;, which premiered on March 19, 2011.

<doc id="634060" wikidata="Q653305" url="?curid=634060" title="Spirometry">
<text>Spirometry (meaning &quot;the measuring of breath&quot;) is the most common of the pulmonary function tests (PFTs). It measures lung function, specifically the amount (volume) and/or speed (flow) of air that can be inhaled and exhaled. Spirometry is helpful in assessing breathing patterns that identify conditions such as asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, and COPD. It is also helpful as part of a system of health surveillance, in which breathing patterns are measured over time.

Spirometry generates pneumotachographs, which are charts that plot the volume and flow of air coming in and out of the lungs from one inhalation and one exhalation.

==Testing==

===Spirometer===
The spirometry test is performed using a device called a spirometer, which comes in several different varieties. Most spirometers display the following graphs, called spirograms:
* a &quot;volume-time curve&quot;, showing volume (litres) along the Y-axis and time (seconds) along the X-axis
* a &quot;flow-volume loop&quot;, which graphically depicts the rate of airflow on the Y-axis and the total volume inspired or expired on the X-axis

===Procedure===
The basic forced volume vital capacity (FVC) test varies slightly depending on the equipment used. It can be in the form of either closed or open circuit. Regardless of differences in testing procedure providers are recommended to follow the ATS/ERS Standardisation of Spirometry. The standard procedure ensures an accurate and objectively collected set of data, based on a common reference, to reduce incompatibility of the results when shared across differing medical groups.

The patient is asked to put on soft nose clips to prevent air escape and a breathing sensor in their mouth forming an air tight seal. Guided by a technician, the patient is given step by step instructions to take an abrupt maximum effort inhale, followed by a maximum effort exhale lasting for a target of at least 6 seconds. When assessing possible upper airway obstruction, the technician will direct the patient to make an additional rapid inhalation to complete the round. The timing of the second inhale can vary between persons depending on the length of the proceeding exhale. In some cases each round of test will be proceeded by a period of normal, gentle breathing for additional data.

===Limitations===
Clinically useful results are highly dependent on patient cooperation and effort and must be repeated for a minimum of three times to ensure reproducibility with a general limit of ten attempts. Given variable rates of effort, the results can only be underestimated given an effort output greater than 100% is not possible.

Due to the need for patient cooperation and an ability to understand and follow instructions, spirometry can typically only be done in cooperative children when they at least 5 years old or adults without physical or mental impairment preventing effective diagnostic results. In addition, General anesthesia and various forms of sedation are not compatible with the testing process.

Another limitation is that persons with intermittent or mild asthma can present normal spirometry values between acute exacerbation, reducing spirometry&#x27;s effectiveness as a diagnostic tool in these circumstances.

===Supplemental diagnostics===
Spirometry can also be part of a bronchial challenge test, used to determine bronchial hyperresponsiveness to either rigorous exercise, inhalation of cold/dry air, or with a pharmaceutical agent such as methacholine or histamine.

To assess the reversibility of a particular condition, a bronchodilator can be administered before performing another round of tests for comparison. This is commonly referred to as a &quot;reversibility test&quot;, or a &quot;post bronchodilator test&quot; (Post BD), and is an important part in diagnosing asthma versus COPD.

Other complementary lung functions tests include plethysmography and nitrogen washout.

===Indications===
Spirometry is indicated for the following reasons:
* to diagnose or manage asthma
* to detect respiratory disease in patients presenting with symptoms of breathlessness, and to distinguish respiratory from cardiac disease as the cause
* to measure bronchial responsiveness in patients suspected of having asthma
* to diagnose and differentiate between obstructive lung disease and restrictive lung disease
* to follow the natural history of disease in respiratory conditions
* to assess of impairment from occupational asthma
* to identify those at risk from pulmonary barotrauma while scuba diving
* to conduct pre-operative risk assessment before anaesthesia or cardiothoracic surgery
* to measure response to treatment of conditions which spirometry detects
* to diagnose the vocal cord dysfunction.

===Contraindications===
Forced expiratory maneuvers may aggravate some medical conditions. Spirometry should not be performed when the individual presents with:
* Hemoptysis of unknown origin
* Pneumothorax
* Unstable cardiovascular status (angina, recent myocardial infarction, etc.)
* Thoracic, abdominal, or cerebral aneurysms
* Cataracts or recent eye surgery
* Recent thoracic or abdominal surgery
* Nausea, vomiting, or acute illness
* Recent or current viral infection
* Undiagnosed hypertension

==Parameters==
The most common parameters measured in spirometry are vital capacity (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume (FEV) at timed intervals of 0.5, 1.0 (FEV1), 2.0, and 3.0 seconds, forced expiratory flow 25–75% (FEF 25–75) and maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), also known as Maximum breathing capacity. Other tests may be performed in certain situations.

Results are usually given in both raw data (litres, litres per second) and percent predicted—the test result as a percent of the &quot;predicted values&quot; for the patients of similar characteristics (height, age, sex, and sometimes race and weight). The interpretation of the results can vary depending on the physician and the source of the predicted values. Generally speaking, results nearest to 100% predicted are the most normal, and results over 80% are often considered normal. Multiple publications of predicted values have been published and may be calculated based on age, sex, weight and ethnicity. However, review by a doctor is necessary for accurate diagnosis of any individual situation.

A bronchodilator is also given in certain circumstances and a pre/post graph comparison is done to assess the effectiveness of the bronchodilator. See the example printout.

Functional residual capacity (FRC) cannot be measured via spirometry, but it can be measured with a plethysmograph or dilution tests (for example, helium dilution test).

===Forced vital capacity (FVC)===
Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out after full inspiration, measured in liters. FVC is the most basic maneuver in spirometry tests.

===Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)===
FEV1 is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out in first 1-second, after full inspiration. Average values for FEV1 in healthy people depend mainly on sex and age, according to the diagram.
Values of between 80% and 120% of the average value are considered normal. Predicted normal values for FEV1 can be calculated and depend on age, sex, height, mass and ethnicity as well as the research study that they are based on.

===FEV1/FVC ratio===
FEV1/FVC is the ratio of FEV1 to FVC. In healthy adults this should be approximately 70–80% (declining with age). In obstructive diseases (asthma, COPD, chronic bronchitis, emphysema) FEV1 is diminished because of increased airway resistance to expiratory flow; the FVC may be decreased as well, due to the premature closure of airway in expiration, just not in the same proportion as FEV1 (for instance, both FEV1 and FVC are reduced, but the former is more affected because of the increased airway resistance). This generates a reduced value (&lt;70%, often ~45%). In restrictive diseases (such as pulmonary fibrosis) the FEV1 and FVC are both reduced proportionally and the value may be normal or even increased as a result of decreased lung compliance.

A derived value of FEV1 is FEV1% predicted (FEV1%), which is defined as FEV1 of the patient divided by the average FEV1 in the population for any person of the same age, height, gender, and race.

===Forced expiratory flow (FEF)===
Forced expiratory flow (FEF) is the flow (or speed) of air coming out of the lung during the middle portion of a forced expiration.
It can be given at discrete times, generally defined by what fraction of the forced vital capacity (FVC) has been exhaled.
The usual discrete intervals are 25%, 50% and 75% (FEF25, FEF50 and FEF75), or 25% and 50% of FVC that has been exhaled.
It can also be given as a mean of the flow during an interval, also generally delimited by when specific fractions remain of FVC, usually 25–75% (FEF25–75%). Average ranges in the healthy population depend mainly on sex and age, with FEF25–75% shown in diagram at left. Values ranging from 50 to 60% and up to 130% of the average are considered normal. Predicted normal values for FEF can be calculated and depend on age, sex, height, mass and ethnicity as well as the research study that they are based on.

MMEF or MEF stands for maximal (mid-)expiratory flow and is the peak of expiratory flow as taken from the flow-volume curve and measured in liters per second. It should theoretically be identical to peak expiratory flow (PEF), which is, however, generally measured by a peak flow meter and given in liters per minute.

Recent research suggests that FEF25-75% or FEF25-50% may be a more sensitive parameter than FEV1 in the detection of obstructive small airway disease. However, in the absence of concomitant changes in the standard markers, discrepancies in mid-range expiratory flow may not be specific enough to be useful, and current practice guidelines recommend continuing to use FEV1, VC, and FEV1/VC as indicators of obstructive disease.

More rarely, forced expiratory flow may be given at intervals defined by how much remains of total lung capacity. In such cases, it is usually designated as e.g. FEF70%TLC, FEF60%TLC and FEF50%TLC.

===Forced inspiratory flow 25–75% or 25–50%===
Forced inspiratory flow 25–75% or 25–50% (FIF 25–75% or 25–50%) is similar to FEF 25–75% or 25–50% except the measurement is taken during inspiration.

===Peak expiratory flow (PEF)===

Peak expiratory flow (PEF) is the maximal flow (or speed) achieved during the maximally forced expiration initiated at full inspiration, measured in liters per minute or in liters per second.

===Tidal volume (TV)===
Tidal volume is the amount of air inhaled or exhaled normally at rest.

===Total lung capacity (TLC)===
Total lung capacity (TLC) is the maximum volume of air present in the lungs.

===Diffusing capacity (DLCO)===
Diffusing capacity (or DLCO) is the carbon monoxide uptake from a single inspiration in a standard time (usually 10 seconds). During the test the person inhales a test gas mixture that consisting of regular air that includes an inert tracer gas and CO, less than one percent. Since hemoglobin has a greater affinity to CO than oxygen the breath-hold time can be only 10 seconds, which is a sufficient amount of time for this transfer of CO to occur. Since the inhaled amount of CO is known, the exhaled CO is subtracted to determine the amount transferred during the breath-hold time. The tracer gas is analyzed simultaneously with CO to determine the distribution of the test gas mixture. This test will pick up diffusion impairments, for instance in pulmonary fibrosis. This must be corrected for anemia (a low hemoglobin concentration will reduce DLCO) and pulmonary hemorrhage (excess RBC&#x27;s in the interstitium or alveoli can absorb CO and artificially increase the DLCO capacity). Atmospheric pressure and/or altitude will also affect measured DLCO, and so a correction factor is needed to adjust for standard pressure.

===Maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV)===

Maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) is a measure of the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled and exhaled within one minute. For the comfort of the patient this is done over a 15-second time period before being extrapolated to a value for one minute expressed as liters/minute. Average values for males and females are 140–180 and 80–120 liters per minute respectively.

===Static lung compliance (Cst)===
When estimating static lung compliance, volume measurements by the spirometer needs to be complemented by pressure transducers in order to simultaneously measure the transpulmonary pressure. When having drawn a curve with the relations between changes in volume to changes in transpulmonary pressure, Cst is the slope of the curve during any given volume, or, mathematically, ΔV/ΔP. Static lung compliance is perhaps the most sensitive parameter for the detection of abnormal pulmonary mechanics. It is considered normal if it is 60% to 140% of the average value in the population for any person of similar age, sex and body composition.

In those with acute respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation, &quot;the static compliance of the total respiratory system is conventionally obtained by dividing the tidal volume by the difference between the &#x27;plateau&#x27; pressure measured at the airway opening (PaO) during an occlusion at end-inspiration and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set by the ventilator&quot;.

===Others===
Forced Expiratory Time (FET)&lt;br&gt;
Forced Expiratory Time (FET) measures the length of the expiration in seconds.

Slow vital capacity (SVC)&lt;br&gt;
Slow vital capacity (SVC) is the maximum volume of air that can be exhaled slowly after slow maximum inhalation.

Maximal pressure (Pmax and Pi)
&lt;br&gt;
Pmax is the asymptotically maximal pressure that can be developed by the respiratory muscles at any lung volume and Pi is the maximum inspiratory pressure that can be developed at specific lung volumes. This measurement also requires pressure transducers in addition. It is considered normal if it is 60% to 140% of the average value in the population for any person of similar age, sex and body composition. A derived parameter is the coefficient of retraction (CR) which is Pmax/TLC .

Mean transit time (MTT)&lt;br&gt;
Mean transit time is the area under the flow-volume curve divided by the forced vital capacity.
Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP)
MIP, also known as negative inspiratory force (NIF), is the maximum pressure that can be generated against an occluded airway beginning at functional residual capacity (FRC). It is a marker of respiratory muscle function and strength. Represented by centimeters of water pressure (cmH2O) and measured with a manometer. Maximum inspiratory pressure is an important and noninvasive index of diaphragm strength and an independent tool for diagnosing many illnesses. Typical maximum inspiratory pressures in adult males can be estimated from the equation, MIP = 142 - (1.03 x Age) cmH2O, where age is in years.

<doc id="634063" wikidata="Q6263168" url="?curid=634063" title="John Waters (columnist)">
<text>John Waters (born 28 May 1955) is a far-right Irish columnist, political candidate and author. He started his career with music and politics magazine, Hot Press, and also wrote for the Sunday Tribune newspaper. He later edited the social magazine In Dublin, and the investigative and current affairs magazine Magill. He became a regular columnist at the Irish Times and then the Irish Independent, while authoring some works on non-fiction, and developed &quot;The Whoseday Book&quot;, which raised 3 million euros for charity. He has also been a member of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.

Waters was an unsuccessful independent candidate in the 2020 Irish general election for Dún Laoghaire constituency. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Midlands–North-West constituency at the 2024 European Parliament election.

== Personal life ==
Waters was born on in Castlerea, County Roscommon to Thomas (1904–1989) and Mary Ita Waters (née McGrath; 1920–2012). From a relationship with singer Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, he has a daughter, born in 1996 in London. Following her birth, a long legal custody battle ensued resulting in Waters having custody of his daughter and living with her in Dalkey.

He suffered from an alcohol addiction until 1989 when he gave it up completely, a decision that he credits with transforming his life. He married Rita Simons in December 2014.

==Career==
===Early career===
Waters&#x27;s career began in 1981 with the Irish political and music magazine &quot;Hot Press&quot;. He wrote for the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; and later edited &quot;In Dublin&quot; magazine from 1985 to 1987 and &quot;Magill&quot;.

Waters has written several books and, in 1998, he devised &quot;The Whoseday Book&quot; — which contains quotes, writings and pictures of 365 Irish writers and musicians – raising €3 million for the Irish Hospice Foundation.

===Irish Times and Irish Independent===
Waters wrote a weekly column for &quot;The Irish Times&quot; from 1990 to 2014. He was briefly fired during a dispute with the then editor, Geraldine Kennedy, but was shortly thereafter reinstated.

In March 2014, Waters left &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, and shortly after started writing columns for the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; and &quot;Irish Independent&quot;.On 13 July 2014 the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; published what it described as Waters&#x27; first column for the paper. He has since written regular columns for that paper and its sister the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;. In 2018 he released a new book called &quot;Give Us Back the Bad Roads&quot;. 

===Other work===
Waters is a fortnightly contributor to the American journal &quot;First Things&quot; and is a Permanent Research Fellow at the Center for Ethics and Culture, University of Notre Dame.

In August 2021, John Waters and Gemma O&#x27;Doherty launched a freesheet newspaper titled &quot;The Irish Light&quot;, largely consisting of anti-vaccine propaganda and other conspiracy theories. It is run in conjunction with &quot;The Light&quot;, a UK publication, and reprints much of the UK version&#x27;s articles.

==Politics and advocacy==
Waters was an active participant in the Catholic cultural movement Communion and Liberation. He has given at least one talk to the Iona Institute.

He was a member of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland until he resigned in January 2014, during which time he was a litigant seeking damages from the broadcaster RTÉ.

In 2015, he became involved with First Families First in calling for a &#x27;No&#x27; vote in the referendum for the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015.

In February 2018 he appeared with Nigel Farage at an Irexit conference organised by Hermann Kelly. The conference described itself as open &quot;only to supporters of an Irish exit from the European Union&quot;. There were several members of the far-right National Party - headed by Justin Barrett - at the conference. Waters denied that Ireland was a republic, state or democracy. Waters was quoted as saying &quot;We have to remove the media because they don’t permit us to have the conversation&quot; to which the crowd responded enthusiastically. They also applauded his claim that immigrants &quot;have no affinity or allegiance to the countries they end up in&quot; and that &quot;[t]his is our fault because we don’t demand it&quot;. He claimed that &quot;Europeans no longer have a place to call home&quot; and that European Christianity was being eroded by &quot;metastatic cancer&quot;.

In 2019 he appeared in a number of podcasts with Gemma O&#x27;Doherty and Justin Barrett.
===Balbriggan meeting===
On 28 January 2020, Waters and O&#x27;Doherty addressed an Anti-Corruption Ireland meeting in Balbriggan. During the meeting he said &quot;many of the ethnicities that are coming here” had “fertility rates that are two or three times the Irish rate&quot; and claimed the great replacement conspiracy theory of Renaud Camus would happen in Ireland. He criticised the Fianna Fáil slogan &quot;An Ireland for all&quot;, saying in an outraged tone &quot;Who were Fianna Fáil referring to? ISIS? There are two words missing. Except Paddy&quot;. During his speech he openly speculated about being murdered in a nursing home by an immigrant care worker.

===2020 general election===
Waters ran under the banner of Gemma O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s far-right group, &quot;Anti-Corruption Ireland&quot;, in the 2020 Irish general election, in the Dún Laoghaire constituency. In his pre-election writings he referred to the great replacement conspiracy theory and referred to The Strange Death of Europe. As Anti-Corruption Ireland is not a registered political party, he appeared on the ballot paper as an independent. Waters received 1.48% of first preference votes and was eliminated on the first count.

===High Court action against COVID-19 legislation===
On 15 April 2020, Waters and Gemma O&#x27;Doherty launched a legal action against laws dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. They sought to have various parts of the legislation declared null and void by a judge of the High Court.

The legislation included:
*Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020
*Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020
*The 1947 Health Act (Affected Areas) Order
as well as temporary restrictions brought in due to COVID-19 under the 1947 Health Act.

Waters said to the court that the legislation was &quot;unconstitutional&quot;, &quot;improperly acted&quot; and &quot;very flawed&quot;. He said that the challenge was brought on the grounds that the laws were brought in by a caretaker government, by a Dáil where the number of TDs were limited and was enacted by an outgoing Seanad. The action was to be taken against the Minister for Health (Ireland), Ireland and the Attorney General. In a hearing on the matter, Mr Justice Paul Sankey said that the court was only concerned with the legality of the legislation and not about government policy, directed that the application for permission to bring the challenge be made on notice to the State respondents, and adjourned the matter for a week.

In a second hearing, the Counsel for the State, told the court that the State would oppose the application for leave to bring the challenge, and stated that the Seanad and Ceann Comhairle would need to be added as notice parties. During this hearing, O&#x27;Doherty stated that the vast majority of people were unaffected by COVID-19 which she said was &quot;no threat to life&quot; and that Irish people should be allowed to go outside and &quot;build up a herd immunity&quot;. During the discussion, the applicants questioned if the proceedings were being held in public. Up to 100 supporters of the applicants gathered in the Round Hall of the Four Courts but were not permitted to enter the courtroom because of social distancing rules introduced because of COVID-19. An application to let some or all of the supporters into the courtroom was dismissed by the judge, who said that the court was being held in public and was being reported on by the media. The following day, Gardaí announced that there was an investigation into the large gathering at the Four Courts, stating that they had asked the group to disperse because of concerns with adherence to guidelines on social distancing and non-essential travel. Gardaí said the group dispersed and no arrests were made but investigations were ongoing.

At the next hearing, on 28 April 2020, there was a strong Garda presence at the Four Courts, and barriers were used to prevent crowds from entering the court. Members of the Public Order Unit and the Bridewell Garda station were stationed at all main entrances to the building. About forty supporters of the applicants turned up. No arrests were made. At this hearing, Mr Justice Charles Meehan fixed the applicant&#x27;s appeal for hearing on 5 May 2020. During the meeting, O&#x27;Doherty said that the people of Ireland were under &quot;mass house arrest&quot; and Gardaí were &quot;using guns&quot; to frighten people.

On 5 May 2020, there was again a strong Garda presence outside the Four Courts. In her submission to the court O&#x27;Doherty said that the COVID-19 conditions were comparable to living in &quot;Nazi Germany&quot; and that the basis for introducing the restrictions was &quot;scientifically fraudulent&quot; and that evidence to that effect would be presented at the full hearing of their action. The State&#x27;s representatives opposed the application for leave, saying that the claims were not arguable.

On 13 May 2020, Mr Justice Charles Meehan dismissed the applicant&#x27;s case. He said that the applicant&#x27;s claims were not arguable and the court could not grant them an application to have their challenge determined at a full hearing of the High Court. He said that the applicants had not provided any facts or expert evidence to support the view that the laws challenged by the applicants were unconstitutional, and noted that the applicants had &quot;no medical or scientific qualifications or expertise, [and] relied on their own unsubstantiated views, gave speeches, engaged in empty rhetoric and sought to draw parallel to Nazi Germany which is both absurd and offensive&quot;.

On 2 March 2021, the Irish Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by Waters and O&#x27;Doherty of the High Court&#x27;s refusal to permit them to bring their challenge, and its award of costs of that hearing against them. Counsel for the state in the appeal argued that some of the applicants&#x27; submissions were &quot;Bermuda Triangle stuff&quot;.

On 5 July 2022 the Supreme Court upheld the decision to dismiss the challenge brought by him and Gemma O&#x27;Doherty against the constitutionality of laws introduced in response to COVID-19.

===2024 European Parliament election===
He ran as an independent candidate in the 2024 European Parliament election in the constituency of Midlands–North-West. Waters received 13,692 (2.0%) first preference votes but was not elected.

==Non-fiction and drama==
Waters has written a number of works of non-fiction as well as plays for radio and the stage. The title of his first non-fiction book, &quot;Jiving at the Crossroads&quot;, is a pun of Irish president Éamon de Valera&#x27;s vision of a rural Ireland which is often misattributed as &quot;comely maidens dancing at the crossroads&quot;. In the book, Waters comments on modern Ireland. Another non-fiction work, &quot;Lapsed Agnostic&quot;, describes his &quot;journey from belief to un-belief and back again.&quot;

==Appearances==
===Eurovision Song Contest===
Waters has entered the Eurovision Song Contest. &quot;They Can&#x27;t Stop the Spring&quot;, the song he co-wrote with Tommy Moran and performed by the band Dervish, was selected following a telephone vote of viewers on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; to be Ireland&#x27;s entry in Eurovision Song Contest 2007 in Helsinki. The song finished last in the European competition final, receiving only 5 points.

In 2010, RTÉ announced that Waters had sought to represent Ireland again at Eurovision, with the song &quot;Does Heaven Need Much More?&quot;, co-written with Tommy Moran. In the Irish National Final on 5 March 2010, the song was performed by Leanne Moore, the winner of &quot;You&#x27;re a Star&quot; 2008, and finished in fourth place.

===Electric Picnic 2010===
Waters attended the Electric Picnic music festival in 2010 and wrote that he felt a sense of dissatisfaction with the event, concluding that there was a lack of meaning underpinning events at the festival. &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; journalist Una Mullally replied that if Waters felt disconnected or out of place at the Electric Picnic, that it was because the country had changed, and continued &quot;perhaps this is the first Irish generation who have purposely opted out of tormenting themselves by searching for some unattainable greater meaning and who have chosen instead just to live&quot;.

===Television===
In 2007, Waters took part as one of the guest amateur chefs, in the RTE &quot;The Restaurant&quot;, programme.
In 2008, he took part in a television programme which researched his family&#x27;s past. Parish records revealed that his great-granduncle, also called John Waters, died of starvation during the Great Famine.

In 2011 he sat for the painter Nick Miller, the subject of a naked portrait for an Arts Lives RTÉ programme, called &quot;Naked&quot;.

Over the years Waters has participated on a number of current affairs programmes on Irish television, including &quot;Questions and Answers&quot; (RTÉ), &quot;Vincent Browne Tonight&quot; (TV3), and &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; (RTÉ).

==Views==
===Criticism of Blogsphere===
During a newspaper review on radio station, Newstalk 106, Waters declared blogs and bloggers to be &quot;stupid&quot;. He then repeated those claims the following week, sparking controversy amongst Irish bloggers who took exception to his views. In the same interview, Waters claimed that &quot;sixty to seventy percent of the internet is pornography&quot;.

===Northern Ireland===
Of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and the acceptance of the Good Friday Agreement by Sinn Féin, Waters has written, &quot;After thirty years of conflict and more than 3,000 deaths, the Provos had achieved nothing more than had been on the table at the beginning. Now they were prepared to exchange all the alleged principles on which they had fought their &#x27;war&#x27; for a few seats in an assembly that could have been agreed nearly three decades previously if they had been prepared to be reasonable. They had fought for &#x27;freedom&#x27; and settled for power.&quot;

===Pantigate===

On 11 January 2014, Waters was mentioned by Irish drag queen Panti (Rory O&#x27;Neill) on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot; with Brendan O&#x27;Connor while discussing homophobia. O&#x27;Neill said that Waters, among other Irish journalists, was homophobic.

Waters and the others mentioned threatened RTÉ and O&#x27;Neill with legal action. RTÉ subsequently removed that section of the interview from their online archive. On 25 January episode of &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot;, O&#x27;Connor issued a public apology to those named on behalf of RTÉ for being mentioned in the interview held two weeks previously. RTÉ compensated Waters and others mentioned.

RTÉ received hundreds of complaints about the issue. A rally against the payout and censorship drew 2,000 people, and the appropriateness of the payout was later discussed by members of the Oireachtas. The issue was also discussed in the European Parliament. RTÉ&#x27;s head of television defended the €85,000 payout and blamed the decision mostly on Ireland&#x27;s Anti-Defamation Laws.

===Dispute with Irish Times colleagues===
In February 2014, Waters&#x27; implicated fellow &quot;Irish Times&quot; journalist Patsy McGarry as the author of a handful of &quot;ad hominem&quot; Tweets, written anonymously. In the piece, Waters&#x27; alleged an institutional bias within &quot;The Irish Times&quot; against Catholic social teaching. Despite this, in March 2014, it was announced that John Waters had decided to stop contributing to &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. Reports stated that he had been unhappy at &quot;The Irish Times&quot; since the controversy.

===Comments on depression===
In April 2014, Waters replied when asked if he had become depressed because of the reaction to his actions over RTÉ and Rory O&#x27;Neill: &quot;There&#x27;s no such thing. It&#x27;s an invention. It&#x27;s bullshit. It&#x27;s a cop out.&quot;

He was criticised by many, including Paul Kelly, founder of the suicide prevention charity Console, guidance councillor Eamon Keane, journalist Suzanne Harrington (whose late husband suffered from depression), gay rights activist Panti, charity campaigner Majella O&#x27;Donnell as well as online commenters.

His former partner Sinéad O&#x27;Connor expressed concern for Waters, saying that she thought he was suffering from depression and needed to admit it.

===Faith and Society===
Waters devoted much of his column space in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; to discussing the role and importance of religion and faith in society. In an interview, he has described people of faith as &quot;funnier, sharper and smarter&quot; than atheists. In a 2009 article titled &quot;Another no to Lisbon might shock FF back to its senses&quot; Waters voiced his opposition to gay marriage stating that it was &quot;potentially destructive of the very fabric of Irish society&quot;.

====Thirty-fourth amendment to the Constitution of Ireland====
In 2015 a referendum was held on the matter of same-sex marriage. Before the referendum the Constitution was assumed to contain an implicit prohibition on same-sex marriage.

Waters was involved with a group opposing the referendum called First Families First, along with Kathy Sinnott and Gerry Fahey.

After the referendum passed, Waters described the result as &#x27;catastrophic&#x27; for Irish society. He also said &quot;Not just the gay, LGBT lobby, but virtually the entire journalistic fraternity turned on me and tried to basically peck me to death&quot;.

In February 2017, Waters spoke at a panel where he blamed LGBT activists for his decision to quit journalism.
He said &quot;I stopped being a journalist because of the LGBT campaign. They tried to present themselves as beautiful gentle people, but these people aren&#x27;t&quot;. Waters compared the activists that attacked him to the Black and Tans, saying &quot;I would prefer them to the people I met last year in the campaign. I would prefer them, bring them back. Bring back the Black and Tans&quot;. &quot;The ugliest phenomenon I have ever seen in 30 years a journalist,&quot; Waters added.

He also claimed that the clerical child abuse cases were &quot;closely aligned to homosexuality&quot;. He claimed &quot;Now paedophile priests, there&#x27;s no such thing… that&#x27;s the single most interesting lie about all this. 90% of the abusers in Catholic church, they were not paedophiles, they were ephebophiles. An entirely different phenomenon. They were abusers of teenage boys which is closely aligned to homosexuality&quot;.

===Urban/rural divide===
In &quot;Jiving at the Crossroads&quot; he wrote about what he perceived the divide between secular urban Ireland and rural areas. He felt that the former looked down on the latter. In his &quot;Hot Press&quot; radio column he had relied on stock images of rural life, but the book was an attempt to make amends.

He was influenced by John Healy, admiring his works &quot;Nineteen Acres&quot; and &quot;The Death of an Irish Town&quot;.

===Change in audience===
From 2014 onwards, he mostly did not write to influence mainstream public opinion. The thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland recognised same sex marriage in Ireland (previously held to be prohibited by the constitution) and the thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland which changed the constitutional position on abortion. He no longer wrote for a mostly Irish audience, but for one centred on the United States, becoming involved in culture wars between conservatives and progressives. He now appeared on conservative podcasts with large audiences.

===Immigrants===
In 2020, he publicly supported the Great Replacement conspiracy theory.

====Direct provision====

Direct provision is a system of asylum seeker accommodation that has been criticised as illegal, inhuman and degrading.

Far right groups, as part of their xenophobic policy, had been encouraging people to oppose DP centres for some years, with little success. However, in November 2018, a proposed DP centre was firebombed in Moville. The following February, protests against a proposed DP centre in Rooskey saw another arson attack on a proposed DP centre. In September 2019, Oughterard saw the largest ever protests against a proposed DP centre, which was blockaded night and day for three weeks. Another 24/7 protest began on Achill Island the following month, which continued until 2020, the longest ever protest against a DP centre. Plans to accommodate asylum seekers in these four places were dropped. While there have been small protests against DP centres since Achill, none have been successful.

In a podcast in 2019 he claimed that direct provision was not inhumane and that asylum seekers lived in luxury compared to how he grew up.

===Other views===
Waters has referred to himself as a &quot;neo-Luddite&quot; or later as a &quot;luddite&quot;. At one stage he refused to use e-mail and stated his concern that society ignores the negative aspects of the Internet.

In his articles titled &quot;Impose democracy on Iraq&quot; and &quot;Bush and Blair doing right thing&quot;, Waters explained his support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a position based on his belief that Iraq posed an imminent threat to the West due to its possession of weapons of mass destruction.

He wrote an article titled &quot;Two sides to domestic violence&quot;, which criticised the lack of gender balance in Amnesty International&#x27;s campaign against domestic violence in Ireland. Waters cited the National Crime Council report, conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute, which found approximate gender symmetry in most measures of domestic violence and he pointed out that despite these statistics, funding for women victims of domestic violence (€15 million) disproportionately outstrips funding for male victims. Waters&#x27; article led to a response from the head of Amnesty International&#x27;s Irish branch.

===Jailing over parking fine===
In September 2013 he was jailed for around two hours in Wheatfield Prison over non-payment of a parking fine. The case dated back to 2011 and Waters claimed that he returned to his car one minute over a 15-minute grace period. He refused to pay the fine as a matter of principle.

===Defamation action against Waters===
In November 2018 &quot;The Irish Times&quot; journalist Kitty Holland took a defamation action against Waters for accusing her of lying about the cause of death of Savita Halappanavar. In July 2024 Holland was awarded €35,000 damages for defamation of character against Waters.

<text>John Samuel Waters Jr. (born April 22, 1946) is an American filmmaker, actor, writer, and artist. He rose to fame in the early 1970s for his transgressive cult films, including &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot; (1970), &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; (1972) and &quot;Female Trouble&quot; (1974). Waters wrote and directed the comedy film &quot;Hairspray&quot; (1988), which was later adapted into a hit Broadway musical and a 2007 musical film. His other films include &quot;Desperate Living&quot; (1977), &quot;Polyester&quot; (1981), &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; (1990), &quot;Serial Mom&quot; (1994), &quot;Pecker&quot; (1998), and &quot;Cecil B. Demented&quot; (2000). His films contain elements of post-modern comedy and surrealism. He often collaborated with late actor and drag queen Divine (1966–1988) and his regular cast of the Dreamlanders.

As an actor, Waters has appeared in the films &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot; (1999), &quot;Mangus!&quot; (2011), &quot;Excision&quot; (2012), and &quot;Suburban Gothic&quot; (2014), as well as the &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; franchise with the film &quot;Seed of Chucky&quot; (2004) and the third season of the television series &quot;Chucky&quot; (2024). He hosted and produced the television series &quot;John Waters Presents Movies That Will Corrupt You&quot; (2006).

Waters also works as a visual artist and across different media, such as installations, photography, and sculpture. The audiobooks he narrated for his books &quot;Carsick&quot; and &quot;Mr. Know-It-All&quot; were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2015 and 2020, respectively. In 2018, Waters was named an officer of the Order of Arts and Letters in France. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2023.

==Early life and education==
Waters was born on April 22, 1946, in Baltimore, Maryland, one of four children born to Patricia Ann (née Whitaker) and John Samuel Waters, a manufacturer of fire-protection equipment. He was raised Catholic by his mother, though his father was not Catholic. Through his mother, who immigrated to the United States from Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, as a child, he is the third-great-grandson of George P. Whitaker of the Whitaker iron family. Waters grew up in Lutherville, Maryland, a suburb of Baltimore. His boyhood friend and muse, Glenn Milstead, later known as Divine, also lived in Lutherville. Waters lived at 313 Morris Avenue in Lutherville from his early teenage years until he moved out in his early twenties. Waters and Milstead shot many of their early films at the house, dubbing the front lawn the &quot;Dreamland Lot&quot;.

The film &quot;Lili&quot; inspired an interest in puppets in the seven-year-old Waters, who proceeded to stage violent versions of &quot;Punch and Judy&quot; for children&#x27;s birthday parties. Biographer Robrt L. Pela says that Waters&#x27;s mother believes the puppets in &quot;Lili&quot; had the greatest influence on Waters&#x27;s subsequent career (though Pela believes tacky films at a local drive-in, which the young Waters watched from a distance through binoculars, had a greater effect).

&quot;Cry-Baby&quot; was also a product of Waters&#x27;s boyhood, because of his fascination as a seven-year-old with the &quot;drapes&quot; then receiving intense news coverage because of the murder of Carolyn Wasilewski, a young &quot;drapette&quot;, and his admiration for a young man living across the street who had a hot rod. Waters was privately educated at the Calvert School in Baltimore. After attending Towson Jr. High School in nearby Towson, and Calvert Hall College High School, he graduated from Boys&#x27; Latin School of Maryland. While still a teen, he made frequent trips into downtown Baltimore to visit Martick&#x27;s, a beatnik bar, where he and Milstead met many of their later film collaborators. He was underage and could not enter the bar proper, but loitered in the adjacent alley, where he relied on older patrons to slip him drinks.

==Career==
===Early career===
Waters&#x27;s first short film was &quot;Hag in a Black Leather Jacket&quot;. MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939) had a profound effect on Waters&#x27; creative mind. He said about it:

I was always drawn to forbidden subject matter in the very, very beginning. &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; opened me up because it was one of the first movies I ever saw. It opened me up to villainy, to screenwriting, to costumes. And great dialogue. I think the witch has great, great dialogue.

Waters has stated that he takes an equal amount of joy and influence from high-brow &quot;art&quot; films and sleazy exploitation films. In January 1966, Waters and some friends were caught smoking marijuana on the grounds of New York University, and he was soon kicked out of his dormitory. He returned to Baltimore, where he completed his next two short films, &quot;Roman Candles&quot; and &quot;Eat Your Makeup&quot;. They were followed by the feature-length films &quot;Mondo Trasho&quot; and &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot;.

Waters&#x27;s films became Divine&#x27;s primary star vehicles. All of Waters&#x27;s early films were shot in the Baltimore area with his company of local actors, the Dreamlanders—which, in addition to Divine, included Mink Stole, Cookie Mueller, Edith Massey, David Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce, Susan Walsh, and others. Waters met Edith Massey while she was a bartender at Pete&#x27;s Hotel. Waters&#x27;s early campy movies present exaggerated characters in outrageous situations with hyperbolic dialogue. &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;, &quot;Female Trouble&quot; and &quot;Desperate Living&quot;, which he labeled the &quot;Trash Trilogy&quot;, pushed hard at the boundaries of conventional propriety and censorship.

===Move toward the mainstream===
Waters&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Polyester&quot; starred Divine opposite former teen idol Tab Hunter. It was the first time that Waters was not the primary camera operator for his own work, as he had started collaborating with local film student David Insley. Since then, his films have become less controversial and more mainstream, although works such as &quot;Hairspray&quot;, &quot;Cry-Baby&quot;, &quot;Serial Mom&quot;, &quot;Pecker&quot; and &quot;Cecil B. Demented&quot; still retain his trademark inventiveness. &quot;Hairspray&quot; became a hit Broadway musical that swept the 2003 Tony Awards; and a film adaptation of the Broadway musical was released in theaters on July 20, 2007, to positive reviews and commercial success. &quot;Cry-Baby&quot;, itself a musical, also became a Broadway musical.

In 2004, the NC-17-rated &quot;A Dirty Shame&quot; marked a return to Waters&#x27; earlier, more controversial work of the 1970s. Having received mixed reviews and bombing at the box-office, it is his last film so far. In 2007, Waters became the host (&quot;The Groom Reaper&quot;) of &quot;&#x27;Til Death Do Us Part&quot;, a program on America&#x27;s Court TV network. In 2008, he planned to make a children&#x27;s Christmas film, &quot;Fruitcake&quot; starring Johnny Knoxville and Parker Posey. Filming was set for November 2008, but the project was shelved in January 2009.

Waters has been open about financing problems for his movies. In 2010, Waters told the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that &quot;Independent films that cost $5 million are very hard to get made. I sold the idea, got a development deal, got paid a great salary to write it—and now the company is no longer around, which is the case with many independent film companies these days.&quot; In 2017, he stated that &quot;they all want you to make a movie for under a million dollars, which I don’t want to. I don’t want to be a faux radical film-maker at 70. I did that. I don’t need to do it again.&quot;

In October 2022, it was announced that Waters will adapt his novel, &quot;Liarmouth&quot;, into a film. Village Roadshow Pictures was set to produce, with Waters writing and directing. However, in November 2024, it was reported that the film was &quot;no longer happening&quot;.

Waters has often created characters with alliterated names for his films, such as Corny Collins, Cuddles Kovinsky, Donald and Donna Dasher, Dawn Davenport, Fat Fuck Frank, Francine Fishpaw, Link Larkin, Motormouth Maybelle, Mole McHenry, Penny and Prudy Pingleton, Ramona Ricketts, Sandy Sandstone, Sylvia Stickles, Todd Tomorrow, Tracy Turnblad, Ursula Udders, Wade Walker and Wanda Woodward.

On September 18, 2023, Waters was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Dreamlanders Ricki Lake and Mink Stole were among the guest speakers.

== Other ventures ==

Waters is a bibliophile, with a collection of over 8,000 books. In 2011, during a visit to the Waters house in Baltimore, Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson observed:

Bookshelves line the walls but they are not enough. The coffee table, desk and side tables are heaped with books, as is the replica electric chair in the hall. They range from Taschen art tomes such as &quot;The Big Butt Book&quot; to Jean Genet paperbacks and a Hungarian translation of Tennessee Williams with a pulp fiction cover. In one corner sits a doll from the horror spoof &quot;Seed of Chucky&quot;, in which Waters appeared. It feels like an eccentric professor&#x27;s study, or a carefully curated exhibition based on the life of a fictional character. 

Waters has had his fan mail delivered to Atomic Books, an independent bookstore in Baltimore, for over 20 years. Puffing constantly on a cigarette, Waters appeared in a short film, shown in film art houses, announcing that &quot;no smoking is permitted&quot; in the theaters. The spot was directed by Douglas Brian Martin and produced by Douglas Brian Martin and Steven M. Martin. They also created two other short films, for the Nuart Theatre (a Landmark Theater) in West Los Angeles, California, in appreciation for their showing &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; for many years. It is shown immediately before any of Waters&#x27; films, and before the midnight showing of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;. Waters played a minister in &quot;Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat&quot;, directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis.

In the 1980s, Waters taught inmates at the Patuxent Institution, a Maryland prison. He was hired to teach literature, but his classes also encompassed discussions of film. In 1985, he made a film with his students called &quot;Reckless Eyeballs&quot;, but it was not intended for release and was never publicly screened.

Waters is a board member of the Maryland Film Festival, and has selected and hosted a favorite film there each year since its launch in 1999. He is also on the advisory board of the Provincetown International Film Festival, and has hosted events and presented awards there every year since it was founded in 1999. He is a contributor to &quot;Artforum&quot; magazine and author of its year-end Top Ten Films list. Waters hosts an annual performance, &quot;A John Waters Christmas&quot;, which was launched in 1996 at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, and in 2018 toured 17 cities over 23 days.

In 2017, Waters began hosting an annual &quot;Camp John Waters&quot; event in Kent, Connecticut. Adult fans from as far away as Australia and Chile &quot;relive their sleepaway camping days&quot; with an &quot;extra-campy theme weekend&quot;. Notable guests have included Debbie Harry, Patricia Hearst, Kathleen Turner, Mink Stole and Randy Harrison. In 2019, the Film Society of Lincoln Center celebrated its 50th anniversary at a gala where John Waters spoke in tribute to the Center along with Martin Scorsese, Dee Rees, Pedro Almodóvar, Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Moore, Paul Dano and Zoe Kazan.

===Fine art===
Since the early 1990s, Waters has been making photo-based artwork and installations that have been internationally exhibited in galleries and museums. In 2004, the New Museum in New York City presented a retrospective of his artwork curated by Marvin Heiferman and Lisa Phillips. His most recent exhibition &quot;John Waters: Indecent Exposure&quot; was exhibited at the Baltimore Museum of Art from October 2018 to January 2019 and later traveled to the Wexner Center for the Arts. Prior to that, Waters exhibited &quot;Rear Projection&quot; in April 2009, at the Marianne Boesky Gallery in New York and the Gagosian Gallery in Los Angeles. Waters has been represented by C. Grimaldis Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland, since 2002 and by Marianne Boesky Gallery in New York since 2006.
Waters&#x27;s pieces are often comical, such as &quot;Rush&quot; (2009), a super-sized, tipped-over bottle of poppers (nitrite inhalants), and &quot;Hardy Har&quot; (2006), a photograph of flowers that squirts water at anyone who traverses a taped line on the floor. Waters has characterized his art as conceptual: &quot;The craft is not the issue here. The idea is. And the presentation.&quot;

In November 2020, Waters promised to donate 372 artworks from his personal collection, including some of his own work as well as pieces by 125 artists, including Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Cy Twombly, Cindy Sherman and more, to the Baltimore Museum of Art. In recognition of the donation, the museum named its rotunda after Waters, but Waters also insisted the museum name an all-gender bathroom after him. Both the rotunda and the bathroom were renamed for Waters in time for the opening of the first exhibition of his bequeathed collection, &quot;Coming Attractions: The John Waters Collection&quot; on November 20, 2022. Waters, who serves on the museum&#x27;s board of directors, has stated the museum will acquire all of his art after his death.

===&quot;Carsick&quot;===
With the motif &quot;My life is so over-scheduled, what will happen if I give up control?&quot;, Waters completed a hitchhiking journey across the United States from Baltimore to San Francisco, turning his adventures into a book titled &quot;Carsick&quot;. On May 15, 2012, while on the hitchhiking trip, Waters was picked up by 20-year-old Myersville, Maryland, councilman Brett Bidle, who thought Waters was a homeless hitchhiker standing in the pouring rain. Feeling bad for Waters, he agreed to drive him four hours to Ohio.

The next day, indie rock band Here We Go Magic tweeted that they had picked John Waters up hitchhiking in Ohio. He was wearing a hat with the text &quot;Scum of the Earth&quot;. In Denver, Colorado, Waters reconnected with Bidle (who had made an effort to catch up with him); Bidle then drove him another to Reno, Nevada. Before parting ways, Waters arranged for Bidle to stay at his San Francisco apartment: &quot;I thought, you know what, he wanted an adventure, too ... He&#x27;s the first Republican I&#x27;d ever vote for.&quot;

Bidle later said: &quot;We are polar opposites when it comes to our politics, religious beliefs. But that&#x27;s what I loved about the whole trip. It was two people able to agree to disagree and still move on and have a great time. I think that&#x27;s what America&#x27;s all about.&quot;

==Personal life==

Although he has maintained apartments in New York City and San Francisco&#x27;s Nob Hill, as well as a summer home in Provincetown, Waters mainly resides in Baltimore. All his films are set and shot there. He is recognizable by his trademark pencil moustache.

As a gay man, Waters is an avid supporter of gay rights and gay pride. In a 2019 interview, he said that he dislikes publicly discussing his personal life, adding that he had a partner but that they both preferred to keep the relationship private.

Waters was a great fan of the music of Little Richard when growing up. He has said that, ever since he shoplifted a copy of the Little Richard song &quot;Lucille&quot; in 1957, at the age of 11, &quot;I&#x27;ve wished I could somehow climb into Little Richard&#x27;s body, hook up his heart and vocal cords to my own, and switch identities.&quot; In 1987, &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine employed Waters, then aged 41, to interview his idol, but the interview did not go well, with Waters later remarking: &quot;It turned into kind of a disaster.&quot;

Waters advocated for the parole of former Manson family member Leslie Van Houten, writing in his 2010 book &quot;Role Models&quot;, &quot;Her crime was a long, long time ago and she has paid her dues to society&quot;. After Van Houten was paroled in 2023, Waters said he would not speak further about her, in deference to her privacy.

Throughout his life, Waters has been open about his recreational drug use, including marijuana and LSD, particularly with regard to his creative process. Waters began using LSD as a teenager, &quot;tak[ing] LSD and see[ing]...movies all the time&quot;. Waters was often on LSD while making his early films, claiming in a 2016 interview &quot;I was on LSD [during &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot;], I don&#x27;t remember [how long it took to shoot the film]!&quot; He tried LSD again in his 70s, and documented the experience in his 2019 book &quot;Mr. Know-It-All&quot;.

Waters was a smoker before quitting around 2004, saying &quot;the only thing I&#x27;ve ever regretted in my whole life [was] smoking cigarettes. Because it was a nightmare giving up. It&#x27;s the only thing the government ever told me that was true: It does kill you!&quot; In 2022, Waters said that if he were to write his younger self a letter, he would say &quot;quit smoking [cigarettes] and do everything else&quot;.

==Career==

===Music===

<doc id="634067" wikidata="Q7424051" url="?curid=634067" title="Sariah">
<text>According to the Book of Mormon, Sariah () was the wife of Lehi, and the mother of Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. She traveled with her husband from Jerusalem, into the wilderness, and eventually, across the ocean to the &quot;promised land&quot; (the Americas). She is noted for the story in First Nephi where she complains to Lehi for sending her sons back to Jerusalem thinking that they may have died. Once they return, Sariah testifies that her husband is truly a prophet. In Lehi&#x27;s vision of the tree of life, Sariah chooses to eat the fruit representing God&#x27;s love. She has two more sons, Jacob and Joseph, while traveling in the wilderness and almost dies of grief while crossing the ocean when Laman and Lemuel try to kill Nephi.

Scholars point out that Sariah helps prove Nephi&#x27;s thesis that the faithful will become strong and will receive the mercy of the Lord as she receives a personal testimony after waiting for her sons to return from Jerusalem. Others suggest that Sariah would have managed the family travels, including tent set up and take down, food gathering, material weaving, and more. Additionally, it is proposed that the name Sariah in Hebrew means &quot;Jehovah is Prince&quot; or &quot;Princess of Jehovah&quot;.

== Narration ==

Sariah is part of the first family mentioned in the Book of Mormon and is also the only woman named in Nephi&#x27;s records. Around 600 B.C., her husband, Lehi, is told by the Spirit to prophesy the destruction of Jerusalem if the citizens refuse to repent. Lehi&#x27;s prophecies are rejected, and he is told to take his family out of Jerusalem and travel into the desert. Sariah, Lehi, and their four sons pack up what they need and leave their riches behind, ending up in a place they name the valley of Lemuel. After a period of time in the valley, Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi are sent back home to retrieve the brass plates.

As Sariah waits for her sons to return, she begins to worry that they have died in the wilderness and complains to Lehi for sending them back to the dangers of Jerusalem. Her husband comforts her, but she continues to worry until her sons return, when she testifies that Lehi truly is a prophet. This belief is shown again later when Lehi dreams of the tree of life and calls his family to come and eat the fruit, which represents God&#x27;s love. Sariah, Sam, and Nephi come and eat while Laman and Lemuel choose other paths.

While traveling in the wilderness, Sariah has another two sons named Jacob and Joseph. Later, while crossing the ocean, Laman and Lemuel try to kill Nephi, causing Sariah and Lehi so much grief that they become sick and almost die. Sariah&#x27;s actual death is not specifically mentioned in the Book of Mormon.

== Interpretation ==

=== Nephi&#x27;s thesis ===
Nephi claims at the beginning of his writings that those who are faithful will become &quot;mighty&quot; and the mercies of the Lord will be extended to them. According to Noel B. Reynolds, director of the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon studies, this statement of Nephi&#x27;s in 1 Nephi 1:20 is a thesis that he supports about thirty times with different events in his writings. These events include quoting prophecies from the brass plates that talk about the faithful delivered through the power of the Atonement and the angel saving Nephi and Sam from being beaten by their brothers. As Reynolds states it, Sariah&#x27;s faith is contrasted against Laman and Lemuel&#x27;s as she no longer needed to be persuaded to be faithful after her sons came back from Jerusalem, but Laman and Lemuel need to be reminded multiple times of their faith.

=== Role in desert travel ===
Anthropologist and Book of Mormon researcher Brant A. Gardner says as the wife of a wealthy man in Jerusalem, Sariah would have been used to running a household and would have had the responsibility of managing the family while they traveled as well. In Heather B. Moore&#x27;s book &quot;Women of the Book of Mormon&quot;, she explains that in Sariah&#x27;s time, nomadic women in that area of the world were responsible to forage for food and make and serve each meal. According to Moore and retired BYU professor Camille Fronk, the women also helped with childbirth during the journey, and were responsible to collect water, gather firewood, weave materials like tent cords, and set up or take down the tents.

=== Murmuring in the desert ===
While Lehi had a vision and was commanded by the Lord to leave Jerusalem, Sariah had to leave behind her home and connections with no &quot;personal witness&quot; that it truly needed to happen, says Fronk. She worries in 1 Nephi 5:2-9 that &quot;her sons are no more.&quot; Joseph Spencer notices the variety of pronouns she uses in conversation with Lehi, switching between &quot;my,&quot; &quot;thou,&quot; and &quot;our,&quot; showing subtle doubt about her unity of purpose with Lehi. Lehi&#x27;s responses, using mostly &quot;I,&quot; and &quot;my,&quot; fail to unify them, and she is only truly comforted by the return of her children. In &quot;The Book of Mormon for the Least of These&quot;, Fatimah S. Salleh and Margaret Olsen Hemming talk of Sariah&#x27;s experience in the same passage. They claim that while most people read the verses as a negative perspective on Sariah, looking closer reveals her faith as she leaves her valuables, birthright, and people behind for the wilderness. Lehi sincerely acknowledges her sadness and comforts her in her grief In &quot;Second Witness: Analytical and Contextual Commentary,&quot; Brant A. Gardner suggests that in the scriptural account, Sariah showed no hesitation following Lehi into the wilderness and the only time she holds back is when she believes her sons might be lost. Gardner proposes that she only questions Lehi&#x27;s calling as a prophet when his direction seems to have led her sons into unknown danger.

== Proposed Etymology ==
In the Bible, the Hebrew &quot;śryh&quot; is written &quot;Seraiah&quot;, which would represent Hebrew pronunciation of &quot;sera-yah&quot; or &quot;sra-ya&quot;, meaning “Jehovah has struggled”. Jeffrey R. Chadwick of the Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center suggests based on recent evidence that the name is more like &quot;sar-yah&quot;, which means closer to “Jehovah is prince.”

Alternatively, Camille Fronk says that the name Sariah could mean &quot;Princess of Jehovah.&quot;

== Cultural Reception ==
Several poems have been written about Sariah, including &quot;Sariah&quot; by Marni Aspond Campbell, a portion of the poetry book &quot;Branches that Run over the Wall&quot; by Louisa Greene Richards, and a section of &quot;Book of Mormon Abridged in Rhyme&quot; by Orrin R. Wilcox. Another poem regarding Sariah is &quot;Sorrow and Song&quot; in the book &quot;Psalm &amp; Selah: a poetic journey through The Book of Mormon&quot;.

==Family tree==
Sariah&#x27;s immediate family is shown in the diagram below.

<text>Dawson City, officially the City of Dawson, is a town in the Canadian territory of Yukon. Its history is strongly linked to the Klondike Gold Rush (1896–1899). Its population was 1,577 as of the 2021 census, making it the second-largest municipality in Yukon.

== History ==

Prior to the late modern period the area was used for hunting and gathering by the Hän-speaking people of the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in and their forebears. The heart of their homeland was Tr&#x27;ochëk, a fishing camp at the confluence of the Klondike River and Yukon River, now a National Historic Site of Canada, just across the Klondike River from modern Dawson City. This site was also an important summer gathering spot and a base for moose-hunting on the Klondike Valley.

The current settlement was founded by Joseph Ladue and named in January 1897 after noted Canadian geologist George M. Dawson, who had explored and mapped the region in 1887. It served as Yukon&#x27;s capital from the territory&#x27;s founding in 1898 until 1952, when the seat was moved to Whitehorse.

Dawson City was the centre of the Klondike Gold Rush. It began in 1896 and changed the First Nations camp into a thriving city of 16,000–17,000 by 1898. By 1899, the gold rush had ended and the town&#x27;s population plummeted as all but 8,000 people left. When Dawson was incorporated as a city in 1902, the population was under 5,000. St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church, also built that same year, is a National Historic Site. The downtown was devastated by fire in November 1897 (started when dance hall girl Dolly Mitchell threw a lamp at another girl in an argument), 1899 (started in the Bodega Saloon), 1900 (started at the Monte Carlo Theatre) and flooding in 1925, 1944, 1966, 1969 and 1979.

The population dropped after World War II when the Alaska Highway bypassed it to the south. The economic damage to Dawson City was such that Whitehorse, the highway&#x27;s hub, replaced it as territorial capital in 1953. Dawson City&#x27;s population languished around the 600–900 mark through the 1960s and 1970s, but has risen and held stable since then. The high price of gold has made modern placer mining operations profitable, and the growth of the tourism industry has encouraged the development of facilities. In the early 1950s, Dawson was linked by road to Alaska, and in fall 1955, with Whitehorse along a road that now forms part of the Klondike Highway.

In 1978, another kind of buried treasure was discovered with the Dawson Film Find when a construction excavation inadvertently uncovered a forgotten collection of more than 500 discarded films on highly flammable nitrate film stock from the early 20th century that were buried in (and preserved by) the permafrost. These silent-era film reels, dating from &quot;between 1903 and 1929, were uncovered in the rubble beneath [an] old hockey rink&quot;. Owing to its dangerous chemical volatility, the historical find was moved by military transport to Library and Archives Canada and the U.S. Library of Congress for both transfer to safety film and storage. A documentary about the find, &quot;Dawson City: Frozen Time&quot;, was released in 2016.

The City of Dawson and the nearby ghost town of Forty Mile are featured prominently in the novels and short stories of American author Jack London, including &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;. London lived in the Dawson area from October 1897 to June 1898. Other writers who lived in and wrote of Dawson City include Pierre Berton and the poet Robert Service. The childhood home of the former is now used as a residency and retreat for professional writers administered by the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada.

In 2023, the Dawson City townsite became part of the Tr’ondëk-Klondike UNESCO World Heritage Site, because of its archaeological record highlighting the transformation of the site from predominantly Indigenous to predominantly European use, and the adaptations that the Indigenous people made in response to European colonialism.

==Geography==

Dawson City lies on the Tintina Fault. This fault has created the Tintina Trench and continues eastward for several hundred kilometres. Erosional remnants of lava flows form outcrops immediately north and west of Dawson City.

=== Climate ===
Dawson City has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dsc&quot;), with significantly higher continentality (greater temperature swings) than the territory capital of Whitehorse. Despite this classification, most precipitation actually occurs during summer and July is the wettest month. However, April, one of the six warmer months is sufficiently drier than October and November. Hence the letter &#x27;s&#x27; is used instead of &#x27;f&#x27; (as in &quot;Dfc&quot;).

The average temperature in July is and in January is . The highest temperature ever recorded is on 9 July 1899 and 18 June 1950. The lowest temperature ever recorded is on 3 February 1947. It experiences a wide range of temperatures surpassing in most summers and dropping below in winter. In the very cold month of December 1917, the temperature did not rise above and it averaged .

The community is at an elevation of and the average rainfall in July is and the average snowfall in January is . Dawson has an average total annual snowfall of and averages 77 frost free days per year. The town is built on a layer of frozen earth, which may pose a threat to the town&#x27;s infrastructure in the future if the permafrost melts.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Dawson had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

=== Ethnicity ===
According to the 2021 Census, the town is predominantly European Canadian with 60.8% of the population with Indigenous Canadians accounting for 31.4% of the population and East Asian Canadians accounting for 3.0% of the population.

== Economy ==
Today, Dawson City&#x27;s main industries are tourism and gold mining.

=== Energy ===
Electricity is provided by Yukon Energy Corporation (YEC). Most of the grid power is hydroelectric power through the north-south grid from dams near Mayo, Whitehorse and Aishihik Lake. After the local hydroelectric power plant for the gold dredges was shut down in 1966, YEC provided electrical power from local diesel generators. In 2004 YEC connected Dawson to its grid system. Since then the diesel generators function as a backup to the grid.

=== Gold mining ===
Gold mining started in 1896 with the Bonanza (Rabbit) Creek discovery by George Carmack, Tagish Charlie and Skookum Jim Mason (Keish). The area&#x27;s creeks were quickly staked and most of the thousands who arrived in the spring of 1898 for the Klondike Gold Rush found that there was very little opportunity to benefit directly from gold mining. Many instead became entrepreneurs to provide services to miners.
Starting approximately 10 years later, large gold dredges began an industrial mining operation, scooping huge amounts of gold out of the creeks, and completely reworking the landscape, altering the locations of rivers and creeks and leaving tailing piles in their wake. A network of canals and dams were built to the north to produce hydroelectric power for the dredges. The dredges shut down for the winter, but one built for &quot;Klondike Joe Boyle&quot; was designed to operate year-round, and Boyle had it operate all through one winter. That dredge (Dredge No. 4) is open as a National Historic Site of Canada on Bonanza Creek.

The last dredge shut down in 1966, and the hydroelectric facility, at North Fork, was closed when the City of Dawson declined an offer to purchase it. Since then, placer miners returned to the status of being the primary mining operators in the region until recently. In 2016, Goldcorp announced a takeover of Kaminak Gold&#x27;s Coffee Project south of Dawson. This marked a shift in the region, drawing the interest of the major gold mining companies in the Yukon. In 2017, Newmont Mining Corporation, Barrick Gold and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited have all committed significant investment, engaging in the exploration of properties across the Central Yukon.

=== Tourism ===

There are eight National Historic Sites of Canada located in Dawson, including the &quot;Dawson Historical Complex&quot;, a National Historic Site encompassing the historic core of the town.

The Downtown Hotel at Second Avenue and Queen Street has garnered media attention for its unusual &quot;Sourtoe Cocktail&quot;, which features a real mummified human toe. The hotel and the toe received increased attention in June 2017 after the toe was stolen; it was soon returned to the hotel by mail along with a written apology.

Bonanza Creek has two National Historic Sites; the Discovery Claim and the Dredge No. 4.

Tr&#x27;ochëk is the site of a traditional Hän fishing camp on the flats at the confluence of the Klondike River and Yukon River. The site is owned and managed by the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in First Nation. In addition to the fishing camp remains, the site includes traditional plant harvesting areas and lookout points.

Diamond Tooth Gertie&#x27;s Gambling Hall puts on nightly vaudeville shows during tourist season, from May to September.

== Sports ==

Every February, Dawson City acts as the halfway mark for the Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race. Mushers entered in the event have a mandatory 36-hour layover in Dawson City while getting their rest and preparing for the second half of the world&#x27;s toughest sled dog race.

Dawson City also hosts a softball tournament which brings teams from Inuvik in late summer. Furthermore, a volleyball tournament is held annually at the end of October and is attended by various high schools across Yukon.

The city was home to the Dawson City Nuggets hockey team, which in 1905 challenged the Ottawa Silver Seven for the Stanley Cup. Travelling to Ottawa by dog sled, ship, and train, the team lost the most lopsided series in Stanley Cup history, losing two games by the combined score of 32 to 4.

== Government ==
In 2004, the Yukon government removed the mayor and the town council, as a result of the town going bankrupt. The territorial government accepted a large portion of the responsibility for this situation in March 2006, writing off $3.43 million of the debt and leaving the town with $1.5 million still to pay off. Elections were set for June 15, 2006. John Steins, a local artist and one of the leaders of the movement to restore democracy to Dawson, was acclaimed as mayor, while 13 residents ran for the four council seats. Steins was succeeded in office by former mayor Peter Jenkins, who in turn was succeeded by Wayne Potoroka.

In 2021, four candidates ran for mayor, and former city councillor William (Bill) Kendrick won the election and is the current mayor of Dawson City.

Other past mayors of Dawson City have included Art Webster, Colin Mayes, Yolanda Burkhard, Mike Comadina and Vi Campbell.

In the Legislative Assembly of Yukon, Dawson City is in the electoral district of Klondike, currently represented by Sandy Silver of the Yukon Liberal Party.

The government of Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in, now a self-governing First Nation, is also located in Dawson.

In 2024, councillors refused to swear allegiance to King Charles III, in solidarity with councillor-elect Darwyn Lynn, who refused in protest against the historic relations between the monarchy and the First Nations.

=== City or town status ===

Dawson was incorporated as a city in 1902 when it met the criteria for &quot;city&quot; status under the municipal act of that time. It retained the incorporation even as the population plummeted. When a new municipal act was adopted in the 1980s, Dawson met the criteria of &quot;town&quot;, and was incorporated as such although with a special provision to allow it to continue to use the word &quot;City&quot;, partially for historical reasons and partially to distinguish it from Dawson Creek, a small city in northeastern British Columbia. Dawson Creek is also named in honour of George M. Dawson. This led the territorial government to post the following signs at the boundaries of the town: &quot;Welcome to the Town of the City of Dawson&quot;. As of the 2001 &quot;Municipal Act&quot;, the town&#x27;s official legal name is now simply the &quot;City of Dawson&quot;.

<text>Fruitcake or fruit cake is a cake made with candied or dried fruit, nuts, and spices, and optionally soaked in spirits. In the United Kingdom, certain rich versions may be iced and decorated.

Fruitcakes are usually served in celebration of weddings and Christmas. Given their rich nature, fruitcakes are most often consumed on their own, as opposed to with condiments (such as butter or cream). Fruit cake is different to fruit bread, but may share similar toppings and mixtures.

==History==
The earliest recipe from ancient Rome lists pomegranate seeds, pine nuts, and raisins that were mixed into barley mash. In the Middle Ages, honey, spices, and preserved fruits were added.

Fruitcakes soon proliferated all over Europe. Recipes varied greatly in different countries throughout the ages, depending on the available ingredients as well as (in some instances) church regulations forbidding the use of butter, regarding the observance of Fasting. Pope Innocent VIII (1432–1492) finally granted the use of butter, in a written permission known as the ‘Butter Letter&#x27; or &quot;Butterbrief&quot; in 1490, giving permission to Saxony to use milk and butter in the &quot;Stollen&quot; fruitcakes.

Starting in the 16th century, sugar from the American Colonies (and the discovery that high concentrations of sugar could preserve fruits) created an excess of candied fruit, thus making fruitcakes more affordable and popular. The 17th-century English fruitcake was originally yeast-leavened, and the rum and dried fruit helped extend the shelf life of the cake.

==In various countries==
=== Australia ===
In Australia, fruitcake is consumed throughout the year, but most commonly at Christmas, and is available at most major retail outlets. The cake is rarely given icing; often it is consumed with butter or margarine, or custard.

=== Bahamas ===
In the Bahamas, not only is the fruitcake drenched with rum, but the ingredients are as well. All of the candied fruits, walnuts, and raisins are placed in an enclosed container and are soaked with the darkest variety of rum, anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 months in advance. The cake ingredients are mixed, and once the cake has finished baking, rum is poured onto it while it is still hot.

=== Bulgaria ===

In Bulgaria, the common fruitcake is known as &quot;keks&quot; ( ), is home-made and is consumed throughout the year. Recipes for &quot;keks&quot; vary, but commonly it contains flour, butter and/or cooking oil, milk, yeast, yoghurt, eggs, cocoa, walnuts, and raisins. It is usually baked in Bundt-style pans.

There is also another specific type of fruitcake prepared for Easter, which is known as kozunak ( ).

=== Canada ===
The fruitcake is commonly eaten during the Christmas season in Canada. Rarely is it seen during other times of the year. The Canadian fruitcake is similar in style to the UK version. However, there is rarely icing on the cake, and alcohol is not commonly put into Christmas cakes that are sold. The cakes are shaped like a small loaf of bread, and often covered in marzipan.

Dark, moist and rich Christmas fruitcakes are the most frequently consumed, with white Christmas fruitcake less common. These cakes tend to be made in mid-November to early December when the weather starts to cool down. They are a staple during Christmas dinner and also can be a gift generally exchanged between business associates and close friends/family.

It is called &quot;gâteau aux fruits&quot; in Quebec and New-Brunswick.

=== Chile ===
Pan de Pascua is a fruitcake traditionally eaten around Christmas and Epiphany.

=== France ===
In France, fruitcake is called &quot;cake aux fruits confits&quot;.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, baked goods which fit the description of fruitcake are not usually regarded as cake but rather as sweet breads.
&quot;Stollen&quot; is loaf-shaped and often powdered with icing sugar on the outside. It is usually made with yeast, butter, water, and flour, with the addition of citrus zest, candied citrus peel, raisins, and almonds.

The most famous Stollen is the &quot;Dresdner Stollen&quot;, sold at the Dresden Christmas market, the Striezelmarkt.
Official &quot;Dresden Stollen&quot;, produced by only 150 bakers in Dresden and some adjacent settlements, bears a special seal depicting Elector Augustus II the Strong. Typically, it is covered with a crust of compacted powdered sugar around 1 cm thick, but it is actually defined by its richness in butter and certain fruit and nuts: Per kilogram flour, &quot;Dresdner Stollen&quot; is mandated by law to contain at least 650 grams sultanas, 500 grams of butter, 200 grams succade, and 150 grams of almonds. The recipe originated in 1491, when after several generations of lobbying by Elector Ernest, Duke Albert III, and their ancestors, Pope Innocent VIII gave an exemption to the Roman Catholic ban on using butter during Lent to Saxon bakers.
In Bremen, the local fruitcake called Klaben is traditionally sold and eaten during the Christmas season. &quot;Bremer Klaben&quot; is a kind of stollen which is not dusted with powdered sugar after baking. Both &quot;Dresdner Stollen&quot; and &quot;Bremen Klaben&quot; are protected geographical indications.

In Southern Germany and the Alpine region, &quot;Früchtebrot&quot; (also called &quot;Berewecke&quot;, &quot;Birnenbrot&quot;, &quot;Hutzenbrot&quot;, &quot;Hutzelbrot&quot;, &quot;Kletzenbrot&quot;, &quot;Schnitzbrot&quot;, or &quot;Zelten&quot;) is a sweet, dark bread baked with nuts and dried fruit, e.g. apricots, figs, dates, plums, etc.

=== India ===
Fruitcake is a rich dense cake packed with dry fruits and nuts flavoured with spices usually made during Christmas. In India, this is found everywhere during the Christmas season, although it is also available commonly throughout the year.

=== Ireland ===

In Ireland, a type of sweetbread called barmbrack is eaten at Hallowe&#x27;en. The cake contains different objects such as a ring or small coin, each signifying a different fortune for the person who finds it.

=== Italy ===
Panforte is a chewy, dense Tuscan fruitcake dating back to 13th-century Siena. Panforte is strongly flavored with spices (&quot;panforte&quot; means &quot;strong bread&quot;) and baked in a shallow form. Genoa&#x27;s fruitcake, a lower, denser but still crumbly variety, is called pandolce (&quot;sweet bread&quot;).

There are various types of fruitcakes from the Emilia-Romagna region, most being dark and heavily spiced with an abundance of candied fruit and nuts. The &quot;certosino&quot; from Bologna is a round cake similar to panforte but with aromatic spices and a variety of whole-halved candied fruit decorating the top; dark chocolate is often added to the dough for a richer flavour. The certosino is low and very dense. &quot;Panone&quot;, produced in much of Emilia, is similar to the certosino, but with a lighter, fluffier dough and candied fruit inside the cake rather than used as decoration. &quot;Panpepato&quot; from Ferrara has a dough similar to panone but has a higher ginger content. Candied fruit is not often found and instead there is a high concentration of nuts within the dough; the entire cake is often coated in dark chocolate.

&quot;Gubana&quot; is a Christmas/holiday cake from the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, specifically from the area around Cividale del Friuli. It is a leavened dough cake with a filling of nuts, dried fruit, sugar, and grappa which is rolled into a spiral filled tube which is then twisted into the shape of a rose or snail&#x27;s shell. Gubana is often eaten with alcohol (slivovitz or grappa) around the holiday season. It combines Italian, Friulan, and Slovenian tastes and cooking styles to create a unique sweet.

Panettone is a Milanese sweet bread (widely available throughout Italy and in many other countries), served around Christmas, which is traditionally filled with dried and candied fruits, with a bread-like consistency.

=== New Zealand ===
Fruitcakes arrived in New Zealand with early settlers from Britain. Until the 1960s fruitcake was generally homemade, but since then has become commercially widely available in a range of styles. Light coloured fruitcake is often sold as &quot;tennis cake&quot; or &quot;light fruit-cake&quot; all year round.

Most New Zealand wedding cakes are finely iced and decorated fruitcake often several tiers high. Most fruitcake is eaten in the Christmas period. It is dark, rich and made from multiple dried fruits. Homemade cakes may use brandy or sherry to enhance flavour rather than as a preservative. They may be square or round, iced or uniced. A Christmas cake is usually simply decorated with a Christmas scene or the words Merry Christmas.

=== Poland ===
&quot;Keks&quot; is a traditional fruitcake eaten during Christmas season. It is a loaf shaped sponge cake with a substantial content of nuts, raisins, figs and candied fruits.

=== Portugal ===
Although French in its origin, Bolo Rei is a traditional fruitcake enjoyed during Christmas season and a staple dessert in any Portuguese home during the holidays. Included is the characteristic fava bean and, according to tradition, whoever finds the fava bean has to pay for the cake the following year.

=== Switzerland ===
Birnenbrot is a dense sweet Swiss fruitcake with candied fruits and nuts.

=== Anglophone Caribbean ===
Black cake, is a traditional part of Christmas celebration in the English Caribbean. The cake incorporates a large quantity of mixed fruits and rum/wine and becomes a treasured Christmas treat consumed and given out between the Christmas season and New Year. The fruit, wine and rum is prepared weeks, sometimes months, ahead, and has its origin in the English Christmas pudding, and can be quite expensive. It is very different from a North American fruitcake.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, fruitcakes are made in types ranging from extremely light to rich and moist.

The traditional Christmas cake is a round fruitcake covered in marzipan and then in white royal icing or fondant icing. It is often further decorated with snow scenes, holly leaves, and berries (real or artificial), or tiny decorative robins or snowmen. It is also the tradition for a similar kind of cake to be served at weddings.

In Yorkshire, fruitcake is often served accompanied with cheese. Fruitcakes in the United Kingdom often contain currants and glace cherries, an example of this type being the Genoa cake. A type of fruitcake which originated in Scotland, the Dundee Cake, owes its name to Keiller&#x27;s marmalade. It does not contain glace cherries, but is decorated with almonds.

Fruitcake was historically referred to as plum cake in England from around 1700.

=== United States ===

Typical American fruitcakes are rich in fruit and nuts.

Mail-order fruitcakes in America began in 1913. Some well-known American bakers of fruitcake include Collin Street Bakery in Corsicana, Texas, and The Claxton Bakery in Claxton, Georgia. Both Collin Street and Claxton are Southern companies with inexpensive access to large quantities of nuts, for which the expression &quot;nutty as a fruitcake&quot; was derived in 1935. Commercial fruitcakes are often sold from catalogues by charities as a fund raiser.

Fruitcakes are also made and sold by Christian monasteries, as a means of supporting the monks and nuns who reside there. Some well-known American monasteries which offer fruitcake include Abbey of Gethsemani, in Trappist, Kentucky; Assumption Abbey in Ava, Missouri; Monastery of the Holy Spirit, in Conyers, Georgia; and Trappist Abbey in Carlton, Oregon. The fruitcake produced by the Trappists of the Abbey of Gethsemani in Trappist, Kentucky earned the &quot;best overall fruitcake&quot; accolade from The Wall Street Journal.

Most American mass-produced fruitcakes are alcohol-free, but those made according to traditional recipes are saturated with liqueurs or brandy and covered in powdered sugar, both of which prevent mould. Brandy (or wine) soaked linens can be used to store the fruitcakes, and some people feel that fruitcakes improve with age.

In the United States, fruitcake has become a ridiculed dessert, in part due to inexpensive mass-produced cakes of questionable age. Some attribute the beginning of this trend to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; host Johnny Carson. He would joke that there is really only one fruitcake in the world, passed from family to family. After Carson&#x27;s death, the tradition continued with &quot;The Fruitcake Lady&quot; (Marie Rudisill), who made appearances on the show and offered her &quot;fruitcake&quot; opinions. In fact, the fruitcake had been a butt of jokes on television programs such as &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; and &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; years before &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; debuted. It appears to have first become a vilified confection in the early 20th century, as evidenced by Warner Brothers cartoons. It has also been used as a derogatory term for people who are considered weak, strange, or insane.

Since 1995, Manitou Springs, Colorado, has hosted the Great Fruitcake Toss on the first Saturday of every January. Leslie Lewis of the Manitou Springs Chamber of Commerce said that they encourage the use of recycled fruitcakes. The all-time Great Fruitcake Toss record is 1,420 feet, set in January 2007 by a group of eight Boeing engineers who built the &quot;Omega 380&quot;, a mock artillery piece fueled by compressed air pumped by an exercise bike.

== Shelf life ==
When a fruitcake contains a good deal of alcohol, it can be preserved for many years. For example, a fruitcake baked in 1878 has been kept as an heirloom by a family in Tecumseh, Michigan; as of 2019, the baker&#x27;s great-great-granddaughter is the custodian of the cake. Wrapping the cake in alcohol-soaked linen before storing is one method of lengthening its shelf life.

A 106-year-old fruitcake discovered in 2017 by the Antarctic Heritage Trust was described as in &quot;excellent condition&quot; and &quot;almost&quot; edible.

<text>Where&#x27;s Willy? is a website that tracks Canadian paper money, most commonly $5 bills, but also higher denominations. &quot;Where&#x27;s Willy&quot; is free, supported by users who pay a fee for extra features. The name Willy refers to Sir Wilfrid Laurier - the seventh Prime Minister of Canada whose portrait appears on the $5 banknote.

&quot;Where&#x27;s Willy?&quot; is a currency tracking spin-off of Where&#x27;s George, a site that tracks United States dollars.

==History==
The free site, established by Hank Eskin, a computer consultant in Brookline, Massachusetts, allows people to enter their local postal code and the serial and series of any Canadian denomination from $5 up to $100 they want to track. Once a bill is registered, the site reports the time between sightings, the distance travelled and any comments from the finders, and anyone who registered the bill earlier learns about it by e-mail and/or text messaging.

To increase the chance of having a bill reported, users write or stamp text on the bills encouraging bill finders to visit whereswilly.com and track the bill&#x27;s travels.

Since Canada has replaced the one and two dollar bills with more durable coins, the $5 note is the smallest denomination tracked by Where&#x27;s Willy.

In April 2003, &quot;USA Today&quot; named whereswilly.com one of its &quot;Hot Sites&quot;.

In 2005, the &quot;Montreal Mirror&quot; described the hobby as &quot;the most joy to be had with the five-dollar bill since the illegal defacing of Laurier with Spock ears.&quot; While the &quot;Mirror&quot; describes this practice as illegal, a 2015 statement from the Bank of Canada explained that &quot;Spocking Fives&quot; does not violate the Bank of Canada Act or the Criminal Code.

As of June 7, 2021, &quot;Where&#x27;s Willy?&quot; was tracking more than 5,800,000 bills totaling nearly $85,000,000.

Researchers studying pandemics have used currency tracking sites to plot human travel patterns, to find clues on how to combat the spread of diseases like SARS.

==Willy Index==
The &quot;Willy Index&quot; is a method of rating users based on how many bills they&#x27;ve entered and also by how many total hits they&#x27;ve had. The formula is as follows:

formula_1

Because of the nature of square roots and natural logarithms, the higher a user&#x27;s bills entered and hits are, the more of each are necessary to increase the score.

<doc id="634087" wikidata="Q316833" url="?curid=634087" title="Ariovistus">
<text>Ariovistus was a leader of the Suebi and other allied Germanic peoples in the second quarter of the 1st century BC. He and his followers took part in a war in Gaul, assisting the Arverni and Sequani in defeating their rivals, the Aedui. They then settled in large numbers into conquered Gallic territory, in the Alsace region. They were defeated however, in the Battle of Vosges and driven back over the Rhine in 58 BC by Julius Caesar.

==Primary sources==
Ariovistus and the events he was part of are known from Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;. Caesar, as a participant in the events, is a primary source, but as his &quot;Commentaries&quot; were partly political, they may be suspected of being self-serving. Later historians, notably Dio Cassius, are suspicious of his motives.

==Role and status==
Ariovistus was a native of the Suebi. He spoke Gaulish fluently. He had two wives, one of whom he had brought from home. The second, who was the sister of King Voccio of Noricum, he acquired in an arranged political marriage.

Ariovistus is described by Caesar as &quot;rex Germanorum&quot;. That is often translated as &quot;king of the Germans&quot;, but as Latin had no definite article, it could equally be translated as &quot;king of Germans&quot;, with no implication that he ruled all Germans. Indeed, Germania is known to have been divided into many tribal and political groups, many of which were ruled by kings. It is likely that Ariovistus&#x27;s authority extended only over those Germans who had settled in Gaul.

He was recognised as a king by the Roman Senate, but how closely the Roman title matched Ariovistus&#x27;s social status among the Germans remains unknown. Similarly, what the senate meant by &quot;rex&quot; at that moment in the history of the Roman Republic is not clear. The word &quot;king&quot; can have many meanings and did so throughout Rome&#x27;s centuries of history. Tacitus says that the Germans made a distinction between kings, who were chosen by birth, and military leaders, who were chosen by ability, and that kings did not have absolute power.

==Intervention in Gaul==
Some time before Caesar&#x27;s governorship of Gaul (which began in 58 BC), the Gaulish Arverni and Sequani enlisted Ariovistus&#x27;s aid in their war against the Aedui. The latter were a numerous Celtic people occupying the area of the upper Loire river in France. Their territory lay between their neighbors to the northeast, the Sequani, who occupied the Doubs river valley, and the Arverni in the Massif Central.

Caesar does not say what the cause of the conflict was, but the Sequani controlled access to the Rhine river along the valley of the Doubs. To that end, they had gradually built up an &quot;oppidum&quot;, or fortified town, at Vesontio. Tradesmen headed up the Rhone and its tributary the Saône (the ancient Arar) could not pass the Doubs at Vesontio without coming to terms with the Sequani, and no one could pass from the Rhine to the Rhone but on similar terms. The east of the entire great channel is bordered by the Jura mountains and the west by the Massif Central. Vesontio is from that stretch of the Rhine between Mulhouse and Basel.

The Arar formed part of the border between the Aedui and the Sequani. Strabo, who lived a generation after Caesar in the late republic and early empire, does make a statement concerning the cause of the conflict between the Sequani and Aedui, and it was in fact commercial, at least in Strabo&#x27;s view. Each tribe claimed the Arar and the transportation tolls from traffic along it, &quot;but now&quot;, says Strabo, &quot;everything is to the Romans.&quot; The Sequani also habitually supported the Germans in their previous frequent expeditions across the river, which shows that Ariovistus&#x27;s subsequent devastation of Sequani lands represented a new policy.

The location of the final battle between the Aedui and their enemies, which Caesar names as the Battle of Magetobriga, remains unknown, but Ariovistus&#x27;s 15,000 men turned the tide, and the Aedui became tributary to the Sequani. Cicero writes in 60 BC of a defeat sustained by the Aedui, perhaps in reference to this battle. Ariovistus seized a third of the Aeduan territory, settling 120,000 Germans there. To avoid infringing on his allies for the moment, Ariovistus must have passed over the low divide between the Rhine and the Doubs in the vicinity of Belfort and then have approached the Aedui along the Ognon river valley. That move left the Sequani between him and the Jura mountains, not a tolerable situation for either if they were not going to be allies.

Ariovistus made the decision to clear out the Sequani from the strategic Doubs valley and to repopulate it with Germanic settlers. He demanded a further third of Celtic land for his allies the Harudes. Caesar makes it clear that Germanic tribes were actually in the land of the Sequani and terrorising them. They are said to have controlled all the oppida, but that is not entirely true, as Vesontio was not under Germanic control. However, the country to the north of there was presumably under Germanic control.

==Confrontation with Caesar==

In 59 BC, while Julius Caesar was consul, Ariovistus had been recognised as &quot;king and friend&quot; by the Roman Senate. He had likely already crossed the Rhine at this point. Cicero indicates that the Aedui&#x27;s defeat took place in or before 60 BC. Pliny the Elder mentions a meeting between Caesar&#x27;s predecessor as proconsul of Cisalpine Gaul, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer, and a king of the Suebi; which took place during Celer&#x27;s proconsulship in 62 BC. The sequence of events given by Caesar also seems to indicate that, when his governorship began in 58 BC, the Germans had been settled in Gaul for longer than one year. However, without the status of friend, Ariovistus never could have secured Roman tolerance of his Rhine crossing, whenever it was, but would have been treated as hostile.

However, the Aedui were also allies of Rome, and in 58 BC Diviciacus, one of their senior magistrates, complained of Ariovistus&#x27;s cruelty and pleaded with Caesar to intervene on their behalf. Caesar sent ambassadors to summon Ariovistus to a conference. Ariovistus refused the summons on the grounds that if Caesar wanted to speak to him, he should come to him; besides, he was not prepared to enter Caesar&#x27;s territory without his army, which it would be impractical and expensive to gather.

Caesar, therefore, sent his ambassadors back to Ariovistus with his demands: that he bring no more of his people across the Rhine, and that he and his allies restore the hostages they had taken from the Aedui and undertake not to make war against them. He pointed out that Ariovistus was a friend to Rome and that the Romans had a prior interest, which they certainly would enforce. Ariovistus was welcome to keep the friendship of Rome if he would comply. Otherwise he, Caesar, acting in accordance with the decrees of the senate, could not let the harassment of the Aedui go unpunished.

Ariovistus refused to comply, asserting the right of conquest and the right of the conqueror to exact tribute from the conquered. Ridiculing Rome&#x27;s ability to protect its friends and boasting of Germanic invincibility, Ariovistus invited Caesar to attack him if he wished.

Caesar presents himself as attempting to act as an honest broker in the conflict, offering reasonable terms to settle the matter; however, as Caesar himself relates, Ariovistus later accused him of intending to lead an army against him right from the outset. Cassius Dio, writing more than two centuries later, agrees, characterising Caesar as attempting to provoke a war to win glory and power while he took pains not to look like the aggressor.

Whatever the motivation, Ariovistus overestimated the strength of his position. He apparently believed his official relationship to Rome was one of equals, but the Romans accepted no equals and saw the relationship as one between patron and client. He also appears to have believed the Romans would not attack him.

At the same time that Caesar received Ariovistus&#x27;s message, he heard from his Celtic allies that the Harudes were devastating the country of the Aedui and that 100 units of Suebi under the brothers Nasua and Cimberius were about to cross the Rhine. In response to such provocative acts, Caesar mobilized his troops.

==Battle==
Caesar was not far away, probably at or near Bibracte, where he had just won a major victory over the Helvetii and other Celtic tribes, and had disposed of the remaining Boii, allowing them to settle in Aeduan land. As only small numbers of Boii were left after the battle, the Aedui were obliging. Caesar must have immediately begun marching up the Saône valley.

Ariovistus, being a skilled general in his own right, identified Vesontio as the key to the strategic Doubs valley and marched for it, but Caesar, probably relying on intelligence from the Gauls, arrived there first and established a main base. He had to combat a panic among his own men, who had heard that the Germans were some sort of superior warriors. Caesar called a meeting and then berated the centurions for making that necessary instead of just following orders. In one of his noted speeches he recalled them to duty and ended by threatening to march the next morning early with only the 10th legion, about whose valour he said he had no doubts at all. The speech had the intended effect of arousing fanatical loyalty in the 10th and shame and rivalry in the others.

Vesontio is about from the Rhine. Apparently Ariovistus had learned of the Roman presence there because he stopped marching and waited. Using Diviciacus as a guide, Caesar&#x27;s troops marched in 7 days, arriving probably in the vicinity of Belfort. The army was moving only 7 miles per day and was relying on Diviciacus to lead them through open country; thus, it is probably safe to assume there were no Roman roads between Besançon and Belfort at that time. Caesar says that he took a detour to stay in open country, most likely west of the Doubs, through the lands of his Celtic allies.

Ariovistus sent ambassadors to Caesar agreeing, because Caesar had come to him, to a conference. Caesar, known for giving his potential enemies every last chance, entertained the idea that Ariovistus was coming to his senses. It was agreed that they should meet on horseback, accompanied only by cavalry. Caesar brought mounted soldiers of the 10th legion, who joked that they had been promoted to knights, which was the origin of the 10th legion&#x27;s nickname &quot;Equestris.&quot;

The meeting of the two on a high mound between the camps with the bodyguards a few hundred yards away is surely a rare event in the history of parlays. They both got a chance to present and defend their points of view, face to face, with no filtering or interference from others. Caesar concentrated on Roman policy. Ariovistus now took the tack of claiming the Aedui had attacked him rather than vice versa.

Caesar reports that Ariovistus stated that &quot;he was not so uncivilized nor so ignorant of affairs, as not to know that the Aedui in the very last war with the Allobroges had neither rendered assistance to the Romans, nor received any from the Roman people in the struggles which the Aedui had been maintaining with him and with the Sequani.&quot;

The word rendered above as &quot;uncivilized&quot; (McDevitte &amp; Bohn&#x27;s translation) is &quot;barbarus&quot;. The classical civilizations throughout their long literary periods consistently characterized the peoples of the north and east as &quot;barbari&quot;, usually rendered in English as &quot;barbarians&quot;. The word reflected the mixture of condescension, contempt and fear the Greeks and Romans had for those who did not share their civilisation or values. Only rarely did such barbarians manage to make known their feelings about such use of the concept, as did Ariovistus on that occasion.

Ariovistus described official Roman friendship as a sham, and he uttered another uncanny prophecy: that he could gain the real friendship of many leading men at Rome by killing Caesar. Moreover, the senate, he said, had determined that Gaul should be governed by its own laws and so ought to be free. By then, Caesar had to escape to his bodyguards, as the Germanic cavalry was beginning to hurl missiles.

The next day, Ariovistus invited Caesar to another parlay. Making a point to emphasize that he could not trust the Germans, Caesar sent two junior officers, Gaius Valerius Procillus and Marcus Mettius. They found Ariovistus in the process of moving his army up and were put in chains.

Over the next few days, Ariovistus moved his camp to within two miles of Caesar&#x27;s, covering the move with cavalry skirmishes. The Germanic tribes had developed a special force consisting of cavalry mixed with equal numbers of light infantry whose only function was to support cavalrymen, individually or in units, who had become enmeshed in combat. Caesar&#x27;s men stood in battle formation outside the walls of his camp each day, but only skirmishes were offered. Finally, from a distance of two miles, Ariovistus cut Caesar&#x27;s supply line, isolating his garrison.

Caesar claims the Germanic side did not attack in force because their wise women had pronounced from their divinations that they should not engage in battle before the new moon. However, it is evident that there was a more mundane reason for Ariovistus declining battle: he had Caesar surrounded. Dio Cassius notes the presence of Germans on the slope of the hill behind the camp, where the &quot;Porta Quaestoria&quot;, the gate where provisions were brought in, would have been. Ariovistus had Caesar under siege and hoped to starve him out.

Under its best general, the Roman army now demonstrated the classic tactics that had made Rome master of the entire Mediterranean region to such an extent that the Romans were able to call it &quot;our sea&quot;. It is unlikely that Ariovistus suspected what was coming. Caesar knew that the Germans outnumbered him and that his best and only defense was an attack. He had to force the Germans to battle or be starved into surrender.

Leaving a light defense in camp Caesar advanced in &quot;acies triplex&quot; to within of the German camp. Under guard of the first two lines, the third built another &quot;castra&quot; (camp) in which Caesar placed two legions and the auxiliaries while the other four legions returned to the main camp. It is easy to say in retrospect that Ariovistus should have thrown his entire force against the two lines of battle while the third (the reserve) was preoccupied or that he should have attacked the four legions while they were divided from the two, but the tides of battle are never predictable, no matter the odds.

The next day Caesar used the auxiliaries from the forward camp as cover while he brought all six rested and fed legions to a starting line before it in &quot;acies triplex&quot; formation. Each tribune conspicuously took personal charge of one legion, and the quaestor took the 6th. Caesar wanted the men to see that they were under the eyes of the entire senior command, which would certainly share their fate. They then began an advance on the weakest feature of the Germanic force, its open camp.

Caesar says that the enemy camp was defended by a wagon train, drawn up behind the German forces, which had now either to fight or to run. The usual chorus of wailing women was placed on the wagons. The effect that it really had on the Germanic soldiers is unclear. The idea was to place the tribe in a situation where they must be victorious or be annihilated with their women and children.

The Germans formed by ethnic group before the Romans: Harudes, Marcomanni, Triboci, Vangiones, Nemetes, Sedusii and Suebi. Apparently, they lacked a reserve, and the Romans followed their established practice of two units forward to one back. Caesar opened the battle with a charge against the Germanic left, which seemed the weakest part of the line. The Germanic forces responded by charging with such speed that the Romans were unable to cast &quot;pila&quot; and the fight entered the swordplay stage immediately. The Roman open line of battle, in which each man was left room to fight, prevailed. The Germans crowded into a phalanx and began to push the Romans backward, even though the latter jumped up on the shields of the enemy to thrust them downward.

A cavalry officer, Publius Licinius Crassus, from his advantageous position on his horse, grasped what was happening and on his own initiative ordered the third line of battle (the infantry reserve) into action in support of the Roman left. The Romans were momentarily victorious on their left. That decision was usually reserved to senior officers but Crassus won high praise for it after the battle and was probably slated for rapid advancement. The enemy line broke and ran for the Rhine, which was away, women and all, with the Roman cavalry in hot pursuit.

Some, including Ariovistus himself, managed to cross the river in boats or by swimming. The rest were cut down by Roman cavalry, including both of Ariovistus&#x27;s wives and one of his daughters; another daughter was taken prisoner. Both Caesar&#x27;s emissaries were rescued unharmed, to relate their harrowing adventures as the Germans debated (in their presence) whether they should be burned then or later. Caesar said that encountering Procillus and freeing him from his chains gave him as much pleasure as the victory, which offers some insight into the emotional climate of Caesar&#x27;s forces.

==Aftermath==
If Caesar named the units in the Germanic army from left to right, the Suebi were on Caesar&#x27;s right, suffered the brunt of the losses, and they were most pursued by Roman cavalry. The Suebi, who had planned to cross the Rhine, turned back. The Germanic tribes that had joined the Suebi in their foray now bought peace by turning against them and attacking them in retreat. In just a few days, the capability had been removed from the Suebi of mounting any offensive over or on the Rhine, which they assiduously avoided for some time to come, taking refuge in the Black Forest as the future Alamanni.

Ariovistus may have escaped, but it is unlikely that he retained any position in the citizen-army of the Suebi. When the Usipetes and Tencteri were driven from their lands by the Suebi in 55 BC, he was not mentioned. He was dead by late 54 BC, when his death is said to have been a cause of indignation among the Germans.

Caesar was left a free hand on the left bank of the Rhine. He immediately went on to a campaign against the Belgae, and the disposition of the lands on the Rhine is missing from his account. The question of who held Alsace is historically significant. The place names in it are Celtic, but where were the Celts? They do not appear in Caesar&#x27;s campaign against Ariovistus. Very likely, they had been in part the Boii, who were a strong force on the Danube until they encountered the Marcomanni and Quadi. Fear of the Germani forced them out of the region, only to be mainly destroyed by their opposition to Caesar. Caesar had just settled the last of them among the Aedui when the campaign against Ariovistus began.

In the early Empire, the same Germanic tribes that had fought for Ariovistus appeared on both sides of the Rhine in Alsace. Then, they were of mixed ethnicity and perhaps no longer spoke Germanic. It seems clear that the Romans had allowed them to take the former lands of the now missing Boii, in exchange for serving as a buffer against the Suebi. They did serve long and faithfully. The province of Germania Superior was formed from them. As for the Germans who had already settled among the Celts, it is not clear what happened to them; however, there is no record of any ethnic cleansing. It is more likely that they integrated into the new Romano-Celtic population.

==Etymology==
Most scholars consider Ariovistus to be derived from the Gaulish &quot;ario&quot; (&quot;noble, free, advanced&quot;) and &quot;uid-, uidi-, uissu- (&quot;perception, knowledge&quot;).&quot; &quot;Ariovistus&quot; thus would mean &quot;Noble Sage&quot; or &quot;He Who Knows in Advance.&quot; Ariovistus can be found listed in Celtic etymological dictionaries among similar Gaulish names, such as Ariomanus (&quot;Good Leader&quot;), Ariogaisus (&quot;Spear Leader&quot;), and Ariobindus (&quot;White Leader&quot;).

Another possibility is that it&#x27;s a combination of Proto-Germanic &quot;*harjaz&quot; (&quot;army, host&quot;) and &quot;*fristaz&quot; (&quot;lord, ruler&quot;). In other words, he would&#x27;ve been known by his kinsmen as *Harjafristaz. Similar reconstructed Germanic names are *Harjawaldaz (En. Harold) and *Waldaharjaz (En. Walther), both also translating to army-ruler.

The segmentation of the name into &quot;Ario-&quot; and &quot;-vistus&quot; is well established. A 19th-century connection between &quot;Ehre&quot;, &quot;honor&quot;, and &quot;Ario-&quot; turned out to be invalid. There is currently no complete agreement on how the word should be derived. Most etymological dictionaries are silent about it.

William Smith&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography&quot; and, under Ariovistus, suggests another derivation of the first element that seems to fit runic inscriptions known today. He translates &quot;Ario-&quot; by German &quot;Heer&quot;, &quot;a host&quot; and &quot;-vistus&quot; by German &quot;Fürst&quot;, &quot;a prince&quot;.

If &quot;Ario-&quot; is a Roman representation of a Germanic ancestor of &quot;Heer&quot;, the ancestor is West Germanic &quot;*harja-&quot; from Germanic &quot;*harjaz&quot; appearing in such constructs as &quot;*harja-waldaz&quot; and &quot;*harja-bergaz&quot;. The Indo-European root is &quot;*koro-&quot;. The Indo-European linguist, Julius Pokorny, in &quot;Indogermanisches Etymologisches Woerterbuch&quot; (which is available on the Internet) simply states on Page 67 under &quot;ario-?&quot; that the Celto-Germanic personal name, Ariovistus, proves nothing (with regard to &quot;Aryan&quot;) because it can come from &quot;*Hario-&quot;.

The reconstructed &quot;*harja&quot; is actually attested in Runic inscriptions as &quot;Harja&quot; and &quot;Harijaz&quot; standing alone (possibly meaning a man of the Harii) &quot;Harijaz Leugaz&quot; (Lugii?) and &quot;Swaba-harjaz&quot; (Suebi?) in combination, as well as being a prefix in &quot;Hari-uha&quot; &quot;first warrior&quot; and &quot;Hariwolafz&quot; &quot;battle wolf&quot;.

Following Smith, Ariovistus translates more directly to &quot;general&quot;, raising the possibility that the name is a title granted to the man by the Suebi, his real name subsequently eclipsed by it. Caesar relates that the Suebi maintained a citizen army of 100,000 men picked yearly, and Tacitus that the Suebi were not one tribe. Ariovistus was probably picked from among the generals to lead an army group into Gaul, as seers were generally used for that purpose.

Kruk was signed as the third overall selection in the Special Draft selection on June 13, 1981. He began his professional career with the San Diego Padres after being drafted in 1981. He played in such outposts as Walla Walla, Reno, Beaumont, and Las Vegas, before making his debut with the Padres in . In this same year he played for the Águilas de Mexicali of the Mexican Pacific League for the 1986–87 season. Kruk helped Mexicali win both the League championship and Caribbean Series title.

Kruk&#x27;s breakout year was 1987 with the Padres. He hit .313 with 20 home runs and 91 RBI, and stole 18 bases, showing surprising speed for someone of his build, although he was caught ten times. He was featured as a backup on the National League All-Star Team in the Nintendo game &quot;R.B.I. Baseball&quot;. On April 13, 1987, Marvell Wynne, Tony Gwynn, and Kruk became the first players in major league history to open their half of the 1st inning with three consecutive solo home runs in a 13–6 loss to the San Francisco Giants.

In October 1987, Kruk rented a house in San Diego with two other men: Roy Plummer, a high school friend, and Vernon (Jay) Hafer, an acquaintance of Plummer&#x27;s. They socialized and partied together, with Plummer almost always picking up the check. Unbeknownst to Kruk, who moved out in November to play winter ball in Mexico, Plummer was funding the group&#x27;s lifestyle by moonlighting as an armed robber, with Hafer serving as his getaway driver. The FBI informed Kruk of his roommates&#x27; criminal activities during spring training in February 1988, approaching him before batting practice with a photo of Plummer taken during a bank robbery. According to the FBI, Plummer believed that Kruk had turned him in to the police, and Kruk lived in fear of reprisal until Plummer was apprehended on September 19, 1988. Kruk has stated that the ongoing stress from the episode negatively affected his on-field performance that season.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
On June 2, 1989, the Padres dealt Kruk, along with Randy Ready, to the Philadelphia Phillies for Chris James.

After the trade, Kruk blossomed into an All-Star as the team used him primarily at first base. Kruk played in the All-Star Game in 1991, 1992, and 1993. In his 1993 appearance at the Midsummer Classic, he had a memorable at bat when he flailed wildly at 98 mile per hour fastball from Seattle Mariners pitcher Randy Johnson. Johnson&#x27;s first pitch flew over Kruk&#x27;s head to the backstop, leading Kruk to feign heart palpitations and remark, &quot;That boy throws too hard, and he&#x27;s too wild. He could kill someone.&quot;

Kruk, who batted .316/.430/.475 in , was also a member of the Phillies&#x27; &quot;Macho Row&quot; which led the team to the World Series against the Toronto Blue Jays. In the losing effort, Kruk batted .348/.500/.391 in the Series.

During spring training in , Kruk was diagnosed with testicular cancer (ultimately resulting in the removal of one testicle) after an errant pickoff throw from teammate Mitch Williams hit him in the groin and broke his protective cup. Additionally, weight gain and the astroturf at Veterans Stadium exacerbated his knee problems. After the season, Kruk was granted free agency.

===Chicago White Sox===
Moving to the American League to serve as a designated hitter, Kruk signed with the Chicago White Sox on May 12, , batting .308/.399/.390 in his only season with the ballclub. In the first inning of the White Sox&#x27;s 8–3 loss to the Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards on July 30, he singled off Scott Erickson, advanced to and was stranded on third base, removed himself from the game and promptly retired as an active player due to chronic knee soreness. He had made the decision two days earlier and informed his teammates on the eve of his retirement. The parting statement he issued to the media simply read, &quot;The desire to compete at this level is gone. When that happens, it&#x27;s time to go.&quot; Kruk finished his 10-year career with a .300 batting average, 100 home runs and 592 runs batted in.

==Post-baseball activities==
A quotable character throughout his career who had written a book called &quot;I Ain&#x27;t an Athlete, Lady&quot; published in 1994, Kruk turned to broadcasting and commenting on the game. He has since worked for &quot;Major League Baseball on Fox&quot;, &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot;, and local telecasts in Philadelphia. Kruk has been a resident of Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey.

Kruk coached for a year within the Phillies organization. He coached the Reading Phillies of the Class AA Eastern League during the 2001 season.

Kruk had acting roles in film and television, including the 1996 film &quot;The Fan&quot;, &quot;The Sandlot: Heading Home&quot;, and &quot;American Pastime&quot;. In a 2008 episode of Adult Swim&#x27;s adult cartoon &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Sirens&quot;, Kruk guest starred, voicing the role of himself. Kruk also appeared in the Sawyer Brown music video &quot;Round Here&quot;.

In , ESPN hired Kruk as an analyst on &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot;. He also wrote a column called &quot;Chewing the Fat&quot; on ESPN.com.

Kruk coached the National League team in the Taco Bell All-Star Legends &amp; Celebrity Softball Game in Anaheim, California, on July 12, 2010.

Kruk appeared in &quot;MLB on ESPN&quot; commercials, playing himself as part of moments in baseball history; for example, an old briefcase belonging to Kruk buried in the infield dirt containing a rotten sandwich caused the bugs to attack Karl Ravech dressed up as Yankees pitcher Joba Chamberlain, mocking game 2 of the 2007 ALDS between the Yankees and the Indians. He, along with Steve Phillips and Gary Thorne, was a commentator on the video games &quot;MLB 2K10, MLB 2K11, MLB 2K12&quot; and &quot;MLB 2K13&quot;.

In , ESPN hired Kruk to be the color commentator for &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; alongside Dan Shulman. Also in 2012, fellow West Virginians, the Davisson Brothers Band, were approached by Kruk to write a new theme song for &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot;. In 2015, once again, Kruk, asked the Davisson Brothers Band to record a special track, titled &quot;Right Here on ESPN&quot;, for the ESPN bumpers during the July 4 weekend.

Following the 2016 baseball season in October, Kruk and ESPN mutually agreed to part ways. In February 2017, Comcast SportsNet announced that they hired Kruk to join the Philadelphia Phillies broadcast team, replacing Matt Stairs, who was hired as the Phillies&#x27; hitting coach.

After moving to Naples, Florida six years prior, Kruk took over the Seacrest Country Day School softball team as the head coach in 2016. He was named the Florida Athletic Coaches Association Class 2A Coach of the Year for the district in his first year with the Stingrays.

==Honors and awards==
*In 2003—the final year of Veterans Stadium—Philadelphia Phillies fans voted Kruk as the first baseman on the Phillies All-Vet Team (1971–2003).
*On August 12, 2011, Kruk was inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame.

<text>The Geological Survey of Canada (GSC; , CGC) is a Canadian federal government agency responsible for performing geological surveys of the country developing Canada&#x27;s natural resources and protecting the environment. A branch of the Earth Sciences Sector of Natural Resources Canada, the GSC is the country&#x27;s oldest scientific agency and was one of its first government organizations.

==History==

In September 1841, the Province of Canada legislature passed a resolution that authorized the sum of £1,500 sterling be granted to the government for the estimated expense of performing a geological survey of the province. In 1842, the Geological Survey of Canada was formed to fulfill this request.


William Edmond Logan was in Montreal at the time and made it known that he was interested in participating in this survey. Gaining recommendations from prominent British scientists, Logan was appointed the first GSC director on April 14, 1842. Four months later, Logan arrived in Kingston, Ontario, to compile the existing body of knowledge of Canada&#x27;s geology. In the spring of 1843, Logan established the GSC&#x27;s headquarters in Montreal (in his brother&#x27;s warehouse and then in a rented house on Great St. James Street (now Saint Jacques Street). One of the prominent cartographers and the chief topographical draughtsman was Robert Barlow, who began his work in 1855. Chemist T. Sterry Hunt joined in the early days and the Survey added paleontological capability in 1856 with the arrival of Elkanah Billings. After Aylesworth Perry was appointed as acting librarian in 1881 he prepared the catalogue of reference works on geology, mineralogy, metallurgy, chemistry and natural history. George Mercer Dawson became a staff member in 1875, progressed to assistant director in 1883 and finally to director of the Geological Survey of Canada in 1895.
The Geological Survey of Canada first began allowing women to conduct fieldwork in the early 1950s. Dr. Alice Wilson, the first of these women, lobbied for the inclusion of paleontologist Frances Wagner shortly afterward. Around this same time, the GSC employed a third woman Dr. Helen Belyea.

== Programs and activities ==

===1. Geoscience for mineral and Northern Development===
Canada has the geoscience required to attract mineral investment across Canada, to inform sustainable development of the North, and to work with allied countries to become a leading supplier of responsibly developed minerals.

===2. Geoscience for land management===
Canada has the geoscience required to inform responsible resource development and environmental stewardship in both terrestrial and marine environments, and to support its extended continental shelf submissions to the United Nations.

===3. Geoscience for climate and disaster resilience===
Decision makers and communities have access to the geoscience that they need to make Canada more resilient to natural hazards and climate change, and to achieve a net-zero future.

<text>ESPN2 is an American multinational pay television network owned by ESPN Inc., a joint venture between the Walt Disney Company (which owns a controlling 80% stake) and Hearst Communications (which owns the remaining 20%).

ESPN2 was initially formatted as a younger-skewing counterpart to its parent network ESPN, with a focus on sports popular among young adult audiences (ranging from mainstream events to other unconventional sports), and carrying a more informal and youthful presentation than the main network. By the late 1990s, this mandate was phased out, as the channel increasingly became a second outlet for ESPN&#x27;s mainstream sports coverage.

, ESPN2 is available to approximately 70 million pay television households in the United States—down from its 2011 peak of 100 million households.

==History==
ESPN2 launched on October 1, 1993, at 7:30 p.m. ET. Its inaugural program was the premiere of &quot;SportsNight&quot;, a sports news program originally hosted by Keith Olbermann and Suzy Kolber; Olbermann opened the show and the channel by jokingly welcoming viewers to &quot;the end of our careers.&quot; Launching with an estimated carriage of about 10 million homes, and nicknamed &quot;The Deuce&quot;, ESPN2 aimed to be a more informal and youth-oriented channel than parent network ESPN. The youthful image was also reflected in its overall presentation, which featured a graffiti-themed logo and on-air graphics.

Its initial lineup featured studio programs such as &quot;SportsNight&quot;—which host Keith Olbermann characterized as a &quot;lighter&quot; parallel to ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot; that would still be &quot;comprehensive, thorough and extremely skeptical&quot;, &quot;Talk2&quot;—a nightly talk show hosted by Jim Rome that was billed as an equivalent to CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;Max Out&quot;—an extreme sports anthology series carried over from ESPN, and &quot;SportsSmash&quot;—a five-minute recap of sports headlines which aired every half-hour. ESPN2 also carried several half-hour, sport-specific studio programs under the &quot;2Night&quot; banner, such as &quot;NFL 2Night&quot;, &quot;NHL 2Night,&quot; and &quot;RPM 2Night&quot;. Event coverage would focus on coverage of mainstream sports popular within the 18–34 age demographic, such as auto racing, college basketball and NHL hockey (where, beginning in the 1993–94 season, it aired up to five games per week under the title &quot;NHL Fire on Ice&quot;), while also covering atypical sports such as BMX and other extreme sports.

ESPN2 would also be used to showcase new technology and experimental means of broadcasting events: on September 18, 1994, ESPN2 simulcast CART&#x27;s Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix using only onboard camera feeds. In 1995, ESPN2 introduced the &quot;BottomLine&quot;, a persistent news ticker which displayed sports news and scores. The BottomLine would later be adopted by ESPN itself and all of its future properties.

In the late 1990s, ESPN2 began to phase out its youth-oriented format, and transitioned to becoming a secondary outlet for ESPN&#x27;s mainstream sports programming; telecasts began to adopt a more conventional style, and the &quot;graffiti 2&quot; logo was dropped in 2001 in favor of a version of ESPN&#x27;s main logo. On-screen graphics (such as the BottomLine) used a blue color scheme instead of red to differentiate them from ESPN. Since February 12, 2007, the ESPN2 brand has been used for station identification only, with all programming using the same on-air presentation and ESPN branding as those on the main network.

==Programming==
Sports events presented on ESPN2 originally tended to be alternative sports such as poker, billiards, lumberjacking, extreme sports and, more recently, drum and bugle corps. However, in recent years ESPN2 has broadcast increasingly more mainstream sporting events, including Major League Baseball games, the East–West Shrine Game, much of the 2006 World Baseball Classic, many Major League Soccer games, NCAA football games, NCAA basketball games, the WNBA, the Arena Football League, regular-season KHL games, and Saturday-afternoon NASCAR Nationwide Series races. In 2011, ESPN2 also acquired broadcast rights to delayed coverage for some American Le Mans Series events, with series&#x27; major events airing on ABC. ESPN2 College Football Primetime is a live game presentation of college football on ESPN2. The channel airs the Canadian Football League playoffs, including the season-ending Grey Cup, simulcasting from their Canadian partner TSN.

The channel has also become ESPN&#x27;s home for tennis coverage. The showpieces are three of the &quot;Grand Slam&quot; tournaments: the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. U.S.-based tournaments, including the ATP Masters 1000 events at Indian Wells and Miami, as well as the US Open Series, were also previously broadcast on the channel.

Most of ESPN&#x27;s soccer output has been broadcast on ESPN2, including Major League Soccer, Premier League and La Liga matches; the channel also broadcast the United States&#x27; FIFA World Cup qualifiers in 2009. ESPN2 formerly broadcast matches of the UEFA Champions League, until rights for that tournament moved to Fox Soccer and its sister networks. In 2003, ESPN2 began broadcasting Major League Lacrosse games. In March 2007, ESPN2 and the league agreed on a new broadcast contract that ran until the 2016 season.

On October 4, 2017, ESPN announced that it had acquired rights to the Formula One World Championship; the majority of the races are carried by ESPN2.

The NHL returned to ESPN in the 2021–22 season; ESPN2 primarily serves as a secondary broadcaster during the Stanley Cup playoffs.

ESPN2&#x27;s former flagship show, the morning sports/entertainment program &quot;Cold Pizza&quot;, achieved minimal success and saw several format and host changes. In January 2006, it was supplanted by the television simulcast of ESPN Radio&#x27;s &quot;Mike and Mike in the Morning&quot; (which moved from ESPNews) and moved to a later time slot (10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time). In May 2007, &quot;Cold Pizza&quot; moved from New York City to the ESPN headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut and was renamed &quot;ESPN First Take&quot;. After ESPN became part of a new broadcast contract with the association, ESPN2 also premiered the new daily show &quot;NASCAR Now&quot; (similar to the previous &quot;RPM 2Night&quot;, except only focusing on NASCAR) in February 2007. &quot;Quite Frankly with Stephen A. Smith&quot;, a program that featured interviews with popular sports figures, had averaged extremely low ratings, and had also faced several timeslot changes, until it was finally canceled in January 2007.

On August 20, 2019, the ESPNews sports betting studio show &quot;Daily Wager&quot; (now &quot;ESPN Bet Live&quot;) was moved to ESPN2.

On August 8, 2018, ESPN2 stunted as &quot;ESPN8: The Ocho&quot;—an homage to a fictitious eighth ESPN channel portrayed in the 2004 film &quot;&quot;, dedicated to unconventional and obscure sporting events. The event—which also included airings of the original film— was a follow-up to a similar marathon aired by ESPNU the previous year.

===Simulcasting and alternative telecasts===
ESPN2 has also simulcast many game telecasts with ESPN, usually as a part of a &quot;Full Circle&quot; or &quot;Megacast&quot; broadcast, which covers a single event across ESPN platforms with different forms of coverage (such as different camera angles and features). ESPN2 also simulcasts some programming from ESPNews, often during local blackouts of scheduled national game telecasts, and for a while provided a simulcast of ESPN Deportes&#x27; edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; on Sundays. In return, ESPN2 programming is often seen on ESPN during blackouts of games in certain markets.

ESPN2 also often carries &quot;SportsCenter&quot; at times when the broadcast on ESPN is delayed by a sporting event that overruns into one of the program&#x27;s scheduled timeslots. ESPN and ESPN2 also jointly aired two episodes of a documentary special called &quot;This is SportsCenter&quot;, in which ESPN showed a documentary showing the production of an edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, while the finished product aired on ESPN2. The documentary would usually air for two hours, where the first hour would cover the preliminary production of the night&#x27;s show on ESPN, while ESPN2 aired ESPN&#x27;s regular programming. The second hour usually spent time at production control while covering reaction to the night&#x27;s developments.

On March 16, 2008, ESPN2 aired CBS-produced coverage of the SEC men&#x27;s basketball championship game in most of the country. A tornado had damaged the original game site, the Georgia Dome, causing the remainder of the tournament to be rescheduled and re-located to the smaller Alexander Memorial Coliseum. However, the new, later tip-off time for the SEC championship created a scheduling conflict with CBS&#x27;s coverage of the Big Ten championship game. As a result, CBS aired the SEC championship on its affiliates in the markets of the teams involved, while ESPN2 aired a simulcast of the game in the rest of the country.

ESPN2 has occasionally been used to carry simulcasts of ESPN Deportes&#x27; Spanish-language coverage of events, in an effort to promote the channel and improve the availability of the telecasts (as ESPN2 is available in a significantly larger number of homes than ESPN Deportes), while also reducing the need to counterprogram with lesser-viewed programs. Examples since 2016 have included NBA Christmas Day games, the 2017 World Baseball Classic (whose English rights were exclusively held by MLB Network), and an International Champions Cup game between Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. From the 2017 NFL season through 2020, ESPN2 simulcast ESPN Deportes&#x27; Spanish-language broadcasts of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; during the first nine weeks of the season, including its pre-game show &quot;NFL Esta Noche&quot;, and ESPN Latin America&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot; from Mexico City after the game. ESPN2 had largely scheduled filler programming against &quot;MNF&quot; until November, when it begins its Monday-night college basketball coverage. 

In the 2021 season, the Spanish simulcast of &quot;MNF&quot; was replaced with &quot;Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli&quot; (colloquially known as the &quot;Manningcast&quot;), which is hosted by Eli and Peyton Manning, and features appearances by other celebrity guests.

==High definition==
ESPN2 broadcasts in high definition in the 720p resolution format, which was launched in January 2005. In January 2011, the separate ESPN2HD branding began to be phased out, as in May of that year, the channel would shift to using the AFD #10 flag to transmit the channel&#x27;s standard-definition feed in letterboxed widescreen, mirroring the display of the high-definition feed, with the SD feed eventually phased out to allow downscaling of the HD feed for the standard-definition channel.
