<text>The New York Cosmos (simply the Cosmos in 1977–1978) were an American professional soccer club based in New York City and its suburbs. The team played home games in three stadiums around New York, including Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, before moving in 1977 to Giants Stadium in nearby East Rutherford, New Jersey, where the club remained for the rest of its history. 

Founded in December 1970, the team competed in the North American Soccer League (NASL) until 1984 and was the strongest franchise in that league, both competitively and financially – based largely around its backing by Warner Communications President Steve Ross, which enabled it to sign internationally famous stars of the day such as the Brazilian forward Pelé, Italian striker Giorgio Chinaglia, the West German sweeper Franz Beckenbauer, and famous Brazilian rightback Carlos Alberto Torres. The acquisition of these foreign players, particularly Pelé, made the Cosmos into what journalist Gavin Newsham called &quot;the most glamorous team in world football&quot;, and contributed to the development of soccer across the United States, a country where it had previously been largely ignored.

As the Cosmos declined following Pelé&#x27;s retirement, so did the NASL. Attendances fell, the league&#x27;s television deal was lost, and it finally folded in 1985 after playing its last season in 1984. The Cosmos attempted to continue operations in the Major Indoor Soccer League, but attendances were so low that the club withdrew without completing a season. The team attempted an independent schedule in 1985, but also canceled that because of low attendance, and the Cosmos folded. Former club employee Peppe Pinton assumed the trademarks and property of the club when it was dissolved, in part because nobody else thought they had any value at that point. Pinton put the trophies, uniforms, and equipment into storage and operated a New Jersey day camp for children under the name &quot;Cosmos Soccer Camp&quot;.

Attempts were made to revive the Cosmos name during the 1990s and 2000s, most notably as a Major League Soccer (MLS) club. Pinton refused to sell the name and image rights, believing that MLS would not honor the club&#x27;s heritage. Following the revival of several former NASL names in MLS, Pinton sold the rights for $2 million to an international, English-based consortium in August 2009. That group ultimately chose not to join MLS, and the new Cosmos team played parts of five seasons in second- and third-tier leagues before suspending operations.

==History==
===Creation and naming===

The club was founded in December 1970 by Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun, renowned executives at Atlantic Records, along with eight other executives from Atlantic&#x27;s parent company Warner Communications, including CEO Steve Ross, president Jay Emmett, and Warner Bros. studio head Ted Ashley, each of whom put up one-tenth of the $350,000 NASL expansion fee. After several months of mounting financial losses, Emmett convinced Ross that the company should take on the financial burden. The ten investors sold the club to their employer Warner Communications for one dollar, and Ross threw the conglomerate&#x27;s weight behind the Cosmos. Emmett later said of the move &quot;(the Cosmos) was an entertainment vehicle, (Warner) was an entertainment company.&quot; 

The team&#x27;s first recruit was the Englishman Clive Toye, a former sportswriter who had moved to the United States in 1967 to become general manager of the short-lived Baltimore Bays; he was given the same post in New York. Toye sought to convey the new team&#x27;s ambitions within its name, and reasoned that he could outdo the &quot;Metropolitans&quot; label referenced by the then-nine-year-old New York Mets baseball team by calling his team the &quot;Cosmos&quot;, shortened from &quot;Cosmopolitans&quot;. However, the owners preferred other possible names: the Erteguns wished to use the name originally suggested by Nesuhi, the &quot;New York Blues&quot;; and another part of the ownership group wanted to adopt the name &quot;New York Lovers&quot;. Toye then staged a rigged &quot;name the team&quot; contest, receiving 3,000 entries and selecting one that just happened to match his pre-determined winner. Two NYC teachers, Meyer Diller and Al Capelli, from Martin Van Buren High School in Queens, entered the contest and submitted the name &quot;Cosmos&quot;. The two physical education teachers had independently used Toye&#x27;s method of deriving it from &quot;cosmopolitan&quot;. The two men were awarded a trip to Europe as a prize. The team name was officially unveiled on February 4, 1971.

===North American Soccer League===
The New York Cosmos entered the 1968-founded North American Soccer League (NASL) in 1970 and made their field debut in the league&#x27;s fourth season in 1971. The first roster signing of the club was Gordon Bradley, an English professional who had moved to North America in 1963 and played for the New York Generals in 1968. He was made player-coach, a position he would hold until 1975. Bradley&#x27;s team finished second in its division in its first year, playing at Yankee Stadium, home of the New York Yankees baseball team and the New York Giants football team. Randy Horton, from Bermuda, was named the league&#x27;s Rookie of the Year after scoring 16 goals and 37 points, the most by any New York player. In 1972, the team moved to Hofstra Stadium where they won their first league title with a 2–1 victory over the St. Louis Stars. Horton was the league&#x27;s top scorer and Most Valuable Player, with 9 goals and 22 points from the 14 regular-season games and two post-season matches. The Cosmos reached the play-offs once more in 1973, but were knocked out at the semi-final stage. Bradley coached the United States national team for six games during 1973—picking himself in one, despite not being an American citizen—but lost them all. Before the 1974 season, the Cosmos moved again, settling at Downing Stadium on Randall&#x27;s Island. In their first year at their new base, they finished bottom of their division. Horton top scored for the Cosmos in every season before he was traded in 1975 to the Washington Diplomats.

====Arrival of Pelé, Giorgio Chinaglia and the Cosmos&#x27; peak====
It was during the 1975 season that the Cosmos acquired the Brazilian star Pelé, whom they had been attempting to sign since the team was created. Ross had apparently not heard of him before getting involved in soccer, but agreed to finance the transfer when Toye compared the Brazilian&#x27;s popularity to that of the Pope. Pelé joined the Cosmos on June 10, 1975, on a salary of $1.4 million per year, an enormous wage for an athlete at that time. A number of contracts—only one of which mentioned soccer—were set up for Pelé to ensure that he paid the lowest amount of tax possible, including one as a &quot;recording artist&quot; with Warner subsidiary Atlantic Records. &quot;We owned him lock, stock and barrel,&quot; Toye retrospectively boasted. They also signed Mike Dillon in 1975.
The Pelé deal was later described by Gavin Newsham, an English writer, as &quot;the transfer coup of the century&quot;. His arrival turned the Cosmos from a motley crew of foreigners, semi-professionals and students into a huge commercial presence. The club&#x27;s groundsman, on hearing that the Brazilian&#x27;s début for New York was to be broadcast on CBS, spray-painted the pitch green to disguise how little grass was on it: the match, against the Dallas Tornado, was broadcast to 22 countries and covered by more than 300 journalists from all over the world.

Although New York finished third at season end, it was still too low a placing to reach the post-season. Bradley was replaced for the 1976 season by another Englishman, Ken Furphy, who paired Pelé up front with Italian international forward Giorgio Chinaglia, a new arrival from S.S. Lazio. He had been so popular at Lazio that when his move to New York was announced, supporters &quot;threatened to throw themselves beneath the wheels of the plane&quot;. By contrast to most of the overseas stars bought by NASL teams, Chinaglia was signed in his prime. He played for the Cosmos for the rest of their history, scoring a record number of goals and points not only for the Cosmos, but for the entire league. He shared an unusual personal bond with the club&#x27;s ultimate controller, Ross, and was therefore treated differently from the other players, including Pelé.
Crowds rose with the arrival of these and other European and South American international players, resulting in a move back to Yankee Stadium for the 1976 season. With numerous foreign stars arriving at the Cosmos, the team&#x27;s competitive performance improved, as New York reached the play-offs at the end of the season, but lost in the divisional championship match to the Tampa Bay Rowdies. The Cosmos relocated again before the 1977 season, to the newly constructed Giants Stadium in New Jersey, and at the same time dropped the prefix &quot;New York&quot; and played simply as &quot;the Cosmos&quot;, without a geographical name. The city name was restored in 1979.

Bradley returned as coach for the 1977 season in place of the dismissed Furphy, but was removed after half of the season to become the club&#x27;s vice-president of player personnel. South African-born former Italy international Eddie Firmani took his place. Pelé played his last professional match on October 1, 1977, in front of a capacity crowd at Giants Stadium: in an exhibition match between New York and his former club Santos, Pelé appeared for both sides, playing one half for each. The Cosmos won the game 2–1. Pelé&#x27;s compatriot, former Brazil captain Carlos Alberto was signed in 1977, at the same time as Franz Beckenbauer, who had captained the 1974 FIFA World Cup-winning West Germany national team. On the field, New York won three out of four championships, in 1977, 1978 and 1980. A playoff game against the Fort Lauderdale Strikers in 1977 drew a crowd of 77,691, a record for American club soccer. The team&#x27;s average attendances, regularly over 40,000 during the late 1970s, were the biggest in the league; this helped it to become regarded as the league&#x27;s &quot;marquee club&quot;, both commercially and competitively. Firmani was fired in 1979; he claimed, after falling out with Chinaglia. His assistant, Ray Klivecka, replaced him, becoming the team&#x27;s first American-born coach. He lasted a season before himself being replaced by Júlio Mazzei.

On Pelé&#x27;s farewell tour in 1977, the Cosmos made history by becoming the first Western professional sports team to play in China. They drew their opening match with the Chinese national team 1-1, and lost the second game 2-1 despite Pelé scoring a free kick.

====Decline of the Cosmos and the NASL====
After the retirement of Pelé in 1977, much of the progress that American soccer had made during his stay was lost; there was no star at the same level to replace him as the NASL&#x27;s headline act. After enduring briefly during the late 1970s, attendances dropped after 1980. The sport&#x27;s popularity fell and the media lost interest. The deal with broadcaster ABC to broadcast NASL matches was also lost in 1980, and the 1981 Soccer Bowl was only shown on tape delay. All of the franchises quickly became unprofitable, and a salary cap enforced before the 1984 season only delayed the inevitable. The league folded at the end of 1984, following the loss of most of its franchises.

The Cosmos had financial problems of their own, on top of those affecting the league in general. Much of the Cosmos&#x27; ability to attract the well-known overseas players it had acquired was due to the financial resources of parent company Warner Communications. In the early 1980s, Warner was the target of a hostile takeover bid by Australian media magnate Rupert Murdoch; although this attempt did not succeed, Warner sold off several of its assets, among them Atari and Global Soccer, Inc., the subsidiary that operated the Cosmos. Chinaglia bought Global Soccer, and thus controlled the team. His group did not have the capital necessary to keep all of the players signed on expensive contracts by Warner, which resulted in many of the stars being sold. The club won its last title in 1982, and by the last season of the NASL, 1984, had missed the play-offs for the first time since 1975. The precipitous decline of the Cosmos after the 1983 season became for many fans and the media proof positive of the grave condition of the whole NASL.

===Major Indoor Soccer League, demise and youth soccer===
Following the collapse of the NASL, the team competed in the Major Indoor Soccer League during the 1984–85 season, with Klivecka briefly returning as coach, but withdrew after 33 games due to low attendance. The organization tried to operate as an independent team in 1985, but could not finish a single season and the club finally folded.

Former club employee Peppe Pinton, who started with the Cosmos as Giorgio Chinaglia&#x27;s personal assistant and was promoted to General Manager when Chinaglia assumed control, ended up with the club&#x27;s assets largely because he was the only one at the time who felt they had any value. Pinton put the trophies, uniforms, and equipment into storage and took over the club&#x27;s day camp for children at Ramapo College in Mahwah, New Jersey changing the name from &quot;Pele Soccer Camps&quot; to &quot;Cosmos Soccer Camp&quot;.

===New Cosmos team===
Since the original New York Cosmos club&#x27;s demise in 1985, there had been attempts to revive it. With the rise of Major League Soccer (MLS), various New York area entities—including two different ownership groups from the Metrostars/New York Red Bulls—lobbied Pinton for the acquisition of the Cosmos name. Pinton refused to sell to an MLS team, believing that the league would not acknowledge the Cosmos&#x27; legacy. However, when old NASL names such as the San Jose Earthquakes, Seattle Sounders, Portland Timbers and Vancouver Whitecaps were revived as MLS franchises, he reconsidered. He sold the Cosmos name and brand to English businessman Paul Kemsley in 2009, whose group announced a new team with the Cosmos&#x27; name in August 2010. 

Kemsley put the original club&#x27;s trophies on display in the new club&#x27;s office in SoHo. He and the other owners initially intended to become an MLS expansion franchise, but ultimately turned down the invitation to apply. Kemsley&#x27;s team instead joined the new second-tier incarnation of the North American Soccer League, starting play in its 2013 Fall season. It played for the next four seasons before the league folded. The Cosmos then joined the third-tier National Independent Soccer Association (NISA), but played only half a season before going on hiatus.

==Cultural impact and influence on U.S. soccer==

When Pelé arrived at the Cosmos in 1975, American soccer was, in Newsham&#x27;s phrase, &quot;dying a slow, painful and largely unnoticed death&quot;. The sport was not taken seriously by the bulk of the American media, and was of little interest to the public. Matches were often played in front of almost-empty stands, receiving modest press coverage. The signing of Pelé by the Cosmos transformed soccer across the country almost immediately, lending credibility not only to the Cosmos, but also to the NASL and soccer in general. Within days of the Brazilian&#x27;s arrival, the increased media attention had caused the Cosmos&#x27; office staff to increase from five people to more than 50. Soccer became seen as a viable alternative to more traditional &quot;American&quot; sports such as basketball, baseball and American football. The Cosmos, in particular, became an internationally famous club – &quot;the most glamorous team in world football&quot;, in Newsham&#x27;s words, or &quot;soccer demigods&quot; in those of ESPN writer David Hirshey.

The Cosmos, as the flagship team of the NASL, embodied what Hirshey labeled the &quot;nexus of soccer and showbiz&quot;, and became Warner Communications&#x27; most culturally visible asset. After Pelé signed for New York, many other European and South American stars joined NASL teams; the Los Angeles Aztecs, for example, signed George Best and Johan Cruyff in 1976 and 1979 respectively. Cosmos road trips, described by traveling secretary Steve Marshall as &quot;like traveling with the Rolling Stones&quot;, saw the team pack out each stadium it visited, while at home, the team attracted numerous high-profile supporters. While soccer had previously been largely ignored by the American press, the Cosmos and other NASL teams now became regular fixtures on the back pages.

However, just as Pelé had kick-started the development of soccer in the U.S., his retirement in 1977 would mark the start of a decline. With nobody of the same stature to personify the sport, the popularity that had been built up nosedived just as quickly as it had appeared. The league&#x27;s television deal with ABC was lost at the end of 1980 and a salary cap, enforced before the 1984 season, caused many of the remaining overseas stars—lured to America by fat pay packets—to return to the European and South American leagues. The NASL collapsed abruptly in late 1984, and was not replaced by a new professional soccer league until Major League Soccer&#x27;s first season in 1996.

A feature-length documentary about the Cosmos, called &quot;Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos&quot;, was released in theaters in 2006. The film, narrated by Matt Dillon, featured interviews with many of the players and personalities involved with the team.

==Uniforms and crest==
For the team&#x27;s initial uniform Cosmos general manager Clive Toye chose the green and yellow of the Brazil national team as part of his strategy to lure Pelé, one of that country&#x27;s star players, to the United States. The club&#x27;s initial uniform was all green with yellow trim, with the colors reversed on the road uniform. Coincidentally, the colors were the same as those of the previous New York NASL team, the New York Generals, which had folded after the 1968 season. When Pelé did come on board in 1975, the uniform was changed to all-white in imitation of his club in Brazil, Santos FC. The green and yellow elements were relegated to the trim. The green shirt was concurrently matched with white shorts to become the new away uniform. Uniforms designed by Ralph Lauren were used from 1979 to the end; the home uniform remained all-white, though with navy and yellow trim replacing the green and white trim of the previous outfit. The away uniform became navy shirts and shorts with yellow trim, paired with unusual yellow-and-navy hooped socks, which were later replaced with plain navy blue ones.

The artist commissioned by Toye to design the team&#x27;s logo was Wayland Moore, a sports artist from Atlanta who had already worked on the logo, uniform and program covers of that city&#x27;s soccer team, the Chiefs. Moore attempted to create a design that was simple, recognizable and inclusive of New York&#x27;s many nationalities. The three colored &quot;blades&quot; surrounding the soccer ball in the center represent movement, while the font originally used was chosen simply because it was easily legible on the uniform. The text on the logo was shortened to &quot;Cosmos&quot; in 1977, concurrently with the team&#x27;s dropping of the &quot;New York&quot; label. The city name was restored two years later, but the badge remained unchanged.

===Theme song===

Ahmet Ertegun used his connections to recruit Atlantic Records artists the Average White Band to create a theme song for the Cosmos. The resulting &quot;The Cosmos Theme&quot; was written by band members Alan Gorrie and Steve Ferrone, and recorded by the band under the pseudonym &quot;The Cosmic Highlanders&quot;.

Team management originally wanted to use &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; by Queen as the club&#x27;s theme, but were convinced to use The Cosmos Theme in part by the cheerleaders, who enjoyed dancing to it.

The Cosmos Theme was played extensively at Giants Stadium, and on television broadcasts of Cosmos games.

==Stadiums==
The Cosmos&#x27; first home stadium was Yankee Stadium, home to both the New York Yankees baseball team and the New York Giants football team, where they played throughout the 1971 season. Attendances during the club&#x27;s first year averaged at 4,517, less than 7% of the stadium&#x27;s capacity, which was at that time 65,010. The Cosmos therefore moved before the 1972 season to the 15,000-seater Hofstra Stadium, on the campus of the namesake university east of metropolitan New York. After two seasons of continuing low crowds at this out-of-town location, the Cosmos moved again, relocating to the 22,500-capacity Downing Stadium before the 1974 season. It was at Downing Stadium that attendances started to rise significantly, buoyed by the arrival of stars such as Pelé, who arrived in 1975. For the Brazilian&#x27;s first match, the stadium was full; &quot;there must have been another 50,000 turned away&quot;, coach Gordon Bradley later claimed.

These larger attendances necessitated another move, which occurred in 1976, when the Cosmos returned to Yankee Stadium. This time the team averaged 18,227 fans over the course of the season, over four times the average 1971 gate. The team then moved yet again before the 1977 season, to the newly built Giants Stadium, where attendances skyrocketed; crowds peaked at an average of 47,856 during 1978. The Cosmos remained at Giants Stadium for the rest of their time in the NASL. Attendances gradually fell as the league declined during the early 1980s, then finally slumped in 1984, when they dropped by more than half from the 1983 seasonal average.

The largest crowd to attend a Cosmos home game was set in 1977, when the Fort Lauderdale Strikers visited for a playoff match. The game was attended by 77,691 fans, which, at the time, was a record for American soccer. The lowest average attendance for a season was 3,578, in 1974. As of 2011, only Hofstra Stadium remains, now renamed James M. Shuart Stadium. Downing Stadium, the original Yankee Stadium and Giants Stadium were demolished in 2002, 2008 and 2010 respectively.

While playing indoor soccer, the Cosmos&#x27; home arenas were the Brendan Byrne Arena (now the Meadowlands Arena) and Madison Square Garden.

==Supporters==
The Cosmos sought to maximize their fanbase by appealing to as wide a demographic as possible. The club&#x27;s name and badge were designed to be inclusive of New York&#x27;s many immigrant communities; the logo purposefully avoided the standard American red, white and blue. In this the Cosmos succeeded, attracting noticeable support from local Europeans, Middle-Easterners and South Americans. The association of the team with the city&#x27;s high society in both social and sporting contexts led to it becoming very popular among celebrities, both American and international. &quot;We transcended everything, every culture, every socio-economic boundary,&quot; goalkeeper Shep Messing said in 2006. &quot;We were international, we were European, we were cool, we were Americans from the Bronx. We were everything to everybody.&quot;

==Players==
The New York Cosmos are famous for having fielded numerous well-known players, almost all of whom were from outside the United States: examples include Pelé, Franz Beckenbauer, Giorgio Chinaglia from S.S. Lazio and Carlos Alberto. American players of note include goalkeeper Shep Messing – who was notoriously sold after posing nude for a magazine in December 1974, then brought back two years later on Pelé&#x27;s insistence. The Cosmos also fielded Werner Roth, a Yugoslavian-born U.S. international defender, from 1972 to 1979. A number of Cosmos players were named in the NASL all-star teams selected by the league at the end of each season. No NASL all-star from the Cosmos was born in the United States or Canada, where all of the league&#x27;s teams were based; apart from Roth, both North Americans selected—Siegfried Stritzl and John Kerr—were born in Yugoslavia and Scotland respectively.

==Club captains==
==Head coaches==
The New York Cosmos&#x27; first head coach was the English-American professional Gordon Bradley, who had played in the English Football League&#x27;s lower divisions during the 1950s before moving to America in 1963. Bradley came out of retirement to become player-coach, a role he retained until his departure in 1975. Bradley&#x27;s team won the league championship in 1972, but after it failed to reach the playoffs in both 1974 and 1975, he was dismissed. His replacement was another Englishman, Ken Furphy. His Cosmos succeeded in reaching the post-season, but lost the divisional championship game to Vancouver, prompting Furphy&#x27;s own departure in favor of a return for Bradley, whose second spell lasted only half a season before he was promoted to an advisory role. Eddie Firmani, the South African-born former Italy forward, took over midway through the 1977 season. His star-studded team won two consecutive Soccer Bowls—1977 and 1978—but lost the National Conference championship game in 1979. Firmani lost his job after falling out with Giorgio Chinaglia, a favorite of the Cosmos hierarchy. His assistant, Ray Klivecka, who was born in Lithuania, became the team&#x27;s first American head coach when he took Firmani&#x27;s place midway through 1979.

Klivecka was replaced before the 1980 season by Brazilian coach Júlio Mazzei, who won the Cosmos&#x27; fourth title at the end of that campaign before being succeeded by two joint head coaches, Hennes Weisweiler &amp; Yasin Özdenak, in 1980. This duo&#x27;s team came second in the 1981 NASL before Mazzei returned in 1982 and won his second championship with the Cosmos during that year. Firmani returned in 1984, the NASL&#x27;s final year, in which the Cosmos failed to make the playoffs. Firmani remained as the team entered the Major Indoor Soccer League for the 1984–85 season, but was fired in early December, halfway through the season, and replaced by Klivecka, who returned after two games under the caretaker management of goalkeeper Hubert Birkenmeier. Klivecka was retained until the team ceased competitive play.

==Honors==

With five championships and seven first-place finishes, the Cosmos still rank as tied for the most successful franchise in the history of North American soccer.

<text>Laugharne () is a town on the south coast of Carmarthenshire, Wales, lying on the estuary of the River Tâf.

The ancient borough of Laugharne Township () with its Corporation and Charter is a unique survival in Wales. In a predominantly English-speaking area, just on the Landsker Line, the community is bordered by those of Llanddowror, St Clears, Llangynog and Llansteffan. It had a population at the 2021 census of 1,100. 

Laugharne Township electoral ward also includes the communities of Eglwyscummin, Pendine and Llanddowror.

Dylan Thomas, who lived in Laugharne from 1949 until his death in 1953, famously described it as a &quot;timeless, mild, beguiling island of a town&quot;. It is generally accepted as the inspiration for the fictional town of Llareggub in &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. Thomas confirmed on two occasions that his play was based on Laugharne although topographically it is also similar to New Quay where he briefly lived.

==History==
 
Throughout much of the Prehistoric period, human activity in the Laugharne area was centred on Coygan Bluff, a steep-sided limestone peninsula overlooking the now submerged coastal plain to the south. A natural cave on the southeast face of the promontory was excavated five times between 1865 and 1965 yielding significant evidence that its chambers acted as a temporary shelter for groups of hunter-gatherers moving through the landscape over 50,000 years ago and later material in the form of flint tools indicating an extended series of occupations from the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. These discoveries suggest that the Township is probably the oldest still-inhabited settlement in Wales. Contemporary artefacts from the Mousterian period have also been found at nearby Paviland and Long Hole caves along with older hominin remains at Bontnewydd but, unlike at Laugharne, the communities associated with them are long vanished.

In the 4th century BC, a promontory fort was built at the summit of the hill. During the Bronze Age, Coygan camp is recorded as the site of an open settlement with funerary and ritual activity shown by a short-cist contracted inhumation. Further finds at a nearby round barrow on Laugharne Burrows together with Beaker burials at Plashett and Orchard Park confirm a more permanent community. Excavation in the 1960s of the defended enclosure on Coygan revealed two huts contemporary with the defensive bank and ditch and a significant quantity of pottery recovered dating to the late 3rd century AD indicating that the site was occupied deep into the Romano-British period. Another significant Iron Age settlement has also been identified at Glan-y-Mor Fort in the north of the township.

The Laugharne hoard of over 2000 coins and Roman bath remains found at Island House, together with the substantial Romano-British group of imported 6th-century finewares, coinage and glass from Coygan Camp, described as &quot;one of the richest from a native settlement in south-west Wales&quot;, are all part of a concentration of traditional &#x27;Roman&#x27; finds in the area. As evidence of activity from the period is generally scarce, these discoveries confirm the site as one of importance and suggest that it continued to be a high status settlement well beyond the Roman occupation. A 6th-century inscribed stone lies within Llansadwrnen church to the north, considered to be an outlying burial site of the more important secular settlement on Coygan. Laugharne Church, which contains a 9th-century Celtic slab stone and where a long cist grave cemetery has also been recorded, is thought to be a more likely early ecclesiastical site in the immediate area.

In the Early Middle Ages Laugharne was the main settlement in the area and home to the Lords of Laugharne. It was a commote of Gwarthaf, the largest of the seven &quot;cantrefi&quot; of the Kingdom of Dyfed in southwest Wales, later to be ruled by the Princes of Deheuberth. In 1093, Deheubarth was seized by the Normans following Rhys ap Tewdwr&#x27;s death. In the early 12th century, grants of lands were made to Flemings by King Henry I when their country was flooded. In 1116, when Gruffydd ap Rhys (the son and heir of Rhys ap Tewdwr) returned from self-imposed exile, the king arranged for the land to be fortified against him; according to the &quot;Brut y Tywysogyon&quot;, Robert Courtemain constructed a castle at Laugharne in that year (this is the earliest reference to any castle at or near Laugharne). Courtemain may be the &quot;Robertus cum tortis manibus&quot; () mentioned in the Book of Llandaff, as one of a number of specifically named Norman magnates within the vicinity of the Llandaff diocese, who received a letter from Pope Callixtus II complaining about deprivations they had inflicted on diocesan church property; in the letter, the Pope warns he would confirm Bishop Urban&#x27;s proclamations against them, if they do not rectify matters. The &quot;Brut&quot; states that Courtemain appointed a man named Bleddyn ap Cedifor as castellan; Bleddyn was the son of Cedifor ap Gollwyn, descendant and heir of the earlier kings of Dyfed (as opposed to those of Deheubarth). The castle was originally known as Abercorran Castle. When Henry I died, Anarchy occurred, and Gruffydd, and his sons, Lord Rhys in particular, gradually reconquered large parts of the former Deheubarth.

In 1154, the Anarchy was resolved when Henry II became king; two years later, Lord Rhys agreed peace terms with Henry II and prudently accepted that he would only rule Cantref Mawr, constructing Dinefwr Castle there. Henry II de-mobilised Flemish soldiers who had aided him during the Anarchy, settling them with the other Flemings.
From time to time, however, King Henry had occasion to go to Ireland, or Normandy, which Lord Rhys took as an opportunity to try and expand his own holdings. Returning from Ireland after one such occasion, in 1172, King Henry made peace with Lord Rhys, making him the justiciar of &quot;South Wales&quot; (ie. Deheubarth). By 1247, Laugharne was held by Guy de Bryan; this is the earliest reference to his family possessing the castle, and his father (also named Guy de Bryan) had only moved the family to Wales in 1219 (from Devon). Guy de Bryan&#x27;s descendants continued to hold the castle; his namesake great-grandson was Lord High Admiral of England. The latter&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth inherited the castle and married an Owen of St Bride&#x27;s who subsequently took his name – Owen Laugharne – from the castle despite Gerald of Wales calling the castle &quot;Talachar&quot;, and other variations on Laugharne/Talacharn appearing in ancient charters; one anonymous pre-20th-century writer erroneously claimed that Owen Laugharne gave his name to the castle rather than the other way around. Possession subsequently defaulted to the Crown, and in 1575, Queen Elizabeth granted it to Sir John Perrot. In 1644 the castle was garrisoned for the king and taken for Parliament by Major-General Rowland Laugharne, who subsequently reverted to the king&#x27;s side. The population in 1841 was 1,389.

===Laugharne Corporation===

Laugharne Corporation is an almost unique institution and, together with the City of London Corporation, the last surviving mediæval corporation in the United Kingdom. The Corporation was established in 1291 by Sir Guy de Brian (&quot;&quot;), a Marcher Lord. Laugharne Corporation holds extensive historical records.
The Corporation is presided over by the portreeve, wearing his traditional chain of gold cockle shells (one added by each portreeve, with his name and date of tenure on the reverse), the aldermen, and the body of burgesses. The title of portreeve is conferred annually, with the portreeve being sworn in on the first Monday after Michaelmas at the Big Court. The Corporation holds a court leet half-yearly formerly dealing with criminal cases, and a court baron every fortnight, dealing with civil suits within the lordship, especially in matters related to land, where administration of the common fields was dealt with. The Laugharne open-field system is one of only two surviving and still in use today in Britain.

&#x27;In Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, the lordship passed to Sir John Perrott of Haroldston, a fact for which the inhabitants of Laugharne have had cause to regret. As at Carew Perrot modernised the castle, but he was the most unscrupulous &quot;land-grabber&quot; of his age, and in 1574 he induced the burgesses to part with three hundred acres of land in return for an annuity of £9 6s. 8d. The records say that &quot;diverse burgesses of the said towne did not assent to same&quot;, and that it was &quot;to the great decaying of many&quot;. It would be interesting to know by what methods of bribery or intimidation Sir John was able to accomplish his nefarious purposes.&#x27;
The most senior 76 burgesses get a strang of land on Hugden for life, to be used in a form of mediæval strip-farming.

The chief toast at the Portreeve&#x27;s feast is &quot;to the immortal memory of Sir Guido de Brian&quot;; then the Recorder must sing the following song:
==Governance==
Since 1972, Laugharne Township Community Council has formed the lowest tier of local government for the town, represented by 11 community councillors.

For elections to Carmarthenshire County Council, Laugharne is covered by the Laugharne Township electoral ward, which also covers three neighbouring communities. The ward is represented by one county councillor. Independent councillor Jane Tremlett has represented the ward since 2004.

== St Martin&#x27;s Church ==

The parish church of St Martin was built in the 14th century by Guido de Brian, lord of the manor of Laugharne. The original dedication was to St Michael as 15th-century records use this dedication. The churchyard, rectangular in shape, has shown evidence of Cist burials. Various archaeological finds have been made during grave-digging: a wheel-topped stone; a medieval tile and a fragment of what is believed to be a tomb canopy. The churchyard&#x27;s 18th- and 19th-century monuments are Grade II listed for their group value.

The interior has a cross-slab, probably dating from the 9th or 10th century, with a carved Celtic design carved onto it. It has been suggested that the design is of Viking origin.

The church is today part of the United Benefice of Bro Sancler. Welsh poet and playwright Dylan Thomas is buried in the churchyard, his grave marked by a white cross.

==Landmarks==

Local attractions include the 12th-century Laugharne Castle, Laugharne Town Hall and the estuary birdlife.

Laugharne Township currently has 69 listed buildings and contains several fine examples of Georgian townhouses including The Great House and Castle House together with Island House, parts of which date back to the Tudor period. All three properties are grade II* listed and a number of other early vernacular cottages have also survived.

There are a number of landmarks in Laugharne connected with the poet and writer Dylan Thomas. These include the Dylan Thomas Boathouse, where he lived with his family from 1949 to 1953, and now a museum; his writing shed; and the Dylan Thomas Birthday Walk, which was the setting for the work &quot;Poem in October&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Many scenes in the BBC Television series &quot;Keeping Faith&quot; (broadcast in Welsh as ) were filmed in and around Laugharne, referred to as &quot;Abercorran&quot;.

==Laugharne weekend==
The Laugharne Weekend, a three-day arts festival held in the spring of 2007, featured writers such as Niall Griffiths and Patrick McCabe. Headline performers since then have included Ray Davies, Will Self, Howard Marks and Patti Smith. The Millennium Hall is the main venue and smaller events are held locally such as in the Dylan Thomas Boathouse.

<text>Yellowhead is a federal electoral district in Alberta, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1979. The district is in west-central Alberta and represents: parts of the Municipal District of Greenview No. 16 including Grande Cache, Improvement District No. 25 (Willmore), the Improvement District No. 12 (Jasper), the Municipality of Jasper, Yellowhead County including Hinton and Edson, Brazeau County including Drayton Valley, Lac Ste. Anne County including Alexis 133, Parkland County, Leduc County, Clearwater County including Big Horn 144A, Sunchild 202, and O&#x27;Chiese 203, and Rocky Mountain House.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 1976 from Rocky Mountain, Athabasca, Edmonton West, Pembina, and Wetaskiwin ridings.

Its first and most high-profile MP was Joe Clark. Clark was Prime Minister of Canada in late 1979 and early 1980. He remained a prominent figure on the Progressive Conservative front bench after losing the premiership, in opposition and as a cabinet minister under Brian Mulroney.

This riding lost territory to Peace River—Westlock and Sturgeon River—Parkland, while gaining territory from Wetaskiwin and Wild Rose, during the 2012 Canadian federal electoral redistribution.

Following the 2012 redistribution, portions of this electoral district (notably the town of Whitecourt) joined the newly formed riding of Peace River—Westlock while the regions of Leduc County and Rocky Mountain House were added to Yellowhead.

<doc id="636676" wikidata="Q2330789" url="?curid=636676" title="Llantrisant">
<text>Llantrisant (; &quot;Parish of the Three Saints&quot;) is a town and community in the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales. It lies within the historic county boundaries of Glamorgan, on the River Ely and the Afon Clun. The three saints of the town&#x27;s name are Illtyd, Gwynno, and Dyfodwg. Llantrisant is a hilltop settlement, at an altitude of above sea level. The town is home to the Royal Mint.

==History==
There is evidence for settlements in and around Llantrisant stretching back over three millennia. Two Bronze Age burial mounds are on Mynydd Garthmaelwg, the opposite side of the Ely Valley. A tall, by wide, possibly Bronze Age, standing stone, was discovered in Miskin during excavations prior to the M4 motorway construction. An Iron Age hillfort stands on Rhiwsaeson Hill. The enclosure, now known as Caerau Hillfort, measures by .

A settlement has existed on this site from at least the beginning of the 6th century, when the poet Aneurin wrote of &quot;the white houses of Glamorgan&quot; when referring to Llantrisant. It was seized around 1246 by Richard de Clare, who built Llantrisant Castle. It is thought that de Clare established the borough of Llantrisant.

In 1346, Llantrisant was granted a royal charter months before the archers from the town helped Edward the Black Prince win a victory against the French army at the Battle of Crécy. The Llantrisant longbow men were pivotal in the adoption of the English longbow as the missile weapon of choice for the English crown during the Middle Ages.

Llantrisant was one of the eight boroughs constituting the Glamorgan borough following the Act of Union, a status it held until 1918.

==Culture==
The ancient tradition of beating the bounds, where local children are bounced by elders on to the boundary stones of the old borough, still occurs every seven years and dates as far back as the 14th century. The rite was intended as a reminder to each generation of the importance of the borough boundaries. The children are held under the arms and the legs, and their backsides are bounced on each of the stones of the old borough. It is believed that the Beating of the Bounds started in 1346, when Llantrisant was awarded its royal charter. This allowed people the freedom to trade without paying tolls within the boundaries of the former borough. The last occasion of this event was in June 2017, and the event is now seen as a purely historic tradition and social community event.

At nearby Tarren Deusant is a spring with unusual petrosomatoglyph carvings of the faces of two saints (1696), but now six are present (Sharp 1979).

The Old Town of Llantrisant has four pubs: the New Inn, the Bear, the Wheatsheaf and the Cross Keys Hotel. Formerly in the Bull Ring was the Rock and Fountain pub, which became the home of the original Llantrisant Workingmen&#x27;s Club, founded in May 1953 by Seth Morgan, Freeman of Llantrisant.

==Notable buildings==
The focal point of the town is the Bull Ring, a commercial square in the centre of the town that was used for bull-baiting, until it was disallowed in 1827 due to unruly crowds. The square contains a statue of Dr William Price a pioneer of cremation.

===Model House===
The first workhouse in Glamorgan opened in Llantrisant in May 1784, using a number of adapted cottages on Swan Street and part of the Black Cock pub on Yr Allt, a road to the south west of the Bull Ring, between the parish church (to the west) and the castle (to the east).

The Union Workhouse was built in 1884 on the Bull Ring – west of where Dr Price&#x27;s statue stands today and behind the town pump. It became known as The Model House, in the rather optimistic belief that its inmates would lead a life of model Christianity. Two pubs, a shop and a cottage were demolished to make way for the expansion of the workhouse.

The building closed as a workhouse in the early 1900s and first became a boarding house, then an inn and later a general store, called County Stores. They were known as a cornflour and provisions merchant, and a linen and woolen drapers, also selling boots and shoes. The site was bought in the 1950s by &#x27;Planet Gloves&#x27;, who manufactured gloves there until the late 1960s. The Model House stood empty for many years before being bought by the local authority to convert into a craft and design centre.

In 1989 the Model House re-opened as a craft and design centre. A registered charity, Model House was funded by the Arts Council of Wales since the demise of the Arts Council of Great Britain in 1994, receiving about 35,000 visitors a year. The ground floor contains galleries that include glass, ceramics and designer jewellery from established British and Welsh artists, as well as a local painter. The upper floors have workshops that are used by individual craftspeople, whose work can be purchased either from their studio or from the ground floor shop.
The Model House has a programme of art and crafts exhibitions throughout the year and hosts a varied series of workshops, where adults and children may learn the basics of a wide range of contemporary craft skills.

The centre closed in December 2009 after the company which ran it, Model House Ltd, went into liquidation. The management of the building was taken over by Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council, who after tackling structural problems with the roof and outer walls reopened the centre in mid 2010.

===Llantrisant Castle===

Llantrisant Castle stands in parkland in the centre of the town though only one wall of the raven tower remains. Although initially built as a wooden fortification it was rebuilt as a stone structure around 1246 by Richard de Clare, Lord of Glamorgan. In 1294 the castle was damaged during the uprising against the Norman overlords, led by Madog ap Llywelyn, and again in 1316 by Llywelyn Bren. It is believed that the castle was destroyed in 1404 by Owain Glyndŵr though there is no written proof of the event. John Leland reported the castle as ruined in his writings in 1536.

===Llantrisant Guildhall===

Llantrisant Guildhall, which was the meeting place of the borough council, was completed in 1773.

===Llantrisant Parish Church and Penuel Chapel===

By the early 1900s Llantrisant had eight chapels, as well as the Llantrisant Parish Church Only two religious buildings remain. The elder is the church of &#x27;y tri sant&#x27;. The three saints to which the church is dedicated are St. Illtyd, St. Gwynno and St. Dyfodwg. The site is believed to have been a place of Christian worship since at least the 7th century, and in 1096 the parish church was built and dedicated. The church was rebuilt by Richard de Clare in 1246 in the Norman style and in the 15th century the tower was added. Its interior houses an effigy of a 13th-century warrior, believed to be Cadwgan, lord of Miskin, a valuable Welsh church monument. The interior was restored in 1874 by Welsh neo-gothic designer John Prichard. The former parish office built 1873 on George Street is now a private home.

The second religious building in Llantrisant is Tabor Baptist Chapel, built in 1828. It is in on an elevated site next to Llantrisant Castle, accessed by steps from the High Street.

===Y Billy Wynt===
At the highest point of Y Graig is a stone tower known locally as “Billy Wynt”. Also said to have been used as an auxiliary tower with its high up positioning it remains a focal point of history. By the early 19th century the tower was in ruins and in 1890 it was restored as a folly by the Llantrisants&#x27; town trust.

===Y Pwysty===
‘Y Pwysty’ the weighing house, was located on this site since medieval times. Once known as The Angel Inn, it was at Y Pwysty that the weight of goods were regulated at the markets and fairs held in the town.

=== The Royal Mint ===
The Royal Mint, which produces all British coins, moved from London to Llantrisant in 1967 in order to meet demand when the UK converted to decimal currency. In addition to British coins, the Royal Mint produces circulating coins for approximately 60 countries, as well as medals, bullion coins and bars. The Royal Mint also attracts tourists to Llantrisant to The Royal Mint Experience and the Royal Mint Museum which runs events and exhibitions around topics of interest.

==Environment==
Llantrisant is typical of most locations in the South Wales region, being home to typical upland habitat birds and mammals of the British Isles. The town also contains Llantrisant Common and Pastures, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, which is home to several rare plants.

==Transport==
Llantrisant is served by Pontyclun railway station three miles away, which was formerly known as &quot;Llantrisant railway station&quot;. Trains run by Transport for Wales call at the station.

==Employment and economy==
The town is the home of the Royal Mint, which manufactures all British coins. The Royal Mint transferred to Llantrisant in 1967 and its attractions include the Mint&#x27;s museum. The Mint employs around 900 people. A number of small, independent retailers have successfully found a home in Llantrisant Old Town. In addition to the Model House Craft &amp; Design Centre, now well-established in a former 18th-century workhouse in the town centre, there is a village shop known as the Bullring Stores, a traditional toy shop with added vintage finds, galleries, pubs and restaurants. 

The history of education in Llantrisant is firmly based in the varied religious institutions and Sunday School services which rapidly flourished between the 17th and 19th centuries. The Norman parish church was the starting point for the education movement, although it was one that would take a century or more to fully develop into a successful entity.

==Sport and leisure==
Sport flourished in Llantrisant for centuries and the remains of a Welsh Handball court dating from the 1790s, stands at the rear of the Workingmen&#x27;s Club. Llantrisant is also known as the home of Llantrisant Rugby Union Club known locally as the &quot;Black Army&quot;.

===Llantrisant Male Choir===
The town is home to one of the very longest established male choirs in Wales. Established at least as early as 1898, the choir is a prolific touring choir having sung in the USA, Italy, Cyprus, Slovakia, Poland, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain. They travel extensively in the UK supporting charity events and singing at concert engagements. The choir has appeared at many notable venues, including The Royal Albert Hall, The Santa Maria Maggiore, Wales Millennium Centre and the Hollywood Bowl. The choir has a wide-ranging membership drawn from all ages and social backgrounds. They sing a mix of music from traditional choral classics, Welsh hymns and modern pop music.

<text>The Memphis Rogues were a professional soccer team in the former North American Soccer League. They operated in the 1978, 1979, and 1980 seasons and played their home games in Memphis&#x27; Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium. They also played indoor soccer at the Mid-South Coliseum during the 1979–80 season.

==History==
In the mid-1970s, Harry T. Mangurian, Jr. and Beau Rogers joined forces to establish a new North American Soccer League (NASL) franchise. Mangurian owned a horse racing track in Florida, and Rogers was part-owner and general manager of the Tampa Bay Rowdies. As the two men searched for a city to serve as home for their new team, they looked at several locations in the southern U.S. – including New Orleans, Houston, Nashville and Atlanta – before settling on Memphis, Tennessee. Next, they decided to name the team the &quot;Rogues&quot; in part as an allusion to the Rowdies, as well as for a desire to have an elephant mascot (a &quot;Rogue&quot; elephant).

The team hired Malcolm Allison as its first coach. Allison came from Turkish powerhouse Galatasaray but his time in Memphis would be very short. Allison had achieved much controversy during his time in England, and when he had failed to sign a sufficient number of players for the inaugural season, he was dismissed without having coached a match and replaced by ex-Chelsea star Eddie McCreadie. The club finished the 1978 season in third place in its division and did not make the playoffs. Attendance averaged 8,708 a match, 17th in the 24-team league.

The second season, 1979, was disrupted by a players&#x27; strike which forced McCreadie out of retirement for a time. The team did worse on the pitch, finishing last, and worse at the box office, with 7,137 a match, with three teams doing worse.

The poor gates resulted in Mangurian and Rogers selling the team to Avron Fogelman in 1980. Fogelman owned a Memphis minor league baseball team and later became a part owner of the Kansas City Royals. Though attendance went up in 1980 to 9,864 a match, this was still 17th in the league and the team were again last in their division, though McCreadie&#x27;s old Chelsea mate Charlie Cooke had taken over as coach.

The Rogues&#x27; last game ever came at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium against the Houston Hurricane. The Rogues won, 6–1. Tony Field scored the final goal in Memphis Rogues history. He beat the goalkeeper and walked the ball into the net. When he arrived at the goal line, he got down on his knees and headed the ball into the net. More skeptical fans and that the Rogues were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs and the Hurricane only need one goal to qualify, raised an eyebrow at the result. In the 1980 NASL goals of the year video, the Hurricanes are standing still, allowing Field to give the fans one last show.

In 1981, Fogelman cut his losses and sold the Rogues to Nelson Skalbania, a Canadian businessman who moved the team to Calgary, Alberta. Skalbania renamed the team the Calgary Boomers for the 1981, but the team lasted only one year in Calgary before folding.

===Indoor success===
The Rogues played the 1979–80 season of NASL indoor soccer at the Mid-South Coliseum. They posted a 9–3 regular-season record, won the Western Division, and went all the way to the finals, winning Game 1 of the series, 5–4, at home in front of 9,081 fans, before losing Game 2 and the mini-game tie-breaker to the Tampa Bay Rowdies at the Bayfront Center in St. Petersburg, Florida.

<text>Jijona () or Xixona () is a town and municipality in the Valencian Community on the eastern coast of Spain.

==Turrón==
The town is famous for a type of soft nougat, known in Spanish as &quot;Turrón de Jijona&quot; and in Valencian as &quot;Torró de Xixona&quot;. This is mostly due to the extensive almond farming that has existed since the Moorish farmers originally cultivated the almond trees following the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. Several factories produce turrón, which is all distributed for sale in December, although now they are trying to expand it during the other months.

This turrón is protected by European Union, through the IGP (Indicación Geográfica Protegida).

<doc id="636686" wikidata="Q1236807" url="?curid=636686" title="URL redirection">
<text>URL redirection, also called URL forwarding, is a World Wide Web technique for making a web page available under more than one URL address. When a web browser attempts to open a URL that has been redirected, a page with a different URL is opened. Similarly, domain redirection or domain forwarding is when all pages in a URL domain are redirected to a different domain, as when wikipedia.com and wikipedia.net are automatically redirected to wikipedia.org.

URL redirection is done for various reasons:
* for URL shortening;
* to prevent broken links when web pages are moved;
* to allow multiple domain names belonging to the same owner to refer to a single web site;
* to guide navigation into and out of a website;
* for privacy protection (such as redirecting YouTube and Twitter links to Invidious and Nitter respectively or to turn AMP links into normal links); and
* for hostile purposes such as phishing attacks or malware distribution.

== Purposes ==
There are several reasons to use URL redirection:

=== Forcing HTTPS ===

A website may potentially be accessible over both a secure HTTPS URI scheme and plain HTTP (an insecure URI beginning with &quot;http://&quot;).

If a user types in a URI or clicks on a link that refers to the insecure variant, the browser will automatically redirect to the secure version in case the website is contained in the HSTS preload list shipped with the application or if the user had already visited the origin in the past.

Otherwise the website will be contacted over HTTP. A website operator may decide to serve such requests by redirecting the browser to the HTTPS variant instead and hopefully also priming HSTS for future accesses.

=== Similar domain names ===

A user might mistype a URL. Organizations often register these misspelled domains and redirect them to the intended location. This technique is often used to &quot;reserve&quot; other top-level domains (TLD) with the same name, or make it easier for a &quot;.edu&quot; or &quot;.net&quot; site to accommodate users who type &quot;.com&quot;.

=== Moving pages to a new domain ===
Web pages may be redirected to a new domain for three reasons:
* a site might desire, or need, to change its domain name;
* an author might move their individual pages to a new domain;
* two web sites might merge.

With URL redirects, incoming links to an outdated URL can be sent to the correct location. These links might be from other sites that have not realized that there is a change or from bookmarks/favorites that users have saved in their browsers. The same applies to search engines. They often have the older/outdated domain names and links in their database and will send search users to these old URLs. By using a &quot;moved permanently&quot; redirect to the new URL, visitors will still end up at the correct page. Also, in the next search engine pass, the search engine should detect and use the newer URL.

=== Logging outgoing links ===
The access logs of most web servers keep detailed information about where visitors came from and how they browsed the hosted site. They do not, however, log which links visitors left by. This is because the visitor&#x27;s browser has no need to communicate with the original server when the visitor clicks on an outgoing link. This information can be captured in several ways. One way involves URL redirection. Instead of sending the visitor straight to the other site, links on the site can direct to a URL on the original website&#x27;s domain that automatically redirects to the real target. This technique bears the downside of the delay caused by the additional request to the original website&#x27;s server. As this added request will leave a trace in the server log, revealing exactly which link was followed, it can also be a privacy issue. The same technique is also used by some corporate websites to implement a statement that the subsequent content is at another site, and therefore not necessarily affiliated with the corporation. In such scenarios, displaying the warning causes an additional delay.

=== Short aliases for long URLs ===
Web applications often include lengthy descriptive attributes in their URLs which represent data hierarchies, command structures, transaction paths and session information. This practice results in a URL that is aesthetically unpleasant and difficult to remember, and which may not fit within the size limitations of microblogging sites. URL shortening services provide a solution to this problem by redirecting a user to a longer URL from a shorter one.

=== Meaningful, persistent aliases for long or changing URLs ===
Sometimes the URL of a page changes even though the content stays the same. Therefore, URL redirection can help users who have bookmarks. This is routinely done on Wikipedia whenever a page is renamed.

=== Post/Redirect/Get ===
Post/Redirect/Get (PRG) is a web development design pattern that prevents some duplicate form submissions if the user clicks the refresh button after submitting the form, creating a more intuitive interface for user agents (users).

=== Device targeting and geotargeting ===

Redirects can be effectively used for targeting purposes like geotargeting. Device targeting has become increasingly important with the rise of mobile clients. There are two approaches to serve mobile users: Make the website responsive or redirect to a mobile website version. If a mobile website version is offered, users with mobile clients will be automatically forwarded to the corresponding mobile content. For device targeting, client-side redirects or non-cacheable server-side redirects are used. Geotargeting is the approach to offer localized content and automatically forward the user to a localized version of the requested URL. This is helpful for websites that target audience in more than one location and/or language. Usually server-side redirects are used for Geotargeting but client-side redirects might be an option as well, depending on requirements.

=== Manipulating search engines ===
Redirects have been used to manipulate search engines with unethical intentions, e.g., URL hijacking. The goal of misleading redirects is to drive search traffic to landing pages, which do not have enough ranking power on their own or which are only remotely or not at all related to the search target. The approach requires a rank for a range of search terms with a number of URLs that would utilize sneaky redirects to forward the searcher to the target page. This method had a revival with the uprise of mobile devices and device targeting. URL hijacking is an off-domain redirect technique that exploited the nature of the search engine&#x27;s handling for temporary redirects. If a temporary redirect is encountered, search engines have to decide whether they assign the ranking value to the URL that initializes the redirect or to the redirect target URL. The URL that initiates the redirect may be kept to show up in search results, as the redirect indicates a temporary nature. Under certain circumstances it was possible to exploit this behavior by applying temporary redirects to well-ranking URLs, leading to a replacement of the original URL in search results by the URL that initialized the redirect, therefore &quot;stealing&quot; the ranking. This method was usually combined with sneaky redirects to re-target the user stream from the search results to a target page. Search engines have developed efficient technologies to detect these kinds of manipulative approaches. Major search engines usually apply harsh ranking penalties on sites that get caught applying techniques like these.

=== Manipulating visitors ===
URL redirection is sometimes used as a part of phishing attacks that confuse visitors about which web site they are visiting. Because modern browsers always show the real URL in the address bar, the threat is lessened. However, redirects can also take you to sites that will otherwise attempt to attack in other ways. For example, a redirect might take a user to a site that would attempt to trick them into downloading antivirus software and installing a Trojan of some sort instead.

=== Removing codice_1 information ===
When a link is clicked, the browser sends along in the HTTP request a field called referer which indicates the source of the link. This field is populated with the URL of the current web page, and will end up in the logs of the server serving the external link. Since sensitive pages may have sensitive URLs (for example, codice_2), it is not desirable for the codice_1 URL to leave the organization. A redirection page that performs referrer hiding could be embedded in all external URLs, transforming for example codice_4 into codice_5. This technique also eliminates other potentially sensitive information from the referrer URL, such as the session ID, and can reduce the chance of phishing by indicating to the end user that they passed a clear gateway to another site.

== Implementation ==
Several different kinds of response to the browser will result in a redirection. These vary in whether they affect HTTP headers or HTML content. The techniques used typically depend on the role of the person implementing it and their access to different parts of the system. For example, a web author with no control over the headers might use a Refresh meta tag whereas a web server administrator redirecting all pages on a site is more likely to use server configuration.

=== Manual redirect ===
The simplest technique is to ask the visitor to follow a link to the new page, usually using an HTML anchor like:
Please follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.example.com/&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.
This method is often used as a fall-back — if the browser does not support the automatic redirect, the visitor can still reach the target document by following the link.

=== HTTP status codes 3xx ===
In the HTTP protocol used by the World Wide Web, a redirect is a response with a status code beginning with &quot;3&quot; that causes a browser to display a different page. If a client encounters a redirect, it needs to make a number of decisions how to handle the redirect. Different status codes are used by clients to understand the purpose of the redirect, how to handle caching and which request method to use for the subsequent request.

HTTP/1.1 defines several status codes for redirection (RFC 7231):
* 300 multiple choices (e.g. offer different languages)
* 301 moved permanently (redirects permanently from one URL to another passing link equity to the redirected page)
* 302 found (originally &quot;temporary redirect&quot; in HTTP/1.0 and popularly used for CGI scripts; superseded by 303 and 307 in HTTP/1.1 but preserved for backward compatibility)
* 303 see other (forces a GET request to the new URL even if original request was POST)
* 305 use proxy (indicates that the client&#x27;s requested resource is only available through a proxy)
* 307 temporary redirect (provides a new URL for the browser to resubmit a GET or POST request)
* 308 permanent redirect (provides a new URL for the browser to resubmit a GET or POST request)

Status codes 304 not modified and 305 use proxy are not redirects.

All of these status codes require the URL of the redirect target to be given in the &quot;Location:&quot; header of the HTTP response. The 300 multiple choices will usually list all choices in the body of the message and show the default choice in the &quot;Location:&quot; header.

==== Example HTTP response for a 301 redirect ====

A HTTP response with the 301 &quot;moved permanently&quot; redirect looks like this:
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://www.example.org/
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 174

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Moved&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
=Moved=
&lt;p&gt;This page has moved to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.example.org/&quot;&gt;https://www.example.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
==== Using server-side scripting for redirection ====
Web authors producing HTML content can&#x27;t usually create redirects using HTTP headers as these are generated automatically by the web server program when serving an HTML file. The same is usually true even for programmers writing CGI scripts, though some servers allow scripts to add custom headers (e.g. by enabling &quot;non-parsed-headers&quot;). Many web servers will generate a 3xx status code if a script outputs a &quot;Location:&quot; header line. For example, in PHP, one can use the &quot;header&quot; function:
header(&#x27;HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently&#x27;);
header(&#x27;Location: https://www.example.com/&#x27;);
exit();
More headers may be required to prevent caching. The programmer must ensure that the headers are output before the body. This may not fit easily with the natural flow of control through the code. To help with this, some frameworks for server-side content generation can buffer the body data. In the ASP scripting language, this can also be accomplished using codice_6 and codice_7 HTTP/1.1 allows for either a relative URI reference or an absolute URI reference. If the URI reference is relative the client computes the required absolute URI reference according to the rules defined in RFC 3986.

==== Apache HTTP Server mod_rewrite ====
The Apache HTTP Server mod_alias extension can be used to redirect certain requests. Typical configuration directives look like:

Redirect permanent /oldpage.html https://www.example.com/newpage.html
Redirect 301 /oldpage.html https://www.example.com/newpage.html
For more flexible URL rewriting and redirection, Apache mod_rewrite can be used. E.g., to redirect a requests to a canonical domain name:

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^([^.:]+\.)*oldsite\.example\.com\.?(:[0-9]*)?$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://newsite.example.net/$1 [R=301,L]
Such configuration can be applied to one or all sites on the server through the server configuration files or to a single content directory through a codice_8 file.

==== nginx rewrite ====
Nginx has an integrated http rewrite module, which can be used to perform advanced URL processing and even web-page generation (with the codice_9 directive). An example of such advanced use of the rewrite module is mdoc.su, which implements a deterministic URL shortening service entirely with the help of nginx configuration language alone.

For example, if a request for codice_10 were to come along, it would first be redirected internally to codice_11 with the first rewrite directive below (only affecting the internal state, without any HTTP replies issued to the client just yet), and then with the second rewrite directive, an HTTP response with a 302 Found status code would be issued to the client to actually redirect to the external cgi script of web-man:

 location /DragonFly {
 rewrite ^/DragonFly(BSD)?([,/].*)?$ /d$2 last;
 location /d {
 set $db &quot;https://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/cgi/web-man?command=&quot;;
 set $ds &quot;&amp;section=&quot;;
 rewrite ^/./([^/]+)\.([1-9])$ $db$1$ds$2 redirect;


=== Refresh Meta tag and HTTP refresh header ===
Netscape introduced the meta refresh feature which refreshes a page after a certain amount of time. This can specify a new URL to replace one page with another. This is supported by most web browsers. A timeout of zero seconds effects an immediate redirect. This is treated like a 301 permanent redirect by Google, allowing transfer of PageRank to the target page.

This is an example of a simple HTML document that uses this technique:

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
 &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Refresh&quot; content=&quot;0; url=https://www.example.com/&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Please follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.example.com/&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
This technique can be used by web authors because the meta tag is contained inside the document itself. The meta tag must be placed in the &quot;head&quot; section of the HTML file. The number &quot;0&quot; in this example may be replaced by another number to achieve a delay of that many seconds. The anchor in the &quot;body&quot; section is for users whose browsers do not support this feature.

The same effect can be achieved with an HTTP codice_12 header:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Refresh: 0; url=https://www.example.com/
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 78

Please follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.example.com/&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.
This response is easier to generate by CGI programs because one does not need to change the default status code.

Here is a simple CGI program that effects this redirect:

# !/usr/bin/perl
print &quot;Refresh: 0; url=https://www.example.com/\r\n&quot;;
print &quot;Content-Type: text/html\r\n&quot;;
print &quot;\r\n&quot;;
print &quot;Please follow &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.example.com/\&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;!&quot;
Note: Usually, the HTTP server adds the status line and the Content-Length header automatically.

The W3C discourage the use of meta refresh, since it does not communicate any information about either the original or new resource, to the browser (or search engine). The W3C&#x27;s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (7.4) discourage the creation of auto-refreshing pages, since most web browsers do not allow the user to disable or control the refresh rate. Some articles that they have written on the issue include W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (1.0): Ensure user control of time-sensitive content changes, Use standard redirects: don&#x27;t break the back button! and Core Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 section 7.

=== JavaScript redirects ===
JavaScript can cause a redirect by setting the codice_13 attribute, e.g.:

window.location=&#x27;https://www.example.com/&#x27;

Normally JavaScript pushes the redirector site&#x27;s URL to the browser&#x27;s history. It can cause redirect loops when users hit the back button. With the following command you can prevent this type of behaviour.

window.location.replace(&#x27;https://www.example.com/&#x27;)

However, HTTP headers or the refresh meta tag may be preferred for security reasons and because JavaScript will not be executed by some browsers and many web crawlers.

=== Frame redirects ===

A slightly different effect can be achieved by creating an inline frame:
&lt;iframe height=&quot;100%&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.example.com/&quot;&gt;
Please follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.example.com/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/iframe&gt;
One main difference to the above redirect methods is that for a frame redirect, the browser displays the URL of the frame document and not the URL of the target page in the URL bar. This &quot;cloaking&quot; technique may be used so that the reader sees a more memorable URL or to fraudulently conceal a phishing site as part of website spoofing.

Before HTML5, the same effect could be done with an HTML frame that contains the target page:

&lt;frameset rows=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
 &lt;frame src=&quot;https://www.example.com/&quot;&gt;
 &lt;noframes&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;Please follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.example.com/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/noframes&gt;
&lt;/frameset&gt;
=== Redirect chains ===

One redirect may lead to another in a redirect chain. If a redirect leads to another redirect, this may also be known as a double redirect. For example, the URL &quot;https://wikipedia.com&quot; (with &quot;*.com&quot; as domain) is first redirected to https://www.wikipedia.org/ (with domain name in .org), where you can navigate to the language-specific site. This is unavoidable if the different links in the chain are served by different servers though it should be minimised by &quot;rewriting&quot; the URL as much as possible on the server before returning it to the browser as a redirect.

=== Redirect loops ===
Sometimes a mistake can cause a page to end up redirecting back to itself, possibly via other pages, leading to an infinite sequence of redirects. Browsers should stop redirecting after a certain number of hops and display an error message.

The HTTP/1.1 Standard states:

A client &quot;SHOULD&quot; detect and intervene in cyclical redirections (i.e., &quot;infinite&quot; redirection loops).

Note: An earlier version of this specification recommended a maximum of five redirections (RFC 2068, Section 10.3). Content developers need to be aware that some clients might implement such a fixed limitation.
== Services ==
There exist services that can perform URL redirection on demand, with no need for technical work or access to the web server your site is hosted on.

=== URL redirection services ===
A redirect service is an information management system, which provides an internet link that redirects users to the desired content. The typical benefit to the user is the use of a memorable domain name, and a reduction in the length of the URL or web address. A redirecting link can also be used as a permanent address for content that frequently changes hosts, similarly to the Domain Name System. Hyperlinks involving URL redirection services are frequently used in spam messages directed at blogs and wikis. Thus, one way to reduce spam is to reject all edits and comments containing hyperlinks to known URL redirection services; however, this will also remove legitimate edits and comments and may not be an effective method to reduce spam.
Recently, URL redirection services have taken to using AJAX as an efficient, user friendly method for creating shortened URLs. A major drawback of some URL redirection services is the use of delay pages, or frame based advertising, to generate revenue.

==== History ====
The first redirect services took advantage of top-level domains (TLD) such as &quot;.to&quot; (Tonga), &quot;.at&quot; (Austria) and &quot;.is&quot; (Iceland). Their goal was to make memorable URLs. The first mainstream redirect service was V3.com that boasted 4 million users at its peak in 2000. V3.com success was attributed to having a wide variety of short memorable domains including &quot;r.im&quot;, &quot;go.to&quot;, &quot;i.am&quot;, &quot;come.to&quot; and &quot;start.at&quot;. V3.com was acquired by FortuneCity.com, a large free web hosting company, in early 1999. As the sales price of top level domains started falling from per year to less than , use of redirection services declined. With the launch of TinyURL in 2002 a new kind of redirecting service was born, namely URL shortening. Their goal was to make long URLs short, to be able to post them on internet forums. Since 2006, with the 140 character limit on the extremely popular Twitter service, these short URL services have been heavily used.

=== Referrer masking ===
Redirection services can hide the referrer by placing an intermediate page between the page the link is on and its destination. Although these are conceptually similar to other URL redirection services, they serve a different purpose, and they rarely attempt to shorten or obfuscate the destination URL (as their only intended side-effect is to hide referrer information and provide a clear gateway between other websites.) This type of redirection is often used to prevent potentially-malicious links from gaining information using the referrer, for example a session ID in the query string. Many large community websites use link redirection on external links to lessen the chance of an exploit that could be used to steal account information, as well as make it clear when a user is leaving a service, to lessen the chance of effective phishing .

Here is a simplistic example of such a service, written in PHP.

&lt;?php
$url = htmlspecialchars($_GET[&#x27;url&#x27;]);
header(&#x27;Refresh: 0; url=https://&#x27; . $url);
&lt;!-- Fallback using meta refresh. --&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Redirecting...&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;refresh&quot; content=&quot;0;url=https://&lt;?= $url; ?&gt;&quot;&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
 Attempting to redirect to &lt;a href=&quot;https://&lt;?= $url; ?&gt;&quot;&gt;https://&lt;?= $url; ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
The above example does not check who called it (e.g. by referrer, although that could be spoofed). Also, it does not check the URL provided. This means that a malicious person could link to the redirection page using a URL parameter of his/her own selection, from any page, which uses the web server&#x27;s resources.

==Security issues==

URL redirection can be abused by attackers to perform phishing attacks. If a redirect target is not sufficiently validated by a web application, an attacker can make a web application redirect to an arbitrary website. This vulnerability is known as an open-redirect vulnerability. In certain cases when an open redirect occurs as part of an authentication flow, the vulnerability is known as a covert redirect. When a covert redirect occurs, the attacker website can steal authentication information from the victim website. Open redirect vulnerabilities are fairly common on the web. In June 2022, TechRadar found over 25 active examples of open redirect vulnerabilities on the web, including sites like Google and Instagram. Open redirects have their own CWE identifier, CWE-601.

URL redirection also provides a mechanism to perform cross-site leak attacks. By timing how long a website took to return a particular page or by differentiating one destination page from another, an attacker can gain significant information about another website&#x27;s state. In 2021, Knittel et al. discovered a vulnerability in the Chrome&#x27;s Performance API implementation which allowed them to reliably detect cross-origin redirects.

<text>The Royal Grammar School Worcester (also known as RGS Worcester or RGSW) is an eleven-eighteen co-educational, private day school and sixth form in Worcester, Worcestershire, England. Founded before 1291, it is one of the oldest British independent day schools.

In September 2007, the school merged with the neighbouring Alice Ottley School and was briefly known as RGS Worcester and The Alice Ottley School (RGSAO) before reverting to the original name. The school began accepting girls in 2003, prior to the merger. The school currently consists of the main secondary school and three preparatory campuses known as RGS Springfield (previously a boarding house of the Alice Ottley School), RGS The Grange (opened 1996), and RGS Dodderhill.

Until 1992 it accepted boarders. Boarding pupils would reside in Whiteladies House, a building that is rumoured to contain hidden treasure from Charles I from when he sought refuge there during the Civil War. It is now a day school and in 2024 was named the top co-ed independent school in the West Midlands.

Tracing its origins back to the 7th century, it is the sixth oldest school in the world.

==History==

The school was founded as a secular monastic school in Worcester in around 685 by Bishop Bosel. This makes it the 6th oldest school in the world. It was located outside the monastic precincts (as with the King&#x27;s School, Canterbury) and catered for the relatives of monks and children intending to go into the monastery. The first written reference to the school appears in 1265 when the Bishop of Worcester, Walter de Cantilupe, sent four chaplains into the city to teach.

Conclusive evidence appears in 1291 when an argument was settled by Bishop Godfrey Giffard regarding who owned the wax from the candles used at the feast of St Swithun. It was decided that the scholars of the Worcester School owned it, and the Rector of Saint Nicholas Church had to rely on the generosity of the scholars in order to get candle wax. The headmaster is mentioned as Stephen of London. The letter dated December 1291 is in the County Records Office in Worcester.

The next headmaster was appointed in 1312 as Hugh of Northampton as recorded in the Bishop&#x27;s register for that year. He was appointed personally by the Bishop of Worcester, Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Chancellor Walter Reynolds. The school continued to exist under the control of the city guilds through the centuries with various records of headmasters being appointed, again listed in the registers of the bishops of Worcester. One in particular was &#x27;Sir Richard (Chaplain)&#x27;, who was dismissed by the bishop of Worcester, Philip Morgan, in 1422 for taking money from the scholars for his own use. He was replaced the same year by Sir John Bredel. Sir Richard Pennington was appointed in 1485 and is known to have given money to the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s fund, showing the strong connection of the school with the church.

===Royal charters===
After a petition by some notable citizens of Worcester to endow the school permanently, the school was given a Royal Charter by Queen Elizabeth I in 1561 and a governing body known as the Six Masters was set up, which remains as the governing body of the new RGS Worcester school today. Amongst famous Six masters are John Wall, Earl Beauchamp, Charles William Dyson Perrins and Anthony Lechemere.

The Six Masters acquired much land for the school including its current site bought in 1562, the Pitchcroft fields, now used as the city racecourse, and land in Herefordshire still owned by the school. The 1906 Charity Commission survey also recorded a number of Pubs in Worcester which still exist today.

A second Royal Charter was granted in 1843 by Queen Victoria, and the title of &#x27;Royal&#x27; was conferred in 1869.

==Houses==
The house system was introduced in 1899 by the then headmaster Frederick Arthur Hillard. Initially six houses were established, and membership of houses was based on the place of residence of each boy. The original houses were: Boarders, Barbourne, City, St. John&#x27;s, County A, and County B. In 1909 the house system was changed to reflect the increasing number of boys in the school, and the difficulty of allocating pupils on the basis of where they lived. The six houses created in 1909 were: School House, for boarders, (which, due to common usage, changed to Whiteladies, as this was the building in which the boarders lived); Temple (after Henry Temple, headmaster 1850s); Tudor (after Elizabeth I); Woolfe (after Richard Woolfe, benefactor 1877 ); Wylde (after Thomas Wylde, benefactor 1558); and Yewle (after Robert Yewle, Six Master 1561). In 1963 two additional houses were created by the then headmaster Godfrey Brown, namely Langley (after William Langley, Six Master 1561) and Moore (after John Moore, benefactor 1626).

In 2013/ 2014, the house system changed from six houses (Flagge-red for Flagge Meadow, Butler-yellow for the old Butler Library, Cobham-gold for Cobham Hall, Eld-green for Eld Hall, Perrins-orange for Perrins Hall and Britannia-blue for Britannia house) to the current house system.

The current houses are:
The school holds a yearly house championship, decided by a range of events throughout the school year in which all four houses compete, with the winners of each event being awarded four points, the second-placed house three, down to the losing house one point. The house championship was traditionally called the &#x27;Cock House&#x27; (or Cock House Cup Competition) competition, its name deriving from that of the Cock. The original cup that was competed for is one which was presented to the school in 1902 by the Old Elizabethans&#x27; Association; in modern times competition is for a cup which was introduced in 1978.

==Affiliated schools==

===RGS The Grange===

RGS The Grange (Royal Grammar School The Grange) is located in Claines, north of Worcester, United Kingdom. It is approximately north of the senior school, and is situated on a site.

The headmaster of the school since 2009 has been Gareth Hughes.

The school was founded in 1996, when RGS Worcester purchased a traditional English farmhouse in Claines named “The Grange”. It opened to just twenty pupils at the time, but soon other parts of the RGS prep school moved from the senior school site to the Grange. By early 2004, all of the prep school was located at the Grange.

Facilities at the school were upgraded in the early 2000s with a £4.5 million development of the buildings. The build was completed ahead of schedule.

The Grange has wide-ranging sporting facilities, set in 50 acres (200,000 m2) of maintained pitches and playing fields. It also has an astroturf pitch for hockey.

The school has four houses: Cash (green), Perowne (yellow), Cornwall (red), and Goodrich (blue).

During 2008 the school formed linkages with the community departments of Worcester Warriors Rugby Club and Aston Villa Football Club.

===RGS Springfield===

RGS Springfield (Royal Grammar School Springfield) is located in Britannia Square in Worcester, United Kingdom. It is located 100 yards west of the Senior School.

After the RGS/AO merger, RGS Springfield became mixed-sex.

The headmistress of the school is Mrs Laura Brown.

Prior to September 2009, the school was known as AO Springfield, as it was the AO&#x27;s junior school prior to the RGS/AO merger. Today, the school houses 150 pupils.

RGS Springfield is located in a large Georgian house surrounded by six acres of gardens and playing fields. The school has a forest area where the children can learn about nature.

Academic and music scholarships are offered at RGS Springfield.

====Academic scholarships====
These are offered to people entering year five and year six. There is no separate exam; pupils who perform very well in the entrance exam are offered scholarships.

=====Music scholarships=====
These are also offered to people entering year three and year five. As a guide, pupils taking a music scholarship exam in Year three are expected to hold Grade one on one musical instrument. Year five pupils taking the exam are expected to be playing two or more instruments and have achieved grade three in at least one of their grades.

===RGS Dodderhill===

RGS Dodderhill (Royal Grammar School Dodderhill) is located in the town of Droitwich Spa, Worcestershire, approximately six miles outside of Worcester.

Previously Dodderhill Independent Girls School, the school merged with RGS Worcester family of schools in 2019 and became known as RGS Dodderhill.

In September 2021, RGS Dodderhill Prep School became co-educational while the Senior School remains for girls only.

The headmistress of the school is Mrs Sarah Atkinson who was appointed in 2019 following the retirement of Mrs Cate Mawston.

RGS Dodderhill has a large indoor sports hall, outdoor netball and tennis courts, as well as purpose-built drama and music studios. 

==Connections==
The school is a member of the &#x27;Monmouth Group&#x27;, a collection of schools similar in aims and membership to that of the Eton Group. The school is also a member of the HMC.

==Land and buildings==
Many of the current buildings were paid for Charles William Dyson Perrins, who was an Old Boy and a member of the school&#x27;s governing body. Perrins Hall was named after his father James Dyson Perrins, owner of Lea and Perrins Worcestershire Sauce, who went to the school.

The basement of Perrins Hall contains a rifle range, which was added in 1914. The back rooms of Perrins Hall used to be the sixth-form common rooms and are now used for storage.

===Flagge Meadow===
Flagge Meadow is located nearby at the back of the school, next to the Worcester and Birmingham Canal.
Flagge Meadow (pronounced Flag) was first levelled and used for cricket in 1886. The first recorded match to be held there was in 1939, when the school played Merton College, Oxford. The ground has also played host to several Second XI fixtures for the Worcestershire Second XI in the Second XI Championship and Second XI Trophy. In 2007, the ground held a single List-A match for Worcestershire when they played Sri Lanka A. Each year in the summer term cricket is played at Flagge Meadow.

===Other land===
St. Oswald&#x27;s, the school&#x27;s second playing field, is located further down the canal and is mainly used for athletics, football and rounders.

==School&#x27;s halls==

The Old School buildings were built in 1868 on a site owned by the school since 1562. The Main Hall, Eld Hall and adjoining buildings were designed by A E Perkins in the Gothic style. It is three bays long with a central lantern. A life-size statue of Elizabeth I by R L Boulton stands above the central window.

The Perrins Hall was built in 1914 to the plans of Alfred Hill Parker (an Old Boy) in a Jacobethan style with an Oriel Window on the staircase end and balcony looking over the hall. The interior is panelled with fitted bookcases (which make up the Dowty Library) and a plastered ceiling. Two war memorials for the two World Wars are housed in the hall and a life-size portrait of Charles William Dyson Perrins hangs opposite the fireplace. Portraits of the 20th-century headmasters hang below. The school organ is in this building, and is played regularly at assemblies.

The Clock Block is connected to the Perrins Hall and was built in 1927, and had extension work carried out in 1967 to link it to the Science Block. It has a bell tower and clock above the entrance. The clock (which was installed by J. B. Joyce &amp; Co) is made of Cotswold Limestone, and is surmounted by the carved head of Old Father Time. To commemorate the millennium a stained glass window was commissioned and installed over the main entrance to the Clock Block.

In the Alice Ottley Building, formerly the main school building for the Alice Ottley School, there are two more halls: Cobham Hall and Main Hall. Main Hall is the school&#x27;s dining hall, with views over a lawn and a stained glass window commemorating Miss Margaret Spurling, headmistress of the Alice Ottley School from 1912 to 1934.

===Other buildings===

The science buildings were built in 1922 and opened by the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth). The science buildings were subsequently refurbished in 1996 and thereafter re-opened by Michael Portillo. The science block features at one end of a long path which comes from the main quad of the school, which is the location of Perrins Hall and the Main block. This long path is known as Long Walk.

Whiteladies House, built in the 17th century, was traditionally the Headmaster&#x27;s house and stands opposite Clock Block across the gardens. This is currently where the school admin staff, nurse, and school heads of departments are situated. The West wall was part of the Whiteladies Priory Chapel built in 1255. Its name derives from the white habit that is worn by Cistercian nuns, who were based at a Nunnery, which was adjacent to Whiteladies.
Other buildings include Priory House (17th Century), Pullinger House (1980s), Gordon House (after Adam Lindsay Gordon OE), Stephen Hall (1961, opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother on her second visit to the school) and the Design Centre comprising various engineering facilities.

The most recent building work to a school building took place on the school&#x27;s Performing Arts Centre. The Performing Arts Centre (formerly a gymnasium), was extended to create three spaces: Studio 1 downstairs, Studio 2 upstairs, and the Godfrey Brown Theatre. An entrance was added to the back of the building and a car park was opened. This project cost the school £2.8 million.

The school&#x27;s library was refurbished in 2001, and was renamed the Philip Sawyer Library (after the former chairman of the governors). It was opened by the then Poet Laureate Andrew Motion. The library is situated above Eld Hall, and features a high vaulted roof structure.

==Sport==
===Rowing===
The school has a rowing club, the Royal Grammar School Worcester Boat Club, which is based on the River Severn. The club is affiliated to British Rowing (boat code WRG) and has produced British champion crews at the British Rowing Championships in 1997, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003.

===Other Sports===

The school offers Rugby union and football to boys and hockey and netball to girls. The school stopped teaching lacrosse in 2010.

Both boys and girls are taught tennis, athletics, swimming and, after a six-year campaign by a former pupil, cricket is now taught to girls as well as boys.

<text>Metalcore is a broadly defined fusion genre combining elements of extreme metal and hardcore punk, that originated in the late 1980s. Metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages conducive to moshing, while other defining instrumentation includes heavy and percussive pedal point guitar riffs and double bass drumming. Vocalists in the genre typically perform screaming; more popular bands often combine this with the use of standard singing, usually during the bridge or chorus of a song. However, the death growl is also a popular technique within the genre.

In the late 1980s to early 1990s, pioneering bands such as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, whose hardcore punk-leaning style is sometimes referred to as metallic hardcore, were founded. These bands took influence from a range of styles and genres such as hardcore punk, thrash metal and death metal. During the decade, the genre diversified, with Converge, the Dillinger Escape Plan, Botch and Coalesce pioneering mathcore, while Overcast, Shadows Fall and Darkest Hour merged the genre with melodic death metal to create melodic metalcore. During the early 2000s, melodic metalcore bands such as Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, Trivium, As I Lay Dying, Atreyu, Bullet for My Valentine and Parkway Drive found mainstream popularity. In the subsequent years, the genre saw increased success through social networking on Myspace and internet memes such as crabcore. During this time, artists began to draw influence from a wide variety of sources, which led to genre cultivating a plethora of fusion genres including electronicore, deathcore, Nintendocore, progressive metalcore and nu metalcore. In the 2010s and through to the 2020s, the genre saw even greater commercial success, with albums by Bring Me the Horizon, Architects, Asking Alexandria, the Devil Wears Prada and Of Mice &amp; Men penetrating the top 10 of international albums charts.

==Characteristics==
Metalcore fuses elements of hardcore punk and extreme metal, and is known for its use of breakdowns. Jon Weiderhorn of Loudwire stated that early metalcore bands&#x27; breakdowns were influenced by death metal.

Metalcore singers typically perform screaming, a vocal technique developed in the 1980s and characteristic of 1990s metalcore. Later metalcore bands often combine this with the use of standard singing, usually during the bridge or chorus of a song. The death growl technique is also popular.

The instrumentation of metalcore includes heavy guitar riffs often utilizing percussive pedal tones, stop-start rhythm guitar, double bass drumming, and breakdowns. Drop guitar tunings are often used. Most bands use tuning ranging between Drop D and A, although lower tunings, as well as 7 and 8 string guitars, are not uncommon. Drummers typically use a lot of double bass technique and general drumming styles across the board. Blast beats are also heard at times. According to author James Giordano, &quot;tempos in metalcore tend to be slower than those found in thrash metal&quot;. Many later metalcore bands would include guitar solos in songs.

Some metalcore bands, such as Botch and Cave In, stylistically lean towards hardcore, while others, such as Killswitch Engage gravitate towards a heavy metal sound. Many 2000s metalcore bands were heavily influenced by melodic death metal, and extensively incorporated elements of the style into their music. Malcolm Dome of &quot;Revolver&quot; wrote that without melodic death metal band At the Gates&#x27; 1995 album &quot;Slaughter of the Soul&quot;, &quot;modern American metalcore (everyone from As I Lay Dying and Killswitch Engage to All That Remains and the Black Dahlia Murder) wouldn&#x27;t even exist.&quot; Graham Hartmann of &quot;Loudwire&quot; wrote &quot;Although metalcore broke in the early 2000s, listening to At the Gates&#x27; 1995 album feels like a Nostradamus-esque prediction of how metal would evolve.&quot;

==Etymology==

The term &quot;metalcore&quot; is a portmanteau of the words &quot;metal&quot; and &quot;hardcore&quot;, and was originally tongue-in-cheek. During the 1980s, &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; had used early variations of the term, referring to Richmond band Black Pyramid as &quot;heavy-metal core&quot; in February 1985; Oxnard band False Confessions as &quot;metal-core&quot; in December 1985; Mesa band Desecration as &quot;death metal core&quot; in May 1986; and Austin band Last Will as &quot;ghoulish metal/core&quot; in December 1986. When the metalcore genre began in the 1990s, it was largely known as &quot;metallic hardcore&quot;.

According to &quot;Loudwire&quot;, Shai Hulud guitarist Matt Fox &quot;is often cited as someone who assisted in popularizing the word [metalcore]&quot;. However, in a 2008 interview, Fox claimed the term had already been in use before his band began releasing music. He recalled: &quot;There were bands before Shai Hulud started that my friends and I were referring to as &#x27;metalcore.&#x27; Bands like Burn, Deadguy, Earth Crisis, even Integrity. These bands that were heavier than the average hardcore bands. These bands that were more progressive [...] my friends and I would always refer to them as &#x27;metalcore&#x27; because it wasn&#x27;t purely hardcore and it wasn&#x27;t purely metal [...] so we would joke around and say, &#x27;Hey, it&#x27;s metalcore. Cool!&#x27; But it was definitely a tongue-in-cheek term.&quot;
Alternatively, Jorge Rosado of Merauder claimed in 2014 interview that he and his band coined the term.

==History==

===Precursors: 1980s===


Many of the originators of hardcore punk took influence from the sound of heavy metal, including Black Flag, the Bad Brains, Discharge and the Exploited, Furthermore, during the 1980s many genres originated merging the two styles, including crust punk, sludge metal and crossover thrash. Nonetheless, punk and metal cultures and music remained fairly separate through the 1980s.

Bands in the New York hardcore scene in particular put a significant emphasis on the influence of metal, building their own take on hardcore, based around groove-driven, palm muted guitar riffs. Early on, this scene saw the development of the hardcore breakdown, an amalgamation of Bad Brains&#x27; reggae and hardcore backgrounds, which encouraged moshing. It was this New York-style hardcore that metalcore grew directly out of.

===Origins: 1990s===

One of the earliest metalcore scene was that of Cleveland, Ohio. Fronted by Integrity and Ringworm, the sound of bands in the scene was distinctly darker than what the genre would become. Integrity&#x27;s debut album &quot;Those Who Fear Tomorrow &quot; (1991) merged hardcore with apocalyptic lyrics and metal&#x27;s guitar solos and chugging riffs to create one of the primeval albums in the genre. &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine writer Elis Enis stated that the album &quot;influenced practically every breakdown that&#x27;s been recorded since&quot;. Whereas, Ringworm&#x27;s debut &quot;The Promise&quot; (1993) made use of a style closer to crossover thrash while also putting a heavy emphasis on breakdowns. The term &quot;holy terror&quot; refers to this specific style of metalcore which Integrity and Ringworm pioneered. The style is typified by soaring guitar leads, gravelly vocals and lyrics discussing western esotericism.

Philadelphia&#x27;s Starkweather were also an important early metalcore band, with their album &quot;Crossbearer&quot; (1992) which merged early metal&#x27;s grooves and dark atmospheres with elements of hardcore. Rorschach also pioneered a distinctly dissonant and noise-influence niche into this early metalcore sound, which would go on to define noisecore and mathcore.

In 1993, Earth Crisis released &quot;Firestorm&quot;, a song which became one of the most influential in metalcore. The band&#x27;s militant vegan straight edge ethic and emphasis on chug riffs saw them immediately influence a wave of subsequent bands and gained coverage by major media outlets like &quot;CNN&quot;, &quot;CBS&quot; and &quot;MTV&quot;. The EP the song was a part of was also one of the earliest releases by Victory Records who go on to be a defining part of the metalcore scene in the coming years, through releasing many of the style&#x27;s most successful albums.

Boston, Massachusetts too developed an early metalcore scene, led by Overcast who formed in 1990. Much of this scene were based around Hydra Head Records, which was founded by Aaron Turner after moving to Boston. Converge were one of the earliest and most prominent groups from the city, formed in 1990. Using Rorschach&#x27;s music as their sonic template, the band&#x27;s experimental attitude, emotional lyrics and attention to dynamics led to them becoming one of the most influential bands in the genre. Converge, along with Morris Plains, New Jersey&#x27;s the Dillinger Escape Plan and Tacoma, Washington&#x27;s Botch were three of the founding acts in the style&#x27;s mathcore subgenre, with Kansas City, Missouri&#x27;s Coalesce and New Brunswick, New Jersey&#x27;s Deadguy being prominent acts transitioning towards the style. Converge&#x27;s guitarist Kurt Ballou opened the recording studio GodCity Studio in 1998, and would go on to record many of the most influential subsequent hardcore records from the city.

New York City&#x27;s Merauder released their debut album &quot;Master Killer&quot; in 1996, merging the sounds of metalcore, earlier New York hardcore and the newly emerged beatdown hardcore style. Of the album, &quot;Revolver&quot; writer Elis Enis stated &quot;any self-proclaimed &#x27;metallic hardcore&#x27; band of the last 25 years is indebted to &quot;Master Killer&quot;&#x27;s steel-toed stomp.&quot; Along with All Out War, Darkside NYC and Confusion, Merauder were a part of a wave of bands defining a newer, increasingly metallic style of hardcore in New York that had long been one of the epicentres of the genre. Long Island&#x27;s Vision of Disorder were also a prevalent band in the scene, being one of the first bands to incorporate clean singing into the genre, which would soon become a staple, as well as incorporating elements of nu metal. In a 2005 article by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, writer Greg Pato stated that &quot;with seemingly every local teen waving the VOD banner circa the mid/late &#x27;90s, it seemed as though it was only a matter of time before VOD would become the band to take &#x27;metalcore&#x27; to a massive audience&quot;.
Bridgeport, Connecticut&#x27;s Hatebreed released their debut album &quot;Satisfaction is the Death of Desire&quot; in 1997. The album helped the band achieve underground success, selling 158,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and holds the record for Victory Record&#x27;s best selling debut album. The band&#x27;s style merged classic hardcore with beatdown and metalcore, while also overtly referencing metal bands like Slayer. In a 2015 &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; article, writer Stephen Hill stated &quot;The difference between Hatebreed and many of their influences is that where a band like Madball were happy to co-exist with metal bands without feeling like they were part of the same scene, Hatebreed actively went out of their way to become the hardcore band metal fans listen to.&quot; Other influential metalcore bands of the time include Shai Hulud, Zao and Disembodied.

Orange County, California metalcore band Eighteen Visions contrasted the metalcore scene&#x27;s usual hyper masculine aesthetic of &quot;army and sports clothes&quot; with &quot;skinny jeans, eyeliner and hairstyles influenced by Orgy and Unbroken&quot;. This visual style led to the band being called &quot;fashioncore&quot;. Jasamine White-Gluz of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; wrote that Eighteen Visions look &quot;more like a boy band than a popular hardcore group. Critics tag the band for putting fashion at the centre of their music, but it adds a playful and interesting touch to a band that sounds much tougher than it looks.&quot; A scene of bands in Orange County including Bleeding Through, Avenged Sevenfold and Atreyu continued this in Eighteen Visions&#x27; wake, and influenced emo and scene fashion in the coming decade.

As the decade drew to a close, a wave of metalcore bands began incorporating elements of melodic death metal into their sound. This formed an early version of what would become the melodic metalcore genre, with Shadows Fall&#x27;s &quot;Somber Eyes to the Sky&quot; (1997), Undying&#x27;s &quot;This Day All Gods Die&quot; (1999), Darkest Hour&#x27;s &quot;The Prophecy Fulfilled&quot; (1999), Unearth&#x27;s &quot;Above the Fall of Man&quot; (1999), Prayer for Cleansing&#x27;s &quot;Rain in Endless Fall&quot; (1999) being some of the style&#x27;s earliest releases. CMJ writer Anthony Delia also credited Florida&#x27;s Poison the Well and their first two releases &quot;The Opposite of December... A Season of Separation&quot; (1999) and &quot;Tear from the Red&quot; (2002) as &quot;design[ing] the template for most of&quot; the melodic metalcore bands to come.

=== Mainstream success: 2000s ===

Converge&#x27;s &quot;Jane Doe&quot; was released on 4 September 2001 to universal critical and fan acclaim. The album influenced the development of the sound of other U.S. bands like Norma Jean and Misery Signals as well as international acts like Eden Maine, Johnny Truant and Beecher.
Blake Butler of &quot;Allmusic&quot; stated that Converge &quot;put the final sealing blow on their status as a legend in the world of metallic hardcore&quot; with the album, calling it &quot;an experience -- an encyclopedic envelopment of so much at once.&quot; &quot;Terrorizer Magazine&quot; named it their 2001 Album of the Year, and it was named the greatest album of the 2000s by &quot;Noisecreep&quot;, &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; and &quot;Decibel&quot;.

Douglasville, Georgia&#x27;s Norma Jean and the Chariot were both influential artists continuing metalcore&#x27;s earlier sound into the 2000s. Norma Jean&#x27;s &quot;O&#x27; God, the Aftermath&quot; (2005) was Grammy award nominated for Best Recording Package and the Chariot&#x27;s &quot;Long Live&quot; (2010) was listed as one of &quot;Kerrang!&quot;&#x27;s &quot;21 best U.S. metalcore albums of all time&quot;. In contrast to these bands&#x27; dark approach to the genre, Buffalo, New York&#x27;s Every Time I Die incorporated Southern rock elements and humor, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; noted them as &quot;shaped the cutting edge of modern metalcore.&quot;

==== Melodic metalcore ====
In 2002, Killswitch Engage&#x27;s &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; reached number 37 on the Heatseekers Albums chart. In 2004, Killswitch Engage&#x27;s &quot;The End of Heartache&quot;, Shadows Fall&#x27;s &quot;The War Within&quot;, and Atreyu&#x27;s &quot;The Curse&quot; peaked at numbers 21, 20, and 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, respectively. Also, in 2006, Atreyu&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;A Death-Grip On Yesterday&quot; peaked at number 9 on the Billboard 200, only to be followed up by 2007&#x27;s &quot;Lead Sails Paper Anchor&quot;, which peaked at number 8. Atreyu&#x27;s 2002 debut album &quot;Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses&quot;, as of 3 July 2004, has sold 107,000 copies in the United States.

Killswitch Engage&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot;, as of 3 July 2004, has sold 114,000 copies in the United States. Unearth began to have success among heavy metal fans in 2004 with the release of their second album &quot;The Oncoming Storm&quot;, which peaked at number 1 on the Heatseekers Albums chart on 17 July 2004. On that same day, the album peaked at number 105 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Unearth&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;&quot; peaked at number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Avenged Sevenfold&#x27;s first two albums &quot;Sounding the Seventh Trumpet&quot; (2001) and &quot;Waking the Fallen&quot; (2003) were both metalcore albums. On the band&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;City of Evil&quot;, Avenged Sevenfold moved away from metalcore and changed to a traditional heavy metal sound. On 15 June 2005, &quot;Blabbermouth.net&quot; reported that &quot;Waking the Fallen&quot; has sold 172,253 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

====Diversification====
As the decade progressed, metalcore became increasingly tied to the social media Myspace, launched in 2003, and the scene subculture that was prominent on the platform. Marketing through Myspace launched the careers of many of the era&#x27;s most prominent bands including Bring Me the Horizon, Attack Attack!, Black Veil Brides, Bullet for My Valentine, Job For a Cowboy and Suicide Silence. Despite the stylistic distinctness between many of these groups&#x27; sounds they became encompassed by the terms &quot;myspace-core&quot; and &quot;scene-core&quot;. Many went on to become fixtures at Warped Tour, and Fearless Records&#x27;s &quot;Punk Goes...&quot; cover series.

Deathcore is a fusion of metalcore and death metal. Deathcore is defined by breakdowns, blast beats and death metal riffs. Bands may also incorporate guitar solos and even riffs that are influenced by metalcore. New York-based death metal group Suffocation is credited as one of the main influences for the emergence of deathcore. Embodyments album &quot;Embrace The Eternal&quot; is a foundation for the modern Deathcore sound. Some examples of deathcore bands are Suicide Silence, Whitechapel, Knights of the Abyss, Carnifex and Chelsea Grin.

In 2006 and 2007, a wave of metalcore bands strongly influenced by death metal dubbed deathcore gained moderate popularity. Notable bands that brought the genre to the fore include Bring Me the Horizon and Suicide Silence. Suicide Silence&#x27;s &quot;No Time to Bleed&quot; peaked at number 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number 12 on the Rock Albums Chart and number 6 on the Hard Rock Albums Chart, while their album &quot;The Black Crown&quot; peaked at number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number 7 on the Rock Albums Chart and number 3 on the Hard Rock Albums Chart. After its release, Whitechapel&#x27;s album &quot;This Is Exile&quot; sold 5,900 in copies, which made it enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at position 118. Their self-titled album peaked at number 65 on the Canadian Albums Chart and also at number 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Their third album &quot;A New Era of Corruption&quot; sold about 10,600 copies in the United States in its first week of being released and peaked at position number 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Furthermore, Bring Me the Horizon won the 2006 Kerrang! Awards for Best British Newcomer after they released their 2006 debut record &quot;Count Your Blessings&quot;. However, Bring Me the Horizon abandoned the deathcore genre after the release of this album. San Diego natives Carnifex, witnessed success with their first album &quot;Dead in My Arms&quot;, selling 5,000 copies with little publicity. On top of their non-stop touring and methodical songwriting resulted in Carnifex quickly getting signed to label Victory Records. Lastly, Australian deathcore band Thy Art Is Murder debuted at number 35 on the ARIA Charts with their album &quot;Hate&quot; (2012) making them the first extreme metal band to ever reach the Top 40 of this chart.
Electronicore&#x27;s merger of metalcore with various electronic music styles emerged in the 2000s. One of the earliest contributors to the sound was St Albans band Enter Shikari. Their debut album &quot;Take to the Skies&quot; peaked at number on the Official UK Album Chart selling 28,000 copies in its first week and was certified Gold in the UK after selling over 100,000 copies. It was also the first album to achieve a significant chart success for a new act operating outside the traditional label system. The group received international radio airplay and a substantial number of musical awards, from &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Rock Sound&quot; and the &quot;BT Digital Music Awards&quot;. Their second album &quot;Common Dreads&quot; was released in June 2009 and debuted on the UK Albums Chart at 16. Columbus, Ohio&#x27;s Attack Attack! gained significant notoriety with their Enter Shikari-influenced sound. The band&#x27;s song for &quot;Stick Stickly&quot;, the lead single from &quot;Someday Came Suddenly&quot; (2008) went viral online for its use of autotune and synths, with the members&#x27; squatting &quot;crab walk&quot; stance during the music video giving way to the crabcore meme. Warren, Michigan band I See Stars&#x27;s debut album &quot;3-D&quot; debuted at number 176 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number 5 on Top Heatseekers, and number 22 on Top Independent Albums. The Devil Wears Prada&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;Dead Throne&quot; (which sold 32,400 in its first week) reached number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Asking Alexandria also achieved success, with their 2009 song &quot;Final Episode (Let&#x27;s Change the Channel)&quot; being certified gold by the RIAA. The band&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;Reckless &amp; Relentless&quot; peaked at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In the late 2000s, a wave of groups began to gain traction cross-pollinating the metalcore style of bands like Shai Hulud and Misery Signals, with the influence of traditional hardcore and melodic hardcore groups like Killing the Dream. This wave often made use of serious, solemn lyrics and sometimes clean vocals in addition to the commonplace screams. Music commentators including &quot;Stuff You Will Hate&quot;, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; and Bradley Zorgdrager of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; used the name &quot;serious hardcore&quot; or &quot;srscore&quot; to refer to this style. Groups in this wave included Hundredth, the Ghost Inside, Counterparts and Stick to Your Guns.

=== Continued success: 2010s–present ===
Architects and Bring Me the Horizon spearheaded the British metalcore scene of the late 2000s and early 2010s. Architects had begun as a mathcore band on &quot;Nightmares&quot; (2006) before moving into metalcore by the release of &quot;Ruin&quot; (2007). &quot;Hysteria&quot; magazine credited the band&#x27;s long time vocalist Sam Carter with reviving high pitched screamed vocals in metalcore and &quot;influencing an entire generation of acts such as Polaris, In Hearts Wake, Void of Vision, Invent Animate, Imminence...the list goes on&quot;, as well as popularising the &quot;blegh&quot; adlib, which subsequently became commonplace in the genre. Bring Me the Horizon&#x27;s third album &quot;There Is a Hell Believe Me I&#x27;ve Seen It. There Is a Heaven Let&#x27;s Keep It a Secret.&quot; (2010), saw the band incorporate electronica, classical music and pop music into their metalcore style, a trend then continued further on &quot;Sempiternal&quot; (2013), which also embraced elements of nu metal. The Latter peaked at number 3 on the UK albums chart, and was one of the earliest releases by a UK metalcore band on a major label, through RCA Records. Following this, many bands in the metalcore scene began to emulate the sound these albums. The band&#x27;s massive mainstream success led publications such as &quot;the Guardian&quot; and &quot;the Independent&quot; to accredit them as &quot;the new Metallica&quot;, and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; writer Stephen Hill to call &quot;Sempiternal&quot; &quot;this generation&#x27;s definitive metal album&quot;.

The nu metal elements present on &quot;Sempiternal&quot;, as well as Suicide Silence&#x27;s &quot;The Black Crown&quot; (2012), led to a wave of bands in the mid-2010s taking influence from nu metal. My Ticket Home&#x27;s &quot;Strangers Only&quot; (2013) was a notable precedent of this wave, seeing a previously established metalcore act merge their style with dark, nu metal influence to help establish the coming nu metalcore sound. Issues&#x27; merger of nu metal, metalcore and contemporary R&amp;B gained them significant commercial success, with a number of publications crediting them as ushering a new wave of nu metal. Their debut self-titled album (2014) peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; chart and their second album &quot;Headspace&quot; (2016) reached number one on the &quot;Top Alternative Albums&quot; chart.
Furthermore, Bring Me the Horizon&#x27;s fifth album &quot;That&#x27;s the Spirit&quot; (2015) saw the band fully embrace nu metal, which peaked at number 2 in both the UK and US. In the following years Emmure, Of Mice &amp; Men, Sworn In and DangerKids had all embraced the genre, and by 2016, nu metalcore had solidified itself as a movement.
Architect&#x27;s &quot;All Our Gods Have Abandoned Us&quot; (2016) was released to critical acclaim, with &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; writer Stephen Hill called it &quot;as close to a perfect metal record as one can imagine&quot;. The following year, they released the single &quot;Doomsday&quot;, their first release since the death of the band&#x27;s founding guitarist Tom Searle. In the years following the single&#x27;s release, the song&#x27;s sound became widely imitated within the metalcore scene, particularly the song&#x27;s introduction guitar riff.

As the decade drew to a close, a new wave of bands in the genre emerged who harkened back to the metallic hardcore sound of bands from the 1990s. Vein.fm, Code Orange, Knocked Loose, Varials, Jesus Piece, Counterparts and Kublai Khan were all notable groups who gained significant success within the genre at the time. Code Orange saw critical acclaim and success with their Roadrunner Records debut &quot;Forever&quot; in 2017. Forever&#x27;s title track was also nominated Grammy for Best Metal Performance in 2018. It too embraced the influence of nu metal and according to &quot;PopMatters&quot; writer Ethan Stewart, led to nu metalcore becoming &quot;one of the most prominent flavors of contemporary metal&quot;. Knocked Loose gained significant attention after their song &quot;Counting Worms&quot; from their album &quot;Laugh Tracks&quot; (2016) became a meme due to its &quot;arf arf&quot; mosh call. The band&#x27;s 2019 second album &quot;A Different Shade of Blue&quot; also received critical and commercial success.

Nu metalcore maintained its prominence into the 2020s with Tetrarch and Tallah gaining notability. Loathe&#x27;s second album &quot;I Let It In and It Took Everything&quot; (2020) saw critical acclaim, and was consistently praised for expanding the scope of metalcore by incorporating elements of nu metal, shoegaze, emo, post-rock, progressive metal and industrial music. The band&#x27;s use of the Fender Bass VI guitar, which tunes to an octave below a standard tuning guitar, became widely sought after following the album&#x27;s release. Publications credited Spiritbox similarly with &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; calling them &quot;post-metalcore&quot; and &quot;genre-fluid&quot;. The band&#x27;s 2020 single &quot;Holy Roller&quot; reached the Top 40 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, and their debut album &quot;Eternal Blue&quot; was named the year&#x27;s best rock or metal album by &quot;Loudwire&quot; and metalcore album by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;.

Around the same time, a number of bands gained prominence in the scene that revived the sound of groups from the mid-to-late-2000s, fronted by Static Dress, SeeYouSpaceCowboy, If I Die First and CrazyEightyEight. This movement grew out of both the hardcore scene and the mainstream success that the emo rap scene gained the late-2010s.

Formed in 2015, Bad Omens&#x27; third album &quot;The Death of Peace of Mind&quot; (2022) was the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough after viral success of the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Just Pretend&quot; on TikTok which then topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart. By March 2023, the album had received 20 million streams on Spotify, leading to &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; calling them &quot;the biggest metalcore band in a generation.&quot; Bring Me the Horizon&#x27;s &quot;Post Human: Survival Horror&quot; (2020) and Architects&#x27; &quot;For Those That Wish to Exist&quot; (2021) both also reached number one in the UK album charts.

==Criticism==
Several journalists have noted that metalcore earned a &quot;bad rep&quot; after several bands in the genre found commercial success or released albums with polished production values. Several bands labelled as metalcore have rejected the term entirely. Additionally, many of the genre&#x27;s more commercially successful acts have abandoned their metalcore roots entirely, such as Asking Alexandria, Of Mice &amp; Men and Bring Me the Horizon. According to Andrew Sacher of &quot;Brooklyn Vegan&quot;, &quot;the mainstream boom tarnished the word &#x27;metalcore&#x27; for a while.&quot; Renounced vocalist Daniel Gray stated, &quot;Modern metalcore has been bastardised into garbage [...] we were influenced by bands like Martyr AD, Poison The Well and Turmoil etc. To Renounced, that’s what true metalcore is. It has been suggested that the genre&#x27;s use of clean vocals, comparable to the likes of the commercial emo and pop-punk music of the 2000s, may have turned away some fans of heavier music styles. There has been pushback from purists in the heavy metal community over whether metalcore is a true heavy metal subgenre. There is also debate among some regarding whether metalcore is a fusion genre, a subgenre, or a genre of its own.

<doc id="636693" wikidata="Q3093501" url="?curid=636693" title="Gabby Hartnett">
<text>Charles Leo &quot;Gabby&quot; Hartnett (December 20, 1900 – December 20, 1972), also nicknamed &quot;Old Tomato Face&quot;, was an American professional baseball player and manager. He played almost his entire career in Major League Baseball as a catcher with the Chicago Cubs, from 1922 to 1940. He spent the final season of his career as a player-coach with the New York Giants in 1941. After his playing career, Hartnett continued his involvement in baseball as a coach and as a minor league manager.

Hartnett was an all-around player, performing well both offensively and defensively. Known for his strong and accurate throwing arm, he routinely led the National League&#x27;s catchers in caught stealing percentage and was the first major league catcher to hit more than 20 home runs in a season. During the course of his career, Hartnett took part in some of the more memorable events in Major League Baseball history including: being behind the plate for Babe Ruth allegedly calling his shot during the 1932 World Series, Carl Hubbell&#x27;s strike-out performance in the 1934 All-Star Game and Dizzy Dean&#x27;s career-altering injury during the 1937 All-Star Game. However, the greatest moment of Hartnett&#x27;s career came with one week left in the 1938 season, when he hit a game-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to put the Cubs in first place. The event, which occurred as darkness descended onto Wrigley Field, became immortalized as the &quot;Homer in the Gloamin&#x27;&quot;.

Prior to Johnny Bench, Hartnett was considered the greatest catcher in the history of the National League. A six-time All-Star, he appeared in four World Series during his playing career. At the time of his retirement, Hartnett held the career records for catchers in home runs, runs batted in, hits, doubles and most games played as a catcher. Hartnett was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Hartnett was born in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, as the eldest of 14 children. His father moved the family to Millville, Massachusetts, just over the state line from Woonsocket, when he took a job at Banigan&#x27;s Millville Rubber Shop. He began his professional baseball career at the age of 20 with the Worcester Boosters of the Eastern League in 1921. New York Giants manager John McGraw sent scout Jesse Burkett to appraise Hartnett&#x27;s talent as a player. Burkett reported back to McGraw that Hartnett&#x27;s hands were too small for a major league catcher.

===Professional career===
Hartnett joined the Cubs in 1922, serving as a backup catcher to Bob O&#x27;Farrell. He was given his ironic nickname of &quot;Gabby&quot; as a rookie due to his shy, reticent nature. On July 22, O&#x27;Farrell suffered a fractured skull during a game against the Boston Braves and Hartnett took over as the Cubs starting catcher, posting a .299 batting average along with 16 home runs and 67 runs batted in. After the retirement of catcher Bill Killefer, Hartnett became the favorite catcher of Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander and caught Alexander&#x27;s 300th career win on September 20, 1924. Hartnett played well enough during O&#x27;Farrell&#x27;s absence the Cubs decided to keep him as their starting catcher, trading O&#x27;Farrell to the St. Louis Cardinals in May 1925.

===Rise to stardom===

Hartnett hit 24 home runs in 1925, breaking the single-season home run record for catchers set by Jack Clements in 1893. He finished second overall in the National League behind the 39 home runs hit by Rogers Hornsby. Although Hartnett led National League catchers in errors, he also led in range factor and in putouts, while his strong throwing arm helped him lead the league in assists and caught stealing percentage. Leo Durocher, who played against Hartnett and was a National League manager during Johnny Bench&#x27;s career, stated that the two catchers had similarly strong throwing arms. During the major league baseball winter meetings in December 1925, it was rumored Hartnett might be traded to the New York Giants for catcher Frank Snyder and outfielder Irish Meusel; however, Cubs president Bill Veeck Sr., squelched the rumors saying Hartnett would not be traded for anybody.

The young catcher had a disappointing year in 1926 as his batting average dropped to .275 with only 41 runs batted in. Hartnett&#x27;s offensive statistics rebounded in 1927, producing a .294 batting average with 10 home runs and 80 runs batted in. Although he led the league&#x27;s catchers in putouts, assists and in baserunners caught stealing, his inexperience showed as he also led the league in errors and in passed balls. He finished tenth in the balloting for the 1927 National League Most Valuable Player Award.

===Career prime===
In 1928, Hartnett hit above .300 for the first time, posting a .302 batting average with 14 home runs. He also surpassed Jack Clements&#x27; major league record of 72 career home runs by a catcher. Hartnett also led National League catchers in assists, caught stealing percentage and in fielding percentage. As he matured as a player, he became more disciplined on the field and committed fewer errors. He threw the baseball around the infield in a fearless manner, throwing out baserunners with a high degree of accuracy. Between 1928 and 1938, Hartnett led the league&#x27;s catchers in fielding percentage seven times.

In 1929, Hartnett injured his throwing arm by making a hard throw without warming up. The arm ailment limited him to one game behind the plate and 24 games as a pinch hitter as the Cubs won the National League pennant. Hartnett struck out in all three of his at bats in the 1929 World Series against the Philadelphia Athletics. He rebounded with his best season in 1930, hitting for a .339 batting average with career highs of 122 runs batted in, a .630 slugging percentage and 37 home runs, breaking his own single-season home run record for catchers. Hartnett led all National League catchers in putouts, assists, fielding percentage and in baserunners caught stealing. His single-season home run record for catchers stood for 23 years, until Roy Campanella hit 40 home runs in 1953.

In a stunt on April 1, 1930 in Los Angeles, he caught a baseball dropped either from a Goodyear blimp. If dropped from 800 feet, it would have been traveling at the time it was caught.

During an exhibition game against the Chicago White Sox on September 9, 1931, Hartnett was photographed while signing an autograph for gangster Al Capone. After the photograph was published in newspapers across the United States, Hartnett received a telegram from Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis instructing him not to have his photograph taken with Capone in the future. Hartnett replied with a telegram to the Commissioner whimsically stating, &quot;OK, but if you don&#x27;t want me to have my picture taken with Al Capone, you tell him.&quot;
In 1932, Hartnett guided the Cubs&#x27; pitching staff to the lowest team earned run average in the league, as the Cubs clinched the National League pennant by 4 games over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Hartnett was the Cubs&#x27; catcher on October 1, in Game 3 of the 1932 World Series against the New York Yankees when Babe Ruth hit his debated &quot;called shot.&quot; Although he hit for a .313 batting average with 1 home run, the Yankees won the series in a four-game sweep.

In 1933, Hartnett was selected to be a reserve catcher for the National League team in the inaugural Major League Baseball All-Star Game held on July 6, 1933. It was the first of six consecutive All-Star game selections for Hartnett. At the mid-season point of the 1934 season, Hartnett was hitting for a .336 batting average with 13 home runs to earn the starting catcher&#x27;s role for the National League team in the 1934 All-Star Game. Hartnett was calling the pitches for Carl Hubbell in the 1934 All-Star Game when the Giants pitcher set a record by striking out future Hall of Fame members Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons, and Joe Cronin in succession. Hartnett ended the 1934 season with another strong offensive performance, hitting for a .299 batting average with 22 home runs and 90 runs batted in. He dominated the defensive statistics, leading the league&#x27;s catchers in assists, putouts, baserunners caught stealing, caught stealing percentage, range factor and in fielding percentage.

Hartnett had another impressive season in 1935 when he produced a .344 batting average, third-highest in the league and led the league&#x27;s catchers in assists, double plays, and fielding percentage. He also led the Cubs pitching staff to the lowest earned run average in the league as they won the National League pennant by 4 games over the St. Louis Cardinals. For his performance, Hartnett was named the recipient of the 1935 National League Most Valuable Player Award. The Cubs lost to the Detroit Tigers led by Mickey Cochrane in the 1935 World Series.

The Cubs fell to third place in 1936, as Hartnett had a sub-standard year for him, hitting only 7 home runs with 64 runs batted in, although he still hit above .300 with a .307 average, and earned his fourth consecutive All-Star selection. Defensively, he led the league&#x27;s catchers in fielding percentage, and his pitch-calling skills helped the Cubs pitching staff lead the league with 18 shutouts. In the 1937 All-Star Game, pitcher Dizzy Dean kept shaking off Hartnett&#x27;s signs for a curve ball resulting in a hit by Joe DiMaggio, a home run by Lou Gehrig and finally, a line drive off the bat of Earl Averill that struck Dean on his toe. Dean had been one of the preeminent pitchers in the National League until the injury to his toe eventually led to the end of his baseball playing career. Hartnett ended the 1937 season with a career-high .354 batting average and finished second to Joe Medwick in voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award. His .354 batting average in 1937 was the highest batting average by a major league catcher for 60 years until 1997, when Mike Piazza posted a .362 average.

===Homer in the Gloamin&#x27;===
On July 20, 1938, Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley named the 37-year-old Hartnett as the team&#x27;s player-manager, replacing Charlie Grimm. When Hartnett took over as manager, the Cubs had been in third place, six games behind the first place Pittsburgh Pirates led by Pie Traynor. By September 27, with one week left in the season, the Cubs had battled back to within a game and a half game of the Pirates in the National League standings as the two teams met for a crucial three-game series. The Cubs won the first game of the series with a 2–1 victory by pitcher Dizzy Dean, cutting the Pirates&#x27; lead to a half game and setting the stage for one of baseball&#x27;s most memorable moments.

On September 28, 1938, the two teams met for the second game of the series, where Hartnett experienced the highlight of his career. With darkness descending on the lightless Wrigley Field and the score tied at 5 runs apiece, the umpires ruled that the ninth inning would be the last to be played. The entire game would have to be replayed the following day if the score remained tied. Hartnett came to bat with two out in the bottom of the ninth inning. With a count of 0 balls and 2 strikes, Hartnett connected on a Mace Brown pitch, launching the ball into the darkness, before it eventually landed in the left-center field bleachers. The stadium erupted into pandemonium as players and fans stormed the field to escort Hartnett around the bases. Hartnett&#x27;s walk-off home run became immortalized as the &quot;Homer in the Gloamin&#x27;&quot;.

The Cubs were in first place, culminating an impressive 19-3-1 record in September, and the pennant was clinched three days later. Hartnett once again led the Cubs pitching staff to the lowest earned run average in the league and led National League catchers with a .995 fielding percentage. However, the Cubs were swept in the 1938 World Series by the New York Yankees, their fourth Series loss in ten years.

===Later career===
Hartnett felt the strain of managing a team during the 1939 season as he faced player discontent over the pampering of Dizzy Dean while pitcher Larry French went over his head to complain to owner Philip Wrigley about his lack of pitching assignments. French felt he was being punished for requesting to have Gus Mancuso as his catcher. In addition, Hartnett was forced to pencil himself into the lineup more often because the Cubs&#x27; other catchers had little luck at the plate. On August 28, 1939, he broke Ray Schalk&#x27;s major league record of 1,727 career games as a catcher. His record for longevity was surpassed by Al López during the 1945 season.

After two disappointing seasons, Hartnett was dismissed by the Cubs on November 13, 1940, after 19 years with the club. On December 3, he signed a contract with the New York Giants to be a player-coach. Hartnett hit for a .300 average in 64 games as a backup catcher to Harry Danning in the 1941 season. Hartnett played his final game on September 24, 1941, retiring as a player at the age of 40.

==Career statistics==
In a 20-year major league career, Hartnett played in 1,990 games, accumulating 1,912 hits in 6,432 at bats for a .297 career batting average along with 867 runs, 396 doubles, 64 triples, 236 home runs, 1,179 runs batted in, 703 bases on balls, .370 on-base percentage and .489 slugging percentage. He retired with a .984 career fielding percentage. Hartnett caught 100 or more games for a league record 12 times, including a record eight seasons in a row. He led the National League in putouts four times and in assists and fielding percentage six times. Hartnett led the league seven times in double plays and set a National league record with 163 career double plays. He set a since-broken major league record for catchers of 452 consecutive chances without committing an error.

At the time of his retirement, Hartnett&#x27;s 236 home runs, 1,179 runs batted in, 1,912 hits, and 396 doubles were all records for catchers. Bill Dickey surpassed his records for most runs batted in and hits in 1943, while his career home run record for catchers was broken by Yogi Berra in 1956. His career mark for doubles stood until 1983 when it was broken by Ted Simmons. Hartnett also finished among the National League&#x27;s top ten in slugging percentage seven times in his career. A six-time All-Star, he was the recipient of one Most Valuable Player Award and played on four pennant-winning teams. Hartnett&#x27;s .370 career on-base percentage was higher than the .342 posted by Johnny Bench and the .348 posted by Yogi Berra. His 56.11% career caught stealing percentage ranks second to Roy Campanella among major league catchers. Hartnett&#x27;s bat and catcher&#x27;s mask were the first artifacts sent to the newly constructed Baseball Hall of Fame in 1938. In his book, &quot;The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, baseball historian Bill James ranked Hartnett 9th all-time among major league catchers.


==Post-playing career and retirement==
Afterwards, Hartnett managed in the minor leagues for five seasons, retiring to Lincolnwood, Illinois, in 1946. On January 26, 1955, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame along with Joe DiMaggio, Ted Lyons and Dazzy Vance. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included Hartnett in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. In 1999, he was named as a finalist to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

Hartnett also served as a color commentator for CBS&#x27; Major League Baseball telecasts. Hartnett in particular, alongside Bob Finnegan called the April 11, 1959, contest between Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs and the June 12, 1960, contest between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Cubs.

In his last job in the majors Hartnett worked as a coach and scout with the Kansas City Athletics for two years in the mid-1960s.

Hartnett died of cirrhosis in Park Ridge, Illinois, on his 72nd birthday in 1972, and is interred in All Saints Cemetery in Des Plaines, Illinois.

<text>The Federal Academy for Security Policy (, BAKS) is the Federal Republic of Germany’s interministerial institution for advanced studies, education and training in security policy in the remit of the Federal Ministry of Defence. It has its seat in a complex of buildings on the premises of Schönhausen Palace in Berlin-Niederschönhausen, which was built in the 1950s for the former East German Government.

==Tasks and objectives==
The Federal Academy for Security Policy is responsible for providing comprehensive advanced training beyond ministerial bounds for current and future executive personnel both from federal and state institutions and from private sectors of relevance to security policy. It covers all areas of security policy and government and personal action. It is also responsible for establishing a network between the above groups of people. The Federal Academy for Security Policy sees itself as a forum for discussing security policy interests and in this function it supports Germany’s role within the international community and international organisations of all kinds, with the objective of establishing a consensus in security policy issues.

The core event of the academy’s programme is its annual six-month Senior Course on Security Policy which is attended by about thirty people from federal and states ministries, the business sector and the scientific community. It is sometimes also attended by people from foreign ministries and supranational organisations.

==History==

In the mid-1980s, debate arose about the establishment of a national training institution for discussing and disseminating information on security policy issues similar to institutes that already existed in other countries (such as the National Defense University in Washington, the Institut des Hautes Etudes de Défense Nationale in Paris or the Royal College of Defence Studies in London).

In the summer of 1987, the Federal Security Council for the first time discussed the possibility of establishing such an institution and formulated the following fundamental requirements:
* “Germany’s many and varied international commitments raise the need for professionally trained executive personnel who are capable of representing national interests effectively at international level.”
* “This requires security policy and a general strategy to extend beyond the bounds of the ministries and be based on a common understanding of national German interests.”
* “Acceptance of Germany’s security policy by the general public is a vital element of security itself. The intensified public debate on security issues requires competent executive personnel within the government, the business sector, the scientific community and the media who are able to take the necessary lead in the formation of opinion.”
* “The wish for increased cooperation on security issues with our European allies demands German officials and officers to undergo international standard preparatory training at national level.”

An interministerial committee then addressed the issue and recommended the establishment of an appropriate institution for meeting these fundamental requirements. In 1988, the Federal Security Council endorsed the recommendation of the committee and commissioned it to draw up a curriculum for the institution, which was approved by the committee in the summer of 1989.

In February 1990, the Federal Security Council approved the curriculum, deciding to establish an institution within the remit of the Federal Ministry of Defence. In the summer of that year, the Federal Cabinet agreed on the establishment of the Federal Academy for Security Policy and the Federal Security Council was to form the Board of Trustees of the academy.

The academy began its work in 1992, its first president being Admiral (ret.) Dieter Wellershoff, at its temporary home, the “Rosenburg” in Bonn. At the same time, an advisory board was established to assist the academy in its work, primarily by issuing recommendations regarding its curriculum.

On the recommendation of the Advisory Board and the academy, the board of trustees in 2002 decided to permanently relocate the institution to Berlin. Following extensive building and restoration work, the college moved into its new building on the premises of Schönhausen Palace in Berlin Pankow in March 2004.

Since March 2004, the Federal Academy for Security Policy has been located in its own complex, featuring auditoriums, conference rooms and offices, nestled in the park of the premises of Schönhausen Palace in Berlin Pankow.

==Organisation and Staff==

The Federal Foreign Office and the Federal Ministry of Defence take turns in nominating the president and vice president of the Federal Academy for Security Policy. In addition to the presidency, the Federal Academy for Security Policy consists of an Academic Department and a Supporting Department. The academic staff comes from the ministries represented in the Federal Security Council (the Federal Foreign Office, the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Federal Ministry of Justice, the Federal Ministry of Finance, the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology, the Federal Ministry of Defence and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development). The support staff comes from the Federal Ministry of Defence.

The Federal Academy’s Board of Trustees is made up of the members of the Federal Security Council and chaired by the Federal Chancellor and decides on general issues concerning teaching practices and activities at the college. An Advisory Board issues recommendations to the Board of Trustees regarding the college’s curriculum.

;Presidents
==Publications==
The Federal Academy for Security Policy releases publications on security issues and awards the Karl Carstens Prize, which was named after the former Federal President Carstens. The prize is awarded to people who have rendered outstanding services in promoting security policy matters within the German-speaking area as well as conveying security policy issues to the public on a broad scale&quot;. The prize is awarded on a rotational basis with the Manfred Wörner speech. Its aim is to uphold the tradition of Memorial Speeches and honour the former Federal Minister of Defence and NATO Secretary General Manfred Wörner as well as to promote the discourse on security policy. A second supplementary issue of the compendium “New dimensions in security policy” was published by the Mittler Verlag in June 2009. In addition, the attendees of the Senior Course on Security Policy each year develop a thesis on specific security policy issues for the Federal Chancellery. In 2010, the title of this so-called General Seminar Task was “European Security and Russia – Options from the German Perspective”.

<doc id="636698" wikidata="Q1822238" url="?curid=636698" title="Lex Aquilia">
<text>The lex Aquilia was a Roman law which provided compensation to the owners of property injured by someone&#x27;s fault, set in the 3rd century BC, in the Roman Republic. This law protected Roman citizens from some forms of theft, vandalism, and destruction of property.

== The provisions of the Lex Aquilia ==
The &quot;lex Aquilia&quot; (strictly, a plebiscite) was possibly enacted in 286 BC, or at some other point in the 3rd century BC. It was concerned with damage done from &quot;damnum iniuria datum&quot;, &quot;damage unlawfully inflicted&quot;, a kind of a delict (or tort), albeit with differences from tort as known in modern common law systems and the Scots Law of Delict. The most pertinent provisions were in the first and third chapters of the law.

Only a limited subset of torts was included in the law as enacted. The first section stated that someone who unlawfully, or wrongfully as it later became known, killed another man&#x27;s slaves or herd animal (&quot;pecus&quot;) should pay the owner the highest value that the slave or the beast had over the past year.

:Ut qui servum servamve alienum alienamve quadrupedem vel pecudem iniuria occiderit, quanti id in eo anno plurimi fuit, tantum aes dare domino damnas esto. [D. 9.2.2.pr]

:If anyone wrongfully kills another&#x27;s male or female slave or four-footed herd animal, let him be ordered to pay the owner whatever its highest value was in the preceding year.

According to Gaius&#x27;s Institutes, the second chapter of the lex covered the following scenario:

:By the second head an action is established to recover the amount against the adstipulator, who, in fraud of the stipulator, has formally released a debt. [G3.215]

It is clear from the Institutes of Justinian that the second chapter was no longer in force by the 5th century AD[I4.3.12]. Additionally, the only other mention which we find of the second chapter within the Digest is the following short extract:

:Ulpianus 18 ad ed. Huius legis secundum quidem capitulum in desuetudinem abiit.

:Ulpian: The second chapter of the lex has fallen out of use.

Therefore, it is clear that by the time of the Classical juristic writing the second chapter was legally defunct. The sheer lack of textual commentary implies that this occurrence came about very soon after the formulation of the lex in the Republic, and the quotation from Gaius regarding recovery of fraudulently expunged debts does not seem to rest easily with the extant chapters (dealing which varying degrees of property damage).

The third chapter concerned the wrongful &quot;burning, breaking or rending&quot; (&quot;urere, frangere, rumpere&quot;) not only of slaves and cattle but also other property:

:Ceterarum rerum praeter hominem et pecudem occisos si quis alteri damnum faxit, quod usserit fregerit ruperit iniuria, quanti ea res fuit in diebus triginta proximis, tantum aes domino dare damnas esto. [D. 9.2.27.5]

:As regards things other than men and cattle which have been killed, if any one does damage to another, and unlawfully burns, breaks, or ruptures something, let him be ordered to pay its owner whatever that thing is worth in the nearest thirty days.

Note that &quot;rumpere&quot; (rupture) was generally understood as &quot;corrumpere&quot; (spoil), and thus came to encompass a very large number of different sorts of damage. Some difficulty surrounds the use of the verb &#x27;fuit&#x27;, generally taken to indicate the perfect tense. However, an alternative translation of the text suggests that the provision might, in fact, be prospective. In practice, this would mean that the aggrieved party would be entitled to monetary compensation equal to the diminution in value of the article which suffered damage.

Although Lex Aquilia applied only where damage was unlawfully caused, this requirement was satisfied wherever a person was neglectful or acting intentionally. It did, however, require direct causation. There was an exception to wrongfulness, though. If an act could be proven to be justified (which jurists disagreed on when exactly this was), it was not wrongful, such as in cases of self-defense.

The &quot;Lex Aquilia&quot; could not force a rent object, slain slave, or herd animal to be replaced; it could only demand monetary compensation. If liability was denied but found by the &quot;iudex&quot; anyway, the compensation was doubled.

== Dating of the Lex Aquilia==

The exact date of enactment of the Lex is a topic of much debate and no incontestable theory has been put forward. One view that has attracted some support is that it was enacted around 287/286 BC immediately following the enactment of the &quot;Lex Hortensia&quot;, which gave plebiscites the ability to bind the whole people without ratification of the Senate for the first time. On this view then, the essential purpose of the Lex was to address Plebeian grievances against the Patrician elite during a politically tumultuous period by giving them a more equitable and comprehensive set of remedies. This derives mainly from Byzantine jurisprudence, particularly the work of the Byzantine jurist Theophilus, whose work puts the enactment of the Lex at around this period. He mentions this incidentally in his work and therefore the extent to which his account is accurate has been considered suspect.

A second view puts the date of enactment at around 200 BC. On this line of reasoning, the Lex was enacted as a response to heavy inflation following the Second Punic War and was thus necessitated by a need to eschew an assessment of damages based on fixed penalties. However, it has been suggested that the Romans may well have required the flexible assessment of damages offered by the Lex, or at least the third chapter, before this date. 

Another suggestion is that around 259 BC, a consul named Aquillius also a tribune of the Plebs.

==Extension of the Lex Aquilia to other cases==
The statute was in its terms rather narrow. For instance, the first chapter only applied where the killing had taken place directly (&quot;corpori corpore&quot;: on the body of the victim by the body of the perpetrator). It gave a remedy only to a citizen. It gave a remedy only to the strict legal owner (&quot;dominus&quot;) not to people with lesser rights of ownership. However, if an act was not directly caused or the damage inflicted a loss on someone other than the owner, an &quot;in factum&quot; action could be brought against the person who inflicted damage.

<doc id="636702" wikidata="Q6824349" url="?curid=636702" title="Metrication in the United States">
<text>Metrication is the process of introducing the International System of Units, also known as SI units or the metric system, to replace a jurisdiction&#x27;s traditional measuring units. U.S. customary units have been defined in terms of metric units since the 19th century, and the SI has been the &quot;preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce&quot; since 1975 according to United States law. However, conversion was not mandatory and many industries chose not to convert, and U.S. customary units remain in common use in many industries as well as in governmental use (for example, speed limits are still posted in miles per hour). There is government policy and metric (SI) program to implement and assist with metrication; however, there is major social resistance to further metrication.

In the U.S., the SI system is used extensively in fields such as science, medicine, electronics, the military, automobile production and repair, and international affairs. US uses metric in money (100 cents), photography (35mm film, 50mm lens), medicine (1cc of drug), nutrition labels (grams of fat), bottles of soft drink (liter), volume displaycement in engines (liters). In 3 domains, cooking/baking, distance, and temperature, customary units are used more often than metric units. Post-1994 federal law also mandates most packaged consumer goods be labeled in both customary and metric units.

The U.S. has fully adopted the SI unit for time, the second. The U.S. has a national policy to adopt the metric system. All U.S. agencies are required to adopt the metric system.

==History==

===18th century===

Immediately after gaining independence from Great Britain, the United States used a variety of units of measure, including Dutch units and English units. The 1789 Constitution grants Congress the authority to determine standards of measure, though it did not immediately use this authority to impose a uniform system. The United States was one of the first nations to adopt a decimal currency, under the Coinage Act of 1792.

In 1793, Thomas Jefferson requested artifacts from France that could be used to adopt the metric system in the United States, and Joseph Dombey was sent from France with a standard kilogram. Before reaching the United States, Dombey&#x27;s ship was blown off course by a storm and captured by pirates, and he died in captivity on Montserrat.

===19th century===

In 1832, the customary system of units was formalized.
In the early 19th century, the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, the government&#x27;s surveying and map-making agency, used a physical meter standard, the &quot;Committee Meter&quot;, brought from Switzerland. Shortly after the American Civil War, the 39th United States Congress protected the use of the metric system in commerce with the Metric Act of 1866 and supplied each state with a set of standard metric weights and measures.

In 1875, the United States solidified its commitment to the development of the internationally recognized metric system by becoming one of the original seventeen signatory nations to the Metre Convention, also known as the Treaty of the Metre. The signing of this international agreement concluded five years of meetings in which the metric system was reformulated, refining the accuracy of its standards. The Metre Convention established the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (Bureau international des poids et mesures, BIPM) in Sèvres, France, to provide standards of measurement for worldwide use.

Under the Mendenhall Order of 1893, metric standards, developed through international cooperation under the auspices of BIPM, were officially adopted as the fundamental standards for length and mass in the United States, though some metric standards were used in practice before then. The definitions of United States customary units, such as the foot and pound, have been based on metric units since then.

The 1895 Constitution of Utah, in Article X, Section 11, originally mandated that: &quot;The Metric System shall be taught in the public schools of the State.&quot; This section was repealed, effective July 1, 1987.

On July 4, 1876, Melvil Dewey (known for his Dewey Decimal Classification) incorporated the American Metric Bureau in Boston to sell rulers and other metric measuring tools. Dewey had hoped to make his fortune selling metric supplies.

===20th century===
The General Conference on Weights and Measures is the governing body for the modern metric system and comprises the signing nations of the Treaty of the Metre. The General Conference on Weights and Measures approved an updated version of the metric system in 1960 named &quot;Le Système international d&#x27;unités&quot; (&quot;International System of Units&quot;) and abbreviated &quot;SI&quot;.

On February 10, 1964, the National Bureau of Standards (now known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology) issued a statement that it would use the metric system, except where this would have an obvious detrimental effect.

In 1968, Congress authorized the U.S. Metric Study, a three-year study of systems of measurement in the United States, with emphasis on the feasibility of metrication. The United States Department of Commerce conducted the study. A 45-member advisory panel consulted and took testimony from hundreds of consumers, business organizations, labor groups, manufacturers, and state and local officials. The final report of the study concluded that the U.S. would eventually join the rest of the world in the use of the metric system of measurement. The study found that metric units were already implemented in many areas and that their use was increasing. The majority of study participants believed that conversion to the metric system was in the best interests of the United States, particularly in view of the importance of foreign trade and the increasing influence of technology in the United States.

The U.S. Metric Study recommended that the United States implement a carefully planned transition to the principal use of the metric system over a decade. Congress passed the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 &quot;to coordinate and plan the increasing use of the metric system in the United States&quot;. Voluntary conversion was initiated, and the United States Metric Board (USMB) was established for planning, coordination, and public education. The public education component led to public awareness of the metric system, but the public response included resistance, apathy, and confusion. In 1981, the USMB reported to Congress that it lacked the clear Congressional mandate necessary to bring about national conversion. Because of this ineffectiveness and an effort of the Reagan administration—particularly from Lyn Nofziger&#x27;s efforts as a White House advisor to the Reagan administration, to reduce federal spending—the USMB was disbanded in the autumn of 1982.
The ending of the USMB increased doubts that metrication would really be implemented. Public and private sector metrication slowed even while competitiveness between nations and demands of global marketplaces increased.

The American National Metric Council (ANMC) was established in 1973 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as a non-profit, tax-exempt organization for planning and coordinating metric activity in all sectors of the U.S. economy. The ANMC became a separately incorporated organization in 1976. The ANMC was intended to facilitate U.S. metrication by maintaining a voluntary and orderly process that minimizes costs and maximizes benefits, and to provide information, forums, individual assistance, and other services for its subscribers.

The ANMC attempted to coordinate the metric planning of many industrial sectors, unlike the USMB, which only attempted to implement the policy set forth in the Metric Conversion Act of 1975. After the formation of the USMB, committees of the ANMC submitted conversion plans for the chemical sector and for the instruments sector. These sector conversion plans were later approved by the USMB. From 1975 through 1987, the ANMC held a series of well-attended annual conferences. Subsequently, a series of National Metric Conferences, jointly sponsored by the ANMC, the U.S. Metric Association (USMA), the Department of Commerce, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), were held from 1989 through 1993.
Congress included new encouragement for U.S. industrial metrication in the Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. This legislation amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 and designated the metric system as &quot;the Preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce&quot;. The legislation states that the federal government has a responsibility to assist industry, especially small business, as it voluntarily converts to the metric system of measurement. The legislation required most federal agencies to use the metric system in their procurement, grants, and other business-related activities by the end of 1992.

While not mandating metric use in the private sector, the federal government has sought to serve as a catalyst in the metric conversion of the country&#x27;s trade, industry, and commerce. Exceptions were made for the highway and construction industries. The Department of Transportation planned to require metric units by 2000, but this plan was canceled by the 1998 highway bill TEA21. The U.S. military has generally high use of the metric system, partly because of the need to work with other nations&#x27; militaries.

, signed by President George H. W. Bush on July 25, 1991, citing the Metric Conversion Act, directed departments and agencies within the executive branch of the United States Government to &quot;take all appropriate measures within their authority&quot; to use the metric system &quot;as the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce&quot;, and authorized the Secretary of Commerce &quot;to charter an Interagency Council on Metric Policy (&quot;ICMP&quot;), which will assist the Secretary in coordinating Federal Government-wide implementation of this order.&quot;

Some members of Congress attempted to ban use of the metric system on federal highways in 1992 and 1993. These bills were not popular in the House of Representatives and failed before a vote.

The use of two different unit systems caused the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter on September 23, 1999. NASA specified metric units in the contract. NASA and other organizations applied metric units in their work, but one subcontractor, Lockheed Martin, provided software that calculated and reported thruster performance data to the team in pound-force-seconds, rather than the expected newton-seconds. The spacecraft was intended to orbit Mars at about altitude, but incorrect data caused it to descend instead to about , burning up in the Martian atmosphere.

===21st century===

The effort toward national metrication is based on the premise that the U.S. industrial and commercial productivity, mathematics, and science education, and the competitiveness of its products and services in world markets would be enhanced by adopting the metric system. Gerard Iannelli, director of the U.S. Metric Program, gave the opinion that Americans have so far not done so because of the effort it takes to &quot;translate&quot; from customary to metric units when both measurements are not shown. He also cited what he perceived to be ineffective attempts at public education and awareness.

In June 2010, NIST called for an amendment to the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act that would allow manufacturers the option to voluntarily label their packages solely in metric units, rather than being dual-labeled with U.S. customary units and metric units as is currently required. The goal of these changes would be to encourage metric labeling, leading to greater agreement of U.S. labeling laws and simplifying domestic and international commerce. NIST Metric Program coordinator Elizabeth Gentry added that the proposed changes were &quot;in response to requests by U.S. manufacturers and consumers&quot;, particularly that &quot;manufacturers want to take control of the limited net quantity of contents real estate on their packaging.&quot;

In December 2012, a petition was created on the White House&#x27;s petitioning system, petitioning the White House to &quot;Make the Metric system the standard in the United States, instead of the Imperial system.&quot; On January 10, 2013, this petition garnered over 25,000 signatures, exceeding the, at the time, threshold needed to require the Obama Administration to officially respond to the petition. Patrick D. Gallagher, director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, provided the official response stating that customary units were defined in the metric system, thus making the nation &quot;bilingual&quot; in terms of measurement systems. Gallagher also said that using the metric system was a choice to be made by individuals.

Early in 2013, state Representative Karl Rhoads introduced bill HB36 into the Hawaii House of Representatives that sought to make the metric system mandatory within his state. Called &quot;Relating to the Metric System&quot;, the bill stipulated that the law would come into effect on January 1, 2018. By June 2014, bill HB36 had not gained enough support and was considered dead. However, in January 2019, Rhoads presented bill SB428 to the Hawaii State Legislature, saying that &quot;strong reasons exist for Hawaii and other states to switch to the metric system&quot;. It was proposed to establish a task force to explore the use of the metric system for distance and speed measurements on public signs. If either bill had become law, Hawaii would have been the first state to introduce the metric system on a broad scale.

In January 2015, Oregon State Senator Brian Boquist, at the request of metric enthusiast David Pearl, proposed Oregon Senate Bill 166, which was similar to the Hawaiian bill. It would have established the International System of Units as the official units of measurement within the State of Oregon. The bill was in committee upon adjournment on July 6, 2015.

During Lincoln Chafee&#x27;s 2016 presidential election campaign, he advocated for the switch to metric units. Following a widely panned debate performance and poor polling numbers, Chafee announced on October 23, 2015, that he would be ending his campaign.

===Daily life===
Many Americans have studied the common metric units at school. Moreover, newer units introduced by engineers and scientists from the 18th century onwards, such as volts, megapixels, and kilotons and megatons of TNT, are generally formulated in terms of powers of 10.

Use of units based on the SI is widespread for many applications. Residential electric power plans use kilowatt hours. The luminous flux from lamps is specified in lumens, derived from the candela rather than the candle.

The letter &quot;K&quot; is commonly used as a capital letter and as a suffix to denote a thousand of a unit (e.g., &quot;She earns $80K&quot;), even though this is inconsistent with &quot;k&quot; in SI, where the letter k is used only as a lowercase letter and as a prefix to denote &quot;thousand&quot; (e.g., &quot;She travelled 80 km&quot;).

The common usage of K has largely replaced the letter &quot;G&quot; (for &quot;&quot;, used almost exclusively for money) and the Roman numeral &quot;M&quot; that was commonly used for &quot;thousand&quot; before the 1960s. The &quot;M&quot; has now come to denote &quot;million&quot; (e.g., &quot;$32.5M budget&quot;).

Calculations show annual savings due to the elimination of English measures from instruction ranging from $1.603 billion to $2.506 billion per year. Over time, the total savings would accumulate to a present discounted value of between $53.4 to $83.5 billion.

===Weather===
Televised and radio weather reports are given in degrees Fahrenheit instead of Celsius for dew point and air temperatures, miles per hour for wind speed, inches of mercury for atmospheric pressure (millibars are used only when reporting tropical phenomena such as hurricanes), and other customary units.

In some northern border states, temperatures are described in both Fahrenheit and Celsius for the benefit of cross-border Canadian audiences, while web-based and mobile weather forecasts can typically be switched to metric units.

===Consumer and retail===
Some U.S. consumer products come in round metric sizes, which appears to be increasing because of the international nature of manufacturing, distribution, and sales. Many items are produced in round metric quantities, and some manufacturers opt to display the metric quantity first or more prominently (e.g. Oral-B Glide dental floss is available in 35-, 40-, and 50-meter packages).

Perhaps the most common metric item sold is the two-liter bottle, while some supermarket chains also make their store brand soft drinks available in 3-liter sizes. Soft drink containers of 1 liter and 0.5 liters (and more recently 1.25 liter bottles) are increasingly sold alongside 12 fl oz, 16 fl oz, 20 fl oz, and 24 fl oz (355, 473, 591 and 710 mL) sizes.

The half-liter water bottle (16.9 fl oz) has nearly replaced the 16 ounce size, while 700 mL (23.6 fl oz) and one-liter sizes are also common, though 20 fl oz and 24 fl oz sizes remain popular, particularly in vending machines.

Attempts to sell 3- or 4-liter jugs of milk, instead of gallons (3.785 L), have been largely unsuccessful, and such bottles are rarely seen in the United States; milk remains sold in binary divisions of the gallon, with half-pints, pints, quarts and half-gallons being the primary sizes.

Shampoo, mouthwash, and dental floss have begun to be sold in metric sizes. PowerBars and similar products have always been sold (but not marketed) by the gram.

Nutritional food labels typically report serving sizes in both systems, but only list metric values (g or mg) for the breakdown of individual nutrients.

==== Alcohol ====
Wine is sold in standard bottles of 750 mL, as in the rest of the world. A fifth of liquor, once one-fifth of a U.S. gallon, or 757 mL, is now commonly 750 mL, though it is still referred to as &quot;a fifth&quot;. Beer is sold in fluid ounce denominations. Regulations are set by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau which controls the permissible sizes of containers. Unlike non-alcoholic beverages, most alcohol products are not required to carry unit conversions on labels.

==== Non-packaged foods ====
Loose fruits and vegetables are near universally priced either per pound or per item. In both supermarkets and steakhouses, cuts of meat are sold in ounces and pounds. Loosely sold goods need not carry a unit conversion.

In some agricultural areas, pecks or bushels can denote quantities of apples etc. by dry volume.

====Fair Packaging and Labeling Act====
Since 1992, the federal Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) has required most packaged consumer goods to be labeled in both customary and metric units. Some industries are engaged in efforts to amend this law to allow manufacturers to use only metric labeling. Forty-eight U.S. states have adopted laws permitting labeling in only metric units, the two exceptions being New York and Alabama.

==== Electronics ====
The electronics and computer industries largely converted to metric standards as new technologies were introduced toward the end of the 20th century, also driven in part by a shift in manufacturing from the U.S. to countries in Asia with metric standards.
Display sizes for screens on TVs and computer monitors are advertised and sold in inches (measured diagonally), although most boxes also state the size in centimeters.

The original phone connector jack dates back to 1878 and still sees use in audio equipment and electric instruments. In many respects, it has been superseded by the 3.5 mm connectors or 2.5 mm headset, which was common on older mobile phones.

While early floppy disks had a nominal package size of 5 inches (approximately 130 mm), the nominal design diameter of the replacement &quot;3 inch&quot; disks was actually 90 mm. CDs and DVDs are 120 mm in diameter, but their size is rarely mentioned; mini CDs are sometimes called 80 mm CDs.

Computer fan sizes are exclusively referred to by metric units (120 mm or 80 mm case fans, for example), while hard disk drive and CD drive bay sizes are customary measurements, typically 3 inches and 5 inches, respectively. The actual size of the drive bays differ from their name (e.g., 3&quot; drive bays are actually wide, because 3&quot; refers to the historical platter diameter inside the drive). The newer 2 inch and 1.8 inch drive bays are specified in metric and use metric mounting screws. Newer SSDs in the M.2 form factor are measured in millimeters (e.g., &quot;M.2 2280&quot; is 22 mm wide by 80 mm long).

Consumer-size photographic film is commonly sold in a 35 mm standard (24×36 mm negative), although print sizes and large format films are defined in inches. Digital camera sensor sizes are measured in an archaic manner indicating inverse fractions of an inch representing the diameter of an equivalent vidicon tube. For example, a sensor is larger than a sensor. However, lenses are marked in terms of focal length in millimeters (e.g., average natural human field of view is a lens with 35–50 mm focal length for 35 mm film).

The weight of vinyl phonograph records is reported in grams. The tracking force and anti-skating settings on a turntable are measured in grams-force.

==== Clothing ====
Clothing is measured in inches, not centimeters. American shoe sizes are measured on different scales for children, men, and women but all sizes are derived from inches. Major multi-national apparel brands including Nike, Adidas, Hanes, and Levi&#x27;s often sell the same inventory worldwide, with tags containing both SI and customary units.

==== Bedding ====
Mattress sizes use non-numeric labels, such as king, queen, full, or twin. These sizes are defined in inches, unlike most other countries, which use similar labels defined using metric units. The FPLA mandates bed sheets state the type of bed they are intended for in addition to dimensions in centimeters and inches. The FPLA also mandates dual scales on many other woven goods such as towels.

===Construction===
Of all industries, construction has adopted metric units the least. Dimensional lumber comes in standard nominal inch cross-section sizes and lengths are given in feet. Although model building codes—such as the International Building Code—provide information in both customary and metric units, locally developed building code amendments and zoning codes often provide customary units exclusively. Because of Canada&#x27;s proximity to the U.S., issues of common units still arise. This tendency in construction is similar to Japan, an otherwise metricated country where traditional construction still uses Japanese units predating metrication.

===Aviation===
Aircraft altitudes for air traffic control and related purposes are measured in feet in the U.S. In fact, most of the world has used feet for aviation altitudes since the end of World War II (meters before 1945 in all European countries except the UK), with the notable exceptions of China, North Korea, and many former Soviet countries. For instance, an airliner on a long flight, even if neither its starting point nor destination are in the United States, might use a nominal cruising altitude of 36,000 feet, using an internationally standardized system of flight levels (Flight Level 360 in this case). In 2011, Russia switched from metric to foot-denominated flight levels at high altitude to eliminate the need for adjustments when crossing in to or out of its airspace.

===Commercial aviation===
Frequent-flyer programs from commercial airlines in the United States, such as American Airlines&#x27; AAdvantage and Delta&#x27;s SkyMiles, are commonly managed using miles. This is likely to continue; in fact, some international airlines that previously used kilometers are switching to miles or using both, to simplify the redemption of miles with United States-based airline partners. Aircraft speed is often measured in knots and elevation in feet (flight level) in many countries.

For both domestic and international routes, U.S. airlines set luggage size and weight restrictions in terms of customary units. Conversely, international airlines that fly to the U.S. often restrict baggage to metric sizes.

The temperatures in aviation-related weather reports are given in degrees Celsius in the United States.

For carry-on luggage, the Transportation Security Administration restricts liquids to 3.4 fluid ounces (100 mL). Originally, the agency planned to restrict to 3 oz (89 mL) but switched it to 3.4 oz (100 mL) after pressure from the European Union.

===Education===
Most students are given some level of introduction to the metric system in elementary, middle, and high school, but the emphasis varies.

===Electricity and energy===
There are no U.S. customary units for electric current, potential difference, or charge since these concepts were developed after the international adoption of metric in science. The metric units ampere, volt, ohm and coulomb are the only units used. The SI term hertz has replaced the term &quot;cycles per second&quot; for the same unit of frequency.

Energy is often measured in watt hours (SI-based), calories (SI-based), BTUs (customary) or therms (customary) rather than the SI joule. Residential and commercial electrical energy use is metered and billed in kilowatt hours, kW·h, as in most metric countries. Force measurements regularly use the pound instead of the SI newton; torque is measured in pound-feet. Fuel prices are mostly given in customary units, such as dollars per gallon, barrel, thousand cubic feet, or ton (short or long). Heating, cooling, and combustion are often measured in BTUs per hour or refrigeration tons, and powerplant efficiency is often measured by its &quot;heat rate&quot;, in BTU per kilowatt hour. The rated power of engines, electric motors, and power plant steam turbines is frequently measured in horsepower. Power plant output is generally expressed in megawatts.

===Financial services===
Some market prices, basically of primary unprocessed materials, are quoted in customary units (such as barrels of oil, troy ounces of gold, pounds of frozen pork bellies, etc.). The federal government reports international production figures in metric units (for instance, wheat in metric tons) but in bushels for domestic production figures.

===Firearms===

The U.S. uses both the inch and millimeter for caliber on civilian and law enforcement firearms.
Historically, ammunition rounds designed in the United States were denoted by their caliber in inches (e.g., .45 Colt and .270 Winchester.) Two developments changed this tradition: the large preponderance of different cartridges using an identical caliber and the international arms trade bringing metric calibers to the United States. The former led to bullet diameter (rather than caliber) often being used to describe rounds to differentiate otherwise similar rounds. A good example is the .308 Winchester, which fires the same .30-caliber projectile as the .30-06 Springfield and the .300 Savage. Occasionally, the caliber is just a number close to the diameter of the bullet, like the .220 Swift, .223 Remington and .222 Remington Magnum, all of which actually have .22 caliber or bullets.

The second development is actual metric calibers being introduced to the United States. 6 mm and 7 mm caliber rifles are particularly popular as are 9 mm and 10 mm caliber handguns. These metric caliber rounds are either described by their metric caliber, such as the very popular 7mm Remington Magnum round or have their bullet diameter converted into inches, such as the also extremely popular .243 Winchester. Occasionally, U.S.-designed inch-caliber rounds are stated in metric as well.

The U.S. military, reflecting its need to ensure interoperability with its NATO allies, uses metric measurements for almost all weapons calibers, even for calibers that originated as or were derived from a different measurement (e.g., 7.62 mm rather than .308, or 5.56 mm instead of .223). However, civilian rifles chambered for .223 Remington may load military 5.56 mm ammunition but not fire it safely because 5.56 mm NATO ammunition is loaded to create greater chamber pressure than .223 Remington. Controversy exists whether this is true for civilian rifles chambered for .308 Winchester firing 7.62×51 mm NATO military ammunition. Major handloading manuals in the U.S. use U.S. customary units for all pertinent measurements including bullet diameter, cartridge overall length, powder charge weight, velocity, and maximum pressure, even with European-designed fully metric rounds.

===Gemstones===
Gemstones and pearls are sold in metric carats.

===Manufacturing===
Globalization of manufacturing has led to wide adoption of metric standards, although this is not yet universal. After a period where automobiles were assembled with both customary and metric fasteners in each vehicle, cars are now universally built with metric parts. Automobile engines were once named after their displacement in cubic inches. For example, the Chrysler &quot;426 Hemi&quot; engine would be described as 7 liters in modern terminology. Technical publications by industry publishers and American automakers often give engine displacements in cubic inches as well as cubic centimeters (which are equivalent to milliliters), or liters. For example, the specifications for the Dodge SRT-8 6.1 L Hemi state the displacement as .

===Military===
The U.S. military uses metric measurements extensively to ensure interoperability with allied forces, particularly NATO Standardization Agreements (STANAG). Ground forces have measured distances in &quot;klicks&quot;, slang for kilometers, since 1918. Most military firearms are measured in metric units, beginning with the M-14 which was introduced in 1957, although there are a few legacy exceptions, such as .50-caliber guns. Aircraft ordnance is normally measured in pounds. Heavy weapon caliber is measured in millimeters. Military vehicles are generally built to metric standards. An exception is the U.S. Navy, whose guns are measured in inches and whose undersea fleet measures distances in terms of &quot;kiloyards&quot; (equivalent to 914.4 m), depth as &quot;feet&quot;, and velocity, in some cases, as &quot;feet per second&quot;. The Navy and Air Force continue to measure distance in nautical miles and speed in knots; these units are now accepted for use with SI by the BIPM. Furthermore, in military aviation NATO countries use feet for flight heights, as they do in the civilian aviation.

===Money===
The United States dollar is fully decimal, being divided into 10 dimes, 100 cents (¢), and (for accounting purposes) 1000 mills (₥); this mirrors the decimal divisions of metric units with the prefixes &quot;deci-&quot;, &quot;centi-&quot;, and &quot;milli-&quot;. Coins are currently minted in 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-cent increments. Banknotes are currently printed in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100-dollar increments; these numbers follow the pattern of being factors of 10 (1, 2, or 5) multiplied by a power of 10 (1, 10, or 100).

===Illegal drugs and controlled substances===
Illegal drugs and controlled substances are often measured in metric quantities. The federal law prohibiting them defines the penalties in metric masses.

In everyday use within its subculture, marijuana is sold using a combination of metric and US customary units. At small scales the basic unit is the gram (or fractions thereof), but for larger orders fractions of ounces and pounds are used. Informally ounce is often defined in turn as 3.5 grams (an approximate 1.25% rounding error) and referred to simply as &quot;an eighth&quot;. The practice of using grams or ounces depending on the size is also common in states that have legalized marijuana. For example, California allows possession of &quot;an ounce&quot; (legally rounded to 28.5 g) of recreational marijuana but only 8 g of concentrate.

The strength of a tab of LSD is almost always expressed in micrograms.

E-juice, used to provide nicotine and vapor in electronic smoking devices, is sold by the milliliter. Some places also require products to display nicotine concentration. In Utah, vape shops are required to have information explaining the difference between mg/mL and percent by volume concentrations.

===Science===
In science, metric use is essentially universal, though additional specialized units are often used for specific purposes in various disciplines (such as the parsec and light year in astronomy), consistent with worldwide use. Laboratories in the United States almost exclusively use the metric system and SI, such as the Celsius and Kelvin scales for temperature.

Earth sciences, such as hydrology and geology, continue to use customary units for field surveying, due both to the legacy of many decades of data collection and to the need to work with the construction industry, which has not adopted the metric system. American irrigation engineers, for example, talk in acre-feet and cubic feet per second, whereas most other irrigation engineers would refer to gigaliters and cubic meters per second.

Meteorology extensively uses both metric and customary units. The METAR reporting system in use in the United States differs from the one used by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in that wind speeds are delivered in knots (instead of meters per second), water-equivalent precipitation in hundredths of an inch, and altimeter setting in the customary inches of mercury (instead of hectopascals). Temperatures are reported in whole degrees Fahrenheit but are converted to Celsius when encoded in METAR reports. Most synoptic observation charts are expressed in SI units, except for the aforementioned wind speeds, which must be converted for the purposes of calculation.

Upper-air temperature charts typically use the Celsius scale (the freezing line is of great importance at lower levels of the atmosphere in determining precipitation type) while potential temperature charts use the kelvin; both of these are in line with international usage. Atmospheric vorticity is typically measured in full rotations per 100,000 seconds (a rough metrication of the day) but does not use the SI-recommended radian.

National Weather Service and TV/radio broadcast public forecasts are given almost exclusively in customary units: degrees Fahrenheit for temperature and dewpoint, fractions of an inch of rain or ice and whole inches of snow (less than an inch often indicated by fractions or informal terms like &quot;dusting&quot; when very low), inches of mercury; and for wind speeds, miles per hour, except in marine forecasts, in which knots are used. Wave heights are measured in feet.

Actual sleet and snowfall and their depths on the ground are measured in tenths of an inch, with actual rainfall in hundredths, and ice accretion in either fractions or decimals. Hailstone sizes are typically reported without a fixed unit of measure; they are instead compared to familiar round or spherical items (e.g. dime-sized or golf ball-sized). Barometer readings for hurricanes are usually given in millibars (mb), which are equal to hectopascals (hPa), or ten times the kilopascals (kPa) used in neighboring Canada; the use of inches of mercury in such applications is rapidly declining.

In early 2007, NASA announced that it would use metric units for all operations on the lunar surface upon its return to the Moon, then projected for 2020. NASA&#x27;s lunar return program was then canceled in 2010.

=== Medicine ===
The medical field uses predominantly metric units. When interacting with patients certain data, such as their height and weight, is presented in customary units.
==== Pharmacology ====
Both prescription and non-prescription dosages of pills are always measured in the SI system with the most common unit being the milligram. Smaller dosages use micrograms. Because the SI prefix μ (mu) is not well known among many Americans and is not available on most keyboards the medical industry uses the abbreviation mcg to denote micrograms. Especially in hand-written prescriptions, using &quot;mcg&quot; rather than &quot;μg&quot; avoids the latter being mistaken for &quot;mg&quot;, potentially causing a 1000x dose error.

For vitamins, nutrient amounts are given in gram denominations or WHO standardized international units, known as IU.

The sizes of pill containers, when occasionally spoken of, are predominantly discussed in terms of fluid drams, although most also contain cubic centimeters and sometimes fluid ounces on the specifications.

For a long time, liquid dosages of medication were displayed in terms of both milliliters and the customary units of teaspoons and tablespoons, which are standardized as equal to 5 and 15 mL respectively. However, many people colloquially refer to the small spoon in a utensil set as the teaspoon and the big spoon as the tablespoon. After a major analysis in 2015, it was found that the inclusion of tea/tablespoon dosages likely encourages some people to use non-calibrated kitchen utensils as measuring devices. Due to this and reported confusion with the abbreviations TSP and TBSP, the FDA now recommends doctors and pharmaceutical manufacturers use milliliter only dosing instructions. To assist in this transition, drug makers and pharmacies are encouraged to include a disposable measuring cup with liquid medications.

==== Concentrations and bloodwork ====
Medicine dosage guidelines are specified in terms of milligrams per kilogram. The exact metric unit used by healthcare professionals in the U.S. does occasionally vary compared to other countries. For example, U.S. diabetes mellitus patients measure their blood sugar levels in milligrams per deciliter (as with cholesterol and other blood concentrations), whereas most other countries use millimoles per liter. American blood glucose meters have the ability to switch between the two.

Blood and urine samples are taken by the milliliter. Intravenous therapy (IV) is dispensed by the milliliter. To avoid confusion, a 1-liter bag is denoted as &quot;1000 mL&quot;.

==== Height and weight ====
Anthropometric data such as height may be recorded in centimeters. The body mass index (BMI) is expressed in kg/m2, even though it may be computed from pounds and inches. Even if the medical practice takes height and weight data in terms of SI units, it is almost always discussed with the patient in terms of customary units. Exercise is commonly discussed with patients in terms of miles walked. Intake of sugar, sodium, and other nutrients is usually discussed in terms of grams and milligrams.

Use among veterinarians varies. Because of heavy public interaction, animal weights (e.g., for cats or dogs) are nearly always recorded and reported in pounds and ounces. Usage at veterinary teaching hospitals favors SI units.

==== Dentistry ====
Measurements of tooth locations/movement and periodontal (gum health) charts are in millimeters.

==== Blood pressure ====

Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury.

===Sound===
Accurate sound level measurement devices were not invented until after the microphone or for that matter after the proliferation of the SI system in physics and internationally. Hence, although certain information on sound pressure can theoretically be evaluated in terms of pounds per square inch (PSI), this is virtually never done. Instead, the internationally used decibel (dB) scale is most common. In some cases where there is a desire for a non-logarithmic scale, the decibel-related sone scale is used. For example, appliance noise level is usually rated in terms of sone output. Hearing protection must be labeled in terms of decibel reduction with more detailed charts displaying decibel reduction at given hertz frequencies.

===Sports===
U.S. citizens are frequently exposed to metric units through coverage of international sporting events, particularly the Olympic Games.

While the track and field Olympic Trials have always been conducted in metric distances to duplicate the competition the selected athletes are destined for, the National Championships changed to metric in 1974. However, USA Track &amp; Field (USATF) continued to calculate the national championships in the high jump in U.S. customary units until 2002. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) switched its measurement system at the National Championship level in 1976. The final holdout was the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) administering high school sports, which switched to metric in 1980.

U.S. track-and-field competitions are commonly run in increments of 400 meters, which roughly correspond to traditional mile-based lengths. In the Olympics, athletes run 1500 meters, not 1600 meters.

Running races in the U.S. are usually run in metric distances (e.g., the 100 meters dash or the 5K run), although the mile distance remains popular. Even 5 and 10 kilometer races most often have mile markers on the course, and no kilometer markers. Long-distance races are often measured in kilometers, although exceptions exist (generally 10 mile races). The marathon is referred to as a 26.219-mile race (the official marathon standard distance originally being in English units—26 miles, 385 yards) rather than 42.195 km. Ultramarathons are measured in either miles or kilometers, with little standardization either way.

Although the Olympics and U.S. track events have been metric for years, it is still common for sports commentators to provide conversions to help the American audience understand the measurements.

Measured distances as used in events such as shot put, high jump, and discus throw are, however, often in feet and inches, except at the national and international levels. In 2017, the Florida High School Athletic Association became the first to resist this trend and use metric measures for field events. The field and court sizes for most popular team sports such as soccer were originally set in non-metric units. This is reflected in American football, in which the playing field is divided into yards, and many important statistics are measured in yards. Similarly, the dimensions for all baseball parks, basketball courts, tennis courts and ice hockey rinks are given in feet, golf courses in yards, auto racing tracks in miles (or fractions thereof), and horse racing in furlongs. The lengths of automobile races in the U.S. are generally set in miles. Some sporting equipment, such as skis and poles, is sold in metric units.

A novelty American football game was attempted in metric units in 1977, although the concept failed to gain acceptance.

Bicycles, especially at the high end, are increasingly being sold and sized in metric units. For example, a frame described as &quot;21 inch&quot; size in the past is now often labeled as a &quot;53 cm&quot; frame instead. Some bicycle wheels are labeled in metric as &quot;700c&quot; for a nominal 700 mm diameter road bike tire, but mountain bike wheels are still often sold in inches (26, 27.5, or 29 inches).

Common swimming pool dimensions are 25-yard, 25-meter, and 50-meter. The Olympic-size swimming pool is specified solely in meters. High schools and the NCAA conduct 25-yard competitions. USA Swimming (USA-S) swims in both metric and non-metric pools.

In the game of Ultimate, the size and weight of flying discs used in competitive play is standardized in millimeters and grams.

USA Weightlifting, as a member of the International Weightlifting Federation, uses metric units to measure weight. However, outside of competitions, most gyms label weights and dumbbells in pounds.

===Transportation===

Highway speed limits are posted in miles per hour and distances are largely displayed in miles, yards, or feet, although a few dual mile/km signs can be found, mostly remaining from demonstration projects that are no longer supported. One exception is Interstate 19 in Arizona, which is almost completely signed in metric, except for speed limit signs. Signage on this road is being converted back to customary units as it is replaced. Another exception is the turnpike section of Delaware Route 1, which uses a kilometer-based system, in anticipation of the mid-1990s conversion in the U.S. to the metric system, which did not happen. Distances were originally signed in kilometers, but have since been replaced with miles in 1995 and standard mile-markers in 2003. The exit numbers have remained metric starting at Dover Air Force Base northward to Interstate 95.

The 2000, 2003, and 2004 editions of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) were published using both metric and US customary units. Metric signs, including speed signs in kilometers per hour, were displayed in the manual although they were not normally used on the roads and there was no definite plan to convert to metric. For visual distinction, regulatory and advisory metric speed signs have black circles around the numbers followed by &quot;km/h&quot; and other regulatory metric signs have yellow plates reading &quot;metric&quot; in black capitals on top of the main signs. Metric signs and metric measurements were removed for the 2009 edition and replaced with an appendix of metric conversion tables. This is in marked contrast to the position in the (largely metric) United Kingdom, where metric road signs are prohibited by law (except for those denoting widths and height restrictions, which include both metric and imperial units).

Newer signs on state highways on the Hawaiian island of Kauai also include distances in both miles and kilometers. Mile markers along highways on the Island of Hawaii will indicate both units whenever the &quot;whole&quot; kilometer corresponds approximately with the &quot;whole&quot; mile (e.g., 5 mi/8 km). In Houston, Texas, many speed limits have km/h signs underneath the MPH signs. These are located near both airports (Bush Intercontinental and Hobby) and in the Texas Medical Center. The U.S. territory of Puerto Rico generally uses American-style (MUTCD) signs with metric measurement on highways, displaying kilometer posts and distances in km, yet speed limit signs are in miles per hour. The Maine Turnpike used to use metric measurements on its highway signs in addition to customary measurements, partly to assist the large numbers of Canadian tourists who visit Maine&#x27;s beaches. As of 2017 onwards, new or replaced signs include the distances in miles only.

The first signs in metric in the United States were posted on February 12, 1973, on Interstate 71 in Ohio.

Gasoline and diesel fuel are sold by the U.S. gallon, and fuel economy is rated in miles per gallon (MPG). In most other countries, using the metric system, fuel consumption is measured in liters per 100kilometers or kilometers per liter. The European Union official standard is liters per . Stations in Point Roberts, Washington, a short, noncontiguous peninsula that is road-accessible from the rest of the state of Washington only by crossing into Canada, sells its gasoline from pumps calibrated to dispense in liters, with some stations advertising prices in both CAD and USD. Gasoline is dispensed in liters in Puerto Rico. Automobile crankcase oil is sold by the quart, antifreeze by the gallon, brake fluid by the ounce (fluid), and air conditioning refrigerant by the ounce (mass). Windshield wiper replacement blades are measured in inches.

Domestic airline flights are assigned altitudes in feet and measure speed in knots. Nautical charts show depth in fathoms and use the nautical mile for distance. (One minute of arc of latitude at the radius of the earth at sea level was the standard for one nautical mile until about 1929. The nautical mile is now defined as exactly 1,852 meters.) Railroads use the standard gauge of 4 feet inches, as does most of Europe (where it is expressed instead as 1,435 mm).

U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 101, which governs vehicle controls and displays, permits speedometers to display miles per hour (MPH) or both MPH and km/h. In practice, most U.S.-market vehicles have mile odometers and dual-labeled speedometers with miles-per-hour as the primary calibration. Some 2000s era Buicks have a single speed gauge with a button on the instrument panel to switch the scale between MPH and km/h. Other vehicles have digital speedometers which can be set to read out speeds in either MPH or km/h.

Another common unit of speed is meters per second (m/s), used especially for lifts and cable cars. Odometers are permitted to record miles or kilometers, but must be clearly labeled as to which unit they record.

Tire inflation for passenger cars is typically about 30 pounds per square inch (psi) or 207 kilopascals (kPa). This is displayed on tires beside its metric equivalent. Post model year 2006 regulations also mandate an internationally standard &quot;Tire and Loading Information&quot; sticker which gives capacities in SI units followed by customary equivalents.

The long-distance trail Mid State Trail has used metric units exclusively in its trail guide since 1973.

===Water===

Municipal volumetric water measurements, including city water flow and cost per unit on a residential water bill, can either be measured in gallons, cubic feet, or cubic meters, with gallons being the most commonly used.

Water bottles for personal use can have their capacity measured in fluid ounces or liters. For ounces, the measurements are typically in multiples of 8, for example 32 fl oz and 40 fl oz, which correspond closely to common metric variants including 1 liter and 1.2 liters.

Rainfall is usually measured based on the height from the ground in inches. Other units such as millimeters, and other measurement types such as gallons per square foot or liters per square meter, are significantly less common.

===Hybrid units===
Some measurements are reported in units derived from both customary and metric units. For example:
* Heat rate from a power plant: BTU/kWh
* Federal automobile exhaust emission standards: grams per mile
* Caffeine in beverages: milligrams per (fluid) ounce
* A standard method for sizing tires combines millimeters for overall width and inches for the wheel diameter on which they fit.
* In lighting, light bulbs use eighths of an inch for bulb diameter and full inches for fluorescent tube lengths, while the socket is always in millimeters (for example, the standard &quot;medium Edison screw&quot; is E26). On recently-introduced Christmas lights millimeters are often used with small globe-shaped bulbs (G30 and G40), and with miniature LED sets, where the standard T1 (-inch tube) ones are sometimes called M5 (5 mm miniature; not to be confused with M5 thread).

For properties understood more recently, such as those related to electricity, there is no traditional unit; international units are always used, often in combination with U.S. customary units. One among many examples is in Table 8, chapter 9, of the &quot;National Electrical Code Handbook (8th ed.)&quot;, where resistance of conductors per unit length is given in ohms per thousand feet.

Other units are based on customary units, but use power-of-ten factors and metric prefixes. For example, distance to target for a U.S. submarine is expressed in kiloyards (kyd) rather than some combination of miles, yards, and feet. Telephone transmission line length and loop distances are measured in kilofeet. In some fields of civil engineering (especially structural engineering), and architecture, large loads and forces (such as the weight of a building or the amount of load applied to a column) are measured in kips (kilopounds or 1000 pounds-force) instead of short tons-force (2000 pounds-force), which are used in virtually all other non-metric industries in the United States, as well as in common usage among the public, when dealing with large values of force.

==Cultural impact==
The continuing use of U.S. customary units has caused writers to speculate in fiction set in the future about the adoption of the metric system. Many authors have assumed that the United States and the human race in general will use metric units. Others have assumed the continued use of U.S. customary units or have not taken metrication into account. Writers sometimes use customary units simply because American readers and watchers will understand the measurements; other times, they are simply used by accident. The 1966 show &quot;Star Trek&quot;, for instance, initially used U.S. customary units despite multiple Earth national origins and a setting in the 23rd century. Later, starting with &quot;The Changeling&quot;, metric measures were used, albeit inconsistently. Later sequels of the show, such as &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; (set in the 22nd century), used the metric system exclusively.

Both the metric system and attitudes in the U.S. toward the metric system are a target of humorous jabs in shows such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot; and &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. A &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch titled &quot;Decabet&quot;, released at the height of the metrication movement, lampooned the different metric measurements by introducing a new alphabet consisting of only ten letters.

In the 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) tells Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) that Europe is &quot;a little different&quot;, because for example in Paris, a &quot;Quarter Pounder with Cheese&quot; is instead known as a &quot;Royale with Cheese&quot; as &quot;they got the metric system. They wouldn&#x27;t know the fuck a Quarter Pounder is&quot;. Later, Jules compliments the intelligence of one of their victims, after he correctly surmises that French use of the metric system is what precludes the term &quot;Quarter Pounder&quot;.

&quot;Popular Science&quot;&#x27;s September 2003 edition listed NIST&#x27;s &quot;Metric System Advocate&quot; on its list of the &quot;Worst Jobs in Science&quot;.

Canada&#x27;s longest-serving female member of Parliament (MP), Hedy Fry, has represented Vancouver Centre since 1993. Another high-profile MP was Kim Campbell, who was elected in 1988, served in Brian Mulroney&#x27;s cabinet, then served as Prime Minister for 132 days before being defeated by Fry.

The 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution concluded that the electoral boundaries of Vancouver Centre should be adjusted, and a modified electoral district of the same name would be contested in future elections. The redefined Vancouver Centre lost a portion of territory from its southern end to the new district of Vancouver Granville. These new boundaries were legally defined in the 2013 representation order, which came into effect upon the call of the 42nd Canadian federal election, scheduled for October 2015.

<text>The Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS) is a joint programme developed by France, Italy, and the United Kingdom for an integrated anti-aircraft warfare system. The prime contractor is EUROPAAMS, a joint venture between Eurosam (66%) and UKAMS (33%). In the United Kingdom, PAAMS has been given the designation Sea Viper.

The system equips the s in French and Italian service as well as the British Type 45 destroyers.

==Background==
PAAMS was originally intended to be deployed in the &#x27;Common New Generation Frigate&#x27; (also known as the ) for the navies of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. The French DGA placed a contract with EUROPAAMS on 11 August 1999 for the development and initial production of the PAAMS warfare system along with the associated Long Range Radar (LRR) system. The contract included one PAAMS system and one LRR for each of the first British, French, and Italian new class of warships. Irreconcilable differences in the design requirements and workshare disagreements led to the United Kingdom leaving the &#x27;Common New Generation Frigate&#x27; project in October 1999. After withdrawing, Britain instead decided to pursue a national warship design, designated the Type 45 destroyer. The United Kingdom remained committed to the PAAMS project. As a result of efforts to achieve economies of scale, the PAAMS command and control system shares common architecture between the Horizon class and Type 45 destroyers. In 2009, PAAMS(S) was given the service name &#x27;Sea Viper&#x27; by the Royal Navy.

===PAAMS components===
*PAAMS(S) — British variant with SAMPSON Multi-Function Radar (MFR)
*PAAMS(E) — French/Italian variant with EMPAR Multi-Function Radar
*Automatic command and control system
*Consoles running Windows 2000 operating system
*Sylver Vertical Launching System
*Aster missiles:
**Aster 15, range; 
**Aster 30, range; 
Both variants of the PAAMS operate in conjunction with the S1850M Long Range Early Warning Radar.

==Capabilities==
PAAMS is designed to track, target and destroy a variety of high-performance air threats, including saturation attacks of very low altitude, supersonic cruise missiles, fighter aircraft, and UAVs. PAAMS can launch eight missiles in under ten seconds with its Sylver Vertical Launching System, and simultaneously guide up to 16 missiles. The PAAMS(S) variant consists of both the SAMPSON and S1850M long-range radars and is capable of tracking in excess of 1,000 targets at ranges of up to 400 km. BAE Systems also claims that its SAMPSON radar has &quot;excellent detection of stealth aircraft and missiles&quot;. Like the later baselines of the US Aegis Combat System, the PAAMS can engage multiple targets simultaneously.

===Testing===
*During its first major warfare sea exercise aboard , the ship&#x27;s Combat Management System crashed while under simulated air attack due to a power failure, and the ship lost use of its combat management system; the ship&#x27;s crew reverted to use of binoculars to spot incoming airborne threats until the CMS had been restarted.
*In 2009, two test firings of PAAMS in the British configuration from the Longbow trials barge failed due to &quot;failures in the terminal phase of the engagement.&quot; It was believed that &quot;production weaknesses&quot; in a batch of Aster 30 missiles imported from France were to blame.
*Beginning with in September 2010, all of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 45 destroyers have successfully intercepted Mirach drones with Aster missiles at the Benbecula ranges off the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. Mirach is a jet that flies at speeds of up to at altitudes as low as or as high as .
*In April 2012, the of the French Navy downed an American GQM-163 Coyote target simulating a sea-skimming supersonic anti-ship cruise missile travelling at Mach 2.5 () with an altitude of fewer than . It was the first time a European missile defence system destroyed a supersonic sea-skimming &quot;missile&quot;. The trial was described as a &quot;complex operational scenario&quot;.
*In September 2013, HMS &quot;Daring&quot; of the Royal Navy demonstrated the ability of her Sea Viper system to detect and track at considerable range two medium-range ballistic missiles at the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site in the Marshall Islands, US.
*In May 2019, successfully used her Sea Viper system to destroy an incoming drone target as part of Exercise Formidable Shield.
*In May 2019, the French frigate &quot;Bretagne&quot; destroyed a supersonic missile flying at more than Mach 2 () with one of her Aster 15s during exercise Formidable Shield.

== Operational history ==
** On 9 December 2023, the French Navy Ship FREMM Type Frigate &quot;Languedoc&quot; shot down two UAVs heading towards the vessel in the Red Sea with Aster 15 missiles. A further drone, threatening a Norwegian tanker, was shot down on 11 December.
** On the night of 15 December 2023, the Royal Navy Type 45 Destroyer HMS &quot;Diamond&quot; shot down a UAV targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea with a single Sea Viper (Aster). The UAV is believed to have been launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen and marks the first time a Royal Navy ship has fired at an aerial target in anger since the Gulf War in 1991.
** On the night of 9 January 2024, the Royal Navy Type 45 Destroyer HMS &quot;Diamond&quot; engaged numerous UAVs targeting her and commercial shipping in the Red Sea with Sea Viper (Aster) missiles. The UAVs were reported to have been launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen. The action was taken as part of a wider international operation to defend commercial shipping in the region.
** On Wednesday 24 April 2024, HMS &quot;Diamond&quot; used a single Sea Viper (Aster) missile to shoot down a ballistic missile which had been launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and which according to American sources was likely targeting a container ship. It was the first time since the Gulf War of 1991 that the Royal Navy had intercepted any kind of missile in combat, when HMS &quot;Gloucester&quot; shot down an Iraqi Silkworm cruise missile. It is also the first time that the Royal Navy&#x27;s Sea Viper system has shot down a ballistic missile in combat.

<text>Pembroke Dock () is a town and a community in Pembrokeshire, South West Wales, northwest of Pembroke on the banks of the River Cleddau.

Originally Paterchurch, a small fishing village, Pembroke Dock town expanded rapidly following the construction of the Royal Navy Dockyard in 1814. The Cleddau Bridge links Pembroke Dock with Neyland.

After Haverfordwest and Milford Haven, Pembroke Dock is the third-largest town in Pembrokeshire being more populous than neighbouring Pembroke.

== History ==
The natural harbour (now the Milford Haven Waterway) offering shelter from the prevailing south-westerly winds, has probably been used for many thousands of years. From maps, the first evidence of settlement is the name of the Carr Rocks at the entrance, derived from the Norse-language &quot;Skare&quot; for rock.

From 790 until the Norman Invasion (1066) the estuary was used by the Vikings. During one visit, either in 854 or in 878, maybe on his way to the Battle of Cynuit, the Viking chieftain Hubba wintered in the haven with 23 ships.

In 1172, King Henry II&#x27;s fleet and army were prepared in the mouth of the Pembroke River and sailed to Ireland during the Norman Invasion of Ireland.

Prior to 1814, the area was mostly farmland and known as Paterchurch. The first recorded mention of Paterchurch was in 1289. A medieval tower was built and like nearby 18th century and 19th century fortifications, it may have served as a lookout post. By the 17th century, additional domestic and farm buildings stood close to the tower and the isolated settlement had its own cemetery, whose last recorded burial is that of a Roger Adams, in 1731. The ruin of the tower now lies within the walls of the dockyard.

Paterchurch Tower was the centre of an estate said to stretch from Pennar Point to Cosheston. This changed hands in 1422 when Ellen de Paterchurch married a John Adams. Prior to the building of the town and before the dockyard was thought of, various sales and exchanges took place between the principal local landowners – the Adams, Owen and Meyrick families. These exchanges left the Meyricks in control of most of the land on which the dockyard and new town were to develop. By 1802 the Paterchurch buildings were mostly ruins.

During the Second World War Pembroke Dock was targeted by the German Luftwaffe. On Monday 19 August 1940 a Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 88 bomber flew up the haven waterway and bombed a series of oil tanks sited at Pennar. The oil-fuelled fire that followed raged for 18 days and was recorded as the largest UK conflagration since the Great Fire of London. Bombing on the night of 11 and 12 May 1941 resulted in 30 people killed and many injured in the town. Nearly 2,000 houses were damaged.

== Naval dockyards ==
===1758 naval report===
The origins of naval shipbuilding on Milford Haven were in the private shipyard of Jacobs on the north side of the waterway. In November 1757, the Admiralty sent a surveying delegation to the haven, which prepared a report for Parliament recommending, &quot;the construction of a Milford dock yard&quot;. No such place as Milford existed at this time, just the village of Hubberston. Secondly, the report showed early signs of lobbying existing, with the scale of the local infrastructure and ship building activity exaggerated.

===Milford Haven===

Dockyard development began on the north bank of the waterway. By the late 18th century, much of the village and the lands around Hubberston were owned by diplomat and politician Sir William Hamilton. Together with his nephew, the Hon. Charles Grenville, he proposed a scheme of development under the title &quot;Milford&quot;, in reference to the 1758 report. They began by building a shipyard, and leased it to a Messrs. Harry and Joseph Jacob, though after receiving an order in 1796 to build a frigate and later a 74-gun ship-of-the-line, Jacobs went bankrupt. The Navy took over the shipyard lease.

In 1809, a naval commission recommended purchase of the Milford Haven facility and formal establishment of a Royal Navy dockyard. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and the merging of the two sides of the Royal Navy under the Admiralty Board, a School of Naval Architecture was opened in Portsmouth in 1810 and, effectively then, Millford was to be set up as a model dockyard under French management (possibly to develop the manoeuvrability of British ships) from which lessons could be learnt for implementation in other dockyards.

===New town===

After failing to agree a purchase price for the existing Millford shipyard with Fulke Greville, Charles Greville&#x27;s heir, the Admiralty agreed purchase of land across the haven from Milford, near the town of Pembroke in a district called Pater (village) or Paterchurch. This was one of the few sites in the haven suitable for building a dock for constructing decent sized ships, as its shoreline was flat but led quickly into deep harbour. Secondly, the Board of Ordnance had purchased in preparation from the 1758 report to strengthen the haven&#x27;s defences, which was added to by the purchase of an adjoining for £5,500 from the Meyrick family.

The town of Pembroke Dock was founded in 1814 when Pembroke Dockyard was established, initially called Pater Dockyard. Construction started immediately, with the former frigate HMS &quot;Lapwing&quot; driven ashore as a temporary accommodation hulk. Orders were placed for the construction of 74 gun battleship, and four frigates. After the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815, although the scheme still seemed ill placed in what would be a smaller Royal Navy, the final plans were given the go ahead on 31 October 1815. The Naval Dockyards Society published a historical review in 2004.

On 10 February 1816, the first two ships were launched from the dockyard – HMS Valorous and Ariadne, both 20-gun post-ships, subsequently converted at Plymouth Dockyard into 26-gun ships. Over the span of 112 years, five royal yachts were built, along with 263 other Royal Navy vessels. The last ship launched from the dockyard was the Royal Fleet Auxiliary tanker &quot;Oleander&quot; on 26 April 1922.

In 1925, it was announced that the Royal Dockyards at Pembroke Dock and Rosyth were redundant and would be closed. A petition was sent to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, stressing the lack of alternative employment and the economic consequences of closure, but the decision was not overturned. First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Earl Beatty, said, &quot;Whether these Yards are necessary for naval purposes, the Admiralty is the only competent judge. As to whether they are necessary for political or social reasons is for the Government to decide. The fact is, that so far as the upkeep of the Fleet is concerned, they are entirely redundant.&quot;

The last Pembroke-built ship afloat was the hulk of the iron screw frigate , which was broken up in Belgium in 1956. In June of the same year, Admiral Leonard Andrew Boyd Donaldson, the last Captain-Superintendent of Pembroke Dockyard, died aged 81.

===Aftermath===
Although active warships were not based in Pembroke Dock after the 1940s, and formal dockyard work ceased in 1926, the base remained an official Naval Dockyard, and retained a Queen&#x27;s Harbour Master, until 2008 (one of the last 5 QHMs in the UK, together with those at the currently (2010) extant bases at Devonport, Portsmouth, Rosyth and Clyde). The Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service (RMAS) was based in Pembroke Dock until disestablishment in 2008, and the Ministry of Defence sold the freehold of the site to the Milford Haven Port Authority (MHPA) in 2007. For most of the last 20 years of MOD usage, the principal RMAS assets seen in the base were the MOD Salvage &amp; Marine Team (formerly CSALMO) vessels located there, the majority of which were relocated to the Serco base in Burntisland on the River Forth upon the activation of the £1bn Future Provision of Marine Services (FPMS) contract in May 2008.

===Future===
In 2021 permission was granted for &#x27;ambitious plans to transform Pembroke Dock&#x27;s historic dockyard&#x27; as part of a &#x27;£60 million marine energy project&#x27;. The Welsh Government decided not to call in the proposal, despite protests from SAVE Britain&#x27;s Heritage, the Georgian Group, the Victorian Society the Naval Dockyards Society and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, among others. The proposal will see buildings within the Conservation Area demolished, the Grade II* Graving Dock and the Grade II Timber Pond infilled and built over, the remaining Grade II listed Building Slips partially demolished and the setting of the adjacent Grade II Carr Jetty damaged.

The chair of the local Commodore Trust (which has &#x27;long fought to protect and revive the historic dockyard&#x27;) has argued that &#x27;these plans will see the destruction of a rare, if not unique, group of listed monuments that are a testament to the industry that gave birth to Pembroke Dock, revived the fortunes of Pembroke and gave the Milford Haven waterway a place in Wales, UK and world history&#x27;; Pembrokeshire County Council was persuaded by the developers (Port of Milford Haven) that the economic benefits of the project would &#x27;far outweigh&#x27; its impact on the historic environment. The project will see the listed structures replaced by two five-storey warehouses (to house future shipbuilding operations) and &#x27;a giant concrete slipway, stretching out into the water alongside the grade II listed Hobbs point causeway&#x27;.

== Military garrison ==

As the dockyard and its importance grew, the need to defend it was addressed and Pembroke Dock became a military town. Work began in 1844 to build defensible barracks. In 1845 the first occupiers were the Royal Marines of the Portsmouth Division, followed through the years by many famous regiments. Between 1849 and 1857, two Martello towers of dressed Portland stone were constructed at the south-western and north-western corner of the dockyard; both were garrisoned by sergeants of artillery and their families.

In the 1850s a hutted encampment was established nearby on Llanion Hill. In 1904 this was replaced by four brick-built barrack blocks, designed to house a thousand troops. The new Llanion Barracks was &#x27;the first barracks to be constructed with a separate area for cooking and ablutions and was one of the most modern in the country&#x27;.

The town remained garrisoned with troops until 1967.

== RAF base ==
With the closure of the dockyard in 1926, the year of the General Strike, unemployment was high through the Great Depression until 1931 when No. 210 Squadron RAF arrived equipped with Southampton II flying boats. For almost 30 years the Royal Air Force was based at Pembroke Dock. During 1943, when home to the Sunderland flying boats, it was the largest operational base for flying boats in the world.

It was announced in 1957 that the RAF would be drastically reducing its presence.

Pembroke Dock has a link to Hollywood: the full-scale &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; built for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was created in one of Pembroke Dock&#x27;s hangars by Marcon Fabrications in 1979.

==Today==
Pembroke Dock is served by the A477 trunk road which runs from the A40 at St. Clears. At Waterloo the A477 road crosses the Daugleddau estuary on the Cleddau Bridge and continues toward Haverfordwest. It has a ferry terminal from which ferries sail twice-daily to Rosslare in Ireland. The service is operated by Irish Ferries. There is also a deep water cargo port (Pembroke Port) adjacent to the ferry terminal which is operated by the Port of Milford Haven. Pembroke Dock railway station connects with Carmarthen &quot;via&quot; Tenby.

The two Martello towers remain: one was a local museum but is for sale by auction in July 2019, while the other is in private hands and has been converted for residential use and is largely intact. The dockyard wall is substantially complete and has been recently repaired by experts with dressed stone and lime mortar. The dry dock also remains, along with two out of ten building slips. The two listed hangars built to house the Sunderland flying boats used to guard the Western Approaches have been rebuilt and are now used for other purposes. Among several surviving Georgian and Victorian buildings on the site is the Terrace, a row of houses for the Dockyard officers. The Dockyard Chapel at the end of the Terrace has been rebuilt using Objective One funding from the European Union and now serves as the Pembroke Dock Heritage Centre run by Pembroke Dock Sunderland Trust.

A few buildings on the site of the old Llanion Barracks still stand. The Officers&#x27; and Sergeants&#x27; Mess once used as council offices is now occupied by Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. The original guardroom remains and is now residential accommodation and a listed Victoria Powder Magazine remains set into the coastal slope which is accessible from Connacht Way. The old parade square has recently been converted for housing.

Two cemeteries in the town both hold many service graves. Pembroke Dock (Llanion) Cemetery contains the war graves of 23 Commonwealth service personnel, including two unidentified Royal Navy sailors, of the First World War and 51 of the Second, including four unidentified Royal Navy sailors and an unidentified airman. Pembroke Dock Military Cemetery contains the war graves of 40 Commonwealth service personnel of the First World War and 33 of the Second, and is believed to be the only dedicated military cemetery in Wales.

The Pembrokeshire Technium was built and opened in 2006 and succeeded by Technium Science. Although the initial interest was slow the first major uptake on this facility began in 2009 when Infinergy built a wind farm in the local area and based its local office in the centre. There has been approval given by Pembrokeshire County Council for a new yacht marina to be built alongside Front Street but work has yet to begin.

==Renaming proposals==
There have been suggestions that Pembroke Dock should change its name, to improve the town&#x27;s image in respect of a reputation for high unemployment and industrial decline. Proposals have included Pembroke Haven, Pembroke Harbour and a reversion to the original pre-1814 name of Paterchurch. A change of name was rejected in a referendum in the 1960s, and was again proposed in 2003.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Pembroke Dock, at community (town) and county level: Pembroke Dock Town Council and Pembrokeshire County Council.

The town council comprises 16 councillors and is based at 28 Dimond Street, a converted shop in the town centre.

In May 2022, Billy Gannon, one of the town councillors, was rumoured to be English street artist Banksy. He subsequently resigned because this was affecting his ability to carry out the duties of a councillor.

For representation on the county council, Pembroke Dock is divided into four electoral wards: (Pembroke Dock Central, Pembroke Dock Llanion, Pembroke Dock Market and Pembroke Dock Pennar), which each elect one county councillor.

===Administrative history===
Pembroke Dock formed part of the ancient parish of Pembroke St Mary, which was part of the borough of Pembroke. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836, retaining the same boundaries and therefore continuing to include the growing town of Pembroke Dock. By 1895 Pembroke Borough Council had adopted the practice of holding its meetings alternately at Pembroke Town Hall and at Pembroke Dock, where the council had established its main administrative offices at 37 Bush Street (renumbered 71 Bush Street in 1906). The council remained based at 71 Bush Street (and later also expanded into neighbouring 73 Bush Street) until the early 1970s when it acquired Llanion Park, part of the Llanion Barracks at Pembroke Dock, to serve as its headquarters.

Pembroke Borough Council was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, with the area becoming part of the new district of South Pembrokeshire within the county of Dyfed on 1 April 1974. A community was established to cover the area of the former borough, with its council taking the name Pembroke Town Council. South Pembrokeshire District Council took over Llanion Park at Pembroke Dock to serve as its headquarters.

On 1 April 1986 the community of Pembroke was split into a Pembroke Dock community and a reduced Pembroke community, just covering the older town. This was the first time Pembroke Dock had been administered separately from Pembroke. The Pembroke Dock community council chose to call itself Pembroke Dock Town Council.

South Pembrokeshire was abolished in 1996, with the area becoming part of a re-established Pembrokeshire.

==Freedom of the Town==
HMS &quot;Pembroke&quot; of the Royal Navy received the Freedom of the Town of Pembroke Dock on 15 September 2006.

<text>West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country (formerly West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast) is a federal electoral district in British Columbia, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1997.

==Geography==
The district includes the regional districts of Sunshine Coast, the southern portion of the Squamish–Lillooet Regional District, including the municipalities of Whistler, Squamish, Pemberton; and West Vancouver, Lions Bay and Bowen Island, which are in the Metro Vancouver Regional District.

==Demographics==
:&quot;According to the 2016 Canadian census; 2013 representation&quot;
Languages: 76.9% English, 4.4% Mandarin, 3.8% Persian, 2.4% French, 1.9% German, 1.0% Punjabi,
Religions (2011): 42.4% Christian (13.3% Catholic, 8.6% Anglican, 6.8% United Church, 1.6% Baptist, 1.5% Lutheran, 1.1% Presbyterian, 9.5% Other), 3.3% Muslim, 1.3% Buddhist, 1.0% Jewish, 1.0% Sikh, 49.3% No religion 
Median income (2015): $35,774 
Average income (2015): $65,168

==History==
The electoral district was created as &quot;West Vancouver–Sunshine Coast&quot; in 1996 from parts of Capilano—Howe Sound and North Island—Powell River ridings.

In 2003, it was renamed &quot;West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country&quot;. At 48 characters, this was the current longest riding name in Canada until 2015, when it was overtaken by the renamed, 49-character Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes.

The riding or electoral district is also the first to have been represented in Parliament by a member of the Green Party, Blair Wilson. Elected as part of the Liberal party, he crossed the floor later in his career to become a member of the Green Party representing West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country. However, this came immediately before the 2008 federal election, in which he was defeated, and he never had the opportunity to sit in the House as a Green MP.

The 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution concluded that the electoral boundaries of West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country should be adjusted, and a modified electoral district of the same name would be contested in future elections. The redefined West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country:
*loses the Powell River Regional District to the district of North Island—Powell River;
*regains the community of Pemberton and area that had been transferred from it to Chilliwack—Fraser Canyon in the previous redistribution; and
*sees its boundary with North Vancouver adjusted to correspond to the boundaries between the District of North Vancouver, West Vancouver and the Capilano Indian Reserve.
These new boundaries were legally defined in the 2013 representation order, which came into effect upon the call of the 42nd Canadian federal election, scheduled for October 2015.

==Members of Parliament==

This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:







===Current member of Parliament===
Patrick Weiler is the current member of Parliament for this riding. He was elected after the incumbent, Pamela Goldsmith-Jones chose not to run for re-election in the 2019 federal election.

===Former members of Parliament===

The first member of Parliament to represent the riding was John Reynolds, a former sales and marketing consultant. He was first elected in the 1997 election. He was a member of the Reform Party, and its successors the Canadian Alliance and the Conservative Party. After Stockwell Day was pushed out as leader of the Canadian Alliance, Reynolds served as interim leader and Leader of the Official Opposition. He served as a member on the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. Reynolds did not run in the 2006 general election.

Liberal Blair Wilson was elected in the 2006 federal election. Wilson, a chartered accountant and a former restaurant owner, was the first Liberal MP for the historically Conservative riding. He lost to former MP John Reynolds in the 2004 federal election. Wilson resigned from caucus in October 2007 after allegations of improper campaign spending and failure to mention several legal and financial troubles during three nomination vetting processes. He remained a Liberal but not in caucus. In January 2008, Wilson became an Independent. He then joined the Green Party on August 30, 2008, becoming its first MP. Running under the Green banner in the election called only days later, he was defeated by Conservative John Weston. John Weston was defeated by Pamela Goldsmith-Jones on October 19, 2015. In the 2019 federal election, Patrick Weiler won for the Liberals after Goldsmith-Jones did not run for re-election.

<doc id="636734" wikidata="Q641212" url="?curid=636734" title="FedExForum">
<text>FedExForum is a multi-purpose indoor arena located in Downtown Memphis, Tennessee. It is the home of the Memphis Grizzlies of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball program of the University of Memphis, both of whom previously played home games at the Memphis Pyramid. The venue also has the capability of hosting ice hockey games, concerts, and family shows.

The arena officially opened in September 2004 after much debate and also a derecho wind storm on July 22, 2003, that nearly brought down the cranes that were building it near the famed Beale Street. It was built at a cost of US$250 million and is owned by the City of Memphis; naming rights were purchased by one of Memphis&#x27;s best-known businesses, FedEx, for $92 million. FedExForum was financed using $250 million of public bonds, which were issued by the Memphis Public Building Authority (PBA).

==Design==

FedExForum was designed by architectural firm Ellerbe Becket. Concrete work done with the help of Dowco Construction and Apac. The arena is 805,850 ft2 (75,000 m2) in size, covering 14 acres (57,000 m2). The Arena is round, with a dome. The playing floor is lower than ground level. It is capable of seating 18,119 for basketball and has 1,000 premiere courtside seats. There are 27 courtside suites, 32 club suites, 4 party suites, and 80 club boxes. It also contains a full-sized practice basketball court, visible from the huge lobby. The plans called for a mass transit bus depot, which brought a federal grant of $6 million, but the depot was changed to a premium parking garage, and Memphis had to return the money.

FedExForum&#x27;s interior was designed to pay tribute to Memphis&#x27; musical heritage, with paintings and murals depicting some of the city&#x27;s most famous artists including Justin Timberlake, Elvis Presley, and B.B. King. Most of the Arena&#x27;s restaurants are named in conjunction with FedExForum&#x27;s overall theme of music with Opus Restaurant and the Blue Note Lounge. The two other restaurants are sponsor-driven with the Lexus Lounge just off the Arena Floor and Jack Daniel&#x27;s Old No. 7 in the Grand Lobby of the Arena.

FedExForum was the first arena to utilize new &quot;see-through&quot; shot clock units which allow spectators seated behind the basket to see the action without having the clocks interfere with their view. The idea came when a fan of the NBA&#x27;s New Jersey Nets who sat behind the basket at Continental Airlines Arena sent an e-mail to NBA Commissioner David Stern, asking for technology to improve his view, and Daktronics obliged with the innovation at FedExForum in 2004. The NBA approved the unit a year later for full use and has seen the new units installed at Philadelphia&#x27;s Wells Fargo Center, Spectrum Center, TD Garden, Moda Center, Capital One Arena, State Farm Arena, and Staples Center after the approval. As of the 2011–12 NBA season every NBA arena had implemented the transparent shot clocks, with Pepsi Center, The Palace of Auburn Hills, Oracle Arena, Target Center, and ARCO Arena being the last NBA arenas to install the clocks.

==Hosted events==

===College basketball===
On February 23, 2008, FedExForum hosted the college basketball game featuring the No. 1 ranked Memphis Tigers vs. the No. 2 ranked Tennessee Volunteers. The facility also hosted the Conference USA men&#x27;s basketball tournament from 2005 to 2009. It was the site of the South regional semifinals and finals in the 2009, 2014, and 2017 editions of the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, and first- and second-round games of the 2024 tournament. FedExForum was one of the four regional finals in the 2010 NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament.

On March 12–15, 2014, the American Athletic Conference hosted their inaugural tournament at the FedExForum. It hosted the tournament again in 2019.

===Hockey===
On September 21, 2006, the Nashville Predators and the Columbus Blue Jackets played an NHL preseason game at FedExForum, the first ice hockey game ever held at the arena, won by the Predators 8–1.

===Boxing, WWE &amp; MMA===
On September 25, 2004, FedExForum hosted the Roy Jones Jr. vs. Glen Johnson for the IBF Light heavyweight title. Johnson won the fight with a 9th-round knockout.

FedExForum has hosted three major professional wrestling events. In 2007, World Wrestling Entertainment&#x27;s Unforgiven took place on September 16, headlined by The Undertaker and Mark Henry, and the PMG Clash of Legends independent show on April 27, featuring Hulk Hogan versus Paul Wight. In 2015, it hosted Fastlane on February 22. The first of five WWE house shows took place on September 19, 2004, shortly after the venue opened. It has hosted seven episodes of &quot;WWE Raw&quot; and four of &quot;WWE SmackDown&quot;. One notable instance of WWE at the arena was when Daniel Bryan &quot;occupied&quot; Raw with hundreds of his fans inside the ring and surrounding the ringside area on March 10, 2014.

On December 12, 2009, FedExForum hosted an Ultimate Fighting Championship lightweight title fight, UFC 107: Penn vs. Sanchez

===Other events===
In August 2010, the Professional Bull Riders&#x27; Built Ford Tough Series tour made their first appearance at FedExForum.

On August 4, 2010, FedExForum held the memorial service to Memphis native Lorenzen Wright, a Memphis Tigers alum and former Memphis Grizzlies player.

The Church of God in Christ, Inc. (COGIC) is a Christian organization in the Holiness-Pentecostal tradition. It is the largest Pentecostal denomination in the United States held their annual Convocation at the FedExForum from 2004 to 2007.

The arena hosted Monster Jam for a few years, then in 2019 hosted Hot Wheels Monster Trucks Live.

== Renovations ==

In order to keep the Grizzlies in Memphis, the City of Memphis has completed normal renovations to FedExForum to keep it up to NBA standards. In 2012, the arena&#x27;s sound system was replaced and the main basketball court was replaced for the Grizzlies for $200,000, with the Tigers&#x27; court being replaced the following year. Three years later, FedExForum completed a renovation for the backstage areas, including a new video room, a renovation of the coaches&#x27; offices, and office space for FedExForum employees. In 2017, the Grizzlies announced a $1.8 million renovation to the arena, which includes an HD scoreboard four times the size of the former, new HD displays, new LED lighting, and other additional fan amenities, which were completed in time for the beginning of the 2017-2018 NBA Season.

<doc id="636739" wikidata="Q1862487" url="?curid=636739" title="Sgùrr Dearg">
<text>is a mountain in the Cuillin on the Isle of Skye, Scotland. It is topped by the Inaccessible Pinnacle (or An Stac in Gaelic), a fin of rock measuring along its longest edge. The top of the Pinnacle stands at above sea level, making Sgùrr Dearg the only Munro with a peak that can only be reached by rock climbing. This makes it the biggest hurdle for many Munro baggers.

First climbed by Charles and Lawrence Pilkington in 1880, the Pinnacle was never climbed by Sir Hugh Munro himself. Because of its status as the most difficult of the Munros it has now spawned a cottage industry for the local guides, who are often seen escorting parties of novice climbers. Unlike much of the Cuillin, the pinnacle is basalt, not gabbro, and thus is somewhat slippery in the wet.

==Geography==
Sgùrr Dearg lies on the main Cuillin ridge at the junction of Coire Lagan, Coire na Banachdich and Coir&#x27;-uisg. It is the second highest peak in the Cuillin, and faces the highest, Sgùrr Alasdair, across Coire Lagan.

Although the name &quot;Sgùrr Dearg&quot; refers to the mountain as a whole, references to the &quot;summit&quot; of Sgùrr Dearg are, unless otherwise qualified, generally taken to indicate the top immediately below the Inaccessible Pinnacle on the north-western side. For reasons that remain unclear, this summit was listed as a Munro in the first (1891) edition of &quot;Munro&#x27;s Tables&quot;, while the higher Pinnacle was listed as a subsidiary top; this situation was reversed in the first revision of the tables in 1921.

==Ascents==
===Approach===
While the Inaccessible Pinnacle is the hardest of the Cuillin&#x27;s summits to reach, the approach to its base is relatively simple by Cuillin standards. Most walkers and climbers start from Glen Brittle, from where the easiest route involves following the faint path to the Bealach Coire na Banachdich via the corrie of the same name; from here the top of Sgùrr Dearg may be gained via a tedious scree slope interspersed with some easy scrambling. A more interesting ascent may be achieved by ascending the screes of Sròn Dearg, which leads to Sgùrr Dearg&#x27;s narrow and rocky south-west ridge, a grade 1/2 scramble.

Many climbers tackle the mountain as part of a circuit of the Coire Lagan skyline, or a traverse of the main Cuillin ridge, approaching it along the ridge from Sgùrr MhicChoinnich to the south-east (Grade 2). In this case the top of Sgùrr Dearg can be reached direct by scrambling up the broad flank to the left of An Stac and the Inaccessible Pinnacle.

===The Inaccessible Pinnacle===
The Inaccessible Pinnacle (&quot;An Stac&quot; in Gaelic), colloquially called the &#x27;In Pin&#x27; or &#x27;In Pinn&#x27; by mountaineers, was first climbed in 1880 by a pair of Lancashire brothers, Charles and Lawrence Pilkington. They were guided to the foot of the climb from Sligachan via Coruisk and Bealach Coire na Banachdich by a local shepherd called John Mackenzie. They climbed it by the east ridge, and had to throw down a lot of loose rock as they climbed.

The usual ascent of the Inaccessible Pinnacle itself is by its long east ridge, a climb of vertically involving two roped pitches. Although graded Moderate (the lowest grade now in use in the British grading system), with good holds, the ridge is narrow and exceptionally exposed. This route was described by an early climber as &quot;a knife-edged ridge, with an overhanging and infinite drop on one side, and a drop on the other side even steeper and longer&quot;. Some climbers prefer to tackle the much shorter west ridge (), graded Very Difficult. It is usual to descend from the summit of the Pinnacle by abseiling off the west end, and a permanent anchor is sited on the summit for this purpose.

In 2014 cyclist Danny MacAskill climbed Sgùrr Dearg without safety ropes, while carrying a mountain bike on his back. The video was viewed over 14 million times in the week following its launch on 2 October 2014 and has been watched over 79.5 million times (as of July 2023).

<text>The Memphis Redbirds are a Minor League Baseball team of the International League and the Triple-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals. They are located in Memphis, Tennessee, and are named for their Major League Baseball affiliate. The Redbirds play their home games at AutoZone Park, which opened in 2000 and is located in Downtown Memphis. The team previously played at Tim McCarver Stadium in 1998 and 1999.

The Redbirds were established as an expansion team of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 1998. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of Minor League Baseball in 2021, they were placed in the Triple-A East, which became the International League in 2022. A total of eight managers have led the club and its over 500 players. As of the completion of the 2024 season, the Redbirds have played in 3,707 regular season games and compiled a win–loss record of 1,858–1,849 (). They have appeared in the postseason on seven occasions and won the PCL championship in 2000, 2009, 2017, and 2018. The Redbirds won the Triple-A National Championship Game in 2018. They have a postseason record of 34–24 (). Combining all 3,765 regular season and postseason games, Memphis has an all-time record of 1,892–1,873 ().

==History==
===Prior professional baseball in Memphis===

The first professional baseball team in Memphis was the Memphis Reds of the League Alliance in 1877. A different Reds team was created as a charter member of the original Southern League in 1885. The city&#x27;s Southern League team was known as the Grays in 1886 and 1888, the Browns in 1887, simply Memphis in 1889, the Giants in 1892 and 1894, the Fever Germs in 1893, and the Lambs/Giants in 1895.

The city&#x27;s longest-operating baseball team, first known as Memphis Egyptians, was formed in 1901 as a charter member of the Southern Association. From 1909 to 1911, this club was called the Turtles before receiving its best-known moniker, the Chickasaws, often shortened to Chicks, in 1912. The original Chicks remained in the league through 1960, winning eight pennants, one playoff championship, and one Dixie Series title. Russwood Park, their home ballpark, was destroyed by fire in April 1960. With the cost of building a new facility too high, the team dropped out of the league after the 1960 season.

After a seven-year span with no professional team, Memphis became host to the Memphis Blues, a Double-A team of the Texas League, in 1968. After six seasons, the Blues moved up to the Triple-A International League in 1974, but the franchise was revoked by the league due to financial problems after the 1976 season. Memphis gained an expansion team in the Double-A Southern League that played from 1978 to 1997. The Chicks were relocated to nearby Jackson as the West Tenn Diamond Jaxx in 1998 to make way for a new Triple-A team.

===Pacific Coast League (1998–2020)===
The Memphis Redbirds were created as an expansion franchise of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1998. Initially, the team was owned as a non-profit community entity called the Memphis Redbirds Baseball Foundation, which operated the Redbirds until 2009 when management was turned over to Global Spectrum, a Comcast-owned company. While a new ballpark, AutoZone Park, was being constructed for the team, they played their first two seasons (1998–99) at the city&#x27;s Tim McCarver Stadium.

The Redbirds became the top minor league affiliate of the Major League Baseball&#x27;s St. Louis Cardinals. Memphis&#x27; team name, logo, color scheme, and uniforms were all based on those of the St. Louis team. In their inaugural season, the club was managed by Gaylen Pitts. The Redbirds played their first game on the road at Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska. In game one of the doubleheader, the Omaha Royals defeated the Redbirds, 3–2. The team finished their first season of play with a 74–70 record, three games out of first place, leaving them second out of four teams in their division. They finished the 1999 season in third place with a 74–64 record.

In 2000, Memphis moved into the newly constructed AutoZone Park. In the park&#x27;s first regular season game, held on April 14, the Redbirds defeated the Iowa Cubs, 14–3. Memphis went on to clinch the Pacific Coast League&#x27;s American Conference East Division championship by ending the season in first place, 13 games ahead of the second-place Oklahoma RedHawks. In the American Conference series, the Redbirds defeated the Albuquerque Isotopes, three games to two, and advanced to the league finals. Memphis then defeated the Salt Lake Buzz, 3–1, to win the PCL championship. The Redbirds went on to face the Indianapolis Indians, league champions of the Triple-A International League, in the best-of-five Triple-A World Series. Memphis lost, three games to one.

The team finished each of the next three seasons in fourth place—2001 (62–81), 2002 (71–71), and 2003 (64–79). The 2002 campaign was a particularly tight race within the American Conference East Division, as the fourth-place Redbirds were a mere three games behind first-place Oklahoma. Tom Spencer became manager of the Redbirds in 2013 but was replaced midseason by Danny Sheaffer. Memphis hosted the Triple-A All-Star Game at AutoZone Park in 2003. Players Jason Bowers, Matt Duff, and Jason Ryan represented Memphis, as they were elected to the PCL All-Star Team.

Pitcher Dan Haren was selected for the 2004 PCL All-Star Team and was chosen as the PCL Star of the Game—the most valuable player representing the league. Memphis ended the 2004 season in second place, eight games behind first-place Oklahoma, with a 73–71 record. The team finished third (71–72) in 2005, games behind the eventual league champion Nashville Sounds. From 2006 to 2007, Memphis finished further out of first place with records of 58–86 in 2006 and 56–88 in 2007.

The 2008 season began a reversal of the team&#x27;s fortunes. Though winding up in second place in 2008, the team, under second-year manager Chris Maloney, managed a second-place finish with their 75–67 record. In 2009, the Redbirds&#x27; first-place finish (77–67) earned them the American Conference North Division title and a return to the postseason for the first time in nine seasons. In the American Conference series, Memphis faced the Albuquerque Isotopes, sweeping them in three-straight games. They continued to also defeat the Sacramento River Cats, 3–0, in the finals to win their second PCL championship. They then competed against the International League&#x27;s Durham Bulls in the Bricktown Showdown for the Triple-A National Championship, but were defeated in the single game, 5–4.

Having finished the 2010 season in a tie for first place with the Iowa Cubs (82–62), Memphis was awarded the American Conference North title by virtue of having won the regular season series against Iowa. Memphis started the postseason by defeating the Oklahoma City RedHawks, 3–0, to win the American Conference championship. The Tacoma Rainiers then swept the Redbirds, defeating them for the PCL crown in three-straight games.

The 2011, the club narrowly missed the postseason, finishing second with a 77–66 record. In 2012, manager Chris Maloney, the longest-tenured skipper in team history, was hired as St. Louis&#x27; first base coach. He was replaced by Ron Warner. He led the Redbirds to finish in third place (57–87) and 27 games out of first. The team fared better in 2013, ending up in second place (69–75), just one game behind the eventual league champion Omaha Storm Chasers.

In March 2014, the Redbirds were purchased by their major league parent club, the St. Louis Cardinals. The transaction also included the City of Memphis acquiring AutoZone Park and then leasing it to the team. Ron Warner led his club to a first-place finish (79–64), clinching the American Conference South. They were defeated in the conference series, three games to one, by Omaha, who later won the PCL title. The 2015 club, under manager Mike Shildt, finished in second place (73–71), two games behind the Round Rock Express.

The Cardinals sold their majority interest in the team to Peter B. Freund of Trinity Baseball Holdings in March 2016. Memphis ended the 2016 season in fourth place with a 65–77 record. Prior to the 2017 season, the Redbirds unveiled new logos and uniforms. The primary logo is designed to look like a neon sign, such as those seen on nearby Beale Street, consisting of the team name and a redesigned image of team mascot, Rockey the Redbird. A secondary logo uses similar neon tubing to form an &quot;M&quot; in the shape of a music note to honor the city&#x27;s blues and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll heritage. Led by PCL Manager of the Year Stubby Clapp, the 2017 Redbirds clinched the division title with a 91–50 record. They went on to defeat the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, 3–2, to win the American Conference championship. In the PCL finals, the Redbirds defeated the El Paso Chihuahuas, 3–2, to win their third PCL championship. Memphis lost the Triple-A National Championship Game, 5–3, against the International League&#x27;s Durham Bulls, whom they also faced in 2009.

Stubby Clapp won the PCL Manager of the Year Award for a second time in 2018. Right-hander Dakota Hudson won the PCL Pitcher of the Year Award. The team once again finished with the league&#x27;s best record, winning the 2018 American Southern Division title with an 83–57 record. They defeated the Oklahoma City Dodgers, three games to one, to win the American Conference championship. The Redbirds won their second PCL championship in as many years by beating the Fresno Grizzlies, 3–1. They went on to win the 2018 Triple-A National Championship against the Durham Bulls, 14–4. First baseman Alex Mejia was named the game&#x27;s MVP.

Memphis finished the 2019 season in second place with a 69–71 record under manager Ben Johnson. 

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30.

===Triple-A East / International League (2021–present)===

Following the 2020 season, Major League Baseball assumed control of Minor League Baseball in a move to increase player salaries, modernize facility standards, and reduce travel. As a result, the Pacific Coast League was disbanded, and the Redbirds were placed in the Triple-A East, where they continued to serve as the top farm club for the St. Louis Cardinals. Memphis began competition in the new league on May 4 with a 7–5 loss to the Durham Bulls at AutoZone Park. They lost the next four games before collecting their first Triple-A East win with a 7–6 victory in 10 innings over Durham on May 9. Memphis ended the season in fifth place in the Southeastern Division with a 57–63 record. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. Memphis placed 12th in the league standings. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Memphis finished the tournament tied for 13th place with a 4–4 record.

Prior to the 2022 season, the Redbirds were sold to Diamond Baseball Holdings, a group which operates other affiliated Minor League Baseball teams and is led by Pat Battle and former team owner Peter B. Freund. In 2022, the Triple-A East became known as the International League (IL), the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization. Memphis began IL play with an Opening Night win against the Gwinnett Stripers, 2–1, at AutoZone Park on April 5. They ended the season in sixth place in the Western Division at 73–77. The league began using a split-season format in 2023 in which the teams with the best league-wide records at the end of each half have qualified for the playoffs. Memphis missed the first-half title by nine-and-a-half games, placing eighth at 39–36. They dropped further back in the second half, placing 17th at 32–42, fifteen-and-a-half games back. Overall, the team went 71–78. Luken Baker won the International League Most Valuable Player Award and Masyn Winn was chosen for the IL Top MLB Prospect Award. In 2024, Memphis tied for seventh place in the first-half with a 38–37 mark, 12 games out of first. They finished in 10th place in the second half at 36–37, eleven-and-a-half games back. Their full season record was an even 74–74.

== Season-by-season records ==

== Rivals ==

Memphis&#x27; chief rivals have been those based in Nashville. Located approximately to the northeast and connected to Memphis by Interstate 40, Nashville has fielded several teams which have competed in the same leagues as Memphis&#x27; teams since the late 19th century. The Redbirds entered the rivalry when they joined the Pacific Coast League in 1998. The teams have been division rivals ever since. In 2009, Memphis clinched the American Conference North Division title, finishing the season just two games ahead of Nashville, which spent the majority of the season in first place. Similarly, Memphis finished the 2014 season two-and-a-half games ahead of Nashville despite trailing the Sounds for most of the season. In 2021, both teams were placed in the Southeast Division of the Triple-A East. This became the International League in 2022, and both clubs were realigned into its West Division. As of the completion of the 2024 head-to-head series, the Sounds lead the 27-year rivalry against the Redbirds with a record of 231–197 in 428 meetings.

From 2012 to 2015, the two teams competed in the I-40 Cup Series, a season-long, 16-game promotional series between the clubs. Whichever of the two won the most games played between them was declared the winner and got to keep the trophy cup until the next season. The losing team donated game tickets to a charity selected by the winner. The Sounds won the inaugural 2012 contest (9–7), and Memphis won the 2013 series (7–9). The teams tied the 2014 and 2015 series (both 8–8), but the Redbirds retained the title in both instances. The teams discontinued the promotion after the 2015 season.

== Ballparks ==

=== Tim McCarver Stadium (1998–1999) ===

The Redbirds played their first two seasons at Tim McCarver Stadium while a new, permanent stadium was being constructed downtown. The stadium was built in 1963 for use as an American Legion field. When the Texas League&#x27;s Memphis Blues came to town in 1968, it became their home ballpark. It was later used by the Memphis Chicks until 1997. The stadium, with an 8,800 person capacity, was demolished in 2005.

=== AutoZone Park (2000–present) ===
The Redbirds&#x27; current home ballpark is AutoZone Park, which opened on April 1, 2000, originally seated 16,000 and was later downsized in 2015 to the current seating capacity of 10,000 people. The reduced seating due to $6 million in renovations allowed for picnic tables, seating in grassy areas, and the elimination of the popular left field bluff seating. It was constructed in downtown Memphis at a cost of $80.5 million. It was built to Major League Baseball standards, but with the absence of outfield seats or food vendors far down the foul lines. The first game played at the park was an exhibition between Memphis and St. Louis. A standing-room-only crowd witnessed the big league club defeat their Triple-A affiliate, 10–6.

== Uniforms ==
The Redbirds&#x27; current home jerseys are white with the word &quot;Memphis&quot; written across the chest in red and white characters surrounded by navy blue and neon yellow which resemble a neon sign. The team&#x27;s primary logo is sewn on the right sleeve, and the St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; overlapping &quot;STL&quot; logo is located on the left sleeve. The home cap is solid red with the face of team mascot, Rockey the Redbird, on the front. Road jerseys, though made of gray material, are identical.

An alternate jersey is a power blue pullover v-neck reminiscent of those worn by St. Louis in the 1980s. Striped bands of red, white, and blue adorn the neck and sleeve openings. The front features an image of Rockey the Redbird looking over his shoulder, ball in hand, as if waiting to pitch the ball, on the left chest (this is an homage to a classic St. Louis Cardinals logo, used in the 1950s, sometimes known as the &quot;Dirty Bird&quot;). The primary Memphis logo is displayed on the left sleeve, and the STL lettering is displayed on the right. An alternate cap is navy blue with a red bill and the music note styled &quot;M&quot; on the front.

Memphis&#x27; uniforms from 1998 to 2016 were quite similar to those of the St. Louis Cardinals. Home uniforms consisted of white jerseys with the team&#x27;s primary logo sewn across the chest: the word &quot;Memphis&quot; in red letters surrounded by navy blue set against a yellow baseball bat on which two red cardinals were perched. The player&#x27;s number was displayed on the front left below the Memphis wordmark in red block characters bordered by navy blue. The upper left sleeve had a circular navy blue patch with the St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; overlapping &quot;STL&quot; logo on the center in red letters bordered by white. The player&#x27;s last name was sewn on the back in red block characters surrounded by navy blue, and his number was displayed below his name in the same font and colors. White pants were worn with red belts and predominately red shoes. Some players wore higher pants paired with red socks with white and navy blue stripes. The home cap was solid red with a white &quot;M&quot; bordered by navy blue on the center. Road uniforms were identical to those worn for home games with only a few exceptions: jerseys and pants were made from gray material, the St. Louis patch was absent from the sleeve, and the cap was navy blue with a red button and a red &quot;M&quot; with white border.

==Television and radio==
All Memphis Redbirds games are televised live on MiLB.TV. Jack Keffer is the team&#x27;s lead broadcaster. Steve Selby was the voice of the Redbirds from 2000 until before the 2021 season, when he retired. Evan Stockton followed Selby as the lead broadcaster in 2021. Past broadcast commentators have included Tom Stocker, David Kelly, Charlie Lea, and Reggie Williams. Since 2018, a select number of games are also broadcast on KTRS 550 AM in St. Louis, allowing Cardinals fans to keep tabs on up-and-coming players as well as promoting the Redbirds and Memphis tourism to the St. Louis market.

==Mascot==
The Memphis Redbirds&#x27; mascot is an anthropomorphic cardinal named Rockey the Redbird. He is bright red with black eyebrows and feathers around the face and a yellow beak and legs. He wears the same style jerseys as the team bearing the number 901, which is Memphis&#x27; telephone area code. He made his debut in the Redbirds&#x27; inaugural 1998 season.

==Roster==
== Achievements ==

=== Awards ===
Six individuals have won league awards in recognition of their performance while with the Redbirds. Stubby Clapp won the PCL Manager of the Year Award in 2017 and 2018. Dakota Hudson was selected for the PCL Pitcher of the Year Award in 2018. Luken Baker won the IL Most Valuable Player Award in 2023. Masyn Winn won the IL Top MLB Prospect Award in 2023. Additionally, two members of the front office staff have won the PCL Executive of the Year Award: Allie Prescott (2000) and Ben Weiss (2012).

Thirty-seven players have been selected for the midseason Triple-A All-Star Game. Of those players, only Brandon Dickson (2010 and 2012) and Ryan Sherriff (2016 and 2017) have been selected twice while playing for Memphis. Two players have been chosen as the All-Star Game&#x27;s MVP: Dan Haren (2004) and Michael Wacha (2013).

=== Retired numbers ===
The Memphis Redbirds have not honored any of their players by retiring their uniform numbers. However, the St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; retired numbers are also retired throughout the Cardinals&#x27; minor league organization. When a number is retired, only the player with the retired number can wear that number if he returns to that team as a player or coach. This ensures that the number will be associated with one player of particular importance to the team. The following numbers are, therefore, also retired by Memphis:

==Managers==

Over the course of 27 seasons, the Memphis Redbirds have employed 8 managers. The duties of the team manager include team strategy and leadership on and off the field. Three managers have guided the team to win the Pacific Coast League championship: Gaylen Pitts (2000), Chris Maloney (2009), and Stubby Clapp (2017 and 2018). Clapp also led Memphis to the Triple-A championship in 2018. Maloney is the longest-tenured manager in team history, having managed the team for 717 games from 2007 to 2011.

<text>Corey James Dillon (born October 24, 1974) is an American former professional football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 10 seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals and New England Patriots. He played college football for the Washington Huskies, where he was a third-team All-American and first-team All-Pac-10 in 1996, and was selected by the Bengals in the second round of the 1997 NFL draft.

During his seven years with the Bengals, Dillon set several franchise records and earned three consecutive Pro Bowl selections. He played for the Patriots in his last three seasons, where he was named to his fourth Pro Bowl and won Super Bowl XXXIX. Dillon retired with over 11,000 rushing yards and is 20th in NFL career rushing yards. For his accomplishments in Cincinnati, he was inducted to the Bengals Ring of Honor in 2024.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, Dillon attended Franklin High School, where he teamed with his cousin, Ed Raiford, to form one of the state&#x27;s all-time twosomes for the Quakers football team. Dillon and Raiford garnered Parade, USA, Best In The West and Tom Flemming All-American awards. Both were two-sport standouts, Raiford also starred as an All-State basketball player while Dillon starred in baseball. An excellent baseball catcher, Dillon garnered All-Metro honors, and was selected by the San Diego Padres in the 1993 Major League Baseball draft.

==College career==
Dillon played junior college football as a freshman at Garden City Community College in Kansas and rushed for 1165 yards and 16 TDs in 1994. The following year, he played for Dixie State College in St. George, Utah, and rushed for 1899 yards and 20 TDs in 279 attempts. Dillon was chosen JC Offensive Back of the Year by College Sports magazine.

At the University of Washington in Seattle, Dillon played one season of college football with the Huskies in 1996. Known for using a very aggressive and punishing style of running, Dillon set the team all-time single-season records for rushing yards (1,695 yards) and touchdowns scored (24). In the first quarter against San Jose State in mid-November, Dillon rushed for 222 yards and caught an 83-yard touchdown pass, setting NCAA records for both rushing yards and all-purpose yards (305) in one quarter. Dillon did not re-enter the game as the Huskies were comfortably ahead 25–0 by the end of the first quarter on a cold and rainy afternoon. The Dawgs led 43–3 at the half and won 53–10.

In the 1996 Holiday Bowl against Colorado, Dillon rushed for 140 yards and added two more touchdowns to his regular-season total of 23. He scored five TDs in a 41–21 victory over UCLA, earning &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; National Player of the Week honors as he rushed for 145 yards and added 53 yards in receptions.

==Professional career==
===Cincinnati Bengals===
The Cincinnati Bengals selected Dillon in the second round of the 1997 NFL draft, the 43rd overall pick. During his first season in 1997, Dillon rushed 39 times for 246 yards and 4 touchdowns in a 41–14 win over the Tennessee Oilers, breaking Jim Brown&#x27;s rookie single-game record that had stood for 40 years. That game remains a Bengals rookie record for carries, yards, and touchdowns, and franchise record for touchdowns. His 1,129 yards that season is also still a Bengals rookie record. 
For six seasons, Dillon was one of the few bright spots on otherwise struggling Bengals teams. Dillon voiced his frustrations with the team and owner Mike Brown, stating &quot;we will never win with the Brown family in Cincinnati,&quot; after a 2001 game. 
From 1997 to 2002, he rushed for over 1,000 yards each year, and made the Pro Bowl 3 times from 1999 to 2001. On October 22, 2000, Dillon set an NFL record for most yards rushed in one game (278 yards) against the Denver Broncos, breaking Walter Payton&#x27;s single-game mark of 275 yards set in 1977. That record has since been broken by Jamal Lewis (295 yards) on September 14, 2003, and Adrian Peterson (296 yards) on November 4, 2007. Dillon&#x27;s mark remains a franchise record for yards and yards-per-carry (12.64).

In 2003, Dillon rushed 138 times for 541 yards and two touchdowns due to injury.

===New England Patriots===
In 2004, Dillon was traded to the New England Patriots for a second-round pick, which the Bengals later used to draft Madieu Williams.

In the 2004 season, Dillon set career highs and franchise records with 1,635 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns. He was a major factor in the Patriots&#x27; win over the Indianapolis Colts in New England&#x27;s first playoff game that season, rushing for 144 yards and catching 5 passes for 17 yards. New England won its third Super Bowl, due in no small part to the running game built around Dillon. He was the top rusher of Super Bowl XXXIX with 75 rushing yards and a touchdown, while also catching 3 passes for 31 yards, for 106 total yards. Overall, Dillon rushed for a total of 292 yards, caught 9 passes for 53 yards, and scored 2 touchdowns in New England&#x27;s 3 postseason games.

In 2005, while injury problems plagued Dillon and he was not able to duplicate his stats from 2004, he remained a major contributor to the team, rushing for 733 yards and 12 touchdowns in 12 games. The Patriots used Dillon more frequently as a pass receiver, with 23 receptions for 193 yards and a touchdown, which was more receiving yards than he had gained in his past 2 seasons combined.

In the 2006 season, Dillon began sharing the team&#x27;s rushing duties with rookie running back Laurence Maroney. With the retirement of Curtis Martin, he spent his final year as the NFL&#x27;s active leader in career rushing yards. He finished the year with 812 rushing yards and a career-high 13 touchdowns, tied him for third in the league that season.

===Retirement===
The Patriots released Dillon on March 2, 2007. Dillon subsequently told the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; in August that he would retire from the NFL. A month later, Dillon admitted to considering a comeback with the Patriots with the season-ending injury to RB Sammy Morris, but ultimately remained retired.

<text>Jack Kelley is a former reporter for &quot;USA Today&quot;. Kelley resigned in 2004 following a scandal.

==Scandal==
Kelley is best known for his professional downfall in 2004, when it was revealed that he had long been fabricating stories, going so far as to write up scripts so associates could pretend to be sources during an investigation of his actions by others at the newspaper.

The newspaper conducted an extensive review of Kelley&#x27;s stories, sending investigators (including reporter and former mid-level editor Mark Memmott) to Cuba, Israel, and Serbia to check his work and sift through stacks of hotel records to determine if Kelley was where he claimed to be when filing stories. On 26 January 2004, Nataša Kandić of the Humanitarian Law Center in Belgrade disputed his account of using her as a source for a July 1999 front-page story on a typed Yugoslav Army order to &quot;cleanse&quot; a village in Kosovo.

The same month, Kelley resigned but denied the charges. The &quot;USA Today&quot; publisher, Craig Moon, issued a public apology on the front page of the newspaper. The scandal led to the resignations of two key staff members at the newspaper, top editor Karen Jurgensen and News section managing editor Hal Ritter in April 2004.

==Aftermath==
Kelley sometimes did volunteer services with Free the Children. He lives with his wife, Jacki Kelley, the global chief executive for Universal McCann, a media agency based in New York, in New Canaan, Connecticut.

<text>The Sylver (système de lancement vertical) is a vertical launching system (VLS) designed by DCNS and introduced in 2001.

==Specifications==

The basic unit of Sylver VLS is an eight-cell module fitted with two rows of 56 cm missile cells surrounding the uptake for exhaust gas, and the specifications for different models are as follows:
 
The launcher comes in several variants, each distinguished by their height. A-35 and A-43 were developed for launching short range surface-to-air missiles, the A-50 for the long-range PAAMS air defense system, and the A-70 launcher for longer missiles such as the MdCN naval land attack cruise missile. The numbers refer to the approximate length of the missile which can be accommodated, in decimetres, i.e. the A-43 can hold missiles which are up to long whilst the A-70 can accommodate missiles up to long.

The launchers come in eight-cell modules, except A-35 available in four-cell modules, with each eight-cell module occupying of deck space. Inner size cell is long and wide, and each cell has its own exhaust vent. Crotale NG (VT1) missiles can be quad-packed in one cell.

The primary application of the launcher has been the Aster. The Sylver, together with the Aster, is the primary component of the PAAMS naval anti-air warfare system. Using PAAMS, up to eight missiles can be launched in 10 seconds.

France has developed a sea-based deep strike cruise missile capable of being launched from the Sylver. Called the MdCN, the missile gives the French Navy a land-attack capability in the mould of the U.S. Tomahawk.

<text>NIQ (also known as NielsenIQ, formerly known as ACNielsen or AC Nielsen) is a global marketing research firm, with worldwide headquarters in Chicago, United States. The company has approximately 30,000 employees and operates in more than 100 countries. NIQ acquired German market research firm GfK in 2023.

Until March 2021, it was a part of Nielsen Holdings. Nielsen Holdings divested its consumer intelligence (by then known as NielsenIQ) business to private equity firm Advent International. The business later rebranded to NIQ.

== Activities ==
A market research tool is the Homescan program where sample members track and report all grocery and retail purchases, allowing purchasing patterns to be related to household demographics. Homescan covers several countries including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In 2004, ACNielsen chose the CipherLab CPT-8001 as its data collection terminal for the Homescan program throughout Asia. The Homescan program is now known as National Consumer Panel (after formation of a joint venture with Circana) in the United States.

NIQ manages the Nielsen BookScan services outside the United States. The company acts as ISBN agency for the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.

NIQ has several marketing and retail research products for companies such as BASES and Brandbank.

In Germany, NIQ (via its subsidiary GfK) manages the GfK Entertainment charts for music, home video, and video game sales.

A former service was the Nielsen ratings, an audience measurement system that measures television, radio and newspaper audiences in their respective media markets. In 1950, A.C. Nielsen acquired the C. E. Hooper company and began attaching recording devices to a statistical sample of about 1200 consumer television sets in the United States. These devices used photographic film in mail-in cartridges to record the channels viewed by the consumer and thus determine audience size. Later, A.C. Nielsen developed electronic methods of data collection and transmission. In 1996, AC Nielsen split off this part of its operations into a separate company called Nielsen Media Research (NMR), which operated as an independent company until it was acquired by Dutch conglomerate VNU in 1999. The company was headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut before the acquisition by VNU. The Nielsen Media Research later evolved into Global Media division of Nielsen Holdings and separated from Global Connect division (known as NielsenIQ) in 2021.

== History ==
A.C. Nielsen Company was founded in 1923 in Chicago by Arthur C. Nielsen Sr. in order to give marketers reliable and objective information on the impact of marketing and sales programs. The company began expanding internationally in 1939, their first location outside of the USA was in the United Kingdom in the city of Oxford, of which today still remains NIQ&#x27;s UK HQ.

The company was acquired by the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Company (D&amp;B) in 1984. In 1996, D&amp;B divided AC Nielsen into two separate companies: Nielsen Media Research, which was responsible for TV ratings, and ACNielsen Corporation, which was responsible for consumer shopping trends and box-office data.

In 2001, ACNielsen Corporation itself was acquired by Dutch company Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen (VNU), as part of VNU&#x27;s Marketing Information group, and came under the same corporate umbrella as NMR, the company it spawned (VNU acquired NMR in 1999).

In 2005, ACNielsen initiated their MVP (Media Voice Panel) program. Panel members carry an electronic monitor that detects the digital station and program identification codes hidden within the TV and radio broadcasts they are exposed to. At night, members place the monitor in a cradle that sends the collected data through the home&#x27;s electrical wiring to a relay device that transmits it by phone, making it one of the first practical uses of electrical wiring as a home network. With an approximately one week notice to members, the MVP program ended on March 17, 2008.

In 2007, the owner VNU changed its name to Nielsen Company.

Arthur Charles Nielsen Jr. (born April 8, 1919) the man who acquired the company from his father, died at the age of 92 on October 3, 2011.

On October 8, 2014, Nielsen acquired Affinnova, an international media and marketing research firm. The Affinnova team joins Nielsen&#x27;s legacy BASES team to form Nielsen&#x27;s Innovation Practice area.

On January 22, 2015, Nielsen acquired Brandbank, specialized in the process of digitally collecting, managing and distributing FMCG product and brand image content for retail syndication across in-store, print promotional and e-commerce platforms.

Nielsen Holdings spun off its consumer data and intelligence business (the former ACNielsen part) as NielsenIQ in January 2021 and then sold the business to private equity firm Advent International in March 2021.

NIQ gained approval from the European Union to acquire GfK after an antitrust investigation that began in June 2023. This approval was given under the condition of selling GfK consumer panel business, which went to the British market research company YouGov in July 2023.

<doc id="636774" wikidata="Q6107554" url="?curid=636774" title="J26 G8 protests">
<text>J26 was a smaller-size convergence in what is commonly called the anti-globalization movement. It took place in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in June 2002 during the Group of Eight summit in nearby Kananaskis.

A protest called &quot;Take the Capital!&quot; took place in Ottawa on the same day, targeting those who could not make it out west.

J26 was also the name of a night march and street party held a year later.

== Background ==

When G8 decided to hold a summit in the mountain resort of Kananaskis, local activists prepared a response. Initial plans included a large tent city, directly outside the summit area (which was to be surrounded by a fence and defended by thousands of police and soldiers). Plans for this fell through, however, and most G8 protest was confined to the city of Calgary. Calgary, the closest city to Kananaskis, was to house the lower-level G8 delegates who would be linked to the summit via video-link.

== Prelude ==

In the week before the G8 meetings began, the Group of 6 Billion (G6B) counter-summit was held in Calgary. On Sunday, June 23, the first anti-G8 protest was held, taking the form of a permitted, non-violent Community Solidarity March, during which some 6,000 people marched over a short distance and held a rally near the area where G8 delegates would be housed. Over the next couple of days, a number of other small protests were held.

On the evening of June 25, some 2,000 people took part in the Showdown at the Ho-Down, a march and street party outside of a party being held by Calgary&#x27;s mayor for lower-level G8 delegates.

== J26 ==

At 6 A.M. on the morning of June 26, protesters began to converge in the east end of the downtown core. The plan was to stage a &quot;snake march&quot; to close down the main thoroughfares in the downtown core, in order to prevent corporate offices from functioning and to disrupt the lower-level G8 meetings. The march route was to be improvised by a nucleus in the centre, based on the situation.

The snake march got under way at 7 A.M. The march moved along steadily, stopping at several corporate targets and creating gridlock in some areas. The city police made only one attempt to turn the march back, and eventually backed down. Riot police remained hidden from view, with several teams of police mounted on bikes shadowing the march. By late morning, some 5,000 protesters had converged on the downtown core, and the snake march came to an end. At this point, the core was broken into &quot;red&quot; and &quot;yellow&quot; zones, with a &quot;green&quot; zone across the river. The zone system was developed for the Summit of the Americas demonstrations in Quebec City the previous year. The red zone was an area for groups intending to practice active civil disobedience with a high risk of arrest. The yellow zone was for demonstrators taking part in non-permitted events that carried a slight risk of arrest.

The zone system was developed for the Summit of the Americas demonstrations in Quebec City the previous year. The red zone was an area for groups intending to practice active civil disobedience with a high risk of arrest. The yellow zone was for demonstrators taking part in non-permitted events that carried a slight risk of arrest. The green zone was for the elderly and faint of heart - here discussion predominated. In the green zone, some partook of glasses of wine, while others chattered away merrily. In the yellow zone, protesters took over Olympic Plaza and staged a Die-In action. In the red zone, a march began, made up in large part by the &quot;black bloc&quot;. The march took over two intersections outside of large corporate headquarters and held them while some protesters played a game of soccer in the street and others graffitied the area. Later on, protesters barricaded a McDonald&#x27;s outlet and scuffled with police. Other protesters attempted to control the streets around the hotel and convention centre where G8 delegates were meeting.

== Conclusion ==

The J26 protests were much less violent than similar demonstrations in the few previous years. Despite some confrontations with police, no teargas was used and only a handful of people were arrested.

The protests did not significantly impede the G8 meetings from taking place. Many corporate offices in Calgary were shut down for part of the day (in some cases the whole day), but in many cases, this was probably because many office workers simply didn&#x27;t bother going in to work, knowing that the protests could trap them in gridlock.

The effect of J26 on the movement in general was also mixed. Many demonstrators who had come to the protests expecting a broader confrontation left demoralised. The protests did, however, manage to direct the media&#x27;s attention to the issues of human rights, social justice and environmentalism that motivated the protesters; the small activist community in Calgary was also bolstered by the demonstrations, leading to the largest protests in the city&#x27;s history the following year.

<text>The Maelor is an area of north-east Wales along the border with England. It is now entirely part of Wrexham County Borough. The name &quot;Maelor&quot; is an old Welsh word: it can be translated as &quot;land of the prince&quot;, from &quot;mael&quot; (&quot;prince&quot;) and &quot;llawr&quot; (&quot;low ground&quot;, &quot;region&quot;).

==History==
The Maelor originated as a cantref of the Kingdom of Powys, focused on the monastic settlement of Bangor-on-Dee and containing the commotes of Maelor, Yale (Iâl), the Alyn Valley (Ystrad Alun) and Hope (Yr Hob). 

Most of the area fell under control of the Kingdom of Mercia during the eighth century, with Offa&#x27;s Dyke delineating the new border. By the time of the 1066 Norman conquest of England, its eastern areas were recorded as held by Edwin, Earl of Mercia: they were later granted to the Norman magnate Hugh d&#x27;Avranches, Earl of Chester. The lands of the Maelor were only reincorporated in Powys during the reign of Stephen of England (1135–54) by Madog ap Maredudd. He died in 1160 and the kingdom was subdivided amongst his heirs.

By the early 13th century, when it was part of the lands of Madog ap Gruffydd, Prince of Powys Fadog, the Maelor was divided into two parts. Maelor Gymraeg (&quot;Welsh Maelor&quot;), also known by the English name Bromfield, lay west of the river Dee and was based on the commotes of Wrexham and Merford. Maelor Saesneg (&quot;English Maelor&quot;) included parts of the parishes of Overton, Ellesmere, Whittington and Oswestry; &quot;Malaur Saisnec&quot; appears in a document as early as 1202. &quot;Saesneg&quot; (&quot;English&quot;) is believed to relate specifically to the area&#x27;s religious administration rather than linguistic factors, as it was historically part of the ancient Diocese of Lichfield and Chester. The Welsh Maelor remained within the Diocese of St Asaph.

Welsh political control of the area ceased in 1282-3 following Edward I&#x27;s conquest of Wales. The English Maelor became a personal property of the crown and in 1284, along with other royal estates in the region, was amalgamated into the new county of Flintshire, while the Welsh Maelor remained part of the Marcher Lordship of Bromfield and Yale, which Edward granted to Earl John de Warenne.

==English Maelor==
The English Maelor () is the area east of the River Dee extending almost to Whitchurch. In 1397, under Richard II of England, the English Maelor was attached to the County Palatine of Chester to form the Principality of Chester. It continued as a personal possession of the crown until 1536 and the Laws in Wales Acts.

Although part of Flintshire, the administrative changes of 1536 confirmed the Hundred of Maelor or English Maelor as an exclave, surrounded by Cheshire, Shropshire and Denbighshire. The administrative centre of the area, often referred to as &quot;Flintshire Detached&quot;, was Overton and it included the villages of Bangor-on-Dee, Bettisfield, Bronington, Hanmer, Halghton, Penley, Tybroughton, Willington and Worthenbury. 

In 1887 a Boundary Commission was appointed to review the boundaries of counties in England and Wales. At an inquiry at Overton, it was found that most of the population of the area favoured it becoming part of Shropshire, and this was later supported by resolution of the Flintshire justices of the peace. However, when local government legislation was introduced no change was made.

Under the Local Government Act 1894, the area became Overton Rural District, which was again renamed in 1953 as Maelor Rural District, remaining as a detached part of Flintshire until 1974.

==Maelor Gymraeg==
The &quot;Maelor Gymraeg&quot;, the &quot;Welsh Maelor&quot;, is the part of the Maelor lying to the west of the River Dee. It included parts of the ancient parishes of Bersham, Erbistock, Marchwiel, Ruabon, Wrexham and Gresford. 

After the Edwardian conquest this area continued as part of the Lordship of Bromfield and Yale until 1536, when it was included in the newly created county of Denbighshire as the Hundred of Bromfield.

==The Maelor today==

In 1974, local government in Wales was reorganised, and both halves of the Maelor were included in Wrexham Maelor, one of six districts in the new county of Clwyd. In 1996 a further local government reorganisation took place, and Maelor became part of the newly created county borough of Wrexham.

<text>, also known as English Maelor, comprises one half of the Maelor region on the Welsh side of the Wales-England border, being the area of the Maelor east of the River Dee. The region has changed counties several times, previously being part of Cheshire and later a detached portion of Flintshire. The area is currently in Wales, despite its name, and administered as part of Wrexham County Borough.

The name &quot;Maelor&quot; is an old Welsh word: it can be translated as &quot;land of the prince&quot;, from &quot;mael&quot; &quot;prince&quot; and &quot;llawr&quot; &quot;low ground&quot;, &quot;region&quot;. &quot;Malaur Saisnec&quot; appears in a document as early as 1202: &quot;Saesneg&quot; (&quot;English&quot;) is believed to relate specifically to the area&#x27;s religious administration, as it was historically part of the ancient Diocese of Lichfield and Chester.

==History==

At the time of the Roman invasion, the area was part of the region occupied by the Cornovii, one of the Celtic tribes of ancient Britain, on the border with the Deceangli tribe across the River Dee to the west. Following Roman Britain, and the emergence of various petty kingdoms, the region was ruled within the Kingdom of Powys until falling to the Kingdom of Mercia by the late 8th century under Aethelbald.

At the time of the Domesday Book (1086) it was part of the Earldom of Chester listed as part of the Cheshire Hundred of Duddestan; Bettisfield was the largest settlement, with 28 households. 

The English Maelor is first recorded as a separate lordship from the Maelor in 1202. It was inherited by Gruffydd Maelor II in 1236 when his father, Madog ap Gruffydd Maelor, died and his kingdom was divided between his five sons. Gruffydd married Emma Audley of Shropshire, who was subsequently dispossessed of the lands by Llywelyn the Great on the death of Gruffudd in 1269. 

Llywelyn ap Gruffudd surrendered the English Maelor to Edward I in 1282 following military campaigns; he then awarded it to Queen Eleanor. In 1309, under Edward II, it was granted to Queen Isabella. In 1397, under Richard II of England, it merged with the County Palatine of Chester to form &quot;the Principality of Chester&quot; restored to an earldom from 1398 by Henry IV.

In 1536, under the rule of Henry VIII, the area became an exclave of the county of Flintshire, surrounded by Cheshire, Shropshire and Denbighshire, as the Hundred of Maelor, later often called &quot;Flintshire Detached&quot;. The Welsh Maelor, or &quot;Maelor Gymraeg&quot;, was included in Denbighshire. The English Maelor&#x27;s market town and administrative centre was Overton: its constituent parts were the parishes of Bangor on Dee and Worthenbury, the three townships of Overton Villa, Overton Foreign and Knolton in the parish of Overton, Penley township from the Shropshire parish of Ellesmere, Iscoyd township in the Shropshire parish of Malpas, and Wallington, Halghton, Tybroughton, Bronington, Hanmer and Bettisfield townships in the parish of Hanmer.

In 1887, a Boundary Commission was appointed to review these nationally. At an inquiry at Overton, it was found that most of the population favoured becoming part of Shropshire, and this was later supported by resolution of the Flintshire justices of the peace. However, when local government legislation was introduced no change was made.

Under the Local Government Act 1894 the area became Overton Rural District. The administrative county of Flintshire was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and the area became part of Clwyd. Since Clwyd was itself abolished in 1996 under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, the area has been administered as part of Wrexham County Borough.

<doc id="636780" wikidata="Q253315" url="?curid=636780" title="Lynndie England">
<text>Lynndie Rana England (born November 8, 1982) is a former United States Army Reserve soldier who was prosecuted for mistreating detainees during the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse that occurred at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad during the Iraq War. She was one of 11 military personnel from the 372nd Military Police Company who were convicted in 2005 for war crimes. After being sentenced to three years in prison and a dishonorable discharge, England was incarcerated from September 27, 2005, to March 1, 2007, when she was released on parole.

==Early life==
Born in Ashland, Kentucky, England moved with her family to Fort Ashby, West Virginia, when she was two years old. She was raised by her mother, Terrie Bowling England, and her father Kenneth R. England Jr., a railroad worker who worked at a station in Cumberland, Maryland. She aspired to be a storm chaser. As a young child, England was diagnosed with selective mutism, a form of an anxiety disorder.

England joined the United States Army Reserve in Cumberland in 1999 while she was a junior at Frankfort High School near Short Gap. England worked as a cashier in an IGA store during her junior year of high school and married a co-worker in 2002, but they later divorced. England also wished to earn money for college, so that she could become a storm chaser. She was also a member of the Future Farmers of America. After graduating from Frankfort High School in 2001, she worked a night job in a chicken-processing factory in Moorefield. She was deployed to Iraq in June 2003.

England was engaged to fellow reservist and Abu Ghraib prison guard Charles Graner. In 2004, she gave birth to a son fathered by him at Womack Army Medical Center at Fort Bragg.

==Involvement in prisoner abuse==

England mobilized with her Army Reserve unit and was stationed in Baghdad at the Abu Ghraib prison in March 2003 to perform guard duties. Along with other soldiers, she was investigated in late 2003 for mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners of war involving the infliction of sexual, physical and psychological abuse after photographs came to light showing prisoners being abused.

While formal charges were being prepared for general court-martial, England was transferred to the U.S. military installation at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on March 18, 2004, because of her pregnancy. Her court-martial was scheduled for September 2005 on charges of conspiracy to maltreat prisoners and assault consummated by battery.

On April 30, 2005, England agreed to plead guilty to four counts of maltreating prisoners, two counts of conspiracy, and one count of dereliction of duty. In exchange, prosecutors would have dropped two other charges, committing indecent acts and failure to obey a lawful order. This plea deal would have reduced her maximum sentence from 16 years to 11 years had it been accepted by the military judge. In May 2005, however, Military Judge Colonel James Pohl declared a mistrial on the grounds that he could not accept England&#x27;s plea of guilty to a charge of conspiring with Graner to maltreat detainees because Graner had testified that he believed that, in placing a tether around a naked detainee&#x27;s neck and asking England to pose for a photograph with him, he was documenting a legitimate use of force. Graner was convicted on all charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison. At her retrial, England was convicted on September 26, 2005, of one count of conspiracy, four counts of maltreating detainees and one count of committing an indecent act. She was acquitted on a second conspiracy count. The next day, England was sentenced to a three-year prison term and a dishonorable discharge.

Members of the United States Senate have reportedly reviewed additional photographs supplied by the Department of Defense that have not been publicly released. There has been considerable speculation as to the contents of these photos. In a March 2008 interview, England stated in response to a question about these unreleased pictures, &quot;You see the dogs biting the prisoners. Or you see bite marks from the dogs. You can see MPs holding down a prisoner so a medic can give him a shot.&quot;

England was incarcerated at Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar. She was paroled on March 1, 2007, after serving 521 days, less than 17 months. She remained on parole through September 2008 until her three-year sentence was complete, whereupon she was discharged.

In a May 11, 2004, interview with the Denver CBS owned-and-operated television station KCNC-TV, England reportedly said that she had been &quot;instructed by persons in higher ranks&quot; to commit acts of abuse as a form of psychological operations, and that she should keep doing it, because it worked as intended. England noted that she felt &quot;weird&quot; when a commanding officer asked her to do such things as &quot;stand there, give the thumbs up, and smile.&quot; However, England felt that she was doing &quot;nothing out of the ordinary.&quot;

==Later life==

After serving her sentence, England returned to Fort Ashby, West Virginia, and stayed with friends and family. 

On July 9, 2007, England was appointed to the Keyser, West Virginia volunteer recreation board. In July 2009, England released &quot;Tortured: Lynndie England, Abu Ghraib and the Photographs that Shocked the World&quot;, a biography that was set with a book tour that she hoped would rehabilitate her public image. As of 2009, England was on antidepressant medication and also had post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. As of 2013, she had found seasonal employment as a secretary.

In March 2008, England told the German magazine &quot;Stern&quot; that the media was to blame for the consequences of the Abu Ghraib scandal:

If the media hadn&#x27;t exposed the pictures to that extent, then thousands of lives would have been saved ... Yeah, I took the photos but I didn&#x27;t make it worldwide.

Asked about the picture of her posing with Graner in front of a pyramid of naked men, she said:

At the time I thought, I love this man [Graner], I trust this man with my life, okay, then he&#x27;s saying, well, there&#x27;s seven of them and it&#x27;s such an enclosed area and it&#x27;ll keep them together and contained because they have to concentrate on staying up on the pyramid instead of doing something to us.

Asked about the picture showing her pointing at a man forced to masturbate, she again referred to her feelings for Graner at the time:

Graner and Frederick tried to convince me to get into the picture with this guy. I didn&#x27;t want to, but they were really persistent about it. At the time I didn&#x27;t think that it was something that needed to be documented but I followed Graner. I did everything he wanted me to do. I didn&#x27;t want to lose him.

In a 16 January 2009 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, England reiterated:

... that she was goaded into posing for the photographs by her then lover and more senior fellow soldier, Charles Graner. &#x27;They said in the trial that authority figures really intimidate me. I always aim to please.&#x27;

In 2012, following her release, she stated that she did not regret her actions. &quot;Their (Iraqis&#x27;) lives are better. They got the better end of the deal,&quot; she said. &quot;They weren&#x27;t innocent. They&#x27;re trying to kill us, and you want me to apologize to them? It&#x27;s like saying sorry to the enemy.&quot;

<text>A domestic worker is a person who works within a residence and performs a variety of household services for an individual, from providing cleaning and household maintenance, or cooking, laundry and ironing, or care for children and elderly dependents, and other household errands. The term &quot;domestic service&quot; applies to the equivalent occupational category. In traditional English contexts, such a person was said to be &quot;in service&quot;.

Some domestic workers live within their employer&#x27;s household. In some cases, the contribution and skill of servants whose work encompassed complex management tasks in large households have been highly valued. However, for the most part, domestic work tends to be demanding and is commonly considered to be undervalued, despite often being necessary. Although legislation protecting domestic workers is in place in many countries, it is often not extensively enforced. In many jurisdictions, domestic work is poorly regulated and domestic workers are subject to serious abuses, including slavery.

&quot;Servant&quot; is an older English word for &quot;domestic worker&quot;, though not all servants worked inside the home. Domestic service, or the employment of people for wages in their employer&#x27;s residence, was sometimes simply called &quot;service&quot; and has often been part of a hierarchical system. In Britain, a highly developed system of domestic service peaked towards the close of the Victorian era (a period known in the United States as the Gilded Age and in France as the Belle Époque), perhaps reaching its most complicated and rigidly structured state during the Edwardian period which reflected the limited social mobility before World War I.

==History==
In 2015, the International Labour Organization (ILO), based on national surveys or censuses of 232 countries and territories, estimated the number of domestic workers at 67.1 million, but the ILO itself states that &quot;experts say that due to the fact that this kind of work is often hidden and unregistered, the total number of domestic workers could be as high as 100 million&quot;. The ILO also states that 83% of domestic workers are women and many are migrant workers.

In Guatemala, it is estimated that 11.8% percent of all women working in 2020 were employed as domestic workers. They hardly have any legal protection. According to Guatemalan labor law, domestic work is &quot;not subject to schedules or limitations of working day.&quot; However, by law, domestic workers are still entitled to ten hours of free time in 24 hours, and an additional six hours off on Sundays. But very often, these minimal employment laws are disregarded, and so are basic civil liberties.

In Brazil, domestic workers must be hired under a registered contract and have many of the rights enjoyed by other workers, which include a minimum wage, remunerated vacations (paid leave) and a remunerated weekly day off. It is not uncommon, however, for employers to hire servants illegally and fail to offer a work contract. Since domestic staff predominantly come from disadvantaged groups with less access to education, they are often vulnerable and uninformed of their rights, especially in rural areas. Nevertheless, domestics employed without a proper contract can successfully sue their employers and be compensated for abuse committed. It is common in Brazil for domestic staff, including childcare staff, to be required to wear uniforms, while this requirement has fallen out of use in other countries.

In the United States, domestic workers are generally excluded from many of the legal protections afforded to other classes of worker, including the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act. However, in recent years, advocacy groups like the National Domestic Workers&#x27; Alliance have succeeded in passing a Domestic Worker&#x27;s Bill of Rights in New York, Hawaii, California, and Illinois.

Traditionally domestic workers have mostly been women and are likely to be immigrants. Currently, there are 1.8 million domestic workers, and tens of thousands of people are believed to be in forced labor in the United States. America&#x27;s domestic home help workers, most of them female members of minority groups, earn low wages and often receive no retirement or health benefits because of the lack of basic labor protections.

Domestic workers are also excluded from time off, paid sick leave, and paid overtime, with only thirteen percent of domestic workers having health insurance provided by their employers. A report from the National Domestic Workers Alliance and affiliated groups found that nearly a quarter of nannies, caregivers, and home health workers make less than the minimum wage in the states in which they work, and nearly half – 48 percent – are paid less than needed to adequately support a family. Many of these workers are subjected to abuse, sexual harassment, and social inequality. However, because domestic workers work in the home, their struggles are hidden in the home and out of the public spotlight. Nowadays with an increase of power, the domestic workers&#x27; community has formed many organizations, such as the National Domestic Workers Alliance, Domestic Workers United, and The South African Domestic Service and Allied Workers Union.

The domestic work industry is dominated throughout the world by women. While the domestic work industry is advantageous for women in that it provides them a sector that they have substantial access to, it can also prove to be disadvantageous by reinforcing gender inequality through the idea that domestic work is an industry that should be dominated by women. Within the domestic work industry, the much smaller proportion of jobs that is occupied by men are not the same jobs that are typically occupied by women. Within the childcare industry, men make up only about 3–6% of all workers. Additionally, in the child care industry men are more likely to fill roles that are not domestic in nature but administrative such as a managerial role in a daycare center.

While the domestic work industry was once believed to be an industry that belonged to a past type of society and did not belong in a modern world, trends are showing that although elements of the domestic work industry have been changing the industry itself has shown no signs of fading away, but only signs of transformation. There are several specific causes that are credited to continuing the cycle of the demand for domestic work. One of these causes is that with more women taking up full-time jobs, a dually employed household with children places a heavy burden on parents. It is argued however that this burden would not result in the demand for outside domestic work if men and women were providing equal levels of effort in domestic work and child-rearing within their own home.

The demand for domestic workers has also become primarily fulfilled by migrant domestic workers from other countries who flock to wealthier nations to fulfill the demand for help at home. This trend of domestic workers flowing from poorer nations to richer nations creates a relationship that on some levels encourages the liberation of one group of people at the expense of the exploitation of another. Although domestic work has far from begun to fade from society, the demand for it and the people who fill that demand has changed drastically over time.

The so-called &quot;servant problem&quot; in such countries as the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada was the problem that middle-class families had with cleaning, cooking, and especially entertaining at the level that was socially expected. It was too much work for any one person to do herself, but middle-class families, unlike wealthy families, could not afford to pay the wages necessary to attract and retain skilled household employees.

==Legal protections==

The United Kingdom&#x27;s Master and Servant Act 1823 was the first of its kind; the terms referred generally to employers and employees. The Act influenced the creation of domestic service laws in other nations, although legislation tended to favour employers. However, before the passing of such Acts servants, and workers in general, had no protection in law. The only real advantage that domestic service provided was the provision of meals, accommodation, and sometimes clothes, in addition to a modest wage. Service was normally an apprentice system with room for advancement through the ranks.

The conditions faced by domestic workers have varied considerably throughout history and in the contemporary world. In the course of twentieth-century movements for labour rights, women&#x27;s rights and immigrant rights, the conditions faced by domestic workers and the problems specific to their class of employment have come to the fore.

In 2011, the International Labour Organization adopted the Convention Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers. Previously, at its 301st Session (March 2008), the International Labour Organization (ILO) Governing Body agreed to place an item on decent work for domestic workers on the agenda of the 99th Session of the International Labour Conference (2010) with a view to the setting of labour standards. In July 2011, at the annual International Labour Conference, held by the ILO, conference delegates adopted the Convention on Domestic Workers by a vote of 396 to 16, with 63 abstentions. The Convention recognized domestic workers as workers with the same rights as other workers. On 26 April 2012, Uruguay was the first country to ratify the convention.

==Accommodation==
Many domestic workers are live-in domestics. Though they often have their own quarters, their accommodations are not usually as comfortable as those reserved for the family members. In some cases, they sleep in the kitchen or small rooms, such as a box room, sometimes located in the basement or attic. Domestic workers may live in their own home, though more often they are &quot;live-in&quot; domestics, meaning that they receive their room and board as part of their salaries. In some countries, because of the large gap between urban and rural incomes, and the lack of employment opportunities in the countryside, even an ordinary middle class urban family can afford to employ a full-time live-in servant. The majority of domestic workers in China, Mexico, India, and other populous developing countries, are people from the rural areas who are employed by urban families.

Employers may require their domestic workers to wear a uniform, livery or other &quot;domestic workers&#x27; clothes&quot; when in their employers&#x27; residence. The uniform is usually simple, though aristocratic employers sometimes provided elaborate decorative liveries, especially for use on formal occasions. Female servants wore long, plain, dark-coloured dresses or black skirts with white belts and white blouses, and black shoes, and male servants and butlers would wear something from a simple suit, or a white dress shirt, often with tie, and knickers. In traditional portrayals, the attire of domestic workers especially was typically more formal and conservative than that of those whom they serve. For example, in films of the early 20th century, a butler might appear in a tailcoat, while male family members and guests appeared in lounge suits or sports jackets and trousers depending on the occasion. In later portrayals, the employer and guests might wear casual slacks or even jeans, while a male domestic worker wore a jacket and tie or a white dress shirt with black trousers, necktie or bowtie, maybe even a waistcoat, or a female domestic worker either a blouse and skirt (or trousers) or a uniform.

On 30 March 2009, Peru adopted a law banning employers from requiring domestic workers to wear a uniform at public places. However, it has not explained which punishments will be given to employers violating the law. Chile adopted a similar law in 2014, also banning employers to require domestic workers to wear uniform at public places.

==Child workers==

More girls under 16 work as domestic workers than any other category of child labor. Usually, in a practice often called &quot;confiage&quot; or entrusting, such as for restaveks in Haiti, parents in the rural poverty make an agreement with someone in the cities who would house and send their child to school in return for domestic work.

Such children are very vulnerable to exploitation: often they are not allowed to take breaks or are required to work long hours; many suffer from a lack of access to education, which can contribute to social isolation and a lack of future opportunity. UNICEF considers domestic work to be among the lowest status, and reports that most child domestic workers are live-in workers and are under the round-the-clock control of their employers. Child domestic work is common in countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan. In Pakistan, since January 2010 to December 2013, 52 cases of tortures on child domestic workers are reported including 24 deaths. It has been estimated that globally, at least 10 million children work in domestic labor jobs.

Children face a number of risks that are common in domestic work service. The International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour identified that these risks include: long and tiring working days; use of toxic chemicals; carrying heavy loads; handling dangerous items such as knives, axes and hot pans; insufficient or inadequate food and accommodation, and humiliating or degrading treatment including physical and verbal violence, and sexual abuse.

==Migrant domestic workers==

Migrant domestic workers are, according to the International Labour Organization&#x27;s Convention No. 189 and the International Organization for Migration, any persons “moving to another country or region to better their material or social conditions and improve the prospect for themselves or their family,” engaged in a work relationship performing “in or for a household or households.” Domestic work itself can cover a &quot;wide range of tasks and services that vary from country to country and that can be different depending on the age, gender, ethnic background and migration status of the workers concerned.&quot; These particular workers have been identified by some academics as situated within &quot;the rapid growth of paid domestic labor, the feminization of transnational migration, and the development of new public spheres.”

==Social effects==

As women currently dominate the domestic labor market throughout the world, they have learned to navigate the system of domestic work both in their own countries and abroad in order to maximize the benefits of entering the domestic labor market.

Among the disadvantages of working as a domestic worker is the fact that women working in this sector are working in an area often regarded as a private sphere. Feminist critics of women working in the domestic sphere argue that this woman-dominated market is reinforcing gender inequalities by potentially creating mistress-servant relationships between domestic workers and their employers and continuing to put women in a position of lesser power. Other critics point out that working in a privatized sphere robs domestic workers of the advantages of more socialized work in the public sphere.

Additionally, domestic laborers face other disadvantages. Their isolation is increased by their invisibility in the public sphere and the repetitive, intangible nature of their work decreases its value, making the workers themselves more dispensable. The level of isolation women face also depends on the type of domestic work they are involved with. Live-in nannies for example may sacrifice much of their own independence and sometimes become increasingly isolated when they live with a family of which they are not part and away from their own.

While working in a dominantly female privatized world can prove disadvantageous for domestic workers, many women have learned how to help one another move upward economically. Women find that informal networks of friends and families are among the most successful and commonly used means of finding and securing jobs.

Without the security of legal protection, many women who work without the requisite identity or citizenship papers are vulnerable to abuse. Some have to perform tasks considered degrading showing a manifestation of employer power over worker powerlessness. Employing domestic work from foreign countries can perpetuate the idea that domestic or service work is reserved for other social or racial groups and plays into the stereotype that it is work for inferior groups of people.

Gaining employment in the domestic labor market can prove to be difficult for immigrant women. Many subcontract their services to more established women workers, creating an important apprenticeship type of learning experience that can produce better, more independent opportunities in the future. Women who work as domestic workers also gain some employment mobility. Once established they have the option of accepting jobs from multiple employers increasing their income and their experience and most importantly their ability to negotiate prices with their employers.

===England===
In 19th- and early 20th-century England the close supervision exercised by mistresses over their servants (including the rule &quot;no followers&quot;, &quot;followers&quot; being any men whom the servant might wish to meet when she was not working) was a great disadvantage. This policy was justified by the low esteem in which servants were held; therefore men they associated with were likely to include some with criminal tendencies. The servant and writer Margaret Powell expressed the view that &quot;follower&quot; was a degrading term; the only way the two could meet was by the servant getting out to the road with an excuse such as needing to post a letter.

==Situation by country==
===Canada===

Domestic helpers in Canada, mainly from the Philippines, work in Canada, including under the
Live-In Caregiver program.

===France===
In his &quot;Tableau de Paris&quot;, Louis-Sébastien Mercier describes the characteristics of the manservants (lackeys) of pre-revolutionary Paris. &quot;An army of useless servants is kept entirely for show&quot;; he observes that the presence of these servants in the capital has left the countryside rather empty. A tax-farmer&#x27;s household consists of 24 servants in livery, besides scullions, kitchen maids and six lady&#x27;s maids. Some lackeys would adopt the manners of their masters and affect a similar mode of dress.

===Hong Kong===

Domestic helpers (DHs, foreign domestic workers, FDWs) from certain other countries, especially the Philippines and Indonesia, work in Hong Kong on specific visas that exempt employers from many obligations received by other workers, and receive a lower minimum salary. Approximately five percent of Hong Kong&#x27;s population are FDWs, about 98.5% of them are women, performing household tasks such as cooking, serving, cleaning, dishwashing and child care.

During the COVID-19 epidemic, all foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong have to be vaccinated before their contracts can be renewed, the government announced as it ordered them to undergo mandatory COVID-19 testing on 9 May 2021.

=== Vietnam ===
On December 14, the Government of Viet Nam issued Decree No. 145/2020 / ND-CP about the Labor Code regarding working conditions and labor relations. Including detailed provisions and guidance for the implementation of Clause 2, Article 161 of the Labor Code regarding domestic worker labor. This Decree details and guides the implementation of a number of contents on labor conditions and labor relations in accordance with the following articles and clauses of the Labor Code:
Labor management; Labor contract; Labor outsourcing; Organize dialogue and implement grassroots democracy at work; Salary; Working time, rest time; Labor discipline, material responsibility; Insurance for the domestic worker; Female labor and gender equality; Labor is the housekeeper; Settlement of labor disputes.

===Kenya===

In Kenya, domestic workers – nearly all female – are known as &#x27;housegirls&#x27;. Often from poor villages in neighbouring Uganda, girls are open to exploitation, and there are calls for stronger legal protection.

===Philippines===

In the Philippines, domestic household workers/helpers such as maidservants (&quot;katulong&quot;/&quot;kasambahay&quot;), caretakers (&quot;yaya&quot;), family drivers (&quot;drayber&quot;/&quot;tsuper&quot;), laundrywomen (&quot;labandera&quot;/&quot;tagalaba&quot;), gardeners (&quot;hardinero&quot;), security guards (&quot;guwardiya&quot;/&quot;bantay&quot;), pool cleaners have been a norm in upper class Philippine society for an uncertain amount of time already, perhaps even connected to or influenced from the household slaves/servants in precolonial times of the Philippines that were divided into aliping namamahay and aliping saguiguilid, as indentured household servants. In modern times, it has been a norm among upper and upper-middle-class families in the Philippines to hire at least one maidservant-caretaker (&quot;katulong&quot;/&quot;kasambahay/yaya&quot;) to care for the household and children. Most, particularly maidservant-caretakers (&quot;katulong&quot;/&quot;kasambahay/yaya&quot;), live together in the house of their master&#x27;s family with usually only a day off per month. This practice has eventually influenced the architecture of some houses or apartment condos where it has become a norm to section a room where domestic maidservants sleep as their personal room, usually near the kitchen or laundry area. Some wealthy families also section off an area or house where all the maidservants sleep or a part of the kitchen where they eat separate from the master&#x27;s table. There are also employment agencies and special government laws regarding the regulation of domestic worker employment, such as the &quot;Domestic Workers Act&quot; or &quot;Batas Kasambahay&quot; in Republic Act No 10361 . Many live underpaid since many are informally hired or salaries are not declared truthfully to government offices or have an agreement instead to pay through other means, such as paying for their education, pension, or to send money back to their families. This practice was eventually exported to neighboring countries and all other countries that overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) have worked in, such as the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, Saudi Arabia, and other countries in the Middle East, etc., hence some maidservants continue living with the same mindset of how domestic worker culture was practiced in the Philippines. This has also, at times, been used as a cause to look down upon overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in the countries where they can be found. It has sometimes created controversies in other countries such as abuse charges in several countries in the Middle East or like the case of Flor Contemplacion, who was executed in Singapore for murder allegations. There have also been documentaries or rom-com movies made in the Philippines about the plight or life of domestic workers, particularly maidservant-caretakers (&quot;katulong&quot;/&quot;kasambahay&quot;/&quot;yaya&quot;).

The Central Luzon Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board approved Wage Order RBH-DW-O4 on March 4, 2024, &quot;increasing the monthly wage rate of kasambahay by P1,000 in chartered cities and first class municipalities, and P1,500 in other municipalities, effectively bring the monthly minimum wage in the region to P6,000.&quot; The National Wages and Productivity Commission affirmed the Order on March 12, 2024, and will take effect on April 1, 2024.

===Singapore===
Data from Singapore&#x27;s Ministry of Manpower (MOM), showed that in June 2019 there were some 255,800 Foreign Domestic Workers (FDW) in Singapore. The demand for Foreign Domestic Workers came about from the desire of the Singapore government to employ local women in the workforce. Starting with the Foreign Maid Scheme in 1978, Malaysia (with whom there were special immigration arrangements), Bangladesh, Burma, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand were recruiting grounds for domestic workers. Nearly 20% of Singapore household has a domestic worker which has been attributed to rising wealth, parents who both work as well as the ageing population. As of 2019, MOM require that employers of FDWs must purchase them medical insurance with a minimum coverage of S$15,000 per year.

===Saudi Arabia===
According to a 2008 report by Human Rights Watch (HRW), the Saudi Ministry of Labor provided official figures of 1.2 million household workers in Saudi Arabia including domestic workers, drivers, and gardeners. The report stated that the Gulf country employed nearly 1.5 million women domestic workers from Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Philippines. Domestic workers estimated approximately 600,000 from Indonesia, 275,000 from Sri Lanka and 200,000 from Philippines. However, HRW reported that a number of domestic workers in Saudi Arabia face a range of abuses. Besides, the organization also interviewed Saudi labor and social affairs official, who acknowledged the issue of domestic worker abuse. The report stated that no accurate figure exists to highlight the total violations of labor rights and other human rights that women migrant domestic workers confront in the Arab nation.

=== South Africa ===
The domestic work sector occupies around 6 per cent of the total work force in South Africa, with domestic workers being largely Black African women. As in other countries, working conditions in the sector are generally characterised by informality and exploitation. In 2013, South Africa ratified ILO C189 Convention on Domestic Workers, recognising domestic work as work and formalising it through labour contracts, wages, social protection, health and safety in the workplace, and rights to organising as well as social dialogue. However, significant challenges remain with implementation. Furthermore, the minimum wage of domestic workers is set to 75 per cent of the national minimum wage.

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom English country houses and great houses employed many live-in domestic workers with distinctive roles and chain of command. The lord of the manor would hire a butler to oversee the servants. Manorialism dates back to the Middle Ages and slowly died out. The British historical drama television series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; portrayed these roles. The wealthy in the city would also have domestic workers, but fewer and with less distinctive roles. Domestic workers were mostly considered part of the lower class and some middle class.

In modern times, migrant domestic workers have been brought in to the UK to fill the demand for low-cost workers. Human rights groups have added that they are often subject to abuse.

===India===
Domestic Workers in India are susceptible to an unsafe working environment. These workers put their lives at stake to work in the household in metropolitan cities of the country. Residents of high-rise buildings can be as cruel to the workers in terms of leaving them without food and water and keeping them captive. Most of the time, such captive workers are as young as a 14-year-old girl. Many such girls come from tribal lands in India such as Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and some parts of West Bengal, Odisha and Assam due to fewer or no work opportunities available locally. Even though Domestic work is the fastest-growing sector of women and girls’ employment in urban India, the country lacks a separate law for domestic workers&#x27; safety and social security. NGOs in India, focused on the rights of domestic workers, have been reiterating the demand for the issuance of identity cards on the lines of construction workers, weekly leave, ESI and PF facilities and social security. On the legal front, these workers have a long battle to go. In 2024, The Supreme Court of India disposed off one of the petitions filed by the Common Cause, an NGO that works in the probity of public life, giving the liberty of filing a fresh petition on the matter incorporating all the developments since the petition was filed.

===United States===
==== Black Americans post-Civil War to World War I ====
In the United States, slavery legally ended in 1865, however, the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau informed the former slaves now classified as freedmen and women that they could either sign labor contracts with white planters or be evicted from the land that they had lived on. Most freedmen in the South signed labor contracts with their former white slave owners because that was the only work experience they had. With limited skills and illiteracy, many men turned to become sharecroppers, whereas the majority of women participated in domestic work. Not only were they not qualified for other jobs, but they were denied other jobs and segregated from American society purely based on the color of their skin. The South wanted to keep segregation alive and hence passed legislation such as the Jim Crow Laws post-Civil war which denied African Americans of legal equality and political rights. These laws kept many African Americans as a second-class status up until new laws ended segregation in the 1960s.

Up until the mid-twentieth century, domestic work was a prominent source of income for many women of different ethnic backgrounds. Many of these women were either African American or immigrants. More specifically, the post-civil war South had a high concentration of African Americans working as domestic workers. At the turn of the nineteenth century, there was also a high concentration of African Americans working as domestic workers in the North. Many African American women migrated to the North for better work opportunities and higher wages compared to their employment options in the South. The African American women who worked as domestic workers were generally treated as poor, childlike beings that were seen as victims of their own ignorance of living in communities of crime and other societal infringements. However, despite the stereotypes labeled upon domestic workers, these women still settled for these positions because the only occupations that were open to African American women before World War I were domestic services. It was necessary they worked along with their husbands in order to keep their families financially supported.

Frequently underpaid, African American servants commonly took food scraps and discarded clothing from their employers in a practice known as “pan toting” or the “service pan”. The service pan augmented wages in almost two-thirds of the employers&#x27; households in Athens, Georgia, in 1913. The pan system was used by employers to justify paying a lower wage, and used by domestic workers to counter their employers&#x27; dishonesty. Whites also pointed to the practice of pan toting as proof that “a Negro could not help but steal”, thereby reinforcing stereotypes of “black inferiority and dependency” and rationalizing racist paternalism.

==== Black Americans in the Great Depression ====
Due to the Great Depression, many domestic workers lost their jobs. This is because many white families lost their source of income and were not able to pay domestic workers to work in their home. At this time, many domestic workers relied on asking strangers on the street for housework such as cleaning. They house jumped, looking for any job that they could get. The domestic workforce was significantly impacted by the Great Depression which caused a decrease in their wages and an intolerable 18 hour workday. Also, agricultural workers and the African American women working as domestic workers at this time were explicitly excluded from Social Security and the Fair Labor Standards Act in the New Deal legislation; domestic workers of all races were excluded from Social Security until 1950. (Household employees working at least two days a week for the same person were added to Social Security coverage in 1950, along with nonprofit workers and the self-employed. Hotel workers, laundry workers, all agricultural workers, and state and local government employees were added in 1954.) This is because the New Dealer politicians were more worried about losing support from the Southern Democrats in Congress who supported segregation rather than refusing coverage for many African Americans. Unlike their white counterparts, African Americans did not form labor unions because they lacked the resources, consciousness, and the access to networks used for union recruiting. On top of that, the domestic workers would not typically have earned enough money to be able to afford being a part of a union. Even if the African American domestic workers wanted to advance in society, it was nearly impossible because the racial structures in the United States rarely allowed them class mobility. However, domestic workers that were white such as the Irish and the Germans utilized working in middle-class homes to their advantage. Working in the middle-class homes served to Americanize, allowing the workers to identify more with their employers than women of their own class and instilled an aspiration to become middle-class status.

==== Black Americans in 1960s United States ====
Nearly ninety percent of African American women worked as domestic workers during the Civil Rights Movement era. Their participation in the Civil Rights Movement went fairly undocumented. Despite their low-status career in the United States, they were beneficial for the betterment of society and the status of the African American race. It has been noted that the southern African American women were the backbone of the Civil Rights Movement.

Since many white households relied on the African American domestic workers for housework, the workers were able to have a direct impact on the white race when rebelling for their civil rights. The African American domestic workers boycotted buses and tried to register to vote, and many were denied and imprisoned. However, the domestic workers utilized imprisonment to educate other African American women on the Civil Rights Movement and what to do to contribute. Additionally, the domestic workers frequently rebelled in an informal manner, such as resisting to live in the same home in which they worked. By doing this, the African American domestic workers transformed the domestic services, and collective organizations came about promoting a better work environment for African American domestic workers. Their act of rebellion gave way for a change of how they were treated, how they were paid, and how they were respected.

He attended Amherst College, graduating in 1955 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. The following year, he received his master&#x27;s degree from Yale University. On June 17, 1956, he married Marilyn (Lynne) Duchovnay, a teacher, and they adopted two children. In 1959, Fagles received his Ph.D in English from Yale and for the next year taught English there.

From 1960 to 1962, Fagles was an English instructor at Princeton University. In 1962 he was promoted to assistant professor, and in 1965 became an associate professor of English and comparative literature. Later that year he became director of the comparative literature program. In 1970, he became a full professor, and from 1975 was the department chair. He retired from teaching as the Arthur W. Marks &#x27;19 Professor of Comparative Literature in 2002, and remained a professor emeritus at Princeton.

Between 1961 and 1996, Fagles translated many ancient Greek works. His first translation was of the poetry of Bacchylides, publishing a complete set in 1961. In the 1970s, Fagles began translating much Greek drama, beginning with Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;The Oresteia&quot;. He went on to publish translations of Sophocles&#x27;s three Theban plays (1982), Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; (1990) and &quot;Odyssey&quot; (1996), and Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; (2006). In these last four, Bernard Knox authored the introduction and notes. Fagles&#x27;s translations generally emphasize contemporary English phrasing and idiom but are faithful to the original as much as possible.

In 1978, Fagles published &quot;I, Vincent: Poems from the Pictures of Van Gogh&quot;. He was the co-editor of &quot;Homer: A Collection of Critical Essays&quot; (1962) and &quot;Pope&#x27;s Iliad and Odyssey&quot; (1967).

Fagles died at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, on March 26, 2008, from prostate cancer.

==Awards==
Fagles was nominated for the National Book Award in Translation and won the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award of the Academy of American Poets in 1991 for his translation of the &quot;Iliad&quot;. In 1996, he received an Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters for his translation of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. In 1997 he received the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for lifetime achievement in translation. Fagles later undertook a new English translation of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, which was published in November 2006.

In addition to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Fagles was also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

He received a National Humanities Medal by the National Endowment for the Humanities.

On June 8, 2011, a resource center devoted to the study of the Classics was dedicated to Dr. Fagles at Princeton High School. At the dedication, students and teachers paid tribute to Dr. Fagles.

<doc id="636792" wikidata="Q1417709" url="?curid=636792" title="Football in Japan">
<text>Football is among the most popular sports in Japan, together with baseball, tennis, golf, sumo, and combat sports. Its nationwide organization, the Japan Football Association, administers the professional football leagues, including J.League, which is considered by many the most successful football league in Asia. Japan is also the country with the most comprehensively developed football in Asia in both men and women as well as in both futsal and beach soccer.

==Football==

Although the official English name of the Japan Football Association uses the term &quot;football&quot;, the term , derived from &quot;soccer&quot;, is much more commonly used than . The JFA&#x27;s Japanese name is &quot;Nippon Sakkā Kyōkai&quot;.

Before World War II the term in general use was , a Sino-Japanese term. With previously exclusive Japanese terms replaced by American influence after the war, &quot;sakkā&quot; became more commonplace. In recent years, many professional teams have named themselves F.C.s (football clubs), with examples being FC Tokyo and Kyoto Sanga FC.

==History==
The introduction of football in Japan is officially credited by the Japan Football Association, and numerous academic papers and books on the history of association football in Japan, to then Lieutenant-Commander Archibald Lucius Douglas of the Royal Navy and his subordinates, who from 1873 taught the game and its rules to Japanese navy cadets while acting as instructors at the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy in Tsukiji, Tokyo.

The first official football match in Japan is widely believed to have been held on February 18, 1888, between the Yokohama Country &amp; Athletic Club and Kobe Regatta &amp; Athletic Club. YC&amp;AC is the oldest running association football club in Japan as Association Football was introduced into the club on December 25, 1886, for training sessions starting from January 1887.
The first Japanese association football club, founded as a football club, is considered to be Tokyo Shukyu-dan, founded in 1917, which is now competing in the Tokyo Prefectural amateur league.

In the 1920s, football associations were organised and regional tournaments began in universities and high schools especially in Tokyo. In 1930, the Japan national association football team was organised and had a 3–3 tie with China for their first title at the Far Eastern Championship Games. The Japan national team also participated in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, the team had the first victory in an Olympic game with a 3–2 win over powerful Sweden.

Aside from the national cup, the Emperor&#x27;s Cup established in 1921, there had been several attempts at creating a senior-level national championship. The first was the All Japan Works Football Championship (AJWFC), established in 1948 and open only to company teams. The second was the All Japan Inter-City Football Championship (AJICFC), established in 1955 and separating clubs by cities (any club, works, university or autonomous, could represent their home city and qualify) but the Emperor&#x27;s Cup remained dominated by universities until the late 1950s. All these tournaments were cups following single-elimination formulas, similar to Serie A in Italy before 1929.

The first organized national league, the Japan Soccer League, was organized in 1965 with eight amateur company clubs and replaced the AJWFC and AJICFC. At the 1968 Mexico Olympic Games, the Japan national team, filled with the top JSL stars of the era, had its first big success winning third place and a bronze medal. Olympic success spurred the creation of a Second Division for the JSL and openings for the first few professional players, in the beginning, foreigners (mainly Brazilians), and a few from other countries, which also led to the country hosting its first international competition, the 1979 FIFA World Youth Championship. Japanese players, however, remained an amateur, having to work day jobs for the companies owning the clubs (or other companies if their clubs were autonomous). This limited the growth of the Japanese game, and many better Japanese players had to move abroad to make a living off the game, such as Yasuhiko Okudera, the first Japanese player to play in a professional European club, (1. FC Köln of Germany). UEFA and CONMEBOL aided the Japanese awareness of football by having the Intercontinental Cup played in Tokyo as a neutral venue.
In 1993, the Japan Professional Football League (commonly known as the &quot;J.League&quot;) was formed replacing the semi-professional Japan Soccer League as the new top-level club competition in Japan. It consisted of some of the top clubs from the old JSL, fully professionalized, renamed to fit communities and with the corporate identity reduced to a minimum. The new higher-standard league attracted many more spectators and helped the sport to hugely increase in popularity. The professionalized league also offered, and offers, incentives for amateur non-company clubs to become part of their ranks with no major backing from a company; major examples of community, non-company-affiliated clubs who rose through the prefectural and regional ranks into the major leagues are Albirex Niigata and Oita Trinita.

Japan participated in its first-ever World Cup tournament at the 1998 FIFA World Cup held in France. In 2002, Japan co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with Republic of Korea. After this, the association football communities of both countries received the FIFA Fair Play Award. The Japanese national team has reached the round of 16 on four occasions – as hosts in 2002, where they were knocked out by Turkey 1–0, in 2010, where they lost to Paraguay in penalties, in 2018 where they fell 2–3 to Belgium, and in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Japan also qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa and the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.

==Football in fiction==

The first worldwide popular association football-oriented Japanese animation (manga) series, &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot;, was started in 1981. &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; was extremely popular among children of both genders in Japan. Its success led to much more association football manga being written, and it played a great role in association football history in Japan. Playing football became more popular than playing baseball in many schools throughout Japan from the 1980s due to the series.

&quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; has also inspired the likes of prominent footballers such as Hidetoshi Nakata, Seigo Narazaki, Zinedine Zidane, Francesco Totti, Fernando Torres, Christian Vieri, Giuseppe Sculli, James Rodríguez, Alexis Sánchez and Alessandro Del Piero to play association football and choose it as a career. The inspiration for the character of Tsubasa Oozora came from a number of players, including most prominently Musashi Mizushima, arguably the first Japanese footballer to play abroad, and whose move to São Paulo FC as a ten-year-old boy was partly mimicked in the manga.

The anime &quot;Giant Killing&quot; revolves around a team&#x27;s efforts to go from one of the worst professional teams in Japan to the best. Other works focusing on football include &quot;Hungry Heart: Wild Striker&quot; (from the same author of &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot;), &quot;The Knight in the Area&quot;, &quot;Days&quot;, &quot;Inazuma Eleven&quot; and &quot;Blue Lock&quot;.

==Women&#x27;s football==

As in European countries, Japanese women&#x27;s football is organized on a promotion and relegation basis. The top flight of women&#x27;s association football is the semi-professional L. League (currently billed as the &quot;Nadeshiko League&quot;). Most clubs are independent clubs, although the recent trend is to have women&#x27;s sections of established J.League clubs.

The national team has enjoyed major success at the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, having achieved its greatest triumph ever by winning the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup in Germany and finishing as runner-up in 2015 in Canada.

<text>The small-world experiment comprised several experiments conducted by Stanley Milgram and other researchers examining the average path length for social networks of people in the United States. The research was groundbreaking in that it suggested that human society is a small-world-type network characterized by short path-lengths. The experiments are often associated with the phrase &quot;six degrees of separation&quot;, although Milgram did not use this term himself.

==Historical context of the small-world problem==

Guglielmo Marconi&#x27;s conjectures based on his radio work in the early 20th century, which were articulated in his 1909 Nobel Prize address, may have inspired Hungarian author Frigyes Karinthy to write a challenge to find another person to whom he could not be connected through at most five people. This is perhaps the earliest reference to the concept of six degrees of separation, and the search for an answer to the small world problem.

Mathematician Manfred Kochen and political scientist Ithiel de Sola Pool wrote a mathematical manuscript, &quot;Contacts and Influences&quot;, while working at the University of Paris in the early 1950s, during a time when Milgram visited and collaborated in their research. Their unpublished manuscript circulated among academics for over 20 years before publication in 1978. It formally articulated the mechanics of social networks, and explored the mathematical consequences of these (including the degree of connectedness). The manuscript left many significant questions about networks unresolved, and one of these was the number of degrees of separation in actual social networks.

Milgram took up the challenge on his return from Paris, leading to the experiments reported in &quot;The Small World Problem&quot; in the May 1967 (charter) issue of the popular magazine &quot;Psychology Today&quot;, with a more rigorous version of the paper appearing in &quot;Sociometry&quot; two years later. The &quot;Psychology Today&quot; article generated enormous publicity for the experiments, which are well known today, long after much of the formative work has been forgotten.

Milgram&#x27;s experiment was conceived in an era when a number of independent threads were converging on the idea that the world is becoming increasingly interconnected. Michael Gurevich had conducted seminal work in his empirical study of the structure of social networks in his MIT doctoral dissertation under Pool. Mathematician Manfred Kochen, an Austrian who had been involved in statist urban design, extrapolated these empirical results in a mathematical manuscript, &quot;Contacts and Influences&quot;, concluding that, in an American-sized population without social structure, &quot;it is practically certain that any two individuals can contact one another by means of at least two intermediaries. In a [socially] structured population it is less likely but still seems probable. And perhaps for the whole world&#x27;s population, probably only one more bridging individual should be needed.&quot; They subsequently constructed Monte Carlo simulations based on Gurevich&#x27;s data, which recognized that both weak and strong acquaintance links are needed to model social structure. The simulations, running on the slower computers of 1973, were limited, but still were able to predict that a more realistic three degrees of separation existed across the U.S. population, a value that foreshadowed the findings of Milgram.

Milgram revisited Gurevich&#x27;s experiments in acquaintanceship networks when he conducted a highly publicized set of experiments beginning in 1967 at Harvard University. One of Milgram&#x27;s most famous works is a study of obedience and authority, which is widely known as the Milgram Experiment. Milgram&#x27;s earlier association with Pool and Kochen was the likely source of his interest in the increasing interconnectedness among human beings. Gurevich&#x27;s interviews served as a basis for his small world experiments.

Milgram sought to develop an experiment that could answer the small world problem. This was the same phenomenon articulated by the writer Frigyes Karinthy in the 1920s while documenting a widely circulated belief in Budapest that individuals were separated by six degrees of social contact. This observation, in turn, was loosely based on the seminal demographic work of the Statists who were so influential in the design of Eastern European cities during that period. Mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, born in Poland and having traveled extensively in Eastern Europe, was aware of the Statist rules of thumb, and was also a colleague of Pool, Kochen and Milgram at the University of Paris during the early 1950s (Kochen brought Mandelbrot to work at the Institute for Advanced Study and later IBM in the U.S.). This circle of researchers was fascinated by the interconnectedness and &quot;social capital&quot; of social networks.

Milgram&#x27;s study results showed that people in the United States seemed to be connected by approximately three friendship links, on average, without speculating on global linkages; he never actually used the phrase &quot;six degrees of separation&quot;. Since the &quot;Psychology Today&quot; article gave the experiments wide publicity, Milgram, Kochen, and Karinthy all had been incorrectly attributed as the origin of the notion of &quot;six degrees&quot;; the most likely popularizer of the phrase &quot;six degrees of separation&quot; is John Guare, who attributed the value &quot;six&quot; to Marconi.

==The experiment==

Milgram&#x27;s experiment developed out of a desire to learn more about the probability that two randomly selected people would know each other. This is one way of looking at the small world problem. An alternative view of the problem is to imagine the population as a social network and attempt to find the average path length between any two nodes. Milgram&#x27;s experiment was designed to measure these path lengths by developing a procedure to count the number of ties between any two people.

===Basic procedure===

# Though the experiment went through several variations, Milgram typically chose individuals in the U.S. cities of Omaha, Nebraska, and Wichita, Kansas, to be the starting points and Boston, Massachusetts, to be the end point of a chain of correspondence. These cities were selected because they were thought to represent a great distance in the United States, both socially and geographically.
# Information packets were initially sent to &quot;randomly&quot; selected individuals in Omaha or Wichita. They included letters, which detailed the study&#x27;s purpose, and basic information about a target contact person in Boston. It additionally contained a roster on which they could write their own name, as well as business reply cards that were pre-addressed to Harvard.
# Upon receiving the invitation to participate, the recipient was asked whether he or she personally knew the contact person described in the letter. If so, the person was to forward the letter directly to that person. For the purposes of this study, knowing someone &quot;personally&quot; was defined as knowing them on a first-name basis.
# In the more likely case that the person did not personally know the target, then the person was to think of a friend or relative who was more likely to know the target. They were then directed to sign their name on the roster and forward the packet to that person. A postcard was also mailed to the researchers at Harvard so that they could track the chain&#x27;s progression toward the target.
# When and if the package eventually reached the contact person in Boston, the researchers could examine the roster to count the number of times it had been forwarded from person to person. Additionally, for packages that never reached the destination, the incoming postcards helped identify the break point in the chain.

===Results===

Shortly after the experiments began, letters would begin arriving to the targets and the researchers would receive postcards from the respondents. Sometimes the packet would arrive to the target in as few as one or two hops, while some chains were composed of as many as nine or ten links. However, a significant problem was that often people refused to pass the letter forward, and thus the chain never reached its destination. In one case, 232 of the 296 letters never reached the destination.

However, 64 of the letters eventually did reach the target contact. Among these chains, the average path length fell around five and a half or six. Hence, the researchers concluded that people in the United States are separated by about six people on average. Although Milgram himself never used the phrase &quot;six degrees of separation&quot;, these findings are likely to have contributed to its widespread acceptance.

In an experiment in which 160 letters were mailed out, 24 reached the target in his home in Sharon, Massachusetts. Of those 24 letters, 16 were given to the target by the same person, a clothing merchant Milgram called &quot;Mr. Jacobs&quot;. Of those that reached the target at his office, more than half came from two other men.

The researchers used the postcards to qualitatively examine the types of chains that are created. Generally, the package quickly reached a close geographic proximity, but would circle the target almost randomly until it found the target&#x27;s inner circle of friends. This suggests that participants strongly favored geographic characteristics when choosing an appropriate next person in the chain.

===Criticisms===
There are a number of methodological criticisms of the small-world experiment, which suggest that the average path length might actually be smaller or larger than Milgram expected. Four such criticisms are summarized here:

# Judith Kleinfeld argues that Milgram&#x27;s study suffers from selection and non-response bias due to the way participants were recruited and high non-completion rates. First, the &quot;starters&quot; were not chosen at random, as they were recruited through an advertisement that specifically sought people who considered themselves well-connected. Another problem has to do with the attrition rate. If one assumes a constant portion of non-response for each person in the chain, longer chains will be under-represented because it is more likely that they will encounter an unwilling participant. Hence, Milgram&#x27;s experiment should underestimate the true average path length. Several methods have been suggested to correct these estimates; one uses a variant of survival analysis in order to account for the length information of interrupted chains, and thus reduce the bias in the estimation of average degrees of separation.
# One of the key features of Milgram&#x27;s methodology is that participants are asked to choose the person they know who is most likely to know the target individual. But in many cases, the participant may be unsure which of their friends is the most likely to know the target. Thus, since the participants of the Milgram experiment do not have a topological map of the social network, they might actually be sending the package further away from the target rather than sending it along the shortest path. This is very likely to increase route length, overestimating the average number of ties needed to connect two random people. An omniscient path-planner, having access to the complete social graph of the country, would be able to choose a shortest path that is, in general, shorter than the path produced by a greedy algorithm that makes local decisions only.
# A description of heterogeneous social networks still remains an open question. Though much research was not done for a number of years, in 1998 Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz published a breakthrough paper in the journal &quot;Nature.&quot; Mark Buchanan said, &quot;Their paper touched off a storm of further work across many fields of science&quot; (&quot;Nexus&quot;, p60, 2002). See Watts&#x27; book on the topic: &quot;Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age&quot;.
# Some communities, such as the Sentinelese, are completely isolated, disrupting the otherwise global chains. Once these people are discovered, they remain more &quot;distant&quot; from the vast majority of the world, as they have few economic, familial, or social contacts with the world at large; before they are discovered, they are not within any degree of separation from the rest of the population. However, these populations are invariably tiny, rendering them of low statistical relevance.

In addition to these methodological criticisms, conceptual issues are debated. One regards the social relevance of indirect contact chains of different degrees of separation. Much formal and empirical work focuses on diffusion processes, but the literature on the small-world problem also often illustrates the relevance of the research using an example (similar to Milgram&#x27;s experiment) of a targeted search in which a starting person tries to obtain some kind of resource (e.g., information) from a target person, using a number of intermediaries to reach that target person. However, there is little empirical research showing that indirect channels with a length of about six degrees of separation are actually used for such directed search, or that such search processes are more efficient compared to other means (e.g., finding information in a directory).

==Influence==

===The social sciences===
&quot;The Tipping Point&quot; by Malcolm Gladwell, based on articles originally published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, elaborates on the &quot;funneling&quot; concept. Gladwell condenses sociological research, which argues that the six-degrees phenomenon is dependent on a few extraordinary people (&quot;connectors&quot;) with large networks of contacts and friends: these hubs then mediate the connections between the vast majority of otherwise weakly connected individuals.

Recent work in the effects of the small world phenomenon on disease transmission, however, have indicated that due to the strongly connected nature of social networks as a whole, removing these hubs from a population usually has little effect on the average path length through the graph (Barrett et al., 2005).

===Mathematicians and actors===
Smaller communities, such as mathematicians and actors, have been found to be densely connected by chains of personal or professional associations. Mathematicians have created the Erdős number to describe their distance from Paul Erdős based on shared publications. A similar exercise has been carried out for the actor Kevin Bacon and other actors who appeared in movies together with him — the latter effort informing the game &quot;Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon&quot;. There is also the combined Erdős-Bacon number, for actor-mathematicians and mathematician-actors. Players of the popular Asian game Go describe their distance from the great player Honinbo Shusaku by counting their Shusaku number, which counts degrees of separation through the games the players have had.

==Current research on the small-world problem==
The small-world question is still a popular research topic today, with many experiments still being conducted. For instance, Peter Dodds, Roby Muhamad, and Duncan Watts conducted the first large-scale replication of Milgram&#x27;s experiment, involving 24,163 e-mail chains and 18 targets around the world.

Dodds &quot;et al&quot;. also found that the mean chain length was roughly six, even after accounting for attrition. A similar experiment using popular social networking sites as a medium was carried out at Carnegie Mellon University. Results showed that very few messages actually reached their destination. However, the critiques that apply to Milgram&#x27;s experiment largely apply also to this current research.

===Network models===

In 1998, Duncan J. Watts and Steven Strogatz from Cornell University published the first network model on the small-world phenomenon. They showed that networks from both the natural and man-made world, such as power grids and the neural network of &quot;C. elegans&quot;, exhibit the small-world phenomenon. Watts and Strogatz showed that, beginning with a regular lattice, the addition of a small number of random links reduces the diameter—the longest direct path between any two vertices in the network—from being very long to being very short. The research was originally inspired by Watts&#x27; efforts to understand the synchronization of cricket chirps, which show a high degree of coordination over long ranges as though the insects are being guided by an invisible conductor. The mathematical model which Watts and Strogatz developed to explain this phenomenon has since been applied in a wide range of different areas. In Watts&#x27; words:

Generally, their model demonstrated the truth in Mark Granovetter&#x27;s observation that it is &quot;the strength of weak ties&quot; that holds together a social network. Although the specific model has since been generalized by Jon Kleinberg, it remains a canonical case study in the field of complex networks. In network theory, the idea presented in the small-world network model has been explored quite extensively. Indeed, several classic results in random graph theory show that even networks with no real topological structure exhibit the small-world phenomenon, which mathematically is expressed as the diameter of the network growing with the logarithm of the number of nodes (rather than proportional to the number of nodes, as in the case for a lattice). This result similarly maps onto networks with a power-law degree distribution, such as scale-free networks.

In computer science, the small-world phenomenon (although it is not typically called that) is used in the development of secure peer-to-peer protocols, novel routing algorithms for the Internet and ad hoc wireless networks, and search algorithms for communication networks of all kinds.

==In popular culture==
Social networks pervade popular culture in the United States and elsewhere. In particular, the notion of six degrees has become part of the collective consciousness. Social networking services such as Facebook, Linkedin, and Instagram have greatly increased the connectivity of the online space through the application of social networking concepts.

<doc id="636802" wikidata="Q1047921" url="?curid=636802" title="Grand Cape Mount County">
<text>Grand Cape Mount is a county in the northwestern portion of the West African nation of Liberia. One of 15 counties that constitute the first-level of administrative division in the nation, it has five districts. Robertsport serves as the capital with the area of the county measuring . As of the 2008 Census, it had a population of 129,817, making it the eighth most populous county in Liberia. The county is bordered by Gbarpolu County to the northeast and Bomi County to the southeast. The northern part of Grand Cape Mount borders the nation of Sierra Leone, while to the west lies the Atlantic Ocean.

The name of the county comes from Cape du Mont, a French word meaning the Cape of the Mount. In 1461, Pedro de Sintra, a Portuguese explorer charting the West Coast of Africa, saw the prominent feature of the cape and chose its name.

==History==

Portuguese explorer Pedro de Sintra discovered the area in 1461.

The 300-foot-tall Cape Mount became the landmark for settlers in the region. Theodore Canot formed the settlement in 1840.

In 1847, Liberia became independent with three counties: Montserrado, Grand Bassa, and Sinoe. A local government was formed after signing a treaty with the locals in 1849, while Robertsport was established in 1856. The area now known as Grand Cape Mount became the territory of Grand Cape Mount under Montserrado County.

In 1856, Cape Mount was carved out of Montserrado by a legislative act and became the fifth County in Liberia. The superintendent is Aaron Vincent.

==Geography==
Grand Cape County accommodates the national protected area of Lake Piso Reserve with an area of and the national plantation of Industrial Trial Pulpwood Plantation, which occupies an area of . The Western part of the county has coastal plains up to a height of above sea-level inward to a distance of . These plains receive very high rainfall ranging from to per year and receive longer sunshine with a humidity of 85 to 95 percent. It is swampy along rivers and creeks, while there are patches of savannah woodland. Rice and cassava interplanted with sugarcane are the major crops grown in the region. The northern or the upper part of the highland has tropical forest which is usually above the mean sea level. The regions receive a bimodal rainfall with a gap of two weeks in between. Cocoa, coffee, rubber, citrus oil, and palm are the most common crops in the region.

==Demographics==
As of 2008, the county had a population of 127,812: 65,679 male and 62,133 female. The sex ratio was 105.7 compared to 89.2 in the 1994 census. The number of households during 2008 was 18,143 and the average size of the households was 5.2. The population was 3.80 percent of the total population, while it was 3.70 percent in 1994. The county had an area of 1,846 sq mi and the density per square mile was 69. The density during the 1984 census stood at 43. Liberia experienced civil war during various times and the total number of people displaced on account of wars as of 2008 in the county was 44,486. The number of people residing in urban areas was 8,145, with 4,022 males and 4,123 females. The total number of people in rural areas was 118,931, with 61,657 males and 57,274 females. The total fraction of people residing in urban areas was 6.37 percent, while the remaining .093 percent were living in rural areas. The number of people resettled as of 2008 was 24,316 while the number of people who were not resettled was 2,897. The number of literates above the age of ten as of 2008 was 53,824 while the number of illiterates was 40,346 making the literacy rate 57.16 percent. The total number of literate males was 31,435 while the total number of literate females was 22,389. An estimated 60 percent of the population speaks the Vai language and 70 percent are Muslim.

Government
The Legislature of Liberia was modeled based on the Legislature of the United States. It is bicameral in nature with a Senate and the House of Representatives. There are 15 counties in the country and based on the population each county is defined to have at least two members, with the total number of members to the house including the Speaker being 64. Each member represents an electoral district and is elected to a six-year term based on popular vote. There were 26 senators, two each for the 13 counties and they serve a nine-year term (30 senators, 15 counties, and nine years from 2011). Senators are also elected based on a plurality of votes. The Vice-President is the head of the Senate and he also acts as President in his absence. As of 2015, Grand Cape Mount&#x27;s County Superintendent is Tenneh Simpson Kpadebah. Its five districts are (2008 population): Commonwealth District (6,884), Garwula District (29,371), Gola Konneh District (23,930), Porkpa District (40,921) and Tewor District (27,949).

==Economy==

<text>The total fertility rate (TFR) of a population is the average number of children that are born to a woman over her lifetime, if they were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) through their lifetime, and they were to live from birth until the end of their reproductive life.

As of 2023, the total fertility rate varied widely across the world, from 0.7 in South Korea, to 6.1 in Niger.

Fertility tends to be inversely correlated with levels of economic development. Historically, developed countries have significantly lower fertility rates, generally correlated with greater wealth, education, urbanization, and other factors. Conversely, in least developed countries, fertility rates tend to be higher. Families desire children for their labor and as caregivers for their parents in old age. Fertility rates are also higher due to the lack of access to contraceptives, generally lower levels of female education, and lower rates of female employment.

From antiquity to the beginning of the industrial revolution, around the year 1800, total fertility rates of 4.5 to 7.5 were common around the world. 76-77, After this TFR declined only slightly and up until the 1960s the global average TFR was still 5. Since then, global average TFR has dropped steadily to less than half that number, 2.3 births per woman in 2023.

The United Nations predicts that global fertility will continue to decline for the remainder of this century and reach a below-replacement level of 1.8 by 2100, and that world population will peak in 2084.

==Parameter characteristics==
The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is not based on the actual fertility of a specific group of women, as that would require waiting until they have completed childbearing. It also does not involve counting the total number of children born over their lifetime. Instead, the TFR is based on the age-specific fertility rates of women in their &quot;child-bearing years,&quot; typically considered to be ages 15–44 in international statistical usage.

The TFR is a measure of the fertility of an imaginary woman who experiences the age-specific fertility rates for ages 15–49 that were recorded for a specific population in a given year. It represents the average number of children a woman would potentially have if she were to go through all her childbearing years in a single year, subject to the age-specific fertility rates for that year. In simpler terms, the TFR is the number of children a woman would have if she were to experience the prevailing fertility rates at all ages from a single given year and survived throughout her childbearing years.

==Related parameters==
===Net reproduction rate===
An alternative measure of fertility is the net reproduction rate (NRR), which calculates the number of daughters a female would have in her lifetime if she were subject to prevailing age-specific fertility and mortality rates in a given year. When the NRR is exactly 1, each generation of females is precisely replacing itself.

The NRR is not as commonly used as the TFR, but it is particularly relevant in cases where the number of male babies born is very high due to gender imbalance and sex selection. This is a significant consideration in world population dynamics, especially given the high level of gender imbalance in the heavily populated nations of China and India. The gross reproduction rate (GRR) is the same as the NRR, except that, like the TFR, it disregards life expectancy.

===Total period fertility rate===
The TFR, sometimes called TPFR—total period fertility rate, is a better index of fertility than the crude birth rate (annual number of births per thousand population) because it is independent of the age structure of the population, but it is a poorer estimate of actual completed family size than the total cohort fertility rate, which is obtained by summing the age-specific fertility rates that actually applied to each cohort as they aged through time.

In particular, the TFR does not necessarily predict how many children young women now will eventually have, as their fertility rates in years to come may change from those of older women now. However, the TFR is a reasonable summary of current fertility levels. TFR and long term population growth rate, &quot;g&quot;, are closely related. For a population structure in a steady state, growth rate equals formula_1, where formula_2 is the mean age for childbearing women.

====Tempo effect====

The TPFR (total &quot;period&quot; fertility rate) is affected by a tempo effect—if age of childbearing increases, and life cycle fertility is unchanged, then while the age of childbearing is increasing, TPFR will be lower, because the births are occurring later, and then the age of childbearing stops increasing, the TPFR will increase, due to the deferred births occurring in the later period, even though the life cycle fertility has been unchanged. In other words, the TPFR is a misleading measure of life cycle fertility when childbearing age is changing, due to this statistical artifact. This is a significant factor in some countries, such as the Czech Republic and Spain in the 1990s. Some measures seek to adjust for this timing effect to gain a better measure of life-cycle fertility.

===Replacement rates ===

Replacement fertility is the total fertility rate at which women give birth to enough babies to sustain population levels, assuming that mortality rates remain constant and net migration is zero. If replacement level fertility is sustained over a sufficiently long period, each generation will exactly replace itself. In 2003, the replacement fertility rate was 2.1 births per female for most developed countries (2.1 in the UK, for example), but could be as high as 3.5 in undeveloped countries because of higher mortality rates, especially child mortality. The global average for the replacement total fertility rate, eventually leading to a stable global population, for 2010–2015, was 2.3 children per female.

==Lowest-low fertility==
The term &quot;lowest-low fertility&quot; is defined as a TFR at or below 1.3. Lowest-low fertility is found almost exclusively within East Asian countries and Southern European countries. The East Asian American community in the United States also exhibits lowest-low fertility. At one point in the late 20th century and early 21st century this was also observed in Eastern and Southern Europe. Since then, the fertility rate has risen in most countries of Europe. However, in 2023, Spain&#x27;s TFR fell to 1.19, and Italy&#x27;s TFR fell to 1.2 children per woman.

The lowest TFR recorded anywhere in the world in recorded history, is for the Xiangyang district of Jiamusi city (Heilongjiang, China) which had a TFR of 0.41 in 2000. In 2023, South Korea&#x27;s TFR was 0.72 the world&#x27;s lowest for that year.

Outside Asia, the lowest TFR ever recorded was 0.80 for Eastern Germany in 1994. The low Eastern German value was influenced by a change to higher maternal age at birth, with the consequence that neither older cohorts (e.g. women born until the late 1960s), who often already had children, nor younger cohorts, who were postponing childbirth, had many children during that time. The total cohort fertility rate of each age cohort of women in East Germany did not drop as significantly.

==Population-lag effect==

A population that maintained a TFR of 3.8 over an extended period, without a correspondingly high death or emigration rate, would increase rapidly, doubling period ≈32 years. A population that maintained a TFR of 2.0 over a long time would decrease, unless it had a large enough immigration.

It may take several generations for a change in the total fertility rate to be reflected in birth rate, because the age distribution must reach equilibrium. For example, a population that has recently dropped below replacement-level fertility will continue to grow, because the recent high fertility produced large numbers of young couples, who would now be in their childbearing years.

This phenomenon carries forward for several generations and is called population momentum, &quot;population inertia,&quot; or &quot;population-lag effect&quot;. This time-lag effect is of great importance to the growth rates of human populations.

TFR (net) and long-term population growth rate, g, are closely related. For a population structure in a steady state and with zero migration, formula_3, where formula_4 is mean age for childbearing women and thus formula_5. At the left side is shown the empirical relation between the two variables in a cross-section of countries with the most recent y-y growth rate.

The parameter formula_6 should be an estimate of the formula_4; here equal to formula_8 years, way off the mark because of population momentum. E.g. for formula_9, g should be exactly zero, which is seen not to be the case.

==Influencing factors==

Fertility factors are determinants of the number of children that an individual is likely to have. Fertility factors are mostly positive or negative correlations without certain causations.

Factors generally associated with increased fertility include the intention to have children, very high level of gender inequality, inter-generational transmission of values, marriage and cohabitation, maternal and social support, rural residence, pro family government programs, low IQ and increased food production.

Factors generally associated with decreased fertility include rising income, value and attitude changes, education, female labor participation, population control, age, contraception, partner reluctance to having children, a low level of gender inequality, and infertility. The effect of all these factors can be summarized with a plot of total fertility rate against Human Development Index (HDI) for a sample of countries. The chart shows that the two factors are inversely correlated, that is, in general, the lower a country&#x27;s HDI the higher its fertility.

Another common way of summarizing the relationship between economic development and fertility is a plot of TFR against per capita GDP, a proxy for standard of living. This chart shows that per capita GDP is also inversely correlated with fertility.

The impact of human development on TFR can best be summarized by a quote from Karan Singh, a former minister of population in India. At a 1974 United Nations population conference in Bucharest, he said &quot;Development is the best contraceptive.&quot;
Wealthy countries, those with high per capita GDP, usually have a lower fertility rate than poor countries, those with low per capita GDP. This may seem counter-intuitive. The inverse relationship between income and fertility has been termed a &quot;demographic-economic paradox&quot; because evolutionary biology suggests that greater means should enable the production of more offspring, not fewer.

Many of these factors may differ by region and social class. For instance, Scandinavian countries and France are among the least religious in the EU, but have the highest TFR, while the opposite is true about Portugal, Greece, Cyprus, Poland and Spain.

==National efforts to increase or decrease fertility==
Governments have often set population targets, to either increase or decrease the total fertility rate, or to have certain ethnic or socioeconomic groups have a lower or higher fertility rate. Often such policies have been interventionist, and abusive. The most notorious natalist policies of the 20th century include those in communist Romania and communist Albania, under Nicolae Ceaușescu and Enver Hoxha respectively.

The natalist policy in Romania between 1967 and 1989 was very aggressive, including outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, taxes on childlessness, and legal discrimination against childless people. It resulted in large numbers of children put into Romanian orphanages by parents who could not cope with raising them, street children in the 1990s, when many orphanages were closed and the children ended up on the streets, overcrowding in homes and schools, and over 9,000 women who died due to illegal abortions.

Conversely, in China the government sought to lower the fertility rate, and, as such, enacted the one-child policy (1978–2015), which included abuses such as forced abortions. In India, during the national emergency of 1975, a massive compulsory sterilization drive was carried out in India, but it is considered to be a failure and is criticized for being an abuse of power.

Some governments have sought to regulate which groups of society could reproduce through eugenic policies, including forced sterilizations of population groups they considered undesirable. Such policies were carried out against ethnic minorities in Europe and North America in the first half of the 20th century, and more recently in Latin America against the Indigenous population in the 1990s; in Peru, former President Alberto Fujimori has been accused of genocide and crimes against humanity as a result of a sterilization program put in place by his administration targeting indigenous people (mainly the Quechua and Aymara people).

Within these historical contexts, the notion of reproductive rights has developed. Such rights are based on the concept that each person freely decides if, when, and how many children to have - not the state or religion. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, reproductive rights &quot;rest on the recognition of the basic rights of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. It also includes the right to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence, as expressed in human rights documents&quot;.

==History and future projections==
From around 10,000 BC to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, fertility rates around the world were high by 21st-century standards, ranging from 4.5 to 7.5 children per woman.76-77. The onset of the Industrial Revolution around the year 1800 brought about what has come to be called the demographic transition. This eventually led to a long-term decline in TFR in every region of the world that has continued in the 21st century.

===Before 1800 ===
During this period fertility rates of 4.5 to 7.5 were common around the world. 76-77 Child mortality could reach 50% and that plus the need to produce workers, male heirs, and old-age caregivers required a high fertility rate by 21st-century standards. To produce two adult children in this high mortality environment required at least four or more births. For example, fertility rates in Western Europe before 1800 ranged from 4.5 in Scandinavia to 6.2 in Belgium. In 1800, the TFR in the United States was 7.0. Fertility rates in East Asia during this period were similar to those in Europe. Fertility rates in Roman Egypt were 7.4., p77

Despite these high fertility rates, the number of surviving children per woman was always around two because of high mortality rates. As a result, global population growth was still very slow, about 0.04% per year.

===1800 to 1950===
After 1800, the Industrial Revolution began in some places, particularly Great Britain, continental Europe, and the United States, and they underwent the beginnings of what is now called the demographic transition. Stage two of this process fueled a steady reduction in mortality rates due to improvements in public sanitation, personal hygiene and the food supply, which reduced the number of famines.

These reductions in mortality rates, particularly reductions in child mortality, that increased the fraction of children surviving, plus other major societal changes such as urbanization, and the increased social status of women, led to stage three of the demographic transition. There was a reduction in fertility rates, because there was simply no longer a need to birth so many children.

The example from the US of the correlation between child mortality and the fertility rate is illustrative. In 1800, child mortality in the US was 33%, meaning that one third of all children born would die before their fifth birthday. The TFR in 1800 was 7.0, meaning that the average female would bear seven children during their lifetime. In 1900, child mortality in the US had declined to 23%, a reduction of almost one third, and the TFR had declined to 3.9, a reduction of 44%. By 1950, child mortality had declined dramatically to 4%, a reduction of 84%, and the TFR declined to 3.2. By 2018, child mortality had declined further to 0.6% and the TFR declined to 1.9, below replacement level.

The chart shows that the decline in the TFR since the 1960s has occurred in every region of the world. The global TFR is projected to continue declining for the remainder of the century, and reach a below-replacement level of 1.8 by 2100.

In 2022, the global TFR was 2.3. Because the global fertility replacement rate for 2010–2015 was estimated to be 2.3, humanity has achieved or is approaching a significant milestone where the global fertility rate is equal to the global replacement rate.

The global fertility rate may have fallen below the global replacement level of 2.2 children per woman as early as 2023. Numerous developing countries have experienced an accelerated fertility decline in the 2010s and early 2020s. The average fertility rate in countries such as Thailand or Chile approached the mark of one child per woman, which triggered concerns about the rapid aging of populations worldwide.

==== Total fertility rates in 2050 and 2100 ====
The table shows that after 1965, the demographic transition spread around the world, and the global TFR began a long decline that continues in the 21st century.

==By region==


The United Nations Population Division divides the world into six geographical regions. The table below shows the estimated TFR for each region.

In 2013, the TFR of Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Northern America were below the global replacement-level fertility rate of 2.1 children per female.

===Africa===
Africa has a TFR of 4.1, the highest in the world. Angola, Benin, DR Congo, Mali, and the Niger have the highest TFR. In 2023, the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria, had an estimated TFR of 4.57. In 2023, the second most populous African country, Ethiopia, had an estimated TFR of 3.92.

The poverty of Africa, and the high maternal mortality and infant mortality had led to calls from WHO for family planning, and the encouragement of smaller families.

===Asia===
====Eastern Asia====
Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan have the lowest-low fertility, defined as TFR at or below 1.3, and are among the lowest in the world. In 2004, Macau had a TFR below 1.0. In 2018, North Korea had the highest TFR in East Asia, at 1.95.

=====China=====
In 2022, China&#x27;s TFR was 1.09. China implemented the one-child policy in January 1979 as a drastic population planning measure to control the ever-growing population at the time. In January 2016, the policy was replaced with the two-child policy. In July 2021, a three-child policy was introduced, as China&#x27;s population is aging faster than almost any other country in modern history.

=====Japan=====
In 2022, Japan had a TFR of 1.26. Japan&#x27;s population is rapidly aging due to both a long life expectancy and a low birth rate. The total population is shrinking, losing 430,000 in 2018, to a total of 126.4 million. Hong Kong and Singapore mitigate this through immigrant workers. In Japan, a serious demographic imbalance has developed, partly due to limited immigration to Japan.

=====South Korea=====
In South Korea, a low birthrate is one of its most urgent socio-economic challenges. Rising housing expenses, shrinking job opportunities for younger generations, insufficient support to families with newborns either from the government or employers are among the major explanations for its crawling TFR, which fell to 0.92 in 2019. Koreans are yet to find viable solutions to make the birthrate rebound, even after trying out dozens of programs over a decade, including subsidizing rearing expenses, giving priorities for public rental housing to couples with multiple children, funding day care centers, reserving seats in public transportation for pregnant women, and so on.

In the past 20 years, South Korea has recorded some of the lowest fertility and marriage levels in the world. As of 2022, South Korea is the country with the world&#x27;s lowest total fertility rate, at 0.78. In 2022, the TFR of the capital Seoul was 0.57.

====Southern Asia====
=====Bangladesh=====
The fertility rate fell from 6.8 in 1970–1975, to 2.0 in 2020, an interval of about 47 years, or a little less than two generations.

=====India=====
The Indian fertility rate has declined significantly over the early 21st century. The Indian TFR declined from 5.2 in 1971 to 2.2 in 2018. The TFR in India declined to 2.0 in 2019–2020, marking the first time it has gone below replacement level. In 2023, the TFR in India declined to an all-time low of 1.9

=====Iran=====
In the Iranian calendar year (March 2019 – March 2020), Iran&#x27;s total fertility rate fell to 1.8.

====Western Asia====
In 2023, the TFR of Turkey reached 1.51.

===Europe===

The average total fertility rate in the European Union (EU-27) was calculated at 1.53 children per female in 2021. In 2021, France had the highest TFR among EU countries at 1.84, followed by Czechia (1.83), Romania (1.81), Ireland (1.78) and Denmark (1.72). In 2021, Malta had the lowest TFR among the EU countries, at 1.13. Other southern European countries also had very low TFR (Portugal 1.35, Cyprus 1.39, Greece 1.43, Spain 1.19, and Italy 1.25).

In 2021, the United Kingdom had a TFR of 1.53. In 2021 estimates for the non-EU European post-Soviet states group, Russia had a TFR of 1.60, Moldova 1.59, Ukraine 1.57, and Belarus 1.52.

Emigration of young adults from Eastern Europe to the West aggravates the demographic problems of those countries. People from countries such as Bulgaria, Moldova, Romania, and Ukraine are particularly moving abroad.

===Latin America and the Caribbean===
In 2023, the TFR of Brazil, the most populous country in the region, was estimated at 1.75. In 2021, the second most populous country, Mexico, had an estimated TFR of 1.73. The next most populous four countries in the region had estimated TFRs of between 1.9 and 2.2 in 2023, including Colombia (1.94), Argentina (2.17), Peru (2.18), and Venezuela (2.20). Belize had the highest estimated TFR in the region at 2.59 in 2023. In 2021, Puerto Rico had the lowest, at 1.25.

===Northern America===
====Canada====
In 2023, the TFR of Canada was 1.26.

====United States====

The total fertility rate in the United States after World War II peaked at about 3.8 children per female in the late 1950s, dropped to below replacement in the early 70s, and by 1999 was at 2 children. Currently, the fertility is below replacement among those native born, and above replacement among immigrant families, most of whom come to the US from countries with higher fertility. However, the fertility rate of immigrants to the US has been found to decrease sharply in the second generation, correlating with improved education and income. In 2021, the US TFR was 1.664, ranging between over 2 in some states and under 1.6 in others.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
After World War II, Australia&#x27;s TFR was approximately 3.0. In 2017, Australia&#x27;s TFR was 1.74, i.e. below replacement.

<text>Tortuga Island (, ; ; , , &quot;Turtle Island&quot;) is a Caribbean island that forms part of Haiti, off the northwest coast of Hispaniola. It constitutes the &quot;commune&quot; of Île de la Tortue in the Port-de-Paix arrondissement of the Nord-Ouest department of Haiti.

Tortuga is in size and had a population of 25,936 at the 2003 census. In the 17th century, Tortuga was a major center and haven of Caribbean piracy. Its tourism industry and references in many works have made it one of the most recognized regions of Haiti.

==History==
The first Europeans to land on Tortuga were the Spanish in 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus into the New World. On December 6, 1492, three Spanish ships entered the Windward Passage that separates Cuba and Haiti. At sunrise, Columbus noticed an island whose contours emerged from the morning mist. Because the shape reminded him of a turtle&#x27;s shell, he chose the name of Tortuga.

Tortuga was originally settled by a few Spanish colonists under the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo. In 1625, French and English colonists from Saint Kitts arrived on the island of Tortuga after initially planning to settle on mainland Hispaniola. They were attacked in 1629 by Spanish forces commanded by Don Fadrique de Toledo, who expelled them before building a fort on the island and garrisoning it. As most of the garrison eventually left for Hispaniola to expel French colonists residing there, other French settlers returned in 1630, occupying and expanding the fort.

From 1630 onward, the island of Tortuga was divided into French and English colonies, allowing buccaneers to use the island as their main base of operations. In 1633, the first slaves were imported from Africa to aid in the plantations. However, by 1635 the use of slaves had ended. The slaves were said to be out of control on the island, while at the same time there had been continuous disagreements and fighting between French and English colonists on Tortuga.

In 1635, the Spanish expelled the French and English colonists from Tortuga before leaving. As more English and French settlers soon returned, the Spanish returned to expel them again, only to leave because the island was too small to be of major importance. This allowed the return of both French and English colonists. In 1638, the Spanish returned for a third time to secure their claim to the island and expel the French and Dutch settlers on Tortuga. They occupied the island, but were eventually expelled by the French and Dutch colonists in 1640, at which time the French built Fort de Rocher in a natural harbour; the fort enabled the French to defeat a Spanish invasion force the following year.
By 1640, the buccaneers of Tortuga were calling themselves the &quot;Brethren of the Coast&quot;. The buccaneers population was mostly made up of French and Englishmen, along with a small number of Dutchmen. In 1654, the Spanish attacked the island for the fourth and last time, defeating a Franco-English force.

In 1655, Tortuga was settled again by English and French colonists under Elias Watts, who secured a commission from Col. William Brayne, the governor of Jamaica, to serve as governor of Tortuga. In 1664, French buccaneer Jeremie Dechamps sold the island for 15,000 livres to the French West India Company after having tried to sell it to the English for 6,000 pounds following an initial offer of 10,000 pounds by the French. In the same year, 400 French colonists came to Tortuga from Anjou, and they established Hispaniola&#x27;s first sugar plantations since the first wave of European colonization. This group of colonists spread to the coast of the mainland and became the nexus of the French colony of Saint-Domingue. 

By 1670, the buccaneer era was in decline, and many of the pirates turned to log cutting and wood trading as a new income source. At this time, Welsh privateer Henry Morgan started to promote himself and invited the pirates on the island of Tortuga to set sail under him. Morgan and some 2,000 privateers then attacked and sacked Panama the following year. They were hired by the French as a striking force that allowed France to have a much stronger hold on the Caribbean region. Consequently, the pirates never really controlled the island and kept Tortuga as a neutral hideout for pirate booty.

In 1680, the Parliament of England forbade English subjects to sail under foreign flags (in opposition to former practice). This was a major legal blow to the Caribbean pirates. Settlements were made in the Treaty of Ratisbon of 1684, signed by the European powers, that put an end to piracy. Most of the pirates after this time were hired by European powers to suppress their former buccaneer allies. The capital of Saint-Domingue was moved from Tortuga to Port-de-Paix on the mainland of Hispaniola in 1676.

==Geography==
The island of Tortuga stands off the northern coast of Haiti. It is very mountainous and rocky; the rocks are especially abundant on the northern part of the island. At the beginning of the 17th century, the population lived on the southern coast of the island, where there was a port for ships to enter. The northern shore was described as inaccessible via both land and sea.

The inhabited area was divided into four parts; the first of these was called &quot;Low Land&quot; or &quot;Low Country&quot;. This region contained the island&#x27;s port and was therefore considered the most important. The town was called Cayona, and the richest planters of the island lived there. The second region was called the &quot;Middle Plantation&quot;; the farmers of this region were unfamiliar with the soil and it was only used to grow tobacco. The third part was named &quot;La Ringot&quot;, and was positioned on the western portion of the island. The fourth region was called the &quot;La Montagne&quot; (the Mountain); it is there that the first cultivated plantations were established upon the island.

This 17th century geography is known largely from Alexandre-Olivier Exquemelin&#x27;s detailed description in his book &quot;Zeerovers&quot;, where he describes a 1666 journey to the island.

===Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s works===

====&quot;Captain Blood&quot;====
Tortuga is featured in Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s &quot;Captain Blood&quot; series and the movies based on it; the most famous is &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1935) starring Errol Flynn. It is the place where Blood and his crew find refuge after their escape from Barbados in 1685. Blood receives a Letter of Marque from Tortuga&#x27;s governor, D&#x27;Ogeron, and the island becomes his main base for the next four years. He starts his raids from Cayona, and several events in the books take place on Tortuga itself or on ships anchoring in the harbour of Cayona.

Sabatini used Exquemelin&#x27;s &quot;History of the Bouccaneers of America&quot; as a main source for his description of Tortuga, and therefore the island is portrayed as a place where many buccaneers, prostitutes, and other dubious professions operate, but the French West India Company, which rules Tortuga, makes profit off of those affairs.

====&quot;The Black Swan&quot;====
Tortuga also features in Sabatini&#x27;s novel &quot;The Black Swan&quot; and the 1942 movie based on it.

<text>Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., formerly National Automotive Fibers, Inc., was a publicly held American corporation that was traded on the New York and Pacific Stock Exchanges. In 1962, the company adopted the name of one of its acquisitions, Chris-Craft Boats, which was founded in the late 19th century and became famous for mahogany-hulled powerboats in the 1920s through the 1950s. Chris-Craft Industries also went into broadcasting, owning television stations via its subsidiary BHC Communications and co-founding the UPN TV network.

==History==
===National Automotive Fibers===
National Automotive Fibers (NAF) was formed in Detroit in 1928 as a manufacturer of upholstery, carpeting, interior trim and plastic products for the automobile companies Chrysler Motors, Ford Motors and Studebaker-Packard. While successful, the company was only a minor automotive supplier. In the 1940s, NAF purchased the Montrose Chemical Company of San Francisco, but it was still centered on the auto industry. In 1956, the company suffered a major loss of $1 million against sales of $46 million. Paul V. Shields, a senior partner of Shields &amp; Company, a Wall Street investment firm, acquired the company as he saw that NAF was overdependent on the auto industry but had growth potential. Shields trimmed NAF&#x27;s product line and diversified the company into oil and gas operations, television and radio broadcasting. With this diverse portfolio, the company was renamed the NAFI Corporation in 1959. This brought a record profit of $1 million against lowered sales with assets of $10 million. NAF and Bing Crosby teamed up to purchase a television station, KPTV in Portland, Oregon, for $4 million on September 1, 1959. A Bing Crosby–led group sold Los Angeles&#x27; KCOP-TV in 1960 to the corporation.

===Chris-Craft Industries===
Chris-Craft Boats was an independent company until it was acquired by Shields &amp; Company&#x27;s NAFI Corporation in 1960 and merged with NAFI. They renamed the merged company in 1962 as Chris-Craft Industries, Incorporated. In 1962, the company acquired the Old Crown Brewing Corporation, a brewery company based in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Old Crown was sold to its employees a short time later.

In 1964, Chris-Craft launched the all-fiberglass Chris-Craft Commander. This dramatic new design was unveiled at the New York City National Boat show, perched at the top of an escalator on a giant, castered cradle. This first Commander was a 38&#x27; express hardtop with a 13&#x27; beam. The line of Commanders soon grew to include sizes ranging from 19&#x27; to 60&#x27;—all &quot;styled in fiberglass.&quot;

In 1968, Baldwin-Montrose Chemical Co., Inc., took a controlling interest in Chris-Craft and installed its chairman, Herbert J. Siegel, as Chris-Craft&#x27;s chairman.

In 1977, Chris-Craft Industries formed BHC, Inc., to hold its two existing television stations, KCOP in Los Angeles and KPTV in Portland, Oregon, both placed within BHC&#x27;s Chris-Craft Television, Inc., subsidiary. That same year, Chris-Craft purchased a share of 20th Century Fox. The company attempted in 1979 a hostile take over of 20th Century Fox but failed. In 1981, the 20th Century Fox share, then at 20 percent, was traded to Marvin Davis and Marc Rich for 19 percent of United Television.

Between the 1960s and 1980s, Chris-Craft lost market share as competitors with more innovative designs and less expensive manufacturing techniques, such as fiberglass hulls, came on the scene. Chris-Craft ended production of its last mahogany-hulled boat, the &quot;Constellation,&quot; in 1971.

Chris-Craft Industries sold its boat division to Murray Industries in 1981. Chris-Craft Industries retained the Chris-Craft trademark and licensed it to Murray.

After Chris-Craft sold its boat division, it focused solely on its broadcast division. In 1992, BHC acquired Pinelands, an MCA spin off company that owned WWOR-TV in the New York City area, that MCA was forced to spin off the station due to the acquisition of MCA by Japanese multinational conglomerate Matsushita Electric (now Panasonic), and which foreign companies are prohibited from owning more than 25 percent of a television station. In 1994, BHC and Paramount Television announced the formation of the fifth television network United Paramount Network (UPN). The network, targeted toward the young male demographic group, premiered in early 1995 and offered four hours of original prime-time programming per week. The following year original programming was increased to six hours per week. As part of the agreement, Chris-Craft owned 100 percent of UPN, with Paramount having the option to acquire an equal share through January 15, 1997. In 1997, Viacom acquired a 50 percent interest in UPN for $160 million.

In the late 1990s, BHC acquired two television stations, WHSW (now WUTB) in Baltimore, Maryland, and WRBW in Orlando, Florida, it resulted in the increase of BHC&#x27;s number of television stations to ten.

In 1999, Viacom announced plans to merge with CBS Corporation. Because of a regulation upheld by the FCC years ago, prohibiting companies from owning two broadcast networks. Viacom&#x27;s announcement raised questions regarding the future of Chris-Craft and Viacom&#x27;s joint ownership of UPN. In Viacom and Chris-Craft&#x27;s original agreement, two options for exiting the partnership had been determined—buying out the other partner or paying for what the partner had invested up to that date and providing funds for the future operation of UPN. Either option would cost Viacom substantial sums of money. Industry analysts agreed that Chris-Craft could emerge the winner and offered other possible scenarios: that Viacom might offer Chris-Craft some of its stations in exchange for severing the partnership or that Chris-Craft might sell Viacom&#x27;s share to another company.

However after the Viacom-CBS merger was completed in 2000, a lawsuit was filed by BHC against the Viacom-CBS merger as BHC saw this as a breach of the UPN partnership. BHC lost the suit and sold its remaining ownership in UPN to Viacom for $5 million. Shortly thereafter, Chris-Craft announced that it was getting out of broadcasting after losing $500 million on UPN, the possibility of UPN shutting down or having their affiliation pulled. Many industry observers thought Viacom would end up getting the stations, but Viacom&#x27;s bid lost out to News Corporation&#x27;s Fox Television Stations, resulting in a sale which closed on July 31, 2001.

<text>General Lord Robert Edward Henry Somerset (19 December 17761 September 1842) was a British Army commander who fought during the Peninsular War and the War of the Seventh Coalition. He sat in Parliament from 1801–31.

==Life==
Somerset was the third son of Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort, and elder brother of Lord Raglan.

Joining the 15th Light Dragoons in 1793, he became captain in the following year, and received a majority after serving as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Prince Frederick, Duke of York in the Dutch expedition of 1799. At the end of 1800 he became a lieutenant-colonel, and in 1801 received the command of the 4th Dragoons. From 1799 to 1802 he represented the Borough of Monmouth in the House of Commons, from 1803 to 1823 and from 1830 sat for Gloucestershire and from 1834 to 1837 was MP for Cirencester.

He commanded his regiment at the battles of Talavera and Buçaco, and in 1810 received a colonelcy and the appointment of &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to the king. In 1811, along with the 3rd Dragoon Guards, the 4th Dragoons fought a notable cavalry action at Usagre, and in 1812 Lord Edward Somerset was engaged in the great charge of Le Marchant&#x27;s heavy cavalry at Salamanca. His conduct on this occasion (he captured five guns at the head of a single squadron) won him further promotion, and he made the remaining campaigns as a major-general at the head of the Hussar brigade (7th, 10th and 15th Hussars).

At Orthes he won further distinction by his pursuit of the enemy; he was made KCB, and received the thanks of parliament. At Waterloo he was in command of the Household Cavalry Brigade, which distinguished itself not less by its stern and patient endurance of the enemy&#x27;s fire than by its celebrated charge on the cuirassiers of Milhaud&#x27;s corps.

The brigadier was particularly mentioned in Wellington&#x27;s despatches, and received the thanks of parliament as well as the Army Gold Cross with one clasp for his services at Talavera, Salamanca, Vitoria, Orthez, and Toulouse. He also received the Military Order of Maria Theresa and was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Royal Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword.

At Waterloo in 1815 he lost his hat during the first cavalry charge and in the subsequent search for it a cannonball tore off the flap of his coat and killed his horse. He was awarded a GCB in 1834.
After a short illness he died in London on 1 September 1842 and was interred in the church of St. George&#x27;s, Hanover Square. A memorial tablet to Lord Robert Edward is on the south wall of the nave at St. Michael and All Angels, Great Badminton, which is attached to the family seat, Badminton House.

The &#x27;Somerset Monument&#x27; stands high on the Cotswold Edge at Hawkesbury, Gloucestershire (), near the family&#x27;s ancestral home of Badminton, Gloucestershire. It was erected in 1846 and has an inscription in memory of General Lord Robert Somerset.

==Family==
On 17 October 1805 he married Hon. Louisa Augusta Courtenay (17818 February 1825), a younger daughter of William Courtenay, de jure 8th Earl of Devon, with whom he had several children, three sons and five daughters:
* Robert Henry Somerset (1806–1807)
* Louisa Isabella Somerset (1807–1888) who died unmarried.
* Frances Caroline Somerset, later Mrs Theophilus Clive (1808–1890) who married 1840 Theophilus Clive (died 1875), and had issue 1 son who left descendants.
* Blanche Somerset, later Mrs Charles Locke (1811–1879) who married 1845, Rev. Charles Courtenay Locke (died 1848) with no issue,
* Matilda Elizabeth Somerset, later Mrs Horace Marryat (18153 April 1905) who married 1842 Horace Marryat, and had issue two sons: Adrian Somerset Marryat (born 1844) and Frederick Marryat (born 1851), and one daughter Ida Horatia Charlotte Marryat (1843–1910) who married 19 September 1863 (div 1889) Count Gustavus Frederick Bonde (1842–1909), a Swedish nobleman, with issue. The three Marryat children were painted in 1851–2 in Rome by the young Frederick Leighton. Horace Marryat was a much younger brother of the naval officer and writer Frederick Marryat (1792–1848)
* Lieutenant-General Edward Arthur Somerset (1817–1886) married Agatha Miles (1827–1912), daughter of Sir William Miles, Bt and had one son (Lieut Edward William Henry Somerset, 25 January 186620 March 1890, who died unmarried) and eight daughters.
* Georgina Emily Somerset, later the Hon. Mrs Robert Lawley (born 1819) who married 1852 Hon Robert Neville Lawley (who died 1891), and died without issue.
* Augustus Charles Stapleton Somerset (1821–1854) who died unmarried.

<text>Bungarus (commonly known as kraits ) is a genus of venomous snakes in the family Elapidae. The genus is native to Asia. Often found on the floor of tropical forests in South Asia, Southeast Asia and Southern China, they are medium-sized, highly venomous snakes with a total length (including tail) typically not exceeding . These are nocturnal ophiophagious predators which prey primarily on other snakes at night, occasionally taking lizards, amphibians and rodents. Most species are with banded patterns acting as a warning sign to their predators. Despite being considered as generally docile and timid, kraits are capable of delivering highly potent neurotoxic venom which is medically significant with potential lethality to humans. The genus currently holds 18 species and 5 subspecies.

==Distribution==
Kraits are found in tropical and subtropical South and Southeast Asia and Indochina, ranging in the west from Iran, east through the Indian subcontinent (including Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, &amp; Sri Lanka) and into Southeast Asia (including the island of Borneo, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam).

==Description==
Kraits usually range between in total length (including tail), although specimens as large as have been observed. The banded krait (&quot;B. fasciatus&quot;) may grow as large as . Most species of kraits are covered in smooth, glossy scales arranged in bold, striped patterns of alternating black and light-colored areas. This may serve as aposematic colouration in its habitat of grassland and scrub jungle. The scales along the dorsal ridge of the back are hexagonal. The head is slender, and the eyes have round pupils. Kraits have pronounced dorsolateral flattening, which causes them to be triangular in cross section.

==Ecology==
Kraits are nocturnal and ophiophagous, preying chiefly upon other snakes including those of their kinds, although occasional hunt for small rodents and lizards has been observed. They are seldom encountered during daytime while becoming highly alert at night. If disturbed, fleeing is usually their first choice; if failed, they tend to coil up with the head underneath the body for protection. In spite of being generally docile and timid, some species are known to thrash fiercely when caught for relocation. Repeated provocation may result in bites which are the last resort of the snakes. Kraits are oviparous, releasing a clutch of 12 to 14 eggs in piles of leaf litter. The female usually stays with them until they hatch.

==Venom==
&quot;Bungarus&quot; contains some species that are among the most venomous land snakes in the world, to mice, based on their . They have a highly potent, neurotoxic venom, which can induce muscle paralysis. Clinically, their venom contains mostly presynaptic neurotoxins, which affect the ability of neuron endings to properly release a chemical communication mechanism to the next neuron. Following envenomation with bungarotoxins, transmitter release is initially blocked (leading to a brief paralysis), followed by a period of massive overexcitation (cramps, tremors, spasms), which finally tapers off to paralysis. 

These phases of envenomation may or may not be experienced in all parts of the body; they may or may not be experienced simultaneously. The severity of the bite itself and the actual dosage of venom delivered plays a role in the intensity of symptoms. As kraits are mainly nocturnal, encounters with humans are rare during the daytime. Bites mainly occur after sunset, and are often (initially) painless; thus, a bite may go unnoticed if the victim is sleeping or otherwise does not see or notice the krait, further prolonging envenomation damage within the body. Still—whenever possible—medical treatment should be sought posthaste, as a bite from a krait is considered potentially life-threatening. All venomous snake bites must be taken seriously as an immediate medical emergency.

Typically, victims will start to notice severe abdominal cramps accompanied by progressive muscular paralysis, and frequently starting with ptosis. As no local symptoms are usually seen, a patient should be carefully observed for tell-tale signs of paralysis (e.g. the onset of bilateral ptosis, diplopia, and dysphagia), and subsequently treated (as quickly as possible) with antivenom. Frequently, little or no pain occurs at the site of a krait bite, which can provide false reassurance to the victim. The major medical difficulty of envenomated patients is the lack of medical resources (especially intubation supplies and mechanical ventilators in rural hospitals) and potential for ineffectiveness by the antivenom.

Upon arriving at a healthcare facility, support must be provided until the venom has metabolised and the victim can breathe unaided, especially if no species-specific antivenom is available. Given that the toxins alter acetylcholine transmission—which causes the paralysis—some patients have been successfully treated with cholinesterase inhibitors, such as physostigmine or neostigmine, but success is variable and may be species-dependent, as well. If death occurs, it typically takes place about 6-12 hours after the krait bite, but can be significantly delayed. The usual cause of death in that situation is respiratory failure—suffocation by complete paralysis of the diaphragm. Even if patients make it to a hospital, subsequently entering a permanent coma (and even brain death from hypoxia) may occur, given the potential for long transport times to get medical care, in some regions.

Mortality rates caused by bites from the members of this genus vary by species; according to University of Adelaide Department of Toxicology, bites from the banded krait have a mortality rate of 1–10% in untreated humans, while that of the common krait is 70–80%. In common with those of all other venomous snakes, the death time and fatality rate resulting from bites of kraits depend on numerous factors, such as the venom yield and the health status of the victim.

Polyvalent elapid antivenom is effective in neutralizing of the venoms of &quot;B. candidus&quot; and &quot;B. flaviceps&quot;, and rather effective for &quot; B. fasciatus&quot;, and the monovalent &quot;B. fasciatus&quot; antivenom is also moderately effective.

<text>The Pentland Skerries (Old Norse: &quot;Pettlandssker&quot;) are a group of four uninhabited islands lying in the Pentland Firth, northeast of Duncansby Head and south of South Ronaldsay in Scotland.

By far the largest of the islands is Muckle Skerry, home to two lighthouses, built in 1794. The other islands lie to the south of Muckle Skerry. From west to east, they are Little Skerry, Louther Skerry and Clettack Skerry.

The skerries form part of the Pentland Firth Islands Important Bird Area (IBA), so designated by BirdLife International because it supports significant breeding populations of seabirds.

== Accidents ==
MV Priscilla ran aground on Pentland Skerries on 18 July 2018.

<doc id="636846" wikidata="Q6983007" url="?curid=636846" title="Calluna">
<text>Calluna vulgaris, common heather, ling, or simply heather, is the sole species in the genus Calluna in the flowering plant family Ericaceae. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub growing to tall, or rarely to and taller, and is found widely in Europe and Asia Minor on acidic soils in open sunny situations and in moderate shade.

It is the dominant plant in most heathland and moorland in Europe, and in some bog vegetation and acidic pine and oak woodland. It is tolerant of grazing and regenerates following occasional burning, and is often managed in nature reserves and grouse moors by sheep or cattle grazing, and also by light burning.

==Description==
&quot;Calluna&quot; can reach in height. It has small-scale leaves (less than 2–3 mm long) borne in opposite and decussate pairs, whereas those of &quot;Erica&quot; are generally larger and in whorls of 3–4, sometimes 5. It flowers from July to September. In wild plants these are normally mauve, but white-flowered plants also occur occasionally. They are terminal in racemes with sepal-like bracts at the base with a superior ovary, the fruit a capsule. Unlike &quot;Erica&quot;, &quot;Calluna&quot; sometimes sports double flowers. &quot;Calluna&quot; is sometimes referred to as Summer (or Autumn) heather to distinguish it from winter or spring flowering species of &quot;Erica&quot;.

=== Chemistry ===
Phenolic compounds in the shoots of &quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot; include chlorogenic acid and a novel phenolic glycoside, most of which are found in greater number during the summer.

The nectar of &quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot; contains a megastigmane, callunene, that is inhibitory at naturally occurring concentrations to a common trypanosome parasite of bumble bees, &quot;Crithidia bombi&quot;. Koch et al. elucidate the mechanism of activity that results in the loss of the parasite&#x27;s flagellum, leading to reduced infectivity, because the flagellum is crucial to anchoring in the insect gut.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Calluna&quot; was separated from the closely related genus &quot;Erica&quot; by Richard Anthony Salisbury, who devised the generic name &quot;Calluna&quot; probably from the Ancient Greek ([καλλύνω]), &quot;beautify, sweep clean&quot;, in reference to its traditional use in besoms. The specific epithet &quot;vulgaris&quot; is Latin for &#x27;common&#x27;. &quot;Calluna&quot; is differentiated from &quot;Erica&quot; by its corolla and calyx each being in four parts instead of five.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot; is native to Europe, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and the Azores. It has been introduced into many other places worldwide with suitable climates, including North America, Australia, New Zealand and the Falkland Islands. It is extremely cold-hardy, surviving severe exposure and freezing conditions well below .

== Ecology ==
Heather is an important food source for various sheep and deer which can graze the tips of the plants when snow covers low-growing vegetation. Willow grouse and red grouse feed on the young shoots and seeds of this plant. Both adult and larva of the heather beetle (&quot;Lochmaea suturalis&quot;) feed on it, and can cause extensive mortality in some instances. The larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species also feed on the plant, notably the small emperor moth &quot;Saturnia pavonia&quot;.

=== As an invasive species ===
The plant was introduced to New Zealand and has become an invasive weed in some areas, notably the Tongariro National Park and Mount Ruapehu in the North Island, as well as the Wilderness Reserve (Te Anau) in the South Island, overgrowing native plants. Heather beetles have been released to stop the heather, with preliminary trials successful to date.

==Cultivars==
There are many named cultivars, selected for variation in flower colour and for different foliage colour and growing habits.

Different cultivars have flower colours ranging from white, through pink and a wide range of purples, and including reds. The flowering season with different cultivars extends from late July to November in the northern hemisphere. The flowers may turn brown but still remain on the plants over winter, and this can lead to interesting decorative effects. Cultivars with ornamental foliage are usually selected for reddish and golden leaf colour. A few forms can be silvery grey. Many of the ornamental foliage forms change colour with the onset of winter weather, usually increasing in intensity of colour. Some forms are grown for distinctive young spring foliage.

The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:

==Uses==
Formerly heather was used to dye wool yellow and to tan leather. With malt, heather is an ingredient in gruit, a mixture of flavourings used in the brewing of heather-beer during the Middle Ages before the use of hops. Thomas Pennant wrote in &quot;A Tour in Scotland&quot; (1769) that on the Scottish island of Islay &quot;ale is frequently made of the young tops of heath, mixing two thirds of that plant with one of malt, sometimes adding hops&quot;. &quot;Heath Beer&quot; is mentioned in the recipe book of Lady Ann Fanshawe (compiled from 1651).

From time immemorial heather has been used for making besoms, a practice recorded in &quot;Buy Broom Buzzems&quot; a song probably written by William Purvis (Blind Willie) (1752–1832) from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England.

Heather honey is a highly valued product in moorland and heathland areas, with many beehives being moved there in late summer. Not always as valued as it is today, it was dismissed as , &quot;unwholesome honey&quot; by Dioscurides. Heather honey has a characteristic strong taste, and an unusual texture, for it is thixotropic, being a jelly until stirred, when it becomes a syrup like other honey, but then sets again to a jelly. This makes the extraction of the honey from the comb difficult, and it is therefore often sold as comb honey.

White heather is regarded in Scotland as being lucky, a tradition brought from Balmoral to England by Queen Victoria and sprigs of it are often sold as a charm and worked into bridal bouquets.

Heather stalks are used by a small industry in Scotland as a raw material for sentimental jewellery. The stalks are stripped of bark, dyed in bright colours and then compressed with resin.

&quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot; herb has been used in the traditional Austrian medicine internally as tea for treatment of disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract.

==In culture==
Heather is seen as iconic of Scotland, where the plant grows widely. When poems like &quot;Bonnie Auld Scotland&quot; speak of &quot;fragrant hills of purple heather&#x27;, when the hero of &quot;Kidnapped&quot; flees through the heather, when heather and Scotland are linked in the same sentence, the heather talked about is &quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;.

Purple heather is one of the two national flowers of Norway, the other being &quot;Saxifraga cotyledon&quot;. It was chosen as a national flower on the basis of a vote of popularity in a Norwegian radio show in 1976.

&quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot; is the province flower of the Swedish province of Västergötland.

<text>The United States Customs Service was a federal law enforcement agency of the U.S. federal government. Established on July 31, 1789, it collected import tariffs, performed other selected border security duties, as well as conducted criminal investigations.

In March 2003, as a result of the homeland security reorganization, the U.S. Customs Service was renamed the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, and most of its components were merged with the border elements of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, including the entire U.S. Border Patrol and former INS inspectors, together with border agriculture inspectors, to form U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a single, unified border agency for the U.S. The investigative office of U.S. Customs was split off and merged with the INS investigative office and the INS interior detention and removal office to form Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which, among other things, is responsible for interior immigration enforcement. The United States Customs Service had three major missions: collecting tariff revenue, protecting the U.S. economy from smuggling and illegal goods, and processing people and goods at ports of entry.

== History ==
Responding to the urgent need for revenue following the American Revolutionary War, the First United States Congress passed and President George Washington signed the Tariff Act of July 4, 1789, which authorized the collection of duties on imported goods. Four weeks later, on July 31, the fifth act of Congress established the United States Customs Service and its ports of entry.

As part of this new government agency, a new role was created for government officials which was known as &quot;Customs Collector&quot;. In this role, one person would have responsibility to supervise the collection of custom duties in a particular city or region, such as the Collector of the Port of New York.

For over 100 years after it was founded, the U.S. Customs Service was the primary source of funds for the entire government, paying for the country&#x27;s early growth and infrastructure. Purchases include the Louisiana and Oregon territories; Florida and Alaska; funding the National Road and the Transcontinental Railroad; building many of the nation&#x27;s lighthouses; the U.S. Military and Naval academies, and Washington, D.C.

The U.S. Customs Service employed a number of federal law enforcement officers throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Customs Special Agents investigated smuggling and other violations of customs, narcotics and revenue laws. Customs Inspectors were uniformed officers at airports, seaports and land border ports of entry who inspected people and vehicles entering the U.S. for contraband and dutiable merchandise. Customs Patrol Officers conducted uniformed and plainclothes patrol of the borders on land, sea and air to deter smuggling and apprehend smugglers.

In the 20th century, as international trade and travel increased dramatically, the Customs Service transitioned from an administrative bureau to a federal law enforcement agency. Inspectors still inspected goods and took customs declarations from travelers at ports of entry, but Customs Special Agents used modern police methods—often in concert with allied agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and U.S. Border Patrol—to investigate cases often far from international airports, bridges and land crossings. The original World Trade Center complex, Building 6, housed offices of the U.S. Customs Service.

With the passage of the Homeland Security Act, the U.S. Customs Service passed from under the jurisdiction of the Treasury Department to under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security.

On March 1, 2003, parts of the U.S. Customs Service combined with the Inspections Program of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine of the USDA and the Border Patrol of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to form U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The Federal Protective Service, along with the investigative arms of the U.S. Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, combined to form U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

== Examples of illegal items ==

*Child pornography
*Counterfeit merchandise (i.e. cellphones, perfume and other consumer products)
*Textiles over allowable limits
*Illegally imported Motor Vehicles
*Items violating intellectual property rights
*Illegal drugs
*Stolen property
*Tobacco products over allowable limits
*Undeclared firearms and weapons
*Undeclared liquor over allowable limits
*Unreported money or monetary instruments over $10,000
*Unscreened fruits and meats

==Flag==

The flag of the Customs Service was designed in 1799 by Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott Jr. and consists of 16 vertical red and white stripes with a coat of arms depicted in blue on the white canton. The original design had the Customs Service seal that was an eagle with three arrows in his left talon, an olive branch in his right and surrounded by an arc of 13 stars. In 1951, this was changed to the eagle depicted on the Great Seal of the United States.

Its actual name is the Revenue Ensign, as it was flown by ships of the Revenue Cutter Service, later the Coast Guard, and at customs houses.

In 1910, President William Howard Taft issued an order to add an emblem to the flag flown by ships from the one flown on land at customs houses. The version with the badge continues to be flown by Coast Guard vessels. Until 2003, the land version was flown at all United States ports of entry. The renamed CBP Ensign is currently flown at CBP&#x27;s headquarters in Washington, D.C., at its Field Offices, overseas duty locations including preclearance ports, and at all land, air, and sea ports of entry.

A modified version of the flag, with the seal replaced by the star pattern from the national flag (albeit in blue), is often circulated by sovereign citizens as a &quot;peacetime flag&quot;.

== Commissioners ==
Beginning in 1927, the Customs Service was headed by an appointed commissioner. Prior to 1927, customs collection was overseen by the director of the Treasury Department&#x27;s customs division. Commissioners of Customs included:

<doc id="636851" wikidata="Q2805892" url="?curid=636851" title="Amir Hamudi Hasan al-Sadi">
<text>Amir Hamudi Hasan al-Saadi () or Amer al-Sadi (born April 5, 1938), &quot;the organizational genius behind the Iraqi superweapons program,&quot; was Saddam Hussein&#x27;s liaison with the UN inspectors in the runup to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Like the defector Hussein Kamel al-Majid, he insisted Iraq had destroyed its prohibited weapons. He was dismissed by the US as a liar. There was a subsequent failure to uncover weapons of mass destruction by the Iraqi Survey Group.

He was #32 on the most-wanted list, and &quot;Seven of Diamonds&quot; in the US deck of most-wanted Iraqi playing cards.

== Detainment ==

He turned himself in to coalition forces on April 12, 2003, with the help of ZDF journalists who he asked to monitor and document his surrender. He was detained in Baghdad International Airport as a &quot;High Value Detainee&quot;. As such he has been subjected to solitary confinement for 23 hours a day. The International Committee of the Red Cross stated in its confidential report to the coalition authority that this constituted a &quot;serious violation of the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions&quot;. He was both the first person on the most wanted list to turn himself in, and the first to be detained by the U.S.

According to a written Parliamentary answer by Dennis Mcshane MP to Angus Robertson MP, Amer Al Saadi was released by the US on 18 January 2005. However, as detailed here, this claim is highly dubious. A June 20, 2005 Newsweek article reported that a &quot;State Department official...denied al-Sadi had been freed from custody.&quot;

== Career ==
He was awarded a PhD is in physical chemistry from Battersea College of Technology. During his study he married a German, Hilma, in London in October 1963; their common language is English. Mrs al-Saadi raised their children in Hamburg.

He retired as lieutenant general in 1994 and was made a presidential scientific advisor. His friend Ala Bashir mentioned that al-Sadi was totally paralyzed and hosted in Qatar. In 2017, the Iraqi Council of Representatives included him among those whose tangible and intangible assets were to be confiscated.

<doc id="636856" wikidata="Q1295130" url="?curid=636856" title="Ghilman">
<text>Ghilman (singular &#x27;, plural&#x27;) were slave-soldiers and/or mercenaries in armies throughout the Islamic world. Islamic states from the early 9th century to the early 19th century consistently deployed slaves as soldiers, a phenomenon that was very rare outside of the Islamic world.

The Quran mentions &quot;ghilman&quot; () as serving boys who are one of the delights of &quot;Jannah&quot; or paradise/heaven of Islam, in verse 52:24 (Verse 56:17 is also thought to refer to ghilman).

== Etymology ==
The words &quot;ghilman&quot; () and its singular variant &quot;ghulam&quot; () are of Arabic origin, meaning &#x27; or &#x27;. It derives from the Arabic root &quot;ḡ-l-m&quot; ().

==History==
The &quot;ghilman&quot; were slave-soldiers taken as prisoners of war from conquered regions or frontier zones, especially from among the Turkic people of Central Asia and the Caucasian peoples (Turkish: &quot;Kölemen&quot;). They fought in bands, and demanded high pay for their services.

The use of slave soldiers in the Islamic world stretches back to 625, when African slave soldiers were mentioned serving under Muhammad and the Rashidun Caliphate. Slavs and Berbers were also used under the Umayyad Caliphs. However, large-scale use became prevalent only in the mid-9th century. The first Muslim ruler to form an army of slave soldiers, before the Abbasid Caliphs, seems to have been Ibrahim I ibn al-Aghlab (800–812), founder of the Aghlabids of Ifriqiya, where there was already a large population of agricultural slaves and access to extensive slave trading networks across the Sahara Desert.

&quot;Ghilman&quot; were introduced to the Abbasid Caliphate during the reign of al-Mu&#x27;tasim (r. 833–842), who showed them great favor and relied upon them for his personal guard. Accounts cite that their numbers increased in the caliphal household as Mu&#x27;tasim tried to address the court factionalism. These slave-soldiers were opposed by the native Arab population, and riots against them in Baghdad in 836 forced Mu&#x27;tasim to relocate his capital to Samarra.

The use of &quot;ghilman&quot; reached its maturity under al-Mu&#x27;tadid and their training was conceived and inspired through the noble &quot;furusiyya&quot;. From a slave, a &quot;ghulam&quot; attained his freedom after completing the formative training period and joined the elite corps as a mounted warrior. The &quot;ghilman&quot; rose rapidly in power and influence, and under the weak rulers that followed Mu&#x27;tasim, they became kingmakers: they revolted several times during the so-called &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot; in the 860s and killed four caliphs. Eventually, starting with Ahmad ibn Tulun in Egypt, some of them became autonomous rulers and established dynasties of their own, leading to the dissolution of the Abbasid Caliphate by the mid-10th century.

In Umayyad Spain, slave soldiers of &quot;saqaliba&quot; (Slavs) were used from the time of Al-Hakam I, but only became a large professional force in the tenth century, when the slave soldier recruitment shifted to Christian Spain, particularly the Kingdom of León.

A ghulam was trained and educated at his master&#x27;s expense and could earn his freedom through his dedicated service. Ghilman were required to marry Turkic slave-women, who were chosen for them by their masters. Some ghilman seem to have lived celibate lives. The absence of family life and offspring was possibly one of the reasons that ghilman, even when they attained power, generally failed to start dynasties or to proclaim their independence. There are, however, a few exceptions to that rule, such the Ghaznavid dynasty of Afghanistan and the Anushtegin dynasty, which succeeded it.

Slave soldiers became the core of Islamic armies as the Bedouin, Ghazi holy warriors and Hashariyan conscripts were not as reliable, while Ghilman were expected to be loyal as they had no personal connections to the rest of society. However, the Ghilman often did not remain as loyal as expected.

From the 10th century, masters would distribute tax farming land grants (Iqta) to the ghilman to support their slave armies.

The Buyids and likely the Tahirids also built armies of Turkish slave soldiers. The Saffarids drew slave soldiers from Turks, Indians and Africans. The Ghaznavid dynasty, which originated from a slave soldier of the Samanids, also built their military around slave soldiers, first Turks and later Indians.
The Turkish Seljuks and their successors the Ghurids and the Turkic Khwarazmian dynasty also continued with an army of mainly Turkish slave soldiers. Seljuk regional princes were each placed under the tutelage of slave soldier guardians (atābak) who formed their own dynasties. After a brief interruption under the Mongols, the institution returned under the Qara Qoyunlu and Aq Qoyunlu Turkmens. The various Iranian dynasties (Safavid, Afsharid, Qajar) drew slave soldiers from the Caucasus such as Georgians, Circassians and Armenians. (Unlike the Seljuks, who quickly abandoned their tribal warriors for an increase in slave-soldier forces, the Mongols did not adopt the institution of slave-soldiers).

The Delhi Sultanate also made extensive use of Turkish cavalry ghilman as their core shock troops. After Central Asia fell to the Mongols they switched to capturing Hindu boys to convert into Islamic slave soldiers.

There were violent ethnic conflicts between the different groups of ghilman, the Turks, Slavs, Nubians and Berbers in particular.

==Tactics and equipment==
Islamic caliphs often recruited slave-soldiers from the Turkic peoples of Central Asia due to their hardiness in desert conditions and expertise with horseback riding. &quot;Ghilman&quot; in the Abbasid Caliphate fought primarily as a mounted strike force whose purpose was to weaken the enemy with swift and rapid attacks before allied infantry were sent into battle. They carried a lance that could be used to impale enemy infantry easily and a round wooden shield that had been reinforced with either animal skin or thin metal plates. These &quot;ghilman&quot; also carried a sword on their belt, where it was easier to draw as opposed to the back or the chest.

==Heaven==
The Quran mentions &quot;ghilman&quot; in verse 52:24: &quot;There will circulate among them &quot;ghilman&quot; for them, as if they were pearls well-protected.&quot; Ghilman are traditionally described as servant boys provided especially for believers in heaven. In verse 56:17: &quot;There will circulate among them [the faithful in heaven] young boys made eternal&quot; -- &quot;them&quot; refer to the faithful in heaven and &quot;young boys made eternal&quot; &quot;to ghilman&quot;. Descriptions of the &quot;ghilman&quot; by tenth and sixteenth-century theologians were focused on their beauty. Their commentaries also hold that the extratemporal parameters of the Paradise, which the young servants inhabit, are also extended to them so that they do not age or die. Some have suggested that homosexuality might apply in heaven where there is no need for procreation, and that the &quot;ghilman&quot; might be the male equivalent of the famously beautiful female houris that the faithful marry in heaven.

<text>Baalah, properly Baʿalah (&quot;Mistress&quot; or &quot;Lady&quot; in the Northwest Semitic languages, sometimes Baʿalat) is the feminine form of Baʿal (&quot;Lord&quot;) and was applied to various Levantine goddesses.

It was also the name of several places in ancient Palestine:

* Another name of Kirjath-jearim
* A city in Negev given to Simeon, also romanized as Bilhah (1 Chr. 4:29) and Balah (Josh. 19:3)

<text>The Summer Isles (, ) are an archipelago lying in the mouth of Loch Broom, in the Highland region of Scotland.

==Geography==
Tanera Mòr is the largest island and was the last one to remain inhabited. It was formerly home to an Atlantic salmon fish farm, some rental holiday homes, a café and a post office, which operated its own local post and printed its own stamps from 1970 until 2013, but a new set is planned for 2016. The island has no roads, and the only recognisable path goes around the Anchorage, the sheltered bay on the east side of the island. Boats sail to the island from Achiltibuie and Ullapool.

===Other islands===

* Bò Bhùiridh
* Bottle Island
* Càrn Deas
* Càrn Iar
* Càrn nan Sgeir

* Sgeir Loisgte
* Sgeir nam Mult
* Sgeir Ribhinn
* Sgeirean Glasa
* Stac Mhic Aonghais
* Tanera Beag
==Conservation==
The islands are part of the Assynt-Coigach National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland.

Frank Fraser Darling, an important figure in the development of Scottish conservation, lived on Tanera Mòr for two years in the 1930s. His book, &quot;Island Years&quot; (published 1940), records his time in the Summer Isles, painting Priest Island as a place of great beauty as well as great wildlife.

==Literature, film, and music==
*The Summer Isles feature in a novella of the same name by Ian R. MacLeod.
*The fictional Summer Isle, Cladach Duillich (Sad Shore), features in the 1977 Desmond Bagley novel &quot;The Enemy&quot;.
*The third movement of a guitar suite, &quot;The Great Western Road,&quot; on the album of the same name by Tim Slemmons, is entitled, &quot;III. Evening in the Summer Isles.&quot;
* The Children&#x27;s Film Foundation (CFF) &quot;The Big Catch&quot; (1968) features a group of boys who plan to sail to The Summer Isles to capture a wild pony. Filming took place in and around Ullapool and Lochinver.
*The pagan island of &quot;Summerisle&quot; featured in the motion picture &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (filmed in 1973 &amp; directed by Robin Hardy) is sometimes mistakenly associated with this archipelago, but in actuality &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; was filmed around Newton Stewart in Dumfries and Galloway.

==Summer Isles Philatelic Bureau==
Since 1970 the Summer Isles Philatelic Bureau has been issuing stamps of the islands for tourists who place them on mail to be carried to the nearest GPO Post Box on the mainland.

==Culture==
The musician Mairearad Green grew up in Achiltibuie on the Coigach peninsula, overlooking the Summer Isles. She has released an album entitled &quot;Summer Isles&quot;.

<doc id="636872" wikidata="Q24156" url="?curid=636872" title="Daboecia">
<text>Daboecia , or St. Dabeoc&#x27;s heath, is a small genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae, containing two evergreen shrubs, closely related to the genus &quot;Erica&quot;. They are native to cliffs and heathland in southern Atlantic Europe and the Azores.

==Description==
They produce urn-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink and red. &quot;Daboecia&quot; differ from European &quot;Erica&quot; species in having a substantially larger corolla. The leaves are always alternate in &quot;Daboecia&quot;, never whorled. The generic name comes from the Irish Saint Dabheog.

==Distribution==
&quot;Daboecia&quot; has an oceanic distribution in western Europe, including western Ireland, western France, northwestern Spain, northwestern mainland Portugal and the Central Group of the Azores. Like &quot;Erica&quot; and &quot;Calluna&quot; species, &quot;Daboecia&quot; are calcifuges, but will tolerate neutral soils and avoid peat.

==Species==
* &quot;Daboecia azorica&quot; 
* &quot;Daboecia cantabrica&quot; (Irish heath)
Some botanists regard &quot;D. azorica&quot; as a subspecies of &quot;D. cantabrica&quot;, which would render the genus monospecific.

==Cultivation==
The two species have been extensively cultivated and hybridised to produce a number of popular garden plants. Cultivars include selections from the hybrid between the two species, which is named &quot;Daboecia&quot; × &quot;scotica&quot;.

The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017):

*&quot;D. cantabrica&quot; &#x27;Waley&#x27;s Red&#x27;
*&quot;D. cantabrica&quot; subsp. &quot;scotica&quot; &#x27;Silverwells&#x27;
*&quot;D. cantabrica&quot; subsp. &quot;scotica&quot; &#x27;William Hicks&#x27;

<text>Bunita Marcus (born May 5, 1952) is an American composer.

Bunita met Morton Feldman in 1976, beginning a long association that lasted until his death in 1987. For seven years they were inseparable. Feldman and Marcus composed side by side, sharing musical thoughts and ideas. In 1985 Feldman dedicated to her his new piano composition: &quot;For Bunita Marcus.&quot;

<text>Hoèl of Cornwall (died 1156) was count of Nantes, from 1148 to his death. He was raised the son of Duke Conan III and Maud FitzRoy, an illegitimate daughter of King Henry I of England. However, he was disinherited by his father when on his death-bed, as Conan III claimed that Hoèl was illegitimate and no son of his. Bertha then became heiress to Duke Conan&#x27;s lands in Brittany, while Hoèl was allowed to remain Count of Nantes. He was accused by St. Bernard of Clairvaux of having an incestuous affair with his sister Bertha.

The traditional story of the disinheritance might be a fable. Viscount Charles de la Lande de Calan proposed, in 1908, that Hoël was an illegitimate son for whom Conan III decided to provide Nantes for his support. The name Hoël had been used for illegitimate sons of the counts of Nantes. Katharine Keats-Rohan, in 1996, proposed that Conan III disinherited his legitimate son for the purpose of unifying Brittany through the marriage of his daughter Bertha to her cousin Alan, whose father inherited two of the provinces of Brittany. Hoël was given Nantes for his lifetime. This arrangement would have required years of planning to implement, and might have begun before Hoël was born.

Supported by Geoffrey FitzEmpress, Henry II&#x27;s younger brother in 1156 the Nantaise rebelled against Hoèl and drove him out of the country. Control of Nantes was part of a larger strategy in the ongoing war between Stephen of England and Empress Matilda. With his sister&#x27;s marriage to Alan, 1st Earl of Richmond, Brittany entered the conflict on the side of Stephen.

Shortly after his exile from Nantes, Hoèl of Cornwall may have sought sanctuary at the Cistercian abbey of Melleray, where he may have died shortly thereafter.

<doc id="636887" wikidata="Q700113" url="?curid=636887" title="Odo II, Viscount of Porhoët">
<text>Odo II, Count of Porhoet (died after 1180) was the son of Geoffroy, Viscount de Porhoët, and his wife Hawise (possibly Fergant). He became Duke of Brittany in 1148, jure uxoris, upon his marriage to Bertha, Duchess of Brittany.

On Bertha&#x27;s death, Odo II denied her son Conan IV of Penthièvre, Duke of Brittany his inheritance. While Odo II&#x27;s marriage to Bertha was his first, it was her second marriage, her first being to Alain &#x27;le Noir&#x27; de Penthièvre, Lord of Richmond (Alan, 1st Earl of Richmond). Odo II allied with his brother-in-law, Hoèl, Count of Nantes. Odo II was deposed by his stepson Conan IV in 1156, and taken prisoner by Conan IV&#x27;s ally Raoul de Fougères.

He married secondly, in 1167, a daughter of Guihomar IV, Viscount of Léon, and his wife Nobilis, sometimes identified by the names Eleanor or Joan by later authors

== Issue ==
Odo II had two children with Bertha:
* Geoffrey de Porhoët
* Adelaide (or Alix) of Porhoët (d. 1220). She was sent to Henry II of England&#x27;s court as a hostage and was alleged by his enemies to have become his mistress. This accusation remains unclear. She later became Abbess of Fontevrault.

Odo and his second wife had three or four children:
* Odo III of Porhoët (died 1231). He was married, but the name of his wife is not known.
* Harvey or Henry of Porhoët
* Eleanor of Porhoët, wife of Conan of Penthièvre, de La Roche-Derrien, son of Henry of Penthièvre, Count of Tréguier and Guingamp, and Mathilde de Vendôme.
* maybe Alice of Porhoët, who married into the Mauvoisin family

<text>Sir Richard Rodney Bennett (29 March 193624 December 2012) was an English composer and pianist. He was noted for his musical versatility, drawing from such sources as jazz, romanticism, and avant-garde; and for his use of twelve-tone technique and serialism. His body of work included over 200 concert works and 50 scores for film and television. He was also active in jazz, as a composer, a pianist, and an occasional vocalist.

For his scoring work, Bennett was nominated for a total of 10 BAFTA Awards, winning once for Best Original Music for the film &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974). He was also nominated for three Academy Awards (&quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot;, 1967; &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot;, 1971; and &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;) and three Grammy Awards, among other accolades. He was the International Chair of Composition of the Royal Academy of Music, and was knighted in 1998.

== Life and career ==
Bennett was born at Broadstairs, Kent, but was raised in Devon during World War II. His mother, Joan Esther, née Spink (1901–1983) was a pianist who had trained with Gustav Holst and sang in the first professional performance of &quot;The Planets&quot;. His father, Rodney Bennett (1890–1948), was a children&#x27;s book author, poet and lyricist, who worked with Roger Quilter on his theatre works and provided new words for some of the numbers in the &quot;Arnold Book of Old Songs&quot;.

Bennett was a pupil at Leighton Park School. He later studied at the Royal Academy of Music with Howard Ferguson and Lennox Berkeley. Ferguson regarded him as extraordinarily brilliant, having perhaps the greatest talent of any British composer in his generation, though lacking in a personal style. During this time, Bennett attended some of the Darmstadt summer courses in 1955, where he was exposed to serialism. He later spent two years in Paris as a student of the prominent serialist Pierre Boulez between 1957 and 1959. He always used both his first names after finding another Richard Bennett active in music.

Bennett taught at the Royal Academy of Music between 1963 and 1965, at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore, United States from 1970 to 1971, and was later International Chair of Composition at the Royal Academy of Music between 1994 and the year 2000. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1977, and was knighted in 1998.

Bennett produced over 200 works for the concert hall, and 50 scores for film and television. He was also a writer and performer of jazz songs for 50 years. Immersed in the techniques of the European avant-garde via his contact with Boulez, Bennett subsequently developed his own dramato-abstract style. In his later years, he adopted an increasingly tonal idiom.

Bennett regularly performed as a jazz pianist, with such singers as Cleo Laine, Marion Montgomery (until her death in 2002), Mary Cleere Haran (until her death in 2011), and more recently with Claire Martin, performing the Great American Songbook. Bennett and Martin performed at such venues as The Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel in New York, and The Pheasantry and Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club in London.

In later years, in addition to his musical activities, Bennett became known as an artist working in the medium of collage. He exhibited these collages several times in England, including at the Holt Festival, Norfolk in 2011, and at the Swaledale Festival, Yorkshire, in 2012. The first exhibition of his collages was in London in 2010, at the South Kensington and Chelsea Mental Health Centre, curated by the Nightingale Project, a charity that takes music and art into hospitals. Bennett was a patron of this charity. Bennett is honoured with four photographic portraits in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London.

Bennett was gay and in 1995 &quot;Gay Times&quot; nominated him as one of the most influential gay people in music. He was based in New York City from 1979 until his death there in 2012.

Anthony Meredith&#x27;s biography of Bennett was published in November 2010. Bennett is survived by his sister Meg (born 1930), the poet M. R. Peacocke, with whom he collaborated on a number of vocal works.

Bennett&#x27;s cremated remains are buried in Section 112, Plot 45456 at Green-wood Cemetery, Brooklyn. His grave is marked by a grey granite headstone.

==Music==
Despite his early studies in modernist techniques, Bennett&#x27;s tastes were eclectic. He wrote in a wide range of styles, including jazz, for which he had a particular fondness. Early on, he began to write music for feature films. He said that it was as if the different styles of music that he was writing went on &#x27;in different rooms, albeit in the same house&#x27;. Later in his career the different aspects all became equally celebrated – for example in his 75th birthday year (2011), there were numerous concerts featuring all the different strands of his work. At the BBC Proms for example his &quot;Murder on the Orient Express Suite&quot; was performed in a concert of film music, and in the same season his &quot;Dream Dancing&quot; and &quot;Jazz Calendar&quot; were also featured. Also at the Wigmore Hall, London, on 23 March 2011 (a few days before his 75th birthday), a double concert took place in which his Debussy-inspired piece &quot;Sonata After Syrinx&quot; was performed in the first concert, and in the Late Night Jazz Event which followed, Bennett and Claire Martin performed his arrangements of the Great American Songbook (Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hart and so on). See also Tom Service&#x27;s appreciation of Bennett&#x27;s music published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in July 2012.

==Film and television scores==
He wrote music for films and television; among his scores were the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Aztecs&quot; (1964) for television, and the feature films &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; (1967), &quot;Lady Caroline Lamb&quot; (1972) and &quot;Equus&quot; (1977). His scores for &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; (1967), &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; (1971), and &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974), each earned him Academy Award nominations, with &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; gaining a BAFTA award. Later works include &quot;Enchanted April&quot; (1992), &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (1994), &quot;The Tale of Sweeney Todd&quot; (1999) and &quot;Gormenghast&quot; (2000). He was also a prolific composer of orchestral works, piano solos, choral works and operas. Despite this eclecticism, Bennett&#x27;s music rarely involved stylistic crossover.

<text>The Battle of Kinston was fought on December 14, 1862, in Lenoir County, North Carolina, near the town of Kinston, as part of the Goldsborough Expedition of the American Civil War.

A Union expedition led by Brig. Gen. John G. Foster left New Bern in December to disrupt the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad at Goldsborough. The advance was stubbornly contested by Brig. Gen. Nathan Evans&#x27;s brigade near Kinston Bridge on December 14, but the Confederates were outnumbered and withdrew north of the Neuse River in the direction of Goldsborough. Foster continued his movement the next day, taking the River Road, south of the Neuse River.

<text>Vementry (Old Norse: &quot;Vemunðarey&quot;) is an uninhabited Scottish island in Shetland on the north side of the West Mainland, lying south of Muckle Roe.

== Description and history ==
The island is known for its well-preserved chambered cairn. The well-preserved remains of a Neolithic heel-shaped cairn about in diameter and rising to over in height.

Also on the island are two 6-inch QF Mk I First World War gun emplacements which overlook the narrow entrance into the former naval anchorage of Busta Voe on Swarbacks Head, a cliff standing around above sea level. These guns were removed from , an &quot;Edgar&quot;-class cruiser which was acting as a depot ship for 10th Cruiser Squadron. They were manned by a mixed crew of RN sailors and Royal Marines. The guns are mounted en barbette on concrete platforms with a concrete parapet and gun shield to provide protection against incoming fire. There are two ammunition lockers built into the parapet of each gun platform, and each platform is linked to a separate main magazine by a trench. A simple stone-and-concrete fire control pillbox also exists on the site. The guns were abandoned in situ after the end of the First World War and were never used after this time, having now fallen largely into a state of disrepair.

== Mainland and island ==
Vementry is also the name of a small farm on Mainland, Shetland, immediately south of the island. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Isle of Vementry&quot;. There is no ferry service to the island, although the shepherd on the mainland farm occasionally makes the short trip to work with stock on the island.

The Isle of Vementry is separated from the mainland Vementry by a narrow channel or &quot;sound&quot;, consisting of Uyea Sound to the east and Cribba Sound to the west. Cribba Sound is famed for the quality of mussels produced at the mussel farms located there.

<doc id="636901" wikidata="Q338985" url="?curid=636901" title="Conan IV, Duke of Brittany">
<text>Conan IV ( 1138 – 20 February 1171), called the Young, was the Duke of Brittany from 1156 to 1166. He was the son of Bertha, Duchess of Brittany, and her first husband, Alan, Earl of Richmond. Conan IV was his father&#x27;s heir as Earl of Richmond and his mother&#x27;s heir as Duke of Brittany. Conan and his daughter Constance would be the only representatives of the House of Penthièvre to rule Brittany.

==Accession==
Conan was the son of Duchess Bertha by her first husband, Alan, 1st Earl of Richmond. With the death of his mother in early 1156, Conan IV expected to inherit the ducal throne. However, he was denied his inheritance by his stepfather, Odo II, Viscount of Porhoët, who refused to relinquish authority. Odo may have entered into a pact with Conan&#x27;s maternal uncle, Hoel, Count of Nantes, with the goal of dividing Brittany between them. Being under threat of rebellion in Nantes, sponsored by Geoffrey VI, Count of Anjou, Hoel could not send Odo any aid. Within the year Conan IV was able to capture and imprison Odo and claim his inheritance.

Conan also inherited the title Earl of Richmond from his father Alan, which made him subject to both the King of England and the King of France.

== Plantagenet ambitions ==

Henry II of England, the Count of Anjou, attempted to obtain control of the Duchy of Brittany, which neighboured his lands and had traditionally been largely independent from the rest of France, with its own language and culture. The Breton dukes held little power across most of the duchy, which was mostly controlled by local lords. In 1148, Duke Conan III died and civil war broke out. Henry claimed to be the overlord of Brittany, on the basis that the duchy had owed loyalty to Henry I, and saw controlling the duchy both as a way of securing his other French territories and as a potential inheritance for one of his sons. Initially Henry&#x27;s strategy was to rule indirectly through proxies, and accordingly Henry supported Conan IV&#x27;s claims over most of the duchy, partly because Conan had strong English ties and could be easily influenced. Conan&#x27;s uncle, Hoel, continued to control the county of Nantes in the east until he was deposed in 1156 by Henry&#x27;s brother, Geoffrey, possibly with Henry&#x27;s support.

When Geoffrey of Anjou died in 1158, Conan attempted to reclaim Nantes but was opposed by Henry who annexed it for himself. Louis took no action to intervene as Henry steadily increased his power in Brittany. Conan&#x27;s control of Nantes had the effect of reuniting Brittany. Henry II, responded by seizing the Earldom of Richmond, Conan&#x27;s paternal inheritance, and demanded the return of Nantes. Conan and Henry made peace, and in 1160 Conan married Henry&#x27;s cousin Margaret, sister of the Scottish king William the Lion. Conan and Margaret had at least one daughter, Constance. A son of Conan&#x27;s named William appears to have still been alive towards 1200.

== Unrest and abdication ==

Conan faced several revolts from his own nobles, rebellions possibly covertly supported by England. To put down the unrest, the Duke appealed for help to Henry II, who, in return, demanded the betrothal of Constance to Henry&#x27;s younger son Geoffrey.

While local Breton nobles began to rebel against Conan IV, Henry had begun to alter his policy of indirect rule in Brittany and started to exert more direct control. In 1164 Henry intervened to seize lands along the border of Brittany and Normandy, and in 1166 invaded Brittany to punish the local barons. Henry then forced Conan to abdicate as duke and to give Brittany to his daughter Constance; Conan also betrothed Constance to Henry&#x27;s son Geoffrey. This arrangement was quite unusual in terms of medieval law, as Conan might have had sons who could have legitimately inherited the duchy.

According to the histories that record the abdication of Conan IV, he died in 1171 sometime after his abdication.

Henry II had claimed to be Overlord of Brittany, as would his son Richard the Lionheart. Henry never claimed the Dukedom of Brittany. After Conan IV abdicated, Henry II held guardianship over Brittany for Conan&#x27;s daughter Constance, until such time as Henry II&#x27;s fourth legitimate son, Geoffrey Plantagenet, could marry her.

== Portrayals in literature ==
Conan is usually remembered in Breton historiography as a weak ruler, unable to protect his duchy against the powerful Angevin king, although historian Eric Borgnis-Desbordes has recently qualified this opinion.

Conan IV is mentioned in the tragedy &quot;Jean sans Terre ou la mort d&#x27;Arthur&quot; (1791) by Jean-François Ducis, the novels &quot;Time and Chance&quot; (2002), &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; (2005) and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Brood&quot; (2008) by Sharon Kay Penman, and the second volume of the trilogy &quot;Le Château des Poulfenc&quot; (2009) by Brigitte Coppin.
