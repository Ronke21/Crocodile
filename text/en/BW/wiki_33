<text>Maidstone United Football Club is a semi-professional football club based in Maidstone, Kent, England. The team competes in the National League South, the sixth level of the English football league system. The club&#x27;s nickname is &quot;The Stones&quot; and they play in black and amber.

Maidstone United was a member of The Football League between 1989 and 1992. That club was forced out of the league following bankruptcy, but the nucleus of a new club was built around the youth squad, Maidstone Invicta, which made the step up to adult football in 1992 after being elected to the Kent County League Fourth Division in 1993 and subsequently progressed through the non-League pyramid. They changed their name to Maidstone United in 1995. They played in the Isthmian League Premier Division from 2013, having been promoted from the Isthmian League Division One South, and won the league in the 2014–15 season to gain promotion to the National League South (formerly the Conference South) for the 2015–16 season.

Maidstone gained a second successive promotion to the National League in 2016, bringing fifth-tier football back to the town for the first time since the old club was promoted to the Football League in 1989. Maidstone were relegated in 2019, before winning the National League South title in 2022 and promotion back to the National League. However, they could not consolidate this position and were relegated the following season. In 2023–24, Maidstone reached the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time, becoming the first team outside of the top five divisions to reach this stage since 1977–78. Maidstone were without a stadium of their own from their creation until 2012 when the Gallagher Stadium near Maidstone town centre opened at the start of the 2012–13 season.

==History==
===1992–2001: The new club and Kent County League years===
Maidstone Invicta were originally a youth club and were &quot;taken over&quot; within days of the Football League side folding. However, the lack of a suitable ground meant the club was effectively relegated seven divisions to the basement of the footballing pyramid and joined the Fourth Division of the Kent County League for the 1993–94 season. The club&#x27;s home games took place on the reserve and training pitch of the original Maidstone, next to the original London Road Stadium. Initially, Jim Thompson ran the club, but was banned from football for his part in the demise of Maidstone and Dartford, and Paul Bowden-Brown took over as Chairman – a position he retained until 2010.

The newly created Kent County League side was formed with the nucleus of the original club&#x27;s youth team, They had been formed too late to join a league for the 1992–93 season, but, in the 1993–94 season, comfortably won the Fourth Division of the County League under the stewardship of Jack Whitely and Bill Tucker. They also managed to win the West Kent Challenge Shield and the Tunbridge Wells Charity Cup. During the close season of 1994 the club managed to gain promotion to Division 2 of the league after restructuring. The club went on to win Division 2, picking up the Kent Junior Cup on the way. However, the Stones, who had adopted their original name of Maidstone United in 1997, took four years and six managers before finally winning promotion to the Kent County League Premier Division with former Stones player turned manager Jason Lillis leading the club to the Division One title. The 1999–2000 season saw Maidstone&#x27;s début season in the Premier Division, with the team finishing in a respectable third place. The next season saw the club, which was now managed by another former Maidstonian in Matt Toms, successfully apply to become a senior club and finish second in the league. These factors now left the door open to seek elevation to the Kent League (with the County League being a step-7 league and the Kent League being a step-5 league, direct promotion was not possible).

===2001–2006: The Kent League years===

 The club&#x27;s application was accepted and the Stones started the 2001–2002 season in the Kent League. However, the club&#x27;s ground in Maidstone was nowhere near Kent League standards so the Stones agreed to share Sittingbourne&#x27;s Central Park stadium while trying to overcome various legal obstacles in the way of a move to a new ground in the town at James Whatman Way. In its first Kent League season since reformation, Maidstone won the Kent League and Cup double under the management of Jim Ward. However, the club could not gain promotion to the Southern League Eastern Division because of problems with the lease on Central Park. The lease problems were not solved and during the 2002 close season both Sittingbourne and Maidstone moved out of Central Park to a new ground, named Bourne Park, which was built on the same complex using the old training pitch.

The 2002–03 season saw Maidstone enter the FA Cup for the first time since reformation, and the club was featured on BBC Sport&#x27;s &#x27;Road to Cardiff&#x27;. The club reached the 2nd qualifying round of the cup, with the highlight of the run coming in the form of a 3–2 win against old foes Tonbridge Angels, with Steve Butler bagging a hat-trick against the Southern League East outfit. In the league, the Stones looked destined to win a second successive title but after a poor run-in, coupled with the withdrawal from the league of Faversham Town, the club bizarrely lost the championship by 0.14 of a point (the League Management Committee decreed that the title would be awarded to the club with the highest earned points per match average, so with Maidstone and Thamesmead Town achieving 63 points from 30 games, the unusual situation arose that the championship was won by Cray Wanderers with 62 points from 29 games). The Stones did pick up some silverware that season, winning both the Kent Senior Trophy and the Kent Charity Cup, but this was overshadowed by continuing lease problems, which meant another attempt to gain promotion to the Southern League was knocked back.

The years 2003 till 2005 contained two indifferent seasons for the Stones, on the pitch at least. Both campaigns saw the club finish 4th in the league, although this disappointment was offset somewhat by reaching the third qualifying round of the FA Cup in successive years. Off the pitch, the club took a huge step forward when in November 2004 it successfully applied for planning permission to build a new stadium at James Whatman Way. However, construction of the stadium could not begin until a lease for the site was agreed with its owners, the Ministry of Defence. The 2005–06 season saw Maidstone, now managed by Lloyd Hume after a spell in charge from Mal Watkins, win the Kent League title. They spent the season toe-to-toe with Beckenham Town before securing the championship on the final day of the season. The title win meant the club finally gained promotion to Step 4 of the non league pyramid, joining the Isthmian League Division One South. However perhaps more importantly, the club&#x27;s bid to return to Maidstone was another step closer when a 99-year lease was signed for the land at James Whatman Way, meaning the club was now free to start building on it.

===2006–2015: The Isthmian League years===
Maidstone, who were now managed by Lloyd Hume and Alan Walker in a joint capacity, surprisingly managed to win the league at the first time of asking, gaining promotion to the Isthmian League Premier Division. However the overwhelming success on the pitch was overshadowed by little visible progress being made in the building of the stadium at James Whatman Way. Before the 2007–08 season had even begun Alan Walker was involved in a freak accident at a coaching course in Belfast which left him temporarily paralysed. Walker made a valiant recovery however, and was back walking and in management by the start of the league season. Maidstone struggled in the new surroundings of the Isthmian League Premier Division and spent the majority of the season near the foot of the table, despite having the services of Chris Smalling at their disposal, however they avoided relegation after beating Folkestone Invicta 1–0 on the last day of the season, a result that relegated Invicta in Maidstone&#x27;s place. In other news 25% of the club was sold to businessman Oliver Ash in February 2008.

The 2008–09 was another tough season for Maidstone. The squad who came so close to relegation the year before was largely dismantled with a whole raft of new players replacing them. During the close season it had become increasingly apparent the club could not afford to field a competitive Isthmian Premier team and fund the building of a new stadium, so with what limited funds the club had seemingly tied up in paying new players it was decided to try and fund the construction at James Whatman Way by bidding for a £1.2million grant from the Football Foundation. The bid was turned down in October 2008 and the club was subsequently put up for sale by chairman Paul Bowden-Brown. However no takeover was forthcoming and as a result of this the club had no choice but to halve their wage bill from £6000 to £3000 per week. The majority of the players took pay cuts and led Maidstone to their best league finish since reforming, finishing a comfortable 15th in the Isthmian Premier table and reaching the 4th qualifying round of the FA Cup.

During the 2009 close season Maidstone moved from their temporary Bourne Park home in Sittingbourne to Ashford Town&#x27;s stadium, The Homelands, citing lower rent and a deal to receive a percentage of refreshment takings as the reason for the move. However the move only increased Maidstone&#x27;s financial woes due to a sharp drop in attendances, and in December 2009 it was revealed two months of staff pay was to be deferred to the end of the season, a move that led to Alan Walker and Lloyd Hume resigning as managers of the club. Reserve team boss Pete Nott stepped up to the first team managers role and led Maidstone to an 18th-place finish, avoiding relegation with a game to spare.

In October 2010 the club was taken over by shareholder Oliver Ash and Terry Casey with Paul Bowden-Brown stepping down as chairman. In November 2010 the club&#x27;s new directors sacked first team boss Peter Nott and his backroom staff with the team bottom of the table and out of the FA Cup. Former Gravesend &amp; Northfleet manager Andy Ford was swiftly appointed manager, but he could not improve the club&#x27;s fortunes and resigned in March 2011 with the club bottom of the league and 8 points adrift from safety. Club captain Jay Saunders was appointed caretaker manager until the end of the season, and although he oversaw the team to 5 wins from nine games he could not save Maidstone from relegation. Saunders was subsequently given the permanent managers job.

In the 2011 close season the club returned to groundshare at Sittingbourne&#x27;s Bourne Park after their two-year spell at Ashford&#x27;s Homelands Stadium, and soon after construction finally began on the club&#x27;s new ground The Gallagher Stadium. The club finished the season in sixth place, just outside the play-offs. The 2012 close season saw Maidstone finally come home, moving into the Gallagher Stadium in July 2012. The club opened the £2.6 million stadium with a showpiece friendly against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in front of a sell-out crowd. After a two-horse race for the Isthmian League Division One South title with Dulwich Hamlet, and regularly playing in front of crowds of 1,500+, Maidstone eventually won promotion to the Isthmian League Premier Division after beating Faversham Town 3–0 in the Isthmian League Division One South play-off final.

During the 2014–15 season, Maidstone United qualified for the first round proper of the FA Cup for the first time in their history. Maidstone played a goalless draw away to Stevenage of League Two and in the replay at home in front of a capacity crowd went through to the second round proper, winning 2–1. In the second round Maidstone lost 3–1 at Wrexham of the Conference Premier. Maidstone United went on to win the Isthmian Premier title following a season-long battle with Margate, then Dulwich Hamlet and finally Hendon. The title was effectively won at Champion Hill, home of Dulwich Hamlet, on 18 April 2015 with Maidstone United drawing 0–0 and Hendon drawing 0–0 away at Grays Athletic. The near-1,000 travelling Stones fans celebrated on the pitch with the Dulwich Hamlet fans, their best position since reforming. The title was officially won on home soil on 25 April 2015 with a 3–2 win over East Thurrock United.

===2015–present: The National League and FA Cup run===
After winning the Isthmian League Premier Division, Maidstone United were promoted to the National League South (formerly the Conference South). In the 2015–16 season the team again qualified for the first round proper of the FA Cup where they narrowly lost 1–0 at home to League Two side Yeovil Town in front of a record-breaking crowd of 2,811. On 14 May 2016, Maidstone United were promoted to the National League after defeating Ebbsfleet United in the National League South promotion final at Stonebridge Road. The match finished 2–2 after extra time, and Maidstone won 4–3 in the resulting penalty shoot-out.

Maidstone were relegated back to the National League South after three seasons in the National League by finishing in 24th place in 2018–19. In the 2021–22 season, Maidstone won the National League South title. They were unable to consolidate this position and were relegated back to the sixth tier, with five matches remaining. In the 2023–24 season, Maidstone reached the FA Cup fifth round for the first time, and in doing so became the first team outside of the top five divisions to reach the fifth round since Blyth Spartans in 1977–78. Having defeated Football League sides including Barrow and Stevenage, the Stones subsequently won 2–1 away to Ipswich Town in the fourth round. In the fifth round, Maidstone lost 5–0 away to Coventry City backed by 4,800 away supporters.

==Shirts, colours and badge==
Since reformation Maidstone&#x27;s home shirts have been amber with black trim. All white was the template used for away shirts, but from 2009 to 2013 the club wore sky blue. They returned to a white away kit in the summer of 2013. In 2017, the away kit was changed to purple shirt, shorts and socks, with a white trim around the sleeves.

===Shirt manufacturers and sponsors===

==Stadiums==
Maidstone United play their home games at The Gallagher Stadium, James Whatman Way, Maidstone, Kent, ME14 1LQ. After the original club folded, the new Maidstone United played their games on a pitch behind a Mormon meeting house, which had originally been the MUFC reserves and training pitch – just metres from where the old ground had been. Promotion to the Kent League in 2001 meant the club had to move away yet again as the current ground was nowhere near up to standard.

The club had earmarked James Whatman Way as the site of a new ground in Maidstone, but until this was built they would have to groundshare outside the town. Maidstone played for a year at Sittingbourne&#x27;s old Central Park stadium before relocating, along with the &quot;Brickies&quot;, to Bourne Park, a converted training pitch behind the main Central Park complex. Unable to generate the funds to build at Whatman Way, The Stones stayed at Bourne Park until 2009, before moving to groundshare with Ashford Town, citing favourable rent and a cut of food and bar takings as the reason for the move. The move to Ashford caused a sharp dip in attendances and the club returned to ground share at Bourne Park for the 2011–12 season; however the club finally moved into James Whatman Way, known as the Gallagher Stadium, at the start of the 2012–13 season.

==Support==
Maidstone returned to their home town and home crowds surged by 350% to average 1,698 in the league during the 2012–13 season at the club&#x27;s new Gallagher Stadium. The table below gives a summary of the attendance figures in all of Maidstone United&#x27;s league games since the club&#x27;s final season in the Kent County League in the 2000–01 season.

No attendances were recorded for Season 2020–21, due to COVID-19 restrictions.

===Rivalries===
Maidstone fans have traditionally had a strong rivalry with Gillingham. The old Maidstone are the only traditional Kent club to ever join Gillingham in the Football League, and contested a total of 11 games with Gillingham in the old Division 4 and FA Cup in the 1980s and early 1990s. There have been only three matches since the Stones reformed, the first being a mid-season friendly in 2002 at Central Park, the second being a Kent Senior Cup quarter final tie in 2018, where Maidstone won 2–1, and the third once again in the Kent Senior Cup second round in 2023, where Maidstone won 2–0.

A rivalry also remains with Tonbridge Angels. Back in the 1970s, the old Maidstone United and the &#x27;Angels&#x27; regularly met in the Southern League before Maidstone moved on to become founder members of the National League (then known as the Alliance Premier League). The two clubs were reconciled after Maidstone&#x27;s reformation, meeting in the 2002–03 FA Cup – with the Stones winning 3–2. The clubs then met regularly in the Isthmian League Premier Division between 2007 and 2011 and again in the 2014–15 season. In January 2015, there was a &quot;confrontation&quot; between Tonbridge Angels coach Barry Moore and a Maidstone supporter after a game between the sides. Moore was banned by the FA for four months following the incident. Old Southern League foes Ebbsfleet United (then Gravesend &amp; Northfleet) have perhaps become the club&#x27;s biggest current-day rivals, with the clubs&#x27; recent time together in the National League and National League South punctuated by ill-will both at boardroom level and on the terraces.

===Fan culture===
Stones Live! is a radio station run since 2008, offering commentary from most matches plus other club-related content. It was voted Sports Station of the Year at the 2010–11 Internet Radio Awards. A fanzine site “Plastic Passion” was launched in February 2014, in part to celebrate one of the most successful eras in the club&#x27;s history. Plastic Passion spawned a spin off book, believed to be the first ever Maidstone United e-book, “When I was Just A Little Boy” in 2016. A second book, this time available in physical form, &quot;Exodus&quot; was published in December 2016, detailing the period between 1988 and 2012 and the struggle to find a permanent home.

The Football League era saw the birth of four fanzines, &quot;Show Me The Way To Go Home&quot;, &quot;Spirit of London Road (aka S.O.L.D)&quot;, &quot;Yellow Fever&quot;, later renamed &quot;Golden Days&quot;, and &quot;The Foundation Stone&quot; which ran for just a couple of issues. In 2000, with the club languishing in the Kent County League, a fanzine known as “SHAFTED!” ran for five issues. By the time the club returned to the Kent League in 2001 the team behind Show Me The Way To Go Home decided to revive it after almost ten years. It ran for several seasons and was highly acclaimed. In 2005 it was named as one of the best 11 fanzines in the country by the Independent, although it had ceased publication before the club returned to Maidstone in 2012. The void was eventually filled by &quot;It&#x27;s All Gone Amber&quot;, which was first published in 2015. It was named after the line uttered by commentator Derek Rae when Frannie Collin scored the winner for Maidstone against Stevenage in an FA Cup first round replay in 2014.

Maidstone&#x27;s youth and community sides are currently members of the Isthmian Youth League and Kent Youth League as well as being members of various local, women&#x27;s/girls&#x27;, deaf and disability leagues.

The club also runs an academy, giving over fifty 16 to 18-year-old players the chance to study, train and play at the Gallagher Stadium. Players study for a BTEC Level 3 in Sport and a range of vocational football-related qualifications, and also play in the Conference Youth Alliance.

Maidstone&#x27;s youth teams have provided many players to the first team in recent years. The most successful and high-profile product of the club&#x27;s youth system is England international Chris Smalling, who spent three years at the club before moving to Fulham and subsequently to Manchester United and AS Roma. Smalling made a total of 16 appearances for Maidstone, and whilst playing for the club he also played for England Schoolboys&#x27; Under 18 side.

The club has a strong emphasis on football for the community and most of its teams train at the Gallagher Stadium.

<doc id="641334" wikidata="Q743231" url="?curid=641334" title="Sodium-vapor lamp">
<text>A sodium-vapor lamp is a gas-discharge lamp that uses sodium in an excited state to produce light at a characteristic wavelength near 589 nm.

Two varieties of such lamps exist: low pressure, and high pressure. Low-pressure sodium lamps are highly efficient electrical light sources, but their yellow light restricts applications to outdoor lighting, such as street lamps, where they are widely used. High-pressure sodium lamps emit a broader spectrum of light than the low-pressure lamps, but they still have poorer color rendering than other types of lamps. Low-pressure sodium lamps give only monochromatic yellow light, inhibiting color vision at night.

Single ended self-starting lamps are insulated with a mica disc and contained in a borosilicate glass gas discharge tube (arc tube) with a metal cap. They include the sodium-vapor lamp that is the gas-discharge lamp used in street lighting.

==Development==
The low-pressure sodium arc discharge lamp was first made practical around 1920 owing to the development of a type of glass that could resist the corrosive effects of sodium vapor. These operated at pressures of less than 1 Pa and produced a near monochromatic light spectrum around the sodium emission lines at 589.0 and 589.56 nanometres wavelength. The yellow light produced by these limited the range of applications to those where color vision was not required.

Research into high-pressure sodium lamps occurred in both the United Kingdom and the United States. Increasing the pressure of the sodium vapor broadened the sodium emission spectrum so that the light produced had more energy emitted at wavelengths above and below the 589 nm region. The quartz material used in mercury discharge lamps was corroded by high pressure sodium vapor. A laboratory demonstration of a high pressure lamp was carried out in 1959. The development by General Electric of a sintered aluminum oxide material (with magnesium oxide added to improve light transmission) was an important step in construction of a commercial lamp. The material was available in the form of tubing by 1962, but additional techniques were required to seal the tubes and add the necessary electrodes—the material could not be fused like quartz. The end caps of the arc tube would get as hot as in operation, then cool to room temperature when the lamp was turned off, so the electrode terminations and arc tube seal had to tolerate repeated temperature cycles. This problem was solved by Michael Arendash at the GE Nela Park plant. The first commercial high-pressure sodium lamps were available in 1965 from companies in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands; at introduction a 400 watt lamp would produce around 100 lumens per watt.

Single-crystal artificial sapphire tubes were also manufactured and used for HPS lamps in the early 1970s, with a slight improvement in efficacy, but production costs were higher than for polycrystalline alumina tubes.

== Low-pressure sodium ==


Low-pressure sodium (LPS) lamps have a borosilicate glass gas discharge tube (arc tube) containing solid sodium and a small amount of neon and argon gas in a Penning mixture to start the gas discharge. The discharge tube may be linear (SLI lamp) or U-shaped. When the lamp is first started, it emits a dim red/pink light to warm the sodium metal; within a few minutes as the sodium metal vaporizes, the emission becomes the common bright yellow. These lamps produce a virtually monochromatic light averaging a 589.3 nm wavelength (actually two dominant spectral lines very close together at 589.0 and 589.6 nm). The colors of objects illuminated by only this narrow bandwidth are difficult to distinguish.

LPS lamps have an outer glass vacuum envelope around the inner discharge tube for thermal insulation, which improves their efficiency. Earlier LPS lamps had a detachable dewar jacket (SO lamps). Lamps with a permanent vacuum envelope (SOI lamps) were developed to improve thermal insulation. Further improvement was attained by coating the glass envelope with an infrared reflecting layer of indium tin oxide, resulting in SOX lamps.

LPS lamps are among the most efficient electrical light sources when measured in photopic lighting conditions, producing above 100 and up to 206 lm/W. This high efficiency is partly due to the light emitted being at a wavelength near the peak sensitivity of the human eye. They are used mainly for outdoor lighting (such as street lights and security lighting) where faithful color rendition is not important.

LPS lamps are similar to fluorescent lamps in that they are a low-intensity light source with a linear lamp shape. They do not exhibit a bright arc as do high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps; they emit a softer luminous glow, resulting in less glare. Unlike HID lamps, during a voltage dip low-pressure sodium lamps return to full brightness rapidly. LPS lamps are available with power ratings from 10 to 180 W; longer lamp lengths can, however, suffer design and engineering problems.

Modern LPS lamps have a service life of about 18,000 hours and do not decline in lumen output with age, though they do increase in energy consumption by about 10% towards end of life. This property contrasts with mercury vapor HID lamps, which become dimmer towards the end of life to the point of being ineffective, while consuming undiminished electrical power.

In 2017 Philips Lighting, the last manufacturer of LPS lamps, announced they were discontinuing production of the lamps due to falling demand. Initially, production was due to be phased out in the course of 2020, but this date was brought forward and the last lamps were produced at the Hamilton, Scotland factory on December31, 2019.

===Light pollution considerations===
For locations where light pollution is a consideration, such as near astronomical observatories or sea turtle nesting beaches, low-pressure sodium is preferred (as formerly in San Jose, California and Flagstaff, Arizona). Such lamps emit light on just two dominant spectral lines (with other much weaker lines), and therefore have the least spectral interference with astronomical observation. (Now that production of LPS lamps has ceased, consideration is being given into the use of narrow-band amber LEDs, which are on a similar color spectrum to LPS.) The yellow color of low-pressure sodium lamps also leads to the least visual sky glow, due primarily to the Purkinje shift of dark-adapted human vision, causing the eye to be relatively insensitive to the yellow light scattered at low luminance levels in the clear atmosphere. One consequence of widespread public lighting is that on cloudy nights, cities with enough lighting are illuminated by light reflected off the clouds. Where sodium vapor lights are the source of urban illumination, the night sky is tinged with orange.

===Film special effects===
Sodium vapor process (occasionally referred to as yellowscreen) is a film technique that relies on narrowband characteristics of LPS lamp. Color negative film typically is insensitive to the yellow light of an LPS lamp, but special black-and-white film is able to record it. Using a special camera, scenes are recorded on two spools simultaneously: one with actors (or other foreground objects), and another that becomes a mask for later combination with a different background. This technique originally yielded results superior to blue-screen technology, and was used in years 1956 to 1990, mostly by Disney Studios. Notable examples of films using this technique include Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot; and the Disney films &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot;. Later advancements in blue- and green-screen techniques and computer imagery closed that gap, leaving SVP economically impractical.

==High-pressure sodium==



High-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps have been widely used in industrial lighting, especially in large manufacturing facilities, and are commonly used as plant grow lights. They contain mercury. They have also been widely used for outdoor area lighting, such as on roadways, parking lots, and security areas. Understanding the change in human color vision sensitivity from photopic to mesopic and scotopic is essential for proper planning when designing lighting for roadways.

High-pressure sodium lamps are quite efficient—about 100 lumens per watt, when measured for photopic lighting conditions. Some higher-power lamps (e.g. 600 watt) have efficacies of about 150 lumens per watt.

Since the high-pressure sodium arc is extremely chemically reactive, the arc tube is typically made of translucent aluminum oxide. This construction led the General Electric Company to use the tradename &quot;Lucalox&quot; for its line of high-pressure sodium lamps.

Xenon at a low pressure is used as a &quot;starter gas&quot; in the HPS lamp. It has the lowest thermal conductivity and lowest ionization potential of all the stable noble gases. As a noble gas, it does not interfere with the chemical reactions occurring in the operating lamp. The low thermal conductivity minimizes thermal losses in the lamp while in the operating state, and the low ionization potential causes the breakdown voltage of the gas to be relatively low in the cold state, which allows the lamp to be easily started.

===&quot;White&quot; high pressure sodium lamp===
A variation of the high-pressure sodium introduced in 1986, the White HPS has a higher pressure than the typical HPS lamp, producing a color temperature of around 2700 kelvins with a color rendering index (CRI) of about 85, greatly resembling the color of an incandescent light. These lamps are often used indoors in cafes and restaurants for aesthetic effect. However, white HPS lamps have higher cost, shorter service lives, and lower light efficiency, and so they cannot compete with HPS at this time.

==== Electrical parameters of white sodium lamps ====

=== Theory of operation ===


An amalgam of metallic sodium and mercury lies at the coolest part of the lamp and provides the sodium and mercury vapor that is needed to draw an arc. The temperature of the amalgam is determined to a great extent by lamp power. The higher the lamp power, the higher will be the amalgam temperature. The higher the temperature of the amalgam, the higher will be the mercury and sodium vapor pressures in the lamp and the higher will be the terminal voltage. As the temperature rises, the constant current and increasing voltage consumes increasing energy until the operating level of power is reached. For a given voltage, there are generally three modes of operation:

# The lamp is extinguished and no current flows.
# The lamp is operating with liquid amalgam in the tube.
# The lamp is operating with all amalgam evaporated.

The first and last states are stable, because the lamp resistance is weakly related to the voltage, but the second state is unstable. Any anomalous increase in current will cause an increase in power, causing an increase in amalgam temperature, which will cause a decrease in resistance, which will cause a further increase in current. This will create a runaway effect, and the lamp will jump to the high-current state (#3). Because actual lamps are not designed to handle this much power, this would result in catastrophic failure. Similarly, an anomalous drop in current will drive the lamp to extinction. It is the second state that is the desired operating state of the lamp, because a slow loss of the amalgam over time from a reservoir will have less effect on the characteristics of the lamp than a fully evaporated amalgam. The result is an average lamp life in excess of 20,000 hours.

In practical use, the lamp is powered by an AC voltage source in series with an inductive &quot;ballast&quot; in order to supply a nearly constant current to the lamp, rather than a constant voltage, thus assuring stable operation. The ballast is usually inductive rather than simply being resistive to minimize energy waste from resistance losses. Because the lamp effectively extinguishes at each zero-current point in the AC cycle, the inductive ballast assists in the reignition by providing a voltage spike at the zero-current point.

The light from the lamp consists of atomic emission lines of mercury and sodium, but is dominated by the sodium D-line emission. This line is extremely pressure (resonance) broadened and is also self-reversed because of absorption in the cooler outer layers of the arc, giving the lamp its improved color rendering characteristics. In addition, the red wing of the D-line emission is further pressure broadened by the Van der Waals forces from the mercury atoms in the arc.

=== Electrical parameters ===

== End of life ==

At end of life, high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps exhibit a phenomenon known as &quot;cycling&quot;, caused by a loss of sodium in the arc. Sodium is a highly reactive element and is lost in a reaction with the aluminum oxide of the arc tube. The products are sodium oxide and aluminum:

:6 Na + Al2O3 → 3 Na2O + 2 Al

As a result, these lamps can be started at a relatively low voltage, but, as they heat up during operation, the internal gas pressure within the arc tube rises, and more and more voltage is required to maintain the arc discharge. As a lamp gets older, the maintaining voltage for the arc eventually rises to exceed the maximum voltage output by the electrical ballast. As the lamp heats to this point, the arc fails, and the lamp goes out. Eventually, with the arc extinguished, the lamp cools down again, the gas pressure in the arc tube is reduced, and the ballast can once again cause the arc to strike. The effect of this is that the lamp glows for a while and then goes out, typically starting at a pure or bluish white then moving to a red-orange before going out.

More sophisticated ignitor designs detect cycling and give up attempting to start the lamp after a few cycles, as the repeated high-voltage ignitions needed to restart the arc reduce the lifetime of the ballast or the ignitor, depending on the ignitor configuration. If power is removed and reapplied, the ballast will make a new series of startup attempts.

LPS lamp failure does not result in cycling; rather, the lamp will simply not strike or will maintain the dull red glow of the start-up phase. In another failure mode, a tiny puncture of the arc tube leaks some of the sodium vapor into the outer vacuum bulb. The sodium condenses and creates a mirror on the outer glass, partially obscuring the arc tube. The lamp often continues operating normally, but much of the light generated is obscured by the sodium coating, providing no illumination.

<text>The Ashton Canal is a canal in Greater Manchester, England, linking Manchester with Ashton-under-Lyne in Tameside.

==Route==

The Ashton leaves the Rochdale Canal at Ducie St. Junction in central Manchester, and climbs for through 18 locks, passing through Ancoats, Holt Town, Bradford, Clayton, Openshaw, Droylsden, Fairfield and Audenshaw to make a head-on junction with the Huddersfield Narrow Canal (formerly the Huddersfield Canal) at Whitelands Basin in the centre of Ashton-under-Lyne. At Bradford, the canal passes very close to the City of Manchester Stadium (currently known as the Etihad Stadium for sponsorship reasons), which was originally built to host the 2002 Commonwealth Games.

Apart from the Rochdale and Huddersfield Narrow canals, the Ashton Canal only currently connects with one other canal. Just short of Whitelands, at Dukinfield Junction/Portland Basin a short arm crosses the river Tame on the Tame Aqueduct, and makes a head-on junction with the Peak Forest Canal.

There used to be four other important connections to branch canals: the Islington Branch Canal in Ancoats; the Stockport Branch Canal from Clayton to Stockport (Heaton Norris); the Hollinwood Branch Canal from Fairfield to Hollinwood; and the Fairbottom Branch Canal (itself a branch of the Hollinwood Branch Canal) from Waterhouses to Fairbottom. There was to have been a fifth branch, namely the Beat Bank Branch Canal (itself a branch of Stockport Branch Canal) from Reddish to Beat Bank in Denton, but this was abandoned before completion.

Many of the canal locks are now listed buildings.

==History==

The canal received its act of Parliament, the (32 Geo. 3. c. 84) in 1792. It was built to supply coal from Oldham and Ashton under Lyne to Manchester. The first section between Ancoats Lane to Ashton-under-Lyne and Hollinwood was completed in 1796, followed by the lines to Heaton Norris and Fairbottom in 1797. Although there were plans to link it to the Rochdale Canal, it opened as an isolated waterway.

Benjamin Outram was retained to complete the final section between Ancoats Lane and the Rochdale Canal including the Piccadilly Basin. It included the unique Store Street Aqueduct, built on a 45 degree skew and believed to be the first major such structure in Britain and the oldest still in use today.

The section was completed by 1798, but the necessary extension by the Rochdale proprietors to the Bridgewater Canal was not built until 1800. Although the Huddersfield Narrow Canal was open as far as Woolroad by 1798, neither it, nor the Peak Forest Canal were complete. In fact it was another ten years before the former connected to Yorkshire and the east coast.

With little but local trade in its early years, the canal struggled financially and a dividend was not paid until 1806.

It then prospered until competition from railways, and later road transport, greatly diminished traffic, and through traffic had ended by 1945. Traffic on the branches ended in the 1930s. Following nationalisation in 1947–48, traffic did not revive, and all traffic had ceased by 1958, after which maintenance was run down. By 1961, combined with vandalism, the canal had become unnavigable, and its retention for pleasure use seemed unlikely.

The Ashton Canal was one of seven stretches of canal, formerly designated as remainder waterways, that were re-classified by the British Waterways Act 1983 (c. ii) of 8 February 1983. Under the act, a total of of canal were upgraded to Cruising Waterway Standard.

In October 2021, lock numbers 13 and 15 were one of 142 sites across England to receive part of a £35-million injection into the government&#x27;s Culture Recovery Fund.

==Leisure use==
Pressure from the Inland Waterways Association, combined with the formation of the Peak Forest Canal Society, led to a campaign to reopen the Ashton, with the major organised volunteer clearance of the section though Droylsden in September 1968, known as Operation Ashton. Further campaigning, and the growth of local authority support, led to its restoration, along with the adjacent lower Peak Forest Canal, and reopening on 1 April 1974.

The restoration of these two canals opened up the Cheshire Ring, an immediately (and still) popular one-week leisure cruise circling much of east Cheshire. With the opening of the Southern Pennine canals, the Ashton is now also part of the South Pennine Ring (Rochdale and Huddersfield Narrow) and the longest Pennine Ring of all (Outer Pennine Ring - Leeds &amp; Liverpool and Huddersfield Narrow).

It used to be common to hear reports of unfortunate incidents along the Ashton, such as thefts from boats and intimidating, or at least unnerving, behaviour on the part of some local youths and children. This, for a time, caused boats to go through in convoys. Today the Ashton Canal is increasingly valued by the communities through which it passes, and although many boaters still advise others to cover the Ashton during early hours, and not in school holidays, reports of problems often turn out to be the repeated telling of old stories. However, incidents do still occur, as in August 2014 when a number of boats were attacked by hooded youths.

The locks are renowned for debris (shopping trolleys, wheely bins, rocks etc.) which can result in blocked lock gates, but Canal &amp; River Trust workers are soon on site to clear any reported incidents. Portland Basin is a good overnight mooring after ascending the Ashton locks, for those who do not wish to proceed beyond Romiley.

There are current campaigns to restore the Hollinwood Branch and Stockport Branches.

==Listed structures==
The following structures along the canal are Grade II listed:
*Lock numbers 1–3, 6–15 &amp; 18
*Bridges numbers 4, 5, 9 &amp; 16
*Lock Keepers Cottages at lock numbers 2 &amp; 7
*Towpath Bridge over junction with Islington Branch Canal
*Towpath Bridge over junction with Stockport Branch Canal
*Former Packet Boathouse adjacent to bridge number 16
*Former Tollhouse adjacent to lock number 18 (Fairfield Top Lock)
*Mill Building on south bank east of Hope Works

<text>Georg Stiernhielm (August 7, 1598 – April 22, 1672) was a Swedish civil servant, mathematician, linguist and poet. He has been called &quot;the father of the Swedish skald art&quot;.

Stiernhielm&#x27;s most famous poetic work is the first poem in the Musæ Suethizantes, the Hercules composed in hexameter, with names and fables borrowed from the ancient Greeks.

== Early life and education ==
Stiernhielm was born on the family estate Gammelgården in the village Svartskär in Vika parish in Dalarna where his father, Olof Markvardsson, of the noble mining family Stierna, was a miner and bailiff. The surname Stiernhielm, literally &quot;Star Helmet&quot;, was taken in later life when he was raised into the Swedish nobility. He grew up in the Bergslagen region where his father worked with the mining industry. Stiernhielm received his first schooling at Västerås, but he was also educated in Germany and the Netherlands.

After completing his studies in Germany, including at the University of Greifswald, he returned to Uppsala in 1624. The very following year he traveled again to Germany, as a tutor for a young Gyllenhielm, and also visited Italy, France, the Netherlands and England. 

== Career ==
In 1626 he was called by Bishop Johannes Rudbeckius to be a lecturer at the high school in Västerås, and shortly afterwards he was appointed by King Gustavus Adolphus as &quot;reading master for the Riddarhuset&quot; in the then Collegium illustre.

In 1630 he was appointed assessor in Tartu&#x27;s Court of Appeal. He was ennobled in 1631 with the name Stiernhielm and was granted Stjernlund&#x27;s and Vasula&#x27;s estates in Livonia. From 1639 he became a county councilor in Livonia.

In 1641 he was appointed deputy governor of Tartu in place of the ill Fabian Wrangel. On July 13, 1641, Stiernhielm met two of Wrangel&#x27;s sons at a baby baptism, with whom he already had an affair. A quarrel ensued, and the heavily intoxicated Stiernhielm decided to exact revenge with sword in hand, and in the ensuing fight received a very severe cut on the right arm. He was bedridden for a long time, and suffered such permanent pain from the injury that after recovery he was forced to write with his left hand.

He was called to Stockholm in 1642 to participate in the law commission that had been appointed. He stayed several years in the capital, attracted attention for his talent and knowledge, and also gained high favor with Queen Kristina for his poems.

In 1648, he was appointed vice president of Tartu&#x27;s court of appeals, but had barely taken up this position before he was recalled to Stockholm to become national antiquary. Along the way, the ship he was traveling in was wrecked; he survived but it was a completely destitute man who finally arrived in the capital. He was received with great favor by the queen. He took up the position of national archivist in 1649, and was much appreciated at court for his poems, ballets and &quot;pranks&quot;.

However, it did not take long before he fell out of favor, when he spoke in negative terms about one of the queen&#x27;s favourites. He therefore returned to Livonia, but the Russian war in 1656 forced him from there as well. With his wife and children, he thus came back to Stockholm and struggled along with great difficulty until 1658, when he was appointed by Charles X Gustav as county judge in the county of Trondheim, which had been ceded to Sweden. But when this county was lost again in 1660, Stiernhjelm was again without work, until in 1661 he was called to the council of war and the following year to a member of the Reduktionskollegium, a position he however declined.

After the establishment of the College of Antiquities, he was appointed its first governor in 1667 and as such saw his old age secured against the financial worries that followed him throughout his life. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in December 1669.

He was married to Cecilia Burea, Johannes Bureu&#x27;s niece.

== Death ==
He died in Stockholm on 22 April 1672. After his death there were disputes between the heirs. The funeral took place in June 1674. His remains were for 16 years in Klara church in Stockholm and were then taken to Sånga church. In 1799 the coffin was taken up and placed in the material shed. It was stolen from there in 1835. In 1791, the Swedish Academy awarded him a medal. On his tombstone is written &quot;Vixit, dum vixit, laetus.&quot;, which means: &quot;He lived happily, as long as he lived.&quot;

==Works==
He was a pioneer of linguistics, and even if many of his conclusions later proved wrong they were accepted by his contemporaries. Stiernhielm tried to prove that Gothic, which he equated with Old Norse was the origin of all languages, and that the Nordic countries were &quot;vagina gentium&quot;, the human birthplace.

His most famous work is &quot;Hercules&quot;, an epic poem in hexameter, about how Hercules in his youth is being tempted by &quot;Fru Lusta&quot; (&quot;Mrs. Lust&quot;) and her daughters to choose an immoral lifestyle for his future. The allegory, known as Hercules at the crossroads, can be traced back to the Athenian sophist Prodicus of Ceos, as preserved in Xenophon.

Stiernhielm was the first Swedish poet to apply the verse meters of antique poets to the Swedish language, modifying their principle of long and short syllables to a principle of stressed and unstressed syllables, which better suits the phonology of Swedish, using ideas first developed by Martin Opitz and later theoretically applied to Swedish by Andreas Arvidi. This made him known as &quot;the father of Swedish poetry&quot;. His &quot;Musæ Suethizantes&quot; of 1668 is held to be the first important Swedish book of poetry.

<doc id="641346" wikidata="Q198422" url="?curid=641346" title="Kerama Islands">
<text>The are a subtropical island group southwest of Okinawa Island in Japan.

==Geography==
Four islands are inhabited: Tokashiki Island, Zamami Island, Aka Island, and Geruma Island. The islands are administered as Tokashiki Village and Zamami Village within Shimajiri District. The Kerama-shotō coral reef is a Ramsar Site.

The archipelago consists of the following islands (-jima/-shima) – inhabited ones are highlighted in blue – and rocks (other suffixes, unnamed entries) with an area of at least 0.01 km2.

===Beaches===
These are notable beaches of the Kerama Islands:


==Flora==
The archipelago has several extensive coral reefs. Two of them were designated as Ramsar sites in November 2005: a 120-hectare area along the west coast of Tokashiki-jima and around Hanari-jima, and a 233-hectare area around Ijakaja-jima, Gahi-jima and Agenashiku-jima , i.e., between Aka Island and Zamami Island. These reefs are home to 248 different coral species, most notably of the &quot;Acropora&quot; genus. On March 5, 2014, the waters and the islands were placed under protection as Kerama Shotō National Park.

==Fauna==
The islands of Aka, Fukaji, Geruma and Yakabi provide the sole natural habitat of the endangered Kerama deer (&quot;Cervus nippon keramae&quot;), thought to be an introduced population of the Japanese sika deer in the early 17th century that has since adapted to their island environment.

==History==
The Kerama islands were historically part of the Ryukyu Kingdom (1429–1879), when islanders were employed as navigators on the kingdom’s trading vessels to China.

During World War II and preliminary to the Battle of Okinawa, soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division landed in the Kerama Islands on March 26, 1945. Further landings followed, and the Kerama group was secured over the next five days. Kerama was used as a staging area for the assault on Okinawa. During the battle the first civilian mass suicides that later marked the Battle of Okinawa took place. The first US Navy ship to anchor in the harbor was , a small &quot;jeep&quot; carrier.

Thereafter, the archipelago, like the rest of the Ryukyu Islands, was under US military administration before being returned to Japan in 1972.

The Kerama islands was the site of a true story about romance between two dogs who lived on neighboring islands that was made into the 1988 Japanese film &quot;I Want to See Marilyn&quot; (Marilyn ni Aitai). It is now a popular beach and diving destination for visitors to Okinawa.

==Transportation==
The Kerama Islands are served by the Kerama Airport, located on Fukaji Island. Regular ferries are also available from Naha to the three largest islands, Aka, Zamami, and Tokashiki. Ferries between the islands are also available, as are boat tours.

<text>Achilles ( ) is a ghost town in Rawlins County, Kansas, United States, on Sappa Creek, about fifteen miles southeast of Atwood.

==History==
Its heyday began in the 1870s and ended in roughly 1915 when the railroad bypassed Achilles and with more use of the automobile, Achilles declined. Most of the businesses were defunct by the mid- to late-1930s. There was a legendary incident on April 24, 1875 referred to as the &quot;battle of Achilles&quot; that was a fight between a band of 20 hunters and some Indians at a water hole about five miles south of the village.

A post office was opened in Achilles in 1879, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1951. The money order post office was connected by stage at one point with Colby, where it received a daily mail. The population was 70 in 1910, and was a principal trading point in the southwestern part of the county.

Over the years business in Achilles supported two general stores, including Hill General Store; a variety store; a blacksmith shop; a barbershop; a mechanics garage; and a creamery. These were lined along Main Street. These buildings are all gone. The blacksmith shop burned in 1922, and the hardware store was moved into Atwood and is used now for an antique shop. Several buildings were either moved or the wood was sold from the buildings. In about 1999 the last skeletal frame of a general store was burned, erasing all signs of Main Street. Now &quot;Main Street&quot; is part family garden, crop field, weeds, and overgrowth.

There were two houses actually in Achilles: Pearl (Hill) and Frank Bacon home and the Fields house. The Fields house remains; the Bacon home was moved. Off of Main Street stood a Methodist church, later moved to Atwood and used for a home. Also off Main Street stood the Achilles one-room schoolhouse, which is still standing and used for community events. Nearby Achilles Cemetery acknowledges many of the pioneers who settled the area.

In 1993 Achilles was still marked on Kansas State maps, but by 2001 it was no longer acknowledged on newly published maps.

<doc id="641373" wikidata="Q188586" url="?curid=641373" title="Kingdom of Sicily">
<text>The Kingdom of Sicily (; ; ) was a state that existed in Sicily and the southern Italian Peninsula plus, for a time, in Northern Africa from its founding by Roger II of Sicily in 1130 until 1816. It was a successor state of the County of Sicily, which had been founded in 1071 during the Norman conquest of the southern peninsula. The island was divided into three regions: Val di Mazara, Val Demone and Val di Noto.

After a brief rule by Charles of Anjou, a revolt in 1282 known as the Sicilian Vespers threw off Angevin rule in the island of Sicily. The Angevins managed to maintain control in the mainland part of the kingdom, which became a separate entity also styled &quot;Kingdom of Sicily&quot;, although it is retroactively referred to as the Kingdom of Naples, after its capital. From 1282 to 1409, the island was ruled by the Crown of Aragon as an independent kingdom, and was then added permanently to the Crown. Following the dynastic union of Castile and Aragon in 1479, it was a viceroyalty of the Spanish kingdom. During the war of the Spanish succession (1700–1714), the island was taken over by the House of Savoy. In 1720, Savoy gave it to Austria in exchange for Sardinia. Later, the island was ruled by a branch of the Bourbons. Following the Napoleonic period, the Kingdom of Sicily was formally merged with the Kingdom of Naples to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, which in 1861 became part of the new unified Kingdom of Italy.

== History ==
=== Norman conquest ===

By the 11th century, mainland southern Lombard and Byzantine powers were hiring Norman mercenaries, who were descendants of Vikings in northern France; it was the Normans under Roger I who conquered Sicily, taking it away from the Sicilian Muslims. After taking Apulia and Calabria, Roger occupied Messina with an army of 700 knights. In 1068, Roger I of Sicily and his men defeated the Muslims at Misilmeri but the most crucial battle was the Siege of Palermo, which led to Sicily being completely under Norman control by 1091.

=== Norman kingdom (1130–1198) ===
The Norman Kingdom was created on Christmas Day, 1130, by Roger II of Sicily, with the agreement of Pope Innocent II. Roger II united the lands he had inherited from his father, Roger I of Sicily. These areas included the Maltese Archipelago, which was conquered from the Arabs of the Emirates of Sicily; the Duchy of Apulia and the County of Sicily, which had belonged to his cousin William II, Duke of Apulia, until William&#x27;s death in 1127; and the other Norman vassals. Roger declared his support for the Antipope Anacletus II, who enthroned him as King of Sicily on Christmas Day 1130.

In 1136, the rival of Anacletus, Pope Innocent II, convinced Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor to attack the Kingdom of Sicily with help from the Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus. Two main armies, one led by Lothair, the other by Henry X, Duke of Bavaria, invaded Sicily. On the River Tronto, William of Loritello surrendered to Lothair and opened the gates of Termoli to him. This was followed by Count Hugh II of Molise. The two armies were united at Bari, from where in 1137 they continued their campaign. Roger offered to give Apulia as a fief to the Empire, which Lothair refused after being pressured by Innocent. At the same period, the army of Lothair revolted.

Lothair, who had hoped for the complete conquest of Sicily, then gave Capua and Apulia from the Kingdom of Sicily to Roger&#x27;s enemies. Innocent protested, claiming that Apulia fell under Papal claims. Lothair turned north, but died while crossing the Alps on 4 December 1137. At the Second Council of the Lateran in April 1139, Innocent excommunicated Roger for maintaining a schismatic attitude. On 22 March 1139, at Galluccio, Roger&#x27;s son Roger III, Duke of Apulia, ambushed the Papal troops with a thousand knights and captured the pope. On 25 March 1139, Innocent was forced to acknowledge the kingship and possessions of Roger with the Treaty of Mignano.

Roger spent most of the decade, beginning with his coronation and ending with the Assizes of Ariano, enacting a series of laws with which Roger intended to centralise the government. He also fended off several invasions and quelled rebellions by his premier vassals: Grimoald of Bari, Robert II of Capua, Ranulf of Alife, Sergius VII of Naples and others.

It was through his admiral George of Antioch that Roger then conquered the littoral of Ifriqiya from the Zirids, taking the unofficial title &quot;King of Africa&quot; and marking the foundation of the Norman Kingdom of Africa. At the same time, Roger&#x27;s fleet also attacked the Byzantine Empire, making Sicily a leading maritime power in the Mediterranean Sea for almost a century.

Roger&#x27;s son and successor was William I of Sicily, known as &quot;William the Bad&quot;, though his nickname derived primarily from his lack of popularity with the chroniclers, who supported the baronial revolts which William suppressed. In the mid-1150s, William lost the majority of his African possessions to a series of revolts by local North African lords. Then, in 1160, the final Norman African stronghold of Mahdia was taken by the Almohads. His reign ended in peace in 1166. His elder son Roger IV, Duke of Apulia had been killed in previous revolts, and his son, William II, was a minor. Until the end of the boy&#x27;s regency by his mother Margaret of Navarre in 1172, turmoil in the kingdom almost brought the ruling family down. The reign of William II is remembered as two decades of almost continual peace and prosperity. For this more than anything, he is nicknamed &quot;the Good&quot;. However, he had no issue, which led to a succession crisis: his aunt Constance, the sole heir to the throne as the daughter of Roger II, was long confined in a monastery as a nun, with her marriage beyond consideration due to a prediction that &quot;her marriage would destroy Sicily&quot;. Nevertheless, in 1184, she was betrothed to Henry, the eldest son of Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor and the future Emperor Henry VI. William named Constance and Henry the heirs to the throne and had the noblemen swear oath, but the officials did not want to be ruled by a German, so the death of William in 1189 led the kingdom to decline.

With the support of the officials, Tancred of Lecce seized the throne. In the same year, he had to contend with the revolt of his distant cousin Roger of Andria, a former contender who supported Henry and Constance but was tricked to execution in 1190, as well as the invasion of Henry, King of Germany and Holy Roman Emperor since 1191, who invaded on behalf of his wife. Henry had to retreat after his attack failed, with Empress Constance captured and only released under the pressure of the Pope. Tancred died in 1194, and Constance and Henry prevailed: the kingdom fell in 1194 to the House of Hohenstaufen. William III of Sicily, the young son of Tancred, was deposed, and Henry and Constance were crowned as king and queen. Through Constance, the Hauteville blood was passed to Frederick, who reigned in Sicily as Frederick I.

=== Hohenstaufen period (1198–1266) ===

In 1197, the accession of Frederick, a child who would also become Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in 1220, greatly affected the immediate future of Sicily. For a land so used to centralised royal authority, the king&#x27;s young age caused a serious power vacuum. His uncle Philip of Swabia moved to secure Frederick&#x27;s inheritance by appointing Markward von Anweiler, margrave of Ancona, regent in 1198. Meanwhile, Pope Innocent III had reasserted papal authority in Sicily, but recognised Frederick&#x27;s rights. The pope was to see papal power decrease steadily over the next decade and was unsure about which side to back at many junctures.

The Hohenstaufen&#x27;s grip on power, however, was not secure. Walter III of Brienne had married the daughter of Tancred of Sicily. She was sister and heiress of the deposed King William III of Sicily. In 1201, William decided to claim the kingdom. In 1202, an army led by the chancellor Walter of Palearia and Dipold of Vohburg was defeated by Walter III of Brienne. Markward was killed, and Frederick fell under the control of William of Capparone, an ally of the Pisans. Dipold continued the war against Walter on the mainland until the claimant&#x27;s death in 1205. Dipold finally wrested Frederick from Capparone in 1206 and gave him over to the guardianship of the chancellor, Walter of Palearia. Walter and Dipold then had a falling out, and the latter captured the royal palace, where he was besieged and captured by Walter in 1207. After a decade, the wars over the regency and the throne itself had ceased.

The reform of the laws began with the Assizes of Ariano in 1140 by Roger II of Sicily. Frederick I continued the reformation with the Assizes of Capua (1220) and the promulgation of the Constitutions of Melfi (1231, also known as &quot;Liber Augustalis&quot;), a collection of laws for his realm that was remarkable for its time. The Constitutions of Melfi were created in order to establish a centralized state. For example, citizens were not allowed to carry weapons or wear armour in public unless they were under royal command. As a result, rebellions were reduced. The Constitutions made the Kingdom of Sicily an absolute monarchy, the first centralized state in Europe to emerge from feudalism; it also set a precedent for the primacy of written law. With relatively small modifications, the &quot;Liber Augustalis&quot; remained the basis of Sicilian law until 1819. During this period, he also built the Castel del Monte, and in 1224, he founded the University of Naples, now called University of Naples Federico II.

Frederick had to beat off a Papal invasion of Sicily in the War of the Keys (1228–1230). After his death, the kingdom was ruled by Conrad IV of Germany. The next legitimate heir was Conradin, who was too young at the period to rule. Manfred of Sicily, the illegitimate son of Frederick, took power and ruled the kingdom for fifteen years while other Hohenstaufen heirs were ruling various areas in Germany. After long wars against the Papal States, the Kingdom managed to defend its possessions, but the Papacy declared the Kingdom escheated because of the disloyalty of the Hohenstaufen. Under this pretext, Manfred came to an agreement with Louis IX, King of France. Louis&#x27;s brother, Charles of Anjou, would become king of Sicily. In exchange, Charles recognized the overlordship of the Pope in the Kingdom, paid a portion of the Papal debt, and agreed to pay annual tribute to the Papal States, the Chinea.

The Miossi family, a noble family, was commissioned in 1251 by Pope Innocent IV to administer the Kingdom of Sicily. The Hohenstaufen rule in Sicily ended after the 1266 Angevin invasion and the death of Conradin, the last male heir of Hohenstaufen, in 1268.

=== Angevin Sicily (1266–1282) ===

In 1266, conflict between the Hohenstaufen house and the Papacy led to Sicily&#x27;s conquest by Charles I, Duke of Anjou. With the usurpation of the Sicilian throne from Conradin by Manfred of Sicily in 1258, the relationship between the Papacy and the Hohenstaufen had changed again. Instead of the boy Conradin, safely sequestered across the Alps, the Papacy now faced an able military leader who had greatly supported the Ghibelline cause at the Battle of Montaperti in 1260. Accordingly, when negotiations broke down with Manfred in 1262, Pope Urban IV again took up the scheme of disseising the Hohenstaufen from the kingdom, and offered the crown to Charles of Anjou again. With Papal and Guelph support Charles descended into Italy and defeated Manfred at the Battle of Benevento in 1266 and in 1268 Conradin at the Battle of Tagliacozzo.

Opposition to French officialdom and taxation combined with incitement of rebellion by agents from the Crown of Aragon and the Byzantine Empire led to the successful insurrection of the Sicilian Vespers followed by the invitation and intervention by King Peter III of Aragon in 1282. The resulting War of the Sicilian Vespers lasted until the Peace of Caltabellotta in 1302, dividing the old Kingdom of Sicily in two. The island of Sicily, called the &quot;Kingdom of Sicily beyond the Lighthouse&quot; or the Kingdom of Trinacria, went to Frederick III of the House of Barcelona, who had been ruling it. The peninsular territories (the Mezzogiorno), contemporaneously called the Kingdom of Sicily but called the Kingdom of Naples by modern scholarship, went to Charles II of the House of Anjou, who had likewise been ruling it. Thus, the peace was formal recognition of an uneasy &quot;status quo&quot;. The division in the kingdom became permanent in 1372, with the Treaty of Villeneuve. Though the king of Aragon was able to seize both crowns in the 16th century, the administrations of the two halves of the Kingdom of Sicily remained separated until 1816, when they were reunited in the Kingdom of Two Sicilies.

=== Sicily under Aragon and Spain (1282–1700) ===
Sicily was ruled as an independent kingdom by relatives or cadet branch of the house of Aragon until 1409 and thence as part of the Crown of Aragon. The Kingdom of Naples was ruled by the Angevin ruler René of Anjou until the two thrones were reunited by Alfonso V of Aragon, after the successful siege of Naples and the defeat of René on 6 June 1443. Alfonso of Aragon divided the two kingdoms during his rule. He gave the rule of Naples to his illegitimate son Ferdinand I of Naples, who ruled from 1458 to 1494, and the rest of the Crown of Aragon and Sicily to his brother John II of Aragon. From 1494 to 1503, successive kings of France Charles VIII and Louis XII, who were heirs of the Angevins, tried to conquer Naples (see Italian Wars) but failed. Eventually, the Kingdom of Naples was reunited with the Crown of Aragon. The titles were held by the Aragonese kings of the Crown of Aragon and Kingdom of Spain until the end of the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg in 1700.
In 1530, in an effort to protect Rome from Ottoman invasion from the south, Charles V, as king of Spain and Sicily, gave the islands of Malta and Gozo to the Knights Hospitaller in perpetual fiefdom, in exchange for an annual fee of two Maltese falcons, which they were to send on All Souls&#x27; Day to the Viceroy of Sicily. The Maltese Islands had formed part of the county, and later the Kingdom of Sicily, since 1091. The feudal relationship between Malta and the Kingdom of Sicily was continued throughout the rule of the Knights, until the French occupation of Malta in 1798.

=== Savoyard and Habsburg rule (1713–1735) ===

From 1713 until 1720, the Kingdom of Sicily was ruled briefly by the House of Savoy, which had received it by the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, which brought an end to the War of the Spanish Succession. The kingdom was a reward to the Savoyards, who were thus elevated to royal rank. The new king, Victor Amadeus II, travelled to Sicily in 1713 and remained a year before returning to his mainland capital, Turin, where his son the Prince of Piedmont had been acting as regent. In Spain, the results of the war had not been truly accepted, and the War of the Quadruple Alliance was the result. Sicily was occupied by Spain in 1718. When it became evident that Savoy had not the strength to defend as remote a country as Sicily, Austria stepped in and exchanged its Kingdom of Sardinia for Sicily. Victor Amadeus protested this exchange, Sicily being a rich country of over one million inhabitants and Sardinia a poor country of a few hundred thousand, but he was unable to resist his &quot;allies&quot;. Spain was finally defeated in 1720, and the Treaty of the Hague ratified the changeover. Sicily belonged to the Austrian Habsburgs, who already ruled Naples. Victor Amadeus, for his part, continued to protest for three years, and only in 1723 decided to recognize the exchange and desist from using the Sicilian royal title and its subsidiary titles (such as King of Cyprus and Jerusalem).

=== Bourbon rule (1735–1816) ===

In 1734, in the aftermath of the War of the Polish Succession, Naples was reconquered by King Philip V of Spain, a Bourbon, who installed his younger son, Duke Charles of Parma, as King Charles VII of Naples, starting a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon. Adding to his Neapolitan possessions, he became also King of Sicily with the name of Charles V of Sicily the next year after Austria gave up Sicily and her pretensions to Naples in exchange for the Duchy of Parma and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. This change of hands opened up a period of economic flourishing and social and political reforms, with many public projects and cultural initiatives directly started or inspired by the king. He remained King of Sicily until his accession to the Spanish throne as Charles III of Spain in 1759, the Treaty of Vienna (1738) with Austria forbidding a union of the Italian domains with the Crown of Spain.

Charles III abdicated in favour of Ferdinand, his third son, who acceded to the thrones with the names of Ferdinand IV of Naples and III of Sicily. Still a minor, Ferdinand grew up amongst pleasures and leisure while the real power was safely held by Bernardo Tanucci, the president of the regency council. During this period most of the reform process initiated by Charles came to a halt, with the king mostly absent or uninterested in the matters of state and the political helm steered by Queen Maria Carolina and prime ministers Tanucci (until 1777) and John Acton. The latter tried to distance Naples and Sicily from the influence of Spain and Austria and to place them nearer to Great Britain, then represented by ambassador William Hamilton. This is the period of the Grand Tour, and Sicily with its many natural and historical attractions was visited by a score of intellectuals from all over Europe that brought to the island the winds of the Age of Enlightenment, and spread the fame of its beauty in the continent.

In 1799, Napoleon conquered Naples, forcing King Ferdinand and the court to flee to Sicily under the protection of the British fleet under the command of Horatio Nelson. While Naples was formed into the Parthenopean Republic with French support and later again a kingdom under French protection and influence, Sicily became the British base of operation in the Mediterranean in the long struggle against Napoleon. Under British guidance, especially from Lord William Bentinck who was commander of British troops in Sicily, Sicily tried to modernise its constitutional apparatus, forcing the King to ratify a Constitution modeled after the British system. The island was under British occupation from 1806 to 1814. The main feature of the new system was that a two-chamber parliament was formed (instead of the three of the existing one). The formation of the parliament brought the end of feudalism in the Kingdom.

After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, Ferdinand repealed all reforms and even erased the Kingdom of Sicily from the map (after a history of 800 years) by creating the brand-new Kingdom of the Two Sicilies with Naples as its capital in 1816. The people of Sicily rebelled to this violation of its centuries-old statutes (which every king, including Ferdinand, had sworn to respect) but were defeated by the Neapolitan and Austrian forces in 1820. In 1848–49, another Sicilian revolution of independence occurred, which was put down by the new king, Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, who was nicknamed &quot;Re Bomba&quot; after his 5-day bombardment of Messina. The increased hostility of the peoples and the elites of Sicily towards Naples and the Bourbon dynasty created a very unstable equilibrium, kept under control only by an increasingly oppressive police-state, political executions and exiles.

== Society ==
During the Norman Kingdom of Sicily, the local communities maintained their privileges. The rulers of the Hohenstaufen kingdom replaced the local nobility with lords from northern Italy, leading to clashes and rebellions against the new nobility in many cities and rural communities. These revolts resulted in the destruction of many agrarian areas and the rise of middle class nationalism, which eventually led to urban dwellers becoming allies of the Aragonese. This situation was continued during the short rule of the Angevins until their overthrowing during the Sicilian Vespers. The Angevins began feudalising the country, increasing the power of the nobility by granting them jurisdiction over high justice.

At the same period, the feudalisation of the Kingdom of Sicily was intensified, through the enforcement of feudal bonds and relations among its subjects. The 1669 Etna eruption destroyed Catania. In 1693, 5% of the Kingdom&#x27;s population was killed because of earthquakes. During that period, there were also plague outbreaks. The 17th and 18th century were an era of decline of the kingdom. Corruption was prevalent among the upper and middle classes of the society. Widespread corruption and mistreatment of the lower classes by the feudal lords led to the creation of groups of brigands, attacking the nobility and destroying their fiefs. These groups, which were self-named &quot;mafia&quot;, were the foundation of the modern Sicilian Mafia. The escalation of revolts against the monarchy eventually led to the unification with Italy.

The kingdom had a parliament from 1097, which continued to sit throughout the realm&#x27;s history until the Sicilian Constitution of 1812.

== Demographics ==
By the mid to late 13th century, estimates of the kingdom’s population range from 4 to perhaps 4.5 million, and given the proportion of mountain and pasture-land in the South, some districts must therefore have supported relatively large numbers of people. During the Hohenstaufen era, the Kingdom had 3 towns with a population of over 20,000 each. After the loss of the northern provinces in 1282 during the Sicilian Vespers and several natural disasters like the 1669 Etna eruption, the population of the Kingdom of Sicily was reduced. In 1803, the population of the Kingdom was 1,656,000. The main cities of the Kingdom at that time were Palermo, Catania, Messina, Modica, Syracuse.

== Economy ==

The high fertility of the land led the Norman kings to bring settlers from neighbouring regions or to resettle farmers to areas where cultivation of land was needed. This led to an increase in agricultural production. The main sources of wealth for the Kingdom of Sicily in that time were its maritime cities, most important of which were the ancient port cities of Naples and its nearby counterpart Amalfi, from which local products were exported. The main export was durum wheat, with other exports including nuts, timber, oil, bacon, cheese, furs, hides, hemp and cloth. Grain and other dry products were measured in salme, which was equivalent to 275.08 litres in the western part of the Kingdom, and 300.3 litres in the eastern part. The salma was divided in 16 tumoli. One tumolo was equivalent to 17,193 litres. Weight was measured in cantari. One cantaro was equivalent to and was divided in one hundred rottoli. Cloth was measured in canne. One canna was 2.06 meters long. By the end of the 12th century, Messina had become one of the leading commercial cities of the kingdom.

Under the kingdom, Sicily&#x27;s products went to many different lands. Among these were Genoa, Pisa, the Byzantine Empire, and Egypt. Over the course of the 12th century, Sicily became an important source of raw materials for north Italian cities such as Genoa. As the centuries went on, however, this economic relationship became less advantageous to Sicily, and some modern scholars see the relationship as definitely exploitative. Furthermore, many scholars believe that Sicily went into decline in the Late Middle Ages, though they do not agree about when this decline occurred. Clifford Backman argues that it is a mistake to see the economic history of Sicily in terms of victimization, and contends that the decline really began in the second part of the reign of Frederick III, in contrast to earlier scholars who believed that Sicilian decline had set in earlier. Where earlier scholars saw late medieval Sicily in continuous decline, Stephen Epstein argued that Sicilian society experienced something of a revival in the 15th century.

Various treaties with Genoa secured and strengthened the commercial power of Sicily.

The feudalisation of society during the Angevin rule reduced royal wealth and treasury. The dependence of the Angevins on north Italian commerce and financing by Florentine bankers were the main factors which led to the decline of the Kingdom&#x27;s economy. The continuation of the economic decline combined with the increased population and urbanization led to decrease of agrarian production.

In 1800, one-third of the available crops was cultivated with obsolete methods, exacerbating the problem. In the later period of Spanish rule, the trading system was also inefficient compared with previous periods because of high taxes on exports and monopolising corporations which had total control of prices.

== Coinage ==

The Norman kings in the 12th century used the tari, which had been used in Sicily from 913 as the basic coin. One tari weighed about one gram and was carats of gold. The Arab dinar was worth four tari, and the Byzantine solidus six tari. In the kingdom, one onza was equivalent to thirty tari or five florins. One tari was worth twenty grani. One grana was equivalent to six denari. After 1140, the circulation of the copper coin romesina stopped and it was replaced by the follaris. Twenty-four follari were equivalent to one Byzantine miliaresion.

After defeating the Tunisians in 1231, King Frederick I minted the augustalis. It was minted in carats and weighed 5.28 grams. In 1490, the triumphi were minted in Sicily. They were equivalent to the Venetian ducat. One triumpho was worth aquilae. One aquila was worth twenty grani. In transactions tari and pichuli were mainly used.

== Religion ==

During the Norman reign, several different religious communities coexisted in the Kingdom of Sicily. These included Latin Catholics (Roman Catholics), Greek-rite Catholics (Greek Catholic), Muslims and Jews. Although local religious practices were not interrupted, the fact that Latin Catholics were in power tended to favor Latin Catholicism (Roman Catholicism). Bishops of the Greek rite were obliged to recognize the claims of the Latin Church in Sicily, while Muslim communities were no longer ruled by local emirs. Greek-speaking Christians, Latin Christians, and Muslims interacted on a regular basis, and were involved in each other&#x27;s lives, economically, linguistically, and culturally. Some intermarried. Catholics living in an Arabic-speaking area might adopt Arabic or even Muslim names. In many cities, each religious community had its own administrative and judicial order. In Palermo, Muslims were allowed to publicly call for prayer in mosques, and their legal issues were settled by qadis, judges who ruled in accordance with Islamic law. Since the 12th century, the Kingdom of Sicily recognized Christianity as the state religion.

After the establishment of Hohenstaufen authority, Latin- and Greek-speaking Catholics maintained their privileges, but the Muslim population was increasingly oppressed. The settlements of Italians brought from northern Italy (who wanted Muslim property for their own) led many Muslim communities to revolt or resettle in mountainous areas of Sicily. These revolts resulted in some acts of violence, and the eventual deportation of Muslims, which began under Frederick II. Eventually, the government removed the entire Muslim population to Lucera in Apulia and Girifalco in Calabria, where they paid taxes and served as agricultural laborers, craftsmen, and crossbowmen for the benefit of the king. The colony at Lucera was finally disbanded in 1300 under Charles II of Naples, and many of its inhabitants sold into slavery. The Jewish community was expelled after the establishment of the Spanish Inquisition from 1493 to 1513 in Sicily. The remaining Jews were gradually assimilated, and most of them converted to Roman Catholicism.

<doc id="641388" wikidata="Q771572" url="?curid=641388" title="Williamsburg, Brooklyn">
<text>Williamsburg is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, bordered by Greenpoint to the north; Bedford–Stuyvesant to the south; Bushwick and East Williamsburg to the east; and the East River to the west. It was an independent city until 1855, when it was annexed by Brooklyn; at that time, the spelling was changed from Williamsburgh (with an &quot;h&quot;) to Williamsburg.

Williamsburg, especially near the waterfront, was a vital industrial district until the mid-20th century. As many of the jobs were outsourced beginning in the 1970s, the area endured a period of economic contraction which did not begin to turn around until activist groups began to address housing, infrastructure, and youth education issues in the late 20th century. An ecosocial arts movement emerged alongside the activists in the late 1980s, often referred to as the Brooklyn Immersionists. The community-based scene cultivated a web of activity in the streets, rooftops and large warehouses, and attracted both the national and international press. Small, locally owned businesses began to return to the neighborhood during this expansion of creative urbanism in the 1990s.

In the 21st century, the city provided zoning changes and tax abatements to corporate developers which shifted the area from a creative, slow growth revival to an economy that was dominated by high rises and chain stores. Despite the rise in the cost of living that followed, and the loss of the original creative community that had rejuvenated the district, a new contemporary art scene and vibrant nightlife emerged that catered to new residents. However, the intensity and innovations of the Immersionist era in Williamsburg has continued to project the district&#x27;s image internationally as a &quot;Little Berlin&quot;. During the early 2000s, the neighborhood became a center for indie rock and electroclash. Numerous ethnic groups still inhabit enclaves within the neighborhood, including Italians, Jews, Hispanics, Poles, Puerto Ricans, and Dominicans.

Williamsburg is part of Brooklyn Community District 1, and its primary ZIP Codes are 11206, 11211 and 11249. It is patrolled by the 90th and 94th Precincts of the New York City Police Department. Politically, it is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 33rd District, which represents the western and southern parts of the neighborhood, and the 34th District, which represents the eastern part. As of the 2020 United States census, the neighborhood&#x27;s population is 151,308.

==History==
===Founding===

In 1638, the Dutch West India Company purchased the area&#x27;s land from the Lenape Native Americans who occupied the area. In 1661, the company chartered the Town of &quot;Boswijck&quot;, including land that would later become Williamsburg. After the English takeover of New Netherland in 1664, the town&#x27;s name was anglicized to Bushwick. During colonial times, villagers called the area &quot;Bushwick Shore&quot;, a name that lasted for about 140 years. Bushwick Shore was cut off from the other villages in Bushwick by Bushwick Creek to the north and by Cripplebush, a region of thick, boggy shrub land that extended from Wallabout Creek in the south to Newtown Creek in the east. Bushwick residents called Bushwick Shore &quot;the Strand&quot;.

Farmers and gardeners from the other Bushwick villages sent their goods to Bushwick Shore to be ferried across the East River to Manhattan for sale via a market at present day Grand Street. Bushwick Shore&#x27;s favorable location close to New York City led to the creation of several farming developments. In 1802, real estate speculator Richard M. Woodhull acquired near what would become Metropolitan Avenue, then North 2nd Street. He had Colonel Jonathan Williams, a U.S. Engineer, survey the property, and named it &quot;Williamsburgh&quot; (with an h at the end) in his honor. Originally a development within Bushwick Shore, Williamsburg rapidly expanded during the first half of the 19th century and eventually seceded from Bushwick and formed its own independent city. Abraham J. Berry was the first mayor of the independent city of Williamsburgh; the &quot;h&quot; at the end of the name was dropped in 1855.

===Incorporation of Williamsburgh===

Williamsburg was incorporated as the Village of Williamsburgh within the Town of Bushwick on April 14, 1827. In two years, it had a fire company, a post office, and a population of over 1,000. The deep drafts along the East River encouraged industrialists, many from Germany, to build shipyards around Williamsburg. Raw material was shipped in, and finished products were sent out of factories straight to the docks. Several sugar barons built processing refineries, all of which are now gone, except the refinery of the now-defunct Domino Sugar (formerly Havemeyer &amp; Elder). Other important industries included shipbuilding and brewing.

On April 18, 1835, the Village of Williamsburg annexed a portion of the Town of Bushwick. The Village then consisted of three districts. The first district was commonly called the &quot;South Side&quot;, the second district was called the &quot;North Side&quot;, and the third district was called the &quot;New Village&quot;. The names &quot;North Side&quot; and &quot;South Side&quot; remain in common usage today, but the name for the Third District has changed often. The New Village became populated by Germans, and for a time was known by the sobriquet of &quot;Dutchtown&quot;.

In 1845, the population of Williamsburgh was 11,500.

On April 7, 1840. reflecting its increasing urbanization, Williamsburg separated from Bushwick as the Town of Williamsburg. Edmund Smith Driggs (1809–1889) was a Williamsburg resident and was elected the first president of the Village of Williamsburg in 1850. He was also president of the Williamsburg City Fire Insurance Company and built a row of houses on South Second Street. Driggs Avenue is named after him.

In 1851, the municipality became the City of Williamsburgh (it would discard the &quot;h&quot; in 1855), which was organized into three wards. The old First Ward roughly coincides with the South Side, and the Second Ward with the North Side, with the modern boundary at Grand Street. The Third Ward was to the east of these, stretching from Union Avenue east to Bushwick Avenue, beyond which is Bushwick (some of which is now called East Williamsburg).

===Incorporation into the Eastern District===

In 1855, the City of Williamsburg, along with the adjoining Town of Bushwick, was annexed into the City of Brooklyn as the so-called Eastern District. The First Ward of Williamsburg became Brooklyn&#x27;s 13th Ward, the Second Ward Brooklyn&#x27;s 14th Ward, and the Third Ward Brooklyn&#x27;s 15th and 16th Wards.

During its period as part of Brooklyn&#x27;s Eastern District, the area achieved remarkable industrial, cultural, and economic growth, and local businesses thrived. Wealthy New Yorkers such as Cornelius Vanderbilt and railroad magnate Jubilee Jim Fisk built shore-side mansions. Charles Pratt and his family founded the Pratt Institute, the great school of art &amp; architecture, and the Astral Oil Works, which later became part of Standard Oil. Corning Glass Works was founded here, before moving upstate to Corning, New York. German immigrant, chemist Charles Pfizer founded Pfizer Pharmaceutical in Williamsburg, and the company maintained an industrial plant in the neighborhood through 2007, although its headquarters were moved to Manhattan in the 1960s.

Brooklyn&#x27;s Broadway, ending in the ferry to Manhattan, became the area&#x27;s lifeline. The area proved popular for condiment and household product manufacturers. Factories for Domino Sugar, Esquire Shoe Polish, Dutch Mustard, and many others were established in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of these factory buildings are now being (or already have been) converted to non-industrial uses, primarily residential.

The population was at first heavily German, but many Jews from the Lower East side of Manhattan came to the area after the completion of the Williamsburg Bridge in 1903. Williamsburg had two major community banks: the Williamsburgh Savings Bank at 175 Broadway (chartered 1851, since absorbed by HSBC); and its rival, the Dime Savings Bank of Williamsburgh one block west (chartered 1864, now known as the DIME, has remained independent). The area around the Peter Luger Steak House, established in 1887, in the predominantly German neighborhood under the Williamsburg Bridge, was a major banking hub, until the City of Brooklyn united with the City of Greater New York. One of the early high schools in Brooklyn, the Eastern District High School, opened here in February 1900.

===Incorporation into New York City===

In 1898, Brooklyn became one of five boroughs within the City of Greater New York, and the Williamsburg neighborhood was opened to closer connections with the rest of the newly consolidated city. Five years later, the opening of the Williamsburg Bridge in 1903 further opened up the community to thousands of upwardly mobile immigrants and second-generation Americans fleeing the over-crowded slum tenements of Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. Williamsburg itself soon became the most densely populated neighborhood in New York City, which, in turn, was the most densely populated city in the United States. The novel &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; addresses a young girl growing up in the tenements of Williamsburg during this era.

Brooklyn Union Gas in the early 20th century consolidated its coal gas production to Williamsburg at 370 Vandervoort Avenue, closing the Gowanus Canal gasworks. The 1970s energy crisis led the company to build a syngas factory. Late in the century, facilities were built to import liquefied natural gas from overseas. The intersection of Broadway, Flushing Avenue, and Graham Avenue was a cross-roads for many &quot;inter-urbans&quot;, prior to World War I. These light rail trolleys ran from Long Island to Williamsburg.

Refugees from war-torn Europe began to stream into Brooklyn during and after World War II, including the Hasidim, whose populations had been devastated in the Holocaust. The area south of Division Avenue became home to a large population of adherents to the Satmar Hasidic sect, who came to the area from Hungary and Romania. Hispanics from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic also began to settle in the area. But the population explosion was eventually confronted with a decline of heavy industry, and from the 1960s, Williamsburg saw a marked increase in unemployment, crime, gang activity, and illegal drug use. Those who were able to move out often did, and the area became chiefly known for its crime and other social ills.

On February 3, 1971, at 10:42 pm, police officer Frank Serpico was shot during a drug bust, during a stakeout at 778 Driggs Avenue. Serpico had been one of the driving forces in the creation of the Knapp Commission, which exposed widespread police corruption. His fellow officers failed to call for assistance, and he was rushed to Greenpoint Hospital only when an elderly neighbor called the police. The incident was later dramatized in the opening scene of the 1973 film &quot;Serpico&quot;, starring Al Pacino in the title role.

===Rezoning and corporate expansion===

The price of land in Williamsburg has increased significantly since the 2000s. The North Side, above Grand Street, which separates the North Side from the South Side, is somewhat more expensive due to its proximity to the New York City Subway (specifically, the and on the BMT Canarsie Line and IND Crosstown Line, respectively). Increased gentrification has entered the South Side along the route of the J/Z and M trains (of which the latter route was modified to go from the downtown BMT Nassau Street Line to the midtown IND Sixth Avenue Line in 2010). This has prompted increases in rents south of Grand Street as well. Higher rents have driven out many bohemians, activists and creative urbanists to other neighborhoods farther afield such as Bushwick, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Cobble Hill, and Red Hook.

On May 11, 2005, the New York City Council passed a large-scale rezoning of the North Side and Greenpoint waterfront. Billions of dollars in tax abatements were also provided to developers. Much of the waterfront district was rezoned to accommodate mixed-use high density residential buildings with a set-aside (but no earmarked funding) for public waterfront park space, with strict building guidelines calling for developers to create a continuous string of waterfront esplanades. Although a slow growth economic revival was already underway and was bringing back family owned local businesses, local elected officials touted the rezoning as an economically beneficial way to address the decline of manufacturing along the North Brooklyn waterfront. The storefronts and vacant warehouses in Williamsburg were already being adapted into creative clubs like The Green Room, El Sensorium, Fake Shop, Mustard, The AlulA Dimension and Galapagos Art Space.
The rezoning represented a dramatic shift of approach from an emphasis on a creative, locally based economy in the 1990s to one largely dominated by corporations. The waterfront neighborhoods, once characterized by active manufacturing and other light industry interspersed with smaller residential buildings, were re-zoned primarily for residential high rise construction. Alongside the construction of high rises, many warehouses which served as centers for creative community-building events like the Cats Head, Flytrap, El Sensorium and Organism, were converted into expensive residential loft buildings. Among the first was the Smith-Gray Building, a turn-of-the-century structure recognizable by its blue cast-iron façade. The conversion of the former Gretsch music instrument factory garnered significant attention and controversy in the New York press primarily because it heralded the arrival in Williamsburg of Tribeca-style lofts and attracted, as residents and investors, a number of celebrities.

Officials championing the rezoning cited its economic benefits, the new waterfront promenades, and its inclusionary housing component – which offered developers large tax breaks in exchange for promises to rent about a third of the new housing units at &quot;affordable&quot; rates. Critics countered that similar set-asides for affordable housing have gone unfulfilled in previous large-scale developments, such as Battery Park City. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported this proved to be the case in Williamsburg as well, as developers largely decided to forgo incentives to build affordable housing in inland areas.

== Land use ==
Williamsburg contains a variety of zoning districts, including manufacturing, commercial, residential, and mixed-use. North Williamsburg contains primarily light industrial and medium-density residential buildings, as well as some residential structures with commercial space on the ground floors. There are also high-density residential developments with commercial space, as well as a few remaining heavy industries, along the waterfront. The area around Broadway is primarily commercial, and contains stores and offices. On the other hand, South Williamsburg is largely medium-to-high density residential, with some commercial space on the ground floors.

===Landmarked buildings===
====City landmarks====
Several structures in Williamsburg have been landmarked by the city&#x27;s Landmarks Preservation Commission. The Kings County Savings Institution, chartered in 1860, built the Kings County Savings Bank building at Bedford Avenue and Broadway. The structure, an example of French Second Empire architecture, has been on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) since 1980, and was made a New York City landmark in 1966.

The Williamsburg Houses were designated a city landmark on June 24, 2003. The site, consisting of twenty 4-story buildings, was designed by William Lescaze, and was the first large-scale public housing in Brooklyn. It was completed in 1938, and is operated by the New York City Housing Authority.

In 2007, three buildings of the Domino Sugar Refinery were also designated New York City Landmarks. The original refinery was built in 1856, and by 1870 processed more than half of sugar used in the United States. A fire in 1882 caused the plant to be completely rebuilt in brick and stone; these buildings exist today, though the refinery stopped operating in 2004. In 2010, a developer proposed to convert the site to residential use; since them, a new plan was approved for the Domino Sugar Factory, led by Two Trees Management.

The New England Congregational Church and Rectory, built between 1852 and 1853, was listed on the NRHP in 1983. It is also a city landmark. The church was sold to its current occupant, La Iglesia Pentecostal La Luz del Mundo, in 1981.

One historic district also exists in Williamsburg, the Fillmore Place Historic District. Landmarked in 2009, it consists of several Italianate style buildings.

==== National Register of Historic Places listings ====
Numerous structures are also located on the NRHP, but are not city landmarks. The Austin, Nichols and Company Warehouse, built in 1915 to a design by architect Cass Gilbert, was placed on the NRHP in 2007. Originally also a city landmark, the designation was later rescinded. The warehouse was converted to apartments in the 2010s.

The German Evangelical Lutheran St. John&#x27;s Church was built in 1883 and made a NRHP landmark in 2019.

Public School 71K, built in 1888–1889 to designs by James W. Naughton, was made a NRHP landmark in 1982, though it no longer serves as a public school.

The United States Post Office, built in 1936 by Louis A. Simon, was landmarked in 1988.

==Culture==
The subdivisions within Williamsburg vary widely. &quot;South Williamsburg&quot; refers to the area which today is occupied mainly by the Yiddish-speaking Hasidim (predominantly Satmar Hasidim) and a considerable Puerto Rican population. North of this area (with Division Street or Broadway serving as a dividing line) is an area known as &quot;Los Sures&quot;, occupied by Puerto Ricans and Dominicans. To the north of that is the &quot;North Side&quot;, traditionally Polish and Italian. East Williamsburg is home to many industrial spaces, and forms the largely Italian American, African American, and Hispanic area between Williamsburg and Bushwick. South Williamsburg, the South Side, the North Side, Greenpoint, and East Williamsburg all form Brooklyn Community Board 1. Its proximity to Manhattan has made it popular with recently arrived residents who are often referred to under the blanket term &quot;hipster&quot;. Bedford Avenue and its subway station, as the first stop in the neighborhood on the BMT Canarsie Line (on the ), have become synonymous with this new wave of residents.

===Ethnic communities===
====Hasidic Jewish community====

Williamsburg is inhabited by thousands of Hasidic Jews of various groups, and contains the headquarters of one faction of the Satmar Hasidic group. Williamsburg&#x27;s Satmar population numbers about 57,000.

Hasidic Jews first moved to the neighborhood in the years prior to World War II, along with many other religious and non-religious Jews who sought to escape the difficult living conditions on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. Beginning in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the area received a large concentration of Holocaust survivors, many of whom were Hasidic Jews from rural areas of Hungary and Romania. These people were led by several Hasidic leaders, among them the rebbes of Satmar, Klausenberg, Vien, Pupa, Tzehlem, and Skver. In addition, Williamsburg contained sizable numbers of religious, but non-Hasidic, Jews. The Rebbe of Satmar, Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, ultimately exerted the most powerful influence over the community, causing many of the non-Satmars, especially the non-Hasidim, to leave. Teitelbaum was known for his fierce anti-Zionism and for his charismatic style of leadership.

In the late 1990s, Jewish developers renovated old warehouses and factories, turning them into housing. More than 500 apartments were approved in the three-year period following 1997; soon afterward, an area near Williamsburg&#x27;s border with Bedford–Stuyvesant was re-zoned for affordable housing. By 1997, there were about 7,000 Hasidic families in Williamsburg, almost a third of whom took public assistance. The Hasidic community of Williamsburg has one of the highest birthrates in the country, with an average of eight children per family. Each year, the community celebrates between 800 and 900 weddings for young couples, who typically marry between the ages of 18 and 21. Because Hasidic men receive little secular education, and women tend to be homemakers, college degrees are rare, and economic opportunities lag far behind the rest of the population. In response to the almost 60% poverty rate in Jewish Williamsburg, the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, a beneficiary agency of the UJA-Federation of New York, partnered with Masbia in the opening of a 50-seat kosher soup kitchen on Lee Avenue in November 2009.

There are many households with Section 8 housing vouchers; in 2000, there were 1,394 voucher recipients in Williamsburg&#x27;s nine Yiddish-speaking census tracts, but by 2014, Williamsburg had 3,296 voucher recipients within 12 Yiddish-speaking census tracts. In 2014, it was reported that Williamsburg&#x27;s Jewish community had among the highest rates of applications for Section 8 housing vouchers. However, the newspaper &quot;New York Daily News&quot; doubted the legality of the applications. In 2016, the &quot;Daily News&quot; said that New York City census tracts with 30% or more of the population applying for Section 8 were present only in Williamsburg and the Bronx, except that Williamsburg&#x27;s real estate, after the City of New York provided billions of dollars in tax abatements to developers, was becoming the most expensive real estate in the city.

A 2013 study by the UJA-Federation of New York identified Williamsburg as home to the second-fastest Jewish population growth in New York City, with a Jewish population of approximately 74,500 in 2011, a 41% increase from a decade earlier. Due to the neighborhood&#x27;s rapid growth and high real estate prices, 77% of Jews in Williamsburg were renters, the highest rate in the city.

After the city subsidized developers in North Brooklyn, and longstanding local land owners from both North and South Williamsburg sold large blocks of land to the corporations, Hasidim have characterized the influx of new renters who had nothing to with land sales or city policy, as the &quot;artisten,&quot; or a &quot;plague&quot; and &quot;a bitter decree from Heaven&quot;. Tensions have risen over housing costs, loud and boisterous nightlife events, and the introduction of bike lanes along Bedford Avenue. Although the effects of New York&#x27;s development policies favoring high rise construction and luxury chain stores is increasing, many developers, such as Isaac Hager, continue to build more housing for Haredi tenants.

According to a 2024 UJA-Federation of New York survey, 74% of Jewish households in Williamsburg identified as Orthodox. The total Jewish population was an estimated 36,000 adults and 32,000 children.

====Italian-American community and Our Lady of Mount Carmel====

A significant component of the Italian community on the North Side and East Side were immigrants from the city of Nola near Naples. Residents of Nola every summer celebrate the &quot;Festa dei Gigli&quot; (feast of lilies) in honor of St. Paulinus of Nola, who was bishop of Nola in the fifth century, and the immigrants brought this tradition over with them. For two weeks every summer, the streets surrounding Our Lady of Mount Carmel church, located on Havemeyer and North 8th Streets, are dedicated to a celebration of Italian culture.

The highlights of the feast are the &quot;Giglio Sundays&quot; when a tall statue, complete with band and a singer, is carried around the streets in honor of St. Paulinus and Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Clips of this awe-inspiring sight are often featured on NYC news broadcasts. A significant number of Italian-Americans still reside in the area, although the numbers have decreased over the years. The northeastern section of Williamsburg associated with &quot;Italian Williamsburg&quot; retains a significant Italian-American presence and is home to numerous Italian-American families, community centers, social clubs, businesses, and restaurants, such as Bamonte&#x27;s, the Fortunato Brothers Cafe, Anthony and Son Panini Shoppe, Carmine and Son&#x27;s, Emily&#x27;s Pork Store, Napoli Bakery, Metropolitan Fish Market, Jr and Son, and Salerno Autobody. Sections of Graham Avenue in the Italian section are named Via Vespucci in honor of Amerigo Vespucci and the Italian character of the neighborhood. Despite the fact that an increasing number of Italian-Americans have moved away, many return each summer for the feast. The Giglio was the subject of a documentary, &quot;Heaven Touches Brooklyn in July&quot;, narrated by actors John Turturro and Michael Badalucco.

====Puerto Rican and Dominican community====
On Williamburg&#x27;s Southside, also known in Spanish as &quot;Los Sures&quot;, which is the area south of Grand Street, there exists a sizable Puerto Rican and Dominican population. Puerto Ricans have been coming to the area since the 1940s and the 1950s, and Dominicans came in the 1970s and 1980s. Many Puerto Ricans flocked to the area after World War II, due to the proximity to jobs at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The neighborhood continues to have 27% Hispanic or Latino population, and Graham Avenue, between Grand Street and Broadway, is known as the &quot;Avenue of Puerto Rico&quot;. Havemeyer Street is lined with Hispanic-owned bodegas and barber shops. However, even though the Southside has the highest concentration of Hispanics in the neighborhood, this population is dispersed throughout all of Williamsburg, as far north as the Williamsburg-Greenpoint border.

The Latino community has several cultural institutions in Williamsburg. The Caribbean Social Club, the last remaining Puerto Rican social club in Williamsburg, preserves the neighborhood&#x27;s culture. Another such institution is the &quot;El Puente&quot; Community Center, as well as the &quot;San German&quot; record store on Graham Avenue. Graham Avenue was renamed Avenue of Puerto Rico as a symbol of pride, just as the avenue&#x27;s other alternate name, Via Vespucci, is meant to commemorate the neighborhood&#x27;s Italian-American community. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico has a branch on Graham Avenue. In addition, Southside United HDFC is a charity organization that helps residents with housing needs and other services, including mobilizing housing activists and residents, as well as providing affordable housing. The Moore Street Market, often referred to as La Marqueta de Williamsburg, is located at 110 Moore Street.

In addition, there have been several cultural events. In the past, Southside United HDFC has held Puerto Rican Heritage as well as Dominican Independence Day celebrations, and currently operates El Museo De Los Sures. The name &quot;El Museo De Los Sures&quot; roughly translates to &quot;The Museum of the Southside&quot;. Williamsburg is also home to not one, but two campuses of Boricua College: the Northside campus on North 6th Street, between Bedford Avenue and Driggs Avenue; as well as the East Williamburg/Bushwick campus on Graham Avenue. A place popular among Dominican-American residents is the Fula Lounge, where Merengue and Raggaeton artists from the Dominican Republic often frequent. Once a year, the Williamsburg/Bushwick community hosts a Puerto Rican Day parade.

The neighborhood has produced many prominent Latinos. Television chef Daisy Martinez, who specializes in Puerto Rican cuisine grew up in the neighborhood. The neighborhood also is home to the office of U.S. representative Nydia Velazquez. In addition to this, Williamsburg was the childhood home of City Councilwoman Rosie Méndez, of Puerto Rican descent. Williamsburg itself was represented in the City Council by Dominican American Antonio Reynoso. The Hispanic sector as a whole was represented in a documentary called Living Los Sures, which documents the lives of Latino residents living in 1984 Southside before gentrification. Another documentary in 2013, &quot;Toñita&#x27;s&quot;, depicts the Caribbean Social Club, and is named after the club&#x27;s owner.

====Ethnic and inter-cultural tensions====
About 2 o&#x27;clock on November 7, 1854, a riot occurred between sheriffs and &quot;some Irishmen&quot; at the poll of the First District, at the corner of 2nd and North 6th streets, in Williamsburg. It began after a deputy approached a citizen, and a fight started. Immediately, eight or ten deputies began freely using clubs on a group of &quot;about one hundred Irishmen&quot;, resulting in a half-hour general fight and many injuries.

Prior to the corporatization of Williamsburg in the new millennium, the district often saw tension between its Hasidic population and its black and Hispanic groups. In response to decades of rising crime in the area, the Hasidim created a volunteer patrol organization, called &quot;Shomrim&quot; (&quot;guardians&quot; in Hebrew), to perform citizens&#x27; arrests, and to keep an eye out for crime. Over the years, the Shomrim have been accused of racism and brutality against blacks and Hispanics. In 2009, Yakov Horowitz, a member of Shomrim, was charged with assault, for striking a Latino adolescent on the nose with his Walkie Talkie. In 2014, five members of the Hasidic community, at least two of whom were Shomrim members, were arrested in connection with the December 2013 &quot;gang assault&quot; of a black gay man.

The mid-century tension between the Hasidic and Modern Orthodox Jewish communities in Williamsburg was depicted in Chaim Potok&#x27;s novels &quot;The Chosen&quot; (1967), &quot;The Promise&quot;, and &quot;My Name Is Asher Lev&quot;. One contemporary female perspective on life in the Satmar community in Williamsburg is offered by Deborah Feldman&#x27;s autobiographical &quot;&quot;. The Netflix miniseries &quot;Unorthodox&quot; is loosely based on Feldman&#x27;s autobiography.

===Arts community===
====Visual arts and interdisciplinary culture====

The first artists moved to Williamsburg in the 1970s, drawn by the low rents, large floor area, and convenient transportation. This continued through the 1980s and increased significantly in the 1990s as earlier destinations such as SoHo and the East Village became occupied by wealthier populations. In the 1990s a generation of interdisciplinary artists known as the Brooklyn Immersionists began to focus their fusion of art and music in Williamsburg&#x27;s streets, rooftops and industrial warehouses near the waterfront. The social and environmental engagement of the Immersionists was discussed in major arts journals and media, including &quot;The Drama Review, Flash Art, Wired, The New York Times, The New Yorker, Domus,&quot; The Guggenheim Museum CyberAtlas&quot;, Die Zeit,&quot; &quot;Newsweek,&quot; and &quot;Fuji Television&quot;. At least four major art history books have included artists from the Immersionist movement.

By 1996 Williamsburg had accumulated an artist population of about 3,000. Art galleries, interdisciplinary venues and immersive theater groups in the area included Sideshow Gallery, Minor Injury Gallery, The Lizard&#x27;s Tail Cabaret, Nerve Circle, Epoché, The Green Room, Test-Site, Hit and Run Theater, El Sensorium, The AlulA Dimension, Mustard, Pierogi 2000 Gallery, Momenta Gallery, Galapagos Art Space and the Front Room Gallery. Williamsburg and Greenpoint are served by a monthly galleries listings magazine, &quot;wagmag&quot;. Local arts media that began a discourse on neighborhood involvement in the early 1990s included &quot;Breukelen,&quot; &quot;The Curse&quot;, &quot;The Nose&quot;, The Outpost, &quot;Waterfront Week&quot;, &quot;Worm Magazine&quot; and &quot;(718) Subwire.&quot;

In September 2000, &quot;11211 Magazine&quot; launched a four color glossy circulating 10,000 copies in Brooklyn and Manhattan. The publication focused on the historical and notable properties, arts and culture, and real estate development of the 11211 ZIP Code. Other publications attributed to &quot;11211 Magazine&quot;: &quot;Fortnight&quot;, &quot;The Box Map&quot; (2002), &quot;Appetite&quot;, and &quot;10003 Magazine&quot; for the East Village in New York City. The magazine had published 36 issues (548,000 copies) of &quot;11211&quot; over a six-year period, and ceased circulation in 2006.

====Musical community====

Williamsburg has become a notable home for live music and an incubator for new bands. Beginning in the late 1980s, and through the late 1990s, a number of unlicensed performance, theater, and music venues operated in abandoned industrial buildings and other spaces in the streets. A new culture has evolved in the area surrounding Bedford Avenue subway station. Venues attracted a mix of artists, musicians and the urban underground for late night music, dance, and performance events, which were occasionally interrupted and the venues temporarily closed by the fire department.

The first large gathering of artists and musicians, with nearly 100 presenters and hundreds of attendees, took place at a three-day festival with the humorous name, The Sex Salon. The event opened on Valentine&#x27;s Day, 1990 at Epoché, a warehouse space located near the Williamsburg Bridge. Five months later another interdisciplinary event, the Cat&#x27;s Head, opened in a section of the Old Dutch Mustard Factory on N. 1st Street. Soon after that a series of other warehouse and street events merged live music, dancing and other art forms: Cats Head II, Flytrap, Human Fest (I &amp; II), El Sensorium and Organism.

Taking over most of the Old Dutch Mustard Factory on June 12, 1993, Organism drew in more than 2,000 people according to &quot;Newsweek&quot;,&quot;&quot; and was described by Suzan Wines in &quot;Domus Magazine&quot; as a &quot;climax to the renegade activity&quot;&quot;&quot; that was emerging in Williamsburg in the 1990s. A fusion of urban environmentalism and interdisciplinary culture, the entire generation of experimental venues, events and zines in the 1990s has come to be known as the Brooklyn Immersionists and celebrated in art and music history books such as Cisco Bradley&#x27;s The Williamsburg Avant-Garde: Experimental Music and Sound on the Brooklyn Waterfront. Films have covered the movement such as Marcin Ramocki&#x27;s Brooklyn DIY, which premiered at the Museum of Modern Art in 2009.

These events eventually diminished in number as chain stores and high rises moved into the area, rents rose, and regulations were enforced. A number of smaller, fleeting spaces, and several Manhattan-based venues also opened locations here. In the summers of 2006, 2007, and 2008, events including concerts, movies, and dance performances were staged at the previously abandoned pool at McCarren Park in Greenpoint. Starting in 2009, these pool parties are now held at the Williamsburg waterfront.

The neighborhood has also attracted a respectable funk, soul and worldbeat music scene spearheaded by labels such as Daptone and Truth &amp; Soul Records – and fronted by acts such as the Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra and Sharon Jones &amp; The Dap-Kings. Jazz and World Music has found a foothold, with classic jazz full-time at restaurant venues like Zebulon and Moto, and – on the more avant and noise side – at spots like the Lucky Cat, B.P.M., Monkeytown (closed in 2010), and Eat Records. A Latin Jazz community continues among the Caribbean community in Southside and East Williamsburg, centered around the many social clubs in the neighborhood. In the early 2000s, the neighborhood also became a center of electroclash. Friday and Saturday parties at Club Luxx (now Trash) introduced electronic acts like W.I.T., A.R.E. Weapons, Fischerspooner, and Scissor Sisters.

Williamsburg is also the place where innovative fusions of music, art and living systems emerged such as Nerve Circle&#x27;s &quot;media organism&#x27;s&quot; at Minor Injury Gallery in 1990 and 1991, and the &quot;web jam,&quot; the aesthetic algorithm informing the large warehouse event Organism in 1993. In 1994, Lalalandia&#x27;s &quot;techno-organic&quot; club, El Sensorium, gave birth to a new form of electronic music called illbient. Other new genres of electronic music emerged in Williamsburg at that time, including dark, hip hop-, ambient- and dub-influenced varieties.

====Theatre and cinema====

In the 1990s a large number of experimental media groups and street theater troupes emerged in Williamsburg which deliberately situated their screens and interactive performances in social and physical environments. These Immersionist groups included the Floating Cinema, Fake Shop, Nerve Circle, The Outpost, Ocularis, The Pedestrian Project and Hit and Run Theater. Galapagos Art Space, which first opened in Williamsburg in 1996, hosted the Ocularis media collective&#x27;s roof screenings and was a major host of New Burlesque theater. More recently Williamsburg contains indie theater spaces such as the Brick Theater. The Williamsburg Independent Film Festival was founded in 2010. Williamsburg also contains the first-run multiplex theater known as Williamsburg Cinemas, which opened on December 19, 2012.

===Effects of corporate subsidization===

Low rents were a major reason artists first started settling in the area, but that situation has drastically changed since the late-1990s when the City of New York began rezoning the district in favor of large developers. The City furthered the process by providing them billions of dollars in tax abatements. Russ Buettner and Ray Rivera point out in the New York Times that beginning in 2001, it wasn&#x27;t the creative community or working class entrepreneurs, but rather the billionaire, Mayor Michael Bloomberg who &quot;loosened the reins on development across the boroughs&quot;. Buettner and Rivera continue: &quot;His administration poured $16 billion into financing to foster commercial development.&quot; New York City&#x27;s Comptroller is then cited on such corporate welfare:&quot;Comptroller William C. Thompson has said the mayor focuses too much on large developments that go to favored builders who receive wasteful subsidies. When the new Yankee Stadium came up in Tuesday night&#x27;s debate, he said: &#x27;This is just another example of a giveaway, of the mayor&#x27;s giveaway to another one of his developer friends in the city.&#x27;&quot;Free market dynamics like that exercised by individual home buying and selling, does describe what occurred when the City of New York its corporate welfare program in the late 1990s. Subsidization of corporations is not free market gentrification by definition, and in theory can be avoided by future communities attempting to keep creative local culture and businesses alive. Average monthly rents in Williamsburg can range from approximately $1,400 for a studio apartment to $1,600–2,400 for a one-bedroom and $2,600–4,000 for a two-bedroom. The price of land in Williamsburg has accelerated. The North Side, above Grand Street, which separates the North Side from the South Side, is somewhat more expensive, due to its proximity to the New York City Subway (specifically, the and on the BMT Canarsie Line and IND Crosstown Line, respectively).

More recent development and the route of the M train (whose route was modified to go from the downtown BMT Nassau Street Line to the mid-town IND Sixth Avenue Line in 2010), however, have prompted increases in rent prices south of Grand Street as well. Higher rents have driven many priced-out bohemians and artists to build new creative communities further afield in areas like Bushwick, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Cobble Hill, and Red Hook. On July 1, 2011, the United States Postal Service (USPS) split the 11211 zip code, due to a &quot;large increase in population and in the number of companies doing business in our area&quot;.

Williamsburg&#x27;s takeover by corporate development is the subject of Princeton University film professor Su Friedrich&#x27;s 2013 documentary &quot;Gut Renovation&quot;.

====Effect on borough&#x27;s court system====
In June 2014, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that northwestern Brooklyn&#x27;s growth of a wealthier population, especially in Williamsburg, has led to an increasing number of convictions against defendants in the borough&#x27;s criminal cases, as well as to reductions in plaintiff&#x27;s awards in civil cases. Brooklyn defense lawyer Julie Clark said that these new jurors are &quot;much more trusting of police&quot;. Another lawyer, Arthur Aidala, said:

==Demographics==
For census purposes, the New York City government classifies Williamsburg as part of two neighborhood tabulation areas: Williamsburg, and North Side/South Side. Based on data from the 2010 United States census, the combined population of the Williamsburg and North Side/South Side areas was 78,700, a change of 6,301 (8%) from the 72,399 counted in 2000.

==Environmental concerns==
&quot;El Puente&quot;, a local community development group, called Williamsburg &quot;the most toxic place to live in America&quot;, in the documentary &quot;Toxic Brooklyn&quot;, produced by Vice Magazine in 2009. Other rare cancer clusters in Willamsburg have been reported by the &quot;New York Post&quot;.

=== Brooklyn Navy Yard incinerator plan ===
In 1976, Mayor Abraham Beame proposed building a combined incinerator and power plant at the nearby Brooklyn Navy Yard. The project garnered large community opposition from the Latino and Hasidic Jewish residents of southern Williamsburg, located next to the site of the proposed incinerator. Though the New York City Board of Estimate narrowly gave its approval to the incinerator in 1984, the state refused to grant a permit for constructing the plant for several years, citing that the city had no recycling plan. The proposed incinerator was a key issue in the 1989 mayoral election because the Hasidic Jewish residents of Williamsburg who opposed the incinerator were also politically powerful. David Dinkins, who ultimately won the 1989 mayoral election, campaigned on the stance that the Brooklyn Navy Yard incinerator plan should be put on hold. The state denied a permit for the incinerator in 1989, stating that the city had no plan for reducing ash emissions from the plant.

The plan was placed on hold for several years, and in 1995, community members filed a lawsuit to block the incinerator&#x27;s construction. Further investigation of the incinerator&#x27;s proposed site found toxic chemicals were present in such high levels that the site qualified for Superfund environmental clean-up. The next year, the city dropped plans for the construction of the incinerator altogether.

===Bushwick Inlet Park site===
National Grid (formerly KeySpan) is remediating contamination at a former Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) site, located at Kent
Avenue, between North 11th and North 12th Streets, in Williamsburg. The Remediation is being performed in conversion for the site&#x27;s conversion into Bushwick Inlet Park. It is being implemented under an order of consent with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation entered into between the NYSDEC and KeySpan in February 2007.
There are also ten oil storage tanks on the site of Bushwick Inlet Park that were formerly operated by Bayside Oil. A plan unveiled in 2016, called &quot;Maker Park&quot;, would convert the oil tankers into attractions such as a theater and hanging gardens. It directly conflicted with the original plan for Bushwick Inlet Park, which would see the tankers demolished. The city stated that the oil tankers were heavily polluted, and that the site needed to be cleaned before it could be repurposed into a park.

<text>Anton (Anatole) P. Solomoukha ( 2 November 1945 – 21 October 2015) was a Ukrainian-born French artist and photographer, and a foreign member of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts. From 1980, he specialized in narrative figuration. After 2000, he developed photo projects and is known as the inventor of a new form of expression in contemporary photography: “Photo painting”. In it, he associates the photographic image with pictorial research in tableaux frequently requiring a multitude of models.

==Biography==
Solomoukha was born in Kyiv, Ukraine (then part of the USSR). His father, Pavel Davidovich Solomoukha, was a veteran of the Second World War. In 1943, following the liberation of Ukraine, he was given the job of recruiting and organizing the training of teachers in a department under the Secretariat of Nikita Khrushchev, who later became the first secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. His mother, Galina von Krigin, was a teacher.

After completing his secondary education and doing his military service, Solomoukha entered the Faculty for the Restoration of Icons in the Kyiv School of Fine Art. It was here that he familiarized himself with philosophy and religion. In 1971, Solomoukha was admitted to the studio workshop of the academician T. Yablonska, and in 1973, he obtained a diploma as a &#x27;Monumentalist&#x27; painter.

Between 1975 and 1978, his dissident creative expression attracted the attention of political censors, and he was summoned to appear before the KGB on several occasions.

In 1978, he succeeded in immigrating to France.

==Work==
===Painting===
Between 1978 and 1980, Solomoukha began a period of experimentation with various techniques and types of aesthetic formulas. A trip to the United States in 1978–1980 proved to be a decisive moment in his artistic career. In 1980, he exhibited in New York City, Boston, Cleveland, Washington, and Philadelphia. In 1981, 1982, and 1983, he was invited by violinist Gidon Kremer to be the stage designer at the Lockenhaus Chamber Music Festival in Austria. In 1985, his project &quot;Les Grands Mythes&quot; drew the attention of Cologne gallery owner Thomas Krings-Ernsta, and Solomoukha exhibited there regularly until 1989. In 1988, two paintings were acquired by Cologne&#x27;s Ludwig Museum for its French Collection.

===Photography===
In the 1990s, Solomoukha became interested in photography. In 1990, he was acquainted with Robert Doisneau, and in 1995, he began working with Henri Cartier-Bresson.

In 2009, Solomoukha continued to refer to classical art in his project &quot;Little Red Riding Hood visits Chernobyl&quot;.

<doc id="641406" wikidata="Q1339677" url="?curid=641406" title="Scout (sport)">
<text>In professional sports, scouts are experienced talent evaluators who travel extensively for the purposes of watching athletes play their chosen sports, and they determine whether their set of skills and talents represent what is needed by the scout&#x27;s organization. Some scouts are interested primarily in the selection of &quot;prospects;&quot; younger players who may require further development by the acquiring team, but who are judged to be worthy of that effort and expense for the potential future payoff that it could bring, while others concentrate on players who are already polished professionals, whose rights may be available soon, either through free agency or trading, and who are seen as filling a team&#x27;s specific need at a certain position. &quot;Advance scouts&quot; watch the teams that their teams are going to play in order to help determine strategy.

Many scouts are former coaches or retired players, while others have made a career just of being scouts. Skilled scouts who help to determine which players will fit in well with an organization can be the major difference between success and failure for the team with regard to wins and losses, which often relates directly to the organization&#x27;s financial success or lack thereof as well.

==Kinds of scouts==
Scouts tend to have to perform one of two tasks, either scouting opposition teams to research the opposition&#x27;s players and tactics, or scouting individual players to identify their level of skill and to keep track of potential new signings.

Contemporary Major League Baseball teams usually classify scouts and their differing responsibilities as follows:
*Advance scouts follow MLB clubs that their team is scheduled to play and file reports on trends and tendencies that influence pitching, defensive, offensive and game strategy.
*Major League scouts and professional scouts (the most senior of whom are sometimes called &quot;special assignment scouts&quot; or &quot;special assistants to the general manager&quot;) typically track active players under contract to other teams for potential acquisition. They also may support advance scouts or evaluate competing minor league organizations. Per their designation, the former follow players in MLB, while &quot;pro scouts&quot; work minor league and independent league baseball.
*Amateur scouts evaluate high school and college baseball players and prepare their MLB teams for the July amateur draft. To ensure that players are seen by multiple evaluators, amateur scouts are usually divided into area scouts, regional cross-checkers and national cross-checkers.
*International scouts cover players not from the United States, Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories, or Canada. These players are signed as international free agents and are not subject to the summer draft, although bonus amounts and signing regulations are governed by the collective bargaining agreement between MLB and its players&#x27; union. In addition to the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Mexico, and other Latin American and Caribbean countries, where MLB teams have had a scouting presence since the mid-20th century, the growth in international baseball has compelled most teams to station scouts in Japan, Korea and other Asian countries, Australia, and Europe. International scouting also involves cross-checking to enable multiple evaluators to validate the reports of local scouts.

According to Tony Lucadello, considered by some to be the greatest scout ever, the four kinds of scouts start with the letter &#x27;P&#x27;:

* Poor – wastes time looking for games rather than having a planned itinerary
* Picker – emphasizes a player&#x27;s one weakness to the neglect of all strengths and ignores the potential within
* Performance – bases his evaluation on what a player does in his presence
* Projector – envisions what a player will be able to do in two or three years

Lucadello estimated that five percent of scouts were poor, five percent pickers, 85 percent performance scouts and five percent projectors.

==Computer-aided scouting==
Modern day scouts are becoming more and more reliant on computer programs to aid and assist in the evaluation of talent being scouted. Many professional sport clubs now use computers to organize their collected information and data. Most sports still depend on human management to decide which players their organization will draft or sign.

<doc id="641408" wikidata="Q58156" url="?curid=641408" title="Saud bin Faisal Al Saud">
<text>Saud bin Faisal Al Saud (), also known as Saud Al Faisal (, &quot;Suʿūd Āl Fayṣal&quot;; 2 January 1940 – 9 July 2015), was a Saudi Arabian statesman and diplomat who served as the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia from 1975 to 2015. He was a member of the Saudi royal family, a son of King Faisal, and one of the grandsons of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s founder King Abdulaziz. He was the longest-serving foreign minister in world history.

==Early life, education and early career==

Saud bin Faisal was born in Taif on 2 January 1940. He was the second son of King Faisal and Iffat Al-Thunayan who was born to a Turkish family. He was the full brother of Sara bint Faisal, Mohammed bin Faisal, Latifa bint Faisal, Abdul Rahman bin Faisal, Bandar bin Faisal, Turki bin Faisal, Luluwah bint Faisal, and Haifa bint Faisal. 

Prince Saud attended the Hun School of Princeton and graduated from Princeton University in 1964 with a bachelor of arts in economics. In 2007, he told Ford Fraker, then US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, that during his studies at Princeton, he would like to leave the university and to return to the country. However, his father, Faisal, came to the campus and persuaded him to complete his education. 

Following his return to Saudi Arabia, Prince Saud became an economic consultant for the ministry of petroleum. In 1966, he moved to the general organization for petroleum and mineral resources, (Petromin). In February 1970, he became deputy governor of Petromin for planning affairs. He was also a member of the High Coordination Committee. In 1971, he became deputy minister of petroleum. Prince Saud served in this post at the oil ministry until 1975 when he was appointed as state minister for foreign affairs. He replaced Omar Al Saqqaf in the post who had died in November 1974.

==Foreign minister==
On 13 October 1975, King Khalid appointed Prince Saud as foreign minister. He was relieved from the post on 29 April 2015 due to health problems and was replaced by Adel al-Jubeir, a former Saudi ambassador to the United States.

===Timeline===
Prince Saud was well regarded in the diplomatic community. 

In 1978 and also in 1985, Prince Saud raised awareness in Britain of Soviet activity in the Horn of Africa. In May 1985, he officially visited Iran and meetings were focused on the annual pilgrimage of Iranians to Mecca. He asked Condoleezza Rice to focus on &quot;key substantive issues&quot; of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. He complained that US banks were auditing Saudi Embassy banks illegally. He asserted that auditors were &quot;inappropriate and aggressive&quot;. He also declared that the Saudi Embassy has diplomatic immunity.

Prince Saud said in 2004 that Saudi Arabia would like to reduce its dependence on U.S.-dominated security arrangements. In July 2004, he claimed the real source of problems in the Middle East were not Muslims but &quot;injustice and deprivation inflicted in the region&quot;. In August 2007, he denied allegations that terrorists were travelling from Saudi Arabia to Iraq and claimed it was vice versa.

On 10 March 2006, he met with Hamas leaders in Riyadh. In July 2006, he urged U.S. President George W. Bush to call for a ceasefire in the Lebanon bombing. In January 2008, he supported parliamentary elections in Pakistan. He indicated that Pakistan did not need &quot;overt, external interference&quot; to solve political division. He commended Nawaz Sharif as a stable bipartisan candidate.

In February 2010, he told General Jones to distinguish between friends and enemies in Pakistan rather than using indiscriminate military action. He insisted that Pakistan&#x27;s army must maintain its credibility. In November 2010, he led the Saudi delegation at the G-20 Summit.

In January 2011, he withdrew out of mediation efforts to reinstate a government in Lebanon. In March 2011, he went to Europe to rally support for Saudi Arabia&#x27;s intervention in Bahrain.

After the U.S. Gulf Cooperation Council forum at the GCC secretariat in Riyadh on 31 March 2012, he said it was a &quot;duty&quot; to arm the Syrian opposition and help them defend themselves against the daily bloody crackdown by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. Commenting on the fragile security situation, Prince Saud noted that: &quot;One of the most important causes is the continuation of the unresolved conflict as well as the continuation of the Israeli aggression policy against the Palestinians. &quot;We have discussed, in the meeting, many issues, especially the heinous massacre against the Syrian people. We also discussed the latest developments in Yemen, and reviewed the overall developments and political situation in the Persian Gulf region, the Middle East and North Africa, as well as their repercussions on the security and stability of the region and the world,&quot; Prince Saud said.

===Iran and Lebanon===
Rather than military action on Iran, Saud Al Faisal called for tougher sanctions such as travel bans and further bank lending restrictions. He stated that U.S. foreign policy has tilted more power for Iran. He compared the Iranian influence in Iraq with Iranian influence in Lebanon. He commended positive developments by Iran such as its influence over Hezbollah to end street protests.

In early 2011, he expressed fear of the &quot;dangerous&quot; instability in Lebanon after the fall of the government led by Saad Hariri. He also stated that Lebanon&#x27;s ability to establish peaceful coexistence with so many different groups may be a significant loss in the Arab world if the nation failed in creating a government.

In May 2014, it was reported that Prince Saud had invited Iran&#x27;s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to visit Riyadh, breaking the ice in one of the most hostile relationships in the Middle East ahead of key talks on Iran&#x27;s nuclear program in Vienna. Speaking to reporters in the Saudi capital, Foreign Minister Prince Saud said the kingdom was ready to host the Iranian Foreign Minister &quot;anytime he sees fit&quot; and indicated that Riyadh was willing to open negotiations with its nemesis on the many combustible issues dividing them.

==Other governmental activities==
Starting in 1998, under the reign of King Fahd, Saud bin Faisal and the then Crown Prince Abdullah managed the energy sector through a committee of technocrats and princes. More specifically, Prince Saud was appointed chairman of the Saudi Aramco&#x27;s committee charged with the project assessment in September 1999.

On 20 November 2009, King Abdullah appointed Prince Saud as the chairman of the influential supreme economic council of Saudi Arabia. Prince Saud was also a member of the military service council.

===Views===
Saudi foreign policy was designed by the King, not by the foreign minister. Prince Saud worked closely with King Khalid, King Fahd and King Abdullah.

Prince Saud was firmly anti-Soviet and was an Arab nationalist. When asked in 1979 if there was an alliance with the US regarding military cooperation, he stated that Saudi Arabia had no such alliance with the US, but with other Arab and Muslim countries. 

He was more resistant to Israeli proposals than King Fahd. He lamented his legacy might be defined &quot;by profound disappointment than by success&quot;. He regretted how his generation of leaders failed to create a Palestinian state. He encouraged Iraqis to defend their country&#x27;s sovereignty.

In the Saudi royal court, his relationship with King Fahd was strained, but he was one of King Abdullah&#x27;s closest allies. He was among the Saudi officials who worked to improve Saudi Arabia&#x27;s international image and maintain its strong relationship with the United States after the September 11 attacks.

==Personal life==

Prince Saud was married to his cousin Jawhara bint Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman, and they have three sons and three daughters. His sons are Mohammad, Khaled and Fahd, and his daughters are Haifa, Lana and Reem. Haifa bint Saud is married to Prince Sultan bin Salman and is a professor of English literature working at King Saud University. 

Prince Saud lived in Jeddah. Unlike other members of the Al Saud, he often spoke publicly and interacted with reporters. He spoke several languages, including English, Turkish, Spanish, Hebrew, French, Italian and German. He liked to play tennis. 

===Business activities and properties===
Prince Saud is one of the Saudi royals mentioned in Panama Papers due to his offshore accounts. In the US, he had a house in Los Angeles&#x27;s the Beverly Hills Post Office neighborhood which he built in 1983.

===Social roles===
Prince Saud was involved in philanthropy. He was a founding member of the King Faisal Foundation and served as chairman of the board of directors for the King Faisal School and Al Faisal University in Riyadh. He was also a member of the Society for Disabled Children and the Madinah Society for Welfare and Social Services.

===Illness and death===
Prince Saud suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease and back pain. He had surgery in the United States. His physical appearance showed signs of health deterioration, especially difficulty standing upright. On 11 August 2012, he had another surgery to remove a &quot;simple&quot; blockage in the intestines due to adhesions resulting from previous surgery. The operation was performed at the Specialist Hospital in Jeddah. Prince Saud went to Los Angeles after he left the hospital on 6 September 2012. The ministry announced that he would stay there for a while. On 25 January 2015, Prince Saud had a successful spine surgery in the U.S. In March 2015, he was photographed using a walking frame. With age, Saud faced many health problems, suffering from chronic back pain and having had various surgeries.

Prince Saud died on 9 July 2015 at the age of 75 in Los Angeles. His funeral prayer was held in Grand Mosque in Mecca on 12 July 2015, and he was buried in Al Adl cemetery.

<doc id="641419" wikidata="Q207974" url="?curid=641419" title="Showbiz (Muse album)">
<text>Showbiz is the debut studio album by the English rock band Muse, released on 7 September 1999 through Taste Media. It was released in various other regions under different labels, including Naïve in France, Motor in Germany, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, Maverick in the United States, Play It Again Sam (PIAS) in Benelux, and Avex Trax in Japan. 

Recorded between April and May 1999 at RAK Studios and Sawmills Studio, &quot;Showbiz&quot; was produced by Muse, John Leckie and Paul Reeve. &quot;Uno&quot;, &quot;Cave&quot;, &quot;Muscle Museum&quot;, &quot;Sunburn&quot; and &quot;Unintended&quot; were released as singles. 

&quot;Showbiz&quot; drew mainly positive reviews and reaching number 29 on the UK Albums Chart. As of 2018, it had sold more than 1.2 million copies worldwide.

==Background and recording==
&quot;Showbiz&quot; was recorded between April 1999 and May 1999. However, the album included some older songs in Muse&#x27;s repertoire, many of which can date as far back as 1996. Most of the songs on &quot;Showbiz&quot; had already been written at least by 1997. The songs featured on the album were among the &quot;fifty or so&quot; that Matt Bellamy had written before entering the studio. The band selected the songs which they deemed to be the more conventional and &quot;straight-forward&quot; to make up &quot;Showbiz&quot;. While the songs contain an eclectic and diverse sound featuring subtle classical, jazz, blues, Latin, and world music influences, they have a distinct and cohesive alternative rock aesthetic. The more experimental material was left out of the album to be included as B-sides in the single releases. A few of those songs were later featured on the compilation album &quot;Hullabaloo Soundtrack&quot;.

John Leckie, the producer of the album, started attending Muse&#x27;s concerts in the latter half of 1998. Leckie was based at Sawmills recording studio, where the owner Dennis Smith had given the band free recording time the previous year, from which the &quot;Muse EP&quot; had resulted in 1998. He built up a relationship with the band during this time, coming to say that he&#x27;d &quot;want to work with the band if ever they could afford him&quot;. Leckie had not worked with many bands for quite some time prior to doing so with Muse. The recording was finished by 15 May 1999.

==Artwork==
The sleeve design was criticised by Muse biographer Ben Myers, who wrote that it was &quot;just plain strange. Ill-advised. Tacky, even&quot; and &quot;recalled the sort of artwork that Eighties prog-rock revivalists like Marillion used or, worse still, the doodlings of a sci-fi obsessed A-Level art student&quot; instead of &quot;the work of an exciting, new, distinctly modern band.&quot;

==Reception==

&quot;Showbiz&quot; drew mainly positive reviews. Several critics drew comparisons to Radiohead. Leckie, who also produced Radiohead&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;The Bends,&quot; dismissed the comparisons, saying: &quot;In the late 90s, any British band that sang passionately and played guitar was going to get compared to Radiohead.&quot; He said he chose to produce Muse after Radiohead because he had &quot;intentionally looked for something different&quot;.

Neva Chonin of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;Showbiz&quot; &quot;matches Thom Yorke&#x27;s penchant for majestic agony – screams and the word self-destruction pepper the title track – but with an edge that&#x27;s quirkier and decidedly more ragged than their elders&quot;. Brent DiCrescenzo of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; said in his review that &quot;Muse expertly boil down Radiohead into punkish radio nuggets&quot;, but asked: &quot;Despite this promise, where can they go from here?&quot; In a less favourable review, &quot;NME&quot; said that &quot;&quot;Showbiz&quot; is not as clever as they think it is ... &#x27;Unintended&#x27; and the title track are overwrought, prone to excruciatingly bad pseudo poetry&quot;. Edna Gundersen of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote that the album &quot;offers smart, seductive rock that&#x27;s sophisticated but not stuffy, fun but not frilly&quot;, and that the songs &quot;get a boost from the handsome voice of Matthew Bellamy, who builds tension by vocally snowballing from a hushed intensity to full-throttle wails&quot;.

<text>An action hero (sometimes action heroine for women) is the protagonist of an action film or other form of entertainment which portrays action, adventure, and often violence. Action heroes are depicted in exciting or perilous chase sequences, fights, shootouts, explosions, and stunt work. Other media in which such heroes appear include swashbuckler films, Western films, old-time radio, adventure novels, dime novels, pulp magazines, and folklore.

==History==
The origin of the action hero is rooted in the history of imperialism with adventure stories being primarily written for boys, to imagine being men on travels and experiencing exciting action. Shawn Shimpach wrote, &quot;The young, white men who were (or became) the aggrandized subjects of these stories motivated the narratives through their penchant for action and resolved conflict through violence informed by grit, wits, and innate skill, securing, in each story, the future of the world for which they were responsible and in the process confirming their masculine identity.&quot; In the early twentieth century, this storytelling was commercialized, and the stories were &quot;readily adapted&quot; to film. One of the earliest action-hero actors was Douglas Fairbanks. In the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Donald Liebenson wrote, &quot;Douglas Fairbanks was Hollywood&#x27;s first major action hero, best known for the costume epics that established him as the screen&#x27;s most dashing swashbuckler.&quot; One of the defining action-hero characters played by Fairbanks was Zorro, which Michael Sragow called &quot;the most influential action figure in film history and the happiest movie warrior of all time&quot;. Fairbanks was followed by Errol Flynn, who achieved fame as Robin Hood in the 1938 film &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;.

In the middle of the twentieth century, &quot;...the action genre was predictably populated by suave, attractive heroes living adventures of thrilling, exotic excitement, unimpeded by (if clearly aligned to) national, cultural, or state borders.&quot; When television became commonplace, shows that featured action heroes included &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; (1952–1958), &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1961–1969), &quot;The Saint&quot; (1962–1969), &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (1964–1968), &quot;Batman&quot; (1966–1968), and &quot;&quot; (1966–1973). Shimpach said they &quot;offered up extraordinary (if not always completely serious) white men who resolved conflict through direct action and violence while displaying their effortless mastery of urban spaces, new technologies, fashion, and their own bodies.&quot;

<doc id="641435" wikidata="Q431622" url="?curid=641435" title="Dock landing ship">
<text>A dock landing ship (also called landing ship, dock or LSD) is an amphibious warfare ship with a well dock to transport and launch landing craft and amphibious vehicles. Some ships with well decks, such as the Soviet Ivan Rogov class, also have bow doors to enable them to deliver vehicles directly onto a beach (like a tank landing ship). Modern dock landing ships also operate helicopters.

A ship with a well deck (docking well) can transfer cargo to landing craft in rougher seas far more easily than a ship which has to use cranes or a stern ramp. The U.S. Navy hull classification symbol for a ship with a well deck depends on its facilities for aircraft—a (modern) LSD has a helicopter deck, a landing platform dock also has a hangar, and a landing helicopter dock or landing helicopter assault has a full-length flight deck.

==History==
The LSD (U.S. Navy hull classification for landing ship, dock) came as a result of a British requirement during the Second World War for a vessel that could carry large landing craft across the seas at speed. The predecessor of all modern LSDs is of the Imperial Japanese Army, which could launch her infantry landing craft using an internal rail system and a stern ramp. She entered service in 1935 and saw combat in China and during the initial phase of Japanese offenses during 1942.

The first LSD of the Royal Navy came from a design by Sir Roland Baker who had designed the British landing craft tank. It was an answer to the problem of launching small craft rapidly. The landing ship stern chute, which was a converted train ferry (Train Ferry No. 1 which had been built for British Army use in the First World War), was an early attempt. Thirteen landing craft mechanized (LCM) could be launched from these ships down the chute. The landing ship gantry was a converted tanker with a crane to transfer its cargo of landing craft from deck to sea—15 LCM in a little over half an hour.

The design was developed and built in the U.S. for the U.S. Navy and the Royal Navy. The LSD could carry 36 LCM at . It took one and a half hours for the dock to be flooded down and two and half to pump it out. When flooded they could also be used as docks for repairs to small craft. Smaller landing craft could be carried in the hold as could full-tracked and wheeled amphibious assault or support vehicles.


==Vessels==
In the U.S. Navy, two related groups of vessels classified as LSDs are in service as of 2023, the and es, mainly used to carry hovercraft (LCACs), operate helicopters, and carry Marines.

The British Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) operates three s based on the Dutch-Spanish Enforcer design in support of the Royal Navy&#x27;s operations, while a fourth ship of the class—previously in RFA service—is now operated by the Royal Australian Navy.

Former U.S. LSDs include the , , , and .

<text>The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan (Urdu: آئین پاکستان میں چودہویں ترمیم) was an amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan passed in 1997, during the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, leader of the Pakistan Muslim League party. It subjected Members of Parliament to very strict party discipline. Party leaders received unlimited power to dismiss any of their legislators from Parliament if they spoke or voted against their party. The fourteenth amendment to the constitution of Pakistan was to prevent the switching of parties to form a strong coalition government or to become a strong opposition. 

Since Nawaz&#x27; party had an overwhelming majority in Parliament, the Fourteenth Amendment effectively prevented the Prime Minister from being dismissed by a &quot;no confidence&quot; vote. A few months earlier, the Thirteenth Amendment took away the President&#x27;s reserve power to remove a Prime Minister by dissolving Parliament and calling new elections. The amendments removed nearly all checks and balances on the Prime Minister&#x27;s power, since there was virtually no way he could be legally dismissed.

In Pakistan, once legislators are elected to national or provincial assemblies, there is no way for the people to recall them before the end of their five-year terms. In the past, this has contributed to a sense of immunity on the part of members of the ruling party, and to rampant corruption among leading politicians. The Fourteenth Amendment increased this perception, and contributed to the overwhelming popular support for General Pervez Musharraf&#x27;s coup in 1999. The Supreme Court subsequently validated the coup on the grounds that the Thirteenth and Fourteenth amendments created a situation for which there was no constitutional remedy.

<text>The Boeing X-32 is a concept demonstrator aircraft that was designed for the Joint Strike Fighter competition. It lost to the Lockheed Martin X-35 demonstrator, which was further developed into the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.

==Development==

===Background===
In 1993, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched the Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter project (CALF). The project&#x27;s purpose was to develop a stealth-enabled design to replace all of United States Department of Defense lighter weight fighter and attack aircraft, including the F-16 Fighting Falcon, McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, and vertical/short takeoff / vertical landing (V/STOL) AV-8B Harrier II. Around the same time, the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) project was started and in 1994, the U.S. Congress ordered the two to be merged into one program under the JAST name, which was renamed the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program in 1995.

Many companies took part in the first phase of this project, which involved drafting concept aircraft designs for submission to the Department of Defense. On 16 November 1996, Boeing and Lockheed Martin were awarded contracts for them to produce two of their concept demonstrator aircraft (CDA) each. Under the contract, these fighters were required to demonstrate conventional take-off and landing (CTOL), carrier take-off and landing (CV version), and short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL). They were also expected to include ground demonstrations of a production representative aircraft&#x27;s systems, such as the Preferred Weapon System Concept (PWSC).

One major departure from previous projects was the prohibition of the companies from using their own money to finance development. Each was awarded $750 million to produce their two aircraft – including avionics, software and hardware. This limitation promoted the adoption of low cost manufacturing and assembly techniques, and also prevented either Boeing or Lockheed Martin from bankrupting themselves in an effort to win such an important contest.

===Designing the X-32===
Boeing&#x27;s strategy for a competitive advantage was to offer substantially lower manufacturing and life-cycle costs by minimizing variations between the different JSF versions. The X-32 therefore was designed around a large one piece carbon fiber composite delta wing. The wing had a span of 9.15 meters, with a 55-degree leading edge sweep, and could hold up to 20,000 pounds (9,000 kg) of fuel. The purpose of the high sweep angle was to allow for a thick wing section to be used while still providing limited transonic aerodynamic drag, and to provide a good angle for wing-installed conformal antenna equipment. The wing would prove a challenge to fabricate.

The compete-on-cost strategy also led Boeing to pick a direct-lift thrust vectoring system, for the Marines&#x27; short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) requirement, as this would only necessitate the addition of a thrust vectoring module around the main engine. However, this choice required the engine to be mounted directly behind the cockpit, and moved the center of gravity forward from its usual position in jet fighters (towards the rear of the airplane) to enable a neutral-attitude hover. Boeing had proposed, in the 1960s, a similar supersonic fighter with a mid-center-of-gravity mounted engine with vectored thrust nozzles, but this never proceeded beyond pictures published in &quot;Aviation Week&quot;. By comparison, the Lockheed entry looked like, if anything, a smaller version of the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter. Yet another effect of the selection of the direct-lift system was the large chin-mounted air intake. This was required to feed sufficient air to the main engine (to provide the thrust necessary to hover) during the zero horizontal velocity phase, when it could not exploit ram-air pressure. A knock-on effect of this large intake was the potential direct visibility of the compressor blades to radar (see radar cross-section). Mitigation possibilities included variable baffles designed to block incoming radio waves without adversely affecting airflow.

===Design changes===
The two X-32 aircraft featured a delta wing design. However, eight months into construction of the concept demonstrator aircraft, the JSF&#x27;s maneuverability and payload requirements were refined at the request of the Navy and Boeing&#x27;s delta wing design fell short of the new targets. Engineers altered the aircraft&#x27;s design with a conventional canted twin tail that reduced weight and improved agility, but it was too late to change the demonstrator aircraft. It was judged that they would be sufficient to demonstrate Boeing&#x27;s technology.

On 14 December 1999, Boeing unveiled both its concept demonstrators at its plant in Palmdale, California, in front of 5,500 attendees. While the X-32A was expected to make an appearance, the roll out of the X-32B was a surprise, as construction of the latter aircraft had started some three months after the former and was completed six weeks after the X-32A. Boeing attributed the rapid construction of the STOVL version to the use of digital design and assembly methods. After having the Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 engine installed in April 2000, the X-32A commenced low- and medium-speed taxi tests, which had been completed by late May.

==Flight testing==
Due to the heavy delta wing design of the X-32, Boeing demonstrated STOVL and supersonic flight in separate configurations, with the STOVL configuration requiring that some parts be removed from the fighter. The company promised that their conventional tail design for production models would not require separate configurations. By contrast, the Lockheed Martin X-35 concept demonstrator aircraft were capable of transitioning between their STOVL and supersonic configurations in mid-flight.

The first flight of the X-32A (designed for CTOL and carrier trials) took place on 18 September 2000, from Boeing&#x27;s Palmdale plant to Edwards Air Force Base. The aircraft, piloted by Boeing test pilot Fred Knox, took of runway before becoming airborne at at around 8:00 am. Shortly after takeoff, a minor hydraulic leak was discovered and the flight was shortened to 20 minutes from the expected 30–40 minutes. According to Knox, the F/A-18 chase plane required &quot;a lot of afterburner&quot; to keep up with the X-32 during the initial stages. During the flight, the aircraft reached , attained a speed of , and attained an angle of attack of 13°. Despite the shortened flight, about 80% of the planned test points were accomplished. It was powered by a conventional derivative of the F-22 afterburning turbofan, designated F119-PW-614C.

On 29 March 2001, the X-32B STOVL version made its first flight. The flight lasted 50 minutes as the aircraft flew from Palmdale to Edwards AFB. The flight had originally been scheduled for the third quarter of 2000. A modified version of the -614C engine, known as the F119-PW-614S, powered the STOVL aircraft. In normal flight, the -614S was configured as a conventional afterburning turbofan. However, in the STOVL mode a butterfly valve diverted the core stream exhaust gases to a pair of thrust vectoring nozzles located close to the aircraft&#x27;s center-of-gravity. Forward of these nozzles, a jet screen nozzle provided a sheet of cool bypass air to minimise hot gas recirculation. There was also a pair of ducts leading to roll nozzles near the wing tips. Two pairs of ducts fed the aft-pitch yaw nozzles and the forward-pitch nozzles. The afterburner was unlit, with no gas flow during lift. The X-32B achieved STOVL flight in much the same way as the AV-8B Harrier II with thrust vectoring of the jet exhaust. A smooth transition (between STOVL and normal modes) was obtained by maintaining a constant engine match, facilitated by the control system algorithm maintaining a fixed total nozzle effective area. Thus the engine was unaware of various nozzles being opened up and closed off to complete the transition.

The F119-PW-614S was a direct lift engine, whereas the Lockheed Martin STOVL team used a more complex and riskier alternative, known as the F119-PW-611, which comprised a remote shaft-driven lift fan powered by the main engine. However, this generated more lift thrust than possible with only direct exhaust gases. A successful design would have greater payload, and thus longer range than a simple thrust vectored turbofan. Flight testing of both companies&#x27; aircraft continued until July 2001.

===JSF competition===

On 26 October 2001, the Department of Defense announced that the Lockheed Martin X-35 had won the JSF competition. The X-35 would be developed into the production Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.

The loss of the JSF contract to Lockheed Martin in 2001 was a major blow to Boeing, as it represented the most important international fighter aircraft project since the Lightweight Fighter program competition of the 1960s and 1970s, which had led to the F-16 Fighting Falcon and F/A-18 Hornet. At the time, the production run of the JSF was estimated at anywhere between 3,000 and 5,000. Prior to the awarding of the contract, many lawmakers pushed the idea of retaining the losing competitor as a sub-contractor; however, the &quot;winner takes all&quot; principle was not changed. Nonetheless, Boeing views its work on the X-32 as a strategic investment, yielding important technologies which it has been able to adopt in the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and other studies.

==Surviving aircraft==

In 2005, the Boeing X-32A was transferred to the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio. Its condition deteriorated due to being outside for several years following the end of the JSF competition. In December 2023, the museum completed a three-month-long restoration of the aircraft. On 31 May 2024, the X-32A was moved into the R&amp;D gallery as a display, parked close to the similarly ill-fated YF-23 &quot;Black Widow II&quot;.

The X-32B was transferred to the Patuxent River Naval Air Museum adjacent to NAS Patuxent River in St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland in 2005. It underwent restoration at the museum&#x27;s restoration facility in June 2009 and was placed on display outdoors, where it has suffered from severe deterioration due to exposure to the elements.

<text>&quot;John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt&quot; is a traditional children&#x27;s song which consists of one verse repeated, each time increasing or decreasing in volume or tempo.

==Lyrics and melody==
There are various lyrics to the song. For example (in the following version) the verse is first repeated normally (followed with the last line &quot;Da-da-da&quot;). The volume verses are repeated four times (often while altering the volume or pitch). If the volume is lowered, the last line (the &quot;Da-da-da!&quot;) often remains constant, shouted even as the rest of the song reduces to a whisper. The verse is repeated four times --through a whisper on the fourth and final-- but the closing (the &quot;Da-da-da!&quot;) is always louder.

&lt;/score&gt;

==Origin==
While the origins of the song are obscure, some evidence places its roots with vaudeville and theatre acts of the late 19th century and early 20th century popular in immigrant communities. Some vaudeville acts during the era, such as the work of Joe Weber and Lew Fields, often gave voice to shared frustrations of German-American immigrants and heavily leaned on malapropisms and difficulties with the English language as a vehicle for their humor. &quot;John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt&quot; shares many characteristics with &quot;My Name Is Jan Jansen&quot;, a song that can trace its origin to Swedish vaudeville in the late 19th century.

The song appears to have already become widely known by the mid-twentieth century. It received a major boost when it was circulated throughout the country during scout troop gatherings in the late 1920s and early 1930s. In 1926, &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper of Munster, Indiana, printed that, during a Girl Scout outing, the scouts sat around a camp fire and &quot;it was solemnly announced that John Jacob Jingleheimer Smith after a long and useful life had died from overwork on the way to Whiting. He was buried with due ceremony and his ghost is not to be seen until October first. All the favorite camp songs were sung.&quot; In 1927, the &quot;Portsmouth Daily Times&quot; reported that a group of boys from the state YMCA camp sang several camp songs, including &quot;John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.&quot; In 1931, Elmira, New York, newspaper the &quot;Star-Gazette&quot; reported that at a Boy Scout gathering at Seneca Lake, as scouts entered the mess hall, &quot;Troop 18 soon burst into the first camp song, &#x27;John Jacob Jingleheimer Smith&#x27;.&quot; A 1941 &quot;Milwaukee Journal&quot; article also refers to the song, with the same alternate title of &quot;John Jacob Jingleheimer Smith.&quot;

The song is indefinitely repetitive, in a similar manner to &quot;The Song That Never Ends&quot;, &quot;Yon Yonson&quot; or &quot;Michael Finnegan.&quot;

Versions of the song appear in other languages, such as the Spanish rendition, &quot;Juan Paco Pedro de la Mar&quot;.

<text>Um (), also spelled as Uhm, Eom, Eum, Ohm or Om, is a relatively uncommon surname in Korea. It is written using the same character as the Chinese surname, Yan (嚴). It has only one clan, the Yeongwol Eom clan, based in Yeongwol, Gangwon Province. According to the 2015 census in South Korea, there were 144,425 people carrying the Eom surname.

==History==
Eom is a surname that originated from China. The founding ancestor, Eom Im-ui (hangul: 엄림의; hanja: 嚴林義), was sent to Korea by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, during Gyeongdeok of Silla&#x27;s reign. He was said to be a descendant of the Han dynasty scholar, Yan Ziling (嚴子陵), known as Eom Ja-neung in Korean (엄자능). 

A member of the Eom family, , became one of the royal consorts of King Seongjong of Joseon, but was later murdered by his successor, King Yeonsangun. Another member of this family became the consort of King Gojong, becoming the mother of the last crown prince of the Korean Empire, Yi Un.

<text>The uncia (Latin; ) was a Roman currency worth one twelfth of an &quot;as&quot;.

==Republican coin==
By derivation, it was also the name of a bronze coin valued at of an &quot;as&quot; made during the Roman Republic. The &quot;uncia&quot; started as a Roman-Oscan weight of 22.75 grams for a 273 gram pound, with Attic weight issues of about 27 grams under the libral standard for a 327 gram pound and was produced occasionally towards the beginning of Roman cast bronze coinage. Obverse types of the &quot;uncia&quot; include a knucklebone ( BC), a barleycorn ( BC), and the helmeted bust of Roma (from ).

==Empire coin==
In imperial times the &quot;uncia&quot; was briefly revived under Trajan (98–117) and Hadrian (117–138). This coin was about in diameter and weighed about . It featured the bust of the emperor on the obverse with no inscription and &quot;SC&quot; (for &quot;Senatu Consulto&quot;) in a wreath on the reverse. If this issue belonged to the imperial system, meaning it was not a provincial piece, it would be an &quot;uncia&quot;. This issue may have been made only for circulation in the East.

<doc id="641446" wikidata="Q1812570" url="?curid=641446" title="Duke of Chandos">
<text>The Dukedom of Chandos was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. The Chandos peerage was first created as a barony by Edward III in 1337; its second creation in 1554 was due to the Brydges family&#x27;s service to Mary I during Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion, when she also gave them Sudeley Castle. The 9th Baron of the second creation was elevated to the dukedom in 1719, but after his grandson&#x27;s death without male heirs, his titles all became extinct (the 1337 creation having previously become abeyant in 1602 upon the death of the 3rd Baron of the second creation without male issue).

==History==
A Robert de Chandos went to Ireland with King John in 1185. His son Roger in 1221 received licence to hold a fair at Fownhope in 1221. The son of this Roger, another Robert de Chandos (d. 1302), participated in the Welsh expedition of Edward I. The son of Robert, Roger de Chandos, served in the Scottish wars of Edward II and received a knighthood. In 1321, he was sheriff of Herefordshire. He was succeeded by Thomas de Chandos.

Thomas was succeeded by his brother Roger de Chandos (&quot;Rogerus de Chaundos&quot;). Roger was made knight banneret by Edward III. It was this Roger who was summoned to Parliament, and who was cited as Baron de Chandos between 1337 (11th year of Edward III) and 1355, counting as the first creation of the title. Roger was succeeded by his son Thomas, who was in turn succeeded by his son John. Neither of these were summoned to Parliament, and are thus not named Baron Chandos explicitly, but counted as &quot;de jure&quot; 2nd and 3rd Barons Chandos, respectively. John, who defended Hereford Castle against Owain Glyndŵr in 1403, died without issue in 1428. The Chandos estates in Herefordshire passed to the surviving daughter of John&#x27;s sister Elizabeth, wife of Nicholas Mattesden, and eventually to his great nephew Giles Brugge, &quot;de jure&quot; 4th Baron Chandos (son of Edward Brugge and Alice de Berkeley, whose mother was Margaret de Chandos). He became father to Thomas Brugge, 5th Baron Chandos (d. 1493). Thomas&#x27; son, Giles Brugge, 6th Baron Chandos (d. 1511), held the office of High Sheriff of Gloucestershire for 1499.


The son of Giles Brugge, John Brydges (d. 1557), was summoned to Parliament for Gloucestershire at some point before 1554. In 1554, he was given Sudeley Castle and created &quot;Baron Chandos&quot;, &quot;of Sudeley in the county of Gloucester&quot;, by Queen Mary I, in the second creation of the title.

The three succeeding barons were all Members of Parliament and persons of some importance—particularly Grey, 5th Baron, and his elder son George, 6th Baron. George had six daughters but no sons, and after the death of his brother William in 1676 the barony came to a kinsman, Sir James Brydges, Bart., who was English ambassador to Constantinople from 1680 to 1685.

The eighth baron&#x27;s eldest son, James Brydges (1674–1744), succeeded his father as ninth Baron Chandos in 1714. In the same year, he was created Earl of Carnarvon (second creation) and Duke of Chandos in 1719. Subsidiary titles included &quot;Marquess of Carnarvon&quot; (1719) and &quot;Viscount Wilton&quot; (1714). All of these titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain.

The 1st Duke built an exceptionally grand country house called Cannons in Little Stanmore, Middlesex, that, though it was parodied in his lifetime, was a seat of great learning and culture: Handel was the resident composer from 1717 until 1719. Brydges&#x27; Cannons was demolished after his death, to pay the debts he incurred in the South Sea Bubble disaster, and by his son. It was replaced by a modest villa built by William Hallett, and Cannons is now occupied by North London Collegiate School, whose archives contain some information on the duke, his second wife Cassandra Willoughby, and subsequent owners of Cannons. Author Jane Austen was descended from his sister Mary.

With the death of the third duke in 1789, the titles became extinct, and the barony became dormant. An attempt was made by Samuel Egerton Brydges to claim the barony, initially on behalf of his older brother Edward Tymewell Brydges and then on his own behalf. Litigation lasted from 1790 to 1803 before the claims were rejected, but Egerton Brydges continued to style himself &quot;per legem terrae Baron Chandos of Sudeley&quot;. It seems likely that not only was the claim groundless but that the evidence was forged.

==List of title holders==
===Barons Chandos, first creation (1337)===
The title is spelt &#x27;Chaundos&#x27; in the Complete Peerage.
*Roger de Chandos, 1st Baron Chandos (d. 1353) was probably 1st Lord Chandos.
*Thomas Chandos, 2nd Baron Chandos (c. 1333–1375) (claimant)
*John Chandos, 3rd Baron Chandos (c. 1349–1428) (claimant) (peerage abeyant 1428)
*Giles Brugge, 4th Baron Chandos (1396–1467) (abeyance terminated 1458, on the death of his cousin)
*Thomas Brugge, 5th Baron Chandos &quot;de jure&quot; (1427–30 January 1493)
*Giles Brugge, 6th Baron Chandos (c. 1462–1 December 1511)

Most sources read that the title became extinct upon the death of the 1st Lord, although others, such as the Complete Peerage, include the further holders listed above. The presumed 2nd Lord Chandos was High Sheriff of Herefordshire for 1359, 1370 and 1372 and the presumed 3rd Lord Chandos served the same office for 1382.

===Barons Chandos, second creation (1554)===
*John Brydges, 1st Baron Chandos (1492–1557) is sometimes listed as &quot;de jure&quot; 7th Lord Chandos of the 1337 creation Son of 6th Baron of the preceding creation.
*Edmund Brydges, 2nd Baron Chandos (bef. 1522–1573) eldest son of the 1st Baron
*Giles Brydges, 3rd Baron Chandos (1548–1594), elder son of the 2nd Baron, died without male issue
*William Brydges, 4th Baron Chandos (c. 1552–1602), younger son of the 2nd Baron
*Grey Brydges, 5th Baron Chandos (c. 1581–1621), only son of the 4th Baron
*George Brydges, 6th Baron Chandos (1620–1655), elder son of the 5th Baron, died without male issue
*William Brydges, 7th Baron Chandos (d. 1676), younger son of the 5th Baron, died without male issue
*James Brydges, 8th Baron Chandos (1642–1714), great-great-grandson of the 1st Baron
*James Brydges, 9th Baron Chandos (1673–1744; created Earl of Carnarvon in 1714 and Duke of Chandos in 1719)
*Paul Stuart Lewis Yates, 10th Baron Chandos (1988) (claimant / &quot;De jure)&quot; (from the 1st creation)

===Dukes of Chandos (1719)===
*James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos (1673–1744), eldest son of the 8th Baron
**John Brydges, Marquess of Carnarvon (1703–1727), elder son of the 1st Duke, died without male issue
*Henry Brydges, 2nd Duke of Chandos (1708–1771), younger son of the 1st Duke
*James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos (1731–1789), only son of the 2nd Duke, died without male issue. His titles, other than the Lordship of Kinloss, became extinct.
:&quot;The 3rd Duke&#x27;s son-in-law, the 2nd Marquess of Buckingham, was created Duke of Buckingham and Chandos in 1822.&quot;

<text>The Six Hills are a collection of Roman barrows situated alongside the old Great North Road on Six Hills Common in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England. They are classed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and are protected by law. They form the largest surviving Roman barrow group in England. Beside their historical significance, they lend their name to an important thoroughfare in the town (Six Hills Way) and are a local landmark.

==History==

For almost two thousand years, travellers along the Roman road that eventually became the Great North Road have passed these six large mounds. Their origin and purpose has been the subject of much speculation.

Local legend holds that they were the work of the Devil, who, sitting one day looking down on the Great North Road, began to amuse himself by heaving clods of earth at the passers-by. He missed six times and in a temper threw a seventh clod over his shoulder, hitting the spire of Graveley church and knocking it askew. The spire is crooked to this day. The holes in Whomerley Wood show where the Devil dug out his missiles, and the six failed shots lie in a line alongside the road and form the Six Hills.

The Six Hills are almost certainly Roman burial mounds, dating from about 100 A.D., and probably mark the cremated remains of a wealthy local family. The ashes would have been placed in a container along with objects for use in the next world.

No recent scientific archaeological excavation has been carried out on the Hills, but they have all been dug into in the past. These early investigations found only &quot;...a few pieces of wood and a piece of iron...&quot;, which were dismissed at the time, but probably were the remains of the original burials. Other reports of damage include the farmer who was carting soil away from the Hills in 1750, and an attempted widening of the Great North Road in about 1820. Over the years, the Hills have all lost over in height.

The grass around the burial mounds is of considerable age. It includes species such as bird&#x27;s-foot trefoil, mouse-ear hawkweed, harebells, whitlow grass, and slender clover, which are not found in the more modern grasslands nearby.

<text>The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan (Urdu: آئین پاکستان میں تیرہویں ترمیم) was a short-lived amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan, adopted by the Parliament of Pakistan in 1997 by the civilian government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. It stripped the President of Pakistan of his reserve power to dissolve the National Assembly, and thereby triggering new elections and dismissing the Prime Minister. The Constitutional Amendment was supported by both the government and the opposition, and was thus passed unanimously. With the enforcing of this amendment, Pakistan&#x27;s system of government was shifted from Semi-presidential system to Parliamentary democratic republic system.

The amendment removed Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution, which gave the President the power to:
In Pakistan, once legislators are elected to national or provincial assemblies, the people cannot recall them before the end of their five-year terms. In the past, this has contributed to a sense of immunity on the part of members of the ruling party, and to a public perception of rampant corruption among leading politicians – in 1997, Pakistan received the second-worst score in the world on Transparency International&#x27;s Corruption Perceptions Index.

A few months later, the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, which subjected Members of Parliament to very strict party discipline by giving party leaders unlimited power to dismiss legislators who failed to vote as directed. This virtually eliminated any chance of a Prime Minister of being thrown out of office by a motion of no confidence. The amendments removed nearly all institutional checks and balances on the Prime Minister&#x27;s power, by effectively removing the legal remedies by which he could be dismissed.

Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s government became increasingly unpopular after the passage of these amendments, even though it was the election of his Pakistan Muslim League by a heavy majority that enabled him to alter the Constitution in the first place. A few months later, Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s partisan stormed the Supreme Court of Pakistan and forced the resignation of the Chief Justice. This strengthened the perception that the country was becoming a civilian dictatorship.

In 1999, the traitor Pervez Musharraf assumed power in a military-led bloodless coup. Among the reasons he gave for doing so were the destruction of institutional checks and balances, and the prevailing corruption in the political leadership. The coup was widely welcomed in Pakistan. Amongst the Opposition, ex-Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was one of the first leaders to congratulate General Pervez Musharraf for removing Nawaz Sharif. The Supreme Court later validated the removal on the grounds that the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments resulted in a situation for which there was no constitutional remedy.

In October 2002, elections were held in Pakistan. In December 2003, Parliament passed the Seventeenth Amendment, which partially restored the President&#x27;s reserve power to dissolve Parliament and thus remove the Prime Minister from office, but made it subject to Supreme Court approval.

<text>Stanley Bréhaut Egerton Ryerson (March 12, 1911 – 25 April 1998) was a Canadian historian, educator, political activist. His parents were Edward Stanley Ryerson and Tessie De Vigne, a well-off middle-class family in Toronto. Ryerson could trace his paternal lineage back to Egerton Ryerson, a leading Methodist in nineteenth century Toronto. His grandmother, Emily Eliza Beatty, was a sister-in-law to William McDougall, one of the Fathers of Confederation; and, on his mother&#x27;s side, he was related to Louis Antoine Bréhaut de l&#x27;Isle, French Commander at Trois-Rivières in 1638.

==Ideological origins==
To fully understand his commitment to communism one must look towards his period of study at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1931. While attending classes towards a &quot;Diplomes d&#x27;Etudes Superieures&quot; with a thesis on the writings of Sicilian peasant-realist novelist Giovanni Verga, Ryerson involved himself in communist activities. While travelling through Europe, he experienced the political turmoil within Spain and Italy during the early depression years, and while in Paris he took part in the funeral procession of the last survivor of the Paris Commune of 1871 a Z. Camelinat. On this day in 1932, while marching with 200,000 others to Père Lachaise Cemetery, Ryerson felt a fierce wave of connection with the French Left. His experiences in Europe affected his vision of the capitalist world and he would write:

&quot;the realization that the cultural values of art and literature were being turned by capitalism into what I can only describe as spiritual onanism and the discovery that communism, by solving the material problems of society, was the only path to a future creative renaissance, was the first impulse.&quot;

Europe was the scene of his birth as a communist; Canada was the scene of his growth into a renowned historian and communist intellectual.

==In the Communist Party==

The Communist Party of Canada, at least in the 1930s and 40s lacked a connection to the Canadian middle class as well as intellectuals; with his return to Canada, Ryerson would become a symbol of the party&#x27;s appeal to this segment of society. Ryerson &quot;was not the only &quot;traditional&quot; intellectual to join the CPC, but he was one of the first and undoubtedly was to become the most important.&quot; The Communist parties of Great Britain and the United States of America, as well as many other nations, could count numerous artists and intellectuals as members from the 1930s on; but in Canada, Ryerson was a lonely figure. His position within the CPC, including his rapid rise in the party hierarchy and his presence on the Central Committee (CC) until 1969, was assured by his unique position; a position that allowed him to play a role within the &quot;political history of Canadian Communism unlike that of his American and British counterparts.&quot; He was a middle class school boy from a privileged background in an overwhelmingly proletarian organisation, and as such his presence within the CPC did not always meet with approval. But, his education made him an asset for the party, one that would come in handy in the years to come.

==Marxist historian==
Ryerson&#x27;s major contribution was as a Marxist historian and it was here that Ryerson was to find his voice. The Canadian bourgeoisie&#x27;s dismissal of Communism generally states that it is an alien importation and as such has no basis within Canadian society. By stressing the progressive nature of the Canadian past, the CPC hoped to prove the validity of its existence within Canadian society. During this period, numerous articles and pamphlets were published by the CPC, but it was not until the 1937 publication of Stanley Ryerson&#x27;s &quot;1837: The Birth of Canadian Democracy&quot;, that the full Marxist analysis of the on the 1837 Rebellions would appear. &quot;1837&quot; should be viewed as a work of Marxist historiography written for a working-class audience and not for academia; since Ryerson wrote this book so it could be used as a weapon in the struggle of working people to build a qualitatively different and better world. Ryerson&#x27;s rationale for writing this book, as was the rationale for all his works, can be best summarised as an exploration of Canadian history with the hopes of educating the working-class, in a sense it was an exercise in the raising of class consciousness.

The choice of the title for this book is in itself an interesting by-product of the 1930s Popular Front activities of the CPC. Dedicated to the soldiers of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion fighting in the Spanish Civil War in defence of Republican Spain, this book was written in the hope of redefining the context of &quot;revolution&quot;. Ryerson referred to the cause of 1837 as the cause of &quot;democracy&quot;; his decision to place the word in the title of his book, was done with the hope of suggesting that this referred &quot;to both bourgeois liberalism that will supplant the remnants of feudal oligarchy and the ultimate vision of equality in the classless society brought about by the proletarian revolution.&quot; Doyle contended it was Ryerson&#x27;s aim to redefine &quot;democracy,&quot; and the way in which we refer to the events of 1837 and the idea of revolution in general.

==In leadership==
Following the outlawing of the CPC in 1940, General Secretary Tim Buck along with Sam Carr and Charles Sims fled Canada for the safety of New York where they would reside under the protection of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA). The leadership of the now underground party was placed in the hands of an Operations Centre, which was headed by Stewart Smith, Leslie Morris, and Stanley Ryerson. This new leadership decided upon a slogan for the CPC&#x27;s anti-war protests: &quot;Withdraw from the British Empire&quot;. Signalling a more radical approach to their anti-imperialist protests, the Operations Centre authorised Ryerson to write and publish two pamphlets in Quebec, &quot;French-Canada, A Nation in Bondage&quot; and &quot;French-Canada and the War&quot;. The pamphlets described French Canada as a subjugated people held in &quot;slavery&quot; by English Canada. This new approach to the issue of French Canada enabled Ryerson to develop close contacts among Canadian nationalists who opposed the war. With the German invasion of the Soviet Union in July, 1941 the CPC&#x27;s stance on the war changed quickly. Now that they supported the war, Tim Buck called Ryerson, Smith, and Morris before a CC meeting held on January 22 and 23, 1943. During this meeting, Buck assailed the position of Ryerson, which had become the position of the CPC during their anti-war period. According to Buck, &quot;English-Canada as a nation does not oppress French-Canada, nor impose inequality upon it. The national inequality from which the workers and farmers of Quebec suffer, is a heritage of the past.&quot;

==Attitude towards French Canada==
Later that year, the Communist Party, re-constituted as the Labor-Progressive Party, published Ryerson&#x27;s &quot;French Canada: A Study in Canadian Democracy&quot;. Within the pages of &quot;French Canada&quot;, Ryerson set out his vision of their vision for the future of Canada. He also emphasised the common aims of French and English Canadians in their anti-capitalist and anti-colonialist goals. Although researched and mostly written while Ryerson was occupied with the direction of the underground party, &quot;French Canada&quot; was a careful and provocative analysis of Quebec&#x27;s social and political history.

&quot;French Canada&quot; aimed at encouraging the development of a sense of national pride and unity among Canadians during the Second World War era. Ryerson put forth a socio-economic analysis of the Quebec and in turn educated most English-speaking Canadians about a region they knew very little about. As a sequel to &quot;1837&quot;, Ryerson&#x27;s &quot;French Canada&quot; revealed &quot;the militant spirit of democracy among French Canadians&quot; in the hopes of uniting &quot;them with their Anglophone compatriots.&quot; Ryerson did follow a certain &quot;great man&quot; approach to history when, in the early chapters, he emphasized the heroes &quot;who struggled for self-determination and/or Canadian unity&quot;; this approach was complemented by an emphasis on &quot;the Quebec masses and their rise out of feudal subjugation toward political power.&quot; Very much the Historical Materialist, Ryerson viewed the previous administrations of Quebec as working with representatives of English Canada and international capitalism to keep Quebec in economic subservience. Ryerson believed, &quot;The Toronto Tory and the Quebec corporatist meet on common ground: hostility to the democratic peoples&#x27; movement, [and] denial of our democratic heritage.&quot; Following on his contentions laid out in &quot;1837&quot;, Ryerson viewed the failure of English Canada to recognise their connection to French Canada and to fight hand in hand for the fullest democratic rights of the minority nation only served to deepen the power of reactionary influences and limit Canadian democracy and unity in general.

&quot;French Canada&quot; was a by-product of World War II and should be viewed as such. It was full of optimism about the prospects of an Allied victory in the war against international fascism and a transformed world capable of bringing about the complete elimination of the conditions that gave rise to fascism and to the prospect of war. Although this book is full of optimism about a possible future world, Ryerson did not envision a Communist future for Canada and instead placed the LPP as an important part of post-war Canada, but not a defining movement or a dominant party. Ryerson&#x27;s vision did not come to pass, but his analysis of the political perspicacity of working-class Quebec was groundbreaking as it came during a time when most writers tended to view &quot;Quebec as either a quaint or lamentable anachronism.&quot; &quot;French Canada&quot; gave its readers a remarkably modern and hopeful image of French-Canadian society.

==Intellectual evolution==
For Ryerson, an understanding of social relations was paramount if one was to garner an understanding of history; his encounter with Innis&#x27;s materialism led Ryerson to the charge that equated Marxism and economic determinism. He wrote &quot;Marxism holds that it is the people who make history-their labor and their struggles and their dreams; and that these are understandable and have meaning when seen in their real setting….&quot; He added, &quot;Labor, production, the real relationships of living society: this is the point of departure for historical materialism….Thought and feelings, ideas and passion and imagination have their being in a material world, are conditioned by it, work upon it.&quot; Ryerson&#x27;s approach to history is that of a man who sees the struggles and ideas of people as the driving force behind history. He did not believe they operate within a vacuum but within a given social system. Ryerson recognised the interplay of freedom and necessity within the development of history &quot;as it is in the best Marxist historical writing.&quot;

Following on the tradition of viewing his writings as a mode of class consciousness, &quot;The Founding of Canada&quot; was written very much as a popular Marxist introduction to Canadian History. This book offered very little new material and was instead more of a shifting in emphasis for Ryerson. This shift in emphasis stemmed primarily from Ryerson&#x27;s interest in prehistory and Soviet anthropology; this shift in emphasis is best illustrated by the six chapters on pre-European-contact Canada. This work was not a complete shift of emphasis; Ryerson still dealt with the issue of exploitation and freedom. He believed &quot;[t]he weight of &#x27;official&#x27; historiography has hitherto been heavily on the side of efforts to smother the facts of exploitation,&quot; and because of this &quot;[t]he idyllic patriarchal picture of these times that has become traditional, is a piece of flagrant deception.&quot;

&quot;Unequal Union&quot; has been seen as the more adventuresome of these two works. It focused on only 60 years, rather than the 300-year scope of &quot;The Founding of Canada&quot;, and it discussed more deeply the events after the War of 1812 leading up to the expansion of Canadian confederation in 1870. In this work, Ryerson turned to an analysis of land and land-holding, recognising the importance of land to the upper class during the colonial era. Gregory Kealey felt Ryerson overextended himself in his argument that the land-monopoly represented a &quot;sort of commercialised feudalism&quot; which &quot;loomed as the dominating problem before the Canadas.&quot; But Ryerson&#x27;s analysis of the 1837 Rebellions held true for Kealey, as he agrees with the classical Marxist formulation, that &quot;potential production forces were stifled by dominant property relations; and as long as the latter couldn&#x27;t be broken down progress remained illusory.&quot; Therefore, the rebellions of 1837 were an effort to break the &quot;rule of a landlord-merchant oligarchy,&quot; blocking the development of industrial capitalism.

==Analysis of nation and class==
Ryerson showed how the concepts of &quot;nation&quot; and &quot;class&quot;, as used by Marxist historians, can aide in an understanding of Canadian problems. He did not attempt to place Canadian history into a preconceived framework of ideas. Instead, he sought to bring the role of &#x27;class&#x27; and &#x27;nation&#x27;, and persons and personalities, into the forefront of discussion instead of allowing them &quot;to disappear behind a cloud of economic factors.&quot; For Ryerson, the complexities and contradictions of Canadian history can be best analysed through the lens of class conflict rather than idealistic theses of most bourgeois historians. Throughout these two volumes, Ryerson emphasised his critical view of colonialism and its effect on Canadian society. This two volume work, Ryerson explained modestly, was intended as &quot;a preliminary breaking of ground, suggesting a line of approach to a re-interpretation of this country&#x27;s history&quot;. These volumes are more scholarly in style and documentation, as they were &quot;addressed less to a working-class readership and more to academic historians and other well-informed readers.&quot;

The notion of &quot;Freedom&quot; has been of paramount concern for Ryerson, whether it is the freedom of French Canadians or the freedom of the working class in general, Ryerson has consistently built his arguments on the notion of freedom. In his philosophical work, &quot;The Open Society: Paradox and Challenge&quot;, published in 1965 outside of the CPC&#x27;s press, Ryerson discussed his vision of an open and free society. The crux of his argument is found in the issue of freedom; he saw the past as &quot;an evolution of people in society, marked by harsh conflict of contending classes and national forces, generating a progression toward greater freedom.&quot; The driving force behind all of society is the nature of class existence and each struggle the oppressed class wages brings it closer to &quot;freedom&quot;. According to Ryerson, and many other Marxist thinkers, the ability to breakthrough to a more open society will come about from the &quot;dispelling of the fog of false consciousness, [the] gaining for ourselves a true recognition of the real nature of the existing social structure.&quot;

==Academic career==
Ryerson paid a price for his commitment to the CPC and his analysis of Canadian history. Upon his return to Canada from his studies in Europe, he took up party work in August 1934 in Montreal where he taught French studies at Sir George Williams University. Ryerson had been working very closely with the CPC and in 1935 he was elected to the Central Committee (CC) and was elected provincial secretary in 1936. He held his position at the College for three years until his secret was discovered; all the while working and writing under the pseudonym of E. Roger to protect his job, his politics would lead to his eventual non-renewal in 1937. Ryerson&#x27;s next academic position would not come for 35 years, a year after he parted company with the CPC, he would accept a position in the History department at the Université du Québec à Montréal, and &quot;at age 58, he commenced the academic career he had sacrificed in the 1930s.&quot;

==Breaking with the Party==
His decision to leave the CPC in 1971 was primarily based upon his experiences within the Party from 1956 (the year of the Hungarian Revolution) up to, and after, the Soviet invasion of Prague in 1968. During his 35-year tenure in the CPC, Ryerson was routinely asked to augment his historical writings in order to meet the prevailing philosophy at the time. After the internal party crisis between 1956 and 1957, Ryerson was forced to write an article stating his previous books and articles had given &quot;a rather idealised treatment of the bourgeois democrats Lafontaine and Baldwin.&quot; Blaming this on &quot;liberalism,&quot; he essentially turned his back on his earlier beliefs concerning &quot;1837&quot; and sought to align himself with the new &quot;revisionist&quot; tendencies within the CPC that came about during the post-Stalin debate. Ryerson&#x27;s beliefs concerning Marxism-Leninism differed greatly from that of the CPC of the late 1950s and early 1960s. His vision was brought to the forefront when in his article &quot;In France: &quot;The Week of Marxist Thought&quot;,&quot; he agreed with the leader of the French Communist party who argued:

::that among the shoals to avoid, …, is the narrow, &#x27;cramped conception of Marxism-Leninism simply as a position to be defended, a fortress to be held, with every portcullis closed while one peers out over the battlements at all who are not &#x27;our people&#x27; wandering on the distant plain&#x27;

This sentiment did resonate with the leadership of General Secretary Leslie Morris, who viewed the sentiments of the &quot;Popular Front&quot; in a much more favourable light than would be seen under the leadership of William Kashtan; it was under the stifling leadership of Kashtan that Ryerson made his final break with the CPC.

==Views on Ryerson==
The general criticism of Ryerson is that his work continually failed to transcend the CPC&#x27;s ideological passivity when it came to their relationship with Moscow. Kealey sees these arguments as being based upon a belief that Ryerson&#x27;s understanding of Marxism was severely limited by the many &quot;Stalinist&quot; distortions people generally see in Soviet philosophy disseminated during Ryerson&#x27;s time in the CPC. It is true that party work affected his intellectual work; his choice of material was in many respects dictated by the political atmosphere of the day. But this does not mean he substituted party beliefs for his own in every respect. Ryerson was a dedicated Communist, who saw within the CPC the best vehicle for advancing the cause of Communism and the betterment of the working-class. His decision to follow the general line, and in some instances deny his true beliefs, is unfortunate but should not be viewed from outside of their historical realities. During the era of the &quot;Popular Front&quot;, Ryerson wrote in a manner befitting that era and during the time of the &quot;Democratic Front&quot; he stridently put forth arguments seeking the destruction of Fascism as it was, in his eyes, the best way forward for the working-class. The removal of Ryerson from his intellectual and historical &quot;context denies him recognition as the major pioneer of Marxist historical writing in Canada;&quot; and it also denies the very nature of Ryerson and his role in Canadian society.

As a Party intellectual, he was in the minority when compared to other communist parties in the world; but his dedication to a Marxist analysis of history and Canadian society was unsurpassed within the CPC. His early education was founded on the study of literature, but his time in Paris in the early 1930s would forever change his life and transform him into an &quot;Organic Intellectual&quot; of the working-class. His rationale for delving into historical and political writing can be found within the pages of &quot;Open Society&quot;. In reading &quot;1837&quot;, &quot;French Canada&quot;, &quot;The Founding of Canada&quot;, and &quot;Unequal Union&quot;, we, the reader, find Ryerson&#x27;s journey to &quot;dispel the fog of false consciousness&quot;. At the very heart of his writings, are the class struggle and the raising of class consciousness through the written word.

<text>The Julien Dubuque Bridge is a bridge over the Mississippi River that connects Dubuque, Iowa and East Dubuque, Illinois. The bridge is part of U.S. Route 20 (US 20). It is one of two automobile bridges over the Mississippi in the area (the Dubuque–Wisconsin Bridge north links Dubuque with Wisconsin), and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

== Description ==
The Julien Dubuque Bridge is a light grey color. The bridge spans and is 28 feet wide. The longest span is 845 feet.

==History==
For a number of years, people living in the area wanted a bridge to replace the old bridge, which was called either the &quot;High Bridge&quot; or the &quot;Wagon Bridge.&quot; However, economic conditions at the time made it difficult to get the financing together to build a new bridge.

During World War II, a new bridge became even more important as it would help facilitate military transportation. In 1942, the first parts of the bridge began construction. In 1943, the bridge was completed. It was painted gray to decrease visibility of the bridge for enemies.

Because the bridge was financed with bonds, it initially operated as a toll bridge. Money from the tolls was used to repay the debts. Large traffic paid the debts 11 years ahead of schedule and the bridge was toll free by 1954.

In the early 1990s, the bridge underwent an extensive renovation. The deck was replaced, and a new walkway was installed. Prior to this renovation, the bridge was dark green; however, it again was painted a light gray that is currently maintained.

Prior to the construction of the Dubuque-Wisconsin Bridge, the Julien Dubuque Bridge also carried US 61 and US 151. This resulted in both of these highways passing a short distance through Jo Daviess County, Illinois, between Dubuque and Wisconsin. Now both highways cross the Mississippi on the Dubuque–Wisconsin Bridge, which directly connects Wisconsin and Iowa, and neither US 61 nor US 151 passes through Illinois.

On June 9, 2008, the bridge was struck by a number of runaway barges shortly after 8 p.m. Fifteen barges—which were loaded with corn, soybeans, and iron ore—struck one of the pillars on the eastern side of the main channel. Unsure of whether the bridge was stable, authorities temporarily closed it until an inspection could be performed. Traffic was rerouted on to the Dubuque–Wisconsin Bridge a few miles to the north.

<doc id="641510" wikidata="Q5413558" url="?curid=641510" title="European ordering rules">
<text>The European ordering rules (EOR / EN 13710) define an ordering for strings written in languages that are written with the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic alphabets. The standard covers languages used by the European Union, the European Free Trade Association, and parts of the former Soviet Union. It is a tailoring of the &quot;Common Tailorable Template&quot; of ISO/IEC 14651. EOR can in turn be tailored for different (European) languages. But in inter-European contexts, EOR can be used without further tailoring.

==Method==

Just as for ISO/IEC 14651, upon which EOR is based, EOR has 4 levels of weights.

=== Level 1 ===
The first level sorts the letters. The following Latin letters are concerned by this level, in order:

:a b c d ð e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z þ

The Greek alphabet has the following order:

:α β γ δ ε ϝ ϛ ζ η θ ι κ λ μ ν ξ ο π ϟ ρ σ τ υ φ χ ψ ω ϡ

Cyrillic script has the following order:

:а б в г ґ д ђ ѓ е ё є ж з з́ ѕ и і ї й ј к л љ м н њ о п р с с́ т ћ ќ у ў ф х ц ч џ ш щ ъ ы ь ѣ э ю я

The order for the three alphabets is:
# Latin alphabet
# Greek alphabet
# Cyrillic alphabet

The Georgian and Armenian alphabets had not been included in ENV 13710:2000. However, they were covered in CR 14400:2001 &quot;European ordering rules – Ordering for Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Georgian and Armenian scripts&quot;. They have both been incorporated in and replaced by EN 13710:2011.

All scripts encoded in ISO/IEC 10646 (Unicode) are covered by ISO/IEC 14651 (and its datafile CTT) as well as Unicode collation algorithm (UCA and the associated DUCET), both of which are available at no charge.

=== Level 2 ===
The second level is where different additions, such as diacritics and variations, to the letters are ordered. Letters with diacritical marks (like , , , and ) are ordered as variants of the base letter. , , and are ordered as modifications of , , and respectively, similarly for similar cases.

Level 2 defines the following order of diacritics and other modifications:
# Acute accent (á)
# Grave accent (à)
# Breve (ă)
# Circumflex (â)
# Caron (š)
# Ring (å)
# Diaeresis (ä)
# Double acute accent (ő)
# Tilde (ã)
# Dot (ż)
# Cedilla (ç)
# Ogonek (ą)
# Macron (ā)
# With stroke through (ø)
# Modified letter(s) (æ)

=== Level 3 ===
The third level makes the distinction between Capital and small letters, as in &quot;Polish&quot; and &quot;polish&quot;.

=== Level 4 ===
The fourth level concerns punctuation and whitespace characters. This level makes the distinction between &quot;MacDonald&quot; and &quot;Mac Donald&quot;, &quot;its&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s&quot;.

=== Level 5 ===
An optional, and usually omitted, fifth level can distinguish typographical differences, including whether the text is &quot;italic&quot;, normal or bold.

<doc id="641512" wikidata="Q966020" url="?curid=641512" title="Earl of Dorset">
<text>Earl of Dorset is a title that has been created at least four times in the Peerage of England. Some of its holders have at various times also held the rank of marquess and, from 1720, duke.

A possible first creation is not well documented. About 1070 Osmund, or Osmer, is said to have been created earl of Dorset, but the authority is a very late one and Osmund described himself simply as bishop. William de Mohun appears as earl of Dorset or Somerset, these two shires being in early times united under a single sheriff.

It was later created in 1411 for Thomas Beaufort, who was later created Duke of Exeter. The peerages became extinct on his death. It was next created in 1441 for Edmund Beaufort who was later created first Marquess of Dorset (1442) and then Duke of Somerset (1446). These titles were forfeited by the second duke in 1464.

The last creation was in 1604 for Thomas Sackville, 1st Baron Buckhurst. In 1720 the seventh earl was created Duke of Dorset in the Peerage of Great Britain. On the death of the fifth duke in 1843 the peerages became extinct.

<text>The Unicode collation algorithm (UCA) is an algorithm defined in Unicode Technical Report #10, which is a customizable method to produce binary keys from strings representing text in any writing system and language that can be represented with Unicode. These keys can then be efficiently compared byte by byte in order to collate or sort them according to the rules of the language, with options for ignoring case, accents, etc.

Unicode Technical Report #10 also specifies the &quot;Default Unicode Collation Element Table&quot; (DUCET). This data file specifies a default collation ordering. The DUCET is customizable for different languages, and some such customizations can be found in the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR).

An open source implementation of UCA is included with the International Components for Unicode, ICU. ICU supports tailoring, and the collation tailorings from CLDR are included in ICU.

<doc id="641540" wikidata="Q1093795" url="?curid=641540" title="Austin Rover Group">
<text>The Austin Rover Group (abbreviated ARG) was a British motor manufacturer. It was created in 1982 as the mass-market car manufacturing subsidiary of British Leyland (BL). Previously, this entity had been known as BL Cars Ltd (formerly Leyland Cars) which encompassed the &quot;Austin-Morris&quot; and &quot;Jaguar-Rover-Triumph&quot; divisions of British Leyland. After a major restructuring of BL&#x27;s car manufacturing operations, Jaguar regained its independence (leading to its eventual de-merger in 1984) whilst the Triumph and Morris marques were retired. The new, leaner car business was rechristened as the Austin Rover Group and focused primarily on the Austin and Rover marques. The Morris and Triumph marques continued briefly within ARG until 1984 when both were dropped.

In 1989, two years after the Austin brand was also discontinued, ARG assumed the name of its parent company &quot;Rover Group plc&quot;, from which point the two entities were generally considered one and the same, although they continued to be legally separate – &quot;Rover Group plc&quot; was a holding company owning Land Rover following the divestment of Unipart and Leyland Trucks, whilst &quot;Rover Group Limited&quot; was the mass market car manufacturing business.

==History==

Following the financial collapse of the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC) in 1975 and the stark Ryder Report on the ailing firm, the resulting government bail-out and nationalisation saw the company being renamed British Leyland (BL). The car manufacturing subsidiary of BL became &quot;Leyland Cars&quot;, and later &quot;BL Cars Ltd&quot;, and it was this entity which ultimately became Austin Rover. The Leyland name had become tainted by the industrial unrest and poor quality cars of the 1970s, and the creation of the Austin Rover brand was intended to present a new public face of the company, although at corporate level it was still known as &quot;BL plc&quot;.

However, the huge industrial relations problems, ineffectual management and product duplication that had plagued the company up to the nationalisation continued throughout the late 1970s. The problems centered on Longbridge union leader and shop steward Derek Robinson (nicknamed &quot;Red Robbo&quot; by the British press). Robinson had assumed a greater level of control over BL than any of its senior managers, and his network of union leaders in the various BL plants had the power to end production if he had instructed them to do so.

The incumbent government of the time ran out of patience with Robinson, and appointed South African-born corporate troubleshooter Sir Michael Edwardes to turn BL around. His first task was to curb the large amount of power that the trade unions had over the company. After discovering Robinson&#x27;s links with various communist groups, the company amassed sufficient evidence claiming that his actions were intended to deliberately damage both BL itself and the UK economy. As a result of this, he was dismissed in 1979. Secondly, Edwardes began a ruthless programme of factory closures and sell-offs. The biggest casualties of this were the MG assembly plant in Abingdon, and the Triumph plants in Speke (Liverpool) and Canley (Coventry). BL pulled out of entire markets – for example the large Leyland tractors range was sold-off wholesale to Marshall, and Jaguar was privatised in 1984. Many of BL&#x27;s non-core subsidiaries (such as refrigerator company Prestcold and industrial engine manufacturer Coventry Climax) were also culled during Edwardes&#x27; tenure.

Thirdly, he entered into a collaborative agreement with Honda, the first product of this alliance being the Triumph Acclaim, which paved the way for the joint development of a range of cars which spearheaded the company&#x27;s revival in the 1980s and 1990s. Lastly, the number of BL dealerships in the UK was trimmed down drastically.

The new, slimmer British Leyland was organised into a series of groups. Austin Rover handled the mass production of cars, with the smallest and cheapest models being sold under the Austin brand, while the more upmarket models carried a Rover badge. High performance version of the Austin hatchbacks and saloons made use of a revived MG badge. Light commercial vehicle production (4x4s and vans) was managed by the Land Rover Group, whilst full-size commercial vehicles were built by Leyland Trucks and Leyland Bus. The luxury manufacturer Jaguar was demerged from BL in 1984 and privatized, later taken over by Ford in 1989, and was ultimately reunited with former BL stablemate Land Rover in 2000 to form what is now Jaguar Land Rover.

Sales of Austin Rover products were reasonably strong, though not quite as high as the sales achieved by some of the earlier British Leyland products – the Maestro and Montego for instance did not sell as well as their predecessors, the Austin Allegro and Morris Marina, despite being fundamentally superior vehicles for their time. The Austin/MG Metro was regularly among the top five selling cars in Britain throughout the 1980s, and for two years in the early part of the decade it was the best selling supermini in Britain. The Metro, which was launched in 1980, gave the firm a much-needed competitor in modern supermini market and filled a gap in the range vacated by a scaling down of Mini and Austin Allegro production. At its peak in 1983, the Metro was Britain&#x27;s third best selling car with more than 130,000 sales.

The Austin Maestro, launched in March 1983, was initially very popular, but sales dipped towards the end of the decade and in 1989 it was the 19th best selling new car in the UK with less than 40,000 sales, having peaked in 1984 at more than 80,000 sales as Britain&#x27;s sixth best selling car. This was less of a problem thanks to the follow-up of the Triumph Acclaim with the first generation Rover 200 of 1984 – the second product of the Honda alliance and one of the few strong-selling small family saloons of its era. So in effect, Austin Rover was selling around 100,000 cars of this size every year in Britain during the mid to late 1980s, regaining its share of the sector after the scaling-down of Austin Allegro production from 1980. The similarly sized Austin Maxi had already been discontinued in 1981 to allow the Triumph Acclaim to take over its production lines.

The Austin Montego went on sale in April 1984 and sold well, being Britain&#x27;s seventh best selling car in 1985 and 1986, though it was unable to match the sales success of the sector&#x27;s established favourites – the Ford Sierra and Vauxhall Cavalier. The car had been in the pipeline since the late 1970s when the company&#x27;s main competitors in this sector were the Morris Marina and Princess, but the Montego actually replaced the Morris Ital and Austin Ambassador which were the respective facelifted versions of those two cars.

Austin Rover&#x27;s executive car, the Rover 800, was launched in July 1986 as the third product of its venture with Honda, sharing its development with the Honda Legend. This car also sold well, being a popular competitor for the likes of the Ford Granada and Vauxhall Carlton. It was also sold in America under the Sterling brand, but this project was quickly shelved due to unacceptable product quality issues that led to low sales.

Austin Rover&#x27;s decision not to replace sports cars like the MG MGB and Triumph TR7 was justified by the fact that sports cars were no longer popular in the early 1980s, and many other manufacturers had also stopped – or were about to stop – production of sports coupes and roadsters. Buyers were instead being guided to &quot;hot hatchbacks&quot;, following a trend set by the Volkswagen Golf GTI since 1976. By 1985, Austin Rover had launched a line-up of performance variants of its Metro and Maestro hatchbacks and the Montego saloon. These cars were badged as MG models and proved popular, especially in the form of the MG Metro. MG models accounted for approximately 10% of Metro, Maestro and Montego production between 1982 and 1991. The Rover Group continued production of the MG Metro until 1990 when it was replaced by the Rover Metro GTi. MG Maestro and Montego production continued at Cowley until 1991, when these models were discontinued to make way for the GTi variants of the Rover 200 and 400. However, the last Maestro and Montego models survived in production until December 1994, just before the 200 and 400 ranges – which had been expected to replace them – were themselves replaced.

===Consolidation and renaming===

In 1986, Austin Rover&#x27;s parent company, BL plc, was renamed &quot;Rover Group&quot;, and the truck and bus businesses were subsequently demerged and sold off to DAF and Volvo, respectively. The spare parts and logistics arm Unipart was also spun out in 1987. After an abortive attempt in 1988 to divest Land Rover to General Motors, the entire Rover Group was sold off by the British government in 1988 to British Aerospace. The car making subsidiary Austin Rover Group Ltd was renamed &quot;Rover Group Ltd&quot;, which saw the effective disappearance of the Austin Rover name and brand, even though the Austin badging had been removed from the Mini, Metro, Maestro and Montego models after 1987. By 1991, all Austin Rover dealer signage had been changed to the new claret and beige &quot;Rover&quot; branding, and use of the old blue and green &quot;chevron&quot; logo had ceased, although it made sporadic appearances on the cars themselves (see below).

The combine now known as Rover Group remained in BAe ownership until January 1994, when it was sold to BMW. It remained in BMW ownership for six years before being sold to the &quot;Phoenix Consortium&quot; in May 2000, incorporating the MG and Rover marques and becoming MG Rover, which lasted five years before going bankrupt. The ownership of the Mini brand, however, remained in BMW ownership, as did ownership of the Cowley factory, which began production of an all-new Mini in the summer of 2001. Land Rover, meanwhile was sold to Ford, who had already purchased Jaguar in 1989.

MG production was revived in 2007 by new owner Nanjing Automobile, while the rights to use the Rover marque were purchased by Ford in 2006, only to be transferred to ownership of Indian carmaker Tata in 2008, as Tata also took over Land Rover and Jaguar to form Jaguar Land Rover. The Rover marque has yet to be revived more than a decade after its demise that was brought about by the collapse of MG Rover.

==Branding and logo==

In 1968 British Leyland had created &quot;Austin Morris Ltd&quot; as an operating company that managed all the previous operations of the British Motor Corporation which it had absorbed, but it was not until 1978 that Austin-Morris was given a formal corporate identity (distinct from the Jaguar Rover Triumph (JRT) arm of the company) with the blue and green &quot;chevron&quot; logo (officially known as the &quot;wing&quot;), which began appearing on Austin and Morris-badged BL cars in that year – the Princess 2 and the van/pick-up versions of the Morris Marina were the first vehicles to wear the logo. However, this separate branding strategy was later abandoned and by 1983 the chevron would be later expanded to represent virtually all of BL&#x27;s marques and business activities in the public domain, eventually supplanting BL&#x27;s own roundel logo (affectionately known as the &quot;flying plughole&quot; or &quot;the plughole of despair&quot;) and would ultimately become the logo of the entire Austin Rover Group.

The ARG chevron officially remained in use until 1988, when ARG&#x27;s rename and reprivatisation into the Rover Group saw it gradually disappear. The Austin name was retired after 1987, however the logo still appeared on the badging of the former Austin models, and the VIN plates of the cars still read &quot;Austin Rover Group Ltd&quot;, since this was still the manufacturer&#x27;s official name until 1989. For that model year the chevron logo was finally dropped in favour of a black silhouetted version of the Rover &quot;longship&quot; badge upon which the model name (Metro, Maestro, Montego) was applied, although with the exception of the reengineered R6 Metro of 1990, the Rover name was never officially used for these models.

One interesting anomaly from the ARG era is that the chevron logo was stamped into thousands of BL/Rover Group vehicle components, many of which survived on Rover and Land Rover models into the 21st century; indeed there are still some components – most notably on the Land Rover Defender until it finished production in 2016 – which still bear both it and some still even bear the older BL roundel logo.

A number of new models were in development at the time that Austin Rover Group ceased to exist – including the second generation Rover 200 Series, launched in October 1989 and the new Metro which was launched in May 1990.

<text>Cunnamulla () is a town and a locality in the Shire of Paroo, Queensland, Australia. It is south of Charleville, and approximately west of the state capital, Brisbane. In the 2021 census, the locality of Cunnamulla had a population of 1,233 people.

==Geography==
Cunnamulla lies on the Warrego River in South West Queensland within the Murray–Darling drainage basin. It flows from the north (Coongoola) through the town, which is in the centre of the locality, and exits to the south (Tuen).

The Mitchell Highway passes through the locality from north (Coongoola) to south (Tuen), while the Balonne Highway enters the location from the east (Linden). The two highways intersect in the town, which is located in the centre of the locality. The Bulloo Developmental Road starts in Cunnamulla and exits the locality to the west (Eulo).

Cunnamulla is the administrative centre for the Paroo Shire, which also includes the townships of Wyandra, Yowah and Eulo, and covers an area of .

Major industries of the area are cattle, sheep and goat farming, along with tourism and opal mining.

==History==
Gunya (also known as Kunya, Kunja, Kurnja) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Gunya people. The Gunya language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Paroo Shire Council, taking in Cunnamulla and extending north towards Augathella, east towards Bollon and west towards Thargomindah.

The original Indigenous inhabitants of the area were the Kunja. The first European explorer to arrive was Edmund Kennedy, whose expedition passed through the region in 1847. Kennedy&#x27;s group noted fields of native grasses that appeared to be being cultivated like a wheat crop, but they only had limited interaction with the people who resided there.

Pastoralists arrived to take land from 1861 when squatter Alexander Keith Collins led an exploratory group through the region that had several skirmishes with the local Aboriginal people. Collins was later investigated for kidnapping two Aboriginal boys. By 1863, all of the land along the southern Warrego River had been acquired by pastoralists.

The town name of Cunnamulla is derived from the &quot;Cunnamullah&quot; cattle station established by Samuel Smith in 1863, which in turn is the Aboriginal name of a deep waterhole in the Warrego River.

A settlement arose here because there was a reliable waterhole where two major stock routes intersected. The town itself came into being in the late 19th century as a coach stop for Cobb and Co coaches. A town survey was conducted in 1868, the same year a courthouse was built. Cunnamulla Post Office opened on 1 March 1868.

Cunnamulla Provisional School opened on 9 July 1877, becoming Cunnamulla State School in 1885.

From 1885 when the railway was constructed to Bourke in New South Wales, farmers at Cunnamulla and other parts of south-western Queensland began to send their wool to markets via Bourke rather than to Charleville, then the terminus of the Western railway line in Queensland, as the New South Wales government offered more competitive rail freight rates than the Queensland Government. Queensland Railway Commissioner James Thallon responded by negotiating with the Carrier&#x27;s Union which carried goods to the Charleville railhead to make the cost of transporting the goods via Charleville more attractive. However, strikes by the carriers in support of the 1891 Australian shearers&#x27; strike meant that goods continued to be travel via New South Wales, further encouraged by new lower freight rates in New South Wales announced in June 1893. The Queensland Government responded the following month by introducing the Railway Border Tax Act which taxed wool and sheepskins crossing the border into New South Wales to make it too expensive to freight the wool via New South Wales. However, this could only be a temporary measure as the anticipated Federation of Australia would likely include free trade between the states of Australia removing the ability to tax goods at the border crossing. Therefore, on 3 December 1895, the Queensland Parliament approved the construction of the extension of the Western railway line from Charleville to Cunnamulla.

During the construction of the railway line, there was a dispute over the location of the railway station at Cunnamulla. The original proposal was for the station to be to the north of the town to be above the flood level rather than within the town centre as was usual practice. However, the railway chief engineer Henry Charles Stanley visited Cunnamulla and decided it would be better to place the station in the centre of the town as it would be more convenient and better positioned for crossing the Warrego River when the railway line was further extended. However, the disadvantage of the town centre site was that it would encroach on the town&#x27;s cricket ground. The townsfolk were divided on the issue and many sent petitions to the government to demand one location or the other. The Queensland Parliament eventually decided to proceed with the original location north of the town. The railway line to Cunnamulla was opened on 10 October 1898. However, the hotel on the corner of John and Louise Streets in the centre of the town had already been named the Railway Hotel in anticipation of a town-centre station and retained that name until the 1970s, when it was renamed Trappers Inn.

Sacred Heart Catholic Church was opened officially opened on 23 May 1894 by Thomas Byrnes and dedicated by Father Corrigon, the parish priest. The building was and capable of seating about 250 people with 30 people in the organ loft. It was high, the tallest building in Cunnamulla. It was made from locally-grown cypress with finer-quality Warwick pine used for the floor and ceiling. It was the first church in Cunnamulla. The 1894 church building was demolished in 1971 to be replaced by the current church building which opened in 1972.

The foundation stone for an Anglican church was laid in January 1896 by Christopher Francis, the police magistrate. The church was opened on Saturday 20 June 1896 by Bishop Jack Stretch. The bishop was injured on his way to Cunnamulla, as he shot at a turkey from his buggy, frightening the horses, resulting in a crash with a tree stump, but was still able to perform the ceremony.

The Bush Brotherhood of St Paul has provided pastoral care to Cunnamulla since 1905.

The Sacred Heart Primary School was opened in 1915 by the Sisters of Mercy.

In 1970, Queen Elizabeth II, the Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Anne toured Australia including Queensland. The Queensland tour began on Sunday 12 April when the royal yacht &quot;HMY Britannia&quot; entered Moreton Bay at Caloundra, sailing into Newstead Wharf. Princess Anne accepted an invitation to spend three days on a working sheep station in south-west Queensland. She flew to Cunnamulla on 14 April, travelling by road to ‘Talbarea Station’ unaccompanied. Princess Anne arrived in Cunnamulla in a government jet a little ahead of schedule. She travelled around the district in a maroon Rolls-Royce which was unloaded from the back of a Royal Australian Air Force transport aircraft. Princess Anne was given a demonstration of sheep shearing and wool classing on the working property and was accompanied on a horse ride during her stay.

In 1999, the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Policy and Development reported that Cunnamulla&#x27;s indigenous community suffered from a high level of domestic violence stemming from an over reliance by the police and the courts on punishment and detention to deal with Indigenous offenders.

The Cunnamulla library underwent a major refurbishment in 2013.

<text>St. Luke&#x27;s United Methodist Church, also known as St. Luke&#x27;s Methodist and as St. Luke&#x27;s United Methodist, is a historic Richardsonian Romanesque-style church located at 1199 Main Street in Dubuque, Iowa. It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, and as a contributing property in the Upper Main Street Historic District in 2005. It is part of the Iowa Conference of the United Methodist Church.

The church has more Tiffany windows than any other church in the state.

According to its NRHP nomination, the building is significant for its history in religion in Dubuque, for its Richardsonian Romanesque (unique in Dubuque), and for its Tiffany glass.

==History==

The church can trace its origins back to the founding of the city of Dubuque. Barton Randle, preached the first sermon on Iowa soil on November 6, 1833. First services were held in 1833 in a multipurpose log cabin building in what is now Washington Square. Subsequent buildings were built in 1834 (also in what is now Washington Square), 1839 (across the street), 1853 (on Main Street between 11th and 12th Streets), and the current building at the corner of 12th and Main Streets.

The present church was built in 1896, and the congregation began worshiping in the building in 1897. The church is noted for their collection of over 100 Tiffany Stained glass windows. It has been called &quot;one of the five finest Religious Tiffany collections in the world.&quot; The Angel in the window of the Angel among the Lilies is rumored to bear the likeness of the young deceased daughter of the people who had sponsored that particular window. Since 1990, the church has made an effort to restore and preserve these windows.
The pipe organ in the church is also of historic interest. When the Farand and Votey organ was purchased, two train cars were required to bring the parts to Dubuque. Because the train could not get across the river, barges than were used to float the parts over so that they could be installed in the church. The organ has about 1,000 pipes. At the time of installation, it was one of the largest organs in the area, however over the years it has been eclipsed by others. The pipe organ contains 36 ranks or pipes, about 2,200 total and was restored in 1992 by the Fowler Organ Company, Lansing, Michigan.

<doc id="641554" wikidata="Q5040189" url="?curid=641554" title="Carl Furillo">
<text>Carl Anthony Furillo (March 8, 1922 – January 21, 1989), nicknamed &quot;the Reading Rifle&quot; and &quot;Skoonj&quot;, was an American baseball player who played in Major League Baseball (MLB), spending his entire career with the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers, primarily as a right fielder.

A member of seven National League (NL) champion teams between and , Furillo batted over .300 five times, winning the batting title, with a .344 average—then the highest by a right-handed hitting Dodger since 1900. Noted for his strong and accurate throwing arm, he recorded ten or more assists in nine consecutive seasons, leading the league twice, and retired with the fifth-most games in right field (1,408) in NL history.

==Early years==
Furillo was born in Stony Creek Mills, Pennsylvania. He was born from Italian immigrants from Campania. His father was from the province of Caserta and his mother was from the province of Benevento.

He was affectionately called &quot;Skoonj&quot;, a nickname derived from the Italian word &quot;scungilli&quot; (&quot;snail&quot;), which was his favorite dish.

Furillo dropped out of school in the eighth grade and began working in various jobs, including apple-picking and work in a woolen mill. He continued to play baseball in his spare time. After the death of his mother, when he was eighteen, he decided to pursue baseball professionally.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues and military service===
In 1940, Furillo signed with the Reading Chicks of the Interstate League, earning one of his nicknames with his powerful arm: &quot;the Reading Rifle&quot;; the Dodgers were sufficiently impressed by his ability that they purchased the entire minor league franchise to acquire him. Following the 1941 season with the Reading Brooks (renamed after being acquired by the Dodgers), he was assigned to the Montreal Royals of the International League where he batted .281 in 129 games.

Furillo&#x27;s career was interrupted by the Second World War. In 1942, he enlisted in the United States Army and served for three years. He served in combat in the Pacific Theater, receiving three battle stars and the Purple Heart for being wounded in action.

===Major leagues===
Upon returning from the army, Furillo reported to the Dodgers camp in Sanford, Florida for &quot;advanced training&quot; which had been designed for returning servicemen. He made the major leagues in . The following season, he batted .295 for the NL pennant winners, finishing the year ninth in the league with 88 runs batted in.

Furillo was one of the key members on the Dodgers&#x27; champions, hitting .322 (4th in the NL) with 18 home runs, and placing among the league&#x27;s top ten players in RBI (106), slugging average (.506), hits (177), runs (95), triples (10) and total bases (278); he finished sixth in the voting for the MVP Award. In 1950 he batted .305 (7th in the league) with 18 home runs, 106 RBI, and a career-high 99 runs. He achieved a personal best with 197 hits, finishing third in the NL for the second year in a row, for the 1951 team which lost a legendary pennant playoff to the New York Giants; he also batted .295 (9th in the NL) with 91 RBI and 93 runs.

He became skilled at negotiating balls hit off the high right-field wall at Ebbets Field, and after he led the NL in assists in both 1950 (18) and 1951 (24), opposing runners were increasingly reluctant to challenge his arm. On August 27, 1951, he threw out Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Mel Queen by two feet at first base after Queen had apparently singled into right field. During spring training of 1952, the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; called Furillo &quot;one of the best players in the game,&quot; calling his style one of &quot;close mechanical perfection.&quot;

Furillo batted only .247 for the pennant winners, though he was selected to his first All-Star team. Diagnosed with cataracts, he had surgery in the offseason and returned with perhaps his best season, winning the batting title and collecting 21 home runs and 92 RBI with a career-best 38 doubles (3rd in the NL). His .344 average was the highest by a right-handed Dodgers hitter since Oyster Burns hit .354 in 1894; Tommy Davis bettered him with a .346 mark in 1962. He was again named an All-Star, ending the year fifth in the league in slugging (.580), and finished ninth in the MVP balloting.

Furillo&#x27;s season ended on September 6 against the Giants – he was batting against Rubén Gómez in the second inning, and opposing manager Leo Durocher was yelling for Gomez to &quot;stick it in his ear&quot;; Furillo was hit on the wrist by a pitch, and proceeded to first base, but with a 3–2 count on the next batter, Durocher and Furillo charged towards each other. Furillo got Durocher in a headlock, and in the ensuing brawl, Monte Irvin of the Giants stepped on Furillo&#x27;s hand, fracturing a knuckle on his little finger.

For the champions he was seventh in the league with a .314 average, along with 95 RBI and a career high of 26 homers. With the team which repeated as NL champions, earning the team&#x27;s seventh pennant in ten years, he slipped to a .289 average but maintained solid power totals with 21 homers, 83 RBI and 30 doubles. He hit .306 in the Dodgers&#x27; last season in Brooklyn in 1957, and batted .290 in their first year in Los Angeles, finishing eighth in the league with 83 RBI. With the pennant team, his playing time was reduced to only 50 games, with just 25 of them in the outfield. But he had one last highlight in the playoff series against the Milwaukee Braves when he beat out a ground ball in the 12th inning of the second and final game, with Gil Hodges scoring from second base to win the NL pennant.

The Dodgers released Furillo in May while he was injured with a torn calf muscle; he sued the team, claiming they released him to avoid both the higher pension due a 15-year player and medical expenses, eventually collecting $21,000. He later maintained he was blackballed as a result and was unable to find a job within the sport – a charge denied by Commissioner Ford Frick.

===World Series exploits===
Furillo had an excellent 1947 World Series, batting .353 in a seven-game loss; he had two RBI and scored a run in a 9–8 Game 3 victory, and scored the run which gave Brooklyn the lead for good in an 8–6 win in Game 6. He preserved a 6–5 victory in Game 5 of the 1952 World Series when he made a spectacular catch over the fence of an apparent home run by Johnny Mize – who had already homered three times in the Series – with one out in the eleventh inning.

In the 1953 World Series he hit .333, and drove in the tying run in the seventh inning of Game 1, though Brooklyn went on to lose; in the final Game 6, his 2-run homer with one out in the ninth tied the game 3–3, but New York scored in the bottom of the inning to win the game and the Series.

In the victorious 1955 Series he started the scoring with a solo home run in his first at bat of Game 1, which New York won 6–5. In Game 7, he advanced Roy Campanella to third base on a groundout in the fourth inning, with Campanella later scoring, and was walked intentionally with one out and runners on second and third in the sixth, with another run following on a sacrifice fly by Hodges. The two runs held up for a 2–0 victory, and Brooklyn earned the only World Series title in franchise history.

== Statistical summary ==
In his 15-year career, Furillo batted .299 with 192 home runs, 1,910 hits, 1,058 RBI, 895 runs, 324 doubles, 56 triples, 48 stolen bases, a .458 slugging average and 514 walks for a .355 on-base percentage. As an outfielder, he had 3,322 putouts, 151 assists, 34 double plays and 74 errors for 3,547 total chances and a .979 fielding percentage. If he had one more hit in his career, he would have statistically had a .300 batting average.

Furillo played in seven World Series with the Dodgers, six of them against the New York Yankees, winning in 1955 and in 1959 against the Chicago White Sox. In 40 World Series games, he batted .266 (34-for-128) with 13 runs, 9 doubles, 2 home runs, 13 RBI and 13 walks.

==After baseball==
After retiring as a player, Furillo left the sport for good. While writing his 1972 book &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; about the 1952 and 1953 pennant-winning teams, author Roger Kahn located Furillo installing elevators at the World Trade Center. During the mid-1960s, he owned and operated a deli in Flushing, Queens. Furillo later worked as a night watchman.

It was later reported by former teammates that Furillo overcame his bitterness towards baseball and became a regular attender of fantasy baseball camps at Dodgertown in Vero Beach, Florida towards the end of his life.

Furillo developed leukemia, and died in Stony Creek Mills, Pennsylvania at 66 years of age of an apparent heart attack. He was survived by his wife Fern ( Reichart), his two sisters, his sons, and five grandchildren. He is interred at Forest Hills Memorial Park in Reiffton, Pennsylvania. Although Furillo felt that baseball completely forgot about him and his accomplishments, his funeral was attended by a number of his former Dodger teammates, including Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax who was once Furillo&#x27;s roommate as a young pitcher.

<doc id="641555" wikidata="Q7457649" url="?curid=641555" title="Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan">
<text>The Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan (Urdu: آئین پاکستان میں سترہویں ترمیم) was an amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan passed in December 2003, after over a year of political wrangling between supporters and opponents of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, who in 2024 was declared a traitor by the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

This amendment made many changes to Pakistan&#x27;s constitution. Many of these changes dealt with the office of the president and the reversal of the effects of the Thirteenth Amendment. Summarized here are brief descriptions of the major points.

*President Musharraf&#x27;s Legal Framework Order (LFO) was largely incorporated into the constitution, with a few changes. 
*Article 63(1)(d) of the Constitution to become operative after December 31, 2004. The intent of this was to prohibit a person from holding both a political office (such as that of the president) and an &quot;office of profit&quot; - an office that is typically held by a career government servant, civil or military - such as the office of the Chief of Army Staff. Although this was supposed to separate the two types of office, a loophole - &quot;.. other than an office declared by law ..&quot; - allowed Parliament to pass an ordinary law later in 2004 - permitting the President to hold on to the office of Chief of Army Staff, an option that President Musharraf then exercised.
*Should the President win a majority in a vote of confidence in the electoral college within 30 days of the passage of this amendment, he shall be deemed to be elected to the office of President. (On January 1, 2004, Musharraf won 658 out of 1,170 electoral-college votes - a 56% majority - and was thereby deemed to be elected president.)
*The President regains the authority to dissolve the National Assembly - and thus effectively to dismiss the Pakistani Prime Minister - but the power to do so is made subject to an approval or veto by the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
*A Governor&#x27;s power to dissolve a Provincial Assembly is similarly subject to Supreme Court approval or veto.
*Article 152A, which dealt with the National Security Council, was annulled. (The legal basis for the NSC is now an ordinary law, the National Security Council Act of 2004.)
*Ten laws had been added by the LFO to the Sixth Schedule, which is a list of &quot;laws that are not to be altered, repealed or amended without the previous sanction of the President.&quot; After this amendment, five of those laws will lose their Sixth Schedule protection after six years. Laws to be unprotected include the four laws that established the system of democratic local governments. (Those in favor of this change have argued that it would enable each province to evolve its own systems. Opponents fear that authoritarian provincial governments could disempower or even dismantle the system of local democracies.)

<text>Reynolds 531 (pronounced &#x27;five-three-one&#x27;) is a brand name, registered to Reynolds Technology of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, for a manganese–molybdenum, medium-carbon steel tubing that was used in many quality applications, including race car chassis, aircraft components and, most famously, bicycle frame tubing. It is one of a number of tubing types developed by Reynolds.

Reynolds 531 &quot;was the standard of excellence for many decades&quot; among bicycle frame-building materials. And because of the availability of a wide range of butting, diameters and thicknesses of tubes, along with different stays and fork blades, it became the tubing of choice for most frame builders.

==Details==

Introduced in 1935 and for many years at the forefront of alloy steel tubing technology, 531 cycle tubing has been superseded by more complex alloys and heat-treatment/cold-forming cycles as Reynolds continues to compete with other manufacturers of steel for the bicycle industry.

531 tubing became the tubing-of-choice for most framebuilders at least partly because of the huge range of butting, diameters and thicknesses of tubes along with different stays and fork blades available – helped by the willingness of Reynolds to make special tubes for certain manufacturers. Reynolds also made up complete &#x27;sets&#x27; of tubing for different cycling applications – for example 531c (Competition), 531st (Super Tourist), 531ATB (All Terrain Bike) and so-on. This flexibility made 531 still competitive even after the introduction of more advanced alloys. The widespread use of TIG and MIG welding in cycle manufacture became a problem as 531 reacted poorly to the higher temperatures produced and 531 has been gradually phased out as a result.

The most common like-for-like replacements for 531 are Reynolds 520 and 525 – a chrome-molybdenum tubing with very similar characteristics, but in addition to brazing, can also be welded. The 520 and 525 tubing are essentially the same thing. The difference being that 525 is made at Reynolds headquarters in Birmingham, England while 520 is made to the same specifications in Taiwan, saving transportation costs when supplying Taiwanese frame builders.

The approximate alloying composition of 531 tubing is 1.5% Mn, 0.25% Mo, 0.35% C, and is similar to the old British BS970 En 16/18 steel (EN 16 is similar to grade BS970 605M36). Its mechanical properties and response to heat treatment are broadly similar to the AISI 4130 standard alloy steel, also used for bicycle frames, motorcycles, as well as aviation and motor-sport. This material was used to form the front subframes on the Jaguar E-Type of the 1960s.

Reynolds 531 is now only available by special order. The nearest available stock material is BS4t45 to Bs5T100 in accordance with BS6S100 conditions. (T45) Reynolds has superseded this tube set with a number of innovations such as Reynolds 753 and the more current 853. Reynolds also produces stainless steel tube sets for bicycle frame building – these are 925 and 953.

<text>A Caesar is a cocktail created and consumed primarily in Canada. It typically contains vodka, Clamato, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce, and is served with ice in a large, celery salt-rimmed glass, typically garnished with a stalk of celery and wedge of lime. What distinguishes it from a Bloody Mary is the inclusion of clam broth. The cocktail may also be contrasted with the Michelada, which has similar flavouring ingredients but uses beer instead of vodka.

==Origin==

&#x27;Bloody Mary a La Milo&#x27; in the 1951 Ted Saucier cocktail book titled &#x27;Bottoms Up&#x27; (page 45), appears to be the first published cocktail recipe that includes vodka, tomato juice, clam juice, and Worcestershire sauce. Ted Saucier credits the recipe to Milo J. Sutliff, Publisher, New York. This pre-dates the version at the Polonaise nightclub in Manhattan by at least 2–3 years.
The original cocktail of vodka with seasoned tomato and clam juice made its debut at the Polonaise nightclub in Manhattan in November 1953. The drink was introduced as the &quot;Smirnoff Smiler&quot; by owner Paul Pawlowski. In December 1953, columnist Walter Winchell reported that the drink was seasoned with &quot;a dash of Wooooshhhtasheer Sauce&quot;.

In 1959, cartoonist and creator of &quot; The Addams Family&quot;, Charles Addams (employed by the New Yorker magazine, a few blocks from the Polonaise nightclub in Manhattan) claimed he invented the &quot;Gravel Gertie&quot;, a cocktail of clam/tomato juice and vodka seasoned with Tabasco sauce.

In 1962, Carl La Marca, bar manager at the Baker Hotel in Dallas, invented the &quot;Imperial Clam Digger&quot;, adding a basil garnish and dash of lime to an existing version of the &quot;Smirnoff Smiler&quot;, called the &quot;Clam Digger&quot;. 
In October 1968, Seagram president Victor Fischel and Mott&#x27;s Clamato marketer Ray Anrig claimed to have invented the seasoned tomato/clam/vodka cocktail, the &quot;Clamdigger&quot; earlier in 1968, in Manhattan. Seagram, headquartered 2 blocks from the Polonaise nightclub, filed a trademark application on the name &quot;Clamdigger&quot; claiming first use on May 31, 1968. From late 1968 to the end of 1969, Seagram and Mott&#x27;s ran a major advertising promotion of the &quot;Clam Digger&quot; cocktail recipe in national magazines.

The Caesar was invented in 1969 by restaurant manager Walter Chell of the Calgary Inn (today the Westin Hotel) in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. He devised the cocktail after being tasked to create a signature drink for the Calgary Inn&#x27;s new Italian restaurant. He mixed vodka with clam and tomato juice, Worcestershire sauce, and other spices, creating a drink similar to a Bloody Mary, but with a uniquely spicy flavour.

Chell said his inspiration came from Italy. He recalled that in Venice, they served Spaghetti alle vongole, spaghetti with tomato sauce and clams. He reasoned that the mixture of clams and tomato sauce would make a good drink, and mashed clams to form a &quot;nectar&quot; that he mixed with other ingredients.

According to Chell&#x27;s granddaughter, his Italian ancestry led him to call the drink a &quot;Caesar&quot;. The longer name of &quot;Bloody Caesar&quot; is said to differentiate the drink from the Bloody Mary, but Chell said it was a regular patron at the bar who served as the inspiration. During the three months he spent working to perfect the drink, he had customers sample it and offer feedback. One regular customer, an Englishman, who often ordered the drink said one day, &quot;Walter, that&#x27;s a damn good bloody Caesar&quot;.

==Popularity==
Chell said the drink was an immediate hit with the restaurant&#x27;s patrons, claiming it &quot;took off like a rocket&quot;. Within five years of its introduction, the Caesar had become Calgary&#x27;s most popular mixed drink. It spread throughout Western Canada, then to the east. Coinciding with its 40th anniversary, a petition was launched in 2009 in the hopes of having the Caesar named the nation&#x27;s official mixed drink. In Calgary, Mayor Dave Bronconnier celebrated the drink&#x27;s anniversary by declaring May 13, 2009 Caesar Day in the city.

The Mott&#x27;s company was independently developing Clamato, a mixture of clam and tomato juices, at the same time the Caesar was invented. Sales of Clamato were initially slow: Mott&#x27;s sold only 500 cases of Clamato in 1970, but sales consistently increased after the company&#x27;s distributors discovered Chell&#x27;s drink. By 1994, 70% of Mott&#x27;s Clamato sales in Canada were made to mix Caesars, while half of all Clamato sales were made in Western Canada. Motts claims that the Caesar is the most popular mixed drink in Canada, estimating that over 350 million Caesars are consumed every year.

In the United States, the Caesar is typically available at bars along the Canada–United States border. Elsewhere, bartenders will frequently offer a Bloody Mary in its place. In Europe, the drink can be found wherever there are higher concentrations of Canadians. The drink&#x27;s anonymity outside Canada has continued in spite of concerted marketing efforts. Producers of clam-tomato juices have speculated that their beverages have been hampered by what they describe as the &quot;clam barrier&quot;. They have found that consumers in the United States fear that there is too much clam in the beverages.

While Mott&#x27;s Clamato continues to be synonymous with the cocktail, other producers have begun offering alternative Caesar mixes. Walter Caesar (named in honor of Chell) was launched in 2013 to offer an &#x27;all-natural&#x27; alternative to Clamato. Walter Caesar also became the first Caesar mix in Canada to be approved by Ocean Wise by using ocean-friendly clam juice from the North Atlantic.

The Caesar is popular as a hangover &quot;cure&quot;, though its effectiveness has been questioned.

Mott&#x27;s holds an annual &quot;Best Caesar in Town&quot; competition as part of the Prince Edward Island International Shellfish Festival. Contests held across Canada to celebrate the cocktail&#x27;s 40th anniversary in 2009 encouraged variants that featured the glass rimmed with Tim Hortons coffee grounds, Caesars with maple syrup, and Caesars with bacon-infused vodka.

The first liquor store dedicated to the Caesar opened on July 1, 2023 in Calgary, Alberta.

==Preparation==
Basic preparation of a Caesar follows the &quot;one, two, three, four&quot; rule. The recipe calls for one shot of vodka, two dashes of hot sauce, three dashes of salt and pepper, four dashes of Worcestershire sauce and topped with of caesar mix and served with ice. The ingredients are poured into a glass rimmed with celery salt or a mixture of salt and pepper and garnished with a celery stalk and lime.

The Caesar is an unusual drink in that it can be mixed in bulk and stored for a period of time before drinking.

===Variants===
Though it was not one of Chell&#x27;s original ingredients, Tabasco sauce is a frequent addition, as is horseradish. Vodka is occasionally replaced with gin, tequila or rum, though the Clamato may not be substituted. A variant that replaces vodka with beer is commonly called a &quot;Red Eye&quot; or a &quot;Clam Eye&quot;, one with Vodka and a beer bottle on top is a &quot;Bloody MooseHead&quot;, and one without alcohol is a &quot;Virgin Caesar&quot;. The Toronto Institute of Bartending operates a &quot;Caesar School&quot; in various locations across Canada that teaches bartenders how to mix several variants of the drink.

<text>A hydraulic accumulator is a pressure storage reservoir in which an incompressible hydraulic fluid is held under pressure that is applied by an external source of mechanical energy. The external source can be an engine, a spring, a raised weight, or a compressed gas. An accumulator enables a hydraulic system to cope with extremes of demand using a less powerful pump, to respond more quickly to a temporary demand, and to smooth out pulsations. It is a type of energy storage device.

Compressed gas accumulators, also called hydro-pneumatic accumulators, are by far the most common type.

==Types of accumulator==
=== Towers ===

The first accumulators for William Armstrong&#x27;s hydraulic dock machinery were simple raised water towers. Water was pumped to a tank at the top of these towers by steam pumps. When dock machinery required hydraulic power, the hydrostatic head of the water&#x27;s height above ground provided the necessary pressure.

These simple accumulators were extremely tall. For instance, Grimsby Dock Tower, built in 1852, is tall. Because of their size, they were costly, and so were constructed for less than a decade. Around the same time, John Fowler was working on the construction of the ferry quay at nearby New Holland but could not use similar hydraulic power as the poor ground conditions did not permit a tall accumulator tower to be built. By the time Grimsby was opened, it was already obsolete as Armstrong had developed the more complex, but much smaller, weighted accumulator for use at New Holland. In 1892 the original Grimsby tower&#x27;s function was replaced, on Fowler&#x27;s advice, by a smaller weighted accumulator on an adjacent dock, although the tower remains to this day as a well-known landmark.

Other surviving towers include one adjacent to East Float in Birkenhead, England, and another located at the Bramley-Moore Dock, Liverpool, England. The latter tower is to be renovated as part of plans for the proposed development of the area associated with the construction of a new football stadium for Everton F.C.

===Raised weight===

A raised weight accumulator consists of a vertical cylinder containing fluid connected to the hydraulic line. The cylinder is closed by a piston on which a series of weights are placed that exert a downward force on the piston and thereby pressurizes the fluid in the cylinder. In contrast to compressed gas and spring accumulators, this type delivers a nearly constant pressure, regardless of the volume of fluid in the cylinder, until it is empty. (The pressure will decline somewhat as the cylinder is emptied due to the decline in weight of the remaining fluid.)

A working example of this type of accumulator may be found at the hydraulic engine house, Bristol Harbour. The original 1887 accumulator is in place in its tower, an external accumulator was added in 1954 and this system was used until 2010 to power the Cumberland Basin (Bristol) lock gates. The water is pumped from the harbour into a header tank and then fed by gravity to the pumps. The working pressure is 750 psi (5.2 MPa, or 52 bar) which was used to power the cranes, bridges and locks of Bristol Harbour.

The original operating mechanism of Tower Bridge, London, also used this type of accumulator. Although no longer in use, two of the six accumulators may still be seen &quot;in situ&quot; in the bridge&#x27;s museum.

Regent&#x27;s Canal Dock, now named Limehouse Basin has the remains of a hydraulic accumulator, dating from 1869, a fragment of the oldest remaining such facility in the world, the second at the dock, which was installed later than that at Poplar Dock, originally listed incorrectly as a signalbox for the London and Blackwall Railway, when correctly identified, it was restored as a tourist attraction by the now defunct London Docklands Development Corporation. Now owned by the Canal &amp; River Trust, it is open for large groups on application to the Dockmaster&#x27;s Office at the basin and on both the afternoons of London Open House Weekend, held on the third weekend of September each year.

London had an extensive public hydraulic power system from the mid-nineteenth century finally closing in the 1970s with 5 hydraulic power stations, operated by the London Hydraulic Power Company. Railway goods yards and docks often had their own separate system.

=== Air-filled accumulator ===

A simple form of accumulator is an enclosed volume, filled with air. A vertical section of pipe, often enlarged diameter, may be enough and fills itself with air, trapped as the pipework fills.

Such accumulators typically do not have enough capacity to be useful for storing significant power since they cannot be pre-charged with high pressure gas, but they can act as a buffer to absorb fluctuations in pressure. They are used to smooth out the delivery from piston pumps. Another use is as a shock absorber to damp out water hammer; this application is an integral part of most ram pumps. Loss of air will result in loss of effectiveness. If air is lost over time, the design must include some way to replenish the accumulator.

===Compressed gas (or gas-charged) closed accumulator===


A compressed gas accumulator consists of a cylinder with two chambers that are separated by an elastic diaphragm, a totally enclosed bladder, or a floating piston. One chamber contains the fluid and is connected to the hydraulic line. The other chamber contains an inert gas (typically nitrogen), usually under pressure, that provides the compressive force on the hydraulic fluid. Inert gas is used because oxygen and oil can form an explosive mixture when combined under high pressure. As the volume of the compressed gas changes, the pressure of the gas (and the pressure on the fluid) changes inversely.

For low pressure water system use the water usually fills a rubber bladder within the tank (pictured), preventing contact with the tank which would otherwise need to be corrosion resistant. Units designed for high-pressure applications such as hydraulic systems are usually pre-charged to a very high pressure (approaching the system operating pressure) and are designed to prevent the bladder or membrane being damaged by this internal pressure when the system pressure is low. For bladder types this generally requires the bladder to be filled with the gas so that when system pressure is zero the bladder is fully expanded rather than being crushed by the gas charge. To prevent the bladder being forced out of the device when the system pressure is low there is typically either an anti-extrusion plate attached to the bladder that presses against and seals the entrance, or a spring-loaded plate on the entrance that closes when the bladder presses against it.

It is possible to increase the gas volume of the accumulator by coupling a gas bottle to the gas side of the accumulator. For the same swing in system pressure this will result in a larger portion of the accumulator volume being used. If the pressure does not vary over a very wide range this can be a cost effective way to reduce the size of the accumulator needed. If the accumulator is not of the piston type care must be taken that the bladder or membrane will not be damaged in any expected over-pressure situation, many bladder-type accumulators cannot tolerate the bladder being crushed under pressure.

A compressed gas accumulator was invented by Jean Mercier for use in variable-pitch propellers.

===Spring type===
A spring type accumulator is similar in operation to the gas-charged accumulator above, except that a heavy spring (or springs) is used to provide the compressive force. According to Hooke&#x27;s law the magnitude of the force exerted by a spring is linearly proportional to its change of length. Therefore, as the spring compresses, the force it exerts on the fluid is increased linearly.

===Metal bellows type===
The metal bellows accumulators function similarly to the compressed gas type, except that the elastic diaphragm or floating piston is replaced by a hermetically sealed welded metal bellows. Fluid may be internal or external to the bellows. The advantages to the metal bellows type include exceptionally low spring rate, allowing the gas charge to do all the work with little change in pressure from full to empty, a long stroke that allows efficient usage of the casing volume, and the bellows can be built to be resistant to overpressure that would crush a bladder-type separator. The welded metal bellows accumulator provides an exceptionally high level of accumulator performance, and can be produced with a broad spectrum of alloys, resulting in a broad range of fluid compatibility. Other advantages to this type are that it does not face issues with high pressure operation, may be built to be resistant to very high or low temperatures or certain aggressive chemicals, and may be longer lasting in some situations. Metal bellows tend to be much more costly to produce than other common types.

== Functioning of an accumulator ==
In modern, often mobile, hydraulic systems the preferred item is a gas charged accumulator, but simple systems may be spring-loaded. There may be more than one accumulator in a system. The exact type and placement of each may be a compromise due to its effects and the costs of manufacture.

An accumulator is placed close to the pump with a non-return valve preventing flow back to the pump. In the case of piston-type pumps this accumulator is placed in the ideal location to absorb pulsations of energy from the multi-piston pump. It also helps protect the system from fluid hammer. This protects system components, particularly pipework, from both potentially destructive forces.

An additional benefit is the additional energy that can be stored while the pump is subject to low demand. The designer can use a smaller-capacity pump. The large excursions of system components, such as landing gear on a large aircraft, that require a considerable volume of fluid can also benefit from one or more accumulators. These are often placed close to the demand to help overcome restrictions and drag from long pipework runs. The outflow of energy from a discharging accumulator is much greater, for a short time, than even large pumps could generate.

An accumulator can maintain the pressure in a system for periods when there are slight leaks without the pump being cycled on and off constantly. When temperature changes cause pressure excursions the accumulator helps absorb them. Its size helps absorb fluid that might otherwise be locked in a small fixed system with no room for expansion due to valve arrangement.

The gas precharge in an accumulator is set so that the separating bladder, diaphragm or piston does not reach or strike either end of the operating cylinder. The design precharge normally ensures that the moving parts do not foul the ends or block fluid passages. Poor maintenance of precharge can destroy an operating accumulator. A properly designed and maintained accumulator should operate trouble-free for years.

<doc id="641570" wikidata="Q14093" url="?curid=641570" title="Bench press">
<text>The bench press or chest press is a weight training exercise where a person presses a weight upwards while lying horizontally on a weight training bench. The bench press is a compound movement, with the primary muscles involved being the pectoralis major, the anterior deltoids, and the triceps brachii. Other muscles located in the back, legs and core are involved for stabilization. A barbell is generally used to hold the weight, but a pair of dumbbells can also be used.

The barbell bench press is one of three lifts in the sport of powerlifting alongside the deadlift and the squat, and is the only lift in Paralympic powerlifting. The bench press is also extensively used in weight training, bodybuilding, and other types of training to develop upper body muscles, primarily the pectoralis major. To improve upper body strength, power, and endurance for athletic, occupational, and functional performance as well as muscle development, the barbell bench press is frequently used.

== Movement ==
The person performing the exercise lies on their back on a flat bench with a barbell grasped in both hands. They lower the barbell to chest level until it touches the chest, then press the barbell upwards, extending the arms until their arms are moderately straight. This is one repetition (rep).

;Powerlifting: Position yourself on a flat bench with body weight resting on your buttocks and upper traps, an arched back, and feet pressed against the floor. The weight must be lifted at full arm&#x27;s length, lowered to upper torso, paused, and then lifted to starting position. Improving performance in powerlifting involves powerlifters implementing specific techniques. These include arching, taking deep breaths, and actively pressing their feet into the floor. These methods engage all body parts during the lift, ensuring proper weight distribution across the back, legs, and the floor. While there is criticism of the back arch, it is the safest and most effective way to bench press. The main debate for the use of the back arch during the bench press in powerlifting is how it shortens ones range of motion, thus making the lift easier to perform at higher weights. This shortened range of motion allows the one performing the bench press to ultimately reduce the amount of energy exerted during the lift leading to more weight being put up.

==History==
The bench press has evolved over the years, from floor, bridge, and belly toss variations to the methods used by bodybuilders and powerlifters today. It became popular from the late 1950s onwards. Despite the fact the parallel dip is safer (the dip does not require spotters or safety bars), in the 1950s the bench press overtook the dip in popularity and became the standard chest exercise.

At first the strict floor press was the most popular method. In 1899, using a barbell with discs (plates), George Hackenschmidt, inventor of the barbell hack squat, rolled a barbell over his face (which was turned to the side) and performed a strict floor press with . This stood as a record for 18 years until Joe Nordquest broke it by in 1916.

Around this time, new methods started gaining ground. Lifters began to discover that strong glutes could help them get the bar from the ground to overhead. They would lie on the floor and position the bar over their abdomen, then perform an explosive glute bridge movement, catapulting the bar upwards and catching it at lockout.

Lifting techniques, training, and drugs have improved over the years and the bench press record lift has grown from to (raw, record held by Julius Maddox) in approximately 100 years.

==Muscles==

A conventional bench press uses the pectoralis major, front deltoids, and triceps brachii to horizontally adduct the shoulder. While flat bench pressing, the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles are activated. The exercise also uses the triceps and anconeus to extend the elbows. The triceps are most crucial around the end of the press to help complete and lock out the elbows. With the right form, parts of the deltoids will be used to help make the lift, including the anterior deltoids. Wider hand spacing places a greater emphasis on shoulder flexion and narrower hand spacing utilizes more elbow extension. Because of this, wider hand spacing is associated with training the pectorals and narrower hand spacing is associated with training the triceps. Both close and wide hand spacing train the deltoid area.

In addition to the major phasic (dynamic) muscles, the bench press also uses tonic (stabilizing) muscles, including the scapular stabilizers (serratus anterior, middle, and inferior trapezius), humeral head stabilizers (rotator cuff muscles), and core (transverse abdominis, obliques, multifidus, erector spinae, quadratus lumborum.)

==Variations==
Variations of the bench press involve different groups of muscles, or involve the same muscles in different ways:

*Inclination
**Flat bench press: The flat bench press involves both portions of the pectoralis major muscle but focuses on the lower (sternal) head as well as the anterior deltoid muscle. The term &#x27;bench press&#x27; on its own is assumed to refer to a flat bench press.
**Incline bench press: An incline elevates the shoulders and lowers the pelvis as if reclining in a chair; this variation emphasizes anterior deltoids with little emphasis on the upper (clavicular) head of the pectoralis major. This variation is called the incline bench press.
**Decline bench press: A decline bench press elevates the pelvis and lowers the head and emphasizes the lower portion of the pectoralis major whilst incorporating shoulders and triceps.

*Grip 
**Reverse grip: A reverse grip bench press utilizes an underhand (supinated) grip on the bar. A supinated grip externally rotates the humerus, which puts the shoulders in a much more favorable position for the lift, decreasing injury potential without compromising the range of motion. It emphasizes the clavicular head of the pectoralis major more than an incline bench press. On the eccentric phase of the lift, the bar path will create a larger arc and eventually touch a point on the chest that is lower compared to the regular bench press, because the upper arms and elbows are closer to the body and the angle between the humerus and the torso is smaller.
**Narrow grip (close grip): A bench press performed with the hands close together. It relies on the triceps to complete the pressing motion. Called the close grip bench press, this variation is best performed with arms in a near-vertical position to reduce strain placed upon the wrists, elbows, and shoulders. A close grip bench press can also be performed with dumbbells or a barbell with neutral grips.
**Wide grip: A bench press performed with the hands far apart. It shortens the range of motion, lessening the contribution of the triceps.
**Suicide grip (false grip, thumbless grip): Instead of the thumb being wrapped underneath the barbell, the thumb is placed next to the index finger where it sits on top of the barbell. Although it has its pros and cons, the suicide grip is sometimes used because it places the wrist in a better position, keeping shoulders safer, and allowing lifters to activate their triceps more. This grip is considered unsafe as it presents the risk of the bar rolling out of the lifters hand which in turn may cause injury by the dropped bar

*Different lowering targets
**A lifter can elect to lower the bar to nipple level, to the xiphoid process, or even further, to the abdomen.
**On the other hand, a lifter may lower the bar to a very high point on the chest, or even to the neck; the latter variation is called a guillotine press (also known as a redneck press or neck press) and emphasizes the upper pectorals.

*Altered stability: The bench press can be performed with various modifications to make the lifter or the weight less stable. Examples include lifting on a Swiss ball, using dumbbells instead of a barbell, or lifting with the legs on the bench or in the air. Lifting with the legs on the bench or out in front of the bench held in the air above the ground neutralizes the athlete&#x27;s ability to arch his back and glutes off of the bench and thereby gain an advantage while lifting. As it forces the glutes to stay anchored on the bench (it also eliminates the ability of the athlete to employ leg drive), this position is more difficult and allows for greater stress of the pectorals.

*Alternating arms: This involves using a pair of dumbbells and lifting and lowering one and then lifting and lowering the other; or lifting one while lowering the other in an alternating sequence.

*Single arm: This involves using a single dumbbell and lifting it with one arm. When both arms are exercised in this unilateral manner, it can help to ensure that the arms perform the same amount of work and any excessive muscle imbalances are reduced. For example, in a standard barbell bench press, the right arm may perform 55% of the work and the left arm 45%. However, if the right or left arm is used singularly, then it can be assured that each arm is performing 100% of the work for that respective lift. This can mean that the strength of the right and left arms develops more evenly. The single-arm bench press can also mean greater levels of core activation.

*Variable resistance: The bench press can be performed with chains or bands which are attached to either end of the barbell. They can be used to strengthen the upper range of motion in the movement and develop explosive power in the bench press. This means that the percentage of 1RM lifted for the stronger phase more closely matches the percentage 1RM for the weaker lower phase e.g., a person can lift 60 kg for one full rep (including the weaker lower phase) but can lift 90 kg for the stronger upper phase. So, by adding resistance they can better meet the respective 1RMs, in percentage terms, for both strength phases. The incorporation of chains and bands can help to develop explosive power in the bench press. An alternative is to combine heavier partial reps with lighter full reps.

*Partial rep: A partial rep usually means lowering the bar partially before raising it again i.e., for a half or quarter rep.
**Because this is a stronger ROM, significantly more weight can be lifted. When used in combination with lighter full reps, this can allow a person to better ensure that the percentage of 1RM lifted for the stronger and weaker phases of the movement is more consistent. For example, if 1RM is 100 kg for the lower phase and 150 kg for the upper phase, an 80 kg full ROM press is 80% of someone&#x27;s 1RM for a full rep and lifting 120 kg for a partial which remains in the stronger phase of the movement is 80% for that phase. Full reps at a 1RM of 100 kg prevents the stronger phase of the lift from being trained at more than about 66% of its respective 1RM of 150 kg. Performing heavier partials can help to increase strength and power and also improve a person&#x27;s 1RM for a full ROM press.
**A different form of partial rep involves training the lower most difficult part of the movement in order to strengthen it and to avoid it being a ‘sticking point’ that stops the movement of the weight.

*Equipped: An &quot;equipped&quot; bench press is performed with a stiff, supportive shirt that allows greater weights to be used. The materials and cut of the bench shirt, as well as the skill of the lifter and the rules of performance, will determine how much additional weight can be pressed in the shirt as opposed to without it. The contrast between equipped and unequipped (raw) bench press weights is illustrated in the progression of the bench press world records, with the record equipped lift exceeding the unequipped lift by hundreds of pounds.

*With minor injury: People who suffer from shoulder injuries can use a specialized barbell such as the Swiss Bar or Football Bar that allows them to hold the bar in a neutral grip, reducing the amount of internal rotation on the shoulder. It also engages the shoulder more, increasing power in upper body movements. Another variation is the hex press in which two dumbbells are squeezed against each other, with the palms facing inwards. This puts the strain of the exercise on the triceps and inner chest rather than the shoulders. The Floor Press is another variation that puts less strain on the lifter&#x27;s shoulders, due to the shorter range of motion.

==Possible injuries==

Performing the bench press can contribute to multiple types of injuries:
*Torn ligaments / tendons in shoulders
*Injuries to the trapezius muscle
*Elbow / wrist strains
*Cracked or broken ribs, usually the result of bouncing the bar off of the chest to add momentum to the lift, or a loss of strength causing the bar to fall onto the chest.
*Distal clavicular osteolysis: bone spur or erosion at the end of the clavicle. Athletes suffering from this condition should avoid doing bench presses.
*Torn or damaged rotator cuff
*Pectoral muscle tear
*Cervical discopathy or, in extreme cases, spinal cord injury. While the mechanism is not clear, lifting the neck or arching the back and leaning on the lower neck while pressing the weight could stress the area.
*Death by asphyxiation by being trapped under the bar (several each year).
*Subclavian vein thrombosis 
Many of these possible injuries can be avoided by using dumbbells instead of a barbell since dumbbells can be dropped without hitting the chest or neck, while also allowing greater external rotation of the shoulder which can help prevent shoulder injuries. Studies have also shown dumbbell bench press activates the pectorals more, which can lead to increased muscle growth.

<text>Osteology () is the scientific study of bones, practiced by osteologists. A subdiscipline of anatomy, anthropology, and paleontology, osteology is the detailed study of the structure of bones, skeletal elements, teeth, microbone morphology, function, disease, pathology, the process of ossification from cartilaginous molds, and the resistance and hardness of bones (biophysics).

Osteologists frequently work in the public and private sector as consultants for museums, scientists for research laboratories, scientists for medical investigations and/or for companies producing osteological reproductions in an academic context.

Osteology and osteologists should not be confused with the pseudoscientific practice of osteopathy and its practitioners, osteopaths.

== Methods ==
A typical analysis will include:

* an inventory of the skeletal elements present
* a dental inventory
* aging data, based upon epiphyseal fusion and dental eruption (for subadults) and deterioration of the pubic symphysis or sternal end of ribs (for adults)
* stature and other metric data
* ancestry
* non-metric traits
* pathology and/or cultural modifications

== Applications ==
Osteological approaches are frequently applied to investigations in disciplines such as vertebrate paleontology, zoology, forensic science, physical anthropology, and archaeology. It has been shown that osteological characters have greater consistency with molecular phylogenies than non-osteological (soft tissue) characters, implying that they may be more reliable in reconstructing evolutionary history. Osteology has a place in research on topics including:
* Ancient warfare
* Activity patterns
* Criminal investigations
* Demography
* Developmental biology
* Diet
* Disease
* Genetics of early populations
* Fossil assemblages
* Health
* Human migration
* Identification of unknown remains
* Physique
* Social inequality
* War crimes

===Human osteology and forensic anthropology===
Examination of human osteology is often used in forensic anthropology, which is usually used to identify age, death, sex, growth, and development of human remains and can be used in a biocultural context.

There are four factors leading to variation in skeletal anatomy: ontogeny (or growth), sexual dimorphism, geographic variation and individual, or idiosyncratic, variation.

Osteology can also determine an individual&#x27;s ancestry, race or ethnicity. Historically, humans were typically grouped into three outdated race groups: caucasoids, mongoloids and negroids. However, this classification system is growing less reliable due to interancestrial marriages increases and markers become less defined. Determination of ancestry is controversial, but can give an understandable label to define the ancestry of an unidentified body or skeleton.

== Crossrail Project ==
One example of osteology and its various applications is illustrated by the Crossrail Project. An endeavor by the city of London to expand their railway system inadvertently uncovered 25 human skeletons at Charterhouse Square in 2013. Although archaeological excavation of the skeletons temporarily halted further advances in the railway system, they have given way to new, possibly revolutionary, discoveries in the field of archaeology.

These 25 skeletal remains, along with many more that were found in further searches, are believed to be from the mass graves dug to bury the millions of victims of the Black Death in the 14th century. Archaeologists and forensic scientists have used osteology to examine the condition of the skeletal remains, to help piece together the reason why the Black Death had such a detrimental effect on the European population. It was discovered that most of the population was in generally poor health to begin with. Through extensive analysis of the bones, it was discovered that many of the inhabitants of Great Britain were plagued with rickets, anemia, and malnutrition. There has also been frequent evidence that much of the population had traces of broken bones from frequent fighting and hard labor.

This archaeological project has been named the Crossrail Project. Archaeologists will continue to excavate and search for remains to help uncover missing pieces of history. These advances in our understanding of the past will be improved by the study of other skeletons buried in the same area.

<text>The Pana-Wave Laboratory () is a Japanese new religious group or &quot;Shinshūkyō&quot;. Estimates of membership range from several hundred to 1,200.

== Origin ==
Pana-Wave is an offshoot of a religious group called Chino-Shoho (&quot;True Law of Chino&quot;) based in Shibuya, Tokyo, founded by a woman called Yuko Chino in 1977 and combining elements of Christianity, Buddhism and New Age doctrines.

In the mid-1980s, members calling themselves the &quot;scientific faction&quot;, and warning of the evils of electromagnetic waves (which the group claimed were causing catastrophic environmental destruction and climate change) built the Pana-Wave Laboratory in Fukui Prefecture in an area they believed was less at risk from electromagnetic pollution. Members started to dress only in white in the mid-1990s, in the belief that this would protect them from harmful &quot;scalar electromagnetic waves&quot;, which they claimed were being used against them by communists to try to kill their leader.

In 1994 the group formed a convoy of white vans which traveled around rural Japan searching for a place least at risk from harmful electromagnetic radiation and away from power lines, and setting up camp in remote locations for months on end and covering everything in white. They also took their leader Chino when she was ill with cancer into the mountains of Japan to search for a safe place where waves couldn&#x27;t harm her anymore. They believed that if the waves got to their leader that all of mankind would all at once be destroyed.

== Incidents in 2003 ==
They first attracted attention in March 2003, when they attempted (and failed) to capture Tama-chan, an Arctic seal which had become a national celebrity in Japan since showing up in Tama River in Tokyo the previous year. The group believed that the seal had been led astray by electromagnetic waves, and claimed that doomsday would somehow be averted if the seal was returned to Arctic waters. They had even built two swimming pools, lined in white, in a compound in Yamanashi Prefecture in which to hold the seal until it could be transferred to the Arctic.

The group made national headlines in April when the convoy was ordered by police to move on from a road in Gifu Prefecture and refused, resulting in a stand-off which was reported in the national media. Pana-Wave alleged that a close encounter with an undiscovered 10th planet, predicted for 15 May that year, would cause the Earth&#x27;s poles to flip over and lead to catastrophic earthquakes and tsunamis which would destroy most of humankind, and that they were looking for a safe location to ride out the catastrophe. TV images showed members dressed completely in white, complete with white hoods, surgical masks and white boots. Their vehicles were decorated with swirl patterns which they believed neutralised the invisible waves, and even the steering wheel was covered in white plaster. Nearby trees, bushes and crash barriers were also covered in white fabric. TV crews were first shunned by members who feared that TV cameras were emitting harmful waves, but were later allowed closer as long as they covered themselves and their equipment in white material.

This camp was eventually broken up by three hundred police, some in riot gear, who threatened to arrest them for obstructing traffic. The convoy moved on, setting up camp intermittently, but many in Japan were unnerved by the group, which evoked memories of Aum Shinrikyo, a religious terrorist group which carried out the deadly sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995, and the convoy continued being turned away from village after village. In the lead-up to the supposed doomsday, some one hundred riot police and TV crew followed the highly photogenic convoy around rural Japan for several weeks to keep tabs on their activities.

On 14 May, the day before the predicted doomsday, police raided twelve locations associated with the group on the pretext of minor vehicle registration offences. However, nothing was found which suggested that they posed a danger to society.

When the May 15 doomsday passed with nothing more serious than a minor earthquake in Tokyo which injured one boy who fell off his bed and broke an arm, a member thought to be Chino&#x27;s second-in-command made a statement that they believed that they had miscalculated the date, and a new date of May 22 was set. However, as this date again passed without incident, media attention faded and the group sank back into obscurity.

On 25 October 2006, Chino died aged 72.

<doc id="641595" wikidata="Q5121445" url="?curid=641595" title="Circle changeup">
<text>In baseball, a circle changeup (also called the okay changeup, related to the thumb and index finger touching) or circle change is a pitch thrown with a grip that includes a circle formation, hence the name circle changeup. The circle is formed by making a circle with the index finger, holding the thumb at the bottom of the ball parallel to the middle finger and holding the ball far out in the hand. The ball is thrown turning the palm out (pronating the forearm).

==Throwing mechanics==

A circle change can also be used to provide movement like a two seam fastball but without the stress placed on the arm by a traditional screwball. By placing the index and ring fingers slightly to the inside (that is, towards the thumb) of the ball and sharply pronating the forearm at release, a pitcher can make the ball move downward and inside. Pitchers with smaller hands will only place the index finger slightly to the inside (that is, towards the thumb) of the ball. A left-handed pitcher&#x27;s circle change will break down and away from a right-handed batter. Effective circle changeups can reduce the platoon split a pitcher will experience.

To follow proper form, a pitcher releases the ball while keeping his wrist straight, then follows through fully. Additional change in velocity can be achieved by dragging the foot that would normally follow through fully with a fastball delivery. However, the most effective way to reduce the velocity of a changeup is by slightly reducing stride length. If the typical stride length for the pitcher&#x27;s fastball is around 80-90% of pitcher&#x27;s height, then the pitcher would need to reduce stride by 10-20%. By doing so, the pitcher eliminates the possibility of tipping off the pitch. Simply using a slower arm motion is undesirable, as it may tip off the batter, and will invariably result in less movement on the pitch. If this pitch is placed too high in the strike zone, it can be hit very hard. It is an effective pitch to throw early in the count to produce a groundball; it is not traditionally used to acquire a strikeout. By rotating the wrist (before the release) the pitcher can change the movement from resembling a fastball to resembling a curveball.

Like other changeups, an effective circle changeup must be thrown with an identical arm action to a fastball to avoid tipping off the batter.

==Pitchers==

Johan Santana, Pedro Martínez, Cole Hamels, Huston Street, Zack Greinke, Kyle Hendricks and Marco Estrada are pitchers who rely or relied heavily on their circle changeup. Former New York Mets closer John Franco was able to generate so much movement on his circle changeup that it mimicked a screwball. Atlanta Braves pitcher Tom Glavine was known for using the outside corner of the plate with his circle changeup, and his teammate, Greg Maddux, relied heavily on the circle change as an out pitch to both left-and right-handed batters. Minnesota Twins ace Frank Viola also used the circle changeup to great effect, as did former Atlanta Braves pitcher Charlie Leibrandt and Cincinnati Reds pitcher Mario Soto. Recently, Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Hyun-jin Ryu used a circle changeup efficiently throughout his first MLB season, throwing a circle changeup that was gripped using the index finger on the seam of the ball and the thumb on the side of the ball to &quot;choke&quot; the ball. According to his autobiography, Nolan Ryan also developed his own circle changeup to add another off-speed pitch without having to throw a slider (as sliders are believed to more frequently cause injuries).

<text>The Cephissus (), called the Boeotian Cephissus to distinguish it from other rivers of the same name, or Kifisos () is a river in central Greece. Its drainage basin is . The river rises at Lilaia in Phocis, on the northwestern slope of Mount Parnassus. It flows east through the Boeotian plain, passing the towns Amfikleia, Kato Tithorea and Orchomenos. It drained into Lake Copais, which was therefore also called the Cephisian Lake, until 1887, when the lake was eliminated in favor of agricultural land. An artificial outflow has been created to Lake Yliki (ancient Hylice), further east.

==Hydrology==
The Cephisus, a post-glacial river, never had sufficient flow deriving from drainage to establish a clear channel to the Gulf of Euboea. Its main flow was seasonal melt water, which collected in a three-lake system in the lowlands of Boeotia. First it entered Lake Copais, which was never more than a wetland a few feet deep. Today it has been totally drained for agriculture, revealing katabothra, or caves in the karst topography leading down to Lake Yliki as well as Bronze-Age works to stem the flow. There was never enough cross-section to totally drain the marsh, and no surface channels between lakes.

The underground paths to Lake Yliki are now open, causing its level to rise sufficiently to drown all traces of Bronze-age settlement in its valley. Lake Yliki connects by underground channels to Lake Paralimni, which hangs over the Gulf of Euboea. It was never connected to the Gulf by surface channel, but some water is believed to have escaped via the katabothra. 

The artificial adjustment of the lake waters was an engineering problem of some magnitude in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the later 20th century the waters of the two remaining lakes were preempted by the Athens aqueduct. The city of Athens had grown to include one-third of the population of Greece. Waters were being tapped from rivers as far away as western Greece through deep tunnels, which take advantage of the difference in altitude. The mountains are primarily of limestone, which is soft enough to present easy tunneling, whether under the Pindus mountains, beneath the passes of the Alps, or through the ridges of Italy.

==Mythology==
In Greek mythology, the river god Cephissus was associated with this river. Pausanias records a Theban tradition that the river Cephissus formerly flowed under a mountain and entered the sea until Heracles blocked the passage and diverted the water into the Orchomenian plain. Pausanias also says that the Lilaeans on certain days threw cakes and other customary items into the spring of the Cephissus and that they would reappear in the Castalian Spring.

==History==
The Cephissus valley is of strategic importance, connecting northern Greece via the passes of Mount Oeta and Mount Kallidromo (including Thermopylae) to southern Greece and the Gulf of Corinth. As a result, in the Frankish period a chain of forts and watchtowers was established along its course by the rulers of the Duchy of Athens.

<text>A stave church is a medieval wooden Christian church building once common in north-western Europe. The name derives from the building&#x27;s structure of post and lintel construction, a type of timber framing where the load-bearing ore-pine posts are called &quot;stafr&quot; in Old Norse (&quot;stav&quot; in modern Norwegian). Two related church building types also named for their structural elements, the post church and palisade church, are often called &#x27;stave churches&#x27;.

Originally much more widespread, most of the surviving stave churches are in Norway. The only remaining medieval stave churches outside Norway are: Hedared stave church () in Sweden and the Vang Stave Church which was built in Norway and relocated in 1842 to contemporary Karpacz in the Karkonosze mountains of Poland. One other church, the Anglo-Saxon Greensted Church in England, exhibits many similarities with a stave church but is generally considered a palisade church.

== Construction ==

Archaeological excavations have shown that stave churches are descended from palisade constructions and from later churches with earth-bound posts.

Similar palisade constructions are known from buildings from the Viking Age. Logs were split in two halves, set or rammed into the earth (generally called post in ground construction) and given a roof. This proved a simple but very strong form of construction. If set in gravel, the wall could last many decades, even centuries. An archaeological excavation in Lund uncovered the postholes of several such churches.

In post churches, the walls were supported by sills, leaving only the posts earth-bound. Such churches are easy to spot at archaeological sites as they leave very distinct holes where the posts were once placed. Occasionally some of the wood remains, making it possible to date the church more accurately using radiocarbon dating or dendrochronology. Under the Urnes Stave Church, remains of two such churches have been found, with Christian graves discovered beneath the oldest church structure.

A single church of palisade construction has been discovered under the Hemse stave church.

The next design phase resulted from the observation that earthbound posts were susceptible to humidity, causing them to rot away over time. To prevent this, the posts were placed on top of large stones, significantly increasing their lifespans. The Røldal Stave Church is believed to be of this type.

In later churches the posts were set on a raised sill frame resting on stone foundations. This is the stave church in its most mature form.

It is now common to group the churches into two categories: the first, without free-standing posts, often referred to as Type A; and the second, with a raised roof and free-standing internal posts, usually called Type B.

Those with the raised roof, Type B, are often further divided into two subgroups. The first of these, the Kaupanger group, have a whole arcade row of posts and intermediate posts along the sides and details that mimic stone capitals. These churches give an impression of a basilica.

The other subgroup is the Borgund group. In these churches the posts are connected halfway up with one or two horizontal double ″pincer beams″ with semicircular indentations, clasping the row of posts from both sides. Cross-braces are inserted between the posts and the upper and lower pincer beams (or above the single pincer beam), forming a very rigid interconnection, and resembling the triforium of stone basilicas. This design made it possible to omit the freestanding lower part of intermediate posts. In some churches only the four corner posts remain (for example in Lomen Stave Church).

Many stave churches had or still have outer galleries or ambulatories around their whole perimeters, loosely connected to the plank walls. These probably served to protect the church from a harsh climate, and for processions.

=== Single-nave church, Type A ===
At the base of Type A churches, there are four heavy sill beams on a low foundation of stones. These are interconnected in the corner notch, forming a rigid sill frame. The corner posts or staves () are cross-cut at the lower end and fit over the corner notches and cover them, protecting them from moisture.

On top of the sill beam is a groove into which the lower ends of the wall planks () fit. The last wall plank is wedge-shaped and rammed into place. When the wall is filled in with planks, the frame is completed by a wall plate () with a groove on the bottom, holding the top ends of the wall planks. The whole structure consists of framesa sill frame resting on the stone foundation, and the four wall frames made up of sills, corner posts and wall plate.

The wall plates support the roof trusses, consisting of a pair of principal rafters and an additional pair of intersecting &quot;scissor rafters&quot;. For lateral bracing, additional wooden brackets () are inserted between the rafters.

Every piece is locked into position by other pieces, making for a very rigid construction; yet all points otherwise susceptible to the harsh weather are covered.
* The single-nave church has a square nave and a narrower square choir. This type of stave church was common at the beginning of the 12th century.
* The long church (), has a rectangular plan with nave and choir of the same width. The nave will usually take up two-thirds of the whole length. This type was common at the end of the 13th century.
* The center-post church (), has a single central post reaching all the way up to and connected to the roof construction. But the roof is a simple hipped one, without the raised central part of the Type B churches. This variation on the common type of church, found in Numedal and Hallingdal, dates to around 1200.

Single-nave churches in Norway: Grip, Haltdalen, Undredal, Hedal, Reinli, Eidsborg, Rollag, Uvdal, Nore, Høyjord, Røldal, and Garmo.

The only remaining church of this type outside Norway is the Hedared stave church church in Sweden, which shows similarities with the Haltdalen Stave Church.

=== Church with a raised roof, Type B ===
On the stone foundation, four huge ground beams () are placed like a sign, their ends protruding from the lap joint where they intersect. The ends of these beams support the sills of the outer walls, forming a separate horizontal frame. The tall internal posts are placed on the internal frame of ground beams, and carry the main roof above the central nave (). On the outer frame of sills rest the main wall planks (), carrying the roof over the pentice or aisles () surrounding the central space. The roof thus slopes down in two steps, as in a basilica.

The tall internal posts () are interconnected with brackets (), and also connected to the outer walls with aisle rafters, creating a laterally rigid construction. Closer to the top of the posts (), shorter sills inserted between them support the upper wall (). On top of the posts wall plates () support the roof trusses, similar to those of the single-nave churches.

The Kaupanger group consists of: Kaupanger, Urnes, Hopperstad, and Lom.
The Borgund group consists of: Borgund, Gol, Hegge, Høre, Lomen, Ringebu, and Øye.

This form of a church can also be recognized from the holes which remain from earlier earth-bound post churches built on the same sites. Little is known about what these older churches actually looked like or how they were constructed, as they were all destroyed or replaced many centuries ago.

=== Construction techniques ===
==== Palisade work ====
The oldest technique is often called palisade work and was a self-supporting wall construction with densely placed earthen pillars or planks, which enclosed a room and at the same time carried the roof. Later, split logs were used, which gave the walls a flat inside, and the edges could be leveled or fitted with tongue and groove. Palisade churches have not been found in Norway.

To prevent early decay, the posts or planks were tarred, and the lower ends were charred by burning. The palisade rows were often placed in ditches filled with stone. It was long thought that this technique disappeared before the turn of the last millennium, but new research shows that it was in use right up to the beginning of the 12th century.

The only structure in this technique that has survived into our time is a wall in the middle section of Greensted Church in England. This led to this church being for a long time considered the oldest wooden structure in Europe. A common dating of the church was about the year 845, but modern dendrochronological dating estimates the church&#x27;s year of construction to the period just after the year 1053 (+10 / −55 years).

==== The post technique ====
By lifting the pole planks up from the ground and placing them on sleepers clamped between more powerful corner or intermediate posts, the risk of rot damage was reduced. Thinner materials could then be used in the complementary parts of the construction. Earthen piles of coarse round timber could stand for a relatively long time before rotting. They may have been scorched at the lower end to avoid premature decay.

Postholes, often with remnants of the former pillars, have been found under or near several stave churches and in places where legends say that there must have been churches. Remains of approximately 25 pillar buildings have been identified in Norway, and indirect traces of 7–8 more. Remains of pillar churches are also found under stone churches such as Mære and Kinsarvik.

Many of the earliest churches in Norway were built using this technique, but no such buildings have survived. It is an open question whether limited life was the reason why they were replaced by real stave churches with sleepers, or whether there were other reasons. Some of the older materials found in several of the stave churches are thought to originate from such early pillar churches, in particular at the Urnes stave church in Luster, where many building parts with wooden sheds in the urn style must have belonged to an older church. It has now been proven that the reused building parts originally belonged to the current church&#x27;s forerunner, dendrochronologically dated to the period 1070–1080. However, this was not a post church, but a real stave church where corner poles and wall planks stood on sleepers.

Håkon Christie assumed that the post construction fell out of use because the posts rotted from below. Jørgen H. Jensenius believes that archaeological material does not provide unequivocal support for Christie&#x27;s hypothesis; a change in size or transition to a stone church may also explain why excavated pillars fell out of use. Røldal Stave Church may have had some pillars set in the ground until 1913. In Lom Stave Church, the stone foundations have been laid approximately directly over the refilled postholes. Apart from different foundation methods, Jensenius believes that the pillar churches were essentially similar to stave churches.

==== Stave work ====

Of buildings from the Middle Ages with standing timber in load-bearing structures, only the churches in the last developed method of construction, the stave, have been left standing in our time. By lifting the entire structure up on stone foundations and placing the poles on sleepers, the life of the structure was significantly extended. The technique was developed as early as the 11th century, but it has only been proven in the forerunner of the current stave church. This was also a real stave church, since both the corner stakes and the tiles have stood on sleepers that were reused as foundations for the existing church.

Stone as a base for poles was used as early as Roman times and additional walls in sleepers may have been used from the 400s and 600s.

=== Size ===

Lorentz Dietrichson believed that the stave churches were originally small and only later built with larger dimensions. He believed that the background for this was the construction technique. He points out that the youngest churches in the Møre type are the largest. He calculated the ground plan and area for 79 churches, and the nine largest were all in Sunnmøre with Hjørundfjord, Volda, and Norddal of over . This is three times larger than, for example, Urnes and Hopperstad. According to Dietrichson, the large size of the stave churches in Sunnmøre were partly a result of later expansions. He estimated the cross arms of Volda Stave Church at . Hjørundfjord Stave Church was a &quot;half-cross church&quot; with only one cross arm measuring . The first stave church had cross arms of after expansion. Dietrichson was unsure whether the cross arms in the Møre churches were generally added in the lath construction or whether it was a medieval stave construction. He concluded that several were originally listed as cruciform churches in stakes, including Hareid, Volda, Vatne and Ørsta. For some other churches (Bremsnes and Kornstad on Nordmøre), contemporary sources say that the cross arms were later added to the lumber. According to Håkon Christie, these churches of the Møre type had a simpler construction and were both larger and longer than the other types. Roar Hauglid estimated that most (80–90%) of the medieval Norwegian stave churches were simple single-nave buildings (Type A) and most were relatively small. Hauglid called these &quot;the ordinary Norwegian stave church&quot;.

== History ==


Stave churches were once common in northern Europe. In Norway alone, it was thought about 1000 were built; recent research has increased this estimate and it is now believed there may have been closer to 2000.

=== Norway ===
Norwegian stave churches older than the 1100s are known only from written sources or from archaeological excavations, but written sources are sparse and difficult to interpret. Only 271 masonry churches were constructed in Norway during the same period, of which 160 still exist, while in Sweden and Denmark there were 900 and 1800 masonry churches respectively. Frostathing Law and Gulating law rules about &quot;corner posts&quot; show that the stave church was the standard church building in Norway, even though the Catholic church preferred stone. All wooden churches in Norway before the reformation were constructed with staves. Log building is younger than stave building in Norway, and was introduced in residential buildings around year 1000. Stave building is not influenced by the log technique. Only 29 stave churches have survived in Norway. Most of these were built between 1150 and 1350. 

The word &quot;stave church&quot; is unknown in Old Norse, presumably because there were no other types of wooden churches. When Norway&#x27;s churches after the Reformation were constructed from logs, there was a need for a separate term for the older churches. In written sources from the Middle Ages, there is a clear distinction between &quot;stafr&quot; (posts) and &quot;þili&quot; or &quot;vægþili&quot; (wall boards). However, in documents from the 1600–1700s, &quot;stave&quot; was also used for wall boards or panels. Emil Eckhoff in his &quot;Svenska stavkyrkor&quot; (1914–1916) also included wood-frame church buildings without posts.

According to Norway&#x27;s oldest written laws and Old Norwegian Homily Book, the consecration of the church was valid as long as the four corner posts were standing. One of the sermons in the old homily book is known as the &quot;stave church sermon&quot;. The sermon dates from around 1100 and was presumably performed at consecrations, or on their anniversaries. The sermon text is a theological interpretation of the building elements in the church. It names most of the building elements in the stave church, and can be a source of terminology and technique. For instance, the sermon says: &quot;The four corner posts of the church are a symbol for the four gospels, because their teachings are the strongest supports within the whole of Christianity.&quot;

Church building was mentioned in the &quot;Gulatingsloven&quot; (Gulating Law), which was written down in the 1000s. In the chapter on Christianity, the 12th article states:
In Norway, stave churches were gradually replaced; many survived until the 19th century when a substantial number were destroyed. Today, 28 historical stave churches remain standing in Norway. Stave churches were particularly common in less populated areas in high valleys and forest land, and in fishermen&#x27;s villages on islands and minor villages along fjords. By about 1800, 322 stave churches were still known in Norway, most of them in sparsely populated areas. If the main church was masonry, the annex church could be a stave church. Masonry churches were mostly built in towns, along the coast, and in rich agricultural areas in Trøndelag and eastern Norway, as well as in the larger parishes in fjord districts in western Norway. No new churches were built in Norway during the 1400s and 1500s. Norway&#x27;s stave churches largely disappeared until 1700 and were replaced by log buildings. Several stave churches were redesigned or enlarged using different techniques during 1600–1700; for instance, Flesberg Stave Church was converted into a cruciform church partly in log construction. According to Dietrichson, most stave churches were dismantled to make room for a new church, partly because the old church had become too small for the congregation, and partly because the stave church was in poor condition. Fire, storm, avalanche and decay were other reasons. In 1650 there were about 270 stave churches left in Norway, and in the next hundred years 136 of these disappeared. There were still 95 stave churches in 1800, while over 200 former stave churches were still known by name or in written sources. From 1850 to 1885, 32 stave churches disappeared; since then only the Fantoft Stave Church has been lost.

Heddal stave church was the first stave church described in a scholarly publication, when Johannes Flintoe wrote an essay in &quot;Samlinger til det Norske Folks Sprog og Historie&quot; (Christiania, 1834). The book also printed Flintoe&#x27;s drawings of the facade, the ground floor and the floor plan – the first known architectural drawing of a stave church.

Between 1950 and 1970, postholes from older buildings were discovered under Lom stave church as well as under masonry churches such as Kinsarvik Church, and this discovery was an important contribution to understanding the origin of stave churches. Postholes were first identified during excavations in Urnes stave church.

=== Other countries ===
The number of stave churches constructed in Iceland and the rest of Europe is unknown. Some believe they were the first type of church to be constructed in Scandinavia; however, the post churches are an older type, although the difference between the two is slight. A stave church has a lower construction set on a frame, whereas a post church has earth-bound posts.

In Sweden, the stave churches were considered obsolete in the Middle Ages and were replaced. In Denmark, traces of post churches have been found at several locations, and there are also parts still in existence from some of them. A plank of one such church was found in Jutland. The plank is now on display at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen and an attempt at reconstructing the church is a featured display at the Moesgård Museum near Aarhus. Marks created by several old post churches have also been found at the old stone church in Jelling.

In Sweden, the medieval Hedared stave church was constructed c. 1500 at the same location as a previous stave church. Other notable places are Maria Minor church in Lund, with its traces of a post church with palisades, and some old parts of Hemse stave church on Gotland. In Skåne alone there were around 300 such churches when Adam of Bremen visited Denmark in the first half of the 11th century, but how many of those were stave churches or post churches is unknown.

In England, there is one similar church of Saxon origin, with much debate as to whether it is a stave church or predates them. This is the Greensted Church in Essex. General consensus categorizes it as Saxon Type A. Another church bears similarities to stave churches, the medieval stone church of St. Mary in Kilpeck in Herefordshire. It features a number of dragon heads.

In Germany, there is one stone church with a motif depicting a dragon similar to those often seen on Norwegian stave churches and on surviving artifacts from Denmark and Gotland. Whether this decoration can be attributed to cultural similarities or whether it indicates similar construction methods in Germany has sparked controversy.

Replica stave churches have been built in several American communities, mostly in the Upper Midwest, with Norwegian or Islandic immigrant populations.

=== Influences ===

Lorentz Dietrichson in his book &quot;De norske Stavkirker&quot; (&quot;The Norwegian Stave Churches&quot;) (1892) claimed that the stave church is &quot;a brilliant translation of the Romanesque basilica from stone to wood&quot; (&quot;En genial oversettelse fra sten til tre av den romanske basilika&quot;). Dietrichson claimed that Type B displays an influence from early Christian and Roman basilicas. The style was assumed to be transferred via Anglo-Saxon and Irish architecture, where only the particular roof construction was local. Dietrichson emphasized the clerestory, arcades and capitals. The &quot;basilica theory&quot; was introduced by N. Nicolaysen in &quot;Mindesmærker af Middelalderens Kunst i Norge&quot; (1854). Nicolaysen wrote: &quot;Our stave churches are now the only remaining of its kind, and according to the sparse records and known circumstances, it appears that nothing similar existed except perhaps in Britain and Ireland.&quot; (&quot;&quot;Vore stavkirker er nu de eneste i sit slags, og saavidt sparsomme beretninger og andre omstændigheder lader formode, synes de heller ikke tidligere at have havt noget sidestykke med undtagelse af maaske i Storbritannien og Irland&quot;.&quot;) Nicolaysen further claimed that the layout and design may have been inspired by Byzantine architecture. Nicolaysen wrote: &quot;All facts suggest that the stave churches like the masonry churches and all medieval architecture in Western Europe originated from the Roman basilica.&quot; (&quot;Alt synes at henpege paa, at forbilledet til vore stavkirker ligesom til stenkirkerne og overhovedet til hele den vesteuropæiske arkitektur i middelalderen er udgaaet fra den romerske basilika.&quot;) This theory was further developed by Anders Bugge and Roar Hauglid. Peter Anker believed that the influence from foreign masonry architecture was primarily in decorative details.

Per Jonas Nordhagen does not reject the basilica theory, but suggests development along two paths and that the basilical was a development towards larger and technically more sophisticated churches. The main, progressive path according to Nordhagen lead to Torpo and Borgund.

Folklore and circumstantial evidence seem to suggest that stave churches were built upon old indigenous Norse worship sites, the &quot;hof&quot;. Dietrichson believed that the stave churches were closely connected to the hof and the &quot;hof theory&quot; attracted interest in the 1930s and 1940s. The theory assumed that the hofs had a square, raised roof supported by four columns. During Christianization of Norway local chiefs were forced to either dismantle the hofs or to convert hofs into churches. Bugge and Norberg-Schultz accordingly claimed that &quot;there is no reason to believe that the last hofs and the first churches had any major differences&quot; (&quot;og da er det liten grunn til å tro at de siste hov har skilt seg synderlig fra de første kirker&quot;). This assumption has been rejected by archeological evidence several times, in the case of Iceland by Åge Roussel. Olaf Olsen described the hof merely as function related to ordinary buildings on major farms. If the hof was a particular building they remain to be identified, according to Olsen. Olsen rejected the hof theory. Nicolay Nicolaysen also concluded that there is not a single known case of a hof that was converted to a church.

Lack of historical evidence for hofs as buildings undermines the hof theory. Nicolaysen also introduced the community centre hypothesis which argued that hofs were destroyed and churches constructed on the same convenient location for the local community. Location near a previous hof would then be a coincidence, according to Nicolaysen. Pope Gregory I encouraged (year 601) Augustine of Canterbury to reuse pre-Christian temples, but this had little relevance for Norway according to Nicolaysen. Jan Brendalsmo in his dissertation concluded that churches were often established on major farms or farms of local chiefs and close to feasting halls or graveyards.

Stave churches sometimes appear to have built upon or used materials from old pagan worship sites and are considered to be the best evidence for the existence of Norse Pagan temples and the best guide as to what they looked like. The layout of the churches is believed to have mimicked old Pagan temples in design and was possibly designed in order to adhere to old Norse cosmological beliefs, especially as some churches were built around a central point like a world tree. Stave churches were also often located near or in the sight of large natural formations which also had a significant role in Norse Paganism, thus also suggesting a form of continuity through placement and symbolism. Furthermore, dragons&#x27; heads and other clear mythological symbolism suggests the cultural blending of Norse mythological beliefs and Christianity in a non-contradictory synthesis. Owing to this evidence newer research has suggested that Christianity was introduced into Norway much earlier than was previously assumed.

=== Church arsons and attempts ===
While church fires of wooden churches in Norway are relatively common, due to wood&#x27;s flammable nature, from 1992 to 1995, the number rose dramatically. Between 1992 and 1996, there were at least 50 attacks on Christian churches in Norway, some of which were Stave churches. Members of the Norwegian black metal scene are thought to be largely responsible; in every arson case that was solved, those responsible were black metal fans.

The first church burned was Norway&#x27;s Fantoft Stave Church, which was burnt to the ground in June 1992. Police believe Varg Vikernes of the metal band Burzum was responsible, and the cover of Burzum&#x27;s EP &quot;Aske&quot; (&quot;ashes&quot;) is a photograph of the destroyed church. On 16 May 1994, Vikernes was found guilty for burning down the Holmenkollen Chapel, Skjold Church, and Åsane Church. Those convicted for church burnings showed no remorse and described their actions as a symbolic &quot;retaliation&quot; against Christianity in Norway. Vikernes would come to be seen as &quot;the perpetrator of a few and inspiration for many of the fires&quot;.

The following is a partial list of the church arsons:

1992
*23 May: attempted burning of Storetveit Church in Bergen Municipality.
*6 June: burning of Fantoft stave church in Bergen – Varg Vikernes is strongly suspected as the culprit, but was not convicted.
*1 August: burning of Revheim Church in Stavanger Municipality.
*21 August: burning of Holmenkollen Chapel in Oslo Municipality – Varg Vikernes and Faust were convicted for this; Euronymous also participated, but was murdered in August 1993.

*13 September: burning of Skjold Church in Vindafjord Municipality – Varg Vikernes and Samoth were convicted for this.
*3 October: burning of Hauketo Church in Oslo Municipality.
*24 December: burning of Åsane Church in Bergen Municipality – Varg Vikernes and Jørn Inge Tunsberg were convicted for this.
*25 December: burning of a Methodist church in Sarpsborg Municipality – a firefighter was killed while fighting this fire.
1993
*7 February: burning of Lundby New Church in Gothenburg, Sweden.

== Architecture and decoration ==

Even though the wooden churches had structural differences, they give a recognizable general impression. Formal differences may hide common features of their planning, while apparently similar buildings may turn out to have their structural elements organized completely differently. Despite this, certain basic principles must have been common to all types of building.

Basic geometrical figures, numbers that were easy to work with, one or just a few length units and simple ratios, and perhaps proportions, were among the theoretical aids all builders inherited. The specialist was the man who knew a particular type of building so well that he could systematise its elements in a slightly different way from previous building designs, thus carrying developments a stage further.

&quot;Exposing the timber frame on the interior and/or exterior of the structures is seen to release its matrix of timber members and its capacity to contribute architectural expression to buildings. The matrix, forming ‘lines’ in space, has an expressive potential that includes the capacity to delineate proportion, direct eye-movement, suggest spatial enclosure, create patterning, permit transparency and establish continuity with landscape.&quot;

=== Portals ===
Portals or parts of the portals from about 140 stave churches have been preserved. There are roughly three portal types: the simple profile portal, the column portal and the beam portal.

The simple profile portal is a doorway framed by simple profiles or pilasters. These portals are mostly used on cord doors. About 20 such doors have been preserved.

The column portal is derived from stone architecture. It has full or half columns that carry a curved archivolt. The columns have bases and chapters. They are richly decorated and were used both on front doors and inside cross-sections. About 40 such portals are known.

The beam (or magnificent) portal consists of two portal planks and a top piece with continuous decoration. The upper part has two to five horizontal planks that are folded into each other with tongue and groove. This is supported by the standing wall planks that flank the doorway. 75 more or less complete portals of this type have been preserved. In some beam portals, the column motif is also incorporated together with the surface decorations, with or without archivolt.

Most of the preserved material comes from Sogn-Hardanger and from the mountain villages in eastern Norway. The main part of the portals is Romanesque and lacks Gothic features.

It is possible that the portals may have been painted, but this has been difficult to determine with certainty. The paint on the few that are painted today seems to be newer.

It is common to divide the portals according to style to Urnes style and Romanesque style.

=== Iconography ===
Most portals show dragons, &quot;lions&quot; and vines that do not refer to specific biblical or other Christian stories. One of the exceptions is the Christian motifs found on the west portal from the torn Hemsedal stave church, which shows St. Olav&#x27;s martyrdom and status as a Christlike saint.

A research problem has been the portal&#x27;s iconography. As for the Urnes style portals, the idea that it should have a pagan content is rejected. The large animal has been interpreted as a lion. The lion can represent Christ who fights with and wins over evil.

Common features of most portals are that they are monumental and that they have fighting dragons, which may be symbolic of magic to avert pain. Bugge believes that this may be a pagan iconography in Christian interpretation. In the Sogn-Valdres portals the lion is replaced by a vine, which also represents Christianity. in reference to Joh. 15.5: &quot;I am the vine, you are the branches.&quot; Hohler opposes this interpretation. She believes that the portals cannot have a religious content, but is a picture of the client&#x27;s or builder&#x27;s intention, a ruling motif. There are many portals in Europe that are pure ornaments. She refers to Bernhard of Clairvaux, who opposed the use of animals in the Christian context.


She therefore believes that animal motifs in Romanesque art have little religious significance, and the portals can be pure ruler symbols.

Hoftun believes that many of the so-called pagan portal motifs have a clear Christian message, believing that in principle the Norwegian stave church motifs do not differ from many of the motifs found in other Romanesque church art, such as on Romanesque church portals and stone baptismal fonts in Sweden and Denmark.

Other researchers believe that the portals are inspired by English art. The background may be manuscripts and stone sculpture. Some of these manuscripts are animal books with a Christian allegorical content, often referred to as bestiaries. The origin of these is the &quot;Physiologus&quot;, a collection of allegories about animals with Christian interpretations, which are said to have originated in Alexandria in the 2nd century. This basic text was in Greek, and throughout the Middle Ages the text was translated into a number of languages. These stories are also the background for all the bestiaries that are preserved in various libraries and collections. The sources of the &quot;Physiologus&quot; are Indian, Hebrew and Egyptian animal stories and various classical texts written by, among others, Aristotle and Pliny the Elder. No early Greek text has survived; the oldest preserved are in Latin, but these must be very close to the Greek original. Gradually, it became common to illustrate the texts, but there is a leap in development, and a number of texts with illustrations have been lost.

Lindkvist refers to the &quot;Physiologus&quot; as a background for animal depictions in portals on Gotland. These stone churches were often built after the stave churches in the same places had become too small. Unfortunately, most of the wooden churches have disappeared, so it is not possible to study the decor. But it is not unreasonable to assume that they have had the same decor as Norwegian stave churches, and that these motifs may then have been continued in the stone portals. Background and origin would then be approximately the same.

== Dating of churches ==
Stave churches can be dated in various ways: by historical records or inscriptions, by stylistic means using construction details or ornaments, or by dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating. Often historical records or inscriptions will point to a year when the church is known to have existed. Archaeological excavations can yield finds that provide relative dating for the structure, whereas absolute dating methods such as radiocarbon dating and dendrochronology can provide a more exact date. One drawback of dendrochronology is that it tends to overlook the possibility that the wood could have been reused from an older structure, or felled and left for many years before use.

An important problem in dating the churches is that the solid ground sills are the construction elements most likely to have the outer parts of the log still preserved. Yet they are the most susceptible to humidity, and as people back then reused building parts, the church may have been rebuilt several times. If so, a dendrochronological dating may be based upon a log from a later reconstruction.

Coin finds made under the church floors are also important for dating.

Results from studies with the photodendrome method published in 2019 have come with adjusted estimates for age of the timber used. The churches at Urnes, Kaupanger and Hopperstad were examined particularly thoroughly.
* Hoppestad Stave Church dendrodated to 1131–1132, previously assumed 1125–1250.
* Kaupanger Stave Church dated to 1137–1138, formerly adopted 1170–1200.
* Gol Stave Church 1204–05, previously assumed 1170–1309.
* Borgund Stave Church 1180–1181, previously assumed 1150–1250.
* Kvernes Stave Church, 1633, previously believed to be from the Middle Ages, is the only known stave church in Norway built after the Reformation.

== Stave Churches Program ==
The poor condition of the stave churches led the National Heritage Board to start the Stave Churches Program in 2001. The program was to create positive ripple effects in the form of greater local activity with traditional ways of using materials and resources.

The goals of the program were:
* to restore the stave churches so that they can be preserved for posterity,
* to preserve the decor and church art,
* to supplement the documentation of the stave churches as a basis for research and reconstruction of lost parts.

The results of the program with the details of what has been done at the individual churches was documented in a report in 2008.

== List of stave churches ==

Most stave churches are in Norway, but they can also be found in Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany. Stave churches are quite popular phenomenon and several have been built or rebuilt around the world. The two most copied are Borgund and Hedared, with some variations, and sometimes with adaptations to add elements from known stave churches from the area. In other places they are of a freer form and built for display.

<text>The title Marquess of Dorset has been created three times in the Peerage of England. It was first created in 1397 for John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, but he lost the title two years later. It was then created in 1442 for Edmund Beaufort, 1st Earl of Dorset, who was created Duke of Somerset in 1448. That creation was attainted in 1463.

It was created a third time in 1475 for Thomas Grey, 1st Earl of Huntingdon, who then resigned the earldom. The Marquess held the subsidiary title of &quot;Baron Ferrers of Groby&quot; (1299). The third marquess was created Duke of Suffolk in 1551, but he was attainted in 1554 and all the peerages were forfeited.

<doc id="641652" wikidata="Q4661882" url="?curid=641652" title="Masahide Ōta">
<text>was a Japanese academic and politician who served as the governor of Okinawa Prefecture from 1990 until 1998. After starting his career as a professor at the University of the Ryūkyūs, he wrote books in English and Japanese, mostly about the Battle of Okinawa and Japan–United States bilateral relations following World War II. After his retirement as professor he was elected as governor and was best known for his strong stand against occupation of prefectural lands by military bases of United States, going against the Japanese central government at the time.

== Early life and academic career ==
Ōta was born on 12 June 1925 on Kumejima Island, Okinawa and his family migrated during World War II. He became a student at the Okinawa Teacher&#x27;s College, and during the Battle of Okinawa he was drafted into the Japanese Army&#x27;s &quot;Iron and Blood Student Corps&quot;; he saw intense combat and many of his classmates died. After the end of the battle, he spent some months in hiding before emerging to surrender. He was educated at the Waseda University, Tokyo earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English and took a master&#x27;s degree in journalism from Syracuse University, New York.

From 1958, he was a professor at the University of the Ryūkyūs where he was chairman of Department of Social Science, and later dean of the College of Law and Letters. He published around 45 books in English and Japanese. His books were mostly based on Okinawa&#x27;s role in Japan–United States relations, post-war occupation by the military in prefectures and the Battle of Okinawa of 1945.

== Political career ==
In March 1990, Ōta retired from the university and in November of the same year was elected governor of Okinawa prefecture on a non-party platform defeating the 12-year sitting governor Junji Nishime. His campaign was based on removing U.S. bases from the island to bring back peace. He also opposed the then proposed bill to provide Japanese troops for United Nations&#x27; peacekeeping missions. He had a distinguished record as a governor, outspokenly arguing for the interests of the Okinawan people against both the United States military establishment in the Ryukyu Islands and the Japanese central government. After being elected as governor. Ōta failed to make headway on his campaign promises. His requests to discuss the issue of U.S. military occupation in the prefecture with the U.S. authorities were dismissed, stating that all such discussions would happen with the Japanese central government. In 1991, he reluctantly signed lease agreements that enabled military bases use of private lands. This resulted in disapproval from anti-war masses that had earlier supported Ōta in elections.

In February 1995, reports from Washington prepared by Harvard professor Joseph Nye indicated their plans of deploying over 100,000 soldiers in Japan and South Korea. On 4 September 1995, a 12-year-old local girl was raped by three U.S. servicemen, and protests were held against the military&#x27;s establishments in the area. Ōta considered these two events as hindrance to peace in the prefecture. From 1996 to 1998, he actively worked to establish cordial relations with U.S. On 8 September 1996, he organized a plebiscite in his prefecture which brought results that about 60 percent of citizens who supported reduction of military bases. On 10 July 1996, he appealed to the Supreme Court of Japan to relocate various military bases to mainland. As governor, he rejected permissions of U.S. military asking to extend lease for use of private land. This led to conflict between local and central government. The central government amended laws which gave it the power to endorse such documents.

Due to Ōta&#x27;s efforts, mass campaigns such as the Okinawa Women Act against Military Violence, which arranged a rally at Ginowan&#x27;s Seaside Front on 21 October 1995, had nearly 85,000 people participating. The Japanese and American governments together set up the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) to deal with the problems. In 1996, the U.S. and Japanese government agreed to closure or relocation of various military bases, including the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, the most prominent based in the centre of Ginowan city&#x27;s residential area. The move has however not happened as in June 2017 due to various issues. In 1995, he inaugurated the monument Cornerstone of Peace which commemorated more than 200,000 people who died in the Okinawa Battle, including U.S. soldiers.

In 1998, Keizō Obuchi replaced Ryutaro Hashimoto as the Prime Minister of Japan. Obuchi supported the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidate Keiichi Inamine for the governor&#x27;s post in opposition to Ōta. By then the central and American government considered Ōta as &quot;one of the biggest thornes&quot; on both sides in the Japan–America relationship. Inamine, the eldest son of oil company Ryukyu Sekiyo&#x27;s owner Ichiro Inamine, led a successful campaign not disregarding Ōta&#x27;s work directly but calling it unrealistic. The central government cut down subsidies to Okinawa in 1998 leading to 9.2 percent of unemployment in August 1998. Inamine promised to revive the employment condition with his contacts in the central government and on the day of election LDP&#x27;s campaign banners had slogan &quot;9.2 percent&quot; whereas Ōta campaigned using &quot;Okinawans, Don&#x27;t Sell Your Souls.&quot; Ōta lost with 46.9 percent votes whereas 52.1 percent went to Inamine.

In 2001, on the ticket of Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), Ōta won a seat in the House of Councillors (Upper House). He took retirement from active politics in 2007.

==Later life and death==
In 2013, he founded the Okinawa International Peace Research Institute at Naha. In April 2017, Ōta was reported to have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Ōta died on his 92nd birthday on 12 June 2017 at a hospital in Naha after suffering from pneumonia and respiratory failure. Upon his death, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga called him &quot;an individual who energetically tackled Okinawa&#x27;s base issues and (economic) development at a turbulent time.&quot;

<text>Duke of Dorset was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1720 for the politician Lionel Sackville, 7th Earl of Dorset.

==History==
The Sackville family descended from Sir Richard Sackville. His only surviving son, Thomas Sackville, was a statesman, poet and dramatist and notably served as Lord High Treasurer between 1599 and 1608. He was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Buckhurst, of Buckhurst in the County of Sussex, in 1567, and was made Earl of Dorset in 1604, also in the Peerage of England. The titles descended in the direct line until the death of his grandson, the third Earl, in 1624. The late Earl was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He was Lord Chamberlain between 1642 and 1649. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Earl. He married Lady Frances, daughter of Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the sixth Earl. He succeeded to the Cranfield estates on the death of his maternal uncle Lionel Cranfield, 3rd Earl of Middlesex. In 1675, two years before he succeeded his father, he was raised to the Peerage of England in his own right as Baron Cranfield, of Cranfield in the County of Dorset, and Earl of Middlesex. He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned seventh Earl, who was made Duke of Dorset in 1720.

The Duke of Dorset was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Duke. The latter was succeeded by his nephew, the third Duke. He was the son of Lord John Sackville, second son of the first Duke. He was the British Ambassador to France between 1783 and 1789 in the lead-up to the French Revolution. He was succeeded by his only son, the fourth Duke. He died unmarried at an early age in 1815 after a fall from his horse. The titles passed to his cousin, Charles Sackville-Germain, 2nd Viscount Sackville, who became the fifth Duke. He was the son of George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville, the third son of the first Duke (see Viscount Sackville). All titles became extinct on his death in 1843, though the baronies were later revived.

The family seat was Knole House, Kent, and the Sackvilles previously owned Buckhurst Park and Croxall Hall. On the death of the fourth Duke in 1815, Knole House was inherited by the late Duke&#x27;s sister, Lady Elizabeth Sackville. She was the wife of George West, 5th Earl De La Warr, who assumed the additional surname of Sackville.

In 1865, the barony of Buckhurst held by the Earls and Dukes of Dorset was revived in Elizabeth&#x27;s favour. In 1876 the Sackville title was also revived when her younger son Mortimer Sackville-West was created Baron Sackville.

== Family tree ==
==In fiction==

The plot line of David Gurr&#x27;s thriller &quot;A Woman Called Scylla&quot; assumes fictionally that the Dukedom of Dorset did not become extinct but survived into the 20th century. In 1977, the book&#x27;s protagonist is the granddaughter of George Frederick Henry, the 10th Duke of Dorset. He is mentioned as being born in 1886, having been severely wounded at the Battle of Ypres in World War I and later devoting himself to gardening. Other members of the Duke&#x27;s family also have a big share in the plot, particularly his daughter Mary, an SOE agent in World War II captured and tortured to death by the Nazis. Another fictional 20th-century Duke of Dorset is one of the title character&#x27;s suitors in &quot;Zuleika Dobson.&quot;

<text>A human interface device (HID) is a type of computer device usually used by humans that takes input from or provides output to humans. 

The term &quot;HID&quot; most commonly refers to the USB HID specification. The term was coined by Mike Van Flandern of Microsoft when he proposed that the USB committee create a Human Input Device class working group. The working group was renamed as the Human Interface Device class at the suggestion of Tom Schmidt of DEC because the proposed standard supported bi-directional communication.

== HID standard ==
The HID standard was adopted primarily to enable innovation in PC input devices and to simplify the process of installing such devices. Prior to the introduction of the HID concept, devices usually conformed to strictly defined protocols for mouse, keyboards and joysticks; for example, the standard mouse protocol at the time supported relative X- and Y-axis data and binary input for up to two buttons, with no legacy support. All hardware innovations necessitated either overloading the use of data in an existing protocol or the creation of custom device drivers and the evangelization of a new protocol to developers. By contrast, all HID-defined devices deliver self-describing packages that may contain any number of data types and formats. A single HID driver on a computer parses data and enables dynamic association of data I/O with application functionality, which has enabled rapid innovation and development, and prolific diversification of new human-interface devices.

A working committee with representatives from several prominent companies developed the HID standard. The list of participants appears in the &quot;Device Class Definition for Human Interface Devices (HID)&quot;
document. The concept of a self-describing extensible protocol initially came from Mike Van Flandern and Manolito Adan while working on a project named &quot;Raptor&quot; at Microsoft, and independently from Steve McGowan, who worked on a &quot;SIM&quot; project that defined a device protocol for the VFX1 VR Headset and its peripherals based on ACCESS.bus while at Forte Technologies. SIM was also self-describing and extensible, however it was more focused on SIMulation devices used for VR and motion capture. After comparing notes at a Consumer Game Developer Conference, Steve and Mike agreed to collaborate on a new standard for the emerging Universal Serial Bus (USB).

Prior to HID (c.1995), proprietary drivers needed to be installed for almost every device attached to a PC. This meant that device vendors needed to track OS releases, and regularly offer updated drivers for their devices, and to develop drivers for each OS that they wanted to support. Also, at the time any novel devices, e.g., Joysticks designed for flight simulators with extra buttons or D-pads, required software support not only by the driver, but by each game that supported them to enable new controls. This meant that the device developers had the additional responsibility of enabling each game that they wanted to support. The ability for a HID device to describe itself via a Report Descriptor, decoupled hardware device developers from game developers. The Report Descriptor concept also meant that OS vendors could write a HID driver (Parser) that could accommodate almost any HID device a vendor could dream up, without the vendor needing to write or maintain a driver for every OS that they wanted to support.

So the HID class decoupled device vendors from game and OS vendors, enabling device vendors to innovate faster, and reducing their development costs (e.g., no drivers or game developer support). The HID Usage Table document defines thousands of controls that can be presented by HID devices. Game vendors can query the OS&#x27;s HID parser to identify the set of controls that are presented by a device, then map those controls to features in their game. Since its original release, the HID Usage Table (HUT) document has had hundreds of new uses added to it.

The HID protocol has its limitations, but all modern mainstream operating systems will recognize standard USB HID devices, such as keyboards and mice, without needing a specialized driver. However its versatility has been demonstrated by the fact that it has not been updated in over 22 years, and it is still supported by every PC, tablet and cell phone in production today. USB, hence HID, devices can be hot-plugged, so when installed, a message saying that &quot;A &#x27;HID-compliant device&#x27; has been recognized&quot; generally appears on screen. In comparison, this message did not usually appear for devices connected via the PS/2 6-pin DIN connectors which preceded USB. PS/2 did not typically support plug-and-play, which means that connecting a PS/2 keyboard or mouse with the computer powered on does not always work and may pose a hazard to the computer&#x27;s motherboard. Likewise, the PS/2 standard did not support the HID protocol. The USB human interface device class describes a USB HID.

The HID protocol (Report Descriptor and Report mechanism) has been implemented on many buses other than USB, including Bluetooth and I2C.

There are also a number of extensions to HID defined in &quot;HID Integrated Usage Table Documents&quot;, including uninterruptible power supplies, video monitor controls, point of sale devices, arcade and gaming (slot machines) devices.

=== Report Descriptor ===
The Report Descriptor exposes the messages that are generated or accepted by a HID device. Each message is referred to as a &#x27;Report&#x27;. Reports can define bits/controls in a device that can be read or written, or generated periodically to keep a host updated on the current status of the device. For instance, a mouse typically generates a Report 200 times a second to inform the host of any movement or button presses. Report Descriptors are &#x27;bit orientated&#x27;, meaning that controls can present between 1 and 32 bits of information. Each control defined in a Report Descriptor has an ID and defines its size and position in its Report. A Report Descriptor can define many Reports, each reporting a different set, or combination of information.

For example, a basic mouse defines a 3 byte Report where the least significant (0) bit of the report is the left button, the next (1) bit is the middle button, and the third (2) bit is the right button. To allow the mouse 8-bit X and Y position coordinates to conveniently land on byte boundaries, a 5-bit &#x27;pad&#x27; is defined. Then the X coordinate is defined as an 8-bit relative value (i.e., number of &#x27;mickeys&#x27; since the previous report) that resides in bit positions 8 through 15, and the Y coordinate is defined as an 8-bit relative value that resides in bit positions 16 through 24, resulting in a data packet that is presented to the host.

A Report Descriptor is extremely versatile, allowing a device to specify the resolution, range, and many other characteristics of each control that it presents. Being designed at a time when a mouse or keyboard controller was lucky to have 1KB of ROM for all its code and data, the Report Descriptor syntax has many features that allow its size to be minimized e.g., selected control parameters can persist across control multiple definitions, only needing to be redeclared if their value changes. The reports generated by a basic mouse can be described in 50 bytes, and a 104 keyboard in 65 bytes.

=== Physical Descriptor ===
A little known or understood feature of HID is the Physical Descriptor. The Physical Descriptor is used to define the parts of the human body that interact with the individual controls defined in the Report Descriptor. When controlling a game, the index finger and thumb are usually used to invoke repetitive actions. Because these fingers are considered to have the fastest &#x27;twitch&#x27; response, they are typically used for pulling the trigger of a gun, or activating an often used game function. The Physical Descriptor allows a device vendor identify that which fingers rests on each control and prioritize the set of controls that can be reached by an individual finger. This feature enables a game vendor to intelligently present the best default button mapping, even for a device that didn&#x27;t exist when the game was developed. The Physical Descriptor also enables full body motion capture information to be presented by a HID device, i.e., the angle, orientation, relative or absolute position of any joint in the human body. And through the Report Descriptor, the motion capture data can be presented at whatever resolution that the device can support.

=== Components of the HID protocol ===
In the HID protocol, there are 2 entities: the &quot;host&quot; and the &quot;device&quot;. The device is the entity that directly interacts with a human, such as a keyboard or mouse. The host communicates with the device and receives input data from the device on actions performed by the human. Output data flows from the host to the device and then to the human. The most common example of a host is a PC but some cell phones and PDAs also can be hosts.

The HID protocol makes implementation of devices very simple. Devices define their data packets and then present a &quot;HID descriptor&quot; to the host. The HID descriptor is a hard coded array of bytes that describes the device&#x27;s data packets. This includes: how many packets the device supports, the size of the packets, and the purpose of each byte and bit in the packet. For example, a keyboard with a calculator program button can tell the host that the button&#x27;s pressed/released state is stored as the 2nd bit in the 6th byte in data packet number 4 (note: these locations are only illustrative and are device-specific). The device typically stores the HID descriptor in ROM and does not need to intrinsically understand or parse the HID descriptor. Some mouse and keyboard hardware in the market today is implemented using only an 8-bit CPU.

The host is expected to be a more complex entity than the device. The host needs to retrieve the HID descriptor from the device and parse it before it can fully communicate with the device. Parsing the HID descriptor can be complicated. Multiple operating systems were known to have shipped bugs in the device drivers responsible for parsing the HID descriptors years after the device drivers were originally released to the public. However, this complexity is the reason why rapid innovation with HID devices is possible.

The above mechanism describes what is known as HID &quot;report protocol&quot;. Because it was understood that not all hosts would be capable of parsing HID descriptors, HID also defines &quot;boot protocol&quot;. In boot protocol, only specific devices are supported with only specific features because fixed data packet formats are used. The HID descriptor is not used in this mode so innovation is limited. However, the benefit is that minimal functionality is still possible on hosts that otherwise would be unable to support HID. The only devices supported in boot protocol are
* Keyboard – Any of the first 256 key codes (&quot;Usages&quot;) defined in the HID Usage Tables, Usage Page 7 can be reported by a keyboard using the boot protocol, but most systems only handle a subset of these keys. Most systems support all 104 keys on the IBM AT-101 layout, plus the three extra keys designed for Microsoft Windows 95 (the left and right Windows key, and the Menu key). Many systems also support additional keys on basic western European 105-, Korean 106-, Brazilian ABNT 107- and Japanese DOS/V 109-key layouts. Buttons, knobs and keys that are not reported on Usage Page 7 are not available. For example, a particular US keyboard&#x27;s QWERTY keys will function but the Calculator and Logoff keys will not because they are defined on Usage Page 12 and cannot be reported in boot protocol.
* Mouse – Only the X-axis, Y-axis, and the first 3 buttons will be available. Any additional features on the mouse will not function.
One common usage of boot mode is during the first moments of a computer&#x27;s boot up sequence. Directly configuring a computer&#x27;s BIOS is often done using only boot mode.
Sometimes a message will appear informing the user that the device has installed the correct driver and is now usable.

=== Definition of a device ===
According to the HID specification, a device is described, during the report mode, as a set of controls or group of controls.
Controls are matched by a field containing the data, and another containing a usage tag.
Each usage tag is described in the spec as the constructor suggested use of the data described in the report mode.

The is a Windows app that can be used to generate all the descriptors associated with a HID device (see link below). It performs syntax checking, and can generate C, C Header and binary files for the HID descriptors. Its text-based Usage Table definion files can also be easily extended to define proprietary Usages (control types) or Usage Tables (the set of Usages associated with a device or feature).

== Other protocols using HID ==
Since HID&#x27;s original definition over USB, HID is now also used in other computer communication buses. This enables HID devices that traditionally were only found on USB to also be used on alternative buses. This is done since existing support for USB HID devices can typically be adapted much faster than having to invent an entirely new protocol to support mouse, touchpad, keyboards, and the like. Known buses that use HID are:
* Bluetooth HID – Used for mouse and keyboards that are connected via Bluetooth
* Serial HID – Used in Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Media Center PC remote control receivers.
* Zigbee input device – Zigbee (RF4CE) supports HID devices through the Zigbee input device profile.
* HID over I²C – Used for embedded devices in Microsoft Windows 8
* HID over SPI – Developed by Microsoft for faster, lower latency fixed-device communications
* HOGP (HID over GATT) – Used for HID devices connected using Bluetooth Low Energy technology

<text>A CubeSat is a class of small satellite with a form factor of cubes. CubeSats have a mass of no more than per unit, and often use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components for their electronics and structure. CubeSats are deployed into orbit from the International Space Station, or launched as secondary payloads on a launch vehicle. , more than 2,300 CubeSats have been launched.

In 1999, California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) professor Jordi Puig-Suari and Bob Twiggs, a professor at Stanford University Space Systems Development Laboratory, developed the CubeSat specifications to promote and develop the skills necessary for the design, manufacture, and testing of small satellites intended for low Earth orbit (LEO) that perform scientific research and explore new space technologies. Academia accounted for the majority of CubeSat launches until 2013, when more than half of launches were for non-academic purposes, and by 2014 most newly deployed CubeSats were for commercial or amateur projects.

Functions typically involve experiments that can be miniaturized or serve purposes such as Earth observation or amateur radio. CubeSats are employed to demonstrate spacecraft technologies intended for small satellites or that present questionable feasibility and are unlikely to justify the cost of a larger satellite. Scientific experiments with unproven underlying theory may also find themselves aboard CubeSats because their low cost can justify higher risks. Biological research payloads have been flown on several missions, with more planned. Several missions to the Moon and beyond are planning to use CubeSats. The first CubeSats in deep space were flown in the MarCO mission, where two CubeSats were launched towards Mars in May 2018 alongside the successful &quot;InSight&quot; mission.

Some CubeSats have become countries&#x27; first-ever satellites, launched either by universities, state-owned, or private companies. The searchable &quot;Nanosatellite and CubeSat Database&quot; lists over 4,000 CubeSats that have been or are planned to be launched since 1998.

== History==
Professors Jordi Puig-Suari of California Polytechnic State University and Bob Twiggs of Stanford University proposed the CubeSat reference design in 1999 with the aim of enabling graduate students to design, build, test and operate in space a spacecraft with capabilities similar to that of the first spacecraft, Sputnik. The CubeSat, as initially proposed, did not set out to become a standard; rather, it became a standard over time by a process of emergence. The first CubeSats launched in June 2003 on a Russian Eurockot, and approximately 75 CubeSats had entered orbit by 2012.

The need for such a small-factor satellite became apparent in 1998 as a result of work done at Stanford University&#x27;s Space System Development Laboratory. At SSDL, students had been working on the OPAL (Orbiting Picosatellite Automatic Launcher) microsatellite since 1995. OPAL&#x27;s mission to deploy daughter-ship &quot;picosatellites&quot; had resulted in the development of a launcher system that was &quot;hopelessly complicated&quot; and could only be made to work &quot;most of the time&quot;. With the project&#x27;s delays mounting, Twiggs sought DARPA funding that resulted in the redesign of the launching mechanism into a simple pusher-plate concept with the satellites held in place by a spring-loaded door.

Desiring to shorten the development cycle experienced on OPAL and inspired by the picosatellites OPAL carried, Twiggs set out to find &quot;how much could you reduce the size and still have a practical satellite&quot;. The picosatellites on OPAL were , a size that was not conducive to covering all sides of the spacecraft with solar cells. Inspired by a cubic plastic box used to display Beanie Babies in stores, Twiggs first settled on the larger ten-centimeter cube as a guideline for the new CubeSat concept. A model of a launcher was developed for the new satellite using the same pusher-plate concept that had been used in the modified OPAL launcher. Twiggs presented the idea to Puig-Suari in the summer of 1999 and then at the Japan–U.S. Science, Technology and Space Applications Program (JUSTSAP) conference in November 1999.

The term &quot;CubeSat&quot; was coined to denote nanosatellites that adhere to the standards described in the CubeSat design specification. Cal Poly published the standard in an effort led by aerospace engineering professor Jordi Puig-Suari. Bob Twiggs, of the Department of Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics at Stanford University, and currently a member of the space science faculty at Morehead State University in Kentucky, has contributed to the CubeSat community. His efforts have focused on CubeSats from educational institutions. The specification does not apply to other cube-like nanosatellites such as the NASA &quot;MEPSI&quot; nanosatellite, which is slightly larger than a CubeSat. GeneSat-1 was NASA&#x27;s first fully automated, self-contained biological spaceflight experiment on a satellite of its size. It was also the first U.S.-launched CubeSat. This work, led by John Hines at NASA Ames Research, became the catalyst for the entire NASA CubeSat program.

In 2017, this standardization effort led to the publication of ISO 17770:2017 by the International Organization for Standardization. This standard defines specifications for CubeSats including their physical, mechanical, electrical, and operational requirements. It also provides a specification for the interface between the CubeSat and its launch vehicle, which lists the capabilities required to survive the environmental conditions during and after launch and describes the standard deployment interface used to release the satellites. The development of standards shared by a large number of spacecraft contributes to a significant reduction in the development time and cost of CubeSat missions.

==Design==

The CubeSat specification accomplishes several high-level goals. The main reason for miniaturizing satellites is to reduce the cost of deployment: they are often suitable for launch in multiples, using the excess capacity of larger launch vehicles. The CubeSat design specifically minimizes risk to the rest of the launch vehicle and payloads. Encapsulation of the launcher–payload interface takes away the amount of work that would previously be required for mating a piggyback satellite with its launcher. Unification among payloads and launchers enables quick exchanges of payloads and utilization of launch opportunities on short notice.

Standard CubeSats are made up of units designed to provide or of useful volume, with each unit weighing no more than . The smallest standard size is 1U, consisting of a single unit, while the most common form factor was the 3U, which comprised over 40% of all nanosatellites launched to date. Larger form factors, such as the 6U and 12U, are composed of 3Us stacked side by side. In 2014, two 6U Perseus-M CubeSats were launched for maritime surveillance, the largest yet at the time. The Mars Cube One (MarCO) mission in 2018 launched two 6U cubesats towards Mars.

Smaller, non-standard form factors also exist; The Aerospace Corporation has constructed and launched two smaller form CubeSats of 0.5U for radiation measurement and technological demonstration, while Swarm Technologies has built and deployed a constellation of over one hundred 0.25U CubeSats for IoT communication services. 
Since nearly all CubeSats are (regardless of length) they can all be launched and deployed using a common deployment system called a Poly-PicoSatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD), developed and built by Cal Poly.

No electronics form factors or communications protocols are specified or required by the CubeSat Design Specification, but COTS hardware has consistently used certain features which many treat as standards in CubeSat electronics. Most COTS and custom designed electronics fit the form of PC/104, which was not designed for CubeSats but presents a profile that allows most of the spacecraft&#x27;s volume to be occupied. Technically, the PCI-104 form is the variant of PC/104 used and the actual pinout used does not reflect the pinout specified in the PCI-104 standard. Stackthrough connectors on the boards allow for simple assembly and electrical interfacing and most manufacturers of CubeSat electronics hardware hold to the same signal arrangement, but some products do not, so care must be taken to ensure consistent signal and power arrangements to prevent damage.

Care must be taken in electronics selection to ensure the devices can tolerate the radiation present. For very low Earth orbits (LEO) in which atmospheric reentry would occur in just days or weeks, radiation can largely be ignored and standard consumer grade electronics may be used. Consumer electronic devices can survive LEO radiation for that time as the chance of a single event upset (SEU) is very low. Spacecraft in a sustained low Earth orbit lasting months or years are at risk and only fly hardware designed for and tested in irradiated environments. Missions beyond low Earth orbit or which would remain in low Earth orbit for many years must use radiation-hardened devices. Further considerations are made for operation in high vacuum due to the effects of sublimation, outgassing, and metal whiskers, which may result in mission failure.

===Structure===

The number of joined units classifies the size of CubeSats and according to the CubeSat Design Specification are scalable along only one axis to fit the forms of 0.5U, 1U, 1.5U, 2U, or 3U. All the standard sizes of CubeSat have been built and launched, and represent the form factors for nearly all launched CubeSats as of 2015. Materials used in the structure must feature the same coefficient of thermal expansion as the deployer to prevent jamming. Specifically, allowed materials are four aluminum alloys: 7075, 6061, 5005, and 5052. Aluminum used on the structure which contacts the P-POD must be anodized to prevent cold welding, and other materials may be used for the structure if a waiver is obtained. Beyond cold welding, further consideration is put into material selection as not all materials can be used in vacuums. Structures often feature soft dampers at each end, typically made of rubber, to lessen the effects of impacting other CubeSats in the P-POD.

Protrusions beyond the maximum dimensions are allowed by the standard specification, to a maximum of beyond each side. Any protrusions may not interfere with the deployment rails and are typically occupied by antennas and solar panels. In Revision 13 of the CubeSat Design Specification an extra available volume was defined for use on 3U projects. The additional volume is made possible by space typically wasted in the P-POD Mk III&#x27;s spring mechanism. 3U CubeSats which utilize the space are designated 3U+ and may place components in a cylindrical volume centered on one end of the CubeSat. The cylindrical space has a maximum diameter of and a height no greater than while not allowing for any increase in mass beyond the 3U&#x27;s maximum of . Propulsion systems and antennas are the most common components that might require the additional volume, though the payload sometimes extends into this volume. Deviations from the dimension and mass requirements can be waived following application and negotiation with the launch service provider.

CubeSat structures do not have all the same strength concerns as larger satellites do, as they have the added benefit of the deployer supporting them structurally during launch. Still, some CubeSats will undergo vibration analysis or structural analysis to ensure that components unsupported by the P-POD remain structurally sound throughout the launch. Despite rarely undergoing the analysis that larger satellites do, CubeSats rarely fail due to mechanical issues.

===Computing===
Like larger satellites, CubeSats often feature multiple computers handling different tasks in parallel including the attitude control (orientation), power management, payload operation, and primary control tasks. COTS attitude-control systems typically include their own computer, as do the power management systems. Payloads must be able to interface with the primary computer to be useful, which sometimes requires the use of another small computer. This may be due to limitations in the primary computer&#x27;s ability to control the payload with limited communication protocols, to prevent overloading the primary computer with raw data handling, or to ensure payload&#x27;s operation continues uninterrupted by the spacecraft&#x27;s other computing needs such as communication. Still, the primary computer may be used for payload related tasks, which might include image processing, data analysis, and data compression. Tasks which the primary computer typically handles include the delegation of tasks to the other computers, attitude control, calculations for orbital maneuvers, scheduling, and activation of active thermal control components. CubeSat computers are highly susceptible to radiation and builders will take special steps to ensure proper operation in the high radiation of space, such as the use of ECC RAM. Some satellites may incorporate redundancy by implementing multiple primary computers; this could be done on valuable missions to lessen the risk of mission failure. Consumer smartphones have been used for computing in some CubeSats, such as NASA&#x27;s PhoneSats.

===Attitude control===

Attitude control (orientation) for CubeSats relies on miniaturizing technology without significant performance degradation. Tumbling typically occurs as soon as a CubeSat is deployed, due to asymmetric deployment forces and bumping with other CubeSats. Some CubeSats operate normally while tumbling, but those that require pointing in a certain direction or cannot operate safely while spinning, must be detumbled. Systems that perform attitude determination and control include reaction wheels, magnetorquers, thrusters, star trackers, Sun sensors, Earth sensors, angular rate sensors, and GPS receivers and antennas. Combinations of these systems are typically seen in order to take each method&#x27;s advantages and mitigate their shortcomings. Reaction wheels are commonly utilized for their ability to impart relatively large moments for any given energy input, but reaction wheel&#x27;s utility is limited due to saturation, the point at which a wheel cannot spin faster. Examples of CubeSat reaction wheels include the Maryland Aerospace MAI-101 and the Sinclair Interplanetary RW-0.03-4. Reaction wheels can be desaturated with the use of thrusters or magnetorquers. Thrusters can provide large moments by imparting a couple on the spacecraft but inefficiencies in small propulsion systems cause thrusters to run out of fuel rapidly. Commonly found on nearly all CubeSats are magnetorquers which run electricity through a coil to take advantage of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field to produce a turning moment. Attitude-control modules and solar panels typically feature built-in magnetorquers. For CubeSats that only need to detumble, no attitude determination method beyond an angular rate sensor or electronic gyroscope is necessary.

Pointing in a specific direction is necessary for Earth observation, orbital maneuvers, maximizing solar power, and some scientific instruments. Directional pointing accuracy can be achieved by sensing Earth and its horizon, the Sun, or specific stars. Sinclair Interplanetary&#x27;s SS-411 Sun sensor and ST-16 star tracker both have applications for CubeSats and have flight heritage. Pumpkin&#x27;s Colony I Bus uses an aerodynamic wing for passive attitude stabilization. Determination of a CubeSat&#x27;s location can be done through the use of on-board GPS, which is relatively expensive for a CubeSat, or by relaying radar tracking data to the craft from Earth-based tracking systems.

=== Propulsion ===
CubeSat propulsion has made rapid advancements in: cold gas, chemical propulsion, electric propulsion, and solar sails. The biggest challenge with CubeSat propulsion is preventing risk to the launch vehicle and its primary payload while still providing significant capability. Components and methods that are commonly used in larger satellites are disallowed or limited, and the CubeSat Design Specification (CDS) requires a waiver for pressurization above , over 100 Wh of stored chemical energy, and hazardous materials. Those restrictions pose great challenges for CubeSat propulsion systems, as typical space propulsion systems utilize combinations of high pressures, high energy densities, and hazardous materials. Beyond the restrictions set forth by launch service providers, various technical challenges further reduce the usefulness of CubeSat propulsion. Gimbaled thrust cannot be used in small engines due to the complexity of gimbaling mechanisms, thrust vectoring must instead be achieved by thrusting asymmetrically in multiple-nozzle propulsion systems or by changing the center of mass relative to the CubeSat&#x27;s geometry with actuated components. Small motors may also not have room for throttling methods that allow smaller than fully on thrust, which is important for precision maneuvers such as rendezvous. CubeSats which require longer life also benefit from propulsion systems; when used for orbit keeping a propulsion system can slow orbital decay.

==== Cold gas thrusters ====
A cold gas thruster typically stores inert gas, such as nitrogen, in a pressurized tank and releases the gas through a nozzle to produce thrust. Operation is handled by just a single valve in most systems, which makes cold gas the simplest useful propulsion technology. Cold gas propulsion systems can be very safe since the gases used do not have to be volatile or corrosive, though some systems opt to feature dangerous gases such as sulfur dioxide. This ability to use inert gases is highly advantageous to CubeSats as they are usually restricted from hazardous materials. Only low performance can be achieved with them, preventing high impulse maneuvers even in low mass CubeSats. Due to this low performance, their use in CubeSats for main propulsion is limited and designers choose higher efficiency systems with only minor increases in complexity. Cold gas systems more often see use in CubeSat attitude control.

==== Chemical propulsion ====
Chemical propulsion systems use a chemical reaction to produce a high-pressure, high-temperature gas that accelerates out of a nozzle. Chemical propellant can be liquid, solid or a hybrid of both. Liquid propellants can be a monopropellant passed through a catalyst, or bipropellant which combusts an oxidizer and a fuel. The benefits of monopropellants are relatively low-complexity/high-thrust output, low power requirements, and high reliability. Monopropellant motors tend to have high thrust while remaining comparatively simple, which also provides high reliability. These motors are practical for CubeSats due to their low power requirements and because their simplicity allows them to be very small. Small hydrazine fueled motors have been developed, but may require a waiver to fly due to restrictions on hazardous chemicals set forth in the CubeSat Design Specification. Safer chemical propellants which would not require hazardous chemical waivers are being developed, such as AF-M315 (hydroxylammonium nitrate) for which motors are being or have been designed. A &quot;Water Electrolysis Thruster&quot; is technically a chemical propulsion system, as it burns hydrogen and oxygen which it generates by on-orbit electrolysis of water.

==== Electric propulsion ====

CubeSat electric propulsion typically uses electric energy to accelerate propellant to high speed, which results in high specific impulse. Many of these technologies can be made small enough for use in nanosatellites, and several methods are in development. Types of electric propulsion currently being designed for use in CubeSats include Hall-effect thrusters, ion thrusters, pulsed plasma thrusters, electrospray thrusters, and resistojets. Several notable CubeSat missions plan to use electric propulsion, such as NASA&#x27;s Lunar IceCube. The high efficiency associated with electric propulsion could allow CubeSats to propel themselves to Mars. Electric propulsion systems are disadvantaged in their use of power, which requires the CubeSat to have larger solar cells, more complicated power distribution, and often larger batteries. Furthermore, many electric propulsion methods may still require pressurized tanks to store propellant, which is restricted by the CubeSat Design Specification.

The ESTCube-1 used an electric solar-wind sail, which relies on an electromagnetic field to act as a sail instead of a solid material. This technology used an electric field to deflect protons from solar wind to produce thrust. It is similar to an electrodynamic tether in that the craft only needs to supply electricity to operate.

==== Solar sail ====
Solar sails (also called light sails or photon sails) are a form of spacecraft propulsion using the radiation pressure (also called solar pressure) from stars to push large ultra-thin mirrors to high speeds, requiring no propellant. Force from a solar sail scales with the sail&#x27;s area, this makes sails well suited for use in CubeSats as their small mass results in the greater acceleration for a given solar sail&#x27;s area. However, solar sails still need to be quite large compared to the satellite, which means useful solar sails must be deployed, adding mechanical complexity and a potential source of failure. This propulsion method is the only one not plagued with restrictions set by the CubeSat Design Specification, as it does not require high pressures, hazardous materials, or significant chemical energy. A small number of CubeSats have employed a solar sail as its main propulsion and stability in deep space, including the 3U NanoSail-D2 launched in 2010, and the LightSail-1 in May 2015.

LightSail-2 successfully deployed on a Falcon Heavy rocket in 2019, while one CubeSat that was planned to launch on the Space Launch System&#x27;s first flight (Artemis 1) in November 2022 was set to use a solar sail: the Near-Earth Asteroid Scout (NEA Scout). The CubeSat was declared lost when communications were not established within 2 days.

===Power===

CubeSats use solar cells to convert solar light to electricity that is then stored in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that provide power during eclipse as well as during peak load times. These satellites have a limited surface area on their external walls for solar cells assembly, and has to be effectively shared with other parts, such as antennas, optical sensors, camera lens, propulsion systems, and access ports. Lithium-ion batteries feature high energy-to-mass ratios, making them well suited to use on mass-restricted spacecraft. Battery charging and discharging is typically handled by a dedicated electrical power system (EPS). Batteries sometimes feature heaters to prevent the battery from reaching dangerously low temperatures which might cause battery and mission failure.

The rate at which the batteries decay depends on the number of cycles for which they are charged and discharged, as well as the depth of each discharge: the greater the average depth of discharge, the faster a battery degrades. For LEO missions, the number of cycles of discharge can be expected to be on the order of several hundred.

Due to size and weight constraints, common CubeSats flying in LEO with body-mounted solar panels have generated less than 10 W. Missions with higher power requirements can make use of attitude control to ensure the solar panels remain in their most effective orientation toward the Sun, and further power needs can be met through the addition and orientation of deployable solar arrays, which can be unfolded to a substantially larger area on-orbit. Recent innovations include additional spring-loaded solar arrays that deploy as soon as the satellite is released, as well as arrays that feature thermal knife mechanisms that would deploy the panels when commanded. CubeSats may not be powered between launch and deployment, and must feature a remove-before-flight pin which cuts all power to prevent operation during loading into the P-POD. Additionally, a deployment switch is actuated while the craft is loaded into a P-POD, cutting power to the spacecraft and is deactivated after exiting the P-POD.

===Telecommunications===

The low cost of CubeSats has enabled unprecedented access to space for smaller institutions and organizations but, for most CubeSat forms, the range and available power is limited to about 2 W for its communications antennae.

Because of tumbling and low power range, radio-communications are a challenge. Many CubeSats use an omnidirectional monopole or dipole antenna built with commercial measuring tape. For more demanding needs, some companies offer high-gain antennae for CubeSats, but their deployment and pointing systems are significantly more complex. For example, MIT and JPL are developing an inflatable dish antenna based on a mylar skin inflated with a sublimating powder, claiming a 7× boost in range—potentially able to reach the Moon—but questions linger concerning survivability after micrometeor impacts. JPL has successfully developed X-band and Ka-band high-gain antennas for MarCO and Radar in a CubeSat (RaInCube) missions.

==== Antennas ====
Traditionally, Low Earth Orbit Cubesats use antennas for communication purpose at UHF and S-band. To venture farther in the solar system, larger antennas compatible with the Deep Space Network (X-band and Ka-band) are required. JPL&#x27;s engineers developed several deployable high-gain antennas compatible with 6U-class CubeSats for MarCO and Near-Earth Asteroid Scout. JPL&#x27;s engineers have also developed a mesh reflector antenna operating at Ka-band and compatible with the DSN that folds in a 1.5U stowage volume. For MarCO, JPL&#x27;s antenna engineers designed a Folded Panel Reflectarray (FPR) to fit on a 6U CubeSat bus and supports X-band Mars-to-Earth telecommunications at 8 kbit/s at 1AU.

=== Thermal management ===
Different CubeSat components possess different acceptable temperature ranges, beyond which they may become temporarily or permanently inoperable. Satellites in orbit are heated by radiative heat emitted from the Sun directly and reflected off Earth, as well as heat generated by the craft&#x27;s components. CubeSats must also cool by radiating heat either into space or into the cooler Earth&#x27;s surface, if it is cooler than the spacecraft. All of these radiative heat sources and sinks are rather constant and very predictable, so long as the CubeSat&#x27;s orbit and eclipse time are known.

Components used to ensure the temperature requirements are met in CubeSats include multi-layer insulation and heaters for the battery. Other spacecraft thermal control techniques in small satellites include specific component placement based on expected thermal output of those components and, rarely, deployed thermal devices such as louvers. Analysis and simulation of the spacecraft&#x27;s thermal model is an important determining factor in applying thermal management components and techniques. CubeSats with special thermal concerns, often associated with certain deployment mechanisms and payloads, may be tested in a thermal vacuum chamber before launch. Such testing provides a larger degree of assurance than full-sized satellites can receive, since CubeSats are small enough to fit inside of a thermal vacuum chamber in their entirety. Temperature sensors are typically placed on different CubeSat components so that action may be taken to avoid dangerous temperature ranges, such as reorienting the craft in order to avoid or introduce direct thermal radiation to a specific part, thereby allowing it to cool or heat.

===Costs===
CubeSat forms a cost-effective independent means of getting a payload into orbit. After delays from low-cost launchers such as Interorbital Systems, launch prices have been about $100,000 per unit, but newer operators are offering lower pricing. A typical price to launch a 1U cubesat with a full service contract (including end-to-end integration, licensing, transportation etc.) was about $60,000 in 2021.

Some CubeSats have complicated components or instruments, such as LightSail-1, that push their construction cost into the millions of dollars, but a basic 1U CubeSat can cost about $50,000 to construct. This makes CubeSats a viable option for some schools, universities, and small businesses.

==Past missions==

The &quot;Nanosatellite &amp; Cubesat Database&quot; lists over 2,000 CubeSats that have been launched since 1998. One of the earliest CubeSat launches was on 30 June 2003 from Plesetsk, Russia, with Eurockot Launch Services&#x27;s &quot;Multiple Orbit Mission&quot;. The CubeSats were injected into a Sun-synchronous orbit and included the Danish AAU CubeSat and DTUSat, the Japanese XI-IV and CUTE-1, the Canadian Can X-1, and the US Quakesat.

On February 13, 2012, three P-POD deployers containing seven CubeSats were placed into orbit along with the Lares satellite aboard a Vega rocket launched from French Guiana. The CubeSats launched were e-st@r Space (Politecnico di Torino, Italy), Goliat (University of Bucharest, Romania), MaSat-1 (Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Hungary), PW-Sat (Warsaw University of Technology, Poland), Robusta (University of Montpellier 2, France), UniCubeSat-GG (University of Rome La Sapienza, Italy), and XaTcobeo (University of Vigo and INTA, Spain). The CubeSats were launched in the framework of the &quot;Vega Maiden Flight&quot; opportunity of the European Space Agency.

On September 13, 2012, eleven CubeSats were launched from eight P-PODs, as part of the &quot;OutSat&quot; secondary payload aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. This was the largest number of CubeSats (and largest volume of 24U) orbited on a single launch so far, made possible by the new NPS CubeSat Launcher system (NPSCuL) developed at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). The CubeSats were: SMDC-ONE 2.2 (Baker), SMDC-ONE 2.1 (Able), AeroCube 4.0(x3), Aeneas, CSSWE, CP5, CXBN, CINEMA, and Re (STARE).
Five CubeSats (Raiko, Niwaka, We-Wish, TechEdSat, F-1) were placed into orbit from the International Space Station on October 4, 2012, as a technology demonstration of small satellite deployment from the ISS. They were launched and delivered to ISS as a cargo of Kounotori 3, and an ISS astronaut prepared the deployment mechanism attached to Japanese Experiment Module&#x27;s robotic arm.

Four CubeSats were deployed from the Cygnus Mass Simulator, which was launched April 21, 2013 on the maiden flight of Orbital Sciences&#x27; Antares rocket. Three of them are 1U PhoneSats built by NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center to demonstrate the use of smart phones as avionics in CubeSats. The fourth was a 3U satellite, called Dove-1, built by Planet Labs.

On April 26, 2013 NEE-01 Pegaso was launched and was the first CubeSat able to transmit live video from orbit, also the first 1U CubeSat to achieve more than 100 watts of power as installed capacity. Later in November same year NEE-02 Krysaor also transmitted live video from orbit. Both CubeSats were built by the Ecuadorian Space Agency.

A total of thirty-three CubeSats were deployed from the ISS on February 11, 2014. Of those thirty-three, twenty-eight were part of the Flock-1 constellation of Earth-imaging CubeSats. Of the other five, two are from other US-based companies, two from Lithuania, and one from Peru.

The LightSail-1 is a 3U CubeSat prototype propelled by a solar sail. It was launched on 20 May 2015 from Florida. Its four sails are made of very thin Mylar and have a total area of . This test will allow a full checkout of the satellite&#x27;s systems in advance of the main 2016 mission.

On October 5, 2015, AAUSAT5 (Aalborg University, Denmark), was deployed from the ISS. launched in the framework of the &quot;Fly Your Satellite!&quot; programme of the European Space Agency.

The Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer CubeSat is a 3U launched to the International Space Station on 6 December 2015 from where it was deployed on 16 May 2016. It is the first mission launched in the NASA Science Mission Directorate CubeSat Integration Panel, which is focused on doing science with CubeSats. As of 12 July 2016, the minimum mission success criterion (one month of science observations) has been met, but the spacecraft continues to perform nominally and observations continue.
Three CubeSats were launched on April 25, 2016, together with Sentinel-1B on a Soyuz rocket VS14 launched from Kourou, French Guiana. The satellites were: AAUSAT4 (Aalborg University, Denmark), e-st@r-II (Politecnico di Torino, Italy) and OUFTI-1 (Université de Liège, Belgium). The CubeSats were launched in the framework of the &quot;Fly Your Satellite!&quot; programme of the European Space Agency.

On February 15, 2017, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) set a record with the launch of 104 satellites on a single rocket. The launch of PSLV-C37 in a single payload, including the Cartosat-2 series and 103 co-passenger satellites, together weighed over . Of the 104 satellites, all but three were CubeSats. Of the 101 nano satellites, 96 were from the United States and one each from Israel, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.

===2018 InSight mission: MarCO CubeSats===

The May 2018 launch of the &quot;InSight&quot; stationary Mars lander included two CubeSats to fly by Mars to provide additional relay communications from &quot;InSight&quot; to Earth during entry and landing. This is the first flight of CubeSats outside of the Earth&#x27;s direct orbit. The mission CubeSat technology is called Mars Cube One (MarCO); each one is a six-unit CubeSat, . MarCO is an experiment, but not necessary for the &quot;InSight&quot; mission, to add relay communications to space missions in important time durations, in this case from the time of &quot;InSight&quot; atmospheric entry to its landing.

MarCO launched in May 2018 with the &quot;InSight&quot; lander, separated after launch and then traveled in their own trajectories to Mars. After separation, both MarCO spacecraft deployed two radio antennas and two solar panels. The high-gain, X band antenna is a flat panel to direct radio waves. MarCO navigated to Mars independently from the &quot;InSight&quot; lander, making their own course adjustments on the flight.

During &quot;InSight&quot; entry, descent and landing (EDL) in November 2018, the lander transmitted telemetry in the UHF radio band to NASA&#x27;s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) flying overhead. MRO forwarded EDL information to Earth using a radio frequency in the X band, but cannot simultaneously receive information in one band if transmitting on another. Confirmation of a successful landing could be received on Earth several hours after, so MarCO was a technology demonstration of real-time telemetry during the landing.

==Programs ==
===CubeSat Launch Initiative===

NASA&#x27;s CubeSat Launch Initiative created in 2010, provides CubeSat launch opportunities to educational institutions, non-profit organizations and NASA Centers. the CubeSat Launch Initiative had launched 46 CubeSats flown on 12 ELaNa Missions from 28 unique organizations and has selected 119 CubeSat missions from 66 unique organizations. Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) missions have included: BisonSat the first CubeSat built by a tribal college, TJ3Sat the first CubeSat built by a high school and STMSat-1 the first CubeSat built by an elementary school. NASA releases an Announcement of Opportunity in August of each year with selections made the following February.

=== Artemis 1 ===
NASA initiated the Cube Quest Challenge in 2015, a competition to foster innovation in the use of CubeSats beyond low Earth orbit. The Cube Quest Challenge offered $5 million to teams that met the challenge objectives of designing, building and delivering flight-qualified, small satellites capable of advanced operations near and beyond the Moon. Teams competed for a variety of prizes in lunar orbit or deep space. 10 CubeSats from different teams were launched to cislunar space as secondary payloads on board the Artemis 1 in 2022.

=== ESA &quot;Fly Your Satellite!&quot; ===
&quot;Fly Your Satellite!&quot; is the ongoing CubeSats programme of the Education Office of the European Space Agency. University students have the opportunity to develop and implement their CubeSat mission with support of ESA specialists. Participating student teams can experience the full cycle from designing, building, and testing to eventually, the possibility of launching and operating their CubeSat. The fourth iteration of the Fly Your Satellite! programme closed a call for proposals in February 2022.

=== Canadian Cubesat Project ===
The Canadian Space Agency announced the Canadian CubeSat Project (CCP) in 2017, and the participating teams were selected in May of 2018. The programme provides funding and support to one university or college in each province and territory to develop a CubeSat for launch from the ISS. The objective of the CCP is to provide students with direct hands on experience in the space industry, while preparing them to enter into a career in the space domain.
===QB50===
QB50 is a proposed international network of 50 CubeSats for multi-point, &quot;in-situ&quot; measurements in the lower thermosphere (90–350 km) and re-entry research. QB50 is an initiative of the Von Karman Institute and is funded by the European Commission as part of the 7th Framework Programme (FP7). Double-unit (2U) CubeSats (10×10×20 cm) are developed, with one unit (the &#x27;functional&#x27; unit) providing the usual satellite functions and the other unit (the &#x27;science&#x27; unit) accommodating a set of standardised sensors for lower thermosphere and re-entry research. 35 CubeSats are envisaged to be provided by universities from 22 countries around the world, among them 4 are from the US, 4 from China, 4 from France, 3 from Australia and 3 from South Korea. Ten 2U or 3U CubeSats are foreseen to serve for in-orbit technology demonstration of new space technologies.

The Request for Proposals (RFP) for the QB50 CubeSat was released on February 15, 2012. Two &quot;precursor&quot; QB50 satellites were launched aboard a Dnepr rocket on June 19, 2014.
All 50 CubeSats were supposed to be launched together on a single Cyclone-4 launch vehicle in February 2016, but due to the unavailability of the launch vehicle, 36 satellites were launched aboard Cygnus CRS OA-7 on 18 April 2017 and subsequently deployed from the ISS. A dozen other CubeSats were manifested on the PSLV-XL C38 mission in May 2017.

==Launch and deployment==

Unlike full-sized spacecraft, CubeSats can be delivered as cargo to, and deployed by the International Space Station. This presents an alternative method of achieving orbit apart from deployment by a launch vehicle. NanoRacks and Made in Space are developing means of constructing CubeSats on the International Space Station.

=== Existing launch systems ===
NASA&#x27;s CubeSat Launch Initiative launched more than 46 CubeSats on its ELaNa missions over the several years prior to 2016, and 57 were planned for flight over the next several years. No matter how inexpensive or versatile CubeSats may be, they must hitch rides as secondary payloads on large rockets launching much larger spacecraft, at prices starting around $100,000 as of 2015. Since CubeSats are deployed by P-PODs and similar deployment systems, they can be integrated and launched into virtually any launch vehicle. However, some launch service providers refuse to launch CubeSats, whether on all launches or only on specific launches, two examples were ILS and Sea Launch.

SpaceX and Japan Manned Space Systems Corporation (JAMSS) are two recent companies that offer commercial launch services for CubeSats as secondary payload, but a launch backlog still exists. Additionally, India&#x27;s ISRO has been commercially launching foreign CubeSats since 2009 as secondary payloads. On 15 Feb 2017, ISRO set the world record by launching 103 CubeSats on board its Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle for various foreign companies. ISC Kosmotras and Eurockot also offer launch services for CubeSats. SpaceX beat the record in 2021 with the Transporter-1 (spaceflight) carrying 143 spacecraft to orbit. Rocket Lab specializes in launching CubeSats on its Electron from New Zealand.

=== Future and proposed launch systems ===
On 5 May 2015, NASA announced a program based at the Kennedy Space Center to develop a class of rockets designed to launch very small satellites: the NASA Venture Class Launch Services (VCLS), which will offer a payload mass of 30 kg to 60 kg for each launcher. Five months later, in October 2015, NASA awarded a total of $17.1 million to three separate startup launch companies for one flight each: $6.9 million to Rocket Lab (Electron rocket); $5.5 million to Firefly Space Systems (Alpha rocket); and $4.7 million to Virgin Galactic (LauncherOne rocket). The payloads for the three flights under the VCLS contract have not yet been assigned. Other small satellite launch systems are under development that would carry CubeSats alongside a small payload, including the &quot;Neptune&quot; series of rockets by Interorbital Systems, Garvey Spacecraft&#x27;s &quot;Nanosat Launch Vehicle&quot;, and the SPARK rocket. In addition to conventional launch vehicles and facilitators like KSF Space, several air launch to orbit vehicles are in the works by Generation Orbit Launch Services and Boeing (in the form of their Small Launch Vehicle).

Many aspects of CubeSats such as structure, propulsion, material, computing and telecommunications, power, and additional specific instruments or measurement devices pose challenges to the use of CubeSat technology beyond Earth&#x27;s orbit. These challenges have been increasingly under consideration of international organizations over the past decade, for example, proposed in 2012 by NASA and the Jet Propulsion Lab, the INSPIRE spacecraft is an initial attempt at a spacecraft designed to prove the operational abilities of deep space CubeSats. The launch date was expected to be 2014, but has yet to occur and the date is listed by NASA as TBD.

=== Deployment ===

P-PODs (Poly-PicoSatellite Orbital Deployers) were designed with CubeSats to provide a common platform for secondary payloads. P-PODs are mounted to a launch vehicle and carry CubeSats into orbit and deploy them once the proper signal is received from the launch vehicle. The P-POD Mk III has capacity for three 1U CubeSats, or other 0.5U, 1U, 1.5U, 2U, or 3U CubeSats combination up to a maximum volume of 3U. Other CubeSat deployers exist, with the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer (NRCSD) on the International Space Station being the most popular method of CubeSat deployment as of 2014. Some CubeSat deployers are created by companies, such as the ISIPOD (Innovative Solutions In Space BV) or SPL (Astro und Feinwerktechnik Adlershof GmbH), while some have been created by governments or other non-profit institutions such as the X-POD (University of Toronto), T-POD (University of Tokyo), or the J-SSOD (JAXA) on the International Space Station. While the P-POD is limited to launching a 3U CubeSat at most, the NRCSD can launch a 6U () CubeSat and the ISIPOD can launch a different form of 6U CubeSat ().

While nearly all CubeSats are deployed from a launch vehicle or the International Space Station, some are deployed by the primary payloads themselves. For example, FASTSAT deployed the NanoSail-D2, a 3U CubeSat. This was done again with the Cygnus Mass Simulator as the primary payload launched on the maiden flight of the Antares rocket, carrying and later deploying four CubeSats. For CubeSat applications beyond Earth&#x27;s orbit, the method of deploying the satellites from the primary payload will also be adopted. Ten CubeSats were launched on the Artemis 1, placing them in the vicinity of the Moon. InSight, a Mars lander, also sent CubeSats beyond Earth orbit to use them as relay communications satellites. Known as MarCO A and B, they are the first CubeSats sent beyond the Earth–Moon system.

Chasqui I saw a unique deployment process, when it was deployed by hand during a spacewalk on the International Space Station in 2014.

<text>Liberty State Park (LSP) is a park in the U.S. state of New Jersey, located on Upper New York Bay in Jersey City opposite Liberty Island and Ellis Island. The park opened in 1976 to coincide with bicentennial celebrations and is operated and maintained by the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry. Liberty State Park covers .

The main part of the park is bordered by water on three sides: on the north by the Morris Canal Big Basin and on the south and east by Upper New York Bay. The New Jersey Turnpike Newark Bay Extension, which is part of I-78, marks its western perimeter.

==Geography==

Communipaw Cove is part of the state nature preserve in the park and is one of the few remaining tidal salt marshes along the Hudson River estuary.
The Nature Center, designed by architect Michael Graves, is part of the preserve. To the west lies the Interior Natural Area, which is off limits to the public and is being allowed through natural processes to recover from environmental abuse.

At the center of the park, 240 acres have been fenced off and contaminated with hazardous materials, such as chromium, arsenic, and petroleum. The six acre train shed is also fenced off and contaminated with asbestos.

==History==

Much of the park is situated on landfilled tidal flats. In the latter half of 19th century, a small island named Black Tom was joined via landfill with the mainland. It became a major shipping, manufacturing, and transportation hub within Port of New York and New Jersey, leading to the construction of Communipaw Terminal. It was from this ferry/train station that many immigrants arriving at Ellis Island spread out across the US. In 1916, on what is now the southeastern corner of the park, the Black Tom explosion killed as many as seven people, caused $20 million in property damage, and was felt throughout the Tri-State Region.

The park was conceived in the 1960s. with the land transferred from the city to the state in 1965. Jersey City residents Audrey Zapp, Theodore Conrad, Morris Pesin and J. Owen Grundy were influential environmentalists and historians who spearheaded the movement that led to the creation of Liberty State Park. They are remembered by the naming of places and streets along the waterfront.

It is estimated the park suffered $20 million in damages during Superstorm Sandy in October 2012. In June 2016, the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal reopened after a $20 million renovation to repair the extensive damage caused by Sandy. The Nature Center reopened in June 2021.

On January 11, 2018, it was announced by New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) that the interior of the park that have been closed off to the public for decades due to hazardous material and severely contaminated land would be remediated for the entire community to safely enjoy. The restoration is to be done in phases with the initial phase focusing on a parcel of the interior. There is currently no timeline yet for the remediation but the funding is to come from natural resource damage settlements. Work was slated to begin in 2021, though that has never happened, and the land sits fenced off and contaminated to this day.

==Points of interest==
===Freedom Way and Liberty Walkway===
Liberty Walkway, a crescent-shaped promenade, stretches from the CRRNJ Terminal along the waterfront south to the Statue of Liberty overlook, bridging two coves along the way. It is part of the longer Hudson River Waterfront Walkway. Halfway along Liberty Walkway is a bridge to Ellis Island, but only authorized vehicles are allowed.
The southeastern corner of the park contains the Statue of Liberty overlook, picnic facilities, a playground, the &quot;U.S. Flag Plaza&quot; and &quot;Liberation Monument&quot;, the Public Administration Building, and a memorial to the Black Tom explosions. Picnicking and barbecuing facilities are also located at the southern end of the park. Originally called &quot;Liberty Walk&quot;, this part of the project won a landscape award in 1995.

===Liberty Science Center===
Liberty Science Center, which lies in the western portion of the park, is an interactive science museum and learning center. The center opened in 1993 as New Jersey&#x27;s first major state science museum. It has science exhibits, the world&#x27;s 5th largest IMAX Dome theater, the largest planetarium in the Western Hemisphere, numerous educational resources, and the original Hoberman sphere, a silver, computer-driven engineering artwork designed by Chuck Hoberman.

===Monuments and memorials===
&quot;Liberation&quot; is a 1985 bronze sculpture designed by Nathan Rapoport as a memorial to the Holocaust, showing a U.S. soldier carrying out a survivor from a Nazi death camp.

&quot;La Vela di Colombo&quot; is a two-story sail-shaped bronze monument designed by Gino Gianetti that commemorates the 500th anniversary of the westward journey of Christopher Columbus to America in 1492. The &quot;Sail of Columbus&quot; sits atop a stone base in the shape of a ship and features scenes of Columbus and his travels. The gift from Government of Italy and the City of Genoa was dedicated in 1998.

&quot;Empty Sky&quot; is the official state memorial to the September 11 attacks of the World Trade Center. Situated on a berm the parallel walls engraved with the names of victims are oriented to face the former World Trade Center site. Designed by architect Frederic Schwartz, it was dedicated on September 10, 2011, commemorating the tenth anniversary of the attacks.

A temporary monument designed by Zaq Landsberg called &quot;Reclining Liberty&quot; will be on display adjacent to &quot;Empty Sky&quot; until April 2023. The monument, which shows the Statue of Liberty lying on her side, was previously on display in Harlem&#x27;s Marcus Garvey Park where it received attention from Time Out and Gothamist. It was inspired by reclining Buddha statues in Asia as its intended meaning is to reconsider the meaning of the United States which, like the Statue of Liberty, is as Landsberg describes &quot;an entity forever upright and tall&quot;.

==Liberty State Park Conservation, Recreation, and Community Inclusion Act==

The administration of Governor Chris Christie proposed various commercial activities for the park. In 2017, it suggested leasing large parts of the waterfront for private marinas.

Caven Point is a 22-acre man-made piece of land and sits adjacent to the Liberty National Golf Course. It is the only sandy beach along the shoreline and home to various migratory birds. Proposals to protect the land have been made in the New Jersey Legislature such as the Liberty State Park Protection Act to specifically protect the park from all development without a severe vetting process and public scrutiny.
That proposal has been rejected by both the senate and the assembly for its exclusion of the surrounding community. The Liberty State Park Conservation, Recreation, and Community Inclusion Act was passed in July 2022 with and as a result the community which had been intentionally left out of the conversation for decades would now be a part of the decision making within this park. “The Liberty State Park Conservation, Recreation, and Community Inclusion Act establishes a 17-member Liberty State Park Design Task Force within the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to assist with developing short-term plans to improve public use at the park.

==Transportation==
The Hudson-Bergen Light Rail runs just west of the park with a station at its entrance.

In July 2012, North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority allotted $175,000 to study transportation alternatives to and within the park.

In March 2013, Jersey City received a $500,000 grant to study the extension of Jersey Avenue directly into the park, to simplify access from the Downtown neighborhoods, facilitate through traffic to and from Communipaw, and provide alternatives for turnpike users to access the downtown. In May 2013, a new pedestrian-bike bridge was placed over Mill Creek at the small basin to replace an older one that had been destroyed by Superstorm Sandy in October 2012. It is situated so as not interfere with any new road construction.

In 2014 NJDOT announced that it would build a $10 million bridge over the Morris Canal Basin, reducing the commute between the park and Downtown Jersey City by more than half a mile. Construction of the connection between Jersey Ave and Phillip Street began in August 2019; the two-lane road with adjoining bike lanes was opened to traffic in August 2021. Since the opening, residents have complained about safety concerns and an increase in traffic congestion due to Holland Tunnel-bound traffic connecting to I-78 through the park. Prior to the bridge, the Mayor Steven Fulop announced the city administration is experimenting with traffic light timing and collaborating with navigation service Waze to reduce congestion.

==In popular culture==

On Labor Day in 1980, Republican Nominee for President Ronald Reagan kicked off his national campaign on Liberty Island, with the Statue of Liberty behind him and said: &#x27;I want more than anything I&#x27;ve ever wanted, to have an administration that will, through its actions, at home and in the international arena, let millions of people know that Miss Liberty still &quot;Lifts her lamp beside the golden door.&quot;&#x27;

In 2002, Budweiser filmed two commercials to dedicate the September 11 attacks in the park (one in 2002, and another one in 2011). Both were only aired once.

Since 2007, the Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic is held every Spring at Liberty State Park.

In May 2010, plans were put forth outlining the use of the park as the new home of the United States Formula One Grand Prix for the 2012 season. These plans met outrage from the community, particularly the Friends of Liberty State Park, and were ultimately rejected by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.

On June 19 and 20, 2010, the park hosted the fifth round of the 2010 Red Bull Air Race World Championship.

In 2026, the park will host the FIFA Fan Festival for the New York/New Jersey area as part of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

<text>Virginia Union University is a private historically black university in Richmond, Virginia.

==History==
The American Baptist Home Mission Society (ABHMS) founded the school as Richmond Theological Institute in 1865 shortly after Union troops took control of Richmond, Virginia, at the end of the American Civil War, for African-American freedmen to enter into the ministry. The college had the first academic library at a historically black college or university (HBCU), building the library in 1865 which was the same year the college was established.

Its mission was soon expanded to offer courses and programs at college, high school, and preparatory levels, to both men and women. This effort was the beginning of Virginia Union University. Separate branches of the National Theological Institute were set up in Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Virginia, with classes beginning in 1867. In Washington, the school became known as Wayland Seminary, named in commemoration of Francis Wayland, former president of Brown University and a leader in the anti-slavery struggle. The first and only president there was George Mellen Prentiss King, who administered Wayland for thirty years (1867–1897). Famous students there included Booker T. Washington and Adam Clayton Powell, Sr.

Beginning in 1867, Colver Institute was housed in a building long known as Lumpkin&#x27;s Jail, a former &quot;slave jail&quot; owned by Mary Ann Lumpkin, the African-American widow of the deceased white owner. It became Richmond Theological Institute (formerly Colver) and joined with Wayland Seminary of Washington in 1899 to form Virginia Union University at Richmond.

In 1932, the women&#x27;s college Hartshorn Memorial College, established in Richmond in 1883, became a part of Virginia Union University. Storer College, a historically black Baptist college in West Virginia founded in 1867, merged its endowment with Virginia Union in 1964.

==Academics==
The university is divided into four main schools:

* Evelyn Reid Syphax School of Education and Interdisciplinary Studies
* School of Arts and Sciences
* Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Theology
* Sydney Lewis School of Business

===Theology program===
Virginia Union University&#x27;s Theological training program is called The Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Theology. James Henry Harris, the early American civil rights advocate, was a graduate. The school is a member of the Washington Theological Consortium.

==Student activities==
There are over 20 student organizations, including several fraternities and sororities.

==Athletics==
Virginia Union competes in the NCAA Division II in the Eastern Division of the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association. The school has varsity teams in men&#x27;s basketball, football, cross country, golf, tennis and track and field, and in women&#x27;s basketball, bowling, cross country, tennis and track and field, softball and volleyball.

In 2018, both Virginia Union University&#x27;s DII Men &amp; Women&#x27;s Basketball Teams won the CIAA Championship.
Virginia Union plays basketball and volleyball in the Barco-Stevens Hall, built as the Belgian Building for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The building, which has stone reliefs depicting the Belgian Congo, was one of thirteen facilities designated as &quot;unique&quot; by &quot;NCAA News&quot; in 2005. The building was awarded to the university in 1941 and moved to its present location in 1943. The basketball team began using the facility in early 1947.

== Affiliations ==
It is affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA.

<text>Union Presbyterian Seminary is a Presbyterian seminary in Richmond, Virginia, and Charlotte, North Carolina, offering graduate theological education in multiple modalities: in-person, hybrid, and online.

==History==
As a result of efforts undertaken together by the Synod of Virginia and the Synod of North Carolina, Union Theological Seminary was founded in 1812 as the theological department of Hampden–Sydney College, located near Farmville, Virginia, and housed in what is now named Venable Hall. In 1895, Lewis Ginter, a financier and philanthropist in Richmond, donated eleven acres of land to the school, which was relocated to its current campus location on the north side of Richmond in 1898. The General Assembly&#x27;s Training School (ATS) for Lay Workers was founded in Richmond in 1914 as a complementary institution intended to train &quot;workers outside of the regular ordained ministry.&quot; In 1959 ATS was renamed the Presbyterian School of Christian Education (PSCE). PSCE offered a master&#x27;s degree in Christian Education, and operated across the street from Union Seminary until 1997, when Union and PSCE were joined in federation, becoming Union-PSCE. In 2002, a commuter campus in Charlotte, North Carolina, began on the campus of Queens University of Charlotte, offering both M.Div. and M.A.C.E. degrees to part-time students. The Charlotte campus for Union Presbyterian was relocated to its new facility on 5141 Sharon Road in 2012.

In 2009, Union&#x27;s board of trustees voted to change the name of the institution to Union Presbyterian Seminary, partially as a means of distinguishing it from Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. In his address announcing the new name, seminary president Brian Blount emphasized the school&#x27;s unique heritage of several &quot;unions&quot;, as well as the school&#x27;s Presbyterian identity.

For many years, the seminary operated WRFK, an FM radio station at 106.5 MHz. WRFK was sold to commercial interests in 1988.

==Faculty==
Union has a faculty of scholars in the fields of Bible, Christian education, theology, ethics, preaching, worship, church history, Christian leadership, and pastoral care. Faculty come from a range of denominational backgrounds, including Baptist, Lutheran, and Methodist. Notable retired faculty include Bible scholar James L. Mays and Brian Blount.

==Student body==
Union&#x27;s student body is made up of about 180 students, with 90 students at the Richmond campus and 84 more students at the Charlotte campus. The majority of Union&#x27;s students come from the Presbyterian tradition, but the seminary draws students from more than 20 Christian denominations, including Baptist, Methodist, Episcopalian, and Reformed. There are a number of international students, from Ghana, South Korea, Switzerland, and other nations.

Students at Union take part in a number of student activities and seminary initiatives, such as mission and service activities to Shalom Farms in the city of Richmond.

==Campuses==

Union&#x27;s Richmond campus includes two chapels: the historic Watts Chapel, located in Watts Hall, which also serves as a classroom and administration building; and the state-of-the-art Lake Chapel, located in the campus&#x27;s Early Center, a classroom and office building completed in 2008. The Richmond campus also includes the Belk student center, dormitories, student apartments, and guest housing, as well as recreation fields, community gardens, and tennis courts. Union&#x27;s William Smith Morton Library was completed in 1996; it includes over 900,000 volumes and adds about 5,500 volumes per year.

The seminary&#x27;s Charlotte campus is located on 5141 Sharon Road. This facility, opened in 2012, houses a chapel, library, classrooms, a regional Christian Education Resource Center, and office facilities.

<text>The Bellmaker is a fantasy novel by Brian Jacques, published in 1994. It is chronologically the seventh book in the &quot;Redwall&quot; series.

==Plot summary==

Far away, from the northern sea, the Foxwolf Urgan Nagru and his wife Silvamord arrive in Southsward, bringing two shiploads of rats and storms the Castle Floret. Nagru, the Foxwolf, captures Gael Squirrelking, his wife Serena, their son Truffen and his nursemaid Muta, a mute badger. Entrance to the castle was gained through Silvamord&#x27;s deceit in feigning weakness and ill fortune in both herself and Urgan Nagru. She then took Truffen the squirrel babe hostage until the gate was opened to the hordes of awaiting rats.

Meanwhile, Dandin and Mariel Gullwhacker have set out from Redwall Abbey but have found themselves stuck in the southern dunes without food. After befriending a hedgehog named Bowly Pintips, they find themselves attempting to save a mole who happened to be under attack by Nagru&#x27;s rat troops. Just as the trio of would-be rescuers realise their peril, Field Marshal Meldrum Fallowthorn the Magnificent bounds to their aid, accompanied by his four leveret nephews.
Back in Southsward, Gael&#x27;s otter allies have begun planning a rescue mission. Led by Rab Streambattle, the otters manage to rescue Serena and Truffen, but Gael and Muta encounter trouble. Unable to escape, Muta and Rab stand their ground against waves of Nagru&#x27;s rat troops, fighting until they collapse under the innumerable odds, presumed dead.

Dandin, Mariel and Meldrum survive long enough to fend off Nagru&#x27;s last effort, two of his psychotic tracking ermine, called Dirgecallers, who were unleashed to track down the escape prisoners. Mariel and her companions manage to kill the trackers, allowing Serena and Truffen to escape to safety, but they are not able to avoid Nagru&#x27;s rat troops, as they are captured and led back to Castle Floret.

Back at Redwall Abbey, Joseph the Bellmaker, the father of Mariel, has a vision. Inspired by Martin the Warrior, the legendary Champion and protector of Redwall, Joseph recruits a hare (The Honourable Rosemary, or Hon Rosie for short), a hedgehog (Durry Quill), a squirrel (Rufe Brush) and the Foremole, the leader of moles. Accompanied by Log-a-Log and a band of Guosim shrews, the band reaches the coast. Intent on finding the place shown to him in his vision, Joseph and his companions befriend Finnbarr Galedeep, a rusky wild sea otter, who helps them deceive searat brothers Slipp and Strapp, stealing the excellent &quot;Pearl Queen&quot; in the process. Strapp steals the crew of his brother, Slipp and gives chase aboard his ship, the &quot;Shalloo&quot;, but they are all lost at sea when the ship sinks into a whirlpool called the &#x27;Green Maelstrom&#x27;.

As Joseph and company sail towards Castle Floret and Urgan Nagru, Slipp and Blaggut, his good-natured first mate, head into Mossflower Woods.

When they awaken, Mariel, Dandin and Meldrum find themselves in the dungeons of Castle Floret, along with the battered Gael Squirrelking. With a bit of luck and the help of Glokkpod, a shrike, they manage to escape, but Mariel becomes separated from her friends. As she attempts to find safety, Mariel meets Egbert the Scholar, an old mole living beneath Castle Floret, who happened to find Rab and Muta and nursed them back to health. Psychologically damaged from their near-death battle, the two warriors are intense, but refuse to speak. With their help, Mariel finds her way inside the castle and lowers the drawbridge.

At Redwall Abbey, the two rats have arrived and found refuge in the kind, peaceful Abbey. Slipp, after a failed plan to find treasure with a band of Dibbuns, has had enough; he attacks and kills the local Badger Mother, Mellus, and escapes the Abbey with Blaggut and a chalice. After Blaggut learns the truth, he kills his captain and returns to the Abbey with the chalice, seeking forgiveness, which he eventually receives.

On the &quot;Pearl Queen&quot;, many calamities had befallen the Redwallers and their crew, including whirlpools, sharks, shipwrecked islands, and crazy toads. Hon Rosie was taken for dead for some time, but showed up in fine form later. Three young orphans are acquired as well: the squirrel Benjy, the mousemaid Wincey, and the little ottermaid Figgs. They eventually arrive at Southsward and, with the help of some clans they meet on the way, arrive at Castle Floret, ready for battle.

A massive battle ensues in which Mariel, Dandin, Meldrum, the otters, Finnbarr, Joseph, and the rest fight Nagru&#x27;s horde of grey rats, most of which are slaughtered. However, the shrew Fatch, a good friend of Rufe and Durry, is slain by Silvamord. Rab Streambattle, who had recently reunited with his wife Iris and regained his sanity, kills Silvamord in the moat shortly afterward for although she is a mighty warrior, she is unable to swim. In the final battle, Finnbarr Galedeep engages Urgan Nagru and kills him by smashing the fangs of his wolf skull into the top of his head. However, Finnbarr dies from the wounds inflicted during the fight.

With Urgan vanquished and his horde depleted, peace is restored upon Castle Floret and Southsward. Gael is reinstated as Squirrelking of Floret with his family and Muta. While the other Redwallers return to the abbey, Joseph stays in Southsward to help restore order. Mariel, Dandin, and Bowly, their warrior spirits unable to be stilled, take off once more in search of adventure.
