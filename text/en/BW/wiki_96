<text>Banditry is a type of organized crime committed by outlaws typically involving the threat or use of violence. A person who engages in banditry is known as a bandit and primarily commits crimes such as extortion, robbery, kidnapping, and murder, either as an individual or in groups. Banditry is a vague concept of criminality and in modern usage can be synonymous with gangsterism, brigandage, , terrorism, piracy, and thievery.

==Definitions==
The term &quot;bandit&quot; (introduced to English via Italian around 1776) originates with the early Germanic legal practice of outlawing criminals, termed &quot;*bamnan&quot; (English ban). The legal term in the Holy Roman Empire was &quot;Acht&quot; or &quot;Reichsacht&quot;, translated as &quot;Imperial ban&quot;. In modern Italian, the equivalent word &quot;bandito&quot; literally means banned or a banned person.

The New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (NED) defined &quot;bandit&quot; in 1885 as &quot;one who is proscribed or outlawed; hence, a lawless desperate marauder, a brigand: usually applied to members of the organized gangs which infest the mountainous districts of Italy, Sicily, Spain, Greece, Iran, and Turkey&quot;.

In modern usage the word has become a synonym for &quot;thief&quot;, hence the term &quot;one-armed bandit&quot; for gambling machines that can leave the gambler with no money.

==Types==
===Social bandit===

&quot;Social banditry&quot; is a term invented by the historian Eric Hobsbawm in his 1959 book &quot;Primitive Rebels&quot;, a study of popular forms of resistance that also incorporate behaviour characterized as illegal. He further expanded the field in the 1969 study &quot;Bandits&quot;. Social banditry is a widespread phenomenon that has occurred in many societies throughout recorded history, and forms of social banditry still exist, as evidenced by piracy and organized crime syndicates.

==History==
===Europe===
====Medieval period====
Tradition depicts medieval German robber barons as bandits.

Pope Sixtus V had about 5,000 bandits executed in the five years before his death in 1590, but there were reputedly 27,000 more at liberty throughout Central Italy.

====Brigandry in Italy====

Banditry or brigandry, while existing in Italy since pre-historic times, became particularly widespread in Southern Italy following the Unification of Italy in the 1860s. Brigands such as Carmine Crocco, Michelina Di Cesare, Ninco Nanco, and Nicola Napolitano were active during this period and eventually developed followings as folk heroes. Brigandage in Southern Italy continued sporadically following the 1870s, with brigands such as Giuseppe Musolino and Francesco Paolo Varsallona forming bandit gangs at the turn of the 20th century. Salvatore Giuliano and Gaspare Pisciotta formed a brigand group in Sicily in the 1940s to 1950 and similarly became known as folk heroes. Sardinia has a long history of banditry, with the bandit and kidnapping group &quot;anonima sarda&quot; being the most recent manifestation of this phenomenon.

==== Nazi-occupied Europe ====

In Nazi-occupied Europe from 1939 to 1945, the German doctrine of (&quot;bandit fighting&quot;) portrayed opponents of the Greater Germanic Reich as &quot;bandits&quot; — dangerous criminals who did not deserve any consideration as human beings. German authorities suppressed partisan opposition with maximum force
and, usually, with the mass slavery of civilians from partisan-controlled areas.

===China===
==== Ming China ====
Banditry (Dao, qiangdao) in Ming China (1368–1644) was defined by the Ming government as “‘robbery by force’ punishable by death.” But throughout the dynasty, people had entered into the occupation of banditry for various reasons and the occupation of banditry was fluid and temporary.

===== Causes and opportunities =====
Ming China was largely an agricultural society and contemporary observers remarked that famine and subsequent hardship often gave rise to banditry. In his 1991 book &quot;Disorder under Heaven: Collective Violence in the Ming Dynasty&quot;, James W. Tong uses data from provincial and prefectural gazetteers of the Ming and the Qing Dynasties to analyze patterns of violence during the Ming Dynasty. Tong analyzes that the peasants had to make a &quot;rational choice&quot; between surviving harsh conditions and surviving through illegal activities of banditry. He identifies multiple important factors in peasants&#x27; calculation of whether to become bandits or not, such as the government&#x27;s ability to punish bandits. Tong concludes that his &quot;rational choice model predicts that there would be more rebellions and banditry where the likelihood of surviving hardship is minimal but the likelihood of surviving as an outlaw is maximal.&quot; As a result, Tong finds that banditry, like other types of collective violence, had a spatial and temporal pattern. Banditry was especially pervasive in the southern provinces (most notably Guangdong and Fujian) and the second half of the dynasty (1506-1644).

However, the Northern China and the middle Ming period (1450–1525) had their fair share of banditry. Mounted banditry was the major and pervasive type of banditry plaguing roads around the capital Beijing and its surrounding areas, administrated and named as the Capital Region. Xiangmazei (whistling arrow bandits) was a category of mounted bandits named after their practice of firing whistling arrows to alert their victims. Whistling arrow bandits had troubled the Capital Region throughout the first three decades of the sixteenth century. They had posed such serious threat that special police attention was given to them and failure to arrest them on time incurred severer punishment (further information on Ming justice system can be found in History of criminal justice).

Ming historian David M. Robinson identifies some prominent causes of banditry in the Capital Region. The Region was agriculturally disadvantaged due to constant flood, and thus the peasants often lived in poverty. Furthermore, the Region&#x27;s economy provided plentiful opportunities for highway robbery. In addition to the highly developed economy of Beijing, the Region also contained numerous commercial cities; these cities not only attracted merchants but also bandits. Robinson also points out that many eunuchs in Beijing resorted to banditry. As Shih-Shan Henry Tsai explained, self-castration was just another way to escape impoverishment; and when a group of eunuchs failed to find employment in the palace, they often turned to mob violence.

The Capital Region also housed a huge number of soldiers with Ming&#x27;s system of hereditary military and a major portion of bandits were actually soldiers stationed in the region. In 1449, Mongolian soldiers in the service of Ming attacked and plundered Beijing area. Another report of 1489 attested that soldiers had raided in Henan province. Robinson points out that &quot;dire economic straits&quot; forced soldiers to use illegal means to make a living. Also, policies and conditions in the Capital Region provided opportunities for soldiers/bandits to dodge governmental punishment. During the Ming Dynasty, military and civil jurisdictions were separated. This was especially troubling when soldiers lived physically far from their superiors: when soldiers committed robbery, civil officials had no jurisdiction nor power to apprehend them. Policy of transporting nearby garrisons to Beijing for annual training also created opportunities for banditry. One official reported that soldiers travelling by the Grand Canal from adjacent garrisons to the capital committed robbery and murder against civilian travelers and merchants; on the land, these soldiers had fallen into mounted banditry as well.

===== Techniques, organization, livelihood, and risks =====
Bandits’ technique involved the martial skills to use various weapons, ranging from bows and arrows to swords. Another important skill was horsemanship, especially in the Northern Capital Region, where mounted banditry concentrated. As shown above, a large number of bandits were actually garrison soldiers and had access to and able usage of weapons and armors. Another skill was the ability to deploy road blocks to stop and prey on travelers.

Once they forcefully acquired goods and commodities, bandits had to sell them. One 1485 official report revealed that local people, some probably working as fences (see Fences in Ming China), purchased stolen animals and goods from highway bandits at lower prices. Robinson further points out that &quot;[a] widespread network to dispose of the stolen livestock linked&quot; towns in the Capital Region to nearby provinces.

The career nor the identity of a bandit was permanent. Some bandits actually had a settled life and were even married. &quot;Veritable Records of the Ming Dynasty&quot; relates that the great bandit Zhang Mao lived in a big mansion in his hometown Wenan. Similarly, Zhang&#x27;s comrades Liu Brothers and Tiger Yang had wives and children.

Bandits often operated in groups under one or more leaders. These charismatic leaders were not only skilled in fighting and riding but also possessed material and social capital. One exemplary leader was Zhang Mao of Wenan. He had assembled a massive following and by using his connection and wealth, he managed to bribe and befriend important eunuchs in the court.

Of course, the Ming government used a heavy hand to crack down on banditry. Local commanders and constables were responsible for apprehending bandits, but the emperors often dispatched special censors to cope with rampant banditry. Ning Gao was one of the censors of 1509, and he employed gruesome means such as display of severed heads and body parts to kill off existing bandits and to intimidate potential ones. Other than escaping to difficult terrains, powerful bandits used their connections with high-standing figures in the capital to negotiate safety. In one occasion, the influential eunuch Zhang Zhong helped his sworn brother Zhang Mao to negotiate with a commander sent to hunt down local bandits. However, such patronage did not guarantee immunity. An effective and determined official, empowered by influential superiors or eunuchs, could pose a severe threat to bandits’ survival. Through a well-planned raid, Ning Gao, a client of another powerful eunuch Liu Jin, successfully wounded and captured Zhang Mao, who was then transported to Beijing and executed.

===== Future paths of bandits =====
Even though bandits were subject to capital punishment, they could still be incorporated into the regime, serving as local police forces and personal soldiers employed by officials to secure order and suppress bandits. Such transition was not permanent and could often be reversed. Tiger Yang once served as a personal military retainer of the aforementioned Ning Gao before turning to banditry; similarly, when facing unemployment, some of Ning&#x27;s former &quot;bandit catchers&quot; simply joined the bandit leaders Liu Brothers.

The career of banditry often led leaders to assemble more bandits and army deserters and organize predatory gangs into active rebel groups. One example was Gao Yingxiang, who started as a mounted bandit in Shaanxi and later became an important rebel leader in late Ming. Another example would be Deng Maoqi, a bandit in Fujian who perpetrated robbery on roads and in villages in the late 1440s. His gang of bandits eventually grew into a rebel army and Deng conducted attacks on the government in Fujian. Bandit-rebels were not only common in late Ming. In 1510 and 1511, several bandit gangs under the leadership of Liu Brothers, Tiger Yang raided and plundered Shandong and Henan. Their illegal actions eventually evolved into open rebellion against the Ming Dynasty as they blatantly besieged cities, seized imperial weaponry, extended area of operation southward, and even assumed rhetoric and attire of an imperial dynasty. The rebellion took the Ming almost two years to crush.

Similarly, small groups of local bandits could also end up joining larger groups of rebels. Robinson points out that bandits obviously perceived the benefits of supporting rebel cause but they also could be repelled to join; as a result, the 1510s rebels attracted a lot of local bandits and outlaws as they moved from one place to another.

====Republican period====
Marauding was one of the most common peasant reactions to oppression and hardship. In early Republican China, the growth of warlord armies during the Warlord era was also accompanied by a dramatic increase in bandit activity exploiting the lawlessness. By 1930, the total bandit population was estimated to be 20 million.

<doc id="658203" wikidata="Q2642473" url="?curid=658203" title="GPRS core network">
<text>The GPRS core network is the central part of the general packet radio service (GPRS) which allows 2G, 3G and WCDMA mobile networks to transmit Internet Protocol (IP) packets to external networks such as the Internet. The GPRS system is an integrated part of the GSM network switching subsystem.

The network provides mobility management, session management and transport for IP packet services in GSM and WCDMA networks. The core network also provides support for other functions such as billing and lawful interception. It was also proposed, at one stage, to support packet radio services in the US D-AMPS TDMA system, however, in practice, all of these networks have been converted to GSM so this option has become irrelevant.

PRS module is an open standards driven system. The standardization body is the 3GPP.

==GPRS tunnelling protocol (GTP)==

&quot;GPRS Tunnelling Protocol&quot; is the defining IP-based protocol of the GPRS core network. Primarily it is the protocol which allows end users of a GSM or WCDMA network to move from place to place while continuing to connect to the Internet as if from one location at the Gateway GPRS support node (GGSN). It does this by carrying the subscriber&#x27;s data from the subscriber&#x27;s current serving GPRS support node (SGSN) to the GGSN which is handling the subscriber&#x27;s session. Three forms of GTP are used by the GPRS core network.

;GTP-U: for transfer of user data in separated tunnels for each Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context
;GTP-C: for control reasons including:
:* setup and deletion of PDP contexts;
:* verification of GSN reachability;
:* updates; e.g., as subscribers move from one SGSN to another.
;GTP&#x27; (pronounced &quot;GTP Prime&quot;): for transfer of charging data to the Charging Gateway Function.

==GPRS support nodes (GSN)==
A GSN is a network node that supports the use of GPRS in the GSM core network. All GSNs should have a &quot;Gn&quot; interface and support the GPRS tunneling protocol. There are two key variants of the GSN, namely gateway GPRS support node and serving GPRS support node.

===Gateway GPRS support node (GGSN)===
The gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) is one of two components of the GPRS PS domain. The GGSN together with the SGSN handle packet transmissions between the GPRS network and external packet-switched networks, such as the Internet or an X.25 network.

From an external network&#x27;s point of view, the GGSN is a router to a &quot;sub-network&quot;, because the GGSN ‘hides’ the GPRS infrastructure from the external network. When the GGSN receives data addressed to a specific user, it checks if the user is active. If it is, the GGSN forwards the data to the SGSN serving the mobile user, but if the mobile user is inactive, the data is discarded. In the other direction, mobile-originated packets are routed to the right network by the GGSN.

The GGSN is the anchor point that enables the mobility of the user terminal in the GPRS/UMTS networks. In essence, it carries out the role in GPRS equivalent to the home agent in Mobile IP. It maintains routing necessary to tunnel the protocol data units (PDUs) to the SGSN that services a particular mobile station (MS).

The GGSN converts the GPRS packets coming from the SGSN into the appropriate packet data protocol (PDP) format (e.g., IP or X.25) and sends them out on the corresponding packet data network. In the other direction, PDP addresses of incoming data packets are converted to the GSM address of the destination user. The readdressed packets are sent to the responsible SGSN. For this purpose, the GGSN stores the current SGSN address of the user and his or her profile in its location register. The GGSN is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router for the connected user equipment (UE). The GGSN also performs authentication and charging functions.

Other functions include subscriber screening, IP pool management and address mapping, QoS and PDP context enforcement.

With LTE scenario the GGSN functionality moves to SAE gateway (with SGSN functionality working in MME).

===Serving GPRS support node (SGSN)===
The Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) is the node that is serving the MS/UE. The SGSN supports GPRS and/or UMTS. The SGSN keeps track of the location of an individual MS/UE and performs security functions and access control. The SGSN is connected to the GERAN base station system through the Gb or Iu interface and/or to the UTRAN through the Iu interface.
A SGSN is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the mobile stations within its geographical service area. Its tasks include packet routing and transfer, mobility management (attach/detach and location management), logical link management, and authentication and charging functions. The location register of the SGSN stores location information (e.g., current cell, current VLR) and user profiles (e.g., IMSI, address(es) used in the packet data network) of all GPRS users registered with it.

====Common SGSN functions====
* Detunnel GTP packets from the GGSN (downlink)
* Tunnel IP packets toward the GGSN (uplink)
* Carry out mobility management when a standby mode mobile moves from one routing area to another routing area
* Billing a user according to data used.
* Mobile Equipment Identity Check Procedure (Gf/S13&#x27; interfaces).
* The SMS GMSCs and SMS IWMSCs support SMS transmission via the SGSN.
* The Offline Charging System (OFCS) collects charging records from SGSNs.
* The SGSN contains mechanisms for avoiding and handling overload situations. 
* The SGSN communicate with other SGSN(s) and/or MME(s) (Mobility Management Entity) (Gn/S16/S3 interfaces)

====GSM/EDGE specific SGSN functions====
Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) specific SGSN functions and characteristics are:
* Maximum data rate of approx. 60 kbit/s (150 kbit/s for EDGE) per subscriber
* Connect via Frame Relay or IP to the packet control unit using the Gb protocol stack
* Accept uplink data to form IP packets
* Encrypt downlink data, decrypt uplink data
* Carry out mobility management to the level of a cell for connected mode mobiles

====WCDMA specific SGSN functions====
* Carry up to about 42 Mbit/s traffic downlink and 5.8 Mbit/s traffic uplink (HSPA+)
* Tunnel/detunnel downlink/uplink packets toward the radio network controller (RNC)

==Access point==
An access point is:
* An IP network to which a mobile set can be connected
* A set of settings that are used for that connection
* A particular option in a set of settings in a mobile phone

When a GPRS mobile phone sets up a PDP context, the access point
is selected. At this point an Access Point Name (APN) is
determined

:Example: aricenttechnologies.mnc012.mcc345.gprs
:Example: geocell
:Example: internet
:Example: hcl.cisco.ggsn

This access point is then used in a DNS query to a private DNS
network. This process (called APN resolution) finally gives the IP
address of the GGSN which should serve the access point. At this
point a PDP context can be activated.

==PDP context==
The packet data protocol (PDP; e.g., IP, X.25, FrameRelay) context is a data structure present on both the &quot;serving GPRS support node&quot; (SGSN) and the &quot;gateway GPRS support node&quot; (GGSN) which contains the subscriber&#x27;s session information when the subscriber has an active session.
When a mobile wants to use GPRS, it must first attach and then &quot;activate a PDP context&quot;.
This allocates a PDP context data structure in the SGSN that the subscriber is currently visiting and the GGSN serving the subscriber&#x27;s access point. The data recorded includes

* Subscriber&#x27;s IP address
* Subscriber&#x27;s IMSI
* Subscriber&#x27;s Tunnel Endpoint ID (TEID) at the GGSN
* Subscriber&#x27;s Tunnel Endpoint ID (TEID) at the SGSN

==Reference points and interfaces==
Within the GPRS core network standards, there are a number of interfaces and reference points (logical points of connection that probably share a common physical connection with other reference points). Some of these names can be seen in the network structure diagram on this page.

===Interfaces in the GPRS network===

;Ga: The interface serves the CDRs (accounting-records) which are written in the GSN and sent to the charging gateway (CG). This interface uses a GTP-based protocol, with modifications that supports CDRs (Called &quot;GTP&#x27; &quot; and &quot;GTP prime&quot;).
;Gb: Interface between the base station subsystem and the SGSN the transmission protocol could be Frame Relay or IP.
;Iu: Interface between the Radio Network Controller and the SGSN. The interface exchanges signaling and payload. 
;Gc: Interface between the GGSN and HLR so that the GGSN can get the location details of a mobile station. To avoid implementing MAP/SS7 in the GGSN, this interface is optional. When not present, the GGSN routes inquires to the HLR via an SGSN.
;Gd: Interface between the SGSN and the SMS Gateway. Can use MAP1, MAP2 or MAP3.
;Ge: The interface between the SGSN and the service control point (SCP); uses the CAP protocol.
;Gf: The interface between the SGSN and the Equipment Identity Register (EIR), used for checking the mobile&#x27;s equipment identity number (IMEI) against a list of reported stolen mobile phones.
;Gi: IP-based interface between the GGSN and a public data network (PDN) either directly to the Internet or through a WAP gateway.
;Gmb: The interface between the GGSN and the Broadcast-Multicast Service Center (BM-SC), used for controlling MBMS bearers.
;Gn: IP-based interface between SGSN and other SGSNs and (internal) GGSNs. DNS also shares this interface. Uses the GTP Protocol.
;Gp: IP-based interface between internal SGSN and external GGSNs. Between the SGSN and the external GGSN, there is the border gateway (which is essentially a firewall). Also uses the GTP Protocol.
;Gr: Interface between the SGSN and the HLR. Messages going through this interface uses the MAP3 protocol.
;Gs: Interface between the SGSN and the MSC (VLR). Uses the BSSAP+ protocol. This interface allows paging and station availability when it performs data transfer. When the station is attached to the GPRS network, the SGSN keeps track of which routing area (RA) the station is attached to. An RA is a part of a larger location area (LA). When a station is paged this information is used to conserve network resources. When the station performs a PDP context, the SGSN has the exact BTS the station is using.
;Gx: The online policy interface between the GGSN and the charging rules function (CRF). It is used for provisioning service data flow based on charging rules. Uses the diameter protocol.
;Gy: The online charging interface between the GGSN and the online charging system (OCS). Uses the diameter protocol (DCCA application).
;Gz: The off-line (CDR-based) charging interface between the GGSN and the Charging system Uses GTP&#x27;.
;Lg: The interface between the SGSN and the Gateway Mobile Location Center (GMLC), used for location-based services.
;S3: This interface is defined between the SGSN and the MME and it is used to exchange user and bearer information in inter-system mobility procedures. This interface is implemented using eGTP-C.
;S4: This interface is defined between the SGSN and the SGW (Serving Gateway). The term &quot;S4-SGSN&quot; refers to a Release-8 SGSN that has at least one set of S4/S3/S16 interfaces enabled.
;S6d: The interface between SGSN and Home Subscriber Server (HSS). It is a Diameter based interface that is used for transferring subscription and authentication data of the user to HSS for authenticating and authorizing user access.
;S13&#x27;: This interface is defined between the SGSN and the EIR (Equipment Identity Register). The S13&#x27; interface applies only to the S4-based SGSN. The interface is based on Diameter protocol.
;S16: This interface is defined between two SGSNs and exclusively uses GTPv2-C.

<doc id="658204" wikidata="Q1189996" url="?curid=658204" title="James Fox (singer)">
<text>James Richard Mullett (born 6 April 1976), known professionally as James Fox, is a Welsh pop singer, songwriter, pianist and guitarist. He represented the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 in Istanbul. In 2008, he wrote and recorded the Cardiff City F.C. FA Cup Final song, &quot;Bluebirds Flying High&quot;.

==Biography==
Fox was born in Cardiff and grew up in Gilfach, Bargoed, in the Rhymney Valley, a former mining community in south-east Wales. Inspired by his musician father, Richard, Fox took piano lessons from the age of six, and later taught himself to play guitar, the drums, harmonica and mandolin. He attended Heolddu Comprehensive School.

Fox is a passionate supporter of The Bluebirds, Cardiff City. He regularly turns out for The Bluebirds&#x27; charity teams, and played in both of the Legend Matches which marked the team&#x27;s last game at Ninian Park and first game at [[Cardiff City Stadium 
===Professional career===
Fox&#x27;s professional musical career began at age 15, when along with elder brother Dean he toured the South Wales working man&#x27;s clubs circuit, in various bands, He worked for twelve years as a singer on cruise ships and in pubs and clubs, both under his real name and the stage name Nick James. In 2000, he formed the boy band Force 5 with his friend [[Kevin Simm]]. They worked mainly on Blackpool&#x27;s [[Golden Mile (Blackpool)|Golden Mile]], before breaking up when Simm joined [[Liberty X]].

In 2003, he took part in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;[[Fame Academy 2|Fame Academy]]&quot; and took the stage name James Fox. He came fifth and subsequently appeared on the albums &quot;Fame Academy: Bee Gees Special&quot; (Polydor, August 2003) and &quot;Fame Academy – The Finalists&quot; (Polydor, October 2003). He also duetted on the co-written track, &quot;In Your Smile&quot; which appeared on winner [[Alistair Griffin]]&#x27;s début album [[Bring It On (Alistair Griffin album)|&quot;Bring It On&quot;]]

The following year, he [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004|represented the UK]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004]] with the song &quot;[[Hold Onto Our Love]]&quot;. It reached number 13 in the UK chart and finished 16th out of 24 finalists at the contest with 29 points. He later claimed that the voting had been biased.

Fox was invited by [[Wayne David]] MP to sing the UK&#x27;s Eurovision entry live at the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], and also to perform at the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office &#x27;Meet the Neighbours&#x27; Festival. He was also invited to sing live at the [[Welsh Assembly]] in Cardiff.

Fox has performed his original songs across the United Kingdom and the United States of America, including [[The Bedford]] at The [[Canal Room]] New York and The Regal Room in London, as well as in his home town.

He has supported a number of artists. These include [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Wet Wet Wet]], [[Natasha Bedingfield]], [[Clare Teal]], [[Honey Ryder (band)|Honey Ryder]], [[Will Young]] and [[Tina Turner]].

He has performed live for British troops on active service in [[Afghanistan]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[The Falkland Islands]] and [[Iraq]] many times, as well as undertaking a number of charity performances. He was invited to perform twice at the [[Royal British Legion]] [[Remembrance Day]] Festival at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], in the presence of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]].

In 2007 he released &quot;Six String&quot;, a six-track EP of original songs. He wrote &quot;[[Bluebirds Flying High]]&quot; which became the official [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] Football Club single for the [[2008 FA Cup Final]].

In 2008, &quot;Higher&quot; the lead single from Fox&#x27;s debut album &quot;Rocking Chairs And Lemonade&quot; was released on his own Plastic Tomato label. The single later became snooker ace [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]] entrance music from the [[2010 World Snooker Championship]] onwards. The album included the tracks from &quot;Six String&quot;, and five other original tunes. That same year he co-wrote and recorded several tracks with [[Lucie Silvas]] for inclusion on her third studio album.

On 24 October 2012, Fox launched his single &quot;Landlocked&quot; with a live performance, its profits going to The Royal British legion&#x27;s annual [[Poppy Appeal]]. He was joined on stage by [[Jon Green]] on rhythm guitar at the Poppy Appeal Launch gig in [[Trafalgar Square]].

===Musical theatre===
In 2004, Fox went on to play [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] in the [[Bill Kenwright]] touring production of &quot;[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]&quot; to good reviews. Consequently, [[Tim Rice]] recommended him for the lead role in the [[Billy Joel]]/[[Twyla Tharp]] musical &quot;[[Movin&#x27; Out (musical)|Movin&#x27; Out]]&quot; in America. Fox won the role, and made his début on Broadway on 6 April 2005. He later joined the North American touring production of &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot;.

In March 2006, Fox returned to the UK to take up the role of &quot;Piano Man&quot; in the European première of &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot; in [[West End theatre|The West End]] at the [[Apollo Victoria Theatre]]. [[Billy Joel]] said, via a live video link-up at the press launch at [[Ronnie Scott&#x27;s]] jazz club, &quot;I&#x27;m particularly pleased that the incredibly talented James Fox will be returning to home turf; he has been wowing audiences here, and he&#x27;s going to continue to do so there.&quot; Between October 2006 and January 2007, Fox rejoined the American tour of &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot;, taking time off to return to the UK for a series of gigs. After this, he returned to the UK on a permanent basis.

In July 2010, Fox took the role of Freddie &quot;The American&quot; Trumper in the 2010–2011 UK touring production of the Andersson/Rice/Ulveaus musical &quot;[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]&quot;, opening in Newcastle.

On 29 September 2012, Fox took over the shared role of [[Paul McCartney]] in [[The Beatles]] tribute show &quot;Let it Be&quot; at The Prince of Wales Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. The show opened to mixed reviews. In June 2013, Fox opened the Beatles themed tribute show &quot;Let It Be on Broadway&quot;. Fox was the poster boy, starting in the promotional video singing &quot;[[Let It Be (song)|Let It Be]]&quot; in the style of Paul McCartney, and on sides of a New York City greyhound bus. Like the West End production the show opened to mixed reviews and closed six weeks into its proposed four-month run. Fox returned to the West End production before quitting in October 2013 after 12 months in the role. Fox returned to &quot;Let it Be&quot; in the West End in 2014 until the run finished on 20 September 2014.

<doc id="658205" wikidata="Q1801578" url="?curid=658205" title="Laminectomy">
<text>A laminectomy is a surgical procedure that removes a portion of a vertebra called the lamina, which is the roof of the spinal canal. It is a major spine operation with residual scar tissue and may result in postlaminectomy syndrome. Depending on the problem, more conservative treatments (e.g., small endoscopic procedures, without bone removal) may be viable.

==Method==

The lamina is a posterior arch of the vertebral bone lying between the spinous process (which juts out in the middle) and the more lateral pedicles and the transverse processes of each vertebra. The pair of laminae, along with the spinous process, make up the posterior wall of the bony spinal canal. Although the literal meaning of laminectomy is &#x27;excision of the lamina&#x27;, a conventional laminectomy in neurosurgery and orthopedics involves excision of the supraspinous ligament and some or all of the spinous process. Removal of these structures with an open technique requires disconnecting the many muscles of the back attached to them. A laminectomy performed as a minimal spinal surgery procedure is a tissue-preserving surgery that leaves more of the muscle intact and spares the spinal process. Another procedure, called the laminotomy, is the removal of a mid-portion of one lamina and may be done either with a conventional open technique or in a minimalistic fashion with the use of tubular retractors and endoscopes.

The reason for lamina removal is rarely, if ever, because the lamina itself is diseased; rather, it is done to break the continuity of the rigid ring of the spinal canal to allow the soft tissues within the canal to: 1) expand (decompress); 2) change the contour of the vertebral column; or 3) permit access to deeper tissue inside the spinal canal. A laminectomy is also the name of a spinal operation that conventionally includes the removal of one or both lamina, as well as other posterior supporting structures of the vertebral column, including ligaments and additional bone. The actual bone removal may be carried out with a variety of surgical tools, including drills, rongeurs and lasers.

The success rate of a laminectomy depends on the specific reason for the operation, as well as proper patient selection and the surgeon&#x27;s technical ability. The first laminectomy was performed in 1887 by Victor Alexander Haden Horsley, a professor of surgery at University College London. A laminectomy can treat severe spinal stenosis by relieving pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots, provide access to a tumor or other mass lying in or around the spinal cord, or help in tailoring the contour of the vertebral column to correct a spinal deformity such as kyphosis. A common type of laminectomy is performed to permit the removal or reshaping of a spinal disc as part of a lumbar discectomy. This is a treatment for a herniated, bulging, or degenerated disc.

The recovery period after a laminectomy depends on the specific operative technique, with minimally invasive procedures having significantly shorter recovery periods than open surgery. Removal of substantial amounts of bone and tissue may require additional procedures such as spinal fusion to stabilize the spine and generally require a much longer recovery period than a simple laminectomy.

With spinal fusion, the recovery time may be longer. In some cases after laminectomy and spinal fusion, it may take several months to return to normal activities. Potential complications include bleeding, infection, blood clots, nerve injury, and spinal fluid leak.

==For spinal stenosis==
Most commonly, a laminectomy is performed to treat spinal stenosis. Spinal stenosis is the single most common diagnosis that leads to spinal surgery, of which a laminectomy represents one component. The lamina of the vertebra is removed or trimmed to widen the spinal canal and create more space for the spinal nerves and thecal sac. Surgical treatment that includes a laminectomy is the most effective remedy for severe spinal stenosis; however, most cases of spinal stenosis are not severe enough to require surgery. When the disabling symptoms of spinal stenosis are primarily neurogenic claudication and the laminectomy is done without spinal fusion, there is generally a more rapid recovery with less blood loss. However, if the spinal column is unstable and fusion is required, the recovery period can last from several months to more than a year, and the likelihood of symptom relief is far less probable.

==Results==
In most known cases of lumbar and thoracic laminectomies, patients tend to recover slowly, with recurring pain or spinal stenosis persisting for up to 18 months after the procedure. According to a World Health Organization census in 2001, most patients who had undergone a lumbar laminectomy recovered normal function within one year of their operation.

Back surgery can relieve pressure on the spine, but it is not a cure-all for spinal stenosis. There may be considerable pain immediately after the operation, and pain may persist on a longer-term basis. For some people, recovery can take weeks or months and may require long-term occupational and physical therapy. Surgery does not stop the degenerative process and symptoms may reappear within several years.

<doc id="658208" wikidata="Q5179194" url="?curid=658208" title="Cover date">
<text>The cover date of a periodical publication is the date displayed on the cover, which is not necessarily the true date of publication (the on-sale date or release date); later cover dates are common in magazine and comic book publishing. More unusually, &quot;Le Monde&quot; is a daily newspaper published the afternoon before its cover date. For some publications, the cover date may not be found on the cover, but rather on an inside jacket or on an interior page.

==Magazines==
In the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, the standard practice is to display on magazine covers a date which is some weeks or months in the future from the publishing or release date. There are two reasons for this discrepancy: first, to allow magazines to continue appearing &quot;current&quot; to consumers even after they have been on sale for some time (since not all magazines will be sold immediately), and second, to inform newsstands when an unsold magazine can be removed from the stands and returned to the publishing company or be destroyed (in this case, the cover date is also the pull date).

Weeklies (such as &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;) are generally dated a week ahead. Monthlies (such as &quot;National Geographic&quot;) are generally dated two to three months ahead, and quarterlies are generally dated half a month ahead.

In other countries, the cover date usually matches more closely the date of publication, and may indeed be identical where weekly magazines are concerned.

In all markets, it is rare for monthly magazines to indicate a particular day of the month: thus issues are dated &quot;May 2016&quot;, and so on, whereas weekly magazines may be dated &quot;17 May 2016&quot;.

==Comic books==
The general practice of most mainstream comic book companies since the creation of the comic book in the 1930s was to date individual issues by putting the name of a month (and much later the year as well) on the cover which was generally two months after the release date. For example, a 1951 issue of &quot;Superman&quot; which had the cover date of July would have been published two months earlier from that date in the month of May, generally speaking. In 1973 the discrepancy between the cover date and the publishing date went from two months to three months. In 1989 the cover date and publishing date discrepancy was changed back to two months, though generally each comic book company now uses its own system.

Of the two major American comic book publishers, DC Comics continues to put cover dates on the cover. Marvel Comics opted against putting cover dates on the cover in October 1999; instead, the &quot;cover&quot; date was moved to the indicia on an interior page.

<doc id="658215" wikidata="Q4898310" url="?curid=658215" title="Betsy McCaughey">
<text>Elizabeth Helen McCaughey (; born October 20, 1948 formerly known as Betsy McCaughey Ross), is an American politician who was the lieutenant governor of New York from 1995 to 1998, during the first term of Governor George Pataki. She unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party nomination for governor after Pataki dropped her from his 1998 ticket, and she ended up on the ballot under the Liberal Party line. In August 2016 the Donald Trump presidential campaign announced that she had joined the campaign as an economic adviser.

A historian by training, with a PhD from Columbia University, McCaughey has, over the years, provided conservative media commentary on US public policy affecting healthcare-related issues. Her 1993 attack on the Clinton healthcare plan was likely a major factor in the initially popular bill&#x27;s defeat in Congress. Also, it brought her to the attention of Republican Pataki, who chose her as his nominee/running mate. In 2009, her criticisms of the Affordable Care Act, then a bill being debated in Congress again gained significant media attention in television and radio interviews, and it may have specifically inspired the &quot;death panel&quot; claim about the act.

She has been a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute and Hudson Institute thinktanks and has written numerous articles and op-eds. She was a member of the boards of directors of medical equipment companies Genta (from 2001 to 2007) and Cantel Medical Corporation, but she resigned in 2009 to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest with her public advocacy against the Affordable Care Act.

From 1995 until their divorce in 2000, she was married to business magnate Wilbur Ross, who went on to serve as Secretary of Commerce in Donald Trump&#x27;s first term cabinet.

==Early life, education, and family==
McCaughey and her twin brother, William, were born in Pittsburgh to Ramona Peterken, and her husband Albert, a factory janitor. The family moved around the Northeastern United States for six years before it settled down in Westport, Connecticut, where McCaughey&#x27;s father did maintenance and later engineering work at a nail clipper factory. McCaughey recalled her parents&#x27; difficulty in affording medical treatment: &quot;my brother was a serious asthmatic as a child. I remember my parents sitting at the kitchen table wondering if they could afford to take [him] to the hospital.&quot;

McCaughey attended public schools in Westport through the 10th grade, spending much of her free time at the library. After receiving a scholarship, she transferred to a private Massachusetts boarding school, the Mary A. Burnham School, for her last two years of high school, rarely visiting home, then or during her college years.

She received a scholarship to attend Vassar College, where she majored in history. She wrote her senior thesis on Karl Marx and Alexis de Tocqueville, won several fellowships, and received her AB, with distinction, in 1970. McCaughey went on to graduate school at Columbia University in New York City, earning her MA in 1972 and her PhD in constitutional history in 1976.

She won Columbia&#x27;s Bancroft Dissertation Award in American History in 1976 and her dissertation was published by the prestigious Columbia University Press in 1980, &quot;From Loyalist to Founding Father: The Political Odyssey of William Samuel Johnson&quot;.

She also contributed a chapter about Johnson to the 1979 book &quot;The American Revolution: Changing Perspectives&quot; by William M. Fowler and Wallace Coyle.

While completing her PhD, McCaughey trained in the corporate banking department at Chase Manhattan Bank, and she served as a loan officer in the Food, Beverage, and Tobacco Division. She also took courses in accounting at Columbia&#x27;s School of Business.

McCaughey&#x27;s father died in 1970 at the age of 60. Her mother, an alcoholic, died the next year of liver disease at the age of 42. In 1972, she married Thomas K. McCaughey, a Yale College graduate she had met in college. He was then moving up as an investment banker. The McCaugheys separated in 1992 and divorced in 1994, with McCaughey and her ex-spouse sharing joint custody of their three daughters. In January 1993, she filed an affidavit in her divorce proceeding in which she said she had no annual earnings from employment during most of the 18 years of her marriage to Thomas, and she had never earned more than $20,000 per year except in 1990, when she &quot;sold an idea to Fox television for a windfall once-in-a-lifetime sum of $75,000&quot;.

She married wealthy investment banker Wilbur Ross Jr. in December 1995. He filed for divorce in November 1998.

==Academic work, 1977–1988==
McCaughey taught history as a visiting assistant professor at Vassar College in 1977–1978 and was a lecturer in 1979–1980. She was an assistant professor between 1981 and 1983, teaching two classes per year, both at Columbia University Between 1983 and 1984, she had a National Endowment for the Humanities postdoctoral fellowship. From 1986 to 1988, she served as a guest curator at the New-York Historical Society and was responsible for the museum&#x27;s exhibit commemorating the bicentennial of the US Constitution. She also authored a book, &quot;Government by Choice: Inventing the United States Constitution&quot;, which cataloged the exhibit.

==Policy positions and scholarship, 1989–1993==
In the late 1980s, McCaughey briefly considered a career in TV news, but she opted instead for a position as a senior scholar at the Center for the Study of the Presidency, serving from 1989 to 1992. There, she wrote an article, book reviews, and a guest editorial for its journal, &quot;Presidential Studies Quarterly (PSQ)&quot;, and an op-ed in &quot;USA Today&quot; advocating reform of the Electoral College method of electing the president. She testified at a July 22, 1992, hearing before the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and helped produce a report suggesting constitutional amendments to fix perceived flaws in the Electoral College.

McCaughey also wrote op-ed columns that appeared in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;USA Today&quot; in which she opposed plans involving local and state redistricting to comply with the Voting Rights Act, and she criticized federal court-ordered desegregation of schools in Connecticut and New Jersey. She also supported the nomination of a federal judge, Clarence Thomas to the United States Supreme Court by arguing that he would judge cases there on their merits and not tend to interpret cases in a manner consistent with his conservative beliefs; She also supported a tobacco company in litigation before the Supreme Court and praised the 1992 &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; Supreme Court decision, restricting abortion rights.

In February 1993, the John M. Olin Foundation funded a fellowship at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, for McCaughey to write a book on race and the legal system to be titled &quot;Beyond Pluralism: Overcoming the Narcissism of Minor Differences&quot;. McCaughey wrote op-eds over the next six months in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot; in which she supported the 1993 selection of a jury from predominately-white, Republican, rural counties for the urban (Memphis)-located retrial of African American and Democratic US Representative Harold Ford, Sr., and praised the 1993 &quot;Shaw v. Reno&quot; Supreme Court decision, favoring five white voters who said their rights had been infringed upon by redistricting that had been done to comply with the Voting Rights Act.

==Healthcare reform, 1993–1994==
On September 22, 1993, US President Bill Clinton delivered a nationally televised speech about his healthcare reform plan to a joint session of Congress. From September 28 to 30, 1993, First Lady Hillary Clinton, the architect of the universal health care plan, testified about its details before five US congressional committees. The cost of providing insurance for the estimated 37 million people then uninsured was to be covered in part by new taxes on tobacco. On the last day of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s testimony, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published an op-ed by McCaughey, who wrote that the 239-page draft legislation differed markedly from the White House&#x27;s public statements and would have &quot;devastating consequences&quot;. Citing words and phrases from the draft, she argued that the 77 percent of Americans then covered by insurance would see a downgrade in their policies, and most would not be able to keep their own physicians but be forced into price-controlled health maintenance organizations (HMOs), which would provide only the most basic care. According to McCaughey, the HMO plans would not pay for visits to specialists or for second opinions, and most physicians would be driven out of private practice.

In late November 1993, the bill for the Clinton health care plan of 1993 was introduced in the Congress and made publicly available. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; then published an op-ed by McCaughey in which said she had pored over the entire bill and concluded that it had price controls that would cause rationing, and the bill was dangerous.

McCaughey expanded her op-eds into a five-page article titled &quot;No Exit&quot;, which appeared as the cover story in &quot;The New Republic&quot; and was published a few days before President Clinton&#x27;s 1994 State of the Union address. An internal memo by tobacco company Philip Morris, dated March 1994, indicated that representatives of Philip Morris had collaborated with McCaughey when she was writing &quot;No Exit&quot;: &quot;Worked off-the-record with Manhattan and writer Betsy McCaughey as part of the input to the three-part exposé in The New Republic on what the Clinton plan means to you. The first part detailed specifics of the plan.&quot; (When the memo was discussed in a 2009 story in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, McCaughey declined to comment.)

McCaughey&#x27;s &quot;No Exit&quot; article was quickly used by conservative officials and commentators seeking to discredit the Clinton plan. Senator Bob Dole, in the Republican Party response to the President&#x27;s State of the Union, used some of McCaughey&#x27;s arguments of fewer choices, lower quality, and more government control. Bill Kristol&#x27;s Project for the Republican Future quickly launched television advertisements featuring quotes from McCaughey&#x27;s two &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; op-ed columns and her &quot;The New Republic&quot; article. &quot;Newsweek&quot; columnist George Will used McCaughey&#x27;s writings as a basis for predicting that the Clinton health plan would kill patients and make it illegal for patients to pay doctors directly for care, with 15-year jail terms for patients who tried to do so.

The Clinton White House press office issued a response to McCaughey&#x27;s &quot;No Exit&quot; article by arguing that it contained &quot;numerous factual inaccuracies and misleading statements&quot;. McCaughey responded that her claims came &quot;straight from the text of the bill&quot;. Supporters of the Clinton plan questioned McCaughey&#x27;s claims, including her statements that &quot;the law will prevent you from going outside the system to buy basic health coverage you think is better&quot; and that &quot;doctor[s] can be paid only by the plan, not by you&quot; by pointing to the text of the legislation such as Section 1003: &quot;Nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting ... An individual from purchasing any health care services.&quot;

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;No Exit&quot; article, the White House response, and the ensuing television and radio interviews with McCaughey made her a star: &quot;Her toothy good looks, body-conscious suits, Vassar BA and Columbia PhD reduced right-wingers to mush.&quot;

The bill stalled and died in Congress in 1994, and the next year, Clinton was reduced to asking Congress for a series of small, incremental reforms to healthcare. The &quot;No Exit&quot; article won the National Magazine Award for excellence in the public interest. Andrew Sullivan, the editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, later stated that he believed there were flaws in McCaughey&#x27;s article, but he ran it &quot;as a provocation to debate&quot;. In 2006, a new editor recanted the story.

In 2009, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; called her &quot;The Woman Who Killed Health Care&quot;.

==New York Lieutenant Governorship, 1995–1998==
Following the national attention McCaughey received in the 1990s healthcare legislation debate, Pataki, a first-term New York state senator who was running for governor, chose her as his running mate. Despite McCaughey&#x27;s complete lack of experience as a political candidate or officeholder and the fact that Pataki did not personally know McCaughey, Pataki perceived that she was very popular among conservatives, who, at the time, were still suspicious of him and that her public image would make his longshot candidacy more appealing to independent and female voters. Regarding her status as a political rookie, McCaughey said, &quot;Many New Yorkers see that as a plus.&quot;

McCaughey said that she accepted the nomination by believing she would be Pataki&#x27;s &quot;point person on health policy&quot;. After winning the election, Pataki told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, McCaughey would have &quot;very real and significant responsibilities&quot; as lieutenant governor. McCaughey was initially tasked by Pataki to work on education policy and on reducing New York&#x27;s Medicaid budget. By January 1995, McCaughey had produced a set of recommendations that required cost cutting by hospitals and nursing homes so that the poor did not have to bear the entire burden of balancing the state&#x27;s Medicaid budget by a reduction of their benefits. However, McCaughey&#x27;s recommendations were largely ignored.

After Pataki refused to give McCaughey permission to conduct a study into child abuse, she did one anyway and publicly announced its results. McCaughey was publicly critical of the governor&#x27;s proposed cuts to Medicaid and gave a pro-choice speech without his advance permission. In March 1996, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that McCaughey was locked out of the governor&#x27;s inner circle because she had violated the &quot;unwritten rules&quot; of the conventional lieutenant governor&#x27;s role. Rather than following protocol as lieutenant governor by taking a seat with everyone else during Pataki&#x27;s State of the State address to the legislature in 1996, McCaughey stood for the entire 56 min speech&#x27;s length, further attracting attention to herself at her governor&#x27;s expense. In the spring of 1997, Governor Pataki announced that McCaughey would not be his running mate when he ran for re-election in 1998. He later selected New York State Supreme Court Justice Mary Donohue to replace her.

Though she had always voted Republican in presidential elections and taken conservative Republican policy positions, McCaughey suddenly switched her party affiliation to Democrat and soon announced plans to run for governor against Pataki. McCaughey was the early frontrunner for her new party&#x27;s nomination process, in part because of her statewide name and face recognition and in part because of the financial support of her wealthy then-husband. During her campaign for governor, she was criticized for firing a succession of campaign aides and political advisers and possibly changing her core political beliefs in order to appear more electable to New York voters. As her opinion poll numbers sank, her husband took away more than half of the funds he had pledged to her campaign.

McCaughey was defeated in the Democratic primary election by New York City Councilman Peter Vallone (who then lost the general election to Pataki, 54 percent to 33 percent). McCaughey had earlier received the nomination of the Liberal Party of New York for governor and stayed in the general election. McCaughey&#x27;s campaign attracted little support, and she received only 1.65 percent of the general vote for governor. Following the election, she divorced and then sued her former husband alleging &quot;$40 million fraud&quot;, claiming that he promised to fund her campaign unconditionally.

==Life and career since leaving office==

McCaughey has worked on patient advocacy and healthcare policy issues since leaving office in 1999. She was senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute beginning in 1999 and an adjunct senior fellow beginning in 2002. She was a member of the board of directors of Genta, a company focused on the delivery of innovative products for cancer treatment from 2001 to her resignation in October 2007. She was also a member of the board of directors of the Cantel Medical Corporation, a medical device manufacturer, from 2005 to her resignation in August 2009 to avoid the appearance a conflict of interest while she was engaged in advocacy on healthcare reform legislation.

In 2004, she founded the committee to Reduce Infection Deaths (RID) in reaction to a rise in antibiotic resistant staphylococcus aureus and other hospital-borne infections. The non-profit RID is &quot;devoted solely to providing safer, cleaner, hospital care&quot;. She remains the chair and representative of the organization. She has appeared on &quot;Fox News&quot;, &quot;CNN&quot;, and many radio shows to discuss her research and how to prevent infection deaths. Her organization&#x27;s efforts have led to legislation in more than 25 states requiring hospitals to report infections.

==Healthcare reform, 2007–2009==

===American Cancer Society===
In August 2007, the American Cancer Society dedicated $15 million to a public awareness campaign on inadequate access to healthcare for the 47 million Americans not covered by insurance. It claimed that there would be a greater decline in cancer deaths if more cases of cancer were diagnosed in the early stages. The society noted that studies had shown that patients without insurance were more than twice as likely to have their cancer diagnosed in the late stages of the disease. One of the cancer society&#x27;s commercials stated, &quot;We&#x27;re making progress, but it&#x27;s not enough if people don&#x27;t have access to the care that could save their lives.&quot;

McCaughey criticized the campaign, saying that it should instead refocus on educating people about cancer prevention and detection. She argued that evidence had shown that the US had higher rates of cancer survival than countries with universal healthcare coverage because of shorter wait times for treatment, better availability of new drugs for therapy, and more frequent cancer screenings. She expanded her argument into a &quot;Brief Analysis&quot; published the following month by the National Center for Policy Analysis in which she maintained that the US was number one in the world in cancer care. Sources for her analysis included a paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research, a non profit, non partisan research organization, and an article in the British medical journal &quot;Lancet Oncology&quot;, which analyzed 2000–2002 cancer survival figures from Europe. The American Cancer Society responded by citing a study of nearly 600,000 cancer cases that concluded that compared to people with private insurance, uninsured patients in the US were 1.6 times more likely to die within five years of their diagnosis.

===2009 stimulus bill===
McCaughey published an op-ed on February 9, 2009, and claimed that the Obama administration&#x27;s pending American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 stimulus contained the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, hidden provisions that would harm the health of Americans as well as the healthcare sector of the economy. She argued that the bill would establish two powerful new bureaucracies: the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research.

McCaughey said the National Coordinator would monitor patients&#x27; electronic medical records to ensure that doctors and hospitals treated patients in a way that &quot;the federal government deems appropriate and cost effective&quot; and that doctors and hospitals deviating from the government&#x27;s &quot;electronically delivered protocols&quot; would be penalized. She said that the Federal Coordinating Council would be composed of appointed bureaucrats charged with a costcutting agenda that would slow the development of new medical products and drugs and ration healthcare for senior citizens. She opined that the bureaucrats would use a comparative effectiveness formula, which, in the United Kingdom, had resulted in a requirement that senior citizens go blind in one eye before the government would pay for a treatment to save the sight in the other eye.

Critics claimed McCaughey&#x27;s claims were distorted, pointing out that the National Coordinator was not new but had been created five years earlier by George W. Bush and that the 2009 legislation was not about limiting doctors&#x27; ability to prescribe treatments but instead establishing a system of electronic records to give physicians complete and accurate information their patients.

FactCheck.org noted that comparative effectiveness research had been funded by the US government for years but agreed with McCaughey that there would be penalties for health providers that did not use the electronic records system. The effectiveness research council was a new initiative, as McCaughey had said. However, supporters of the stimulus bill provision said that research funded would provide additional evidence to guide treatment decisions and save lives and money by avoiding unnecessary, ineffective, or risky treatments.

McCaughey&#x27;s viewpoint was soon echoed and extended by conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh and multiple Fox News Channel broadcasters. Republican US Representative Charles Boustany Jr. of Louisiana, a heart surgeon, added that he feared that comparative effectiveness research would be misused by federal bureaucrats to &quot;ration care, to deny life-saving treatment to seniors and disabled people&quot;. Other conservatives agreed that the legislation could put the federal government in the middle of the doctor-patient relationship. The stimulus bill was passed with the healthcare-related provisions still included. McCaughey urged their repeal so that their potential impact could be studied further.

===2009 healthcare reform bills===
McCaughey opposed the America&#x27;s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 debated in Congress in 2009. She made allegations about certain provisions of the bills that provided for Medicare payments to physicians for end-of-life and living will counseling and about Ezekiel Emanuel, then an adviser to the Obama administration&#x27;s budget director and chairman of the bioethics department at the National Institutes of Health. McCaughey&#x27;s claims may have inspired Sarah Palin&#x27;s more high-profile claims that the legislation would lead to so-called death panels. The provisions in the legislation that McCaughey advocated against were removed from the bill before it became law.

In July 2009, McCaughey claimed that a section in the pending healthcare legislation, &quot;Advance Care Planning Consultation&quot;, actually prescribed &quot;euthanasia for the elderly&quot; because it included provisions thatwould make it mandatory—absolutely require—that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner [and inform them how to] decline nutrition, how to decline being hydrated, how to go in to hospice care ... all to do what&#x27;s in society&#x27;s best interest or in your family&#x27;s best interest and cut your life short.McCaughey&#x27;s choice of words and analysis were described by &quot;The Atlantic&quot; James Fallows as inaccurate and sensationalistic. Politifact responded that the end-of-life counseling was voluntary, calling McCaughey&#x27;s claim a &quot;ridiculous falsehood&quot; and giving it their lowest accuracy rating, &quot;pants on fire&quot;. Factcheck.org called the claims &quot;nonsense&quot; and stated that what that section of the bill would actually do is &quot;require Medicare to pay for voluntary counseling sessions helping seniors to plan for end-of-life medical care, including designating a health care proxy, choosing a hospice and making decisions about life-sustaining treatment.&quot; During an appearance on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; which aired on August 20, 2009, McCaughey repeated these assertions about the counselling sessions and referred to the Factcheck.org as &quot;spot-check dot org&quot;, claiming they failed to adequately read the House health care bill. In a rebuttal, Factcheck.org stood by their analysis and provided further analysis, which led them to conclude that McCaughey had misinterpreted the bill.

In August 2009, WNYC&#x27;s &quot;On the Media&quot; also addressed McCaughey&#x27;s claims, concluding that the provision actually mandated that the federal government compensate &quot;counseling sessions&quot; on elder law, such as estate planning, &quot;will writing and hospice care&quot;.

McCaughey described Emanuel in a &quot;New York Post&quot; opinion article as a &quot;Deadly Doctor&quot; who advocated healthcare rationing by age and disability. Factcheck.org said this was incorrect and that &quot;Emanuel&#x27;s meaning is being twisted ... he was talking about a philosophical trend, and ... writing about how to make the most ethical choices when forced to choose which patients get organ transplants or vaccines when supplies are limited.&quot; An article in &quot;Time&quot; magazine said that Emanuel &quot;was only addressing extreme cases like organ donation, where there is an absolute scarcity of resources&quot;, and quoted Emanuel as saying: &quot;My quotes were just being taken out of context.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that Emanuel had opposed the legalization of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide when such proposals were being debated in the late 1990s.

McCaughey resigned from the Board of Cantel Medical Corporation on August 20, 2009 &quot;to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest during the national debate over healthcare reform&quot;, according to a press release by the company. Other reports claimed that she resigned after negative reactions to her performance on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; one day earlier.

In an appearance on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Morning Meeting&quot; on October 6, 2009, McCaughey advocated gradually extending the minimum age for Medicare coverage upward from 65 to 70 in order to keep the Medicare system solvent.

In an August 7, 2012, opinion piece in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, McCaughey described as &quot;phony&quot; an assertion that repealing the Affordable Care Act would increase federal deficits.

In a September 15, 2013, opinion piece in the &quot;New York Post&quot; entitled &quot;Obamacare will question your sex life&quot;, McCaughey wrote: &quot;Are you sexually active? If so, with one partner, multiple partners or same-sex partners?&quot; Be ready to answer those questions and more the next time you go to the doctor, whether it&#x27;s the dermatologist or the cardiologist and no matter if the questions are unrelated to why you&#x27;re seeking medical help. And you can thank the Obama health law.
Politifact rated this assertion as &quot;Pants on Fire&quot;, and FactCheck.org also called it false.

In an October 25, 2013, appearance on Fox News, McCaughey said that the Affordable Care Act would have the effect of &quot;eviscerating Medicare&quot;.

On her Twitter feed and on television, McCaughey stated that members of Congress and other government employees were granted a &quot;special subsidy&quot; and a &quot;premium illegally arranged by Obama&quot; under the Affordable Care Act. Factcheck.org, Politifact, and fact checkers at CNN all found that assertion to be false.

<text>Mount Wellington is a suburb in East Auckland, New Zealand, located southeast of the city centre. It is surrounded by the suburbs of Stonefields, Tamaki, Panmure, Penrose, and Ellerslie, and by the Tāmaki River. The suburb is named after the volcanic peak of Maungarei / Mount Wellington. Sylvia Park is a large business park and shopping centre located in the suburb.

==Geography==

Maungarei / Mount Wellington is a volcanic peak of the Auckland volcanic field. It is the youngest onshore volcano of the Auckland volcanic field, having been formed by an eruption around 10,000 years ago. It is the largest of Auckland&#x27;s scoria cones. Prior to European settlement, the area around Maungarei was bracken scrub and not densely forested. The southern section, closer to Ōtāhuhu / Mount Richmond, was primarily broadleaf and podocarp forest with patches of clear scrubland.

==History==

The isthmus south of the mountain was traditionally settled by Ngāi Tāhuhu, descendants of Tāhuhunui-o-te-rangi, captain of the Moekākara waka and namesake of Ōtāhuhu. Four archaeological sites near Carbine Road/Panama Road near the Tāmaki River were occupied in the mid to late 1500s. A large number of storage pits for root vegetables (such as kūmara) were found at the sites, suggesting the area was extensively gardened by Māori, as well as an area where toki (adze) were created. South of Mutukaroa / Hamlins Hill was Karetu, a 2 km portage between the Waitematā Harbour/Tāmaki River and the Manukau Harbour.
Mount Wellington had historically supplied most of Auckland&#x27;s vegetables alongside Tāmaki until the 1940s when that land was turned into an industrial estate.

==Demographics==
Mount Wellington covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

While most of the suburb is residential, Sylvia Park is almost entirely commercial, and the central area of Mount Wellington Industrial is almost entirely industrial.
Mount Wellington had a population of 26,280 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 1,047 people (4.1%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 2,985 people (12.8%) since the 2013 census. There were 13,215 males, 12,966 females and 99 people of other genders in 8,553 dwellings. 3.8% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 34.0 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 4,785 people (18.2%) aged under 15 years, 6,012 (22.9%) aged 15 to 29, 12,321 (46.9%) aged 30 to 64, and 3,165 (12.0%) aged 65 or older.

The results were 35.5% European (Pākehā); 12.8% Māori; 24.3% Pasifika; 38.7% Asian; 2.6% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 1.4% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 90.8%, Māori language by 2.4%, Samoan by 4.7%, and other languages by 34.5%. No language could be spoken by 2.9% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.4%. The percentage of people born overseas was 48.1, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Religious affiliations were 42.1% Christian, 7.1% Hindu, 2.9% Islam, 1.0% Māori religious beliefs, 3.4% Buddhist, 0.3% New Age, 0.2% Jewish, and 2.1% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 35.4%, and 5.8% of people did not answer the census question.

Of those at least 15 years old, 6,441 (30.0%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 8,643 (40.2%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 6,405 (29.8%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. The median income was $45,800, compared with $41,500 nationally. 2,259 people (10.5%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 12,264 (57.1%) people were employed full-time, 2,034 (9.5%) were part-time, and 696 (3.2%) were unemployed.

<text>Humo (stylized in all caps) is a popular Dutch-language Belgian weekly radio and television magazine.

==History and profile==
&quot;Humoradio&quot; (meaning a portmanteau of &#x27;humor&#x27; and &#x27;radio&#x27; in English) was first published in 1936 as a Dutch-language counterpart to &quot;Le Moustique&quot;, now &quot;Télémoustique&quot;. During World War II between 1940 and 1944, &quot;Humoradio&quot; was not published. In 1958, when television started to reach a larger audience in the country, the magazine was renamed as &quot;Humo&quot;. The magazine is published on a weekly basis.

&quot;Humo&quot; as it is recognized today started emerging from 1969 on, when Guy Mortier became its chief editor. He gave the magazine its playful comedic tone, put more emphasis on articles about rock music and shaped it into a magazine that appealed to a left-wing, progressive audience. During Mortier&#x27;s term many classic columns, interview series, annual cultural events and comic strips that are still considered to be part of &quot;Humo&quot; today saw the day of light. Among those is the annual &quot;Humo&#x27;s Pop Poll&quot;, organized since 1967, which lets readers elect their favorite people, radio shows, TV shows, music groups... of the year. Another recurring event is Humo&#x27;s Rock Rally, an important Belgian contest for young rock bands. Humo also sponsors the Rock Werchter festival since its conception in 1977. In 2003, Mortier retired.

&quot;Humo&quot;″s home cartoonist is Kamagurka, whose style influenced the overall cult appeal of the magazine. The magazine&#x27;s mascots, Bert and Cowboy Henk, are creations by him, both featured in weekly comics series.

The owner of &quot;Humo&quot; was Sanoma and was published by Sanoma magazines. In May 2015 the magazine was acquired by De Persgroep.

==Circulation==
Since 2002, &quot;Humo&quot; has had a declining circulation rate. During the period of 2006–2007, the circulation of the magazine was 278,000 copies. The magazine sold 320,000 copies on 23 September 2008 when it offered a free copy of &quot;Goddamned Days on a Goddamned Planet&quot;, an unpublished new novel of Flemish author Dimitri Verhulst. During the first quarter of 2009, the circulation of the magazine was 256,558 copies. The magazine had a circulation of 215,409 copies in 2010 and 197,105 copies in 2011. It was 166,732 copies in 2012. The 2013 circulation of the magazine was 150,232 copies.

<doc id="658223" wikidata="Q788172" url="?curid=658223" title="Autonomic computing">
<text>Autonomic computing (AC) is distributed computing resources with self-managing characteristics, adapting to unpredictable changes while hiding intrinsic complexity to operators and users. Initiated by IBM in 2001, this initiative ultimately aimed to develop computer systems capable of self-management, to overcome the rapidly growing complexity of computing systems management, and to reduce the barrier that complexity poses to further growth.

==Description==
The AC system concept is designed to make adaptive decisions, using high-level policies. It will constantly check and optimize its status and automatically adapt itself to changing conditions. An autonomic computing framework is composed of autonomic components (AC) interacting with each other. An AC can be modeled in terms of two main control schemes (local and global) with sensors (for self-monitoring), effectors (for self-adjustment), knowledge and planner/adapter for exploiting policies based on self- and environment awareness. This architecture is sometimes referred to as Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute (MAPE).

Driven by such vision, a variety of architectural frameworks based on &quot;self-regulating&quot; autonomic components has been recently proposed. A very similar trend has recently characterized significant research in the area of multi-agent systems. However, most of these approaches are typically conceived with centralized or cluster-based server architectures in mind and mostly address the need of reducing management costs rather than the need of enabling complex software systems or providing innovative services. Some autonomic systems involve mobile agents interacting via loosely coupled communication mechanisms.

&quot;Autonomy-oriented computation&quot; is a paradigm proposed by Jiming Liu in 2001 that uses artificial systems imitating social animals&#x27; collective behaviours to solve difficult computational problems. For example, ant colony optimization could be studied in this paradigm.

==Problem of growing complexity==
Forecasts suggested that the computing devices in use would grow at 38% per year and the average complexity of each device was increasing. This volume and complexity was managed by highly skilled humans; but the demand for skilled IT personnel was already outstripping supply, with labour costs exceeding equipment costs by a ratio of up to 18:1. Computing systems have brought great benefits of speed and automation but there is now an overwhelming economic need to automate their maintenance.

In a 2003 IEEE &quot;Computer&quot; article, Kephart and Chess
warn that the dream of interconnectivity of computing systems and devices could become the &quot;nightmare of pervasive computing&quot; in which architects are unable to anticipate, design and maintain the complexity of interactions. They state the essence of autonomic computing is system self-management, freeing administrators from low-level task management while delivering better system behavior.

A general problem of modern distributed computing systems is that their complexity, and in particular the complexity of their management, is becoming a significant limiting factor in their further development. Large companies and institutions are employing large-scale computer networks for communication and computation. The distributed applications running on these computer networks are diverse and deal with many tasks, ranging from internal control processes to presenting web content to customer support.

Additionally, mobile computing is pervading these networks at an increasing speed: employees need to communicate with their companies while they are not in their office. They do so by using laptops, personal digital assistants, or mobile phones with diverse forms of wireless technologies to access their companies&#x27; data.

This creates an enormous complexity in the overall computer network which is hard to control manually by human operators. Manual control is time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. The manual effort needed to control a growing networked computer-system tends to increase very quickly.

80% of such problems in infrastructure happen at the client specific application and database layer. Most &#x27;autonomic&#x27; service providers guarantee only up to the basic plumbing layer (power, hardware, operating system, network and basic database parameters).

==Characteristics of autonomic systems==
A possible solution could be to enable modern, networked computing systems to manage themselves without direct human intervention. The &quot;Autonomic Computing Initiative&quot; (ACI) aims at providing the foundation for autonomic systems. It is inspired by the autonomic nervous system of the human body. This nervous system controls important bodily functions (e.g. respiration, heart rate, and blood pressure) without any conscious intervention.

In a self-managing autonomic system, the human operator takes on a new role: instead of controlling the system directly, he/she defines general policies and rules that guide the self-management process. For this process, IBM defined the following four types of property referred to as self-star (also called self-*, self-x, or auto-*) properties. 
# Self-configuration: Automatic configuration of components;
# Self-healing: Automatic discovery, and correction of faults;
# Self-optimization: Automatic monitoring and control of resources to ensure the optimal functioning with respect to the defined requirements;
# Self-protection: Proactive identification and protection from arbitrary attacks.

Others such as Poslad and Nami and Sharifi have expanded on the set of self-star as follows:
# Self-regulation: A system that operates to maintain some parameter, e.g., Quality of service, within a reset range without external control;
# Self-learning: Systems use machine learning techniques such as unsupervised learning which does not require external control;
# Self-awareness (also called Self-inspection and Self-decision): System must know itself. It must know the extent of its own resources and the resources it links to. A system must be aware of its internal components and external links in order to control and manage them;
# Self-organization: System structure driven by physics-type models without explicit pressure or involvement from outside the system;
# Self-creation (also called Self-assembly, Self-replication): System driven by ecological and social type models without explicit pressure or involvement from outside the system. A system&#x27;s members are self-motivated and self-driven, generating complexity and order in a creative response to a continuously changing strategic demand;
# Self-management (also called self-governance): A system that manages itself without external intervention. What is being managed can vary dependent on the system and application. Self -management also refers to a set of self-star processes such as autonomic computing rather than a single self-star process;
# Self-description (also called self-explanation or Self-representation): A system explains itself. It is capable of being understood (by humans) without further explanation. 

IBM has set forth eight conditions that define an autonomic system:

The system must
# know itself in terms of what resources it has access to, what its capabilities and limitations are and how and why it is connected to other systems;
# be able to automatically configure and reconfigure itself depending on the changing computing environment;
# be able to optimize its performance to ensure the most efficient computing process;
# be able to work around encountered problems by either repairing itself or routing functions away from the trouble;
# detect, identify and protect itself against various types of attacks to maintain overall system security and integrity;
# adapt to its environment as it changes, interacting with neighboring systems and establishing communication protocols;
# rely on open standards and cannot exist in a proprietary environment;
# anticipate the demand on its resources while staying transparent to users.

Even though the purpose and thus the behaviour of autonomic systems vary from system to system, every autonomic system should be able to exhibit a minimum set of properties to achieve its purpose:

# Automatic: This essentially means being able to self-control its internal functions and operations. As such, an autonomic system must be self-contained and able to start-up and operate without any manual intervention or external help. Again, the knowledge required to bootstrap the system (&quot;Know-how&quot;) must be inherent to the system.
# Adaptive: An autonomic system must be able to change its operation (i.e., its configuration, state and functions). This will allow the system to cope with temporal and spatial changes in its operational context either long term (environment customisation/optimisation) or short term (exceptional conditions such as malicious attacks, faults, etc.).
# Aware: An autonomic system must be able to monitor (sense) its operational context as well as its internal state in order to be able to assess if its current operation serves its purpose. Awareness will control adaptation of its operational behaviour in response to context or state changes.

==Evolutionary levels==
IBM defined five evolutionary levels, or the &quot;autonomic deployment model&quot;, for the deployment of autonomic systems:
* Level 1 is the basic level that presents the current situation where systems are essentially managed manually.
* Levels 2–4 introduce increasingly automated management functions, while
* level 5 represents the ultimate goal of autonomic, self-managing systems.

==Design patterns==
The design complexity of Autonomic Systems can be simplified by utilizing design patterns such as the model–view–controller (MVC) pattern to improve concern separation by encapsulating functional concerns.

==Control loops==
A basic concept that will be applied in Autonomic Systems are closed control loops. This well-known concept stems from Process Control Theory. Essentially, a closed control loop in a self-managing system monitors some resource (software or hardware component) and autonomously tries to keep its parameters within a desired range.

According to IBM, hundreds or even thousands of these control loops are expected to work in a large-scale self-managing computer system.

==Conceptual model==

A fundamental building block of an autonomic system is the sensing capability (&quot;Sensors Si&quot;), which enables the system to observe its external operational context. Inherent to an autonomic system is the knowledge of the &quot;Purpose&quot; (intention) and the &quot;Know-how&quot; to operate itself (e.g., bootstrapping, configuration knowledge, interpretation of sensory data, etc.) without external intervention. The actual operation of the autonomic system is dictated by the &quot;Logic&quot;, which is responsible for making the right decisions to serve its &quot;Purpose&quot;, and influence by the observation of the operational context (based on the sensor input).

This model highlights the fact that the operation of an autonomic system is purpose-driven. This includes its mission (e.g., the service it is supposed to offer), the policies (e.g., that define the basic behaviour), and the &quot;survival instinct&quot;. If seen as a control system this would be encoded as a feedback error function or in a heuristically assisted system as an algorithm combined with set of heuristics bounding its operational space.

<doc id="658241" wikidata="Q318357" url="?curid=658241" title="Abel Tasman National Park">
<text>Abel Tasman National Park is a national park at the north end of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It covers of land between Golden Bay / Mohua and Tasman Bay / Te Tai-o-Aorere, making it the smallest of New Zealand&#x27;s national parks. Despite this, the park is one of the most visited, partially due to the popularity of the Abel Tasman Coast Track which spans along the eastern and northern coastal areas of the park. 

The area of the park has seen human interaction for approximately 700 years, with evidence of habitation dating back to early Māori iwi such as Waitaha and Rapuwai during the early periods of Māori habitation in New Zealand. Following the arrival of Pākehā in the 19th century, the area saw widespread deforestation, farming, and quarrying, significantly modifying the area&#x27;s environment. As a result of this, the park is one of the most modified landscapes of any of New Zealand&#x27;s national parks, with management of the park largely focusing on regeneration and restoration of the traditional ecosystem. 

The park was first established in 1942 to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Abel Tasman&#x27;s 1642 visit in New Zealand, when he became the first European to sight the islands. It has since been progressively expanded from its original borders, the most recent of which involved the addition of in Awaroa Inlet after a successful crowdfunding campaign.

==History==
The coastal area was inhabited for hundreds of years by Māori prior to the arrival of Europeans, with sites throughout the area occupied both seasonally and permanently. In addition to harvesting food from the local forests, estuaries and waters, locals grew kūmara.

Historical records indicate a pā was established at Auckland Point by Pohea, who travelled there around 1450 from the Whanganui area. From the mid-1500s Muaūpoko (formerly known as Ngāi Tara) occupied the area until the early 1600s, when they were ousted by Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri. Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri were present when Abel Tasman reached Golden Bay / Mohua in 1642.

=== Park establishment ===
The park was founded in 1942, largely through the efforts of ornithologist and author Pérrine Moncrieff to have land reserved for the purpose. Moncrieff served on the park board from 1943 to 1974.

The park was opened on 18 December 1942 to mark the 300th anniversary of Abel Tasman&#x27;s visit. Those in attendance at the opening ceremony at Tarakohe included Charles van der Plas, as personal representative of the Netherlands&#x27; Queen, Wilhelmina. The Queen was made Patron of the park.

The idea for the park had been under consideration since June 1938. The Crown set aside , comprising of proposed state forest, of Crown land and of other reserve land for the national park. The Golden Bay Cement Company donated the land where the Abel Tasman Monument and a memorial plaque was sited. The area&#x27;s primary historic interest was the visit of Tasman in 1642, D&#x27;Urville in 1827, and the New Zealand Company barques &quot;Whitby&quot; and &quot;Will Watch&quot;, and brig &quot;Arrow&quot; in 1841. The site was also of significant botanical interest.

===Expansion===
By 1946 the park had reached in area with additional land purchases. A further at Tōtaranui, formerly owned by William Gibbs, was acquired from J S Campbell in 1949 and added to the park. About have been added since. In 2008 an extra , including the formerly private land known as Hadfields Clearing, were added to the park.

In 2016, a further in Awaroa Inlet was purchased by New Zealanders in a crowdfunding campaign.

==Geography==
===Location and size===

Covering an area of , the park is the smallest of New Zealand&#x27;s national parks. It consists of forested, hilly country to the north of the valleys of the Tākaka and Riwaka Rivers, and is bounded to the north by the waters of Golden Bay / Mohua and Tasman Bay. The park contains some of the islands off the coast including the Tata Islands in Golden Bay / Mohua, and Tonga Island, Motuareronui / Adele Island, and Fisherman Island in Tasman Bay.

The park does not extend beyond Mean High Water Mark on the adjacent coast. Between Mean High Water and Mean Low Water Springs, the beaches are gazetted as a Scenic Reserve, covering in total. The Tonga Island Marine Reserve adjoins part of the park.

The Abel Tasman Monument, though not located in the park, commemorates the first contact between Europeans and Māori and is located near the northern end of the park.

===Climate===

==Ecology==
Abel Tasman National Park stands out from most other National parks of New Zealand, given that a large area of it has undergone extensive environmental modification in its history. Early European settlers burned or cleared much of the forest, only to find that the soil was unsuitable for farming. This practise not only destroyed much of the shrubland and forests, but also introduced invasive plants found throughout the modern-day park. However, as time progresses, the original ecosystems and forests are slowly returning.

The park contains varied habitats, including coastal forests, sub-alpine bogs, and sand dunes. As a result of this diversity, many different species can be found. The islands of the park, in particular Tonga Island, Motuareronui / Adele Island and Fisherman Island which are the largest, have been disturbed less and have no introduced mammalian predators. As a result the islands have species not found elsewhere in the park and there are more restrictions to visitor access.

=== Flora ===
Though much of the parkland is pasture or covered with shrubs, valley areas contain forests of rātā, mataī, miro and hinau.

===Fauna===
Over 70 species of birds have been recorded in the park. Some of the birds that can frequently be seen are petrels, shags, penguins, gulls, terns, and herons. Possums, wild pigs, deer, and goats can also be seen in the park.

==Conservation and human interaction==

=== Activities and access ===
The Abel Tasman Coast Track is a popular tramping track that follows the coastline and is one of the Department of Conservation&#x27;s Great Walks; the Abel Tasman Inland Track is less frequented. Other walks in the park, such as the Wainui Falls Track are considered &#x27;short walks&#x27;. Kayaking, camping and sightseeing are other activities.

Access to the park is usually via the small settlement of Mārahau or Kaiteriteri (by water taxi). The nearest large town is Motueka, to the south. Dogs (excepting guide dogs) are not allowed in the park.

===Management===
The Department of Conservation administers the National Park. The Scenic Reserve is administered by the Tasman District Council Chief Executive and Department of Conservation’s Nelson / Marlborough Conservator. Activities in adjoining coastal waters are Tasman District Council&#x27;s responsibility. These areas operate under separate regulations.

Management of the national park is divided into three types of &quot;places&quot;, where visitor access and use differs between type:

# The Coast, making up the coastal margin along the eastern side of the park inland to within 500 m of the Abel Tasman Coast Track. Management priorities include, but are not limited to, restoring wetlands and dune areas, preserving threatened plants, controlling pests, and advocacy related to land adjacent to the park. Other activities pertain to coastal access points and facilities for trampers and visitors.
# The Interior, consisting of the park areas further inland. Park plans include ecological surveys, pest control, and protection of heritage areas and caves. 
# The Islands, encompassing all islands within the park, some of which are closed to the public. key priorities include keeping them free of invasive pests, reintroducing native species, and minimizing human impacts.

====Project Janszoon====
In 2012 Project Janszoon, a privately funded trust, was set up to restore the park&#x27;s ecosystems. The trust takes its name from Tasman&#x27;s middle name &quot;Janszoon&quot;. It is aiming to complete the restoration in time for the 400th anniversary of Tasman&#x27;s visit and the park&#x27;s 100th anniversary in 2042.

The Department of Conservation and Project Janszoon developed a free virtual visitor centre for downloading to smartphones or tablets. The application provides information about the Park&#x27;s history, its flora and fauna, points of interest, weather, walking tracks, and tides.

<text>John Banister (December 26, 1734 – September 30, 1788) was an American Founding Father, lawyer, planter, and slave owner from Petersburg, Virginia. As a member of the Second Continental Congress, he signed the Articles of Confederation, which became the nation&#x27;s first constitution in 1781.

== Life ==

The son of John Banister and grandson of John Baptist Banister the naturalist, he was educated at Middle Temple in London, England, admitted on September 27, 1753. Banister served in the House of Burgesses (1765–1769, 1772–1775), Virginia House of Delegates (1776–1778, 1781–1784), and Second Continental Congress (1778–1779). While a delegate to the Continental Congress, he was a framer of the Articles of Confederation, which he signed on July 8, 1778. Banister also had served as a member of the Virginia Convention, which declared Virginia an independent state in 1776. He was appointed the first mayor of Petersburg in 1784.

Banister was married twice. He first he married Elizabeth &quot;Patsy&quot; Bland, the daughter of Theodorick Bland of Cawsons and the sister of Colonel Theodorick Bland. His first wife died in 1777, and two years later Banister married Agan (Scottish for Anna) Blair of Williamsburg, daughter of John Blair Sr.

Banister&#x27;s suburban villa in Petersburg, Battersea, was built in 1768 in a five-part Palladian style. In 1782, Banister was listed in Dinwiddie County records with three free males, 46 adult slaves, 42 slaves under age, 28 horses, 126 cattle, and one chariot.

== Revolutionary War ==

During the Revolutionary War, Banister was a major and lieutenant colonel of cavalry in the Virginia line militia (1778–1781). General and Commander-in-Chief George Washington regarded him highly, as witnessed by a letter he wrote to him from Valley Forge. In 1781, he aided in supplying his militia and in repelling the British from his state. Much of his personal property was lost. British forces under General William Phillips would commonly stop at his home in Battersea.

== Death ==
Banister is buried in the family plot at &quot;Hatcher&#x27;s Run&quot;, the family estate in Dinwiddie County, Virginia.

==Namesake==
A distinguished Pennsylvania jurist, John Bannister Gibson (1780-1853), was named after John Banister, although using a slightly different spelling of the name.

<text>Yareta or llareta (Azorella compacta, known historically as Azorella yareta, from &quot;yarita&quot; in the Quechua language) is a velvety, chartreuse cushion plant in the family Apiaceae which is native to South America. It grows in the Puna grasslands of the Andes in Peru, Bolivia, northern Chile and western Argentina at altitudes between .

==Description==
Yareta is an evergreen perennial with a low, mat-like shape and hemispherical growth form that grows to around in diameter. The self-fertile, pink or lavender flowers are hermaphroditic and are primarily pollinated by small flies in the order Diptera, as well as a variety of other small insect species, including bees, wasps, and moths.

The plant prefers sandy, well-drained soils. It can grow in nutritionally poor soils that are acidic, neutral or basic (alkaline) at altitudes of up to . Yareta is well-adapted to high insolation rates typical of the Andes highlands and cannot grow in shade. The plant&#x27;s leaves grow into an extremely compact, dense mat that reduces heat and water loss. This mat grows near the ground where air temperature is one or two degrees Celsius higher than the mean air temperature. This temperature difference is a result of the longwave radiation re-radiated by the soil surface, which is usually dark gray to black in the Puna.

Yareta is estimated to grow approximately per year. Many yaretas are estimated to be over 3,000 years old. These oldest ones have been reported to grow as slowly as per year. Its very slow growth makes the traditional practice of harvesting it for fuel highly unsustainable.

<doc id="658253" wikidata="Q1248008" url="?curid=658253" title="Silver fern">
<text>Alsophila tricolor, synonym Cyathea dealbata, commonly known as the silver fern or silver tree-fern, or as ponga or punga (from Māori or ), is a species of medium-sized tree fern, endemic to New Zealand. The fern is usually recognisable by the silver-white colour of the under-surface of mature fronds. It is a symbol commonly associated with the country both overseas and by New Zealanders themselves.

&quot;Alsophila tricolor&quot; is the correct name for &quot;Cyathea dealbata&quot; in &quot;Alsophila&quot; because the epithet &quot;dealbata&quot; is preoccupied by &quot;Alsophila dealbata&quot; (now a synonym of &quot;Sphaeropteris glauca&quot;).

==Description==
This fern is known to grow to heights of or more (though it occasionally takes a rare creeping form). The crown is dense, and mature fronds can be as much as long and wide with a silver-white colouration on the undersides. The fronds may be bipinnately compound or tripinnate. The underside colouration is less intensely silvery or patchy in younger plants and juveniles are pale green. This distinctive silver colouration has made them useful for laying along tracks for night walking. The scales are a dark brown and are often twisted and glossy. Rhizomes very rarely prostrate, usually erect, forming a woody trunk up to tall, in diameter, covered in light brown or white projecting stipe bases, bearing scales near the apex.

==Habitat==
Arriving relatively late in New Zealand&#x27;s history during the Pliocene epoch (around 5.0–1.8 million years ago), the silver fern occurs on the main islands of New Zealand—although absent from the west and south regions of the South Island, on the Chatham Islands to the east, and is also native to Lord Howe Island. It has also become naturalized in Ireland. Its primary habitat is subcanopy areas of drier forests and in open scrub, although it is occasionally found on bush margins and in more open areas, and has been recorded from amongst rushes in a dune slack.

The fern is known to grow well in well-drained humus, and once established, it will tolerate drier conditions. It does best when sheltered from winds and should be protected from frost. Evidence of large amount of macro-charcoals in the top layers of soil suggest that Cyathea dealbata establish themselves in areas where anthropogenic fires occur

==In culture==

The earliest use of the silver fern as an official emblem was by the New Zealand Army during the Second Boer War. Since then, the silver fern has been used by the New Zealand Expeditionary Force during both world wars, and all Commonwealth war graves of fallen New Zealand soldiers have the silver fern engraved on their tombstones. During the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egyptians took exception to New Zealand and Canadian peacekeepers having the Union Flag on their uniforms. Canadian troops wore the Maple Leaf whereas the New Zealand contingent wore a silver fern symbol. New Zealand peacekeepers have since used both the silver fern and kiwi symbols for different deployments to differentiate from their Australian and British counterparts.

Additionally, several British Army units wear the silver fern, normally as a battle honour granted for serving with New Zealand troops. For example, the Queen’s Royal Hussars, the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry and the Warwickshire Yeomanry, all of whom fought with 2nd New Zealand Division at the Second Battle of El Alamein.

The silver fern has long been used on dairy products, including the logo of New Zealand Natural, and was trademarked as early as 1885. It is a logo for many other organisations, such as (heavily stylised) the rail operator KiwiRail. The Silver Fern is also the name of a class of railcar.

Silver fern fronds appear on the coat of arms of New Zealand. Some alternative flags for New Zealand, such as the silver fern flag, utilise the fern. The official proposal of the 2015–2016 New Zealand flag referendums featured the silver fern. The silver fern is also used extensively within politics and printed material, such as the logo of the New Zealand Labour Party.

The Silver Fern was first discovered by the Māori people, who are the indigenous people of New Zealand. According to the legend of the Māori people, the Silver Fern “once lived in the sea” and the Māori hunters would “...use the silver underside of the fern leaves to find their way home…”. When bent at an angle, the leaves of the fern would catch the moonlight and “illuminate a path through the forest” 

The &quot;koru&quot; symbol is inspired by the shape of an unfurling silver fern frond. It is found extensively in Māori art, from carving to the official Māori flag, and is used in a stylised form as the logo for national airline Air New Zealand. Its circular shape conveys the idea of perpetual movement, and its inward coil suggests a return to the point of origin.

In short, the fern has become one of the most widely recognized symbols of New Zealand, next to the kiwi—however, it is not an official national symbol.

The silver fern has been used as a symbol by New Zealand national sports teams, in various stylised forms, since it was first worn by players in the 1888–89 New Zealand Native football team which toured Britain. &quot;Silver Ferns&quot; is the name of the national netball team, and most other national women&#x27;s sports teams have nicknames based on the term &quot;Ferns&quot;, such as Black Ferns (women&#x27;s rugby union), Tall Ferns (women&#x27;s basketball) and Football Ferns (women&#x27;s association football).

National sport teams using the silver fern include:

*All Blacks (rugby)
*Silver Ferns (netball)
*All Whites (football)
*Tall Blacks (basketball)
*White Ferns (women&#x27;s cricket)
*Black Caps (men&#x27;s cricket)
*Black Ferns (women&#x27;s rugby)
*Black Sticks Men &amp; Black Sticks Women (field hockey)
*Team New Zealand (sailing)
*Iron Blacks (American football)
The silver fern is also extensively used as part of the official symbols of New Zealand Olympics teams.

===Controversy===
In 1991, the New Zealand Rugby Football Union obtained trade marks for the name “All Blacks” and its own stylised fern, however the scope of the application was broader because they sought to register any &#x27;fern&#x27;. In 2005, after a legal case lasting four years, the union failed in its bid to stop anyone else using any fern logo on any black jersey.

<doc id="658260" wikidata="Q464674" url="?curid=658260" title="François Louis, Prince of Conti">
<text>François Louis de Bourbon, le Grand Conti (30 April 1664 – 22 February 1709), was Prince de Conti, succeeding his brother, Louis Armand de Bourbon, in 1685. Until this date, he used the title of Prince of La Roche-sur-Yon. He was son of Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti and Anne Marie Martinozzi, daughter of Girolamo Martinozzi and niece of Cardinal Mazarin, through her mother. He was proclaimed as the King of Poland in 1697. He is the most famous member of the Conti family, a cadet branch of the Princes of Condé. As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, he was a &quot;prince du sang.&quot;

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Born at the Hôtel de Conti (quai Malaquais) in Paris, he was the last of his parents&#x27; children. He had one older brother, Louis Armand I, Prince of Conti (1661–1685), who married Marie Anne de Bourbon, the illegitimate daughter of King Louis XIV of France and his mistress, Louise de La Vallière. 

Conti&#x27;s mother, Anne Marie Martinozzi was one of the Mazarinettes, nieces of the powerful Cardinal Mazarin. Conti&#x27;s mother was described as being possessed of a beautiful appearance, blonde hair, a sweet temper, generous, with a lot of wit and intelligence. 

Conti&#x27;s father on the other hand, although seen as intelligent, suffered from a deformity and was considered something of a cypher. Having a reputation for vacillating between debauchery and extreme piousness, his strange behaviour was noted by his contemporaries. 

His father died in 1666 from syphilis when Conti was just two years old. Its possible that he passed down the disease to his son Francois. Conti`s mother died when he was eight years old from an apoplexy.

In his parents respective wills, they entrusted their two now orphaned sons to the care of the Duchess of Longueville, their paternal aunt, and the guardianship of the two boys to their uncle the Grand Condé. The Grand Condé despite his enmity against Conti&#x27;s father, would became particularly attached to François-Louis and make him his protégé hoping to groom him for military life. Louis-Francois cousin, and son of the Grand Condé, Henri Jules was not given to such pursuits and mentally unstable.

François-Louis and his brother were educated by Claude Fleury alongside the Dauphin Louis de Bourbon. Fleury remarked that François-Louis could not sit still, but that this was natural for his age and that nevertheless he had a good memory and remembered what he was taught. 

François-Louis also had an Italian valet, who accompanied him throughout his education , and as a result he “spoke Italian almost as if it was his natural language&quot;. 

=== Banishment from court ===
In 1682, Conti and several other young men at the highest levels of the French aristocray were involved in a scandal, when it was discovered that they had formed a society dedicated to the &quot;italian vice&quot;. 

Among the other members were the comte de Vermandois (the kings son), Prince de Turenne, son of the Duke of Bouillon and Anne Marie Mancini, the Chevalier de Sainte-Maure(ménin to the Dauphin), the Chevalier de Mailly, the Comte de Roucy and Marquise de Créquy son of Marechal de Créquy, the comte de Marsan brother of Chevalier de Lorraine - who was himself the lover of the kings brother the Duke of Orleans. 

This led to Conti being banished from court to Chantilly where his uncle, the Grand Condé could keep a watchful eye over him. 

=== Military career ===
In 1683, Conti assisted the Imperialists in Hungary, and while there, he wrote some letters in which he referred to King Louis XIV as &quot;le roi du théâtre&quot;; because of this, and because of an early engagement at the side of the Turks, in 1685, on his return to France, he was temporarily banished to Chantilly.

== Marriage ==
Conti was the protégé of his uncle, Louis de Bourbon, &quot;le Grand Condé&quot;, whose granddaughter, Marie Thérèse de Bourbon (1666–1732), he married at the Palace of Versailles on 22 January 1688, before the assembled court. Marie Thérése along with her sisters were called &quot;dolls of the blood&quot; (French: les poupées du sang) because of their small stature.

The bride was passionately in love with her husband, and although the couple would go on to have seven children, his attentions were focused elsewhere. It was well known at court that he was in love with his wife&#x27;s sister-in-law, Louise-Françoise de Bourbon, wife of Louis III, Prince of Condé, who was the eldest legitimated daughter of King Louis XIV and his mistress, Madame de Montespan. Marie Anne de Bourbon, the daughter of Louise-Françoise de Bourbon, was thought to have been the fruit of this affair. It was also noted, however, that he had homosexual tendencies and did not pay his wife much attention. He lived as a libertine, engaging in numerous love affairs with members of both sexes. His scandalous philandering and debaucheries caused tension and distance within the family, and earned him the nickname of &quot;le Grand Conti&quot;.

He served in the French army, but he never managed to achieve a rank higher than lieutenant-general. In 1689, he accompanied his intimate friend, François Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg, to the Netherlands, and shared in the French victories at Fleurus, Steinkirk, and Neerwinden. On the death of his cousin, Jean Louis d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Longueville (1646–1694), and in accordance to his will, Conti claimed the principality of Neuchâtel against Marie d&#x27;Orleans-Longueville, Duchess de Nemours (1625–1707), a sister of the Duke.

He failed to obtain military assistance from the Swiss, and by the King&#x27;s command, yielded the disputed territory to Marie d&#x27;Orleans, although the courts of law had decided in his favour. In 1697, King Louis XIV offered him the Polish crown, and by means of bribes, the Abbé de Polignac secured his election. On 27 June 1697, he was formally proclaimed as the King of Poland by Cardinal Radziejowski.

Conti started rather unwillingly for his new kingdom, probably, as the Duke of Saint-Simon remarks, owing to his affection for Louise-Françoise de Bourbon. He departed on the &quot;Railleuse&quot;, under Captain Jean Bart, on 6 September 1697.

When he reached Danzig, he found his rival Augustus II, Elector of Saxony, already in possession of the Polish crown. Conti returned to France, where he was graciously received by King Louis XIV, although Saint-Simon says the King was vexed to see him again. But the misfortunes of the French armies, during the earlier years of the War of the Spanish Succession, compelled the King to appoint Conti, whose military renown stood very high, to command the troops in Italy.

On 4 February 1699, Conti purchased the Château d&#x27;Issy, a small French Baroque château on the outskirts of Paris, bought for the sum of 140,000 livres. The estate remained the property of the Princes of Conti until the Revolution of 1789, when it was confiscated as biens nationaux.

== Death ==
The Prince of Conti fell ill and died on 22 February 1709 at the Hôtel de Conti (quai Conti), his death calling forth exceptional signs of mourning from all classes. He died from a combination of gout and syphilis. He was buried alongside his mother at his estate in L&#x27;Isle-Adam, Val-d&#x27;Oise, near Paris.

He was succeeded as Prince de Conti by his eldest son, Louis Armand II de Bourbon (1696–1727).

==Issue==

Conti married Marie Thérèse de Bourbon, aged 22, who was the daughter of Henri Jules, Prince of Condé and Princess Anne Henriette of the Palatinate. They had the following seven children together:
*Marie Anne de Bourbon (18 April 1689 - 21 March 1720), married Louis Henri I, Prince of Condé, but had no issue.
*&quot;Prince of La Roche-sur-Yon&quot; (18 November 1693 - 22 November 1693), died in infancy.
*&quot;Prince of La Roche-sur-Yon&quot; (1 December 1694 - 25 April 1698), died in infancy.
*Louis Armand II, Prince of Conti (10 November 1695 - 4 May 1727), married Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon, daughter of Louis III, Prince of Condé, and had issue.
*Louise Adélaïde de Bourbon (2 November 1696 – 20 November 1750), died unmarried but had many illegitimate children.
*&quot;Mademoiselle d&#x27;Alais&quot; (19 November 1697 - 13 August 1699), died in infancy.
*Louis François de Bourbon, Count of Alais (27 July 1703 - 21 January 1704), died in infancy.

<text>Louis Armand de Bourbon (30 April 1661 – 9 November 1685) was Prince of Conti from 1666 to his death. He was the son of Armand de Bourbon and Anne Marie Martinozzi, the daughter of Girolamo Martinozzi and Laura Margherita Mazzarini, elder sister of Cardinal Mazarin. As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, he was a Prince du Sang. He was a son-in-law of King Louis XIV of France, who was his namesake.

==Biography==
Louis Armand was born at the Hôtel de Conti (quai Malaquais) in Paris, France. In August 1679 he acted as the groom in the proxy marriage where Marie Louise d&#x27;Orléans married Charles II of Spain. In 1680 he married Marie Anne de Bourbon, the illegitimate daughter of King Louis XIV and his first mistress, Louise de La Vallière. The bride and groom were respectively thirteen and eighteen years old at the time. Since neither of them had been instructed on what to expect on their first night together, it ended up in disaster, with Marie Anne fleeing in despair and the prince not wanting to share the bed of a woman again.

He served with distinction in Flanders in 1683, and, against the wish of the King, went to Hungary, where he helped the Imperialists defeat the Turks at Gran in the same year. He died on 9 November 1685 at the Palace of Fontainebleau from smallpox, which he contracted from his wife. While she recovered after some time, the Prince succumbed after five days.

Having no descendants, he was succeeded as Prince of Conti by his younger brother, François Louis de Bourbon (1664–1709).

<text>The Dating Game is an American television game show that first aired on December 20, 1965, and was the first of many shows created and packaged by Chuck Barris from the 1960s through the 1980s. ABC dropped the show on July 6, 1973, but it continued in syndication for another year (1973–1974) as &quot;The New Dating Game&quot;. The program was revived three additional times in syndication afterward, with the first from 1978 to 1980 as &quot;The All-New Dating Game&quot;, the second from 1986 to 1989, and the third from 1996 to 1999.

Jim Lange hosted &quot;The Dating Game&quot; for its entire ABC network run and for the 1973 and 1978 syndicated editions. The 1986 revival was hosted by Elaine Joyce for its first season and Jeff MacGregor for its remaining two seasons. When the show was revived with a different format in 1996, Brad Sherwood was named as its host. Chuck Woolery took over for the two final seasons, with the original format reinstated, in 1997 after he had left &quot;The Home and Family Show.&quot;

Beginning in 1966, &quot;The Dating Game&quot; was often paired with &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;. This was especially true when the two shows entered syndication, and in 1996, the revivals of &quot;The Dating Game&quot; and &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; were sold together as a package called &quot;The Dating-Newlywed Hour&quot;.

The program was originally broadcast in black-and-white, but when a prime-time version began in October 1966, both versions were broadcast in color, making the daytime version the first ABC daytime series to be regularly broadcast in color.

In February 2021, it was reported that ABC and current distributor Sony Pictures Television would revive the show as &quot;The Celebrity Dating Game&quot;, with actress Zooey Deschanel and singer Michael Bolton as hosts, which premiered on June 14, 2021. It ran for eight episodes until August 16, 2021, and was canceled in April 2022.

==Format==
Typically, a bachelorette would question three bachelors, who were hidden from her view; at the end of the questioning period, she would choose one to accompany her on a date, with expenses paid by the show. Occasionally, the roles would be reversed with a gentleman questioning three ladies; other times, celebrities would question three players for dates for themselves, co-workers or relatives.

Before becoming famous, Farrah Fawcett, Suzanne Somers, Yvonne Craig, Lindsay Wagner, Leif Garrett, Tom Selleck and Lee Majors appeared as contestants on the show in the 1960s and early 1970s. Other contestants who appeared before becoming famous included the Carpenters, Jackson Bostwick, Michael Richards, Joanna Cameron, Andy Kaufman (who went under the pseudonym Baji Kimran), Steve Martin, Burt Reynolds, John Ritter, Phil Hartman, Jennifer Granholm (governor of Michigan from 2003 to 2010), Arnold Schwarzenegger (governor of California from 2003 to 2011) and Alex Kozinski. Serial killer Rodney Alcala&#x27;s episodes were shown during his murder spree and after he had been convicted of assault in California.

Some contestants appeared even after they were fairly well known, including a young Michael Jackson, Burton Cummings, Dusty Springfield, Ron Howard, Maureen McCormick, Barry Williams, Sally Field, Richard Dawson, Jay North and Paul Lynde.

A trademark of the show was that at the end of each episode, the host and winning contestants would blow a kiss to the viewers.

==Gameplay==

===Original version===

Generally, the bachelorette would ask questions, written in advance on cards, to each of the three hidden bachelors. The same question could be asked to multiple bachelors. This continued until time ran out. The bachelorette would make her choice based solely on the answers to her questions. Occasionally, the contestant was a bachelor who would ask questions to three bachelorettes. Certain kinds of questions were &quot;off limits&quot;, such as name, age, occupation and income.

===1996 revival===
For the first season of the 1996 revival, a different format was used. A notable change was that the prospective bachelor/bachelorette knew the first names of the three contestants at all times.

Instead of asking questions of the contestants, the bachelor/bachelorette was presented with two pun-laden statements, each pertaining to one of the contestants. When chosen, a new statement replaced the old one and the potential date explained the reason why that fact pertained to him or her. Play continued until time expired, and then the bachelor/bachelorette would announce his or her choice.

In several weeks of episodes that aired at various times throughout the season, another format was used. This format had the players choose a potential date based on appearance and another based on personality. To decide the &quot;looks&quot; portion, the bachelor/bachelorette would observe each contestant (another change not seen on any &quot;Dating Game&quot; series beforehand) for several seconds, with the contestants wearing noise-canceling headphones to prevent them from hearing the bachelor/bachelorette talking about them. The statement round was used to determine the &quot;personality&quot; portion. After the game ended, the bachelor/bachelorette would select one contestant based on appearance and one based on personality, then would be prompted to choose between the two. If the bachelor/bachelorette was to select the same contestant for both looks and personality, the contestant would win a $500 cash prize.

The remaining two seasons reverted to the original format, but there was more of a variety between bachelors and bachelorettes.

==Episode status==
Various episodes from the ABC daytime run have aired on Game Show Network. The remaining ABC versions of the show, which were made for primetime and for syndication, are assumed to exist in their entirety.

After the syndicated finale in 1980, repeats of the 1978–1980 version were seen on KHJ-TV (now KCAL-TV) in Los Angeles from September 26, 1983, to September 12, 1986 (when The All-New Dating Game with Elaine Joyce premiered on September 15, 1986), as well as in some other cities. In another variation of the final year in reruns, some episodes from ABC daytime, ABC primetime and weekly syndication were shown.

==Guests==
Notable people who appeared on &quot;The Dating Game&quot; include:
*Rodney Alcala, subsequently dubbed &quot;The Dating Game Killer&quot; (1978)
*Jo Anne Worley (1967)
*Steve Martin (1968)
* John Ritter

==Theme music and cues==
The show used many contemporary songs, ranging from those of Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass from the 1960s to pop music used for celebrity guest and band appearances. For the first few episodes at the beginning of the ABC run, live music was provided by the Regents (unrelated to the doo-wop band of the same name who were famous for their song &quot;Barbara Ann&quot;), a house band from Jack Martin&#x27;s A.M-P.M. on La Cienega Boulevard Starting in 1966, the show used recorded music, with the main theme provided by the Mariachi Brass, featuring trumpeter Chet Baker. The show used cover songs made by Skip Battin &amp; the Group (1967, Aurora 159) and the Challengers (196?, Triumph 64).

The series used several songs by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass as cues for the show, including:

* &quot;Spanish Flea&quot; (when introducing the bachelor)
* &quot;Whipped Cream&quot; (when introducing the bachelorette) 
* &quot;Lollipops and Roses&quot; (when the dates meet)

Other songs were used after the interview portion, when guests were choosing a date, including:
* &quot;Ladyfingers&quot; (Herb Alpert)
* &quot;Lemon Tree&quot; (Herb Alpert)

Music used during celebrity guest appearances included:
* &quot;Live&quot; (The Merry-Go-Round)
* &quot;Close to You&quot; (Carpenters)
* &quot;Midnight Confessions&quot; (The Grass Roots)
* &quot;I Want To Be Where You Are&quot; (Michael Jackson)
* &quot;I Want You Back&quot; (The Jackson Five), during the prize description
* &quot;Cheyenne&quot; (The Brady Bunch)
* &quot;Goin&#x27; Out of My Head&quot; (Little Anthony)
* &quot;What&#x27;s It Gonna Be&quot; (Dusty Springfield)

Other music cues used on the show included:
* &quot;Fantail&quot; by Count Basie (when host Jim Lange would introduce the three potential dates to the audience)
* &quot;Love Sickness&quot; by the Trumpets Ole (a brief cue used when the time limit for the interview portion is reached)
* &quot;Boston Bust-Out&quot; by Jimmy McGriff (before the date is introduced to his or her prize)

In 1972, &quot;The Dating Game&quot; added a Dixieland-style closing theme called &quot;Little Rosie&quot; to its ABC daytime version; the tune was used also on the first two syndicated versions, through 1980. The song, along with some of the show&#x27;s other cues, was featured on the 1973 album &quot;Themes from TV Game Shows&quot;, produced by Chuck Barris. The show continued to use the 1966 opening theme until 1974; during the 1978-80 version, the show used a rearranged version of it. The 1978 opening theme is found on the Barris album&#x27;s first track and is credited to Barris and David Mook.

The 1980s reboot of the show used music composed by Milton DeLugg, while later editions featured a re-recording of the original theme by Steve Kaplan.

The music for &quot;The Celebrity Dating Game&quot; was composed by Cheche Alara.

==International versions==
These versions are no longer airing.

==Legacy==
In his first autobiography, &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; (1988), Chuck Barris claimed that &quot;The Dating Game&quot; was a cover for his CIA activities, and was promoted by the CIA. However, his second memoir, &quot;The Game Show King: A Confession&quot; (1993), mentions neither the CIA nor his previous book. A CIA spokesman has categorically denied that Barris ever worked for the agency in any capacity.

The show&#x27;s popularity in the 1960s inspired a Baskin-Robbins ice cream flavor called &quot;Dating Game&quot;. It was pink ice cream with diced dates and butter-toasted pecans.

In a 1980 &quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot; episode, Lenny and Squiggy appear as bachelors on &quot;The Dating Game&quot;.

&quot;The Dating Game&quot; was parodied by Steve Jobs during a 1983 Macintosh pre-launch event. The three &quot;contestants&quot; were Mitch Kapor of Lotus Software, Fred Gibbons of Software Publishing Corporation and Bill Gates of Microsoft.

A recurring parody featured in the current version of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; called &quot;The Dealing Game&quot; features Wayne Brady and Jonathan Mangum (both as different characters in each appearance), but instead of a date, each represents a curtain and tries to convince the contestant to pick his curtain. Model Tiffany Coyne plays the role of the &quot;hostess&quot;.

&quot;The Dating Game&quot; has been cited as a predecessor to future &quot;reality TV juggernaut&quot; &quot;Love is Blind&quot; in which contestants similarly choose among suitors sight unseen.

==Licensed merchandise==
Hasbro released three home games based on the original 1965 version of &quot;The Dating Game&quot; from 1967 to 1968, while Pressman Toy Corporation released a home game based on the late 1980s version in 1987.

In 1968, a 33⅓ rpm party record called &quot;The Dating Game Party Pak&quot;, narrated by Jim Lange, was released; it included postcard invitations, name tags and scorecards for six people to play.

In the late 1990s, Sony&#x27;s website released an online version of &quot;The Dating Game&quot;.

A video slot machine based on the original 1965 version with an animated Jim Lange was released by IGT in 2004 in both nickel and quarter versions.

In March 2011, a new virtual version of &quot;The Dating Game&quot; was launched on Facebook, Twitter and other social media network sites. The game was developed by 3G Studios, under license from Sony Pictures Entertainment.

<text>The Kapaleeshwarar Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Shiva. It is located in Mylapore, Chennai in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The temple was built around the 7th century CE and is an example of South Indian Architecture.

According to the &quot;Puranas&quot;, Parvati worshipped her husband Shiva in the form of a peahen (&quot;mayil&quot; in Tamil), giving the vernacular name &quot;Mylai&quot; () to the area that developed around the temple. Shiva is worshiped as Kapaleeshwarar, and is represented by the &quot;lingam&quot;. Parvati is worshipped as Karpagambal (goddess of the wish-yielding tree). The presiding deity is revered in the 7th-century Tamil Shaiva canonical work, the &quot;Tevaram&quot;, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanars and classified as one of the &quot;Paadal Petra Sthalam&quot;.

The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Kapaleeshwarar and Karpagambal being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 5:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., and four yearly festivals on its calendar. The Aṟupatimūvar festival celebrated during the Tamil month of &quot;Panguni&quot; as part of the brahmotsava is the most prominent festival in the temple.

The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu.

== Legend ==

The temple&#x27;s name is derived from the words &quot;kapala&quot; (head) and &quot;Ishvara&quot;, an epithet of Shiva. According to the &quot;Puranas&quot;, during the meeting of the deities Brahma and Shiva at top of Mount Kailash, Brahma failed to show the due respect to Shiva. Due to this, Shiva plucked off one of the five heads (&quot;kapala&quot;) of Brahma. In an act of penance, Brahma came down to the site of Mylapore and installed a lingam to please Shiva. This place is known as Sukra Puri, Veda Puri, among many other names including &quot;Kailaye Mayilai&quot; and &quot;Mayilaye Kayilai&quot; (). According to regional legend, Shiva&#x27;s consort Parvati (Karpagambal), due to a curse became a pea-hen and did penance here to get back her original form. Her son Murugan received the spear (vel) for the destruction of a demon from Parvati here. Brahma had worshipped here to get rid of his ego and get back his power to create. The four Vedas have worshipped here. Shukra worshipped Shiva here and got back his lost eye. The daughter of Sivanesa Chettiar Angam Poompavai, who died due to snake bite, was resurrected here by the powers of the Nayanar saint Sambandar. Vayilar, another Nayanar saint, attained salvation here.

== History ==
The temple is generally thought to be built in the 7th century CE by the ruling Pallavas. This view is based on references to the temple in the hymns of the Nayanar saints. However, the Nayanar Sambandar and the saint Arunagirinathar make clear reference to the Kapaleeshwarar temple being located by a seashore. There are inscriptions dating back to 12th century inside the temple. The temple&#x27;s 120 ft &quot;gopuram&quot; (gateway tower) was built during 1906 with stucco figures adorning it. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.

==The Temple==

The Kapaleeshwarar temple is of typical Tamil architectural style, with the &quot;gopuram&quot; overpowering the street on which the temple sits. This temple is also a testimonial for the vishwakarmas sthapathis. There are two entrances to the temple marked by the &quot;gopuram&quot; on either side. The east &quot;gopuram&quot; is about 40 m high, while the smaller western gopuram faces the sacred tank.

The &quot;vahana&quot;s (&quot;vehicles&quot;) at the temple include the bull, adhikaranandi, elephant, bandicoot, peacock, goat and parrot, while a golden chariot is a recent addition. Statues of the presiding divine couple are seated on a &quot;vahana&quot; or chariot which is brought in a procession around the temple while the temple band plays music. Devotees gather around the &quot;vahanas&quot; and consider it a privilege to pull / lift the deities on the &quot;vahana&quot;. There is also a peacock and a peahen caged inside the temple, to symbolize the tradition that Karpagambal had come in the form of peahen to plead to Kapaleeshwarar.

==Sapta Sthana Shiva temples==
This temple is one of the Sapta Sthana Shiva temples in Mylapore area. (one of the seven sacred Shiva temples in Mylapore). They are:

# Karaneeswarar Temple
# Tirttapaleeswarar Temple
# Velleeswarar Temple
# Virupakshiswarar Temple
# Valeeswarar Temple
# Malleeswarar Temple
# Kapaleeshwarar Temple

In addition to these &quot;Sapta Sthana Shiva sthalas&quot;, the Ekambareshwarar–Valluvar temple in the neighbourhood is traditionally considered the indispensable eighth.

==The tank==
The &quot;theppakulam&quot; or the temple tank lies to the west of the temple. Known as the Kapaleeshwarar Tank or the Mylapore Tank, it is one of the oldest and well-maintained theppakulams in the city, measuring about 190 m in length and 143 m in breadth. The tank has a storage capacity of 119,000 cubic metre and has water all through the year. The 16-pillared, granite-roofed structure, known as the &quot;mandapam&quot; at the centre of this tank is known for its significance during the three-day annual float festival, when idols of Kapaleeshwarar and other deities are taken around the tank to the chanting of Vedic hymns.

In 2014, 56.5 million was allotted to build a 2,150-meter-long pavement around the tank.

==Religious practises==
The temple priests perform the &quot;puja&quot; (rituals) on a daily basis and during festivals. Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaiva community. The temple rituals are performed six times a day; Ushathkalam at 6:00 a.m., Kalasanthi at 9:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 1:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 9:00 p.m. There is a separate calendar for the Rahu Abhishekam (sacred ablution): it is performed twice in a day at 11:30 a.m and 5:30 p.m. and additionally twice at various times in the day. Each ritual comprises four steps: &quot;abhisheka&quot; (sacred bath), &quot;alangaram&quot; (decoration), &quot;neivethanam&quot; (food offering) and &quot;deepa aradanai&quot; (waving of lamps) for both Kapaleeshwarar and Karpagambal. The worship is held amidst music with &quot;nadasvaram&quot; (pipe instrument) and &quot;tavil&quot; (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) read by priests and prostration by worshippers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like &#x27; and &#x27;, fortnightly rituals like &quot;pradosham&quot; and monthly festivals like &quot;amavasai&quot; (new moon day), &quot;kiruthigai&quot;, &quot;pournami&quot; (full moon day) and &quot;sathurthi&quot;. During Friday worship, Karpagambal is decorated with a &quot;kasu mala&quot;, a garland made of gold coins.

==Festivals==
During the Tamil month of &quot;Panguni&quot;, the traditional &quot;Brahmotsavam&quot; (annual festival) takes place when the entire neighborhood comes alive with a &quot;mela (carnival)&quot;-like atmosphere. Since this month corresponds to the mid-March to mid-April duration, the Kapaleeshwarar temple celebrates the nine day-long as &quot;Panguni Peruvila&quot; (Spring festival). The festival starts with &quot;dhvajarohanam&quot; (flag hoisting), includes the &quot;terotsavam&quot;, (festival of chariot), Arupathimoovar festival and concludes with the &quot;Tirukkalyanam&quot; (Marriage of Kapaleeshwararand Karpagambal). In &quot;Brahmotsavam&quot;, the idols of Kapaleeshwarar and Karpagambal are decorated with clothes and jewels, are mounted on a &quot;vahana&quot;, and then taken around the temple and its water tank in a &quot;pradakshinam&quot; (a clockwise path when seen from above). This is repeated with different &quot;vahanas&quot; over the next nine days. The more important of the individual &quot;pradakshinams&quot; are the &quot;Athigara Nandhi&quot; on the third day, the &quot;Rishaba Vahanam&quot; on the midnight of the fifth day, the &quot;ther&quot; (about 13 meters in height and pulled by people) on the seventh morning, and the &quot;Aṟupatimūvar&quot; festival on the eighth day.

The &quot;Arupathimoovar&quot; festival is the most important procession. It is named after the sixty-three Nayanar saints. All sixty-three Nayanar idols follow the Kapaleeshwarar idol on this procession. During the car festival, Kapaleeshwarar is depicted holding a bow while seated on a throne, with Karpagambal alongside. Brahma is depicted as driving the &quot;ther&quot;. The chariot is decorated with flowers and statues; there are huge gatherings of devotees to pull the &quot;ther&quot;. The car festival of 1968 is documented in the documentary film &quot;Phantom India&quot; by Louis Malle.

==Religious work and saints==

There is a reference to the temple in Sangam literature of the 1st to 5th centuries and the earliest post-Sangam mention is found in the 6th century Tamil literature. The temple and the deity were immortalized in Tamil poetry in the works of &quot;Tevaram&quot; by poet saint belonging to the 7th century – Thirugnana Sambanthar has composed the 6th &quot;Poompavai pathigam&quot; in praise of the temple. Arunagirinathar, a 15th-century poet, sings praise of the temple in &quot;Tirumayilai Tirupugal&quot;. The 12th-century poet Gunaveera Pandithar sings about Neminathan under &quot;Theerthangar neminathar pugazh&quot;. &quot;Tirumayilai Prabanthangal&quot; is a compilation of four works on the temple and the deity.

<text>Until the establishment of seven new provinces in 2015, Nepal was divided into 14 administrative zones (Nepali: अञ्चल; &quot;anchal&quot;) and 77 districts (Nepali: जिल्ला; &quot;jillā&quot;). The 14 administrative zones were grouped into five development regions (Nepali: विकास क्षेत्र; &quot;vikās kṣetra&quot;). Each district was headed by a chief district officer (CDO), who was responsible for maintaining law and order and coordinating the work of field agencies of the various government ministries.

<doc id="658274" wikidata="Q490870" url="?curid=658274" title="Anders Chydenius">
<text>Anders Chydenius (; 26 February 1729 – 1 February 1803) was a Swedish-Finnish Lutheran priest and a member of the Swedish Riksdag, and is known as the leading classical liberal of Nordic history. He carried out his life&#x27;s work in the Kingdom of Sweden (Finland being then part of the kingdom), advocating for free trade, freedom of speech, and social reforms.

Born in Sotkamo, Finland (then part of Sweden) and having studied under Pehr Kalm at the Royal Academy of Åbo, Chydenius became a priest and Enlightenment philosopher. He was elected as an ecclesiastic member of the Swedish Riksdag of the Estates in 1765–66, in which his Cap party seized the majority and government and championed Sweden&#x27;s first Freedom of the Press Act, the most liberal in the world along with those of Great Britain and the Seven United Provinces (of the Netherlands). Vehemently opposed to the extreme interventionist policies of mercantilism preached by the previously predominant Hat party for decades, he was ultimately coerced into retirement for his criticism of the Cap administration&#x27;s radical deregulation policies and their social and political consequences.

Following Gustav III&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état in 1772, which meant the end of parliamentary rule for another century, Chydenius briefly returned to prominence and worked to increase civil liberties and economic freedom as part of Gustav&#x27;s doctrine of enlightened despotism, and contributed to the abolishment of torture as means of interrogation, the limitation of capital punishment, and the legalisation of Jewish and Catholic immigration into Sweden. Ultimately, the king&#x27;s increasingly autocratic position brought Chydenius out of favour again, and he retired to private life in Ostrobothnia, where he died at age 73.

An early pioneer—also by international standards—and proponent of economic liberalism, freedom of religion, freedom of speech and migration (writing a pamphlet on the invisible hand a decade before the publication of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;) he was one of the first comprehensive philosophers of liberalism.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Anders Chydenius was born in 1729 in Sotkamo, Ostrobothnia (now part of Kainuu region) where his father Jacob was a chaplain. The family moved to Kuusamo in 1734 where his father became a parish rector. Anders&#x27; childhood was spent in the barren area of northern Finland. He and his brother Samuel were taught privately by their father and then they went to Oulu grammar school (Uleåborg trivialskola). After the Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743), the boys studied privately in Tornio and entered The Royal Academy of Åbo in 1745. They also studied at Uppsala University. Anders studied mathematics, natural sciences, Latin and philosophy. In 1746 the father Jacob and family moved to Kokkola.

=== Nedervetil ===
In 1753, after graduation, Anders was appointed preacher of the Chapel of the dependent parish of Nedervetil (today, part of Kronoby) in Ostrobothnia. He was married in 1755 to Beata Magdalena Mellberg, daughter of a merchant from Jakobstad. The couple was childless.
While in Nedervetil he was active in many projects such as the clearing of the marshes, experimenting with new breeds of animals and plants, and adopting new methods of cultivation of potatoes and tobacco. His aim was to enlighten the peasants by example. Chydenius practiced medicine and became known by inoculating ordinary people against smallpox. He also performed cataract operations and prepared medicines.
=== The 1765–1766 Riksdag of the Estates ===

Some of his first writings were about practical matters such as the moss overgrowing the meadows, and improvements in the design of horse carriages. Then he moved on to social questions and became known as a writer and speaker. He was sent to the Diet in 1765 to obtain free trading rights for the towns of Ostrobothnia. The cities of Gamlakarleby, Vasa (Finnish: &quot;Vaasa&quot;), Björneborg (Finnish: &quot;Pori&quot;) and Uleåborg received navigational rights which helped with their later development as well as helping all of Ostrobothnia. At that time, the tar which should have brought prosperity to his town and the coast had to be sold abroad through Stockholm, which made most of the profits. Largely due to Chydenius&#x27; efforts, Stockholm&#x27;s monopoly was broken and from 1765, the towns gained freedom to sell and ship tar directly to foreign customers.

Chydenius participated actively in the Diet, and published several articles of criticism which caused a great stir. One of the results of his activities in the Diet was a stricter parliamentary control of the government budget. He considered that one of his greatest achievements was an extension of the freedom of the press. His radical activities caused him to be excluded from the Diet by his own political party in 1766.

=== Kokkola ===
In 1770 he was appointed rector of Gamlakarleby where he concentrated on parish work. He maintained his own orchestra, and rehearsed with them. They gave concerts in the rectory&#x27;s reception hall. His father lived in the parsonage at Gamlakarleby from 1746 to 1766, and Anders lived there from 1770 to 1803.

Between 1778 and 1779 Anders Chydenius once again participated in the Diet, at which the position of hired hands was brought up. He championed the rights of the servant class. At the suggestion of King Gustavus III, he introduced a bill whereby foreigners were also granted limited rights to practice their own religion. He participated in the Diet again in 1793 and was active as a writer covering the development of agriculture, the burning of saltpeter, smallpox, and the settlement of Lapland. One of his main tasks during his latter years was the supervision of building an extension to the old parish church. In 1796 he became a member of the Swedish society Pro Fide et Christianismo, founded to promote Christian education, along with his nephew Jakob Tengström. He died in 1803.

== Ideas ==
Chydenius focused his liberal writings on attacking the mercantilism, mercantilist conquest politics, conservatism, protectionism and privilege that were prevalent at the time. In his view, state offices should not be for sale and the state should not impose any restrictions or privileges on any act. He criticised the clergy, nobility, civil servants and other privileged people, saying that they lived off the work of peasants, seeking to turn the debate on the status of peasants into a debate on the status of the privileged. The prevailing view was that peasants and workers had to be kept poor to prevent them from idling. Chydenius showed that, on the contrary, workers were not idlers who should be forced to make the state rich, but vital individuals who, free to pursue their own happiness, would also benefit others.

Chydenius was in favour of peace, demanded full and inviolable land ownership, wanted to give refugees protection and peasants and artisans the right to sell their products whenever and wherever they wanted. He opposed price and wage regulation and the labour strike, and demanded the right of workers to choose their employers. To save sparsely populated Lapland, he proposed turning it into a night-watchman state.

=== Free trade ===

In 1765 Chydenius published a pamphlet called &quot;The National Gain&quot; (&quot;Den nationnale winsten&quot;), in which he proposes ideas of free trade and industry, explores the relationship between economy and society, and lays out the principles for liberalism, capitalism, and modern democracy. In the book Chydenius published theories closely corresponding to Adam Smith&#x27;s invisible hand, eleven years before Smith published his book, &quot;The Wealth of Nations.&quot;

Chydenius also put his theories into practice by proposing to the Riksdag of the Estates a drastic trade liberalization of towns along the Gulf of Bothnia. However, most of his other propositions were not realized, such as turning Lapland to a nightwatchman state to make the poor province prosper economically:

 – free state, private ownership and individual freedom. Inhabitants could choose whatever profession, freedom of trade would be complete, there would be no privileges, regulation or taxes. Bureaucracy would be nonexistent, and the only officer would be a judge who would oversee that no-one&#x27;s rights would be suppressed.

=== Freedom of expression ===

Chydenius became a great proponent of freedom of the press. In a report published in 1776, he wrote:

No evidence should be needed that a certain freedom of writing and printing is one of the strongest bulwarks of a free organisation of the state, as without it, the estates would not have sufficient information for the drafting of good laws, and those dispensing justice would not be monitored, nor would the subjects know the requirements of the law, the limits of the rights of government, and their own responsibilities. Education and good conduct would be crushed; coarseness in thought, speech, and manners would prevail, and dimness would darken the entire sky of our freedom in a few years.

=== Natural equality ===

Chydenius was outspoken about universal rights and the abolition of privilege. He wanted to give the poor the same freedom as for everybody else and argued for the good of the poor, which was then rather exceptional among politicians. He promoted democracy and defended the freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of trade and industry, and the workers rights. He called for an oversight of the way the state funds were spent. In modern language we would say he advocated openness and good governance.

In a 1778 essay, &quot;Thoughts Upon the Natural Rights of Servants and Peasants&quot;, he wrote:

Nature shapes them exactly like us. Their posture in the crib is the same as ours, their souls have the same reason as other peoples&#x27;, whereby it is plain to see that the Lord of creation also had intended them to have equal rights with other people.
== Legacy ==

Chydenius can be seen as a major influence on Nordic thinkers as well as real-life politics, strictly promoting classical liberalism. He has been labeled the father of Swedish liberalism. Both Sweden and Finland include him among their historical notables, and he is variably categorized either Swedish or Finnish by nationality.

Anders Chydenius is remembered as a man ahead of his time, expressing ideas that were radical in his day, but are now the backbone of the Nordic ideology. He can also be seen as an Enlightenment thinker, an advocate of science, arts, rational thinking and freedom. He was also a scientist and skilled eye-surgeon, the maker of several inventions, a pioneer of vaccination in Finland and the founder of an orchestra.

Chydenius was featured on the highest valued bank note (1000 marks) of the Finnish mark&#x27;s last design series. There are also many place names referring to Chydenius in Kokkola, such as the Chydenia Shopping Center, which was completed in the town center in 2006.

Anders Chydenius was selected as the main motif in a recent Finnish commemorative coin, the €10 Anders Chydenius commemorative coin, minted in 2003. The obverse features an open book, referring to Chydenius&#x27;s numerous publications and the Bible. On the reverse, a traditional village with a church and other buildings can be seen.

In the book &quot;Historiens 100 viktigaste svenskar&quot; (&quot;100 Most Important Swedes in History&quot;), written by Niklas Ekdal and Petter Karlsson, Chydenius was ranked as the seventeenth most important Swede in history. In Finland, Chydenius was ranked on the place #40 in the list of &quot;Greatest Finns&quot; in a voting contest organised by the national broadcasting company.

The Chydenius family is even today a well known cultural family in Finland. Composer Kaj Chydenius is Anders&#x27;s distant relative.

<text>Natal (, literally &quot;Christmas&quot; or &quot;natal&quot; (something related to &quot;birth&quot;)) is the capital and largest city of the state of Rio Grande do Norte, located in northeastern Brazil. According to IBGE&#x27;s 2022 estimate, the city had a total population of 751,300, making it the 24th largest city in the country. Natal is a major tourist destination and an exporting hub of crustaceans, carnauba wax and fruits, mostly melon, sugar apple, cashew and papaya. Natal is Brazil&#x27;s closest city to Africa and Europe, its Greater Natal International Airport connects the city with many Brazilian destinations and also operates some international flights. The city was one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

==History==

The Brazilian coast has long been home to indigenous peoples, generally members of the Tupi language family. While written records do not exist, archeological evidence suggests that pre-European inhabitants moved from the Amazon to the coasts approximately 2,900 years ago.

Near the Rio Grande de Norte, the Potiguara people were the most numerous &quot;indios&quot; encountered by the Portuguese. It is believed that in 1500, prior to contact with the Europeans, there were over 1 million people living in coastal Brazilian among all of the local groups. This nearly equaled the population of Portugal at the time.

The northeastern tip of South America, to the north of Natal and the closest point to Europe from Latin America, was first visited by European navigators in 1501, as part of the 1501–1502 Portuguese expedition led by Amerigo Vespucci. Vespucci renamed the area after the saint of the day, Cape São Roque; the prior indigenous name is unknown. For decades thereafter, no permanent European settlement was established in the area.

In 1597, after some years during which French pirates, led by Jacques Riffault, established regular commercial activities with the native population, the ninth Portuguese Governor-General of Brazil, Francisco de Sousa, ordered the expulsion of the buccaneers. The successful expedition against 50 Frenchmen and their Amerindian allies was led by the Captain-Major of the Captaincy of Pernambuco, Manuel de Mascarenhas Homem, with the assistance of Jerônimo de Albuquerque Maranhão.

Albuquerque Maranhão began on January 6, 1598, the construction of the Fort of the Holy Kings or of the Magi-Kings (&quot;&quot;Forte dos Santos Reis&quot; or &quot;Forte dos Reis Magos&quot;&quot;), named after the Three Wise Men, honored in the Christian feast of the Epiphany, celebrated on that day.

Natal (which translates to &quot;Nativity&quot; or &quot;Christmas&quot; in Portuguese) was founded on December 25, 1599, giving the village outside the fort the modern name of the city. The fort, city, and surrounding areas were occupied by Dutch forces from 1633 to 1654. They rechristened the fort &quot;Fort Ceulen&quot; after one of their commanders.
The sandy soil of Natal prevented the city from becoming a producer of sugarcane during the colonial times. For centuries, the economy of the state was based on the raising of cattle in the dry interior lands. Cattle were sent alive to the larger centers, to be used as traction, or were turned into jerked beef, for food; the most typical food of Natal, &quot;carne de sol&quot; (sun meat), has origins in that jerked beef.
In the last century, Natal benefited from the growth of the salt industries (the north of Rio Grande do Norte is the largest producer in Brazil) and petroleum (the largest inland Brazilian reserves are in the State). Natal grew quickly, but in a somewhat planned way (compared to other major Brazilian cities). Tourists (first Brazilians, more recently foreigners) discovered the city, which became one of the major tourist destinations in Brazil.

Because of its strategic position (Natal is one of the cities in Brazil nearest to Western Europe and Africa, especially Dakar, Senegal), an American air base was built in a suburb of Natal named Parnamirim during World War II, as part of the so-called Operation Rainbow. This base provided support for allied troops fighting in north Africa. Thousands of American soldiers were sent to Natal. Their presence left traces in the culture of the city. The city also held the Potenji Conference, which took place right after the Casablanca Conference and defined the active participation of Brazil in the war, being the only Latin American country to send troops overseas to fight in Europe.

New Amsterdam

In the context of the Dutch invasions in Brazil, between 1624 and 1661, the current city of Natal, in Rio Grande do Norte, is called Nova Amsterdam.

In 1633, the Dutch took the city of Natal in Northeast Brazil from the Portuguese and renamed it New Amsterdam. During this period the city grew and because of its geographically privileged region it was very precious to the Dutch, where they could observe if any enemy approached the region and protect the important sugar trade in the Brazilian Northeast. The city remained with this name until Portuguese troops, helped mainly by Pernambucans, who founded the city of Natal, and allied Indians expelled the invaders and restored Portugal&#x27;s dominance in the region. Although it was named after the main Dutch city, Natal was not the main nucleus of the protectorate - it was in third place among the 3 largest nuclei, but it was the second largest nucleus in the northern part of it (New York City and Natal were the only ones to receive such a name at such longitudes).

==Geography==
Natal is located at , in the far east of South America. The city has a total area of . Natal lies on the Atlantic Ocean, at the mouth of the Potengi River.

===Climate===
Natal has a typical tropical climate, specifically a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;As&quot;), with warm to hot temperatures and high relative humidity all throughout the year. However, these conditions are relieved by a near absence of extreme temperatures and pleasant trade winds blowing from the ocean. February is the warmest month, with mean maximum of and minimum of , while July is the coolest with mean maximum of and minimum of . Rainfall is heavy at around per year, but there is a dry season between about September and January that is more distinct than further south on the Atlantic coast. The greatest amount of rain falls between March and July.

Known as the &quot;City of the Sun&quot; and also as &quot;The City of the Dunes&quot;, Natal is located in the northeastern tip of Brazil. Lying about six degrees south of the equator the sun shines on for more than 3,000 hours every year. The average temperature in Natal is about . During the summer season it normally reaches above with the water at .
==Demographics==

According to the IBGE of 2022, there were 751,300 people residing in the city, and 1,52 million people residing in the Greater Natal (metropolitan area).

It is the 21st-largest city in the country and the sixth largest in the northeastern region. The racial makeup of the city in 2022 was 46.6% Pardo (Multiracial), 43.2% White, 9.8% Black, 0.2% Asian and 0.2% Amerindian.

==Economy==
With its dozens of sandy, white beaches, such as Ponta Negra and its famous Morro do Careca - the cliff of dolphins, Pirangi do Norte, Redinha, Pipa and Genipabu with its famous fixed sand dunes and imported dromedaries, tourism is the most important industry of Natal, attracting Brazilians, Europeans (many from Spain, England, Scandinavia, Germany, Portugal, Italy and France), and U.S. citizens alike. There has been an increase of 211% in foreign tourism in Natal between 2002 and 2007 (for the same time period the increase of foreign tourism in Brazil was 62,8%); This is a due to the accessibility of Natal and the appeal Brazil has for an increasing number of tourists, clearly showing that Natal is the area leading the Brazilian tourism boom. Natal is the number one area receiving international investments in Brazil. Natal will benefit enormously from the massive future investments on the coastline.

It is also a relevant administrative center for the oil industry (Rio Grande do Norte being the second largest oil-producing state in Brazil). Thus, its Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) is a national scientific research pole on Oil Sciences (ranging from Geophysical to Law studies), supported mostly by Petrobras financing.

The fishing industry is strong (shark cartilage being a major export to Japan) as is the cultivation of tropical fruit, especially mangos, guavas, and cashews (the fruit and the nuts).

In fact, the largest cashew tree in the world is located near the coast in the neighborhood of Pirangi, south of the city center. This tree has a circumference of 500 metres and occupies an area of 7,300 m2, making it 70 times the size of average cashew trees.

The GDP for the city was R$206,832,516,000 (2019).

The per capita income for the city was R$26,972.28 in 2021.

Natal is connected to all the 167 municipalities of Rio Grande do Norte and dozens of locations and Potiguar districts, through the Passenger Bus Terminal of Natal (Terminal Rodoviário de Passageiros de Natal), located in the Eastern Zone of the city. All the accesses to the countryside of the state are through the Metropolitan region of Natal, composed of the municipalities of Ceará-Mirim, Emaús, Extremoz, Macaíba, Monte Alegre, Nísia Floresta, Parnamirim e São Gonçalo do Amarante. Buses with direct destinations to various Brazilian capitals also leave from the Passenger Bus Terminal of Natal. The cities with regular weekly schedules are: Belo Horizonte, Fortaleza, Goiânia, João Pessoa, Palmas, Recife, Salvador, São Luiz e Teresina.
===Bus===
Buses are the cheapest way to move around Natal. Passes or magnetic cards can be purchased beforehand, but it is easiest to pay the conductor. There are large buses, micro buses and vans, driving along the same streets, charging the same fares.

All the main touristic spots within Natal are well served by buses. People may expect to travel standing up on the big buses (not so with micros and vans). Typical waiting time is 15 min during the peak hours, up to one hour.

===Rail===
The Sistema de Trens Urbanos de Natal is a two-line commuter rail system that operates over 56 km of track, and served 3.7 million passengers in 2018.

===Taxi===
There are plenty of taxis in the city. Taxis are white cars and have a red plate. Fares are the same, regardless of how new and comfortable the car is.
Fares are regulated by the government. From 10:00 pm to 6:00 am at weekdays, and all hours at weekends (and, depending on a decree by the mayor, all times during the month of December), there is a 20% increase in fare prices, this is indicated by a number 2 showing in the fare meter. There are several tele-taxis companies in Natal.

===Buggy===

The dune buggy is the vehicle used most to drive along the beaches. Some companies offer tours in Land Rovers and other 4WD vehicles, these cars offer much more comfort, but buggy drivers claim that the buggy is more flexible. Riding a buggy, people feel the sun and the wind. Buggies are safe, accidents with buggies are much less frequent than accidents with other cars (most dune buggy drivers are certified by the Tourist Authority).

<doc id="658283" wikidata="Q6642389" url="?curid=658283" title="Scoria">
<text>Scoria or cinder is a pyroclastic, highly vesicular, dark-colored volcanic rock formed by ejection from a volcano as a molten blob and cooled in the air to form discrete grains called clasts. It is typically dark in color (brown, black or purplish-red), and basaltic or andesitic in composition. Scoria has relatively low density, as it is riddled with macroscopic ellipsoidal vesicles (gas bubbles), but in contrast to pumice, scoria always has a specific gravity greater than 1 and sinks in water. 

Scoria may form as part of a lava flow, typically near its surface, or as fragmental ejecta (lapilli, blocks, and bombs), for instance in Strombolian eruptions that form steep-sided scoria cones, also called cinder cones. Scoria&#x27;s holes or vesicles form when gases dissolved in the original magma come out of solution as it erupts, creating bubbles in the molten rock, some of which are frozen in place as the rock cools and solidifies. Most scoria is composed of glassy fragments and may contain phenocrysts. A sample from Yemen was mainly composed of volcanic glass with a few zeolites (e.g., clinoptilolite). 

The geological term cinder is synonymous and interchangeable with &quot;scoria&quot;, though &quot;scoria&quot; is preferred in scientific literature. The word comes from Greek σκωρία, &quot;skōria&quot;, rust. In earlier terminology, scoria was usually defined with a size range, e.g. in diameter, but neither color nor composition was typically a part of the definition. During the 1980s, the size range disappeared from the definition, and a requirement was added that scoria be black or reddish in color and/or mafic in composition.

==Comparisons==
Scoria differs from pumice, another vesicular volcanic rock, in having larger vesicles and thicker vesicle walls, and hence is denser. The difference is probably the result of lower magma viscosity, allowing rapid volatile diffusion, bubble growth, coalescence, and bursting.

==Formation==
As rising magma encounters lower pressures, dissolved gases are able to and form vesicles. Some of the vesicles are trapped when the magma chills and solidifies. Vesicles are usually small, spheroidal and do not impinge upon one another; instead, they open into one another with minimal distortion.

Volcanic cones of scoria can be left behind after eruptions, usually forming mountains with a crater at the summit. An example is Maungarei in Auckland, New Zealand, which like Te Tatua-a-Riukiuta in the south of the same city has been extensively quarried. Quincan, a unique variety of scoria, is quarried at Mount Quincan in Far North Queensland, Australia.

==Uses==
Scoria is used for a variety of purposes. It is commonly mined for use as loose construction aggregate in Europe, the Southwestern United States, and Japan. Another major use of cinders is in manufacture of concrete and cinder blocks. 

Scoria is also used in the construction of flexible, long-lasting roadbeds, due to its high strength and high angles of internal friction. Because of its good insulating properties, such roadbeds protect the ground beneath them from frost heave and heat deformation. It is also spread as a traction aid on ice- and snow-covered roads, and around oil wells to firm up mud produced by heavy truck traffic.

Scoria is used in horticulture. Because it can hold water in its vesicles and in the pore space between grains in aggregates, it can improve the water-holding capacity of planting soils. When sorted to specific sizes and tightly packed, it is also an effective barrier against tunneling pests such as termites. Its striking colours and water-holding properties can make it attractive for landscaping and drainage works. 

Scoria can be used for high-temperature insulation, as in gas barbecue grills.

The ancient Romans used cinders as construction aggregates, one of the earliest industrial uses of volcanic rocks. On Rapa Nui/Easter Island, the quarry of Puna Pau was the source of reddish scoria used to carve the pukao (topknots) for the famous moai statues, and even for the main bodies of some moai.

<doc id="658286" wikidata="Q15249389" url="?curid=658286" title="Hellenistic-era warships">
<text>From the 4th century BC on, new types of oared warships appeared in the Mediterranean Sea, superseding the trireme and transforming naval warfare. Ships became increasingly large and heavy, including some of the largest wooden ships hitherto constructed. These developments were spearheaded in the Hellenistic Near East, but also to a large extent shared by the naval powers of the Western Mediterranean, specifically Carthage and the Roman Republic. While the wealthy successor kingdoms in the East built huge warships (&quot;polyremes&quot;), Carthage and Rome, in the intense naval antagonism during the Punic Wars, relied mostly on medium-sized vessels. At the same time, smaller naval powers employed an array of small and fast craft, which were also used by the ubiquitous pirates. Following the establishment of complete Roman hegemony in the Mediterranean after the Battle of Actium, the nascent Roman Empire faced no major naval threats. In the 1st century AD, the larger warships were retained only as flagships and were gradually supplanted by the light liburnians until, by Late Antiquity, the knowledge of their construction had been lost. 

==Terminology==
Most of the warships of the era were distinguished by their names, which were compounds of a number and a suffix. Thus the English term quinquereme derives from Latin and has the Greek equivalent (). Both are compounds featuring a prefix meaning &quot;five&quot;: Latin , ancient Greek (). The Roman suffix is from , &quot;oar&quot;: hence &quot;five-oar&quot;. As the vessel cannot have had only five oars, the word must be a figure of speech meaning something else. There are a number of possibilities. The -ηρης occurs only in suffix form, deriving from (), &quot;(I) row&quot;. As &quot;rower&quot; is () and &quot;oar&quot; is (), &quot;-ērēs&quot; does not mean either of those but, being based on the verb, must mean &quot;rowing&quot;. This meaning is no clearer than the Latin. Whatever the &quot;five-oar&quot; or the &quot;five-row&quot; originally meant was lost with knowledge of the construction, and is, from the 5th century on, a hotly debated issue. For the history of the interpretation efforts and current scholarly consensus, see below.

== Evolution of design ==
In the great wars of the 5th century BC, such as the Persian Wars and the Peloponnesian War, the trireme was the heaviest type of warship used by the Mediterranean navies. The trireme (Greek: (), &quot;three-oared&quot;) was propelled by three banks of oars, with one oarsman each. During the early 4th century BC, however, variants of the trireme design began to appear: invention of the quinquereme (Gk.: (), &quot;five-oared&quot;) and the hexareme (Gk. &quot;hexērēs&quot;, &quot;six-oared&quot;) is credited by the historian Diodorus Siculus to the tyrant Dionysius I of Syracuse, while the quadrireme (Gk. &quot;tetrērēs&quot;, &quot;four-oared&quot;) was credited by Aristotle to the Carthaginians.

=== Oar system ===
Far less is known with certainty about the construction and appearance of these ships than about the trireme. Literary evidence is fragmentary and highly selective, and pictorial evidence unclear. The fact that the trireme had three levels of oars (&quot;trikrotos naus&quot;) led medieval historians, long after the specifics of their construction had been lost, to speculate that the design of the &quot;four&quot;, the &quot;five&quot; and the other later ships would proceed logically, i.e. that the quadrireme would have four rows of oars, the quinquereme five, etc. However, the eventual appearance of bigger polyremes (&quot;sixes&quot; and later &quot;sevens&quot;, &quot;eights&quot;, &quot;nines&quot;, &quot;tens&quot;, and even a massive &quot;forty&quot;), made this theory implausible. Consequently, during the Renaissance and until the 19th century, it came to be believed that the rowing system of the trireme and its descendants was similar to the &quot;alla sensile&quot; system of the contemporary galleys, comprising multiple oars on each level, rowed by one oarsman each. 20th-century scholarship disproved that theory, and established that the ancient warships were rowed at different levels, with three providing the maximum practical limit. The higher numbers of the &quot;fours&quot;, &quot;fives&quot;, etc. were therefore interpreted as reflecting the number of files of oarsmen on each side of the ship, and not an increased number of rows of oars.

The most common theory on the arrangement of oarsmen in the new ship types is that of &quot;double-banking&quot;, i.e., that the quadrireme was derived from a bireme (warship with two rows of oars) by placing two oarsmen on each oar, the quinquereme from a trireme by placing two oarsmen on the two uppermost levels (the &quot;thranitai&quot; and &quot;zygitai&quot;, according to Greek terminology), and the later hexareme by placing two rowers on every level. Other interpretations of the quinquereme include a bireme warship with three and two oarsmen on the upper and lower oar banks, or even a monoreme (warship with a single level of oars) with five oarsmen. The &quot;double-banking&quot; theory is supported by the fact that the 4th-century quinqueremes were housed in the same ship sheds as the triremes, and must therefore have had similar width (), which fits with the idea of an evolutionary progression from the one type to the other.

The reasons for the evolution of the polyremes are not very clear. The most often forwarded argument is one of lack of skilled manpower: the trireme was essentially a ship built for ramming, and successful ramming tactics depended chiefly on the constant maintenance of a highly trained oar crew, something which few states aside from Athens with its radical democracy had the funds or the social structure to do. Using multiple oarsmen reduced the number of such highly trained men needed in each crew: only the rower at the tip of the oar had to be sufficiently trained, and he could then lead the others, who simply provided additional motive power. This system was also in use in Renaissance galleys, but jars with the evidence of ancient crews continuing to be thoroughly trained by their commanders. The increased number of oarsmen also required a broader hull, which on the one hand reduced the ships&#x27; speed, but on the other offered several advantages: larger vessels could be strengthened to better withstand ramming, while the wider hull increased their carrying capacity, allowing more marines, and eventually catapults, to be carried along. The decks of these ships were also higher above the waterline, while their increased beam afforded them extra stability, making them superior missile platforms. This was an important fact in an age where naval engagements were increasingly decided not by ramming but by less technically demanding boarding actions. It has even been suggested by Lionel Casson that the quinqueremes used by the Romans in the Punic Wars of the 3rd century were of the monoreme design (i.e., with one level and five rowers on each oar), being thus able to carry the large contingent of 120 marines attested for the Battle of Ecnomus.

An evolution to larger ships was also desirable because they were better able to survive a bow-on-bow ramming engagement, which allowed for increased tactical flexibility over the older, smaller ships which were limited to broad-side ramming. Once bigger ships had become common, they proved their usefulness in siege operations against coastal cities, such as the siege of Tyre by Alexander the Great, as well as numerous siege operations carried out by his successors, such as the siege of Rhodes by Demetrius Poliorcetes.

=== Construction ===

There were two chief design traditions in the Mediterranean, the Greek and the Punic (Phoenician/Carthaginian) one, which was later copied by the Romans. As exemplified in the trireme, the Greeks used to project the upper level of oars through an outrigger (&quot;parexeiresia&quot;), while the later Punic tradition heightened the ship, and had all three tiers of oars projecting directly from the side hull.

Based on iconographic evidence from coins, Morrison and Coates have determined that the Punic triremes in the 5th and early 4th centuries BC were largely similar to their Greek counterparts, most likely including an outrigger. From the mid-4th century, however, at about the time the quinquereme was introduced in Phoenicia, there is evidence of ships without outriggers. This would have necessitated a different oar arrangement, with the middle level placed more inwards, as well as a different construction of the hull, with side-decks attached to it. From the middle of the 3rd century BC onwards, Carthaginian &quot;fives&quot; display a separate &quot;oar box&quot; that contained the rowers and that was attached to the main hull. This development of the earlier model entailed further modifications, meaning that the rowers would be located above deck, and essentially on the same level. This would allow the hull to be strengthened, and have increased carrying capacity in consumable supplies, as well as improve the ventilation conditions of the rowers, an especially important factor in maintaining their stamina, and thereby improving the ship&#x27;s maintainable speed. It is unclear however whether this design was applied to heavier warships, and although the Romans copied the Punic model for their quinqueremes, there is ample iconographic evidence of outrigger-equipped warships used until the late imperial period.

In the Athenian Sicilian Expedition of 415–413 BC, it became apparent that the topmost tier of rowers, the &quot;thranitai&quot;, of the &quot;aphract&quot; (un-decked and unarmoured) Athenian triremes were vulnerable to attack by arrows and catapults. Given the prominence of close-quarters boarding actions in later years, vessels were built as &quot;cataphract&quot; ships, with a closed hull to protect the rowers, and a full deck able to carry marines and catapults.

== Heavy warships ==
=== Quadrireme ===

Pliny the Elder reports that Aristotle ascribed the invention of the quadrireme (; , ) to the Carthaginians. Although the exact date is unknown, it is most likely the type was developed in the latter half of the 4th century BC. Their first attested appearance is at the Siege of Tyre by Alexander the Great in 332 BC, and a few years later, they appear in the surviving naval lists of Athens. In the period after Alexander&#x27;s death (323 BC), the quadrireme proved very popular: the Athenians made plans to build 200 of these ships, and 90 out of 240 ships of the fleet of Antigonus I Monophthalmus ( BC) were &quot;fours&quot;. Subsequently, the quadrireme was favoured as the main warship of the Rhodian navy, the sole professional naval force in the Eastern Mediterranean. In the Battle of Naulochus in 36 BC, &quot;fours&quot; were the most common ship type fielded by the fleet of Sextus Pompeius, and several ships of this kind are recorded in the two praetorian fleets of the Imperial Roman navy.

It is known from references from both the Second Punic War and the Battle of Mylae that the quadrireme had two levels of oarsmen, and was therefore lower than the quinquereme, while being of about the same width (). Its displacement must have been around 60 tonnes, and its carrying capacity at marines. It was especially valued for its great speed and manoeuvrability, while its relatively shallow draught made it ideal for coastal operations. The &quot;four&quot; was classed as a &quot;major ship&quot; (&quot;maioris formae&quot;) by the Romans, but as a light craft, serving alongside triremes, in the navies of the major Hellenistic kingdoms like Egypt.

=== Quinquereme ===

Perhaps the most famous of the Hellenistic-era warships, because of its extensive use by the Carthaginians and Romans, the quinquereme (; , ) was invented by the tyrant of Syracuse, Dionysius I ( BC) in 399 BC, as part of a major naval armament program directed against the Carthaginians. During most of the 4th century, the &quot;fives&quot; were the heaviest type of warship, and often used as flagships of fleets composed of triremes and quadriremes. Sidon had them by 351, and Athens fielded some in 324.

In the eastern Mediterranean, they were superseded as the heaviest ships by the massive polyremes that began appearing in the last two decades of the 4th century, but in the West, they remained the mainstay of the Carthaginian navy. When the Roman Republic, which hitherto lacked a significant navy, was embroiled in the First Punic War with Carthage, the Roman Senate set out to construct a fleet of 100 quinqueremes and 20 triremes. According to Polybius, the Romans seized a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme and used it as a blueprint for their own ships, but it is stated that the Roman copies were heavier than the Carthaginian vessels, which were better built. The quinquereme provided the workhorse of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets throughout their conflicts, although &quot;fours&quot; and &quot;threes&quot; are also mentioned. Indeed, so ubiquitous was the type that Polybius uses it as a shorthand for &quot;warship&quot; in general.

According to Polybius, at the Battle of Cape Ecnomus, the Roman quinqueremes carried a total crew of 420, 300 of whom were rowers, and the rest marines. Leaving aside a deck crew of men, and accepting the 2–2–1 pattern of oarsmen, the quinquereme would have 90 oars in each side, and 30-strong files of oarsmen. The fully decked quinquereme could also carry a marine detachment of 70 to 120, giving a total complement of about 400. A &quot;five&quot; would be long, displace around 100 tonnes, be some 5 m wide at water level, and have its deck standing above the sea. Polybius said the quinquereme was superior to the old trireme, which was retained in service in significant numbers by many smaller navies. Accounts by Livy and Diodorus Siculus also show that the &quot;five&quot;, being heavier, performed better than the triremes in bad weather.

The Republic of Venice in the 1520s built what was called a quinquereme based on the design of Vettor Fausto, who based it on his readings of classical texts.

=== Hexareme ===

The hexareme or sexireme (; , ) is affirmed by the ancient historians Pliny the Elder and Aelian to have been invented in Syracuse. &quot;Sixes&quot; were certainly present in the fleet of Dionysius II of Syracuse ( BC), but they may well have been invented in the last years of his father, Dionysius I. &quot;Sixes&quot; were rarer than smaller vessels, and appear in the sources chiefly as flagships: at the Battle of Ecnomus, the two Roman consuls each had a hexareme, Ptolemy XII ( BC) had one as his personal flagship, as did Sextus Pompeius. At the Battle of Actium, hexaremes were present in both fleets, but with a notable difference: while in the fleet of Octavian they were the heaviest type of vessel, in the fleet of Mark Antony they were the second smallest, after the quinqueremes. A single hexareme, the &quot;Ops&quot;, is later recorded as the heaviest ship serving in the praetorian Fleet of Misenum.

The exact arrangement of the hexareme&#x27;s oars is unclear. If it evolved naturally from the earlier designs, it would be a trireme with two rowers per oar; the less likely alternative is that it had two levels with three oarsmen at each. Reports about &quot;sixes&quot; used during the 1st-century BC Roman civil wars indicate that they were of a similar height to the quinqueremes, and record the presence of towers on the deck of a &quot;six&quot; serving as flagship to Marcus Junius Brutus.

=== Septireme ===
Pliny the Elder attributes the creation of the septireme (; , ) to Alexander the Great. Curtius corroborates this, and reports that the king gave orders for wood for 700 septiremes to be cut in Mount Lebanon, to be used in his projected circumnavigations of the Arabian peninsula and Africa. For Salamis, Demetrius Poliorcetes had seven such ships built in Phoenicia and, later, Ptolemy II ( BC) had 36 septiremes constructed. Pyrrhus of Epirus ( BC) also apparently had at least one &quot;seven&quot;, which was captured by the Carthaginians and eventually lost at Mylae.

Presumably, the septireme was derived by adding a standing rower to the lower level of the hexareme.

=== Octeres ===

Very little is known about the octeres (, ). At least two of their type were in the fleet of Philip V of Macedon ( BC) at the Battle of Chios in 201 BC, where they were rammed in their prows. Their last appearance was at Actium, where Mark Antony is said by Plutarch to have had many &quot;eights&quot;. Based on the comments of Orosius that the larger ships in Antony&#x27;s fleet were only as high as the quinqueremes (their deck standing at above water), it is presumed that &quot;eights&quot;, as well as the &quot;nines&quot; and &quot;tens&quot;, were rowed at two levels.

An exceptionally large &quot;eight&quot;, the Leontophoros, is recorded by Memnon of Heraclea to have been built by Lysimachus ( BC), one of the Diadochi. It was richly decorated, required 1,600 rowers (8 files of 100 per side) and could support 1,200 marines. Remarkably for a ship of its size, its performance at sea was reportedly very good. The Romans used similar ships as troop carriers and flagships.

=== Enneres ===
The () is first recorded in 315 BC, when three of their type were included in the fleet of Antigonus Monophthalmus. The presence of &quot;nines&quot; in Antony&#x27;s fleet at Actium is recorded by Florus and Cassius Dio, although Plutarch makes explicit mention only of &quot;eights&quot; and &quot;tens&quot;. The oaring system may have been a modification of the quadrireme, with two teams of five and four oarsmen.

=== Deceres ===
Like the septireme, the (, ) is attributed by Pliny to Alexander the Great, and they are present alongside &quot;nines&quot; in the fleet of Antigonus Monophthalmus in 315 BC. Indeed, it is most likely that the &quot;ten&quot; was derived from adding another oarsman to the &quot;nine&quot;. A &quot;ten&quot; is mentioned as Philip V&#x27;s flagship at Chios in 201 BC, and their last appearance was at Actium, where they constituted Antony&#x27;s heaviest ships.

=== Larger polyremes ===

The tendency to build ever bigger ships that appeared in the last decades of the 4th century did not stop at the &quot;ten&quot;. Demetrius Poliorcetes built &quot;elevens&quot;, &quot;thirteens&quot;, &quot;fourteens&quot;, &quot;fifteens&quot; and &quot;sixteens&quot;, and his son, Antigonus II Gonatas had an &quot;eighteen&quot;, while Ptolemy II&#x27;s navy fielded 14 &quot;elevens&quot;, 2 &quot;twelves&quot;, 4 &quot;thirteens&quot;, and even one &quot;twenty&quot; and two &quot;thirties&quot;. Eventually, Ptolemy IV built a &quot;forty&quot; () that was long, required 4,000 rowers and 400 other crew, and could support a force of 2,850 marines on its decks. However, &quot;tens&quot; seem to be the largest to have been used in battle.

The larger polyremes were possibly double-hulled catamarans. It has been suggested that, with the exception of the &quot;forty&quot;, these ships must have been rowed at two levels.

== Light warships ==
Several types of fast vessels were used during this period, the successors of the 6th and 5th-century BC triacontors (τριακόντοροι, &quot;triakontoroi&quot;, &quot;thirty-oars&quot;) and pentecontors (πεντηκόντοροι, &quot;pentēkontoroi&quot;, &quot;fifty-oars&quot;). Their primary use was in piracy and scouting, but they also found their place in the battle line.
===Lembos===
The term &quot;lembos&quot; (from , &quot;skiff&quot;, in Latin &quot;lembus&quot;) is used generically for boats or light vessels, and more specifically for a light warship, most commonly associated with the vessels used by the Illyrian tribes, chiefly for piracy, in the area of Dalmatia. This type of craft was also adopted by Philip V of Macedon, and soon after by the Seleucids, Rome, and even the Spartan king Nabis in his attempt to rebuild the Spartan navy.

In contemporary writings, the name was associated with a class rather than a specific type of vessels, as considerable variation is evident in the sources: the number of oars ranged from 16 to 50, they could be one- or double-banked, and some types did not have a ram, presumably being used as couriers and fast cargo vessels.

=== Hemiolia ===
The &quot;hemiolia&quot; or &quot;hemiolos&quot; ( or ) was a light and fast warship that appeared in the early 4th century BC. It was particularly favoured by pirates in the eastern Mediterranean, but also used by Alexander the Great as far as the rivers Indus and Hydaspes, and by the Romans as a troop transport. It is likely that the type was invented by pirates, probably in Caria. 

Little is known of their characteristics, but Arrian, based on Ptolemy I (r. 323–283 BC), includes them amongst the triacontors. According to one view, it was manned by half the number of oarsmen to make room for the fighters. According to another, there were one and a half files of oarsmen on each side, with the additional half file placed amidships, where the hull was wide enough to accommodate them. In this view, they could have had 15 oars on each side, with a full file of ten and a half file of five or instead the middle oars may have been double-manned. Given their lighter hulls, greater length and generally slimmer profile, the hemiolia would have had an advantage in speed even over other light warships like the liburnian.

=== Trihemiolia ===

The &quot;trihemiolia&quot; () first appears in accounts of the Siege of Rhodes by Demetrius Poliorcetes in 304 BC, where a squadron of &quot;trihemioliai&quot; was sent out as commerce raiders. The type was one of the chief vessels of the Rhodian navy, and it is very likely that it was also invented there, as a counter to the pirates&#x27; swift &quot;hemioliai&quot;. So great was the attachment of the Rhodians to this type of vessel, that for a century after their navy was abolished by Gaius Cassius Longinus in 46 BC, they kept a few as ceremonial vessels.

The type was classed with the trireme, and had two and a half files of oarsmen on each side. Judging from the Lindos relief and the famous Nike of Samothrace, both of which are thought to represent &quot;trihemioliai&quot;, the two upper files would have been accommodated in an oarbox, with the half-file located beneath them in the classic &quot;thalamitai&quot; position of the trireme. The Lindos relief also includes a list of the crews of two &quot;trihemioliai&quot;, allowing us to deduce that each was crewed by 144 men, 120 of whom were rowers (hence a full file numbered 24). Reconstruction based on the above sculptures shows that the ship was relatively low, with a boxed-in superstructure, a displacement of tonnes, and capable of reaching speeds comparable with those of a full trireme. The &quot;trihemiolia&quot; was a very successful design, and was adopted by the navies of Ptolemaic Egypt and Athens among others. Despite being classed as lighter warships, they were sometimes employed in a first-line role, for instance at the Battle of Chios.

=== Liburnians ===
The liburnian (, , &quot;libyrnis&quot;) was a variant of &quot;lembos&quot; invented by the tribe of the Liburnians. Initially used for piracy and scouting, this light and swift vessel was adopted by the Romans during the Illyrian Wars, and eventually became the mainstay of the fleets of the Roman Empire following Actium, displacing the heavier vessels. Especially the provincial Roman fleets were composed almost exclusively of liburnians. Livy, Lucan and Appian all describe the liburnian as bireme; they were fully decked (cataphract) ships, with a sharply pointed prow, providing a more streamlined shape designed for greater speed. In terms of speed, the liburnian was probably considerably slower than a trireme, but on a par with a &quot;five&quot;.

<text>Mount Aspiring National Park is in the Southern Alps of the South Island of New Zealand, north of Fiordland National Park, situated in Otago and Westland regions. The park forms part of the Te Wahipounamu World Heritage Site.

== History ==
Mount Aspiring National Park was established in 1964 as New Zealand&#x27;s tenth national park.

===Expansion===
====Landsborough Station addition====
In April 2005 the Nature Heritage Fund purchased private land in the Landsborough River valley as an addition to the park.

====Milford Sound tunnel proposal====
In 2006, the Milford Dart Company asked the Department of Conservation to amend the Mt Aspiring National Park Management Plan to allow an additional road within the park for a bus tunnel, the so-called Milford Tunnel, from the Routeburn Road to the Hollyford Valley to take tourists to Milford Sound. The tunnel would have established a connection via Glenorchy and would have significantly reduced the current return travel time from Queenstown to Milford Sound of 9 hours.

In December 2007, the New Zealand Conservation Authority declined to adopt the amendment to the Management Plan. The Conservation Authority considered the proposed road would not add to the use and enjoyment of Mount Aspiring National Park and that the adverse effects of construction and use of the road in the National Park would outweigh any benefits.

The proposal gained approval in principle by the Department of Conservation in 2011, but was rejected by the Minister of Conservation, Nick Smith, in July 2013. Smith stated that &quot;the proposal was beyond what was appropriate for a World Heritage Area.&quot; The managing director of the company behind the proposal stated that he was &quot;disappointed of course. National trying to out-green the greens. Going skiing.&quot;

===Recent history===
====Mining proposal====
In 2009 the National-led government of New Zealand indicated that Mount Aspiring National Park may be opened up to mining. Around 20% of the total area of the park, mainly in the western portions around the Red Hill Range, and the north eastern parts, could be removed from the park and mined. Prospectors here are particularly interested in carbonatite deposits including rare earth elements and tungsten. The Green Party warned that the park is one of New Zealand&#x27;s main tourism drawcards, and that mining here could do significant damage to the country&#x27;s image.

==Geography==
Mount Aspiring National Park covers at the southern end of the Southern Alps, directly to the west of Lake Wānaka, and is popular for tramping, walking and mountaineering. Mount Aspiring / Tititea, elevation above sea level, gives the park its name.
Other prominent peaks within the park include Mount Pollux, elevation , and Mount Brewster, elevation .

The Haast Pass, one of the three principal road routes over the Southern Alps, crosses the north-eastern corner of the park.

=== Glaciers ===
Mount Aspiring is still home to over 100 glaciers, that contributed to the formation of the valleys in the national park. U-shaped valleys with steep sides can be found throughout Mount Aspiring National Park, which was formed through glaciation in the region 16,000 –18,000 years ago during the Ōtira Ice Age.

==Conservation and human interaction==
=== Visitor centre ===

The Mount Aspiring National Park visitor centre is located in Wānaka on the Corner of Ardmore St and Ballentyne Rd.

===Activities===
Popular tramping and hiking tracks in the park include:
* Cascade Saddle Track
* Gillespie Pass circuit
* Matukituki Valley
* Routeburn Track
* Rees and Dart Tracks

<text>Mount Aspiring / Tititea is New Zealand&#x27;s 23rd-highest mountain. The peak&#x27;s altitude of makes it the country&#x27;s highest outside the Aoraki / Mount Cook region.

==Names==
Māori named it &quot;Tititea&quot;, after a chief of the Waitaha iwi, who were the first people to settle the South Island.

It was named &quot;Aspiring&quot; in December 1857 by the Chief Surveyor for the Otago Province, John Turnbull Thomson.

It is also often called &quot;the Matterhorn of the South&quot;, for its pyramidal peak when seen from the Matukituki River.

The mountain&#x27;s name was used for the surrounding Mount Aspiring National Park at its creation in 1964.

The mountain&#x27;s official name was updated to Mount Aspiring / Tititea in 1998, by the Treaty Settlement Legislation Section 269 and Schedule 96 of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998.

==Location ==
Mount Aspiring / Tititea sits slightly to the west of the main divide, 30 kilometres west of Lake Wānaka. It lies at the junction of three major glacial systems – the Bonar Glacier, which drains into the Waipara River, and the Volta and Therma glaciers, which both drain into the Waiatoto River. The Waipara is a tributary of the Arawhata River, and both the Arawhata and Waitoto Rivers flow out to the West Coast in between Haast and Jackson Bay.

==Climbing==
The first ascent was on 23 November 1909 by Major Bernard Head and guides Jack Clarke and Alec Graham. Head&#x27;s party climbed to the summit ridge by the west face from the Bonar Glacier, a route not repeated until 1965.

The most used route to Mount Aspiring is up the West Matukituki Valley, which is at the end of a 50-kilometre road from Wānaka at Raspberry Flat. From here a network of huts provide staging points for climbers.

The first is Mount Aspiring Hut, which is 8 kilometres (or approximately two hours&#x27; walk) from the end of the road. The next hut is an 8-12hr hike away that is mainly off trail. The trail only provides a route for the first half of the approach that winds through the flat valley floor. From the end of the trail one can either ascend the French Ridge and traverse the Bonar Glacier, or ascend Bevan Col to the Bonar Glacier. Both require good route finding skills and knowledge of rock climbing techniques and glacial travel. Many climbers opt to fly in via helicopter because of the gruelling approach.

The mountain and park are popular with climbers and trampers, so has experienced a number of accidents and deaths.

<doc id="658315" wikidata="Q510336" url="?curid=658315" title="Louis François, Prince of Conti">
<text>Louis François de Bourbon, or Louis François I, Prince of Conti (13 August 1717 – 2 August 1776), was a French nobleman who became the Prince of Conti from 1727 to his death, succeeding his father, Louis Armand II de Bourbon. His mother was Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon, the daughter of Louis III, Prince of Condé and Louise Françoise de Bourbon, a legitimized daughter of King Louis XIV of France. His younger sister, Louise Henriette de Bourbon, was the mother of &quot;Philippe Égalité&quot;. As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, he was a Prince du Sang.

==Biography==
Louis François I de Bourbon was born in Paris.

In 1731, he married Louise Diane d&#x27;Orléans, &quot;Mademoiselle de Chartres&quot; (the first-cousin of his mother Louise Élisabeth, through her mother), who was the youngest daughter of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans (the Régent of France during the minority of King Louis XV of France) and his wife, Françoise-Marie de Bourbon, the daughter of King Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan.

His mother, the Dowager Princess of Conti, and future mother-in-law, the Dowager Duchess of Orléans, organized his marriage. However, the short marriage ended when Louis François&#x27;s wife died giving birth to a stillborn child at the Château d&#x27;Issy in 1736. He then stayed at the Château de L&#x27;Isle-Adam near Paris. In 1740, he proposed a marriage with the king&#x27;s second daughter, Henriette of France (1727–1752), to the king, who turned down Louis François&#x27; request.

===Military career===
Louis François also pursued a military career and he accompanied the Duke of Belle-Isle to Bohemia when the War of the Austrian Succession broke out in 1741. His services there led to his command of the army in Italy, where he distinguished himself by forcing the pass of Villafranca and winning the battle of Coni in 1744.

In 1745, he was sent to check the Austrians in Germany. In 1746, he was transferred to the Netherlands and led the successful siege of Mons, but conflicts with the Maréchal de Saxe led to his retirement in 1747 to the Château de L&#x27;Isle-Adam.

In 1760, he bought a famous Burgundy vineyard, which then bore the name of La Romanée, at a high price. After the purchase, he added his own name to the vineyard and it has been known as Romanée-Conti since then. This vineyard produces some of the world&#x27;s most expensive wine today.

===Candidate for the Polish throne and court influence===

In that same year, a faction of Polish nobles offered Conti the throne of Poland, where King Augustus III was expected to die soon. Conti was able to win the personal support of Louis XV of France for his candidacy. However, the policy of the king&#x27;s ministers was to establish the ruling house of Saxony upon the throne in Poland, as Louis XV&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Marie-Josèphe of Saxony, was a daughter of the ailing Augustus. As a result of this conflict, Louis XV began secret communications with his ambassadors at certain influential foreign courts that opposed the official communications being sent to those same ambassadors by his ministers. The system of couriers used to relay the king&#x27;s secret messages developed later into a spy-network known as the &quot;Secret du Roi&quot;.

Although Conti did not secure the Polish throne, he did remain in the confidence of the king until 1755, when Madame de Pompadour destroyed his influence through her intrigues at court. His relationship with Louis XV deteriorated enough that when the Seven Years&#x27; War broke out in 1756, Conti was refused the command of the army of the Rhine. Angry, he began opposing the royal government, which caused Louis to refer to him as, &quot;my cousin, the advocate&quot;.

In 1771, Conti took the lead in opposing the chancellor, Maupeou. He supported the &quot;parlements&quot; against the government and was hostile to Turgot especially. Due to the intensity of his anti-government feelings, he was suspected of aiding an uprising which took place in Dijon in 1775.

===Later life===
He was exiled from court and, following involvement in a Frondiste association with Protestants and with the affairs of Parlement, Conti settled into stylish retirement as Grand Prior of the Knights of the Order of Malta, resident at the Palais du Temple in Le Marais.

Eventually, Conti accumulated a vast and celebrated art collection, which he housed in a special gallery at the Temple, having collected it mainly during the last twenty years of his life. This was dispersed by auction between April and June 1777, a sale which impacted the Parisian art market through the following decade. His collection included Michel Barthélemy Ollivier&#x27;s &quot;English Tea Served in the Salon des Glaces at the Palais du Temple&quot;, dated 1764, showing the infant Mozart at the clavichord (now in the Palace of Versailles).

Conti inherited literary tastes from his father, was a brave and skillful general, and a diligent student of military history. His mistress, the cultivated Comtesse de Boufflers (1725–1800), presided over a &quot;salon&quot; at his home in Paris, which attracted many men of letters. Through his mistress, he became a patron of Jean Jacques Rousseau.

His son, Louis François Joseph (1734–1814), succeeded him and became the last Prince of Conti.

<text>Tamariki School is the oldest &#x27;free school&#x27; in New Zealand and one of the oldest in the world. It was founded in 1966 by a group of parents and teachers interested in preventive mental health. It is located in the Christchurch suburb of Woolston.

Its name is the Māori word for young children.

==Special character==
Mistakes are regarded as important learning information and grading is never done. No adult has the right to demand to see the child’s work and such access is always under the child&#x27;s control. The children also have a very large measure of control over the environment; the adults in the school defer their need for a tidy environment to the child’s need to experience cause and effect; to experience why order is desirable.

The school is loosely modelled on Summerhill School.

Originally a private school, owned and operated by the parents, Tamariki integrated into the state system as a special character school in 1990.

== History ==
The Tamariki School was formed in 1966 by a group of parents and teachers who owned and operated the school, the school was formally opened in 1967. This group became the Proprietor of Tamariki School, and entered into an integration agreement with the Ministry of Education in 1990, to operate a state integrated primary school with a Special Character under the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975. In 2017 Tamariki Celebrated its 50th Jubilee.

<text>Prince of Conti (French: &quot;prince de Conti&quot;) was a French noble title, assumed by a cadet branch of the princely house of Bourbon-Condé.

==History==
The title derives its name from Conty, a small town in northern France, c. 35 km southwest of Amiens, which came into the Bourbon-Condé family by the marriage of Louis de Bourbon, first Prince of Condé, with Eleanor de Roye in 1551.

François de Bourbon (1558–1614), the third son of this marriage, was given the title of &quot;marquis de Conti&quot; and was later elevated to the rank of &quot;prince de Conti&quot;. He died in 1614 and the title lapsed, since his only child had predeceased him in 1610.

In 1629, the title of Prince of Conti was revived in favor of Armand de Bourbon (1629–1666), second son of Henry II, Prince of Condé, and brother of Louis, the &quot;Grand Condé&quot;. During the time that the House of Bourbon ruled France, from the reign of King Henry IV of France to the reign of King Louis-Philippe of the French, the Princes of Conti were considered to be &quot;princes du sang&quot; in the Kingdom of France. The holders of this title used the style of Serene Highness.

==Marquis and Princes of Conti==
* 1558-1614: marquis, then from 1581 onwards 1st prince François de Bourbon

At his death, the title was not passed on, for want of direct descendants. The title was bestowed in 1629 upon:

* 1629-1666 : 2nd prince Armand 
* 1666-1685 : 3rd prince Louis Armand I 
* 1685-1709 : 4th prince François Louis 
* 1709-1727 : 5th prince Louis Armand II 
* 1727-1776 : 6th prince Louis François I
* 1776-1814 : 7th prince Louis François II

At his death, the title was not passed on, for want of legitimate descendants.

<text>Louis François Joseph de Bourbon or Louis François II, Prince of Conti (; 1 September 1734 – 13 March 1814), was the last Prince of Conti, scion of a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon, whose senior branches ruled France until 1848.

Louis was the only child of his parents and lived a secluded childhood at his father&#x27;s chateau, after the death of his mother in 1736. He later married his first cousin, with the union producing no children. During the French Revolution he stayed in France until 1797 when he was exiled to Spain where he died in 1814, less than a month before his family were restored to the throne of France; with his death the house of Bourbon-Conti became extinct.

==Biography==
Born at the Hôtel de Conti (quai Conti) in Paris, on 1 September 1734, and baptised in the presence of the French king and queen, he succeeded his father, Louis François I de Bourbon, Prince of Conti, as head of the most junior branch of the House of Bourbon in 1776. His mother was Louise Diane d&#x27;Orléans, youngest daughter of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, Regent of France during the minority of King Louis XV of France.

From birth, he was known as the &quot;comte de La Marche&quot;. His mother died on 26 September 1736, giving birth to a later child who did not survive. After her death, his father retired from the Royal court to the &quot;Château de L&#x27;Isle-Adam&quot;, pursuing his love of hunting, although he would later emerge to have a distinguished military career.

On 17 May 1750, Louis François was made a knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit at Versailles. During the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), he took part as a maréchal de camp in the Battle of Hastenbeck in July 1757, and in the Battle of Krefeld in June 1758. 
He married his first cousin, Maria Fortunata d&#x27;Este, (1731–1803), fourth daughter of Francesco III d&#x27;Este, Duke of Modena and his wife, Charlotte Aglaé d&#x27;Orléans, who was his mother&#x27;s older sister; as such, Louis François Joseph was the first cousin of &quot;Philippe Égalité&quot;, through his father.

The marriage contract was signed in Milan on 3 January 1759 by the French ambassador to the court of Turin. A wedding by proxy took place in Milan on 7 February of the same year and was celebrated in person on 27 February at Nangis-en-Brie in France. Maria Fortunata&#x27;s father settled upon her a dowry of one million &quot;livres&quot;. In addition, upon her arrival in France her husband was given 150,000 &quot;livres&quot; by Louis XV. The young &quot;comtesse de La Marche&quot; was presented to the king and the rest of the royal family on 5 March 1759 by the Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon, Dowager Princess of Conti, Louis François&#x27; paternal grandmother. In 1770 they were one of twelve couples invited to dine with the newlyweds, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, in the Opéra of the Palace of Versailles, which had been constructed for the royal wedding.

The couple never had children. Louis François Joseph had two illegitimate children, born in 1761 and 1767, by Marie Anne Véronèse, known as &quot;Mademoiselle Coraline&quot;, previously a dancer at an Italian theatre. Among his other lovers was, notably, Anne Victoire Dervieux.

After the death of his father, he and his wife became officially separated on 12 June 1777, anticipating the extinction of the House of Bourbon-Conti. She retired to the Château de Triel. After fleeing France during the revolution, she travelled incognito as the &quot;comtesse de Triel&quot;, dying in Venice on 21 September 1803.

Pierre Beaumarchais noted in the preface to his 1778 play, The Marriage of Figaro (which satirized the aristocracy) that it was the &quot;late&quot; prince de Conti who requested the play be written, and Louis François Joseph&#x27;s antics may have been the model for the misadventures of &quot;Count Almaviva&quot;.

He took the side of Maupeou in the struggle between the chancellor and the &quot;parlements&quot;, and in 1788 declared that the integrity of the constitution must be maintained. He emigrated following the French Revolution, but refused to take part in plans for the invasion of France. He returned to his native country in 1790.

Arrested by order of the National Convention in 1793, he was acquitted, but was reduced to poverty by the confiscation of his possessions. He afterwards received a pension. In 1797, however, the &quot;Directoire&quot; decided to exile the last of the Bourbons. He was banished to Spain along with his few remaining relatives who still lived in France and had not already been killed in the revolution, including Bathilde d&#x27;Orléans, Duchess of Bourbon. Relegated to a place near Barcelona, he lived in poverty. Refusing to share in the plots of the Royalists, he lived an isolated existence in Barcelona until his death in 1814, whereupon the Princes of Conti became extinct.

He was first buried at the &quot;Iglesia de San Miguel&quot; in Barcelona prior to the Bourbon Restoration. During the reign of Louis Philippe I, he was removed from Saint-Michel and placed in the &quot;Chapelle royale de Dreux&quot; on 2 April 1844.

<text>John Baptist Banister (1654 – May 1692) was an English clergyman and one of the first university-trained naturalists in North America. His primary focus was botany but he also studied insects and molluscs. He was sent out as a missionary chaplain by the garden-loving Bishop Henry Compton, with whom he soon established a correspondence. Banister was first in Barbados in the West Indies and then by April 1679 in Virginia, where, while serving a rector of the parish of Charles City he became one of Bishop Compton&#x27;s most energetic plant collectors, &quot;the first Virginia botanist of any note&quot;.

Banister matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he could see and study the American plants grown from seed in the Oxford Physic Garden under the care of Dr. Robert Morison. From Virginia, his first letter to Dr Morison at the Oxford Physic Garden was dated 1679: in it he listed the bounty of American oaks that would supplement Britain&#x27;s impoverished flora: dwarf, black, white, red, Spanish, chestnut, live or willow, shrubby. The historian of American gardens Ann Leighton surmises that Banister&#x27;s list of Virginian timber trees provided some of the material for John Evelyn&#x27;s list of desirable plants of Virginia and New England, intended to be given to a captain sailing for New England. Once settled in Virginia, where he purchased a tract of on the Appomattox River in 1689/90, he established a close friendship with William Byrd of Westover, an influential Virginia planter with botanical connections in London. By 1692 Banister had become a substantial figure in Virginia, one of the founders of the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg that year; Bishop Compton was on the college&#x27;s board of overseers.

Banister contemplated writing a natural history of Virginia; perhaps it was as a preliminary gesture he sent some fine botanical drawings and herbarium specimens to the botanist James Petiver, a London apothecary and Fellow of the Royal Society. According to Jon Kukla Robert Beverley&#x27;s &quot;History and Present State of Virginia&quot; (London, 1705) reproduced extensive
passages on natural history and the Indians from manuscripts of Banister. Banister sent numerous occasional papers to the Royal Society that were published in its &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, providing &quot;the first scientific account for Virginia in the field of descriptive botany, entomology, and malacology. His letter describing &quot;Mutinus elegans&quot;, a stinkhorn, is thought to be the first report of a fungus from North America. Among them were &quot;Observations on the natural productions of Jamaica&quot;; &quot;The Insects of Virginia&quot; (with James Petiver,1700); &quot;Curiosities in Virginia&quot;; &quot;Observations on the &quot;Musca lupus&quot;&quot;; &quot;On Several Sorts of Snails&quot; ; and &quot;A Description of the Snakeroot, Pistolochia or Serpentaria Virginiania.&quot; He compiled a catalogue of American plants, the first &quot;flora&quot; of North America; it was published in the second volume of John Ray&#x27;s &quot;Historia Plantarum&quot; (London, 1688-1704), a comprehensive catalog of plant taxonomy. He was accidentally shot dead by Jacob Colson while exploring the lower Roanoke River in company with some men of Byrd&#x27;s entourage. John Lawson in his &quot;New Voyage to Carolina&quot; saluted Banister&#x27;s memory in 1709, as &quot;the greatest &quot;Virtuoso&quot; we ever had on this Continent&quot;.

Notable plants he collected and sent to his bishop, Henry Compton, in England included balsam fir (&quot;Abies balsamea&quot;), box elder (&quot;Acer negundo&quot;), honey locust (&quot;Gleditsia triacanthos&quot;), liquidambar (&quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot;), scarlet oak (&quot;Quercus coccinea&quot;), and Sweetbay magnolia (&quot;Magnolia virginiana&quot;).

Banister&#x27;s library in Virginia was dispersed after his death and his lists and papers found their way to publication through other botanists, beginning with James Petiver, whose &quot;Museum Petiveranum&quot; gives 65 common names for Banister&#x27;s plants sent to Bishop Compton, where Banister&#x27;s Virginian trees were flourishing in the gardens of Fulham Palace.

Banister was commemorated by Linnaeus who gave the name &quot;Banisteria&quot; to a tropical genus of Malpighiaceae. &quot;Banisteriopsis&quot; also references Banister&#x27;s name; the two genera are very close relatives and are sometimes merged under the older name &quot;Banisteria&quot;.

His grandson, Col. John Banister, was one of the prominent Virginians of the American Revolution.

<text>Robert Cutlar Fergusson (1768–1838) was a Scottish lawyer and politician. He was 17th Laird of the Dumfriesshire Fergussons, seated at Craigdarroch (Moniaive, Dumfriesshire).

==Life==
Robert Fergusson was born in Dumfries, the eldest son of Alexander Fergusson, Esq., of Craigdarroch and Orraland House, Kirkcudbrightshire, who was an eminent advocate. His great-grandfather was Alexander Fergusson, the husband of Annie Laurie of folksong fame. He was educated at Edinburgh and studied law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, being called to the bar in 1797.

He was gaoled for a year in the King&#x27;s Bench prison in the late 1790s for being associated with Arthur O&#x27;Connor and Father James Coigly, United Irishmen who were trying to coordinate a republican insurrection in Ireland, with radical circles in Britain and with the French Directory. On his release he decided it would be wise to leave the country and therefore moved to India where he worked as a barrister for some 30 years in the Supreme Court of Judicature at Calcutta. He was made acting Advocate-General of Bengal in 1817 when Edward Strettell left for England due to ill-health, holding the post until Robert Spankie arrived as Strettell&#x27;s successor. When Spankie returned to England in 1823, Fergusson succeeded him as Advocate-General.

On his return to Britain he was elected MP for the Stewardtry of Kirkcudbright in 1826, sitting until 1838. He was appointed a Privy Councillor in 1834 and Judge Advocate General from 1835 to 1838.

Dwarkanath Tagore, the great Bengal entrepreneur, was apprenticed under him in 1810, and Fergusson was one of the two leading influences in his life.

<text>is a style of Japanese Buddhist chant, used mainly in the Tendai and Shingon sects. There are two styles: &quot;ryokyoku&quot; and &quot;rikkyoku&quot;, described as difficult and easy to remember, respectively.

Shōmyō, like gagaku, employs the Yo scale, a pentatonic scale with ascending intervals of two, three, two, two, and three semitones.

<text>John Banister (1533–1610) was an English anatomist, surgeon and teacher. He published &quot;The Historie of Man, from the most approved Authorities in this Present Age&quot; in 1578.

==Life==
He attended Edward VI in his final illness.
He continued his professional life as surgeon to the forces sent under Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick in 1563 to relieve Le Havre. On this expedition he and William Clowes, another surgical author, began a friendship which lasted throughout their lives. Some time after his return he studied at Oxford, and received a license to practise in 1573. For several years he practised both physic and surgery at Nottingham.

The military expedition to the Low Countries under Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester in 1585 gave Banister another opportunity of public service, and he served on board a ship.

After the expedition he settled in London, living in Silver Street (which he mentions in his &quot;Antidotarie&quot; of 1589), not far from the Hall of the Barber-Surgeons. In 1588 he and Clowes are associated in the dedication of John Read&#x27;s &quot;Translation of Arceus&quot;. They saw many cases together, and in 1591 T. P., a patient of theirs, praised both surgeons in a bad English poem. Complaints were often made at that time to the College of Physicians as to surgeons practising medicine, and, perhaps in consequence of some such difficulty, Banister in 1593 obtained a royal letter of recommendation which led the college to grant him a license (15 February 1594) on the condition that in dangerous cases he should call in one of its fellows.

Banister was known for his kindness to the poor, especially to old soldiers, and for his extensive professional reading.

==Legacy==
He was buried in St Olave&#x27;s Church, Silver Street. The church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London. He had a long epitaph in English verse, which bears sufficient resemblance to some poems of Clowes to make it likely that it was written for Banister&#x27;s tomb by his old friend.

==Works==

He edited Hans Jacob Wecker, with corrections, &#x27;A Compendious Chyrurgerie gathered and translated (especially) out of Wecker,’ London, 1585. He compiled a collection of remedies and prescriptions, &#x27;An Antidotarie Chyrurgicall,’ London, 1589, in which he acknowledges the generous help of his contemporaries, George Baker, Robert Balthrop, Clowes, and Goodrus. He also published in folio &#x27;The History of Man, sucked from the Sap of the most approved Anatomists, 9 books, London, 1578.&#x27; Calametius, Tagaltius, and Wecker, three dry and unprofitable writers on surgery, form the basis of his writings. No cases from his own practice are given. In 1633, some time after Banister&#x27;s death, a collected edition of his surgical works was published, &#x27;The Workes of that Famous Chyrurgian, Mr. John Banester,’ in six books.

<text>The Radio Network Controller (RNC) is a governing element in the UMTS radio access network (UTRAN) and is responsible for controlling the Node Bs that are connected to it. The RNC carries out radio resource management, some of the mobility management functions and is the point where encryption is done before user data is sent to and from the mobile. The RNC connects to the Circuit Switched Core Network through Media Gateway (MGW) and to the SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) in the Packet Switched Core Network.

==Interfaces==

The logical connections between the network elements are known as interfaces. The interface between the RNC and the Circuit Switched Core Network (CS-CN) is called Iu-CS and between the RNC and the Packet Switched Core Network is called Iu-PS. Other interfaces include Iub (between the RNC and the Node B) and Iur (between RNCs in the same network). Iu interfaces carry user traffic (such as voice or data) as well as control information (see ), and Iur interface is mainly needed for soft handovers involving 2 RNCs though not required as the absence of Iur will cause these handovers to become hard handovers.

Until 3gpp R4, all the interfaces in the UTRAN are implemented using ATM only, except the Uu (air) interface which uses WCDMA technology. Starting R5, IP bearers can be used over Ethernet instead. Physically, these interfaces can be carried over SDH over optical fiber, E1 (sometimes referred to as PDH) - over a copper wire or microwave radio. Several E1s can be bundled to form an IMA Group. Since the interfaces are &quot;logical&quot;, many interfaces can be multiplexed onto the same transmission line. The actual implementation depends on the network topology; examples are chain, distant star, mesh and loop configurations.

==Protocols==
Iub, Iu and Iur protocols all carry both user data and signalling (that is, control plane). 
* Signalling protocol responsible for the control of the Node B by the RNC is called NBAP (Node-B Application Part). NBAP is subdivided into Common and Dedicated NBAP (C-NBAP and D-NBAP), where Common NBAP controls overall Node B functionality and Dedicated NBAP controls separate cells or sectors of the Node B. NBAP is carried over Iub. In order for NBAP to handle common and dedicated procedures, it is divided into: NodeB Control Port (NCP) which handles common NBAP procedures and Communication Control Port (CCP) which handles dedicated NBAP procedures.
* Control plane protocol for the transport layer is called ALCAP (Access Link Control Application Protocol). Basic functionality of ALCAP is multiplexing of different users onto one AAL2 transmission path using channel IDs (CIDs). ALCAP is carried over Iub and Iu-CS interfaces.
* Signalling protocol responsible for communication between RNC and the core network is called RANAP (Radio Access Network Application Part), and is carried over Iu interface.
* Signalling protocol responsible for communications between RNCs is called RNSAP (Radio Network Subsystem Application Part) and is carried on the Iur interface.

==RNC roles==
In a relationship to a UE (in a soft handover situation) an RNC can play two different roles. These are:
* D-RNC: Drift RNC
* S-RNC: Serving RNC

However, as far as the NodeB is concerned, the RNC may play a third role:
* C-RNC: Controlling RNC

It is important to know that one RNC can assume more than one role at any time.

An RNC also controls the power of a NodeB.

<doc id="658366" wikidata="Q2375388" url="?curid=658366" title="Yoshihiro Yasuda">
<text>is a Japanese lawyer known for his anti–death penalty activism. With death penalty being a prominent method of punishment for violent criminals in Japan, Yasuda has defended many of these cases. At the time when Yasuda took on many of these cases, such cases were considered detrimental to a lawyer&#x27;s career. He participated in many controversial trials because he believed that the suspects were tried unfairly as a result of mass media bashing.

== Background ==
Yoshihiro Yasuda was born in Hyogo Prefecture on December 4, 1947. He graduated Hitotsubashi University Faculty of Law in 1975. In 1977, Yasuda passed the bar exam, and in 1980, he officially became a lawyer after completing the Supreme Court Legal Research and Training Institute.

== Criminal cases ==
=== Shinjuku bus attack ===
Yasuda was one of the defenders of a Shinjuku bus attacker who killed six people in 1980. The attacker was not sentenced to death, but he died by suicide in 1997.

=== Japan Air Lines Flight 404 ===
Japan Air Lines Flight 404 was an airliner hijacked by Palestinian and Japanese terrorists on July 20, 1973. As of 1987, Yasuda was elected to the counsel of the accused (Osamu Maruoka). Osamu Maruoka was sentenced to life imprisonment.

=== Aum Shinrikyo ===
Shoko Asahara, the founder of the religious cult group Aum Shinrikyo, was trialed as the mastermind behind the crimes perpetrated by his followers, including the Tokyo subway sarin gas attack. Yasuda was the court-appointed attorney to defend Asahara in 1995, but was forced to resign from the team due to his arrest in 1998 . asserted that the arrest was made because prosecutors were dissatisfied with Yasuda&#x27;s court tactics to delay the trial as long as possible to avoid the likely death sentence on Asahara.

1,200 lawyers listed as Yasuda&#x27;s defenders, and Japan Federation of Bar Associations and Amnesty International protested that the arrest was unfair. After his legal complications were settled in 2003, Yasuda became Asahara&#x27;s private lawyer.

In September 15, 2006, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence on Asahara.

=== Masumi Hayashi ===
Yasuda defended Masumi Hayashi, who was convicted of putting poison in a pot of curry being served at a 1998 summer festival in the Sonobe district of Wakayama, Wakayama, Japan. Yasuda was asked by Kazuyoshi Miura, who was exchanging letters with Masumi Hayashi, to work on this trial. Despite Yasuda&#x27;s efforts, she was sentenced to death in 2002.

=== Hikari City homicides ===
Yasuda was the chief defender for a 19-year-old boy sentenced to death by the Hiroshima High Court in April 2008 for raping and strangling a woman to death and murdering her 1-year-old daughter in 1999 in Hikari city, Yamaguchi. This case has received much attention because of the circumstances of the crime and the possibility of the death penalty being imposed on a minor (the age of majority in Japan was 20 at the time). The Supreme Court ruled that perpetrator&#x27;s age at the time of the crime did not exempt him from the death penalty. Yasuda and the defense team tried to prevent the death penalty from being applied by claiming that the perpetrator did not intend to kill the woman or her baby. In March 2006, Yasuda and his group of attorneys were absent from the oral argument hearing for an unknown reason. The Japanese media considered their behavior as a tactic to delay the trial just as they did during the Asahara trial; the Supreme Court ordered them to attend the next hearing.

== Arrest ==
On December 6, 1998, Yasuda was arrested on charges of obstruction of justice (the compulsory seizure of rental income of one of the failed &quot;jusen&quot; mortgage lenders). Yasuda was charged with advising the Singaporean real estate developer Sun Chungli and his son Naoaki to set up a dummy company to hide assets. Sun was the president of Sun&#x27;s Corporation Tokyo Ltd., a major borrower from the several former, now obsolete &quot;jusen&quot; housing loan companies. Yasuda was accused by the police of conspiring with Sun to hide rental income of approximately 200 million yen by using a dummy company by the name of Wide Treasure. The police suspected that Yasuda instructed the Sun family on how to hide assets. Yasuda acknowledged that he became the legal advisor for Sun in 1991, but argued that he gave advice within a legal framework. Yasuda denied the charges, and claimed he had no involvement in the Wide Treasure operation while the Sun family pleaded guilty. Yasuda was acquitted in 2003.

== Yasuda on mass media ==
Yasuda&#x27;s reason for defending the accused who are labelled by society as highly vicious criminals is that he believes their chance of a fair trial is taken away by media bashings. Yasuda fears the recent trend by the media to label people as vicious villains to bury the possibility of a legitimate trial for the accused as a signal of a crisis of democracy in Japan. Yasuda criticizes the premise of modern Japanese law that deviates from justice as the need for assumed innocence has increasingly become a prerequisite for acquittal; he sees this as a crisis in the judicial system.

== Movies ==
, a documentary directed by Junichi Saito that explores the issue of capital punishment with a focus on Yasuda, was released in theaters on June 30, 2012. The movie is based on a TV show that aired midnights in 2011. The film was also screened at the Amnesty International Human Rights Documentary Film Show in Hong Kong.

<doc id="658376" wikidata="Q1061299" url="?curid=658376" title="Jet bridge">
<text>A jet bridge (also termed jetway, jetwalk, airgate, jetty, gangway, planeplank, aerobridge/airbridge, finger, skybridge, airtube, expedited suspended passenger entry system (E-SPES), or its official industry name passenger boarding bridge (PBB)) is an enclosed connector which most commonly extends from an airport terminal gate to an airplane, and in some instances from a port to a boat or ship, allowing passengers to board and disembark without heading outside and being exposed to harsh weather. Depending on building design, sill heights, fueling positions, and operational requirements, a jet bridge may be fixed or movable, swinging radially, or extending in length. The jetway was invented by Frank Der Yuen.

Similar devices are used for astronauts to enter spacecraft, which are installed at the appropriate height of the launch tower.

==History==
 

Before the introduction of jet bridges, passengers normally boarded an aircraft by walking along the ground-level ramp and climbing a set of movable stairs, or airstairs on aircraft so equipped. Mobile staircases or &quot;ramp stairs&quot; are employed at many airports around the world, particularly smaller airports and terminals supporting low cost carriers.

United Airlines tested an early prototype &quot;Air Dock&quot; in 1954. The first operational &quot;Aero-Gangplank&quot;, as it was dubbed by inventor Lockheed Air Terminal, was installed by United at Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare Airport in 1958.

==Advantages==
Jet bridges provide all-weather dry access to aircraft and enhance the security of terminal operations. They are often permanently attached at one end by a pivot (or rotunda) to the terminal building and have the ability to swing left or right. The cabin, at the end of the loading bridge, may be raised or lowered, extended or retracted, and may pivot, to accommodate aircraft of different sizes. These motions are controlled by an operator&#x27;s station in the cab. The cab is provided with an accordion-like canopy, which allows the bridge to dock with aircraft with differing shapes, and provide a nearly weather-proof seal. Additionally, many models offer leveling devices for the portion of the floor that makes contact with the aircraft; this allows passengers to slowly transition from level aircraft floor to sloping jet bridge floor. As such, jet bridges provide enhanced access to aircraft for passengers with many types of disabilities and mobility impairments, as they may board and disembark without climbing stairs or using a specialized wheelchair lift.

Some airports with international gates have two or even three bridges for larger aircraft with multiple entrances. In theory, this allows for faster disembarking of larger aircraft, though it is quite common, especially on aircraft such as Boeing 747s and Boeing 777s, to use one bridge for only passengers in first class and/or business class, while the other bridge is for the use of passengers in economy class. In some designs, the second jet bridge would even extend over the aircraft wing, being suspended from an overhead structure. This was, for example, originally adopted for most wide body gates at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The Airbus A380 is unique in that both of its two passenger decks have outside access doors and so using loading bridges for each deck is possible, having the advantage of faster aircraft loading (in parallel). Faster loading can lead to lower airport charges, fewer delays and more passenger throughput for the airport, all factors which impact an airline&#x27;s bottom line.

Though loading bridges are usually permanently attached at their terminal-building end, leaving only the cab free to move, this is not always the case. Those at Melbourne Airport&#x27;s international terminal, and at Hong Kong&#x27;s former Kai Tak Airport, are anchored in the middle and movable at either end to permit the terminal building-end to be raised or lowered to connect with either the departures level or the arrivals level of the terminal building.

==Disadvantages==
Loading bridges restrict aircraft parking to spots immediately adjacent to the terminal. Thus, airports use mobile staircases to facilitate disembarking at hardstands (remote parking positions) and have buses transporting passengers to terminals.

Loading bridges may pose hazards to aircraft if handled improperly. If the bridge is not retracted fully before departure, it may contact protruding parts of the taxiing aircraft (e.g., a pitot tube), requiring repair and delays. Furthermore, during cold weather, the loading bridge may become frozen to the aircraft. In this case, when the jet bridge retracts, it could damage the aircraft if that area has not been properly de-iced.

When regional jets are used, jet bridges have another disadvantage, since they allow only one aircraft to park at the gate at a time. Several airlines have removed jet bridges at regional jet gates at airports such as Atlanta which are short on gates. When having passengers disembark on the ramp or apron, airlines can fit two or more regional jets per gate. In many other places like Beijing Capital Airport and Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, a gate for large aircraft can be used to accommodate two smaller aircraft like Boeing 737s or Airbus A320s.

Several incidents of jet bridges collapsing include Sydney, Hong Kong, Seattle, Los Angeles, Baltimore, and Islamabad.

Airports frequently charge increased fees for using loading bridges on stands as opposed to mobile stairs, therefore low-cost airlines such as Ryanair have avoided using these wherever possible.

==Use at small airports==

Jet bridges are occasionally used at smaller, single-story airports. This is accomplished by a flight of stairs and, in some instances, a wheelchair lift. In this scenario, a passenger proceeds through the gate and then up a flight of stairs to meet the height of the jet bridge. An example of this can be found at South Bend International Airport. Alternatively, a ramp can be used in the terminal building to bring the passengers from the waiting area to the height of the jet bridge. For example, Sawyer International Airport in Marquette, Michigan has jet bridges that can load passengers onto smaller passenger aircraft such as the Saab 340 turboprop. The Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport has two gates using this approach. This can be done to attract larger airlines that require use of a jet bridge to the airport, as well as to make disembarking smaller planes easier for disabled people and to improve the disembarking process in bad weather.

==Use and appearance==
At the airport terminal, the bridge is connected to a portal (called a &quot;gate&quot;) in the terminal wall behind the gate desk. Once airplane boarding starts, passengers hand their boarding passes to the gate&#x27;s attendant, who lets them pass through.

Inside, the bridge looks like a narrow, lighted hallway, without doors. Loading bridges usually have no windows, but glass walls are becoming more common. The walls are normally painted in accordance with airline standards, generally with relaxing colours. Some bridges have advertisements on interior or exterior walls. The floors of retractable bridges are generally uneven, creating a hazard for wheelchair users and others with mobility issues.

By using a retractable tunnel design, loading bridges may retract and extend varying lengths. Some airports use fixed walkways to effectively extend the reach of a loading bridge. The fixed walkway extends out from the terminal building and connects to the loading bridge rotunda. Occasionally, fixed bridges lead to multiple loading bridges. There are some jetways (such as several older bridges on the north terminal at Edmonton International Airport) that sit directly on the ground, as opposed to supports. These jetways are often used by small airlines or airplanes that are sometimes too low for conventional jetways (such as the Dash 8 and CRJ).

The cab of the loading bridge is raised and lowered to dock with aircraft of differing sill heights. The height of the cab is matched to the height of the aircraft door sill height. This often results in a slope along the length of the loading bridge.

Controls in older systems contain a large number of individual motor control buttons, with efficient operation requiring a high degree of operator skill and experience. Modern control consoles are much simpler, with only a few buttons, a graphic display console, and a single multi-axis joystick, with an overall appearance similar to that of a video game console in a video arcade.

===Marketing===
Marketing space on jetways was uncommon until the early 2000s when HSBC launched their campaign &quot;The World&#x27;s Local Bank&quot;.

Peter Stringham, head of marketing for HSBC worldwide, worked closely with Lowe&#x27;s, the Group&#x27;s global agency, in developing the campaign which required a single global platform. Stringham noticed jetways were a global medium which had not been tapped.

HSBC thus bought the rights to jetways across major localities in 81 countries and territories.

<doc id="658390" wikidata="Q959404" url="?curid=658390" title="Eric Blore">
<text>Eric Blore Sr. (23 December 1887 – 2 March 1959) was an English actor and writer. His early stage career, mostly in the West End of London, centred on revue and musical comedy, but also included straight plays. He wrote sketches for and appeared in variety. 

In the 1930s Blore acted mostly in Broadway productions. He made his last London appearance in 1933 in the Fred Astaire hit &quot;Gay Divorce&quot;. Between 1930 and 1955 he made more than 60 Hollywood films, becoming particularly well known for playing butlers and other superior domestic servants. He retired in 1956 for health reasons, and died in Hollywood in 1959 at the age of 71.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Blore was born in Finchley, a north London suburb, on 23 December 1887, son of Henry Blore and his wife Mary, &quot;née&quot; Newton. He was educated at Mills School, Finchley, and after leaving school he worked for an insurance company. He was drawn to a theatrical career, and in 1908 he made his first appearance on the stage at the Spa Theatre, Bridlington in the musical comedy &quot;The Girl from Kays&quot;. In the same year he went to Australia, where he appeared with a concert party, &quot;The Merrymakers&quot;. In the English provinces he appeared in the musical comedy &quot;The Arcadians&quot; (1910), the pierrot show &quot;The March Hares&quot; (1911) and Barry Jackson and Basil Dean&#x27;s &quot;Fifinella&quot; (1912).

In April 1913 Blore made his first appearance in London, at the Empire, Leicester Square in C.H. Bovill&#x27;s revue &quot;All the Winners&quot;, in which he was praised by &quot;The Observer&quot;. He also appeared at the Empire in Bovill&#x27;s and P.G. Wodehouse&#x27;s revue &quot;Nuts and Wine&quot; (1914). During the First World War, Blore enlisted and served in the South Wales Borderers and later joined the Royal Flying Corps, before being assigned to run the 38th Divisional Concert Party in France (&quot;The Welsh Wails&quot;) 1917–1919.

Blore wrote several sketches for revue and variety, including &quot;Violet and Pink&quot; (1913); &quot;A Burlington Arcadian&quot; (1914); &quot;The Admirable Fleming&quot; (1917); &quot;Yes, Papa&quot; (1921); &quot;French Beans&quot; (1921) and his most enduring sketch, &quot;The Disorderly Room&quot;, written while he was in the army, and first given in London by Stanley Holloway, Tom Walls, Leslie Henson, Jack Buchanan and the author. It was taken up by Tommy Handley who starred in it in music halls around the country and on BBC radio in the 1920s and 30s.

===West End and Broadway===
In the early 1920s Blore toured in variety and appeared in the West End in &quot;Angel Face&quot; (1922), a &quot;musical farce&quot; with music by Victor Herbert, heading a cast that included Sylvia Cecil and the young Miles Malleson, and &quot;The Cabaret Girl&quot;, joining the cast in mid-run.

In August 1923 Blore appeared for the first time on Broadway, playing the Hon. Bertie Bird in &quot;Little Miss Bluebeard&quot;, and on his return to London he appeared in the same part at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre. After the death of his first wife, Violet (&quot;née&quot; Winter), Blore married Clara Macklin in 1926. In the same year he returned to New York, playing Teddie Deakin in &quot;The Ghost Train&quot;. The play, which ran in London for 655 performances did less well on Broadway, and closed after 61 performances. Blore remained in the US for the next seven years; his Broadway roles were Reggie Ervine in &quot;Mixed Doubles&quot;, Sir Calverton Shipley in &quot;Just Fancy&quot;, Sir Basil Carraway in &quot;Here&#x27;s Howe&quot;, the King of Arcadia in &quot;Angela&quot;, Captain Robert Holt in &quot;Meet the Prince&quot;, Lieutenant Cooper in &quot;Roar China&quot;, Bertie Capp in &quot;Give Me Yesterday&quot; and Roddy Trotwood in &quot;Here Goes the Bride&quot;. In 1932 he toured as Cosmo Perry in &quot;The Devil Passes&quot;, before returning to Broadway to play the waiter in Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Gay Divorce&quot;, which starred Fred Astaire and Claire Luce.

&quot;Gay Divorce&quot; ran for 248 performances, closing in July 1933, to allow Astaire and Luce to go to London to play in the piece at the Palace Theatre. Blore and Erik Rhodes from the Broadway cast also appeared in the London production, which ran for five months. This was Blore&#x27;s last London stage show. As &quot;The Times&quot; put it, he joined &quot;the select company of English actors who were persuaded to journey to California&quot; to appear in Hollywood films, along with the likes of C. Aubrey Smith and Ronald Colman.

===Hollywood===
Blore made more than 60 films between 1930 and 1955. He was particularly known for playing superior butlers, valets and gentlemen&#x27;s gentlemen. &quot;The Times&quot; commented that he and another English actor, Arthur Treacher, &quot;made a virtual corner in butler parts … no study of an upper class English or American household was complete without one or other of them&quot;. Treacher was tall and thin with a haughty and austere manner; Blore was &quot;shorter and slightly tubby … a trifle more eccentric in manner but equally capable of registering eloquent but unspoken disapproval&quot;. His less lofty air enabled him to deliver the line, &quot;If I were not a gentleman&#x27;s gentleman I could be such a cad&#x27;s cad.&quot;

In 1943 Blore returned to Broadway, replacing Treacher during the run of &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;, and made his final stage appearance at Los Angeles in September 1945, playing Charles Mannering in the unsuccessful Tchaikovsky-based musical &quot;Song Without Words&quot;.

Blore retired after suffering a stroke in 1956. Taken ill in February 1959 he was moved from his Hollywood home to the Motion Picture Country Hospital, where he died of a heart attack on 1 March, aged 71. He was survived by his widow, Clara, a son, Eric Jr., and one grandchild.

<doc id="658402" wikidata="Q505586" url="?curid=658402" title="Raphael Lemkin">
<text>Raphael Lemkin (; 24 June 1900 – 28 August 1959) was a Polish Jewish lawyer who is known for coining the term &quot;genocide&quot; and campaigning to establish the Genocide Convention. During the Second World War, he campaigned vigorously to raise international awareness of atrocities in Axis-occupied Europe. It was during this time that Lemkin coined the term &quot;genocide&quot; to describe Nazi Germany&#x27;s extermination policies.

As a young law student deeply conscious of antisemitic persecution, Lemkin learned about the Ottoman empire&#x27;s genocide of Armenians during World War I and was deeply disturbed by the absence of international provisions to charge Ottoman officials who carried out war crimes. Following the German invasion of Poland, Lemkin fled Europe and sought asylum in the United States, where he became an academic at Duke University.

Lemkin coined &quot;genocide&quot; in 1943 or 1944 from two words: (, &#x27;family, clan, tribe, race, stock, kin&#x27;) and &quot;-cide&quot; (, &#x27;killing&#x27;). The term was included in the 1944 research-work &quot;&quot;Axis Rule in Occupied Europe&quot;, wherein Lemkin documented mass-killings of ethnic groups deemed &quot;untermenschen&quot; by Nazi Germany. The concept of &quot;genocide&quot;&quot; was defined by Lemkin to refer to the various extermination campaigns launched by Nazi Germany to wipe out entire racial groups, including European Jews in the Holocaust. 

After the Second World War, Lemkin worked on the legal team of Robert H. Jackson, Chief US prosecutor at the Nuremberg Tribunal. The concept of &quot;genocide&quot; was non-existent in any international laws at the time, and this became one of the reasons for Lemkin&#x27;s view that the trial did not serve complete justice on prosecuting Nazi atrocities targeting ethnic and religious groups. Lemkin committed the rest of his life to push for an international convention, which in his view, was essential to prevent the rise of &quot;future Hitlers&quot;. On 9 December 1948, the United Nations approved the Genocide Convention, with many of its clauses based on Lemkin&#x27;s proposals.

==Life==
===Early life===
Lemkin was born Rafał Lemkin on 24 June 1900 in Bezwodne, a village in the Volkovyssky Uyezd of the Grodno Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Belarus). He grew up in a Polish Jewish family on a large farm near Wolkowysk and was one of three children born to Józef Lemkin and Bella &quot;née&quot; Pomeranz. His father was a farmer and his mother an intellectual, painter, linguist, and philosophy student with a large collection of books on literature and history. Lemkin and his two brothers (Eliasz and Samuel) were homeschooled by their mother.

As a youth, Lemkin was fascinated by the subject of atrocities and would often question his mother about such events as the Sack of Carthage, Mongol invasions and conquests and the persecution of Huguenots. Lemkin apparently came across the concept of mass atrocities while, at the age of 12, reading &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; by Henryk Sienkiewicz, in particular the passage where Nero threw Christians to the lions. About these stories, Lemkin wrote, &quot;a line of blood led from the Roman arena through the gallows of France to the Białystok pogrom.&quot; In his writings, Lemkin demonstrated a belief central to his thinking throughout his life: the suffering of Jews in eastern Poland was part of a larger pattern of injustice and violence that stretched back through history and around the world.

The Lemkin family farm was located in an area in which fighting between Russian and German troops occurred during World War I. The family buried their books and valuables before taking shelter in a nearby forest. During the fighting, artillery fire destroyed their home and German troops seized their crops, horses and livestock. Lemkin&#x27;s brother Samuel eventually died of pneumonia and malnutrition while the family remained in the forest.

After graduating from a local trade school in Białystok Lemkin began the study of linguistics at the Jan Kazimierz University of Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine). He was a polyglot, fluent in nine languages and reading fourteen. His first published book was a 1926 translation of the Hayim Nahman Bialik Hebrew novella &quot;Behind the Fence&quot; into Polish, with the title &quot;Noah and Marinka.&quot; It was in Białystok that Lemkin became interested in laws against mass atrocities after learning about the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, then later the experience of Assyrians massacred in Iraq during the 1933 Simele massacre. He became interested in war crimes upon learning about the 1921 trial of Soghomon Tehlirian for the assassination of Talaat Pasha.

After reading about the 1921 assassination of Talat Pasha, the main perpetrator of the Armenian genocide, in Berlin by Soghomon Tehlirian, Lemkin asked Professor why Talat Pasha could not have been tried for his crimes in a German court. Makarewicz, a national-conservative who believed that Jews and Ukrainians should be expelled from Poland if they refused to assimilate, answered that the doctrine of state sovereignty gave governments the right to conduct internal affairs as they saw fit: &quot;Consider the case of a farmer who owns a flock of chickens. He kills them, and this is his business. If you interfere, you are trespassing.&quot; Lemkin replied, &quot;But the Armenians are not chickens&quot;. His eventual conclusion was that &quot;Sovereignty, I argued, cannot be conceived as the right to kill millions of innocent people&quot;.

Lemkin then moved on to Heidelberg University in Germany to study philosophy, returning to Lwów to study law in 1926. 

During the 1920s Lemkin was involved in Zionist activities. He was a columnist in the Warsaw based Yiddish Zionist newspaper &quot;Tsienistishe velt (The Zionist world)&quot;. Some scholars think that his Zionism had an influence on his conception of the idea of genocide, but there is a debate about the nature of this influence.

===Career in inter-war Poland===
Lemkin worked as an Assistant Prosecutor in the District Court of Brzeżany (since 1945 Berezhany, Ukraine) and Warsaw, followed by a private legal practice in Warsaw. From 1929 to 1934, Lemkin was the Public Prosecutor for the district court of Warsaw. In 1930 he was promoted to Deputy Prosecutor in a local court in Brzeżany. While Public Prosecutor, Lemkin was also secretary of the Committee on Codification of the Laws of the Republic of Poland, which codified the penal codes of Poland. During this period Lemkin also taught law at the religious-Zionist Tachkemoni College in Warsaw, and took part in Zionist fund raising. Lemkin, working with Duke University law professor Malcolm McDermott, translated &quot;The Polish Penal Code of 1932&quot; from Polish to English.

In 1933 Lemkin made a presentation to the Legal Council of the League of Nations conference on international criminal law in Madrid, for which he prepared an essay on the &quot;Crime of Barbarity&quot; as a crime against international law. In 1934 Lemkin, under pressure from the Polish Foreign Minister for comments made at the Madrid conference, resigned his position and became a private solicitor in Warsaw. While in Warsaw, Lemkin attended numerous lectures organized by the Free Polish University, including the classes of Emil Stanisław Rappaport and .

In 1937, Lemkin was appointed a member of the Polish mission to the 4th Congress on Criminal Law in Paris, where he also introduced the possibility of defending peace through criminal law. Among the most important of his works of that period are a compendium of Polish criminal fiscal law, (1938) and a French-language work, , regarding international trade law (1939).

===During World War II===
He left Warsaw on 6 September 1939 and made his way north-east towards Wolkowysk. He was caught between the invaders, the Germans in the west, and the Soviets who then approached from the east. Poland&#x27;s independence was extinguished by terms of the pact between Stalin and Hitler. He barely evaded German capture, and traveled through Lithuania to reach Sweden by early spring of 1940. There he lectured at the University of Stockholm. Curious about the manner of imposition of Nazi rule he started to gather Nazi decrees and ordinances, believing official documents often reflected underlying objectives without stating them explicitly. He spent much time in the central library of Stockholm, gathering, translating and analysing the documents he collected, looking for patterns of German behaviour. Lemkin&#x27;s work led him to see the wholesale destruction of the nations over which Germans took control as an overall aim. Some documents Lemkin analysed had been signed by Hitler, implementing ideas of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; on &quot;Lebensraum&quot;, new living space to be inhabited by Germans. With the help of his pre-war associate McDermott, Lemkin received permission to enter the United States, arriving in 1941.

Although he managed to save his own life, he lost 49 relatives in the Holocaust; The only members of Lemkin&#x27;s family in Europe who survived the Holocaust were his brother, Elias, and his brother&#x27;s wife and two sons, who had been sent to a Soviet forced labor camp. Lemkin did however successfully help his brother and family to emigrate to Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1948.

After arriving in the United States, at the invitation of McDermott, Lemkin joined the law faculty at Duke University in North Carolina in 1941. During the Summer of 1942 Lemkin lectured at the School of Military Government at the University of Virginia. He also wrote &quot;Military Government in Europe&quot;, a preliminary version of what would become, in two years, his magnum opus, entitled &quot;Axis Rule in Occupied Europe&quot;. In 1943 Lemkin was appointed consultant to the US Board of Economic Warfare and Foreign Economic Administration and later became a special adviser on foreign affairs to the War Department, largely due to his expertise in international law.

In November 1944, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace published &quot;Axis Rule in Occupied Europe&quot;. This book included an extensive legal analysis of German rule in countries occupied by Nazi Germany during the course of World War II, along with the definition of the term &quot;genocide&quot;. Lemkin&#x27;s idea of genocide as an offence against international law was widely accepted by the international community and was one of the legal bases of the Nuremberg Trials. In 1945 to 1946, Lemkin became an advisor to Supreme Court of the United States Justice and Nuremberg Trial chief counsel Robert H. Jackson. The book became one of the foundational texts in Holocaust studies, and the study of totalitarianism, mass violence, and genocide studies.

===Postwar===
After the war, Lemkin chose to remain in the United States. Starting in 1948, he gave lectures on criminal law at Yale University. In 1955, he became a Professor of Law at Rutgers School of Law in Newark. Lemkin also continued his campaign for international laws defining and forbidding genocide, which he had championed ever since the Madrid conference of 1933. He proposed a similar ban on crimes against humanity during the Paris Peace Conference of 1945, but his proposal was turned down.

Lemkin presented a draft resolution for a Genocide Convention treaty to a number of countries, in an effort to persuade them to sponsor the resolution. With the support of the United States, the resolution was placed before the General Assembly for consideration. Among his supporters at the UN there were the delegates of Lebanon, and Lemkin is said to have considered Karim Azkoul in particular as an ally. The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was formally presented and adopted on 9 December 1948. In 1951, Lemkin only partially achieved his goal when the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide came into force, after the 20th nation had ratified the treaty.

Lemkin&#x27;s broader concerns over genocide, as set out in his &quot;Axis Rule&quot;, also embraced what may be considered as non-physical, namely, psychological acts of genocide. The book also detailed the various techniques which had been employed to achieve genocide.

Although Lemkin was a Zionist through his entire life, during this period he downplayed his Zionist sympathies in order to convince the Arab and Muslim delegates in the UN to support the UN genocide convention. Between 1953 and 1957, Lemkin worked directly with representatives of several governments, such as Egypt, to outlaw genocide under the domestic penal codes of these countries. Lemkin also worked with a team of lawyers from Arab delegations at the United Nations to build a case to prosecute French officials for genocide in Algeria. 

Lemkin also applied the term &#x27;genocide&#x27; in his 1953 article &quot;Soviet Genocide in Ukraine&quot;, which he presented as a speech in New York City. Although the speech itself does not use the word &quot;Holodomor&quot;, Lemkin asserts that an intentional program of starvation was the &quot;third prong&quot; of Soviet Russification of Ukraine, and disagrees that the deaths were simply a matter of disastrous economic policy because of the substantially Ukrainian ethnic profile of small farms in Ukraine at the time.

===Death and legacy===
In the last years of his life, Lemkin was living in poverty in a New York apartment. In 1959, at the age of 59, he died of a heart attack in New York City. Only several close people attended his funeral at Riverside Church. Lemkin was buried in Flushing, Queens, at Mount Hebron Cemetery. At the time of his death, Lemkin left several unfinished works, including an &quot;Introduction to the Study of Genocide&quot; and an ambitious three-volume &quot;History of Genocide&quot; that contained seventy proposed chapters and a book-length analysis of Nazi war crimes at Nuremberg.

The United States, Lemkin&#x27;s adopted country, did not ratify the Genocide Convention during his lifetime. He believed that his efforts to prevent genocide had failed. &quot;The fact is that the rain of my work fell on a fallow plain,&quot; he wrote, &quot;only this rain was a mixture of the blood and tears of eight million innocent people throughout the world. Included also were the tears of my parents and my friends.&quot; Lemkin was not widely known until the 1990s, when international prosecutions of genocide began in response to atrocities in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and &quot;genocide&quot; began to be understood as the worst crime of all crimes.

==Recognition==
For his work on international law and the prevention of war crimes, Lemkin received a number of awards, including the Cuban Grand Cross of the Order of Carlos Manuel de Cespedes in 1950, the Stephen Wise Award of the American Jewish Congress in 1951, and the Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1955. On the 50th anniversary of the Convention entering into force, Lemkin was also honored by the UN Secretary-General as &quot;an inspiring example of moral engagement.&quot; He was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize ten times.

In 1989 he was awarded, posthumously, the Four Freedoms Award for the Freedom of Worship.

Lemkin is the subject of the plays &quot;Lemkin&#x27;s House&quot; by Catherine Filloux (2005) and &quot;If The Whole Body Dies: Raphael Lemkin and the Treaty Against Genocide&quot; by Robert Skloot (2006). He was also profiled in the 2014 American documentary film, &quot;Watchers of the Sky&quot;.

Every year, The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights (&quot;T’ruah&quot;) gives the Raphael Lemkin Human Rights Award to a layperson who draws on his or her Jewish values to be a human rights leader.

On 20 November 2015, Lemkin&#x27;s article &quot;Soviet genocide in Ukraine&quot; was added to the Russian index of &quot;extremist publications&quot;, whose distribution in Russia is forbidden.

On 15 September 2018 the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Foundation (www.ucclf.ca) and its supporters in the US unveiled the world&#x27;s first Ukrainian/English/Hebrew/Yiddish plaque honouring Lemkin for his recognition of the tragic famine of 1932–1933 in the Soviet Union, the Holodomor, at the Ukrainian Institute of America, in New York City, marking the 75th anniversary of Lemkin&#x27;s address, &quot;Soviet Genocide in the Ukraine&quot;.

<doc id="658405" wikidata="Q5438915" url="?curid=658405" title="Fay Godwin">
<text>Fay Godwin (17 February 1931 – 27 May 2005) was a British photographer known for her black-and-white landscapes of the British countryside and coast.

==Career==
Godwin was introduced to the London literary scene. She produced portraits of dozens of well-known writers, photographing almost every significant literary figure in 1970s and 1980s England, as well as numerous visiting foreign authors. Her subjects, typically photographed in the sitters&#x27; own homes, included Kingsley Amis, Saul Bellow, Angela Carter, Margaret Drabble, Günter Grass, Ted Hughes, Clive James, Philip Larkin, Doris Lessing, Robert Lowell, Edna O&#x27;Brien, Anthony Powell, Salman Rushdie, Jean Rhys, and Tom Stoppard.

After the publication of her first books—&quot;Rebecca the Lurcher&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Oldest Road: An Exploration of the Ridgeway&quot; (1975), co-authored with J.R.L. Anderson—she was a prolific publisher, working mainly in the landscape tradition to great acclaim and becoming the nation&#x27;s best-known landscape photographer. &quot;The Oldest Road&quot; sold over 25,000 copies. Her work was informed by the sense of ecological crisis present in late 1970s and 1980s England.

In the 1990s she was offered a Fellowship at the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television (now the National Media Museum) in Bradford, which pushed her work in the direction of colour and urban documentary.

She also began taking close-ups of natural forms. A major exhibition of that work was toured by Warwick Arts Centre from 1995 to 1997; Godwin self-published a small book of that work in 1999, titled &quot;Glassworks &amp; Secret Lives,&quot; which was distributed from a small local bookshop in her adopted hometown of Hastings in East Sussex.

==Published work==
The first edition of &quot;Remains of Elmet: A Pennine Sequence&quot;, her book collaboration with poet Ted Hughes, was published by Rainbow Press in 1979. The book was also published in popular form by Faber and Faber (with poor reproduction of the images), and then re-published by them in 1994 simply as &quot;Elmet&quot; with a third of the book being new additional poems and photographs. Hughes called the 1994 &quot;Elmet&quot; the &quot;definitive&quot; edition. She also said, in a 2001 interview, that this was the book she would like to be most remembered for.

In an obituary for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, art critic Ian Jeffrey called her 1985 book &quot;Land,&quot; the &quot;book for which she will be most remembered&quot;, and described it:

Designed by Ken Garland, it is stylish in the classic mode, but what sets &quot;Land&quot; apart is the care that Fay gave to the combining and sequencing of its pictures. Working with contact prints on a board, she put together a picture of Britain as ancient terrain—stony, windswept and generally worn down by the elements...[a work] in the neo-romantic tradition...[that] gives an oddly desolate account of Britain, as if reporting on a long abandoned country.

Godwin&#x27;s last major retrospective was at the Barbican Centre, London in 2001. A retrospective book, &quot;Landmarks&quot;, was published by Dewi Lewis in 2002.

==Awards and recognition==
Godwin was the subject of a documentary, broadcast on &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; on 9 November 1986.

She was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society in 1990 and had a major retrospective at the Barbican Centre in London in 2001.

==Personal life==
Godwin was born Fay Simmonds in Berlin, Germany, the daughter of Sidney Simmonds, a British diplomat, and Stella MacLean, an American artist. She attended nine different schools before beginning a career as a travel representative. She moved to London in the 1950s. She married publisher Tony Godwin in 1961; the couple had two sons, Jeremy and Nicholas. They split up in 1969 and later divorced.

Godwin was less active in her final years; in a December 2004 interview for &quot;Practical Photography&quot;, she blamed &quot;the NHS. They ruined my life by using some drugs with adverse affects [&quot;sic&quot;] that wrecked my heart. The result is that I haven&#x27;t the energy to walk very far.&quot;

Godwin died on 27 May 2005, in Hastings, England at the age of 74. After her death, the Ramblers&#x27; Association, an organisation led by Godwin from 1987 to 1990, described her presidency as a time when its &quot;long-running right-to-roam campaign was turned up to the full-strength pressure which ultimately resulted in the access provisions enshrined in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003.&quot;

Godwin&#x27;s archive, including approximately 11,000 exhibition prints, the entire contents of her studio, and correspondence with some of her subjects, was given to the British Library.

<doc id="658408" wikidata="Q2031560" url="?curid=658408" title="Tianjin University">
<text>Tianjin University (TJU; ), previously Peiyang University (), is a national public research university in Tianjin, China. Established in 1895 by a royal charter from Guangxu Emperor, Tianjin University is the oldest university in China, leading the country&#x27;s significant shift towards modernization and development. The university is affiliated with and funded by the Ministry of Education of China. It is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction.

Originally as Imperial Tientsin University and later Peiyang University, the university was founded with the goal of providing modern education in engineering and mining, and it later expanded to include programs in science, business, law, humanities, and other fields. The establishment of Tianjin University marked a turning point in Chinese history, as it represented a significant shift towards modernization and the adoption of Western educational models.

In 1951 after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, by an order of the Chinese Communist government, the university was renamed Tianjin University. It serves as one of the largest multidisciplinary engineering universities in China and one of the first 16 national key universities accredited by the central government in 1959.

==History==
In 1895, Sheng Xuanhuai submitted his memorial to the Guangxu Emperor to request for approval to set up a modern higher education institution in Tianjin. After approval on October 2, 1895, Peiyang Western Study College was founded by him and American educator Charles Daniel Tenney and later developed to Peiyang University. It was the first university providing four year degree modern higher education in China. The university modeled itself on the famous American Universities and aimed to rejuvenate China by training qualified personnel with new scientific and technological knowledge. After the PR China&#x27;s foundation and university restructures, Peiyang University was renamed Tianjin University in 1951.

Peiyang University / Tianjin University contributes greatly to the Chinese society. In its early days, undergraduates had the permission to directly pursue graduate study at Harvard and Yale without any entrance exams. Its Law School, which is the first (and also the best at that time) Law School in China, was merged into Peking University and gave Peking University a fresh new start. Peiyang&#x27;s Department of Aeronautics was separated and developed into Beihang University.

===Building of disciplines===

A discipline layout, with stress on engineering, incorporating science, engineering, economics, management, humanities, education, law and art has been formed in the university. The university now has 6 national key disciplines and 17 municipal key disciplines. Some disciplines with advantages and characteristics such as power machinery and engineering, optical engineering, testing and measuring technology and instruments, chemical engineering, chemical technology, management science and engineering, mechanics, architecture, material science and engineering, are all leading disciplines in China and have international influence.

For the time being, the university has 12 first-grade disciplines and 49 second-grade disciplines that confer Doctoral degree, 87 disciplines conferring master&#x27;s degree, 17 engineering disciplines conferring master&#x27;s degree in engineering. The university also confers master&#x27;s degrees in business administration (MBA) and public administration (MPA). At present there are 15 postdoctoral research programs, 4 national key laboratories, 1 national engineering research center, 2 technology research and promotion centers of national scientific and technological achievements, 7 engineering technological R&amp;D centers and open laboratories at ministerial level.

In June 2001, the university was evaluated by the expert panel of the Ministry of Education as having successfully completed all the construction items set by “211-Project” for the Ninth Five-Year Plan Period.

<doc id="658411" wikidata="Q907899" url="?curid=658411" title="Buick Special">
<text>The Buick Special was an automobile produced by Buick. It was usually Buick&#x27;s lowest-priced model, starting out as a full-size car in 1936 and returning in 1961 (after a two-year hiatus) as a mid-size. The Special was built for several decades and was offered as a coupe, sedan and later as a station wagon. When GM modernized their entry level products in the 1960s, the Special introduced the modern Buick V6 that became a core engine for GM for several decades and lived on in upgraded form until 2006.

By 1970, Special was no longer offered as a standalone model but the name would later be used for the entry trim on 1975 to 1979 and 1991 to 1996 Century models.

The entry level Buick can trace its heritage to the Buick Model 10, a companion to Buick&#x27;s first car, the Buick Model B. The Model 10 started out as one of the independent brands merged into Buick, called the Janney.


==Series 40 (1930, 1934–1935)==
When the Series 40 was introduced, it had the overhead valve Buick Straight-6 engine that produced 80.5 bhp of power at 2,800 rpm, and 74,257 examples were made, being the highest number of Buicks for 1930. For the year 1931, the Series 40 was temporarily discontinued, with the introduction of the Marquette Model 30 and the Series 50 being repositioned as the Buick entry level product. The 1935 version returned with the Buick Straight-8 engine and 93 bhp. Starting with this generation, all GM cars shared a corporate appearance as a result of the Art and Color Section headed by Harley Earl and modest yearly changes were introduced to freshen the appearance.

1933 was the first year all GM vehicles were installed with optional vent windows which were initially called “No Draft Individually Controlled Ventilation” later renamed &quot;Ventiplanes&quot; which the patent application was filed on Nov. 28, 1932. It was assigned to the Ternstedt Manufacturing Company, a GM subsidiary that manufactured components for Fisher Body and they were added to the Special when it was introduced in 1935. Additional manufacturing locations also opened across the country under the Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac Assembly Division. The Series 40 was the most affordable Buick offered, with 6 body styles offered, and the five passenger Sedan Model 41 was US$925 ($ in dollars ), while a LaSalle Series 50 was US$1,000 ($ in dollars ) more. A standard feature offered on all Buicks was a dashboard mounted selector handle that would alter spark timing and allow either low grade or premium fuel to be used. In 1936 the name changed to &quot;Special&quot;.


==1936–1942, 1946–1949==
Starting with 1936, the Buick Special Series 40 model range represented the marque&#x27;s entry level full-size automobile. The &#x27;36 was a very successful year for Buick and also marked the first time of using names rather than the simple serial numbers which had been in use before. The first Specials rode on a wheelbase, but for the next model year this was increased to as all Buicks grew for that year. The eight cylinder engine was also new, and was now of rather than . The Special (and all other Buicks as well) underwent a full restyling for 1939, with a more enclosed nose and a wider grille. The wheelbase was also two inches shorter.

For 1940, there was the usual restyle and the wheelbase increased by an inch. This was also the only model year that a four-door convertible Special (&quot;Sport Phaeton&quot;) was offered, although only 552 were built. Prices started at US$795 ($ in dollars ) for the Business Coupe to US$925 ($ in dollars ) for either the 4-door Touring Sedan or 2-door Convertible.

For 1941 the bodywork was again all new, with the front fenders now very closely integrated into the cars overall design. The Estate Wagon migrated from being a Super into the Special lineup. A fastback was offered in Century and 40 Special trim as a four-door touring sedan and two-door business coupe and the 46S sedanette. Also new was the 40-A series (the regular Special now being the 40-B), a version on a three inches shorter wheelbase which shared its body with the 1941 Oldsmobile Series 70. These two series, with a restyle reminiscent of the 1939 Y-Job, continued into the abbreviated 1942 model year. Production ended on 4 February 1942. The Special was now offered as the entry-level luxury vehicle that the LaSalle previously held.

After production resumed, only the larger 1946 B-body Special range remained available, which is rare, representing less than two percent of Buick&#x27;s production that year. The Special continued with minor changes until the prewar body was finally replaced halfway through the 1949 model year. Post-war Specials were only available as a four-door sedan or a two-door &quot;sedanet&quot;, until the new 1949 models arrived.

In the movie &quot;Mildred Pierce,&quot; Veda Pierce, Mildred&#x27;s daughter, played by actress Ann Blyth, was given a 1940 Buick Special convertible as a gift, valued at US$1,077 for the Model 46C ($ in dollars ).

The movie &quot;Small Town Conspiracy&quot; features a 1939 Buick Special 8 that the main character of the film John Haleran (Zen Gesner) drives as his official police car. The car remained the property of director Ralph Clemente and was untouched for many years until sold to Florida restorer and car collector Axel Caravias.

==1949–1958==
Halfway into the 1949 model year, the Specials received all-new bodywork to include a dramatically styled grille where nine grille bars also served as bumper guards and extended over the front bumper, and the first fully postwar design for the series. New was also the 40D-series, a better equipped version called the Special DeLuxe. The engine remained the which had been used since 1937, but for 1951 this was replaced by the larger &quot;Fireball&quot; straight-eight. A two-door hardtop coupe was also new for 1951, but the unusual grille was revised with the grill bars shortened. The 1954 Specials had an all-new body and chassis, much wider and lower, and were now equipped with the all-new, more powerful &quot;Fireball&quot; V8 engines. In 1953 &quot;The Buick-Berle Show&quot; introduced product placement commercials on TV, and later in 1955 &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; was one of the sponsors.

Introduced in the middle of the 1955 model year the four-door Buick Special Riviera (along with the Century Riviera, the Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, and the 88 Holiday) were the first four-door pillarless hardtops ever produced. By then, the Buick Special was one of America&#x27;s best selling automotive series. For 1956 the larger V8 engine was shared with the rest of the range, although it was replaced by the bigger, 364 V8 for 1957. This year also brought all-new bodywork, as well as a four-door hardtop station wagon called the Buick Riviera Estate. The 1957 wheelbase remained 122 inches. In the June, 1957 issue of Popular Mechanics, the Special was rated with a 0-60 mph time of 11.6 seconds, fuel economy of at , and ground clearance of . 1958 brought the most chrome yet and twin headlights, as the car grew longer and wider, albeit on an unchanged chassis.

1949-1957 Buick Specials had three VentiPorts on each side while more senior Buicks (with the partial exception of the Buick Super, which switched from three to four in 1955) had four. Earlier versions had a &quot;Sweepspear&quot; inspired character line alongside the body, while later versions had the &quot;Sweepspear&quot; moulding attached to the side of all models. GM renamed the Buick Special the LeSabre for the 1959 model year, taking the name from the 1951 Le Sabre concept car.

==1961–1963==

In 1961, the car returned after a short absence of two years, but this time it was on the brand new unibody compact GM Y platform. The Special was powered by a innovative aluminum-block 215 in³ V8, and had Dual Path transmission and power steering. In mid-year a Skylark option was released with special trim, optional bucket seats and a four-barrel version of the 215 that made .

In 1962, the Special was the first American car to use a V6 engine in volume production; it earned &quot;Motor Trend&quot;″s Car of the Year for 1962. This 198 cid Fireball was engineered down from the 215 and used many of the same design parameters, but was cast in iron. Output was 135 hp (gross) at 4600 rpm and at 2400 rpm. In their test that year, &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; was impressed with Buick&#x27;s &quot;practical&quot; new V6, saying it &quot;sounds and performs exactly like the aluminum V8 in most respects.&quot; In 1963, the Special&#x27;s body was restyled. Mechanically, however, the car was identical to the 1962 model. There was also some minor interior restyling, particularly to the dash and instrument cluster. The 1963 Special was available as a 2-door pillared hardtop coupe, a four dour sedan, a convertible, and a station wagon. Engine choices were a standard V6 with a twin-barrel carburetor and optional V8 with (two-barrel) or more powerful four-barrel ( in 1962, in 1963). Transmission choices were a three speed column shift manual transmission, a floor shift Borg-Warner T-10 four-speed manual, or a two-speed Turbine Drive automatic. The two speed &quot;Dual Path Turbine Drive&quot; automatic was a Buick design and shared no common parts with the better known Chevrolet Power-Glide transmission.

The 1962 model sold 153,763, including 42,973 Skylarks.

The 1963 body was only produced for one year; it sold 148,750 copies, including 42,321 Skylarks. The entire car was redesigned for 1964. After that, the 215 found its way into the Rover P6 3500S in 1968, but was never sold in North America in any great numbers. It was also employed in other British cars, including the Morgan Plus 8, MG MGB GTV8, Land Rover, and Triumph TR8, as well as retrofits into MGAs and MGBs. The engine had really earned its stripes as being the sole engine powering the Range Rover for a couple decades and eventually finding its way into the original Series/Defender Land Rover; and several other Land Rover Models including the Discovery and the Forward Control.

The Skylark became a separate series for 1962.


==1964–1967==

The Special, along with the upscale Skylark, were redesigned for the 1964 model year with separate body-on-frame construction—renamed the A-body—and marketed as an intermediate-sized car. The Skylark was expanded to a full top-line series that now included two- and four-door sedans, two-door hardtop coupe and convertible, along with a station wagon. The other series models included the base Special and the slightly fancier Special Deluxe, in a more limited range of bodystyles.

Also new for 1964 were engines. The capacity of the V6 engine was increased from 198 to 225 cubic inches, while the aluminum V8 was replaced by a new cast iron-block 300 cubic inch V8 with aluminum cylinder heads. In 1965, cast iron heads replaced the problematic aluminum ones. This reliable engine, produced until 1967, was based on the aluminum V8, and many parts (such as the cylinder heads) were interchangeable.


==1968–1969==

The Special nameplate was used on lower-priced intermediate-sized Buicks through the 1969 model year. In 1968 and 1969, the Buick Special was dropped and only Special Deluxes were manufactured. In 1970, the end of the Special came about when the Special Deluxe was dropped too in favor of the slightly upscale Buick Skylark.

The 1968 model year was one of significant change for the Buick Special and Skylark. Although still using the same basic chassis, all of GM&#x27;s mid-sized cars adopted a policy of using two different length wheelbases. Two-door models used a shorter wheelbase of , while four-door models used a longer wheelbase of 116 in (the Buick Sport Wagon and Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser used an even longer wheelbase of 121 in). All of GM&#x27;s mid-sized cars received all-new sheet metal, incorporating a semi-fastback appearance, which was a revival of a streamlining on all GM products from 1942 until 1950 as demonstrated on the Buick Super Club Coupe (sedanette). More Federally mandated safety features improved occupant protection and accident avoidance, including side marker lights, shoulder belts (on all models built after January 1, 1968), and parking lights that illuminated with headlights.

In a reshuffling of models in the lineup, the Special Deluxe replaced the previous Special. The Skylark nameplate was shuffled down a notch to replace the previous Special Deluxe. The previous Skylark was replaced by a new Skylark Custom.

The Special Deluxe was available as a pillared two-door coupe, a pillared four-door sedan, or a 2-row station wagon.

The previous V6 was discontinued and the associated tooling was sold to Kaiser Industries, which used the V6 in its Jeep trucks and sport utility vehicles. The base engine in the Buick Special (and Buick Skylark) coupes &amp; sedans) became a 250-cubic-inch Chevrolet I6, that produced at 4200 rpm using a single-barrel Rochester carburetor.

Optional on the Special Deluxe coupe &amp; sedan and standard on the Special Deluxe station wagon was a new 350-cubic-inch V8 derived from the 340, using a two-barrel Rochester carburetor that produced at 4400 rpm. Optional on the Special Deluxe was a 350-cubic-inch V8 using a four-barrel Rochester carburetor that produced at 4600 rpm. The Buick Special name was dropped after the 1969 model year. A locking steering column with a new, rectangular ignition key became standard on all 1969 GM cars (except Corvair), one year ahead of the Federal requirement.

For 1970, the Buick Skylark name was moved down another notch, replacing the previous entry-level Buick Special.

==1975–1977==

The Special returned briefly to the GM A platform as an entry level subseries of the Buick Century. Although officially sold as the Buick Century Special, it was sometimes also referred to as just the Buick Special.

Century Specials were usually powered by Buick&#x27;s own 231 V6; a V8 (from either Buick, Oldsmobile, or Chevrolet) was offered but rarely optioned. It used the &quot;colonnade&quot; roofline but was fitted with a landau roof that covered most of the rear quarter windows. The opening that was left was the same shape as the windows on the higher series formal-roof cars.
==1978–1979==

In 1978 and 1979, the Special trim continued on the redesigned Century fastback and wagon models.
==1991–1996==
Special returned once again as the entry level trim on the Century sedan (starting 1991) and wagon (starting 1993). The &quot;Special&quot; designation was discontinued with the Century&#x27;s redesign in 1997.

<text>The Ottawa Public Library (OPL; ) is the library system of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The library was founded in 1906 with a donation from the Carnegie Foundation.

==Services==
* Information and reference services
* Access to full text databases
* Community information
* Reader&#x27;s advisory services
* Programs for children, youth and adults
* Delivery to homebound individuals
* Interlibrary loan

=== Information technology ===
The library originally provided Windows 95 computers to use with some preloaded applications such as Office 2000 and WordPerfect. In January 2005, it upgraded three branches to Windows XP. The rest received that operating system by April of that year. In March 2014, Windows 7 was rolled out and the software was upgraded to Office 2007, but WordPerfect is now absent. Children accounts are filtered, while adults have the option of choosing unfiltered or filtered Internet access.

Later, they added Wi-Fi hotspots at their branches.

It is also possible to obtain free downloadable e-books, Zinio magazines, audiobooks and MP3 music from the library.

==Origin of the OPL==
Prior to the twentieth century, Ottawa had a few reading rooms in hotel lobbies, and also some small fee-based libraries for working men such as the Bytown Mechanics&#x27; Institute, but no truly free place in which anyone could read. The city&#x27;s active Local Council of Women took up the cause of a free library for all. The first definite step taken for founding a Free Public Library was that of the Ottawa women in the early part of 1895. To attain this end, the Committee obtained the co-operation of the &quot;Evening Journal&quot;. The proprietor generously placed his paper at the disposal of the ladies for a &quot;Woman&#x27;s Issue.&quot; Mary McKay Scott was Managing Editor. The paper was issued April 13, 1895, and a profit of $500.00 realized. To secure municipal assistance, a by-law was submitted in January, 1896. The by-law was defeated. They announced, just before the election of 1896, that the mansion of George Perley, a local lumber baron, was donated in his will as a home for the library. However, the city voted down the motion to build a library, as well as another motion to build a firehall; the city just didn&#x27;t have any money to spare for &quot;luxuries&quot;.

Only in 1901, when letters were mailed to Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie replied that he would offer $100,000 to the city to build the library if they provided a site and a pledge of $7,500 a year to maintain it. They eventually agreed in January 1903, and within a few years the library was built and open to the public.

The day after its official opening, in 1906, the original Carnegie library opened several hours later than expected, because the mass of people who had come to the opening day left the entire library in complete disarray, and had walked off with many items.

==Present day OPL==


The Main Library is located in Downtown Ottawa at the corner of Metcalfe Street and Laurier Avenue West, at the same spot as the original Carnegie library, although nothing remains of the original building but a stained glass window. Several of the Corinthian columns from the old Carnegie library survive in the Rockeries in Rockcliffe Park, a rock garden maintained by the National Capital Commission. The library now has thirty-three branches spread throughout urban and rural Ottawa.

Before the City of Ottawa&#x27;s amalgamation in 2001, which resulted in the merging of eleven separate municipal library systems, the Ottawa Public Library itself only had eight libraries, including Sunnyside, Rideau, and Rosemount. Today, the library is divided into district branches Nepean Centrepointe, Cumberland and Greenboro, community branches such as Sunnyside, Ruth E. Dickinson and Carlingwood and several rural branches.

Patrons throughout the new city have greatly benefited from the 2001 merger as they can now easily order almost items from another branch, and return books to any branch in the city. Ordering items via the library website for pickup at a local branch has been very popular, with over 5 million visitors to the website in 2007. The new system is very centralized, which has meant a loss of decision-making power in many ways, including the choice of books for purchase and the old, local ways of running the smaller libraries. Patrons can however suggest items for the library to purchase.

The current CEO of OPL is Sonia Bebbington as of October 31, 2022. The OPL is governed by a board of nine part-time members appointed by the City of Ottawa, five city councillors and four members of the public. The Library is funded mainly by the city through local tax revenues. Some revenue also comes from the province, and traditional library sources of fees, fines, and fundraising.

The library system has 2.3 million items, 91.7% percent of which are books. The library also has a large audio-visual collection including DVDs, CDs, and downloadable books and music. Since Ottawa has a significant francophone population, a large portion of the collection is in French, with some branches such as Vanier working almost exclusively in French. Smaller collections offer a wide array of other languages, notably Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic. According to the latest Ontario library statistics, only the Toronto Public Library has larger holdings. The library hosts a full range of programming for both adults and children, with children&#x27;s programming being extremely popular. There are also 359 public internet stations and 79 electronic databases.

The Library&#x27;s two bookmobiles, which operated out of the Sunnyside branch for almost 50 years, stop at regularly scheduled places throughout the city in an effort to reach areas without library branches. Many of these neighborhoods are poorer, more remote, or simply too far from a branch. During a funding crisis in 2004, the older bookmobile was nearly decommissioned, but it was kept in service with a second, new bookmobile added in 2005. The Bookmobile headquarters was moved to the new Greenboro District Library in June 2006.

The large new Greenboro District Library, built in the city&#x27;s rapidly growing South end, opened on June 7, 2006, replacing the Blossom Park Branch established by the former City of Gloucester.

==New central library==

In recent years, numerous cities such as Vancouver, Seattle and Salt Lake City, have had great success in constructing new central libraries as part of downtown revitalization efforts. These urban landmarks have created new civic spaces that both create community and are key component of an information society. Accordingly, there is pressure for Ottawa to have a great design and follow other Canadian cities such as Calgary and Halifax, who have erected new libraries in recent years. There was an offer to the City Council from a developer for a partnership to build in the still-mostly-empty Lebreton Flats. The joint OPL-LAC Joint Facility (Ottawa Public Library and Library and Archives of Canada) will be located at 555 Albert Street at the edge of LeBreton Flats. 

==City of Ottawa Central Archives and Ottawa Public Library Materials Centre==
The City of Ottawa Central Archives and Ottawa Public Library Materials Centre is located at 100 Tallwood Dr. The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) building was designed by Shoalts and Zaback Architects, and Barry J. Hobin and Associates Architects. The building features a variety of energy-saving technologies and renewable resources. The Archives includes a public reference room, exhibition gallery, conservation laboratory, and art vaults. The Library Materials Centre, features an Automated Materials Handling System, which helps sort and deliver the library materials to all 33 branches and the Bookmobile. The central archives and library materiels center was included amongst other architecturally interesting and historically significant buildings in Doors Open Ottawa, held June 2 and 3, 2012.

<doc id="658419" wikidata="Q6915619" url="?curid=658419" title="Moseley Shoals">
<text>Moseley Shoals is the second album by the British rock group Ocean Colour Scene which was released during the Britpop era. The album reached #2 in the UK charts, and amassed 92 weeks on chart, making it the band&#x27;s most successful album in terms of weeks on chart, despite a later album reaching #1.

==Album==
The first single taken from the album was &quot;The Riverboat Song&quot;, which was popularised by Chris Evans on &quot;TFI Friday&quot;. &quot;The Day We Caught the Train&quot; reached number four in the charts, with &quot;You&#x27;ve Got It Bad&quot; and &quot;The Circle&quot; also reaching the top 10. &quot;One for the Road&quot; was also due to be released, but the band decided to concentrate on the 1997 album release &quot;Marchin&#x27; Already&quot;. By November 1997, &quot;Moseley Shoals&quot; had sold over 1.2 million copies worldwide.

The word Moseley is taken from a suburb of the same name in south Birmingham, UK. The album title as a whole is a punning nod to the city of Muscle Shoals, Alabama, the location of several famous 1960s soul recording studios including FAME Studios and Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in nearby Sheffield, Alabama.

The album was produced by Brendan Lynch, and was recorded and mixed at the band&#x27;s studio in Birmingham (Moseley Shoals).

In April, 2016, the album was re-released as part of the Record Store Day celebrations, on limited edition red vinyl, charting at No.5 on the vinyl album chart.

The memorial by which the band can be seen standing on the front cover is the Jephson Memorial in The Jephson Gardens, Leamington Spa, UK.

==Accolades==
In 1998, &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s readers voted &quot;Moseley Shoals&quot; the 33rd greatest album of all time. The album was placed at number 42 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s 2017 poll of &quot;The 50 Best Britpop Albums.&quot;

==&quot;Moseley Shoals&quot;: Deluxe Edition ==
Released on 7 March 2011, the remastered album contained the original track list, plus all the B-sides from the four singles released (&quot;The Riverboat Song&quot;, &quot;The Day We Caught the Train&quot;, &quot;The Circle&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got It Bad&quot;). Most of these (all except &quot;You&#x27;ve Got It Bad (demo)&quot;, &quot;Men of Such Opinion&quot;, &quot;I Need a Love Song&quot; and &quot;Justine&quot;) appeared on the B-side compilation album &quot;B-sides, Seasides and Freerides&quot;.

<text>The University of Wolverhampton is a public university in Wolverhampton, England, located on four campuses across the West Midlands, Shropshire and Staffordshire. Originally founded in 1827 as the Wolverhampton Tradesmen&#x27;s and Mechanics&#x27; Institute, the university was subject to a series of merges, incorporations, and expansions with other local colleges, one of which occurred under the supervision of Prince George, Duke of Kent. 

The university has four faculties comprising eighteen schools and institutes. It has students and currently offers over 380 undergraduate and postgraduate courses. The city campus is located in Wolverhampton city centre, with a secondary campuses at Springfield, Walsall, and Telford. There is an additional fifth campus in Wolverhampton at the University of Wolverhampton Science Park.

==History==

===Technical college===

The roots of the University of Wolverhampton lie in the Wolverhampton Tradesmen&#x27;s and Mechanics&#x27; Institute founded in 1827 and the 19th-century growth of the Wolverhampton Free Library (1870), which developed technical, scientific, commercial and general evening classes. This grew into the Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Technical College in 1926.

In 1931, Prince George laid the foundation stone for the new Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Technical College. By 1945, the creation of the Music Department allowed the college to capitalise on the growing demand for a variety of subject areas. Enrolment in the first year totalled 135, and by 1950 HM Inspectors stated that &quot;it was unique among technical colleges&quot;. The composer Vaughan Williams attended a performance of his &quot;Riders to the Sea&quot; in early 1950.

In 1951 it was renamed Wolverhampton and Staffordshire College of Technology and the work of the High School of Commerce was partially transferred to the college. In 1956 the Joint Education Committee of the college noted: &quot;Research is an essential feature of any institution of higher learning. Very good work is being done in applied science, and mechanical engineering is bringing to fruition negotiation with a local firm for sponsored research into problems at heat exchangers&quot;. By 1957–58 the student numbers grew to 6,236. This included trainee teachers being enrolled into the college. Parallel developments with Wulfrun College set the foundations for the creation of the Faculty of Education created in 1977.

The first computers also arrived in 1957, the WITCH (Wolverhampton Instrument for Teaching Computing from Harwell). The annual report for 1956–57 records: &quot;Following a visit of a member of staff to Harwell, the college in competition with eight other colleges was offered the gift of an Electronic Digital Computer.&quot; A number of local firms donated sums of money to cover the cost of maintenance and operation. The WITCH is now considered to be the &quot;oldest original functioning electronic stored program computer in the world&quot; and from September 2009 began restoration at The National Museum of Computing, Bletchley Park.

By 1964, with the further expansion of higher education the college began to provide BA degrees with options in English, Geography, History, Music, and Economics among others. By 1965 the college was offering a degree in Computer Technology.

===Polytechnic and gaining university status===
The Wolverhampton School of Art was founded in 1851, becoming the Municipal School of Art in 1878, and finally Wolverhampton College of Art in 1950.

The Wolverhampton College of Technology merged with Wolverhampton College of Art in 1969 to form The Polytechnic, Wolverhampton in 1969. The formal opening ceremony took place on 14 January 1970. Wolverhampton Polytechnic was operational by the creation of five faculties; Applied Science, Art and Design, Arts, Engineering and Social Sciences. The functional units were operated by committees such as the Academic Board, Faculty Boards, Planning and Standing Committees, Committee of Deans.

1969 saw the opening of the new School of Art and Design building, designed by architects Diamond Redfern and Partners and A. Chapman (Wolverhampton council architect), and was opened by former student, Sir Charles Wheeler. Mergers with Teacher Training Colleges in Wolverhampton and Dudley in the 1970s added to the expansion of the Polytechnic, with additional growth in 1989 on Walsall Campus when the Polytechnic acquired the Teacher Training College ( West Midlands College of Higher Education ) site.

The Polytechnic changed its name to Wolverhampton Polytechnic in 1988. In 1992 the Polytechnic was granted university status and became the University of Wolverhampton.

===Expansion years===

The university was further expanded by the construction of the Telford Campus, completed in 1994, which includes in its grounds the 18th Century, Grade II listed Priorslee Hall; the oldest building under the University of Wolverhampton&#x27;s banner. Telford Campus opened its doors to students from the Business School and the Faculty of Science and Engineering.

1994 also saw Wolverhampton become the first UK university to be awarded the Charter Mark for excellence in customer service.

In 1995 the Wolverhampton Science Park opened (renamed the University of Wolverhampton Science Park in November 2012); a collaboration between the university and the local council, with its main aim being to forge links between local businesses and the university&#x27;s research departments. The Science Park housed The Creative Industries Centre, The Technology Centre, The Development Centre and other business and technology support services.

Also in 1995, two local nursing colleges – the United Midlands College for Nursing and Midwifery and the Sister Dora School of Nursing – amalgamated to form the School of Nursing and Midwifery at the Walsall campus, formerly West Midlands College of Higher Education.

In 1997 the university was one of the first to establish a virtual learning environment: WOLF (Wolverhampton Online Learning Framework) a system used by students and staff to support learning in most subject areas. It provides online space for tutors to make reference materials, notes, videos and documents related to a subject available. In 2008 an upgraded version &quot;WOLF2&quot; was launched.

Two new learning centres were opened at the Telford and City campuses in 1998. These learning centres were a fusion of traditional libraries with high-tech facilities, aimed at providing a greater range of accessible materials for students. The following year the university opened the Arena Theatre, Wolverhampton on the City campus along with the new SC building in Telford.

===Millennium to the present day===

2000 saw the launch of a multimillion-pound refurbishment programme. From 2000 to 2010 £115 million was invested in campus developments. Highlights include the £26 million &#x27;Millennium City&#x27; building opening by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown in February 2003.

This was followed in 2004 by a teaching building called the &#x27;Technology Centre&#x27; (now the Alan Turing building), home of the School of Computing and IT (later to become the School of Mathematics and Computer Science). The same year a £4 million extension to the Harrison Learning Centre was completed.

In October 2005 Caroline Gipps became vice-chancellor – the university&#x27;s first female vice chancellor.

In 2006 the City Campus North Administration and Teaching Building was erected, providing space for a 120-seat lecture theatre, 4 elliptical 35-seat learning pods and the bringing together of many administration departments to work all under the one roof. In 2007, a new building at Walsall Campus was established to accommodate over 1,100 students over four floors and providing a combination of specialist and open access IT facilities and office accommodation for the School of Education.

2009 saw the formation and launch of two new Schools: the School of Law, Social Sciences and Communications and the School of Health and Wellbeing, as well as the launch of the research group Centre for Developmental and Applied Research in Education (CeDARE).

The new School of Technology launched on 1 September 2010. In 2011, the university in partnership with Walsall College opened the Black Country University Technical College, one of the first University Technical Colleges in England.

Professor Geoff Layer joined the university as Vice-Chancellor on 1 August 2011. September 2011 saw the opening of the Performance Hub at Walsall Campus; a multimillion-pound teaching, learning, rehearsal and performance space for performing arts. Professor Layer retired from the University in 2021.

Plans for a further £45 million investment in City Campus were announced in December 2012, with redevelopments including a new Business School building opposite the Molineux Stadium. In 2013, the university celebrated its 21st anniversary since being granted university status on 17 June 1992.

In 2015, the university announced its biggest ever investment plan, &#x27;Our Vision, Your Opportunity&#x27;, to generate £250 million of investment by 2020 to enhance the student experience and help to drive economic growth in the region. Key projects include the new Rosalind Franklin Science Centre (which opened to the public in 2014), the completion of the Lord Swraj Paul Building (new home to the University of Wolverhampton Business School), £10 million investment in engineering at Telford Innovation Campus, a new courtyard and catering facilities at City Campus, and the development of the new Springfield Campus, a national centre for excellence for construction and the built environment.

In 2015, Lord Paul, the chancellor, donated £1m to the university which is the largest donation ever received.

On Wednesday 14 November 2018, the university went into partnership with the West Midlands Ambulance Service to form the UK&#x27;s first University Ambulance Trust.

In May 2022, the university announced that it would stop recruiting students for 138 of its undergraduate and postgraduate courses from September of that year. This was a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which had driven up costs and lowered student applications. 

==Campuses==
The University of Wolverhampton is located across four campuses across the West Midlands and Shropshire.

===City Campus===

City Campus is the main site for the university and is situated in Wolverhampton city centre, opposite Molineux Stadium and approximately 16 miles (26 km) from Birmingham. Divided into City Campus Wulfruna and City Campus Molineux, it is home to several academic schools/faculties; administration departments; the Students&#x27; Union and student support facilities. In addition, there are three separate Halls of Residence on this campus: North Road, Lomas Street and Randall Lines.

The Offices of the Vice-Chancellor are also responsible for implementing corporate strategy and operational policy decisions from the Academic Board and the Board of Governors.

Each academic school/faculty is managed by a dean aided by associate deans. The academic provision in the schools is supported by support departments each managed by a head or director.

Wolverhampton&#x27;s current chancellor is Lord Paul of Marylebone, and its current vice-chancellor is Geoff Layer, who took up the position in 2011.

==Academic profile==
===Research===
The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) announced a 1,290% increase in funding allocation for Wolverhampton&#x27;s Quality Research (QR). The QR allocation of £1.905 million for Wolverhampton was the highest amount for a new university in the West Midlands.

The university will lead a consortium of all 12 of the universities in its region to increase the number of partnerships from 70 to 210 over the next three years.

In June 2013, a university team won a Times Higher Education Leadership and Management Award (THELMA) in the category of Knowledge Exchange/Transfer Initiative of the Year for its &quot;one-stop shop&quot; approach to promoting services to businesses.

In May 2016, the university was awarded &#x27;Business of the Year&#x27; at the Express &amp; Star Business Awards, where its contribution to the region&#x27;s economy was hailed as &#x27;truly outstanding&#x27;.

===Criticism===

====Staff issues====
In 1998, Ian Connell left the university after being found guilty of academic misconduct. A few weeks later he committed suicide, apparently depressed by his situation.

In 2009 the university Executive announced that the university was in financial difficulties, needing to make savings of £8 million. This followed reports in the media that it had understated student non-completion rates to HEFCE. The university announced it was taking steps to reduce expenditure on staff pay and launched a voluntary redundancy exercise on 1 October 2009. This concluded with the loss of 150 posts through voluntary redundancy.

In 2015, despite 2014 REF successes, the Vice Chancellor announced that four areas of research would be cut back and some professors selected for compulsory redundancy while all professors would be subject to more rigorous annual appraisal which would lead to demotion to senior lecturer in three years if they failed to sustain their target levels of outputs, income and PhD students.

==Student life==
===Students&#x27; Union===
The University of Wolverhampton Students&#x27; Union (UWSU) is a charity led by a team consisting of 4 full-time Officers (currently the positions are Union Affairs, Academic, Community and Diversity Officers) and part-time Officers. These posts are elected annually in cross-campus elections. UWSU is primarily based in City (Wolverhampton) in the Ambika Paul Building and the WS Building in Walsall.

UWSU has over 60 societies, based on student interests. These societies are set up and run by students, with support from the Union.

===Student accommodation===
The university offers over 1600 places in Halls of Residence across three campuses, including over 1000 rooms with en-suite facilities.

===Links with business and industry===

Students also have a variety of opportunities to gain work experience while they are studying and on graduation. These include graduate placements such as Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTP). The university is leading on the £5.2M national Student Placements for Entrepreneurs in Education West Midlands (SPEED WM) project involving 13 UK universities, to help students create their own businesses whilst they are studying. &#x27;Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs&#x27; is aimed at helping new entrepreneurs to acquire relevant
skills for managing a small or medium-sized enterprise by spending time working in another EU country with an experienced entrepreneur in his/her company. And SP/ARK provides facilities, accommodation, training and mentoring for business start-ups and freelancers in new media and design.

In 2013 the university won a Times Higher Education Leadership and Management Award for Knowledge Exchange/Transfer Initiative of the Year.

==Academies and school links==
In April 2012 the university established the University of Wolverhampton Multi Academy Trust. The trust sponsors a number of schools in the West Midlands including University of Wolverhampton Wednesfield Academy and Health Futures UTC.

<text>Marchin&#x27; Already is the third album by Ocean Colour Scene.

The album was a follow-up to the successful &quot;Moseley Shoals&quot;, and is in a similar style. The songs were taken from the band&#x27;s catalogue that they had built up since forming several years earlier.

The single &quot;Hundred Mile High City&quot; was used in the film &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot;. P.P. Arnold appears on &quot;Traveller&#x27;s Tune&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Thing&quot;. A more subdued version of &quot;Traveller&#x27;s Tune&quot; originally appeared as a B-side to &quot;The Day We Caught the Train&quot;.

The album knocked Oasis&#x27; &quot;Be Here Now&quot; off the top spot in the UK Albums Chart—Noel Gallagher sent Ocean Colour Scene his congratulations through a plaque on which he had inscribed, &quot;To The Second Best Band In Britain&quot;. Steve Cradock famously retorted &quot;it&#x27;s an honour to be described as Britain&#x27;s second best band, ahead of Oasis but behind the Beatles&quot;.

In 2007 the song &quot;Get Blown Away&quot; was covered by British indie band The Enemy as a B-side to their single &quot;It&#x27;s Not OK&quot;, albeit just a piano and vocal version.

On 4 February 2014, &quot;Marchin&#x27; Already&quot; was reissued as a two disc deluxe version, with the second disc containing B-sides from previous singles. There is also a three disc/one DVD super deluxe version with added demos and radio sessions on Disc 2 and a live concert from the Marchin&#x27; Already tour from the Manchester Apollo on 22 February 1998, with the original released VHS of their concert from Stirling Castle making up the DVD release.

<text>&quot;The Riverboat Song&quot; is a song by British band Ocean Colour Scene. It is heavily influenced by Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Four Sticks&quot;, from which it takes its main riff and a number of lyrics. The song is written in time.

The single was popularised by Radio 1 DJ Chris Evans, who played it frequently on his radio shows and to introduce guests on his television programme &quot;TFI Friday&quot;. As a result, having been released in February 1996, it reached number 15 on the UK Singles Chart, paving the way for the success of the next two singles, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got It Bad&quot; and &quot;The Day We Caught the Train&quot;, as well as their album &quot;Moseley Shoals&quot;. It also became a moderate hit in New Zealand, where it peaked at number 37.

<text>The Crypteia, also referred to as Krypteia or Krupteia (Greek: κρυπτεία &quot;krupteía&quot; from κρυπτός &quot;kruptós&quot;, &quot;hidden, secret&quot;; members were κρύπται &quot;kryptai&quot;), was an ancient Spartan state institution. The &quot;kryptai&quot; either principally sought out and killed helots across Laconia and Messenia as part of a policy of terrorising and intimidating the enslaved population, or they principally did a form of military training, or they principally endured hardships as an initiation ordeal, or the Crypteia served a combination of all these purposes, possibly varying over time. The Krypteia was an element of the Spartan state&#x27;s child-rearing system for upper-class males. 

Modern historians often translate &quot;Krypteia&quot; as &quot;secret police&quot; or &quot;secret service&quot;, but its precise structure is debated.

== Overview ==
Much of the debate surrounding the Crypteia comes from the differing accounts provided by the few surviving Classical texts that mention the Crypteia, and the fact that Xenophon&#x27;s Constitution of the Lacedaemonians makes no mention of it.
Plutarch and Heraclides Lembus (both of whom may be using a lost work by Aristotle as a source), and some scholars, (such as Henri-Alexandre Wallon (1812–1904)), saw the Crypteia as a kind of secret police – a state security force organised by the ruling class of Sparta to patrol the Laconian countryside and terrorise the helots, by carrying out secret killings. Others, including Hermann Köchly (1815–1876) and Wilhelm Wachsmuth (1784–1866), saw it as a form of military training similar to the Athenian &quot;ephebia.&quot;

The ranks of the Crypteia comprised young upper-class Spartan men, probably between the ages of 21 and 30, possibly selected as &quot;those judged to have the most intelligence.&quot; The men were known as &quot;hêbôntes&quot;, one of the many social categories that preceded full Spartiate citizenship, and had completed their rearing at the agoge with such success that Spartan officials marked them out as potential future leaders.

According to Plato, the &quot;kryptai&quot; did not use footwear during the winter and slept without shelter. Plato describes them as being unsupervised and as depending on themselves alone for survival. Plato&#x27;s description might seem to imply that the &quot;kryptai&quot; were forced to be independent, but some scholars think that they may have had attendants at certain times to watch over them.

The duration of service in the Crypteia is also largely unknown, but it has been suggested that one year of service may have been all that was required of the men, based on a scholion of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Laws&quot; (see below).

==History and function==
According to Aristotle, the Crypteia were established by the legendary Spartan lawgiver Lycurgus. There is no known date associated with its establishment, however. Every autumn, Spartan ephors would declare war on the helot population which would allow them to headhunt helots without fear of punishment. The chosen &quot;kryptai&quot; were then sent out into the countryside armed with daggers with the instructions to kill any helot they encountered travelling the roads and tending to fields they deemed too plentiful. They were specifically told to kill the strongest and to take any food they needed.

The reason for adopting that practice may have been to reduce the repressed aggression of the hêbôntes. However, it is most commonly thought to have been adopted to prevent the threat of a helot rebellion and to keep their population in check. According to some sources, &quot;kryptai&quot; would stalk the helot villages and surrounding countryside, spying on the servile population. Their mission was to prevent and to suppress unrest and rebellion. 

Another point of contestation is the time of day at which the Crypteia operated. Plato described their movement as travelling in both day and night. On the contrary, Plutarch states that they would hide during the day and would travel by night, then aiming to kill any helots who they came across. That suggests that helots may have had to comply with curfew laws put into place by the Spartans. 

Troublesome helots could be summarily executed. Such brutal repression of the helots permitted the Spartan elite to successfully control the servile agrarian population. It may also have contributed to the Spartans&#x27; reputation for stealth since a &quot;kryptēs&quot; (κρύπτης) who got caught was punished by whipping. 

Aristotle&#x27;s lost account was partly disbelieved by Plutarch, several centuries later. Plutarch, who provides much of what is known of Aristotle&#x27;s account, was not convinced that Lykourgos would have included such harsh customs within the Spartan constitution and instead thought that the Crypteia had been introduced, if at all, only after the helot revolt, brought on by an earthquake in Sparta in the mid-460s BC. In events preceding the ten-year conflict between the Spartans and the Messenians that resulted from the helot revolt, the Spartan leadership covertly killed two thousand helots who had participated in the war. It is thought that the Crypteia were the primary perpetrators of the massacre or were at least somehow involved in carrying it out.

=== Military affiliation ===
In &quot;Cleomenes&quot;, Plutarch describes the Crypteia as being a unit of the Spartan army. The Crypteia did not act in a similar fashion to hoplite soldiers, however. Hoplite soldiers were armored and acted as a part of a phalanx while members of the Crypteia acted on their own, often rested during the day, and were most likely unarmored and armed with only a dagger. During the Battle of Sellasia, the Spartan king Cleomenes III &quot;called Damoteles, the commander of the Crypteia, and ordered him to observe and find out how matters stood in the rear and on the flanks of his army.&quot; 

Various scholars have speculated function of the Crypteia as a part of the army because Plutarch&#x27;s account provides a completely different understanding of their role when compared to the accounts provided by Aristotle and Plato. Plutarch&#x27;s account has led to the Cryptiea being described as a reconnaissance, special operations or even military police force. However, Jean Ducat argues that source should no longer be associated with the understanding of the Crypteia as known from Aristotle and Plato. He proposes that the understanding of the Crypteia as part of the army is just that, a separate understanding that defines the Crypteia as a corps in the Spartan army. 

Plutarch&#x27;s account of the Crypteia describes the organisation as a military unit that has a commander, which differs from Aristotle and Plato&#x27;s interpretation since the Crypteia is described as being independent and without overseers. Ducat also takes up query with the task of observation that the Crypteia are given in Plutarch&#x27;s account. Again, that differs from Aristotle and Plato&#x27;s interpretation in the fact that the Crypteia&#x27;s mandate was not to observe or provide intelligence but to seek out purposely and kill helots. Unlike its unknown origins, the Battle of Sellasia is considered to provide a potential date for the disbandment of the Crypteia. With the Spartan revolution in jeopardy, Cleomenes III began to emancipate helots in exchange for money and then military service. With the emancipation of many helots and Spartan&#x27;s subsequent defeat at Sellasia, helotage ceased to exist, and without a helot population, by mandate, the Crypteia should have ceased to exist as well. The Crypteia&#x27;s disbanding after that battle, however, is only speculation.

=== Ritualistic activity ===
The French historian Henri Jeanmaire points out that the unstructured and covert activities of the Crypteia are unlike the disciplined and well-ordered communal life of the Spartan hoplites (see Homonoia). Jeanmaire suggests that the Crypteia was a rite of passage, possibly predating the classical military organization, and may have been preserved through Sparta&#x27;s legendary religious conservatism. He draws comparison with the initiation rituals of some African secret societies (wolf-men and leopard men). Members of the Crypteia may have not shared the commonality with Spartan hoplites that Jeanmaire describes during their service as a part of the institution, but they eventually returned to their communities and were integrated back into the complex Spartan social system.

==Classical sources==
Several surviving classical sources, from several different centuries, describe, or mention, or at least are thought by some Classicists to reference the Crypteia.

===5th century BC===
Herodotus is thought by some to have been referring to the Crypteia when he writes &quot;Now the Lacedemonians put to death by night all those whom they put to death, but no man by day.&quot;

Thucydides is also thought by some to be referring to the Crypteia when he writes, in his account of the eighth year of the Peloponnesian War, 
Centuries later, Plutarch mentions Thucydides&#x27;s account, immediately after speaking explicitly of the Crypteia (see below).

===4th century BC===
There is a single-sentence passing reference to the Crypteia, made by an imaginary Spartan in a fictional dialogue, in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Laws&quot;

There is also a scholion on this text.

===2nd century BC===
A fragment by the Alexandrian Heraclides Lembus (Heraclides fr. 10 Dilts) mentions the Krypteia, probably describing it as instituted by Lycurgus:

Heraclides may, like Plutarch, below, be using a lost work of Aristotle as a source.

===1st century AD===
Plutarch, in his &quot;Life of Lycurgus&quot;, gives a long description of the Crypteia. 

There is another possible reference to the Crypteia, or at least to a man who was commander of it at the time of the Battle of Sellasia, in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot;:


== Modern reception ==
=== In popular culture ===
The Crypteia (as The Krypteia) are key to the indie horror film &quot;Pledge&quot;, which brings the Greek secret society to the modern world fronting as a fraternity preying on new freshman pledges. 

The Crypteia are briefly mentioned in the comic book series &quot;Three&quot; by Kieron Gillen. They make their first appearance in issue one of &quot;Three&quot; and are depicted naked, armed with only daggers, attacking a group of unsuspecting helots as they tend to their crops. Gillien used the Crypteia to highlight the harshness of the Spartan system and describes their function as &quot;a rite of passage to life where all vocations are barred, bar one. Once a year, the masters declare war on the helots. If they bloody their hands, they are not polluted. So they are free to do whatever is required to keep the helots on their knees. And so they do.&quot; One of Sparta&#x27;s leading historians, Stephen Hodkinson, is noted as being the historical consultant employed by Gillen throughout the series. Hodkinson describes Gillien&#x27;s depiction of the Crypteia as a &quot;perfect amalgam&quot; of the information available in the two source traditions; those being Plato&#x27;s &quot;Laws&quot; and Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Lycurgus.&quot; The reason for this, according to Hokinson, is that these two sources portray the Crypteia in different, almost contradictory, ways. Aristotle&#x27;s account, which is taken from Plutarch, depicts &quot;kryptai&quot; hunting helots, while Plato&#x27;s account does not mention the killing of helots and views the Crypteia as a mode of endurance training. Hodkinson claims that the differing accounts have led modern scholars to adopt a &quot;composite&quot; understanding of the Crypteia. 

The Krypteia are also mentioned in the book &quot;Gates of Fire&quot;. They are described as being a &quot;secret society among the peers (full citizens).&quot; They also are described as being assassins and being &quot;pitiless as iron.&quot; The author also mentions that they are the youngest and the strongest of the Spartan military.

=== Spartan Race ===
Spartan Race, the obstacle course racing series, calls their event leaders the &quot;Krypteia&quot;.

=== Golden Dawn ===
Maniot leaders of the far-right Greek political party, Golden Dawn, reinstituted the Crypteia as a part of their adoption of Spartan ideologies.

<text>Datamation is a computer magazine that was published in print form in the United States between 1957 and 1998, and has since continued publication on the web. &quot;Datamation&quot; was previously owned by QuinStreet and acquired by TechnologyAdvice in 2020. Datamation is published as an online magazine at Datamation.com.

==History and profile==
Its predecessor started as a trade/engineering magazine called &quot;Research &amp; Engineering&quot; (1955–1957). In 1957 it was rebranded to &quot;The Magazine of Datamation&quot; (from the issue no. 7), and in 1959 the name was finally changed to &quot;Datamation&quot; (from the issue no. 3).

When &quot;Datamation&quot; as such was first launched in 1957, it was not clear there would be a significant market for a computer magazine given how few computers there were. The idea for the magazine came from Donald Prell who was Vice President of Application Engineering at Benson-Lehner Corporation, a Los Angeles computer input-output company. In 1957, the only place his company could advertise their products was in either &quot;Scientific American&quot; or &quot;Business Week&quot;. Prell had discussed the idea with John Diebold who started &quot;Automation Data Processing Newsletter&quot;, and that was the inspiration for the name &quot;DATAMATION&quot;. F.D. Thompson Publishing, Inc., agreed to publish the magazine with its owner, Frank D. Thompson, as the New York City-based publisher, but with its editorial operations in Los Angeles.

After leaving Benson-Lehner, Prell served as the magazine&#x27;s technical consultant and later, while based in London, its European editor. Sandy Lanzarotta served as the magazine&#x27;s first editor, then Harold Bergstein moved from managing editor to editor when Lanzarotta joined IBM&#x27;s marketing department. Robert B. Forest succeeded Bergstein as editor in 1963 and remained in that role for over a decade. The magazine was later acquired by Technical Publications, and subsequently that entity was acquired by Dun and Bradstreet.

In 1970, &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to &quot;12-year-old Datamation, the acknowledged leader in the field.&quot;

In 1995, after rival CMP Media Inc.&#x27;s 1994 launch of its TechWeb network of publications, &quot;Datamation&quot; worked in partnership with Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) and launched one of the first online publications, Datamation.com. In 1996, &quot;Datamation&quot; editors Bill Semich, Michael Lasell and April Blumenstiel, received the first-ever Jesse H. Neal Editorial Achievement Award for an online publication. The Neal Award is the highest award for business journalism in the U.S.

In 1998, when its publisher, Reed Business Information (who had earlier acquired Technical Publications in 1986), terminated print publication of &quot;Datamation&quot; 41 years after its first issue went to press, the online version, Datamation.com, became one of the first online-only magazines. In 2001, Internet.com (WebMediaBrands) acquired the still-profitable Datamation.com online publication. In 2009, Internet.com (and Datamation.com) were acquired by Quinstreet, Inc.

==Computer humor==
Traditionally, an April issue of &quot;Datamation&quot; contained a number of spoof articles and humorous stories related to computers.

However, humor was not limited to April. For example, in a spoof &quot;Datamation&quot; article (December 1973), R. Lawrence Clark suggested that the GOTO statement
could be replaced by the COMEFROM statement and provided some entertaining examples. This was actually implemented in the INTERCAL programming language, a language designed to make programs as obscure as possible.

&quot;Real Programmers Don&#x27;t Use Pascal&quot; was a letter to the editor of &quot;Datamation&quot;, volume 29 number 7, July 1983, written by Ed Post, Tektronix, Wilsonville, Oregon, USA.

Some of the BOFH stories were reprinted in &quot;Datamation&quot;.

The humor section was resurrected in 1996 by editor in chief Bill Semich with a two-page spread titled &quot;Over the Edge&quot; with material contributed by &quot;Annals of Improbable Research&quot; editor Marc Abrahams and MISinformation editor Chris Miksanek. Semich also commissioned BOFH author Simon Travaglia to write humor columns for the magazine. Later that year, Miksanek became the sole humor contributor (though in 1998 &quot;Over the Edge&quot; was augmented with an online weblinks companion by Miksanek&#x27;s alter-ego &quot;The Duke of URL&quot;). The column was dropped from the magazine in 2001 when it was acquired by Internet.com.

A collection of &quot;Over the Edge&quot; columns was published in 2008 under the title &quot;Esc: 400 Years of Computer Humor&quot; ().

<text>And Then She Came is a rock band from Aachen, Germany. The band was formed as Krypteria, a gothic metal band. Originating from a 2001 &quot;pop musical theatre studio project&quot; of the same name, the idea was to use different vocalists, though German-Korean singer Ji-In Cho assumed the role of lead vocalist in 2004. One self-titled studio album was released under this moniker (later edited and re-released as &quot;Liberatio&quot;). The group went on hiatus in 2012 and later reformed as And Then She Came in 2016.

==History==
In 2001, Chris Siemons and S.C. Kuschnerus worked together to record a fantasy-musical CD. There was no vocalist at that time, because they wanted to record the CD with many different voices. In 2003, the album &quot;Krypteria&quot; was released. Approximately one year later, in 2004 a tsunami occurred in the Indian Ocean and the German TV station RTL asked them to re-record the song &quot;Liberatio&quot; as a benefit single. Ji-In Cho, was chosen as the lead vocalist for the song and Sony/BMG, decided to re-release an edited version of their first album under the same name.

In 2004, from that project, Krypteria the band was officially born. Although Siemons and Kuschnerus played a leading role in the recording of the album &quot;Liberatio&quot;, the band does not consider it an official release. A year later their &quot;true&quot; first album, &quot;In Medias Res&quot;, was released.

Krypteria&#x27;s second recording was the EP entitled &quot;Evolution Principle&quot;, released in 2006. A review by the German edition of &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; marked it as an important release of contemporary gothic metal in Germany.

In January 2007, Krypteria released their second full-length studio album, &quot;Bloodangel&#x27;s Cry&quot;. The title comes from the track &quot;The Night All Angels Cry&quot;&#x27; lyrics.

In early 2008, the band announced that they were working on their third studio album &quot;My Fatal Kiss&quot;. The album was released first in Germany on August 28, 2009, then in the rest of Europe on January 29.

The band&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;All Beauty Must Die&quot; was released on April 22, 2011 on the band&#x27;s own label Liberatio Music. Peaking on position 24 in the German Media Control Charts it is Krypteria&#x27;s most successful release so far.

It was announced in 2012 that the band would be going on hiatus due to Ji-In&#x27;s pregnancy.

In 2016, the band was reformed and renamed as And Then She Came, with Olli Singer replacing Chris Siemons as guitarist.

<text>, sometimes known as Japanology in Europe, is a sub-field of area studies or East Asian studies involved in social sciences and humanities research on Japan. It incorporates fields such as the study of Japanese language, history, culture, literature, philosophy, art, music, cinema, and science.

The historical roots of Western Japanese studies may be traced back to the Dutch traders based at Dejima, Nagasaki during the Edo period (1603–1867). The foundation of the Asiatic Society of Japan at Yokohama in 1872 by Western scholars such as Ernest Satow and Frederick Victor Dickins was an important event in the development of Japanese studies as an academic discipline.

==Japanese studies organizations and publications==
In the United States, the Society for Japanese Studies has published the &quot;Journal of Japanese Studies&quot; (JJS) since 1974. This is a biannual academic journal dealing with research on Japan in the United States. 
JJS is supported by grants from the Japan Foundation, Georgetown University, and the University of Washington in addition to endowments from the Kyocera Corporation and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

The British Association for Japanese Studies (BAJS), founded in 1974, is an association primarily sponsored by Toshiba and the Japan Foundation. The BAJS publishes an academic journal called &quot;Japan Forum&quot;.

In Europe, the European Association for Japanese Studies (EAJS) is also funded by Toshiba and the Japan Foundation. It has held triennial conferences around Europe since 1973. Other academic journals dealing with Japanese studies include &quot;Monumenta Nipponica&quot;, a biannual English-language journal affiliated with Sophia University in Tokyo, and &quot;Social Science Japan Journal&quot;, published by Oxford University Press.

Scholarship on Japan is also within the purview of many organizations and publications dealing with the more general field of East Asian studies, such as the Association for Asian Studies or the Duke University publication &quot;&quot;.

The International Research Center for Japanese Studies (Nichibunken) maintains an online database of institutions involved in Japanese studies research worldwide, including information on 1,640 institutions of Japanese studies. The database indicates that the country with the most institutions of Japanese studies outside the United States and Japan is China (121), while other countries containing a significant number of institutions include South Korea (85), England (69), Germany (64), Canada (61), Australia (54), and France (54).

Since the declaration of 2010 as the &quot;Japan Year&quot; in Turkey, a yearly Japan Studies Conference has been held in Turkey.

<text>Anselm Franz (January 21, 1900—November 18, 1994) was a pioneering Austrian jet engine engineer known for the development of the Jumo 004, the world&#x27;s first mass-produced turbojet engine by Nazi Germany during World War II, and his work on turboshaft designs in the United States after the war as part of Operation Paperclip, including the Lycoming T53, the Honeywell T55, the AGT-1500, and the PLF1A-2, the world&#x27;s first high-bypass turbofan engine.

==Early life==
Born in Schladming, Austria, in 1900, Franz studied mechanical engineering at the Graz University of Technology and earned a doctoral degree from the University of Berlin. Franz worked as a design engineer at a company in Berlin, where he developed hydraulic torque converters. In 1933 Franz joined the Sturmabteilung.

==Junkers Aircraft==
In 1936, he joined Junkers, and during much of the 1930s he was in charge of supercharger and turbocharger development.

Meanwhile Hans von Ohain&#x27;s first engines were being run at Heinkel, although there was little official interest. Helmut Schelp and Hans Mauch, at the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM), tried to keep development moving through the &quot;back door&quot;, attempting to interest existing engine companies in jet development. On one such visit in early 1939 Otto Mader at Junkers said that even if the idea was worth looking at, he had no one to run such an effort. Schelp suggested that Franz would be perfect for the job, given his experience in turbocompressor work.

The program was set up later in 1939, initially consisting of a very small team drawn from the supercharger division. Unlike the Heinkel designs, the Jumo would use an axial compressor, as opposed to the centrifugal compressor, in order to have a smaller frontal area. With that exception the design was otherwise very conservative, a series of six flame cans were used for combustion instead of a single annular burner, and the compression ratio was kept low at 3.14:1. Franz decided to focus on development time-to-market instead of performance in order to avoid having the program killed off if it didn&#x27;t produce a working engine quickly.

The first testbed run of the experimental 004A took place in the spring of 1940, and had full speed runs in January 1941. The engine flew on an Messerschmitt Bf 110 on March 15, 1942, and after a number of these A models were delivered, the Messerschmitt Me 262 first took to the air with the 004A on July 18. The RLM was finally interested in the design, and ordered 80 production quality versions. The new 004B version included a number of changes, but ran into difficulty with vibration and fatigue problems that greatly delayed its service entry. It was not until the spring of 1944 that the engine was routinely lasting 50 hours and could enter full production. It nevertheless went on to power the majority of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s jet designs.

==Operation Paperclip==
After the war Franz moved to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip, and worked for a time with the USAF on engine-related issues at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. He was known to still wear his long leather, military coat from Nazi Germany in the United States, with the Nazi insignia removed.

In 1951 he was hired to set up a new turbine division at Lycoming&#x27;s otherwise unused plant in Stratford, Connecticut. Here he decided to focus on engine areas not currently served by the larger companies (General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney), eventually settling on helicopter engines. His first design, the T53, would go on to be one of the most popular turboshaft engines in history, powering the Bell Aircraft UH-1 Huey and AH-1 Cobra helicopters, and the OV-1 Mohawk ground attack aircraft. He followed this success with the larger T55, later converting it into a small turbofan engine as well. In the 1960s he led development of a new design for tank use, which developed into the AGT-1500, used on the M1 Abrams.

==Retirement==
Franz retired from Lycoming in 1968, having risen to vice president and assistant general manager. He died in 1994, holder of the U.S. Army Outstanding Civilian Service Medal, the R. Tom Sawyer Award from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Austrian Decoration of Honour for Science and Art, and the Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold with Star for Services to the Republic of Austria.

<text>The  ( in Attic Greek, or , in Doric Greek) was the training program pre-requisite for Spartiate (citizen) status. Spartiate-class boys entered it age seven, and aged out at 30. It was considered violent by the standards of the day, and was sometimes fatal.

The was divided into three age groups, paides, paidiskoi, and hēbōntes, roughly corresponding to young boys (7-12), adolescents (12-20), and young men (20-30). The deliberately deprived boys of food, sleep, and shelter. It involved cultivating loyalty to Sparta through military training (e.g., pain tolerance), hunting, dancing, singing, and rhetoric. There seems to have been ritual beating. It was intensely competitive, and the boys were encouraged to use violence against each other; by Plutarch&#x27;s account, this included sexual violence by hēbōntes against paides, while Xenophon says the relationships were widely but wrongly considered to be sexual. Participants were required to live in the open or in barracks, and were restricted from contact with birth families or wives.

Participants were the sons of Spartiates and Spartiate-class mothers (that is, those eligible for citizen status, totalling perhaps 1/10 to 1/32 of the population). Spartiate-class girls (who could not become citizens) did not participate in the , although they may have received a similar state-sponsored education. Helots (slaves), mothax (free non-citizens, thought to be children of slave rape by Spartiates), and other freeborn boys who did not have two Spartiate-class parents, were also excluded. The firstborn sons of the ruling houses, Eurypontid and Agiad, were exempted; a few trophimoi (very well-connected metics or perioeci) took part by special permission, as did syntrophoi (children of helot mothers adopted by Spartiates). 

The word had various meanings in Ancient Greek and comes from the verb (to lead). There is no evidence that it was used to refer to the Spartiate education system until the 3rd century BC, but it was often used before then to mean training, guidance, or discipline. Sources are unclear about the exact origins of the . According to Xenophon, it was introduced by the semi-mythical Spartan law-giver Lycurgus, and modern scholars have dated its inception to the 7th or 6th century BC Regardless, the structure and content of the changed over time as the practice fell in and out of favour throughout the Hellenistic period. In the Roman period, it became a tourist attraction for Romans.

== The Classical Agōgē ==

===Structure===
The was divided into three age categories: the (about ages 7–14), (ages 15–19), and the (ages 20–29). The boys were further subdivided into groups called (singular &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;pack&quot;), with whom they would sleep, and were led by an older boy (&quot;)&quot; who Plutarch claims was chosen by the boys themselves. They answered to the or &quot;boy-herder,&quot; an upper-class official who was tasked with overseeing the entire Spartan education system.
The were taught the basics of reading and writing, but even the early stages of education focused on the development of skills that would encourage military prowess. Boys would compete in athletic events such as running and wrestling, as well as choral dance performances. Notably, were expected to steal food for themselves and their &quot;,&quot; and were probably underfed as a means of encouraging this. Stealing did not go unpunished, however, as Xenophon reports that those who were caught would be beaten, a lesson which he claims taught the boys stealth and resourcefulness. There were other hardships too: the boys were made to participate in the in bare feet, supposedly to toughen their feet and improve agility, and beginning at the age of 12, boys would be given only one item of clothing, a cloak, per year. Plutarch reports that the boys slept together with the other members of their &quot;,&quot; constructing beds out of reeds pulled by hand from the Eurotas River.

Additionally, were educated in Laconism, the art of speaking in brief, witty phrases. According to French historian Jean Ducat, Aristotle believed that it was important that a Spartan learn how to poke fun at his peers, and that he be able to accept the teasing himself.

At around age 12, a boy would often enter into an institutionalized relationship with a young adult male Spartan, which continued as he became a . Plutarch described this form of Spartan pederasty (erotic relationship) as one where older warriors (as the &quot;erastes&quot;) would engage promising youths (the &quot;eromenos&quot;) in a long-lasting relationship with an instructive motive. Xenophon, on the other hand, claims that the laws of Lycurgus strictly prohibited sexual relationships with the boys, although he acknowledges that this is unusual compared to other Greek city-states.
Ducat considers the stage of as a transitional phase between a child and an adult, where upper-class Spartan boys were encouraged to integrate themselves into adult society. At this point, loyalty shifted from the to the &quot;syssition,&quot; a common mess where adult Spartiates of all ages were expected to eat together and socialize. Scholars have suggested that one role of the was to act as a &quot;sponsor&quot; through which the could gain entry to the same . Physical training and athletic competitions continued with an increased intensity.
At the age of 20, a young Spartan graduated from the ranks of the into the and was known as an &quot;.&quot; If he had demonstrated sufficient leadership qualities throughout his training, he might have been selected to lead an &quot;.&quot;

The term means: &quot;those who have reached physical adulthood&quot;. It was at this age when Spartan men became eligible for military service and could vote in the assembly, although they were not yet considered full adult citizens and were still under the authority of the . Those who had impressed their elders the most during their training could be selected for the &quot;Crypteia&quot;, a type of &#x27;Secret Police&#x27; tasked with maintaining control over the Helot population through violence. While scholars such as Pierre Vidal-Naquet have suggested that the Crypteia functioned as an initiatory ritual in the transition into adulthood, others, such as David Dodd, believe it was used primarily as a tool of terror. Plutarch and Plato also differ in their accounts of the Crypteia, with Plutarch mentioning brutal killings done by the Crypteia in Life of Lycurgus and Plato not mentioning the killings at all in Laws.

Additionally, 300 were chosen to join the , a highly-esteemed infantry cohort (despite the name implying cavalry). Xenophon describes the selection process as a public event where each of the three (commanders) chooses 100 men, supposedly to instil a rivalry between each group, seeing as each man would be loyal to the who chose him and resentful of the other two. He claims that this encouraged the groups to report instances of their rivals&#x27; wrongdoing, effectively keeping the entire cohort in check.

A Spartan man could graduate from the &quot;&quot; at age 30, at which time he was expected to have been accepted into a and was permitted to have a family. He would also receive a , an allotment of land farmed by helots. Those not accepted into a did not become Spartiates (citizens). They may have become hypomeiones.

=== Purpose ===
According to Plutarch, the main purpose of the &#x27; was for Spartan boys to undergo intense physical trials to prepare their bodies for the harshness of war. The competitive nature of athletic events encouraged hard work and merit. However, the &#x27; likely had a second purpose: to instil in young children a collective Spartan identity. The &#x27; kept Spartan boys away from their families for much of their childhood, which Stephen Hodkinson believes taught them to favour the needs of the entire populace over that of an individual. Since a Spartan man&#x27;s formative years were spent entirely in a perpetual competition of merit (both physical and social) they were encouraged to conform to the Spartan laws and social norms. Completion of the &#x27; also served to define what it meant to be a Spartan citizen: one who had proven his mastery of both physical strength and social conventions.

There may have been an initiatory component to the &#x27;, especially in its early history. Training overlapped with ritual activity at the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia, where were made to steal from the altar under threat of being beaten if they were caught, possibly as part of an initiation rite in the transition to a . As well, the &quot;Gymnopaedia&quot; festival featured choral and athletic competitions between groups of naked youths, and boys may have been expected to participate as part of the &#x27;.

== After the Classical period ==
The popularity of the was diminished by the first half of the 3rd century BCE, possibly as a result of the declining Spartan population, but was successfully reinvigorated by Cleomenes III in 226 BCE. It was abolished less than forty years later by Philopoemen when Sparta was forced into the Achaean League in 188/9 BCE but was restored after Sparta came into Roman possession in 146 BCE.

Roman Sparta was characterized by a desire to emulate the traditional institutions of the archaic past, and this was mainly expressed through the &#x27;. Ironically, the &#x27; in this period was almost certainly different from that of the Classical period. For example, there may have been a change in the way boys were divided by age; Plutarch (writing in the 2nd century CE) mentions only two groups: the younger and the older . As well, the term appears to replace the Classical as the name for the groups of boys.

However, the cult of Artemis Orthia continued to play a role. Cicero describes an initiation ritual where naked boys were brutally whipped at the altar of that goddess, and numerous mention contests of choral singing and dancing which may celebrate Artemis and the hunt. It is likely around this time that a game called was developed (although it may have existed in the Classical period), which took place on a small island, and featured a violent, physical contest to force the opposing side into the water. This contest was likely ritual in nature, as two sacrifices were performed before the event could begin. The characterization of the Roman-era &quot;&quot; as especially brutal reinforced the opinion of the Roman public that Spartans were traditionally a harsh, warlike people.

The was the magistrate in charge of overseeing the as a whole. According to Xenophon, the position is as old as the itself, having been created by Lycurgus at the same time. As the ultimate position of authority within the Spartan education system, the was responsible for doling out punishment, but was probably not directly responsible for inflicting it; this would have been delegated to the , a squadron of armed with whips. Plutarch notes that the would observe an &#x27;s punishment of younger boys in his &quot;,&quot; to assess whether or not it was acceptable.

Xenophon stresses the difference between the , a free, high-ranking magistrate, and the (tutors) found in other poleis, who were slaves.

== Reception ==

=== In Antiquity ===
The exact nature of an education in the &#x27; was not hidden from the rest of the Greek world. This is evidenced by the number of non-Spartan sources who wrote about the &#x27;: Thucydides indicates that the &quot;&quot; was well-known throughout Greece in the Classical period, and both Plato and Aristotle praised it as part of an ideal city-state.

Further evidence for this comes from the word &quot;,&quot; which is used to describe foreigners who were educated in the &quot;.&quot; The historian Xenophon is a notable example of this, as his sons reportedly took part in the &quot;&quot; despite being Athenian. Such were likely sponsored and hosted by a Spartan family; Xenophon himself was a friend of King Agesilaus II. This practice likely continued into the Hellenistic Period. Supposedly, Pyrrhus of Epirus hid his intention to overthrow Sparta by claiming that part of his reason for marching on the Peloponnese was to have his sons trained in the &quot;.&quot;

Plutarch, writing after Xenophon and during the Roman era when the Agoge was restored, was critical of this education. He wrote that reading and writing were studied only for practical reasons and that every other form of education was banned in the city-state. Plutarch also emphasized the brutality and indoctrination of the Spartan education system.

=== 19th – 21st centuries ===
In the early 20th century, comparisons were drawn between the Spartan education system and the Royal Prussian Cadets in Germany, praising the harsh education as the driving force behind the cadets&#x27; military prowess. In 1900, Paul von Szczepanski published his novel (&quot;Spartan Youths&quot;) about his education at one such cadet school during the late 19th century. Aside from the name, the book features other references to Spartan training, which Helen Roche believes are indicators that boys at these schools were taught to associate themselves with young Spartans.

In Weimar Germany, after the loss of the First World War, many scholars drew connections with the sacrifice of the Spartan king Leonidas at Thermopylae to justify the deaths of those who died in the war. The mental strength of Leonidas and the 300 was attributed in part to their upbringing in the &quot;.&quot; In the 1930s, the Nazi-aligned professor Helmut Berve praised the Spartan style of education in particular for its ability to weed out those considered &quot;unfit&quot; for society and to create a community of unified warriors. He argued that Nazi leaders should use Sparta as an example of their ideal society, ideas which Hitler himself supposedly agreed with. At the &quot;Adolf Hitler Schule&quot; in Weimar, Germany, schoolchildren were taught that Sparta maintained its power by producing tough, &quot;-&quot;educated warriors.

In the 21st century, the is known primarily in the context of intense physical trials. Spartan Race Inc., an American company, hosts a variety of endurance competitions across the world, the most challenging of which is called &quot;&quot;. It stands as a physical trial rather than a state-sponsored education. In science fiction, &quot;Red Rising&quot; contains a training program based on Greek institutions like the agōgē in the form of a state-sponsored military education system which utilizes Greek names and symbols; the program emphasizes Spartan discipline against Athenian Democracy.

In the American action film &quot;300&quot; (2007), Leonidas is depicted attending the Agoge as a child and fulfilling various physical and mental trials from fighting other children to being whipped as a form of discipline.

Historian Bret Devereaux has compared the Spartan to the indoctrination of child soldiers in modern societies as part of his blog &quot;A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry&quot;.

In the Sony Santa Monica Studio Playstation game &quot;God of War Ragnarok&quot;, the protagonist Kratos talks about his upbringing alongside his brother in the , noting the cruel and violent methods used to train children and how he looked to avoid doing so with his second child, Atreus.

<text>The Desert Sessions are a musical collective series, founded by Josh Homme in 1997. Artists such as Brant Bjork, PJ Harvey, Twiggy Ramirez, Dave Catching, Nick Oliveri, Mark Lanegan, John McBain, Ben Shepherd, Josh Freese, Chris Goss, Alain Johannes, Troy Van Leeuwen, Dean Ween, Les Claypool and many others from the Palm Desert Scene have contributed as songwriters and musicians.

==History==

===Background===
The Desert Sessions began in August 1997 at the Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree when Josh Homme brought together musicians from the bands Monster Magnet, Goatsnake, earthlings?, and Kyuss. The ranch, located in the Mojave Desert, has an old house filled with rare and unique recording equipment and instruments, and was owned by Dave Catching and the late Fred Drake. With the large numbers of musicians arriving to the ranch over time, and with many albums having been produced there, the setting has been described as creating a unique &quot;desert sound&quot; comparable to the grunge rock of Seattle in the early 1990s and the acid rock of San Francisco in the 1960s.

The first Desert Session was not actually a &quot;session&quot; &quot;per se&quot;, but Homme and his band at the time (The Acquitted Felons) playing for three days straight on psychedelic mushrooms. Since then, the Desert Sessions have become legendary, growing in intensity and artistic merit. Homme said:

===Improvisational atmosphere===

Desert Sessions songs are written &quot;on the spot,&quot; often in a matter of hours. Many stories have sprung from the improvisational atmosphere of the ranch. For example, the song &quot;Creosote&quot; from &quot;Volumes 9 &amp; 10&quot; was written by Dean Ween and Alain Johannes on the ranch&#x27;s front porch within four minutes of meeting each other. Similarly, Chris Goss and PJ Harvey wrote the song &quot;There Will Never Be A Better Time&quot; for &quot;I See You Hearin&#x27; Me&quot; after going out onto the porch of the ranch for four minutes with an acoustic guitar; they re-entered the house and recorded the song in one take, the only time the song was ever played by the collective.

===Homme on project delays===

In a 2007 interview with &quot;Rockline&quot;, Homme stated that he was going to be working on a new Desert Sessions album in December 2007, and the first ten will be re-released as a box set. Homme also stated:

After 11 years of inactivity, Homme revealed in October 2014 that he would start working on more Desert Sessions material the following year. Homme added: 

===Desert Sessions Volumes 11 &amp; 12===

Homme remained silent about the project until May 2019, when he posted an image on Instagram with the hashtags &quot;#Desert, #Sessions, #11, #12&quot;. 

In September 2019, &quot;Desert Sessions Volumes 11 &amp; 12&quot; were officially announced, along with a comedic promo video featuring Homme and Liam Lynch. The promo includes Homme running through some of the featured artists such as Billy Gibbons, Les Claypool, and Jake Shears.

In October 2019, recordings of the Desert Sessions were released for the first time in sixteen years.

===Live performances===

The Desert Sessions have only performed live twice. The live performances, which included Joey Castillo, Troy Van Leeuwen, Brian O&#x27;Connor, and Homme, as well as a variety of musicians performing different songs, were performed on an episode of the British music television show &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;, as well as the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2004.

==Awards==

The art directors for &quot;Desert Sessions Volumes 11 &amp; 12&quot;, Doug Cunningham and Jason Noto, won in the category for &quot;Best Recording Package&quot; at the 2021 Grammy Awards.

<text>Leith Hill in southern England is the highest summit of the Greensand Ridge, approximately southwest of Dorking, Surrey and southwest of central London. It reaches above sea level, and is the second highest point in southeast England, after Walbury Hill in southwest Berkshire, (which is high). Leith Hill is the highest ground for .

Four areas of woodland surrounding the hill comprise the Leith Hill Site of Special Scientific Interest, although the summit is excluded from this designation.

The nearest railway station is Holmwood station, to the east, served by Southern trains to London Victoria.

==Leith Hill Tower==

On the summit of Leith Hill is an 18th-century Gothic tower. In 1764–65 Richard Hull of nearby Leith Hill Place built &quot;Prospect House&quot;, later to become known as Leith Hill Tower, with the intention of raising the hill above above sea level. A tower built contemporaneously at the summit of Bredon Hill achieves a similar purpose.

Leith Hill Tower is high and consisted of two rooms &quot;neatly furnished&quot;, with a Latin inscription above the door announcing that it had been built not only for his own pleasure, but also for the enjoyment of others. Hull provided visitors with prospect glasses, similar to a small telescope, through which to survey the extensive views towards London and the English Channel, each some away.

When Hull died in 1772, at his request he was buried under the tower. Following his death, the building was stripped of its contents, doors and windows, and fell into ruin. As a result, the tower was filled with rubble and concrete, and the entrance bricked up.

In 1864, William John Evelyn of nearby Wotton House decided to reopen it, but the concrete made this difficult, and so the additional turreted side-tower was added to allow access to the top of the tower.

At the top of the tower there is a viewpoint indicator to commemorate Walker Miles, whose work in the early days of the Rambler&#x27;s movement contributed to the formation of The Ramblers of Great Britain. It has been claimed that on a clear day, 13 counties can be seen from the top of Leith Hill Tower.

The tower was fully restored by the National Trust in 1984. This restoration included the removal of rubble and concrete, fitting safety features such as a handrail in the narrow staircase, and converting the lower portion of the tower into a servery. Following restoration, the mobile phone operator Cellnet installed a first-generation transmitter station (Base site) into one of the tower rooms, feeding single vertical antennas on the tower roof dressed to look like flag poles.
Leith Hill Tower is open to the public every day from 10:00 am until 3:00 pm on weekdays and 9:00 am to 5:00 pm on weekends, every day of the year except Christmas Day, with a comprehensive display explaining the history of the tower.

==History==

Leith Hill was owned by the Evelyn family of Wotton House from the 17th to the early 20th centuries. On the death of Lt. John Evelyn in 1922, the executors of his will were required to raise money to pay death duties and they therefore offered the Tower and the surrounding five acres of Leith Hill for sale. After a campaign, organised in part by the Commons and Footpath Preservation Society, the land was bought by Wilfred James MacAndrew (a resident of Reigate and former co-owner of the shipping company MacAndrew &amp; Co) and donated to the National Trust.

==Leith Hill Place==

Originally a gabled house dating from about 1600, Leith Hill Place () was completely refaced in a Palladian style about 1760 by Richard Hull. It was bought in 1847 by Josiah Wedgwood III and remained in the family until his grandson, the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, who had been brought up there and eventually inherited it from his brother, immediately gave it to the National Trust on his brother&#x27;s death in 1944. Subsequently, it was leased from the Trust by his cousins Sir Ralph Wedgwood and then Sir John Wedgwood, later becoming a boarding house for a nearby sixth form college, Hurtwood House.

The house was opened to the public by the National Trust in 2013 and now serves as a memorial to Ralph Vaughan Williams. Josiah Wedgwood&#x27;s widow, born Caroline Darwin, created a rhododendron wood there, now open to the public.

==Geology==

Like the other summits of the Greensand Ridge in the south of Surrey, the rock of which Leith Hill is composed, is primarily the Lower Greensand, overlaid with a harder layer of chert. The greensand was deposited in the early Cretaceous, most likely in a shallow sea with low oxygen levels. Over the subsequent 50 million years, other strata were deposited on top of the Lower Greensand, including Gault clay and the chalk of the North and South Downs.

Following the Cretaceous, the sea covering the south of England began to retreat and the land was pushed higher. The Weald (the area covering modern-day south Surrey, south Kent, north Sussex and east Hampshire) was lifted by the same geological processes that created the Alps, resulting in an anticline which stretched across the English Channel to the Artois region of northern France. Initially an island, this dome-like structure was drained by the ancestors of the rivers which today cut through the North and South Downs (including the Mole, Wey and Arun). The dome was eroded away over the course of the Cenozoic, exposing the strata beneath and resulting in the escarpments of the Downs and the Greensand Ridge.

== Search for oil ==
A site on an ancient lane going up the hill was originally chosen by an oil company for exploratory drilling, however due to an active protest campaign and various legal objections raised by local groups and environmentalists, the lease on the land from the Forestry Commission expired before the drilling could start. The Minister for Environment subsequently decided not to renew the lease due to concerns of the effect it would have on nearby ancient woodland. The oil company has since stated it intends to find a new site from which to explore the same prospect. Locals have stated that they will continue to oppose this.

==Geodesy==
Leith Hill Tower was the origin (meridian) of the 6 inch and 1:2500 Ordnance Survey maps of Surrey.

<doc id="658479" wikidata="Q858143" url="?curid=658479" title="Tobata-ku, Kitakyūshū">
<text>is a ward of Kitakyūshū, Fukuoka, Japan. It is the smallest ward of Kitakyūshū city at 16.66 km2. The population was 64,330 as of the national census in 2000.

==History and Geography==

In 1899 Tobata-cho (Tobata town) was created, and in 1924 Tobata-shi (Tobata city). The city was merged into Kitakyushu in 1963. Officially Tobata became a ward of Kitakyushu on April 1, 1963.

Part of Tobata ward faces the sea inlet or firth (Scottish English) called Dokai wan, and the surrounding outer sea is called Hibiki nada. The red-painted bridge between Tobata and Wakamatsu wards is called the Waka-To Ohashi (Great Bridge of Waka-To) and was the first suspension bridge in Asia, completed in 1963. On September 30, 2005 it passed into the control of Kitakyushu city.

A new tunnel was constructed in 2005-8 between Tobata and Wakamatsu wards to link the Hibiki container terminal with Kokura.

Much of this ward, especially the part facing the open sea, is taken up by the Nippon Steel (Shin Nihon Seitetsu) foundries, blast furnaces, and coaling docks. However the numbers employed there are greatly reduced since the heyday of steelmaking in the 1960s, from about 25,000 to 8,000 employees.

The Congregation of Notre Dame has a community in Tobata.

== Cultural Tobata ==

The West Japan Industrial Club (Matsumoto-tei, a house originally built for and owned by Mr. Matsumoto), a large house and garden adjoining Yomiya park, was designed by Tatsuno Kingo who also designed Tokyo Station as a monument to Japan&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War. A scene from the 2003 movie &quot;Spy Sorge&quot; (director Masahiro Shinoda) about Richard Sorge was shot in the garden,

Nearby Kyushu Institute of Technology (founded by Mr. Matsumoto in 1907) has its oldest campus (the faculty of engineering) in Tobata.

The most important annual folk-cultural event is the Tobata Gion festival designated a national intangible cultural asset, and the Kitakyushu city art museum is also here. There are standing exhibits of Western and Japanese art and regularly changing art exhibitions.

Sayagatani field and athletic stadium was built by Yahata steel workers and is still used for ball sports (rugby, soccer etc.) and athletics.

== Education==
*Kyushu Institute of Technology was founded in Tobata in 1907.

==Economy==
Zenrin, a mapping and navigation software company, has its headquarters in the ward.

==Notable people==
The notable rugby player Takuro Miuchi is from Tobata. There is a rugby ground at Astem no Mori, and another at Sayagatani. Miuchi first learned to play rugby at Sayagatani rugby school and later at Yahata High School.

== Transport &amp; Facilities==
There are two JR Kyushu rail stations on the Kagoshima Main Line (Kagoshima honsen): Tobata Station and Kyushu Koudaimae Station, named after Kyushu Institute of Technology which is seven minutes walk from there. Buses are run by the Nishitetsu company.

A small shopping mall, Tobata Aeon, is located next to JR Tobata station. It is a kind of local and down-market department store, as compared with Isetan and Izutsuya in nearby Kokura Kita ward.

Wakato ferry is for passengers with bicycles. It is one of the shortest and cheapest ferries in Japan (three minutes, 100 yen one way).

<text>Send is a village and civil parish in the Guildford borough of the English county of Surrey. The name is thought to mean &quot;sandy place&quot; and sand was extracted at various periods until the 1990s at pits in the outskirts of the parish.

Send is buffered by Metropolitan Green Belt from other villages and towns except for the Grove Heath neighbourhood of Ripley. A rural band of the village adjoins the River Wey including Cartbridge and Send Marsh – this land has been drained and the river tamed by sluices, the Broadmead Cut and the Wey Navigation. The vast majority of the built-up areas are not within an area of flood risk. Between the river and the navigation, in the far north of the parish, are the Papercourt and Broad Mead SSSIs.

==History==
The first record of Send is from a 1063 copy of a survey from , in which the settlement appears as &quot;Sendan&quot;. Throughout the middle ages, it is recorded as &quot;Sande&quot;, &quot;Saunde&quot; and &quot;Sonde&quot;. The name is thought to derive from the Old English &quot;sænde&quot; indicating a sandy place.

Send appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Sande&quot;. It was held by Rainald (Reginald) from Alvred de Merleburgh (Marlborough). Its Domesday assets were: 20 hides; 1 church, 10 ploughs, 2 mills worth £1 3s 6d, 5 fisheries worth 4s 6d, of meadow, woodland for 160 hogs. It rendered £15 10s 0d per year to its overlords. In this case the manorial lords were simply recorded as Herbert; Reginald son of Erchenbald; and Walter, seemingly Anglo-Saxon. It was held at the time of the Norman Conquest by Karli of Norton.

The parish saw a little-known skirmish. On 14 June 1497 the first Cornish Rebellion was launched against Henry VII; the rebels were marching from Cornwall to Kent unbeknown to the King, and after passing Guildford they had a skirmish with some of the outposted royal troops on the road from Guildford to London. The troops fell back or were outmanoeuvred, for they had lost the rebels on the 16th and were looking for them on the Portsmouth Road again near Kingston when they were actually on the border of Kent. Old maps mark the place where the road crosses the stream which joins the Wey near Send as St. Thomas&#x27;s Waterings.

Ripley was, at the time of the Domesday Book, a hamlet of Send. In 1878 Ripley gained its own parish. The earliest official record, such as a Patent Roll, revealing its manor&#x27;s existence is in 1279. Growth in ambition of the local nobility coupled with a large enough population led to the first place of worship being built at Ripley, to become a chapelry to St Mary the Virgin, around the year 1160.

Brickfields were developed in the south of Send by the 1870s, and continued to be worked until at least 1911.

The Leese baronets &quot;of Sendholme in Send in the County of Surrey&quot;, who lived at the large house of that name in the village, bore a title created in 1908 for Joseph Leese, Liberal Member of Parliament for Accrington from 1892 to 1910. The third Baronet was a Lieutenant-General in the Coldstream Guards and served as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Land Forces in South-East Asia from 1944 to 1945 and as General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Eastern Command from 1945 to 1946.

Send was the base of the defunct 1950s Formula One and sports car constructor Connaught Engineering.

==Geography and transport==
Send is a lightly dispersed village centred south-west from Charing Cross and south-west of junction 10 of the M25 and has a developed clustered centre on the old course of the Portsmouth Road which bisects the highest settled part of the village, Burntcommon, which is on the start of rise of the London Clay. This road was relieved by the construction of a six-lane bypass, part of the A3 trunk road, which now forms the long south-east border of the village. The other principal road is the A247 Woking to West Clandon road which passes through the village from north to south.

The parish is bounded to the west and part of its northern side by the River Wey, which is controlled by sluices and has been expanded in capacity by a navigable channel running alongside, the Wey Navigation.

The nearest railway stations are at West Clandon, on the New Guildford Line, and Woking, on the South West Main Line, which offer frequent fast and semi-fast services to London.

White Bus Services operate irregular routes 462 and 463 through Send village between Woking and Guildford, while Falcon Buses runs the hourly route 715 through Burntcommon between Kingston upon Thames and Guildford.

===Soil===
Send is on a gently rising patch of Bagshot Sand, with Cartbridge, like Ripley, on sand and gravel of the lower Wey Valley; a southern part of the parish is on generally higher still London Clay.

===Elevation===
Elevations range from Above Ordnance Datum in the south to at the far northern border on the Wey Navigation.

==Localities==

===Cartbridge===
Cartbridge is a mostly amorphous locality that covers the western end of the village&#x27;s main street, particularly where it turns to the north towards Woking.

===Send Marsh===

The neighbourhood is contiguous with the clustered, built-up estates of Boughton Court Avenue and the Portsmouth Road forming Burntcommon. For census analyses of the largest neighbourhoods in Surrey, in 2001 the county council opted to consider Burntcommon as a non-notable locality jointly with Send Marsh. On this basis its population at the United Kingdom Census 2001 was almost half of the village as a whole, at 1,937.

Send Marsh has Send&#x27;s Grade II listed late 17th century manor house by the village green. It is built of brown brick in English bond. The hamlet has one public house, called the &quot;Saddlers Arms&quot;, but no shops or church.

Unusually for Guildford schools it is within the admission priority area of Guildford&#x27;s George Abbot School most years and the boundaries have not to date excluded it to be replaced by for instance closer areas of north-western Guildford.

===Burntcommon===
Burntcommon is a locality of Send that directly adjoins Send Marsh. Its nearest town is Woking, which lies approximately north-west.

==Amenities==

===Health and well-being===
The small Send Surgery on Send Road next to the Church Rooms closed in 2003 and reopened on Send Barns Lane as the modern Villages Medical Centre serving 7,000 people in Send, Ripley and the surrounding villages. The old surgery is now occupied by a beauty treatment business. The Old Hall, on Send Marsh Road, is now a residential care home.

===Businesses===
The main route through the community runs NE/SW, the A247 Send Road, along which are scattered the shops, businesses and facilities.

These include the post office, a takeaway, diving shop/centre, a fireplace outlet, an independent funerals firm, a hairdressers, a microscope and measuring devices manufacturer, Ghost Production Studios, based at the Old Riding Stables on Send Hill, have worked with several well-known clients, including Paul Connelly, Ben Lovejoy, Sue Macmillan, Social, Satellite State, Go West, Tony Hadley, Heat Wave, Charlie Morgan, Mark Brizickey, Adam Wakeman, Victoria Beckham, Elton John, and Draven.

===Recreation===
Send has a recreation ground, the Lancaster Hall and the Church Rooms. There are two pubs in the village: &quot;The New Inn&quot; in Cartbridge, adjacent to the Wey Navigation and &quot;The Saddlers Arms&quot; in Send Marsh.

===Schools===
Send National School, off Send Hill, was built in 1834 and enlarged in 1892. When the school closed, the building was converted to residential use. It is now known as The Old School.

Send Church of England Central School was built in 1939 but, with war imminent, its opening was delayed until 1941 in case the building was required for military use. During the planning process questions were raised in the House of Commons about the provision of adequate drainage. Initially conceived as a secondary school, it was built on a large plot of land with space for facilities including a light engineering workshop, a carpentry room, a domestic science room and a gymnasium, in addition to a vast playing field. Over time it became known as St Bede&#x27;s and, from 1972, was relaunched as a middle school. Facilities grew to include two outdoor swimming pools.

Send Church of England (Foundation) First School was built in 1958.

Send&#x27;s two schools formed the Federation of Send Church of England Schools on 29 March 2012.

Under its final title, St Bede&#x27;s Church of England (Aided) Junior School buildings were demolished in Summer 2017 and a replacement building for 7– to 11-year-olds was erected on the Send First School site on Send Barns Lane.

===Religion===
====Church of England====

Send parish church is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin and dates from around 1220. The nave was rebuilt and the tower added in around 1485. New kitchen and toilet facilities were completed in 2002. A York stone path was laid in the churchyard in 2003. The church is a Grade II* listed building and is the oldest building still in use in Send. In January 2008 the church was voted Visitor/Leisure Attraction of the Year in the Guildford &quot;Life with Style&quot; awards, attracting 75% of the votes and beating the Royal Horticultural Society gardens at Wisley, Watts Gallery, Guildford Tour Guides and Surrey Hills Llamas. In October 2008 the church received the Mayor of Guildford&#x27;s Award for Access.

====Roman Catholicism====
St William of York (RC) church closed in 2007.

====Evangelical====
Send Evangelical Church opened in May 1974 using the former Congregational chapel in Cartbridge, built in 1875.

===War memorials===

Send has three such memorials.

A Celtic-style stone cross next to the Church Rooms on Send Road rises above these inscriptions:
&quot;1914–1918 In memory of the men of this village who at the call of duty gave their lives their country. Faithful unto death.&quot;
The names of the fallen are:

*(1914–1918) G. Frederick Barnes, William Barnett, Arthur Brackley, William C. Collins, George F. Craddock, Trevor Durrant, Robert G. Fuller, Albert Giles, William Giles, Alan F. M. Grant, David Millard, Archibald Muir, Maurice Simmonds, W. Kenneth Sinclair, Robin R. Skene, Ernest Tickner, Jack Tickner, Herbert W. Walls, Ernest A. Whapshot, Sidney Wright, Alfred Wye.
*(1939–1945) Robert P. Dixon, Bradford W. O. Dockerty, Robin Giles, Rupert P. James, Frank Hack, Hubert E. Murrell, Ian Matheson, Brian T. Opperman, Donald W. S. Price, William Smith, Edward P. Winton, Edward Wood, Leslie Woolley, William Pratt.
A brick memorial mounted with a wrought iron &quot;1914 1918&quot; in the recreation ground near the corner of Send Road and Sandy Lane bears the words: &quot;This recreation ground was purchased by public subscription and was opened on 1 June 1920 for the benefits of the inhabitants of Send as a memorial to the sailors and soldiers who fell and in grateful recognition of those in the village who took part in the Great War of 1914–1918. Trustees: S. S. Boorman, A. H. Lancaster, J. A. Shirer, W. M. Grant, F. W. Morgan Jones, W. G. Whitbourn.&quot;

A stone tablet on the north wall of the nave inside the parish church bears this inscription: &quot;The peal of six bells was hung as a memorial to those of this parish who lost their lives in two world wars and as a thank offering for victory.&quot; The names listed are the same as on the Celtic-cross memorial but with the addition of five people &quot;killed by enemy action&quot;: V. Bowers, H. C. Parsons, H. E. Privett, M. J. Privett and V. Privett. Members of the Privett family were killed on 21 August 1944 by the explosion of a V1 flying bomb which landed on their home at Burnt Common Cottages.

==Demography and housing==
The United Kingdom Census 2011 reported Send&#x27;s population to be 4,245, an increase of 107 since the 2001 census. The number of households was 1,665, an increase of 42 since the 2001 census.
Of the accommodation in the region, 28% was composed of detached houses, and 22.6% was composed of apartments.
The proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

===Occupations===
The high street provides some professional occupations and technical businesses, the schools and nearby prison form most of the government merit services; other occupations existing in the parish include manufacturing, agriculture and food and leisure-related categories of employment. Nonetheless, the village demographically has a very high proportion of professionals and in relation to these, it is part of the London Commuter Belt, with the City of London being the main destination by train from Woking. The nearest entertainment and large retail premises are in Woking. A former landfill in Send is a 20 hectare plantation of short rotation coppice willow.
Occupations of the 2,114 workers between the ages of 16 and 74 were broken down in the 2011 census as follows:

===Population over time===
Data for 1801–1961 is available at Britain Through Time. The loss of Ripley in 1878 ecclesiastically and in 1933 as a secular administrative unit (civil parish) represented almost half of the land area of the village.

==Popular culture==
===Music===
The Send Barns Orchestra, conducted by Jeremy Gilbert, are credited on the 1977 Anthony Phillips album &quot;The Geese and the Ghost&quot;, large parts of which were recorded at his home in Send.

===Film location===
In 1969, a scene for The Telling Bone episode of Catweazle, featuring Geoffrey Bayldon, filmed two backgrounds in Send: Church Lane using the lych gate and Send Parish Church and 1 Heath Farm Cottages, Tannery Lane as &quot;Sam&#x27;s Cottage&quot;. &quot;Sam Woodyard&quot; was played by Neil McCarthy. In 1999, scenes for The Mrs Bradley Mysteries, starring Dame Diana Rigg and Neil Dudgeon, were filmed in the churchyard.

In April 2009, scenes for a BBC Drama production of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Emma&quot;, adapted by Sandy Welch and starring Romola Garai, Michael Gambon, Jonny Lee Miller, Blake Ritson, Dan Fredenburgh, Tamsin Greig and Rupert Evans, were filmed in and around Send Parish Church.

In August 2012, Willow Drive was used to film scenes for Cuban Fury, starring Nick Frost.

==Prison==

Counterintuitively now named after the village is HMP Send, a women&#x27;s prison on the site of a former isolation hospital. Following parish area reduction in the south the jail is now in the southern part of the parish of Ripley surrounded by farmland and woodland.

==Sport==
Send&#x27;s local football team is Send United. There is sailing on Papercourt Lake, which is owned by Papercourt Sailing Club. There is fishing on the River Wey and in the nearby sandpits.

The Concorde Cricket Club, formerly the British Aerospace Cricket Club, is based at Sendholme on Potters Lane. Sendholme was the home of William Hargreaves Leese, who played for the Marylebone Cricket Club in the late 19th century.

==Military residents and events==

Lieutenant-General William Evelyn Colonel of the 29th Foot in the British Army and Member of Parliament for Helston (1767–74), a son of Sir John Evelyn of Wotton, established his home at Send Grove, Church Lane, and he laid out the grounds. On his death, in 1783, it was bought by Admiral Sir Francis William Drake, Governor of Newfoundland (1750–1752), second in command to Rodney in his victory of 1782 over De Grasse. As Rear-Admiral, Drake flew his flag on HMS &quot;Victory&quot; from 26 September to 29 December 1780.

Flight Lieutenant Robin R Skene, one of the first members of the Royal Flying Corps, was buried in the churchyard after crashing in his Blériot monoplane shortly after take-off from Netheravon, Wiltshire, in 1914 on 12 August &quot;en route&quot; to Dover and France at the start of the First World War. He and mechanic R. Barlow were the first members of the Royal Flying Corps to die on active duty and among the first British casualties of the war.
==Flooding==
Following flooding in the east of Send Marsh in 2000, when 16 properties were flooded to a depth of 1m, causing £600,000 of damage, a five-month Environment Agency (EA) scheme costing £400,000 began in February 2007 to reduce the risk from the East Clandon stream. The stream was diverted in the 1870s for brick-making and could revert to its original course when flooded. Demonstrated by the relatively few properties affected, almost all built-up areas in the parish are not subject to flood risk according to EA data.

<text>Tommie C. Smith (born June 6, 1944) is an American former track and field athlete and wide receiver in the American Football League. At the 1968 Summer Olympics, Smith, aged 24, won the 200-meter sprint finals and gold medal in 19.83 seconds – the first time the 20-second barrier was broken officially. His Black Power salute with John Carlos atop the medal podium caused controversy, as it was seen as politicizing the Olympic Games. It remains a symbolic moment in the history of the Black Power movement.

==Early life and career==
Tommie Smith was born on June 6, 1944, in Clarksville, Texas, the seventh of twelve children born to Richard and Dora Smith. He suffered from pneumonia as a child, but still grew to be an athletic youth. While attending Lemoore High School in Lemoore, California, Smith showed great potential, setting most of the school&#x27;s track records, many of which remain. He won the 440-yard dash in the 1963 CIF California State Meet. He was voted Lemoore&#x27;s &quot;Most Valuable Athlete&quot; in basketball, football, and track and field, and was also voted vice president of his senior class. His achievements earned him a scholarship to San José State University.

On May 7, 1966, while he was at San Jose State, Smith set a world best of 19.5 seconds in the 200m straight, which he ran on a cinder track. That record for 200m was finally beaten by Tyson Gay on May 16, 2010, just over 44 years later, though Smith still holds the record for the slightly longer 220-yard event. Since the IAAF has abandoned ratifying records for the event, Smith still retains the official record for the straightaway 200m/220 yards in perpetuity.

A few weeks later, on June 11, 1966, Smith set the record for 200 meters and 220 yards around a turn at 20.0, the first man to do that in 20 seconds. Six days later he won the NCAA Men&#x27;s Outdoor Track and Field Championship. Smith also won the national collegiate 220-yard (201.17 m) title in 1967 before adding the AAU furlong (201.17m) crown as well. He traveled to Japan for the 1967 Summer Universiade and won the 200m gold medal. He repeated as U.S. 200m champion in 1968 and made the Olympic team.

==1968 Summer Olympics==
Leading up to the Olympics, at the U.S. Olympic Trials at Echo Summit, California, San Jose State teammate John Carlos beat Smith and his world record, running 19.92A. John Carlos&#x27; record was disallowed because of the brush spike shoes he was wearing, as was a similar record by Vince Matthews in the 400 meters.

As a member of the Olympic Project for Human Rights (OPHR) Smith originally advocated a boycott of the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games unless four conditions were met: South Africa and Rhodesia uninvited from the Olympics, the restoration of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s world heavyweight boxing title, Avery Brundage to step down as president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the hiring of more African-American assistant coaches. As the boycott failed to achieve support after the IOC withdrew invitations for South Africa and Rhodesia, he decided, together with Carlos, to not only wear their gloves but also go barefoot to protest poverty, wear beads to protest lynchings, and wear buttons that said OPHR.

At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico, Smith nursed an injured groin into the 200m final. In the race, teammate Carlos powered out to the lead through the turn, while Smith got a slow start. Coming off the turn, Smith charged past Carlos and sped to victory. Knowing he had passed his training partner and closest opponent, his victory was so clear, he raised his arms to celebrate 10m before the finish line. Still, he improved upon his own world record that would last for 11 years until Pietro Mennea would surpass it on the same track. Smith&#x27;s time of 19.83 was among the first automatically timed world records for the event as recorded by the IAAF.
Carlos and Smith made headlines around the world by raising their black-gloved fists at the medal award ceremony. Both athletes wore black socks and no shoes on the podium to represent African-American poverty. In support, Peter Norman, the silver medalist who was a white athlete from Australia, participated in the protest by wearing an OPHR badge.
IOC president Avery Brundage deemed it to be a domestic political statement unfit for the apolitical, international forum the Olympic Games were intended to be. In response to their actions, he ordered Smith and Carlos suspended from the US team and banned from the Olympic Village. When the US Olympic Committee refused, Brundage threatened to ban the entire US track team. This threat led to the expulsion of the two athletes from the Games.

A spokesman for the IOC called Smith and Carlos&#x27;s actions &quot;a deliberate and violent breach of the fundamental principles of the Olympic spirit.&quot; Brundage, who was president of the United States Olympic Committee in 1936, had made no objections against Nazi salutes during the Berlin Olympics. He argued that the Nazi salute, being a German national salute at the time, was acceptable in a competition of nations, while the athletes&#x27; salute was not of a nation and therefore unacceptable.

Smith and Carlos faced consequences for challenging white authority in the U.S. Ralph Boston, a black U.S. long jumper at the 1968 games, stated: &quot;The rest of the world didn&#x27;t seem to find it such a derogatory thing. They thought it was very positive. Only America thought it was bad.&quot; The men&#x27;s gesture had lingering effects for all three athletes, the most serious of which were death threats against Smith, Carlos and their families. Following their suspension by the IOC, they faced economic hardship. Silver medalist Norman&#x27;s career suffered greatly in his native Australia as &quot;he returned home […] a pariah, suffering unofficial sanction and ridicule as the Black Power salute&#x27;s forgotten man. He never ran in the Olympics again.&quot;

Smith stated in later years that &quot;We were concerned about the lack of black assistant coaches. About how Muhammad Ali got stripped of his title. About the lack of access to good housing and our kids not being able to attend the top colleges.&quot;

==Athletics and later career==
During his career, Smith set seven individual world records and also was a member of several world-record relay teams at San Jose State, where he was coached by Lloyd (Bud) Winter. With personal records of 10.1 for 100 meters, 19.83 for 200 and 44.5 for the 400, Smith still ranks high on the world all-time lists.

Smith, who had been drafted by the National Football League&#x27;s Los Angeles Rams in the ninth round of the 1967 NFL Draft, signed to play for the American Football League&#x27;s Cincinnati Bengals and was part of the team&#x27;s taxi squad for most of three seasons as a wide receiver. During the 1969 season, he played in two games, catching one pass for 41 yards.

A year after his Olympic win, Smith finished his BA in Social Science at San Jose State University and went on to earn a master&#x27;s in Social Change from Goddard College, whose program enabled Smith to integrate his teaching and writing practices into his coursework.

After his track and football careers, he became a member of the United States National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1978. In 1996, Smith was inducted into the California Black Sports Hall of Fame, and in 1999 he received that organization&#x27;s Sportsman of the Millennium Award. In 2000 and 2001 the County of Los Angeles and the State of Texas presented Smith with commendation, recognition and proclamation awards.

He later became a track coach at Oberlin College in Ohio, where he also taught sociology and until 2005 was a faculty member teaching physical education at Santa Monica College in Santa Monica, California.

In August 2008, he gave 2008 Olympic triple gold winner Usain Bolt of Jamaica one of his shoes from the 1968 Olympics as a birthday gift.

In 2010, Smith put his gold medal and spikes up for auction. Bids started at $250,000, and the sale was scheduled to close November 4, 2010. In 2013, Goddard College honored Smith as an alumnus by awarding him the Presidential Award for Activism in 2013.

== Books ==
Smith&#x27;s autobiography (co-written with David Steele), &quot;Silent Gesture&quot; was published in 2007 by Temple University Press. It was named a 2008 Adult Nonfiction Honor Book by the Black Caucus of the American Library Association and nominated for a 2008 NAACP Image Award.

Smith&#x27;s second book &quot;Victory. Stand! Raising My Fist for Justice&quot; was published in 2022 by Norton Young Readers. The graphic memoir was co-written with Derrick Barnes and illustrated by Dawud Anyabwile. The book received literary acclaim. It won the 2023 YALSA Award for Excellence in Nonfiction and was recognized as a 2023 Corretta Scott King Award Author and Illustrator Honor Book as well as a finalist for the 2022 National Book Award for Young People&#x27;s Literature.

==Personal life==
Smith first married Jimi Denise Paschal from 1967 to 1973, with whom he had one child. He then married Denise M. &quot;Akiba&quot; Kyle in 1977, with whom he had four children. The two divorced in 2000, and Smith married Delois Jordan in the same year.

==Recognition==
Tommie Smith is featured in the 1999 HBO documentary &quot;Fists of Freedom: The Story of the &#x27;68 Summer Games&quot;. The documentary looks at events leading up to, during and after the 1968 Olympics. It features interviews with Smith, Carlos and sociologist Harry Edwards. There is archival footage of the Games and the fallout after the raised fist salutes by Carlos and Smith. Smith says in the programme:

We were not Antichrists. We were just human beings who saw a need to bring attention to the inequality in our country. I don&#x27;t like the idea of people looking at it as negative. There was nothing but a raised fist in the air and a bowed head, acknowledging the American flag – not symbolizing a hatred for it.

For his lifelong commitment to athletics, education, and human rights, Smith received the Courage of Conscience Award from The Peace Abbey in Sherborn, Massachusetts. In 2004, a sports hall bearing his name was inaugurated in his presence at Saint-Ouen, France.

In 2005, a statue titled &quot;Victory Salute&quot; showing Smith and Carlos on the medal stand was constructed by political artist Rigo 23 and dedicated on the campus of San Jose State University. Norman&#x27;s silver medal position was left vacant at his request, so visitors could pose for photos in solidarity with Smith and Carlos, as Norman had stood.

A mural of the photo taken with Smith on the podium at the 1968 Olympics with Carlos and Norman was painted on the brick wall of a residence in Newtown, New South Wales, Australia, titled &quot;Three Proud People Mexico 68&quot;. The house&#x27;s owner, Silvio Offria, allowed an artist known only as &quot;Donald&quot; to paint the mural, and said that Norman came to Newtown to see the mural and have his photo taken with it before he died in 2006. The mural faces the train tracks linking Sydney city to the Western and Southern Suburbs. In 2012, the Sydney City Council heritage listed the mural to safeguard it, after it had faced possible demolition in 2010 to make way for a railway tunnel. Smith and Carlos were pallbearers at Norman&#x27;s funeral in Melbourne in 2006.

On July 16, 2008, Smith and Carlos accepted the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage for the salute at the 2008 ESPY Awards. In 2018, Smith received the Dresden Peace Prize.

The Tommie Smith Youth Track Meet is held annually in his honor. It has been both an AAU and USATF-sponsored event, held at the University of California, Berkeley at Edwards Stadium.

San Jose State University has secured funding to rebuild the track and field complex. The centerpiece is Speed City Legacy Center, which pays tribute to SJSU alumni track stars and civil rights advocates.

<doc id="658488" wikidata="Q328935" url="?curid=658488" title="Simon Reeve (British TV presenter)">
<text>Simon Alan Reeve (born 21 July 1972) is an English author, journalist, adventurer, documentary filmmaker and television presenter. 

Reeve has made global travel and environmental documentaries, and has written books on international terrorism, modern history, and his adventures. Amongst his many television programmes and series for the BBC, Reeve has presented &quot;Holidays in the Danger Zone: Places That Don&#x27;t Exist&quot;, &quot;Tropic of Cancer with Simon Reeve&quot;, &quot;Equator&quot; and &quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot;.

He is the author of &quot;The New Jackals&quot; (1998), &quot;One Day in September&quot; (2005) and &quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot; (2007). He has received a One World Broadcasting Trust Award and the 2012 Ness Award from the Royal Geographical Society (RGS).

== Early life ==
Reeve was born and raised in Acton, West London, by his parents, Alan Reeve, who was a teacher, and Cindy Reeve, who was an occupational therapist and worked in restaurants. He has a younger brother called James. He attended the Twyford Church of England High School in Acton.

Reeve had a &quot;tense and sometimes violent relationship&quot; with his father when he was growing up. He said that in his house &quot;there was endless shouting, lots of crashing and banging, and a few times it was so violent we or our neighbours called the police to come and break us up&quot;.

Reeve carried a knife by the age of 12 or 13. From the age of 14, he required counselling due to behavioural problems, such as starting fires, vandalism, and setting off an explosive at the Ealing Broadway Centre.

He described his final months at school being &quot;a bit of a blur&quot;. He left school with one GCSE, living on Income Support, and with mental health problems. At the age of 17, Reeve stated he was even a &quot;whisker away&quot; from suicide. He found himself standing on the edge of a bridge, unable to &quot;face existence&quot;, but something made him climb back.

==Career ==

After leaving school, he took a series of jobs, including working in a supermarket, a jewellery shop and a charity shop. At the age of 18, he began work at the British newspaper &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, initially as a post boy and then in the cuttings library, where he assisted a team of investigative journalists. During this time he spent nights working on investigations into nuclear and weapons smuggling, and terrorism. One of his formative roles at 18 was to follow a weapons dealer from Gatwick Airport.

At the age of 21, citing his &quot;fearlessness of youth&quot;, Reeve was investigating the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. He wrote a book &quot;The New Jackals: Ramzi Yousef, Osama bin Laden and the Future of Terrorism&quot;; eventually published in 1998, it was the first book on Osama bin Laden, Ramzi Yousef, and al-Qaeda; this became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. Classified documents obtained by the author, with uninhibited access from the likes of the FBI and the CIA, detailed the existence, development, and aims of al-Qaeda, yet his book&#x27;s warning of an apocalyptic act by terrorists went unnoticed.

After the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States of America, Reeve became a media expert on terrorism on the basis of his book. The BBC initially wanted him to make a programme involving infiltrating al-Qaeda. He eventually began making travel documentaries. Tom Hall, travel editor for Lonely Planet publications, has described Reeve&#x27;s travel documentaries as &quot;the best travel television programmes of the past five years&quot;.

In January 2013, Reeve appeared in a charity special of &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot;.

6 September 2018 saw the release of Reeve&#x27;s autobiography called &quot;Step by Step: The Life in My Journeys&quot;; covering his humble beginnings to successful author and television presenter.

After catching malaria on a journey around the Equator, Reeve became an ambassador for the Malaria Awareness Campaign. Along with Sir David Attenborough and other conservation specialists, Reeve is a member of the Council of Ambassadors for WWF, one of the world&#x27;s leading environmental organisations.

In 2020, Reeve was commissioned to present his first UK-based travel show &quot;Cornwall With Simon Reeve&quot;, which was ordered by BBC Two alongside &quot;Incredible Journeys With Simon Reeve&quot;. The latter show is due to be a &#x27;look back&#x27; programme similar to &quot;Joanna Lumley&#x27;s Unseen Adventures&quot; or &quot;Michael Palin: Travels of a Lifetime&quot; (a show which featured both Reeve and Lumley talking about the ex-Monty Python actor&#x27;s travels).

Reeve has made global travel and environmental documentaries, and has written books on international terrorism, modern history, and his adventures.

==Personal life==
Reeve is married to Anya Reeve (née Courts), a television camerawoman and campaigner who has stood as a Green Party candidate. The couple have a son called Jake.

Reeve divides his home time between London and Devon.

In January 2022, Reeve was the castaway for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. His musical choices included Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Vissi d&#x27;arte&quot; by Kiri Te Kanawa, &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot; by The Killers and &quot;Rocket Man&quot; by Elton John.

<text>Operation Cartwheel (1943 – 1944) was a major military operation for the Allies in the Pacific theatre of World War II. Cartwheel was an operation aimed at neutralising the major Japanese base at Rabaul. The operation was directed by the Supreme Allied Commander in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), General Douglas MacArthur, whose forces had advanced along the northeast coast of New Guinea and occupied nearby islands. Allied forces from the South Pacific Area, under Admiral William Halsey, advanced through the Solomon Islands toward Bougainville. The Allied forces involved were from Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United States, and various Pacific Islands.

==Background==

Japanese forces had captured Rabaul, on New Britain, in the Territory of New Guinea, from Australian forces in February 1942 and turned it into their major forward base in the South Pacific, which became the main obstacle in the two Allied theatres. MacArthur formulated a strategic outline, the Elkton Plan, to capture Rabaul from bases in Australia and New Guinea. Admiral Ernest J. King, the Chief of Naval Operations, proposed a plan with similar elements but under Navy command. Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall, whose main goal was for the US to concentrate its efforts against Nazi Germany in Europe and not against the Japanese in the Pacific, proposed a compromise plan in which the task would be divided into three stages, the first under Navy command and the other two under MacArthur&#x27;s direction and the control of the Army. This strategic plan, which was never formally adopted by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff but was ultimately implemented, called for the following:
*Capturing Tulagi (later Guadalcanal) and the Santa Cruz Islands (Operation Watchtower)
*Capturing the northeastern coast of New Guinea and the central Solomons
*Reducing Rabaul and related bases

The protracted battle for Guadalcanal, followed by the unopposed seizure of the Russell Islands (&quot;Operation Cleanslate&quot;) on 21 February 1943, resulted in Japanese attempts to reinforce the area by sea. MacArthur&#x27;s air forces countered in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea from 2–5 March 1943. The disastrous losses suffered by the Japanese prompted Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto to initiate Operation I-Go, a series of air attacks against Allied airfields and shipping at both Guadalcanal and New Guinea, which ultimately resulted in his death on 18 April 1943.

==Implementation==

On 12 February 1943 MacArthur presented &quot;Elkton III&quot;, his revised plan for taking Rabaul before 1944. It called for him to attack northeastern New Guinea and western New Britain and for Admiral William F. Halsey Jr., commander of the South Pacific Area, to attack the central Solomons. The plan required seven more divisions than were already in the theatre, which raised objections from the British. The Joint Chiefs responded with a directive that approved the plan if forces already in the theatre or &quot;en route&quot; were used, and the implementation was delayed by 60 days. &quot;Elkton III&quot; then became &quot;Operation Cartwheel&quot;.

===Operations===

Cartwheel identified 13 proposed subordinate operations and set a timetable for their launching. Of the 13, Rabaul, Kavieng, and Kolombangara were eventually eliminated as too costly and unnecessary, and only 11 were actually undertaken (the Green Islands, only 117 miles from Rabaul, were substituted for Kavieng):

**Saidor (32nd Infantry Division US) – 2 January 1944
*Green Islands - 15 February 1944 (3rd Division New Zealand)
*Admiralty Islands – 29 February 1944 (1st Cavalry Division US)
*Emirau Island – 20 March 1944 (4th Marine Regiment US)

The New Guinea Force, under General Thomas Blamey, was assigned responsibility for the eastward thrusts on mainland New Guinea. The US 6th Army, under General Walter Krueger, was to take Kiriwina, Woodlark, and Cape Gloucester. The land forces would be supported by Allied air units under Lieutenant General George Kenney and naval units under Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender.

In the midst of Operation Cartwheel, the Joint Chiefs met with President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill at the Quadrant Conference in Quebec City in August 1943. There, the decision was made to bypass and isolate Rabaul rather than attempting to capture the base and to attack Kavieng instead. Soon afterward, the decision was made to bypass Kavieng as well. Although initially objected to by MacArthur, the bypassing of Rabaul instead of its neutralisation meant that his Elkton plan had been achieved, and after invading Saidor he then moved into his Reno Plan, an advance across the north coast of New Guinea to Mindanao. The campaign, which stretched into 1944, showed the effectiveness of a strategy of avoiding major concentrations of enemy forces and instead aiming to sever the Japanese lines of supply and communication.

===Neutralisation of Rabaul===

The Japanese Navy decided to try to save Rabaul by sending hundreds of airplanes from aircraft carriers based at Truk in December 1943 to counter the US and Australian bombers. But the only thing that this operation accomplished was the destruction of 200–300 of their own irreplaceable carrier planes and the loss of experienced naval aviators. This degradation of the Japanese aircraft carrier air fleet led to preparations by the US Navy to start the Marianas campaign a few months later. Also, the Admiralty Islands campaign was conducted starting in late February after the Allies confirmed that Rabaul no longer had any airplanes.

By February 1944 Rabaul had no more fighters or bombers for the rest of the war because of the non-stop bombing by land-based Allied airplanes only a few hundred miles from Rabaul after most of Operation Cartwheel was completed. 120 airplanes were evacuated to Truk on 19 February in an attempt to replace the destroyed Navy carrier airplanes. Rabaul&#x27;s valuable mechanics attempted to leave Rabaul by ship on 21 February, but their ship, the , was sunk by Allied bombers. Rabaul became a death trap as the Japanese refused to surrender even as their food and medicine ran out.

<doc id="658501" wikidata="Q954210" url="?curid=658501" title="Savitch's theorem">
<text>In computational complexity theory, Savitch&#x27;s theorem, proved by Walter Savitch in 1970, gives a relationship between deterministic and non-deterministic space complexity. It states that for any function formula_1,
:formula_2

In other words, if a nondeterministic Turing machine can solve a problem using formula_3 space, a deterministic Turing machine can solve the same problem in the square of that space bound. Although it seems that nondeterminism may produce exponential gains in time (as formalized in the unproven exponential time hypothesis), Savitch&#x27;s theorem shows that it has a markedly more limited effect on space requirements.

== Proof ==
The proof relies on an algorithm for STCON, the problem of determining whether there is a path between two vertices in a directed graph, which runs in formula_4 space for formula_5 vertices. The basic idea of the algorithm is to solve recursively a somewhat more general problem, testing the existence of a path from a vertex formula_6 to another vertex formula_7 that uses at most formula_8 edges, for a parameter formula_8 given as input. STCON is a special case of this problem where formula_8 is set large enough to impose no restriction on the paths (for instance, equal to the total number of vertices in the graph, or any larger value). To test for a formula_8-edge path from formula_6 to formula_7,
a deterministic algorithm can iterate through all vertices formula_14, and recursively search for paths of half the length from formula_6 to formula_14 and from formula_14 to formula_7.
This algorithm can be expressed in pseudocode (in Python syntax) as follows:

def stcon(s, t) -&gt; bool:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Test whether a path of any length exists from s to t&quot;&quot;&quot;
 return k_edge_path(s, t, n) # n is the number of vertices

def k_edge_path(s, t, k) -&gt; bool:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Test whether a path of length at most k exists from s to t&quot;&quot;&quot;
 if k == 0:
 return s == t
 if k == 1:
 return (s, t) in edges
 for u in vertices:
 if k_edge_path(s, u, floor(k / 2)) and k_edge_path(u, t, ceil(k / 2)):
 return True
 return False

Because each recursive call halves the parameter formula_8, the number of levels of recursion is formula_20. Each level requires formula_21 bits of storage for its function arguments and local variables: formula_8 and the vertices formula_6, formula_7, and formula_14 require formula_20 bits each. The total auxiliary space complexity is thus formula_4. The input graph is considered to be represented in a separate read-only memory and does not contribute to this auxiliary space bound. Alternatively, it may be represented as an implicit graph. Although described above in the form of a program in a high-level language, the same algorithm may be implemented with the same asymptotic space bound on a Turing machine.

This algorithm can be applied to an implicit graph whose vertices represent the configurations of a nondeterministic Turing machine and its tape, running within a given space bound formula_3. The edges of this graph represent the nondeterministic transitions of the machine, formula_6 is set to the initial configuration of the machine, and formula_7 is set to a special vertex representing all accepting halting states. In this case, the algorithm returns true when the machine has a nondeterministic accepting path, and false otherwise. The number of configurations in this graph is formula_31, from which it follows that applying the algorithm to this implicit graph uses space formula_32. Thus by deciding connectivity in a graph representing nondeterministic Turing machine configurations, one can decide membership in the language recognized by that machine, in space proportional to the square of the space used by the Turing machine.

== Corollaries ==
Some important corollaries of the theorem include:
; PSPACE = NPSPACE
: That is, the languages that can be recognized by deterministic polynomial-space Turing machines and nondeterministic polynomial-space Turing machines are the same. This follows directly from the fact that the square of a polynomial function is still a polynomial function. It is believed that a similar relationship does not exist between the polynomial time complexity classes, P and NP, although this is still an open question.
; NL ⊆ L2
: That is, all languages that can be solved nondeterministically in logarithmic space can be solved deterministically in the complexity class formula_33 This follows from the fact that STCON is NL-complete.

<doc id="658508" wikidata="Q2060870" url="?curid=658508" title="Nampeyo">
<text>Nampeyo (1859 – 1942) was a Hopi-Tewa potter who lived on the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. Her Tewa name was also spelled Num-pa-yu, meaning &quot;snake that does not bite&quot;. Her name is also cited as &quot;Nung-beh-yong,&quot; Tewa for Sand Snake.

She used ancient techniques for making and firing pottery and used designs from &quot;Old Hopi&quot; pottery and shards found at 15th-century Sikyátki ruins on First Mesa. Her artwork is in collections in the United States and Europe, including many museums like the National Museum of American Art, Museum of Northern Arizona, Spurlock Museum, and the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University.

A world record for Southwest American Indian pottery was declared at Bonhams Auction House in San Francisco on December 6, 2010, when one of Nampeyo&#x27;s art works, a decorated ceramic pot, sold for $350,000.

==Early life==

Nampeyo was born on First Mesa in the village of Hano, also known as Tewa Village which is primarily made up of descendants of the Tewa people from Northern New Mexico who fled west to Hopi lands about 1702 for protection from the Spanish after the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. Her mother, White Corn was Tewa; her father Quootsva, from nearby Walpi, was a member of the Snake clan of the Hopi Nation. According to tradition, Nampeyo was born into her mother&#x27;s Tewa Corn clan. Tradition also gave her paternal grandmother the role of naming her. Her grandmother, a member of the Snake clan, named the baby Tcu-mana, or snake-girl in the Hopi language. Her mother&#x27;s family, who she lived with, spoke Tewa, and so called her Nampeyo, which has the same meaning. She had three older brothers, Tom Polacca, Kano, and Patuntupi, also known as Squash; Her brothers were born from about 1849 to 1858. Nampeyo could not read or write and never went to school.

William Henry Jackson first photographed her in 1875; she was reputedly one of the most photographed ceramic artists in the Southwest during the 1870s.

Shortly after this photograph, Nampeyo married Kwivoya, but their marriage was unsuccessful and they never cohabitated. About 1878 or 1881, Nampeyo married her second husband, Lesou (or Lesso), a member of the Cedarwood clan at Walpi. Their first daughter, Annie, was born in 1884; William Lesso, was born about 1893; Nellie was born in 1896; Wesley in 1899; and Fannie was born in 1900.

==Artwork==

Hopi people make ceramics painted with beautiful designs, and Nampeyo was eventually considered one of the finest Hopi potters. Nampeyo may have learned Hopi pottery making through the efforts of her father&#x27;s mother, though her biographer Barbara Kramer believes this theory implausible.

In the 1870s, Nampeyo made a steady income by selling her work at a local trading post operated by Thomas Keam. By 1881 she was already known for her works of &quot;old Hopi&quot; pottery of Walpi.Nampeyo became increasingly interested in ancient pottery form and design, recognizing them as superior to Hopi pottery produced at the time. Lesou, her husband, was reputedly employed by the archaeologist J. Walter Fewkes at the excavation of the ancient ruins of the Hopi village Sikyátki on the First Mesa in the 1890s. Lesou helped Nampeyo find potsherds with ancient designs which they copied onto paper and were later integrated into Nampeyo&#x27;s pottery. However, she began making copies of protohistoric pottery from the 15th through 17th centuries from ancient village sites, such as Sikyátki, which was explored before Fewkes and Thomas Varker Keam. Nampeyo developed her own style based on the traditional designs, known as Hopi Revival pottery from old Hopi designs and Sikyátki pottery. This is why researchers refer to her style as Sikyatki Revival after the proto-historic site.Keam hired First Mesa potters to make reproductions of the works. Nampeyo was particularly skilled. Her pottery became a success and was collected throughout the United States and in Europe.

Kate Cory, an artist and photographer who lived among the Hopi from 1905 to 1912 at Oraibi and Walpi, wrote that Nampeyo used sheep bones in the fire, which are believed to have made the fire hot or made the pottery whiter, and smoothed the fired pots with a plant with a red blossom. Both techniques are ancient Tewa pottery practices. Nampeyo used up to five different clays in one creation when the usual was two.

Nampeyo and her husband traveled to Chicago in 1898 to exhibit her pottery. Between 1905 and 1907, she produced and sold pottery out of a pueblo-like structure called Hopi House, a tourist attraction (combination of museum, curio shop, theatre, and living space for Native American dancers and artists) at the Grand Canyon lodge, operated by the Fred Harvey Company. She exhibited in 1910 at the Chicago United States Land and Irrigation Exposition.

One of her famous patterns, the migration pattern, represented the migration of the Hopi people, with feather and bird-claw motifs. An example is a 1930s vase in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. Her work is distinguished by the shapes of the pottery and the designs. She made wide, low, rounded, shaped pottery and, in later years, tall jars. Many of her works are identifiable by her &quot;recognizable designs&quot; and &quot;her artistic idiosyncrasies.&quot;

Nampeyo&#x27;s photograph was often used on travel brochures for the American southwest.

Nampeyo began to lose her sight due to trachoma about the turn of the 20th century. From 1925 until her death she made pottery by touch and they were then painted by her husband, daughters or other family members. Because the painters were different, the style changed to be busier and more geometric.

==Death and legacy==

Nampeyo died in 1942 at the home of her son Wesley and her daughter-in-law, Cecilia.

She was a symbol of the Hopi people and was a leader in the revival of ancient pottery. She inspired dozens of family members over several generations to make pottery, including daughters Fannie Nampeyo and Annie Healing. A 2014 exhibit at the Museum of Northern Arizona presents the works of four generations of artists descended from Nampeyo.

In 2010, one of Nampeyo&#x27;s artworks, a pot with a bulbous form with Hopi Kachina figures with &quot;stylized faces&quot; wearing &quot;flamboyant black and burnt-umber headdresses&quot; painted on &quot;four sides of the pot&quot;—sold for $350,000. Previous owners included Carter Harrison IV (who served as mayor of Chicago from 1897 to 1907 and 1911–1915), and the Cliff Dwellers Club art club (who were gifted the work by Harrison in the 1930s).

<doc id="658511" wikidata="Q3132093" url="?curid=658511" title="Eco-industrial park">
<text>An eco-industrial park (EIP) is an industrial park in which businesses cooperate with each other and with the local community in an attempt to reduce waste and pollution, efficiently share resources (such as information, materials, water, energy, infrastructure, and natural resources), and help achieve sustainable development, with the intention of increasing economic gains and improving environmental quality. An EIP may also be planned, designed, and built in such a way that it makes it easier for businesses to co-operate, and that results in a more financially sound, environmentally friendly project for the developer.

The Eco-industrial Park Handbook states that &quot;An Eco-Industrial Park is a community of manufacturing and service businesses located together on a common property. Members seek enhanced environmental, economic, and social performance through collaboration in managing environmental and resource issues.&quot;

Based on the concepts of industrial ecology, collaborative strategies not only include by-product synergy (&quot;waste-to-feed&quot; exchanges), but can also take the form of wastewater cascading, shared logistics and shipping &amp; receiving facilities, shared parking, green technology purchasing blocks, multi-partner green building retrofit, district energy systems, and local education and resource centres. This is an application of a systems approach, in which designs and processes/activities are integrated to address multiple objectives.

EIPs can be developed as greenfield land projects, where the eco-industrial intent is present throughout the planning, design and site construction phases, or developed through retrofits and new strategies in existing industrial developments.

==Examples==

&quot;Industrial symbiosis&quot; is a related but more limited concept in which companies in a region collaborate to utilize each other&#x27;s by-products and otherwise share resources. In Kalundborg, Denmark, a symbiosis network links a 1500MW coal-fired power plant with the community and other companies. Surplus heat from this power plant is used to heat 3500 local homes in addition to a nearby fish farm, whose sludge is then sold as a fertilizer. Steam from the power plant is sold to Novo Nordisk, a pharmaceutical and enzyme manufacturer, in addition to a Statoil plant. This reuse of heat reduces the amount thermal pollution discharged to a nearby fjord. Additionally, a by-product from the power plant&#x27;s sulfur dioxide scrubber contains gypsum, which is sold to a wallboard manufacturer. Almost all of the manufacturer&#x27;s gypsum needs are met this way, which reduces the amount of open-pit mining needed. Furthermore, fly ash and clinker from the power plant is utilized for road building and cement production.

The industrial symbiosis at Kalundborg was not created as a top-down initiative, but instead evolved gradually. As environmental regulations became stricter, firms were motivated reduce the cost of compliance, and turn their by-products into economic products.

In Canada, eco-industrial parks exist across the country and have enjoyed some success. The best known example is Burnside Park, in Halifax, Nova Scotia. With support from Dalhousie University’s Eco-Efficiency Centre, the more than 1,500 businesses have been improving their environmental performance and developing profitable partnerships. Subsequently, two greenfield industrial developments have been started in Alberta: TaigaNova Eco-Industrial Park is in the heart of the Athabasca oil sands, while Innovista Eco-Industrial Park is a gateway to the Rocky Mountains ~300 km west of Edmonton.

UNIDO Viet Nam (United Nations Industrial Development Organization) has compiled a list in 2015 of Eco-Industrial Parks (EIP) in the ASEAN Economic Community in a report titled &quot;Economic Zones in the ASEAN &quot; written by Arnault Morisson.

==Other usage==
EIPs also refer to industrial parks where a &quot;green&quot; approach has been taken towards the infrastructure and development of the site. This can include green infrastructure related to Renewable Energy Systems; stormwater, groundwater and wastewater management; road surfaces; and transportation demand management. Green building practices can also be encouraged or mandated

EIPs are often used as a stimulus for economic diversification in the community or region where they are located. Anchor tenants, such as bio-based product manufacturers or waste-to-energy facilities, etc., can attract complementary businesses as suppliers, scavengers/recyclers, service providers, downstream users and other businesses that could benefit from eco-industrial strategies.

==Suggested usage==

It is suggested that EIPs be used as a means of growing the renewable energy sector. In the case of a Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Manufacturing plant, an EIP can increase the manufacturing efficiency to make it more economical, while reducing the environmental impact of producing the solar cells. In essence, this assists the growth of the renewable energy industry and the environmental benefits that come with replacing fossil-fuels.

<doc id="658513" wikidata="Q452130" url="?curid=658513" title="Amado Nervo">
<text>Amado Nervo (August 27, 1870 – May 24, 1919) also known as Juan Crisóstomo Ruiz de Nervo, was a Mexican poet, journalist and educator. He also acted as Mexican Ambassador to Argentina and Uruguay. His poetry was known for its use of metaphor and reference to mysticism, presenting both love and religion, as well as Christianity and Hinduism. Nervo is noted as one of the most important Mexican poets of the 19th century.

== Early life ==

Amado Nervo was born in Tepic, Nayarit in 1870. His father died when Nervo was 5 years old. Two more deaths were to mark his life: the suicide of his brother Luis, who was also a poet, and the death of his wife Ana Cecilia Luisa Dailliez, just 10 years after marriage.

His early studies were at the Colegio San Luis Gonzaga, located in Jacona, Michoacán. After graduation, he began studying at the Roman Catholic Seminary in nearby Zamora. His studies at the seminary included science, philosophy and the first year of law. It was here, that Nervo cultivated an interest in mystical theories, which were reflected in some of his early works.

While Nervo had early plans to join the priesthood, economic hardship led him to accept a desk job in Tepic. He later moved to Mazatlán, where he alternately worked in the office of a lawyer and as a journalist for &quot;El Correo de la Tarde (The Evening Mail)&quot;. He went on to become a successful poet, journalist, and international diplomat.

== Professional background ==

=== Writing career ===

In 1894, Nervo continued his career in Mexico City, where he became known and appreciated, working in the magazine &quot;Azul&quot;, with Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera. It was during this time that he was introduced to the work of Luis G. Urbina, Tablada, Dávalos, Rubén Darío, José Santos Chocano, and Campoamor. His background in journalism and news reporting flourished during these years, as he continued writing for &quot;El Universal&quot;, &quot;El Nacional&quot;, and &quot;El Mundo&quot;. He maintained a formal partnership with &quot;El Mundo&quot; through June 1897.

In October 1897, &quot;El Mundo&quot; launched a supplement called &quot;La Comedia del Mundo&quot;, with Nervo taking responsibility for the overall production. In January 1898, the supplement was established independently from &quot;El Mundo&quot; and changed its name to &quot;La Comedia&quot;.

Nervo gained a national reputation in the literary community after the publication of his novel &quot;El bachiller&quot; (&quot;The Bachelor&quot;) and his books of poetry, including &quot;Místicas&quot; (&quot;Mystical&quot;) and &quot;Perlas Negras&quot; (&quot;Black Pearls&quot;).

In 1898, Nervo founded, along with Jesús Valenzuela, &quot;La Revista Moderna&quot; (&quot;The Modern Magazine&quot;). The magazine was the successor to &quot;Azul&quot;. He was the cousin of the renowned artist Roberto Montenegro Nervo. His cousin&#x27;s first illustrations were produced for &quot;La Revista Moderna&quot; magazine.

In 1902, Nervo wrote &quot;La Raza de Bronce&quot; (&quot;The Bronze Race&quot;) in honor of Benito Juárez, former president of Mexico. In 1919, Bolivian writer Alcides Arguedas used the term in his novel, &quot;Raza de Bronce&quot;. In 1925, the term was used by Mexican luminary José Vasconcelos in his essay, &quot;La Raza Cósmica&quot;.

Nervo spent the first years of the twentieth century in Europe, particularly in Paris. While there, he was an academic correspondent of the Academia Mexicana de la Lengua. While in Paris, Nervo befriended Enrique Gómez Carrillo and Aurora Cáceres, for whom he wrote a prologue for the book &quot;La rosa muerta&quot;.

=== International diplomacy ===

When Nervo moved back to Mexico, he was appointed the Mexican Ambassador to Argentina and Uruguay.

== Personal background ==

In 1901, while he was in Paris he met and married Ana Cecilia Luisa Dailliez. They lived happily until her death in 1912. Out of his grief and desperation, Nervo wrote his most important work, &quot;La Amada Inmóvil (The Immovable Loved One)&quot;, published posthumously in 1922.
There is a rumor that when his wife died he used to go to the cemetery every night for one year.

== Death ==

Following Amado Nervo&#x27;s death in Montevideo, Uruguayan president Baltasar Brum ordered that his body be returned to Mexico aboard the cruiser &quot;Uruguay&quot; and Nervo was interred November 14, 1919, in the &quot;Rotonda de las Personas Ilustres&quot; of Panteón de Dolores, in Mexico City.

== Legacy ==

* The Amado Nervo Museum displays photos and writings of Nervo. The museum can be found in the home where he was born, on the street which now bears his name.
* A long stretch of the Durango State Highway at San José de Tuitán and Villa Unión, Durango is named after Nervo.
* The Amado Nervo International Airport, the principal airport in the Mexican state of Nayarit, located in Tepic was also named after him.
* The Amado Nervo Institute in Camargo, Chihuahua is a private school, serving kindergarten through junior high school.
* In 1929, Mexican writer, Francisco Monterde wrote a biographical work about Nervo simply titled, &quot;Amado Nervo&quot;.
* In 1943, Mexican poet, Bernardo Ortiz de Montellano wrote a biographical work about Nervo entitled, &quot;Figura, amor y muerte de Amado Nervo&quot;.
*In 1961, Argentine composer Julia Stilman-Lasansky used Nervo’s text for her composition Cantata No. 1. 
* In 2002, Carlos Monsiváis, the Mexican journalist and political activist wrote an essay entitled, &quot;Yo te bendigo, vida&quot;, which was about Amado Nervo.
* In 2006, musical artist Rodrigo de la Cadena presented &quot;Poema: Por Cobardia&quot;, which was a poem by Nervo&#x27;s set to music. The song was recorded on de la Cadena&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Boleros con Orquesta&quot;.

<text>Jacques François Poos (3 June 1935 – 19 February 2022) was a Luxembourgish politician from the Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (LSAP).

==Early life and education==
Born in 1935, in Luxembourg, Poos was a trained economist and became a doctor of economics in 1961, when he graduated from the University of Lausanne.

==Career in politics==

Poos was a long-time member of the Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party. Between 1964 and 1976, he was director and editor in Chief of the daily newspaper &quot;Tageblatt&quot; in Esch-sur-Alzette. In the same period he also became a member of the town council of Esch-sur-Alzette.

In July 1976, he was appointed Minister of Finance. As the foreign minister of Luxembourg he held Presidency of the Council of the European Union for three half-year terms in 1985, 1991 and 1997. He was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Development, first in Jacques Santer&#x27;s (from 1984 to 1995), then in Jean-Claude Junckers&#x27;s cabinets (from 1995 to 1999).

In 1991, he was one of the negotiators of the Brioni Agreement that ended the Ten-Day War in Slovenia. In May of that year, upon disembarking from an airplane en route to beginning negotiations, he declared, &quot;The hour of Europe has dawned.&quot;

===European Parliament===
In 1999, Poos left the government and was elected as a Member of European Parliament, where he sat on the Committee for Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and was the draftsman for Cyprus&#x27; accession into the EU. In 2003, he received an honorary doctor of law degree from Panteion University of Athens, Greece.

==Retirement and death==
In 2004, Poos retired from political life, but remained active as non-executive director in the boards of different national and international institutions and companies. He died on 19 February 2022, at the age of 86.

<doc id="658518" wikidata="Q1756295" url="?curid=658518" title="NSPACE">
<text>In computational complexity theory, non-deterministic space or NSPACE is the computational resource describing the memory space for a non-deterministic Turing machine. It is the non-deterministic counterpart of DSPACE.

==Complexity classes==

The measure NSPACE is used to define the complexity class whose solutions can be determined by a non-deterministic Turing machine. The complexity class NSPACE(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a non-deterministic Turing machine, &quot;M&quot;, using space &quot;O&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)), where &quot;n&quot; is the length of the input.

Several important complexity classes can be defined in terms of &quot;NSPACE&quot;. These include:

* REG = DSPACE(&quot;O&quot;(1)) = NSPACE(&quot;O&quot;(1)), where REG is the class of regular languages (nondeterminism does not add power in constant space).
* NL = NSPACE(&quot;O&quot;(log &quot;n&quot;))
* CSL = NSPACE(&quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)), where CSL is the class of context-sensitive languages.
* PSPACE = NPSPACE = formula_1
* EXPSPACE = NEXPSPACE = formula_2

The Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem states that NSPACE(&quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) is closed under complement for every function 

A further generalization is ASPACE, defined with alternating Turing machines.

==Relation with other complexity classes==

===DSPACE===

NSPACE is the non-deterministic counterpart of DSPACE, the class of memory space on a deterministic Turing machine. First by definition, then by Savitch&#x27;s theorem, we have that:

formula_3
===Time===

NSPACE can also be used to determine the time complexity of a deterministic Turing machine by the following theorem:

If a language &quot;L&quot; is decided in space &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) (where &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) ≥ log &quot;n&quot;) by a non-deterministic TM, then there exists a constant &quot;C&quot; such that &quot;L&quot; is decided in time &quot;O&quot;(&quot;C&quot;&quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) by a deterministic one.
==Limitations==

The measure of space complexity in terms of DSPACE is useful because it represents the total amount of memory that an actual computer would need to solve a given computational problem with a given algorithm. The reason is that DSPACE describes the space complexity used by deterministic Turing machines, which can represent actual computers. On the other hand, NSPACE describes the space complexity of non-deterministic Turing machines, which are not useful when trying to represent actual computers. For this reason, NSPACE is limited in its usefulness to real-world applications.

<text>In computational complexity theory, DSPACE or SPACE is the computational resource describing the resource of memory space for a deterministic Turing machine. It represents the total amount of memory space that a &quot;normal&quot; physical computer would need to solve a given computational problem with a given algorithm. 

==Complexity classes==

The measure DSPACE is used to define complexity classes, sets of all of the decision problems that can be solved using a certain amount of memory space. For each function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), there is a complexity class SPACE(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)), the set of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine using space &quot;O&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)). There is no restriction on the amount of computation time that can be used, though there may be restrictions on some other complexity measures (like alternation).

Several important complexity classes are defined in terms of DSPACE. These include:

* REG = DSPACE(&quot;O&quot;(1)), where REG is the class of regular languages. In fact, REG = DSPACE(&quot;o&quot;(log log &quot;n&quot;)) (that is, space is required to recognize any non-regular language).

&quot;Proof:&quot;
Suppose that there exists a non-regular language &quot;L&quot; ∈ DSPACE(&quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)), for &quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;o&quot;(log log &quot;n&quot;). Let &quot;M&quot; be a Turing machine deciding &quot;L&quot; in space &quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;). By our assumption &quot;L&quot; ∉ DSPACE(&quot;O&quot;(1)); thus, for any arbitrary formula_1, there exists an input of &quot;M&quot; requiring more space than &quot;k&quot;.

Let &quot;x&quot; be an input of smallest size, denoted by n, that requires more space than &quot;k&quot;, and formula_2 be the set of all configurations of &quot;M&quot; on input &quot;x&quot;. Because &quot;M&quot; ∈ DSPACE(&quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)), then formula_3, where &quot;c&quot; is a constant depending on &quot;M&quot;.

Let &quot;S&quot; denote the set of all possible crossing sequences of &quot;M&quot; on &quot;x&quot;. Note that the length of a crossing sequence of &quot;M&quot; on &quot;x&quot; is at most formula_4: if it is longer than that, then some configuration will repeat, and &quot;M&quot; will go into an infinite loop. There are also at most formula_4 possibilities for every element of a crossing sequence, so the number of different crossing sequences of &quot;M&quot; on &quot;x&quot; is

:formula_6

According to pigeonhole principle, there exist indexes &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;j&quot; such that formula_7, where formula_8 and formula_9 are the crossing sequences at boundary &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;, respectively.

Let be the string obtained from by removing all cells from &quot;i&quot; + 1 to &quot;j&quot;. The machine still behaves exactly the same way on input as on input , so it needs the same space to compute as to compute . However, , contradicting the definition of . Hence, there does not exist such a language as assumed. □

The above theorem implies the necessity of the space-constructible function assumption in the space hierarchy theorem.

* L = DSPACE(&quot;O&quot;(log &quot;n&quot;))
* PSPACE = formula_10
* EXPSPACE = formula_11

==Machine models==

DSPACE is traditionally measured on a deterministic Turing machine. Several important space complexity classes are sublinear, that is, smaller than the size of the input. Thus, &quot;charging&quot; the algorithm for the size of the input, or for the size of the output, would not truly capture the memory space used. This is solved by defining the multi-tape Turing machine with input and output, which is a standard multi-tape Turing machine, except that the input tape may never be written-to, and the output tape may never be read from. This allows smaller space classes, such as L (logarithmic space), to be defined in terms of the amount of space used by all of the work tapes (excluding the special input and output tapes).

Since many symbols might be packed into one by taking a suitable power of the alphabet, for all &quot;c&quot; ≥ 1 and &quot;f&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) ≥ &quot;1&quot;, the class of languages recognizable in &quot;c f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) space is the same as the class of languages recognizable in &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) space. This justifies usage of big O notation in the definition.

==Hierarchy theorem==

The space hierarchy theorem shows that, for every space-constructible function formula_12, there exists some language L which is decidable in space formula_13 but not in space formula_14.
==Relation with other complexity classes==
DSPACE is the deterministic counterpart of NSPACE, the class of memory space on a non-deterministic Turing machine. By Savitch&#x27;s theorem, we have that

:formula_15

NTIME is related to DSPACE in the following way. For any time constructible function &quot;t&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), we have

:formula_16.

<text>Jailbird is a novel by American author Kurt Vonnegut, published in 1979 by Delacorte Press. The novel is often described as Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Watergate novel,&quot; as it explores themes related to the Watergate scandal, the American labor movement, and the political landscape of the United States during the mid-20th century.

==Plot summary==
The novel is narrated by Walter F. Starbuck, a minor player in the Watergate Scandal, who has just been released from a minimum-security prison in Georgia. The story unfolds as a memoir, with Starbuck recounting his experiences immediately following his release from prison. The narrative delves into his past, his involvement in the scandal, and his reflections on the American labor movement, corporate America, and the socio-political events of the time.

Throughout &quot;Jailbird&quot;, Vonnegut uses the character of Starbuck to explore themes of guilt, redemption, and the complexities of American history. The novel is notable for its satirical tone and its critique of the American political and economic systems.

==Recurring characters==
&quot;Jailbird&quot; features a cameo by Kilgore Trout, a recurring character in Vonnegut&#x27;s works. In this novel, Trout is portrayed differently than in other books, as he is revealed to be a pseudonym for a character in prison, which deliberately contradicts the autobiographical details of Trout&#x27;s life in other Vonnegut novels. This serves as an example of Vonnegut&#x27;s use of the unreliable narrator device.

==Literary significance and reception==
The &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; referred to &quot;Jailbird&quot; as Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Sermon on the Mount.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described the novel as &quot;[n]ot top-drawer Vonnegut...but...there&#x27;s enough of the author&#x27;s narrative zip to keep fans happy even while the novel fizzles into foolishness.&quot;

In a 2013 article, &quot;Jacobin&quot; magazine called &quot;Jailbird&quot; Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;most extensive exploration of labor&quot; and &quot;Vonnegut&#x27;s clearest articulation of sympathies with the labor movement.&quot; Vonnegut himself gave the novel a grade of &quot;A&quot; when he graded all of his published works in his collection &quot;Palm Sunday&quot;.

<text>In computational complexity theory, DTIME (or TIME) is the computational resource of computation time for a deterministic Turing machine. It represents the amount of time (or number of computation steps) that a &quot;normal&quot; physical computer would take to solve a certain computational problem using a certain algorithm. It is one of the most well-studied complexity resources, because it corresponds so closely to an important real-world resource (the amount of time it takes a computer to solve a problem).

The resource DTIME is used to define complexity classes, sets of all of the decision problems which can be solved using a certain amount of computation time. If a problem of input size &quot;n&quot; can be solved in , we have a complexity class (or ). There is no restriction on the amount of memory space used, but there may be restrictions on some other complexity resources (like alternation).

== Complexity classes in DTIME ==
Many important complexity classes are defined in terms of DTIME, containing all of the problems that can be solved in a certain amount of deterministic time. Any proper complexity function can be used to define a complexity class, but only certain classes are useful to study. In general, we desire our complexity classes to be robust against changes in the computational model, and to be closed under composition of subroutines.

DTIME satisfies the time hierarchy theorem, meaning that asymptotically larger amounts of time always create strictly larger sets of problems.

The well-known complexity class P comprises all of the problems which can be solved in a polynomial amount of DTIME. It can be defined formally as:

:formula_1

P is the smallest robust class which includes linear-time problems formula_2 (AMS 2004, Lecture 2.2, pg. 20). P is one of the largest complexity classes considered &quot;computationally feasible&quot;.

A much larger class using deterministic time is EXPTIME, which contains all of the problems solvable using a deterministic machine in exponential time. Formally, we have
:formula_3

Larger complexity classes can be defined similarly. Because of the time hierarchy theorem, these classes form a strict hierarchy; we know that formula_4, and on up.

==Machine model==

For robust classes, such as P, the exact machine model used to define DTIME can vary without affecting the power of the resource. The Computational Complexity literature often defines DTIME based on multitape Turing machines, particularly when discussing very small time classes. A multitape deterministic Turing machine can never provide more than a quadratic time speedup over a singletape machine.

Due to the Linear speedup theorem for Turing machines, multiplicative constants in the time bound do not affect the extent of DTIME classes; a constant multiplicative speedup can always be obtained by increasing the number of states in the finite state control and the size of the tape alphabet. In the statement of Papadimitriou, for a language ,

:Let formula_5. Then, for any formula_6, formula_7, where formula_8.

==Generalizations==

Using a model other than a deterministic Turing machine, there are various generalizations and restrictions of DTIME. For example, if we use a nondeterministic Turing machine, we have the resource NTIME. The relationship between the expressive powers of DTIME and other computational resources are very poorly understood. One of the few known results is
:formula_9
for multitape machines. This was extended to
:formula_10
by Santhanam.

If we use an alternating Turing machine, we have the resource ATIME.

<text>In computational complexity theory, the complexity class NTIME(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a non-deterministic Turing machine which runs in time &quot;O&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)). Here &quot;O&quot; is the big O notation, &quot;f&quot; is some function, and &quot;n&quot; is the size of the input (for which the problem is to be decided).

==Meaning==
This means that there is a non-deterministic machine which, for a given input of size &quot;n&quot;, will run in time &quot;O&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) (i.e. within a constant multiple of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), for &quot;n&quot; greater than some value), and will always &quot;reject&quot; the input if the answer to the decision problem is &quot;no&quot; for that input, while if the answer is &quot;yes&quot; the machine will &quot;accept&quot; that input for at least one computation path. Equivalently, there is a deterministic Turing machine &quot;M&quot; that runs in time &quot;O&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) and is able to check an &quot;O&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;))-length certificate for an input; if the input is a &quot;yes&quot; instance, then at least one certificate is accepted, if the input is a &quot;no&quot; instance, no certificate can make the machine accept.

==Space constraints==
The space available to the machine is not limited, although it cannot exceed &quot;O&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)), because the time available limits how much of the tape is reachable.

==Relation to other complexity classes==
The well-known complexity class NP can be defined in terms of NTIME as follows:

:formula_1

Similarly, the class NEXP is defined in terms of NTIME: 

:formula_2

The non-deterministic time hierarchy theorem says that nondeterministic machines can solve more problems in asymptotically more time.

NTIME is also related to DSPACE in the following way. For any time constructible function &quot;t&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), we have

:formula_3.

A generalization of NTIME is ATIME, defined with alternating Turing machines. It turns out that

:formula_4.

<text>Mark William Lanegan (November 25, 1964 – February 22, 2022) was an American singer and songwriter. First becoming prominent as the lead singer for the early grunge band Screaming Trees, he was also known as a member of Queens of the Stone Age and The Gutter Twins. He released twelve solo studio albums as well as three collaboration albums with Isobel Campbell and two with Duke Garwood. He was known for his baritone voice, which was described as being &quot;as scratchy as a three-day beard yet as supple and pliable as moccasin leather&quot; and has been compared to Tom Waits, Leonard Cohen and Nick Cave.

Lanegan began his musical career in 1984 in Screaming Trees, with whom he released seven studio albums and five EPs before their disbandment in 2000. During his time with the band, he also began a solo career and released his first solo studio album, &quot;The Winding Sheet&quot;, in 1990. He then released 10 more solo albums, which received critical recognition but only moderate commercial success. Following the end of Screaming Trees, he became a frequent collaborator of Queens of the Stone Age and was a full-time member between 2001 and 2005 during the &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; and &quot;Lullabies to Paralyze&quot; eras.

Lanegan collaborated with various artists during his career. In the 1990s, he and Kurt Cobain recorded an album of Lead Belly covers that was ultimately never released. He also joined Layne Staley and Mike McCready in the band Mad Season, and formed the alternative rock group The Gutter Twins with Greg Dulli in 2003, as well as contributing to releases by Moby, Bomb the Bass, Soulsavers, Tinariwen, The Twilight Singers, Manic Street Preachers, and Unkle, among others.

Lanegan struggled with addiction to drugs and alcohol throughout his life but had been sober for over a decade at the time of his death. Encouraged by his friend Anthony Bourdain, he released the memoir &quot;Sing Backwards and Weep&quot; in 2020. He followed this up in 2021 with the memoir &quot;Devil in a Coma&quot;, which focused on his near-death experience with COVID-19. He and his wife Shelley Brien left the U.S. in 2020 and settled in the Irish town of Killarney, where he died two years later at the age of 57. No cause of death was revealed.

==Early life==
Mark William Lanegan was born in Ellensburg, Washington on November 25, 1964. During an interview with &quot;The Rocket&quot; in 1996, he said that he drove a combine harvester when he was younger. He was of Irish, Scottish and Welsh descent. He said that he developed an alcohol use disorder by age 12 and began using drugs heavily by the age of 18, having already been arrested and sentenced to one year&#x27;s imprisonment for drug-related crimes.

==Musical career==
===Screaming Trees (1984–2000)===

Screaming Trees was formed in late 1984 by Lanegan, guitarist Gary Lee Conner, bassist Van Conner, and drummer Mark Pickerel. Along with Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Mudhoney, The Melvins, and Nirvana, Screaming Trees were part of Seattle&#x27;s emerging grunge scene in the early 1990s. Pickerel would later be replaced with Barrett Martin. Lanegan originally joined as the drummer but later said, &quot;I was such a shitty drummer that they made me sing.&quot; The band released the &quot;Other Worlds&quot; EP in 1986; recorded in 1985 and originally available only on cassette tape, the album was re-released on CD and LP by SST Records in 1987. Although the band was being courted by major labels, they signed to Velvetone Records in 1985 and released their debut album, &quot;Clairvoyance&quot;, in 1986. The album was a combination of psychedelic music and hard rock, and bears many similarities to early grunge.

In 1987, the band released their second effort, and their first for SST Records, &quot;Even If and Especially When&quot;. After the release of the album in 1987 the band began working on the American indie circuit, playing shows across the United States. Their follow up album &quot;Invisible Lantern&quot; was released in 1988. 1989&#x27;s &quot;Buzz Factory&quot; was the fourth full-length album by Screaming Trees and their final record released through SST.

In 1991, the band released their fifth effort, and their first for a major label. &quot;Uncle Anesthesia&quot; was released in 1991 and was produced by Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell. &quot;Uncle Anesthesia&quot; included the single &quot;Bed of Roses&quot;, which gained considerable airtime on alternative rock radio stations. The song peaked at number 23 on the Modern Rock Tracks and was the first Screaming Trees release to chart. Barrett Martin replaced previous drummer Pickerel and the new line up recorded &quot;Sweet Oblivion&quot; in 1992.

&quot;Sweet Oblivion&quot; was the band&#x27;s breakout album and included the singles &quot;Nearly Lost You&quot;, &quot;Dollar Bill&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the Season&quot;, and &quot;Butterfly&quot;. The first two singles gained considerable airtime on alternative rock radio stations, while the video for &quot;Nearly Lost You&quot; became an MTV and alternative radio hit in the fall of 1992, thanks to the momentum of of the film &quot;Singles&quot;, which features the song. &quot;Nearly Lost You&quot; peaked at number 5 on the Modern Rock Tracks and number 50 in the United Kingdom and was the band&#x27;s first single to chart outside the United States. &quot;Sweet Oblivion&quot; sold a total of 300,000 copies in the United States.

After a hiatus brought about by in-fighting and uncertainty over the quality of the music they were recording, the band&#x27;s final album, &quot;Dust&quot;, was released in 1996. The album spawned several singles, including &quot;All I Know&quot; and &quot;Dying Days&quot;, and peaked at number 134 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Reaching number 39 on the Canadian album chart, it was the only Screaming Trees album to chart outside the United States. Despite consistently favorable reviews, the album did not match the commercial success of &quot;Sweet Oblivion&quot;. Following the &quot;Dust&quot; tour in the United States, Screaming Trees took another hiatus for Lanegan to begin his work on his third solo album, &quot;Scraps at Midnight&quot;. The band headed back into the studio in 1999 and recorded several demos and shopped them around to labels, but no label was willing to take them on. The band played a few surprise shows in early 2000, and then following a concert to celebrate the opening of Seattle&#x27;s Experience Music Project they unexpectedly announced their official breakup.

When asked in 2021 about the &#x27;90s grunge movement, Lanegan commented, &quot;It&#x27;s not something that was contrived or cooked up around the campfire somewhere. It just happened organically. It&#x27;s hard for me to comment, because there&#x27;s always great new music and there probably always will be — as long as the sun keeps shining.&quot;

===Solo work and other projects===
In 1990, Lanegan released his first solo album, &quot;The Winding Sheet&quot; via label Sub Pop. Lanegan had intimated that the album came around following a Leadbelly project he was working on with Mark Pickerel, Kurt Cobain, and Krist Novoselic. The project was short lived and eventually other musicians became involved in the evolution to the debut solo record. From the Leadbelly sessions a version of &quot;Where Did You Sleep Last Night?&quot; appeared on &quot;The Winding Sheet&quot;. &quot;Ain&#x27;t It a Shame&quot; is available on the Nirvana box set, &quot;With the Lights Out&quot;. Cobain also supplied backing vocals on &quot;Down in the Dark&quot; on Lanegan&#x27;s debut. The majority of the album was recorded with Pickerel on drums, Mike Johnson on guitar, Steve Fisk on piano and organ, and Jack Endino on bass.

His second solo record, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Whiskey for the Holy Ghost&quot;, was a more cohesive recording, with songs &quot;The River Rise&quot;, &quot;Kingdoms of Rain&quot;, &quot;Riding the Nightingale&quot;, and &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Blues&quot;. Taking nearly three years to make, the album came close to not seeing the light of day as Lanegan was set to throw the master tapes in a pond outside of the recording studio, only to be stopped by producer Jack Endino at the last moment.

In 1995, Lanegan appeared on the album &quot;Above&quot; by Mad Season. The project was fronted by friend Layne Staley (Alice in Chains) and was formed in late 1994 by Staley, Mike McCready of Pearl Jam, Barrett Martin of Screaming Trees, and John Baker Saunders of The Walkabouts. Lanegan appeared on &quot;Long Gone Day&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Above&quot;. Lanegan also appeared on stage at Mad Season&#x27;s concerts to perform the songs. After Staley&#x27;s departure from the band, Mad Season began work on a potential second album featuring Lanegan as the primary vocalist. Three of these previously unreleased songs featuring Lanegan were eventually made available on the 2013 deluxe re-release of &quot;Above&quot;.

In 1998, &quot;Scraps at Midnight&quot; was released. The album was recorded the previous winter at Rancho de la Luna in Joshua Tree, California, and produced by long-time friend and collaborator Mike Johnson. and featured Rancho de la Luna owners Fred Drake and Dave Catching

Lanegan&#x27;s fourth studio album was released in 1999. The album began life as B-Sides for singles from &quot;Scraps at Midnight&quot; (two tracks from the sessions appear on the single &quot;Hotel&quot;). Liking the way the sessions were shaping up, a few more were added and the recording was entitled &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Care of You&quot;. The album features covers of songs by prominent folk, R&amp;B and punk artists such as Tim Hardin, Booker T. and the MGs, and country icon Buck Owens, as well as friend Jeffrey Lee Pierce of Gun Club. Lanegan stated that Jeffrey Lee Pierce was one of his early musical heroes and got him interested in making music. Also in 1999, Lanegan participated in the tribute album for Moby Grape co-founder, Skip Spence, who was terminally ill. In 2009 Lanegan sang lead vocals on &quot;The Last Time,&quot; an A side track on The Breeders&#x27; EP &quot;Fate to Fatal&quot;.

In 2001, he released his fifth studio album, &quot;Field Songs&quot;. The album featured friend Duff McKagan, as well as major contributions from Soundgarden&#x27;s bassist, Ben Shepherd. 2003 saw him appear on Greg Dulli&#x27;s The Twilight Singers record &quot;Blackberry Belle&quot;, sharing lead vocal duties on the epic closing track, &quot;Number Nine&quot;. This would be the first of many collaborations with Dulli and The Twilight Singers.

Prior to releasing his fourth album, Mark Lanegan released the EP &quot;Here Comes That Weird Chill&quot;, which included &quot;Methamphetamine Blues&quot; (later to appear on &quot;Bubblegum&quot;) as well as a number of B-sides and rarities (including Captain Beefheart cover &quot;Clear Spot&quot;) featuring collaborations with many who would feature on &quot;Bubblegum&quot;, such as Josh Homme, Dean Ween, Nick Oliveri and Chris Goss, as well as (notably) Natasha Shneider, Greg Dulli and Aldo Struyf.

On his next solo album, &quot;Bubblegum&quot; (2004), Lanegan was joined by a cadre of prominent artists, including P. J. Harvey, Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri of Queens of the Stone Age, Greg Dulli of The Afghan Whigs and Twilight Singers, Dave Catching of Rancho de la Luna , Dean Ween of Ween, and Duff McKagan and Izzy Stradlin, previously of Guns N&#x27; Roses. Also appearing on &quot;Bubblegum&quot; is Lanegan&#x27;s ex-wife, Wendy Rae Fowler now in We Fell to Earth. The favorably reviewed album was his most commercially successful to date, reaching number 39 on Billboard&#x27;s Top Independent Albums chart. Some would assume this is due to the appearance of several prominent musical figures, although the album did receive glowing review by critics. In 2013, the track &quot;Strange Religion&quot; was used in season 6 of the Showtime television series &quot;Californication&quot;.

Lanegan&#x27;s seventh solo album, &quot;Blues Funeral&quot;, was released in February 2012. Josh Homme, Dave Catching, Alain Johannes, and Martyn LeNoble contributed to the creation of the album. In November 2012 Lanegan self-released a Christmas album titled &quot;Dark Mark Does Christmas 2012&quot;, including a Roky Erickson cover &quot;Burn the Flames&quot;. The limited six-track EP had only been available at his concerts.

Released on Heavenly Recordings in 2013, Lanegan released his first collaboration with Duke Garwood entitled &quot;Black Pudding&quot;. It featured a largely acoustic guitar-driven sound, not unlike his first solo albums on Sub Pop, as well as long-time solo collaborator Alain Johannes.

Lanegan released a five-track EP entitled &quot;No Bells on Sunday&quot; in the United States on July 29, 2014, followed by a European release on August 25. A music video was released on July 15 for &quot;Sad Lover&quot;, the third track off the EP. Lanegan&#x27;s next full-length album, &quot;Phantom Radio&quot;, was released on October 21, 2014. It was produced by Alain Johannes and has a similar sound aesthetic to &quot;Blues Funeral&quot;.

Lanegan&#x27;s second collaborative album with Duke Garwood, &quot;With Animals&quot;, was released on August 24, 2018. The pair toured Europe in October 2018 to support the release.

Lanegan released three further solo albums between 2017 and 2020 on Heavenly Recordings; &quot;Gargoyle&quot; in 2017, &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Knocking&quot; in April 2019, and &quot;Straight Songs of Sorrow&quot; in May 2020.

===Queens of the Stone Age (2000–2014)===

Lanegan&#x27;s first appearance on a Queens of the Stone Age album was on &quot;Rated R&quot;. He sang the lead vocals on &quot;In the Fade&quot; and background vocals on &quot;Leg of Lamb&quot;, &quot;Autopilot&quot;, and &quot;I Think I Lost My Headache&quot;. &quot;Rated R&quot; became a commercial success and became the first Queens of the Stone Age album to chart.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Field Songs&quot;, Lanegan became a full-time member of Queens of the Stone Age. He appeared on the 2002 release &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;, singing lead on the tracks &quot;Song for the Dead&quot;, &quot;Hangin&#x27; Tree&quot;, &quot;Song for the Deaf&quot;, and &quot;God Is in the Radio&quot;. The album became the band&#x27;s big breakthrough and peaked at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA. He also toured in support of the album over the next two years. Lanegan toured full-time as a third vocalist for Queens of the Stone Age in support of &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;, joining his friend Joshua Homme, who supported the Screaming Trees as their touring guitarist in 1996. The album received two Best Hard Rock Performance Grammy nominations for the singles &quot;No One Knows&quot; (2003) and &quot;Go with the Flow&quot; (2004).

In 2005, Lanegan released his last album with Queens of the Stone Age, &quot;Lullabies to Paralyze&quot;, where he sang lead vocals on the first track of the album called &quot;This Lullaby&quot;. The album was delayed during 2004 because of some changes to the line-up: bassist Nick Oliveri was fired and Lanegan went on tour to support &quot;Bubblegum&quot;. Lanegan would later appear in support of the album.

Lanegan continued to collaborate with Queens of the Stone Age and its members after leaving the band. In 2007, he appeared on their album, &quot;Era Vulgaris&quot;, contributing background vocals to the track &quot;River in the Road&quot;. On August 12, 2010, Lanegan re-joined Queens of The Stone Age on stage at the Nokia Club in Los Angeles, where he sang four encore songs with the band. The concert was put together to raise funds for Eagles of Death Metal bassist Brian O&#x27;Connor, who was diagnosed with cancer a few months prior to the event. In 2013, Lanegan appeared on their sixth album, &quot;...Like Clockwork&quot;, co-writing the song &quot;Fairweather Friends&quot; and contributing background vocals to the track &quot;If I Had a Tail&quot;.

===Collaboration with Isobel Campbell (2004–2011)===

In April 2004, Lanegan released an EP with former Belle &amp; Sebastian vocalist Isobel Campbell, titled &quot;Time Is Just the Same&quot;. They would later release a single entitled &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Man&quot; for their collaboration album &quot;Ballad of the Broken Seas&quot;. Campbell wrote and recorded the majority of the album&#x27;s tracks in Glasgow, with Lanegan adding vocals in Los Angeles. The record was well received by critics.

In addition to providing vocals, Lanegan also wrote the track &quot;Revolver&quot; with Campbell. The album was nominated for the 2006 Mercury Prize. Lanegan and Campbell played four UK concerts in January 2007, with the London date being moved to a larger venue as a result of high demand for tickets. When making the decision to make a follow-up to &quot;Ballad of the Broken Seas&quot;, Campbell reflected:

After a concert with Lanegan in January 2007, Campbell asked Lanegan if he would consider making a new album, Lanegan replied: &quot;in a heartbeat&quot;. This time Lanegan flew to Glasgow to record the new album at the end of March for nine days to record the songs Campbell had written. After working with Lanegan, Campbell remarked: &quot;It is his classic, effortless American voice that I love&quot;. She added &quot;I think I was playing about with that a lot so there&#x27;s a few of what Mark would call raunchy songs and a few ballads too&quot;. The album, &quot;Sunday at Devil Dirt&quot;, was released on May 5, 2008, with the track &quot;Who Built the Road&quot; being the only single released from it.

A third collaborative album with Campbell was released on August 16, 2010, entitled &quot;Hawk&quot;. The pair toured to promote the album, including a set at All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties, December 10–12, 2010 (Bowlie 2) curated by Belle &amp; Sebastian and shows in Australia in 2011. By the end of the tour the duo had ceased to function and each went their separate ways.

===The Gutter Twins (2003–2009)===

The Gutter Twins was a collaboration between Lanegan and Afghan Whigs/Twilight Singers vocalist Greg Dulli. Working on a collaborative album since at least 2003, the pair first played as The Gutter Twins in Rome in September 2005.

&quot;Saturnalia&quot; was released on March 4, 2008, on Sub Pop, a label both Dulli and Lanegan had worked with before. The duo&#x27;s first tour commenced on February 14, 2008, in New York City and continued in March and April throughout Europe and the United States.

The album was a big hit and Blast Magazine&#x27;s Liz Raftery ended up praising the album calling it &quot;an audial descent into the dark emotions that often lurk beneath the surface.&quot; The album&#x27;s highest position was at number 7 in Belgium. The album also peaked at number 117 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It meant that &quot;Saturnalia&quot; was the first album since Screaming Trees&#x27; &quot;Dust&quot; that had charted on the Billboard 200 with Lanegan as a permanent band member. On September 2, 2008, The Gutter Twins released an EP called &quot;Adorata&quot; exclusively on iTunes. Adorata contains eight tracks, most of them are covers, but also two Gutter Twins songs that never made it to the album.

===Collaborations (2006–2022)===

Lanegan appeared on three releases with The Twilight Singers (&quot;Blackberry Belle, She Loves You&quot;, and &quot;A Stitch in Time&quot;). In 2006, Lanegan toured with the band in Europe and Israel on an excursus which later expanded to include the United States. In 2008, Lanegan collaborated with Tim Simenon on a track entitled &quot;Black River&quot; which appeared on Simenon&#x27;s fourth album under his Bomb the Bass moniker, &quot;Future Chaos&quot;.

In 2007, English electronica duo Soulsavers&#x27; album &quot;It&#x27;s Not How Far You Fall, It&#x27;s the Way You Land&quot; featured Lanegan on 8 out of 10 album tracks. As well as appearing as a vocalist, the tracks &quot;Revival&quot;, &quot;Ghosts of You and Me&quot;, &quot;Paper Money&quot;, and &quot;Jesus of Nothing&quot; are credited as written by Lanegan and Soulsavers. The album also features a re-working of &quot;Kingdoms of Rain&quot;, which was initially released on Lanegan&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Whiskey for the Holy Ghost&quot;. &quot;Revival&quot; and &quot;Kingdoms of Rain&quot; were released as singles from the album. Soulsavers recorded the tracks in England in 2005 and 2006, with Lanegan recording the vocal parts at Conway Studios in Los Angeles.

In 2009, Soulsavers again enlisted Lanegan with him contributing vocals for several tracks on their third studio album &quot;Broken&quot;. This led to a significant run of touring in support of the album, beginning on September 6, in Portland, Oregon. Following the tour of the United States, Lanegan continued to perform with them throughout their extensive run of European shows. These varied between headline gigs and slots in support of Depeche Mode. Having completed touring duties for Soulsavers, Lanegan announced a solo European tour. Shows focused specifically on his solo back catalogue, having not done so since touring finished in support of &quot;Bubblegum&quot;.

Also in 2009, Lanegan followed in Josh Homme&#x27;s footsteps in collaborating with Unkle, the British electronic act masterminded by James Lavelle. He contributed his vocals to &quot;Another Night Out&quot;, the final track of the album &quot;Where Did the Night Fall&quot; (released in May 2010).

In 2011, Lanegan&#x27;s music was featured in a trailer and end credits for the video game Rage and the soundtrack for the film &quot;The Hangover Part II&quot;. Lanegan collaborated on a track &quot;So Long Sin City&quot; with Slash who recorded music for the 2011 indie film &quot;This Is Not a Movie&quot;, directed by Olallo Rubio, and starring Edward Furlong, Peter Coyote, Miguel Ferrer, and more.

On April 16, 2013, Lanegan and Duke Garwood released their first studio collaboration, &quot;Black Pudding&quot;. Lanegan collaborated with Warpaint and Massive Attack for a cover of the xx&#x27;s song &quot;Crystalised&quot;. Lanegan, Warpaint, and Martina Topley-Bird recorded the cover of &quot;Crystalised&quot; and released it as a single in 2013.

For Record Store Day 2013, Lanegan collaborated with Moby to release a 7-inch record called &quot;The Lonely Night&quot;. Of working with Lanegan, Moby stated: &quot;I&#x27;ve been a fan of Mark&#x27;s from his early SST records days, and I&#x27;ve always wanted to work with him. He has one of the best and most distinctive voices of the last 25 years. Now that we live near each other it ended up being really easy working on a song together.&quot; &quot;The Lonely Night&quot; also appeared on Moby&#x27;s album &quot;Innocents&quot;.

In 2013, Lanegan teamed up with Seattle producer Martin Feveyear, to work on a covers record, &quot;Imitations&quot;. Prior to its release, Lanegan had only issued one previous record of covers, 1999&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Care of You&quot;. On &quot;Imitations&quot;, Lanegan offers contemporary songs, standards, and obscure numbers that, according to him, reveal the effect his parents&#x27; record collection had on him. He enlisted the help of Seattle composer Andrew Joslyn for the string arrangements and performances, as well as Seattle rock icons Duff McKagan, Barrett Martin, and others. The record was released September 17, 2013, through Vagrant Records.

Lanegan and Josh Homme co-wrote the theme song for &quot;Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown&quot;, which first aired in 2013 on CNN. Lanegan contributed vocals on two tracks on Earth&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Primitive and Deadly&quot;, released on September 2, 2014, and on one track on Manset&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Un oiseau s&#x27;est posé&quot;. He also worked with Unkle on the track &quot;Looking for the Rain&quot; from their 2017 album &quot;The Road: Part I&quot;, along with Eska. He also contributed vocals and songwriting to Tuareg rock band Tinariwen&#x27;s &quot;Nànnuflày&quot; off their 2017 album &quot;Elwan&quot;.

In 2020, Lanegan contributed a spoken-word vocal performance to the song &quot;The Mirror&quot; by English rock band Hey Colossus, from their album &quot;Dances/Curses&quot;.

He also wrote lyrics and recorded lead vocals for &quot;A Drink Of Poison Water&quot; on Spanish duo Agrio&#x27;s La Murga Ep.

Lanegan contributed vocals on the song &quot;Inside of a Dream&quot; on Cult of Luna&#x27;s EP &quot;The Raging River&quot;, released on February 5, 2021, &quot;The Music Becomes a Skull&quot; on The Armed&#x27;s album &quot;Ultrapop&quot;, released April 16, 2021, and &quot;Blank Diary Entry&quot; on Manic Street Preachers&#x27; 2021 album &quot;The Ultra Vivid Lament&quot;. In October 2021, Lanegan released a collaborative album with former The Icarus Line member Joe Cardamone entitled &quot;Dark Mark vs. Skeleton Joe&quot;.

==Books==
In 2017, Lanegan released the book &quot;I Am the Wolf: Lyrics &amp; Writings&quot;, a collection of lyrics accompanied by explanations and anecdotes. His memoir, &quot;Sing Backwards and Weep&quot;, was published on April 28, 2020. Lanegan and Cold Cave frontman Wesley Eisold published a book of poetry &quot;Plague Poems&quot; in 2020. Another memoir &quot;Devil in a Coma&quot; was released in 2021, which details Lanegan&#x27;s experiences contracting COVID-19, and being admitted to Kerry Hospital in March 2021. &quot;Leaving California&quot;, a final book of 76 new poems, was released in 2021.

Additionally, books have been written about Lanegan by other authors, including 2022&#x27;s &quot;Confessions, Lyrics &amp; Nostalgia Dark Mark Lanegan&quot; by Iman Kakai-Lazell (which features photos, lyrics, and text) and 2023&#x27;s &quot;Lanegan&quot; by Greg Prato (which includes new interviews with over 20 of Lanegan&#x27;s collaborators, friends, and admirers).

== Personal life ==
Lanegan struggled with alcoholism and heroin addiction during the 1990s and early 2000s. In his 2020 memoir, he claimed that he was &quot;reviled as the town drunk before [he] could even legally drink&quot; at the age of 12. During a Screaming Trees tour in 1992, his arm became so badly infected from using heroin needles that doctors considered amputating it. After leaving Screaming Trees, he became homeless for a period, then entered rehab in 1997. He credited Courtney Love, who recommended and paid for a year of his rehab and months of rental payments, with saving his life. After his first stint in rehab, he entered a halfway house and was given a job looking after Duff McKagan&#x27;s house. He relapsed in 2004 and briefly went into a coma. After this relapse, he supported himself financially by painting sets for television shows. He entered rehab again in 2006.

Lanegan was a friend of Kurt Cobain and had been invited to his home a few hours before Cobain&#x27;s death. He was also a friend of Anthony Bourdain, who encouraged Lanegan to pursue writing a memoir. He wrote an obituary for Bourdain in &quot;The Observer&quot; after Bourdain&#x27;s suicide in 2018. He was close friends with Layne Staley and had a highly publicized feud with Liam Gallagher. He supported the Seattle SuperSonics basketball team while growing up and switched allegiances to the Los Angeles Clippers upon moving to Los Angeles, though he remained a fan of the Seattle Mariners baseball team.

Lanegan was married twice. He met musician Wendy Rae Fowler in 1998 and married her in 2002, with the couple relocating from Los Angeles to North Carolina. The day after their wedding, Lanegan departed for a tour with Queens of the Stone Age and the couple divorced soon afterwards. His second wife was Shelley Brien, with whom he remained until his death. The two left the U.S. and moved to the Irish town of Killarney in 2020.

In March 2021, Lanegan was hospitalized with a severe infection of COVID-19 and almost died. The virus led to him temporarily going deaf, losing the ability to walk, and slipping in and out of a coma for several months.
Nine months later, he said he had concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic was a &quot;natural event&quot; and admitted, &quot;I was one of those knuckleheads who was wary of the vaccine. But I learned my lesson. I&#x27;ll be the first one to get a booster shot when it&#x27;s available in Ireland.&quot;

==Death==
Lanegan died at his home in Killarney on the morning of February 22, 2022, at the age of 57. No cause of death was revealed. Artists including Eddie Vedder, Iggy Pop, Moby, Scott Lucas, Simon Bonney, John Cale, Sleaford Mods, Badly Drawn Boy, Anton Newcombe, Peter Hook, Slash, Nick Cave, Nick Oliveri, and the members of Manic Street Preachers paid tribute. Locals of Killarney, described as a &quot;tightly knit community&quot;, also expressed a sense of loss.

An obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot; by Stevie Chick remembered him as &quot;one of his generation&#x27;s most soulful singers&quot;. In &quot;Variety&quot;, music writer Chris Morris described him as &quot;impassioned&quot; and &quot;adventurous&quot;.

Lanegan was laid to rest at Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

<text>In computational complexity theory, P, also known as PTIME or [[DTIME]](&quot;n&quot;O(1)), is a fundamental complexity class. It contains all decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine using a polynomial amount of computation time, or polynomial time.

Cobham&#x27;s thesis holds that P is the class of computational problems that are &quot;efficiently solvable&quot; or &quot;tractable&quot;. This is inexact: in practice, some problems not known to be in P have practical solutions, and some that are in P do not, but this is a useful rule of thumb.

==Definition==
A language &quot;L&quot; is in P if and only if there exists a deterministic Turing machine &quot;M&quot;, such that

* &quot;M&quot; runs for polynomial time on all inputs
* For all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;L&quot;, &quot;M&quot; outputs 1
* For all &quot;x&quot; not in &quot;L&quot;, &quot;M&quot; outputs 0

P can also be viewed as a uniform family of Boolean circuits. A language &quot;L&quot; is in P if and only if there exists a polynomial-time uniform family of Boolean circuits formula_1, such that

* For all formula_2, formula_3 takes &quot;n&quot; bits as input and outputs 1 bit
* For all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;L&quot;, formula_4
* For all &quot;x&quot; not in &quot;L&quot;, formula_5

The circuit definition can be weakened to use only a logspace uniform family without changing the complexity class.

==Notable problems in P==
P is known to contain many natural problems, including the decision versions of linear programming, and finding a maximum matching. In 2002, it was shown that the problem of determining if a number is prime is in P. The related class of function problems is FP.

Several natural problems are complete for P, including &quot;st&quot;-connectivity (or reachability) on alternating graphs. The article on P-complete problems lists further relevant problems in P.

==Relationships to other classes==
A generalization of P is NP, which is the class of decision problems decidable by a non-deterministic Turing machine that runs in polynomial time. Equivalently, it is the class of decision problems where each &quot;yes&quot; instance has a polynomial size certificate, and certificates can be checked by a polynomial time deterministic Turing machine. The class of problems for which this is true for the &quot;no&quot; instances is called co-NP. P is trivially a subset of NP and of co-NP; most experts believe it is a proper subset, although this belief (the formula_6 hypothesis) remains unproven. Another open problem is whether NP = co-NP; since P = co-P, a negative answer would imply formula_6.

P is also known to be at least as large as L, the class of problems decidable in a logarithmic amount of memory space. A decider using formula_8 space cannot use more than formula_9 time, because this is the total number of possible configurations; thus, L is a subset of P. Another important problem is whether L = P. We do know that P = AL, the set of problems solvable in logarithmic memory by alternating Turing machines. P is also known to be no larger than PSPACE, the class of problems decidable in polynomial space. Again, whether P = PSPACE is an open problem. To summarize:

:formula_10

Here, EXPTIME is the class of problems solvable in exponential time. Of all the classes shown above, only two strict containments are known:

* P is strictly contained in EXPTIME. Consequently, all EXPTIME-hard problems lie outside P, and at least one of the containments to the right of P above is strict (in fact, it is widely believed that all three are strict).
* L is strictly contained in PSPACE.

The most difficult problems in P are P-complete problems.

Another generalization of P is P/poly, or Nonuniform Polynomial-Time. If a problem is in P/poly, then it can be solved in deterministic polynomial time provided that an advice string is given that depends only on the length of the input. Unlike for NP, however, the polynomial-time machine doesn&#x27;t need to detect fraudulent advice strings; it is not a verifier. P/poly is a large class containing nearly all practical problems, including all of BPP. If it contains NP, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the second level. On the other hand, it also contains some impractical problems, including some undecidable problems such as the unary version of any undecidable problem.

In 1999, Jin-Yi Cai and D. Sivakumar, building on work by Mitsunori Ogihara, showed that if there exists a sparse language that is P-complete, then L = P.

P is contained in BQP; it is unknown whether this containment is strict.

==Properties==
Polynomial-time algorithms are closed under composition. Intuitively, this says that if one writes a function that is polynomial-time assuming that function calls are constant-time, and if those called functions themselves require polynomial time, then the entire algorithm takes polynomial time. One consequence of this is that P is low for itself. This is also one of the main reasons that P is considered to be a machine-independent class; any machine &quot;feature&quot;, such as random access, that can be simulated in polynomial time can simply be composed with the main polynomial-time algorithm to reduce it to a polynomial-time algorithm on a more basic machine.

Languages in P are also closed under reversal, intersection, union, concatenation, Kleene closure, inverse homomorphism, and complementation.

==Pure existence proofs of polynomial-time algorithms==
Some problems are known to be solvable in polynomial time, but no concrete algorithm is known for solving them. For example, the Robertson–Seymour theorem guarantees that there is a finite list of forbidden minors that characterizes (for example) the set of graphs that can be embedded on a torus; moreover, Robertson and Seymour showed that there is an O(&quot;n&quot;3) algorithm for determining whether a graph has a given graph as a minor. This yields a nonconstructive proof that there is a polynomial-time algorithm for determining if a given graph can be embedded on a torus, despite the fact that no concrete algorithm is known for this problem.

==Alternative characterizations==
In descriptive complexity, P can be described as the problems expressible in FO(LFP), the first-order logic with a least fixed point operator added to it, on ordered structures. In Immerman&#x27;s 1999 textbook on descriptive complexity, Immerman ascribes this result to Vardi and to Immerman.

It was published in 2001 that PTIME corresponds to (positive) range concatenation grammars.

P can also be defined as an algorithmic complexity class for problems that are not decision problems (even though, for example, finding the solution to a 2-satisfiability instance in polynomial time automatically gives a polynomial algorithm for the corresponding decision problem). In that case P is not a subset of NP, but P∩DEC is, where DEC is the class of decision problems.

Kozen states that Cobham and Edmonds are &quot;generally credited with the invention of the notion of polynomial time,&quot; though Rabin also invented the notion independently and around the same time (Rabin&#x27;s paper was in a 1967 proceedings of a 1966 conference, while Cobham&#x27;s was in a 1965 proceedings of a 1964 conference and Edmonds&#x27;s was published in a journal in 1965, though Rabin makes no mention of either and was apparently unaware of them). Cobham invented the class as a robust way of characterizing efficient algorithms, leading to Cobham&#x27;s thesis. However, H. C. Pocklington, in a 1910 paper, analyzed two algorithms for solving quadratic congruences, and observed that one took time &quot;proportional to a power of the logarithm of the modulus&quot; and contrasted this with one that took time proportional &quot;to the modulus itself or its square root&quot;, thus explicitly drawing a distinction between an algorithm that ran in polynomial time versus one that ran in (moderately) exponential time.

<text>Jānis Pliekšāns (11 September 1865 – 11 September 1929), known by his pseudonym Rainis, was a Latvian poet, playwright, translator, and politician. Rainis&#x27; works include the classic plays &quot;Uguns un nakts&quot; (&quot;Fire and Night&quot;, 1905) and &quot;Indulis un Ārija&quot; (&quot;Indulis and Ārija&quot;, 1911), and a highly regarded translation of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;. His works had a profound influence on the literary Latvian language, and the ethnic symbolism he employed in his major works has been central to Latvian nationalism.

== Early life ==
Rainis was born on &quot;Varslavāni&quot; farm, Dunava parish in Jēkabpils municipality. His father, Krišjānis Pliekšāns (ca. 1828–1891), was a tenant farmer. His mother was Dārta, née Grikovska (ca. 1828–1899), and he had two sisters, Līze (1854–1897) and Dora (1870–1950). During his education at the Riga City Gymnasium he met and befriended Pēteris Stučka, Dora Pliekšāne&#x27;s future husband, who later become a prominent Latvian communist.

== Early career ==
Rainis studied law at the University of St. Petersburg, where he shared a room with Pēteris Stučka. While still a student, Rainis was already collecting folk songs, writing satirical and lyric poetry, and translating literature. Together with Stučka he edited a collection of epigrams and satire, &quot;Mazie dunduri&quot; (The Small Gadflies) and published &quot;Apdziedāšanas dziesmas&quot; (Mocking Songs) about the third All-Latvian Song Festival. The two men, however, would later split because of the differences between socialist and communist ideologies.

After completing his studies, he worked at the Vilnius regional courtrooms and with Andrejs Stērsts in Jelgava. Rainis wrote for &quot;Dienas Lapa&quot; (The Daily Page), &quot;Tēvija&quot; (Fatherland) and the &quot;Latvian Conversational Dictionary&quot;.

From 1891 to 1895 Rainis was editor in chief of &quot;Dienas Lapa&quot; (Daily Page). The &quot;Dienas Lapa&quot; scene was mostly a group of young Latvian liberal and socialist intellectuals who came to be known as the &quot;New Current&quot;. After attending the congress of the Second International in 1893, Rainis began to emphasize socialist ideology and news of socialist events in &quot;Dienas Lapa.&quot; He is recognized as the father of Latvian socialism. It was during this period that he met Aspazija (pseudonym of Elza Pliekšāne, born Rozenberga), another Latvian poet and playwright active in the New Current. According to &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;, it was while editing the paper that Rainis developed &quot;his own philosophy [which] showed no trace of Marxist materialism—he regarded life as an incessant series of mutations of energy.&quot;

Because of their social criticism and calls for various reforms, the New Current was viewed as a seditious movement and was the subject of a Tsarist crackdown. In 1897 Rainis was arrested and deported first to Pskov, and later to Vyatka guberniya (now Kirov Oblast). It was during this period of internal exile that Rainis translated &quot;Faust&quot; and other works from classical literature. Here he also produced his first collection of poems, &quot;Tālas noskaņas zilā vakarā&quot; (Far-Off Moods on a Blue Evening, 1903). In addition to &quot;Faust&quot;, Rainis also translated the works of William Shakespeare, Friedrich Schiller, Heinrich Heine, and Aleksandr Pushkin into Latvian. These translations helped to expand his native language by adding new words to its vocabulary.

== Foreign exile ==
Rainis was also socially active and politically prominent, being one of the national leaders of the Revolution of 1905 in Latvia and the New Current that foreshadowed it. With the failure of the Revolution, he emigrated to Switzerland together with his wife Aspazija, settling in Castagnola, a suburb of Lugano. As an émigré, Rainis wrote:

*plays — &quot;Zelta Zirgs&quot; (&quot;The Golden Horse&quot;) (translated to English 2012), &quot;Jāzeps un viņa brāļi&quot; (&quot;Joseph and His Brothers&quot;), &quot;Spēlēju, dancoju&quot; (&quot;I Played, I Danced&quot;), &quot;Daugava&quot; (The Daugava, 1916), and &quot;Ģirts Vilks&quot;;
*poetry — &quot;Klusā grāmata&quot; (&quot;The Quiet Book&quot;), Vēja nesta lapas (&quot;Leaves Upon the Wind&quot;), &quot;Tie, kas neaizmirst&quot; (&quot;Those, Who Do Not Forget&quot;), &quot;Gals un sākums&quot; (&quot;The End and the Beginning&quot;), &quot;Ave sol&quot;, and &quot;Sveika, brīvā Latvija&quot; (&quot;Hello, Free Latvia&quot;).

His dramatic ballad &quot;Daugava&quot; contained the first explicit demand for Latvian sovereignty:

Those lines were removed by the censor when the work was first published in Moscow. After the defeat of Bermondt-Avalov&#x27;s forces at Riga in November 1919, the ballad was performed at the National Theater to mark the first anniversary of Latvia&#x27;s proclamation of independence; many soldiers carried this work into battle.

&quot;Zelta Zirgs&quot; (&quot;The Golden Horse&quot;) was translated into English in 2012 by Vilis Inde.

During his exile, Rainis published several more works, such as &quot;Gals un sākums&quot; (or &quot;End and Beginning&quot; in English, published 1912). These works used political and revolutionary symbolism and also borrowed ideas from Hegelian philosophy. He also penned plays which linked Latvian folklore to the country&#x27;s modern, political struggles.

== Return to Latvia ==

Rainis and Aspazija returned to Latvia on 4 April 1920 and received a hero&#x27;s welcome. They had served as the spiritual leaders in the fight for Latvian independence. Rainis, as a member of the Central Committee of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party, resumed his political activities and was a member of the Constitutional Assembly of Latvia (Satversmes sapulce) and Saeima (Parliament) and of the Ministry of Education Arts Department, founder and director of the &quot;Dailes&quot; Theater, and director of the Latvian National Theatre from 1921 to 1925, Minister of Education from December 1926 to January 1928, and a member of the Cultural Fund and (Military) Order of Lāčplēsis Council. During this period he wrote:

* plays — &quot;Iļja Muromietis&quot; (&quot;Ilya Muromets&quot;), &quot;Mīla stiprāka par nāvi&quot; (&quot;A Love Stronger Than Death&quot;), &quot;Rīgas ragana&quot; (&quot;The Witch of Riga&quot;);
* poetry — &quot;Treji loki&quot;, &quot;Sudrabota gaisma&quot; (&quot;A Silvery Light&quot;), &quot;Mēness meitiņa&quot; (&quot;Moon Girl&quot;), &quot;Zelta sietiņš&quot; (&quot;The Gold Strainer&quot;), and others;
* memoirs — &quot;Kastaņjola&quot; (&quot;Castagnola&quot;).

Rainis had the ambition of becoming Latvia&#x27;s president and became less prominent in politics when this ambition was not fulfilled.

Rainis did become one of the first recipients of the Commander Grand Cross of the Order of the Three Stars of Latvia – the nation&#x27;s highest award – on 28 February 1925.

He died in Majori in 1929.

== Legacy and commemoration==
A number of Rainis&#x27; poetry collections were published posthumously: &quot;Sirds devējs&quot;, &quot;Dvēseles Dziesma&quot;, &quot;Lielās līnijas&quot;, and &quot;Aizas ziedi&quot;.

Rainis&#x27; statue at the Esplanāde in Riga is a gathering place that highlights the complex way his multi-faceted career and works are interpreted. It is the focal point for the national poetry festival, always held on his birthday, as well as a focus for the left wing, from the Social Democrats to the radical opposition to Latvia&#x27;s education reform (in part because of Rainis&#x27; support for minority schools; he was instrumental to the founding of Belarusian schools in Latvia). Similarly, criticism of his work has often been strongly affected by politics; while the Soviets emphasized his socialism (his image even appeared on a commemorative Soviet rouble coin; being buried next to Rainis&#x27; grave in Rainis&#x27; Cemetery in Riga was an honour reserved for senior Soviet military), &quot;Daugava&quot; and other patriotic works were omitted from editions of Rainis&#x27; texts prior to the Third Latvian National Awakening.
