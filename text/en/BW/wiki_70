<text>Tony Jay (2 February 1933 – 13 August 2006) was a British actor. A former member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, he was known for his voice work in radio, animation, film, and video games. Jay was particularly noted for his distinctive raspy baritone voice, which often led to him being cast in villainous or authoritative roles. His voice acting roles included Claude Frollo in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1996), Megabyte in &quot;ReBoot&quot; (1994–2001), Shere Khan in &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot; (replacing George Sanders, who played the character in the original film), the TV series &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, and the Elder God (plus various other roles) in the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; series of video games.

Jay also made many distinguished on-screen appearances, including the role of Nigel St John on &quot;Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; (1993–1995). He further made guest appearances on programs including &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; in 1987, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; in 1990 to 1991, and &quot;Night Court&quot; in 1991. Jay also portrayed Professor Werner in &quot;Twins&quot; (1988), the father figure/mentor to Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s character, Julius Benedict.

==Early life==
Jay was born in London. He attended Pinner County Grammar School, and completed his National Service with the Royal Air Force in 1953. He later recalled, &quot;I was always an actor at school&quot;; but opted for the financial security of a real estate business. Jay moved to South Africa in about 1966, after hearing of the potential there for his line of work. He left South Africa to return to England in 1973, after which he moved to the United States in 1986.

==Career==
While establishing his real estate business in England, Jay acted occasionally in amateur productions.

=== South Africa ===
Within three months of relocating to South Africa at the age of 33, Jay found himself acting in radio dramas such as the detective series &quot;Sounds of Darkness&quot; where he played a savvy but blind FBI agent (1967–1972). The experience led him to decide to take acting up professionally.

Jay acted, wrote, and directed radio plays on the South African Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s first commercial radio station, Springbok Radio (1950–85). He was especially associated with the comic series &quot;Taxi!&quot; (1969–1972,1975–1978), in which he not only portrayed New York cabby Red Kowalski, but also co-wrote many scripts with Joe Stewardson. Other shows in which he was involved included &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, and &quot;Tuesday Theatre&quot;. Jay adapted, cast, and directed the first 6 months of episodes for &quot;The Avengers&quot;. The series, based on Seasons 4–6 of the 1960s British television series of the same name, was broadcast on Springbok from 6 December 1971 to 28 December 1973. To bridge the gap between the visual orientation of the British television series and the sound-only perspective of radio, Jay created a narrator which he embued with irony and scepticism.

Jay&#x27;s voice work led him to do commercials for companies such as Gunston Cigarettes, Barclays Bank, and Bols Brandy.

=== United Kingdom ===
After Jay&#x27;s return to Britain in 1973 he worked in various television productions. For the BBC series &quot;Fall of Eagles&quot; (1974) he portrayed Tsar Alexander III of Russia, during which time he met Patrick Stewart, who played Vladimir Lenin. Jay appeared as the merchant in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; (1981) for BBC Shakespeare, and in single episodes of popular television programmes such as &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (1975), &quot;The Professionals&quot; (1978) and the comedy &quot;Whoops Apocalypse&quot; (1982).

During this period he was cast as Vladimir Maximovitch in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Love and Death&quot; (1975), which was shot in Hungary and France. George Lucas met with Jay about playing Obi-Wan Kenobi in a planned film with the working title &quot;Galactic Warfare&quot;. Despite Jay agreeing to the role, Lucas decided to cast Alec Guinness, instead.

On stage he had small roles in plays such as Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; (1976) and Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; (1981). More important roles followed with an appearance as Jaggers in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1984) at the Old Vic, and as Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;.

Jay was cast as Vincent Crummles in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s -hour-long production of &quot;The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (1986) at Stratford-upon-Avon.

=== United States ===
After a tour of Britain, &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; embarked on a limited tour of the United States, starting with performances in Los Angeles in June 1986, then on to Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and New York City. &quot;Even before I left England, I told friends I&#x27;d be staying if I got the chance,&quot; he recalled in a 1986 &quot;The New York Times&quot; interview.

During its run from August to October 1986 at the Broadhurst Theatre on Broadway, Jay&#x27;s performance was described as &quot;brilliantly played&quot; by the &quot;New York Times&quot;. Consequently, he was nominated for the 1987 Drama Desk Award as Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play.

Jay&#x27;s acting drew the attention of an agent who arranged for him to return from England to the United States for an audition. Jay was cast in a pilot program called &quot;Circus&quot; which was unsuccessful. On set Jay met make-up artist Kathy Rogers, who would become his second wife. He moved to the United States where he became a resident.

In addition, Jay won parts in television series such as &quot;Night Court&quot; (1984), &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; (1987), &quot;Twins&quot; (1988), and &quot;Eerie, Indiana&quot; (1991). Bigger roles included Paracelsus on the 1987 CBS TV series adaptation of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;; Minister Campio on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1992); and Lex Luthor&#x27;s villainous aide-de-camp Nigel St. John in &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; (1993–95).

Jay&#x27;s voice-over work included Monsieur D&#x27;Arque, the amoral asylum superintendent, in Disney&#x27;s 1991 hit animated film version of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. From 1994 to 2001 he supplied the voice for the virus Megabyte in the animated television show &quot;ReBoot&quot;. According to one source, Jay was preferred to Patrick Stewart, Derek Jacobi and Ian McKellen for the voice of the main antagonist Judge Claude Frollo in Disney&#x27;s 1996 animated film adaptation of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, who had also steered his performance in the film version of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. Jay reprised Frollo&#x27;s voice for Walt Disney World&#x27;s nighttime light and fireworks show &quot;Fantasmic!&quot; From 1995 to 1996 Jay was the voice of the alien warlord Lord Dregg, the villain during the last two seasons of the original 1987 &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; animated TV series.

He is also well known among fans of the 1996–2003 video game series &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; for his voicing of the original Mortanius and of the Elder God, alongside several other minor characters.

In various animated projects Jay took over the voice of Shere Khan, which actor George Sanders had originated for the 1967 Disney animated film &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. In 11 episodes spanning 1990–91, Jay voiced Shere Khan for Disney&#x27;s animated TV series &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, &quot;The Jungle Book: Rhythm and Groove&quot; videogame (2000), and &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (2001–02). His final appearance as Khan came in the 2003 film &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot;. His final role was voicing Spiderus in the &quot;Miss Spider&quot; series.

Jay was a devotee of classic Broadway and made several recordings and performances of old-time Broadway lyrics, in spoken-word form. A CD of these readings, &quot;Speaking of Broadway&quot;, was released in 2005; a version recorded in 1996 was entitled &quot;Poets on Broadway&quot;, as was his website. On it Jay recites lyrics written by the likes of Noël Coward, Ira Gershwin, and Oscar Hammerstein, accompanied by synthesized music which he composed.

==Personal life==
Jay began a relationship with Marta MacGeraghty in 1974. They had a son, born in 1989. They did not marry until 2004, and remained together until Jay&#x27;s death in 2006.

==Illness and death==
In April 2006, Jay underwent surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles to remove a non-cancerous tumour from his lungs. Afterwards he became critically ill and was readmitted to Cedars Sinai, where he died on 13 August 2006, aged 73.

<text>Brundibár is a children&#x27;s opera by Jewish Czech composer Hans Krása with a libretto by Adolf Hoffmeister, made most famous by performances by the children of Theresienstadt concentration camp (Terezín) in occupied Czechoslovakia. The name comes from a Czech colloquialism for a bumblebee.

==History==
Krása and Hoffmeister wrote the opera in 1938 for a government competition, but the competition was later cancelled due to political developments. Rehearsals started in 1941 at the Jewish orphanage in Prague, which served a temporary educational facility for children separated from their parents by the war. In the winter of 1942 the opera was first performed at the orphanage for a limited audience of 150 people: by this time, composer Krása and set designer František Zelenka had already been transported to Theresienstadt. By July 1943, nearly all of the children of the original chorus and the orphanage staff had also been transported to Theresienstadt. Only the librettist Hoffmeister was able to escape Prague in time.

Reunited with the cast in Theresienstadt, Krása reconstructed the full score of the opera, based on memory and the partial piano score that remained in his hands, adapting it to suit the musical instruments available in the camp: flute, clarinet, guitar, accordion, piano, percussion, four violins, a cello and a double bass. A set was once again designed by František Zelenka, formerly a stage manager at the Czech National Theatre: several flats were painted as a background, in the foreground was a fence with drawings of the cat, dog and sparrow and holes for the singers to insert their heads in place of the animals&#x27; heads. On 23 September 1943, &quot;Brundibár&quot; premiered in Theresienstadt. The production was directed by Zelenka and choreographed by Camilla Rosenbaum, and was shown 55 times in the following year.

A special performance of &quot;Brundibár&quot; was staged in 1944 for representatives of the Red Cross who came to inspect living conditions in the camp; much of what they saw during their visit was a show, and that one of the reasons the Theresienstadt camp seemed acceptable was that many of the residents had been deported to Auschwitz in order to reduce crowding during the visit.

Later that year this &quot;Brundibár&quot; production was filmed for a Nazi propaganda film &quot;Theresienstadt: ein Dokumentarfilm aus dem jüdischen Siedlungsgebiet&quot; &quot;(Theresienstadt: a documentary film from the Jewish settlement area)&quot;. In the following months many of those filmed were sent to Auschwitz. Amongst those who were murdered there were the children, the composer Krása, the director Kurt Gerron, and the musicians.

The &quot;Brundibár&quot; footage from the film is included in the Emmy Award-winning documentary &quot;Voices of the Children&quot; directed by Zuzana Justman, a Terezin survivor, who sang in the chorus. Ela Weissberger, who played the part of the cat, appears in the film. The footage appears again in &quot;As Seen Through These Eyes&quot;, a 2009 documentary directed by Hilary Helstein. There Weissberger describes the opera in some detail, noting that the only time that the children were permitted to remove their yellow stars was during a performance.

==Storyline==
The plot of the opera shares elements with fairytales such as &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; and &quot;The Town Musicians of Bremen&quot;. Aninka [in English Annette] and Pepíček (Little Joe) are a fatherless sister and brother. Their mother is ill, and the doctor tells them she needs milk to recover. But they have no money. They decide to sing in the marketplace to raise the needed money. But the evil organ grinder Brundibár (of this figure Iván Fischer has said, &quot;Everyone knew he represented Hitler&quot;) chases them away. However, with the help of a fearless sparrow, keen cat, and wise dog, and the children of the town, they are able to chase Brundibár away, and sing in the market square.

==Symbolism==

The opera contains obvious symbolism in the triumph of the helpless and needy children over the tyrannical organ grinder, but has no overt references to the conditions under which it was written and performed. However, certain phrases were to the audience clearly anti-Nazi. Though Hoffmeister wrote the libretto before Hitler&#x27;s invasion, at least one line was changed by poet Emil Saudek at Terezin, to emphasize the anti-Nazi message. &quot;While the original said,&#x27;He who loves so much his mother and father and his native land is our friend and he can play with us,&#x27; Saudek&#x27;s version reads: &#x27;He who loves justice and will abide by it, and who is not afraid, is our friend and can play with us.&#x27;&quot;(Karas, p. 103).

== Reconstruction in &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; ==
In the American miniseries &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;, in episode 10, an excerpt from the opera Brundibar can be seen being staged on the day of the visit by Red Cross representatives. The set design has been reconstructed (painted houses, fences, ice cream cart). As the inspectors look into the theatre, the children act out the ending of the 6th scene from the Act 1.

==Mecklenburgh Opera Production UK 1992==
Mecklenburgh Opera Production: UK 1992. Mecklenburgh Opera brought &quot;Brundibar&quot; to the UK in 1992. The company&#x27;s Artistic director John Abulafia created an English performing version. This was staged at London&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Hall in a double bill with another Terezin opera, &quot;The Emperor of Atlantis&quot; by Viktor Ullmann. John Abulafia directed, Anne Manson conducted, the cast was drawn from the New London Children&#x27;s Choir. This production was filmed by the BBC, the TV director was Simon Broughton: it was shown on VE Day 1995.

Mecklenburgh Opera then revived the production at Stirling Arts Centre in 1995, the Janáček Festival at Hukvaldy in 1996. John Abulafia revived the production in 2002 with the Halle Orchestra. The cast was drawn from schools in Salford and the Halle conducted by Edward Gardner. It was staged as part of the opening celebrations of the Imperial War Museum North.

==The Kushner version==

In 2003, the opera was adapted into a children&#x27;s picture book by Tony Kushner with illustrations by Maurice Sendak. Sendak emphasized the symbolism of the opera by drawing the character of Brundibár with a Hitler moustache. The book was named one of the New York Times Book Review&#x27;s 10 Best Illustrated Books of 2003. The book was named a Sydney Taylor Book Award Notable book for Older Readers in 2003.

The opera was performed in 2003 at Chicago Opera Theater; directed and designed by Sendak, with Tony Kushner&#x27;s libretto.

In 2005, the book was turned into a full production of the opera, with libretto by Tony Kushner adapted from Hoffmeister&#x27;s. Sendak and Kris Stone designed the sets and Robin I. Shane designed the costumes for the new production. The opera premiered at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre where it was performed along with another short Czech opera, &quot;Comedy on the Bridge&quot;, with music by Bohuslav Martinů and libretto by Tony Kushner adapted from Václav Kliment Klicpera. The opera then moved to the New Victory Theater for its Off-Broadway New York premiere, and &quot;Comedy on the Bridge&quot; was replaced with a new Kushner play, &quot;But the Giraffe&quot;. &quot;But the Giraffe&quot; was about a young girl who was faced with the difficult decision of taking her beloved stuffed giraffe or her uncle&#x27;s &quot;Brundibár&quot; score. It served as a curtain raiser for &quot;Brundibár&quot;. In 2005 and 2011, the children&#x27;s opera was performed at the Victory Theatre in Evansville, Indiana.

In 2006, &quot;Brundibár&quot; and &quot;Comedy on the Bridge&quot; were staged by the Yale Repertory Theater in New Haven, CT.

==Performance history==
The opera has enjoyed increasing popularity in recent years, and has been performed in different versions in England, Czech Republic, Israel, Australia and across the United States. In 1995 in Germany and in Austria the opera was performed as a part of a school and memory project in cooperation with survivors from Terezín, such as Herbert Thomas Mandl or Eva Hermannová. The American premiere of &quot;Brundibar&quot; (in Czech) took place in West Hartford, CT on April 8, 1975; the world premiere of the English version, in the translation of Milada Javora and Joža Karas, was held in Ottawa, Canada on November 14, 1977.

Cherub Company London presented a fully professional UK production at the Riverside Studios, London, in 2001. The production was unusual inasmuch as the children&#x27;s characters were played by adult actors (Samuel Dutton and Kathryn Fray). The remaining characters, including Brundibár himself (William Wollen), were played by actors on stilts, creating a nightmarish world for the children. The production was directed by Andrew Visnevski and was presented in a double bill with &quot;Kafka&#x27;s The Trial&quot; under the title &quot;Degenerate! A double-fare to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust.&quot;

In 2006, students from the University of Texas at San Antonio performed &quot;Brundibár&quot; in Terezin itself, becoming the first American production to return the show to the site where it was originally performed.

===Other performances===
The Australian premiere of the opera was staged in 2000 in Canberra, in conjunction with the exhibition &quot;Behind the Walls: The Theresienstadt Ghetto 1941-1945&quot;. It was also staged by the Windmill Theatre Company in Adelaide in 2003, in what was described as &quot;a highly politicised&quot; production. Both these productions were conducted by Richard Gill.

In October 2000, Cincinnati Opera presented &quot;Brundibár&quot; at the Aronoff Center, with John Morris Russell conducting and stage direction by Brian Robertson. In attendance was Ela Stein-Weissberger, who sang the role of the Cat in Theresienstadt and was one of the few children who survived. During the final moments of the production, Ms. Weissberger emerged from the wings to sing the Victory Song alongside the cast. The opera&#x27;s prologue also featured local survivors who appeared on stage while young actors told their stories.

In December 2003 and 2004 respectively, Santa Monica College&#x27;s Madison Project in conjunction with Los Angeles Opera run children&#x27;s camp performed Brundibár at Miles Memorial Playhouse, the Museum of Tolerance, and the Santa Monica College 11th street campus, where The Broad Stage has since been built. Survivors of Terezin were in attendance and spoke at all performances about their experiences.

In November 2004, &quot;Brundibar&quot; was performed by OzOpera, the touring arm of Opera Australia, as part of the Gandel Festival of Jewish Music. The first Melbourne performance was attended by Peter Gaspar, who had performed in the original Terezin performances as a child of 7. He survived the war and migrated with his family to Australia.

In May 2014, Nieuw Vocaal Amsterdam performed Brundibár as part of the yearly Dutch commemoration of World War II. The performance was attended by Ela Weissberger. A documentary was shot in Theresienstadt by Dutch national television, in which Caro Kindt, director of Nieuw Vocaal Amsterdam, spoke with one of the Theresienstadt survivors.

In August 2014, &quot;Brundibár&quot; was staged in Sydney (Australia) by Opera Prometheus and Joseph Toltz in association with the Sydney Jewish Museum. The production featured a reproduction of artwork by the child survivor Kitty Passerová Levy, with consultation from Theresienstadt survivors living in Australia, including Jaroslav (Jerry) Rind, who helped with the original construction of the set in Theresienstadt, as well as Edith Druckerová Sheldon and Joe Neustatl, both of whom had seen the production in the ghetto.

On February 8–9, 2019, Project Opera, the youth opera training program of the Minnesota Opera, performed &quot;Brundibar&quot; (Kushner translation) at the Lab Theatre in Downtown Minneapolis.

In 2019, &quot;Brundibár&quot; was performed by WNO Youth Opera in the Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff.

On November 4-7, 2021, the Virginia Children&#x27;s Chorus Concert Choir performed &quot;Brundibar&quot; preceded by Elie Wiesel&#x27;s play, &quot;The Trial of God&quot;, at Christopher Newport University&#x27;s Ferguson Center for the Arts in Newport News, Virginia. The performance was shown as part of the University&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on the Holocaust&quot; exhibition, where the two theatrical works were performed together for the first time.

<doc id="651519" wikidata="Q299302" url="?curid=651519" title="Michael Gough">
<text>Francis Michael Gough ( ; 23 November 1916 – 17 March 2011) was a British actor who made more than 150 film and television appearances. He is known for his roles in the Hammer horror films from 1958, with his first role as Sir Arthur Holmwood in &quot;Dracula&quot;, and for his recurring role as Alfred Pennyworth from 1989 to 1997 in the four &quot;Batman&quot; films directed by Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher. He appeared in three more Burton films: &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, voicing Elder Gutknecht in &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; and the Dodo in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

Gough also appeared in popular British television shows, including &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (as the villain in &quot;The Celestial Toymaker&quot; (1966) and as Councillor Hedin in &quot;Arc of Infinity&quot; (1983)), and in an episode of &quot;The Avengers&quot; as the automation-obsessed wheelchair user Dr. Armstrong in &quot;The Cybernauts&quot; (1965). In 1956 he received a British Academy Television Award for Best Actor.

At the National Theatre in London Gough excelled as a comedian, playing a resigned and rueful parent in Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s &quot;Bedroom Farce&quot; (1977). When the comedy transferred to Broadway in 1978 he won a Tony Award. One of Gough&#x27;s most well-received West End roles was as Baron von Epp in the 1983 revival of John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;A Patriot for Me&quot;.

==Early life==
Gough was born in Kuala Lumpur, Federated Malay States (now Malaysia) on 23 November 1916, the son of English parents Francis Berkeley Gough, a rubber planter, and Frances Atkins (née Bailie). Gough was educated at Rose Hill School, Tunbridge Wells, and at Durham School. He moved on to Wye Agricultural College, which he left to go to The Old Vic. During World War II Gough was a conscientious objector, like his friend Frith Banbury, although he was obliged to serve in the Non-Combatant Corps, a member of 6 Northern Company, in Liverpool.

==Career==
In 1948, Gough made his film debut in &quot;Blanche Fury&quot; and thereafter appeared extensively on British television. In 1955, he portrayed one of the two murderers (the other was Michael Ripper) who kill the Duke of Clarence (John Gielgud), as well as the Princes in the Tower in Laurence Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;.

Gough became known for his appearances in horror films; following his performance as Arthur Holmwood in Hammer&#x27;s original &quot;Dracula&quot; (1958), his horror roles mainly saw him feature as slimy villains, notably in &quot;Horrors of the Black Museum&quot; (1959), &quot;Konga&quot; (1961), &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1962), &quot;Black Zoo&quot; (1963), &quot;Trog&quot; (1970), &quot;The Corpse&quot; (1971), &quot;Horror Hospital&quot; (1973) and Norman J. Warren&#x27;s cheaply made Satanism shocker &quot;Satan&#x27;s Slave&quot; (1976). He also spoofed his horror persona in &quot;What a Carve Up!&quot; (1961) as a sinister butler. He also appeared in the comedy film &quot;Top Secret!&quot; (1984), alongside Val Kilmer (the latter&#x27;s first feature film), with whom he would also work later in the film &quot;Batman Forever&quot;.

Gough guest-starred in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, as the titular villain in &quot;The Celestial Toymaker&quot; (1966) and also as Councillor Hedin in &quot;Arc of Infinity&quot; (1983). He was set to reprise his role as the Toymaker in the proposed 23rd-season story &quot;The Nightmare Fair&quot;, but the season and the serial were cancelled and never produced. He also played the automation-obsessed wheelchair user Dr. Armstrong in &quot;The Cybernauts&quot;, one of the best-remembered episodes of &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1965), returning the following season as the Russian spymaster Nutski in &quot;The Correct Way to Kill&quot;. He was introduced in the first-season episode &quot;Maximum Security&quot; of &quot;Colditz&quot; as Major &quot;Willi&quot; Schaeffer, the alcoholic second-in-command of the Kommandant (Bernard Hepton). In the Ian Curteis television play &quot;Suez 1956&quot; (1979), he portrayed Prime Minister Anthony Eden. In 1981, he was reunited with Laurence Olivier in Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, portraying the doctor to Olivier&#x27;s dying Lord Marchmain. He played Mikhel, a slippery assistant to a slain British spy opposite Alec Guinness in the television adaptation of John le Carré&#x27;s &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot; the following year. Gough also appeared in &quot;The Citadel&quot; (1983) as Sir Jenner Halliday, in 1985&#x27;s &quot;Out of Africa&quot; as Lord Delamere and as the fictional deposed KGB spymaster Andrei Zorin in &quot;Sleepers&quot;.

===Later roles===
Later in his career, Gough played Alfred Pennyworth in Tim Burton&#x27;s blockbuster films &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) and &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992). He returned to the role in &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995) and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997) for Joel Schumacher. Gough was one of two actors to have appeared in the four &quot;Batman&quot; films in the Burton/Schumacher series—the other being Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon. He also voiced the character in two BBC radio dramas—&quot;&quot; (1989) and the 1994 adaptation of &quot;&quot;. Gough reprised his role in a 1989 advertisement for Diet Coke and in 2000, in six television commercials for the OnStar automobile tracking system (informing Batman of the system&#x27;s installation in the Batmobile).

Gough retired in 1999 after appearing in Burton&#x27;s &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;. He would emerge from retirement twice more, both as a favour to Burton, to voice Elder Gutknecht in &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; and the Dodo in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gough was married four times. He married his first wife Diana Graves in 1937; their son Simon Peter was born in 1942 and they divorced in 1948. His second wife was Anne Elizabeth Leon (born 1925). They married in 1950, their daughter Emma Frances was born in 1953 and they divorced in 1962. His third wife was &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actress Anneke Wills, who portrayed the Doctor&#x27;s companion Polly. Wills and Gough met at various times during her life, firstly during a theatre trip with her mother in 1952, but they first met formally on the set of &quot;Candidate for Murder&quot; and the attraction was instant. Gough adopted Wills&#x27;s daughter Polly and in 1965 their son Jasper was born. Polly died in a motorcycle accident in 1982 at the age of 19, believing that Gough was her biological father. Gough married Henrietta Lawrence (his fourth wife) in 1981, and they remained together until his death.

==Death==
Gough died from cancer aged 94 on 17 March 2011 at his home in Salisbury, Wiltshire. A memorial service was held, he was cremated, and his ashes were scattered in the English Channel.

Gough was survived by his fourth wife Henrietta, daughter Emma and son Simon (an actor who is married to actress Sharon Gurney, the daughter of the &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; actress Rachel Gurney) and Jasper, a photographer. Michael Keaton, who played the title character in the first two theatrical Batman films opposite Gough, paid tribute to him, describing him as sweet and charming, and wrote &quot;To Mick – my butler, my confidant, my friend, my Alfred. I love you. God bless. Michael (Mr. Wayne) Keaton.&quot;

Gough was added to &quot;In Memoriam&quot; at the 18th Screen Actors Guild Awards.

==Awards and nominations==
Gough won Broadway&#x27;s 1979 Tony Award as Best Actor (Featured Role – Play) for &quot;Bedroom Farce&quot;. He was also nominated in the same category in 1988 for &quot;Breaking the Code&quot;.

In 1957 Gough won a BAFTA TV Award and in 1971, was nominated for a BAFTA Film Award for his work in &quot;The Go-Between&quot;.

Gough was nominated for a Drama Desk Award Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play in 1979 for &quot;Bedroom Farce&quot; and again in 1988 for &quot;Breaking the Code&quot;.

<doc id="651521" wikidata="Q338831" url="?curid=651521" title="Mule deer">
<text>The mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) is a deer indigenous to western North America; it is named for its ears, which are large like those of the mule. Two subspecies of mule deer are grouped into the black-tailed deer.

Unlike the related white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;), which is found throughout most of North America east of the Rocky Mountains and in the valleys of the Rocky Mountains from Idaho and Wyoming northward, mule deer are found only on the western Great Plains, in the Rocky Mountains, in the southwest United States, and on the west coast of North America. Mule deer have also been introduced to Argentina and Kauai, Hawaii.

==Taxonomy==
Mule deer can be divided into two main groups: the mule deer (&quot;sensu stricto&quot;) and the black-tailed deer. The first group includes all subspecies, except &quot;O. h. columbianus&quot; and &quot;O. h. sitkensis&quot;, which are in the black-tailed deer group. The two main groups have been treated as separate species, but they hybridize, and virtually all recent authorities treat the mule deer and black-tailed deer as conspecific. Mule deer apparently evolved from the black-tailed deer. Despite this, the mtDNA of the white-tailed deer and mule deer is similar, but differs from that of the black-tailed deer. This may be the result of introgression, although hybrids between the mule deer and white-tailed deer are rare in the wild (apparently more common locally in West Texas), and the hybrid survival rate is low even in captivity. Many claims of observations of wild hybrids are not legitimate, as identification based on external features is complicated.

===Subspecies===
Some authorities have recognized &quot;O. h. crooki&quot; as a senior synonym of &quot;O. h. eremicus&quot;, but the type specimen of the former is a hybrid between the mule deer and white-tailed deer, so the name &quot;O. h. crooki&quot; is invalid. Additionally, the validity of &quot;O. h. inyoensis&quot; has been questioned, and the two insular &quot;O. h. cerrosensis&quot; and &quot;O. h. sheldoni&quot; may be synonyms of &quot;O. h. eremicus&quot; or &quot;O. h. peninsulae&quot;.

The 10 valid subspecies, based on the third edition of &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot;, are:

* Mule deer (&quot;sensu stricto&quot;) group:
**&quot;O. h. californicus&quot; – California mule deer. This widespread subspecies is found throughout much of California (north of San Diego and Imperial), with high densities in Orange and Los Angeles Counties to coastal Santa Barbara, Ventura, and San Luis Obispo; from Morro Bay to Santa Cruz, along the coast, its range is somewhat patchier. Inland, the California mule deer is known from around San Bernardino to as far north as Lassen; many deer inhabit the areas in and around Sequoia National Park, Yosemite, Plumas National Forest, and of course, the Sierra Nevada, its range partly overlapping with that of the Inyo subspecies (&quot;O. h. inyoensis&quot;). It is notably absent from the Central Valley and the agricultural districts of the state (roughly between Bakersfield and Sacramento); north of San Francisco, it is replaced by the Columbian subspecies (&quot;O. h. columbianus&quot;). It is also known to range across the border into west-central Nevada, between Reno and Carson City.
**&quot;O. h. cerrosensis&quot; – Cedros or Cerros Island mule deer, after Cedros Island, off of the southwestern Pacific coast of Baja California state, the subspecies&#x27; sole habitat.
**&quot;O. h. eremicus&quot; – Desert or burro mule deer. Primarily found in the Lower Colorado River Valley, Southern California&#x27;s Inland Empire, the areas around Las Vegas and extreme southern Nevada, much of Arizona and parts of southern New Mexico. In Mexico, it is primarily known from Sonora, having been known from as far south as Hermosillo; it has also been observed (somewhat out-of-range) in Coahuila, Chihuahua and Durango.
**&quot;O. h. fuliginatus&quot; – Southern mule deer. Mainly found in Southern California (Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego Counties) and along the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, into the northern half of the Baja California Peninsula, where it has been sighted as far south as El Rosario. Notably high population densities occur to the west of Anza-Borrego Desert State Park (in the San Diego County portion of the Cleveland National Forest) and in and around the region of Julian, California.
**&quot;O. h. hemionus&quot; – Rocky Mountain mule deer. Primarily found in western and central North America, as far south as Colorado and as far north as Yukon and the Northwest Territories, including inland British Columbia.
**&quot;O. h. inyoensis&quot; – Inyo mule deer (named after Inyo County, California). This deer is primarily found within the Sierra Nevada and Yosemite, within inland Central California, and has been sighted as far south as Death Valley and as far north as the Stanislaus National Forest.
**&quot;O. h. peninsulae&quot; – Baja or Peninsular mule deer; found across the majority of the state of Baja California Sur, Mexico.
**&quot;O. h. sheldoni&quot; – Tiburón Island mule deer, also called the venado bura de Tiburón in Spanish. This deer is only found on Tiburón Island, Mexico, in the Gulf of California.
* Black-tailed deer group:
**&quot;O. h. columbianus&quot; – Columbian black-tailed deer; found primarily in coastal temperate rainforest habitats of the Pacific Northwest and Northern California (north of approx. the San Francisco Bay Area to Vancouver, BC)
**&quot;O. h. sitkensis&quot; – Sitka black-tailed deer (named after Sitka, Alaska); found in similar temperate rainforests as the Columbian subspecies—though with a more northerly range—from the central coast of British Columbia (including Haida Gwaii) throughout Southeast Alaska (along the Gulf of Alaska), with smaller populations further north to Anchorage, the Kenai Peninsula, and Kodiak Island. Found typically in dense, lush habitats, such as the Great Bear Rainforest and Tongass National Forest.

==Description==

The most noticeable differences between white-tailed and mule deer are ear size, tail color, and antler configuration. In many cases, body size is also a key difference. The mule deer&#x27;s tail is black-tipped, whereas the white-tailed deer&#x27;s is not. Mule deer antlers are bifurcated; they &quot;fork&quot; as they grow, rather than branching from a single main beam, as is the case with white-tails.

Each spring, a buck&#x27;s antlers start to regrow almost immediately after the old antlers are shed. Shedding typically takes place in mid-February, with variations occurring by locale.

Although capable of running, mule deer are often seen stotting (also called pronking), with all four feet coming down together.

The mule deer is the larger of the three &quot;Odocoileus&quot; species on average, with a height of at the shoulders and a nose-to-tail length ranging from . Of this, the tail may comprise . Adult bucks normally weigh , averaging around , although trophy specimens may weigh up to . Does (female deer) are smaller and typically weigh from , with an average of around .

Unlike the white-tailed, the mule deer does not generally show marked size variation across its range, although environmental conditions can cause considerable weight fluctuations in any given population. An exception to this is the Sitka deer subspecies (&quot;O. h. sitkensis&quot;). This race is markedly smaller than other mule deer, with an average weight of and in males and females, respectively.

==Seasonal behaviors==
In addition to movements related to available shelter and food, the breeding cycle is important in understanding deer behavior. The rut or mating season usually begins in the fall as does go into estrus for a period of a few days, and males become more aggressive, competing for mates. Does may mate with more than one buck and go back into estrus within a month if they did not become pregnant. The gestation period is about 190–200 days, with fawns born in the spring. The survival rate of the fawns during labor is about 50%. Fawns stay with their mothers during the summer and are weaned in the fall after about 60–75 days. Mule deer females usually give birth to two fawns, although if it is their first time having a fawn, they often have just one.

A buck&#x27;s antlers fall off during the winter, then grow again in preparation for the next season&#x27;s rut. The annual cycle of antler growth is regulated by changes in the length of the day.

The size of mule deer groups follows a marked seasonal pattern. Groups are smallest during fawning season (June and July in Saskatchewan and Alberta) and largest in early gestation (winter; February and March in Saskatchewan and Alberta).

Besides humans, the three leading predators of mule deer are coyotes, wolves, and cougars. Bobcats, Canada lynx, wolverines, American black bears, and grizzly bears may prey upon adult deer but most often attack only fawns or infirm specimens, or they may eat a deer after it has died naturally. Bears and small carnivores are typically opportunistic feeders and pose little threat to a strong, healthy mule deer.

==Diet and foraging behaviors==
In 99 studies of mule deer diets, some 788 species of plants were eaten by mule deer, and their diets vary greatly depending on the season, geographic region, year, and elevation. The studies gave these data for Rocky Mountain mule deer diets:

The diets of mule deer are very similar to those of white-tailed deer in areas where they coexist. Mule deer are intermediate feeders rather than pure browsers or grazers; they predominantly browse but also eat forb vegetation, small amounts of grass and, where available, tree or shrub fruits such as beans, pods, nuts (including acorns), and berries.

Mule deer readily adapt to agricultural products and landscape plantings. In the Sierra Nevada range, mule deer depend on the lichen &quot;Bryoria fremontii&quot; as a winter food source.

The most common plant species consumed by mule deer are the following:

* Among trees and shrubs: &quot;Artemisia tridentata&quot; (big sagebrush), &quot;Cercocarpus ledifolius&quot; (curlleaf mountain mahogany), &quot;Cercocarpus montanus&quot; (true mountain mahogany), &quot;Cowania mexicana&quot; (Mexican cliffrose), &quot;Populus tremuloides&quot; (quaking aspen), &quot;Purshia tridentata&quot; (antelope bitterbrush), &quot;Quercus gambelii&quot; (Gambel oak), and &quot;Rhus trilobata&quot; (skunkbush sumac). 
* Among forbs: &quot;Achillea millefolium&quot; (western yarrow), &quot;Antennaria&quot; (pussytoes) species, &quot;Artemisia frigida&quot; (fringed sagebrush), &quot;Artemisia ludoviciana&quot; (Louisiana sagewort), &quot;Aster&quot; species, &quot;Astragalus&quot; (milkvetch) species, &quot;Balsamorhiza sagittata&quot; (arrowleaf balsamroot), &quot;Cirsium&quot; (thistle) species, &quot;Erigeron&quot; (fleabane) species, &quot;Geranium&quot; species, &quot;Lactuca serriola&quot; (prickly lettuce), &quot;Lupinus&quot; (lupine) species, alfalfa, &quot;Penstemon&quot; species, &quot;Phlox&quot; species, &quot;Polygonum&quot; (knotweed/smartweed) species, &quot;Potentilla&quot; (cinquefoil) species, &quot;Taraxacum officinale&quot; (dandelion), &quot;Tragopogon dubius&quot; (western salsify), clover, and &quot;Vicia americana&quot; (American vetch).
* Among grasses and grasslike species: &quot;Agropyron&quot;, &quot;Elymus&quot; (wheatgrasses), &quot;Pascopyrum&quot; species (wheatgrasses), &quot;Pseudoroegneria spicatum&quot; (bluebunch wheatgrass), &quot;Bromus tectorum&quot; (cheatgrass), &quot;Carex&quot; (sedge) species, &quot;Festuca idahoensis&quot; (Idaho fescue), &quot;Poa fendleriana&quot; (muttongrass), &quot;Poa pratensis&quot; (Kentucky bluegrass), and other &quot;Poa&quot; (bluegrass) species.

Mule deer have also been known to eat ricegrass, gramagrass, and needlegrass, as well as bearberry, bitter cherry, black oak, California buckeye, ceanothus, cedar, cliffrose, cottonwood, creek dogwood, creeping barberry, dogwood, Douglas fir, elderberry, &quot;Fendlera&quot; species, goldeneye, holly-leaf buckthorn, jack pine, knotweed, &quot;Kohleria&quot; species, manzanita, mesquite, pine, rabbitbrush, ragweed, redberry, scrub oak, serviceberry (including Pacific serviceberry), Sierra juniper, silktassel, snowberry, stonecrop, sunflower, tesota, thimbleberry, turbinella oak, velvet elder, western chokecherry, wild cherry, and wild oats. Where available, mule deer also eat a variety of wild mushrooms, which are most abundant in late summer and fall in the southern Rocky Mountains; mushrooms provide moisture, protein, phosphorus, and potassium.

Humans sometimes engage in supplemental feeding efforts in severe winters in an attempt to help mule deer avoid starvation. Wildlife agencies discourage such efforts, which cause harm to mule deer populations by spreading disease (such as tuberculosis and chronic wasting disease) when deer congregate for feed, disrupting migratory patterns, causing overpopulation of local mule deer populations, and causing habitat destruction from overbrowsing of shrubs and forbs. Supplemental feeding efforts might be appropriate when carefully conducted under limited circumstances, but to be successful, the feeding must begin early in the severe winter (before poor range conditions and severe weather cause malnourishment or starvation) and must be continued until range conditions can support the herd.

Mule deer are variably gregarious, with a large proportion of solitary individuals (35 to 64%) and small groups (groups with ≤5 deer, 50 to 78%). Reported mean group size measurements are three to five and typical group size (i.e., crowding) is about seven.

==Nutrition==
Mule deer are ruminants, meaning they employ a nutrient acquisition strategy of fermenting plant material before digesting it. Deer consuming high-fiber, low-starch diets require less food than those consuming high-starch, low-fiber diets. Rumination time also increases when deer consume high-fiber, low-starch diets, which allows for increased nutrient acquisition due to greater length of fermentation. Because some of the subspecies of mule deer are migratory, they encounter variable habitats and forage quality throughout the year. Forages consumed in the summer are higher in digestible components (i.e. proteins, starches, sugars, and hemicellulose) than those consumed in the winter. The average gross energy content of the consumed forage material is 4.5kcal/g.

Due to fluctuations in forage quality and availability, mule deer fat storage varies throughout the year, with the most fat stored in October, which is depleted throughout the winter to the lowest levels of fat storage in March. Changes in hormone levels are indications of physiological adjustments to the changes in the habitat. Total body fat is a measure of the individual&#x27;s energy reserves, while thyroid hormone concentrations are a metric to determine the deer&#x27;s ability to use the fat reserves. Triiodothyronine (T3) hormone is directly involved with basal metabolic rate and thermoregulation.

==Migration==
Mule deer migrate from low elevation winter ranges to high elevation summer ranges. Although not all individuals in populations migrate, some will travel long distances between summer and winter ranges. Researchers discovered the longest mule deer migration in Wyoming spanning 150 miles from winter to summer range Multiple US states track mule deer migrations.

Mule deer migrate in fall to avoid harsh winter conditions like deep snow that covers up food resources, and in spring follow the emergence of new growth northwards. There is evidence to suggest that mule deer migrate based on cognitive memory, meaning they use the same path year after year even if the availability of resources has changed. This contradicts the idea that animals will go to the areas with the best available resources, which makes migratory paths crucial for survival.

=== Risks ===
There are many risks that mule deer face during migration including climate change and human disturbance. Climate change impacts on seasonal growth patterns constitute a risk for migrating mule deer by invalidating historic or learned migration paths.

Human activities such as natural resource extraction, highways, fencing, and urban development all have an impact on mule deer populations and migrations through habitat degradation and fragmentation. Natural gas extraction has been found to have varying negative effects on mule deer behavior and can even cause them to avoid areas they use to migrate. Highways not only cause injury and death to mule deer, but they can also serve as a barrier to migration. As traffic volumes increase, the more mule deer tend to avoid those areas and abandon their typical migration routes. It has also been found that fencing can alter deer behavior, acting as a barrier, and potentially changing mule deer migration patterns. In addition, urban development has replaced mule deer habitat with subdivisions, and human activity has increased. As a result of this, researchers have seen a decline in mule deer populations. This is especially prominent in Colorado where the human population has grown by over 2.2 million since 1980.

=== Management ===

==== Protecting migration corridors ====
Protecting migration corridors is essential to maintain healthy mule deer populations. One thing everyone can do is help slow the increase in climate change by using greener energy sources and reducing the amount of waste in our households. In addition, managers and researchers can assess the risks listed above and take the proper steps to mitigate any adverse impacts those risk have on mule deer populations. Not only will populations benefit from these efforts but so will many other wildlife species.

==== Highways ====
One way to help protect deer from getting hit on roadways is to install high fence wildlife fencing with escape routes. This helps keep deer off the road, preventing vehicle collisions and allowing animals that are trapped between the road and the fence a way to escape to safety. However, to maintain migration routes that cross busy highways, managers have also implemented natural, vegetated, overpasses and underpasses to allow animals, like mule deer, to migrate and move safely across highways.

==== Natural resource extraction ====
Approaches to mitigating the impact of drilling and mining operations include regulating the time of year when active drilling and heavy traffic to sites are taking place, and using well-informed planning to protect critical deer habitat and using barriers to mitigate the activity, noise, light at the extraction sites.

==== Urban development ====
The increase in urbanization has impacted mule deer migrations and there is evidence to show it also disrupts gene flow among mule deer populations. One clear option is to not build houses in critical mule deer habitat; however, build near mule deer habitat has resulted in some deer becoming accustomed to humans and the resources, such as food and water. Rather than migrate through urban areas some deer tend to stay close to those urban developments, potentially for resources and to avoid the obstacles in urban areas. Suggested measures by property owners to protect mule deer genetic diversity and migration paths include planting deer-resistant plants, placing scare devices such as noise-makers, and desisting from feeding deer.

==Disease==
Wildlife officials in Utah announced that a November–December 2021 field study had detected the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in mule deer. Several deer possessed apparent SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, however a female deer in Morgan County had an active Delta variant infection. White-tailed deer, which are able to hybridize with mule deer and which have shown high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, have migrated into Morgan County and other traditional mule deer habitats since at least the early 2000s.

=== Chronic wasting disease ===

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a disease rapidly spreading throughout populations of the Cervus family. It first appeared in captive deer in Colorado in 1967 but has made a large impact on wild mule deer populations since then, spreading throughout all of North America.

<text>Harry Robson Lake (29 September 1911 – 21 February 1967) was a New Zealand politician who served as Minister of Finance for six years in the second National government in the 1960s. He died of a heart attack when only 55 years old.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Lake was born in Christchurch in 1911. Lake was father to two children, and grandfather to three. He attended Riccarton Primary School and Christchurch West District High School. He was further educated at the University of Canterbury, gaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree in commerce. He was then employed for five years at the Vacuum Oil Company before joining a firm of public accountants, in which he later became a partner. He established an accountancy practice in 1943 and then a senior partner in the firm of Lake, Glynn and Smith. He also served a term as chairman of the Christchurch branch of the Society of Accountants.

In 1937 he married Beryl Bonnington with whom he had one son and one daughter. Lake was deemed medically unfit for active service in World War II. Instead he served within New Zealand as a duty officer in the Air Training Corps.

For several years he was an accountancy lecturer at the University of Canterbury. Lake was also a councillor of the Canterbury Manufacturers Association. He was also a member of the Christchurch Drainage Board and was chairman of its finance committee.

===Political career===


After holding a number of roles within the National Party&#x27;s administration, he stood as the party&#x27;s candidate for the Riccarton seat in the 1949 election. Riccarton was regarded as a &quot;safe&quot; Labour Party seat, and Lake was unsuccessful. He was the treasurer of the Canterbury-Westland division of the National Party. In the 1951 election, however, Lake won the seat of Lyttelton, which had been held by Labour for nearly forty years. While Lake held his seat in the 1954 election, he lost it in the 1957 election to Norman Kirk (who later became Prime Minister).

In the 1960 election, which National won, Lake returned to Parliament as the MP for Fendalton (a safe National seat). He was immediately elevated to Cabinet by Prime Minister Keith Holyoake, becoming minister of finance. As Lake possessed no ministerial experience before this point, his immediate appointment to one of the most powerful ministerial posts was remarkable. Undoubtedly the reason for Lake&#x27;s promotion was the fact he was a close friend and political confidante of Holyoake. In recognition of his lack of experience, however, Lake was officially ranked only sixth in Cabinet, a lower position than a minister of finance would normally expect. He was also appointed Minister of Statistics and Minister of Revenue.

Despite holding one of the most powerful political positions in the country, Lake never had a high public profile. In keeping with Holyoake&#x27;s desire to maintain the status quo, Lake&#x27;s tenure as minister of finance was relatively uneventful, with the primary focus being on stability. In 1964, Lake suffered his first heart attack, which reduced his energy somewhat but did not impair his ability to perform his role. In 1965 he had another heart attack, by which time he was also ailing from a kidney impairment.

At the end of 1966, New Zealand encountered economic difficulties as the result of a collapse in export prices due to the end of the wool boom. Ultimately Lake did not have a chance to respond to this problem, however.

===Death===
In February 1967 Lake returned to Christchurch to attend the funeral of his wife&#x27;s uncle, where he suffered a second heart attack, and died. He was survived by his wife and two children.

He was succeeded as minister of finance by Robert Muldoon, and as MP for Fendalton by Eric Holland.

<doc id="651523" wikidata="Q6274216" url="?curid=651523" title="Jonathan Rauch">
<text>Jonathan Charles Rauch ( ; born April 26, 1960) is an American author, journalist, and activist. After graduating from Yale University, Rauch worked at the &quot;Winston-Salem Journal&quot; in North Carolina, for &quot;National Journal&quot;, and later for &quot;The Economist&quot; and as a freelance writer. He is currently a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution and a contributing editor of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.

He is the author of books and articles on public policy, culture, and economics. His books include &quot;The Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better After 50&quot; (2018), &quot;Gay Marriage: Why It Is Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for America&quot; (2004); &quot;Government&#x27;s End: Why Washington Stopped Working&quot; (2000); and &quot;Kindly Inquisitors: The New Attacks on Free Thought&quot; (1993; revised second edition in 2013). In 2015, he published a short ebook, &quot;Political Realism&quot;, arguing that overzealous efforts to clean up politics have hampered the ability of political parties and professionals to order politics and build governing coalitions. In 2021, Rauch released &quot;The Constitution of Knowledge: A Defense of Truth&quot; describing the erosion of epistemic commons, the cost to U.S. democracy, and offering solutions.

==Writings and beliefs==
A critic of U.S. government public policy in general, including its relation to LGBTQ+ people, Rauch has pursued gay-related topics as an openly gay author (he did not realize he was gay until after he finished college) since 1991 when he spoke out against hate crime laws in &quot;The New Republic&quot;. He is an avid proponent of same-sex marriage, which he believes improves the quality of life of both LGBTQ+ people and married heterosexuals. In 2009, Rauch co-authored an op-ed article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that proposed the compromise of nationally recognized civil unions for gay couples, which he did with the goal of &quot;reconciliation&quot; with religious opponents of same-sex marriage.

Peter Wehner, conservative writer and director of the Bush-era Office of Strategic Initiatives, has called Rauch &quot;the most formidable and persuasive voice for same-sex marriage.&quot;

Rauch is also well known for an article he wrote in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in March 2003, entitled &quot;Caring for Your Introvert: The habits and needs of a little-understood group&quot;. In this article, Rauch described his own experiences as an introvert, and how being an introvert has affected his own life. For many introverts, his piece became a long sought after explanation of their own personality traits. For a period of years, Rauch&#x27;s original article drew more traffic to &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; site than any other article.

In terms of political philosophy, Rauch has referred to himself as &quot;an admirer of James Madison and Edmund Burke&quot; and a &quot;radical incrementalist,&quot; meaning one who favors &quot;revolutionary change on a geological time scale.&quot; He has also summarized Burke&#x27;s views, and his views, in that &quot;utopianism and perfectionism, however well intended, should never displace reasonable caution in making social policy... It&#x27;s much easier to damage society... than to repair it.&quot;

He has in the past described himself as &quot;an unrepentantly atheistic Jewish homosexual&quot;. He defines his view as apatheism, in which he respects other people&#x27;s choices of religiosity or absence of religion without making a big deal of them. He contrasts this with American atheists who seek to evangelize and convert people away from religion, actions that he is critical of.

In political science and economics, Rauch is known for coining and promoting the term &quot;demosclerosis&quot; as &quot;government&#x27;s progressive loss of the ability to adapt&quot;—a process in which specific benefits, going to special interests, bill the common taxpayer, which uses the medical term sclerosis to apply to government drift. He is a critic of communism, calling it &quot;the deadliest fantasy in human history&quot;.

<text>Harvey Herschel Korman (February 15, 1927May 29, 2008) was an American actor and comedian who performed in television and film productions. He is best remembered as a main cast member alongside Carol Burnett, Tim Conway and Vicki Lawrence on the CBS sketch comedy series &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; (1967–1977) for which he won four Primetime Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award. 

His early roles were on &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot; and &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. Korman briefly starred in his own sitcom &quot;The Harvey Korman Show&quot; (1980) and continued to work with his &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; cast mates in projects such as &quot;The Tim Conway Show&quot; (1980), and &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; (1983–1984). He starred in several comedy films by Mel Brooks including &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974), &quot;High Anxiety&quot; (1977), and &quot;History of the World, Part 1&quot; (1981). His other notable films include &quot;Herbie Goes Bananas&quot; (1980), &quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot; (1982), and &quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot; (1983).

Korman is known for his voice work, taking on roles such as The Great Gazoo in &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (1965–1966). He is also known for voice roles in &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;, &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;, &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;, and &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Korman was born in Chicago, of Russian Jewish descent, the son of Ellen (née Blecher) and Cyril Raymond Korman, a salesman. He served in the United States Navy during World War II. After being discharged, he studied at the Goodman School of Drama at the Art Institute of Chicago (now at DePaul University) and at HB Studio. He was a member of the Peninsula Players summer theatre program during the 1950, 1957, and 1958 seasons.

==Career==

===1959–1966: Early years===
Korman&#x27;s first television role was as a head waiter in &quot;Decisions, Decisions, Decisions&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;. He appeared as a comically exasperated public relations man in a January 1961 episode of the CBS drama &quot;Route 66&quot;. He was seen on numerous television programs afterwards including the role of Blake in the 1964 episode &quot;Who Chopped Down the Cherry Tree?&quot; on the NBC medical drama &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; and a bartender in the 1962 &quot;Perry Mason&quot; episode, &quot;The Case of the Unsuitable Uncle&quot;. He frequently appeared as a supporting player in &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot; from 1963 through 1967. He was cast three times, including the role of Dr. Allison in &quot;Who Needs Glasses?&quot; (1962), in ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;. He also guest-starred in &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; and in the NBC contemporary western series &quot;Empire&quot;.

From 1964 to 1966, he appeared three times in consecutive years in the CBS comedy &quot;The Munsters&quot; starring Fred Gwynne and Yvonne De Carlo. During the 1965–1966 season, Korman appeared regularly on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Flintstones&quot; as the voice of The Great Gazoo in its final season on network television.

===1967–1977: &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;===

The 1967 debut of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; gave Korman his greatest recognition. Korman starred alongside Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, and Tim Conway. During his ten-year run on the show, he received six Primetime Emmy Award nominations and won four, in 1969, 1971, 1972, and 1974. The exact name of the category changed slightly during the period, but the award was for &quot;Outstanding Achievement by a Supporting Performer in Music or Variety show&quot;. He was also nominated for four Golden Globes for the series, winning that award in 1975. In 1977, he left &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; to headline his own sitcom on ABC, &quot;The Harvey Korman Show&quot;, which lasted only five episodes.

While appearing on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, Korman gained further fame by appearing as the villainous Hedley Lamarr in the 1974 Mel Brooks film &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; starring Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, and Madeline Kahn. Ron Pennington of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised his performance writing, &quot;The performances are all comedy gems, with Korman especially delightful as Hedley Lamarr, scheming and plotting with all the finesse of a precocious brat&quot;. He also starred in Brooks&#x27; &quot;High Anxiety&quot; (1977) as Dr. Charles Montague.

===1978–2006===
In 1978, he appeared in the CBS &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; providing levity in three of the special&#x27;s variety segments: a cantina skit with Bea Arthur in which he plays a barfly who drinks through a hole in the top of his head, another as Chef Gormaanda, a four-armed parody of Julia Child, and one as a malfunctioning Amorphian android in an instruction video. In 1980, he played Captain Blythe in the Disney comedy, &quot;Herbie Goes Bananas&quot;. The following year, he portrayed Count de Monet in Brooks&#x27; &quot;History of the World, Part 1&quot;. In later years, he did voice work for the live-action film &quot;The Flintstones&quot; as well as for the animated &quot;The Secret of NIMH 2: Timmy to the Rescue&quot;. He also starred in the short-lived Mel Brooks TV series &quot;The Nutt House&quot;, and in his final Mel Brooks film, as the zany Dr. Seward, in &quot;&quot;. In 1986, he starred in the failed CBS comedy series &quot;Leo &amp; Liz in Beverly Hills&quot; with Valerie Perrine.

In 1982, he reunited with Carol Burnett and Vicki Lawrence in the TV movie &quot;Eunice&quot; reprising his role of Ed Higgins from “The Family” sketches from &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. He continued the portrayal on the spin-off series, &quot;Mama’s Family&quot; in addition to introducing each episode of the series during its initial two-season NBC network run, portraying fictional television host Alistair Quince as well as directing 31 episodes of the series.

He also reunited with fellow &quot;Carol Burnett Show&quot; alumnus Tim Conway, making a guest appearance on Conway″s 1980–1981 comedy-variety series &quot;The Tim Conway Show&quot;. The two later toured the U.S., reprising skits from the show and performing new material. A DVD of new comedy sketches by Korman and Conway, &quot;Together Again&quot;, was released in 2006. Korman and Conway had been jointly inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 2002.

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
Korman was married to Donna Ehlert from 1960 to 1977 and they had two children, Maria and Christopher Korman. He married Deborah Korman (née Fritz) in 1982 and was married to her until he died in 2008. They had two daughters together, Kate and Laura Korman.

===Death===
Korman died at age 81 on May 29, 2008, at UCLA Medical Center as the result of complications from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm he had suffered four months earlier. He is interred at Santa Monica&#x27;s Woodlawn Cemetery.

It began as essentially two separate projects that were in development in conjunction with each other: A proposed action adventure sequel to &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; that began development within Nintendo EAD at Kyoto, and &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot;, an original property created by Rare that was in development since 1997. Nintendo producer Shigeru Miyamoto convinced Rare to merge the two projects, and also shift development forward one hardware generation to the GameCube, leaving the game’s initial planned release on the Nintendo 64 cancelled.

The game was released on September 23, 2002 as Rare&#x27;s only GameCube game and as the final game that Rare developed for a Nintendo home console before being acquired by Microsoft the day after &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; was released in the United States. The game&#x27;s story takes place eight years after the events of &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;. Players take control of Fox McCloud, who is sent on a mission to visit a planet in the Lylat System and prevent its destruction.

&quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews, notably for its detailed graphics, new designs of characters including Fox, and its dynamic environments. However, the voice acting and the departure from the traditional &quot;Star Fox&quot;-style gameplay received some criticism.

==Gameplay==

The game is played from a third-person perspective with full camera control in most areas and the ability to use a first-person perspective for looking around a location, with the players able to use a widescreen mode, provided that their console is hooked up to a television set that has widescreen capabilities. The game&#x27;s story focuses on two different styles of gameplay which the player switches between at various points.

The first style of gameplay is Adventure Mode, which is the main mode, and operates in a similar manner to that of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series, especially &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;. In this mode, players control the game&#x27;s protagonist as they explore thirteen different locations on foot, each of which unlocks when the player completes a specific task or acquires a new requisite skill, in order to progress the story. Some of the gameplay mechanics are similar in fashion to those in the &quot;Zelda&quot; games: &quot;Adventures&quot; has a form of currency called Scarabs, that can be used to purchase healing items, new equipment, and maps of the various locations; the main character&#x27;s health is divided into hearts consisting of four segments and vaguely resembling fox heads, with the player beginning with three hearts and earning a new one after completing key stages of the story; the character can climb ladders and ledges, swim, and jump between platforms, but cannot freely jump themselves; some areas require the player to solve a puzzle to acquire something or move on; and the game features a day-and-night phase, though this is more gradual than in &quot;Zelda&quot; games.

The main character comes equipped with a staff after the initial stages of the game, which functions as both a weapon, and a tool for exploration and puzzle-solving. Combat is mainly melee-orientated, with players locking-on to an enemy upon moving in close. Once in combat, an enemy&#x27;s health is displayed as a heart icon above them, with players able to strafe and roll around a target to dodge attacks, while using the staff to either block incoming strikes, or attack an enemy. As a tool, the staff can be used to open containers, operate mechanisms, or lift up stones to uncover hidden caves and boulders to find items. As the player progress in the story, the staff can be upgraded with powers that can help in combat or assist in solving puzzles and exploring locations, including the ability to fire projectiles at enemies or trigger switches, and a special jump ability to reach places that are inaccessible through normal methods. However, using such powers requires magical energy, which the player can recover by retrieving special crystals from the environment. Along with the staff, the player also has a sidekick that joins them after a certain stage of the story, who can help by finding them items and using certain abilities to open up new areas. Such abilities, referred to as tricks, require the player to feed them with special mushrooms, with each one constituting one trick that can be performed, with the sidekick able to perform a maximum of six tricks when fully fed before needing more mushrooms. The game&#x27;s inventory system focuses on three areas - collectibles, staff powers, and Tricky abilities - with the player able to use three scanner systems in the game - a mini-map of a region (provided a map has been purchased first), a scanner to give information on objects in that are approached, and a fuel cell radar.

The second style of gameplay is Arwing Mode, and functions in a similar manner to other games in the &quot;Star Fox&quot; series. In this mode, the player decides where on Dinosaur Planet they wish to go; at the beginning of the game, the planet itself, the game&#x27;s overworld, is only accessible, but upon unlocking a planet segment during the Adventure Mode, the player gains access to travelling there via Arwing. Upon choosing a destination, the player engages in an on-rail segment, in which players dodge obstacles while shooting down enemies, with the ability to fly through silver rings to recover some health, and being able to use super-bombs to eliminate groups of enemies. In order to visit a place, the player must fly through a set number of gold rings; each segment has around 10 gold rings, and the player will need to fly through more to reach later areas, or be forced to repeat the segment. In addition, the player must also acquire a certain amount of fuel cells during Adventure Mode, before they can use the Arwing to travel somewhere. Once they reached the area once, Fuel Cells are not consumed to travel to the place again.

==Story==
===Characters and settings===

&quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; features both the established main characters of the &quot;Star Fox&quot; series—Fox McCloud, Falco Lombardi, Slippy Toad and Peppy Hare (though Falco is absent for the majority of the game), as well as a host of new characters, including a mysterious blue fox named Krystal and the small dinosaur Prince Tricky. The entire planet is populated with dinosaurs, like the tyrannical General Scales, and other prehistoric animals such as pterosaurs and mammoths.

The entire game takes place on the world of Dinosaur Planet (known as &quot;Sauria&quot; in subsequent games) and a number of detached pieces of the planet that are suspended in orbit around it. Dinosaur Planet is ruled by the EarthWalker tribe, resembling ceratopsians, and the rival CloudRunner tribe, similar to pterosaurs and birds. The SharpClaw tribe are villainous humanoid theropods. Andross also appears as the final boss.

===Synopsis===
Eight years after Fox McCloud defeat Andross, Krystal investigates the destruction of her home planet, Cerinia, and the death of her parents. Receiving a distress call from Krazoa Palace, Krystal discovers that it was attacked by General Scales and the SharpClaw army. Krystal is persuaded by a wounded EarthWalker in the Palace to collect the Krazoa Spirits and return them to the palace, which would supposedly tilt the war in the dinosaurs&#x27; favour and stop Scales. After releasing the first one, however, a mysterious being sends Krystal into the spirit&#x27;s path, trapping her in a floating crystal atop the palace until all the spirits can be returned.

Meanwhile, on the edge of the Lylat System, General Pepper contacts the Star Fox Team, asking them to investigate the invasion of the Dinosaur Planet. Since the team are desperate for money and maintenance, the team leader Fox McCloud agrees to take a look, arriving unarmed at Pepper&#x27;s request to avoid trouble with the locals. On the planet&#x27;s surface, Fox obtains and wields the magic staff which Krystal lost earlier. Fox learns from the Queen of the EarthWalker Tribe that Scales stole four Spellstones from the planet&#x27;s two Force Point Temples. Resolving to prevent the planet from breaking up further and restore it to its original unity, Fox traverses the planet and retrieves the stones to the temples, with the help of the Queen&#x27;s son, Prince Tricky. As Fox retrieves the stones, he discovers that he must also retrieve the other five Krazoa Spirits to repair the planet and save Krystal. When Fox finds the last spirit, he discovers that it is guarded by Scales himself. However, just as Fox and Scales engage in combat, a mysterious voice orders Scales to surrender the spirit, to which he reluctantly agrees. Fox takes the spirit to the Krazoa Shrine and frees Krystal.

The spirits are forced into the head of a Krazoa statue, which reveals itself to be the resurrected Andross, the mastermind behind the spirit scheme, who flies off to resume his conquest of destroy the Lylat System. When Falco Lombardi arrives in space, he helps Fox destroy Andross once again, restoring and repairing the Krazoa spirits to the planet. Afterwards, Falco rejoins the Star Fox team and Krystal is recruited into the team, beginning a romance with her and Fox.

==Development==

&quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; had its origins in two separate projects, one of these being &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot;, a Nintendo 64 game unrelated to the &quot;Star Fox&quot; series. According to lead engineer Phil Tossell, development of &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; began after the release of &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; (1997), with two teams to work on &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; and &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; toward the end of the Nintendo 64&#x27;s lifespan. The game was changed many times during early development before Rare settled on the eventual idea of an open world adventure-game based around two interwoven stories. According to Kevin Bayliss, a lead developer for the game for Rare, &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; was originally to feature Timber, the tiger character from &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;, as that game was originally planned to be &quot;RC Pro-Am 64&quot; and featuring Timber until Nintendo suggested them to work it into the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; intellectual property. They set Timber as a time-traveler into a prehistoric world in gameplay similar to &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;. As they developed the game, they found it better to shift the main character to two separate ones, Sabre the wolf and Krystal the fox, forgoing Timber&#x27;s appearance. Eventually, the plot for &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; concerned Sabre and Krystal, along with sidekicks Tricky and Kyte (who both appear in the finished game), and Randorn, a wizard who was Sabre&#x27;s father and Krystal&#x27;s adoptive father (who was dropped entirely). The game featured elements such as the &#x27;SwapStone&#x27;, which would let the player switch between Krystal and Sabre. &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; was intended to be Rare&#x27;s last game for the Nintendo 64 and was adorned with gameplay and cinematics introduced by &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;. &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; initially utilised the Nintendo 64&#x27;s Expansion Pak and was housed in a 512-megabit (64 megabyte) cartridge, which is the largest size the console would have.

In the meantime, at Nintendo&#x27;s headquarters in Kyoto, &quot;Star Fox&quot; creator Takaya Imamura, feeling attachment to the series, had requested Nintendo producer Shigeru Miyamoto to let him produce a sequel; he obliged, but requested the game to instead be an action adventure title, forgoing the series&#x27; usual 3D rail shooter gameplay. Imamura, as well as programmer Kazuaki Morita, began experimenting with various ideas for what was to be called &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot;, such as having Fox run around on-foot and shooting down enemies with a gun. However, the project wasn&#x27;t making much progress due to it being a late stage N64 title and much of the staff being pulled away to work on bigger projects such as Mario and The Legend of Zelda for the then-coming Nintendo GameCube.

Bayliss said that Rare developed &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; in earnest, including preparation of a large E3 2000 demonstration, without considering that Nintendo already had the &quot;Star Fox&quot; property. The Dinosaur Planet demo caught Miyamoto&#x27;s attention, noticing the similarities of Rare&#x27;s anthropomorphic design of Sabre to Nintendo&#x27;s Fox McCloud design were striking. Just prior to E3 2000, Nintendo asked Rare to keep discussion of &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; quiet and arranged a meeting with Rare to see about a &quot;marriage&quot; of &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; and their &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; concept during the event. The two agreed to the idea of &quot;Star Fox Adventures: Dinosaur Planet&quot; as a Nintendo 64 game, maintaining as much of Rare&#x27;s work. Bayliss, Tossel, and Lee Schuneman later met with Nintendo in Japan in the weeks that followed to further discuss how to merge the properties, such as bringing Fox McCloud and the other &quot;Star Fox&quot; characters into the game, adjusting the art style of the other characters of &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; to match, and developing a story to fit into the &quot;Star Fox&quot; canon.

In February 2021, a late development version of &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; for the Nintendo 64 dated December 2000 was leaked online, having been acquired from a collector in Sweden. The build features a unique model for Fox instead of Sabre, indicating that Miyamoto&#x27;s intervention happened before the decision was made to transition the game to GameCube.


The team later realised the potential of using the &quot;Star Fox&quot; licence in hopes of boosting awareness, and switch development from the Nintendo 64 to the then-upcoming GameCube console as a launch game. Sabre was dropped in favor of Fox McCloud as the lead, but the game retains certain original &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; characters such as Krystal and Tricky. Rare staff had originally considered removing Krystal in the transition from &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot;, but Nintendo, specifically Takaya Imamura, who had been brought on as a supervisor and producer for the project, requested for her to remain in the game, feeling it&#x27;d be a waste to scrap her and even assisted illustrating her final design during his visits at Rare, which was much more sexualized and revealing than the original &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; appearance. According to Imamura, he and Miyamoto were looking to add &quot;sex appeal&quot; to the &quot;Star Fox&quot; franchise, as Miyamoto wanted the series to have mature elements where possible, and that Krystal&#x27;s new design was inspired by Vampirella, a comic book character known for wearing risqué outfits. Despite this, no video game content rating systems reported any significant sexual content in the final product. The &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; was dropped from the proposed name. Of all games converted away from Nintendo 64 in its late market span, IGN called this possibly the biggest departure, having expected it to be one of the platform&#x27;s killer apps, and side-by-side comparing its &quot;amazing graphical upgrades&quot; on GameCube.

With the &quot;Star Fox&quot; theme established, Rare begun re-working the game for the then-upcoming GameCube and was subsequently met with little interference from Nintendo. During development, the team was invited to Nintendo&#x27;s headquarters in Kyoto to discuss progress and certain changes; in return Imamura came to stay at Rare&#x27;s Twycross studio to oversee development. Tossell stated that &quot;without a doubt&quot;, Nintendo strengthened their relationship through trust and respect, though Nintendo only had a 49% stake of the company at the time.

David Wise used Peter Siedleczek&#x27;s Advanced Orchestra library in creating the music for &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot;. Wise said the tracks that reference the music for the previous &quot;Star Fox&quot; games came very late in development, after having converted it into &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot;.

&quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; is the only Rare game released for the GameCube. Shortly after its release, Microsoft purchased Rare for £375 million, ending most of Rare&#x27;s association with Nintendo. Rare continued developing games for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS after the acquisition.

==Reception==

&quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. It sold over 200,000 copies in Japan following its release, and was the fastest-selling GameCube game at the time. By July 2006, it had sold 800,000 copies and earned $30 million (~$ in ) in the United States. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 73rd highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of &quot;Star Fox&quot; games released during the 2000s reached 1.2 million units in the United States by July 2006. &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; was eventually designated a Player&#x27;s Choice game by Nintendo, signifying over 250,000 copies sold, and was thus available at a reduced retail price.

The visuals were highly praised, particularly for Fox&#x27;s character model redesign. &quot;Edge&quot; wrote that the &quot;visual splendour is immense&quot;, whilst in a similar fashion Matt Casamassina of &quot;IGN&quot; noted that the game is a &quot;perfect companion&quot; to &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series, to which &quot;Adventures&quot; is often compared. Casamassina noted that elements of its graphical rendering were sophisticated for its time, in particular the advanced real-time rendering of the movement of the characters&#x27; fur. &quot;NGC Magazine&quot; praised the game&#x27;s vibrant atmosphere and detailed textures. The game&#x27;s combat system garnered some accolades, with &quot;GameSpot&quot; adding that the combat is simplistic, though being &quot;good looking&quot; and not frustrating. Casamassina also praised the combat system. &quot;NGC Magazine&quot; similarly praised the use of the combat system, but they noted that the battles did not require any skill and eventually &quot;felt like a dull chore&quot;. The voice acting was viewed negatively, with Casamassina remarking that it is &quot;over the top&quot; in some places. &quot;NGC Magazine&quot; said that the accents of most of the characters did not suit that of the &quot;Star Fox&quot; world, in particular they noted the use of a Scottish accent for the Warpstone Master was &quot;awful&quot;.

Though mostly positively reviewed, &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; is often criticised for its gameplay and setting being too much of a departure from the other &quot;Star Fox&quot; games, in favor of the &quot;Zelda-style&quot; gameplay. Casamassina said that &quot;fans expecting a true &quot;Star Fox&quot; experience akin to the older games are in for a disappointment&quot;. He also added that the &quot;Star Fox&quot; license has been utilised sparingly to the point where the game felt &quot;out of place within the confines of the &quot;Star Fox&quot; game universe&quot;. Casamassina asserted that Fox was &quot;clearly only on &#x27;Dinosaur Planet&#x27; at Nintendo&#x27;s request, not because he belongs&quot;. &quot;NGC Magazine&quot; similarly expressed concern on why Fox was added to the game, adding that &quot;Adventures&quot; was &quot;one game Fox himself would probably want to forget&quot; and further speculating that Nintendo only added the &quot;Star Fox&quot; license to prevent &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; from appearing on the Xbox.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; the second-best GameCube game of September 2002. It was nominated for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Action Adventure Game&quot;, &quot;Best Music&quot;, &quot;Best Graphics (Technical)&quot; and &quot;Best Graphics (Artistic)&quot; awards among GameCube games.

<text>Dracula is a 1958 British gothic horror film directed by Terence Fisher and written by Jimmy Sangster based on Bram Stoker&#x27;s 1897 novel of the same name. The first in the series of Hammer Horror films starring Christopher Lee as Count Dracula, the film also features Peter Cushing as Doctor Van Helsing, along with Michael Gough, Melissa Stribling, Carol Marsh, and John Van Eyssen. In the United States, the film was retitled Horror of Dracula to avoid confusion with the U.S. original by Universal Pictures, 1931&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;.

Production began at Bray Studios on 17 November 1957 with an investment of £81,000. As Count Dracula, Lee fixed the image of the fanged vampire in popular culture. Christopher Frayling writes, &quot;&quot;Dracula&quot; introduced fangs, red contact lenses, décolletage, ready-prepared wooden stakes and – in the celebrated credits sequence – blood being spattered from off-screen over the Count&#x27;s coffin.&quot; Lee also introduced a dark, brooding sexuality to the character, with Tim Stanley stating, &quot;Lee&#x27;s sensuality was subversive in that it hinted that women might quite like having their neck chewed on by a stud.&quot;

In 2017, a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine saw &quot;Dracula&quot; ranked the 65th best British film ever. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked Lee&#x27;s portrayal as Count Dracula the 7th Greatest Horror Movie Character of All Time.

==Plot==

In 1885, Jonathan Harker arrives at Count Dracula&#x27;s castle near Klausenburg to take up his post as librarian. Inside, he is startled by a young woman who claims to be a prisoner and begs for his help. Dracula arrives, greets Harker, and guides him to his room. Alone, Jonathan writes in his diary, revealing his true intentions: he is a vampire hunter and has come to flush out Dracula.

Sometime later, Harker again is confronted by the woman. She reveals herself to be a vampire and bites his neck. Dracula arrives and pulls her away as Harker passes out. After awakening in his room in daylight, Harker discovers the bite marks on his neck. He realizes he has lost nearly an entire period of daylight. Harker writes a final entry in his journal and hides the book outside the castle. He descends into a crypt to find Dracula and the vampire woman resting in their coffins. Harker first stakes the woman, who withers to old age and dies. He then turns to Dracula&#x27;s coffin and finds it empty. Dracula, awakened and angry, closes the door to the crypt, trapping Harker.

Days pass, and Doctor Van Helsing arrives in Klausenburg, looking for Harker. An innkeeper&#x27;s daughter gives him Harker&#x27;s journal. He travels to Dracula&#x27;s castle and finds it deserted, but comes across the portrait that Harker had of his fiancée Lucy Holmwood, with the photos now gone. He finds Harker in Dracula&#x27;s coffin in the crypt, transformed into a vampire. Van Helsing stakes him before leaving for the town of Karlstadt and delivering the news of Harker&#x27;s death to Arthur Holmwood and his wife Mina, brother and sister-in-law of Lucy, who is ill. When night falls, Lucy opens the doors to her terrace and lays bare her neck—already, it bears the mark of a vampire bite. Dracula then arrives and bites her again.

Mina seeks out Van Helsing&#x27;s aid in treating Lucy, who begs the maid Gerda to remove his prescribed garlic bouquets and is found dead the next day. Van Helsing turns over Harker&#x27;s journal to Arthur. Three days after her burial, an undead Lucy lures Gerda&#x27;s daughter Tania to a graveyard, where Arthur has found Lucy&#x27;s tomb empty. Van Helsing appears and wards Lucy off with a cross. He explains to Arthur that Lucy was targeted to replace the woman Harker killed. Van Helsing suggests using her to lead them to Dracula, but Arthur refuses, and Van Helsing stakes her in her coffin. Arthur takes one final look at Lucy&#x27;s body and sees her at peace.

Van Helsing and Arthur travel to the border crossing at Ingolstadt to track down Dracula&#x27;s coffin. Meanwhile, Mina receives a message supposedly from Arthur, telling her to go to Karlstadt, where Dracula waits. The next day, Arthur and Van Helsing visit the undertaker but find Dracula&#x27;s coffin missing. Later, Arthur tries to give Mina a cross to wear, which burns her, revealing that she is turning into a vampire herself. During the night, Dracula appears inside the house and bites her. Arthur agrees to give her a blood transfusion administered by Van Helsing. When Arthur asks Gerda to fetch some wine, she tells him Mina forbade her to go down to the cellar. Upon hearing this, Van Helsing bolts downstairs and finds Dracula&#x27;s coffin, which is empty. Dracula has escaped with Mina, intent on making her his new vampire bride.

A chase ensues as Dracula rushes to return to his castle before sunrise. He attempts to bury Mina alive outside the crypt but is interrupted by Van Helsing and Arthur. Pursuing Dracula inside the castle, Van Helsing struggles with the vampire before eventually tearing down the curtains to let in the sunlight. Van Helsing forms a cross with two candlesticks, driving Dracula into the sun&#x27;s rays, and he crumbles into dust as Van Helsing looks on. Mina recovers and the cross-shaped scar fades from her hand while Dracula&#x27;s ashes blow away in the morning breeze, leaving only his clothes and ring behind.

===Concept===
As Christopher Lee remarked in an interview in Leonard Wolf&#x27;s &quot;A Dream of Dracula&quot;: &quot;I was always against the whole tie and tails rendition. Surely it is the height of the ridiculous for a vampire to step out of the shadows wearing white tie, tails, patent leather shoes and a full cloak&quot;. Lee said that he never watched any other performances of Dracula until well after making his films, and that when he got the first [Dracula] role with little time to prepare he &quot;had to hurry off to read the book...[and] played it fresh, with no knowledge of previous performances.&quot;

In the same interview, Lee said the following about Dracula: &quot;He had also to have an erotic element about him (and not because he sank his teeth into women)... It&#x27;s a mysterious matter and has something to do with the physical appeal of the person who&#x27;s draining your life. It&#x27;s like being a sexual blood donor... Women are attracted to men for any of hundreds of reasons. One of them is a response to the demand to give oneself, and what greater evidence of giving is there than your blood flowing literally from your own bloodstream? It&#x27;s the complete abandonment of a woman to the power of a man.&quot;

Lee believed he had discovered something in the character that hadn&#x27;t been done before: &quot;And also because I had read the book and I had perhaps discovered something in the character which other people hadn&#x27;t or hadn&#x27;t noticed or hadn&#x27;t decided to present, and that is that the character is heroic, erotic and romantic.&quot; He also saw a certain tragedy in Dracula and tried to inject it into playing him: &quot;I&#x27;ve always tried to put an element of sadness, which I&#x27;ve termed the loneliness of evil, into his character. Dracula doesn&#x27;t want to live, but he&#x27;s got to! He doesn&#x27;t want to go on existing as the undead, but he has no choice.&quot;

Lee also felt that it was important to stay faithful to Stoker&#x27;s novel and was frustrated with his Hammer Dracula films: &quot;The stories as I&#x27;ve had them given to me have had almost no relation to the book...which is my reiterated complaint.&quot; &quot;My one great regret has always been that I have never been able to present the Count exactly as Bram Stoker described him in every way. This was always due to poor scripts and a lack of imagination on the part of people who never seemed to understand the full potential of the story.&quot;

===Filming===
When Hammer asked for an adaptation of Stoker&#x27;s novel, screenwriter Jimmy Sangster decided to streamline it to fit it into less than ninety minutes of screen time, and shooting on a low budget within the confines of Bray Studios and its surrounding estate. Working under these limitations, Sangster posited that Jonathan Harker travels to Dracula&#x27;s castle intending to destroy Dracula (not to complete a real estate transaction, as in the novel) and gets killed, made Arthur Holmwood into Mina&#x27;s husband and Lucy into Harker&#x27;s fiancée and Arthur&#x27;s sister. The characters Renfield and Quincey Morris were dropped completely. The subplot of the harrowing voyage of the ship that carries Dracula and his coffins to England was also abandoned and is replaced in the film by a short hearse ride because all of the action takes place in a relatively small area of Central Europe. The character of Van Helsing also differed from the figure in the original novel. Cushing explained the transformation: &quot;&quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot; became this enormous success, and there I was when I was a younger man, and audiences got used to me looking like that. And I said, &#x27;Now look here, what do we do with Van Helsing? I mean, do you cast a little old man with a beard who speaks Double Dutch or me? It&#x27;s silly to make me up like that. Why don&#x27;t you get someone who looks like him?&#x27; So we all decided, well, let&#x27;s forget that and play him as I am, as I was then.&quot;

Dracula&#x27;s ability to transform [into wolf, bat or mist] was dropped for the sake of realism - according to Sangster: &quot;I thought that the idea of being able to change into a bat or a wolf or anything like that made the film seem more like a fairy tale than it needed to be. I tried to ground the script to some extent to reality.&quot;

Terence Fisher believed: &quot;My greatest contribution to the Dracula myth was to bring out the underlying sexual element in the story. He [Dracula] is basically sexual. At the moment he bites it is the culmination of a sexual experience.&quot; According to Fisher “Dracula preyed upon the sexual frustrations of his woman victims. The (Holmwood) marriage was one in which she [Mina] was not sexually satisfied and that was her weakness as far as Dracula’s approach to her was concerned.” In the scene where Mina returns after a night with Dracula, Fisher&#x27;s directions to the actress were frank and unambiguous: &quot;When she arrived back after having been away all night she said it all in one close-up at the door. She&#x27;d been done the whole night through, please! I remember Melissa [Stribling] saying &#x27;Terry, how should I play the scene?&#x27; So I told her, &#x27;Listen, you should imagine you have had one whale of a sexual night, the one of your whole sexual experience. Give me that in your face!&#x27;&quot;

According to producer Anthony Hinds when it came to casting Dracula &quot;it never occurred to any of us to use anyone else but Chris Lee&quot;. For his role in &quot;Horror of Dracula&quot; Lee earned £750. Speaking of filming and doing his take on the character, Lee recalled that he &quot;tried to make the character all that he was in the book—heroic, romantic, erotic, fascinating, and dynamic.&quot;

Shooting began at Bray Studios on 11 November 1957. Principal photography came to an end on Christmas Eve 1957. Special effects work continued, with the film finally wrapping on 3 January 1958.

==Release==

The film received its world premiere in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the United States on May 7, 1958 as &quot;Horror of Dracula&quot;. It played as a double feature with the Universal-International film &quot;The Thing That Couldn&#x27;t Die&quot;. The film opened at the Gaumont Haymarket in London on 21 May 1958.

===Critical reception===

&quot;Dracula&quot; was well received by critics and fans of Stoker&#x27;s works. The trade journal reviews from 1958 were very positive. &quot;Film Bulletin&quot; noted, &quot;As produced by Anthony Hinds in somber mid-Victorian backgrounds... and directed by Terence Fisher with an immense flair for the blood-curdling shot, this Technicolor nightmare should prove a real treat. The James Bernard score is monumentally sinister and the Jack Asher photography full of foreboding atmosphere.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called Peter Cushing&#x27;s performance impressive and wrote that the &quot;serious approach to the macabre theme...adds up to lotsa tension and suspense.&quot;

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; was particularly enthusiastic: &quot;Of all the &#x27;Dracula&#x27; horror pictures thus far produced, this one, made in Britain and photographed in Technicolor, tops them all. Its shock impact is, in fact, so great that it may well be considered as one of the best horror films ever made. What makes this picture superior is the expert treatment that takes full advantage of the story&#x27;s shock values.&quot;

Vincent Canby in &quot;Motion Picture Daily&quot; said, &quot;Hammer Films, the same British production unit which last year restored Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; to its rightful place in the screen&#x27;s chamber of horrors, has now even more successfully brought back the granddaddy of all vampires, Count Dracula. It&#x27;s chillingly realistic in detail (and at times as gory as the law allows). The physical production is first rate, including the settings, costumes, Eastman Color photography and special effects.&quot;.

The film holds an approval rating of 89% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;Trading gore for grandeur, &quot;Horror of Dracula&quot; marks an impressive turn for inveterate Christopher Lee as the titular vampire, and a typical Hammer mood that makes aristocracy quite sexy.&quot;

===Box office===
The film earned around $3.5 million in theatrical rentals worldwide. It had a record ten-day run in Milwaukee in its premiere engagement. It was one of the twelve most popular films at the British box office in 1958. It earned rentals in North America of $1 million.

===Home media===
The film made its first appearance on DVD in 2002 in a U.S. stand-alone disc and was later re-released on 6 November 2007 in a film pack retitled as &quot;Horror of Dracula&quot; along with &quot;Dracula Has Risen from the Grave&quot;, &quot;Taste the Blood of Dracula&quot;, and &quot;Dracula A.D. 1972&quot;; which was part of Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema&#x27;s &quot;4 Film Favorites&quot; line of DVDs. On 7 September 2010, Turner Classic Movies released the film in a four-pack along with &quot;Dracula Has Risen from the Grave&quot;, &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed&quot;. The film was released on DVD in the U.K. in October 2002 alongside &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;The Mummy&quot; in a box-set entitled &quot;Hammer Horror Originals&quot;.

The film was digitally restored and re-released in the U.K. by the BFI in 2007. When the film was originally released in the U.K., the BBFC gave it an X rating, being cut, while the 2007 uncut re-release was given a 12A.

For many years, historians pointed to the fact that an even longer, more explicit, version of the film played in Japanese and European cinemas in 1958. Efforts to locate the legendary &quot;Japanese version&quot; of &quot;Dracula&quot; had been fruitless.

In September 2011, Hammer announced that part of the Japanese release had been found by writer and cartoonist Simon Rowson in the National Film Center at the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo. The first five reels of the film held by the center were destroyed in a fire in 1984, but the last four reels were recovered. The recovered reels include the last 36 minutes of the film and includes two extended scenes, one of which is the discovery of a nearly-complete version of the film&#x27;s iconic disintegration scene. Some experts rightly note that there is still footage missing from the disintegration scene, as evidenced by stills and the memories of those who had seen the sequence decades before. The announcement mentioned a HD telecine transfer of all four reels with a view for a future U.K. release.

On 29 December 2012, Hammer announced that the restored film would be released on a three-disc Blu-ray Disc set in the U.K. on 18 March 2013. This release contains the 2007 BFI restoration, along with the 2012 high-definition Hammer restoration, which includes footage which was previously believed to be lost. The set contains both Blu-ray Disc and DVD copies of the film, as well as several bonus documentaries covering the film&#x27;s production, censorship and restoration processes.

The film was further digitally restored by the current domestic rights holder, Warner Bros. Pictures, in association with the BFI, for release in December 2018 on DVD and Blu-ray by the Warner Archive Collection. This version is different from 2002 and 2007 U.S. DVD releases, as the original Universal-International name and logo are restored and the opening credits bear the original &quot;Dracula&quot; title rather than &quot;Horror of Dracula&quot;. It also does not contain any of the additional footage that Hammer previously restored.

<doc id="651555" wikidata="Q388202" url="?curid=651555" title="African diaspora religions">
<text>African diaspora religions, also described as Afro-American religions, are a number of related beliefs that developed in the Americas in various areas of the Caribbean, Latin America, and the Southern United States. They derive from traditional African religions with some influence from other religious traditions, notably Christianity and Islam.

==Characteristics==
Afro-American religions involve ancestor veneration and include a creator deity along with a pantheon of divine spirits such as the Orisha, Loa, Vodun, Nkisi, and Alusi, among others. In addition to the religious syncretism of these various African traditions, many also incorporate elements of folk Catholicism including folk saints and other forms of folk religion, Native American religion, Spiritism, Spiritualism, Shamanism (sometimes including the use of Entheogens), and European folklore.

Various &quot;doctoring&quot; spiritual traditions also exist such as Obeah and Hoodoo which focus on spiritual health. African religious traditions in the Americas can vary. They can have non-prominent African roots or can be almost wholly African in nature, such as religions like Trinidad Orisha.

== African diaspora religions in the present ==
The nature and composition of the African diaspora have undergone significant changes over time: from the forced migration of African captives of the Old and New Worlds to the voluntary emigration of free, skilled Africans in search of political asylum or economic opportunities; from a diaspora with little contact with the point of origin (Africa) to one that maintains active contact with the mother continent, all culminating in the birth of a unique African who straddles continents, worlds and cultures.

== Defining diasporas ==
There are several conceptual difficulties in defining the African diaspora—indeed, in defining the term &quot;diaspora&quot;. Contemporary theorizations of the term &quot;diaspora&quot; tend to be preoccupied with problematizing the relationship between diaspora and nation and the dualities or multiplicities of diasporic identity or subjectivity; they are inclined to be condemnatory or celebratory of transnational mobility and hybridity. In many cases, the term &quot;diaspora&quot; is used in a fuzzy, ahistorical and uncritical manner in which all manner of movements and migrations between countries and even within countries are included and no adequate attention is paid to the historical conditions and experiences that produce diasporic communities and consciousness—how dispersed populations become self-conscious diaspora communities.

<doc id="651560" wikidata="Q348351" url="?curid=651560" title="Lee J. Cobb">
<text>Lee J. Cobb (born Leo Jacoby; December 8, 1911February 11, 1976) was an American actor, known both for film roles and his work on the Broadway stage, as well as for his starring role on the television series &quot;The Virginian&quot;. He often played arrogant, intimidating, and abrasive characters, but he also acted as respectable figures such as judges and police officers. He was nominated for two Academy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards, all in the Best Supporting Actor category. 

Cobb was a member of the Group Theatre and originated the role of Willy Loman in Arthur Miller&#x27;s 1949 play &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; under the direction of Elia Kazan. He received his first Oscar nomination for playing Johnny Friendly in Kazan&#x27;s &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954). His subsequent film performances included Juror #3 in &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1957), patriarch Fyodor Karamazov in &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; (also 1958). Dock Tobin in &quot;Man of the West&quot; (1958), Barak Ben Canaan in &quot;Exodus&quot; (1960), Marshall Lou Ramsey in &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962), Cramden in &quot;Our Man Flint&quot; (1966) and its sequel &quot;In Like Flint&quot; (1967), and Lt. William Kinderman in &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973). 

On television, Cobb played a leading role in the first four seasons of the Western series, &quot;The Virginian&quot; as Judge Henry Garth and the ABC legal drama &quot;The Young Lawyers&quot; as David Barrett, and was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actor three times. In 1981, Cobb was posthumously inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Cobb was born in New York City, to a Jewish family of Russian and Romanian origin. He grew up in The Bronx, New York, on Wilkins Avenue, near Crotona Park. His parents were Benjamin (Benzion) Jacob, a compositor for &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot; newspaper, and Kate (Neilecht), a homemaker

Interested in acting from a young age, Cobb ran away from home at 16 to try to make it in Hollywood. He joined Borrah Minevitch&#x27;s Harmonica Rascals as a musician and had a bit part in a short film featuring the group, but failed to find steady work and eventually moved back to New York.

Cobb studied accounting at New York University while working as a radio salesman. Still interested in show business, he went back to California and studied acting at the Pasadena Playhouse. He finally made his film debut at 23 in two episodes of the film serial &quot;The Vanishing Shadow&quot; (1934). He joined the Manhattan-based Group Theatre in 1935.

==Career==
=== Stage ===
Cobb performed summer stock with the Group Theatre in 1936, when it summered at Pine Brook Country Club in Nichols, Connecticut. He made his Broadway debut as a saloonkeeper in a dramatization of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; that closed after 15 nights. He starred opposite Elia Kazan in Group Theatre&#x27;s productions of Clifford Odets&#x27; &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot; and &quot;Golden Boy&quot;. He also acted in Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s only ever full-length play, &quot;The Fifth Column&quot;, and Odets&#x27; &quot;Clash by Night.&quot;

Cobb gained widespread recognition for his portrayal of Willy Loman in the original production of Arthur Miller&#x27;s play &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; under the direction of Elia Kazan. Miller praised Cobb as &quot;the greatest dramatic actor I ever saw&quot; and, upon his casting, changed a line referring to the physical appearance of the title character, whom the author had originally conceived of as a small man, from &quot;shrimp&quot; to &quot;walrus&quot;. Cobb played through the play&#x27;s entire initial run at the Morosco Theatre between February 1949 and November 1950. The play won the Tony Award for Best Play and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Miller later offered Cobb the part of Eddie Carbone in &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot;, but Cobb turned it down.

During World War II, Cobb joined the US Army Air Forces in the hopes of becoming a pilot. Instead, he was assigned to a radio unit. He was later transferred to the First Motion Picture Unit, where he appeared in Moss Hart Army Emergency Relief fundraiser productions like &quot;This is the Army&quot; and &quot;Winged Victory&quot;.

In 1968, his performance as King Lear with Stacy Keach as Edmund, René Auberjonois as the Fool, and Philip Bosco as Kent achieved the longest run (72 performances) for the play in Broadway history.

===Film===

Cobb entered films in the 1930s, successfully playing middle-aged and even older characters while he was still a youth. His first credited role was in the 1937 Hopalong Cassidy oater &quot;Rustlers&#x27; Valley&quot;, where he was billed using the stage name &#x27;Lee Colt.&#x27; In all subsequent films, he used Lee Cobb and later Lee J. Cobb.

He starred in the 1939 film adaptation of &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, albeit in a different role.

He was cast as the Kralahome in the 1946 film &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot;, upon which the musical play &quot;The King and I&quot; was later partially based. He also played the sympathetic doctor in &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; and appeared as Derek Flint&#x27;s (James Coburn) supervisor in the James Bond spy spoofs &quot;Our Man Flint&quot; and &quot;In Like Flint&quot;. 

In August 1955, while filming &quot;The Houston Story&quot;, Cobb suffered a heart attack and was replaced by Gene Barry. Later that year, he picked up a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his portrayal of corrupt union boss Johnny Friendly in Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;. He was nominated a second time for playing Fyodor in Richard Brooks&#x27; movie adaptation of &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;.

In 1957, he appeared in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; as the abrasive Juror #3. The role earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor, one of two in the same category. He was nominated again for the Frank Sinatra comedy &quot;Come Blow Your Horn&quot; (1963).

One of his final film roles was that of Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police homicide detective Lt. Kinderman in the 1973 horror film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, about a demonic possession of a teen-age girl (Linda Blair) in Georgetown, D. C. In the same decade, Cobb travelled to Europe to work in Italian films, primarily &quot;poliziotteschi&quot; (crime thrillers). His final films, &quot;Cross Shot&quot; and &quot;Nick the Sting&quot;, were both released posthumously, nearly two months after Cobb died.

===Television===
In 1959, on CBS&#x27; &quot;DuPont Show of the Month&quot;, he starred in the dual roles of Miguel de Cervantes and Don Quixote in the play &quot;I, Don Quixote&quot;, which years later became the musical &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;. Cobb also appeared as the Medicine Bow, Wyoming owner of the Shiloh Ranch, Judge Henry Garth in the first four seasons (1962–1966), of the long-running NBC Western television series &quot;The Virginian&quot; (1962–1971).

He reprised his role of Willy Loman in the 1966 CBS television adaptation of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, which included Gene Wilder, James Farentino, Bernie Kopell, and George Segal. Cobb was nominated for an Emmy Award for the performance. Mildred Dunnock, who had co-starred in both the original stage version and the 1951 film version, again repeated her role as Linda, Willy&#x27;s devoted wife.

One of his last television roles was as a stalwart overworked elderly physician still making house calls in urban Baltimore, in &quot;Doctor Max&quot;, a TV pilot for a potential series that never materialized. His final aired television role was &quot;Origins of the Mafia&quot;, a miniseries about the history of the Sicilian Mafia, filmed on-location in Italy. He subsequently appeared alongside British actor Kenneth Griffith in an ABC television documentary on the American Revolution called &quot;Suddenly an Eagle&quot;, which was broadcast six months after his death.

==Political activity==
Cobb was accused of being a Communist in 1951 testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) by Larry Parks, himself an admitted former Communist Party member. Cobb was called to testify before HUAC but refused to do so for two years until his career was threatened by the blacklist. He relented in 1953 and gave testimony, naming 20 people as former members of the Communist Party USA.

Later, Cobb explained why he &quot;named names&quot;, saying:

When the facilities of the government of the United States are drawn on an individual it can be terrifying. The blacklist is just the opening gambit—being deprived of work. Your passport is confiscated. That&#x27;s minor. But not being able to move without being tailed is something else. After a certain point it grows to implied as well as articulated threats, and people succumb. My wife did, and she was institutionalized. The HUAC did a deal with me. I was pretty much worn down. I had no money. I couldn&#x27;t borrow. I had the expenses of taking care of the children. Why am I subjecting my loved ones to this? If it&#x27;s worth dying for, and I am just as idealistic as the next fellow. But I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth dying for, and if this gesture was the way of getting out of the penitentiary I&#x27;d do it. I had to be employable again.

:— Interview with Victor Navasky for the 1980 book &quot;Naming Names&quot;


Following the hearing, he resumed his career and worked with Elia Kazan and Budd Schulberg, two other HUAC &quot;friendly witnesses&quot;, on the 1954 film &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cobb married Yiddish theatre and film actress Helen Beverley in 1940. They had two children, actress Julie Cobb, and son Vincent Cobb, before divorcing in 1952. Cobb&#x27;s second marriage was to school teacher Mary Hirsch, with whom he also had two children. Cobb supported Progressive Party candidate Henry A. Wallace in the 1948 United States presidential election.

==Death==
Cobb died of a heart attack on February 11, 1976 in Woodland Hills, California at age 64, and was buried in Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

He was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1981.

==Multiple medalists==
Boxers who have won 3 or more Olympic medals. Western athletes usually participate in a single Olympic tournament and then turn pro, while boxers from Cuba and other countries with state support of the sport might compete in several Olympics, therefore having a clear advantage in terms of age and experience. Therefore, there are no representatives of the United States, the most medaled boxing nation, on the list.

<doc id="651571" wikidata="Q14532158" url="?curid=651571" title="Association football tactics and skills">
<text>Team tactics as well as individual skills are integral for playing association football. In theory, association football is a very simple game, as illustrated by Kevin Keegan&#x27;s namely assertion that his tactics for winning a match were to &quot;score more goals than the opposition&quot;. Tactical prowess within the sport is nonetheless a craftsmanship of its own, and one of the reasons why managers are paid well on the elite level. Well-organised and ready teams are often seen beating teams with more skillful players on paper. Manuals and books generally cover not only individual skills but tactics as well.

Association football teams consist of ten outfield players and one goalkeeper, which makes passing an integral part of game strategy, and is taught to players from a young age. Other skills taught to players on an individual level are dribbling, heading the ball and ball control for receiving the ball. Other skills that are taught individually are jockeying for defenders, and shot stopping for goalkeepers. In terms of complexity, lower levels of the game such as youth leagues, amateur leagues and semi-professional leagues primarily focus on the fundamentals of the game, whereas higher levels of the game – as it regards to professional football teams – will increase complexity and level of detail in strategy of the game.

== General principles ==

Width and depth are principles of both offence and defence:

*&quot;Width in attack&quot;: The attacking side tries to divide the defence by diversifying points of attack across a broad front, rather than attempting to force advances through narrow channels. This may involve play from the wings, or rapid shifting into open lanes/open space when approaching the goal. Often gaps are made between defenders using the width of wingers. Gaps can then be used to feed the ball to strikers.
*&quot;Width in defence&quot;: The defending side responds, either through increasing width or strong side tilt, in an attempt to contract and deny width. Attackers are &quot;shepherded&quot; or channeled into narrower or more crowded avenues of space.
*&quot;Depth in attack&quot;: The attacking side uses the depth of the pitch by moving men either up from the rear, or down from the top, but may use a constant &quot;target striker&quot; or front man to always invoke a presence deep in the defence.
*&quot;Depth in defence&quot;: The defending side also uses depth by marking the supporting players of the opposing team, and holding a man back as cover for elevated opposing players, sometimes in a &quot;sweeper&quot; or &quot;libero&quot; role. The attacking player with the ball will have trouble finding anyone open for a pass. Defenders may alternatively abandon depth temporarily to set an offside trap.
*&quot;Balance in defence&quot;: The defending side attempts a balanced coverage of space. Defenders do not simply cluster on the right side for example, just because the ball is there at that time.

=== Substitutions ===

In FIFA 11-a-side competitive fixtures, teams are allowed to substitute up to five players during games. The rules of the competition state that all players and substitutes shall be named before kick-off and anyone not named in the starting lineup who takes to the field of play is considered a substitution. In non-competitive matches, the use of substitutes must be determined before the match begins, except in friendly international matches, where no more than six substitutes may be brought on.

The most tired players are generally substituted, but only if their substitutes are well trained to fill in the same role, or if the formation is transformed at the same time to accommodate for the substitution.

Coaches often refrain from substituting defensive players in order not to disrupt the defensive posture of the team. Instead, they often replace ineffective attackers or unimaginative midfielders in order to freshen up the attacking posture and increase their chances of scoring.

For a team that is losing a game, a fresh striker can bring more benefit in circumventing an opposed defence line composed of relatively tired players. For a team that is winning a game, a fresh midfielder or a defender can bring more benefit in strengthening the defence against the opposition&#x27;s attackers (who may be fresh substitutes themselves). In this situation, for the winning team, it is usually imaginative attacking flair players who are replaced by tough-tackling defensive midfielders or defenders.

Injured players may also need to be substituted. For each injured player who must be substituted, the team loses one more opportunity to influence things later in the game to their favour.

== Attacking tactics ==
One consideration that teams have to make when in possession of the ball, is what degree of risk-taking to impose on attack. Playing with lower margins may constitute higher reward, but is also associated with higher risks, as defensive sides can exploit transitions to their favour with a counter-attacking style of play. Higher margins means more security in ball control, but may also lead to longer periods of play without creating scoring chances. Association football offense requires high levels of anticipation skills in all its participating players, as a lot of decisions have to be made before the actual attacking play is made.

=== Attacking ===
* &quot;Pass and move&quot;: Having the ball in their possession, the player needs to choose quickly whether to pass it or not. If they do not pass it immediately, they need to move with it; if they do pass it, they again need to move along, following the general ball movement. This can also be used to mean that once a player has passed the ball he does not remain stationary but moves into a position where he can receive the ball again and give more options to the player in possession. The aim is to create a forward motion by moving the ball across areas where the defence are not (easily) able to create any momentum for themselves.
* &quot;Give and go&quot;: Essentially a type of &quot;pass and move&quot;, and an essential part of the &quot;target man&quot; style of play (see below). The player in possession of the ball plays a pass to a teammate and then immediately seeks to move into free space. If the passer can &quot;lose&quot; their defensive marker (either through pace, movement, superior fitness or a lack of awareness on the part of the defender) they are then free to receive a return pass and advance towards the goal and possible create (or finish) a scoring chance. When the ball is immediately returned to the first player this is known as a &quot;one-two&quot; (in British parlance). A version of this play involving a &quot;through ball&quot; into space as a return to the initial passer (known as a &quot;wall pass&quot; ) is sometimes used to get past the first level of defence (for example).
* &quot;Switching sides&quot;: The use of a &quot;square&quot; or &quot;cross&quot; pass across the width of the pitch to a player on the far side is an effective option for relieving pressure and opening up spaces for the attack. The defending team will have to adjust their positions and this normally opens up space that may be exploited. In this example, the player numbered 1 has moved out of position, allowing more space for the opposing player. By playing the ball to the other side (the curved line represents an aerial pass), the recipient of the pass finds themselves in open space. (See Ex. 1)
* &quot;Through ball&quot; (&quot;slide-rule pass&quot;): Starts with space identified behind the opponent&#x27;s defensive line. Passes into this area have a number of upsides: If an attacking player manages to receive the pass while onside, the player may end up with a 1-on-1 opportunity with the goalkeeper, or otherwise be in an advanced position for a wide attack. If a defender intercepts the pass, the outcome could still be good for the attacking team, as they are in a situation near the goal line, which could lead to a corner, a throw in or a turnover. Typically, teams with fast attacking players will try challenging this space. If the opposing team has a slower defence, this may prompt them to keep a rather low back line.
* &quot;Long through ball&quot;: A deep and oftentimes aerial pass from a team&#x27;s own half or the start of the opposing side&#x27;s half, intended to go over the heads of the other team&#x27;s defence. It is meant for the attacking players to chase and therefor they must remain in an onside position until the ball is kicked. The tactic works well with strong and fast forwards who have a good ability to control the ball and creating a scoring chance. (See Ex. 2)
* &quot;Passing at the back&quot;: This tactic is commonly used at the own half (if opponent pressure is imminent and the side which is in control of the ball seeks to calm down the play) so as to gain momentum for a new attempt to attack or just to retain ball possession in the course of a favourable score in the game. With the aim of keeping the ball in control, this tactic involves three, four or five defenders where the full backs normally are positioned slightly higher than the centre halves. This strategy is at times referred to as &quot;time-wasting&quot; if the ball controlling side isn&#x27;t actively looking to initiate an attack.
* &quot;Triangular play&quot;: A subtype of the give-and-go tactic; allows for a safe and quick movement of various areas in play whilst maintaining control of the ball. In a triangular play the ball is passed between three players to form a triangle. The triangle is then shifted to a different position when a new player is added. Many triangles can be created with various combinations of players with the intent to incrementally move the ball forward without compromising possession. This tactic is common when trying to gain control of midfield. However it may also be used for (final 3rd) attacking purposes. 
*&quot;Swapping wings&quot;: Having two available and positionally flexible wide men at their disposal, a coach might let them interchange positions in the course of a game. The intent is to disarrange opponents assigned to them, possibly leading to opportunities as the opponents try to find their players to cover. Also, if the wingers have different playing styles (one favouring crossing from deep positions whilst the other is prone to trying to dribble past their marker for example), it is a way to take advantage of a weakness in the opponent&#x27;s coverage. If the wingers have a different foot preference (meaning one is left-footed and the other is right-footed), swapping sides may make for some interesting attacking movement.
* &quot;In the space between the opponent&#x27;s defensive line and midfield line (the &quot;hole&quot;)&quot;: A common strategy of attack is to pass (or move) the ball into the spaces between the opponent&#x27;s defenders and midfielders. If a pass is made, a midfielder in an advanced position or an attacker in a deeper position will want to receive the ball right between the lines of the opponent. A player can also try to move the ball into this area on their own, at which point they may look for a passing option; alternatively attempting to create a good scoring chance on their own.
*&quot;Strong side overloads&quot;: Attacking teams may pressure the defence on to one side of the pitch by moving most of its attackers and midfielders to the ball side while letting a wing player or defender come to the opposite side with little or no coverage. By compressing space in the areas where the ball is, the defence has to respect the strong side threat by adding extra players into the mix. The ball is then crossed or passed into an unmarked area on the far side of the pitch for a free or near free shot, dribble or pass.
*&quot;Target man&quot;: The implied use of a quality striker who has the ability to take on the whole defence on their own - and will often occupy two defenders - making the defence vulnerable. Complemented with two fast wingers, this tactic may give the 4-man defence potential problems. Teams may also benefit from a target man at set pieces. Examples of strikers adept at playing this role are: Alan Shearer, Duncan Ferguson, Chris Sutton, Luca Toni, Nikola Žigić, Zlatan Ibrahimović, Peter Crouch, Didier Drogba, Miroslav Klose, Troy Deeney and Aleksandar Mitrović.
*&quot;Counter-attack&quot;: This strategy involves the use of a fast-paced attack, often immediately following a defensive transition of the ball. It could also refer to attacking in situations where the defensive coverage of the opponents have made a mistake by leaving (wide) spaces open to attack. This strategy requires fast players with good split-vision and quick thinking, as the ball is to transfer large distances of the field in a matter of seconds. Forwards will try to position themselves in open spaces either in or near the penalty box for a quick finish upon receiving the ball.
*&quot;Cross into the box&quot;: A player (often a winger, wide midfielder or fullback) situated &quot;outside&quot; the width of the penalty box (on one of the flanks) attempts a &quot;cross&quot; into the penalty box, for a teammate (usually a striker, or a forward) to try to score on (with a header, a volley, or a one touch shot). Crosses into the box can be of various height and length and target various areas of the penalty box. For this to work, the player attempting the cross needs to be skilled at performing this type of pass, as well as able to read the game of play, and the receiving target has to have a number of competitive advantages (such as height, strength, speed or heading skills) in order to beat the defence for the attempt at goal.

=== Lanes of play ===
In general there are three lanes of play - left, right and middle. The left and right lanes are also referred to as &quot;flanks&quot;, and attacking in these two channels doesn&#x27;t differ very much, except for the possible necessity for left-footed players on the left flank, for the purpose of crossing for example. The middle lane is a bit different, as it is the central lane of play, and also where the goal is. It necessitates attentive players who can cut through defensive lines with passes or play-moves that either vertically or diagonally ask questions to the stability and integrity of defence.

When making runs across the pitch in offense, whether horizontal, diagonal or vertical, these run lanes need to be a coordinated team effort, as one outfield player or even a part of the team (such as the midfield) need to trust other outfield players to cover for them when making these runs. In that way, the offensive game becomes a matter of balancing the optimism shown by forward runs with cautiousness in having players covering for them. This accounts for runs both on and off the ball.

==== Corridors ====

Sometimes teams tactically divide the pitch horizontally into five corridors instead: Outside left, inside left, central, inside right and outside right. This is among other things reflected in the positional names being used in formations with five midfielders, or five defenders.

=== Set pieces ===
==== Free kicks ====
Free kicks are a part of the play all over the field following a foul or other infraction. Indirect free kicks must be touched by a second player before any shot is taken. Direct free kicks can be made directly on goal. If the free kick is close to goal (within 35-40 yards), the defensive side will often form a &quot;wall&quot; of anything from 2-6 players in order to block the (expected) upcoming shot. In this case, the free kick taker may attempt several tricks to beat the defenders. Attackers may attempt to blast the ball through the defensive wall, or curl it over or around the wall using spin. A less common idea is to hit the ball powerfully and straight along the floor, since the defenders in the wall usually jump to try to prevent a shot being lifted over their heads. However, this tactic has become less effective in the modern game, as defending teams usually assign one player to lie down behind the wall to block any low attempts.

If the free kick is close-range but in a less-than-ideal angle to attempt to take a shot on goal, a common method of creating a scoring chance is to cross the ball into the penalty area, usually aiming for a spot in the angle towards the penalty spot, at which attacking players will try to beat defending players to the ball in order for a header or volleyball shot to hit the target. This is common to a corner kick.

David Beckham, Juninho, Siniša Mihajlović, Ronaldinho, Zico, Andrea Pirlo, Pierre van Hooijdonk, Neymar, Roberto Carlos, Francesco Totti, Lionel Messi, Álvaro Recoba, Cristiano Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Juan Román Riquelme, Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney, Sejad Salihović, Rogério Ceni, Michel Platini, Alessandro Del Piero, Thierry Henry, Roberto Baggio, Diego Maradona, Frank Lampard, Leighton Baines, Wesley Sneijder, Luis Suárez, Christian Eriksen, Reto Ziegler, Miralem Pjanić, James Ward-Prowse, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Gareth Bale are known to score from free kick positions.

==== Throw-ins ====
How throw-ins are best handled depends on where it is:
*In one&#x27;s own half the aim of a throw-in may be to retain possession in order to build up the next attack. The throw may or may not go toward the opponents&#x27; goal; the most unmarked player may be a full-back who is behind the ball. Such a throw followed by a quickly taken &#x27;switch&#x27; pass can be an effective tactic. Under pressure however, the ball is often thrown up the line, toward the opponents&#x27; goal line to gain as much ground as possible.
*If the thrower is unmarked, a simple tactic is to take a short throw to the feet or chest of a marked player who immediately returns the ball to the thrower.
*In the last third of the pitch a player with a long throw can put pressure onto the defenders by throwing the ball deep into the opponents&#x27; penalty area, resulting in somewhat similar tactics to a corner kick or a free kick situation, but with the added advantage of avoiding the offside trap that could be used by opponents in a free kick, as an attacking player cannot be offside from a throw in (the same applies for corner kicks). Players well known for their long throwing skills are Rory Delap, Giorgio Chiellini, John Arne Riise and Morten Gamst Pedersen.

==== Goal kicks ====
A goal kick is an important &#x27;set piece&#x27; that will occur many times in a game. If taken quickly the kick may be taken short to a full-back who has run into a wide position. Although this may gain little ground it retains the all-important possession of the ball. A longer kick to the midfield is more common and it is vital that the midfield unit are in a position to receive it. Some goalkeepers may take advantage of no offside rule while taking a Goal Kick to quickly pass the ball to a striker while the opposite team is still repositioning. One of the best examples of this tactic is Ederson of Manchester City, who often takes advantage of his strong and precise long kick to catch the opposition off guard.

==== Corners ====
A corner kick (or &quot;corner&quot;) is a goal scoring opportunity and it is essential to know who is the best at taking a good corner from both the left and right side of the pitch. A good corner will be aimed high across the goal and may be &#x27;bent&#x27; towards or away from the goal. At least one of the forwards should be on or close to the goal line when the kick is taken.

Another tactic on a corner is to let the best shooter stay in the back &quot;trash&quot; position and have the defence worried about those up front. The player taking the corner kick makes a small pass back to the trash shooter who has time and space to take a good shot.

== Defensive tactics ==
All the outfield players on the field are assigned defensive roles of which depend to an extent upon tactics. In principle, there are two ways of defending, zone defence and man-to-man defence. In a zone defence, defensive players mainly move in synchronicity with teammates, whereas a man-to-man defence players mainly moves in relation to opposing players. Whenever defensive players are given, or give themselves, a larger degree of freedom, hybrids of the two are seen. Today it is common for teams to use a combination of the two systems.

Defensive systems may pose as a strength or a weakness, as talented attacking sides are adept at profiting from the lack of defensive structure shown by subpar defensive sides. Another consideration for defensive tactics is pressure width; to what extent teams will let players approach the sidelines when pressing wide, as contrasted to staying central, where teams who favour a wide pressing approach will allow for more than one player at or near the sidelines at a given point in time, whereas a more centered approach to defense will usually settle for one or no players at or near the sidelines at a given point in time.

=== First, second and third defenders ===

The &quot;first defender&quot; is the first respondent, regardless of what the opponent in possession does, seeking to obstruct all sorts of dangerous play. The first defender should usually be the player closest to the opponent holding possession, but needs to be at the defending side in order to not get caught &quot;flat footed&quot; on the wrong side, for example. This role commonly involves the angling of the body in an attempt to guide the opponent in a given direction of play presumably preferable to the defensive side. The first defender may also indicate to the rest of the team whether to stay high or back off from pressure.

The first defender will normally keep a distance to the opponent of a few yards, although the exact distance varies for each defending situation. The idea is to pressure the opposing player as tightly as possible without handing them the possibility of a (successful) dribble or feint. In certain cases, the first defender attempts a tackle. This increases the probability of being dribbled and passed, so it has to be managed wisely.

The direction in which to move towards the opponent with possession of the ball may be the shortest direction. However, it may be of value to curve the defensive run, in order to channel (also called &quot;show&quot;) the opponent in a certain direction. Different teams will allow (&quot;show&quot;) opponents either the inside (central lane) of the pitch, or the outside (outer lanes) of the pitch, depending on the situation as well as the tactics of that particular defensive side. For example, a common tactic for a first defender is to &quot;show&quot; the opposing player an area where they already know that a second or third defender is located, thus making it a safe choice to lead the opponents into.

The &quot;second defender&quot; provides the immediate support for the first defender. If the first defender loses his or her marking, the second defender takes over as first defender, and ideally one of the &quot;third defenders&quot; takes over as second defender. A defensive side should be organised so as to make this transition as smooth as possible. A typical distance between the second and first defender is about six metres, though this will vary from situation to situation. The most important factor is the opponent&#x27;s speed. If the opposing player is moving fast, the distance should be longer. If he is standing still, the second and first defender may sometimes join forces and operate as two first defenders. A second defender also adjusts their positioning relative to where teammates of the defensive side are positioned in coverage in order to uphold defensive structure (see for example offside trap).

The role of the third defender is to provide a deeper cover. He or she is often in a stand-off position relative to the first and second defenders and therefor has a view of the &quot;big picture&quot; in defense, watching for any opponents moving up, and covering gaps if the first and second defenders are outmanoeuvred by the opponent. In addition, the third defender is usually tasked with informing teammates (including but not limited to first and second defenders) about potential upcoming threats. While the role of first and second defenders are relatively similar regardless of defending strategies and systems, the third defenders&#x27; role is very different in zone defence and man-to-man defence.

=== Depth considerations ===
While line depth varies considerably depending on team strategy as well as game situation, a good &quot;rule of thumb&quot; for distances between defensive and midfield lines is about 16 metres (or 17-18 yards). Defensively minded teams will use a shorter line depth when compared to offensively minded teams, for example. Line depth will also depend on other factors such as line width, as well as strong- side tilt (whether the team stays central or tries to push out wide, when the ball is near the sidelines). Line depth is also likely to be less when the ball is near the defending team&#x27;s penalty box, compared to further up the pitch.

When organised, the defending team may offer little resistance until the attacking team has reached a certain height on the pitch. The pressure height, or at which field depth the midfielders start acting as first and second defenders, depends on a lot of factors, such as game tactics and situation. Higher pressure teams need to make sure to win the ball back fast enough a number of times in pressure, in order for the tactic to be lucrative (as opposed to tiring). In general, defensive-minded teams will stay lower, minimising defensive risks by compressing attacking space. The pressure height may be identified by at which stage of the opposite side attacking play that the first pressure line of support kicks in.

=== The zone defence ===
In zone defence, second and third defenders and midfielders are organised in two lines, in the transversal direction of the field, constituting a defender line and a midfielder line, the midfield line working as a &quot;second shield&quot; of the defence. The lines should be fairly possible, though the first defender and in some cases the second defender may rush out to pressure the opponent with the ball. A straight line of defenders may prevent spaces behind some of them because of the offside rule. Also, some opponents, for example those moving into dangerous space, may temporarily need to be man-marked. The number of players in the defender and midfielder lines is given by the football formations in play. Some formations use midfield anchors to stop attacks between the two lines.

=== The man-to-man defence ===
In man-to-man defence, a single defender follows their opponent wherever they go. Extremely tight marking can be achieved in this way and star players can often be neutralised in a game by use of a dedicated &quot;shadow&quot;. Since the man-to-man defence will take defenders in any part of the field, interceptions and broken plays will often offer opportunity for quick counter-attack. The Italian teams of the 1970s and 1980s often used this approach with impressive results.

The shortcomings of the man-to-man defence is a lack of depth when new attackers move up or down the field. The man-to-man defence also may allow for defenders to be drawn out of position, opening gaps for other attackers in vulnerable areas. This was Italy&#x27;s flaw in the 1970 Final, according to some analysts. To overcome this problem with depth, the man to man defence may use a &#x27;sweeper&#x27;, who is a central defender and has a free role (no assigned player to mark). The sweeper sometimes may take up a position slightly behind the defensive line, as the role often involves &#x27;sweeping up&#x27; any attacks that break through the defence and thus add valuable depth to the defensive unit. Zone defence does not require a sweeper role, and as many teams have changed their tactics on this, sweepers today are rare.

=== Other considerations ===
Additional defensive considerations that may be of relevance are:

*&quot;Width of defence&quot; – what proportion of the pitch width is covered by the defence in a particular situation,
*&quot;Height of defence&quot; – a &quot;low block&quot; indicates an emphasis on defending the own half, a &quot;medium block&quot; indicates an emphasis on defending the first two-thirds of the pitch, and a &quot;high block&quot; indicates emphasis on defending all or most of the pitch, and said terms also indicate at what point in the play progression of the opposite side that teams elect to press or to drop from pressing the ball,
*&quot;Offside-trap&quot; – whether a team tries to follow oncoming attacking players or attempt to &quot;trap&quot; the players posing a threat in an offside position,
*&quot;Strong-side tilt&quot; – to what extent a team moves over towards the horizontal half of the pitch where the ball is located (the alternative is to stay central),
*&quot;Active defending&quot; – to what extent a team wants to get close to the ball (the alternative is to stay in position and cover passing lanes),
*&quot;Defensive line height&quot; – how much space the back line allows in behind it.

=== Defending at set pieces ===
==== Free-kicks from short range ====
At free-kicks from short range, particularly when defending a &quot;direct&quot; free-kick, a wall of defensive players is lined up. The number of players who form the wall depends on the angle and distance from the goal, the opponent&#x27;s assumed shooting skills, and the need to mark opponents to whom the ball might be passed. The wall is usually set up at the direction of the defending goalkeeper to block a direct shot at the near post. The goalkeeper is normally positioned nearer the far post. In order to increase the difficulty for the free-kick taker to kick the ball over the wall and into the goal it is common for the players in the wall to jump vertically when the kick is taken.
Defending &quot;indirect&quot; free-kicks provides different difficulties for the defending team. The wall must be prepared to charge down the ball once it has been touched by the free-kick taker, and other defenders must be alert to the attacking team&#x27;s practised set-plays. Getting the ball over the wall and then to dip into the bottom corner is a superb skill.

==== Corner kicks and other crosses ====
At corner kicks, and at direct free kick, indirect free kick or throw-ins that are likely to distribute a cross, most teams use man-on-man marking, even those which otherwise play zone defence. Each player is given an opponent to mark, in advanced football they usually have been assigned an opponent before the match. Substituting at the time of a defensive set piece is regarded as unwise, as play may be started before the substitute has come into marking position.

A few teams use the tactic of gathering defenders on one line on corner kicks and similar situations, in effect giving them the responsibility for zones instead of particular opponents.

==== Penalty kicks ====
In the case of a penalty kick, no defending players except the goalkeeper are allowed within the penalty area or within ten yards of the penalty spot and 18 yards of the goal line. A significant number of players should, however, be placed right outside the penalty area, alert to advance into the area and clear any deflection. For this purpose, sometimes the attacking team will nominate two players to run at the goal from either side of the penalty spot; timing their run so that they only enter the penalty area once the kick has been taken will hopefully give them the first opportunity at gathering the ball if it is saved by the goalkeeper. This tactic is rarely seen, however, since the likelihood of the ball being saved and then falling into the path of the attacking player is small. A particular tactic that can be used by the goalkeeper involves trying to distract the penalty taker by drawing his concentration away from striking the ball cleanly. Such tactics normally involve moving one&#x27;s body, or body parts, in an extravagant manner, or through verbal comments. Famous examples of where this worked successfully include Bruce Grobbelaar in the 1984 European Cup final, and Jerzy Dudek in the 2005 Champions League Final.

=== &quot;Forward&quot; versus &quot;collapsing&quot; defences ===
Teams may use forward defending, aggressively challenging the ball when on the defensive in any part of the field. Others rely on a &quot;collapsing&quot; style, that falls back deep into its own half when the opponent is in possession of the ball. The &quot;forward&quot; policy can put immense physical and psychological pressure on opponents, and is aimed at slowing down or breaking up attacks early. It has more physical demands however, and may spread a defensive formation more thinly. In general, defensive-minded teams will stay lower, minimising defensive risks by compressing attacking space. The &quot;collapsing&quot; approach is more economical in terms of less physical demand, and provides a packed back zone to thwart attacks. However it sometimes creates large gaps in midfield, and invites the opposing team to dribble forward and to take shots from long range; if the opposing team is good at the two aforementioned skills then goals will be conceded freely. More progressive styles of defending in general invites counterattacking by the opponent.

The most prominent form of &quot;forward&quot; defending, Gegenpressing (, &quot;counter-pressing&quot;), developed by Ralf Rangnick and exemplified by teams managed by German managers such as Jürgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel, requires attackers and midfielders to press the opposition immediately following loss of possession.

==== Defending with the ball ====
A &quot;clearance&quot; is when the player in possession of the ball is put under pressure, often near the own goal, and so chooses to shoot the ball away simply in order to get the ball out of a dangerous area of play. When opponent pressure is high, the ball is at times cleared to a corner kick or to a throw-in. Clearing long, but into opponent control, may give the defence time and the opportunity to organise, including setting up the correct formation and pressure height. If confident in their ability to do so, a player might also try to clear the ball up to a higher-situated teammate, in order not to give away possession of the ball to the other side.

If the attack was high up the field, such as in or near the penalty area, defenders will thus quickly push out, and attackers will then be forced to retreat in order to avoid offside in the next move. Clearing may be combined with an attempt to hit a long pass or a long through ball. Players high up in the field who are pressed hard, and who are eager to avoid a counter-attack, may in some instances combine clearing with a shot. A team composed of good passers and mobile players with good positioning skills may more often try to avoid clearing, as their skills make it easier to make shorter passes and thus retain possession until they get out of a difficult situation.

Retaining possession in this way may also be regarded as a longer-term way of defending, as the opposing team cannot attack when they don&#x27;t have the ball. With the ball, the team applying this tactic can simply pass the ball between each other - as in the possession football style, but with little or no intention of building up an attack, thus decreasing the risk of a break.

The main benefit of this tactic is that the team is in complete control over its opponents. Meanwhile, by knocking the ball around, opponents playing the pressing game can easily tire. And should an opportunity suddenly arise, defence may be quickly switched to attack. A major downfall is that because the accuracy of passes needs to be high, short passes between the players are required. This significantly narrows the gap between the attack, midfield and defence (usually, the latter is forced to push up). So if the opponent gains possession, a long ball could effectively open up the defence. Similarly, if it is the attack and midfield that need to drop back, the team will have little chances of counter-attacking even if possession is won back.

== Notable examples ==
Football coaches and technical manuals such as &quot;Soccer Skills and tactics,&quot; and &quot;The Soccer Coaching Bible,&quot; often use visual symbols and diagrams to demonstrate the principles described above, and to link principles to historical games. The following examples combine technical coaching observations with championship play descriptions at the World Cup level as in Brian Glanville&#x27;s &quot;World Cup, (1994)&quot;. The written descriptions are diagrammed for the reader to better understand various football tactics and skills as they are applied in the real world, at the highest levels.

=== Combined team play using width and depth: Brazil vs Italy, 1970 final ===

&quot;Beating a defence using width and depth.&quot; Astute use of the principles of width and depth led to the last goal of the 1970 FIFA World Cup final, considered by many to be the best combined team effort in Cup history. Almost all the players of Brazil touched the ball in this effort that penetrated one of the tightest defences ever seen, the famous Italian catenaccio &quot;padlock&quot; defence. The Italians used four defenders, plus a sweeper, Pierluigi Cera, behind the &quot;back four.&quot; They relied on a counter-attacking game, deploying three midfielders and two strikers, and closely marked opponents man to man.

This tight system however involved a &quot;collapsing&quot; approach that while packing the Italian penalty area and denying the Brazilian forwards much space, left relatively large gaps in midfield. See &quot;Standing Off&quot; defensive discussion above. Brazil&#x27;s superb skills exploited this weakness, showing especially that any defence (whether man to man, zone or other variants) can be beaten using the principles of both width and depth. The weakness of the man to man system was also exposed. Italian left back Giacinto Facchetti dedicated himself to winger Jairzinho, shadowing him tightly wherever he went. Jairzinho cunningly moved off the right flank, opening gaps for others to follow as can be seen below. See &quot;Switching the attack&quot; and &quot;Swapping wing men&quot; above for discussion of this aspect of offensive tactics.

&quot;Italian defence pulled left in quick sequence.&quot; Brazilian midfielder Clodoaldo began the move with a weaving dribble out to the left flank, that beat three men and essentially pulled the Italian defence in that direction. A fatal gap was thus eventually opened up for the run of fullback Carlos Alberto Torres on the right. Clodoaldo eased the ball to the Rivellino moving up on the left. Rivellino quickly played the ball forward to Jairzinho, who crossed the field to appear on the left flank.

&quot;Movement in centre &quot;freezes&quot; Italian defence.&quot; Almost without pause the powerful Jairzinho began a weaving run. Facchetti played Jairzinho well, backing off the ball, and squeezing him inside where it was more crowded. Good defenders will &quot;channel&quot; (see discussion above) an attacker into areas with less space. So far, all seemed safe for Italy. Facchetti covered well, as did the other Italian defenders. There were two extra men as insurance in the back as Jairzinho began his run. Depth is also a principle of defence, and the sweeper system (or other arrangements) provides such.

As Jairzinho accelerated, the ever dangerous striker Tostão began a sprint up the middle, drawing his defender with him, diverting the Italian defence and making more room for Jairzinho. Younger players should note the movement off the ball by Brazil. Increasingly squeezed inside, Jairzinho&#x27;s run nevertheless drew the defence to him and he eased the ball to Pelé in the centre. Always dangerous, Pelé paused and shaped to make a dribble.

&quot;Overlapping defender exploits principle of depth to cap the move.&quot; For the Italian defence, there was still no cause for undue alarm. Pelé seemed well covered, and there was still the sweeper at the back as insurance behind the defence. Nevertheless, Pelé&#x27;s feint, combined with the previous moves, kept Italian focus frozen in the middle, attracting the attention of three men, and he casually slipped the ball right- to Carlos Alberto who was thundering up from the rear, totally unmarked.

Pelé played the ball well ahead of Alberto, using space intelligently, so that the fast fullback ran on and shot without pausing, in full stride, smashing the ball into the Italian net. So effective was Brazil&#x27;s use of width, that no Italian defender is even within reasonable striking distance of Alberto until the last moment. The principle of width stretched and drew the Italian defence. The principle of depth—fresh men moving up from the rear—allowed Brazil to exploit the gaps created by width.

=== Penetration and envelopment in attack: Banks versus Pelé, Mexico 1970 ===

&quot;Penetration in attack- the forward or through pass:&quot; To a footballer, the penetration pass is one of the first methods learned in attack, whether it be the simple &quot;kick and chase&quot; of the youth leagues, or the exquisite through-balls by today&#x27;s world class stars. Penetration by pass is the quickest method of advancing the ball towards the enemy goal. When well executed, it can yield spectacular results. Penetration in attack however requires more than mere passing. Players without the ball must move into space, and must time their runs so as not to be caught offside.

&quot;Envelopment in attack: the central cross.&quot; Attacking an opposing side from the flanks using crosses from the wings is among the oldest and most effective football tactics. An attack from the flanks uses width to stretch an opposing defence creating gaps in the goal area to be exploited. While the direction of the lateral cross is not as straightforward as the through-ball, both types of passes serve to split an enemy defence, in view of striking at the vital central area of the goal. This example, the legendary confrontation between keeper Gordon Banks of England and Pelé of Brazil at 1970 FIFA World Cup Group 3 match, captures the two types of attack in one snapshot. It also serves to illustrate the difficulties in defending against both types of passes.

&quot;Two pass types - one great defensive save.&quot; The powerful running of Brazil&#x27;s right winger Jairzinho set the stage, with initial direction by captain Carlos Alberto. Sprinting down the flank, Jairzinho pounced on an excellent through pass from Alberto, accelerated past Cooper the English back, and lofted a high arcing cross to Pelé in the centre. Pelé headed down powerfully and was already raising his arms in triumph when Banks leaped to his right &quot;like a salmon over a fall&quot; Pelé said later, and somehow flailed the bouncing ball over the crossbar, saving a sure goal. The Brazilian forward said it was the greatest save he had ever seen. Offensively, this play demonstrates how both types of passes can divide and stretch a defence. Jairzinho&#x27;s running and cross was set up by an excellent forward pass, and his centre to Pelé capped a move that should have resulted in a goal, were it not for the extraordinary skill of English keeper, Gordon Banks. Offside traps are one way to defend against both pass types, but the ultimate solution is defensive depth and sound goalkeeping.

=== Two-man combination ===

&quot;Using the two-man combination.&quot; The two-man combination pass, variously called the wall pass, the &quot;one-two&quot;, the &quot;give and go&quot; and other local names, is among the simplest yet most powerful team techniques in football. It requires a fair level of individual skill to pull off, yet this should not stop coaches from introducing it early in the higher youth leagues, nor should players from these leagues neglect it in favour of the all too easy &quot;kick and chase&quot;. There are two ways to execute it: pass and run to space for the return pass without pausing or pass then pause briefly to gauge opposing reaction before running into an open spot for the return. In tight conditions, the first method is better, while the second can be used where there is a bit more space to operate.

&quot;Power of the two-man combination: Netherlands vs Brazil, 1974.&quot; Simple as it is, the two-man move can penetrate the teeth of the densest, most negative opposition. Peru brought it to a high art on the World Cup stage in 1970, under their coach Didi, Brazil&#x27;s former midfield general of 1958 and 1962. Time after time Peruvian forwards like Cubillas, Gallardo, and Sotil put a central combination on the floor that sliced through the opposition and created countless dangerous situations. The Dutch team of 1974 were also disciples of the two-man combination. The diagram here shows the first Dutch goal in the 1974 game that crushed Brazil&#x27;s repeat championship hopes - product of an exchange between Johan Neeskens and Johan Cruyff. A two-man move also set up the second goal for Cruyff in the game. Contrast with the &quot;hand&quot; of Diego Maradona below.

&quot;Potential of the two-man combination: Maradona&#x27;s &quot;hand of god&quot; goal – 1986.&quot;
The example shown below, the first goal of Diego Maradona against England in 1986, is used to illustrate the potential of the move. Argentina utilised it frequently, being ideally suited to their crisp, quick, short passing style. As he had often done during the game, Maradona initiated the sequence with a quick dribbling run into the packed central area. Surrounded, he began a two-man combo pass - slipping the ball to Jorge Valdano on the right, and then moving up for the reply. Valdano pivoted and attempted to return, but conditions were too tight. Hodge, the English midfielder, intercepted and rather dangerously, attempted to tap the ball back to his keeper, Shilton. Maradona and Shilton raced towards the floating ball, which connected with Maradona&#x27;s hand (the so-called &quot;hand of god&quot; goal), past Shilton, into the goal. While much controversy still surrounds the goal, Maradona&#x27;s run illustrates how even the tightest conditions can be pried open with the two-man exchange. It also illustrates how the simple two-man combination can create countless dangerous situations and force opponents into making errors.

=== Three-man move ===

&quot;Effectiveness of three-man strike teams.&quot; The three-man move is another very effective weapon in the attacking arsenal. It is distinguished from simple passing between players in that the initiator of the move finishes it with a shot on goal or a well-placed pass leading to a shot. It is thus a collaboration of three distinct players. Famous three-man strike teams are legendary in football, from the earliest days, through the famous Hungarian sides of the 1950s, to the &quot;clockwork orange&quot; of the Dutch masters in the 1970s, through the German, Italian, French, Argentinian, Brazilian, and other teams of the contemporary era. The three-man package can be more effective than the two-man combo because it gives more attacking options and causes more confusion in the defence. The initial pass cannot be quickly cut off as in the two-man manoeuvre which really has only one option. Typically the second pass in the three-man move lures and diverts defenders on to false ground. This gives the initiator of the sequence time to run into an advantageous position. Triple player collaborations of course do not operate in isolation – they have other supporting players – but the tight three-man exchange still remains a fundamental pillar of successful attacking play.

&quot;Brazil vs Uruguay 1970 – strike package: Jairzinho – Pelé – Tostão.&quot; The example below, is drawn from one of the most famous strike teams in World Cup history- Pelé, Tostão and Jairzinho. This goal, against Uruguay in the 1970 semi-final, captures the power of the move. The fast winger Jairzinho set the stage- dribbling down the right flank before finding Pelé ahead. Tightly marked, and with his back to the goal, Pelé immediately played a subtle pass to Tostão. The Brazilian centre-forward drew the defence to him with a short dribble before finding Jairzinho again on the wing. This exchange of passes gave Jairzinho a lead on other defenders and he made the most of it – accelerating down the wing, selling a dummy (letting the ball run after pretending to stop and play it) on Uruguayan defender Matosas, and muscling him aside as he approached the enemy goal. Uruguayan keeper Mazurkiewicz came off his line but it was simply too late, as Jairzinho slotted the ball into the net. Of note in this sequence is the attacking space created by the tight exchanges between Jairzinho, Pelé, and Tostão. Even the Uruguayans, playing one of the most densely packed, solid defences seen in a World Cup could not stop it. Jairzinho is surrounded by opposing defenders when the sequence starts, but at the end, he only has one to deal with. Also of note is the unselfish passing of Brazilian striker Tostão, with his skill creating countless openings for his teammates throughout the 1970 tournament.

=== Quick long-ball counter-attack ===

Counter attacking Football involves a team withdrawing players into their own half but ensuring that one or two players are committed to the attack. One such example is the quick counter-strike mounted by England against Germany in the 1970 World Cup. Defensive midfielder Alan Mullery began the move, lofting a long through pass over the heads of three German defenders, to Newton on the right flank. Not pausing to admire his handiwork, Mullery kept moving up. Newton, a defensive player was placed in an excellent attacking position with few opponents to check his progress. Newton advanced on a short dribble, before producing a low, outstanding diagonal cross that found Mullery, who had sprinted into the goalmouth. Mullery finished what he had started, by driving the ball home past the German goalkeeper Sepp Maier. Tactically, this goal combines the power of the long pass with that of the two-man combination, and indeed, before his pass to Newton, Mullery had exchanged passes with Francis Lee before setting off on his final combination run. This move was pulled off by two normally defensively oriented players, showing that the long-ball counter-strike can be successful from a deep position on the field with any combination of skilled players.

=== Free-kicks and set-pieces ===
&quot;Indirect free-kicks&quot; can throw a defence into confusion when taken quickly, or in unexpected directions. The third goal of Brazil&#x27;s 1970 World Cup victory over Italy illustrates the method. Brazil&#x27;s midfield general Gerson Nunes approached rapidly and lofted the dead ball in a high arc almost from the midfield line. It found Pelé perfectly positioned near the Italian goal. The Brazilian headed down softly and accurately, straight into the path of the onrushing winger Jairzinho, who virtually walked the ball into the net. Italy&#x27;s &quot;catenaccio&quot; defence was caught out of position here, not only failing to neutralise Pelé, but providing little cover to stop Jairzinho. A rapid, daring set-piece kick will often accomplish this unbalancing of defences.

&quot;Direct free-kicks&quot; are a key part of attacking in football, and can lead to many goals. Numerous feints and ruses are tried to fool the opposition, including having attackers join the &quot;wall.&quot; A successful free kick from the 1970 World Cup- Brazil vs Czechoslovakia, illustrates how the technique works. Brazilian forwards Jairzinho and Tostao cunningly joined the end of the defensive wall as the Czechs set it up. As Pelé backed off and feinted as if to take the kick, both Jair and Tostão began to move off, creating space. Rivellino ghosted in from the side to shoot powerfully into the gap for a goal.

=== Moving into space – the diagonal run ===

Moving into free space is one of the most critical skills that football players must develop. Attacking players must move &quot;off the ball&quot; into space to give an advance the maximum chance of success. Passes to space are feasible when there is intelligent movement of players to receive the ball and do something constructive with it. Skilled players are able to find seams between defenders, positioning themselves to receive a pass.

This diagram shows a productive use of space by West Germany in the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final which led to Gerd Müller&#x27;s game-winning goal against the Netherlands. German midfielder Rainer Bonhof made a long diagonal run out to the right side of the field, putting put him clear of the Dutch opposition. Deep into the Dutch half, Bonhof received a ball from Jürgen Grabowski and beat Arie Haan. Bonhof sent a low cross in to Müller, who found the back of the net. Moving diagonally is one of the best offensive movements, whether at the near or far posts, or out to the wings farther back in midfield. Diagonal movement creates added space to maneuver, compared to simply running straight ahead or laterally. It also means that players must be willing to switch positions as the situation demands.

== Studies ==
Although the scientific research field of association football is still in its early days, some interesting studies are emerging. It has for example been shown, that in possession play, successful teams have both longer and more frequent possessions in the offensive areas of the pitch, as well as finding it easier to move the ball into the offensive areas of the pitch, after initiating possession, when compared to unsuccessful teams. As a defensive strategy, research has suggested that being able to consistently pose players immediately behind the ball, as well as in other areas of proximity to the ball indicates a positive correlation with defensive goal prevention both when in and out of possession.

Statistical methods for modeling player analysis have proven useful in performance assessment. Similar methods find their use in predictions and evaluations of matches.

<text>Dishwashing, washing the dishes, doing the dishes, or (in Great Britain) washing up, is the process of cooking utensils, dishes, cutlery and other food-soiled items to promote hygiene and health by preventing foodborne illness. This is either achieved by hand in a sink or tub using dishwashing detergent, or by using a dishwasher, and may take place in a kitchen, utility room, scullery or elsewhere.

==Implements==

Dish washing is usually done using an implement for the washer to wield, unless done using an automated dishwasher. Commonly used implements include cloths, sponges, brushes or even steel wool. As fingernails are often more effective than soft implements like cloths at dislodging hard particles, washing simply with the hands is also done and can be effective as well. Dishwashing detergent is also generally used, but bar soap can be used acceptably, as well. Rubber gloves are often worn when washing dishes by people who are sensitive to hot water or dish-washing liquids, those who do not want to touch the old food particles, or those who do not wish to get as wet. According to dermatologists, the use of protective gloves is highly recommended whenever working with water and cleaning products, since some chemicals may damage the skin, or allergies may develop in some individuals. Many people also wear aprons.

There is also variation in the temperature and state of water. Some people prefer cold water or hot water, and some people prefer running water or standing water.

==Sanitization==
Where dishes are to be shared among many, such as in restaurants, sanitization is necessary and desirable in order to prevent spread of microorganisms. Most restaurants have three-compartment sinks (depending on country or state regulations) and use the three-sink system (washing, rinsing and sanitizing of dirty dishes) with the first compartment containing a combination of warm water and soap or detergent. Water within the first compartment often needs to be between (according to applicable health codes).

Most institutions have a dish-washing machine which sanitizes dishes by a final rinse in either very hot water or a chemical sanitizing solution such as dilute bleach solution (50-100 parts per million chlorine; about 2 ml of 5% bleach per litre of water, approximately one capful of bleach per gallon water). Dishes are placed on large trays and fed onto rollers through the machine. Dishwashers typically exceed and kill all germs, while hand-washing reaches temperatures of at most .

While not environmentally friendly, the use of bleach is critical to sanitation when large groups are involved: it evaporates completely, it is cheap, and it kills most germs. Cabinets, refrigerators, countertops, and anything else touched by people in a large group setting should be periodically wiped or sprayed with a dilute bleach solution after being washed with soapy water and rinsed in clean water.

However, bleach is less effective in the presence of organic debris, so a small amount of food residue can be enough to permit survival of, e.g., Salmonella bacteria. Scrubbing followed by soaking in bleach is effective at reducing Salmonella contamination, but even this method does not eliminate Salmonella bacteria.

In hand-washing, plastic brushes with nylon bristles are preferred to washcloths or sponges, which can spread microorganisms. Use of soap or sanitizer is mandatory in washing by hand in public food facilities.

In the UK, hand-washing often excludes rinsing after washing and sometimes prefers air-drying to using a towel; in the US rinsing is typical, as is drying with a towel. The UK method of drying apparently reduces smudges and bacteria, while the US method is faster. In the UK, comedy actor Ben Rufus Green even streams live washing up on his Twitch channel on Sunday mornings. 

==Traditional dishwashing practice==
===Developing countries===

Traditionally, dishwashing is done by scrubbing the utensils with wet fabric dipped in scrub ash to scrub away the dirt. The utensils are then rinsed in clean water and hung to drip dry. Scrub ash (kharani) is specially made by burning wood for dishwashing. This is a common practice in villages of Asian developing countries like Nepal, Indonesia, and India.

==Dishwasher==


A &quot;dishwasher&quot; is a machine for cleaning dishware and cutlery automatically. Unlike manual dishwashing, which relies largely on physical scrubbing to remove soiling, the mechanical dishwasher cleans by spraying hot water, typically between , at the dishes, with lower temperatures used for delicate items.

A mix of water and dishwasher detergent is pumped to one or more rotating spray arms, blasting the dishes with the cleaning mixture. The mixture is recirculated to save water and energy. Often there is a pre-rinse, which may or may not include detergent, and the water is then drained. This is followed by the main wash with fresh water and detergent. Once the wash is finished, the water is drained, more hot water enters the tub by means of an electro-mechanical solenoid valve, and the rinse cycle(s) begin. After rinsing finishes the water is drained again, the dishes are dried using one of several drying methods. Typically a rinse-aid, a chemical to reduce surface tension of the water, is used to reduce water spots from hard water or other reasons.

In addition to domestic units, industrial dishwashers are available for use in commercial establishments such as hotels and restaurants, where many dishes must be cleaned. Washing is conducted with temperatures of and sanitation is achieved by either the use of a booster heater that will provide an &quot;final rinse&quot; temperature or through the use of a chemical sanitizer.

==In popular culture==
* Dishwasher Pete, or Pete Jordan, is a fanzine author whose goal was to wash dishes in every state in the United States.
* &quot;The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai&quot; is an Xbox Live Arcade game in which the protagonist is an undead dishwasher.
* &quot;Dishdogz&quot; is a 2005 film about a boy working as a dishwasher during his summer break.
* In his book &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot; by George Orwell, he describes his experience working as a dishwasher or &quot;plongeur&quot; in a French hotel in 1929. He describes the job, the interactions with other employees, and his thoughts on the place of a &quot;plongeur&quot; in society.
* There is a Western cultural cliché that restaurant patrons who can&#x27;t pay the tab would instead work off their debt by washing dishes.

<text>The Grand Canal ( , locally and informally ; , locally usually ) is the largest channel in Venice, Italy, forming one of the major water-traffic corridors in the city.

One end of the canal leads into the lagoon near the Santa Lucia railway station and the other end leads into the basin at San Marco; in between, it makes a large reverse-S shape through the central districts (&quot;sestieri&quot;) of Venice. It is long, and wide, with an average depth of .

== Description ==

The banks of the Grand Canal are lined with more than 170 buildings, most of which date from the 13th to the 18th century, and demonstrate the welfare and art created by the Republic of Venice. The noble Venetian families faced huge expenses to show off their richness in suitable palazzos; this contest reveals the citizens’ pride and the deep bond with the lagoon. Amongst the many are the Palazzi Barbaro, Ca&#x27; Rezzonico, Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro, Palazzo Dario, Ca&#x27; Foscari, Palazzo Barbarigo and to Palazzo Venier dei Leoni, housing the Peggy Guggenheim Collection. The churches along the canal include the basilica of Santa Maria della Salute. Centuries-old traditions, such as the , are perpetuated every year along the Canal.

Because most of the city&#x27;s traffic goes along the Canal rather than across it, only one bridge crossed the canal until the 19th century, the Rialto Bridge. There are currently three more bridges, the Ponte degli Scalzi, the Ponte dell&#x27;Accademia, and the controversial Ponte della Costituzione from 2008, designed by Santiago Calatrava, connecting the train station to Piazzale Roma, one of the few places in Venice where buses and cars can enter. As was usual in the past, people can still take a ferry ride across the canal at several points by standing up on the deck of a simple gondola called a &quot;traghetto&quot;, although this service is less common than even a decade ago.

Most of the palaces emerge from water without pavement. Consequently, one can only tour past the fronts of the buildings on the grand canal by boat.

== History ==

=== The first settlements ===
The Grand Canal probably follows the course of an ancient river (possibly a branch of the Brenta) flowing into the lagoon. Adriatic Veneti groups already lived beside the formerly-named &quot;Rio Businiacus&quot; before the Roman age. They lived in stilt houses and relied on fishing and commerce (mainly salt). Under the rule of the Roman Empire and later of the Byzantine Empire the lagoon became populated and important, and in the early 9th century the doge moved his seat from Malamocco to the safer &quot;Rivoaltus&quot;.

Increasing trade followed the doge and found in the deep Grand Canal a safe and ship accessible canal-port. Drainage reveals that the city became more compact over time: at that time the Canal was wider and flowed between small, tide-subjected islands connected by wooden bridges.

=== &quot;Fondaco&quot; houses ===

Along the Canal, the number of &quot;fondaco&quot; houses increased, buildings combining the warehouse and the merchant&#x27;s residence.

A portico (the &quot;curia&quot;) covers the bank and facilitates the ships&#x27; unloading. From the portico a corridor flanked by storerooms reaches a posterior courtyard. Similarly, on the first floor a loggia as large as the portico illuminates the hall into which open the merchant&#x27;s rooms. The façade is thereby divided into an airy central part and two more solid sides. A low mezzanine with offices divides the two floors.

The fondaco house often had lateral defensive towers (&quot;torreselle&quot;), as in the Fondaco dei Turchi (13th century, heavily restored in the 19th). With the German warehouse, the Fondaco dei Tedeschi (which is also situated on the Grand Canal), it reflects the high number of foreign merchants working in Venice, where the republic supplied them with storerooms and lodging and simultaneously controlled their trading activity.

More public buildings were built along the Canal at Rialto: palaces for commercial and financial Benches (Palazzo dei Camerlenghi and Palazzo dei Dieci Savi, rebuilt after 1514 fire) and a mint. In 1181 Nicolò Barattieri constructed a pontoon bridge connecting Rialto to Mercerie area, which was later replaced by a wooden bridge with shops on it. Warehouses for flour and salt were more peripheral.

=== The Venetian-Byzantine style ===
From the Byzantine empire, goods arrived together with sculptures, friezes, columns and capitals to decorate the fondaco houses of patrician families. The Byzantine art merged with previous elements resulting in a Venetian-Byzantine style; in architecture, it was characterized by large loggias with round or elongated arches and by polychrome marbles abundance.

Along the Grand Canal, these elements are well preserved in Ca&#x27; Farsetti, Ca&#x27; Loredan (both municipal seats) and Ca&#x27; da Mosto, all dating back to the 12th or 13th century. During this period Rialto had an intense building development, determining the conformation of the Canal and surrounding areas. As a matter of fact, in Venice building materials are precious and foundations are usually kept: in the subsequent restorations, existing elements will be used again, mixing the Venetian-Byzantine and the new styles (Ca&#x27; Sagredo, Palazzo Bembo). Polychromy, three-partitioned façades, loggias, diffuse openings, and rooms disposition formed a particular architectural taste that continued in the future.

The Fourth Crusade, with the loot obtained from the sack of Constantinople (1204), and other historical situations, gave Venice an Eastern influence until the late 14th century.

=== Venetian Gothic ===

Venetian Gothic architecture found favor quite late, as a splendid flamboyant Gothic (&quot;gotico fiorito&quot;) beginning with the southern façade of the Doge&#x27;s Palace. The verticality and the illumination characterizing the Gothic style are found in the porticos and loggias of fondaco houses: columns get thinner, elongated arches are replaced by pointed or ogee or lobed ones. Porticos rise gently intertwining and drawing open marbles in quatrefoils or similar figures. Façades were plastered in brilliant colors.

The open marble fascias, often called &quot;laces&quot;, quickly diffused along the Grand Canal. Among the 15th-century palaces still showing the original appearance are Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro, Palazzo Bernardo a San Polo, Ca&#x27; Foscari (now housing the University of Venice), Palazzo Pisani Moretta, Palazzi Barbaro, Palazzo Cavalli-Franchetti.

=== Renaissance ===
By the start of the 15th century, Renaissance architecture motifs appear in such buildings as the Palazzo Dario and the Palazzo Corner Spinelli; the latter was designed by Mauro Codussi, pioneer of this style in Venice. Ca&#x27; Vendramin Calergi, another of his projects (now hosting the Casino), reveals a completed transition: the numerous and large windows with open marbles are round-arched and have columns in the three classical orders.

Classical architecture is more evident in Jacopo Sansovino&#x27;s projects, who arrived from Rome in 1527. Along the Canal, he designed Palazzo Corner and Palazzo Dolfin Manin, known for grandiosity, for the horizontal layout of the white façades and for the development around a central courtyard. Other Renaissance buildings are Palazzo Papadopoli and Palazzo Grimani di San Luca. Several palaces of this period had façades with frescoes by painters such as Il Pordenone, Tintoretto, Paolo Veronese, all of them unfortunately lost. Particularly noteworthy were the frescoes by Veronese and Zelotti on Ca Cappello, overlooking the Grand Canal at the intersection with the Rio de S. Polo.

=== Venetian Baroque ===

In 1582, Alessandro Vittoria began the construction of Palazzo Balbi (now housing the Government of Veneto), in which Baroque elements can be recognized: fashioned cornices, broken pediments, ornamental motifs.

The major Baroque architect in Venice was Baldassarre Longhena. In 1631 he began to build the magnificent Santa Maria della Salute basilica, one of the most beautiful churches in Venice and a symbol of Grand Canal. The classical layout of the façade features decorations and by many statues, the latter crowning also the refined volutes surrounding the major dome.

Longhena later designed two majestic palaces, Ca&#x27; Pesaro and Ca&#x27; Rezzonico (with many carvings and chiaroscuro effects), and Santa Maria di Nazareth church (&quot;Chiesa degli Scalzi&quot;). For various reasons the great architect did not see any of these buildings finished, and the designs for all but Santa Maria Della Salute were modified after his death.

Longhena&#x27;s themes recur in the two older façades of Palazzo Labia, containing a famous fresco cycle by Giambattista Tiepolo. In the Longhenian school grew Domenico Rossi (San Stae&#x27;s façade, Ca&#x27; Corner della Regina) and Giorgio Massari, who later completed Ca&#x27; Rezzonico.

The 16th and 17th centuries mark the beginning of the Republic&#x27;s decline, but nevertheless, they saw the highest building activity on the Grand Canal. This can be partially explained by the increasing number of families (like the Labia) becoming patrician by the payment of an enormous sum to the Republic, which was then facing financial difficulties. Once these families had achieved this new status, they built themselves with impressive residences on the Canal, often inducing other families to renew theirs.

=== Neoclassical architecture ===
Neoclassical architectures along the Canal date to the 18th century: during the first half was built San Simeone Piccolo, with an impressive corinthian portico, central plan and a high copper-covered dome ending in a cupola shaped as a temple. Date to the second half Massari&#x27;s Palazzo Grassi.

=== Modern era ===

After the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797, much of the palatial construction in Venice was suspended, as symbolized by the unfinished San Marcuola and Palazzo Venier dei Leoni (housing the Peggy Guggenheim Collection). The Patrician families, bereft of their hereditary role in governance and sometimes persecuted by revolutionary forces, sought other residences. Several historical palaces were pulled down, but many found other uses, and some restorations have saved their 18th-century appearance. By the late 20th century, most of the more prominent palaces were owned by the city, state, or civic institutions.

During the era of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, the Napoleonic suppression of the monastic religious orders vacated large sectors of real estate in the city. It also freed large amounts of furnishings and works of art into the antiquarian market or into the possession of the state. Large monasteries changed functions: the &quot;Santa Maria della Carità&quot; complex became a museum, the Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia; the Santa Croce complex, was converted into the Papadopoli Gardens area; and the Santa Lucia complex (partially designed by Palladio) was razed for the establishment of the Santa Lucia Station.

The Kingdom of Italy accession restored serenity in the city and stimulated construction along the Grand Canal respecting its beauty, often reproduced in Gothic Revival architectures like the Pescaria at Rialto.

== Events ==
=== Historical Regatta ===
On the first Sunday of September the Historical Regatta (&quot;Regata Storica&quot;) takes place, a competition between Venetian boats watched by thousands of people from the banks or from floating stands. Competitions are preceded by a historical procession (&quot;Corteo Storico&quot;) remembering the entrance of the Queen of Cyprus Catherine Cornaro after abdication in 1489: gondoliers in costumes sail in typical 16th century boats following the Bucentaur, doge&#x27;s state galley.

=== The Feast-day of the Madonna della Salute ===
On November 21, Venetians thank the Virgin Mary for salvation from the plague epidemic in 1630-38 with a pilgrimage to Santa Maria della Salute. Pilgrims cross the Grand Canal on a temporary pontoon bridge from Campo Santa Maria del Giglio, and enjoy stalls and traditional dishes.

<text>Changi Prison Complex, often known simply as Changi Prison, is a prison complex in the namesake district of Changi in the eastern part of Singapore. It is the oldest and largest prison in the country, covering an area of about . Opened in 1936, the prison has a rich history.

Changi Prison was first built in 1936 by the British colonial government to replace Outram Prison that was located in Pearl&#x27;s Hill. The prison was constructed with the intention of housing a large number of prisoners, as Singapore was rapidly growing and needed a larger facility to accommodate them. The prison was designed to house up to 600 prisoners. During World War II and after the Fall of Singapore, Changi Prison became notorious for its role as a prisoner-of-war camp for Allied soldiers captured by the Japanese. During the occupation, the Japanese used the prison to house prisoners of war (POW) captured from all over the Asia-Pacific. Many of these prisoners were subjected to brutal treatment and forced labour, and a significant number died from malnutrition, disease, and mistreatment.

After the war, Changi Prison was used by the British to house prisoners of various categories, including political detainees. In the 1950s and 1960s, the prison became a symbol of Singapore&#x27;s struggle for independence, as many political prisoners were held there for their anti-colonial and nationalist activities. The prison also played a significant role in Singapore&#x27;s development after its independence, as many prisoners were put to work in various industries, such as farming and construction. In the 1970s and 1980s, Changi Prison underwent major renovations and upgrades to improve its facilities and security. New buildings were constructed, including a maximum-security block for high-risk prisoners.

Changi Prison remains in operation as a crucial component of Singapore&#x27;s criminal justice system. The prison is well-known for its strict discipline and emphasis on rehabilitation, with a focus on providing prisoners with rehabilitation programs such as education and vocational training to help them rebuild their lives and reintegrate into society after their release. The Changi Chapel and Museum is also located close to the prison.

==History==
===First prison===
Prior to Changi Prison, the only penal facility in Singapore was at Pearl&#x27;s Hill, beside the barracks of Sepoy Lines, and was known as the Singapore Prison. By the 1930s, the Singapore Prison was overcrowded and deemed dangerous. The Singapore Prison had a capacity of 1,080. In the early 1920s, the average daily number of convicts was 1,043; it reached 1,311 by 1931. Thus the 1931 report presented by the newly appointed Inspector of Prisons for the Straits Settlements, and the Superintendent of Singapore Prisons, Captain Otho Lewis Hancock, recommended providing additional accommodation. This would enable the authorities to segregate long-term prisoners, likely to be of special danger to the community, from short-term prisoners while relieving congestion in the existing facility. Deliberations in the Legislative Council saw opposition to the subsequent plans for constructing a new prison at Changi due to uncertainties in the numbers planned for the accommodation (ranging between 650 and 2,500), costs (moving from 2 million Straits dollars to 10 million Straits dollars and back), the area to be used (250 acres to 1,500 acres), and the possibility of the new prison grounds turning into a white elephant.

Tenders to construct the grounds of the new prison at Changi were put out in 1933. The tender for erection and completion of the quarters was first awarded to Hup Thye and Co for 16,900 Straits dollars on 26 June 1933, and a 2 September 1933 tender for the prison blocks was reportedly awarded to Chop Woh Hup, a local Chinese construction firm, for 1,278,000 Straits dollars on 8 March 1934. Chop Woh Hup had 20 months to complete the construction of the prison blocks. The new prison would be 11.5 miles away from the Singapore settlement along the Changi Road and provide accommodation for 568 prisoners. Completed in 1936, within the 24 feet high, 3,000 feet long prison walls that were made of reinforced concrete, and occupying 13 acres of land, there would be:

# An Administration Block and General Store
# One European Block of Cells and Workshops
# Two Asiatic Blocks of Cells and Workshops
# Kitchen and Laundry Blocks
# Hospital Block
# Recalcitrant and Punishment Blocks

Within the prison walls, there was an inner wall, 14 feet high, exercise yards, and sufficient vacant land to double the accommodation in the future. Outside the wall, 88 acres of land was set aside for gardening activities by the prisoners. Additional quarters were provided for prison staff adjacent to the prison:

# Superintendent&#x27;s Quarters
# Chief Gaoler&#x27;s Quarters
# Assistant Medical Officer&#x27;s Quarters
# Two Deputy Gaolers and 26 European Warders&#x27; Quarters
# Asiatic Chief Warder&#x27;s Quarters
# Nine Blocks of 12 quarters for Asiatic Warders and Attendants
# Ten Quarters for Clerks and Dressers.

Along with additional contracts for water supply and sewage disposal, the total estimated costs of the new establishment came out at 2,050,000 Straits dollars. A subsidiary settlement was developed to support an enterprise of small Chinese traders who would provide necessities to the staff and the prison.
When it was officially operational in June 1937, it was claimed to be one of the best prisons in the British Empire. The design of the prison was based on a T-shaped structure, with two cell-block wings stretching out from a central main block (for administration areas and warden-offices), to allow for quick and easy access to either cell-block wing for the wardens whenever necessary (from up above, the prison buildings formed the shape of the top of a telegram/telephone pole). Changi Prison also boasted the use of an advanced and extensive alarm system and had electrical lighting in its cells along with flush-toilets in each. The prison had a holding capacity of 600. Long-term prisoners would be transferred from the existing Singapore Prison.

The death row section of Changi Prison consisted of 24 cells arranged in a horse shoe shaped block around an open air grassy exercise yard. The exercise area itself was enclosed in steel bars and had a wire mesh roof to prevent escape by helicopter. The cells were about three square metres (32 square feet) in size, with bare concrete walls on three sides and the remaining side consisting of vertical steel bars facing out into the block. The building also contained the gallows where judicial hangings were performed, and condemned inmates had a final walk of about 20 meters from their cell to the execution chamber.

=== Conversion into a prisoner of war camp ===
During World War II, following the Fall of Singapore in February 1942, the Japanese military detained approximately 3,000 civilians in Changi Prison, which was built to house only one-fifth of that number. The Japanese used the British Army&#x27;s Selarang Barracks, near the prison, as a prisoner of war camp, holding some 50,000 Allied soldiers, predominantly British and Australian, and from 1943, Dutch civilians brought over by the Japanese from the islands in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). In the UK, Australia, The Netherlands and elsewhere, the name &quot;Changi&quot; became synonymous with the infamous POW camp nearby, since most of the Japanese prisons were in the Changi area. Around 500 detainees were women who had been separated with their children and marched to the cramped prison camp from their homes. These women and also girls sewed quilts for the prison hospital, daringly embroidering their own secret symbols and stories into the squares, including forget-me-nots, butterflies, angels, scenery of trees and sheep, other symbolic flowers and even a domestic sitting room, ships, birds and a map of Scotland, and one of Australia. They risked severe punishments by sewing, depicting their prison environment and adding dozens, or even over 400 names in one case, onto the cloths. One depicted the Changi Stroll, the forced march of the captive women and children over nine miles to the prison under the occupation by the Japanese on 8 March 1942, coincidentally now International Women&#x27;s Day commemorating women and the defiance of the suffragettes. Surviving examples of the prison handiwork are in the archives of the British Red Cross, Imperial War Museum, London or held at the Australian War Memorial. About 850 POWs died during their internment in Changi during the Japanese occupation of Singapore, a relatively low rate compared to the overall death rate of 27% for POWs in Japanese camps. However, many more prisoners died after being transferred from Changi to various labour camps outside Singapore, including those on the Burma Railway and at Sandakan airfield.

Allied POWs, mainly Australians, built a chapel at the prison in 1944, using simple tools and found materials. Stanley Warren of the 15th Regiment, Royal Regiment of Artillery painted a series of murals at the chapel. Another British POW, Sgt. Harry Stodgen, built a Christian cross out of a used artillery shell. After the war, the chapel was dismantled and shipped to Australia, while the cross was sent to the UK. The chapel was reconstructed in 1988, and is now located at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, Canberra. The prisoners of war also established an education program nicknamed the Changi University.

After the war, Changi Prison was used by the British to hold Japanese prisoners of war, which included former Imperial Japanese Army, Imperial Japanese Navy and &quot;Kempeitai&quot; personnel, police officers and POW camp guards; British troops were used as &quot;ad hoc&quot; prison officers. Most of the prisoners of war were eventually repatriated to Japan, but eight former &quot;Kempeitai&quot; members were found guilty by a military tribunal of torturing 57 internees (which resulted in 15 of them dying) in the &quot;Double tenth&quot; trial on 18 March 1946 at the Supreme Court Building and were sentenced to death. In the inner yard of the prison, three gallows were erected to carry out the sentences, which were performed in April 1946. On 17 October 1945, 260 German prisoners of war (who were former &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; personnel and had served on U-boats) were moved from Pasir Panjang to Changi Prison. Almost a year later on 26 June 1946, all German prisoners of war in the prison were notified that they would be repatriated back to Germany via England on a passenger liner, the &quot;Empress of Australia&quot;.

====Kempeitai====
The prison also contained the headquarters of the &quot;Kempeitai&quot;, the Japanese military police. The Kempeitai tortured and executed prisoners there, who they suspected were spies, such as during the Double Tenth incident. Most were civilians, although a small number were Allied POWs.

===Changi Chapel and Museum===

The original open-air chapel, built by the POWs in 1944, was later relocated to Duntroon, Canberra.

In 1988, Singapore built a replica chapel, next to the Changi Prison. The project included a museum. When Changi Prison was expanded in 2001, the chapel and museum were relocated to a new site away, officially reopening on 15 February 2001. On 1 April 2018, the museum was closed and reopened in 2020.

In 1994, Changi Women&#x27;s Prison and Drug Rehabilitation Centre was opened.

==Demolition and redevelopment==
In 2000, a plan was revealed to consolidate the 14 prisons and drug rehabilitation centres (DRCs) that were scattered across the country into one mega complex at Changi Prison location. The complex would sit on a site of area 48ha at a cost of S$1.07 billion; however, freeing up 61ha of land, which would make way for residential development. The complex would occupy on the lands of existing Changi Prison, Moon Crescent Prison and Jalan Awan Prison.

The plan was carried out in phases, with each phase forming a cluster of prison institutions in the complex. Cluster A was officially launched on 16 August 2004. Cluster A would house the inmates from the existing Changi Prison, Moon Crescent Prison, Jalan Awan Prison and the Changi Reformative Training Centre.

Cluster B was officially launched on 20 January 2010. Cluster B would house 5,600 inmates from standalone prisons: Tanah Merah Prison, Queenstown Remand Prison, Sembawang DRC, Khalsa Crescent Prison, and Selarang Park DRC. The inmates were moved in five separate, single day operations between July and August 2009, making it the largest transfer of prisoners in Singapore history. Cluster B would eventually become the start and the end of most prisoners&#x27; journey within the complex, with the admissions and pre-release procedures carried out in the buildings of this cluster.

In 2012, work on building the SPS headquarters on the Complex&#x27;s grounds began with the $118.5 million contract awarded to Sembawang Engineers and Constructors (SEC). The building would contain a hydrogen integrated proton-exchange membrane fuel cell power plant to generate clean energy to be supplied to the complex. Due by 2014, it was delayed due to financial troubles faced by SEC. On 15 October 2017, Changi Women&#x27;s Prison was effectively moved into Cluster A. On 4 July 2018, Admiralty West Prison was effectively relocated to TM2, the yet-to-be demolished facilities of Tanah Merah Prison.

===Preservation efforts===
Towards the end of 2003, Australian authorities lobbied the Singapore government to preserve the old Changi Prison after knowing that the old Changi Prison would be demolished by April 2004 to redevelop the land for Cluster B, on the basis of its historical significance where 15,000 Australians were imprisoned after Singapore fell to imperial Japan in 1942. On 8 March 2004, a decision was made to preserve the old prison&#x27;s iconic front walls, front gates and two guard-towers at either end of the wall, which was welcomed by Australian&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer. 

====Changi Chapel and Museum====
In 2016, the historical remnants of the old prison – the entrance gate, wall and turrets – was gazetted as the 72nd National Monument of Singapore. The entrance gate was moved from the adjacent boundary wall and fitted into the retained wall. The Changi Chapel and Museum reopened in 2021 to the public.

==Current prison==
Presently, the new Changi Prison Complex houses the most serious criminals in the country, including those serving long sentences (including life imprisonment) and those sentenced to death. It serves as the detention site for death row inmates at Changi before they are executed by hanging, traditionally at dawn on a Friday, except twice, one on 20 May 2016 when the execution of Kho Jabing was carried out at 3:30 pm after his appeal for a stay of execution was dismissed that same morning, as well as on 27 April 2022 when the execution of Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam was carried out on a Wednesday instead of a Friday.

Changi Prison Complex is also where judicial corporal punishment, in the form of caning, is carried out. Caning sessions at Changi are reportedly held twice per week.

<text>The Raffles Junior College (RJC) was a junior college in Singapore offering pre-university education. The college was founded in 1982, following a separation from the pre-university section of Raffles Institution (RI). Raffles Junior College was merged as the junior college section of Raffles Institution on 1 January 2009.

To date, the former junior college and the current Raffles Institution (Year 5-6) has produced 94 President&#x27;s Scholars and the bulk of Public Service Commission scholars. RJC was recognised as one of the top feeder schools for the Ivy League universities.

==History==
=== Founding years ===
In 1982, Raffles Institution&#x27;s pre-university section was transferred from Grange Road to a temporary campus at Paterson Road. There, Raffles Junior College was established to offer the GCE A Level curriculum. It was the first junior college to be established with both JC1 and JC2 students, with the JC2 students having just completed their first pre-university year in the pre-university section of RI.

Raffles Junior College moved into a purpose built campus on 53 Mount Sinai Road in 1984 which provided better facilities and a larger site to cater to junior college education.

=== Introduction of the Raffles Programme ===
In 2004, the integrated programme of Raffles Institution, Raffles Girls&#x27; School, and Raffles Junior College, branded the Raffles Programme, was rolled out. On the same year, RJC was relocated to its new Bishan campus at 1 Raffles Institution Lane, adjacent to Raffles Institution. The two schools ran an open campus, allowing students to share facilities between the two institutions. This laid the foundation for the development of the Raffles Programme. A moving ceremony was held on 29 December 2004.

On 1 January 2005, the college became an independent institution. In the same year, RJC became the first junior college to be awarded the School Excellence Award, the highest award in the MOE Masterplan of Awards. The new campus was officially declared open by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 8 April 2006, in conjunction with the college&#x27;s 25th anniversary celebrations.

=== Reintegration with Raffles Institution ===
On 1 January 2009, Raffles Junior College re-merged into Raffles Institution to facilitate running of the Integrated Programme. The college section (Year 5–6) kept the name as Raffles Institution (Junior College) until 2010, after which it was officially renamed as Raffles Institution. This administrative merger allowed the new institution to function as a single educational organisation on the foundation of a shared campus.

==Principals==
* Rudy Mosbergen (1982–1987)
* Lee Fong Seng (1988–2000)
* Winston James Hodge (2001–2007)
* Lim Lai Cheng (2008–2009)

==Culture and identity==
===College anthem===
Raffles Junior College shared the same anthem, &quot;Auspicium Melioris Aevi,&quot; with Raffles Institution. The anthem was written by E W Jesudason in 1961, who served as headmaster of Raffles Institution from 1963 to 1966.

===Coat of arms===
Raffles Junior College shared its crest with Raffles Institution, a modified version of the Raffles coat of arms, permission for use of which was granted by his family. This replaces the original erminois portion of the field with gold and the purpure of the gryphon crest with gules.

The gryphon on the crest is a stately creature, majestic and strong, symbolising stability and success for the school. The double-headed eagle on the shield signifies the looking back onto the past and onto the future, symbolising the institution&#x27;s tradition of drawing strength and experience from the past to excel in the future.

The motto &quot;Auspicium Melioris Aevi&quot;, displayed at the base of the shield, is officially translated as &quot;Hope of a Better Age&quot;. While a mistranslation, this has become the standard version. It is also the motto of the Order of St Michael and St George.

===House system===
RJC had a faculty system in place before May 2005. Under the faculty system, students belonged to one of the five faculties, namely: Arts (red), Commerce (black), Computing and Pure Science (green), Engineering (blue) and Medicine (yellow). To facilitate the Raffles Programme from 2005, students of Raffles Junior College were divided into five Houses, the name of which is an amalgamation of its counterparts in RI and RGS: Bayley-Waddle (yellow); Buckle-Buckley (green) ; Hadley-Hullett (purple/black); Morrison-Richardson (blue); Moor-Tarbet (red).

Students from the Raffles Programme remained in the same House for the entire six years, while students enrolled into RJC via the Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) were assigned to a House upon admission. Houses compete in Inter-House Competitions (IHC) annually. Organised by the Students&#x27; Council, the events span across disciplines and challenge participants both physically and mentally. The IHC Remix is generally held earlier in the year and comprises the non-Sports events whilst IHC Sports is held later in the year.

This arrangement is retained with the merger of RJC into RI in January 2009.

== Affiliation ==
Between 2005 and 2009, Raffles Junior College co-ran the Raffles Programme (Integrated Programme) with Raffles Institution and Raffles Girls&#x27; School (RGS). In the programme, boys receive their first four years of secondary education in RI and girls in RGS, before completing their pre-university studies in the co-educational Raffles Junior College.

== Campus ==
The most recent campus of the former RJC, currently RI&#x27;s Year 5–6 campus consists of 11 blocks and three fields. Facilities include six lecture theatres, a Performing Arts Centre, the Singapore Pools Indoor Sports Hall and the Shaw Foundation Library. 

== Curriculum ==

=== Raffles Academy ===

Started in 2007 in Raffles Institution, prior to the 2009 RI-RJC merger, the Raffles Academy was a talent development programme designed to meet the learning needs of students exceptionally gifted in a particular subject. The programme originally spanned Years 3 and 4 but in 2009 was expanded to Years 5 and 6.

The Year 5–6 Raffles Academy offers four subjects, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics, of which students can offer up to two, although Mathematics may be offered only with Physics and Biology with Chemistry. Students in the Raffles Academy attend pull-out lectures and tutorials as well as a weekly enrichment session, although they follow the H2 curriculum.

At the end of Year 4, students may apply for the Year 5–6 Raffles Academy by submitting a personal statement and portfolio, and sitting for a selection test. Approximately 100 students per batch are selected for the Raffles Academy.

=== Raffles Humanities Programme ===
The Humanities Scholarship Programme is the Arts equivalent of the Raffles Academy for sciences, accepting exceptionally gifted humanities students who take the Arts subjects (including but not limited to Literature, Economics, History, Geography, English Language and Linguistics). Students can enter this elite programme either through internal interviews or via the Ministry of Education (MOE) Scholarship route. Students accepted into the programme are placed in separate classes from the mainstream Arts classes and occupy a distinct Humanities building within the school, complete with their own lecture hall and classrooms. Lessons conducted under the programme aim to be more interactive, involving students in discussions to a greater extent so as to promote critical thinking skills. Over the course of the programme, Humanities Programme (HP) students benefit from various enrichment activities including weekly guest speakers and humanities workshops. Apart from that, students also have to opportunity to embark on overseas trips to Asia countries such as Japan and South Korea.

==Achievements==
Raffles Junior College / Raffles Institution (Junior College) has produced 94 President&#x27;s Scholars since Singapore&#x27;s independence in 1965, a notable record among Singapore schools.

<text>Sembawang is a planning area and residential town located in the North Region of Singapore. Sembawang planning area is bordered by Simpang to the east, Mandai to the south, Yishun to the southeast, Woodlands to the west and the Straits of Johor to the north.

Despite the relatively large development in the Sembawang New Town, the area remains largely suburban, with military, industrial and recreational facilities at its periphery. It hosted a major naval base and port facilities since the early 20th century, and continues to handle regular shipping traffic today along its wharves. 

Sembawang has nine subzones, these are Admiralty, Sembawang Central, Sembawang East, Sembawang North, Sembawang Springs, Sembawang Straits, Senoko North, Senoko South and the Wharves. 

==Etymology==
The earliest reference to Sembawang is found in Franklin and Jackson&#x27;s 1830 &quot;Map of Singapore&quot;, which refers to the River Tambuwang. The place is said to have got its name from the &quot;pokok sembawang&quot; (Malay for the &quot;kayae ferruginea&quot;&quot;),&quot; which has been renamed &quot;Mesua ferruginea&quot; from 1980. This tree can be seen at Sembawang Park.

==History==
The Sembawang area in the early twentieth century was the site of the Nee Soon Rubber estate. During colonial times, Sembawang was home to a major British naval base, the construction of which began in 1928 and was completed in 1938. The base included dockyards, wharves and workshops, as well as supporting administrative, residential and commercial areas. The Naval Base has since been handed over to the Singapore government, which in 1968 converted it into a commercial dockyard (as Sembawang Shipyard, now part of Singapore Exchange-listed SembCorp Marine) that went on to become SembCorp, a major state-owned industrial conglomerate.

Extensive land reclamation throughout Singapore has left Sembawang with one of the country&#x27;s last natural beaches, the Wak Hassan Beach located at Sembawang Park. Today, the vegetable farms, rubber plantations and Chinese graveyards surrounding the former naval base have given way to modern housing, especially in the 1990s during the development of a New Town by the Singapore Housing and Development Board. The town remains a major port, with Sembawang Wharves handling a high volume of bulk commodities cargo, such as timber and rubber.

The planning of Sembawang New Town started in 1996 where the Woodlands MRT Extension was opened, and Sembawang MRT station was also opened at the same time. When the station was opened, the area was undeveloped except the Canberra Road and the then-developing Sembawang New Town. This was resolved in 1998 because of the accelerating development of Sembawang New Town, which was completed in 2004. These HDB flats were within Sembawang, Canberra and Gambas division.

In late 2022, Sembawang had their first hawker centre and polyclinic at Bukit Canberra, which opened progressively from July 2022 onwards.

==Politics==
Sembawang once begun as a constituency named Seletar but later carved out forming a dedicated Sembawang Single Member Constituency beginning in the 1955, then resized to a smaller constituency leaving only the northern areas.

Sembawang has always been held by the People&#x27;s Action Party since its formation and has been expanded to include subregions of Admiralty and Canberra since it became a Group Representation Constituency. Former President of Singapore Tony Tan Keng Yam was one of the notable Members of Parliament of Sembawang, and was succeeded by former Tanjong Pagar GRC Member of Parliament and former Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan beginning in the General Election 2006, followed by Health Minister Ong Ye Kung beginning in General Election 2015 who was then joined by Poh Li San beginning in General Election 2020.

== Military ==

The completion of Royal Navy&#x27;s Singapore Naval Base (also known as HMS Sembawang) in 1938 and RAF Sembawang (also known as HMS Simbang) in March 1940 marked the start of military presence in Sembawang. In February 1942, both bases were partially torched and wrecked by the retreating British forces during the Battle of Singapore to deny their use by units of the advancing Imperial Japanese Army. After the end of World War II in 1945, both bases were reverted to British control and would eventually go on to play an important part in Britain&#x27;s continued military presence in the Far East (along with the three other RAF bases in Singapore: RAF Changi, RAF Seletar and RAF Tengah) during the critical period of Malayan Emergency (1948–1960), the Brunei Revolt in 1962 and during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation (1962–1966).

Despite the withdrawal of some part of British forces from Singapore in 1971 and the handover of the Singapore Naval Base to Singaporean Government in 1968, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) continues to maintain Naval Base at Sembawang wharf to control most of the foreign military activities there, which includes repair, refuel and resupply for ships of the Australian, British and New Zealand navies as well as those from other Commonwealth countries under the auspices of Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA). This special arrangement was also extended to the United States Navy since early 1960s to support the American involvement in the Vietnam War.

As part of a 1990 agreement between Singapore and the United States, American military forces (primarily naval and air force) have been making use of Sembawang&#x27;s base facilities. The Task Force 73 (and Commander Logistic Group Western Pacific), part of US 7th Fleet, has been headquartered in Sembawang since 1992.

=== Sembawang Camp ===
The Sembawang Camp is a Singapore Armed Forces military base on Admiralty Road, open only to military personnel on official business. The camp houses the 1st and 3rd Transport Battalion of the Singapore Army, as well as the Republic of Singapore Navy&#x27;s Naval Diving Unit (NDU). Also, the compound housing the Naval Diving Unit was previously known as Terror Camp in deference to the old admin and Officers club section of the Royal Naval facility which was called HMS Terror.

== Transportation facilities ==
Sembawang Road is one of the key roads built to connect the naval base to the city centre in the South. This road began as a track in the 1920s and was officially named Sembawang Road in 1938. Buses operated by various private companies were then the main mode of transport. The thoroughfare was also dotted with many villages along its length: Chye Kay Village, Sungei Simpang Village, Chong Pang Village, Sembawang Village. Most of these villages were cleared during the 1970s1990s to make way for Yishun and Sembawang New Towns. The last of the villages, Kampong Wak Hassan, was cleared in 1998. Present day Sembawang Road is a major arterial road linking the Northern and Central portion of Singapore.

Many other roads in Sembawang are named after various Royal Navy dockyards, warships, admirals, countries and cities. Examples include Wellington, Canberra, Canada, Gibraltar, Kenya and Falkland. These names were given during the previous British administration, and reflect the town&#x27;s history as a British naval base.

The main river running through Sembawang, the long Sungei Sembawang, flowed along a winding route and ended to the west of Sembawang Shipyard. Its middle section was diverted in the 1920s to provide the land needed for the British Naval Base. During the 1970s, the Northern portions of the river was straightened and canalized. The Southern portions of the river, which consisted of mangroves, ponds and grassland, was filled in during the 1990s in preparation for the development of Sembawang New Town.

One of the few parks in Singapore with a natural beach, the Wak Hassan Beach, this park is a heaven for city dwellers who are tired of the never-ending concrete buildings and skyscrapers. It is a popular spot for campers as well as families who wish to spend an idyllic day by the beach. One can dine at the Beaulieu House, built in 1910, which was the residence of Admiral Sir Geoffrey Layton (Commander-in-Chief British Eastern Fleet, 1940–1942). A wide range of fauna and flora awaits visitors, ranging from the spectacular cannonball tree (&quot;Couroupita guianensis&quot;) to the many species of birds which have made the park their nesting grounds. Within the park is a Battleship-themed outdoor playground that pays tribute to the area&#x27;s naval history. 
* Sembawang Hot Spring Park is the only hot spring park found in Singapore. It is located along [Gambas Avenue] near the junction with Sembawang Road. It reopened on 4 January 2020 after upgrading works, and now features a cascading pool and cafe. Main attractions here are dipping your feet in the spring water and cooking eggs in the spring water.
* The Sembwang Park Connector is part of the Park Connector Network managed by the National Parks Board. As their name imply, these connectors aim to form a continuous loop which would hopefully connect all the major parks is a planning area and residential town located the North Region of Singapore. Sembawang planning area is bordered by Simpang to the east, Mandai to the south, Yishun to the southeast, Woodlands to the west and the Straits of Johor to the north.

<doc id="651604" wikidata="Q1363554" url="?curid=651604" title="Financial analysis">
<text>Financial analysis (also known as financial statement analysis, accounting analysis, or analysis of finance) refers to an assessment of the viability, stability, and profitability of a business, sub-business, project or investment. 

It is performed by professionals who prepare reports using ratios and other techniques, that make use of information taken from financial statements and other reports. These reports are usually presented to top management as one of their bases in making business decisions. 
Financial analysis may determine if a business will:

*Continue or discontinue its main operation or part of its business;
*Make or purchase certain materials in the manufacture of its product;
*Acquire or rent/lease certain machineries and equipment in the production of its goods;
*Issue shares or negotiate for a bank loan to increase its working capital;
*Make decisions regarding investing or lending capital;
*Make other decisions that allow management to make an informed selection on various alternatives in the conduct of its business.

== Firm-level analysis==
Financial analysts often assess the following elements of a firm:

# Profitability - its ability to earn income and sustain growth in both the short- and long-term. A company&#x27;s degree of profitability is usually based on the income statement, which reports on the company&#x27;s results of operations;
# Solvency - its ability to pay its obligation to creditors and other third parties in the long-term; 
# Liquidity - its ability to maintain positive cash flow, while satisfying immediate obligations;
# Stability - the firm&#x27;s ability to remain in business in the long run, without having to sustain significant losses in the conduct of its business. Assessing a company&#x27;s stability requires the use of both the income statement and the balance sheet, as well as other financial and non-financial indicators.

Both 2 and 3 are based on the company&#x27;s balance sheet, which indicates the financial condition of a business as of a given point in time.

== Techniques==
Financial analysts often compare financial ratios (of solvency, profitability, growth, etc.):

* Past Performance - Across historical time periods for the same firm (the last 5 years for example),
* Future Performance - Using historical figures and certain mathematical and statistical techniques, including present and future values, This extrapolation method is the main source of errors in financial analysis as past statistics can be poor predictors of future prospects.
* Comparative Performance - Comparison between similar firms

Comparing financial ratios is merely one way of conducting financial analysis. 
Financial analysts can also use percentage analysis which involves reducing a series of figures as a percentage of some base amount. For example, a group of items can be expressed as a percentage of net income. When proportionate changes in the same figure over a given time period expressed as a percentage is known as horizontal analysis.

Vertical or common-size analysis reduces all items on a statement to a &quot;common size&quot; as a percentage of some base value which assists in comparability with other companies of different sizes. As a result, all Income Statement items are divided by Sales, and all Balance Sheet items are divided by Total Assets.

Another method is comparative analysis. This provides a better way to determine trends. Comparative analysis presents the same information for two or more time periods and is presented side-by-side to allow for easy analysis.

==Theoretical challenges==
Financial ratios face several theoretical challenges:

* They say little about the firm&#x27;s prospects in an absolute sense. Their insights about relative performance require a reference point from other time periods or similar firms.
* One ratio holds little meaning. As indicators, ratios can be logically interpreted in at least two ways. One can partially overcome this problem by combining several related ratios to paint a more comprehensive picture of the firm&#x27;s performance.
* Seasonal factors may prevent year-end values from being representative. A ratio&#x27;s values may be distorted as account balances change from the beginning to the end of an accounting period. Use average values for such accounts whenever possible.
* Financial ratios are no more objective than the accounting methods employed. Changes in accounting policies or choices can yield drastically different ratio values.

<text>A military parade is a formation of soldiers whose movement is restricted by close-order manoeuvering known as drilling or marching. Large military parades are today held on major holidays and military events around the world. Massed parades may also hold a role for propaganda purposes, being used to exhibit the apparent military strength of a country.

==History==
A military parade is a formation of soldiers whose movement is restricted by close-order manoeuvering known as drilling or marching. The terminology comes from the tradition of close order formation combat, in which soldiers were held in very strict formations as to maximise their combat effectiveness. Formation combat was used as an alternative to melee combat, and required strict discipline in the ranks and competent officers. Close order formation combat has been phased out by advances in military equipment and tactic, and modern infantry now use skirmish formation and order. However, foot drill is an important part of military education and training to instill pride and discipline among personnel.

In ancient times, drilling increased in importance when men stopped fighting as individuals and began to fight together as units. Drilling as a vital component of a war machine further increased with the increases in the size of armies, for example, when Philip II of Macedon disciplined his army so they could swiftly form the phalanxes that were so critical to his successes as a general. Military drilling later was used by the Roman Army to maximise efficiency and deadliness throughout their long history.

Modern armies use parades for ceremonial purposes, encouragement and show of discipline and to instill confidence in the country&#x27;s military forces.

The U.S. drill is based on the contributions of Baron von Steuben, a Prussian Army officer who served in the Continental Army. During the winter quarters in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, von Steuben taught a model company of 100 soldiers musket drill. These soldiers, in turn, taught the remainder of the Continental Army.

The oldest, largest and most famous regular military parade in Europe is the Bastille Day Military Parade which is held each 14 July, on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, during France&#x27;s national day celebrations.

==Rationale==

A military drill is memorizing certain actions through repetition until the action is instinctive to the soldiers being drilled. Complex actions are broken down into simpler ones which can be practiced in isolation so when the whole is put together the desired results are achieved. Such is necessary for a fighting force to perform at maximum efficiency in all manner of situations. However, depending on the army and the drills it adopts, drilling may destroy flexibility and initiative in exchange for predictability and cohesion.

Recruits in most modern militaries are taught drill to teach them how to work and move as a team. In addition, formations are still used in riot control, where mêlée combat is still the norm.

==Types of military parades==
*Flypast
*Victory parade
*Naval parade
*Pass in review

==Current era==
Drill is today used to demonstrate discipline and cohesion in a modern military force. Large military parades are today held on major holidays and military events around the world. It usually held on occasions of national importance such as a country&#x27;s independence day, and therefore is presided over by the head of state who, in most cases, is the commander in chief of the combined national military forces of that country. Today, military parades include all aspects of military drill, from an exhibition drill of precision drill teams and military bands (in addition to the occasional corps of drums, fanfare band, pipe band and/or drum and bugle corps), as well as an exhibition of military weapons such as a mobile column, the occasional mounted cavalry column (led by a mounted band), a naval parade, and a fly past by the country&#x27;s air force. When on parade, most of the participating soldiers wear their ceremonial uniforms and carry the standards/colours of their respective battalions/regiments/corps/academies. In many countries, the military contingent is joined by contingents from youth cadet organizations, personnel from the police and fire services, civil defense and emergency services and by occasion jail and border services, youth police and fire cadets, veterans and personnel of the civil service with occasional participation by civilian organizations, educational institutions, cultural groups and athletes.

===By country ===
==== Albania ====
Albania has long been influenced by Greek and Italian influences and even Soviet/Russian tradition. During the era of the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania, Liberation Day, which then the main national holiday, was celebrated with a military parade of the Albanian People&#x27;s Army on Tirana&#x27;s Dëshmorët e Kombit Boulevard. These parades have been held in 1954, 1959, 1964, 1974, 1984 and 1989. They usually consist of veterans, schoolchildren, militiamen alongside regular force personnel.

Today, military parades of the Albanian Armed Forces are held on Albanian Flag Day and Constitution Day on 28 November. One of the more notable modern military parades was held on the 100th Anniversary of the Independence of Albania, in which a special unit of 65 soldiers from the Kosovo Security Force, as well as other foreign contingents, participated. The other took place on 4 December 2007 in honor of the 95th anniversary of the Albanian Armed Forces.

==== Australia and New Zealand ====
As both Commonwealth realms, Australia and New Zealand share the customs and traditions of parades of the British Armed Forces. The friendship and cooperation of the defence services of both countries can be seen in the annual Anzac Day parades every 25 April, in memory of the namesake Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, which was heavily involved in the long Battle of Gallipoli and were the first Allied forces to land there on that day in 1915. On this day, in many major cities in these two countries, parades are held involving personnel of both the Australian Defence Force and the New Zealand Defence Force, veterans&#x27; organizations, cadet organizations, and other youth uniformed groups and personnel of the police and fire services, as well as students of schools and universities honoring many of their fallen alumni of the long campaign.

Parades are also held jointly in these two countries on 11 November, Remembrance Day.

Aside from these two days, the schedule of annual military and civil parades held in these two countries is as follows:

==== Bangladesh ====
The Bangladesh Armed Forces parade tradition was inherited from both the Pakistan and British Armed Forces as its first infantry unit, the East Bengal Regiment, was raised in then East Pakistan 1948 from Bengali servicemen who served in the former British Indian Army, whose drills were similar to those in the rest of the Commonwealth.

Uniquely, the parade tradition of the Bolivian Armed Forces is similar to those of Prussia and the German Empire but with the difference that the current march step is at slow time, to enable a knee-high goose step when on the march for most units (others, including recruit battalions and civilian students of the Military Engineering School, march in quick time without the goosestep and following the Bundeswehr practice). The Prussian tradition was introduced to the country in the early 1900s thanks to German and Chilean instructors and officers.

For many years from the Imperial era till today Brazil has witnessed parade after parade held on major national and regional holidays, a tradition maintained till today by the Brazilian Armed Forces. Since the 1960s high-stepping has been a prominent part of parades hosted by the armed forces, a tradition carried over from Portugal, Turkey and Uruguay.

The Bruneian parade tradition shares in the general traditions of the Commonwealth, and it is without any doubt that the British Armed Forces helped develop the parade and ceremonial traditions of the nation, which are today held in high esteem by the country&#x27;s uniformed organizations combined with later Malaysian influence. Today, the Royal Brunei Armed Forces and the Royal Brunei Police Force host public parades on the following dates:

* 18 January, Police Day

==== Canada ====
Within Canada, the now tri-service Ceremonial Guard performs the marchpast for senior dignitaries of the Canadian Armed Forces during change of command ceremonies and state arrival ceremonies, typically held in Ottawa, the national capital. The two Primary Reserve Canadian Army regiments that typically provide personnel for the guard, the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards and The Canadian Grenadier Guards, together with the Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards and guard of honour detachments from both the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force take part in these events. In addition, the CG and optionally both the GGHG and the CGG take part in military parades such as the more common Trooping the Colour, also in Ottawa and special parades during the jubilee years of the monarch or of a national foundation. The CAF personnel, as well as the Canadian Cadet Organizations and military veterans also parade during national holidays such as Remembrance Day, Victoria Day, Canada Day or Canadian Forces Day, as well as during parades celebrating anniversaries of regiments, brigade groups or wings, and divisional level formations and passing out parades of the Royal Military College of Canada, Royal Military College Saint-Jean and recruit training bases, as well as in local holidays in the provinces and major cities. Across the country, the annual Warriors Day military parade has since 1921, been a traditional event of the Canadian National Exhibition. It is specifically devoted to formally recognizing veterans of the CF. Like in the UK, the regimental march of the unit being honored is played by the band and/or pipe band if present.

==== Chile ====
The tradition of military parades in Chile has origins not just in Spanish tradition, but also a mix between those of France, the United Kingdom, and particularly Germany, given the fact that Imperial German Army officers trained the army and navy in the mid-1890s in the Prussian-German traditions of military parades that are continued until today.

Currently, the Chilean Armed Forces and the Carabineros de Chile hold public parades in front of state leaders and the public on

* 21 May – Navy Day – honoring the fallen of the 1879 Battle of Iquique, also marked as a day to celebrate the service personnel, veterans, heroes and martyrs of the Chilean Navy

===== People&#x27;s Republic of China =====
The People&#x27;s Republic of China holds extraordinary military parades in Beijing to celebrate National Day. The first parade of this nature took place right after the proclamation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China by Chairman Mao Zedong on 1 October 1949. Originally celebrated annually, the parade was suspended in 1960, before returning in 1984 to mark the 35th anniversary of the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is now held to mark every tenth anniversary, starting in 1999. Parades were also held in 1964, 1966, 1969 and 1970.

In 2015, China held a military parade to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the victory over Japan. This was the first time China held a military parade for an event other than its National Day.

In 2017, the 90th anniversary since the Nanchang Uprising and the beginning of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army was marked by a military parade, the first time ever that a military parade had been held in its honor and the first time it was held outside of the capital, having been held at Zhurihe Training Base in Inner Mongolia under the direction of General Han Weiguo of the Central Theater Command. This was also the first field parade to take place since September 1981 when a parade consisting of troops participated in an exercise in Zhangjiakou in the presence of Deng Xiaoping to commemorate Deng&#x27;s assumption to the post of Chairman of the Central Military Commission. During that parade, Deng reportedly said &quot;Let&#x27;s hold a large-scale one if we are to hold a military exercise, so that it can be of use&quot; in reference to the size of the parade. Naval parades have also been reintroduced in recent years with a parade (which was the biggest naval review since 1949 and according to the Chinese government, the biggest in 600 years.) being held in the South China Sea in 2018 and a parade for the platinum jubilee of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy being held in early 2019.

Smaller scale parades are also periodically held in Hong Kong, Macau, Tibet and Xinjiang. Every year on 10 March (Tibetan Uprising Day), a military parade in Lhasa to mark the anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan rebellion. The first military parades in the HKSAR and the MSAR took place on their first and fifth anniversaries in 1998 and 2004 respectively.

===== Republic of China =====
In the Republic of China (Taiwan), the Republic of China Armed Forces held its national parades in Taipei from 1949 until 1991 during the Double Ten Day celebrations. This practice was abandoned in 1991 though parades were recently held every five years beginning in 2011 during the Xinhai Revolution centenary and again in 2016. Special parades were held outside Taipei in 1995 and 2015 marking the 50th and 70th anniversaries, respectively, of both the Allied victory in the Second World War and the conclusion of the Second Sino-Japanese War.

==== Colombia ====
Both the Military Forces of Colombia and the National Police of Colombia hold important national parades to celebrate the anniversary of national independence as well as of the Armed Forces. Such parades are a mix of the Spanish, German, French, American and British influences owing to the long history of the country&#x27;s military and police forces. National level parades are held on:

* February 15 – Air Force Day 
* July 20 – Independence Day
* July 24 – Navy Day 
* August 7 – Army Day and Battle of Boyaca Victory Day
* November 15 – National Police Day

Local level parades by the personnel and veterans of the armed forces and police are held on the following:

* April 7 – Barranquilla Day
* July 3 – Cali Independence Day
* November 11 – Cartagena Independence Day

==== Cuba ====
The Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces generally holds military parades in honor of the Day of the Cuban Armed Forces and the Triumph of the Revolution on Havana&#x27;s Plaza de la Revolución. The first parade took place in 1960 for the latter event and over time, importance was transferred to Armed Forces Day in relation to military parades. In 2011, a special honor parade was held on April 16 to commemorate the golden jubilee since the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion. The largest parade to be held took place in December 1986 in honor of the 30th anniversary of the revolution, in which General Humberto Ortega from Nicaragua, as well as officials from the Soviet Union, attended. The diamond jubilee parade planned for 2016 was postponed for 1 month due to the death and state funeral of Fidel Castro, and took place during the Victory Day celebrations on 2 January 2017.

==== Czech Republic ====
Large military parades in the Czech Republic are today held every 10 years in the capital of Prague, encompassing personnel from the Czech Army and the Police of the Czech Republic. The first of these parades occurred in 2008 in honor of the founding of Czechoslovakia on 28 October 1918. Another one took place in 2018 and included foreign troops.

Prior to 1918, military parades followed the tradition of their larger sovereign entity, including the military tradition of Austria-Hungary. Regular military parades were held during the period of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, with the first parades being organized in the 1950s. The first parade of the Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Army (ČSLA) took place in 1951 in Letná. Since then, parades were held every five years on 9 May to mark the end of World War II and the liberation of Czechoslovakia. To honor the latter&#x27;s celebrations, the State Anthem of the Soviet Union would be performed by the massed bands on parade preceded by the Czechoslovakian national anthem. The last of these parades took place in 1985.

==== Finland ====

The parade traditions of Finland can be traced to the Swedish period, and later on during Russian administration, wherein the local formations adopted a few of the Russian parade traditions in tandem with the Swedish tradition and local practices. Today the Finnish Defence Forces, hosts a national parade every year on the following dates:

* June 4, Defence Forces Flag Day and birthday of Marshal of Finland Baron Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim
* December 6, Independence Day

The national parades are held in a host city selected for the year, and typically include military unis from all three services, the Finnish Border Guard and reserve units, contingents from the National Defence Training Association of Finland and other voluntary national defence organisations, and contingents of civilian authorities, e.g. the Police of Finland. Helsinki hosts the June 4 flag day parade every fifth year; 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017, 2022, 2027, and so on. 

The brigade level-units its may organise local, smaller parades to celebrate particular events. On the day of swearing their military oath, Finnish conscripts graduating their basic training typically march in a small parade within their garrison or in a local town or village.

Regardless of the parade size, the Finnish military parade consists of the inspection of the troops, a moment of worship and the pass in review. In the inspection, the senior officer who receiver the parade formally walks past the assembled troops and deliveres an address to them. All troops, including motorised units, are usually dismounted for the inspction. This is followed by a sermon given by a military chaplain, concluded by an anthem sung by the troops. After this, the troops pass in review, marching at a pace of 120 steps per minute, units either in three or four files and vehicles in a single column.

==== France ====
The annual military parade in the French capital of Paris is held on July 14 during the Bastille Day holiday. It is currently the oldest and largest military parade on the European continent. It is held on the Champs-Élysées and passes from l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe to Place de la Concorde. Bastille Day parades are also held in smaller garrison towns such as Toulon and Belfort. The 1st Infantry Regiment of the French Republican Guard regularly performs ceremonial marchpasts in is role as the guard of honour for the president of the French Republic. Like the British, many French units have the ability to march in quick time, while only one – the French Foreign Legion – marches uniquely in slow time, while another unit of the armed forces marches in very quick time and that is of the Army&#x27;s Chasseurs, especially its Chasseurs alpins.

In addition to the Armed Forces (including the National Guard) and the occasional participation of its veterans, the following take part in the national parade:

* National Police
* Fire services of the Ministry of the Interior
* Security Service of the Ministry of the Interior
* French Prisons Service
* Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes

Local parades are held on the following days:

* May 8 – Victory in Europe Day
* November 11 – Armistice Day
* Anniversaries of important battles fought by the French Armed Forces

==== Germany ====
Germany has had a long tradition of military parades dating back to the days of Kingdom of Prussia and its army and navy. It was the Prussians who invented the goose step, a style of marching that was used in many German armies as well as in the militaries of various countries, which were instructed by Prussian military training officers and instructors from the 19th century to the early 20th. Its traditions were also carried on in a number of former crown dominions in Prussian lands, including Hanover and the Rhineland, as well as in the allied Kingdom of Württemberg and the Kingdom of Saxony, the grand duchies, duchies and principalities, and the city-state military forces of Bremen and Hamburg. In Bavaria, a mix of the Prussian and Austrian practice in tandem with its local traditions was kept.

During the Nazi era, military parades were commonplace as they were held as a sort of victory parade for the German Wehrmacht as they invaded countries before and during the Second World War, as well as an expression of national pride in the armed forces, who together with the SS and the SA, as well as the other Nazi party uniformed organizations, formed part of the parades in the mid-1930s. The first major parades took place in Nuremberg in September 1938 and Adolf Hitler&#x27;s 50th birthday in April 1939. In the months Immediately after the German invasion of Poland, a joint German–Soviet military parade took place in Brest-Litovsk (now Brest, Belarus). In Allied-occupied Germany, the major powers held parades through the center of Berlin to honor their victory. These include the Berlin Victory Parade of 1945, 1945 British Berlin Victory Parade and Berlin Victory Parade of 1946.

In the communist German Democratic Republic (GDR), parades were held according to the Russian standard, although the Soviet Army allowed the East Germans, through the National People&#x27;s Army and the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic, to use the Prussian tradition, something that had been dropped by their West German counterparts in the 1950s. In the GDR, parades were held on the following occasions:

*NVA Day (3 March)
*International Workers&#x27; Day (1 May)
*Tag der Befreiung (8 May)
*Tag der Republik (7 October)

The first parade took place on 1 May 1956 in the presence of President Wilhelm Pieck. In the 1960s and early 1970s, parades took place on the western half of the Palace of the Republic, which was intended as a military parade ground, even though tremors from the heavy vehicles proved dangerous due to the glass facade. By 1979, the western half was used mainly as a parking lot and military parades were moved to Karl-Marx-Allee in central Berlin. A special parade was held on 13 August 1986 to mark the silver jubilee since construction on the Berlin Wall began, and the parade involved not just the NVA and the Grenztruppen but also the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment and battalions of the Combat Groups of the Working Class.
In 1969, the first military parade of West Germany and later the entire Federal Republic of Germany was held on the Nürburgring in the town of Nürburg, Rhineland-Palatinate. It took place on 6 June 1969 and was held to commemorate the 20th anniversary of both the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and creation of the Federal Republic in the West. It was attended by Kurt Georg Kiesinger in his position as Federal Chancellor of Germany. Participating foreign and national units included those from the , Canadian Forces Europe, United States Army Europe, as well as army contingents from France and the United Kingdom. Allied parades were also held later in the country&#x27;s 40-year existence.

Today, military parades are held on the following holidays on a smaller scale:

* Remembrance Day of July 20
* German Unity Day (October 3)
* Passing out parades of NCO training schools and officer training institutions

==== Greece ====

The long history of the Hellenic Armed Forces and the role played in the defense and progress of the country are recalled in splendid and grand military parades that are held in major cities in the country following a hybrid of the British, French, Danish and German traditions on the following dates:

* 25 March – Independence Day
* 28 October – Ohi Day
* On Liberation Days of major cities and towns, honoring the Greek fallen of the Second World War and the later Greek Civil War

==== India ====

The tradition of military parades in India dates back to the medieval times as celebrations to honor Hindu gods in gratitude to victories against enemies. By the time of the Mughal Empire, with the introduction of gunpower weapons came the first European settlers, the Portuguese, in what is now Daman and Diu and Goa states, and the Portuguese Army, who introduced the modern form of parades to this country. These followed by servicemen from what is now The Netherlands, &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; France and the United Kingdom thru the East India Company (from the 17th century) and beginning from the 19th century the British Army, Royal Marines and the Royal Navy. Between these four countries, it was the UK that influenced the Indian military ceremonial tradition the most, as Hindu, Sikh, Tamil and Gurkha regiments, as well as a number of regiments from other races, whether be infantry, cavalry, artillery or engineers, alongside locally recruited seamen, were instructed in the British parade drill with adaptations to Indian conditions. They maintain the very same traditions today in the current Indian Armed Forces, and the current drills are a modernized form of those used beginning in 1895, the year of the foundation of the modern Indian Army, with parades having been held during the Delhi Durbars of 1903 and 1911 as well as during the King&#x27;s Official Birthday in June.

Since 1951 the Republic Day parade has held annually in Delhi to mark India&#x27;s Republic Day, celebrating the enactment in that day in 1950 of the Constitution of India. It is the country&#x27;s principal military parade honoring the Armed Forces for its long record of service to the country and is also a showcase of the achievements of India&#x27;s defence industry, with a number of vehicles and aircraft featured being locally produced by factories under the Ministry of Defence and by local defense production firms. Parades are also held on the service holidays of the Armed Forces:

* 15 January, Army Day
* 8 October, Air Force Day
* 4 December, Navy Day

In 2020, Captain Tania Shergill became the first female parade adjutant to lead a contingent at an Army Day parade.

Alongside the Armed Forces and its veterans the national Republic Day Parade in Delhi, as well as regional parades held on this day and on 15 August, Independence Day, features the participation of the following uniformed organizations:

* National Cadet Corps
* Youth representatives of the National Service Scheme
* Indian Coast Guard
* Assam Rifles
* all state and territorial police forces, including State Armed Police
* Border Security Force
* Indo-Tibetan Border Police
* Sashastra Seema Bal
* National Security Guard
* Central Industrial Security Force
* Central Reserve Police Force
* Railway Protection Force
* all municipal, city, state and territorial fire services

Special parades are held on:

* The passing out and graduation ceremonies of all military and police training and educational institutions

* Presentation of military and police colours
* Unit anniversaries

==== Korea ====
===== &quot;North Korea&quot; =====

All military parades of the Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA) and the Worker-Peasant Red Guards (WPRG) are centered in the national capital of Pyongyang and have a long tradition that goes back to the DPRK&#x27;s establishment in 1948. Between 1993 and 2011, the DPRK held over a dozen military parades, which was frequent compared to the 1960s–80s, during which only three parades were held. Known for its elaborate military drill, the country holds military parades annually on different dates (especially on jubilee years), which feature a combination of Chinese and Russian techniques. North Korean military parades are held on the following dates:

*8 February – Military Foundation Day 
*15 April – Day of the Sun 
*25 April – Revolutionary Army Day
*27 July – Day of Victory in the Great Fatherland Liberation War
*15 August – Liberation Day
*9 September – Day of the Foundation of the Republic
*10 October – Party Foundation Day
Rehearsals for these parades usually take place three to six weeks prior to the actual parade at the Mirim Parade Training Facility in the capital. The actual parades are held in the capital&#x27;s Kim Il-sung Square.

In addition, non-jubilee holiday parades have been mounted on the grounds of the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun on these days plus on:

*16 February – Day of the Shining Star
*25 August – Day of &quot;Songun&quot;
*21 December – Death Anniversary of Kim Jong-il

Alongside the KPA and WPRG, also taking part are the policemen and women of the Ministry of Social Security&#x27;s Korean People&#x27;s Social Security Forces (which also includes border police). In 2015 the Korean Children&#x27;s Union made an inaugural appearance in the parade celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea, forming the rear contingent of the military parade ground column made up of middle and junior high school students who are part of the KCU&#x27;s Young Pioneer Corps. The first ever modern KCU parade, including cadets from the Mangyongdae and Kang Pang Sok Revolutionary Schools, was held in Kim Il-sung Stadium in 2012.

===== &quot;South Korea&quot; =====
The tradition of parades in South Korea began in 1946, with the first ever parades of what is now the Republic of Korea Armed Forces, alongside personnel of the United States Forces Korea, whose traditions would shape the young armed forces&#x27; parade and ceremonial practices till this day mixed with the Japanese practice (due to the long period of Japanese rule over the peninsula). Today, that tradition is mixed with those of the other armed services under United Nations Command that fought with them against the KPA, the People&#x27;s Volunteer Army and the Soviet Air Forces during the Korean War. The parade tradition is also coupled as a showcase for the national defense industry as well, with many of the military equipment being featured being of national manufacture, and locally composed military marches being featured in the repertoire of the military bands that are a staple of these events.

As of the present the ROKAF marches in public parades in the following occasions:

* March 1, Day of the Independence Movement
* April 13, Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea Foundation Day
* April 15, Republic of Korea Marine Corps Birthday
* June 6, Memorial Day
* June 25, anniversary of the beginning of the Korean War
* July 27, anniversary of the Korean War Armistice of 1953
* August 15, National Liberation Day of Korea
* September 5, Republic of Korea Army Day
* October 1, Armed Forces Day (principal holiday of the Armed Forces) and Air Force Day
* October 3, Gaecheonjeol
* November 11, Republic of Korea Navy Day
* On the occasion of change of command, retirement and recruit and cadet graduation parades within the service branches of the armed forces, military academies, all officer candidate schools and recruit training institutions
* On the occasion of the inaugurations of the president of South Korea

The October 1 parade and related celebrations, while being not a public holiday but a National Flag Raising Day mandated by law, serve as the principal day of gratitude to the ROKAF and its veterans for service to the nation at large and to all Koreans abroad, and thus the ROKAF only marches in public parades on this day with Seoul, the national capital, hosting the national parades (large major parades on this day are held every 5th year since the 1948 foundation of the republic, a tradition that began in 1998). On other holidays, the following organizations march with the armed forces, all cadet formations under the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (South Korea) and the Republic of Korea Reserve Forces:

* National Police Agency
* Korea Coast Guard
* National Fire Agency of the Republic of Korea
* All local and regional firefighting services
* Korea Forest Service
* Korea Customs Service
* Railway Police of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport
* Korea Immigration Service
* Korea Scout Association
* Girl Scouts Korea
* Foreign armed forces&#x27; veterans organizations stationed within the republic

==== Mexico ====
Both the Mexican Armed Forces and the National Guard hold important national parades to celebrate the anniversary of national independence. The tradition began in 1924 and the principal national parade on the Zocalo square in Mexico City was made a permanent yearly event in 1935.

Parades are also held every Cinco de Mayo and on Revolution Day, 20 November.

==== Mongolia ====
Military parades in Mongolia have a long tradition that dates back to the era of the Mongol Empire. Today they closely follow the Russian model with some modifications such as trooping of the flag of Mongolia in a car rather than by foot. A Dangjiren is based on a cavalry military parade of the Mongols that were held in the 17th century.

The first official military parade in Communist Mongolia took place in 1921 in honor of the victories of Damdin Sükhbaatar in the People&#x27;s Revolution. The anniversary parades that followed have been held on jubilee years (specifically in 1946, 1951, 1956, 1961, 1966, 1971, 1976, 1981, 1986 and 1991). After 1991, the practice was abandoned with the exception of 1996 when a parade in the National Sports Stadium commemorated the 790th anniversary of the founding of Mongolia and the 75th anniversary of the People&#x27;s Revolution. After a nine-year break, the 2005 inauguration ceremony of Nambaryn Enkhbayar served as an event to hold a military parade on the central square. This took place again in 2009 for the inauguration of Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj. That same year, State Flag Day was introduced as a national holiday, which would also be celebrated with a parade.

Military parades of the Mongolian Armed Forces on Sükhbaatar Square or in Choibalsan take place on the following occasions:

*18 March – Soldiers Day
*10 July – Mongolian State Flag Day
*1 September – Anniversary of the Battle of Khalkin Gol
*Inauguration of the president of Mongolia
*Graduations of the National Defense University

During Mongolia&#x27;s socialist period, annual civil/military parades of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Army took place until 1991, celebrating the following occasions:

*1 May – International Workers Day
*11 July – Day of the People&#x27;s Revolution of 1921
*7 November – October Revolution Day

During these events, party and government leaders were viewed ascending to the top of Sükhbaatar&#x27;s Mausoleum to take the salute.

Alongside the Armed Forces today&#x27;s parades also involve personnel of the National Police Agency, the Internal Troops of Mongolia, the General Authority for Border Protection and the National Emergency Management Agency.

==== Paraguay ====
It was the armed services of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay that helped develop the traditions of military parades in Paraguay following the devastating Paraguayan War, resulting in the introduction of certain traditions beginning in the early 20th century, which would later be infused with German, Italian and French influence. Before that war, however, they were quite few parades with primarily Spanish influences. The first major parade ever to be held in the 20th century in this country was on August 22, 1935, celebrating the victory won in the Chaco War against the Bolivian Armed Forces. In the 1940s and 1950s, German goose-stepping had been adopted in a limited scale thanks to Chilean instructors in the Francisco López Military Academy, the Acosta Ñu Military High School and the National Police Academy.

Today the Armed Forces of Paraguay stages massive military parades in Asunción, the national capital, together with the police on the following days:

* May 14, Independence Day
* June 12, Chaco War Victory Day
* July 24, Army Day
* September 12, Navy Day
* September 22, Victory Day in the Battle of Curupayty 
* September 29, Victory Day in the Battle of Boqueron
* November 6, Air Force Day

In addition, a local parade is held every August 15 in honor of the anniversary of the foundation of the city of Asunción and the Catholic Feast of the Assumption of Mary. Almost all parades are televised nationally.

==== Peru ====
The Peruvian Armed Forces and the National Police of Peru holds the yearly Great Military Parade of Peru every July 29 in Lima as the armed services&#x27; way of honoring the anniversary of national independence and the role they have played in shaping the history of the country. Together with these two services the Peruvian Volunteer Firefighters Corps and Peruvian National Penitentiary Institute also take part as well. Local level Independence Day parades are held on pre-determined days before July 28 and 29 as set by their respective local governments.

Parades held by service personnel and veterans of the armed forces are also marked on:

* June 7 – Flag Day and Battle of Arica Memorial Day 
* June 26 – Air Force Day
* September 24 – Armed Forces Day 
* October 8 – Navy Day
* December 9 – Army Day and the anniversary of the Battle of Ayacucho

==== Philippines ====
The tradition of military parades in the Philippines traces its origins to the military parades held since the late 1700s in honor of the inaugurations of the governors general of the Philippines, with troops provided by formations of the Spanish Army, Spanish Navy and the Spanish Marine Infantry, manned by personnel from Spain and her other colonies and locally recruited personnel. Parades were also held on the anniversaries of members of the Spanish royal family and important anniversaries. It was these parades that would model the revolutionary armed forces of the young country, made up of the young Philippine Revolutionary Army and local pro-independence militias, as it performed the first ever military parade on January 23, 1899, the day of the formal establishment of the First Philippine Republic in what is now the city of Malolos in Bulacan.

Today&#x27;s military parade tradition are also combined with the latter influences of the United States Armed Forces, the Philippine Constabulary and the locally raised Philippine Scouts, which held parades together with the collegiate formations of the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (raised 1912), and later on with Japanese influences during the brief Japanese occupation during the Second World War, where parades were held by servicemen of both the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy, which high stepped before dignitaries. During the inauguration of the Second Republic on October 14, 1943, Japanese-sponsored military formations marched past in what is now Manila&#x27;s National Museum Building. On July 4, 1946, the day national independence was restored as a result of the promulgation of the Treaty of Manila, the first modern military parade was held involving both US and Philippine units in historic Rizal Park in Manila, and from then on military parades of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (composed of active and reserve servicemen and women and its veterans), the Philippine National Police, successor to the traditions and history of both the Constabulary and the Integrated National Police (established 1975) and the paramilitary Philippine Coast Guard under the Department of Transportation (established in its modern form in 1967 with roots dating back to 1901 and has been a separate organization since 1998), alongside the college and university ROTC units and other components of the National Service Training Program and the secondary school cadets in Citizen&#x27;s Army Training (CAT) units from both public and private institutions, are a part of national life and a big staple during major national holidays. These events are expressions of national pride and gratitude for services for the country by servicemen and women of these organizations and a demonstration of their importance to national defense and security. On July 7, 1974, the Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas opened its doors with a grand civil-military parade entitled &quot;Kasaysayan ng Lahi&quot; (&quot;History of the Race&quot;) in time for Miss Universe 1974, which also featured formations in historical uniforms from the pre-Spanish era up to the Second World War as well as living veterans of the latter conflict. Until 1962, parades were held on July 4, the former date of Independence Day, and the last Rizal Day parade in honor of the presidential inauguration was held in 1969. Today military parades in the Philippines, which are sometimes also televised events, are held on a number of days (local commemorations indicated in parentheses):

Both of these parades include NATO personnel stationed near or inside the country. The Armed Forces Day parade was introduced in 2007 and 2008 as first grand military parades since the holiday was reinstated and have been held yearly since 2013. The first Polish military parade took place on 17 January 1945. Prior to 1989, parades were held in front of the Palace of Culture and Science on Parade Square on 22 July commemorate the National Day of the Rebirth of Poland celebrations, honoring the anniversary of the signing of the Stalin-sponsored PKWN Manifesto. Back then, the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland used many Russian traditions in regard to military parades, especially the inspection by the minister of defence. In 1966, during the millennium celebrations of the Christianization of Poland, a parade was held on 22 July which included cadets of military academies and personnel of Polish ceremonial units dressed in historical military uniforms dating back to the Piast dynasty. A special parade was held on 9 May 1985 to honor the 40th anniversary of the Victory in Europe and the servicemen of the Polish Armed Forces in the West and the East. In 2019, a 3rd was added when the yearly 3 May Constitution Day parades, last held in 1939 and were held off and on since 1990, were officially reinstated.

==== Romania ====
The Romanian tradition of military parades (&quot;Parada militara/Defilada militara&quot;) dates back to the days as a kingdom, based on the traditions of Russia, Germany and Greece (and later on Hungary beginning in 1918, following the accession into the country of Transylvania). The traditions took a new form during the days as a socialist republic from 1947 to 1989, with additional Soviet influences, with August 23, Liberation from Fascist Occupation Day and also currently Black Ribbon Day, being the day of the principal parade held in Bucharest involving the Romanian People&#x27;s Army celebrating the 1944 King Michael&#x27;s Coup which ended years of fascist administration in Romania, one of the direct consequences of the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in 1940. While the first parade was held in 1945 the first anniversary of the coup and as a celebration of the Allied victory in the Second World War in Europe, the final parade was held in 1989, the coup&#x27;s sapphire jubillee year anniversary. Most often the parades were held on Bucharest&#x27;s Charles de Gaulle Square, and today&#x27;s military parades, with occasional participation of armed forces from NATO countries, are held in either Constitution Square in the capital or at the Șoseaua Kiseleff near the Arch of Triumph.

==== Russia and ex-Soviet countries ====

The Western tradition of military parades in the Russian Empire was part of the many reforms made by Peter the Great as part of his many efforts to transform the army and the navy from traditional militias to a full-blown professional armed service that is a model for the people in discipline and obedience, courage, bravery, loyalty to the country and in bringing pride and glory to her people. During the Imperial period, national parades were alternated between Moscow and Saint Petersburg on major national civil and military holidays, anniversaries of the Romanov Dynasty and as part of the imperial coronation celebrations, celebrations and parades were also held in many major cities and provincial capitals.

So important was the value of these parades that even the Soviet Armed Forces made these parades a common tradition beginning in August 1918 when the first modern parade was held in Moscow&#x27;s Red Square when Moscow area Vsevobuch detachments march past, earlier than May, a military parade, the first by the nascent Red Army, was held outside the capital. Since that year, many innovations have been seen in the practice of annual parades held not just there but in the capital cities of the former Soviet Union, as well as in major cities in the wide country, which were held on 1 May (1918–1941 and 1945–1968), 7 November (1920–1941 and 1945–1990) and 9 May (1945, 1965, 1985 and 1990). The following areas in the union republics were where common parades were held in 1990:
* – Khreshchatyk, Kyiv
* – Lenin Square, Minsk
* – Lenin Square, Tashkent
* – Brezhnev Square, Almaty
* – Rustaveli Avenue, Tbilisi
* – Lenin Square, Baku
* – Gediminas Avenue, Vilnius
* – Victory Square/Great National Assembly, Kishinev 
* - 11 November Embankment, Riga
* - Lenin Square, Frunze
* - Lenin Square, Dushanbe
* – Republic Square, Yerevan 
* - Freedom Avenue, Ashgabat 
* - Freedom Square, Tallinn 

Today, the Russian Armed Forces - and by extension countries of the former Soviet Union - host a variety of military parades held on important national holidays, honoring the men and women of their armed forces and military veterans. The celebrations in each of these countries carry on years of tradition, honor, discipline, and prestige by the millions of men and women who serve and have served in the ranks of the armed forces of their respective home countries. These parades have extensive government funding and aside from the iconic wide march past columns and occasional historical formations, typically include a mobile column, and occasionally a naval fleet review and/or air force fly past segment, a legacy of the Soviet era. Alongside the armed forces and occasionally youth cadets of military high schools, law enforcement and emergency services also take part in the parades in their countries.

While the country was a Soviet Republic from 1920 to 1991, Armenia was formerly independent from 1918 to 1920 and thus had armed forces composed of both veterans of the Imperial Army and guerillas fighting the Ottoman armed forces who had been enforcing the anti-Armenian massacres of 1914. Armenians fought bravery in the Eastern Front of the Second World War as part of the Soviet Armed Forces, retaining some of its traditions today. The last of the Soviet-era parades took place in 1988. Today, the Armed Forces of Armenia hosts massive parades held in Yerevan, the capital city, on the following days:

* May 28 – Republic Day
* September 21 – Independence Day

In recent years, national military parades have included drill units and military bands performing exhibition drill for the guests before the parade concludes.

Armenian military parades have garnered notable controversy. The 1996 parade coincided with the presidential election, which would take place the day after, which resulted in many opposition figures charging President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who was in attendance, with putting on a show of force to his opposition and particularly supporters of his opponent Vazgen Manukyan. Another controversial aspect was censorship, an example of this being in 1994, when Ruben Satyan (editor-in-chief of the Russian language newspaper &quot;Vremya&quot;) reported that one Armenian general was wearing non-regulation trousers with sewn red stripes on pants intended for a private, a report which resulted in Satyan being summoned to the local military prosecutor&#x27;s office, who warned him to never do a report like this again, particularly saying that &quot;It&#x27;s good you&#x27;re not 45, otherwise, I&#x27;d have you sent to fight in Karabakh&quot;.

===== Azerbaijan =====

The semi-annual parade on the Day of the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan, 26 June, is one of the biggest in the Commonwealth of Independent States, held every 3 to 5 years at the Azadliq Square, Baku, honoring the many Azerbaijanis who served faithful under the colours as part of her armed forces. The forces on parade are assembled based on a mix of the Turkish and Russian parade formation.

A special victory parade was held on that same square on 10 December 2020 to mark the Azeri victory in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war.

Alongside the semi-annual parades, celebration marches and occasional parades are held on the following:

* 9 May, Victory in Europe Day
* 28 May, Independence Day
* 15 September, anniversary of the Azerbaijani-Turkish victory in the 1918 Battle of Baku
* 18 October, Independence Restoration Day
* 8–9 November, Victory Day in the Nagorno-Karabakh Patriotic War and Flag Day
* Passing out parades and ceremonies of military educational institutions

===== Belarus =====

The first venue for the parades in the capital was Cathedral Square. Military parades and solemn processions took place here even before the October Revolution. Upon the Liberation of Minsk in 1944, a parade now known as the Partisans Parade was held. Military parades in the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic took place on October Square from 1946 to 1984.

The Armed Forces of Belarus holds an annual military parade on 3 July along the Victors Avenue in the national capital Minsk, marking the anniversary of the liberation of the country during the 1944 Minsk Offensive, which coincides with the country&#x27;s Independence Day. On special years of the victory in Europe, commemorative extraordinary parades are held there on 9 May to honor the millions of Belarusian military dead of the Second World War. Military parades in the country are based on the Russian/Polish model and tradition. Formerly, parades in the Republic of Belarus and the BSSR took place on Independence Square (known in the Soviet era as Lenin Square). This changed in the early 2000s when the square was renovated and became incompatible with the parade format. Since 2004, military parades in the capital have taken place on Victors Avenue.

The first military parade in the Western city of Grodno was held 2015 on Lenin Square. In connection with the centennial of the Belarusian Armed Forces in 2018, a military parade was also held in Grodno.

===== Estonia =====
While being formerly independent from 1918 to 1940 and as a component republic of the Soviet Union from that year to 1941 and yet again from 1944 to 1991, the current Estonian Defence Forces and the Estonian Defence League, successor to both the military and reserve forces of the First Republic and republican formations under the Baltic Military District and Baltic Fleet of the Soviet Armed Forces, marches during a combination of Russian, Finnish and Western drill in parades held in the following days:

* February 24 – Independence Day
* June 24 – Victory Day

During the 2006 Victory Day Parade in Saaremaa, the first-ever Fleet Review of the Estonian Navy in Estonian history was conducted by the Estonian Defence League. The Soviet era Estonian language term for the annual parade on what was formerly Victory Square during the 7 November holiday was the Oktoobriparaad (&quot;October Parade&quot;).

===== Georgia =====
The Defense Forces of Georgia, successor to the armed services of the Democratic Republic and Soviet formations stationed in the Georgian SSR, hosts military parades on May 26, Independence Day, the anniversary of the formation of the republic in 1918, together with elements from the National Police, the Border Police and the Georgian Coast Guard. The first parade was held on Independence Day in 1991, with 10,000 soldiers of the National Guard of Georgia taking their oath of service in front of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia at Boris Paichadze Stadium. The parade was held without heavy equipment (by order of parade commander, Colonel Avtandil Tskitishvili), with only a small detachment of cavalry being brought to the stadium. Another parade was organized in 1993. From 1997 to 2004, no military parades had been organized by the government, citing financial difficulties. In 2004, President Mikheil Saakashvili restored the tradition of holding military parades. National independence parades have also been held in the cities of Batumi and Kutaisi.

Modern parades are a mix of the former Soviet and modern Western (British, US, Turkish and Israeli) traditions and drill owing to the modernization of the defense and public security forces to NATO and EU standards.

===== Kazakhstan =====
The Armed Forces of Kazakhstan holds military parades () that resemble the parades of the Russian military in Moscow, with one of the only exceptions being the inspection of the troops by the Supreme Commander of the Kazakh Armed Forces, instead of the defense minister. It has never held yearly parades celebrating one occasion, with parades currently being held in honor of the Defender of the Fatherland Day holiday, the first of which being 2014 and the largest parade in existence being held on this date in 2015. In the past, large scale military parades in the former capital of Almaty and the current capital of Astana were held on the following holidays:

*Kazakhstan Independence Day (1996)
*Victory Day (9 May) (1995, 2000, 2005)
*Constitution Day (Kazakhstan) (2009, 2010, 2011)

In recent years, the Defender of the Fatherland Day parade was expanded to function as a so-called &quot;Battle Parade&quot; (Боевой парад). So far, only two of these kinds of parades have been held; in 2013 and 2018. In contrast to usual military parades, the battle parade includes tactical exercises and military demonstrations after the parade itself. These parades usually are held at the 40th Otar Military Base in the Korday District and take place with the troops in full combat gear rather than a ceremonial full dress uniform. Like former Soviet republics, Kazakh military parades are led by a cadet drum corps, specifically from the Astana Zhas Ulan Republican School.

As of 2020, the MC for parade ceremonies is Azamat Kanapiya, who announces the parade live and not pre-recorded like his Russian counterparts.

===== Kyrgyzstan =====
Kyrgyz military parades are based on Russian traditions, having been held on many occasions in the history of the Armed Forces of Kyrgyzstan. Currently, the only consistent military parade is held on Ala-Too Square in Bishkek every 5 years in honor of the country&#x27;s Independence Day. Other military parades have been held celebrating different occasions. On 24 March 2006, a parade was held on the same square celebrating the 1 year anniversary since the Tulip Revolution which overthrew President Askar Akayev. In May of that same year, a Day of the Armed Forces parade on the same square, later being deemed as &quot;irresponsible&quot; by opposition lawmaker Omurbek Tekebaev due to the fact that it coincided with opposition protests against President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, which itself was described by Defence Minister Ismail Isakov as purely &quot;coincidental&quot;. In 2015, a Victory Day Parade was held in the Kyrgyz capital, being presided by Prime Minister Temir Sariyev and Chief of General Staff Asanbek Alymkozhoev in place of President Almazbek Atambayev, who was attending the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade that same day. The parade saw the appearance of veterans of the war in the mobile column as well as Russian troops from the local Kant Air Base taking part in the parade.

===== Latvia =====
Latvia, like its neighbors to the north and south, was also formerly independent from 1918 to 1940 and as a component republic of the Soviet Union from that year to 1941 and yet again from 1944 to 1991, and its armed forces, then as in the 90s, were formed up of Latvian born personnel who served in the Russian military and thus share some of the Russian drill and parade ceremonial in combination with Western practices. After the restoration of Latvia&#x27;s independence, parades at the Freedom Monument began on 23 August 1992. Today, the Latvian National Armed Forces hosts massive parades (with occasional participation by service personnel of NATO armed forces) on the following dates:

* May 4, Restoration of Independence Day
* November 11, Lāčplēsis Day
* November 18, Proclamation Day of the Republic of Latvia

===== Lithuania =====
The first official military parade in Lithuania took place on 11 May 1919 in Kaunas. In the latter years of Soviet rule, military parades were met with much hostility. In 1989, protesters in Vilnius blocked tanks rolling on the central avenue and a year later, Chairman of the Supreme Council Vytautas Landsbergis and Prime Minister Kazimira Prunskienė both condemned the holding of a Soviet parade as &quot;psychological warfare&quot; and an attempt by the Soviet authorities to &quot;intimidate&quot; then breakaway republic.

An annual parade is held on Lithuanian Armed Forces Day (celebrated on 23 November). The holiday is traditionally celebrated with a noon parade reviewed by the president of Lithuania on Cathedral Square in Vilnius, which runs through Gediminas Avenue to Independence Square. NATO, alongside Lithuanian troops take part in the parade. In recent years large parades were held on the 95th anniversary and centennial (in 2013 and 2018) of the restoration of the Lithuanian military. Another large parade was held in 2004 on the occasion of the nation joining NATO.

===== Russia =====
Military parades in Russia were first held in 1702 as a troop review, but later grew into a ceremonial event held by order of the president of the Russian Federation in his constitutional duty as supreme commander of the Armed Forces. Alongside personnel and veterans of the Armed Forces, marching past in these parades are cadets of military high schools and middle schools and the Young Army Cadets National Movement, cadets of military faculties of civil universities and battalions of Cossacks, honoring their forebears who fought for their homeland in times past. Also, the following uniformed organizations take part in these parades:
* Kremlin Regiment of the Federal Protective Service (in Moscow only)
* National Guard of Russia
* Police of Russia 
* Main Directorate for Drugs Control
* Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation
* Ministry of Emergency Situations
* Federal Penitentiary Service
* Investigative Committee of Russia
Today, the Moscow Victory Day Parade is the main national parade in the country, which follows the traditional format of the now defunct October Revolution Day Parades and the International Workers Day Parade. In Russia, military parades are annually held in many parts of the country on the following days:

*Defender of the Fatherland Day on 23 February
*Victory Day on 9 May – Victory Day marks Germany&#x27;s surrender to the Soviet Union in 1945 and is Russia&#x27;s foremost national military holiday since 1995
*Navy Day on the last Sunday of July

Two of the most significant military parades on Moscow&#x27;s Red Square were 1941 October Revolution Parade and the Victory Parade in 1945. Individual parades on the square were held on 7 March 1919 and 27 July 1920 in honor of World Congresses of the Communist International, on 7 February 1934 in honor of the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), on the very first Day of Tankmen in 1946 and one following the state funeral of Joseph Stalin in March 1953. Today, the square serves as the foremost parade venue in the nation. Rehearsals for these parades took place at Khodynka Aerodrome and Vnukovo Airfield in the Soviet era and the Alabino in the modern era.

The following Days of Military Honour often see parades held in individual cities:
* 27 January – Day of lifting of the Siege of Leningrad (held on Palace Square in Saint Petersburg)
* 2 February – Victory Day in the Battle of Stalingrad (held on Fallen Fighters Square in Volgograd)
* 23 August – Victory Day over Germany in the Battle of Kursk (held on Square of Heroes of the Battle of Kursk in Kursk)
* 2 September – Victory over Japan Day (held in the cities of the Eastern Military District such as Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk or Khabarovsk)
* 7 November – Anniversary of the historic 1941 military parades on the Red Square in Moscow and Kuybyshev Square in Samara (held every year on both squares)

===== Tajikistan =====
Tajik military parades are held every 2 to 3 years on Dushanbe&#x27;s Dousti Square. They are either held on the occasion of Independence Day or Armed Forces Day. They usually feature the entire Dushanbe Garrison and its military equipment. The first parade in Dushanbe, which was at the time known as Stalinabad, took place on an area known as Red Square on 7 November 1945. Since then, Soviet military parades of the 201st Motor Rifle Division in the Tajikistan SSR have been held on 9 May and 7 November in Lenin Square annually until 1990. The first military parade in the Republic of Tajikistan was held on armed forces day in 1993.

Parades are also occasionally held in honor of the inaugurations of the president of Tajikistan, the last was in 2020 in honor of President Emomali Rahmon&#x27;s 5th inauguration.

===== Turkmenistan =====
The principal parade hosted by the Armed Forces of Turkmenistan is held during the annual Independence Day Parade in Independence Square in Ashgabat every September 27, Independence Day, marking the day of the declaration of Turkmen independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. (From 1992 to 2017 the parade was held on October 27, the day of the independence plebiscite.) Parades have also been held on Day of Neutrality. In 2020, the 75th anniversary of the victory in World War II was celebrated with a military parade for the first time at the square in front of the Halk Hakydasy Memorial Complex.

===== Ukraine =====
Ukrainian parades involve the active and reserve men and women and veterans of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It holds parades on the following:

* Second Sunday of July – Navy Day
* May 8 – Day of Remembrance and Victory over Nazism in World War II 1939 – 1945
* May 9 – Europe Day and anniversary of the 1920 Kyiv Polish-Ukrainian Victory Parade
* August 24 – Ukrainian Independence Day
* October 1 – Defenders of Ukraine Day
* December 6 – Armed Forces Day 
* December 12 – Ground Forces Day

Something that distinguishes Ukrainian military parades from its other post-Soviet counterparts is, during the Kyiv parade, the marchpast of the tri-service Kyiv Presidential Honor Guard Battalion with the Flag of Ukraine to raise at the flagpole while honors are rendered, which includes the playing of &quot;Shche ne vmerla Ukraina&quot;. Since 2014, military bands have also played an integral part in these parades by marching with their units as part of the parade. Unlike their other counterparts, who use &quot;Hello Comrades&quot; as the official greeting during parades, Ukraine uses &quot;Glory to Ukraine&quot; as the official holiday greeting, with the troops responding by saying &quot;Glory to the Heroes&quot;.

The first major parade was held on 9 May 1995, with the participation of over 75 veterans from Ukraine and the CIS. The voice of military parades in Ukraine is Dmitry Khorkin, who since 2011 has been the official master of ceremonies for the national parades held in Kyiv&#x27;s Independence Square. Khorkin&#x27;s voice became remarkable for official events with the participation of the country&#x27;s top officials and for supporting the Ukrainian army, that&#x27;s why he had received threats from pro-Russian separatists before the 2016 military parade.

Other cities hold parades on the following days:

*Kharkiv: Day of the Belgorod-Kharkov Offensive Operation (parades held in 1993, 2003)

In addition to the Armed Forces and the Territorial Defense Forces, the following organizations also take part:

* National Guard of Ukraine
* Security Service of Ukraine
* National Police of Ukraine
* State Border Guard Service of Ukraine
* State Emergency Service of Ukraine

====Serbia/Former Yugoslavia====
Military parades in Serbia and the former Yugoslavia follow a close tradition that is significantly unique to the Balkan states. Their usage of the high step instead of the more European goose step is a notable display of heritage and tradition in their parades. The Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army held its first military parade on Bulevar revolucije just days before the conclusion of the Second World War on International Workers Day. Another parade on 20 October of that same year was held in honor of the one year anniversary of the end of the Belgrade Offensive.

Since then military parades in the SFRY were held on the following dates and occasions:

*1 May 1946
*19 October 1946
*1 May 1947
*1 May 1948
*1 May 1949
*1 May 1950
*1 May 1951
*1 May 1952
*1 May 1953
*1 May 1954
*1 May 1955
*1 May 1956
*1 May 1957
*1 May 1960
*1 May 1961
*1 May 1962
*1 May 1963
*1 May 1964
*9 May 1965
*9 May 1970
*9 May 1975 – It was the first parade to feature the high-stepping march style, which was instituted by Marshal Josip Broz Tito to assert his independence from Soviet influence.
*9 May 1985 – The parade (branded as &quot;Parade 85&quot;) was the last victory parade before the break up of Yugoslavia in the early 90s. It was also significant as it was the first parade that was not presided by Marshal Tito as leader of Yugoslavia.

Outside of the Serbian Armed Forces, the Army of the Republic of North Macedonia, the Armed Forces of Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina still use the Serbian/Yugoslav parade format, as shown below.

===== Croatia =====
The first Croatian military parade took place in the neighborhood of Jarun on 30 May 1995, marking Croatian Statehood Day. Another parade was held on the same date in 1997.

A special military parade of the Armed Forces of Croatia in honor of Victory Day was held on 4 August 2015 in Zagreb, celebrating the twentieth anniversary of Operation Storm. &quot;Lijepa naša domovino&quot; (the national anthem) was notably performed by 12-year-old Mia Negovetić, accompanied by the Croatian Armed Forces Band and the Croatian Navy&#x27;s vocal ensemble. The editorial board of the Zagreb-based &quot;Jutarnji list&quot; gave a positive review of the event and called for the introduction of regular parades on 4 August, whereas military analyst Igor Tabak criticized the inauthenticity of many &quot;historical units&quot;.

===== North Macedonia =====
On Army Day in 2012, a parade at Ilinden Barracks in Skopje was held on the jubilee of the 20th anniversary of the Army of North Macedonia led by the Chief of the General Staff, Major General Gorancho Koteski.

===== Serbia =====
The first massive parade in the Republic of Serbia took place on Liberation Day on 16 October 2014. Known commonly as the &quot;March of the Victor&quot;, the parade took place on Nikola Tesla Boulevard and included 4,500 Serbian Army troops, the Russian Swifts aerobatic team and even an appearance by Russian president Vladimir Putin as the guest of honour. Similar parades are still held annually. On 10 May 2019, the first Victory Day Parade in close to 35 years was held in the city of Niš. Branded as the &quot;Defence of Freedom&quot; show, the parade also included personnel of the Police of Serbia, which also marked the 20th anniversary of the Yugoslav resistance to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.

==== Singapore ====
The tiny city-state of Singapore has had a tradition of parades since the late 19th century thanks to the British presence as a colony of the Strait Settlements. The traditions of British Armed Forces formations in the island, which remained for more than a century till the last units left in the 1970s, have inspired the parade and ceremonial traditions and drill of the paramount uniformed organizations of the nation, the Singapore Armed Forces (established 1958) and the Singapore Police Force (established 1820). Until the 1960s, the King&#x27;s/Queen&#x27;s Birthday was marked by parades by the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, as well as parades by the Australian and New Zealand Defence Forces. A special victory parade was held in late September 1945 to mark the victory over Japan and the conclusion of the Second World War. In those years, the Singapore Volunteer Corps, raised 1854, served as the local force representing the island in such events, a role it played for more than a century until the mid-1960s.

The first ever modern parade was held on 3 December 1959 to mark the inauguration of Singapore&#x27;s second governor and first president Yusof Ishak, with the 1st battalion of the young Singapore Infantry Regiment in attendance at the historic city Padang in front of historic National Gallery Singapore complex, then City Hall, alongside the SPF, the then Singapore Fire Brigade (now the Singapore Civil Defence Force), representatives of the British Armed Forces and the cadet organizations, as well as students from secondary and primary schools. The 1959 Inauguration Parade would set a precedent that would be seen in future parades held in the country, later inflused with elements from within Southeast Asia and abroad, as well as the already dominant Commonwealth tradition and the Padang would be seen as the place of big parades in the nation. Beginning 1960, parades were held on a set date nearest 3 June to mark National Day, at first in honor of the country&#x27;s grant of self-governance as an independent Commonwealth realm in 1958–59. It all ended in 1963 with the merger with Malaysia and the first Malaysia Day Parades were held at the Padang on 15–16 September 1963 to mark accession as a Malaysian state, and parades were held until 1964 on that day, 31 August and on 12 August, the governor&#x27;s birthday. Late in 1963 an extraordinary Padang parade was held to mark the visit to the state of the then king of Malaysia, Putra of Perlis, which saw the participation of the 6th Battalion, Royal Malay Regiment.

On 9 August 1966 the inaugural Singapore National Day Parade was held at the Padang with President Ishak as guest of honor and principal guest, with the parade now using Malay language drill, a tradition inherited from the Malaysian Armed Forces, which replaced the English drill commands in 1963. 9 August was chosen to mark the date of the historic 1965 Proclamation of Singapore. Since then the civil-military parade and the post-parade cultural, musical and gymnastic presentations following it have been synonymous with National Day commemorations, serving thus as the nation&#x27;s principal national parade, at times one of the largest in all of Southeast Asia with occasional military mobile, sea and air columns. Today the Padang hosts the NDP every 5 years as a show of gratitude to that National Monument&#x27;s place in the country&#x27;s history, at other years the National Stadium and The Float @ Marina Bay (soon NS Square) have at times alternated as the venues of the parade. In 1975, 1977, 1979, 1981 and 1983 the parade was a localized event held in several sports stadiums. In 2019 the NDP was held at the Padang in a break from tradition to honor the Singapore Biccentenial. A televised event produced by Mediacorp, it is also live streamed globally to millions online and features, together with the SAF, SPF and SCDF, the following organizations:

* Immigration and Checkpoints Authority
* Singapore Customs
* National Cadet Corps 
* National Police Cadet Corps 
* National Civil Defence Corps
* Singapore Scout Association
* Girl Guides
* Red Cross Youth
* St. John&#x27;s Ambulance Brigade
* Boys Brigade Singapore
* Girls Brigade Singapore
* SAFRA National Service Association 
* Singaporean higher educational institutions
* Singaporean secondary schools
* People&#x27;s Action Party and PAP Community Foundation
* National Trades Union Congress
* Contingents of government ministries
* Contingents of national statuory boards and state owned corporations
* Contingents of public and private NGOs
* Contingents of private local and foreign corporations
* Singapore National Olympic Council and Sport Singapore

Parades are also held in the following occasions:

* 15 February, Total Defence Day
* 8 May, NPCC Day
* 24 May, Police Day
* 1 July, SAF Day 
* 11 November, Remembrance Day
* On the occasion of the inaugurations of the president of Singapore
* On the occasion of passing out parades of the Basic Military Training Centre, Specialist Cadet School and Officer Cadet School
* Service and branch anniversaries

==== South Africa ====
The tradition of military parades in South Africa traces its origin to the Netherlands, thru the Dutch East India Company, and later on the United Kingdom. The combination of traditions from these two countries created a unique South African tradition that would be manifested in the public parades of today&#x27;s South African National Defence Force, created 1912 on the basis of the former separate regional armed forces of the country and has been in its current form since 1994, infusing traditions from the armed forces of the former Bantustans and the guerrilla forces of some of the political parties involved in South Africa until the 1990s.

Today, the parade held on Armed Forces Day held every 21 February serves as the principal military parade of the SANDF. It is a double anniversary of both the 1917 sinking of SS Mendi during the First World War, which became the country&#x27;s biggest military tragedy in history, and the 1994 reformation of the South Africa Defence Force into the current day SANDF. The national parade is held yearly in a set host city, with the service branches organizing celebrations yearly with a specific branch being tasked for the organization of the national celebrations, with responsibilities being changed year after year. Taking the salute is the president of South Africa, who is commander in chief of the Forces.

==== Turkey ====
The Turkish tradition of military parades was introduced in the 19th century as part of the Westernization and modernization of the army and navy of the then Ottoman Empire to modern standards of warfare and military ceremonial, a tradition carried on by the modern Turkish Armed Forces, whose parade drill includes high stepping, a tradition introduced in the 1900s.

Today parades held by the Turkish Armed Forces and its veterans are held in the following days:

* April 23 – National Sovereignty and Children&#x27;s Day
* May 19 – Commemoration of Atatürk, Youth and Sports Day
* August 30 – Victory Day, also principal holiday of the Armed Forces
* October 29 – Republic Day

The August 30 parade is the country&#x27;s principal parade, and features vehicle and aviation elements, many of them nationally produced, in addition to the usual marchpast.

====United Kingdom====

In the United Kingdom, a guard of honour traditionally performs the march past for whoever received the salute. In the capital of London, traditional ceremonial units that perform public duties (the King&#x27;s Guard for example) take part in military parades such as the more common Trooping the Colour on Horse Guards Parade and special parades during the jubilee years of the monarch in his or her capacity as commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces. The Household Cavalry (Blues and Royals and Life Guards) traditionally perform trot pasts in mounted formation, together with the King&#x27;s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery. These units have been known to parade in slow and quick time. Personnel of the armed forces, cadet organizations, The Royal British Legion and veterans&#x27; organizations also parade during national holidays such as Remembrance Day or Armed Forces Day, and in local Freedom of the City parades. Also common are passing out parades, which are held within training establishments of the armed services. During a regimental military parade, the regimental march of the unit is played.

====United States====

Military parades in the American capital are held quadrennially by servicemen of the United States Armed Forces during the presidential inaugural parade. These are not considered to be regular military parades however, as the parading formations are actually not entirely composed of armed servicemen.

The first known organized military procession in the United States was the Grand Review of the Armies, on May 23 and May 24, 1865, following the end of the American Civil War (1861–1865). The New York City Victory Parade of 1946 was held in mid-January in 1946 to commemorate the conclusion of World War II and the Allied victory over the Axis Powers in all theaters of the war, helped by the service of millions of Americans who served under the armed forces and the National Guard, in addition to the state defense forces. In the late 40s and the early 50s, massive parades in honor of Army Day and later Armed Forces Day were held in the capital. The most recently held military parade was the National Victory Celebration on June 8, 1991, to celebrate the conclusion of Gulf War in Iraq.

In 2018, a national debate was sparked when President Donald Trump proposed to hold a military parade on 10 November 2018 in honor of the Veterans Day holiday the next day, commonly known as the &quot;Trump Military Parade&quot;. This was seen by most as expensive and authoritarian-like and by August of that year, the Department of Defense announced that the military parade would be postponed until 2019. The 2019 Fourth of July parade was the first attended by the president of the United States in his capacity as the constitutional commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and the National Guard Bureau, with the parade route changed to include the Lincoln Memorial complex within the greater area around the National Mall. It was also the first time since the 1950s where units aside from the guards of honor, also included cadets from the military academies, units of the Armed Forces and the National Guard and the nationally produced military equipment of the services marching past in the national capital city in front of the members of government, Congress, veterans and the people of the capital.

Annual military parades, as well as armed forces and veterans&#x27; participation in civil parades are held in the following days in major cities in the country, in areas with military installations and in state capitals:

* March 29: Vietnam Veterans Day

<doc id="651615" wikidata="Q3098727" url="?curid=651615" title="Same-sex marriage in France">
<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in France since 18 May 2013, making France the thirteenth country in the world and the ninth in Europe to allow same-sex couples to marry. The legislation applies to metropolitan France as well as to all French overseas departments and territories. Polling suggests that a significant majority of French people support the legal recognition of same-sex marriage.

A bill granting same-sex couples the right to marry and jointly adopt children was introduced to the National Assembly by the Socialist government of Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault on 7 November 2012, with the support of President François Hollande who declared his intent to support the legislation during his campaign for the presidency. On 12 February 2013, the National Assembly approved the bill in a 329–229 vote. On 12 April 2013, the Senate approved the bill with amendments in a 171–165 vote, followed by the approval of the amended bill by the National Assembly on 23 April 2013 in a 331–225 vote. However, a challenge to the law by the conservative Union for a Popular Movement party was filed with the Constitutional Council following the vote. On 17 May 2013, the Council ruled that the law was constitutional. That same day, President Hollande promulgated the bill, which was officially published the next day in the . The first official same-sex marriage ceremony took place on 29 May 2013 in the city of Montpellier.

==History==
===Civil solidarity pact===
Despite the creation and implementation in 1999 of the civil solidarity pact (, ), more commonly known as PACS, a system allowing civil partnerships between two persons without regard to their gender and guaranteeing certain personal and civil rights to both &quot;pacsés&quot;, there was considerable political and societal debate over same-sex marriage in France during the first decade of the 21st century.

The civil solidarity pact was voted on by the French Parliament in November 1999 with the support of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. Following President Hollande&#x27;s signature of a 2013 legalising same-sex marriage, PACS remains in effect and available for both opposite-sex and same-sex couples.
===2004 same-sex marriage===
Mayor of the Bordeaux suburb of Bègles Noël Mamère, a former Greens presidential candidate, conducted a same-sex marriage ceremony for two men, Bertrand Charpentier and Stéphane Chapin, on 5 June 2004. Mamère claimed that there was nothing in French law to prohibit such a ceremony, and that he would appeal any challenge to the European Court of Human Rights. Minister of Justice Dominique Perben had stated that such unions would be legally void, and called for judicial intervention to halt the ceremony. On 27 July 2004, the Bordeaux Court of General Jurisdiction declared the marriage &quot;null and void&quot;. One legal argument defended by the public prosecutor, representing the national government, was that the French Civil Code contained several mentions of &quot;husband&quot; and &quot;wife&quot;, thereby implying different genders. On 19 April 2005, the Appeals Court of Bordeaux upheld the ruling, and on 14 March 2007, the Court of Cassation turned down Charpentier and Chapin&#x27;s appeal. On 9 June 2016, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the decision to invalidate Charpentier and Chapin&#x27;s marriage did not constitute an infringement of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Shortly after the ceremony took place, Interior Minister Dominique de Villepin instituted disciplinary procedures against Mamère, suspending him from his duties for one month. The local administrative court ruled that Mamère&#x27;s suspension was legal and substantiated. Mamère said he would not appeal the ruling, having already unsuccessfully attempted to get an injunction from the court, then appealing the case to the Council of State; both had ruled that an injunction was not justified on grounds of urgency. On 11 May 2004, the First Secretary of the Socialist Party, François Hollande, announced that he would ask his party to file a draft law making same-sex marriages unequivocally legal. Some other party leaders, such as former Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, publicly disapproved of same-sex marriage. Hollande&#x27;s partner, Ségolène Royal, said at the time that she harbored doubts about same-sex marriage, though now fully supports it.

===2006 parliamentary report===
A parliamentary &quot;Report on the Family and the Rights of Children&quot; was released on 25 January 2006. Although the committee recommended increasing some of the rights already granted by the PACS civil partnership, it recommended maintaining prohibitions against marriage, adoption and access to medically assisted reproduction for same-sex couples, arguing that these three issues were inseparable and that allowing them would contravene a number of articles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which France is a signatory (though many UN member nations did grant some or all of these rights to same-sex couples). Referring to the rights of children as a human rights issue, the report argued that children &quot;now have rights, and to systematically give preference to adult aspirations over respect for these rights is not possible anymore.&quot; Because of these prohibitions, left-wing members of the committee rejected the report.

===2011 bill and Constitutional Council decision===
LGBT organizations in France, believing that the prohibition of same-sex marriage was contrary to the Constitution of France, asked the Constitutional Council to examine the constitutionality of same-sex marriage and to review the articles of the Civil Code. On 28 January 2011, the Council decided that the illegality of same-sex marriages was not contrary to the Constitution, further stating that same-sex marriage legalization was a question for Parliament to decide.

On 14 June 2011, the National Assembly of France voted 293–222 against legalizing same-sex marriage. Deputies of the governing Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party mostly voted against the measure, while deputies of the Socialist Party mostly voted in favour. Members of the Socialist Party said that the legalization of same-sex marriage would become a priority should they gain a majority in the 2012 legislative election.

On 12 November 2011, Mayor Jean Vila of Cabestany performed a same-sex wedding ceremony for a couple named Patrick, 48, and Guillaume, 37. The marriage was not recorded in order to prevent a subsequent nullification, and Vila described it as a &quot;militant act&quot;, saying that &quot;there are times when it is necessary to act outside the law. Refusing same-sex marriage is to deny the reality of thousands of couples.&quot; The French Government&#x27;s reaction was mixed: the Secretary of State for Family, Claude Greff, called the event a &quot;provocation on the eve of the presidential election&quot;, while Minister of Solidarity and Social Cohesion Roselyne Bachelot said she supported same-sex marriage but that the ceremony was &quot;not the best way to advance the cause&quot;.

===2012–2013 bill===

====Passage and promulgation====

During his campaign for the 2012 presidential election, Socialist Party candidate François Hollande declared his support for same-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex couples, including them as one of his campaign&#x27;s 60 government commitments. On 6 May 2012, Hollande won the election and promised to pass same-sex marriage legislation before the spring of 2013. On 17 June, Hollande&#x27;s party won an absolute majority in the National Assembly, followed by an announcement by government spokesperson Najat Vallaud-Belkacem that a same-sex marriage bill would be adopted in spring 2013 at the latest. On 3 July, in his first speech in front of the newly elected assembly, Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that marriage and adoption for all couples would be a reality &quot;in the first semester of 2013&quot;. The draft bill was submitted to the French Parliament on 7 November 2012.

On 2 February 2013, the National Assembly approved the first article of the same-sex marriage bill by 249 votes to 97; the debate took several days as opponents introduced more than 5,000 amendments to the bill in order to slow down its passage. On 12 February, the National Assembly approved the bill as a whole in a 329–229 vote and sent it to the Senate. The Senate started debating the bill on 4 April 2013 and five days later approved its first article in a 179–157 vote. On 12 April, it approved the bill with minor amendments in a 171–165 vote. The Senate version of the marriage bill was adopted by the National Assembly on 23 April 2013 in a 331–225 vote.

The same-sex marriage law is commonly referred to in France as &quot;la loi Taubira&quot; (&quot;the Taubira law&quot;) in reference to Justice Minister Christiane Taubira who introduced the bill to the French Assembly in November 2012 and was the bill&#x27;s main sponsor. The law amended Article 143 (Book I, Title V, Chapter I) of the Napoleonic Code to state: &quot;Marriage is contracted by two persons of different or of the same sex.&quot;

====Reactions and aftermath====
The opposition Union for a Popular Movement party immediately filed a challenge against the law with the Constitutional Council. On 17 May 2013, the Council declared the law constitutional. The same day, President François Hollande promulgated the bill, which was officially published on 18 May 2013 in the . The first same-sex marriage to be recognized in France was that of Dominique Adamski and Francis Dekens, who had their marriage performed in Belgium in 2006 registered in Cayeux-sur-Mer on 23 May. The first official same-sex wedding ceremony took place on 29 May in the city of Montpellier between Vincent Autin and Bruno Boileau. The ceremony was conducted by Mayor Hélène Mandroux. The first same-sex marriage between two women took place on 1 June in Saint-Jean-de-la-Ruelle.

In June 2013, the French Government issued a circulaire stipulating a maximum sentence of 5 years&#x27; imprisonment and a fine of 75,000€ for any mayor or local official who refuses to perform a marriage for a same-sex couple on the sole basis of their sexual orientation. The official may also face discrimination charges under Article 432-7 of the Criminal Code. In October 2013, the Constitutional Council dismissed a lawsuit challenging the circulaire, ruling that it did not violate the French Constitution. The court wrote in its ruling that the circulaire &quot;ensures a good enforcement of the law and guarantees neutrality from the state&quot;. In October 2018, the European Court of Human Rights dismissed an appeal from 146 mayors in the case. In September 2015, a court in Marseille sentenced Sabrina Hout to five months&#x27; imprisonment for having refused to perform a same-sex marriage back in August 2014. Hout, who served as deputy mayor in Marseille, had been scheduled to conduct the marriage on 16 August but said she was not feeling fell and asked a local council member to perform the marriage instead. However, the council member did not have the legal authority to perform the marriage and it was later invalidated. Hout officiated at four opposite-sex marriages that same day.

In July 2018, MP Guillaume Chiche introduced a bill to legalise assisted reproduction for married and unmarried lesbian couples and single women. In June 2019, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe told the National Assembly that the government intended to have the legislation examined in the Assembly from the end of September 2019. The bill was adopted in its first reading by the National Assembly on 15 October 2019 by a vote of 359–114. It passed its second reading on 31 July 2020 by 60 votes to 37 (the low turnout being due to most Assembly members having gone on summer holidays). The Senate approved the bill in first reading on 4 February 2020 by 153 votes to 143 with 45 abstentions. The proposal would also foresee the state covering the cost of the assisted reproduction procedures for all women under 43 and allow children born with donated sperm to find out their donor&#x27;s identity when they reach the age of 18. The bill passed its final reading in the French Parliament on 29 June, and came into effect in September 2021.

There has been little political movement to abrogate the same-sex marriage law, despite some politicians, including 2017 presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, expressly calling for its repeal. Former President Nicolas Sarkozy said he favored repealing the law in 2014, but said in a 2016 interview that he had changed his mind, calling a repeal &quot;unjust, cruel and legally impossible&quot;. In 2017, the party president of The Republicans (previously the UMP), Laurent Wauquiez, said he opposed repealing the law, and in June 2019 the vice president of the National Rally, Jordan Bardella, said the matter was &quot;settled&quot;. While running in the 2022 presidential election, Le Pen said she also opposed repealing the law, tweeting on 15 April 2022, &quot;I will not take rights away from French citizens. Marriage for all will remain if I am elected President of the French Republic&quot;.

====Scope====
There had been initial confusion over whether the act applied to nationals of Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, Kosovo, Laos, Montenegro, Morocco, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia or Tunisia, as it breached bilateral agreements stipulating that the law of those countries applies rather than French law. The Court of Cassation ruled that it does in September 2015, finding the provisions excluding these countries discriminatory and contrary to French law.

==Historical recognition in Overseas France==
While Polynesian and Mayotte cultures historically practiced polygamy, there are no records of same-sex marriages as understood from a Western perspective being performed in those cultures. However, there is evidence for identities and behaviours that may be placed on the LGBT spectrum. In the Society Islands of French Polynesia, as well as in other Polynesian cultures, there exists people who fulfill a traditional, spiritual and social third gender role. They are known as &quot;māhū&quot; () in Tahitian. The &quot;māhū&quot; are assigned male at birth but express themselves as women. &quot;Being outside of the traditional male-female divide&quot;, they are raised as girls from early childhood, carry out women&#x27;s work in the home and the community, and historically often served as domestic servants of the nobility. The &quot;māhū&quot; are considered an integral part of Tahitian society; &quot;&quot;Māhū&quot; were not merely tolerated; they were regarded as a legitimate and contributory part of the ancient Polynesian community.&quot; They have been known to Europeans since the 18th century, with William Bligh, the captain of HMS &quot;Bounty&quot;, having noted the presence of &quot;men with great marks of effeminacy&quot;. Historically, if they wished to marry and have children, they would marry women. The &quot;māhū&quot; status thus created the possibility for marriages between two female-presenting individuals to be performed in Tahitian culture.

In Wallisian culture, people who occupy a similar third gender role are known as (), and it is likely that &quot;they have always existed&quot; on Wallis. Assigned male at birth, they express themselves as women and carry out women&#x27;s work in the community. They are also known as in Futunan. This structure is similar to the &quot;faʻafafine&quot; of Samoa who are considered an integral part of Samoan society. Historically, if they wished to marry and have children, they would marry women, thus creating the possibility for marriages between two female-presenting individuals to be performed in Samoan culture, though today many &quot;faʻafafine&quot; have male partners. In the Marquesas Islands, people born as male but expressing themselves as women are known as (), while people born as female but expressing themselves as men are known as (). French sociologist Laure Hins Grépin reported in 2005 that had sexual intercourse primarily with &quot;openly macho&quot; cisgender men, but did not say whether they were historically allowed to marry. They are known as in the West Uvean language, in Rapa, in Mangareva, and in Tuamotuan, though is also used. 

In Mayotte, the () occupy a similar cultural role, and are &quot;relatively well integrated into Mayotte society&quot;. They choose to obey the &quot;law of women&quot;, and can take part in the &quot;mbiwi&quot;, a traditional dance generally reserved for women. However, it is unknown if the &quot;sarambavi&quot; were historically allowed to marry.

==Marriage statistics==
In 2013, 7,367 same-sex couples were legally married in France. They made up approximately 3% of all marriages performed in that time, with three out of every five same-sex marriages involving male couples. 10,522 same-sex marriages took place in France in 2014, in around 6,000 communes, representing 4% of all marriages performed that year. Male couples accounted for about 54% of these marriages, while female couples accounted for the remaining 46%. 1,331 same-sex couples married in Paris, comprising 13.5% of the total number of weddings performed in the city that year.

From May 2013 to December 2016, approximately 32,640 same-sex marriages were performed in France. By 23 April 2018, five years after the French Parliament had approved the same-sex marriage law, approximately 40,000 same-sex couples had married in the country. This represented about 3.5% of all marriages performed during that time. The departments with the highest share of same-sex marriages were Paris (9.7%), Calvados (5.6%), Charente-Maritime (5.4%), Hérault (5.1%), Orne (4.8%), Alpes-de-Haute-Provence (4.6%), Alpes-Maritimes (4.5%) and Lot (4.4%), whereas the departments with the lowest shares were Guadeloupe (0.3%), Mayotte (0.6%), Martinique (0.6%), French Guiana (1%), Haute-Corse (1.1%), Réunion (1.2%), Ariège (1.5%) and Corse-du-Sud (1.6%).

===Overseas departments and territories===

A lesbian couple, Rosemonde Zébo and Myriam Jourdan, became the first same-sex couple to marry in Martinique in June 2013. The couple were married in Le Carbet in a ceremony alongside family, friends and well-wishers. The first same-sex wedding in Guadeloupe occurred in July 2013 in Saint-Anne between Eric Dandler and Serge Willame. The first couple to marry in Saint Barthélemy did so in August 2013 in Gustavia. In French Guiana, the first such marriage took place in August 2013 in the city of Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, and by April 2018 12 same-sex couples had married in the capital city of Cayenne. In Saint Martin, the first same-sex marriage was performed in October 2013 and officiated by politician Guillaume Arnell. The couple had rocks thrown at them and received homophobic insults as they left city hall.

In Réunion, the first same-sex marriage was performed for a lesbian couple, Laurence Serveaux and Corinne Denis, in Saint-Paul in June 2013. By July 2015, 93 same-sex couples had married on the island. In Mayotte, the first same-sex wedding was performed in September 2013 for a French-Cuban couple in Mamoudzou. The marriage was performed by Mayor Abdourahamane Soilihi, a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage. This marked the first time in modern history that a legally recognized same-sex marriage had occurred in a jurisdiction where a majority of the population follows the religion of Islam. The first marriage between a male Maorais couple was performed in March 2015. In 2022, a couple from the town of Kani-Kéli were denied the right to marry on multiple occasions. The couple were initially scheduled to get married on 12 February after months of planning, but the mayor later postponed the ceremony to 14 February, before postponing it again onto several successive dates. They accused the mayor of being &quot;scared&quot; of performing the marriage. Media reported that the couple had successfully married by May 2023. Between 2013 and May 2023, 560 same-sex marriages were performed in Mamoudzou.

The first same-sex marriage in French Polynesia took place in Haapiti, Moʻorea in July 2013. The couple who had wished for a quiet ceremony were harassed by a group of opponents of same-sex marriage. By February 2014, 11 same-sex marriages had occurred in New Caledonia, representing 1.7% of all marriages, with 9 of these being performed in the South Province and the remaining 2 in the North Province. The first same-sex marriage in the North Province was performed in Poindimié in September 2013. The same-sex marriage law does not apply to individuals governed under Kanak customary law, which recognises Kanak customs for contracts, land, family and persons. If a Kanak same-sex couple wishes to marry, they would need to renounce their customary law status and ask to be governed under French civil law.

The first same-sex marriage in Saint Pierre and Miquelon occurred in March 2014. Overall, relatively few same-sex marriages have been performed in the overseas departments and territories compared to metropolitan France. According to a 2018 report, eight same-sex marriages had been performed in Saint Barthélemy, five in French Polynesia, four in Saint Martin, two in Saint Pierre and Miquelon and one in Wallis and Futuna since legalization.

==Religious performance==
In May 2015, the United Protestant Church of France voted to allow its pastors to bless same-sex marriages. The measure, which was passed by 94 votes to 3, also includes a freedom of conscience clause allowing pastors with objections to opt out. A marriage between two lesbian pastors was celebrated in a Protestant church in Montpellier in July 2021. The assembly of the Union of Protestant Churches of Alsace and Lorraine voted in November 2019 by 36 votes to 13 to allow its pastors to bless same-sex marriages. The measure also includes a freedom of conscience clause for pastors opposed to blessing same-sex relationships.

Other religious denominations also perform and bless same-sex marriages, including Old Catholic churches, Breton Druid groups (), and Buddhist groups. The first Buddhist same-sex marriage in France occurred in 1995 near Paris between Fabrice Midal and Bruno Tyszler. On 18 February 2012, Ludovic-Mohamed Zahed married his South African partner Qiyaammudeen Jantjies-Zahed in a religious ceremony in Sevran, marking the first Muslim same-sex wedding in France. The marriage was officiated by an imam, but proved controversial in Muslim circles.

The Catholic Church opposes same-sex marriage and does not allow its priests to officiate at such marriages. In December 2023, the Holy See published &quot;Fiducia supplicans&quot;, a declaration allowing Catholic priests to bless couples who are not considered to be married according to church teaching, including the blessing of same-sex couples. Bishop of Bayonne, Lescar and Oloron Marc Aillet reacted to the declaration, &quot;I invite them [priests], if the people ask for it, to give them [same-sex couples] a blessing, provided it&#x27;s to each person individually, calling them to conversion and inviting them to ask for the help of the grace that the Lord grants to all those who ask him to conform their lives to God&#x27;s will.&quot; Bishops of the Ecclesiastical Province of Rennes said, &quot;It is appropriate to spontaneously bless, individually, each of the two persons forming a couple, whatever their sexual orientation, who humbly ask God&#x27;s blessing, with the desire to conform more and more to his holy will.&quot;

<text>Royal Highness is a style used to address or refer to some members of royal families, usually princes or princesses. Kings and their female consorts, as well as queens regnant, are usually styled &quot;Majesty&quot;.

When used as a direct form of address, spoken or written, it takes the form Your Royal Highness. When used as a third-person reference, it is gender-specific (His Royal Highness or Her Royal Highness, both abbreviated HRH) and in plural, Their Royal Highnesses (TRH).

== Origin ==
By the 17th century, all local rulers in Italy adopted the style &quot;Highness&quot;, which was once used by kings and emperors only. According to Denis Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; was created on the insistence of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, Cardinal-Infante of Spain, a younger son of King Philip III of Spain. The archduke was travelling through Italy on his way to the Low Countries and, upon meeting Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy, refused to address him as &quot;Highness&quot; unless the Duke addressed him as &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. Thus, the first use of the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot; was recorded in 1633. Gaston, Duke of Orléans, younger son of King Henry IV of France, encountered the style in Brussels and assumed it himself. His children later used the style, considering it their prerogative as grandchildren of France.

By the 18th century, &quot;Royal Highness&quot; had become the prevalent style for members of a continental reigning dynasty whose head bore the hereditary title of king or queen. The titles of family members of non-hereditary rulers (e.g., the Holy Roman Emperor, King of Poland, Princes of Moldavia and Wallachia—and even the kin of the Princes of Orange who held hereditary leadership though not monarchical position in much of the Netherlands, etc.) were less clear, varying until rendered moot in the 19th century. After dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, several of Germany&#x27;s prince-electors and other now sovereign rulers assumed the title of grand duke and with it, for themselves, their eldest sons and consorts, the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; (Baden, Hesse, Mecklenburg, Saxe-Weimar).

== African usage ==
The vast majority of African royalty that make use of titles such as &quot;prince&quot;, &quot;chief&quot; and &quot;sheikh&quot;, eschew the attendant styles often encountered in Europe. Even in the cases of the aforesaid titles, they usually only exist as courtesies and may or may not have been recognised by a reigning &quot;fons honorum&quot;. However, some traditional leaders and their family members use royal styles when acting in their official roles as representatives of sovereign or constituent states, distinguishing their status from others who may use or claim traditional titles.

For example, the Nigerian traditional rulers of the Yoruba are usually styled using the &quot;HRH The X of Y&quot; method, even though they are confusingly known as &quot;kings&quot; in English and not the princes that the HRH style usually suggests. The chiefly appellation &quot;Kabiyesi&quot; (lit. &quot;He (or She) whose words are beyond question&quot;) is likewise used as the equivalent of the HRH and other such styles by this class of royalty when rendering their full titles in the Yoruba language. 

Furthermore, the wives of the king of the Zulu peoples, although all entitled to the title of &quot;queen&quot;, do not share their husband&#x27;s style of &quot;Majesty&quot; but instead are each addressed as &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, with the possible exception of the great wife.

Another example, The Zosimli Naa is a female chieftaincy title in Ghana. The first Zosimli was Her Royal Highness, Naa Dr. Susan J Herlin. In 2022, a new Zosimli Naa, HRH Naa Ife Bell was enskinned at a colorful ceremony.

== Denmark ==
In contrast to some other European kingdoms, the kingdom of Denmark reserves the superior style of Royal Highness only to the children of the monarch and the children of the crown prince.

==Holy Roman Empire==
The title of Archduke or Archduchess of Austria was known to be complemented with the style of Royal Highness for all non-reigning members of the House of Habsburg and later the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. Even though the Habsburgs held the Imperial crown of the Holy Roman Empire, it was nominally an elective office that could not be hereditarily transmitted, so the non-reigning family members adopted the style of members of the hereditary Royal family of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia, etc.

This changed when Francis I of Austria dissolved the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, as the Archduchy of Austria was elevated to an Empire in 1804; the members of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine abandoned the style of Royal Highness in favour of the style of Imperial and Royal Highness to reflect the creation of the Empire of Austria.

At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the former empress Marie Louise of France was restored to her Imperial and Royal style and granted the title of Duchess of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla, as well as being restored to her premarital title of Archduchess and Imperial Princess of Austria, Royal Princess of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia.

== Burma ==
The title of &quot;Prince/Princess of the Burma with the accompanying style of HRH; direct translation of Burmese: &quot;Myint Myat Taw Mu Hla Thaw&quot;. 

In Burmese Royal order called for Prince: &quot;Shwe Ko Daw Gyi Phaya&quot;; &quot;Taw Phya&quot;. For Princess: &quot;Hteik Su Gyi Phaya&quot; or &quot;Hteik Su Myat Phaya&quot;; &quot;Su Phya&quot;.
That title used for Royal descendants of King Thibaw use that royal title. 

Another Kongbaung Dynasty King&#x27;s Descendants Prince and Princess are use His/ Her Imperial Royal Highness (Royal title).
* A former monarch upon abdication.
* The heir apparent to the throne.

==Netherlands==
The title of &quot;Prince/Princess of the Netherlands&quot; with the accompanying style of HRH is or may be granted by law to the following classes of persons:

* A former monarch upon abdication.
* The heir apparent to the throne.
* The husband of a female monarch.
* The spouse of the heir apparent.
* The legitimate children of the monarch and the wife of any legitimate son of the monarch.
* The legitimate children of the heir apparent.

A separate title of &quot;Prince/Princess of Orange-Nassau&quot; may be granted by law to members of the Dutch royal house or, as a personal and non-hereditary title to former members of the royal house within three months of loss of membership. A Prince/Princess of Orange-Nassau who is not also a Prince/Princess of the Netherlands is addressed as &quot;His/Her Highness&quot; without the predicate &quot;royal&quot;. That is the case for example of the children of Princess Margriet, younger daughter of the late Queen Juliana.

Finally, members of the royal house or former members of the royal house within three months of loss of their membership may be also inducted by royal decree into the Dutch nobility with a rank lower than prince/princess and, generally, the accompanying style of &quot;His/Her Highborn Lord/Lady&quot;. That is the case for example of the children of the younger brother of King Willem-Alexander, Prince Constantijn, who were given the titles of &quot;Count/Countess of Orange-Nassau&quot; and the honorific predicate of &quot;Jonkheer/Jonkvrouw van Amsberg&quot;, both hereditary in the male line.

== Norway ==
In Norway the style of Royal Highness is reserved for the children of the monarch and the eldest child of the heir apparent. Other children of the heir apparent have the style Highness, e.g. Prince Sverre Magnus of Norway.

== Spain ==

In Spain, the prince or princess of Asturias, his or her spouse and the infantes of Spain bear the style of Royal Highness. The infantes are the children of the monarch and the children of the prince or princess of Asturias. Their spouses are not infantes by marriage and do not bear the style of Royal Highness, although they usually bear the ducal title of their spouse along with the style of The Most Excellent, also used by the children of the infantes and the grandees of Spain.

The consort of a queen regnant bears the title of prince and the style of Royal Highness, although the last male consort, spouse of Queen Isabella II, was elevated to the dignity of king consort with the style of Majesty.

Finally, a regent designated outside of the royal family in the cases provided by law would bear the simpler style of Highness.

== Sweden ==
When Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden married commoner Olof Daniel Westling in 2010, the Swedish Royal Court announced that Westling would become &quot;Prince Daniel&quot; and &quot;Duke of Västergötland&quot;, corresponding in form to the style used by Swedish princes of royal birth, including Victoria&#x27;s younger brother Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland, i.e. &quot;Prince + Given name + Duke of [province]&quot;. Thus Westling was made a prince of Sweden and was granted the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, making him an official member of the Swedish royal family.

Princess Madeleine, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland married the commoner British-American banker Christopher O&#x27;Neill in 2013, but she did not adopt the surname O&#x27;Neill and instead retained the Bernadotte surname as do her children, and retained the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. Christopher O&#x27;Neill kept his own name, unlike his brother-in-law Prince Daniel (above). O&#x27;Neill was not granted royal status and has remained a private citizen, since he wished to retain his British and United States citizenships and his business. He declined Swedish citizenship and for that reason could not be a member of the Swedish Royal Family or Duke of Hälsingland and Gästrikland (his wife&#x27;s titles). To remain Swedish royalty and have succession rights to the Swedish throne, the couple&#x27;s children will have to be raised in Sweden and as members of the Church of Sweden.

Three of the sisters of King Carl XVI Gustaf were granted honorary titles of &quot;Princess&quot; (without nationality) when they married commoners but lost their &quot;Royal Highness&quot; status, as did two of his uncles earlier in the 20th century.

In October 2019, the grandchildren of King Carl XVI Gustaf retained the titles of &quot;Prince&quot; or &quot;Princess&quot; but lost the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, except for the children of the Crown Princess Victoria.

== Saudi Arabia ==
Sons, daughters, patrilineal grandsons and granddaughters of Ibn Saud are referred to by the style &quot;His/Her Royal Highness&quot; (HRH), differing from those belonging to the cadet branches, who are called &quot;His/Her Highness&quot; (HH) and in addition to that a reigning king has the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.

== United Kingdom ==

In British constitutional law, use of the style HRH or simply &quot;Royal Highness&quot; may only be conferred by letters patent. Since 1917, the style has usually been restricted to children of the monarch, or to male-line grandchildren (i.e., the children of the monarch&#x27;s sons). It is typically associated with the rank of prince or princess (although this has not always applied, an exception being Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who received the style in 1947 prior to his marriage to Princess Elizabeth but was not formally created a British prince until 1957). When a prince has another title such as Duke (or a princess the title of Duchess), they may be called &quot;HRH The Duke of ...&quot;. For instance HRH The Duke of Connaught was a prince and a member of the royal family, while a non-royal duke such as the Duke of Devonshire is not a member of the royal family, but is a member of the peerage. When Edward VIII abdicated the throne in 1936 he was granted the style and title, HRH The Duke of Windsor. The woman he then married became the Duchess of Windsor, but she was denied the style HRH.
Edward for much of the rest of his life attempted unsuccessfully to persuade the crown to grant her the style.

According to letters patent issued by King George V in 1917, the sons and daughters of sovereigns and the male-line grandchildren of sovereigns are entitled to the style. It is for this reason that the daughters of the Duke of York, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, carry the HRH status, but the children of Anne, Princess Royal, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, do not. James Mountbatten-Windsor and Lady Louise, the grandchildren of Queen Elizabeth II, at the request of their parents, Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh and Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, are styled as the children of a duke, and thus are known as Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and Earl of Wessex. Under George V&#x27;s letters patent, only the eldest son of the eldest living son of the Prince of Wales was also entitled to the style, but not younger sons or daughters of the eldest living son of the Prince of Wales. Queen Elizabeth II changed this in 2012 prior to the birth of Prince George so that all children of the eldest living son of the Prince of Wales would bear the style, returning to the position Queen Victoria had instituted in 1898. There is no mention of younger living sons of a Prince of Wales, as a result of which the children of Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Archie and Lilibet, were not automatically a prince and princess with the HRH prefix. After the death of Queen Elizabeth II, both children became entitled to the HRH style and the title of Prince and Princess respectively. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex confirmed their children would use those titles in March 2023. On 18 January 2020, Queen Elizabeth II announced that Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, would no longer use the style of His/Her Royal Highness due to their decision to step down as working members of the royal family, though they are still legally entitled to the style. On 13 January 2022, it was announced that Prince Andrew, Duke of York would no longer use the style, following a notorious lawsuit against him.

Letters patent dated 21 August 1996 stated that the wife of a member of the royal family loses the right to the style of HRH in the event of their divorce. Examples include HRH The Princess of Wales and HRH The Duchess of York whose styles changed to become Diana, Princess of Wales and Sarah, Duchess of York, respectively. These styles are in line with those of a divorced peeress.

<doc id="651620" wikidata="Q35045" url="?curid=651620" title="Potosí">
<text>Potosí, known as Villa Imperial de Potosí in the colonial period, is the capital city and a municipality of the Department of Potosí in Bolivia. It is one of the highest cities in the world at a nominal . For centuries, it was the location of the Spanish colonial silver mint. A considerable amount of the city&#x27;s colonial architecture has been preserved in the historic center of the city, which—along with the globally important Cerro Rico de Potosí—are part of a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Potosí lies at the foot of the &quot;Cerro de Potosí&quot;—sometimes referred to as the &quot;Cerro Rico&quot; (&quot;rich mountain&quot;)—a mountain popularly conceived of as being &quot;made of&quot; silver ore that dominates the city. The Cerro Rico is the reason for Potosí&#x27;s historical importance since it was the major supply of silver for the Spanish Empire until Guanajuato in Mexico surpassed it in the 18th century.

The silver was taken by llama and mule train to the Pacific coast, shipped north to Panama City, and carried by mule train across the isthmus of Panama to Nombre de Dios or Portobelo, whence it was taken to Spain on the Spanish treasure fleets. Some of the silver also made its way east to Buenos Aires, via the Rio de la Plata. Some of the silver was also transported to Acapulco, Mexico, where it was sent via the Manila Galleons to buy Asian products. Cerro de Potosí&#x27;s peak is above sea level.

Today, Potosí continues to be an important mining center, and is the largest urban center in the Department of Potosí. A growing city, Potosí is now famous for its well-preserved colonial architecture, and unusual geographic setting as one of the highest cities in the world. It features a rare cold highland climate, and is marked by its long dry period, and short but strong wet season. While famous for its dominance as a mining center in early Spanish colonial history, Potosí still sits at one of the largest silver deposit systems in the world.

==Geology==
Located in the Bolivian Tin Belt, Cerro Rico de Potosí is the world&#x27;s largest silver deposit and has been mined since the sixteenth century, producing up to 60,000 tonnes by 1996. Estimates are that much silver still remains in the mines. Potosí became the second largest city, and the site of the first mint, in the Americas. By 1891, low silver prices prompted the change to mining tin, which continued until 1985. At peak production in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the ore contained up to 40% silver.

The ore deposits reside in veins present in the dacite volcanic dome. The hill is &quot;honeycombed&quot; with underground workings, reaching from the summit to depths of . The conical hill has a reddish-brown gossan cap of iron-oxides and quartz, with grayish-blue altered dacite and many mine dumps below.

Basement rocks consist of Ordovician clastic sediments consisting of phyllite with some sandstone interbedding. At about 13.8 Ma, the dome was extruded. During the explosive process, the Venus breccia formed when the ascending dacite magma reacted with groundwater to produce a phreatic eruption. The released pressure allowed the formation of the Caracoles tuff ring on top of the breccia. The magma then extruded outward from a dike to form a volcanic dome over the tuff. The dacite dome is by at the surface and narrows down to the wide dike at depth. Hydrothermal circulation and fracturing soon followed, altering the dacite and depositing ore minerals and gangue in the veins.

==History==



===Colonial silver boom===

Founded in 1545 as a mining town, it soon produced fabulous wealth, and the population eventually exceeded 200,000 people. The city gave rise to a Spanish expression, still in use: &quot;valer un Potosí&quot; (&quot;to be worth a Potosí&quot;), meaning &quot;to be of great value&quot;. The rich mountain, Cerro Rico, produced an estimated 60% of all silver mined in the world during the second half of the 16th century.

Potosí miners at first mined the rich oxidized ores with native silver and silver chloride (cerargyrite) that could be fed directly into smelting furnaces. Especially successful were the small clay &quot;flower pot&quot; furnaces called &quot;guayras&quot;, which had been used by the Incas. By 1565, the miners had exhausted the direct-smelting ore, and silver production plummeted. Silver production was revived by the introduction of the patio process, invented by Spanish merchant Bartolomé de Medina in 1554. The patio process used mercury amalgamation to extract silver from lower-grade ores, and those containing silver sulfide (argentite), as was typical of the unoxidized ores found deeper in the mountain. In 1609, another mercury amalgamation method, the pan amalgamation process was invented in Potosí, and proved better-adapted to the conditions at Potosí.

Spanish American mines were the world&#x27;s most abundant sources of silver during this time period. Spanish America&#x27;s ability to supply a great amount of silver and China&#x27;s strong demand for this commodity which the Spanish supplied via Latin American trade with the Philippines using the Manila Galleons, resulted in a spectacular mining boom. The true champion of this boom in the silver industry was indeed the Spanish crown. By allowing private-sector entrepreneurs to operate mines under license and placing high taxes on mining profits, the Spanish empire was able to extract the greatest benefits. An example of a tax that was levied includes the &quot;quinto&quot;, a 20% severance tax on gross value. From the raw materials extracted from the mines, coins called pieces of eight were fashioned at the Potosí mint.

For Europeans, Peru–Bolivia was located in the Viceroyalty of Peru and was known as &quot;Upper Peru&quot; before becoming independent as part of Bolivia. Potosí was a mythical land of riches, it is mentioned in Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; famous novel, &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (second part, chap. LXXI) as a land of &quot;extraordinary richness&quot;. One theory holds that the mint mark of Potosí (the letters &quot;PTSI&quot; superimposed on one another) is the origin of the dollar sign.

The urban complex in the remote Andes was important enough to be designated a &quot;Villa Imperial&quot; in the hierarchy of Spanish urban settlements. Although in mountainous terrain, the core of Potosí was laid out in the standard Spanish grid pattern, where by 1610 some 3,000 Spaniards and 35,000 creoles, mostly male, were resident. Indigenous settlements outside the core were more haphazard. The villa was governed by a Spanish corregidor and town council. Some 40 notaries documented and recorded commercial transactions as well as last wills and testaments. Since Potosí was of such economic importance to the Spanish Empire, the crown bureaucracy was a significant presence. Large churches, lavishly decorated inside, were built, and friars from the Dominican, Franciscans, Augustinians, Mercederians, and Jesuits were present, but no convent for women. There was an ecclesiastical court for legal issues regarding the clergy.

=== Labor ===
Indigenous laborers were required to work in Potosí&#x27;s silver mines through the Spanish &quot;mita&quot; system of forced labor, based on an analogous &quot;mit&#x27;a&quot; system traditional to pre-Hispanic Andean society (though the &quot;mit&#x27;a&quot; directed labor for public works and collective agricultural projects). Laborers were drawn from the native population of an area that encompassed almost 200,000 square miles. Thirteen thousand men were conscripted each year, constituting about one out of every seven adult males in the indigenous population. These &quot;mitayos&quot; faced harsh conditions in the mines, where they were often given the least desirable jobs. While more skilled laborers extracted the ore, &quot;mitayos&quot; were tasked with carrying it back to the surface in baskets, leather bags, or cloth sacks.

These loads often weighed between 100 and 300 lbs, and the workers had to carry them up rickety ladders in steep, narrow shafts lit only by a candle tied to their foreheads. Many of them died or were seriously injured due to falls, accidents, and the harsh conditions of the mine life. Illness was another danger: at such a high altitude, pneumonia was always a concern, especially given the extreme and rapid changes of temperature experienced by workers climbing from the heat of the deep shafts to the freezing elements of the surface at 16,000 feet, and mercury poisoning took the lives of many involved in the refining process.

The Potosí &quot;mita&quot; caused dramatic demographic shifts in the local indigenous population as wives and children moved with workers to Potosí while thousands more fled their traditional villages, forfeiting their &quot;ayllu&quot; land rights in order to escape the labor draft. By the late 17th century, upper Peru had lost nearly 50% of its indigenous population compared to a little over a century earlier. This only increased the burden on the remaining natives, and at some point in the 1600s, up to half of the eligible male population might find themselves working at Potosí. Nevertheless, the number of &quot;mitayos&quot; dropped to about 4,000 by 1689, prompting the Viceroy Duke of Palata to raise the number again through a new census and inclusion of new populations not subject to the mita (&quot;forasteros&quot;).

The reform failed, and the Duke&#x27;s successor set the official number to 4,108 mitayos (1,367 active each week). In reality, the number of &quot;mitayos&quot; was even lower due to the increasing practice of buying oneself out of the obligation. For the remaining mita workforce, however, conditions remained harsh. Mine and mill owners notoriously ignored official regulations on provisions and especially withheld the money the Indians should receive as recompensation for their travel. Just the cost of traveling to Potosí and back could be more than a &quot;mitayo&quot; was paid in a year, and so many of them chose to remain in Potosí as wage workers when their &quot;mita&quot; was finished. Former &quot;mitayos&quot; living in Potosí were not only exempt from the draft, but usually earned considerably more due to the valuable skills they had gained in permanent services.

According to historian Noble David Cook, &quot;A key factor in understanding the impact of the Potosi mita on the Indians is that mita labor was only one form of work at the mines. A 1603 report stated that of 58,800 Indians working at Potosi, 5100 were &quot;mitayos&quot;, or fewer than one in ten. In addition to the mitayos there were 10,500 &quot;mingas&quot; (contractual workers) and 43,200 free wage earners.&quot; However, historian Peter Bakewell emphasizes the role of mita labor in Potosí to a greater extent. According to his research, though as few as 4500 &quot;mitayos&quot; were actively laboring in the mines at any given time, this was due to the &quot;mita ordinaria&quot; system, in which the up to 13,500 men conscripted per year were divided into three parts, each working one out of every three weeks. In addition, many of the remaining &quot;mingas&quot; and wage workers were either &quot;mita ordinaria&quot; workers on their off weeks or former &quot;mitayos&quot; who remained in Potosí.

Within the mines, a figure called el Tío acts as a deity of the land itself. El Tío serves as a figure of the mountain itself. Laborers within the mines offer coca leaves and alcohol to statues constructed within the mines of the deity to protect themselves from the dangerous conditions.

===Colonial-era society===
Potosí was a multiracial society, with native Andeans, Spanish settlers, and black slaves. The largest sector of the population were native men, forced to labor underground mining the silver ore, but there were considerable opportunities for merchants and native traders, who became wealthy. Suppliers of food as well as holders of urban and rural real estate prospered in Potosí. Women, particularly widows, held property, since they were guaranteed a portion of their husband&#x27;s estate under Spanish law. Small-scale female vendors dominated street markets and stalls, selling food, coca leaves, and chicha (maize beer). A portion of the female population were sex workers, which is a typical phenomenon in mining towns generally.

In the early 17th century, Basques were well established in the city and made up for a substantial number of the inhabitants in Potosí. They gathered in a confederation opposed to another one, the &quot;Vicuñas&quot;, a melting pot of natives and non-Basque Spanish and Portuguese colonists, fighting for control over ore extraction from the mines and its management. Eventually, tension among both factions came to a head, resulting in the eruption of overt armed conflict starting 1622 up to 1625. The Spanish Crown intervened, siding at one point with the Basques. Both factions reached a settlement sealed with a wedding between the son and daughter of the leaders in either side, the Basque Francisco Oyanume and the Vicuña general Castillo. One of the most famous Basque residents in Potosí (1617–19) was Catalina de Erauso, a nun who escaped her convent and dressed as a man, becoming a driver of llamas and a soldier.

===Independence era===
During the Bolivian War of Independence (1809–1825), Potosí frequently passed between the control of Royalist and Patriot forces. Major leadership mistakes came when the First Auxiliary Army arrived from Buenos Aires (under the command of Juan José Castelli), which led to an increased sense that Potosí required its own independent government.

Later, the Second Auxiliary Army (under the command of Manuel Belgrano) was forced to retreat, Belgrano made the decision to blow up the Casa de la Moneda. The natives undid the fuse, as many refused to evacuate and would have lost their lives. Two more expeditions from Buenos Aires would seize Potosí.

===Modern era===
Potosí continues to be an important administrative center, mining town, tourist attraction, and population center in modern Bolivia.

==Etymology==
There is no authoritative etymology for the word &quot;Potosí&quot;. According to legend, in about 1462, Huayna Capac, the eleventh Sapa Inca of what by then was known as the Inca Empire &quot;set out for Ccolque Porco and Andaccaua, the location of his mines from which were taken innumerable arrobas of silver&quot; (an arroba is a Spanish unit of weight equivalent to approximately ). Before leaving there, he saw Potosí, and admiring its beauty and grandeur, he said (speaking to those of his Court):
It is believed that &quot;Potosí&quot; is a Quechua word. However, in Quechua the root &quot;p&#x27;otoj&quot; does not refer to a thunderous noise, whereas it does in Aymara. Thus, if &quot;Potosí&quot; encompasses the idea of a thunderous noise, the location would have an Aymaran root rather than a Quechuan.

The actual sharp structure of the term is contrary to the nature of both Aymara and Quechua. Another explanation, given by several Quechua speakers, is that &quot;potoq&quot; is an onomatopoeic word that reproduces the sound of the hammer against the ore, and oral tradition has it that the town derived its name from this word.
==Climate==
Potosí has a rare climate for a city of its size, due to its extreme elevation at over 4,000m. Semi-arid and with average temperatures in its warmest month sitting right at 10 °C, the city&#x27;s climate straddles a subtropical highland climate, &quot;Cwc&quot;, within the Köppen climate classification, with subpolar oceanic characteristics and an alpine climate (E).

Summers are cool and wet, with daily highs rarely rising above 20 °C. Winters have cooler days with much colder nights, averaging −4 °C. These low temperatures are a result of the extreme precipitation deficit during the winter months, with the resulting aridity leading to an increased diurnal temperature variation.

==Transportation==
The city is served by Aeropuerto Capitán Nicolas Rojas, with commercial airline flights by Boliviana de Aviación, Bolivia&#x27;s flag air carrier. There is also a railroad, the Rio Mulatos-Potosí line.

==Legacy==
The city of San Luis Potosí in Mexico was named after Potosí in Bolivia. In the United States, the name Potosi was optimistically given to lead-mining towns of Potosi, Wisconsin, and Potosi, Missouri, and also to the silver-mining town of Potosi, Nevada.

<text>Terang is a town in the Western District of Victoria, Australia. The town is in the Shire of Corangamite and on the Princes Highway south west of the state&#x27;s capital, Melbourne. At the , Terang had a population of 1,824. At the 2001 census, Terang had a population of 1,859. The population of Terang has since risen according to the 2011 Census; the population is now 2,348, of which 1,155 are male and 1,193 are female, with the median age being 44.

==History==

The semi-nomadic Kirrae Wuurong clans originally inhabited the area between Mount Emu Creek and the Hopkins River, and much of their language was recorded by a Scottish squatter, James Dawson.

The first dwelling in the township area was built in 1840 by Donald McNicol, and consisted of a slab hut on the east bank of Lake Terang. The township was developed in the late 1850s, the post office opening on 1 March 1859.

The railway though the town was opened in 1887. From 1890 it was extended as part of Victoria&#x27;s south-western line. The Mortlake line once branched from the town, opened in 1893 and closed in 1978. The local railway station is served by V/Line passenger services on the Warrnambool line.

The Terang Magistrates&#x27; Court closed on 1 January 1983.

Avenues of trees were planted in the 19th century and several of these are now under the protection of the National Trust. A Heritage Trail walk points out the historic trees and many of the historic buildings and sights of the town.
Features to see are the historic post office with its clock tower (1903–4), the war memorial, the rose gardens with the band rotunda, and the town&#x27;s first church (Bible Christian Church c.1863). The Thomson Memorial church is also a significant local structure.

===Lake Terang===
Lake Terang was a lake that on its shores the town was built. To the south of the town centre is a large peat bed unique to the region. In 1933, while dry, the peat bed began burning but became a shallow lake by the 1940s. The lake was drained in the 1960s and the dried out lake floor is now used as a recreation area, for agriculture and as part of the Terang Golf Course.

===Lake Keilambete===

Lake Keilambete is a maar lake 4 km north of the town. The lake is a circular body 1.8 km in diameter and an average depth of 11 m. The salinity is twice that of seawater.

==Sport==
The town has an Australian Rules football team, Terang-Mortlake, playing in the Hampden Football League.

Terang has a horse racing club, the Terang &amp; District Racing Club, which schedules around eight race meetings a year including the Terang Cup meeting in October.

Terang Harness Racing Club conducts regular meetings at its racetrack in the town.

Golfers play on the 18-hole golf course at the Terang Golf Club on High Street at the western entrance to the town.

==Education==
Terang College is a school, established in 1848 as Terang Primary School. It educates more than 400 students from Prep to Year 12. It has two campuses: one on the western (Warrnambool) side of the town; the other on Strong Street near Cobden Road. The western campus houses years Prep to Grade 4 while the Cobden Road Campus has Years 5 - 12.

<doc id="651627" wikidata="Q6377786" url="?curid=651627" title="Katong">
<text>Katong (commonly referred to as Tanjong Katong) is a residential neighbourhood in the eastern portion of the Central Region of Singapore, within the Marine Parade planning area. The Katong district stretches from Fort Road area to the Joo Chiat area. It used to be located by the sea, before land reclamation towards the south to East Coast Park was created for housing and recreational purposes beginning in the 1960s to 1970s.

Katong was the location of many villas and mansions of the wealthy elite in the late 19th to the mid-20th centuries. They made their fortunes in the Far East and built seaside resorts, villas and manors along the beachfront of Katong, beginning from Katong Park to the end of the East Coast.

Katong&#x27;s rich cultural mix has contributed to its unique cuisine. Katong is well known among locals as a food district with a variety of shophouse restaurants serving Peranakan cuisine and particularly, a spicy Singaporean noodle soup known as Katong laksa. Its famous icons include Joo Chiat Road&#x27;s &quot;food street&quot;, Dunman food center, Koon Seng Road &amp; Everitt Road&#x27;s Peranakan conservation house, Eurasian Heritage Gallery.

==Etymology==
&quot;Tanjong Katong&quot; derived from the popular beach shoreline along the East Coast. In Malay, &quot;Tanjong&quot; means cape whilst &quot;Katong&quot; refers to a now extinct species of turtles as well as &quot;the effect of a sea mirage&quot; when looking at the shoreline. This coastal feature was located near the present Tanjong Katong Flyover across East Coast Parkway and has since disappeared due to land reclamation.

==History==

In 1822, Sir Stamford Raffles designated a plot of land between the tip of Sandy Point (present day Tanjong Rhu) and Deep Water Point (present day Tanjong Katong) as a shipyard. In order to expedite the growth of the shipping industry, the Chinese settlers living there were given compensation for moving out. By the 1860s, the ship yards were flourishing.

Many wealthy Chinese, English, Portuguese, Jewish, and Anglo-French settlers bought parcels of land in Katong beside the sea to cultivate plantations, and built business empires from trading in commodities such as cotton, coconut and gambier. One of them is the Wee family where Thiam Siew Avenue is named after them, now being The Continuum Condo. Many of these plantations can be seen along Grove Road (now Mountbatten Road). In fact, one such plantation was the Grove Estate, a coconut plantation owned by Thomas Dunman, Singapore&#x27;s first commissioner of police.

Katong developed from a weekend seaside retreat into a home for the wealthy, who built immense colonial seaside bungalows away from the hustle and bustle of town life. The wealthy suburb stretched along Meyer Road and Mountbatten Road from Katong Park to Tanjong Katong. By 1928 Katong had grown to the extent that the Inspector-General of the Singapore Police Force H. Fairburn remarked: &quot;The development of the area from Katong to Joo Chiat, which has been so rapid in the past two years, promises to continue, and from every point of view one sees the necessity of providing for a sub-divisional station in the suburb. The suburb at present possess no police station.&quot; From then on Katong encroached into Joo Chiat area from Tanjong Katong to Telok Kurau Road. East Coast Road (now divided into East Coast Road and Upper East Coast Road) had many upper-class family homes.

During the Japanese Occupation of Singapore (1942-1945), shophouses between Wilkinson Road and Goodman Road in Tanjong Katong Road were used to house comfort women from Indonesia and Korea.

The present Katong area stretches from Mountbatten Road, East Coast Road to Siglap. The Joo Chiat area of Katong was formerly an ethnic enclave of Eurasians fleeing congestion, pollution, and overcrowding in Singapore after the Great Depression.

===Kampong Amber===

In the early twentieth century, Kampong Amber, a Malay fishing village between East Coast Road and Amber Road, was a prominent landmark in the coastal area of Katong. The village was named after the adjacent Amber Road, which was in turn named after the clan name of Joseph Aaron Elias, a prominent property owner in early-20th-century Singapore.

The inhabitants of Kampong Amber were mostly Malay fishermen, who lived in thatched timber houses on stilts, irregularly clustered into a porous urban fabric. Between these houses were many large communal spaces, where the inhabitants spent much of their time, engaging in activities such as plucking beansprout, pounding chili paste, and talking to their neighbors. Since the salty soil was unfriendly to agriculture, the villagers largely depended on the ocean for their livelihoods.

Just across Amber Road were the beachfront bungalows of wealthy Peranakan businessmen, notably Lee Choon Guan and his wife, who owned the land which Kampong Amber sits on. Mr and Mrs Lee allowed the villagers to live in Kampong Amber rent-free; as a show of appreciation, the villagers held an annual parade on Mrs Lee&#x27;s birthday.

As part of the 1971 Concept Plan, land reclamation along the East Coast was carried out between 1963 and 1985. This reclaimed land transformed the swampy coastline with its foul smells into a scenic vista of white sandy beaches, and made it a desirable location for high-end residential developments; at the same time, the reclaimed land and increased motor vehicle traffic on the road combined to separate the villagers of Kampong Amber from the ocean on which they depended.

As Singapore continued to industrialise through the 1970s, Kampong Amber was among the kampongs destroyed to make room for economic developments: first four- to eight-storey residential buildings, then high-rise flats. The occupants were relocated to newly-built, government-subsidised flats. In a 2003 master plan, the land was parcelled out for further development.

A few remnants of earlier Kampong Amber survived the process of industrialization. The iconic car porch of the Butterfly House, a beachfront bungalow built in 1912 by Regent A. J. Bidwell, was incorporated into a new 18-storey condo. Another surviving early Kampong Amber landmark is the Chinese Swimming Club, founded in 1909 and moved to a permanent site at Amber Road in 1921. Originally a Chinese response to the European-only Singapore Swimming-club founded by the British in 1894, the Chinese Swimming Club was sponsored by wealthy philanthropist Lee Choon Guan. The club went on to become a social gathering place, a training location for many world-class athletes, and a prominent local landmark that drew visits from figures including Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, President Wee Kim Wee, and President Tony Tan Keng Yam. Today, the club extends membership to non-Chinese residents.

==Highlights==
The area is traditionally associated with the Eurasian and Peranakan community. However, many high-rise apartment blocks now stand alongside the traditional shophouses and Peranakan terrace houses. In 1993, the Joo Chiat neighbourhood which comprises the historical centre of Katong, with its uniquely Singaporean architecture mixing Chinese, Peranakan and English colonial styles, was designated a national heritage conservation area by the Singapore Government. The conservation area consists of many shop houses which are refurnished into cafes as well as specialty shops.

==Residents==
It was home to the earlier scions of the Englishmen Lord Mountbatten of Burma and Cathay Organisation film magnate, Loke Wan Tho. Its illustrious residents include the ancestral family of Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong. The former President Sellapan Ramanathan lived in Katong in his primary residence on Ceylon Road. Also home to performance artist Nicholas Tee.

==Politics==
Katong is part of the Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency whose Member of Parliament is Former Prime Minister and Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong (Marine Parade), Fatimah Lateef (Geylang Serai) and Edwin Tong (Joo Chiat) of the People&#x27;s Action Party. More than half of Katong falls under SM Goh&#x27;s Marine Parade constituency.

<text>Dyatkovo (, ) is a town and the administrative center of Dyatkovsky District in Bryansk Oblast, Russia. Population: 

==History==
It was first mentioned in 1626, but it mostly stagnated until 1785, when after the death of Akim Vasilyevich Maltsov, his widow, Marya, bought out a factory from Yevdokiya, the widow of Alexander Vasilyevich Maltsov, and decided to expand its production. In 1790, in a forest near Dyatkovo, Marya Maltsova built the now famous glass and crystal factory, the quality of products of which was comparable to that of the plant in Gus. The workers&#x27; settlement around the plant soon grew in size and absorbed the village of Dyatkovo.

In 1798, the ownership of the company passed to Ivan Akimovich Maltsov, who created an entire industrial empire centered in Dyatkovo. In 1853, his business was continued by his son Sergey. By then, 100,000 people were employed by Maltsov&#x27;s factories, which had their own currency, police force, and a long railway.

In 1918, when all of the Maltsov&#x27;s factories were nationalized, the &quot;State Maltsov Factory District&quot; trust centered in Dyatkovo was established. In 1929, Dyatkovsky District produced about 10% of all the window glass produced in the Soviet Union.

Town status was granted to Dyatkovo in 1938.

Bryansk Oblast was a center of partisan movement during World War II. The German Army occupied Dyatkovo on October 9, 1941. In February 1942, Soviet partisans managed to retake power in Dyatkovo and neighboring villages. The area was deeply inside Nazi-occupied territory. The partisans ran a hospital and various shops but were overrun by the Nazis in June 1942. The Red Army retook Dyatkovo on September 15, 1943.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Dyatkovo serves as the administrative center of Dyatkovsky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with five rural localities, incorporated within Dyatkovsky District as Dyatkovsky Urban Administrative Okrug. As a municipal division, Dyatkovsky Urban Administrative Okrug is incorporated within Dyatkovsky Municipal District as Dyatkovskoye Urban Settlement.

==Economy and culture==
Dyatkovo is most noted for its lead crystal factory, furniture factory, and the Lead Crystal Museum, the largest museum of artistic glass in the country.

==Religion==
The Dyatkovo Transfiguration Church was opened in 1810. Its paintings were done in the Italian style and the iconostasis was made of crystal, as was the church&#x27;s enormous chandelier. After the demolition of the church in 1929, the crystal iconostasis was lost. In 2003, new Dyatkovo church was built in honor of the icon &quot; (Неопалимая купина, &quot;Burning Bush&quot;). The church possesses the world&#x27;s only crystal iconostasis, which was made by the Dyatkovo Crystal Factory and which weighs about three tons.

==Popular culture==
* Episode 11 of season 5 of &quot;The Americans&quot; was titled &quot;Dyatkovo&quot;, with a plot thread involving fictional Nazi war crimes in Dyatkovo.

<doc id="651649" wikidata="Q17053063" url="?curid=651649" title="Baseball in Taiwan">
<text>Baseball is a major sport in Taiwan that is often characterized as the national sport (). It was introduced during the Japanese rule era around 1897 and gained popularity over time, culminating in some successes of Taiwanese teams in the Japanese system. The sport remained popular following the retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan despite the Kuomintang (KMT) government&#x27;s deliberate policy of removing cultural links to Japan.

In the shifting international environment that eventually led to the ROC&#x27;s departure from the United Nations, the KMT government hijacked baseball as a tool for nation-building, pouring massive resources into the sport in the hopes of forging a stronger national identity.

The highest level of baseball in Taiwan is the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) founded in 1989. 

== History ==
=== Introduction and early years ===

Baseball was introduced to Taiwan around 1897, but it initially remained a game for Japanese bureaucrats and bankers in the colonial seat of Taihoku (modern-day Taipei). The first official baseball team in Taiwan was formed in 1904, when the island was a Japanese colony, by the Middle School of the Taiwan Governor-General&#x27;s National Language School (present-day Chien Kuo Senior High School). The first organized baseball game was played between this team and the team of the Normal School of the Taiwan Governor-General&#x27;s National Language School (present-day Taipei Municipal University of Education) in March 1906.

From 1906 through the mid-1920s, Taiwanese baseball teams consisted mainly of Japanese players. Taiwanese did not become actively involved in the sport until the mid-1920s. Around 1921, the first team made up of indigenous Taiwanese peoples was established in eastern Taiwan, and it was reorganized into the Noko (; also known as &quot;Nenggao&quot;) team. As part of the reorganization, Japanese officials offered players on the team the opportunity to attend the Hualien Agricultural School.

That the Noko team consisted completely of indigenous Taiwanese, rather than Japanese or Han Taiwanese players, was a milestone in racial integration, albeit often noted through a colonial lens. Nonetheless, the success and popularity of the team laid the foundation for the further development of baseball in southern Taiwan, notably Takao First Public School in present-day Qijin, Kaohsiung, and Mawuku Public School in present-day Taitung County.

=== Colonial participation ===

By 1931, high school baseball had become very popular in Taiwan, even though of all players dating back to 1923 in the Islandwide High School Baseball Tournaments, only 5.2% were ethnic Taiwanese. The baseball team of Kagi Agriculture and Forestry Institute, hailing from southern Taiwan, played its way into the final of that year’s Summer Koshien tournament. The team arrived as one of 22 district representatives out of a total of 631 team across the empire. Historians have noted the significance of the &quot;tri-ethnic&quot; Kano squad, consisting of Japanese, Han Taiwanese, and indigenous Taiwanese students.

== Professional baseball ==
Professional baseball in Taiwan started with the founding of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) in 1989. At its 1997 peak, Taiwan had two leagues and 11 professional teams. The competing Taiwan Major League ran from 1997 until its absorption by the CPBL in 2003.

The professional game has had several game-fixing scandals which had led to sharp declines in game attendance. However, as of 2016 baseball in Taiwan had begun to see a renewed interest in the sport in spite of this setback due to major cheating scandals.

=== Chinese Professional Baseball League ===

The Chinese Professional Baseball League was founded in 1989 with four teams and grew to seven. As of 2009, however, there were just four teams competing for the championship of the Taiwan Series.

Since 2005, the winner of the Taiwan Series represents Taiwan in the Asia Series, competing with the championship teams of Japan and South Korea, and with China&#x27;s professional leagues.

=== Taiwan Major League ===

The Taiwan Major League was founded in 1997 by the chairman of TVBS, a popular cable TV channel company, after it lost the nine-year (1997 to 2006) broadcasting rights for CPBL games to Videoland Television Network. TVBS had held the broadcasting rights from 1993 to 1996.

The TML was meant to compete with the CPBL, but after 6 years of financial losses, it merged with the CPBL in 2003.

== International play ==
Teams from Taiwan dominated Little League World Series in the 1970s and 1980s.

Taiwan&#x27;s dominance in international baseball was demonstrated when the men&#x27;s team won top three medals across all levels of baseball in 2022, including the U-12, U-15, U-18, U-23, and Baseball5 competitions, the only team to do so in baseball history. Taiwan&#x27;s men&#x27;s baseball team and women&#x27;s baseball team are world No.2 in the WBSC Rankings as of December 2021.

== Exporting talent ==
Taiwan has produced great baseball talent, but its best players usually leave for the higher salaries offered by professional teams in Japan, the United States or Canada. In the 1980s, Taiwanese pitchers Tai-Yuan Kuo and Katsuo Soh (莊勝雄) posted impressive numbers at the Seibu Lions and Chiba Lotte Marines, in Japan&#x27;s Nippon Professional Baseball. Young stars, such as outfielder Chin-Feng Chen and pitchers Chien-Ming Wang, Chin-Hui Tsao, and Hong-Chih Kuo, became the first group of Taiwanese players to play for teams in North American Major League Baseball.

<text>Major-General Sir Francis de Rottenburg, baron de Rottenburg (4 November 1757 – 24 April 1832) was a military officer and colonial administrator who served in the armies of the Kingdom of France and later the United Kingdom.

==Early life and service==

Franz von Rottenburg was born in Danzig, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth on 4 November 1757, the son of Franz Gottlieb von Rottenburg (2 April 1725 – 2 March 1799) and Anna Maria Brunati (20 April 1739 – 15 October 1799). He served in the French Royal Army, under the name de Rottenburg rather than von Rottenburg, from March 1782 to September 1791, his service ending during the early years of the French Revolution, then returning to Danzig and commanding a battalion of infantry in Tadeusz Kościuszko&#x27;s uprising. 

In December 1795, de Rottenburg joined the British Army, serving in Hompesch&#x27;s Hussars, a unit of foreign-born troops. In 1796 he helped to establish Hompesch&#x27;s Light Infantry, which later became part of the 5th Battalion of the 60th Regiment of Foot. This battalion was formed mainly from German émigrés. De Rottenburg rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the unit, and commanded it during the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and the capture of Suriname in 1799.

De Rottenburg wrote a series of manuals (initially in German) which became the basis for the training of riflemen and light infantry under Sir John Moore. He later commanded a brigade of light troops in the Walcheren Campaign.

==Service in North America==

De Rottenburg was promoted to Major General on the staff in British North America and arrived in Canada in 1810. When the War of 1812 with the United States broke out, he assumed command of the Montreal district. He assumed responsibility for both the civil and military leadership of Lower Canada on two occasions during the absence of Sir George Prevost, the commander in chief.

In 1813, he succeeded Major General Sir Roger Hale Sheaffe as military and civil commander in Upper Canada. He was accused of neglecting civil duties and of being unduly cautious in his military decisions. He refused to send reinforcements to Major General Henry Procter, commanding on the Detroit frontier, and this ultimately led to the British defeats at the Battle of Lake Erie and the Battle of Moraviantown. He later imposed martial law in the Eastern and Johnstown districts to force farmers to sell supplies to the army, an unpopular move which his successor repealed but was nevertheless forced to reimpose upon all of Upper Canada.

In December 1813, de Rottenburg was succeeded by Lieutenant General Sir Gordon Drummond, and returned to his previous posts in Lower Canada. Later in 1814, substantial British reinforcements arrived in Canada. Sir George Prevost prepared to invade the United States by way of Lake Champlain. He placed de Rottenburg in command of a division of three brigades (led by Major Generals Manley Power, Thomas Brisbane and Frederick Philipse Robinson). However, Prevost personally led the campaign, which was defeated at the Battle of Plattsburgh. Prevost, de Rottenburg and their staffs were criticised by the three brigade commanders, all of whom had seen much action in the Peninsular War, for their lack of fortitude at Plattsburgh.

==Later life==
De Rottenburg was recalled to Britain in December 1814 and left Quebec in July 1815. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1817 and Knight Bachelor on 12 February 1818. He was promoted to Lieutenant General on 12 August 1819. He died in Portsmouth on 24 April 1832.

==Family==
De Rottenburg had married Juliana Wilhelmina Carolina von Orelli, the daughter of Johann Ulrich von Orelli, a Neapolitan general, in Bratislava on 4 January 1802. They had one son and one daughter:
* George Frederick de Rottenburg was a British Army officer who arrived in Canada in 1830s and was militia officer in Upper Canada. Rottenburg left Canada in 1852.
* Frances de Rottenburg married Lord William Paget in 1827, with issue. She died 6 May 1875.

<text>The Desna (; ) is a river in Russia and Ukraine, a major left-tributary of the Dnieper. Its name means &quot;right hand&quot; in the Old East Slavic language. It has a length of , and its drainage basin covers .

In Ukraine, the river&#x27;s width ranges from , with its average depth being . The mean annual discharge at its mouth is . The river freezes over from early December to early April, and is navigable from Novhorod-Siverskyi to its mouth, a length of about .

The water level of the river reached its lowest recorded point in 140 years in June 2020. This water level was 5 m (16 ft) below normal for that time of year.

==Geography==

===Course===

The Desna originates in the Smolensk Heights of Smolensk Oblast, Russia. The river&#x27;s source lies in Yelninsky District, east-southeast from the city of Smolensk and not far from Yelnya in a forest near the village of Naleti. The Desna then flows south through a low and swampy valley toward the city of Bryansk, where the river&#x27;s right bank rises.

After its confluence with the Seym near the Russian-Ukrainian border, the river then widens, splitting into numerous smaller branches. Its right bank declines again near the city of Chernihiv, and again near one of its tributaries, the Oster, where the Desna continues its course through a low, muddy plain until it finally reaches its mouth near Kyiv at the Dnieper River.

===Tributaries===

The Desna has many tributaries. The most significant (length more than 100 km) are, from source to mouth:

* Vetma (left)
* Bolva (left)
* Navlya (left)
* Nerussa (left)
* Sudost (right)
* Ubid (right)
* Seym (left)
* Snov (right)
* Oster (left)
===Cities and towns on the Desna===

* Yelnya, Russia
* Desnogorsk, Russia
* Zhukovka, Russia
* Seltso, Russia
* Bryansk, Russia
* Trubchevsk, Russia
* Novhorod-Siverskyi, Ukraine
* Chernihiv, Ukraine
* Oster, Ukraine
* Kyiv, Ukraine
* Snov&#x27;yanka, Ukraine

The Svensky Monastery is located at the confluence of the Desna and the Sven River.

<doc id="651663" wikidata="Q756118" url="?curid=651663" title="Atlanta campaign">
<text>The Atlanta campaign was a series of battles fought in the Western Theater of the American Civil War throughout northwest Georgia and the area around Atlanta during the summer of 1864. Union Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman invaded Georgia from the vicinity of Chattanooga, Tennessee, beginning in May 1864, opposed by the Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston.

Johnston&#x27;s Army of Tennessee withdrew toward Atlanta in the face of successive flanking maneuvers by Sherman&#x27;s group of armies. In July, the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, replaced Johnston with the more aggressive General John Bell Hood, who began challenging the Union Army in a series of costly frontal assaults. Hood&#x27;s army was eventually besieged in Atlanta and the city fell on September 2, setting the stage for Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea and hastening the end of the war.

==Background==

===Military situation===

The Atlanta campaign followed the Union victory in the Battles for Chattanooga in November 1863; Chattanooga was known as the &quot;Gateway to the South&quot;, and its capture opened that gateway. After Ulysses S. Grant was promoted to general-in-chief of all Union armies, he left his favorite subordinate from his time in command of the Western Theater, William T. Sherman, in charge of the Western armies. Grant&#x27;s strategy was to apply pressure against the Confederacy in several coordinated offensives. While he, George G. Meade, Benjamin Butler, Franz Sigel, George Crook, and William W. Averell advanced in Virginia against Robert E. Lee, and Nathaniel Banks attempted to capture Mobile, Alabama, Sherman was assigned the mission of defeating Johnston&#x27;s army, capturing Atlanta, and striking through Georgia and the Confederate heartland.

==Opposing forces==

===Union===


At the start of the campaign, Sherman&#x27;s Military Division of the Mississippi consisted of three armies:
* Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee (Sherman&#x27;s army under Grant in 1863), including the corps of Maj. Gen. John A. Logan (XV Corps), Maj. Gen. Grenville M. Dodge (XVI Corps), and Maj. Gen. Francis P. Blair Jr. (XVII Corps). When McPherson was killed at the Battle of Atlanta, Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard replaced him.
* Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield&#x27;s Army of the Ohio, consisting of Schofield&#x27;s XXIII Corps and a cavalry division commanded by Maj. Gen. George Stoneman.
* Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas&#x27;s Army of the Cumberland, including the corps of Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard (IV Corps), Maj. Gen. John M. Palmer (XIV Corps), Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker (XX Corps), and Brig. Gen. Washington L. Elliott (Cavalry Corps). After Howard took army command, David S. Stanley took over IV Corps.

On paper at the beginning of the campaign, Sherman outnumbered Johnston 98,500 to 50,000, but his ranks were initially depleted by many furloughed soldiers, and Johnston received 15,000 reinforcements from Alabama. However, by June, a steady stream of reinforcements brought Sherman&#x27;s strength to 112,000.

===Confederate===


Opposing Sherman, the Army of Tennessee was commanded first by Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, who was relieved of his command in mid-campaign and replaced by Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood. The four corps in the 50,000-man army were commanded by:
* Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee (divisions of Maj. Gens. Benjamin F. Cheatham, Patrick R. Cleburne, William H. T. Walker, and William B. Bate).
* Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood (divisions of Maj. Gens. Thomas C. Hindman, Carter L. Stevenson, and Alexander P. Stewart).
* Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk (also called the Army of Mississippi, with the infantry divisions of Maj. Gen. William W. Loring, Samuel G. French, and Edward C. Walthall, and a cavalry division under Brig. Gen. William Hicks Jackson). When Polk was killed on June 14, Loring briefly took over as commander of the corps but was then replaced by Alexander P. Stewart on June 23.
* Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler (Cavalry corps, with the divisions of Maj. Gen. William T. Martin and Brig. Gens. John H. Kelly and William Y. C. Humes).

Johnston was a conservative general with a reputation for withdrawing his army before serious contact would result; this was certainly his pattern against George B. McClellan in the Peninsula Campaign of 1862. But in Georgia, he faced the much more aggressive Sherman. Johnston&#x27;s army repeatedly took up strongly entrenched defensive positions in the campaign. Sherman prudently avoided suicidal frontal assaults against most of these positions, instead maneuvering in flanking marches around the defenses as he advanced from Chattanooga towards Atlanta. Whenever Sherman flanked the defensive lines (almost exclusively around Johnston&#x27;s left flank), Johnston would retreat to another prepared position. Both armies took advantage of the railroads as supply lines, with Johnston shortening his supply lines as he drew closer to Atlanta, and Sherman lengthening his own.

==Summary==
==Battles==
===Sherman vs. Johnston===



====Rocky Face Ridge (May 7–13, 1864)====

Johnston had entrenched his army on the long, high mountain of Rocky Face Ridge and eastward across Crow Valley. Sherman had earlier decided to demonstrate against the strong Confederate position with the bulk of his force while he sent a smaller portion through Snake Creek Gap, to the right, to hit the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad at Resaca, Georgia. With sufficient men, the Union Army could cut off the Confederate lines of communication to the south and force Johnston to attack them or disperse his army traveling through the rough terrain to the east. The larger Union force engaged the enemy at Buzzard Roost (Mill Creek Gap) and at Dug Gap drawing away their attention. In the meantime, the third column, under McPherson, passed unnoticed through Snake Creek Gap and on May 9 advanced to the outskirts of Resaca, where it found a small Confederate force entrenched. Fearing defeat, McPherson pulled his column back to Snake Creek Gap, which Sherman&#x27;s orders gave him authority to do. On May 10, Sherman decided to take most of his men and join McPherson to take Resaca. The next morning, as he discovered Sherman&#x27;s army withdrawing from their positions in front of Rocky Face Ridge, Johnston retired south towards Resaca. So began the first of a long series of flanking maneuvers by Sherman against Johnston; Sherman became so good at the tactic that his men boasted that Sherman &quot;could flank the devil out of hell, if necessary.&quot; Johnston would be flanked out of every position he held until eventually relieved of command. The opportunity to destroy or disorganize the Confederates in the campaign&#x27;s first battle, however, was missed.

====Resaca (May 13–15)====

Union troops tested the Confederate lines around Resaca to pinpoint their whereabouts. Full scale fighting occurred on May 14, and the Union troops were generally repulsed except on Johnston&#x27;s right flank, where Sherman did not fully exploit his advantage. On May 15, the battle continued with no advantage to either side until Sherman sent a force across the Oostanaula River at Lay&#x27;s Ferry, towards Johnston&#x27;s railroad supply line. Unable to halt this Union movement, Johnston was forced to retire.

====Adairsville (May 17)====

Johnston&#x27;s army retreated southward while Sherman pursued. Failing to find a good defensive position south of Calhoun, Johnston continued to Adairsville while the Confederate cavalry fought a skillful rearguard action. On May 17, Howard&#x27;s IV Corps ran into entrenched infantry of Hardee&#x27;s corps, while advancing about north of Adairsville. Three Union divisions prepared for battle, but Thomas halted them because of the approach of darkness. Sherman then concentrated his men in the Adairsville area to attack Johnston the next day. Johnston had originally expected to find a valley at Adairsville of suitable width to deploy his men and anchor his line with the flanks on hills, but the valley was too wide, so Johnston disengaged and withdrew.

====New Hope Church (May 25–26)====

After Johnston retreated to Allatoona Pass from May 19 to 20, Sherman decided that attacking Johnston there would be too costly, so he determined to move around Johnston&#x27;s left flank and steal a march toward Dallas. Johnston anticipated Sherman&#x27;s move and met the Union forces at New Hope Church. Sherman mistakenly surmised that Johnston had a token force and ordered Hooker&#x27;s XX Corps to attack. This corps was severely mauled. On May 26, both sides entrenched.

====Dallas (May 26 – June 1)====

Sherman&#x27;s army tested the Confederate line. On May 28, Hardee&#x27;s corps probed the Union defensive line, held by Logan&#x27;s XV Corps, to exploit any weakness or possible withdrawal. Fighting ensued at two different points, but the Confederates were repulsed, suffering high casualties. Sherman continued looking for a way around Johnston&#x27;s line, and on June 1, his cavalry occupied Allatoona Pass, which had a railroad and would allow his men and supplies to reach him by train. Sherman abandoned his lines at Dallas on June 5 and moved toward the railhead at Allatoona Pass, forcing Johnston to follow soon afterward.

====Pickett&#x27;s Mill (May 27)====

After the Union defeat at New Hope Church, Sherman ordered Howard to attack Johnston&#x27;s seemingly exposed right flank. The Confederates were ready for the attack, which did not unfold as planned because supporting troops never appeared. The Confederates repulsed the attack, causing high casualties.

====Operations around Marietta (June 9 – July 3)====

When Sherman first found Johnston entrenched in the Marietta area on June 9, he began extending his lines beyond the Confederate lines, causing some Confederate withdrawal to new positions. On June 14, Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk was killed by an artillery shell while scouting enemy positions with Hardee and Johnston and was temporarily replaced by Maj. Gen. William W. Loring. On June 18–19, Johnston, fearing envelopment, moved his army to a new, previously selected position astride Kennesaw Mountain, an entrenched arc-shaped line to the west of Marietta, to protect his supply line, the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad. Sherman made some unsuccessful attacks on this position but eventually extended the line on his right and forced Johnston to withdraw from the Marietta area on July 2–3.

====Kolb&#x27;s Farm (June 22)====

Having encountered entrenched Confederates astride Kennesaw Mountain stretching southward, Sherman fixed them in front and extended his right wing to envelop their flank and menace the railroad. Johnston countered by moving Hood&#x27;s corps from the left flank to the right on June 22. Arriving in his new position at Mt. Zion Church, Hood decided on his own to attack. Warned of Hood&#x27;s intentions, Union generals John Schofield and Joseph Hooker entrenched. Union artillery and swampy terrain thwarted Hood&#x27;s attack and forced him to withdraw with heavy casualties. Although he was the victor, Sherman&#x27;s attempts at envelopment had momentarily failed.

====Kennesaw Mountain (June 27)====
This battle was a notable exception to Sherman&#x27;s policy in the campaign of avoiding frontal assaults and moving around the enemy&#x27;s left flank. Sherman was sure that Johnston had stretched his line on Kennesaw Mountain too thin and decided on a frontal attack with some diversions on the flanks. On the morning of June 27, Sherman sent his troops forward after an artillery bombardment. At first, they made some headway overrunning Confederate pickets south of the Burnt Hickory Road, but attacking an enemy that was dug in was futile. The fighting ended by noon, and Sherman suffered heavy casualties, about 3,000, compared with 1,000 for the Confederates. Johnston fell back toward Smyrna on July 3 and by July 4 to a defensive line along the west bank of the Chattahoochee River that became known as Johnston&#x27;s River Line.

====Pace&#x27;s Ferry (July 5)====
Johnston put the Chattahoochee River between his army and Sherman&#x27;s. General Howard&#x27;s IV corps advanced on Pace&#x27;s Ferry on the river. The Confederate pontoon bridge there was defended by dismounted cavalry. They were driven away by BG Thomas J. Wood&#x27;s division of IV Corps. The bridge, although damaged, was captured. Howard decided not to force a crossing against increased Confederate opposition. When federal pontoons arrived on July 8, Howard crossed the river and outflanked the Pace&#x27;s Ferry defenders. This forced them to withdraw; and this permitted Sherman to cross the river, advancing closer to Atlanta. Johnston abandoned the River Line and retired south of Peachtree Creek, about north of Atlanta.

===Sherman vs. Hood===
 Due to public pressure, Confederate President Jefferson Davis had become increasingly irate at Johnston giving ground. Finally, on July 17, Davis stripped Johnston of command and replaced him with John Bell Hood. Hood may have seemed a more able commander than Johnston, especially on the attack, as seen at Gettysburg, but the Army of Tennessee was short on men, talent, and luck. Sherman had been frustrated by Johnston&#x27;s defensive tactics and was reportedly pleased with the change as the aggressive Hood was more willing to do open battle, thus giving Sherman opportunities to use his superior numbers and firepower to destroy Confederate forces. 

====Peachtree Creek (July 20)====
After crossing the Chattahoochee, Sherman split his army into three columns for the assault on Atlanta with Thomas&#x27; Army of the Cumberland, on the left, moving from the north. Schofield and McPherson had drawn away to the east, leaving Thomas on his own. Johnston decided to attack Thomas as he crossed the creek, but Confederate President Jefferson Davis relieved him of command and appointed Hood to take his place. Hood adopted Johnston&#x27;s plan and attacked Thomas after his army crossed Peachtree Creek. The determined assault threatened to overrun the Union troops at various locations, but eventually the Union held, and the Confederates fell back. The advance of McPherson from the east side of Atlanta distracted Hood from his offensive and drew off Confederate troops that might have joined the attack on Thomas.

====Atlanta (July 22)====


Hood was determined to attack McPherson&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee. He withdrew his main army at night from Atlanta&#x27;s outer line to the inner line, enticing Sherman to follow. In the meantime, he sent William J. Hardee with his corps on a fifteen-mile (24 km) march to hit the unprotected Union left and rear, east of the city. Wheeler&#x27;s cavalry was to operate farther out on Sherman&#x27;s supply line, and Cheatham&#x27;s corps was to attack the Union front. Hood, however, miscalculated the time necessary to make the march, and Hardee was unable to attack until afternoon. Although Hood had outmaneuvered Sherman for the time being, McPherson was concerned about his left flank and sent his reserves—Dodge&#x27;s XVI Corps—to that location. Two of Hood&#x27;s divisions ran into this reserve force and were repulsed. The Confederate attack stalled on the Union rear but began to roll up the left flank. Around the same time, a Confederate soldier shot and killed McPherson when he rode out to observe the fighting. Determined attacks continued, but the Union forces held. About 4 p.m., Cheatham&#x27;s corps broke through the Union front, but massed artillery near Sherman&#x27;s headquarters halted the Confederate assault. Logan&#x27;s XV Corps then led a counterattack that restored the Union line. The Union troops held, and Hood suffered high casualties.

Despite being called the Battle of Atlanta, the city itself would not fall until September.

====Ezra Church (July 28)====
Sherman&#x27;s forces had previously approached Atlanta from the east and north and had not been able to break through, so Sherman decided to attack from the west. He ordered Howard&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee to move from the left wing to the right and cut Hood&#x27;s last railroad supply line between East Point and Atlanta. Hood foresaw such a maneuver and sent the two corps of Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee and Lt. Gen. Alexander P. Stewart to intercept and destroy the Union force at Ezra Church. Howard had anticipated such a thrust, entrenched one of his corps in the Confederates&#x27; path, and repulsed the determined attack, inflicting numerous casualties. Howard, however, failed to cut the railroad. Concurrent attempts by two columns of Union cavalry to cut the railroads south of Atlanta ended in failure, with one division under Maj. Gen. Edward M. McCook completely smashed at the Battle of Brown&#x27;s Mill and the other force also repulsed and its commander, Maj. Gen. George Stoneman, taken prisoner.

====Utoy Creek (August 5–7)====

After failing to envelop Hood&#x27;s left flank at Ezra Church, Sherman still wanted to extend his right flank to hit the railroad between East Point and Atlanta. He transferred Schofield&#x27;s Army of the Ohio from his left to his right flank and sent him to the north bank of Utoy Creek. Although Schofield&#x27;s troops were at Utoy Creek on August 2, they, along with the XIV Corps, Army of the Cumberland, did not cross until August 4. Schofield&#x27;s force began its movement to exploit this situation on the morning of August 5, which was initially successful. Schofield then had to regroup his forces, which took the rest of the day. The delay allowed the Confederates to strengthen their defenses with abatis, which slowed the Union attack when it restarted on the morning of August 6. The Federals were repulsed with heavy losses and failed in an attempt to break the railroad. On August 7, the Union troops moved toward the Confederate main line and entrenched. They remained there until late August.

====Dalton (August 14–15)====

Wheeler and his cavalry raided into North Georgia to destroy railroad tracks and supplies. They approached Dalton in the late afternoon of August 14 and demanded the surrender of the garrison. The Union commander refused to surrender and fighting ensued. Greatly outnumbered, the Union garrison retired to fortifications on a hill outside the town where they successfully held out, although the attack continued until after midnight. Around 5 a.m. on August 15, Wheeler retired and became engaged with relieving infantry and cavalry under Maj. Gen. James B. Steedman&#x27;s command. Eventually, Wheeler withdrew.

====Lovejoy&#x27;s Station (August 20)====
While Wheeler was absent raiding Union supply lines from North Georgia to East Tennessee, Sherman sent cavalry Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick to raid Confederate supply lines. Leaving on August 18, Kilpatrick hit the Atlanta &amp; West Point Railroad that evening, tearing up a small area of tracks. Next, he headed for Lovejoy&#x27;s Station on the Macon &amp; Western Railroad. In transit, on August 19, Kilpatrick&#x27;s men hit the Jonesborough supply depot on the Macon &amp; Western Railroad, burning great amounts of supplies. On August 20, they reached Lovejoy&#x27;s Station and began their destruction. Confederate infantry (Patrick Cleburne&#x27;s Division) appeared and the raiders were forced to fight into the night, finally fleeing to prevent encirclement. Although Kilpatrick had destroyed supplies and track at Lovejoy&#x27;s Station, the railroad line was back in operation in two days.

====Jonesborough (August 31 – September 1)====

In late August, Sherman determined that if he could cut Hood&#x27;s railroad supply lines, the Confederates would have to evacuate Atlanta. Sherman had successfully cut Hood&#x27;s supply lines in the past by sending out detachments of cavalry, but the Confederates quickly repaired the damage. He therefore decided to move six of his seven infantry corps against the supply lines. The army began pulling out of its positions on August 25 to hit the Macon &amp; Western Railroad between Rough and Ready and Jonesborough. To counter the move, Hood sent Hardee with two corps to halt and possibly rout the Union troops, not realizing Sherman&#x27;s army was there in force. On August 31, Hardee attacked two Union corps west of Jonesborough but was easily repulsed. Fearing an attack on Atlanta, Hood withdrew one corps from Hardee&#x27;s force that night. The next day, a Union corps broke through Hardee&#x27;s line, and his troops retreated to Lovejoy&#x27;s Station. Sherman had cut Hood&#x27;s supply line but he had failed to destroy Hardee&#x27;s command.

==== Fall of Atlanta (September 2) ====
On the night of September 1, Hood evacuated Atlanta and ordered that the 81 rail cars filled with ammunition and other military supplies be destroyed. The resulting fire and explosions were heard for miles. Union troops under the command of Gen. Henry W. Slocum occupied Atlanta on September 2.

On September 4, General Sherman issued Special Field Order #64. General Sherman announced to his troops that &quot;The army having accomplished its undertaking in the complete reduction and occupation of Atlanta will occupy the place and the country near it until a new campaign is planned in concert with the other grand armies of the United States.&quot;

==Aftermath==

Sherman was victorious, and Hood established a reputation as the most recklessly aggressive general in the Confederate Army. Casualties for the campaign were roughly equal in absolute numbers: 31,687 Union (4,423 killed, 22,822 wounded, 4,442 missing/captured) and 34,979 Confederate (3,044 killed, 18,952 wounded, 12,983 missing/captured). But this represented a much higher Confederate proportional loss. Hood&#x27;s army left the area with approximately 30,000 men, whereas Sherman retained 81,000. Sherman&#x27;s victory was qualified because it did not fulfill the original mission of the campaign—destroy the Army of Tennessee—and Sherman has been criticized for allowing his opponent to escape. However, the capture of Atlanta made an enormous contribution to Union morale and was an important factor in the re-election of President Abraham Lincoln.

Sherman realized that garrisoning Atlanta long-term would be a waste of troops, and that eventually the city would need to be abandoned. But first the army needed to be replenished, and so Sherman occupied Atlanta for the time being. Though the city was already mostly empty, about 1,600 civilians remained (compared to about 10,000 before the war) and Sherman felt their presence would be an obstacle. So, on September 14 Sherman issued Special Field Orders No. 67, which demanded the evacuation of the civilian population.

Hood, though he had been unable to hold Atlanta, now planned a counter-action. But the details were divulged in a speech given by Confederate President Davis, which provided Sherman a clear view of Hood&#x27;s strategy. Sherman left Atlanta garrisoned with only a single Corps, and took the rest of the army to chase down Hood in the Franklin–Nashville campaign. Despite the divulging of Hood&#x27;s plans, Hood was able to seize the initiative, briefly drawing Sherman north from Atlanta. The chase lasted through November, before Sherman returned the army to Atlanta to prepare for the March to the Sea. Despite Hood and Sherman&#x27;s armies being the main forces in the western theater, they would not meet again, and Hood&#x27;s army would be effectively destroyed by George Henry Thomas instead. Sherman&#x27;s Army returned to Atlanta on November 12, spending just a few days to destroy anything of military value, including the railroads. Sherman&#x27;s move was to be an evolution in warfare: without railroads for supply, the Army would have to live off the land. The Army withdrew from Atlanta on November 15, and so began Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea.

<doc id="651665" wikidata="Q16543083" url="?curid=651665" title="Spotlighting">
<text>Spotlighting or lamping (also known as jacklighting, shining, illuminating, pit-lamping, and the killing lamp) is a method of hunting nocturnal animals using off-road vehicles and high-powered lights, spotlights, lamps or flashlights, that makes special use of the eyeshine revealed by many animal species. A further important aspect is that many animals (e.g., foxes and rabbits) often remain to continually stare at the light, and do not appear to see the light as a threat, as they would a human. It is possible to carefully approach animals on foot to a short distance if bright light is continuously maintained on the animal, greatly improving chances of successful killing. Spotlighting may also be used as a method of surveying nocturnal fauna. Repeated, frequent spotlighting may have a detrimental effect on animals, and is discouraged.

==Technique==
The spotting and shooting often take place from the moving vehicle. Experienced drivers on familiar territory (such as farmers in their own paddocks) may turn off the vehicle headlights to minimize the distractions.

The most common vehicles used are light four-wheel drive trucks and utilities. A team may consist of three persons: the driver, the shooter, and the spotter. The shooter and spotter stand side by side behind the cab, holding onto a bar at the front of the tray or on top of the cab, which allows them a good 360 degree view. The spotter sweeps the surrounding countryside with a powerful hand-held lamp with a tightly focused beam.

Spotlighting can be conducted by two persons where the driver operates the spotlight or alone where the driver spotlights using a remote mounted spotlight or automotive lighting and shoots from the driver&#x27;s seat of the vehicle.

Lightweight lamps, torches and hand-held spotlights enable hunters to spotlight by foot. With a slow walking pace, the hunter will move forward while scanning for eyeshine. If spotted out of range, the light is typically turned off and the approach is made in the dark. Once a target is found, the hunter will typically hold the mesmerised animal in the glare of the lamp and shoot for the area between its glowing eyes.

==Legality==
===Australia===
Various rules govern nocturnal hunting and hunting from motor vehicles, but typically the use of illumination devices is prohibited for deer hunting. Commercial hunters are normally exempt from such regulations where the emphasis is upon population control.

=== New Zealand ===
Spotlighting on New Zealand Department of Conservation land is prohibited by law.

===North America===
Spotlighting is illegal in many locations throughout the United States and Canada. 

In Colorado, hunting any wildlife on public land with artificial light is unlawful.

In Manitoba and British Columbia, spotlighting is illegal except for status Indians. In Saskatchewan, spotlighting is illegal without exception.

=== Great Britain and Ireland: &quot;lamping&quot; ===
Lamping is a similar practice in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland of hunting at night using powerful lamps and either guns, birds of prey or dogs. It does not always involve vehicles. Animals associated with this form of hunting include foxes, rabbits, and hares. 

In England, Scotland, and Wales, most forms of hunting with dogs have been made illegal by the Hunting Act 2004 but rabbits and rats were specifically included on a list of exemptions, therefore lamping these animals with dogs is still legal. Hunting fox, rabbit and hare with dogs is legal in Northern Ireland. In Britain lamping foxes with dogs has been rendered illegal, however lamping in order to shoot them remains legal.

In Northern Ireland, lamping is also practiced against foxes and rabbits.

In the Republic of Ireland, it is legal to hunt foxes and rabbits with lamps, with a license and landowner&#x27;s permission, but it is illegal to use a &quot;mechanically propelled vehicle&quot; or to hunt hares or deer with lights. It is illegal to lamp from a vehicle on or near a public road. An attempt to forbid hunting with guns between midnight and 6 a.m. failed in 2017.

Once an animal has been located in the beam of light, it is either shot or the dog(s) released. The dogs used are typically lurchers (cross between a sighthound and any other breed of dog), or longdogs (cross between two sighthounds, typically a greyhound and a whippet), but may be a cross of many breeds.

Although white light is often used for lamping, using a red or orange filter is preferred, as this has a lesser effect on the night vision of the hunter (human or dog), and is less likely to frighten any potential prey.

<doc id="651666" wikidata="Q207383" url="?curid=651666" title="South Orkney Islands">
<text>The South Orkney Islands are a group of islands in the Southern Ocean, about north-east of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and south-west of South Georgia Island. They have a total area of about . The islands are claimed both by Britain (as part of the British Antarctic Territory since 1962, previously as a Falkland Islands Dependency) and by Argentina (as part of Argentine Antarctica). Under the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, sovereignty claims are held in abeyance.
Britain and Argentina both maintain bases on the islands. The Argentine base, Orcadas, established in 1904, is sited on Laurie Island. The 11 buildings of the Argentine station house up to 45 people during the summer, and an average of 14 during winter. The British Antarctic Survey base, Signy Research Station, is located on Signy Island and was established in 1947. Initially operated year-round, since 1995/6 the Signy Research Station has been open only from November to April each year.

Apart from personnel at the bases, there are no permanent human inhabitants on the islands.

==History==

The South Orkney Islands were discovered in 1821 by two sealers, the American Nathaniel Brown Palmer and the Briton George Powell. The islands were originally named &quot;Powell&#x27;s Group&quot;, with the main island named Coronation Island as it was the year of the coronation of King George IV. In 1823, James Weddell visited the islands, gave the archipelago its present name (after the Orkney Islands in the north of Scotland) and also renamed some of the islands. The South Orkney Islands are located at roughly the same latitude south as the Orkney Islands are north (60°S vs 59°N), although it is not known if this was a factor behind the naming of the islands. (Incidentally, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819 by William Smith, are roughly the same latitude south as the Shetland Islands are north: 62°S vs 60°N.)

Subsequently, the South Orkney Islands were frequently visited by sealers and whalers, but no thorough survey was done until the expedition of William Speirs Bruce on the &quot;Scotia&quot; in 1903, which overwintered at Laurie Island. Bruce surveyed the islands, reverted some of Weddell&#x27;s name changes, and established a meteorological station, which was sold to the Argentine Government upon his departure in 1904. This base, renamed &quot;Orcadas&quot; in 1951, is still in operation and is thus the oldest research station continuously staffed in the Antarctic.

In 1908, the United Kingdom declared sovereignty over various Antarctic and South American territories &quot;to the south of the 50th parallel of south latitude, and lying between the 20th and the 80th degrees of west longitude&quot;, including the South Orkney Islands. The Islands were subsequently administered as part of the Falkland Islands Dependencies. A biological research station on Signy Island was built in 1947 by the British Antarctic Survey, and was staffed year-round until 1996, when the Station staffing was reduced to 8–10 personnel who remained only during the southern hemisphere summer (November to April each year). In 1962, the islands became part of the newly established British Antarctic Territory.

The Argentine claim to the islands dates from 1925. It was originally justified by the Argentine occupation of the Laurie Island base and later subsumed into a wider territorial claim.

==Geography and climate==

The islands are situated at latitudes about 60°30&#x27; to 60°48&#x27; S and longitudes 44°25&#x27; to 46°43&#x27; W in the Southern Ocean. As a group of islands, the South Orkney Islands are at approximately .

The archipelago comprises four main islands. Coronation Island is the largest, measuring about long; its highest point is Mount Nivea which rises to above sea level. Laurie Island is the easternmost of the islands. The other main islands are Powell and Signy. Smaller islands in the group include Robertson Islands, the Saddle Islands, and Acuña Island. The total area of the archipelago is about , of which about 90 percent is glaciated.

The Inaccessible Islands about to the west are considered part of the South Orkneys.

The climate of the South Orkneys is generally cold, wet, and windy. Summers are short and cold (December to March) when the average temperatures reach about and fall to about in July. The all time temperature range at Orcadas Base is between . The highest temperature recorded at Signy Research Station was on 30 January 1982, which is the highest temperature recorded anywhere south of 60°S. The seas around the islands are ice-covered from late April to November.

South Orkney Trough () is an undersea trough named in association with the South Orkney Islands and approved 10/77 (ACUF 177).

===Climate data===


==Flora and fauna==
Despite the harsh conditions, the islands do support vegetation and constitute the South Orkney Islands tundra ecoregion. All islands lie in the cold seas below the Antarctic Convergence. These areas support tundra vegetation consisting of mosses, lichens and algae, while seabirds, penguins and seals feed in the surrounding waters.

The littoral zone of the South Orkneys is biologically either lifeless or very poor. Amphipods and planarians exist under rocks, along with various algaes, chitons, and some gastropods. With increasing water depth, life becomes more varied: starfish appear beyond 2–3 metres along with sponges, urchins, and ascidians. At 8–10 metres, the variety of starfish increases along with the general biomass, and below 30 metres there are vast colonies of these creatures. Two penguin species, Chinstrap (&quot;Pygoscelis antarctica&quot;) and Adélie (&quot;Pygoscelis adeliae&quot;), are present on land.

On Signy Island a parthenogenetic flightless midge originally from South Georgia, &quot;Eretmoptera murphyi&quot;, was accidentally introduced during a botany experiment in the 1960s. It has since colonized much of the island and is altering the entire soil ecosystem. Some places they can reach 20,000 individuals per m2. Because it can survive in water, there are concerns that it could reach other islands.

==Research stations==

The two claimant nations maintain research stations on the islands.
* Orcadas Base, Laurie Island (since 1904 – bought as a meteorological station from British scientist William Speirs Bruce in 1904)
* Signy Research Station, Signy Island (since 1947)

<doc id="651672" wikidata="Q4719000" url="?curid=651672" title="Alexander Grant (Upper Canada politician)">
<text>Commodore Alexander Grant (20 May 1734 – 8 May 1813) was a Scottish Royal Navy officer, businessman, and politician in British Canada. Grant was born Glenmoriston, Scotland to Isobel and Patrick Grant, 8th Laird of Glenmoriston. During his service with the Royal Navy Grant saw action in the Seven Years&#x27; War before becoming a naval superintendent. He then embarked on a career in the ship building industry before losing much of his wealth during the American Revolution. Grant recovered, however, and rose to prominence in civil society, becoming the Administrator of the Government of the Province of Upper Canada in 1805.

== Naval career ==

Grant entered the Royal Navy in 1755 and saw service in British North America, on Lake Champlain, during the Seven Years&#x27; War. Grant became a naval superintendent with the Provincial Marine in 1763, with his headquarters on Navy Island on in the Niagara River, before moving to Detroit, Quebec. His headquarters again changed, every winter, during which time the regiment was in New York City, up to 1774.

== Merchant career ==

He began to build his own vessels, essentially selling them to himself at a considerable profit. He built a commercial empire by also selling or renting ships to merchants and this was initially solidified during the American Revolution during which he was given military command of most of the Great Lakes.

However, in the course of the revolution Grant lost much of his income with the loss of 12,000 acres (49 km²) of land he owned in New York, and the end of his participation in private shipping.

== Civil career ==

Grant recovered, however, and rose to prominence in civil society, being appointed a justice of the peace in 1786 and, to a succession of governmental and political positions, in both Upper Canada and Lower Canada, he joined the Executive Council of Upper Canada under Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe as well as the Legislative Council. In 1799, Grant became a deputy superintendent of the British Indian Department.

In August 1805, Grant became Administrator of Upper Canada, upon the death of Lieutenant-Governor Peter Hunter, and continued Hunter&#x27;s policies until a new lieutenant governor, Francis Gore, arrived from Britain, in August 1806.

Grant died in 1813 at his home Castle Grant in Grosse Pointe Farms near British-occupied Detroit and was buried on the other side of the Detroit River at St. John&#x27;s Church in Sandwich, Upper Canada.

<text>The Midland Railway Carriage and Wagon Company was a Birmingham, England, based manufacturer of railway carriages and wagons. It was not part of the Midland Railway.

Its products also included trams and even military tanks.

It has made trains for railways in the UK and overseas, including the London Underground.

After a series of takeovers, its works at Washwood Heath in Birmingham became part of Metro Cammell and are now part of the Alstom group.

==History==

In 1845, Joseph Wright, a London coach builder, leased land in Saltley, Birmingham with the intention of building a factory for the production of railway rolling stock. Wright, realising that the future lay in the development of the railways devoted his energies, together with those of his sons to building rolling stock and by the 1850s his Saltley site had massively expanded and he was employing a work force of about 800 people. In addition to building stock for practically all the British railways, the firm completed contracts for many countries world-wide. They also had premises in Shrewsbury.

In 1902 rationalisation of the rolling stock industry began when the Metropolitan Amalgamated Railway Carriage and Wagon Co. Ltd. was formed, incorporating Joseph Wright&#x27;s old firm with other well known companies such as Ashbury, Brown and Marshalls, Oldbury and Lancaster railway carriage companies. In 1929 Vickers, after acquiring the shares of the Metropolitan Company, came together with Cammell Laird and each merged their rolling stock interests to form the great undertaking of Metropolitan-Cammell Ltd.

<text>Metro-Cammell, formally the Metropolitan Cammell Carriage and Wagon Company (MCCW), was an English manufacturer of railway carriages, locomotives and railway wagons, based in Saltley, and subsequently Washwood Heath, in Birmingham. The company was purchased by GEC Alsthom in May 1989; the Washwood Heath factory closed in 2005 and was demolished in early 2019.

The company designed and built trains for the railways in the United Kingdom and overseas, including the Mass Transit Railway of Hong Kong, Kowloon–Canton Railway (now East Rail line), the Channel Tunnel, and the Tyne and Wear Metro, and locomotives for Malaysia&#x27;s Keretapi Tanah Melayu. Diesel and electric locomotives were manufactured for South African Railways, Nyasaland Railways, Malawi, Nigeria, Trans-Zambezi Railway and Pakistan. DMUs were supplied to Jamaica Railway Corporation and the National Railways of Mexico. The vast majority of London Underground rolling stock manufactured in the mid-20th century was produced by the company, which also designed and built the Blue Pullman for British Railways.

==History==
===Metropolitan Railway Carriage and Wagon Company ===

The company was formed in 1863 as the Metropolitan Railway Carriage and Wagon Company , successors to Messrs. Joseph Wright and Sons. Joseph Wright built coaches for the London and Southampton Railway in 1837 and the London and Birmingham Railway in 1838. In 1845, he moved the carriage works from London to Birmingham, where he purchased of meadowland in Saltley, adjacent to the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway line. In 1854, the company built the first 12 carriages for the Sydney to Parramatta line, New South Wales, the first public railway in Australia, which opened in 1855. Several of those are now in the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney.

===Metropolitan Amalgamated Railway Carriage and Wagon Company ===
In 1902, it merged with four other carriage and wagon builders: Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company Ltd., Brown, Marshalls and Company Ltd., Lancaster Railway Carriage and Wagon Company Ltd., and Oldbury Railway Carriage and Wagon Company Ltd., and became the Metropolitan Amalgamated Railway Carriage and Wagon Company . 

Metropolitan was contracted as a builder of the new tanks for the British Army during the First World War. It built all 400 of the Mark V tank and 700 improved Mark V* tanks. These were the most developed heavy tank designs to see service in the war.

In 1917, Metropolitan Railway Carriage and Wagon Company and Vickers Limited took joint control of British Westinghouse. In 1919, Vickers bought out the Metropolitan shares and renamed the company Metropolitan-Vickers. By 1926, the company had changed its name again to Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company. In 1929, the railway rolling stock business of Cammell Laird and Company was merged as Metropolitan-Cammell Carriage and Wagon Company , the resulting company being part owned by Vickers and the Cammell Laird group. 

MCCW also built bus bodies. In 1932, Metro Cammell Weymann was formed by the MCCW&#x27;s bus bodybuilding business and Weymann Motor Bodies. In the Second World War, Metro again built tanks, including the Valentine tank and Light Tank Mk VIII. The Saltley works was closed in 1962 and group administration concentrated at Washwood Heath in 1967.

==Closure by Alstom==

In May 1989, the railway business was sold to GEC Alsthom (now Alstom). The last trains to be built at the Washwood Heath plant before its closure in 2005 were the Class 390 &quot;Pendolino&quot; tilting trains for the West Coast Main Line modernisation.

<text>Lieutenant-General Peter Hunter (11 July 1746 – 21 August 1805) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator. He was the eldest son of John Hunter, Laird of Knapp and his spouse, Euphemia Jack of Longforgan, Perthshire, Scotland.

In 1767, he entered the British Army by purchasing an ensign&#x27;s commission in the 1st Foot. He rose to lieutenant in 1770 and served in Menorca from 1771 to 1775, being promoted to captain on the regiment&#x27;s return to England. He became a major in the 92nd Foot in 1779 and went to the West Indies, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, transferring to the 60th Foot in 1781. His unit was posted to Nova Scotia in 1786 and he assumed command of the battalion in 1787.

In 1789, Hunter, after leave in England, was appointed acting Superintendent of British Honduras in 1790, following the suspension of incumbent Edward Despard. He held that position until 1791 and was said to have administered the new colony in an authoritarian manner. He returned to England in 1793 and was given the rank of colonel serving in Europe and then the Caribbean before becoming a military governor in County Wexford, Ireland following the Irish Rebellion of 1798.

On 10 April 1799, Hunter was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, succeeding John Graves Simcoe. He was also made commander of military forces in both Upper Canada and Lower Canada with the rank of lieutenant-general in 1802. He became colonel of the 9th Foot in 1804.

Hunter died unexpectedly in 1805 in Quebec and was buried at Cimetière Anglican Saint-Matthew. Alexander Grant became administrator of Upper Canada and continued Hunter&#x27;s policies until a new lieutenant governor, Francis Gore, arrived from Britain in August 1806.

Hunterstown, a geographic township and village in the Municipality of Saint-Paulin, Quebec, was named after him.

<doc id="651707" wikidata="Q7416872" url="?curid=651707" title="Sandro Nielsen">
<text>Sandro Nielsen (born 1961) is a Danish metalexicographer, Associate Professor at Centre for Lexicography at the Aarhus School of Business, Denmark, from where he received his PhD in 1992. Nielsen has contributed to lexicography as a theoretical and practical lexicographer with particular reference to bilingual and multilingual specialised dictionaries (technical dictionaries). He is the author and co-author of more than one hundred publications on lexicography, theoretical papers, printed and electronic (online) dictionaries.

==Influence and work==
Sandro Nielsen is an authority on legal lexicography and bilingual law dictionaries and has proposed a fundamentally sound general theory of bilingual legal lexicography, which is described in his book &quot;The Bilingual LSP Dictionary – Principles and Practice for Legal Language&quot; published in 1994.

His research and publications identifies him as a modern lexicographer with the introduction of lexicographic concepts such as lexicographic information costs (Nielsen 2008), the distinction between a maximizing dictionary and a minimizing dictionary, the typology of multi-field, single-field and sub-field dictionaries, and the concept of function-related cross-references. He is one of the lexicographers that have combined lexicographic theory and translation strategies in an attempt to suggest improvements to bilingual translation dictionaries by showing how bilingual LSP dictionaries mix up source-language and target-language translation strategies (Nielsen 2000).

In his paper &quot;Changes in dictionary subject matter&quot; from 2003, Sandro Nielsen suggested a lexicographic approach to defining a dictionary in contrast to the traditional linguistic approach. He defines a dictionary in terms of its major features, and a dictionary has three such features: A dictionary is a lexicographic reference work that has been designed to fulfill one or more functions (its pure potential), contains lexicographic data supporting the function(s), and contains lexicographic structures that combine and link the data in order to fulfill the function(s). This definition applies to printed, electronic and Internet dictionaries, and it applies to existing, planned and imaginary dictionaries alike.

Sandro Nielsen has also proposed a practical and theoretical framework for reviewing dictionaries (Nielsen 2009). In this paper, he describes the requirements for scholarly or academic reviews and suggests that the dictionary should be regarded as a true object of analysis and examination. The framework introduces three approaches to dictionary reviewing: the linguistic approach, the factual approach, and the lexicographic approach. These approaches may be combined so as to achieve really academic reviews. Finally, the framework also gives some guidelines as to the requirements regarding the informative value of dictionary reviews: they must be reliable, deal with relevant and material aspects, and be unbiased.

In addition to his theoretical publications, Sandro Nielsen has published three printed dictionaries, an English-Danish law dictionary (&quot;Engelsk-Dansk Juridisk Basisordbog&quot;) a Danish-English accounting dictionary (&quot;Regnskabsordbogen. Dansk-Engelsk&quot;), and an English-Danish accounting dictionary (&quot;Regnskabsordbogen. Engelsk-Dansk&quot;) and five Internet dictionaries, a Danish-English law dictionary (&quot;Dansk-Engelsk CISG-ordbog&quot;), a Danish accounting dictionary (&quot;Den Danske Regnskabsordbog&quot;), a Danish-English accounting dictionary (&quot;Den Dansk-Engelske Regnskabsordbog&quot;), an English accounting dictionary and an English-Danish accounting dictionary. He is the author of &quot;The Bilingual LSP Dictionary – Principles and Practice for Legal Language&quot; and is a contributor to the &quot;Manual of Specialised Lexicography&quot;.

<text>&#x27; (), previously known as &#x27; (2014–2024), &#x27; (1964–2014), &#x27; (1954–1964), &#x27; (1953–1954), and &#x27; (1950–1953), is a weekly French news magazine. Based in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris, &quot;&quot; is one of the three most prominent French news magazines alongside &quot;Le Point&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;. Its current editor is Cécile Prieur.

==History and profile==
The magazine was established in 1950 as &#x27;. It became &#x27; in 1953 and &#x27; in 1954. The name &#x27; was adopted in 1964. The 1964 incarnation of the magazine was founded by Jean Daniel and Claude Perdriel.
Since 1964, &#x27; has been published by Groupe Nouvel Observateur on a weekly basis and has covered political, business and economic news. It features extensive coverage of European, Middle Eastern and African political, commercial and cultural issues. Its strongest areas are political and literary matters, and it is noted for its in-depth treatment of the day&#x27;s main issues. It has been described as &quot;the French intellectuals&#x27; parish magazine&quot;, or more pejoratively as &quot;the quasi-official organ of France&#x27;s &quot;gauche caviar&quot; [caviar left]&quot;. It is often referred to as &#x27; for short.

Franz-Olivier Giesbert joined the &quot;&quot; in 1971 as a journalist in the political department and then became a reporter. In 1985, Giesbert became the editorial director.

Patrick Fiole and Christina Sourieau launched the magazine&#x27;s internet site in 1999.

The magazine&#x27;s new charter, adopted in June 2004 (on the 40th anniversary of its foundation), outlines the paper&#x27;s principles: &quot;The &quot;&quot; is a cultural and political weekly whose orientation belongs within the general social-democratic movement. A tradition ever concerned with combining respect for freedom and the quest for social justice.&quot;

Alongside its editorial activities, the Nouvel Observateur group bought the online news site &quot;Rue89&quot; in December 2011, becoming its only shareholder.

In January 2014, the owners of &#x27;, Pierre Bergé, Xavier Niel, and Matthieu Pigasse, purchased a 65% stake in the magazine. On 12 March 2014 the two co-directors of the press group, Laurent Joffrin and Nathalie Collin, resigned because the &#x27; was being sold to &quot;Le Monde&quot;.

On 23 October 2014, the magazine was renamed &quot;L’Obs&quot; and its layout was changed to include in-depth reports on investigations, stories and discussions of ideas.

Its current editorial board is headed by two of its co-founders, Jean Daniel and Claude Perdriel, two editors-in-chief, Laurent Joffrin and , and the director general, Jacqueline Galvez. André Gorz and other journalists who had left &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; helped to found the publication.

The holding company Le Monde Libre, the majority shareholder of Groupe Le Monde, owns 99% of the weekly &quot;Le Nouvel Obs&quot;.

On 21 March 2024, the magazine changed its name from to .

<doc id="651711" wikidata="Q7176713" url="?curid=651711" title="Peter Russell (politician)">
<text>Peter Russell (11 June 1733 – 30 September 1808) was an Anglo-Irish military officer in the American War of Independence and a government official, politician and judge in Upper Canada.

==Early life==
Born in Cork, Kingdom of Ireland to Captain Richard Russell, later living in England, Russell attended the University of Cambridge briefly. His debts forced him to enter the British Army during the Seven Years&#x27; War. He was commissioned into the 14th Foot and served in the 94th Foot and the 64th Foot.

After fleeing due to gambling debts, Russell returned to the American colonies during the Revolutionary War, seeking promotion in the military, served as assistant secretary to Sir Henry Clinton and being promoted Captain in 1781. He was appointed superintendent of the port of Charleston in 1782 before returning to England.

==Politics==
After several years of job-searching Russell was appointed by the British government as Receiver General for the new colonial province of Upper Canada. In 1791 he joined the administration of John Graves Simcoe, the province&#x27;s first Lieutenant-Governor. Russell was also appointed to the Executive Council and Legislative Council, and served as Speaker of the Legislative Council. In July 1794, after the departure of Chief Justice William Osgoode, Simcoe issued a temporary commission to Russell to fill a vacant seat of Puisne Judge of the King’s Bench. 

Simcoe requested a leave of absence in December 1795 and recommended that Russell act as Administrator of Upper Canada in his absence. Russell assumed the position in July 1796 on Simcoe&#x27;s departure and remained administrator until 1799 when Simcoe&#x27;s permanent replacement was appointed, Peter Hunter.

Russell&#x27;s administration saw the peaceful transfer of six border posts from the British to the Americans under the terms of the Jay Treaty. During his temporary appointment, Russell was at a disadvantage, however, as Simcoe had taken the vast majority of his official papers with him, leaving only 12 documents behind. This left Russell ignorant of British policy and of Simcoe&#x27;s proposals for management of the province.

Russell attempted to tighten up the system of land grants in order to curtail speculation, nepotism and corruption. He clashed with the new chief justice, John Elmsley, (who served on the Executive Council as part of his duties) over issues such as the seat of government with Elmsley objecting to the implementation of Simcoe&#x27;s directions on making York the capital.
Elmsley also objected to Russell&#x27;s self-appointment to the Court of King&#x27;s Bench due to Russell&#x27;s lack of legal training and the violation of the separation of judicial and executive powers. Russell needed the extra income, however, and ignored Elmsley&#x27;s objections.

Peter Russell was a supporter of Native issues in the town of York, supporting them when they had issues with encroaching pioneers. However, he owned and traded in slaves.

==Russell Abbey==
Russell lived at a town home on King Street between Sherbourne and Princess (now 255 King Street East), built of timber from German Mills, Ontario. Russell lived with his sister Elizabeth and it was referred to as &quot;Russell Abbey&quot;. The home was a park lot granted to Russell in 1798. Russell died in 1808 and his sister until 1822, the home burned down in 1856.

==Later years and legacy==

By 1798 it became evident that Simcoe would never return. Russell hoped to become the new lieutenant-governor and was disappointed when Peter Hunter was given the position in 1799.

Russell remained on the Executive Council but his influence waned and he had little power. When Hunter died in 1805, Russell again hoped to be named administrator but was passed over in favour of Alexander Grant. Tired of Canada, he wished to return to England but, unable to find a buyer for his 6,000 acres (24 km2) of land, he could not afford the trip and remained in the province until his death in 1808. Russell was buried at the old Garrison Burial Grounds, now Victoria Memorial Square, near Fort York.

The town of Russell, Ontario takes its name after Russell. In 2020, following the George Floyd protests, the township announced it will search for a new Russell as its namesake due to Peter Russell&#x27;s ownership of black slaves.

<text>Alfred Bird (1811 – 15 December 1878) was an English food manufacturer and chemist. He was born in Nympsfield, Gloucestershire, England in 1811 and was later a pupil at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham. He was the inventor of a series of food products, most notably egg-free custard and baking powder. His father was a lecturer in astronomy at Eton College. His son Alfred Frederick Bird continued to develop the business after his father&#x27;s death.

==Career ==
Alfred Bird registered as a pharmacist in Birmingham in 1842, having served an apprenticeship to Phillip Harris of that city. He was a qualified chemist and druggist and went on to open an experimental chemist&#x27;s shop in Bull Street.

Alfred Bird&#x27;s first major invention was egg-free custard in 1837. Alfred Bird used cornflour instead of egg to create an imitation of egg custard. It was originally intended only for his wife Elizabeth who had both egg and yeast allergies. The Birds used genuine custard when entertaining guests, but on one occasion the egg-free custard was (either by accident or design) fed to dinner guests. It was well received, and Alfred Bird realised that his invention had a wider use. Soon afterwards Alfred Bird founded &#x27;Alfred Bird and Sons Ltd&#x27;, which would go on to become the famous Bird&#x27;s Custard company and brand.

Bird was not content to revolutionise custard but went on to invent a baking powder in 1843 so he could make yeast-free bread for his wife. This formula for baking powder is essentially the same as used in modern baking powders.

==Death ==

Alfred Bird died on 15 December 1878 in Kings Norton, Birmingham and is buried at Key Hill Cemetery in Birmingham. Famously his obituary in the journal of the Chemical Society (of which he was a fellow) discussed at length his skills and research but did not mention his other activity – the by then famous Bird&#x27;s Custard and Bird&#x27;s Jelly. It read:

==Personal life ==
His son, Alfred Frederick Bird, continued the work of his father. Bird junior went on to invent egg substitute powder in 1890, blancmange powder and jelly powder.

The Custard Factory in Digbeth, Birmingham, is now a centre providing space to artists.

<doc id="651726" wikidata="Q957052" url="?curid=651726" title="Sahel, Tunisia">
<text>The Tunisian Sahel () or more precisely the Central East Tunisia is an area of central eastern Tunisia and one of the six Tunisian regions. It stretches along the eastern shore, from Hammamet in the north to Mahdia in the south, including the governorates of Monastir, Mahdia, Sfax and Sousse. Its name derives from the Arabic word &quot;sāḥil&quot; (ساحل), meaning &quot;shore&quot; or &quot;coast&quot;.
The region&#x27;s economy is based especially on tourism and it contains the second-biggest airport in Tunisia: Monastir Habib Bourguiba International Airport.

== Geography ==
The Sahel extends inland to the hills which protect the low plains of the coast and are covered in olive plantations; the region&#x27;s low rainfall is compensated for by the atmospheric humidity.

Since antiquity, it has formed a clear geographic unity with its own unique demographic and economic characteristics. Today it consists of the governorates of Sousse, Monastir and Mahdia.

Its geographic area is quite large: about 140 km from north to south and varying between twenty and sixty kilometres east to west. The total area is around , 4.02% of the total surface area of Tunisia.
== History ==
Long inhabited, the area of the modern Tunisian Sahel seems to have been a distinct region dominated by urban settlements on the sea since antiquity; this tradition predates the region&#x27;s conversion to Islam and Arabisation, but its continuity with region&#x27;s Arab history is clear.

=== Phoenician settlement ===
Most of the cities of the Sahel were founded by the Phoenicians. Thus Hadrumetum was founded at the beginning of the 9th century BC by Tyre - even before Carthage. It gained importance in the following centuries, becoming one of the main Phoenician ports in the Western Mediterranean. The area was a key part of the Carthaginian empire, but after the Second Punic War it came under increasing Numidian influence. In 146 BC, after the Third Punic War, it became part of the new Roman province of Africa.

=== Rome and Byzantium ===
The Sahel was the location of one of the key battles of the War between Pompey and Caesar. Julius Caesar landed at Ruspina on 28 December 47 BC, marched to Thapsus and put it under siege at the end of February 46 BC. The Battle of Thapsus took place on 6 April and was a massive victory for Caesar and the city surrendered to him shortly after. Then he proceeded to take control of northern Tunisia.

Around 293 AD the Romans divided the province of Africa and the Sahel became its own province, named Byzacena, which was among the provinces ceded to the Vandals in 442. It was recaptured by the Eastern Roman Empire in the Vandalic War and then formed one of the seven provinces of the Exarchate of Africa, which stretched west to the Atlantic.

=== Caliphates ===

With the arrival of Islam and the establishment of the capital of Ifriqiya, Kairouan, in the region, the Sahel&#x27;s maritime ports became the key to its security. This explains the construction of several ribats in the region, which served defensive, religious and Maraboutic purposes. The most important ribats are those of Monastir, built by governor Harthama ibn A&#x27;yun in 796, and of Sousse, built by the Aghlabid emirs.

=== African Emirates ===
The city of Sousse received a shipyard which played an important role in the conquest of Sicily, which was launched from it.

The foundation of Mahdia by the Fatamids in 916 gave the Sahel a key political role which continued under the Zirids. Kairouan lost some of its religious role to Monastir, where figures including the Zirid princes and Imam Mezri were buried. Mahdia became the seat of a splendid court which drew poets from across the Maghreb, Al-Andalus and Sicily. However, the invasion of Banu Hilal plunged the region into chaos and Tunisia fractured into numerous taifas; only the Sahel remained under Zirid control. Even Sousse broke away from their power, adopting a republican government. The invasion led to the further urbanisation of the region, with the establishment of many villages which still exist today. A little later the region suffered from Norman attacks – Mahdia was taken in 1148 by troops of Roger II of Sicily – until the arrival of the Almohads in 1160. After this period the Sahel experienced a decline in importance following the transfer of the capital to Tunis.

=== Beylik of Tunis ===
In the 19th century, the Sahel was divided into two qaidates, one based at Sousse and the other at Monastir, which occupied approximately the same area as the modern Tunisian governorates of Monastir and Mahdia. They were alternatively called &quot;awtan&quot; (plural of &quot;watan&quot;, meaning &quot;district&quot;), individually &quot;watan Susah&quot; and &quot;watan al&#x27;Munastir&quot;. The two qaidates were awarded only to individuals close to the beys. Often both positions were controlled by a single individual, as was the case with the grand viziers Shakir al-Taba&#x27;a (1836) and Mohammed Khaznadar (1851), who was also named &quot;Mohammed governor of the Sahel&quot; (&quot;Mohammed &#x27;amil as-Sahil&quot;). The majority of the cities and villages of the Sahel revolted against the Bey in 1864. After this, the general Ahmed Zarrouk imposed a heavy tribute (financed by the sail of goods and property) and confiscated large areas of olive plantation.

=== French protectorate ===

After the establishment of a French protectorate, the new power established the qaidate of Jemmal (which took part of modern Monastir and Mahdia governorates) and centralised the region at Sousse which became the seat of civil government, contributing to the weakening of the other regional centres.

=== Modern Tunisia ===
After independence, the government of Neo Destour ended the Sahel&#x27;s administrative union during the abolition of the qaidates and establishment of the modern system of governorates. The whole region was under the control of the governor of Sousse from 1956 to 1974, when the governorates of Monastir and Mahdia were created.

== Demographics ==
The Sahel has long been characterised by a large population; its three governorates contain inhabitants of 1,634,611 million peoples The region is thus the Third most populous in Tunisia after North East Tunisia region and South East Tunisia.

== Economy ==

The Sahel occupies a central position on the Mediterranean Sea and is one of the country&#x27;s most important areas for bathing and tourism on account of the large number of beaches. The cities of Monastir and Sousse are key tourist centres and Mahdia has been attempting to develop its tourist industry since the 1990s. It is home to the Monastir Habib Bourguiba International Airport, which is the busiest airport in the country in terms of passenger numbers and has the most charter flights of any airport in Africa. There is a commercial port at Sousse, numerous fishing ports and two marinas (Port El Kantaoui and Cap Monastir).

The A1 crosses the region from north to south and there are two railways (national and regional).

== Transport ==
The public transport authority for bus travel within and between the cities of the Sahel is the Société de transport du Sahel (STS), which has its headquarters at Sousse and is divided into three regional branches corresponding to the three governorates. The Sahel Metro is the regional railway line, making several trips daily between Mahdia and Sousse.

The Sahel is an important part of the Tunisian autoroute network, with a major node of the A1 at M&#x27;saken, which continues north for 140 km to Tunis and south for 98 km to Sfax. A parallel route runs along the coast.

== Sport ==

The region&#x27;s name is used by the omnisports club of Sousse, the Étoile sportive du Sahel. The club is supported throughout the region and is one of the most popular sporting clubs in the country. The football club Étoile Sportive du Sahel has achieved several continental victories. The second famous and historical omnisports team in the region is US Monastir located in Monastir since 1923 under the name of Ruspina Sports that was changed in 1942 by Union Sportive Monastirienne. The club was known as the club of the first president of Tunisia native from Monastir Habib Bourguiba who was seen present in Mustapha Ben Jannet stadium for many times. The football club plays in the first division of Tunisian league and has no national and continental title, and the basketball team has won several Tunisian titles and one continental title.

The region is also known for handball, the second most popular sport in Tunisia. The region is home to several handball clubs, of which the most important are the Étoile Sportive du Sahel H.C., El Makarem de Mahdia and SC Moknine.

<text>Aortic regurgitation (AR), also known as aortic insufficiency (AI), is the leaking of the aortic valve of the heart that causes blood to flow in the reverse direction during ventricular diastole, from the aorta into the left ventricle. As a consequence, the cardiac muscle is forced to work harder than normal.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of aortic regurgitation are similar to those of heart failure and include the following:
* Dyspnea on exertion
* Orthopnea
* Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
* Palpitations
* Angina pectoris
* Cyanosis (in acute cases)

==Causes==
In terms of the cause of aortic regurgitation, is often due to the aortic root dilation (&quot;annuloaortic ectasia&quot;), which is idiopathic in over 80% of cases, but otherwise may result from aging, syphilitic aortitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, aortic dissection, Behçet&#x27;s disease, reactive arthritis and systemic hypertension. Aortic root dilation is the most common cause of aortic regurgitation in developed countries. Additionally, aortic regurgitation has been linked to the use of some medications, specifically medications containing fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine isomers and dopamine agonists. Other potential causes that affect the valve directly include Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In acute cases of aortic regurgitation, the main causes are infective endocarditis, aortic dissection or trauma.

==Pathophysiology==
The mechanism of aortic regurgitation, comprises the pressure in the left ventricle falling below the pressure in the aorta, the aortic valve is not able to completely close. This causes a leaking of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle. This means that some of the blood that was already ejected from the heart is &quot;regurgitating&quot; back into the heart. The percentage of blood that regurgitates back through the aortic valve due to AR is known as the regurgitant fraction. This regurgitant flow causes a decrease in the diastolic blood pressure in the aorta, and therefore an increase in the pulse pressure. Since some of the blood that is ejected during systole regurgitates back into the left ventricle during diastole, &quot;there is decreased effective forward flow in AR&quot;.

While diastolic blood pressure is diminished and the pulse pressure widens, systolic blood pressure generally remains normal or can even be slightly elevated, this is because sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis of the kidneys compensate for the decreased cardiac output. Catecholamines will increase the heart rate and increase the strength of ventricular contraction, directly increasing cardiac output. Catecholamines will also cause peripheral vasoconstriction, which causes increased systemic vascular resistance and ensures that organs are adequately perfused. Renin, a proteolytic enzyme, cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II. In the case of chronic aortic with resultant cardiac remodeling, heart failure will develop, and it is possible to see systolic pressures diminish. Aortic regurgitation causes both volume overload (elevated preload) and pressure overload (elevated afterload) of the heart.

The volume overload, due to elevated pulse pressure and the systemic effects of neuroendocrine hormones causes left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). There is both &quot;concentric hypertrophy&quot; and &quot;eccentric hypertrophy&quot; in AI. The concentric hypertrophy is due to the increased left ventricular pressure overload associated with AI, while the eccentric hypertrophy is due to volume overload caused by the regurgitant fraction.

Physiologically, in individuals with a normally functioning aortic valve, the valve is only open when the pressure in the left ventricle is higher than the pressure in the aorta. This allows the blood to be ejected from the left ventricle into the aorta during ventricular systole. The amount of blood that is ejected by the heart is known as the &quot;stroke volume&quot;. Under normal conditions, &gt;50% of the blood in a filled left ventricle is ejected into the aorta to be used by the body. After ventricular systole, the pressure in the left ventricle decreases as it relaxes and begins to fill up with blood from the left atrium. This relaxation of the left ventricle (early ventricular diastole) causes a fall in its pressure. When the pressure in the left ventricle falls below the pressure in the aorta, the aortic valve will close, preventing blood in the aorta from going back into the left ventricle.

==Diagnosis==

In terms of the diagnosis of aortic regurgitation a common test for the evaluation of the severity is transthoracic echocardiography, which can provide two-dimensional views of the regurgitant jet, allow measurement of velocity, and estimate jet volume. The findings in severe aortic regurgitation, based on the 2012 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines include:

Chest X-ray can assist in making the diagnosis, showing left ventricular hypertrophy and dilated aorta. ECG typically indicates left ventricular hypertrophy. Cardiac chamber catheterization assists in assessing the severity of regurgitation and any left ventricular dysfunction.

===Physical examination===

The physical examination of an individual with aortic regurgitation involves auscultation of the heart to listen for the murmur of aortic regurgitation and the S3 heart sound (S3 gallop correlates with development of LV dysfunction). The murmur of chronic aortic regurgitation is typically described as early diastolic and decrescendo, which is best heard in the third left intercostal space and may radiate along the left sternal border.

If there is increased stroke volume of the left ventricle due to volume overload, an ejection systolic &#x27;flow&#x27; murmur may also be present when auscultating the same aortic area. Unless there is concomitant aortic valve stenosis, the murmur should not start with an ejection click. There may also be an Austin Flint murmur, a soft mid-diastolic rumble heard at the apical area; it appears when a regurgitant jet of blood from severe aortic regurgitation partially closes the anterior mitral leaflet. Peripheral physical signs of aortic regurgitation are related to the high pulse pressure and the rapid decrease in blood pressure during diastole due to blood returning to the heart from the aorta through the incompetent aortic valve, although the usefulness of some of the eponymous signs has been questioned: Phonocardiograms detect AI by having electric voltage mimic the sounds the heart makes.

&quot;Characteristics&quot;- indicative of aortic regurgitation are as follow:
===Classification===
The hemodynamic sequelae of AI are dependent on the rate of onset of AI. Therefore, can be acute or chronic as follows:
* Acute aortic regurgitation In acute AR, as may be seen with acute perforation of the aortic valve due to endocarditis, there will be a sudden increase in the volume of blood in the left ventricle. The ventricle is unable to deal with the sudden change in volume. The filling pressure of the left ventricle will increase. This causes pressure in the left atrium to rise, and the individual will develop pulmonary edema. Severe acute aortic regurgitation is considered a medical emergency. There is a high mortality rate if the individual does not undergo immediate surgery for aortic valve replacement.

* Chronic aortic regurgitation If the individual survives the initial hemodynamic derailment that acute AR presents, the left ventricle adapts by its eccentric hypertrophy and dilatation with a subsequent compensated volume overload. The left ventricular filling pressures will revert to normal and the individual will no longer have overt heart failure. In this compensated phase, the individual may be totally asymptomatic and may have normal exercise tolerance. Eventually (typically after a latency period) the left ventricle will become decompensated, and filling pressures will increase. Some individuals enter this decompensated phase asymptomatically, treatment for AR involves aortic valve replacement prior to this decompensation phase.

==Treatment==

Aortic regurgitation can be treated either medically or surgically, depending on the acuteness of presentation, the symptoms and signs associated with the disease process, and the degree of left ventricular dysfunction. Surgical treatment in asymptomatic patients has been recommended if the ejection fraction falls to 50% or below, in the face of progressive and severe left ventricular dilatation, or with symptoms or abnormal response to exercise testing. For both groups of patients, surgery before the development of worsening ejection fraction/LV dilatation is expected to reduce the risk of sudden death, and is associated with lower peri-operative mortality. Also, surgery is optimally performed immediately in acute cases.

===Medical treatment===

Medical therapy of chronic aortic regurgitation that is stable and asymptomatic involves the use of vasodilators. Trials have shown a short-term benefit in the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, nifedipine, and hydralazine in improving left ventricular wall stress, ejection fraction, and mass. The goal in using these pharmacologic agents is to decrease the afterload so that the left ventricle is somewhat spared. The regurgitant fraction may not change significantly, since the gradient between the aortic and left ventricular pressures is usually fairly low at the initiation of treatment. Other rather conservative medical treatments for stable and asymptomatic cases include low sodium diet, diuretics, digoxin, calcium blockers and avoiding very strenuous activity.

As of 2007, the American Heart Association no longer recommends antibiotics for endocarditis prophylaxis before certain procedures in patients with aortic regurgitation. Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent endocarditis before gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures is no longer recommended for any patient with valvular disease. Cardiac stress test is useful in identifying individuals that may be best suited for surgical intervention. Radionuclide angiography is recommended and useful when the systolic wall stress is calculated and combined to the results.

===Surgery===
A surgical treatment for AR is aortic valve replacement; this is currently an open-heart procedure. In the case of severe &quot;acute&quot; aortic regurgitation, all individuals should undergo surgery, if there are no absolute contraindications (for surgery). Individuals with bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis should not wait for treatment with antibiotics to take effect, given the high mortality associated with the acute AI. Replacement with an aortic valve homograft should be performed if feasible.


==Prognosis==
The risk of death in individuals with aortic regurgitation, dilated ventricle, normal ejection fraction who are asymptomatic is about 0.2 percent per year. Risk increases if the ejection fraction decreases or if the individual develops symptoms.

Individuals with chronic (severe) aortic regurgitation follow a course that once symptoms appear, surgical intervention is needed. AI is fatal in 10 to 20% of individuals who do not undergo surgery for this condition. Left ventricle dysfunction determines to an extent the outlook for severity of aortic regurgitation cases.

<text>In affine geometry, uniform scaling (or isotropic scaling) is a linear transformation that enlarges (increases) or shrinks (diminishes) objects by a &quot;scale factor&quot; that is the same in all directions (isotropically). The result of uniform scaling is similar (in the geometric sense) to the original. A scale factor of 1 is normally allowed, so that congruent shapes are also classed as similar. Uniform scaling happens, for example, when enlarging or reducing a photograph, or when creating a scale model of a building, car, airplane, etc.

More general is scaling with a separate scale factor for each axis direction. Non-uniform scaling ([[anisotropic]] scaling) is obtained when at least one of the scaling factors is different from the others; a special case is directional scaling or stretching (in one direction). Non-uniform scaling changes the shape of the object; e.g. a square may change into a rectangle, or into a parallelogram if the sides of the square are not parallel to the scaling axes (the angles between lines parallel to the axes are preserved, but not all angles). It occurs, for example, when a faraway billboard is viewed from an oblique angle, or when the shadow of a flat object falls on a surface that is not parallel to it.

When the scale factor is larger than 1, (uniform or non-uniform) scaling is sometimes also called dilation or enlargement. When the scale factor is a positive number smaller than 1, scaling is sometimes also called contraction or reduction.

In the most general sense, a scaling includes the case in which the directions of scaling are not perpendicular. It also includes the case in which one or more scale factors are equal to zero (projection), and the case of one or more negative scale factors (a directional scaling by -1 is equivalent to a reflection).

Scaling is a linear transformation, and a special case of homothetic transformation (scaling about a point). In most cases, the homothetic transformations are non-linear transformations.

==Uniform scaling==
A scale factor is usually a decimal which scales, or multiplies, some quantity. In the equation &quot;y&quot; = &quot;Cx&quot;, &quot;C&quot; is the scale factor for &quot;x&quot;. &quot;C&quot; is also the coefficient of &quot;x&quot;, and may be called the constant of proportionality of &quot;y&quot; to &quot;x&quot;. For example, doubling distances corresponds to a scale factor of two for distance, while cutting a cake in half results in pieces with a scale factor for volume of one half. The basic equation for it is image over preimage.

In the field of measurements, the scale factor of an instrument is sometimes referred to as sensitivity. The ratio of any two corresponding lengths in two similar geometric figures is also called a scale.

==Matrix representation==
A scaling can be represented by a scaling matrix. To scale an object by a vector &quot;v&quot; = (&quot;vx, vy, vz&quot;), each point &quot;p&quot; = (&quot;px, py, pz&quot;) would need to be multiplied with this scaling matrix:
:formula_1

As shown below, the multiplication will give the expected result:
:formula_2

Such a scaling changes the diameter of an object by a factor between the scale factors, the area by a factor between the smallest and the largest product of two scale factors, and the volume by the product of all three.

The scaling is uniform if and only if the scaling factors are equal (&quot;vx = vy = vz&quot;). If all except one of the scale factors are equal to 1, we have directional scaling.

In the case where &quot;vx = vy = vz = k&quot;, scaling increases the area of any surface by a factor of &quot;k&quot;2 and the volume of any solid object by a factor of &quot;k&quot;3.

===Scaling in arbitrary dimensions===
In formula_3-dimensional space formula_4, uniform scaling by a factor formula_5 is accomplished by scalar multiplication with formula_5, that is, multiplying each coordinate of each point by formula_5. As a special case of linear transformation, it can be achieved also by multiplying each point (viewed as a column vector) with a diagonal matrix whose entries on the diagonal are all equal to formula_5, namely formula_9 .

Non-uniform scaling is accomplished by multiplication with any symmetric matrix. The eigenvalues of the matrix are the scale factors, and the corresponding eigenvectors are the axes along which each scale factor applies. A special case is a diagonal matrix, with arbitrary numbers formula_10 along the diagonal: the axes of scaling are then the coordinate axes, and the transformation scales along each axis formula_11 by the factor formula_12.

In uniform scaling with a non-zero scale factor, all non-zero vectors retain their direction (as seen from the origin), or all have the direction reversed, depending on the sign of the scaling factor. In non-uniform scaling only the vectors that belong to an eigenspace will retain their direction. A vector that is the sum of two or more non-zero vectors belonging to different eigenspaces will be tilted towards the eigenspace with largest eigenvalue.

==Using homogeneous coordinates==
In projective geometry, often used in computer graphics, points are represented using homogeneous coordinates. To scale an object by a vector &quot;v&quot; = (&quot;vx, vy, vz&quot;), each homogeneous coordinate vector &quot;p&quot; = (&quot;px, py, pz&quot;, 1) would need to be multiplied with this projective transformation matrix:

:formula_13

As shown below, the multiplication will give the expected result:
:formula_14

Since the last component of a homogeneous coordinate can be viewed as the denominator of the other three components, a uniform scaling by a common factor &quot;s&quot; (uniform scaling) can be accomplished by using this scaling matrix:
:formula_15

For each vector &quot;p&quot; = (&quot;px, py, pz&quot;, 1) we would have
:formula_16
which would be equivalent to
:formula_17

==Function dilation and contraction==
Given a point formula_18, the dilation associates it with the point formula_19 through the equations
: formula_20 for formula_21.

Therefore, given a function formula_22, the equation of the dilated function is
: formula_23

===Particular cases===
If formula_24, the transformation is horizontal; when formula_25, it is a dilation, when formula_26, it is a contraction.

If formula_27, the transformation is vertical; when formula_28 it is a dilation, when formula_29, it is a contraction.

If formula_30 or formula_31, the transformation is a squeeze mapping.
