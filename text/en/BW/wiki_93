<text>Venetic ( ) is an extinct Indo-European language, most commonly classified into the Italic subgroup, that was spoken by the Veneti people in ancient times in northeast Italy (Veneto and Friuli) and part of modern Slovenia, between the Po Delta and the southern fringe of the Alps, associated with the Este culture.

The language is attested by over 300 short inscriptions dating from the 6th to the 1st century BCE. Its speakers are identified with the ancient people called &quot;Veneti&quot; by the Romans and &quot;Enetoi&quot; by the Greeks. It became extinct around the 1st century when the local inhabitants assimilated into the Roman sphere. Inscriptions dedicating offerings to Reitia are one of the chief sources of knowledge of the Venetic language.

==Linguistic classification==

Venetic is a centum language. The inscriptions use a variety of the Northern Italic alphabet, similar to the Etruscan alphabet.

The exact relationship of Venetic to other Indo-European languages is still being investigated, but the majority of scholars agree that Venetic, aside from Liburnian, shared some similarities with the Italic languages and so is sometimes classified as Italic. However, since it also shared similarities with other Western Indo-European branches (particularly Celtic languages and Germanic languages), some linguists prefer to consider it an independent Indo-European language. Venetic may also have been related to the Illyrian languages once spoken in the western Balkans, though the theory that Illyrian and Venetic were closely related is debated by current scholarship.

While some scholars consider Venetic plainly an Italic language, and Eric P. Hamp in 1954 thought it more closely related to Latino-Faliscan than to the Osco-Umbrian languages, many authorities suggest, in view of the divergent verbal system, that Venetic was not part of Italic proper, but split off from the core of Italic early.

A 2012 study has suggested that Venetic was a relatively conservative language significantly similar to Celtic, on the basis of morphology, while it occupied an intermediate position between Celtic and Italic, on the basis of phonology. However these phonological similarities may have arisen as an areal phenomenon. Phonological similarities to Rhaetian have also been pointed out.

In 2016, Celtologist Peter Schrijver argued that Venetic and Italic together form one sub-branch of an Italo-Celtic branch of Indo-European, the other sub-branch being Celtic.

==Fate==
During the period of Latin-Venetic bilingual inscriptions in the Roman script, i.e. 150–50 BCE, Venetic became flooded with Latin loanwords. The shift from Venetic to Latin resulting in language death is thought by scholarship to have already been well under way by that time.

== Features ==
Venetic had about six, possibly seven, noun cases and four conjugations (similar to Latin). About 60 words are known, but some were borrowed from Latin (&quot;liber.tos.&quot; &lt; &quot;libertus&quot;) or Etruscan. Many of them show a clear Indo-European origin, such as &quot;vhraterei&quot; &lt; PIE &quot;*bʰréh₂trey&quot; = to the brother.

== Phonology ==
In Venetic, PIE stops &quot;*bʰ&quot;, &quot;*dʰ&quot; and &quot;*gʰ&quot; developed to , and , respectively, in word-initial position (as in Latin and Osco-Umbrian), but to , and , respectively, in word-internal intervocalic position (as in Latin). For Venetic, at least the developments of &quot;*bʰ&quot; and &quot;*dʰ&quot; are clearly attested. Faliscan and Osco-Umbrian have , and internally as well.

There are also indications of the developments of PIE &quot;*kʷ&quot; &gt; &quot;kv&quot;, &quot;*gʷ-&quot; &gt; &quot;w-&quot; and PIE &quot;*gʷʰ-&quot; &gt; &quot;f-&quot; in Venetic, the latter two being parallel to Latin; as well as the regressive assimilation of the PIE sequence &quot;*p...kʷ...&quot; &gt; &quot;*kʷ...kʷ...&quot;, a feature also found in Italic and Celtic.

==Language sample==
A sample inscription in Venetic, found on a bronze nail at Este (Es 45):

Another inscription, found on a &quot;situla&quot; (vessel such as an urn or bucket) at Cadore (Ca 4 Valle):

==Scholarship==
The most prominent scholars who have deciphered Venetic inscriptions or otherwise contributed to the knowledge of the Venetic language are Pauli, Krahe, Pellegrini, Prosdocimi, and Lejeune. Recent contributors include Capuis and Bianchi.

<doc id="657402" wikidata="Q319561" url="?curid=657402" title="Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 187 BC)">
<text>Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (c. 230 – 152 BC) was a Roman consul, Pontifex Maximus, Censor and Princeps Senatus. A scion of the ancient Patrician gens Aemilia, he was most likely the son of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, with his brothers being Lucius and Quintus.

According to Polybius, Lepidus was &quot;the handsomest man of his time,&quot; as well as, in the words of Diodorus, being &quot;gifted with superior intelligence&quot;. Combining these qualities with an impeccable aristocratic birth, political skill and a reputation for bravery, Lepidus soon rose to become one of the leading Romans of his generation.

Lepidus was the great-grandfather of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the Triumvir.

==Early life==

Although he was only 15 at the time of the Battle of Cannae in the 2nd Punic War, it was then that Lepidus first distinguished himself. If not at Cannae itself, then in one of the battles closely following it, Lepidus saved the life of one of his countrymen by killing his assailant. For this act of gallantry, the Senate ordered an equestrian statue of the young man erected on the Capitoline to commemorate the deed. It was a remarkable honour for one so young and one that marked Lepidus out for the future greatness he would achieve.

Later that year, 216 BC, Lepidus&#x27; father, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, who had been an augur and twice consul, died and Marcus and his two brothers staged funeral games for three days in his honour.

==Eastern missions==

In 201, Lepidus and two colleagues were sent as ambassadors by the Senate to king Ptolemy V of Egypt, both to announce Rome&#x27;s victory over Carthage and ensure that Rome&#x27;s alliance with Egypt would continue through the coming war with Philip V of Macedon, which the Romans were preparing for. Ptolemy was still only a young boy at this time and there is a tradition that Lepidus for a time acted himself during his stay in Egypt as the king&#x27;s guardian and for a time governed the country. This appeal to Rome for the Senate to send a regent to them was, according to Justin, made by the Egyptians themselves.

At this time also, while in Alexandria, Lepidus sailed to meet personally with Philip while the king was besieging Abydus, in an attempt to persuade him to lift the siege and abandon his attacks on Pergamum and the Rhodians, who had appealed to Rome. Lepidus delivered a message from the Senate that Philip of Macedon must cease from making war on any other Greeks and agree to pay compensation to Attalus I of Pergamum and Rhodes for any damage caused. If Philip would not agree to these terms then he and Macedon would soon find themselves at war with Rome. Rejecting the demands and saying that he was ready for war, Philip took the city and Lepidus departed. The result of the king&#x27;s refusal of these terms was the outbreak of the Second Macedonian War.

==Attempts at the Consulship==
In 193 Lepidus served as curule aedile along with his kinsman Lucius Aemilius Paullus, during which time the two Aemilii constructed two new porticoes, or arcades, in Rome, one of them being the Porticus Aemilia.

Elected as Praetor in 192, Lepidus served his term from 191 and into 190 as the governor of Sicily. Due to the ongoing war between Rome and Antiochus in the East, Lepidus was charged with the defence of the island from attack as well as ensuring that one-fifth of all the corn produced was sent to support the armies campaigning in Greece.

In 190 Lepidus left Sicily early before his term as governor had expired without first asking the permission of the Senate to do so and hastened back to Rome in order to stand in the consular elections. This, however, counted against him and made him unpopular with the people as he was accused of abandoning his province and responsibilities in order to satisfy personal ambition. Following the vote, only one candidate, Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, a rival of Lepidus, had achieved the required majority, but that still meant that the other consulship was vacant. However, the following day, Nobilior co-opted the candidate who had come second, Gnaeus Manlius Vulso, as his colleague and the two assumed the Consulship for 189. Lepidus had polled third out of the four candidates, behind Manlius but ahead of Marcus Valerius Messalla. This humiliating defeat for the aristocratic patrician Lepidus, who likely saw the consulship as his birthright, further embittered a hatred that had already existed between him and Nobilior.

The following election, held later in 189, Lepidus again stood as a candidate for the consulship. Nobilior, however, returned to Rome to conduct and oversee the elections and he used his position to prevent any votes being cast for Lepidus, his personal enemy. As a result, although this time unfairly, Lepidus once more suffered the humiliation of defeat in the elections and could justly blame Nobilior. Instead, Marcus Valerius Messalla, who the previous year had polled behind Lepidus, and Gaius Livius Salinator were elected consul.

For the third successive time, Lepidus stood as a consular candidate in 188, and this time he was successful and was elected consul with Gaius Flaminius as his colleague.

==Consulship==
In 187 BC, as he and Flaminius assumed office, word reached the Senate that the Ligurians were preparing to make war on Rome. This threat so close to Rome caused the Senate to decreed that both consuls should have Liguria assigned as their joint province and command. Lepidus opposed this, protesting that Nobilior and Manlius were still acting like kings in the East even though their terms had expired and yet the Senate still intended to confine both consuls to Liguria without recalling or replacing either of the two Eastern commanders. Either Nobilior and Manlius should be replaced, or their armies should be disbanded and they return to Rome. The Senate agreed to recall Nobilior and Manlius from the East, but reiterated its decision that both Lepidus and Flaminius were to take command in Liguria.

==First man in Rome==
From 180 onwards, he was elected &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; and from 179, he was &quot;princeps senatus&quot;. That same year he was also elected censor along with his great rival Marcus Fulvius Nobilior. In 175, he was elected consul for the second time. He oversaw construction of the Via Aemilia in 187, a Roman road from the town of Placentia to Ariminum, still in use and one of the most important roads in Northern Italy. He established the Roman colonies of Parma and Mutina and gave his name to the Roman castrum of &quot;Regium Lepidi&quot; (today Reggio Emilia).

<doc id="657408" wikidata="Q890613" url="?curid=657408" title="Dong Yuan">
<text>Dong Yuan (, Gan: dung3 ngion4; c. 934 – c. 962) was a Chinese painter.

He was born in Zhongling (钟陵; present-day Jinxian County, Jiangxi Province). Dong Yuan was active in the Southern Tang Kingdom of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. He was from Nanjing, which was a center for culture and the arts.

He was known for both figure and landscape paintings, and exemplified the elegant style which would become the standard for brush painting in China for the next nine centuries. He and his pupil Juran () were the founders of the Southern style of landscape painting, known as the Jiangnan Landscape style. Together with Jing Hao and Guan Tong of the Northern style they constituted the four seminal painters of that time.

As with many artists in China, his profession was as an official, here he studied the existing styles of Li Sixun and Wang Wei. However, he added to these masters&#x27; techniques; he included more sophisticated perspective.

==Works==
The &quot;Xiao and Xiang Rivers&quot; or &quot;Scenes along the Xiao and Xiang Rivers&quot;, a painting on silk (49.80 cm by 141.30 cm), is one of his best-known masterpieces. It demonstrates his exquisite techniques, and his sense of composition. The clouds break the background mountains into a central pyramid composition and a secondary pyramid, by softening the mountain line, he makes the immobile effect more pronounced.

The inlet by breaking the landscape into groups makes the serenity of the foreground more pronounced, instead of simply being a border to the composition, it is a space of its own, into which the boat on the far right intrudes, even though it is tiny compared to the mountains. Left of center, he uses his unusual brush stroke techniques, later copied in countless paintings, to give a strong sense of foliage to the trees, which contrasts with the rounded waves of stone that make up the mountains themselves. This gives the painting a more distinct middle ground, and makes the mountains have an aura and distance which gives them greater grandeur and personality. He also used &quot;face like&quot; patterns in the mountain on the right. A painting attributed to Dong Yuan, &quot;The Riverbank&quot;, is housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and was a gift from New York financier Oscar Tang, though some scholars believe it may be a modern forgery by Zhang Daqian.

<text>Theresa LePore is a former Supervisor of Elections for Palm Beach County, Florida. She designed the infamous &quot;butterfly ballot&quot; used in the 2000 presidential election. This would lead the press to nickname her &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;. Following the controversial results of the 2000 election, she lost her re-election bid in September 2004 and left office in January 2005.

==Career==
LePore grew up in Palm Beach County, attending Cardinal Newman High School in West Palm Beach, Palm Beach State College in Lake Worth and Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton. She began her career in the Supervisor of Elections Office in 1971 as a file clerk. She quickly rose through the ranks and achieved the position of Chief Deputy Supervisor in the late 1970s. During the 1980s, she moonlighted as a ramp clerk at Palm Beach International Airport.

In 1996, LePore ran as a Democrat for the position of Supervisor of Elections. She was elected as the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections in November 1996 and re-elected without opposition in November 2000. LePore switched to No Party Affiliation after the 2000 election. In 2004, she lost re-election as Election Supervisor. After leaving the Supervisor of Elections Office in January 2005, she was employed by the Palm Beach County State Attorney&#x27;s Office for a short period, enabling her to receive her full pension from Palm Beach County. She then worked at her alma mater, Cardinal Newman High School in West Palm Beach as director of development until January 2009.

==Affiliations==
LePore has been a member of the following organizations:
* American Society of Public Administration
* The Election Center
* Kiwanis of Flagler Sunrise
* League of Women Voters
* International Association of Clerks, Recorders, Election Officials and Treasurers
* Women&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce of the Palm Beaches
* Florida State Association of Supervisors of Election. Theresa served terms as Secretary, Vice-President, and President of FSASE.
* Executive Women of the Palm Beaches
* The Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of PBC
* Hispanic Human Resources Council
* Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida

==Election controversy==
In 2000, to accommodate the large number of presidential candidates eligible in Florida, LePore designed a staggered two-page format with candidate names on alternating sides of a central punch button column. Some conservatives claimed the same ballot was successfully used in the 1996 election; in fact, it had never been used in a Palm Beach County election among rival candidates for office. 

A study by &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot; speculated that voters confused by Palm Beach County&#x27;s butterfly ballot cost Al Gore the presidency. A 2024 study by &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;a slam dunk&quot; that, all else being equal, the ballot design swung the election to George W. Bush.

In 2008, she was reportedly writing a book about the 2000 election and the butterfly ballot she designed.

==Popular culture==
In Jay Roach&#x27;s &quot;Recount&quot;, LePore is played by Jayne Atkinson.

Kuopio is home to many bakeries. The city also hosts an annual baking contest.

==Flour==
Traditionally, is prepared with rye flour (like ), although wheat is often added to make the dough more pliable. The filling consists of fish, pork and bacon, and is seasoned with salt (unless the pork is already salted). After being baked for several hours, traditionally in a masonry oven, looks much like a large loaf of rye bread. If prepared correctly, bones of the fish soften and the meat and fish juices cook thoroughly inside the bread. This results in a moist filling.

==Fish==
Traditionally, the fish used in is either vendace (), or European perch (). Sometimes salmon is used. In southern Savonia the vendace is advocated as the only fish for the true whereas in the northern parts of the province the same is said about the perch. Instead of fish, combinations of potato and pork or rutabaga and pork are also used. The appropriate drink to accompany is buttermilk or .

==Serving==

==Etymology==
Some Finnish speakers today find the name somewhat amusing, as is Finnish for &quot;fish&quot; and is &quot;rooster&quot;, leading to the often used but non-morphological translation, &quot;fish cock&quot;. Previous theories suggested that the archaic form of is derived from the same root as (purse). also might come from a Finnish word of , hill, because the dish is elevated. However, in 2008 new research demonstrated that is a loan from Low German and shares the same origin as modern German (to cook) and English &quot;cake&quot;.

<doc id="657419" wikidata="Q777128" url="?curid=657419" title="Robby Benson">
<text>Robby Benson (born Robin David Segal; January 21, 1956) is an American actor, director, and musician. He rose to prominence as a teen idol in the late 1970s, appearing in the films &quot;Ode to Billy Joe&quot; (1976), &quot;One on One&quot; (1977) and &quot;Ice Castles&quot; (1978). He subsequently garnered more fame for voicing the Beast in the Disney animated film &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991) and its numerous sequels and spin-offs. He has also worked as a television director, including six episodes of the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;.

In addition to acting and directing, Benson is an activist in the field of heart research, having undergone four open-heart surgeries since age 28 to correct congenital aortic valve defects and related damage. In 2012, he published a memoir recounting his medical journey and numerous surgeries.

==Early life==
Benson was born in Dallas, Texas, the son of Freda Ann (&quot;née&quot; Benson), a singer, actor, and business promotions manager, and Jerry Segal, a writer. His family is Jewish. When Benson was five years old, his family relocated to New York City, where he was raised. He subsequently took his mother&#x27;s name as his stage name when he was 10. Benson attended the Lincoln Square Academy in Manhattan, where he graduated at age fourteen as the class valedictorian.

==Career==
Benson made his film debut with an uncredited role in &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; (1967) as the Boy Tossing Ball and his Broadway debut in the play &quot;Zelda&quot; followed by the musical &quot;The Rothschilds&quot; (1970). Benson had an early role on the daytime soap &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; (1971–1972). As a film actor, Benson was well known for teenage roles in coming of age films, such as 1972&#x27;s &quot;Jory&quot;, 1973&#x27;s&quot; Jeremy&quot;, and as Billy Joe McAllister in 1976&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Billy Joe&quot;. He had an appearance in a 1973 commercial for Reese&#x27;s Peanut Butter Cups alongside Donny Most who would later co-star in &quot;Happy Days&quot;.

In 1975, Benson appeared in &quot;Death Be Not Proud&quot; and &quot;Lucky Lady&quot;. That year, he also screen tested for the role of Luke Skywalker in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, a role which eventually went to Mark Hamill. In 1977, Benson starred in &quot;One on One&quot; which he co-wrote with his father Jerry Segal, and the TV movie &quot;The Death of Richie&quot;. In 1978, he co-starred in &quot;The End&quot; and &quot;Ice Castles&quot;. Benson, who had never ice skated before, learned to skate in order to film the movie, which had numerous skating scenes, including ice hockey. In 1980, Benson starred in &quot;Die Laughing&quot; and &quot;Tribute&quot;.

In 1981, he costarred in &quot;The Chosen&quot;, based on the book of the same name by Chaim Potok. &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a mixed review, but noted that Benson&#x27;s character Danny Saunders was &quot;full of a gentle inquisitiveness that cannot help but win the audience&#x27;s sympathy.&quot; Benson played Olympic 10,000-meter gold medalist Billy Mills in the 1983 film &quot;Running Brave&quot;. From the filming of this movie Benson implemented his training for the 1983 New York City Marathon, completing the race in 3:05:15. In 1991, he starred as the voice of Beast in the animated Disney film &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, and starring alongside Paige O&#x27;Hara as Belle. Later in the 1990s he voiced lead character J.T. Marsh on the sci-fi cartoon series &quot;Exosquad&quot;.
His 2007 novel &quot;Who Stole the Funny?: A Novel of Hollywood&quot; landed Benson on the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Bestseller list. Benson&#x27;s medical memoir &quot;I&#x27;m Not Dead ... Yet!&quot; was released in June 2012. Outside of acting, Benson is also a musician and composer. He has composed songs in several films and has also won an RIAA Gold Records Award for writing the song &quot;We Are Not Alone&quot; performed by Karla DeVito on the soundtrack of the 1985 John Hughes film &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;.

Benson has been a professor at New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts, the University of Utah, the University of South Carolina and Indiana University.

==Personal life==
Benson has been married to singer and actress Karla DeVito since July 11, 1982. The pair met while starring together in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. Together they have two children, daughter Lyric (b. 1983) and son Zephyr (b. 1992). He practices Transcendental Meditation.

===Health problems and activism===
While a teenager, Benson was diagnosed with a heart murmur caused by a bicuspid aortic valve defect. He began experiencing symptoms such as dizziness and losing consciousness in his late twenties, and subsequently underwent open-heart surgery in October 1984 to repair the valve defect. He received a bovine valve transplant, which lasted fifteen years. After the bovine valve failed, Benson had a second surgery in 2000, during which he underwent the Ross procedure. For six years after his second surgery, Benson had consistent struggles breathing. He subsequently underwent a third open-heart surgery, during which it was discovered that his breathing problems were caused by the previous procedure causing his aortic valve to buckle and close. In 2010, Benson received a delicate fourth surgery known as the &quot;reverse Ross procedure&quot; to correct damage to his heart.

Benson is an activist and fundraiser for heart research, which, in 2004, led him to write the book, lyrics and music for an original Off-Broadway play called &quot;Open Heart&quot;, in which he also starred. Benson also has spoken about his dealing with post-surgical cardiac depression, commenting after his fourth surgery:

<text>Benjamin David Salisbury (born October 19, 1980) is an American actor and dancer best known for playing the role of Brighton Sheffield on the CBS television sitcom &quot;The Nanny&quot; from 1993 to 1999.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on October 19, 1980, to parents David Arthur Salisbury and Mindy Jo (née Schneidewind) Salisbury. In 1998, he graduated from Wayzata High School in Plymouth, Minnesota, and enrolled in American University in Washington, D.C., that fall. He has two older sisters and a younger brother. Salisbury said he first got into acting when he was in a play at 9 years old. In 2000, he was an intern for House minority leader Richard Gephardt. 

== Career ==
An accomplished dancer, Salisbury would often treat &quot;The Nanny&quot; studio audiences to improvisational routines when the cameras were not rolling. Most of Salisbury&#x27;s career was on &quot;The Nanny&quot; from 1993 to 1999. In 1996, he won best actor in a comedy series at the Young Artist Awards.

Salisbury played Martin Short&#x27;s son in the 1992 film &quot;Captain Ron&quot;, and appeared in &quot;D3: The Mighty Ducks&quot; (1996) as the sports announcer. Salisbury voiced the role of Tin Boy on &quot;The Oz Kids&quot; in 1996, and appeared in the 2004 reunion of the sitcom &quot;The Nanny&quot; titled &quot;The Nanny Reunion: A Nosh to Remember&quot; with Fran Drescher, Renée Taylor, Rachel Chagall and others from &quot;The Nanny&quot; cast. In 2005, he had a minor role as a train expert on the episode &quot;Sabotage&quot; of the series &quot;Numb3rs&quot;. In August 2006, Salisbury was featured in Domino&#x27;s Pizza commercials featuring Fudge-ums, Domino&#x27;s then-new mini-brownies.

In 2000, he worked as the events coordinator for Slapshot the Eagle, the Washington Capitals team mascot. As of 2022, Salisbury is working at Universal Studios Hollywood as the director of operations for the park.

== Personal life ==
Salisbury married his wife Kelly Murkey in 2006. He has three children.

Salisbury was a contestant on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, where he competed in an episode of &quot;Teen Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot; against Kirsten Dunst and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Salisbury won with $1, making him one of only three contestants to win with just $1.

<doc id="657430" wikidata="Q1857002" url="?curid=657430" title="Amenable group">
<text>In mathematics, an amenable group is a locally compact topological group &quot;G&quot; carrying a kind of averaging operation on bounded functions that is invariant under translation by group elements. The original definition, in terms of a finitely additive measure (or mean) on subsets of &quot;G&quot;, was introduced by John von Neumann in 1929 under the German name &quot;messbar&quot; (&quot;measurable&quot; in English) in response to the Banach–Tarski paradox. In 1949 Mahlon M. Day introduced the English translation &quot;amenable&quot;, apparently as a pun on &quot;mean&quot;.

The critical step in the Banach–Tarski paradox construction is to find inside the rotation group SO(3) a free subgroup on two generators. Amenable groups cannot contain such groups, and do not allow this kind of paradoxical construction.

Amenability has many equivalent definitions. In the field of analysis, the definition is in terms of linear functionals. An intuitive way to understand this version is that the support of the regular representation is the whole space of irreducible representations.

In discrete group theory, where &quot;G&quot; has the discrete topology, a simpler definition is used. In this setting, a group is amenable if one can say what proportion of &quot;G&quot; any given subset takes up. For example, any subgroup of the group of integers formula_1 is generated by some integer formula_2. If formula_3 then the subgroup takes up 0 proportion. Otherwise, it takes up formula_4 of the whole group. Even though both the group and the subgroup has infinitely many elements, there is a well-defined sense of proportion.

If a group has a Følner sequence then it is automatically amenable.

==Definition for locally compact groups==
Let &quot;G&quot; be a locally compact Hausdorff group. Then it is well known that it possesses a unique, up-to-scale left- (or right-) translation invariant nontrivial ring measure, the Haar measure. (This is a Borel regular measure when &quot;G&quot; is second-countable; the left and right Haar measures coincide when &quot;G&quot; is compact.) Consider the Banach space &quot;L&quot;∞(&quot;G&quot;) of essentially bounded measurable functions within this measure space (which is clearly independent of the scale of the Haar measure).

Definition 1. A linear functional Λ in Hom(&quot;L&quot;∞(&quot;G&quot;), R) is said to be a mean if Λ has norm 1 and is non-negative, i.e. &quot;f&quot; ≥ 0 a.e. implies Λ(&quot;f&quot;) ≥ 0.

Definition 2. A mean Λ in Hom(&quot;L&quot;∞(&quot;G&quot;), R) is said to be left-invariant (respectively right-invariant) if Λ(&quot;g&quot;·&quot;f&quot;) = Λ(&quot;f&quot;) for all &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;f&quot; in &quot;L&quot;∞(&quot;G&quot;) with respect to the left (respectively right) shift action of &quot;g&quot;·&quot;f&quot;(x) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;g&quot;−1&quot;x&quot;) (respectively &quot;f&quot;·&quot;g&quot;(x) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;xg&quot;−1)).

Definition 3. A locally compact Hausdorff group is called amenable if it admits a left- (or right-)invariant mean.

By identifying Hom(&quot;L&quot;∞(&quot;G&quot;), R) with the space of finitely-additive Borel measures which are absolutely continuous with respect to the Haar measure on &quot;G&quot; (a ba space), the terminology becomes more natural: a mean in Hom(&quot;L&quot;∞(&quot;G&quot;), R) induces a left-invariant, finitely additive Borel measure on &quot;G&quot; which gives the whole group weight 1.

=== Example ===
As an example for compact groups, consider the circle group. The graph of a typical function &quot;f&quot; ≥ 0 looks like a jagged curve above a circle, which can be made by tearing off the end of a paper tube. The linear functional would then average the curve by snipping off some paper from one place and gluing it to another place, creating a flat top again. This is the invariant mean, i.e. the average value formula_5 where formula_6 is Lebesgue measure.

Left-invariance would mean that rotating the tube does not change the height of the flat top at the end. That is, only the shape of the tube matters. Combined with linearity, positivity, and norm-1, this is sufficient to prove that the invariant mean we have constructed is unique.

As an example for locally compact groups, consider the group of integers. A bounded function &quot;f&quot; is simply a bounded function of type formula_7, and its mean is the running average formula_8.

==Equivalent conditions for amenability==
 contains a comprehensive account of the conditions on a second countable locally compact group &quot;G&quot; that are equivalent to amenability:

* Existence of a left (or right) invariant mean on &quot;L&quot;∞(&quot;G&quot;). The original definition, which depends on the axiom of choice.
* Existence of left-invariant states. There is a left-invariant state on any separable left-invariant unital C*-subalgebra of the bounded continuous functions on &quot;G&quot;.
* Fixed-point property. Any action of the group by continuous affine transformations on a compact convex subset of a (separable) locally convex topological vector space has a fixed point. For locally compact abelian groups, this property is satisfied as a result of the Markov–Kakutani fixed-point theorem.
* Irreducible dual. All irreducible representations are weakly contained in the left regular representation λ on &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;).
* Trivial representation. The trivial representation of &quot;G&quot; is weakly contained in the left regular representation.
* Godement condition. Every bounded positive-definite measure &quot;μ&quot; on &quot;G&quot; satisfies &quot;μ&quot;(1) ≥ 0. Valette improved this criterion by showing that it is sufficient to ask that, for every continuous positive-definite compactly supported function &quot;f&quot; on &quot;G&quot;, the function Δ–&quot;f&quot; has non-negative integral with respect to Haar measure, where Δ denotes the modular function.
* Day&#x27;s asymptotic invariance condition. There is a sequence of integrable non-negative functions φ&quot;n&quot; with integral 1 on &quot;G&quot; such that λ(&quot;g&quot;)φ&quot;n&quot; − φ&quot;n&quot; tends to 0 in the weak topology on &quot;L&quot;1(&quot;G&quot;).
* Reiter&#x27;s condition. For every finite (or compact) subset &quot;F&quot; of &quot;G&quot; there is an integrable non-negative function φ with integral 1 such that λ(&quot;g&quot;)φ − φ is arbitrarily small in &quot;L&quot;1(&quot;G&quot;) for &quot;g&quot; in &quot;F&quot;.
* Dixmier&#x27;s condition. For every finite (or compact) subset &quot;F&quot; of &quot;G&quot; there is unit vector &quot;f&quot; in &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;) such that λ(&quot;g&quot;)&quot;f&quot; − &quot;f&quot; is arbitrarily small in &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;) for &quot;g&quot; in &quot;F&quot;.
* Glicksberg−Reiter condition. For any &quot;f&quot; in &quot;L&quot;1(&quot;G&quot;), the distance between 0 and the closed convex hull in &quot;L&quot;1(&quot;G&quot;) of the left translates λ(&quot;g&quot;)&quot;f&quot; equals |∫&quot;f&quot;|.
* Følner condition. For every finite (or compact) subset &quot;F&quot; of &quot;G&quot; there is a measurable subset &quot;U&quot; of &quot;G&quot; with finite positive Haar measure such that &quot;m&quot;(&quot;U&quot; Δ &quot;gU&quot;)/m(&quot;U&quot;) is arbitrarily small for &quot;g&quot; in &quot;F&quot;.
* Leptin&#x27;s condition. For every finite (or compact) subset &quot;F&quot; of &quot;G&quot; there is a measurable subset &quot;U&quot; of &quot;G&quot; with finite positive Haar measure such that &quot;m&quot;(&quot;FU&quot; Δ &quot;U&quot;)/m(&quot;U&quot;) is arbitrarily small.
* Kesten&#x27;s condition. Left convolution on &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;) by a symmetric probability measure on &quot;G&quot; gives an operator of operator norm 1.
* Johnson&#x27;s cohomological condition. The Banach algebra &quot;A&quot; = &quot;L&quot;1(&quot;G&quot;) is amenable as a Banach algebra, i.e. any bounded derivation of &quot;A&quot; into the dual of a Banach &quot;A&quot;-bimodule is inner.

==Case of discrete groups==
The definition of amenability is simpler in the case of a discrete group, i.e. a group equipped with the discrete topology.

Definition. A discrete group &quot;G&quot; is amenable if there is a finitely additive measure (also called a mean)—a function that assigns to each subset of &quot;G&quot; a number from 0 to 1—such that

# The measure is a probability measure: the measure of the whole group &quot;G&quot; is 1.
# The measure is finitely additive: given finitely many disjoint subsets of &quot;G&quot;, the measure of the union of the sets is the sum of the measures.
# The measure is left-invariant: given a subset &quot;A&quot; and an element &quot;g&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, the measure of &quot;A&quot; equals the measure of &quot;gA&quot;. (&quot;gA&quot; denotes the set of elements &quot;ga&quot; for each element &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot;. That is, each element of &quot;A&quot; is translated on the left by &quot;g&quot;.)

This definition can be summarized thus: &quot;G&quot; is amenable if it has a finitely-additive left-invariant probability measure. Given a subset &quot;A&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, the measure can be thought of as answering the question: what is the probability that a random element of &quot;G&quot; is in &quot;A&quot;?

It is a fact that this definition is equivalent to the definition in terms of &quot;L&quot;∞(&quot;G&quot;).

Having a measure &quot;μ&quot; on &quot;G&quot; allows us to define integration of bounded functions on &quot;G&quot;. Given a bounded function &quot;f&quot;: &quot;G&quot; → R, the integral

:formula_9

is defined as in Lebesgue integration. (Note that some of the properties of the Lebesgue integral fail here, since our measure is only finitely additive.)

If a group has a left-invariant measure, it automatically has a bi-invariant one. Given a left-invariant measure &quot;μ&quot;, the function &quot;μ&quot;−(&quot;A&quot;) = &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;A&quot;−1) is a right-invariant measure. Combining these two gives a bi-invariant measure:

:formula_10

The equivalent conditions for amenability also become simpler in the case of a countable discrete group Γ. For such a group the following conditions are equivalent:

* Γ is amenable.
* If Γ acts by isometries on a (separable) Banach space &quot;E&quot;, leaving a weakly closed convex subset &quot;C&quot; of the closed unit ball of &quot;E&quot;* invariant, then Γ has a fixed point in &quot;C&quot;.
* There is a left invariant norm-continuous functional &quot;μ&quot; on ℓ∞(Γ) with &quot;μ&quot;(1) = 1 (this requires the axiom of choice).
* There is a left invariant state &quot;μ&quot; on any left invariant separable unital C*-subalgebra of ℓ∞(Γ).
* There is a set of probability measures &quot;μ&quot;&quot;n&quot; on Γ such that ||&quot;g&quot; · &quot;μ&quot;&quot;n&quot; − &quot;μ&quot;&quot;n&quot;||1 tends to 0 for each &quot;g&quot; in Γ (M.M. Day).
* There are unit vectors &quot;xn&quot; in ℓ2(Γ) such that ||&quot;g&quot; · &quot;xn&quot; − &quot;xn&quot;||2 tends to 0 for each &quot;g&quot; in Γ (J. Dixmier).
* There are finite subsets &quot;Sn&quot; of Γ such that |&quot;g&quot; · &quot;Sn&quot; Δ &quot;Sn&quot;| / |&quot;Sn&quot;| tends to 0 for each &quot;g&quot; in Γ (Følner).
* If &quot;μ&quot; is a symmetric probability measure on Γ with support generating Γ, then convolution by &quot;μ&quot; defines an operator of norm 1 on ℓ2(Γ) (Kesten).
* If Γ acts by isometries on a (separable) Banach space &quot;E&quot; and &quot;f&quot; in ℓ∞(Γ, &quot;E&quot;*) is a bounded 1-cocycle, i.e. &quot;f&quot;(&quot;gh&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) + &quot;g&quot;·&quot;f&quot;(&quot;h&quot;), then &quot;f&quot; is a 1-coboundary, i.e. &quot;f&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) = &quot;g&quot;·φ − φ for some φ in &quot;E&quot;* (B.E. Johnson).
* The reduced group C*-algebra (see the reduced group C*-algebra &quot;Cr*&quot;(&quot;G&quot;)) is nuclear.
* The reduced group C*-algebra is quasidiagonal (J. Rosenberg, A. Tikuisis, S. White, W. Winter).
* The von Neumann group algebra (see von Neumann algebras associated to groups) of Γ is hyperfinite (A. Connes).

Note that A. Connes also proved that the von Neumann group algebra of any connected locally compact group is hyperfinite, so the last condition no longer applies in the case of connected groups.

Amenability is related to spectral theory of certain operators. For instance, the fundamental group of a closed Riemannian manifold is amenable if and only if the bottom of the spectrum of the Laplacian on the L2-space of the universal cover of the manifold is 0.

==Properties==
* Every (closed) subgroup of an amenable group is amenable.
* Every quotient of an amenable group is amenable.
* A group extension of an amenable group by an amenable group is again amenable. In particular, finite direct product of amenable groups are amenable, although infinite products need not be.
* Direct limits of amenable groups are amenable. In particular, if a group can be written as a directed union of amenable subgroups, then it is amenable.
* Amenable groups are unitarizable; the converse is an open problem.
* Countable discrete amenable groups obey the Ornstein isomorphism theorem.

==Examples==
* Finite groups are amenable. Use the counting measure with the discrete definition. More generally, compact groups are amenable. The Haar measure is an invariant mean (unique taking total measure 1).
* The group of integers is amenable (a sequence of intervals of length tending to infinity is a Følner sequence). The existence of a shift-invariant, finitely additive probability measure on the group Z also follows easily from the Hahn–Banach theorem this way. Let &quot;S&quot; be the shift operator on the sequence space ℓ∞(Z), which is defined by (&quot;Sx&quot;)&quot;i&quot; = &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 for all &quot;x&quot; ∈ ℓ∞(Z), and let &quot;u&quot; ∈ &quot;ℓ&quot;∞(Z) be the constant sequence &quot;ui&quot; = 1 for all &quot;i&quot; ∈ Z. Any element &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;Y&quot;:=range(&quot;S&quot; − &quot;I&quot;) has a distance larger than or equal to 1 from &quot;u&quot; (otherwise &quot;yi = xi+1 - xi&quot; would be positive and bounded away from zero, whence &quot;xi&quot; could not be bounded). This implies that there is a well-defined norm-one linear form on the subspace Ru + &quot;Y&quot; taking &quot;tu + y&quot; to &quot;t&quot;. By the Hahn–Banach theorem the latter admits a norm-one linear extension on ℓ∞(Z), which is by construction a shift-invariant finitely additive probability measure on Z.
* If every conjugacy class in a locally compact group has compact closure, then the group is amenable. Examples of groups with this property include compact groups, locally compact abelian groups, and discrete groups with finite conjugacy classes.
* By the direct limit property above, a group is amenable if all its finitely generated subgroups are. That is, locally amenable groups are amenable.
** By the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, it follows that abelian groups are amenable.
* It follows from the extension property above that a group is amenable if it has a finite index amenable subgroup. That is, virtually amenable groups are amenable.
* Furthermore, it follows that all solvable groups are amenable.

All examples above are elementary amenable. The first class of examples below can be used to exhibit non-elementary amenable examples thanks to the existence of groups of intermediate growth.

* Finitely generated groups of subexponential growth are amenable. A suitable subsequence of balls will provide a Følner sequence.
* Finitely generated infinite simple groups cannot be obtained by bootstrap constructions as used to construct elementary amenable groups. Since there exist such simple groups that are amenable, due to Juschenko and Monod, this provides again non-elementary amenable examples.

==Nonexamples==
If a countable discrete group contains a (non-abelian) free subgroup on two generators, then it is not amenable. The converse to this statement is the so-called von Neumann conjecture, which was disproved by Olshanskii in 1980 using his &quot;Tarski monsters&quot;. Adyan subsequently showed that free Burnside groups are non-amenable: since they are periodic, they cannot contain the free group on two generators. These groups are finitely generated, but not finitely presented. However, in 2002 Sapir and Olshanskii found finitely presented counterexamples: non-amenable finitely presented groups that have a periodic normal subgroup with quotient the integers.

For finitely generated linear groups, however, the von Neumann conjecture is true by the Tits alternative: every subgroup of GL(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) with &quot;k&quot; a field either has a normal solvable subgroup of finite index (and therefore is amenable) or contains the free group on two generators. Although Tits&#x27; proof used algebraic geometry, Guivarc&#x27;h later found an analytic proof based on V. Oseledets&#x27; multiplicative ergodic theorem. Analogues of the Tits alternative have been proved for many other classes of groups, such as fundamental groups of 2-dimensional simplicial complexes of non-positive curvature.

<text>Card manipulation, commonly known as card magic, is the branch of magic that deals with creating effects using sleight of hand techniques involving playing cards. Card manipulation is often used in magical performances, especially in close-up, parlor, and street magic. Some of the most recognized names in this field include Dai Vernon, Tony Slydini, Ed Marlo, S.W. Erdnase, Richard Turner, John Scarne, Ricky Jay and René Lavand. Before becoming world-famous for his escapes, Houdini billed himself as &quot;The King of Cards&quot;. Among the more well-known card tricks relying on card manipulation are Ambitious Card, and Three-card Monte, a common street hustle also known as Find the Lady.

==History==

Playing cards became popular with magicians in the 15th century as they were props which were inexpensive, versatile, and easily accessible. Card magic has bloomed into one of the most popular branches of magic, accumulating thousands of techniques and ideas. These range from complex mathematics like those used by Persi Diaconis, the use of psychological techniques like those taught by Banachek, to extremely difficult sleight of hand like that of Ed Marlo and Dai Vernon.

Card magic, in one form or another, likely dates from the time playing cards became commonly known, towards the second half of the fourteenth century, but its history in this period is largely undocumented. Compared to sleight of hand magic in general and to cups and balls, it is a new form of magic. However, due to its versatility as a prop it has become popular amongst modern magicians.

Martin Gardner called S.W. Erdnase&#x27;s 1902 treatise on card manipulation &quot;Artifice, Ruse and Subterfuge at the Card Table: A Treatise on the Science and Art of Manipulating Cards&quot; &quot;the most famous, the most carefully studied book ever published on the art of manipulating cards at gaming tables&quot;.

==Technique==
Illusions performed with playing cards are constructed using basic card manipulation techniques (or sleights). It is the intention of the performer that such sleights are performed in a manner which is undetectable to the audience—however, that result takes practice and a thorough understanding of method. Manipulation techniques include:

===Lifts===
Lifts are techniques which extract one or more cards from a deck. The produced card(s) are normally known to the audience, for example having previously been selected or identified as part of the illusion. In sleight of hand, a &quot;double lift&quot; can be made to extract two cards from the deck, but held together to appear as one card.

===False deals===
Dealing cards (for example at the start of a traditional card game) is considered a fair means of distributing cards. False deals are techniques which appear to deliver cards fairly, when actually the cards delivered are predetermined or known to the performer. False dealing techniques include: second dealing, bottom dealing, middle dealing, false counts (more or less cards are dealt than expected), and double dealing (the top and bottom cards of a small packet are dealt together).

=== Side steal === 

A technique invented by magician F. W. Conradi. It is used to control a predetermined card to the top of a deck (most of the time).

===Passes===
The effect of the card pass is that an identified card is inserted somewhere into a deck. However, following rapid and concealed manipulation by the performer, it is secretly moved or displaced - usually to the top (or bottom) of the deck. A pass is achieved by swapping the portion of the deck from the identified card downwards, with the portion of the deck above the identified card (cutting the deck secretly to control a certain card). Pass techniques include: the classic pass, the invisible turn-over pass, the Zingone Perfect Table pass, the flesh grip pass, the jog pass, the Braue pass, the Charlier pass, the finger palm pass and the Hermann pass. Simply, a card pass is a secret cut of the deck (not to be confused with a coin pass which is a false transfer of a coin from one hand to the other).

===Palming===
Palming is a technique for holding or concealing one or more cards in the palm of the hand. Cards palmed from a deck are typically held in reserve (unseen by the audience) until production is required for the illusion being performed. Palming techniques include: the Braue diagonal tip-up, the swing, the thumb-count, face card palm, the crosswise, new vertical, the gamblers&#x27; squaring, the gamblers&#x27; flat, the Hugard top palm, the flip-over, the Hofzinser bottom, the Braue bottom, the Tenkai palm and the Zingone bottom.

===False shuffles===
Shuffling cards is considered a fair means to randomize the cards contained in a deck. False shuffles are techniques which appear to fairly shuffle a deck, when actually the cards in the deck are maintained in an order appropriate to the illusion being performed. False shuffles can be performed that permit one or more cards to be positioned in a deck, or even for the entire deck to remain in an unshuffled state (for example the state the deck was in before the shuffle). False shuffle techniques include: the perfect riffle, the strip-out, the Hindu shuffle, the gamblers&#x27;, and various stock shuffling techniques (where the locations of one or more cards are controlled during the false shuffle).

===False cuts===
Cutting a deck of cards is a technique whereby the deck is split into two portions (the split point being randomly determined – often by a member of the audience), which are then swapped – the effect being to make sure that no one is sure of which card is on the top of the deck. False cuts are techniques whereby the performer appears to organise a fair cut, when actually a predetermined card (or cards) is organised to be located on the top of the deck. False cutting techniques include: the false running cut, and the gambler&#x27;s false cut.

===Color change===
A color change is the effect of changing one card to another in front of the spectator&#x27;s eyes. Usually the cards changed are of different colors, or a face card into a number card, in order to make the change more apparent. There are many different techniques to accomplish this effect, but among the most common are the classic color change and the snap change, as they are easier to master than others. Professional magicians usually perform other color changes such as the Cardini or Erdnase change.

===Crimps===
Crimps are techniques whereby part of a card is intentionally physically marked, creased, or bent to facilitate identification during an illusion. Crimp techniques include: the regular crimp, the gamblers&#x27; crimp, the breather crimp and the peek crimp.

===Jogs===
A jog is one or more cards which protrude slightly from somewhere within a deck or stack of cards. The protrusion, although not noticeable to the audience, permits the performer to retain knowledge about the location of the card during other manipulations. While jogs are not always hidden from the audience, they are most often. Some varieties include &quot;in jogs&quot;, &quot;side jogs&quot;, and &quot;out jogs&quot;.

===Reverses===
Card reverses are techniques whereby one or more cards in a deck are made to change their orientation, for example from face up to face down.

===Forces===
Card forces are the sleight which involves forcing a spectator to choose a card that has been predetermined by the performer, while maintaining supposed free choice. Some forces include; the classic force, the riffle force, and the slip force.

=== Misdirection ===

Misdirection, though not entirely specific to card magic, is indeed very prominent in most card performances. In many cases, the ‘skill’ of a card illusionist is determined by how well they can switch the audiences attention from one part of the performance to the next, which becomes more difficult when dealing with hecklers. Magicians can use card techniques like flourishing, verbal misdirection and by cracking jokes, in order to mislead the audience, making concealment of important sleight of hand easier in the process.

<doc id="657446" wikidata="Q48980" url="?curid=657446" title="Liar Liar">
<text>Liar Liar is a 1997 American fantasy comedy film directed by Tom Shadyac and written by Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur. It stars Jim Carrey as a lawyer who built his entire career on lying but finds himself cursed to speak only the truth for a single day, during which he struggles to maintain his career and to reconcile with his ex-wife and son whom he alienated with his pathological lying.

The film is the second of three collaborations between Carrey and Shadyac—the first being &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot; and the third being &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot;—the second of three collaborations between Guay and Mazur—the others being &quot;The Little Rascals&quot; and &quot;Heartbreakers&quot;—and the first of three collaborations between Carrey and producer Brian Grazer, the other two being &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; (2000) and &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; (2005).

The film was released to critical and commercial success, grossing $302.7 million against a budget of $45 million and earning positive reviews from critics and audiences, who particularly praised Carrey&#x27;s performance. At the 55th Golden Globe Awards, he was nominated for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.

== Plot ==

Fletcher Reede is a divorced defense lawyer living in Los Angeles who loves spending time with his young son, Max. However, he has a habit of giving precedence to his career, breaking promises to Max and his ex-wife, Audrey, and then lying about the reasons. After Fletcher misses Max&#x27;s birthday party when senior partner Miranda lures him to get promoted by having sex in the office, Max makes a birthday wish for Fletcher to be unable to lie for one day.

Fletcher soon discovers that he is unable to lie, mislead, or withhold the truth. This alienates him from Miranda and his secretary Greta, gets his car impounded when he confesses all of his traffic infractions and unpaid tickets to a police officer, and causes him an inability to bend the truth in court.

Fletcher&#x27;s newest client is Samantha Cole, a gold digger who wants a net sum from her soon-to-be ex-husband, Richard Cole. The main witness, Kenneth Falk, with whom Samantha has been cheating, is eager to lie in court to win, but Fletcher cannot suborn perjury. Meanwhile, Audrey is planning to move to Boston with her fiancé, Jerry, and decides to take Max to protect him from future disappointments that Fletcher may cause him.

Fletcher tries to delay the case but is unable to lie his way into a continuance. Knowing that he cannot refute the proof of Samantha&#x27;s adultery, he successfully disputes the validity of her prenuptial agreement after overhearing her reveal her actual age, discovering that she signed it as a minor without parental consent. This entitles Samantha to 50% of Richard&#x27;s marital assets, allowing Fletcher to win the case truthfully. However, Samantha also insists on contesting custody of their children for extra child support payments. Fletcher watches as she pulls her crying children out of Richard&#x27;s arms. Horrified, Fletcher demands that the decision be reversed, but the judge holds him in contempt. Fletcher calls Audrey to bail him out, but she informs him that their plane leaves for Boston that night. Greta, having realized that Fletcher turned over a new leaf, pays his bail.

Fletcher rushes to the airport, but Audrey and Max&#x27;s plane has left the gate. In desperation, he hijacks a mobile stairway to pursue the plane onto the runway. He gets the plane to stop but is injured after he crashes the mobile stairway and gets thrown off. On a stretcher, Fletcher vows to Max that he will spend more time with him. He says that despite the fact that he is free to lie now that the 24 hours have elapsed, it feels better to be honest. Max believes him, and Audrey, encouraged by Jerry, decides to remain in California.

One year later, Fletcher and Audrey are celebrating Max&#x27;s birthday. Max makes a birthday wish, only to find that Fletcher and Audrey are kissing when the lights come back on. Fletcher asks Max if he wished for them to get back together, but Max says he only wished for rollerblades. The family returns to normal as Fletcher chases Audrey and Max around the house with &quot;the Claw&quot;, a game that Fletcher often plays with Max.

==Cast==
In addition to portraying Fletcher Reede, Carrey has a cameo appearance as Fire Marshall Bill at the end of the film, seeing to Reede&#x27;s injuries after he crashes a mobile stairway, reprising his role from &quot;In Living Color&quot;. &quot;Liar Liar&quot; was the film debut of actress Sara Paxton, who played one of Max&#x27;s classmates who attends his birthday party. It was also the last film to feature Don Keefer, who retired in 1997 before he died in 2014, and Jason Bernard, who died shortly after filming was completed. The film was dedicated in Bernard&#x27;s memory.

==Production==
The film was shot from July 8 to October 16, 1996, in Los Angeles.

In an interview, Jim Carrey said filming the film was very physically demanding on him, &quot;because it was this constant suppression of angst, completely freaking out all the time. I would go home with total exhaustion&quot;. The script was rejected by every major Hollywood studios until eventually landed to Brian. The role of Fletcher Reede was envisioned for Tom Hanks and Steve Martin. Hugh Grant was interested in the role, but backed out due to the Divine Brown scandal.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film is the second of three collaborations between Jim Carrey and Tom Shadyac, all of which did extremely well at the box office: the opening weekend made $31,423,025 in 2,845 theaters. It was the second-highest, three-day opener ever for Universal Pictures, only coming second to &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. The film also surpassed &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; to have the largest March opening weekend. It would hold this record for five years until it was taken by &quot;Ice Age&quot; in 2002. At the time, &quot;Liar Liar&quot; had the second-highest opening weekend for an Imagine Entertainment film, behind &quot;Ransom&quot;. The film was ranked number one during its first weekend, beating both the Special Edition release of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and &quot;Selena&quot;. It stayed at the top of the box office for a total of three weeks before being overtaken by &quot;Anaconda&quot;. By late April 1997, &quot;Liar Liar&quot; had already surpassed the Special Edition release of &quot;Star Wars&quot; to become the top-grossing film of the year. In North America, it made $181,410,615, and at the box office in other territories it made $121,300,000 for a total of $302,710,615.

In Denmark, &quot;Liar Liar&quot; earned $453,000 in its opening weekend, making it the third-highest opening for any Universal film in the country, after &quot;Twister&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

===Critical response===
The film received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a rating of 83%, based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 6.90/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Despite its thin plot, &quot;Liar Liar&quot; is elevated by Jim Carrey&#x27;s exuberant brand of physical humor, and the result is a laugh riot that helped to broaden the comedian&#x27;s appeal.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 70 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave it an &quot;A−&quot; grade from an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars and stated, &quot;I am gradually developing a suspicion, or perhaps it is a fear, that Jim Carrey is growing on me,&quot; as he had given negative reviews to his previous films &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; and &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot;.

Some critics noted similarities between the plot with that of an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; entitled &quot;The Whole Truth&quot; where a used-car salesman comes into ownership of a car that is haunted and forces him to tell the truth so long as he owns it. In particular, one scene that bears a resemblance to an element used in &quot;Liar Liar&quot; is the part where the salesman&#x27;s assistant asks for a raise, and he is compelled to come clean that there is no raise.

==Accolades==

<text>WSNY (94.7 FM) is a commercial radio station in Columbus, Ohio. It airs an adult contemporary radio format and is owned by Saga Communications, operating as part of its Columbus Radio Group. From mid-November until the Christmas holidays, WSNY switches to Christmas music. CBS Network affiliate WBNS-TV meteorologists supply WSNY with weather reports. The studios and offices are on Carriage Hill Lane in Columbus.

WSNY has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 22,000 watts and can be heard throughout Central Ohio. The transmitter site is northwest of Downtown Columbus off Twin Rivers Drive near Interstate 670. WSNY broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format.

==History==

On November 11, 1948, the station first signed on as WVKO. Initially, it was a stand-alone FM station, not associated with any AM or TV station. It was owned by Skyway Broadcasting and had studios on South 3rd Street. It added a sister station in 1951, WVKO (1580 AM, now WXGT). Most of its early days, WVKO-AM-FM served Columbus&#x27; black community, with R&amp;B music.

The station began broadcasting a soft adult contemporary format on August 6, 1982, when DJ Chuck Martin played The Beatles, &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; as the first song to launch &quot;Sunny 95.&quot; It acquired the call sign WSNY to go with its Sunny branding.

Tom Collins, who consulted several Josephson International stations, was the Program Director who launched the new AC format for WSNY. The new jock lineup included long time Columbus radio personality Chuck Martin (from WVKO and WCOL) as morning host and Bob Simpson in afternoon drive time.

Other notable personalities in the early &quot;Sunny 95&quot; days include Bob Lewis, Bob Nunnally, Tony Michaels and Perry Joos. Within the first year, legendary urban programmer Harry Lyles replaced Tom Collins as station Program Director. General Manager Steve Joos introduced computerized music research and an effective listener focus group program.

From the late 1990s through the 2010s, Dino Tripodis and Stacy McKay were the morning team, hosting &quot;Sunny in the Morning with Dino &amp; Stacy&quot; for more than 20 years. In June 2018, Tripodis announced his departure from the station after 24 years on-air at WSNY. However, Tripodis returned to WSNY in July 2021 after a three-year hiatus to co-host with McKay in mornings. Both left in April 2024 and a new show debuted in place Their current show is known as &quot;Randi &amp; Rice.&quot;

<text>Young Loftin Gerdine Harris (1812 – April 28, 1894) was an American lawyer, businessman, politician, judge, and philanthropist. He is best known as the early benefactor of Young Harris College in the U.S. state of Georgia, after whom the school was named.

==Biography==
Harris was born in Elbert County, Georgia, in the middle of Walton Harris and Virginia Beverly Billup&#x27;s 8 children. His exact birthday is unknown, and it was not included on his headstone. Primary education was obtained in the common schools, then he attended the University of Georgia.

Harris was admitted to the Georgia Bar in 1834 and began his law practice in Elberton, Georgia, where he was quite successful and represented Elbert County in the state legislature. He and his wife moved to Athens in 1840. He became well known and was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives from Clarke County in 1841 and from 1847 to 1852. He was also a delegate to the 1865 convention that drafted the 1868 Constitution of Georgia. Harris was appointed as judge of the Inferior Court of Athens In 1850, Harris owned seventeen slaves in Athens, Georgia. Harris was one of a group of Athens businessmen who founded the profitable Southern Mutual Fire Insurance Company in 1847. He was initially named Secretary and Principal Director where he proved his financial skill by smart management of the company&#x27;s assets. Harris was company president from 1866 until his death, and the business became one of the largest in the southeast United States. Susan Bevel Allen, whose family worked a plantation, married Harris in 1835. The couple had no children. She died on May 18, 1888, at age 70 after 53 years together.
===Death and afterward===
In the spring of 1893, Harris suffered a serious illness from which he never completely recovered. He died in 1894 and was buried at Oconee Hill Cemetery in Athens. His funeral was well attended, indicating the respect and admiration he had earned.

On January 3, 1909, 112 members founded a new church in Athens. Land was donated by the Reverend Joe Dunaway, with the stipulation that it be named in honor of Judge Young L. G. Harris, who had provided friendship and assistance to Dunaway during his college years. The &quot;Young Harris Memorial United Methodist Church&quot; of Athens celebrated their centennial in 2009.

==Philanthropy==
When Harris and his wife joined the First Methodist Church of Athens, it changed their lives and the lives of countless others who benefited from their generosity. Harris became a devout member, served as church superintendent for many years, and supported Methodism throughout the state. His income from Southern Mutual, legal work and judge&#x27;s salary was substantial, exceeding $10,000 per year. That would be equivalent to $2.29 million today, using the nominal GDP per capita formula. He used his wealth to make numerous contributions to small churches, helped build minister&#x27;s homes, and supported the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association.

Harris served as a member of the Board of Trustees for Emory College, and donated two buildings: the &quot;Marvin Dormitory&quot; and the President&#x27;s Home.

The &quot;Harris-Allen Library&quot; was established at Elberton, Georgia in his wife&#x27;s honor with a gift of $6,000, $1.38 million in 2010 dollars.

===Young Harris College===
In 1886, Circuit-riding Methodist minister Artemas Lester started a school at the small community of McTyeire, Georgia, named after Bishop Holland McTyeire. The goal of the McTyeire Institute was to provide rural Appalachian Mountain children in north Georgia with an opportunity for an education. Lester wrote to Judge Harris, asking for a $100 loan, which was promptly granted. Zell Miller, Young Harris&#x27; most famous native, wrote a history of the school and town. He commented, &quot;Young L. G. Harris was a big Methodist church member and didn&#x27;t have time to come and look at this school in the Brasstown valley, so he sent his associate, a Mr. Thomas, who looked it over and liked the idea.&quot; After hearing positive things about the school, Harris resolved to increase his support of the institution. Harris funded the construction of the campus for $20,000, ($4.27 million in 2010 dollars) then continued to contribute several thousand dollars each year.

The school&#x27;s name was changed in 1888 from McTyeire Institute to &quot;Young Harris Institute&quot; in honor of his strong financial support. Within the next three years it was changed again, to &quot;Young L. G. Harris College&quot;, and the United States Post Office Department was petitioned to change the name of the community as well. The initials were dropped over time to simply, Young Harris College. 

In 1892, a few years after the death of his wife, he donated $4,000 (worth $762,000 today). to construct the &quot;Susan B. Harris Chapel&quot; on the McTyeire campus in her memory. The brick structure contains a bell tower and was home to the local Methodist congregation until a new facility was built in 1949. It is the oldest building on the YHC campus and was most recently renovated in 2009. As of 2011, the structure was used for vespers, lectures, concerts and homecoming.

Provision for the school was included in Harris&#x27; will, even though he never saw the campus. However, dozens of family members contested the will, which was finally settled by the Supreme Court of Georgia in 1897 when the college received $16,000 of the $100,000 estate.

Arguably Harris&#x27; most lasting and significant achievement were his donations to McTiere Institute. An article in the Athens newspaper on May 1, 1894, stated:

Gifts to the school by Judge Harris, at times when they were most needed, established an institution that has shed abroad the light of religion and education and has given to the State of Georgia and to the world a priceless heritage of education and refinement nowhere exceeded. From the halls of Young Harris College, scores of youths have gone forth blessing his name, and their lives have brought honor to their state and country.

Young Harris College is highly regarded in Georgia and has had more of an impact on the state&#x27;s politics and society than would be expected from a small school in the mountains. Over the last 100+ years, many students have chosen careers in public service; the ministry and teaching have been traditional vocations, but some chose politics. One U.S. Senator, two governors, a number of congressmen, state legislators and mayors all started out at YHC.

==Philosophical views==

Young Harris did not talk about his charitable contributions because he was too modest. Even his close friends were not aware of the extent of his generosity. It was said &quot;that little children delighted to crowd around him and hear from him the wondrous story of our Lord&quot;. The author of Harris&#x27; obituary in the &quot;Athens Weekly Banner&quot; quoted Harris just before he died: &quot;I do not think the deeds of a man are near as important in a religious sense as those things he omits to do; and yet a man ought to feel thankful if it can be said of him after death, &#x27;Here lies a blameless man&#x27;.&quot;

===Monument===
A provision of Harris&#x27; will requested that a monument be erected at his burial vault, costing between $1,500 and $2,000. Biographer Paul Paschal questioned why a modest man who lived simply and donated most of his income would request such an expensive and ornate decoration. 
The intricately carved figures of three robed women are mounted on top of the tomb. Close inspection identifies symbols, which reveal the figures to be the three Saints, Faith, Hope and Charity or the three Theological virtues.

The monument appears to be a message to those who visit his final resting place. They represent the principles that guided Harris&#x27; life, and he viewed them as the meaning of life.

<text>Humlebæk is a town within the municipality of Fredensborg in North Zealand in Denmark, approximately 35 km north of Copenhagen. Humlebæk is located at the shore to Øresund and has a population of 9,861 (2024).

The Louisiana Museum of Modern Art is located in Humlebæk.

== History ==
The history of Humlebæk traces back to the 16th century where the urbarium for Kronborg and Frederiksborg fief mentions a fishing village in 1582–1583 with seven fishermen in the settlement.

On 24 July 1700 (O.S.) Swedish forces invaded Denmark at the landing at Humlebæk during the Great Northern War.

In 1740 the inn Humlebæk Kro received royal privilege and in 1792 a school was established.
The dominating property was Krogerup. Krogerup was originally a farm house mentioned the first time in 1577 but over time the property was expanded because of privileges given to the owners of Krogerup as rewards for loyalty to the King during the wars against Sweden. A manor house was built at Krogerup from 1772 to 1777. Krogerup was acquired by the Danish government in 1942 and the land distributed as part of land reforms.

During the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807 the construction of a fortified harbour in Humlebæk was initiated. The harbour was intended to be base of privateer warships and gunboats. The fortified harbour was never finished as the war against the British ended before the finalisation of the constructions. A few years later, in 1810, Humlebæk Harbour was established.

During the second half of the 19th century Humlebæk became a popular resort for the population of Copenhagen during summertime. The Danish steamship company Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab (&quot;The United Steamship Company&quot;) opened a ferry line with steamboats sailing up along the coast of Øresund from Copenhagen with a stop in Humlebæk.

In 1897 the rail line &quot;The Coast Line&quot; from Copenhagen to Helsingør was opened. The railway line had a stop in the newly established Humlebæk Station. The opening resulted in a major boost of Humlebæk and its surroundings. The train station was placed a bit outside the old village of Humlebæk, the fishing village Sletten and the nearby village Toelt. Over time the different settlements grew together. A new settlement grew from the train station to the coast (New Humlebæk, south of the Old Humlebæk next to Humlebæk Harbour). Until 1950 the three areas Humlebæk (New Humlebæk and the Old Humlebæk at the coast), Sletten and Torpen were considered separate settlements.

The development of the population of the three settlements appears from below


The old villages Dageløkke, Torpen (Upper Torp and Lower Torp), Toelt, Nybo are today considered part of Humlebæk.

== Infrastructure and transport ==
=== Trains and buses ===
Humlebæk has train connections to Copenhagen and Helsingør by Humlebæk Station at The Coast Line. Trains depart every 20 minutes in each direction. In rush hours trains are more frequent. The trains are part of the Øresundståg-system and the trains for Copenhagen continues to Copenhagen Airport and to Sweden.

Bus no. 388 in a north–south route between Helsingør and Lyngby station has several stops in Humlebæk at road no. 152 (Strandvejen). Bus no. 353 runs north–south further inland between Helsingør and Kokkedal station. It passes the western part of Humlebæk on Hørsholmvej. Bus no. 370 in an east–west route connects Humlebæk with Fredensborg.

=== Harbours ===

At the coast to Øresund, Humlebæk has two harbours, Humlebæk Harbour and Sletten Harbour. The harbours are primarily marinas but a few minor fishing boats are based in the harbours. Sletten Harbour has previously had ferry connections to Helsingborg in Sweden and to the island Ven in the middle of Øresund.

== Culture and education ==

In 1938 a cinema Humle Bio opened in Humlebæk. The cinema is still active and was renovated in 2023 with new chairs. 

Humlebæk is home of Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. The museum opened in 1958 and has today approximately 600,000 yearly visitors. In 2018 Louisiana was number 7 on the list of most visited tourist attractions in Denmark.

Humlebæk has three primary schools, Langebjergskolen, Humlebæk Skole, and Humlebæk Lille Skole. A fourth school Baunebjergskolen was merged with Humlebæk Skole in 2011 but still uses the old buildings. A folk high school, Krogerup Højskole, is today located at Krogerup.

== Economy ==
The shopping mall Humlebæk Center opened just west of the station in 1977. There are also shops on Strandvejen a little east of the station. The multinational health care company Coloplast has its headquarters in west Humlebæk. Many small companies are located in the nearby industrial quarter on Bakkegårdsvej.

<text>Jack Deveraux is a fictional character from &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, an American soap opera on the NBC network, most famously played by Matthew Ashford since 1987. He is a member of the Johnson family and first appeared onscreen in 1987. Ashford is the third actor to play in the role, and appeared regularly from 1987 through 1993 and from 2001 to 2006, with a few minor breaks in between, in addition to a small guest stint in 2007. In September 2011, after a four-year absence, the character returned to reconnect with his estranged family. His return was short-lived when it was announced that Ashford had been let go, last appearing on August 15, 2012, when the character was killed off in an elevator shaft. From 2016 to 2017, Ashford reprised the role for several guest-appearances; he returned full-time on December 28, 2018. The character has also been portrayed for lesser stints by Mark Valley, Steve Wilder, and Jon Lindstrom.

Many of his storylines have included his relationship with Jennifer Horton, which has made up one of the soap&#x27;s most popular supercouples. They have two children together, Abigail Deveraux and JJ Deveraux, in addition to a grandson, Thomas DiMera and a granddaughter Charlotte DiMera, through Abigail. He recently discovered to have another daughter, Gwen Rizczech. One of the character&#x27;s well known plots have been his fake deaths which occurred between 2003 and 2012, where he was presumed dead four times.

== Casting ==

At the character&#x27;s inception in 1987, the role was played by Joseph Adams from April 10 to July 17, by James Acheson from July 21 to October 26, and by Matthew Ashford from October 30 onward. Ashford went on to play the role through October 29, 1993, reappearing from February 5, 2001, to October 27, 2003, and June 22, 2004, until September 21, 2006, with a guest appearance on April 2–4, 2007, and again from September 23, 2011, until August 15, 2012. Ashford later took a brief absence from the series from October 2003 to June 2004 where he would appear as a special guest star on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;.

Ashford was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in 2012. During Ashford&#x27;s absence, the role of Jack was played by Mark Valley from October 28, 1994, until September 26, 1997, and by Steve Wilder from September 26, 1997, through June 5, 1998.

On November 30, 2015, it was announced that Ashford would briefly return to the soap; he appeared on May 24, 2016. Ashford also briefly appeared on June 20, 2016, August 5, 2016, and August 23, 2016. He made another on-off appearance on December 21, 2017. Ashford returned full-time at the conclusion of the December 28, 2018, episode.

In December 2020, it was announced Jon Lindstrom—the real-life spouse of Cady McClain—would step-in as Ashford&#x27;s body double for scenes between Jack and McClain&#x27;s Jennifer. He aired on December 30 of that year.

==Characterization==
Charming, manipulative, heroic, clever, selfish, arrogant and self-loathing all at the same time, antihero Jack Deveraux is one half of Jack and Jennifer, one of &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;″ most popular supercouples. Although he entered the story as an outright villain wedging himself violently in between another popular supercouple, Steve Johnson and Kayla Brady, Jack eventually grew to establish himself as a core main character in the &quot;Days&quot; mythos through his passion, outrageous sense of humor, redemption, and undying love for heroine Jennifer Horton.

The character has been a frequent winner of Soap Opera Digest Awards, including Outstanding Villain, multiple wins for Best Love Story (with Jennifer), Best Wedding (also with Jennifer) and Outstanding Comic Performance. Ashford was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in 2012.

==Storylines==

When Jack came to Salem, he was seeking treatment for Hodgkin&#x27;s disease. His father, Harper Deveraux hired Kayla Brady to be Jack&#x27;s nurse, and when Steve &quot;Patch&quot; Johnson rejected her, she agreed to marry him. Unfortunately, the match was doomed. Kayla soon began cheating on Jack with Steve, and when he found out (from the newspaper, of all things), he raped her, and had Steve beaten up. A confrontation resulted in a fall off a roof, and Jack wound up needing a kidney. Unfortunately, the only viable donor was his birth brother, who just happened to be Steve (who only donated the kidney when their mother, Jo, asked him to). Kayla pressed charges (which were later dropped) and filed for divorce.

Sometime during this whole fiasco, Jack learned from Melissa Horton, who he had turned to when his marriage had gone sour (not realizing that Harper was trying to frame her for poisoning Kayla), that he was adopted. He turned his back on Harper (who he found out was sterile.) He learned that Jo Johnson was his mother, and Steve and Adrienne are his siblings. It was initially hard for him to accept, but Adrienne convinced Jack to at least try, and he made his mother&#x27;s Christmas when he extended an olive branch...in the form of expensive emerald earrings.

Jack ran for his father&#x27;s seat in the senate against Mickey Horton, Melissa&#x27;s adoptive father, using her to get to him. When she learned the truth, she dumped him. Then he saw his chance for big money...he helped Victor Kiriakis break Harper out of prison for a portion of his fortune, but the plan went bad, and Harper ended up kidnapping Kayla (again). Steve saved her, and his father went back to jail.

Jack bought half the &quot;Spectator&quot; to keep them from running a story about him. He attempted to blackmail co-partner Diana Colville into selling her other half. Originally she refused, but he later got his hands on it. The &quot;Spectator&quot; is where Jack met college student Jennifer Horton. She was trying to help a homeless pregnant girl named Sally, and the two pretended to be married to give the baby a home. Their fantasy love turned into a real thing, but the return of Jennifer&#x27;s childhood sweetheart, Emilio, put a wedge between them. When Melissa returned to town, she tried to push Jennifer and Emilio together, believing Jack had not changed his ways. Jack allowed this to happen believing he was unworthy of Jennifer all the while his actions spoke for him as he kept throwing monkey wrenches into Jennifer and Emilio&#x27;s &#x27;relationship&#x27;. Going so far as to kidnap Jennifer on her wedding day to Emilio.

Jack was interested to learn that Steve&#x27;s ex, Marina, was blackmailing him into helping her find the family fortune. He broke a sane Isabella out of the asylum, and found out all about the treasure from her. After getting his hands on the key to the treasure, all he found was Loretta&#x27;s diary...containing the secret to Isabella&#x27;s paternity. Before giving her the diary, he removed those pages. Without revealing his identity, her father, Ernesto Toscano, planned a cruise to get revenge on his enemies and get the diary, inviting Jack, who took that opportunity to give Isabella the papers proving that Victor was her father. When a bomb exploded on board the ship, the passengers found their way to an island, where Jack and Jennifer made love. Jennifer was devastated when her cousin was presumed dead and Jack was there for her when Ernesto took out himself and Jennifer&#x27;s cousin Hope Brady (or so they thought...).

When Harper returned to town (after having escaped from prison), Jack foiled his plan to kill Steve during his second marriage to Kayla by pushing him off the roof of the bell tower...killing him. His own marriage plans were interrupted when Jennifer stepped in for her high-school chum Katerina von Leuschner (now known as Dr. Carly Manning) and married Lawrence Alamain. When she didn&#x27;t come back, Jack went looking for her, and ended up in a cell next to Katerina&#x27;s brother, François, who he later discovered was the Brady&#x27;s adoptive son, Frankie Brady. The two managed to escape with the help of Lawrence&#x27;s father, Leopold Alamain (who died in the attempt).

When Jack returned to Salem, he hoped to pick up where he left off with Jennifer, and began planning their wedding. When he tried to get romantic with her, she pushed him away, calling him a rapist. He didn&#x27;t know what was going on, but Jennifer seemed to want nothing to do with him, so he broke it off. When he learned that the &quot;Spectator&quot; was in trouble, he married Eve Donovan, who needed a husband to get her hands on Nick Corelli&#x27;s fortune. Once Eve had her hands on the money, the marriage was annulled, and Jack again tried to get back with Jennifer. After nearly dying when the theme train they were in derailed, Jennifer finally admitted to Jack that she pushed him away because Lawrence had raped her. With Kimberly Brady&#x27;s help, Jack found a video of Lawrence confessing to the rape, and he was sent to prison.

Jack and Jennifer finally married in a wild west show. Honeymooning in Universal Studios, they met Hawk Hawkins, a con man seeking to separate them from their money. With the help of his partner, Desirée, Hawk not only got himself a spot in the Deveraux home (after pretending he threw his back out at their place), but managed to convince Jack the FBI was after him. Jack fled, and Hawk managed to get hold of Jack&#x27;s fortune. Before Hawk could leave Salem (with Jennifer in tow), Jack returned and convinced Hawk to admit to taking the money. Hawk went to jail, but Jack and Jennifer were still broke.

Finding out Jennifer was pregnant should have been the best moment of Jack&#x27;s life, but he thought his Hodgkin&#x27;s had returned, and that he would be leaving a widow with a baby girl. So he sold the &quot;Spectator&quot; to Julie Olson Williams, before learning he wasn&#x27;t dying after all. With no home and no money, they accepted Bill Horton&#x27;s offer to move into a house he&#x27;d owned for years. Abigail Johanna Deveraux was born in a cabin outside of town, and Jack got a job freelancing. When he discovered a journal hidden in the attic of the house, he tried to have it turned into a novel, but Kate Roberts turned him down, and then refused to return the manuscript. Unfortunately, Jack had been counting on that money...he&#x27;d stolen some money from Billie Reed (who was holding it for a crime boss) to buy the Spectator back, and had to sell it to Kate...who promptly fired him. When Jack learned shortly after that Abby had aplastic anemia, contracted because he had signed the wrong documents years before resulting in a polluted water well near their home, he decided Jennifer could never forgive him...and left Salem.

Jack wasn&#x27;t seen or heard from for years, until he checked himself into The Meadows (using the name &#x27;Clarke&#x27;), and met a woman named &#x27;Monica&#x27;. The two realized they had a lot in common, and even became lovers. Imagine Jack&#x27;s surprise when he found out Monica was none other than Laura Horton, his mother-in-law who had been released from the mental hospital after he&#x27;d left town. Jack returned to town and moved into the house like he&#x27;d never left...uncomfortable for Jennifer and Peter, but ideal for Jack to get his wife back. He had no idea that his mother-in-law had fallen in love with him.

When Peter Blake took Jennifer to his hometown of Aremid, Jack followed them, and befriended a young woman named Sarah, hoping she would help him. She told him all about the woman in white, but once it was discovered that she was dressing like her (she&#x27;d fallen in love with Jack), Jennifer and Peter discounted the story. The group returned to Salem, Sarah in tow. Jack hid her, until Peter found out and encouraged her to return to Aremid. After Hope saved her from stripping at the Blue Note, Jack took her back to Aremid. Later, he tried again in Aremid to break up Peter and Jennifer, until Peter revealed that Jack had an affair with Laura (to Laura). Also while in Aremid, Jack found the deed to the Blue Note with Peter&#x27;s name on it (proving he was involved in his father&#x27;s criminal activities), but before he could show Jennifer the pavilion caught fire...Jack was saved by Peter in the nick of time. Jennifer discovered Jack&#x27;s affair with Laura when she walked in on Jack comforting her mother, and married Peter in her devastation (while Jack was in jail for arson, charges that were later dropped).

When Tony DiMera was murdered during the wedding reception and John Black the accused, Jack and Jennifer joined forces to prove his innocence. They went undercover at the Blue Moon, but just as they were about to prove Peter and Jude were linked, there was a police bust. Back in Aremid, Jude took Jennifer hostage, and Jack let him go to save Jennifer...who escaped on her own, complete with a matchbook containing the numbers to a bank account in the Cayman Islands. When the two went down there to check it out, Peter magically had the names on the account erased at the very moment they were accessing it. Then they learned that Bo Brady was looking for Hope Brady, who had disappeared, in Aremid, and joined the search. Jack watches Peter shoot Jude in cold blood, but everyone believes that Peter did it in self-defense.

Jack followed Peter and Jennifer to Paris, still trying to prove that Peter was dirty. He found some books that could work as proof, but then Peter blew up the tunnels, and Jack and Jennifer barely escaped. Then Jack found Daniel Scott, the man Peter had hired to romance Laura. When Jack agreed to pay his debts (after luring him into a high-stakes poker game), Daniel confessed his dealings with Peter to Jennifer. She wouldn&#x27;t believe his word alone, but Laura backed her up. After returning to Salem, Peter paid Daniel to tell Jennifer that Jack had bribed him to tell her those lies. Unluckily for Peter, Jennifer went to Daniel on her own, and tricked him into telling her everything. Jack had been planning to leave town until he learned that Jennifer kicked Peter out, and hung around to protect his ex-wife and daughter. He found out Peter was planning to kidnap Jennifer and Abby, but the police couldn&#x27;t do anything. Jack headed over to the house with a gun, and accidentally killed Peter in a struggle. He was arrested for his murder, and bailed out by Jennifer. Too bad for Jack, Stefano had blackmailed a judge, and Jack was sentenced to life. His cellmate in prison was &#x27;Travis Malloy&#x27;, a plant from Stefano DiMera. When &#x27;Travis&#x27; was released, he moved in next door to Jennifer, as Trent Davis.

The retrial began, and everyone figured that the charges would be dismissed because Peter was alive. Kristen DiMera even agreed to testify to that fact, but Stefano&#x27;s presence scared her into silence. He was sent back to prison, and Jennifer got a job there to help him expose the prison system (using Hope&#x27;s credentials). A crooked guard, T.C., was assigned to Jack and took a liking to Jennifer, even attempting to rape her. Jack saved her by bribing a guard to take him to the warden&#x27;s office, and was paid back for it with a beating, not knowing Jennifer was hiding in his cell. T.C. and Trent searched Jennifer&#x27;s home and discovered she was posing as a guard, and Jack&#x27;s visitors were limited to one person...his lawyer, Mickey Horton. When Stefano decided (as part of a master plan) to become a respected resident of Salem, Jennifer told him that nothing better happen to Jack, because he needed the support of the Hortons. He called T.C. to tell him not to hurt Jack, which came just in time...they were seconds away from killing him. Jack realized that T.C. was on the DiMera bankroll.

Jack got himself a new cellmate, Herbie, who used his girlfriend on the outside to sneak Jack the password that Jennifer had stolen for the warden&#x27;s computer. He used it, and learned that &#x27;Travis&#x27; was living next door to Jennifer as Trent Davis. Unfortunately, by the time he got word to Mickey, Trent had kidnapped Jennifer. Finding that out, Herbie helped Jack break out of prison, and he headed to the Grand Canyon to save her. In a fight between Trent and Jack, Trent fell to his death. He and Jennifer returned to Salem to spend Christmas with their family, but Jack snuck away to catch Peter...not realizing that Abby and Jennifer had tagged along. They ended up at a seedy motel, Peter hot on their tail, and ended up being members of the Ward&#x27;s World-famous Circus, where Jack got a job as an animal keeper. Laura accidentally sent Peter right to them, but luckily, circus owner Jasper saved them.

Jack convinced the circus to head to Salem, with a plan to trap Peter, and sent tickets to Hope to get her to come. Unfortunately, Peter had tipped the FBI off to where Jack was hiding, and had him arrested. Jack was heartbroken when Abe came to the jail to tell him that Jennifer&#x27;s car had crashed, and a dead woman had been found inside...presumed to be Jennifer. Jack was released from jail just long enough to attend Jennifer&#x27;s funeral. Jack was exonerated of his crimes when Jennifer&#x27;s &#x27;spirit&#x27; convinced Peter to confess to his crimes. Upon returning home, Jack and Abby found a very life Jennifer, who told them about the plan the circus people had to fake her death and resurrection. Jack, Jennifer, and Abby all left Salem in June 1998 for a vacation in Africa.

While in Africa, something went wrong. The two never ended up getting married, and Jennifer ended up tending bar in Ireland. After Bo found her, she returned to Salem. Jack learned from Alice that she had gone to Paris for Greta&#x27;s coronation, and turned up to try, one last time, to get his wife and daughter back. He has followed Jennifer back to Salem, and the two moved in together so they could look after Abigail. Jennifer initially pushed Jack away, and concentrated on relationships with first Brandon then Colin, but she and Jack couldn&#x27;t resist that certain something that had always been between them. They were remarried, much to the delight of their daughter Abby.

Jack and Jennifer were just beginning to enjoy their married life together again, and to enjoy hosting In the House, a show that was one of Jennifer&#x27;s father Bill Horton&#x27;s wedding gifts to her and Jack. Then Jennifer was dealt the harshest blow of her life when Jack was struck down in an alley behind Salem Place by the Salem Stalker; however, unbeknownst to everyone in Salem, Jack wasn&#x27;t really dead—he&#x27;d been kidnapped to a tropical island that was the spitting image of Salem! He tried to escape to make it back to Jennifer, but ended up lost in the jungle surrounding the compound. Luckily Patrick, Jennifer and Hope were also out there in the jungle, and Jack was there just in time to meet his brand new son. While trying to get back to Salem, Jack and Jennifer were separated and Jack was presumed dead again, but ended up in Tony&#x27;s European castle being held prisoner.

Not one to be down and out, Jack was still determined to get home to Jennifer, and escaped from the DiMera castle, trying to make his way back to Salem. After numerous failed attempts, Jack managed to pair up with Cassie Brady, Marlena Evans and Roman Brady, and the four eventually made it back to Salem. Jack was happy to be home with his wife and children, but he soon began feeling sick, and when he went to Lexie, she advised him he only had a short period of time to live. Although Lexie and later Marlena tried to convince Jack to tell Jennifer, he was determined to enjoy the time he had left with his family without having them concentrate on his illness.

Convinced it was his job to make sure Jennifer was taken care of after his death, he began pushing Jennifer and Frankie to spend more time together. As soon as he thought the two were close again, Jack faked his death and &quot;left&quot; Salem, leaving Jennifer and Frankie to marry.

A few months later he encountered an orderly who looked exactly like his long-lost brother, Steve Johnson. It turned out that the orderly was Steve, and Jack insisted on a DNA test. Jack convinced Steve to return to Salem and reconnect with their family.

Jack returned during Jennifer&#x27;s wedding to Frankie. Because her husband was still alive, Jennifer&#x27;s marriage was invalid. Wanting Jennifer to be happy, Frankie found a cure for Jack&#x27;s illness and Jack and Jennifer left for Europe together.

In the fall of 2010, Jennifer returned to Salem to settle Alice Horton&#x27;s estate. Jack was not with her. Jack had decided to go on a &quot;walk about&quot; in Australia to search for himself and find the meaning of life - or so we thought.

In the fall of 2011, Jack returned to Salem with the real story of where he was for a year. He had been working on a case involving drug trafficking in Europe. He traced the source of the drugs to Afghanistan, lied to Jennifer, Abigail, and JJ Deveraux about where he was going, and snuck into the country. He was soon captured, held prisoner, and tortured. His contact made up the story about the &quot;walk about&quot; and kept up that image so that Jack&#x27;s family would not know about the news story. When Jack was finally released, he returned to Salem to tell everyone the truth. However, Jennifer had already divorced Jack and moved on with Daniel, and Abigail was furious with Jack for lying to the family. Neither was ready to trust Jack again.

Adamant that he had changed and would not lie again, Jack set about getting his family back. But, his first step was to deal with the trauma of being captured and tortured. Jack had developed PTSD. He worked with Marlena and a support group to recover. Eventually, he was able to open up to Jennifer about it.

This led to the two of them reconciling and getting engaged. It also paved the way for Abigail and Jack to rebuild their relationship as well. And, Jack took a job teaching journalism at Salem U.

Jack and Jennifer supported Abe Carver through Lexie Carver&#x27;s terminal diagnosis and death. And, after she died, they attended a memorial/autism fundraiser. However, there was a great explosion that night in the tunnels underneath Salem. Many buildings were damaged, including the banquet hall where Lexie&#x27;s benefit was being held. Abigail was trapped in the elevator.

Jennifer, Jack, and Cameron Davis worked to get Abigail out. When they were able to pry the doors open a little, Jack went into the elevator to rescue Abigail. But, the elevator cables continued to break. Cameron and Jennifer were able to open the doors again and Jack pushed Abigail out. Then the doors closed and the final cables broke. The elevator crashed with Jack inside. Roman reported that the EMTs pronounced Jack dead upon impact.

Jack however returned to Salem with Eve Donovan at his side, at the annual New Year&#x27;s Eve celebration at Doug&#x27;s Place. He had amnesia and didn&#x27;t remember anyone or anything about Salem.

In 2021, Jack discovers that he has another daughter named Gwendolyn &quot;Gwen&quot; Rizczech, from his previous relationship with Tiffany Rizczech, before he came to Salem. Gwen despises Jack for abandoning her as a child, which is why she despises her younger sister, Abigail for getting all the attention that should have been hers after Gwen drugged Abigail in the early 2020. However, Jack claims he doesn&#x27;t remember her mother. However, it is later confirmed that Jack didn&#x27;t know about her or her mother, because Jack&#x27;s mother in-law, Laura Horton was the one who was paying Tiffany to stay away in order to preserve her daughter Jennifer&#x27;s marriage to Jack.

==Reception==
In 2020, Charlie Mason from &quot;Soaps She Knows&quot; placed Jack 29th on his list of the 35 most memorable characters from &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, writing that &quot;To Matthew Ashford&#x27;s credit, he managed to turn the villain who raped [Kayla] into not only a beloved comic-relief character but a well-intentioned hero who became so popular, he was allowed to cheat death. &quot;Repeatedly&quot;.&quot; Mason also called Jack a &quot;born sinner&quot; despite being &quot;however repentant&quot;.

<text>Pierre Huyghe (born 11 September 1962) is a French contemporary artist, who works in a variety of media from films and sculptures to public interventions and living systems. He lives and works in Paris and New York. 

==Early life and education==
Pierre Huyghe (pronounced &quot;hweeg&quot;) was born in Paris in 1962. He studied at the École nationale supérieure des Arts décoratifs in Paris, and graduated in 1985.

==Exhibitions==
Huyghe participated in the Okayama Summit in 2016, and was the event&#x27;s artistic director in 2019. In an interview in Ocula Magazine with Stephanie Bailey, Huyghe explained that he chose &#x27;artists who construct worlds that have the capacity to endlessly change, rather than as makers of things&#x27; — a quality that translates to his own practice.

==Awards==
Huyghe has received a number of awards, including the Nasher Prize (2017), Kurt Schwitters Prize (2015); Roswitha Haftmann Award (2013), the Smithsonian Museum’s Contemporary Artist Award (2010), the Hugo Boss Prize from the Guggenheim Museum (2002), and a DAAD in Berlin (1999–2000). In 2024, Huyghe was awarded the prestigious Grand Prix Artistique by the Fondation Simone et Cino Del Duca.

==Work and themes==
Huyghe has been working with time-based situations and site-specific installations since the early 1990s. His works consist of such diverse forms as objects, films, photographs, drawings, music, fictional characters, and full-fledged ecosystems, in effect treating exhibition and its ritual as an object in itself.

===Role playing===
In &quot;Blanche-Neige&quot;, (1997), Huyghe revealed the face and story of Lucie Dolène, the French voiceover artist whom Walt Disney hired to do the French language version of &quot;Snow White&quot;. When Disney subsequently reissued the film and used Dolmen&#x27;s voice without her permission, she sued the company for the right to own her own voice. Huyghe&#x27;s film is a simply edited headshot of Dolène recounting her experience in her unmistakable (to French ears) voice. &quot;Blanche-Neige&quot; was a more pointed followup to &quot;Dubbing&quot;, (1996), in which Huyghe screens Tobe Hooper&#x27;s film &quot;Poltergeist&quot; but focuses his camera on the fifteen actors who have been hired to do the French voiceovers rather than the projection of the film itself, which is only visible to the actors. In 1999, Huyghe and fellow French artist Philippe Parreno turned this idea of the subjective performance of language into the body of a fictional character by purchasing the rights to a manga figure whom they dubbed &quot;Annlee&quot;. They then invited other artists including Liam Gillick, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Pierre Joseph, Mélik Ohanian, Joe Scanlan, and Rirkrit Tiravanija to produce various works utilizing the character Annlee, the sum of which became the traveling group exhibition &quot;No Ghost Just A Shell&quot;. After several exhibitions, they transferred the character&#x27;s copyright to the Annlee Association—a legal entity owned by Annlee, thus ensuring her simultaneous freedom and death.

===Fiction, memory, and place===
Huyghe&#x27;s two-channel video &quot;The Third Memory&quot; (1999), commissioned by The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago and later exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, takes as its starting point Sidney Lumet&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;, starring Al Pacino in the role of the bank robber John Wojtowicz. Huyghe&#x27;s video reconstructs the set of Lumet&#x27;s film, but he allows Wojtowicz himself, now a few dozen years older and out of jail, to tell the story of the robbery. Huyghe juxtaposes images from the reconstruction with footage from &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;, demonstrating that Wojtowicz&#x27;s memory has been irrevocably altered by the film about his life. &quot;Streamside Day Follies&quot; (2003) was commissioned by the DIA Art Foundation, New York, and involved the integrated relationship between three locales: a fictionalized community in the Hudson Valley that is launching an equally fictional neighborhood festival; a film verité that captures the proceedings of the fledgling festival; and DIA&#x27;s former Manhattan exhibition space. The exhibition entailed the regular creation of a fourth space in which the fictional community, the film, and the gallery would converge. Huyghe accomplished this by designing four walls suspended from motorized tracks that were programmed to intermittently organize themselves into a darkened enclosure in which the &quot;Streamside Day Follies&quot; film would screen. When the film was finished, the walls would disperse. &quot;A Journey that Wasn&#x27;t&quot; (2005) was commissioned by the Public Art Fund and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and entailed similar intersections of a fictional place, a film, and live convergence. As a film work, &quot;A Journey that Wasn&#x27;t&quot; juxtaposes a sailing expedition from Tierra del Fuego in search of an uncharted island off the coast of Antarctica, with the recording (and re-recording) of its symphonic score at the Wollman ice rink in Central Park. The symphonic score was composed by Joshua Cody and featured guitar soloist Elliott Sharp.

&quot;The Host and the Cloud&quot; (2010) is a feature-length film that was shot entirely within the dormant building that had housed the National Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions, Paris. The rambling, melancholy, somewhat sci-fi narrative is structured around the celebrations of Halloween, Valentine&#x27;s Day, and May Day. The film&#x27;s premier at Marian Goodman Gallery, New York, was accompanied by several of Huyghe&#x27;s &quot;Zoodram&quot; sculptures, elaborate aquariums featuring exotic sea creatures that are not unlike the captive human ecosystem depicted in &quot;The Host and the Cloud&quot;. For dOCUMENTA(13) (2012) Pierre Huyghe created &quot;Untilled&quot; (2011–2012), a compost site within a baroque garden, a non hierarchical association that included a sculpture of a reclining nude with a head obscured by a swarming beehive, aphrodisiac and psychotropic plants, a dog with a pink leg, and an uprooted oak tree from Joseph Beuys’ &quot;7,000 Oaks&quot;, among other elements. &quot;Untilled&quot; was ranked third in &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Best Art of the 21st Century list, with critic Adrian Searle calling it a &quot;wondrous work&quot; and &quot;an elegy for a dying world&quot;.

===Anthropomorphism===
&quot;Human Mask&quot; (2014) is a film set in post-disaster Fukushima that depicts the listless activity of a trained monkey-servant dressed in the mask of a young woman.

<text>WNKO (101.7 FM) is an American radio station located in New Albany, Ohio. WNKO plays classic hits and calls itself &quot;KOOL 101.7&quot;.

The station is locally owned and operated by the Runnymede Corporation. WNKO began operating in 1972 and is the sister station to WHTH.

The station had previously covered only the Newark, Ohio vicinity with 3,000 watts of power. In 2009, WNKO filed an application to change its city of license to New Albany, Ohio, change its transmitter location, and upgrade power. The move was tentative on WKSW (now WCLI-FM), formerly in Urbana, Ohio, completing a move into the Dayton market and switching frequencies from 101.7 to 101.5. Until such completion was made, WNKO could not otherwise move because its signal was limited with WKSW.

On March 25, 2011, WNKO began broadcasting from its new transmitter in Johnstown, Ohio. With this change, the station began providing a serviceable signal to the Columbus metropolitan area.

The station&#x27;s management stated that WNKO would continue to concentrate exclusively on serving the Newark area. Moreover, the station identifies itself hourly as &quot;WNKO New Albany-Newark&quot;. However, it is speculated that the move was done to prepare to sell the station in the more lucrative Columbus market.

WNKO broadcasts in the HD format, and is also licensed to broadcast a digital hybrid signal.

<doc id="657478" wikidata="Q720749" url="?curid=657478" title="Gabriele Amorth">
<text>Gabriele Amorth (; 1 May 1925 – 16 September 2016) was an Italian Catholic priest of the Paulines and an exorcist for the Diocese of Rome. Amorth, along with five other priests, founded the International Association of Exorcists.

His work in demonology and exorcism gained him international recognition. Over the course of his career, Father Amorth claimed to have performed tens of thousands of exorcisms, at least 60,000, and became one of the most prominent and controversial figures in the Catholic Church in the modern era.

== Life and work ==
Amorth was born in Modena, Emilia-Romagna, Italy on 1 May 1925 into a family deeply attached to Catholicism and Catholic Action. He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1954 and was appointed an exorcist of the Diocese of Rome in June 1986, under the tutelage of Candido Amantini. He was a member of the Society of St. Paul, the congregation founded by Giacomo Alberione in 1914. In 1990, he founded the International Association of Exorcists and was president until his retirement in 2000.

Both Father Amorth&#x27;s father and grandfather were lawyers. His contributions during World War II as a valiant fighter for the Italian resistance movement were followed by his pursuit of legal studies. Additionally, Father Amorth served as a deputy to Giulio Andreotti, a prominent figure in Italian politics who would later become Prime Minister, within the influential political organization of the Young Christian Democrats.

Amorth died at the age of 91 on September 16, 2016, a short time after he was hospitalised for pulmonary complications.

== Exorcisms ==
In October 2000, it was reported he had performed over 50,000 exorcisms (which ranged from &quot;a few minutes&quot; to &quot;several hours&quot; in length). In March 2010, he said the number had increased to 70,000. By May 2013, he said he had performed 160,000 exorcisms in the course of his ministry. According to Amorth, each exorcism does not represent a victim of possession, but rather each exorcism is counted as a prayer or ritual alone; some possessed victims required hundreds of exorcisms.

Edward Peters, a professor of canon law, finds Amorth&#x27;s claim to have personally performed 30,000 exorcisms over nine years &quot;astounding&quot;. Even accepting Amorth&#x27;s claim that only 94 of his 30,000 exorcisms represented full-blown possession, that would have required roughly one case a month to be thoroughly examined and processed over nine years with hardly a break. 

To account for the high number, Amorth purported that a person might be possessed by more than one demon at once, sometimes numbering in the thousands. He also attributed the number of exorcisms performed to his opinion that &quot;People have lost the Faith, and superstition, magic, Satanism, or ouija boards have taken its place, which then open all the doors to the presence of demons.&quot;

When asked whether the devil can strike inside the Vatican City, Amorth stated, &quot;He has tried already. He did it in 1981 by attacking John Paul II by working with those who armed Ali Ağca.&quot;

According to Amorth, the Catholic Church sexual abuse cases were the result of the work of demons on some priests, who &quot;were not possessed, but rather tempted by the devil.&quot;

Amorth offered the following guidelines to those exercising the charism of exorcism. Any such person must be highly regarded for their prayer life, faith, acts of charity, and judgement. In addition, he must rely solely on the &quot;Word of God&quot; and traditional prayer, be completely detached from monetary concerns, be profoundly humble, and treasure obscurity.

The Vatican last codified the rites of exorcism in 2004 in an updated Latin-language document, De Exorcismis et Supplicationibus Quibusdam.

== Books ==
Amorth wrote two memoirs of his time as an exorcist - &quot;An Exorcist Tells His Story&quot; and &quot;An Exorcist: More Stories&quot;. The books include references to the official Roman Catholic teachings on demonology while the main emphasis is on Amorth&#x27;s experience as an exorcist. Both include references to the diagnosis and treatment of spiritual problems. The books briefly cover the topics of demonic contraction and curses. He states, &quot;A curse can originate from such things as maledictions by close relatives, a habit of blaspheming, membership in Freemasonry, spiritic or magic practices, and so on.&quot;

Father Amorth wrote more than thirty books in Italian, many of which have been translated into other languages. The following are his books in English:
* &quot;An Exorcist Tells His Story&quot; - published on March 1, 1999, by Ignatius Press (translated by Nicoletta V. MacKenzie, and originally published as &quot;Un esorcista racconta&quot;, Roma, Dehoniane, 1990).
* &quot;An Exorcist: More Stories&quot; - published on February 1, 2002, by Ignatius Press (translated by Nicoletta V. MacKenzie, and originally published as &quot;Nuovi racconti di un esorcista&quot;, Roma, Dehoniane, 1992).

Amorth was also interviewed for the second episode of &quot;True Horror with Anthony Head&quot;, presented by Anthony Head. He explained he would never perform an exorcism based solely on someone&#x27;s claims of possession; he always directs people to psychiatrists and doctors first, and that when he sees someone is not possessed, but the person still insists, he replies: &quot;You have no devil. If you have a problem, talk to a good vet.&quot;

== In film ==
The 2017 American documentary film &quot;The Devil and Father Amorth&quot;, directed by William Friedkin, presents the exorcist at work in an Italian village.

Russell Crowe portrays Amorth in the 2023 supernatural horror film &quot;The Pope&#x27;s Exorcist&quot;, very loosely based on the priest&#x27;s two memoirs.

== Views ==
=== Views on yoga ===
At a film festival in Umbria (where he was invited to introduce the 2011 film about Exorcism called &quot;The Rite&quot;), he is quoted as saying that yoga is satanic because it leads to the practice of Hinduism and &quot;all eastern religions are based on a false belief in reincarnation&quot; and &quot;practicing yoga is satanic, it leads to evil just like reading &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.&quot;

=== Disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi ===
Amorth claimed that Emanuela Orlandi, a Vatican City schoolgirl who went missing in Rome in 1983, was kidnapped for a sex party by a gang involving Vatican police and foreign diplomats. He said that she was later murdered and her body disposed of. Amorth claimed that girls were recruited at the Vatican for parties, adding that her death &quot;was a crime with a sexual motive.&quot;

As of 2025, Emanuela Orlandi&#x27;s disappearance remains unsolved.

<text>Kim Delaney (born November 29, 1961) is an American actress known for her starring role as Detective Diane Russell on the ABC drama television series &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, for which she won an Emmy Award. Early in her career, she played the role of Jenny Gardner in the ABC daytime television drama &quot;All My Children&quot;. She later had leading roles in the short lived TV drama &quot;Philly&quot;, part of the of &quot;&quot;, and the first six seasons of &quot;Army Wives&quot;. She also appeared in the second and third seasons as reporter Alex Devlin in &quot;Tour of Duty&quot;.

==Early life==
Delaney, an Irish American, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Joan and Jack Delaney, the only daughter of five children. Delaney&#x27;s mother was a homemaker and her father a senior union official in the United Auto Workers. She was raised Roman Catholic. Delaney has brothers Ed, John, Keith and Patrick. While she was attending J. W. Hallahan Catholic Girls High School, she worked as a model for the Elite agency. Upon graduation, she went to New York and found employment there as a model. At the same time, she studied acting with William Esper.

==Career==
Delaney first became known for her stint as innocent teenager Jenny Gardner Nelson on the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;, which also was her first job. She played the character from August 1981 to August 1984, earning a 1983 Daytime Emmy Award nomination, as well as a loyal fan base; a profile of the actress a decade later noted,&quot;Delaney left the soap in 1984, but fans still remember her as Jenny. &#x27;They come up and will say they&#x27;ve followed everything I&#x27;ve done, and they stopped watching the show after I left, and they&#x27;re so happy to see me on &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, because they love the character.&#x27;&quot;

After leaving &quot;All My Children&quot;, Delaney began acting in feature films. In 1985, she appeared with Emilio Estevez in &quot;That Was Then... This Is Now&quot;, a film version of the S. E. Hinton novel of the same name. In 1986, she played a young nun in the military action movie &quot;The Delta Force&quot;, starring Chuck Norris. In 1987, Delaney was cast as Amanda Jones in &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; opposite Peter Gallagher, but new director Howard Deutch recast both roles with his future wife Lea Thompson and Craig Sheffer before filming. Also in 1987, she appeared both as Jessie in &quot;Christmas Comes to Willow Creek&quot;, and as associate attorney Leslie Kleinberg during the 2nd season of &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. In 1988, Delaney starred in the thriller &quot;The Drifter&quot;. In 1994, she appeared in the film &quot;The Force&quot;.

In 1988, Delaney became a regular on the CBS television series &quot;Tour of Duty&quot;. After leaving the show in 1989 to give birth to her son with husband Joseph Cortese, her character was killed in an explosion—just as her &quot;All My Children&quot; character had died five years earlier.

In the years immediately following her departure from her two early television series, her film and TV roles tended to be few and of low quality, in the opinion of both the critics and the actress herself. A 1996 profile article in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, on the occasion of her landing a prestigious television role at the end of this period, noted:&quot;Delaney&#x27;s résumé is spotted with ridiculous roles that range from a nun in the Chuck Norris action movie, &quot;The Delta Force&quot;, to a possessed nymphomaniac in the soft-core horror film, &quot;Temptress&quot;. &#x27;There&#x27;s a lot of things I did to pay the mortgage,&#x27; Delaney says resignedly.&quot;Roles from this period include her 1992 appearance as Lucky Santangelo in the television miniseries, &quot;Lady Boss&quot;.

In 1995, Delaney began portraying &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; Detective Diane Russell. Originally slated for only four episodes, the role became permanent after her character&#x27;s relationship with Detective Bobby Simone (Jimmy Smits) became a hit with viewers. In this role, she was nominated three times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, winning at the 1997 Emmy Awards.

In 2001, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; producer Steven Bochco chose Delaney for the lead in the new television series &quot;Philly&quot; and she was written out of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;. Despite critical acclaim, the show lasted only one season.

In 2002, Delaney was the female lead on the new CBS drama series &quot;&quot;, a spin-off of sorts from the hit &quot;&quot;. She was written off the series after just 10 episodes; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; suggested that it had been due to a lack of chemistry between Delaney and star David Caruso.

After briefly returning in 5 episodes of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; (one at the end of season 10 and a four-episode story arc mid-way through Season 11), Delaney starred in the 2004 NBC miniseries &quot;10.5&quot;, and its 2006 sequel, &quot;10.5: Apocalypse&quot;. The following year, she began a recurring role on &quot;The O.C.&quot; In 2006, Delaney starred in an episode of &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King&quot; titled &quot;You Know They Got a Hell of a Band,&quot; about Rock and Roll Heaven. Delaney next appeared twice on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; in early 2007, guest-starring on the episodes &quot;Philadelphia&quot; and &quot;Florida&quot;.

Delaney played the main role of Claudia Joy Holden on the Lifetime Television series &quot;Army Wives&quot;. In November 2012, a few weeks after the end of season six, it was announced that Delaney would not be returning for the show&#x27;s seventh season, with a short storyline that her character had died.

In early 2016, Delaney was cast in &quot;God Bless the Broken Road&quot;, a feature film based on the song of the same name. It was released in the United States on September 7, 2018. In September 2020, Delaney joined the cast of &quot;General Hospital&quot; in the role of Jackie Templeton; she made her first appearance on October 6.

==Personal life==
Delaney has been married and divorced twice. She married actor Charles Grant, also known as Charles Flohe, on July 22, 1984. Her second marriage, to actor Joseph Cortese from 1989 to 1994, produced a son named Jack, born circa 1990. She was engaged for a time to producer Alan Barnette.

Like her character in her breakout role on the television series &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, Delaney has struggled with alcoholism. In 2002, Delaney was arrested in Malibu, California, for suspicion of drunk driving after she refused to take a breathalyzer test. She subsequently pleaded no contest and was sentenced to two years&#x27; probation, fined, and ordered to take a defensive driving course. In 2003, after being dropped from the cast of &quot;&quot;, Delaney checked herself into an alcohol rehab center. In 2005, she lost custody of her then 15-year-old son after endangering his life by forcing him to ride with her when she drove while intoxicated, which her son testified was not the first such incident. In 2011, Delaney was pulled from the stage before finishing a long, slurred, odd speech at an award ceremony recognizing the work of former United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates.

<text>Sherry Stringfield (born June 24, 1967) is an American actress. She is best known for playing the role of Dr. Susan Lewis on the NBC medical drama &quot;ER&quot;, a role for which she received three Emmy Award nominations. Stringfield was a member of &quot;ER&#x27;s&quot; original cast, but she quit the show during its third season, despite being contractually tied to appear in five. She returned to the role in 2001, and quit once again in 2005. She is also known for her regular roles on &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; and &quot;Guiding Light&quot;.

She has acted mainly on television, but she has also played various parts in films.

== Early life and education==
The eldest of three children, Stringfield was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Her family briefly relocated to Albuquerque, New Mexico, before settling in Spring, Texas, a suburb of Houston, where Stringfield grew up.

She developed a penchant for acting while attending Klein High School, where she starred in various musicals and plays including &quot;Oklahoma&quot;, &quot;Mother Courage&quot;, and &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. At 18 she attended the Acting Conservatory of SUNY at Purchase — rooming with fellow actress and student Parker Posey. During that time, she appeared in numerous off-Broadway productions and learned to control and alter her Texan accent with the help of a college speech teacher. Stringfield graduated in 1989 with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Fine Arts.

==Career==

===Early career===
She got her first role on the CBS Daytime soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, playing Christina &quot;Blake&quot; Thorpe from 1989 until 1992. After three years she left the show to spend a year traveling Europe, but soon returned to television on the ABC drama, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;. She played Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Laura Kelly, the ex-wife of officer John Kelly (David Caruso) during the first season (1993–94) of the series. Unsatisfied, she was released early from her contract.

=== &quot;ER&quot; ===
Stringfield became one of the original cast members of NBC&#x27;s medical drama, &quot;ER&quot;. Her personal success mirrored the show&#x27;s success — she was nominated for an Emmy Award for lead actress during each of her first three seasons of the show. Stringfield was contractually tied to appear in five seasons of &quot;ER&quot;; however, a desire for a &quot;normal life&quot; and to escape &quot;ER&quot;&#x27;s grueling filming schedule prompted her to leave the drama early in its third season. 
In order to be released from her contract, Stringfield was forced to sign a no-work agreement, which blocked her from working on television for the remainder of her original contract. Stringfield&#x27;s decision to quit reportedly angered the show&#x27;s executive producer, John Wells, because she left just as Dr. Lewis got embroiled in a budding romance with Anthony Edwards&#x27; Dr. Mark Greene. Stringfield has commented: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t describe the situation as pleasant. The producers were in shock. They tried to talk me out of it. It took a long time to get out of my contract.&quot;

Stringfield&#x27;s much publicized departure reportedly &quot;sent a small shock wave through Hollywood&quot; and her exit episode in November 1996 attracted 37 million viewers, the biggest night of the season for the NBC network. Stringfield quit just as television executive Dick Robertson was closing a deal that guaranteed the &quot;ER&quot; cast millions in future earnings from sales to cable and syndication, meaning she effectively &quot;walked away from a fortune.&quot;

Stringfield claims she was asked to reprise the role of Susan Lewis in &quot;ER&quot; several times, but turned each offer down. However, following the birth of her daughter, she approached the producers of &quot;ER&quot; and then rejoined the cast in 2001, the show&#x27;s eighth season. &quot;I changed my mind,&quot; Stringfield commented, &quot;I really want to work now. It just made sense for me to go back to &quot;ER&quot;.&quot; 26.7 million people watched Stringfield&#x27;s return, placing the show at first place in the ratings. During her second stint in &quot;ER&quot;, Stringfield&#x27;s character was featured in a special &#x27;crossover&#x27; with NBC&#x27;s New York City based police drama, &quot;Third Watch&quot;, which aired in 2002. She remained in the role for four additional seasons; however in August 2005, Stringfield announced that she would be leaving the show again as the 12th season came underway. &quot;I am extremely grateful for the time I spent on &quot;ER&quot;,&quot; Stringfield explained. &quot;It is a wonderful show, and there are so many people I will miss. But I&#x27;m ready for new roles and new challenges.&quot; In 2009, Stringfield returned to &quot;ER&quot; for the series finale &quot;And in the End...&quot;.

===Other work===
After leaving &quot;ER&quot; in 1996, Stringfield taught a script analysis class and directed several plays at her alma mater. She took roles in films such as &quot;54&quot; (1998) and &quot;Autumn in New York&quot; (2000) and appeared in the television movies &quot;Border Line&quot; (1999) — produced by her &quot;ER&quot; co-star Anthony Edwards — and &quot;Going Home&quot; (2000), in which she starred opposite Jason Robards. She also guest-starred in the CBS drama &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; in 1999.

In 2005, Stringfield was cast alongside Michael Michele, Blair Underwood, Esai Morales, Gary Cole and Catherine Bell in the pilot episode of the CBS drama &quot;Company Town&quot; (created by Elwood Reid; directed by Thomas Carter), playing Angie Amberson, a mother of teenagers and a whistle-blower on the investment firm where she works. &quot;Company Town&quot; failed to get picked up for the 2006 fall season. The series was produced by Jack Clements and Larry Sanitsky. In 2007 Stringfield starred in the Andrew Shea film &quot;Forfeit&quot;. She played the role of Karen, the ex-girlfriend of a clinical sociopath who schemes and plots to stage a massive robbery and sets Karen up to take the rap.

In 2007, Stringfield guest-starred as attorney Nora March in the CBS drama &quot;Shark&quot;. She also played a recurring role in the HBO drama &quot;Tell Me You Love Me&quot; (previously known as &quot;Sexlife&quot;), which also aired in 2007. In 2009, she appeared in &quot;The Stepfather&quot;, a remake of the 1987 American thriller film of the same name.

She appeared in an episode of the USA Network drama &quot;In Plain Sight&quot;. Stringfield also guest-starred on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; in late 2008 as a ruthless court clerk and Michael Cutter&#x27;s love interest. She also played Mary Jane Porter, an old girlfriend of Larry David&#x27;s who runs into and then goes on a date with him in an episode of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; that aired on October 11, 2009.

In 2010, Stringfield appeared in &quot;Who Is Clark Rockefeller?&quot; playing the role of Sandra Boss.

In addition to acting, Stringfield has done voice-over work, including the voice of Eyeleen in the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; and voicing her &quot;ER&quot; character for the PC game &quot;ER: The Game&quot;. Stringfield was also featured in the U.S. &quot;Got Milk?&quot; advertising campaign, despite being lactose intolerant.

In 2012, Stringfield starred in &quot;The Confession&quot;, a Hallmark Channel movie and a sequel to &quot;The Shunning&quot;.

In November 2013, Stringfield guest-starred in the CBS police drama &quot;&quot; in season 14: episode 8 titled &quot;Helpless&quot;, playing swing shift CSI Dawn Banks. In 2014, Stringfield played a recurring role on the CBS mystery &quot;Under the Dome&quot; during its second season.

In 2017, Stringfield appeared on &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; spinoff, &quot;Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders&quot; as the wife of Gary Sinise&#x27;s character, Jack Garrett.

=== Awards and nominations ===
In 1991 and 1993, Stringfield was nominated in the &quot;Outstanding Villain/Villainess&quot; category at the Soap Opera Digest Awards for her role in &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. She has also received multiple awards and award-nominations for her role as Susan Lewis in &quot;ER&quot;, including three separate Emmy Award nominations in the category &quot;Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series&quot; in 1995, 1996 and 1997. In 1995 she was nominated in the category &quot;Favorite Female Performer&quot; at the People&#x27;s Choice Awards and in 1995 and 1996 she was nominated in the &quot;Best Performance by an Actress in a TV-Series -Drama&quot; category at the Golden Globe Awards.

In 1996, she won a Q Award for &quot;Best Actress in a Quality Drama Series&quot; and in 1997 she, along with several of her &quot;ER&quot; cast-mates, won a Screen Actors Guild Award for &quot;Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series&quot;. In addition Stringfield was voted one of the &quot;100 Sexiest Women in the World&quot; by readers of &quot;FHM&quot; magazine in 1997.

== Personal life ==
In the early 1990s Stringfield dated British businessman Paul Goldstein (chairman of Nevica skiwear) for nearly three years, but the pressures of a long-distance romance eventually ended the relationship.

Stringfield married journalist Larry E. Joseph in October 1998; they have two children. Stringfield and Joseph divorced in January 2006 after seven years of marriage. She currently resides in Los Angeles with her two children.

<text>The Royal Brighton Yacht Club (founded in 1875) is located at Brighton, Victoria, Australia at 253 Esplanade Brighton.

== History ==

It is said to have all begun as a result of a chance race challenge between two gentlemen cleaning their boats on the beach at Middle Brighton in August 1875. One month later, the Brighton Sailing Club was established with fifteen members. By April 1876 the Club (now Brighton Yacht Club) had fifty-seven members and thirteen boats on the register. In 1877 the first building was erected on the site. The Club prospered despite the depression of the 1890s, and by the turn of the century was in a sound financial position with 167 members and a new clubhouse, opened in 1898. So popular was the Club that a branch was opened at Black Rock in 1903, later to become Black Rock Yacht Club.

Keenly competitive, those early members enjoyed spirited Club racing and soon turned to inter-club and inter-colonial competition. At the second inter-club regatta in 1878, thirty-four entries from four clubs vied for prize money in excess of £70. The regatta was a great success, attracting spectators from all parts of the city, and was to establish the Club’s reputation of excellence in race management that continues today. Then, as now, the Club’s facilities had constantly to be expanded, upgraded, rebuilt and refurbished. The pier was first extended in 1904, and a slipway built in 1907. The clubhouse required enlargement in that year also, perhaps to provide elbowroom necessitated by the newly obtained liquor licence!

Extra moorings behind the extension to the breakwater brought new members, and gave new impetus to the Club, a fact not lost on other clubs in Port Phillip Bay. In 1925 another extension to the clubhouse was completed. The Royal Warrant was granted in 1924 by His Majesty King George V. The Club had long had vice-regal connections – Lord Brassey, Governor of Victoria, was elected to membership in 1896, and Lord Forster, Governor-General, was elected in 1921. Both the then Governor-General and Governor of Victoria, Lord Stonehaven and the Earl of Stradbroke, were elected to membership in 1926.

The Club’s association with the Royal Australian Navy was so strong in the early years of this century that the suggestion was made to the Club that it should form a section of the RAN Reserve. Many senior naval officers have been active in the club; the tradition continues today. The storm of 1933 which destroyed the pier and three-quarters of the fleet was a turning point in the history of Royal Brighton Yacht Club. The loss of so many boats hastened the advent of one-design class racing, in which the Club has been successful for more than sixty years. The Club’s support of junior sailing and one-design class racing produced many champions, some of whom have competed at the highest levels.

The resurgence of interest in yachting spurred by the international competition of the America’s Cup challenge of the 1960s required expanded facilities. The marina was completed in the late 1960s and was further extended in 1979. The addition of the hardstand in 1987 accommodated a large one-design fleet, still flourishing today. From the chance meeting of two boat owners on the beach, and the vision of successive generations of members, the Club continues to grow and prosper and will be celebrating 150 years in 2025 . Its spirit of friendly competition and tradition of sailing excellence endures, and the values and traditions developed through its history will preserve it and carry it forward to meet the challenges of the future.

<text>Dave Foley (born January 4, 1963) is a Canadian actor, stand-up comedian, director, producer, and writer. He is known as a co-founder of the comedy group The Kids in the Hall, who have appeared together in a number of television, stage and film productions, most notably the 1988–1995 TV sketch comedy show of the same name, as well as the 1996 film &quot;Brain Candy&quot;. 

Foley is also known for his roles as Dave Nelson in the sitcom &quot;NewsRadio&quot;, Flik in &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, Troy in &quot;Blast from the Past&quot;, Dr. Fulton in &quot;The Middle&quot;, Bob in &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, Gary O&#x27;Brien in &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;, and Danish Graves in &quot;Fargo&quot;. Foley also hosted &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot;.

== Early life ==
Foley was born in Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada, on January 4, 1963. He is the son of Mary and Michael, a steamfitter. His mother is from Stafford, England. 

== Career ==

=== Acting and stand-up comedy ===

After dropping out of high school, Foley pursued standup comedy for about a year in the Toronto Second City Training Centre, where he began taking improv classes and met Kevin McDonald, who gave him a job as an usher at a local art house theatre. He played Lewis Allen in the miniseries &quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot;. Foley, McDonald, Bruce McCulloch, Mark McKinney and Scott Thompson formed The Kids in the Hall in 1984. The troupe&#x27;s eponymous TV series debuted in 1988 and ended in 1995. Foley played characters including Hecubus, one of the Sizzler sisters, the A. T. &amp; Love boss, Bruno Puntz Jones, Mr. Heavyfoot, Jocelyn and Lex. Initially involved with &quot;Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy&quot;, he left the troupe in the middle of the writing, dissatisfied with the internal strife and the quality of the script, and joined the &quot;NewsRadio&quot; cast instead. As he had not signed any contract with the studio, Foley agreed to sign a deal which would allow the rest of the troupe to get paid for the script, though he was convinced that it would never be shot. When it was greenlighted, Foley appeared in the film because he was contractually obligated to do so. He is the only member of the group who is uncredited as a writer. Foley rejoined the troupe in 2000 and has been an integral part of their various reformations. He appeared in the Kids in the Hall 2010 reunion project &quot;Death Comes to Town&quot;. Paul Simms, creator of &quot;NewsRadio&quot;, happened to be a huge fan of Foley&#x27;s work and wrote the role of Dave Nelson specifically for him. Much of his character on the show was based on his own personality quirks, including his coffee addiction and his love of the sitcom &quot;Green Acres&quot;. In 1999, Dave portrayed Troy, the house mate of Eve, in &quot;Blast from the Past&quot;.

Foley was recently reunited with &quot;NewsRadio&quot; writer Joe Furey when he recorded the special featurette &quot;Working with Joe Furey&quot;, an add-on to Furey&#x27;s comedy &quot;Love and Support&quot;. Foley released his stand-up special, &quot;Relatively Well&quot; in January 2013, distributed by Showtime. In the comedy-thriller &quot;The Wrong Guy&quot;, Foley played Nelson Hibbert, an office worker who finds his boss murdered, mistakenly believes he will be blamed for the crime and runs off as a fugitive. In 2001, he played the boss of &#x27;N Sync singer Lance Bass in the film &quot;On the Line&quot;. Foley hosted the CBC Christmas Special, &quot;The True Meaning of Christmas Specials&quot;, in which he, a Mexican Elvis impersonator, Elvis Stojko and Dick Dale travel to Canada in search of the true meaning of Christmas specials. He portrayed Jack McFarland&#x27;s boyfriend Stuart Lamarack on &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; in its 2003-2004 season. In 2004, Foley became host of &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot; on Bravo. In 2007, he appeared nude in Uwe Boll&#x27;s film adaptation of the controversial PC game &quot;Postal&quot; and became the judge for the US version of &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;. He portrayed a middle management employee who happens to be a vampire in the undead office comedy &quot;Netherbeast Incorporated&quot; (2007) and voiced the disgruntled elf Wayne in the holiday special series, &quot;Prep &amp; Landing&quot;. He also guest-starred in the 2007 special, &quot;Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie&#x27;s Two-Four Anniversary&quot;. He played a high school principal in &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;. In 2011, he appeared in &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; as Marshall&#x27;s possible future boss, Mr. Bloom. 

From 2011 to 2012, Foley played Jerry Dunham, the boss of Andrew Carlson (David Hornsby) in the short-lived CBS sitcom &quot;How to Be a Gentleman&quot;. In 2012 and 2013, Foley played Dr. Fulton, Brick&#x27;s (Atticus Shaffer) school therapist in &quot;The Middle&quot;, where in &quot;Life Skills&quot;, he refers to Brick&#x27;s classmates as &quot;the kids in the hall&quot;, after an awkward pause and glance by both characters and mentioning that their behavior is similar to those of comedy sketches from &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;. In February 2013, Foley played Detective Bob Moore for the three last seasons in the TV Land sitcom, &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; (with an unrelated guest appearance as a charity doctor in the first season), starred in the third season of &quot;Robson Arms&quot; on CTV and also starred in the CTV sitcom &quot;Spun Out&quot; in 2014. Foley also starred in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Ken&quot;. In 2023, Foley portrayed central character Danish Graves in the fifth season of &quot;Fargo&quot;.

Foley has also voiced various characters in animated films, television series and video games, such as Flik in &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (as well as reprising for a cameo of the character during the outtakes of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; and the epilogue of &quot;Cars&quot; as well as in a segment from &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, and video games like &quot;Lego The Incredibles&quot;), Yes Man in &quot;&quot;, Terry in &quot;Monsters University&quot;, Agent Rick in &quot;Pound Puppies&quot;, Chris in &quot;Dan Vs.&quot; and Wayne in the &quot;Prep &amp; Landing&quot; series.

=== Web series ===
In 2009, Foley was hired by 49 North Inc./Fuel Industries, a multi-national branded content and entertainment company, to star in a web series titled, &quot;The Sensible Traveler with Bobby Fargo&quot; with six episodes that are written by TV writer Stephen Hibbert and directed by a number of people, including Leslie Iwerks and Chris Roach. The series is one of 49 North Inc./Fuel Industries&#x27; most successful web series at well over 20,000 hits since the beginning of 2010. No word has yet been released as to a second season being filmed.

=== Music video appearances ===
In 1993, Foley appeared along with Mark McKinney and Kevin McDonald in the music video for the song &quot;Heterosexual Man&quot; by Vancouver band Odds. In the video, the three comedians played stereotypical macho jocks in the audience of a small bar where Odds are playing until Foley inexplicably turns into a woman.

He appeared, as one of the Daves, in fellow cast member Bruce McCulloch&#x27;s music video &quot;The Daves I Know&quot;.

He starred in the music video for the 2005 song &quot;Yellow Datsun&quot; by Neva Dinova.
In 2008, he appeared in the alternate music video for the song &quot;Americanarama&quot; by Ottawa band Hollerado, where he parodied American Apparel CEO Dov Charney. He also appeared in the music video for the band&#x27;s song &quot;Desire 126&quot;. In 2010, Foley appeared in a music video for the Los Angeles band Black Robot&#x27;s cover of the JJ Cale song &quot;Cocaine&quot;, which was filmed at the burlesque club Jumbo&#x27;s Clown Room. In 2012, Foley starred in Off!&#x27;s music video for their song &quot;Borrow and Bomb&quot;, playing a &quot;professional educator&quot; named Dale Antwerp who hosts a public access talk show entitled &quot;Teen Talk&quot;. He appeared in another Off! video in 2014 for their song &quot;Red White and Black&quot;, playing the role of a fascist organizer.

== Personal life ==
Foley married Canadian writer Tabatha Southey on December 31, 1991. They divorced in 1997. The couple has two children. In 2001, an interim child support agreement obligated Foley to pay Southey $10,700 a month, a figure based on his income when &quot;NewsRadio&quot; was in production. By 2011, Foley claimed that his earnings had declined to the point that the $10,700 sum constituted &quot;literally 400 percent of [his] income&quot; but he was unable to get the obligation reduced in court. Owing over half a million dollars in back payments, he believed that if he returned to Canada he would be arrested under orders from Ontario&#x27;s Family Responsibility Office. By 2013, Foley and Southey had settled a child support lawsuit, and he was able to resume work in the country of his birth. After he took the lead role in &quot;Spun Out&quot;, he told Vancouver&#x27;s &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot; that &quot;I made enough money to pay the price of admission to Canada.&quot;

Foley married his second wife, actress Crissy Guerrero, on August 1, 2002. The marriage ended in a divorce in 2008. They have a daughter, Alina Chiara Foley, who has worked as a child actor. Guerrero and Foley subsequently reconciled and were remarried on December 31, 2016.

Throughout his life, Foley has suffered from depression. He &quot;used to drink quite a bit&quot;, but stopped drinking on December 22, 2014, after he fell backwards while intoxicated, resulting in a severe head injury. Foley suffered a subdural hematoma and spent four days in the intensive care unit. In February 2019, he remarked that he had not &quot;had a drink in four years&quot; and had experienced almost no depression following his injury.

Foley resided in downtown Los Angeles, before moving to New York City in 2022. He is a fan of coffee, claiming to drink up to &quot;50 cups a day when I am on set&quot;. This was used as a basis for an episode of &quot;NewsRadio&quot;.

<text>Judging Amy is an American legal drama television series that was telecast from September 19, 1999, through May 3, 2005, on CBS. This television series starred Amy Brenneman and Tyne Daly. Its main character (Brenneman) is a judge who serves in a family court for the Connecticut Superior Court&#x27;s Hartford district; in addition to the family-related cases that she adjudicates, many episodes focus on her experiences as a divorced mother and on the experiences of her mother, a social worker in the field of child welfare. This series was based on the life experiences of Brenneman&#x27;s mother.

==Plot==
Amy Gray (Amy Brenneman), an attorney and Harvard graduate, moves back to her hometown of Hartford, Connecticut after separating from her husband Michael in New York City. She and her six-year-old daughter Lauren (Karle Warren) move in with her widowed mother, Maxine Gray (Tyne Daly) who is a caseworker for the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. The move back to Hartford also reunites Amy with her two brothers. Her older brother Peter (Marcus Giamatti) juggles the operations of their late father&#x27;s insurance company along with the struggles he and his wife Gillian (Jessica Tuck) are facing towards starting a family due to fertility issues. At the same time, Amy&#x27;s younger brother Vincent (Dan Futterman) an aspiring writer, struggles to jumpstart his career while working odd-end jobs. Later on, Amy&#x27;s cousin Kyle McCarthy (Kevin Rahm), a former med student, returns to help cope with the rehabilitation of his drug addiction. In her line of work Amy takes on a wide variety of challenging cases, with the assistance of her Court Services Officer Bruce van Exel (Richard T. Jones) and Court Clerk Donna Kozlowski (Jillian Armenante) both of whom she ultimately becomes good friends with. In the &quot;de facto&quot; series finale (the series was canceled after the conclusion of the season) Amy quits the judiciary to run for the U.S. Senate.

==Characters==
===Main===
* Judge Amy Madison Gray, played by Amy Brenneman: After separating from her husband, Amy Gray returns to her childhood home with her daughter, becomes a judge on Connecticut&#x27;s family court, gets a divorce, and tries to get on with her life. Balancing her new job, her family, and trying to rebuild her love life is not easy, but she keeps trying. She makes a name for herself in family court for her unusual methods and sentences and her stubbornness, which sometimes gets her in trouble. She dates several men. Her longest and more serious relationships are with lawyer Stuart Collins and David McClaren. Amy and Stuart dislike each other at first, but when she asks him to be Eric Black&#x27;s lawyer, they get closer and eventually get engaged. However, Amy leaves him at the altar on their wedding day, saying he has a way of always convincing her to do things she does not want to do, calling him &quot;a bully&quot;. She meets David McClaren during her short stint in the criminal court, and things are rocky from the start. Amy becomes pregnant by him and they plan to marry, but things fall apart when she miscarries and they part ways soon thereafter. In the last episode of the series, she quits the judiciary to run for Senate, to try to prevent the passage of a law that will effectively end the juvenile justice system by allowing the State&#x27;s Attorney&#x27;s office to try teenagers as adults at their own discretion. Amy&#x27;s often complicated and ever changing definition of a relationship with her Court Services Officer, Bruce Van Exel, whom she calls her &quot;best friend&quot; and with whom she&#x27;s shared intimate moments – despite his refusal to date white women, ends with him coming to be with her in Washington as she testifies at a Senate Hearing.
* Maxine McCarty Gray, played by Tyne Daly: She is Amy&#x27;s widowed mother. A social worker for the Department of Children and Families, she had retired, but she returns to the job at the start of the series. She is willing to do whatever it takes to help the children in her care, even bending the law. She is an opinionated, strong-willed woman, very set in her ways, and capable of holding long grudges (she has not spoken to her brother in over 12 years), but loving to her family. Her relationship with daughter Amy is often not easy, since they are so much alike. After a troubled courtship, she becomes engaged to a wealthy businessman, Jared Duff, but he dies 48 hours before their wedding (a storyline twist necessitated by the unexpected death of the actor Richard Crenna, who played the character). She later becomes involved in a very complicated, on-again off-again relationship to her landscape designer Ignacio Messina. She suffers two heart attacks in the last season and has to undergo open heart surgery, but makes certain lifestyle changes and recovers well. At the end of the series she accepts Ignacio&#x27;s marriage proposal and is set to retire again, becoming a foster parent to the last child she helped. 
* Vincent Gray played by Dan Futterman (seasons 1–3 &amp; 6; special guest season 5): He is Amy&#x27;s gifted younger brother, with whom she has always been closest. Vincent is the winner of a Pushcart Prize during college, but then went on a backpack tour of Europe because he was overwhelmed with the expectations for success. He later writes a novel titled &quot;A Fortunate Son&quot;, about a Rabbi and his son. He sells the rights to this book to a movie company, who he says are going to turn the Rabbi and other characters into Walkens. He&#x27;s torn about giving up his characters and turns to his sister Amy, who advises him to &quot;take the money and run&quot;, given that he is about to move to San Francisco with his new wife. He later gets a deal for a collection of short stories, but is unable to meet the deadline after the emotional stress of his divorce and he had to give back the considerable advance ($15,000) that he was paid. At the beginning of the series, he is roommates with a man with whom he owns a dog-washing business. When his roommate gets married, he becomes roommates with Donna, with whom he later becomes best friends. As he attempts to continue his writing career, he holds a number of jobs: dogwasher, reporter, and freelancer. He eventually marries his girlfriend, Carole Tobey (Sara Mornell), who has breast cancer, and leaves with her for San Francisco. The impending move causes Amy to become angry with Vincent, but when Amy finds out about Carole&#x27;s breast cancer, she makes amends with him, gives him legal advice on his movie deal – even giving him the family&#x27;s good luck talisman &quot;the Surfing Monkey&quot; at the airport. He comes home briefly when his mother calls and asks him to come help Maxine and Amy patch things up – as a fight has resulted in Amy moving out with extreme tension existing between mother and daughter. Because of Vincent&#x27;s visit, Amy buys the family home, Maxine becomes a renter, and the family is put back together. Sometime later, his cousin Kyle arranges for him to arrive as a surprise to Amy&#x27;s wedding to Stuart Collins. The wedding never happens. He returns home permanently soon after, explaining that Carole has left him for her oncologist. He later explains that this was because he couldn&#x27;t &quot;be there&quot; for her in the way that she needed him to be while her doctor could. Stuck after his book deal is canceled and he is in debt to the publishing company, he starts driving for the Department of Social Services, then gets a job at a teen center. When a teen is shot in front of him, his boss goes on a bender and realizes she&#x27;s &quot;addicted&quot; to Vincent and gets him a job teaching writing at a Maximum Security Detention Center. Vincent seems to attract bad luck – he gets shot while helping a woman being mugged in a grocery store parking lot, then later gets blown up and loses his ability to walk and read.
* Peter Gray, played by Marcus Giamatti: He is Amy&#x27;s older brother. He inherited the family business from his father and he is good at it, even if he wasn&#x27;t given a choice. He is a good man who sometimes surprises people with some outbursts. He and his wife Gillian have been trying to start a family for several years, but their inability to have children of their own leads to them pursuing adoption. Through their adoption agency, they are chosen by a pregnant woman named Evie as adoptive parents to her baby. She gives birth to a boy who Peter and Gillian name Edward, after Peter&#x27;s late father, but call him Ned for short. Shortly after Ned&#x27;s adoption is completed, Evie returns and reclaims her son after Ned&#x27;s biological father reemerges, but ends up returning him to Peter and Gillian after her arrangements don&#x27;t work out. Sometime after adopting Ned, Gillian gets pregnant and gives birth to another son, Walt. Things get rocky after Walt&#x27;s birth and they separate for a while, even dating other people. Peter goes through a &quot;rebellion&quot; phase, trying to recall his teenage dreams, until he finds out his business is almost bankrupt. Soon after, he reconciles with his wife.
* Gillian Gray, played by Jessica Tuck: She is Peter&#x27;s wife. A high strung controlling woman with a good heart, she completely loves her husband. She is usually well-meaning, but also often obsessive and nerve-wracking. After being unable to get pregnant, they adopt baby Ned. Sometime later, however, she gets pregnant, but things go wrong during the delivery of Walt, and she falls into a coma for a while. She and Peter have problems soon after (and she dates another man) but they reconcile.
* Lauren Cassidy, played by Karle Warren: She is Amy&#x27;s daughter, six years old at the start of the series. A mostly well-adjusted girl, she is going through the pains of childhood and preadolescence with divorced parents, but a loving family. She struggles over her father&#x27;s relationship with his new girlfriend Leesha, whom she likes at first. When Lauren is 12, her uncle Peter takes her for her haircut and she returns home with her long straight hair cut into a hipper, shoulder-length cut. Her boyfriend Victor turns out to be the son of one of her mother&#x27;s later boyfriends, David McClaren, which causes Lauren to feel awkward and disgusted. When Amy becomes pregnant with David&#x27;s child, Lauren reveals what a total blow to her social life this will be and is furious. She later becomes accepting and supporting of her mother after she miscarries. Toward the end of the series, Lauren begins to hang out with a group of friends who embrace the straight edge culture, which puts her at odds with her mother.
* Kyle McCarty played by Kevin Rahm (seasons 3–5; special guest season 6): He is Amy&#x27;s cousin, the son of Maxine&#x27;s estranged brother Richard (William Devane). He is a former medical student who was expelled because he was addicted to Dilaudid. Shunning his father, he comes to his aunt Maxine for help. She gives him a home and gets him a job as a counselor at a facility for runaway teens. He later moves in to share a flat with Donna after Vincent leaves and finds a hospital willing to give him a new chance to finish his medical residency, and gets into a complicated on/off relationship with fellow doctor Heather Labonte, as well as fighting an attraction to his supervisor, Dr. Lily Reddicker. After his father dies, he quits his job and finds a new path in life as a medic with the SWAT unit. He finally decides to accompany his ex-girlfriend Heather to Minnesota and take care of their son while she is in rehabilitation.
* Bruce Calvin van Exel, played by Richard T. Jones: He is Amy&#x27;s court services officer, who becomes her friend. The series addresses a number of issues of their cross-racial friendship and how each feels about it. Bruce is a stubborn man with strong convictions, whose advice Amy comes to find invaluable. He has a daughter, Rebecca, whose mother breaks up with him after he gives her an ultimatum to get married after they&#x27;ve lived together for a number of years. At one point, Bruce is suspended from work for punching a man. He performs community service in a soup kitchen before returning to work with Amy. He is a fairly devout Catholic and not thrilled when his sister Winnie takes Rebecca to her more traditional black church with &#x27;more interesting prayers&#x27;. Rebecca and Lauren attend the same middle school. In the second-to-last episode, he quits his job to complete his master&#x27;s degree in family counseling, something he&#x27;d always wanted to do. The attraction between Amy and him is sometimes acknowledged, but never really explored until he comes to be by her side at the end of the series. &quot;You came&quot; &quot;you called&quot; and they hold hands.
* Donna Kozlowski played by Jillian Armenante (seasons 2–6; recurring season 1): She is Amy&#x27;s court clerk. An eccentric woman, she is from a wealthy family, but estranged from them. Donna is a genius (she finishes her Juris Doctor degree in one and a half years) and socially awkward. She is married to a convicted murderer, Oscar Ray Pant, and becomes roommates with Amy&#x27;s brother Vincent. While living with him, she has a daughter by Oscar, Ariadne Gray Pant, to whom she gives birth in a plastic pool in Amy&#x27;s living room. Her mother arrives while Donna is in the pool, but is unable to offer her support and leaves. Maxine ends up getting in the pool with Donna. Later, Oscar confesses to Donna that he is really guilty and she divorces him. Upon passing the bar examination, Amy fires her so she would go to work as a lawyer; she becomes a court-appointed minor counsel for the Hartford Youth Advocates, whose office is across the hall from Amy&#x27;s.
* Sean Potter, played by Timothy Omundson (season 6; recurring seasons 2–5): He is Maxine&#x27;s boss and later friend, who has his hands full dealing with Maxine&#x27;s unorthodox methods. Initially a bit green in his supervisory role, he loosens up over time after his exposure to and friendship with Maxine. Sean and Bruce become friends and work together to establish alternative treatment programs for youthful offenders (such as &quot;Gun 101&quot;), and Sean is revealed in one episode as an avid karaoke singer, which comes in handy for entertaining the guests at Amy&#x27;s and Stuart&#x27;s wedding (which does not quite come off). Sean is also revealed to have come from a rich family, had attended expensive private school, and one time attempts to establish a scholarship fund in honor of his grandfather but the fundraiser doesn&#x27;t work. Sean also dates Courtney Messina, the daughter of Maxine&#x27;s beau, Ignacio, for a while, entertaining her elderly grandmother with a rendition of &quot;Vaya con Dios&quot;.

===Recurring===
* Eric Black, played by Blake Bashoff: He is a gay teenager who had been so badly abused that he was blind for two years. When all else fails, Maxine reluctantly takes him into her home, where he rapidly bonds with the family; afterwards, Sean becomes his foster father. Eventually, Eric protectively confronts and kills a stalker after Amy and Lauren. He is tried and found not guilty, but does so by lying on the witness stand. Maxine is disappointed in him, so he decides to move to Canada with his boyfriend, Mark.
* Dr. Lily Reddicker, played by Kristin Lehman: She is the hospital chief of staff who takes a chance by hiring Amy&#x27;s cousin Kyle. She is a no-nonsense supervisor who recognizes Kyle&#x27;s superb medical skills and his need to return to medicine, which he tries to hide behind a sarcastic view of the world. She fights an attraction to Kyle because of their professional relationship and her fears that pursuing it create problems for Kyle because of his addiction problems. Kyle soon becomes troubled by his attraction to both Dr. Lily and a fellow resident, Heather Labonte.
* Heather Labonte, played by Sarah Danielle Madison: She is a doctor at Kyle&#x27;s hospital with a substance abuse problem, who gets busted with a drug test and then gets a job as a bartender, which she says is a better job with better pay. She has an on/off relationship with Kyle, until she gets pregnant. Kyle doesn&#x27;t believe she was pregnant, and claims he even visited her father who also said there was no baby. When Heather returns and tells Kyle she is going into rehab and the baby would be staying with her sister, he still doesn&#x27;t believe her – until his Aunt Maxine literally beats on his chest and yells at him &quot;don&#x27;t you dare abandon your son!&quot; and, after apologizing, reminds him that the best decisions aren&#x27;t the easy ones. As a result, Kyle decides to accompany Heather to Minnesota and take care of their son while she is in rehabilitation.
* Louann &quot;Crystal&quot; Turner, played by Jennifer Esposito: She is a former meth addict who runs an outreach program for homeless teenagers. She had a relationship with Vincent and worked with him until they witness a young prostitute get murdered. She goes on a bender and tries to seduce Vincent.

As time passes, she makes progress, though she is arrested one day for murder, as she was in the car with her cousin when she was involved in a drive-by shooting.

The cousin later recants, but Graciela is murdered in a gang retaliation before Amy can get her out of prison. (See also #Murdered cast member below.)
* Rob Holbrook, played by Jim Parsons: He is a young clerk hired by Amy to replace Donna after her departure. Innocent and extremely eager to please, he proves his worth when his knowledge of Spanish comes into play in a case.

Michael tried to obtain full custody of Lauren, hoping his daughter would help him to mend his second marriage. He dropped the case when Leesha left him. He told Amy, though he stood by what he said about her in court, she was still a better parent than he.

* Barry Krumble (Chris Sarandon): He is a fellow judge, whom Amy dated briefly.

* Stuart Collins (Reed Diamond): He is a lawyer who, after several on/offs, became engaged to Amy. They rekindled their relationship when she asked him to be Eric Black&#x27;s lawyer, but she ended the relationship by leaving him at the altar.

* David McClaren (Adrian Pasdar): He is a widowed assistant state&#x27;s attorney and the father of Lauren&#x27;s boyfriend, Victor. His relationship with Amy was rocky from the beginning, as he was still dealing with his wife&#x27;s murder. He attended victims&#x27; support group meetings, one of which he asked Amy to attend. Amy became pregnant by him, and they planned to buy a house together. Amy had a miscarriage and, in her grief, kept David at a distance. This resulted in him breaking up with her.

====Maxine&#x27;s love interests====
* Jared Duff (Richard Crenna): He is a wealthy businessman who met Maxine at a local diner, which he later purchased for her. Things between them became rocky several times, once because of his son&#x27;s opposition to the relationship. They became engaged in 2003, but Jared died two days before the wedding.
* Ignacio Messina (Cheech Marin): He is the landscape designer whom Maxine hired to work on her garden. The two became close, but Maxine learned he was not legally divorced from his wife and he had two children: Courtney Messina (Jossara Jinaro) and Raul Messina (Tito Ortiz). Ignacio&#x27;s mother hated Maxine, which she found extremely funny. Maxine refused to date him when she learned his divorce wasn&#x27;t final. They continued their friendship bound by a complicated set of rules Maxine established to prove they weren&#x27;t dating. He remained very supportive during Maxine&#x27;s health problems. When his divorce became final, they began dating again in a complicated relationship. At one point Maxine thought they were getting too close and she actually gave him away to her friend Patsy. She later regretted it and asked Ignacio to dump Patsy. He refuses to live by Maxine&#x27;s ever-changing rules and confronts her with a marriage proposal as a solution, which she accepts.

==Broadcast==
After six seasons, &quot;Judging Amy&quot; was canceled by CBS on May 18, 2005. In the United States, repeats aired on TNT from 2003 until 2007. On July 17, 2011, UP (the former Gospel Music Channel) began airing the series daily, albeit with content and episode edits (including episode removals) to conform to the network&#x27;s programming direction and ownership. Since February 2016 it has aired more intermittently on the network, mainly in the form of all-day marathons (episode removals have been relaxed under a more secular programming direction that included fellow Connecticut-set series &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; being added to UP&#x27;s schedule).

&quot;Judging Amy&quot; is broadcast in Australia on channels ELEVEN and 111 Hits and in New Zealand on Sky Open (formerly Prime). In Canada, the show aired on channel Séries+ and, beginning in September 2017, in French with described video on AMI-télé. Ireland&#x27;s TV3 carried the show, as did UK stations Living TV, Hallmark, Channel 4, and CBS Drama, Israel&#x27;s YES Base Channel also carries the show.

==Reception==

===Critical===

Several reviewers have suggested the show took inspiration from the formula established by &quot;Providence&quot;. Reviewers also cite the relationship between Brenneman and Daly&#x27;s characters as the selling point of the show. Also likely is the physical similarities at the time between Brenneman and the lead actress in &quot;Providence&quot;, Melina Kanakaredes.

Amy Gray makes reference to &quot;Providence&quot; in episode 3.18, &quot;The Justice League of America&quot;. In this episode, Amy is attending her Harvard Law School class&#x27; tenth reunion, and her old friends cannot seem to remember Amy has moved to Hartford. They think she resides in Providence. Finally, Amy is pushed to state, &quot;It&#x27;s Hartford, David. Providence is a whole other universe.&quot;

<text>The Hugo Boss Prize was an award given every other year to an artist (or group of artists) working in any medium, anywhere in the world. Upon its establishment in 1996, it distinguished itself from other art awards because it has no restrictions on nationality or age. The prize was administered by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and sponsored by the Hugo Boss clothing company, which since 1995 has been sponsoring various exhibitions and activities at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. It included a cash award of US$100,000 and a tetrahedral trophy.

A jury of five to six curators, critics, and scholars was responsible for the selection of the artists. They nominated six or seven artists for the shortlist; several months later, they chose the winner of the prize. In the prize&#x27;s early years, most nominated artists were little known. In 1996 and 1998, the nominated artists exhibited their work at the now-defunct Guggenheim Soho, where a space on the second floor was named the Hugo Boss Gallery in 1996; since 2000, only the winning artist has shown his or her work. The Guggenheim Foundation discontinued the prize in 2022.

<text>Hippolyte or Hipólito Bouchard (15 January 1780 – 4 January 1837), known in California as Pirata Buchar, was a French-born Argentine sailor and corsair (pirate) who fought for Argentina, Chile, and Peru.

During his first campaign as an Argentine corsair he attacked the Spanish colonies of Chile and Peru, under the command of the Irish-Argentine Admiral William Brown. During his overseas voyage he blockaded the port of Manila, Philippines. In Hawaii, he recovered an Argentine privateer which had been seized by mutineers. He also met the local ruler, King Kamehameha I. His forces occupied Monterey, California, then a Spanish colony, raised the Argentine flag and held the town for six days. After raiding Monterey, he plundered Mission San Juan Capistrano in Southern California. Toward the end of the voyage Bouchard raided Spanish ports in Central America. His second homeland remembers him as a hero and patriot; several places are named in his honour.

==Early life==
Bouchard was born in a small village close to Saint-Tropez, Bormes-les-Mimosas, on the &quot;Côte d&#x27;Azur&quot; (French Riviera) in 1780 The son of André Louis Bouchard and Thérèse Brunet was baptized as André Paul but eventually went by the name Hippolyte. He initially worked in the French merchant fleet, then served in the French Navy in their campaigns against the English, thus starting his life at sea. After many campaigns including the French Campaign in Egypt by the future Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and the Saint-Domingue expedition, disillusioned with the direction of the French Revolution, Bouchard went to Argentina in 1809 and, to aid the May Revolution, became a part of the National Argentine Fleet, led by Azopardo. On 2 March 1811 he fought for the first time under the Argentine Flag when the Spanish Captain Jacinto de Romarate defeated the first Argentine flotilla at San Nicolás de los Arroyos, and in July and August of that year he played a major role in defending the City of Buenos Aires from a Spanish blockade. In March 1812 Bouchard joined the Mounted Grenadiers Regiment led by José de San Martín and took part in the Battle of San Lorenzo in 1813, where he captured a Spanish flag and therefore was granted Argentine citizenship. Some months later he married Norberta Merlo.

==Campaign with William Brown==
In 1815 Bouchard started a naval campaign under the command of Admiral William Brown, wherein he attacked the fortress of El Callao and the Ecuadorian city of Guayaquil. On 12 September 1815 he was granted a corsair license to fight the Spanish aboard the French-built corvette &quot;Halcón&quot;, which had been bought for the Argentine State by Vicente Anastacio Echeverría. Most of the officers were French, except for the second commander, the Englishman Robert Jones, and Ramón Freire. Before weighing anchor a conflict between Bouchard and his superiors arose when the expedition&#x27;s agent, Severino Prudant, promoted several sailors. intervened and settled the conflict.

The campaign fleet was composed of the frigate &quot;Hercules&quot; under the command of William Brown, the &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; under the command of his brother, Miguel Brown, the schooner &quot;Constitución&quot; under the command of Oliverio Russell, and the &quot;Halcón&quot;. The &quot;Hércules&quot; and &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; set sail from Montevideo on 24 October; the other two ships departed five days later. The plan was for all four ships to rendezvous at Mocha Island where they would establish a plan of operation. The Brown brothers arrived at the island on 28 December, with the &quot;Halcón&quot; arriving the following day. Upon arrival Bouchard announced that while circumnavigating Cape Horn his ship was exposed to fourteen days of severe weather, and it was on that basis that he had concluded that the &quot;Constitución&quot; had sunk (neither the ship nor its crew were ever seen again). On 31 December Brown and Bouchard agreed to operate together during the first hundred days of 1816. Any plunder would be divided as follows: two parts to Brown, as the commander-in-chief, and one-and-a-half parts each for the &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; and the &quot;Halcón&quot;. Bouchard and Miguel Brown subsequently set course for the Peruvian coast, while the &quot;Hércules&quot; sailed to the Juan Fernández Islands in order to free a number of patriots that were being held prisoner there.

On 10 January 1816 the three vessels met again near the fortress of El Callao. The ships formed a blockade and bombarded Guayaquil and its nearby fortification. The following day the group seized the brigantine &quot;San Pablo&quot;, which was used to transport sick and injured sailors as well as the liberated prisoners. On the 13th the frigate &quot;Gobernadora&quot; was captured, and Lt. Colonel Vicente Banegas, officer of the Republican Army of Nueva Granada, joined the fleet. Four more ships were commandeered on the 18th, including the schooner &quot;Carmen&quot; and the brig &quot;Místico&quot; along with two other ships, one of which was sacked and sunk. On 21 January the Argentine fleet again attacked the fortress, sinking the frigate &quot;Fuente Hermosa&quot; in the process. Seven days later two more vessels were captured, the frigates &quot;Candelaria&quot; and &quot;Consecuencia&quot;. The next day the expanded fleet sailed north in search of the Guayas River. On 7 February the Argentine contingent arrived at Puná Island, near Guayaquil. As they arrived, William Brown ordered Bouchard and his brother to stay close to the seven ships they had captured. Brown took the command of the &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot;, with which he wanted to attack Guayaquil. The next day his attack demolished the fort of Punta de Piedras, located some five leagues from Guayaquil. However, on 9 February Brown failed in his attempt to take the castle of San Carlos, and was instead captured by the royalist forces. After a long negotiation, the Argentine corsairs traded Brown for the &quot;Candelaria&quot;, three brigantines and five correspondence chests that had been taken from the &quot;Consecuencia&quot;.

After three days, Bouchard informed Brown that his ship was close to sinking and that the officers wished to return to Buenos Aires. He then asked for a division of the booty, and received the &quot;Consecuencia&quot;, the &quot;Carmen&quot;, and 3,475 pesos as compensation (he had to leave the &quot;Halcón&quot; behind). Bouchard elected to return to Buenos Aires via Cape Horn, and it was there that new incidents with the crew arose, many of which were solved with violence, such as a duel with one of his sergeants. When an officer on the &quot;Carmen&quot; notified Bouchard that the ship was in imminent danger of foundering, Bouchard nonetheless ordered the man to continue the journey. As a result, the crew mutinied and headed to the Galápagos Islands. The &quot;Consecuencia&quot;, with Bouchard still in command, made port in Buenos Aires on 18 June.

==Campaign with &quot;La Argentina&quot;==

===The beginning of the campaign===
Bouchard decided to stay with the frigate &quot;Consecuencia&quot; for his next campaign. In concert with Vicente Echevarría the ship&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;La Argentina&quot;. Preparing the ship was not an easy task, as it was very heavy and some long. acquired 34 artillery pieces and hired experienced carpenters to mount them in place. Upon Bouchard&#x27;s request, the Argentine State gave him 4 bronze cannons and 12 iron cannons, 128 guns, and 1,700 cannonballs, but he was unable to requisition small arms such as boarding guns or sabers (even cavalry sabers). Even more difficult was finding the 180 men he needed for a crew, especially given Bouchard&#x27;s reputation as ill-tempered (which dogged him after the conflicts in the Pacific). Most of the sailors he did enlist were foreigners, though some were from the provinces of Corrientes and Entre Ríos.

On 25 June, with &quot;La Argentina&quot; still in port, a sailor struck one of his superiors, an act of insubordination. When Bouchard discovered this he ordered the sailor&#x27;s arrest, provoking general unrest. One of the fellow sailors attacked Commander Sommers, who killed him in self-defense. This did not prevent other members of the crew from barricading themselves inside the ship, which led to their being forcibly removed by the marine infantry, led by Sommers. Two crewmen were killed in the conflict, and four others were wounded. Following the altercation Echevarría sent a letter to Supreme Director Juan Martín de Pueyrredón explaining that the incident was the result of the crew having been stuck in Buenos Aires for an extended period, and that chances of further outbreaks would be lessened once the ship put to sea. Two days later &quot;La Argentina&quot; headed to Ensenada de Barragán, which started rumors flying that Bouchard had deserted the service. In reality, the frigate disembarked under the authority of a general order which required that ships that were subjected to loading delays and such but were otherwise seaworthy leave the harbor in order that they not be caught at anchor should the Spanish attempt an invasion.

On 27 June Bouchard obtained the Argentine corsair patent (a &quot;letter of marque&quot;) that authorized him to prey on Spanish commerce, the countries of Spain and Argentina being in a state of war at the time.
On 9 July 1817 (the first anniversary of the signing of the Argentine Declaration of Independence) Bouchard set out from Ensenada de Barragán in command of &quot;La Argentina&quot; on a two-year voyage, intending to travel across the Atlantic to the African coast in order to circumnavigate around the Cape of Good Hope and engage a fleet of ships operated by the Company of the Philippines that had sailed from Spain to India. However, a fire broke out on 19 July which the crew had to fight for hours until it was extinguished. Consequently, when the ship subsequently arrived in the Indian Ocean it headed northeast to Madagascar, where it laid up at Tamatave (on the east of the island) for a period of two months while repairs were effected. Once in Tamatave, a British officer requested Bouchard&#x27;s assistance in preventing four slave ships (three British and one French) from leaving the island, whereupon Bouchard offered the use of all his available troops. The &quot;La Argentina&quot; seized the ships&#x27; food supplies and recruited five French sailors prior to departing Madagascar with the intent of launching attacks on Spanish merchant shipping in the region. Much of the crew was soon afflicted with scurvy, which required that ship&#x27;s operations be conducted by those few sailors who had escaped illness. On 18 October &quot;La Argentina&quot; encountered an United States Navy frigate that passed on the news that the Company of the Philippines had ended trade with India three years prior.

===The Pirates===

&quot;La Argentina&quot; headed toward the Philippines, weathering several storms in the Sunda Strait (that divides the islands of Java and Sumatra, and connects the Java Sea with the Indian Ocean) along the way. On 7 November Bouchard decided to land at Java in order to let his sick crew members recuperate. After leaving the island, &quot;La Argentina&quot; continued on its journey to the Philippines. Traveling through the region was fraught with danger due to the presence of Malayan pirates, and was compounded by the crew&#x27;s weakened condition. The pirate ships were equipped with cannons in the prow and in the stern, and were outfitted with one mast and many oars. The &quot;Lanun&quot; as they were known to the Malay people were not seen until the morning of 7 December, when the watchman sighted four small ships. Combat was delayed until midday when the largest of the pirate vessels attempted to close in on &quot;La Argentina&quot;. It arrived towing a boat of the frigate that had visited him in search of provisions. 
As Bouchard preferred to instigate boarding actions and relied on hand-to-hand combat he therefore chose to forgo firing upon the aggressor. &quot;La Argentina&#x27;s&quot; crew prevailed and were ordered to take the ship; in the meantime, the other would-be attackers fled. Bouchard convened a &quot;war council&quot; to judge the prisoners, sentencing all of them to death, save for the youngest. The condemned prisoners were returned to their ship and locked below the deck; the damaged vessel was subjected to salvo after salvo of cannon fire from &quot;La Argentina&quot; until she sank with all hands aboard.

===The Sulu Islands===
After passing through the Makassar Strait, &quot;La Argentina&quot; crossed the Celebes Sea and made landfall on the island of Joló. Bouchard arrived in the archipelago on January 2, 1818, and remained there for five days. Large numbers of underwater rocks and strong currents made navigation difficult in these seas. Its inhabitants considered valor as the first of the virtues and always boasted of being invincible. His whole life was based on piracy that regulated his economy, his military forces and his social life. While the frigate&#x27;s crew was negotiating with the natives to secure adequate supplies, sentries were stationed, loaded with muskets, to repel any possible attack by the Joloans. At night a sentry perceived movements and cautiously alerted the whole crew.
When they confirmed that the boats dangerously lurked to the frigate, all the men prepared their arms and when being at a distance of a hundred yards the order was given to open fire.
The Joloans were surprised and quickly fled. After a series of incidents finally the monarch appeared with a richly adorned boat. It brought with it a great quantity of fruits and vegetables, besides four buffaloes for the hungry sailors.
From that moment they were able to complete the watering without being disturbed and the islanders were allowed to trade freely with the crew of the frigate.

===The Philippines===

Then headed to the Spanish port at Manila for the purpose of establishing a blockade. Upon arrival on 31 January 1818 the Argentines stopped an English frigate attempting to dock to determine whether or not it carried supplies for the Spanish colony. Bouchard attempted to hide his origin, but the frigate&#x27;s captain discerned what his true intentions were and warned the Spanish authorities of his intentions. The City of Manila had fortified walls and was protected by a redoubt, Fort Santiago, with powerful artillery. Bouchard instead began to plunder nearby vessels, all the while staying clear of the Spanish cannons. For the next two months &quot;La Argentina&quot; captured a total of 16 ships through the use of intimidating cannon fire and quick boardings. To further tighten the siege over the capital of the archipelago, Bouchard arranged for an armed Pontin with 23 crew members to block the strait of San Bernardino under the command of second captain Sommers. In that action they captured a felluca and a galley. While Manila&#x27;s inhabitants fell into a state of despair as the price of food doubled, and even tripled. The governor sent two armed merchant vessels, accompanied by a corvette, to engage &quot;La Argentina&quot;. The group missed its opportunity, however, as Bouchard had already departed the area on 30 March.

Few days after, the ship sighted a brigantine from the Mariana Islands. When it noticed the proximity of &quot;La Argentina&quot;, it fled to the port of Santa Cruz.
The Argentine frigate was unable to approach the harbor because of its draft, so Bouchard ordered Sommers, Greissac and Van Buren to use three boats to capture the ship. The three officers and many crew members started to approach the brigantine that had not arrived to the port. Owing to the speed of his boat, Sommers went ahead and managed to reach the brigantine. But the cutter leading to Sommers was overturned by the crew of the brig that threw moorings to their masts. From the deck of the brig, they attacked the defenseless men in the water, killing fourteen. The others were rescued by Greissac and Van Buren and returned to the frigate.
Bouchard wanted to revenge the deaths, but in order to capture the brigantine he needed a vessel with a smaller stern. So he ordered Greissac to lead some sailors and take any of the schooners that sailed near the port. Once captured, Bouchard put a number of cannons in her. He placed Greissac and Oliver in command of her with 35 sailors. The schooner attacked on 10 April but the brigantine&#x27;s crew had fled. Continuing their navigation, they reached the northern end of the island and captured a pontoon that carried the Royal &quot;Situado&quot; to the islands Batanes. 
However, because of the strong winds it was possible to send only an officer and eight sailors to sail the vessel. The schooner was in sight until 15 April, possibly the insubordination was caused by the value of the shipment. &quot;La Argentina&quot; traveled to the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii) to find new crew members to replace those who had died from scurvy. Bouchard hired Peter Corney to captain the &quot;Santa Rosa&quot;, a captured ship whose crew had mutinied. Filomeno V. Aguilar Jr. in his paper: “Manilamen and seafaring: engaging the maritime world beyond the Spanish realm”, stated that his second ship, the Santa Rosa had a multi-ethnic crew which included Filipinos. Mercene, writer of the Book “Manila Men”, proposes that those Manilamen were recruited in San Blas, an alternative port to Acapulco Mexico where several Filipinos had settled during the Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade era. The Filipinos who settled in San Blas were escapees from Spanish slavery in the Manila Galleons, upon meeting Hippolyte Bouchard who worked for the Argentinians that revolted against Spain, the common grievance the Filipinos shared against the Spaniards, which they shared with the Argentines caused them to mutiny and join the rebel Argentines.

===Sandwich Islands (Hawaii)===

On 17 August Bouchard arrived at Kealakekua Bay on the western coast of the island of Hawaii. A group of natives came close to the ship in a canoe and informed them, in English, that a corvette, which used to be Spanish but had been sold to King Kamehameha I, was also at anchor in the harbor. They also told them that, on the previous night, a frigate had departed.
Bouchard decided to chase the frigate, which they found becalmed. He ordered Sheppard to take a rowboat to ask the frigate&#x27;s commander for information about the ship in the Hawaiian harbor. Sheppard found out that it was the &quot;Santa Rosa&quot; or the &quot;Chacabuco&quot;, a corvette that had weighed anchor at Buenos Aires almost the same day the &quot;La Argentina&quot; had. The crew of &quot;Santa Rosa&quot; had mutinied near Chile&#x27;s coast and headed to Hawaii, where the crew had attempted to sell the vessel to the Hawaiian king.
The French privateer forced the frigate to return to the harbor, because he suspected that among its crew were hiding some of the mutineers. While investigating the men he found nine men he had seen in Buenos Aires and punished them. After an interrogation he found out the revolt&#x27;s leaders were hiding in Kauai Island.

When he arrived at the harbor he found the &quot;Santa Rosa&quot; almost dismantled, therefore he decided to meet King Kamehameha I wearing his uniform of Lieutenant Colonel of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. During the meeting Bouchard demanded the restitution of the corvette. However, the king argued he had paid 600 hundredweight of sandalwood for her and that he deserved a compensation. Bouchard traded his sword and commanders hat, along with an honorific title of Lieutenant Colonel of the United Provinces. Argentine historian, author and 6th President of Argentina Bartolomé Mitre wrote of this agreement as the first &quot;international treaty&quot; signed by Argentina with a non-Latin American country, an interpretation dismissed by later historians. Historian Pacho O&#x27;Donnell affirms that Hawaii was the first state that recognized Argentina&#x27;s independence.
After the negotiation, Bouchard returned to the Bay of Kealekekua, conditioned the Santa Rosa and waited for the king to send him the agreed provisions. As this did not occur he went with his warships to rejoin the monarch at his residence in Kailua.
For the risk involved two warships in his capital, Kamehameha indicated that it could be provisioned in Maui
After obtaining supplies in Maui he went to Oahu, arriving in Honolulu, where he met Francisco de Paula y Marín, who was appointed representative of the United Provinces of South America and captain of the armies.
He also recruited Peter Corney, who put in charge of the corvette Santa Rosa.
On 26 August he took charge of the &quot;Santa Rosa&quot;, which he had to rebuild partially. Six days later he arrived to Kauai island. There he captured those who had mutinied in the &quot;Santa Rosa&quot;, executed the leaders and punishing the rest with twelve blows with a lash in the face. After buying food, ammunition and hiring eighty men, the fleet left, heading to California.

===California and Central America===
Bouchard sailed towards California to exploit the Spanish trade. However the Spanish authorities knew his intentions since on 6 October the &quot;Clarion&quot; had reported two corsair ships were ready to attack the Californian coast. The governor, Pablo Vicente de Solá, who resided in Monterey, ordered removed from the city all valuables and two thirds of the gunpowder stocked in the military outposts.

On 20 November 1818, the watchman of Punta de Pinos, located at the tip of the southern end of Monterey Bay, sighted the two Argentine ships. The governor was informed; the Spanish prepared the cannons along the coastline, the garrison manned their battle stations, and the women, children, and men unfit to fight were sent to an inland mission at Soledad.

Bouchard met with his officers to design the attack plan. Peter Corney knew the bay from two previous visits to Monterey. They used the corvette &quot;Santa Rosa&quot; to attack since the deep draft frigate &quot;La Argentina&quot; might run aground. The frigate had to be towed by small boats and out of range of the Spanish artillery. Once it was out of range, Bouchard sent captain Sheppard to the &quot;Santa Rosa&quot;, leading two hundred soldiers, carrying firearms and lances.

&quot;Santa Rosa&quot; corvette, led by Sheppard, anchored by midnight near the Presidio of Monterey. Since, after towing the frigate and rowing back to the corvette the men were very tired, Sheppard decided not to attack in the night. At dawn he discovered that he had anchored too close to the coast and that few meters ahead the Spanish artillery was ready to attack them. The captain opened fire, but after fifteen minutes of combat the corvette surrendered.

From the frigate, Bouchard saw his men defeated, but also noticed that the Spanish lacked boats to seize &quot;Santa Rosa&quot;. The corsair ordered his ships to weigh anchor and move towards the port. However, due to the frigate&#x27;s draft, he could not get close enough to open fire. After sunset they brought the corvette&#x27;s survivors aboard the frigate.
On 24 November, before dawn, Bouchard ordered his men to board the boats. They were 200: 130 had rifles and 70 had spears. They landed away from the fort in a hidden creek. The fort defended by José Bandini resisted ineffectively, and after an hour of combat the Argentine flag flew over it. The Argentines took the city for six days, during which time they stole the cattle and burned the fort, the artillery headquarters, the governor&#x27;s residence and the Spanish houses. The town&#x27;s residents were unharmed.

On 29 November they left Monterey, passed Point Conception, and anchored off of Refugio Canyon, about twenty miles west of Santa Barbara, where they went to the hacienda of the Ortega family rancho. Bouchard was told the family had strongly supported the Spanish cause. On 5 December the Argentines disembarked near the farm and, meeting no resistance, took all the food, killed the cattle, and slit the throats of the saddle horses in the corrals. A small squadron of cavalry, sent by José de la Guerra y Noriega from the Santa Barbara Presidio, waited quietly nearby for an opportunity to capture some stragglers. They captured an officer and two sailors, whom they brought back to the Presidio in chains. Bouchard waited for them the whole day, because he thought they were lost, until he decided to burn the farm and go to Mission Santa Barbara, where the three men could have been taken as prisoners. Once he arrived at Santa Bárbara, and seeing the town was heavily defended (in reality, what Bouchard saw through his spyglass was the same small troop of cavalry, which stopped and changed costume each time it passed behind a heavy clump of brush), the privateer sent a messenger to speak to the governor. After the negotiation the three captured men returned to the &quot;Santa Rosa&quot; and Bouchard freed one prisoner.

On 16 December the ships weighed anchor and headed to San Juan Capistrano. There he requested food and ammunition; a Spanish officer said &quot;he had enough gunpowder and cannonballs for me&quot;. Threats annoyed Bouchard; he sent one hundred men to take the town. After a short fight the corsairs took some valuables and burned the Spanish houses. On 20 December he left for Vizcaíno Bay, where he repaired the ships and allowed his men to rest.
Among the Spanish settlements in California the raids earned Bouchard a reputation as &quot;California&#x27;s only pirate&quot; (and was therefore often referred to as &quot;Pirata Buchar&quot; by the Spanish colonists of the day). To avoid an attack from Bouchard like the one he successfully launched against San Juan Capistrano, San Buenaventura moved all of its herd and valuables inland.

On 17 January they sailed to the port of San Blas, located on the west coast of mainland Mexico, and began a blockade eight days later. During the approach, they seized the Spanish brig &quot;Las Ánimas&quot;, with a cargo of cacao. Near Tres Marías islands, &quot;La Argentina&quot; boarded the British &quot;Good Hope&quot;. After four days, they allowed the ship to weigh anchor, but not before confiscating her cargo of Spanish goods. On 1 March, while blockading San Blas, they sighted a schooner. The two ships began to chase her but failed to reach her. Afterwards, Bouchard ordered them to proceed south to Acapulco following the coastline. Once they arrived, he sent a boat with an officer to explore the place, and to report the quantity and quality of the ships in the harbour. The officer reported there was no relevant ship nearby, and Bouchard decided to sail on.

On 18 March the Argentines went to a town called Sonsonate in El Salvador. An officer sent to spy on the port reported there were reasonable ships to board. On that day Bouchard captured a brigantine. On 2 April they arrived at the port of El Realejo, and prepared two boats with cannons and sixty men, led by Bouchard himself. They were sighted by the port&#x27;s watch, however, and Spanish troops went to defend the ships. In addition, they had protected the port with four ships: a brig, two schooners and a lugger. After an intense combat three ships were taken. Bouchard burned the brig &quot;San Antonio&quot; and the schooner &quot;Lauretana&quot;, because their owners had not offered enough money for them, 30,000 and 20,000 duros respectively. Owing to their quality he kept the lugger, &quot;Neptuno&quot;, and the second schooner, &quot;María Sofía&quot;.

After the combat in El Realejo, the Argentines found the same schooner with the Spanish flag that they had lost in San Blas. The ship went forward towards the &quot;Santa Rosa&quot;, whose crew was composed of inexpert Hawaiian sailors and had few artillery. A first attack killed three Argentines and wounded many more. When the Argentine ship was going to repel the enemy&#x27;s boarding, the schooner took out the Spanish flag and showed it was a Chilean ship, called &quot;Chileno&quot; (Chilean). It was commanded by a corsair whose surname was Croll. Bouchard demanded that his surgeon heal the wounded, but the Chilean corsair decided to go away.

On 3 April 1819 Hippolyte Bouchard&#x27;s long expedition ended. He went to Valparaíso, in Chile in order to collaborate with José de San Martín&#x27;s campaign to liberate Peru. Some historians, for example Miguel Ángel de Marco, suggest that the flags of the United Provinces of Central America and most of the states that composed it were inspired by the Argentine Flag that Bouchard took with him. While others claim that the flag was modeled on the Argentine flag, but introduced by Commodore Louis-Michel Aury.

=== Arrest in Chile ===

On 9 July 1819, exactly two years after Bouchard left Buenos Aires, the &quot;Santa Rosa&quot; and the &quot;María Sofía&quot; arrived to Valparaíso. the 12th of the same month arrived the &quot;Neptuno&quot; and one day later arrived &quot;La Argentina&quot;. Bouchard was informed that Thomas Cochrane had ordered his arrest. The corsair replied that the Chilean government had no authority to judge him and that he would only speak about his travels to the Argentine authority.
The trial for piracy started on 20 July. In September a Chilean fleet had left to Peru to try to take El Callao fortress. In order to put pressure on the court, Argentine Colonel Mariano Necochea along with 30 Mounted Grenadiers and sailors stormed &quot;La Argentina&quot; and took control of the ship in the name of the United Provinces. Then, the corsair&#x27;s defense decided to accelerate the trial and the judge decided, on 9 December, to return all ships, papers and documents to Bouchard; however the money and the booty were not given back.
The ships had no sails nor cannons, because they had been requested by the Chilean navy. Bouchard, virtually in bankruptcy, used a schooner to deliver clay to Buenos Aires, and due to the poor future of his ships, he decided to change the name of &quot;La Argentina&quot; to &quot;Consecuencia&quot;, the name she had before being taken. They were used as transport ships: the &quot;Consecuencia&quot; carried 500 soldiers to Peru, while &quot;Santa Rosa&quot; took cattle and weapons.

== Later life ==

In 1820 Bouchard was in Peru serving with the Chilean navy. In December of that year he requested José de San Martín, who had been named Protector of Peru, to be allowed to return to Argentina due to his economic situation. San Martín ordered him to stay in Lima for four more months.

When Lord Cochrane took the money stored in the warships he commanded to compensate for the wages he did not receive, San Martín decided to fight against him. He created the Peruvian Navy and Bouchard was given the frigate &quot;Prueba&quot;, captured by the Royalists in Callao. Cochrane complained again and Tomás Guido asked him to protest to the Chilean government and ordered Bouchard to be ready to fight if the Scottish admiral decided to attack the Peruvian fleet. Bouchard confronted Cochrane at sea, to the point of challenging him to a single duel; however, the Chilean admiral refused to fight and sailed back to Valparaíso.

After the incident, Bouchard continued to sail in Peruvian waters commanding the &quot;Santa Rosa&quot;, because &quot;Consecuencia&quot; had to be sold as firewood. &quot;Santa Rosa&quot; would end up being burned during the El Callao rebellion of 1824. Bouchard would also participate, in 1828, in the war against Gran Colombia. After the death of the Admiral Martín Jorge Guise, he was in charge of the Peruvian Navy, but he would retire one year later, after the loss of the ensign ship, &quot;Presidente&quot;.

During his retirement Bouchard decided to live on the properties that had been given to him by the Peruvian Government, &quot;San Javier y San José de la Nazca&quot;, near Palpa. He established a sugar mill. Bouchard had lost contact with his family many years before: after the expedition with Brown he had lived with his wife for only ten months, and he never knew his younger daughter who was born after the beginning of his expedition around the world. He was killed by one of his servants on 4 January 1837.

==Legacy==
In his adopted country of Argentina, Bouchard is revered as a patriot and several places (one being a street in downtown Buenos Aires close to the waterfront) are named in his honor. USS &quot;Borie&quot;, an &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;-class destroyer sold to Argentina in July 1972, was renamed as ARA &quot;Hipólito Bouchard&quot;; the ship saw action in the Falklands War.

<text>Branciforte, originally named Villa de Branciforte, was the last of only three secular &quot;pueblos&quot; founded by the Spanish colonial government of Alta California. The pueblo was established in 1797 on the eastern bluff of the San Lorenzo River, facing Mission Santa Cruz on the west side of the river, in modern-day Santa Cruz, California. The pueblo never prospered, and the area was annexed into the city of Santa Cruz, California in 1905.

The present day Branciforte Small Schools Campus (BSSC) building is located at what was the center of the Villa de Branciforte. A California State historical marker, number 469, is located outside of the building, too, at the corner of Water Street and Branciforte Avenue.

==History==
Villa de Branciforte was founded under the direction of California Governor Diego de Borica in memory of a Viceroy of New Spain, Miguel de la Grúa Talamanca, 1st Marquis of Branciforte, and was founded as part of Spain&#x27;s strategy to protect upper California against other European countries such as Russia, England, and France. Its original civilian population was not bound to the church or the military. Unlike the Spanish missions, the villa was secular.

In 1781, Governor Felipe de Neve had issued rules regarding governance of secular pueblos (only two at that time; San José and Los Ángeles), the &quot;Regulations for the Government of the Province of the Californias&quot; (&quot;Reglamento para el gobierno de la provincia de Californias&quot;). Those rules included locally elected officials (subject to approval by the governor): the &quot;alcalde&quot; (combined mayor and judge), the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; (town council), the &quot;juez de paz&quot; (justice of the peace), and others.

From its very inception in 1797 the Villa met with great obstacles. The funds were not adequate, and the enterprise failed to attract any retired soldiers. In their stead, a motley group of convicts who were banished from New Spain formed the initial group of colonists, and although the missionaries at Mission Santa Cruz protested bitterly against this pueblo being situated so close to their domain, the town received official backing.

The first eight settlers came from Guadalajara, Jalisco, New Spain (Spanish colonial Mexico). They found nothing of what they had been promised. Expecting to find the town already built to accommodate them, they found they had to build their own rough dwellings with little tools or provisions. In the end the Villa de Branciforte never resembled the neatly laid out plans for streets and buildings its planners envisioned. Furthermore, it never lived up to its expectations, and in 1802, the town itself lost the support of the Crown, and supplies ceased to arrive.

In 1803, about five years after the villa was established the settlers attempted to establish a government by electing an alcalde or municipal magistrate. This election was one of the first elections ever held in Alta California. After this, the citizens of the Villa de Branciforte began to spread over the country.

Ever since the first days, many of its residents, whom the narratives and chronicles denounce as &quot;lazy&quot; and prone to vices and crime, decided to move to other, more prosperous settlements like the Pueblo of San José. There were also constant problems with the missionaries at the adjacent Mission Santa Cruz over grazing rights, and the corrupting influence of the settlers on the s at the Mission. For the first few years the population actually declined.

In 1818, when the pirate Hippolyte de Bouchard threatened to attack the California coast in support of the independence struggles raging in the Americas, the residents of Branciforte were reluctantly called upon to defend the Mission against sacking while the padres and neophytes took flight to other Missions further inland. When Bouchard arrived, he did not sack Santa Cruz but instead it was the residents of Branciforte who looted and stole from the mission even the clothes from the saints adorning the church. The missionaries and neophytes came back to find the whole place ransacked, but it was soon discovered who the culprits had really been. This event deepened the mistrust both the communities held for each other.

By 1831 however, Branciforte had a population of about two hundred people which was mostly made up of merchants, explorers, and retired soldiers.

The Branciforte Adobe is the only remaining building of Branciforte itself. There are three other period adobes in Santa Cruz County.

<doc id="657554" wikidata="Q7414701" url="?curid=657554" title="San Lorenzo River">
<text>The San Lorenzo River () is a river in the U.S. state of California. The name San Lorenzo derives from the Spanish language for &quot;Saint Lawrence&quot; due to its reported sighting on that saint&#x27;s feast day by Spanish explorers. Its headwaters originate in Castle Rock State Park in the Santa Cruz Mountains and flow south by southeast through the San Lorenzo Valley before passing through Santa Cruz and emptying into Monterey Bay and the Pacific Ocean.

==Watershed and course==
The San Lorenzo begins as an intermittent stream around the precipitous slopes of Castle Rock Ridge, a major divide separating drainages of the San Francisco Bay area and the Pacific Ocean, in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Its headwaters is about 1 mile upstream of Castle Rock State Park on private property just south of the Saratoga Gap. Once inside the park&#x27;s boundary, the perennial river flows approximately 1.5 miles before leaving the unit. Within state park boundaries, Craig Springs Creek, Tin Can Creek, and several small unnamed tributaries empty into the river.

With its headwaters at an elevation of approximately above sea level, the San Lorenzo River drops in the first 3 miles. Starting just south of the Saratoga Toll Road Trail, the river is roughly paralleled by State Route 9 until it enters downtown Boulder Creek. The San Lorenzo reaches about above Boulder Creek and about from the mouth of the river. At this elevation, it is joined by Kings Creek from the left in the neighborhood of Redwood Grove, and Spring Creek from the right shortly thereafter. Small, steep tributaries feed the river from the west at Ben Lomond Mountain, while wider, more gently sloping tributaries feed the river from the east and northwest.

The San Lorenzo River watershed drains . The Branciforte Creek watershed is a major sub-basin of the San Lorenzo catchment-basin. The Newell Creek tributary was dammed to create Loch Lomond, a reservoir which supplies drinking water to Santa Cruz, California.

==Discharge==

The upper San Lorenzo generally receives more rainfall during the winter and early spring compared to the lower basin, discharging a higher than usual flow into the river mouth in Santa Cruz. Tributaries in the lower San Lorenzo are prone to atmospheric-river-caused floods, with these storms contributing to large volumes of run-off.

==Geology==
As recently as the Paleogene period about 65 million years ago, much of California was still part of the Pacific Ocean. The San Lorenzo Valley was at the bottom of a shallow, tropical sea. Tectonic forces and faulting processes pushed up this flat ocean bottom into an ancient mountain range between 50 and 35 million years ago before sinking back into the shallow sea where it was covered with more sediments. About 30 to 25 million years ago, the Pacific Plate and North American Plate changed course and began moving sideways, creating a fault block called the Salinian Block. A second ancient mountain range began to rise during the Miocene, between 15 and 5 million years ago, which eroded and dropped back into the ocean, compressing sand and creating the Santa Margarita sandstone formation. Sediment deposits were laid during this event and epoch, about 10 million years ago, to create the three main rock types found within the San Lorenzo River basin: silt and clay became the layer of Monterey shale; the Santa Margarita sandstone; and as the sea deepened, the deposits became mud, forming the Santa Cruz mudstone layer.

Tectonic forces from the convergence of the Pacific Plate with the North American Plate uplifted the land for a third time along the San Andreas Fault, pushing up the Santa Cruz Mountains between 3 and 4 million years ago. This tectonic compression caused uplift exposing older, predominately marine, Cenozoic sedimentary rocks to weathering, surface erosion, mass wasting, and landslides. The stream valleys and drainage networks of the San Lorenzo River watershed formed through the surface erosion and mass wasting of these sedimentary rocks during the end of the last Ice Age. Geologic erosion from these natural processes line most of the watershed&#x27;s stream valleys.

The Ben Lomond Fault is a subsidiary bedrock fracture within the San Andreas fault system, which had significant east–west vertical movement. The fault skirts the east and north sides of Ben Lomond Mountain, and is the fracture along which the Ben Lomond Mountain block was tilted up. Uplift of the southwestern block, which began about 40 million years ago, caused a vertical separation of approximately within the past 12 million years. Deformed rocks of late Cenozoic age indicate a continuation of faulting until about 85,000 years ago. As the Santa Cruz Mountains continued to rise, the San Lorenzo took advantage of rock that was fractured and weakened by faulting processes and began to cut the deeply incised San Lorenzo Valley. The river runs in or near the western edge, and sub-parallel, to the fault.

Underlying rock strata in the San Lorenzo River basin include Lompico Sandstone and Vaqueros Sandstone.

==History==
The first humans of the San Lorenzo River basin were the Ohlone, who first arrived in the Santa Cruz area about 10,000 years ago. These inhabitants led a generally nomadic lifestyle, gathering plants and hunting small animals. The Achistaca, an Awaswas Ohlone people, were located near present-day Boulder Creek and Riverside Grove of the upper San Lorenzo River area.

During the 16th century, the Spanish began to explore and colonize western North America. It is possible that Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was the first European to see the San Lorenzo River when in 1542 he sailed the coast of California and stopped in Monterey Bay. Sebastian Vizcaino&#x27;s 1602-1604 expedition was to further explore the coast and resulted in several detailed maps of the coast, with potential ports for Spain to develop. Beginning in the 18th century, contact with Europeans brought significant changes to the lifestyles of Native Americans in the San Lorenzo River basin. Missionaries sought to convert indigenous peoples to Christianity.

The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portolà expedition, gave the river its name when it passed through the area on its way north, camping near the west bank on October 17, 1769. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi, traveling with the expedition, noted in his diary that, &quot;Not far from the sea we came to a large river...It is one of the 
largest that we have met with on the journey...This river was named San Lorenzo.&quot; &quot;Not far from the sea&quot; indicates that the party probably crossed the river at one of what later became the commonly used fords. The fords, in turn, became the locations for the first two bridges across the river – at today&#x27;s Water Street and Soquel Avenue.

In 1863, the California Powder Works was built adjacent to the river three miles upstream from Santa Cruz. The powder works made gunpowder for California mining after normal supplies had been interrupted by the American Civil War. Upstream from the works, a dam was constructed (in what is now Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park) to raise the water level enough to flow into a 1200-foot-long tunnel, dug through a granite ridge to convey water to a raised flume that, with a 60-foot drop, provided water power for the powder mill machinery. During dry summer weather when the river was low, the total river flow might be diverted into the flume from below the dam. The powder mill was closed in 1914 and the dam demolished.

==Ecology==
The basin is an international hotspot of biodiversity because of the unique habitats and ecosystems of the Santa Cruz Mountains.

The San Lorenzo River and its tributaries nourish corridors of riparian growth as they traverse the mountainous regions of the watershed. The plant community of white alder riparian forest intergrades with upland redwood forest in moister locations and mixed evergreen forest in drier situations. Large western sycamore, black cottonwood, white alder, and California box-elder trees dominate the canopy and offer cooling shade for river inhabitants. The arroyo willow forms a subcanopy and stabilizes the river&#x27;s banks. Common understory species include five-finger fern, coastal wood fern, small-leaved montia, scarlet monkey flower, and skunkweed.

===Fish migration===
The San Lorenzo supports several species of anadromous fish that migrate between the Pacific Ocean and freshwater tributaries of the river. Coho and Chinook salmon, &quot;humpback&quot; (pink salmon), &quot;dog&quot; (chum salmon), and steelhead trout, all of the genus &quot;Oncorhynchus&quot;, are ocean fish that migrate up the rivers at the end of their life cycles to spawn. Pacific lamprey, a semelparous fish, migrates between the ocean and the upstream habitat to breed.

Salmon and other fish populations declined dramatically after the establishment of water diversions, channelization, and dams that affect migration and rearing conditions. In 1960, it was estimated that there were more than 30,000 fish living in this river, but a decade later the population had been reduced to 1,000. Fishing regulations were changed in 1998 in order to protect wild stocks versus hatchery stocks. The changes in regulations have been minimally effective and additional conservation efforts are still needed.

Dams interrupt the migration of anadromous fish. Salmon and steelhead return to the streams in which they were born to spawn; where dams prevent their return, entire populations of fish die. Some of the San Lorenzo River dams employ fish ladders, which are effective to varying degrees at allowing these fish to travel upstream. Another problem exists for the juvenile salmon headed downstream to the ocean. With river currents slowed by the dams, the journey takes longer, which increases the mortality rate.

The San Lorenzo River was once one of the most popular steelhead trout and coho salmon rivers on the Central Coast of California. Approximately of the San Lorenzo River, and at least nine of its major tributaries, support steelhead. Historically, the San Lorenzo River supported the largest coho salmon and steelhead fishery south of San Francisco Bay, and the fourth largest steelhead fishery in the State of California.

In 1995, a survey of coho salmon south of San Francisco Bay found coho restricted to only one remnant population in Waddell Creek, one small naturalized (hatchery-influenced) population in Scott Creek and a small hatchery-maintained, non-native run in the San Lorenzo River, all in Santa Cruz County. Historically, coho were found in approximately 50 coastal drainages in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties, but by the 1960s spawning runs were limited to 11 stream systems. The 1995 combined average annual spawning population of native and naturalized coho salmon in Waddell and Scott Creeks was estimated at only 50-60 adults, and none in the San Lorenzo River, comprising only 1.5% of the estimated abundance of coho salmon south of San Francisco Bay in the early 1960s. Coho have returned as a result of stocking efforts at the Kingfisher Flat Hatchery on Scott Creek&#x27;s Big Creek tributary. Coho salmon had not been recorded in the San Lorenzo River watershed since the early 1980s, until 2005, when at least a dozen adult coho were observed at the city of Santa Cruz Felton diversion fish ladder. In recent decades, continued growth has raised demand for water from the entire watershed system bringing attention to the need for further preservation of stream flows in order to protect young salmon, steelhead, and lamprey. In 2014, coho captured from the lower river were transferred to the Big Creek hatchery to enable local genetics to be used for stocking.

===Environmental impacts===
Reduction in flow caused by dams, diversions (Felton and Tait), and evaporation losses from Loch Lomond Reservoir has had ecological consequences in the San Lorenzo River watershed and overall Santa Margarita Basin. Historically, the delta with its large freshwater outflow and salt marshes provided an important breeding ground for aquatic species in the Bay. Today&#x27;s desiccated delta no longer provides suitable habitat, and populations of fish in the bay have seen a dramatic decline.

Reduced flows have led to increases in the concentration of certain substances in the lower river that have impacted surface water quality. Nitrate impact from the more than 13,000 septic systems in the San Lorenzo River watershed is one of the major issues. The watershed has the highest septic system density of any comparable area in the state of California. Bacteria levels were dangerously high in the 1980s with 3% to 6% of the septic systems failing, discharging untreated sewage to the ground surface and another 7% to 9% of households illegally discharging
greywater, which also had a high bacteria and pathogen level.

Groundwater use impacts on surface water baseflow supporting anadromous fisheries for coho salmon and steelhead, particularly in Bean and Zayante Creeks, is another issue. A habitat restoration project has been underway since 1985. Recent counts of fish show the population is slowly rising to approximately 3000. Tidal influence wanes between the Broadway and Soquel Avenue bridges in the city of Santa Cruz, where some sand bars are visible.

Following devastating floods in December 1955, the Army Corps of Engineers built flood control measures along the San Lorenzo River and Branciforte Creek through downtown Santa Cruz. No flooding from the San Lorenzo River was reported when a flow event of nearly equal magnitude occurred in January 1982, but the water levels were much higher than one would expect, based on the original design. That was because a large amount of sediment had re-deposited in the channel after it was built. The original project design (1956) required periodic dredging of the bed sediment, which is both expensive and destructive to aquatic and riparian habitat. The flood control channel was not maintained regularly, presumably for those reasons. The levees and floodwalls were rebuilt in 2004, but the design for those changes still assumed that the channel bed would be maintained by dredging. Although the latest project calls for less dredging the original project, any dredging at all is economically and environmentally unfeasible for the City of Santa Cruz, the local sponsor of the federal project. The current and likely future levels of flood protection provided by the project, without dredging, was being studied by the Army Corps of Engineers as of August 2011.

As early as the 1970s Santa Cruz County began to create a hydrology transport model of the San Lorenzo River, retaining a group of scientists and engineers from Earth Metrics Inc., who were to create the first mathematical model of the river, with the objective of analyzing bedload transport and downstream sedimentation. The model was also used to predict transport of nitrates and other water pollution, and would be eventually used to study a variety of different land management and flood control strategies.

==Scenic elements==
Much of the upper reaches of this watershed are quite beautiful in their natural forest setting, while the lower reach is accessible to the large population of Santa Cruz. In 1987 the city of Santa Cruz retained ROMA, a San Francisco design firm, to develop a design concept plan for incorporating the natural elements of the river into the urban design fabric of the city. The plan led to creation of pedestrian walkways, picnic areas and view opportunities along the lower populated stretch of the river. The plan called for creation of a continuous forest to be established on the upper banks of Valley Oak, Buckeye, Willow and other trees with seasonal foliage.

One notably scenic reach between the Riverside Avenue and Broadway bridges may be the most visually prominent and attractive parts of the river. Here the river bends skirting the base of Beach Hill, a historic neighborhood and noteworthy topographic element of the city of Santa Cruz. This reach is visible from many parts of the city and gives a sense of steepness and enclosure within the channel. The west bank had been the site of a wooden boardwalk, now washed away by erosion.

<text>Tom Friedman (born 1965) is an American conceptual sculptor. He was born in St. Louis, Missouri and received a BFA in graphic illustration from Washington University in St. Louis (1988) and an MFA in sculpture from the University of Illinois at Chicago (1990.). As a conceptual artist he works in diverse media including sculpture, painting, drawing, video, and installation.

For over twenty years, Friedman has been investigating the viewer/object relationship, and &quot;the space in between.&quot; He has held solo exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, New York], Yerba Buena Museum of Art, San Francisco, Magasin 3 in Stockholm, Sweden, The New Museum in New York, the Tel Aviv Art Museum, and others. His work can be found in the museum collections of MoMA, Los Angeles Contemporary Art Museum, the Broad Art Museum, the Solomon Guggenheim Museum, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo. Friedman lives and works in Northampton, Massachusetts.

== Work ==
Friedman&#x27;s sculpture is recognizable for its highly inventive and idiosyncratic use of materials like Styrofoam, foil, paper, clay, wire, plastic, hair, and fuzz. Working autobiographically, he uses painstaking, labor-intensive methods to recreate seemingly random elements from his life. In each piece, he pays obsessive attention to detail, particularly in the replication of the objects that surround him.

Friedman brings humour and childlike wonder as well as grave philosophical issues to each work. With the art object as departure, he uses everyday, easily understood found materials. He says it&#x27;s &quot;enticing and seductive to start with the simple humble object that we all &#x27;think&#x27; we know.&quot; His intent is to draw the viewer into the simple beauty and familiarity of a piece, and then invite them to investigate it further.

Although much of the published work on Friedman&#x27;s art focuses on the materials, it is ultimately about the tension produced through the phenomenological experience of observer, artwork, and space in between. He often refers to his process as &quot;orchestrating an experience.&quot; He uses the art experience as a context for opening people&#x27;s minds to new ways of seeing, and thinking. To do so, he has developed a circular logic: a way of investigating the object and whittling it down to a core understanding of its metaphor and how it connects to the viewer, in their everyday life, and within societal and philosophical constructs, and then back to the object again.

== Career ==
Friedman worked closely with Feature Inc. for over 15 years. Feature was started in Chicago by Hudson. Friedman eulogized Hudson, saying, &quot;He understood the development of an artist and their vision. He could see so clearly the evolution of consciousness of an artist, and he knew how to push the work to the next level.&quot;

Friedman held his first solo exhibition in 1991 at Feature in New York. Three years later, he made his international debut in an exhibition at the Galleria Rauicci/Santamaria in Naples, Italy and the Galerie Analix in Geneva, Switzerland. His affiliation with Feature at this time led to a relationship with curator Robert Storr, which led to an exhibition in the Elaine Danhessier Project Series at MoMa in the spring of 1995 in tandem with Bruce Nauman&#x27;s &quot;Retrospective.&quot; Friedman was the 50th artist in the series, which focuses on emerging artists. An interview with Storr at this time yielded important information about Friedman&#x27;s process and circular logic.

In 1996 Friedman exhibited with Chuck Close (&quot;Affinities: Chuck Close and Tom Friedman&quot;) at the Art Institute of Chicago, curated by Madeleine Grynsztejn. In that same year, Friedman participated in exhibitions in France and Italy, also working with curator Paul Schimmel in Brazil for the Sao Paulo Biennale. Notable works from this time period include, Everything (1992–1995), 1000 Hours of Staring (1992–1997), Untitled (Curse) (1992), Untitled (Aspirin Head) (1994) and Untitled (Toothpicks) (1995).

In 1999 Friedman was one of five resident artists (including Byron Kim, Pauli Apfelbaum, Suzanne McClelland, Lorraine O&#x27;Grady) teaching at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. Friedman met John Waters, the visiting artist of that year, who later interviewed him for Parkett Magazine. In the interview Friedman spoke of his evolution as an artist over time, as well as the significance behind his art. On the humor of his work, Friedman said, &quot;there&#x27;s this misconception that playful thinking is not serious and it&#x27;s not important.&quot;

Between 2000 and 2002 a major exhibition of his work entitled, &quot;Tom Friedman: The Epic in the Everyday&quot;, was organized by the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art (SECCA). The show was exhibited there, and traveled also to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco, the Aspen Art Museum, and the New Museum, New York. At this time Friedman was a finalist for the Hugo Boss Prize at the Guggenheim, an honor given to artists deemed the most innovative and influential of the time. In 2002 Friedman was invited to have a solo exhibition at the Fonadzione Prada, Milan, Italy, curated by Germano Celant . A two volume catalogue was produced for the exhibition.

Friedman held two solo exhibitions at Gagosian Gallery: &quot;New Work&quot; at the Beverly Hills gallery and &quot;Monsters and Stuff&quot; in London. Both shows yielded extensive monographs.

In recent years, Friedman has built a portfolio of large-scale outdoor installations, beginning with Open Box (2007) and Circle Dance (2011), the latter being permanently installed on Brown University campus in 2012. In 2015, Friedman&#x27;s Looking Up (2015) was installed on Park Avenue in New York. Another rendition of the 33.3&#x27; figure is permanently installed at the Laguna Gloria campus of The Contemporary Austin Texas. Up in the Air, which debuted in 2010 at the Magasin III gallery in Stockholm, marked his first solo exhibition in a Scandinavian country. The installation, consisting of roughly 900 suspended sculptures, continued onto the Tel Aviv Museum of Art between 2014 and 2015. In 2016, Friedman exhibited works for a group exhibition co-curated by Denise Markonish and Sean Foley entitled &quot;Explode Every Day&quot; at Mass MoCA, North Adams, Massachusetts.

Throughout 2016 and 2017 Friedman focused largely on standalone sculptures. Once standing on Park Avenue, Looking Up (2015) was moved to Chicago&#x27;s lakefront where it will permanently remain. In addition, a third edition of the piece was installed at the James S. McDonnell Planetarium in St. Louis, Missouri. Friedman continued to work in a public forum, unveiling Huddle (2017), a 10x18 foot piece designed for the Dallas Cowboys installed at their training grounds. In late 2017, Friedman had a solo exhibition at Luhring Augustine entitled &quot;Ghosts and UFOs: Projections for Well-Lit Spaces.&quot; The show, which consisted solely of projections, was a very dramatic shift from Friedman&#x27;s previous chronology. While a departure from Friedman&#x27;s past works, The New York Times praised it as, &quot;effortlessly brilliant.&quot; In 2018, Friedman produced a large body of drawings for a solo exhibition at Stephen Friedman Gallery entitled, &quot;Always The Beginning.&quot; The show was a reproduction and rendering of notebook pages from Friedman&#x27;s sketchbooks spanning 30 years prior. In addition, Friedman released a new book of selected notes and sketches to accompany the work.

==Artistry==
In an interview with Los Angeles-based writer Dennis Cooper, Friedman spoke in depth on the process and thinking behind much of his art. He revealed to Cooper a disdain for much of his graduate work, which led him to reconsider his image as an artist. “At this point I sort of dropped the idea of making art; it was more about &quot;discovering a beginning.&quot; Friedman remarked. During this time period he completely emptied his studio and created an all white isolation chamber in which he would meditate on objects he brought in from his home. Friedman began at this point to move towards self described radical stages of simplification focusing on the process of his work. In pieces like Untitled (1990), eraser shaving formed into a circle, Friedman focused on repetitive actions which became for him &quot;almost like a mantra.&quot; This study of object is also evident in his 1990 writing, Ingredients, a list of all the questions one can ask about an object, organized into three main categories. The object, the location of the object, and the viewer. The questionnaire ended up being twenty pages long.

In a 1997 interview with Hudson, Friedman elaborated on his creative process, &quot;I play both the scientist and the experimental subject...it began as an intellectual process, but is evolving into an emotional understanding.&quot; Friedman also went on to say, &quot;In my past work my ideas about change have been more about transformation: the material&#x27;s transformation from what it is into something different. The ideas surrounding mutation and deviation are interesting to me not only in that they inform the transformation of materials, but also in how they evolve, and depart from each different branch of my investigation… the different ideas that I explore within a body of work range from ideas that opened things up for me, to unifying ideas that connect my separate branches of investigation.&quot; Friedman further elaborated on this claim in Irvine Fine Arts Center&#x27;s, &quot;Ideas in Things&quot; in 1999, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m involved in constructing this phenomenon of myself being absorbed by the work in such a way that one or the other of us is going to disappear - it into me or me into it.&quot;

==Awards and recognition==
Throughout his career, Friedman has received numerous awards. In 1993 he received both the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award and the Academy Award in Art from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Friedman also received a grant from The Joan Mitchell Foundation in 2001. Between 1993 and 1995 he was the Luther Greg Sullivan Visiting Artist at Wesleyan University and in 1999 he had a residency at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpting in Skowhegan, ME. In 2013 Friedman received an Honorary Doctorate Degree in the Arts from the Montserrat College of Art.

Friedman&#x27;s work has also been the subject of several books, including a feature in an eponymous Phaidon book. Charlotte Eyerman&#x27;s &quot;Friedman: Up in the Air&quot; studies the solo exhibition of the same name indepth. Friedman himself has released two books, featuring commentary by Arthur C. Danto, Ralph Rugoff, and Robert Storr, among others. Friedman has been featured extensively in magazines such as Artforum and Frieze.

<doc id="657559" wikidata="Q728289" url="?curid=657559" title="Toy Dolls">
<text>The Toy Dolls are an English punk rock band formed in 1979. They are best known for their sole UK hit, a punk-rock cover of &quot;Nellie the Elephant&quot;. The Toy Dolls&#x27; songs expressed a sense of fun, such as &quot;Yul Brynner Was a Skinhead&quot;, &quot;My Girlfriend&#x27;s Dad&#x27;s a Vicar&quot; and &quot;James Bond Lives Down Our Street&quot;, and songs titles often use alliteration, such as &quot;Peter Practice&#x27;s Practice Place&quot;, &quot;Fisticuffs in Frederick Street&quot;, &quot;Neville Is a Nerd&quot;, and &quot;Quick to Quit the Quentin&quot;.

Their albums usually include a cover version of a well-known hit song, usually sped up to the usual punk rock tempo. Covers have included &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;, &quot;Toccata in Dm&quot;, &quot;No Particular Place to Go&quot;, &quot;Sabre Dance&quot;, &quot;Livin&#x27; La Vida Loca&quot;, &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s So Modern&quot; and &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;. They have also recorded parodies of popular songs, such as &quot;The Kids in Tyne and Wear (Kids in America)&quot; and &quot;The Devil Went Down to Scunthorpe (The Devil Went Down to Georgia)&quot;. Their albums often start with a short intro with a catchy guitar riff, and end with an outro, which is usually a slightly longer variation of the intro riff. Kazoos are also prominent in many of their songs.

Most of the band members have nicknames, and are rarely seen without their cartoonish rectangular sunglasses (although they appeared bare-eyed on the &quot;One More Megabyte&quot; album cover).

==Career==

The Toy Dolls formed as a quartet featuring vocalist Pete &quot;Zulu&quot; Robson; guitarist Michael &quot;Olga&quot; Algar (born 21 September 1962, South Shields, England); drummer Colin &quot;Mr. Scott&quot; Scott; and bassist Phillip &quot;Flip&quot; Dugdale. After just a few gigs, Zulu left to form his own band and was replaced by Paul &quot;Hud&quot; Hudson on vocals for one concert. After Hud&#x27;s departure, the Toy Dolls became a trio, with guitarist Olga assuming permanent vocal duties.

Scott left the band in 1980 and was replaced by Dean James for four months over the summer of 1980. James later returned to the band from 1985 to 1988 as bassist. Flip left in 1983, marking the beginning of a revolving door of drummers and bassists that would characterise the Toy Dolls line-up over the years (with Olga as the mainstay and only original member). In 1984, Zulu returned to the line-up as bassist/backing vocalist, but departed again less than a year later.

They were initially grouped with the Oi! scene, and have also been classified as punk pathetique. One reason they are associated with Oi! is that they were championed by Garry Bushell, who was very involved with Oi! bands such as Angelic Upstarts (whom The Toy Dolls later supported on their first national tour). In 1980, a Sunderland businessman financed the Toy Dolls&#x27; debut single, &quot;Tommy Kowey&#x27;s Car&quot; with &quot;She Goes To Fino&#x27;s&quot; on the B-side. The single quickly sold out its initial pressing of 500 copies, but the band could not afford to press any more, making the single a collectors&#x27; item. Around the time the band signed to Volume, Olga moved to Newton Hall, in north Durham, which led to the song &quot;Livin&#x27; on Newton Hall&quot;.

For Christmas 1982, they released their punk rendition of &quot;Nellie the Elephant&quot;, a classic children&#x27;s song, which hit No. 1 in the UK Indie Chart. In 1983, they released their debut album &quot;Dig That Groove Baby&quot;. In 1984, their re-issue of &quot;Nellie the Elephant&quot; reached No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart and stayed in the chart for 14 weeks. Their 1985 album, &quot;A Far Out Disc&quot;, reached No. 71 in the UK Albums Chart.

Since then, the band has continued to release albums and to tour widely, mainly across continental Europe, South America and Japan. After a gap of fourteen years since their last gig in Britain, 2007 saw a string of UK dates taking in cities from Glasgow to London, including a &quot;homecoming&quot; for a show at Durham University.

The band released a best-of album, &quot;Ten Years of Toys&quot;. 1993 saw the popular live song &quot;I&#x27;m a Telly Addict&quot; on the album &quot;Absurd-Ditties&quot;. In 1997, the band released &quot;One More Megabyte&quot;, which featured references to computers, mainly in the lyrics of its title track, and in tracks like the outro track. A popular cover of Ricky Martin&#x27;s &quot;Livin&#x27; La Vida Loca&quot; made its way onto &quot;Anniversary Anthems&quot; in 2000. The band&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Our Last Album?&quot; fooled fans in the anticipation up to its release that it was the band&#x27;s last album. The outro track on the album stated that it was not.

To celebrate the band&#x27;s twenty-fifth anniversary in 2004, the official biography, &quot;The Toy Dolls: From Fulwell to Fukuoka&quot;, was published by Ardra Press.

In 2006, The Toy Dolls contributed their cover version of &quot;Toccata in Dm&quot; to the album project &quot;Artists for Charity – Guitarists 4 the Kids&quot;, produced by Slang Productions, to assist World Vision Canada in helping underprivileged kids in need.

For their thirtieth anniversary in October 2009, the band received congratulatory messages from a selection of musicians, including Baz Warne from the Stranglers, TV Smith from the Adverts, Jake Burns from Stiff Little Fingers, and NOFX manager Kent Jamieson.

The Toy Dolls live shows consist of synchronized choreography, timed moves, dances, jumps, and spinning guitars.

The band&#x27;s song &quot;Nellie the Elephant&quot; was used by Tesco in their toy advertisement in October 2014.

&quot;The Album After the Last One&quot; was released in 2012. The band has been on a &quot;The Tour After the Last One&quot; and started a range of Toy Dolls-themed real ales under the label &quot;The Beer After the Last One&quot;.

In 2018, the band played one show in Montebello, Quebec, for the city&#x27;s annual Rockfest music festival, marking the first time in the band&#x27;s 38-year history that they played a show in Canada.

==Members==
As of 2007, the band has had fourteen different drummers and twelve different bassists. Olga is the only remaining original member of the band. After Olga, drummer Martin Yule had the longest tenure in the band (1987–2000). Yule currently owns a record shop in Sunderland called Hot Rats. Former drummer Dave &quot;the Nut&quot; Nuttall owns Jalapeño Drums, a custom drum company based in Lancaster, Lancashire. The current lead singer/guitarist with the Stranglers, Baz Warne, also had a stint with the band. Olga has played bass on tours with the US punk band the Dickies, and also with the Adicts. Gary Dunn, former bassist of the Toy Dolls (1997–1999), teaches music at Harton Academy, and former drummer, Trevor &quot;The Frog&quot; Brewis, teaches music at Middlesbrough College, though Olga moved away from the northeast of England a number of years ago, and now lives in London.

It has become a tradition to give a special nickname to every Toy Dolls member.

<text>Structuring, also known as smurfing in banking jargon, is the practice of executing financial transactions such as making bank deposits in a specific pattern, calculated to avoid triggering financial institutions to file reports required by law, such as the United States&#x27; Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and Internal Revenue Code section 6050I (relating to the requirement to file Form 8300). Structuring may be done in the context of money laundering, fraud, and other financial crimes. Legal restrictions on structuring are concerned with limiting the size of domestic transactions for individuals.

==Definition==
Structuring is the act of parceling what would otherwise be a large financial transaction into a series of smaller transactions to avoid scrutiny by regulators and law enforcement. Typically each of the smaller transactions is executed in an amount below some statutory limit that normally does not require a financial institution to file a report with a government agency. Criminal enterprises may employ several agents (&quot;smurfs&quot;) to make the transaction. Structuring appears in federal indictments related to money laundering, fraud, and other financial crimes.

The term &quot;smurfing&quot; is derived from the image of the comic book characters the Smurfs having a large group of many small entities. Miami-based lawyer Gregory Baldwin is said to have coined the term in the 1980s.

==Regulations==

===United States===
In the United States, the Bank Secrecy Act requires currency transaction reports (CTRs) to be filed for cash transactions involving coin or paper money valued at more than $10,000; it applies to both U.S. and foreign currencies. Contrary to popular misunderstanding, it does not apply to checks or electronic transactions. Financial institutions suspecting deposit structuring with intent to avoid the law are required to file a suspicious activity report (SAR). In 1986, the U.S. Congress enacted section 5324 of Title 31 of the United States Code, which provides (in part):

No person shall, for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements of section 5313 (a) or 5325 or any regulation prescribed under any such section, the reporting or record keeping requirements imposed by any order issued under section 5326, or the record keeping requirements imposed by any regulation prescribed under section 21 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or section 123 of Public Law 91–508—[...]

(3) structure or assist in structuring, or attempt to structure or assist in structuring, any transaction with one or more domestic financial institutions.

Section 5324 further provides that a violation of this provision may be punished by a fine or up to five years in prison, or both. The filing of Form 8300 is required under Internal Revenue Code section 6050I.

Sums of money resulting from deposits of less than $10,000 may be seized after a warrant is issued based on a suspicious activity report. Legal proceedings, which may cost in the vicinity of $20,000 or more, may be required for an innocent party to retrieve his or her money. Reports in October 2014 by &quot;The New York Times&quot; of arbitrary seizures resulted in modification of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) practice to focus on investigations that &quot;closely align&quot; with IRS &quot;mission and key priorities&quot;. Banks are not permitted to warn or advise customers unless the customer asks, but sometimes bank tellers will informally warn customers.

===Outside the United States===

==Other uses==
The term &quot;smurfing&quot; is also applied to activity associated with controlled substances such as pseudoephedrine. In this context, the agent will make purchases of small, legal amounts from several drug and grocery stores, with the intent to aggregate the lot for use in the illegal production of methamphetamine. Also, since the monthly pseudoephedrine purchase limits in US are too low for mass meth production, this practice often involves using multiple &quot;smurfs&quot;.

As Robert Pennal of the Fresno Meth Task Force explains:

Then we started seeing &quot;smurfing.&quot; Remember how the smurfs were little gatherers? We started getting calls from different retail stores that people were buying two or three packs—that&#x27;s the most you can buy—and they went to one store, they bought three, they went to another store, bought three. We&#x27;re seeing blister packs everywhere because they&#x27;re sitting in the car, they&#x27;re punching the pills out of the blister packs, they&#x27;re putting them in the freezer bags and they&#x27;re turning them over to chemical brokers.

<doc id="657573" wikidata="Q465450" url="?curid=657573" title="American Le Mans Series">
<text>The American Le Mans Series (ALMS) was a sports car racing series based in the United States and Canada. It consisted of a series of endurance and sprint races, and was created in the spirit of the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

The American Le Mans&#x27; headquarters was in Braselton, Georgia, adjacent to Road Atlanta.

In 2014, the series merged with the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series to form the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship.

==History==
The series was created by Braselton, Georgia-based businessman Don Panoz and ran its first season in 1999. Panoz created a partnership with the Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest (ACO), the organizers of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, to begin a 10-hour race in the spirit of Le Mans, dubbed the Petit Le Mans. The inaugural Petit Le Mans took place in 1998 as a part of the Professional SportsCar Racing series, in which Panoz was an investor. For 1999, the series changed its name to the American Le Mans Series, and adopted the ACO&#x27;s rulebook.

The partnership with the ACO allowed ALMS teams to earn automatic entries in the Le Mans 24 Hours. This was a practice that began with the inaugural Petit Le Mans, a practice that continues today, where 1st and 2nd place teams in each class earn entries to the next year&#x27;s 24 Hours. The ALMS race at Adelaide in 2000 also received automatic entries. Invitations were extended to the series champions beginning in 2003, for the 2004 race. The ACO has always given high consideration to teams competing in ALMS races, and many ALMS teams have seen success in the 24 Hours.
The series began with eight races in 1999, beginning with the 12 Hours of Sebring, and ending at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. The schedule expanded to 12 races in 2000, including two races in Europe, and one in Australia. In subsequent years, the European races disappeared, with the creation of the short-lived European Le Mans Series, and later the Le Mans Series. The series also began to move away from the rovals, road courses in the infield of large superspeedways, at Charlotte Motor Speedway, Las Vegas, and Texas Motor Speedway. In its later years, the series visited more temporary street courses, many in conjunction with the Indy Racing League, at cities such as St. Petersburg, Florida and Long Beach, California. The series raced at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca, Mosport, Road Atlanta and Sebring in every year of its existence. From 2011 until the series folded, ALMS competed on a street circuit through the Inner Harbor coinciding with the Grand Prix of Baltimore, Maryland over the US Labor Day weekend.

The series was the first motorsport racing series in North America to be recognized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA), the United States Department of Energy and the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International) as a &quot;Green Racing Series&quot;, and held an all-new series implemented on series races dedicated to the environment by holding their first-ever &quot;Green Challenge&quot; during the 2008 Petit Le Mans and would continue this at least up to the entire 2009 season.

In 2010 the American Le Mans Series signed its first title sponsorship agreement, with Tequila Patrón becoming a presenting sponsor for three seasons.

On September 5, 2012, the series announced that they would fully merge in 2014 with Grand-Am Road Racing under the banner of the TUDOR United SportsCar Championship, with the International Motor Sports Association.

==Overview==

The American Le Mans Series used essentially the same rules as the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Like the 24 Hours of Le Mans, there were three primary classes, though there were two extra &quot;Challenge classes&quot; using standardized cars. Purpose-built race cars with closed fenders competed in the &quot;Prototype&quot; classes P1, P2, and PC (Prototype-Challenge) and modified production sports cars competed in the &quot;Grand Touring&quot; classes GT (GTE-Pro and GTE-Am combined, formerly GT2) along with GT-Challenge or GTC. The former GT1 category was abandoned after 2009 season. In 2012, the &quot;Le Mans&quot; (LM) was dropped from the names of the prototype categories.

Each car is driven by multiple drivers (2 or 3, depending on the length of the race), and all cars compete together simultaneously. P1 generally contains factory teams while P2 contains privateer teams. In ACO-sanctioned racing all of the drivers are professional in GTE-PRO, while in GTE-Am, 1 or 2 amateurs are allowed to race with a professional driver in support. However, since ALMS uses only one GTE category and combines the PRO/AM classes, there are no limitations for drivers.

The two &quot;Challenge&quot; classes were formula-based, and were designed for privateers or rookies to have an easier time entering the series. The Challenge classes used the Oreca FLM09 (P) and the Porsche 911 GT3 Cup (GT), though there were reports that the ACO would open the Challenge class to other manufacturers in 2013 or later.

The team points champions and runners-up in each class at the end of the season received an automatic invitation to the next year&#x27;s 24 Hours of Le Mans.

==Michelin Green X Challenge==
In January 2008, the American Le Mans Series announced it would hold its first &quot;Green Challenge&quot; competition during Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta in October, ahead of the Challenge being implemented at all ALMS races during the 2009 season. In conjunction with the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, Environment Canada and SAE International, the Series unveiled the Green Challenge&#x27;s rules and regulations. Two class leading vehicles ran low  or green engines during the 2008 season – the GT1 Chevrolet Corvette C6.R with an E85 cellulosic ethanol powered 7.0 litre V8 and the LMP1 Audi R10 TDI with a 5.5 litre turbodiesel V12. Currently, the Michelin Green X Challenge awards invitations to the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the 1st and 2nd-place winners in the Prototype and GT categories for the entire season.

The Challenge measures &quot;Green&quot; (based on fuel-type and other factors influencing emissions), &quot;Speed&quot; (overall speed), and &quot;Efficiency&quot; (based on fuel-economy). A formula is used to produce a score based on the three categories. The car with the lowest score at the end of the race wins the Challenge for that race.

==Television==
The series&#x27; first season in 1999 was covered by NBC and CNBC. Since 2000 Speed Channel broadcast the majority of ALMS races, including the 12 Hours of Sebring and Petit Le Mans, while some of the series&#x27; other races were broadcast on ABC, NBC and CBS. For the 2012 season, all races were webcast on ESPN3.com. The Long Beach Grand Prix, Northeast Grand Prix at Lime Rock, and Grand Prix of Mosport were broadcast live on ESPN2, while the ALMS at Monterey, Road Race Showcase at Road America and ALMS at VIR had delayed highlights on the same channel. The Mid-Ohio Sports Car Challenge was broadcast live on ABC, while the 12 Hours of Sebring, Baltimore Grand Prix, and Petit Le Mans had delayed highlights on the same network.

In 2013, Speed Channel reacquired broadcasting right to 12 Hours of Sebring and Petit Le Mans; the rest of the races were broadcast on ESPN2 and ABC with webcast on ESPN3.com.

<text>Triangle is a BBC Television soap opera broadcast in the early 1980s, set aboard a North Sea ferry that sailed from Felixstowe to Gothenburg and Gothenburg to Amsterdam. A third imaginary leg existed between Amsterdam and Felixstowe to justify the programme&#x27;s title, but this was not operated by the ferry company. The show ran for three series before being cancelled, but is still generally remembered as &quot;some of the most mockable British television ever produced&quot;. The scripts involved clichéd relationships and stilted dialogue, making the show the butt of several jokes—particularly on Terry Wogan&#x27;s morning Radio 2 programme—which caused some embarrassment to the BBC. (BBC Classic sitcom &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; in Season 8, Episode 1 &quot;Is It Catching?&quot;, hinted at the show being nausea-inducing for more reasons than just its setting. Even the anarchic BBC sitcom &quot;The Young Ones&quot; poked fun at the series, when one character says, &quot;Even &quot;Triangle&quot; has better furniture than this!&quot;)

In 1992, the BBC screened &quot;TV Hell&quot;, an evening of programming devoted to the worst that television had to offer, and the first episode of &quot;Triangle&quot; was broadcast as part of the line-up.

The ferry used in the first series was the Tor Line&#x27;s . This was replaced in the second and third series by the DFDS vessel &quot;Dana Anglia&quot; (DFDS having acquired Tor Line by this time), probably because she had a less intensive schedule, and the longer time she spent in port made on-board filming easier.

==Production limitations==
Interviewed for a &quot;TV Hell&quot; segment in 1992, the show&#x27;s producer, Bill Sellars, and the leading actor, Larry Lamb, spoke of several problems with the show&#x27;s production.

Using a ferry as the setting for a television series had originally looked like a promising idea. The regular cast, playing the crew, could be joined by a constantly changing guest cast playing the passengers as the ship sailed to interesting European locations (a format used in the American series &quot;The Love Boat&quot;). Advances in portable video cameras and recording equipment meant that the show could be videotaped on board a real ferry with more realism than using studio sets and more cheaply than using the 16mm film that was normal for location television drama at the time.

Unfortunately, the plan was revealed to be flawed almost as soon as location shooting—largely conducted in the North Sea—began. The inclement weather made the exterior scenes appear gloomy and dull, and far from glamorous. In making the first episode, Kate O&#x27;Mara had to endure a scene in which she sunbathes topless on a clearly freezing deck.

Another problem involved lighting. The cameras were perfectly comfortable with either natural or artificial lighting conditions, but a mixture of the two always produced unnatural-looking colour. The video cameras of the day did not cope well with contrasting light levels between inside and outside, so interior scenes often had to be shot with the windows or portholes curtained—so that as far as the audience was concerned they might as well have been shot in a studio anyway.

The relatively new &quot;electronic field production&quot; portable video technology (used for location footage in place of the traditional 16mm film) also exhibited serious problems—owing to, amongst other things, the movement of the ship which disrupted the stability of the video recorders. Rough seas also induced seasickness in many of the production crew, making shooting an uncomfortable experience.

==Broadcasts==
The programme was broadcast every Monday and Wednesday.

* Series 1: 5 January – 1 April 1981: 26 episodes.

<text>John Edwin Bertrand (born 20 December 1946) is a yachtsman from Australia, who skippered &quot;Australia II&quot; to victory in the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup, ending 132 years of American supremacy, and the only time Australia has won. Bertrand won the bronze medal in the Finn competition at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. In 2010 and 2016, he won the world Etchells class sailing championships. He is a life member of both the Royal Brighton Yacht Club in Melbourne, and the Sorrento Sailing Couta Boat Club.

==Biography== 
John Bertrand was born in Melbourne, Victoria.

He wrote &quot;Born to Win&quot;, &quot;The Power of a Vision,&quot; about the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup victory, including insightful observations on the strategy for an unfavoured team against very long odds. During the 1983 competition, Bertrand and his crew deliberately employed their own psychological strategy ahead of the America&#x27;s Cup breakthrough in refusing to refer to the all-conquering American team by their names and instead calling their opposition simply &quot;the red boat&quot; in order to mislead the rival. In the 2016 Rio Olympics, Mack Horton, an Australian freestyle swimming champion, admitted the criticism towards another swimmer Sun Yang was a deliberate strategy to try and gain a mental edge on his rival, borrowing from the tactics employed by Bertrand in the lead-up to Australia II&#x27;s famous triumph in 1983.

Bertrand is the chairman of the Sport Australia Hall of Fame (2005+) and The Alannah and Madeline Foundation (2001+).

He is also the President of Swimming Australia (Oct 2013+).

==Honours==
* 26 January 1984: Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in recognition of service to yachting, particularly as skipper of the &quot;Australia II&quot; in the America&#x27;s Cup challenge 1983.
* 10 December 1985: Induction into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame
* 18 September 1993: Member of the America&#x27;s Cup Hall of Fame for outstanding achievement in the America&#x27;s Cup.
* 14 July 2000: Australian Sports Medal for outstanding achievement in the America&#x27;s Cup and general contribution
* 1 January 2001: Centenary Medal for service to Australian society through the sport of Sailing.
* 2008 Melburnian of the Year for community leadership.
* 25 October 2013: Awarded an Honorary Doctorate, Victoria University.

<doc id="657587" wikidata="Q370181" url="?curid=657587" title="William Daniels">
<text>William David Daniels (born March 31, 1927) is an American actor who is known for his television roles, notably as Mark Craig on the drama series &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, for which he won two Primetime Emmy Awards; the voice of KITT on the television series &quot;Knight Rider&quot;; and George Feeny on the sitcom &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, which earned him four People&#x27;s Choice Award nominations. He reprised his &quot;Knight Rider&quot; role in the sequel TV movie &quot;Knight Rider 2000&quot; and his &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; role in the sequel series &quot;Girl Meets World&quot;. He also portrayed Carter Nash (the actual identity of the eponymous comedic superhero) in &quot;Captain Nice&quot;.

Daniels&#x27;s film roles include Mr. Braddock (Benjamin Braddock&#x27;s father) in &quot;The Graduate&quot;, Howard Maxwell-Manchester in &quot;Two for the Road&quot;, and John Adams in the musical film &quot;1776&quot;. He was president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1999 to 2001 and led the union&#x27;s efforts during the 2000 commercial actors strike.

Daniels is also noted for having portrayed in film or on television the three most prominent members of the Adams political family: John Adams, his cousin and fellow founding father, Samuel Adams, and John Adams&#x27;s son John Quincy Adams.

==Early life==
William David Daniels was born on March 31, 1927, in Brooklyn, New York, to Irene and David Daniels. His father was a bricklayer, and his mother was a telephone operator. He has two sisters, Jacqueline and Carol. He grew up in East New York, Brooklyn.

Daniels was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1945 and stationed in Italy, where he served as a disc jockey at an Army radio station. At the suggestion of Howard Lindsay, co-author of &quot;Life with Father&quot;, who recommended he use the GI Bill to attend a college with a good drama department, Daniels enrolled at Northwestern University. He graduated from Northwestern in 1949, and is a member of Sigma Nu fraternity.

==Career==

Daniels began his career as a member of the singing Daniels family in Brooklyn. He made his television debut as part of a variety act (along with other members of his family) in 1943, on NBC, then a single station in New York. He made his Broadway debut in 1943 in &quot;Life with Father&quot;, and remained a busy Broadway actor for decades afterwards. His Broadway credits include roles in &quot;1776&quot;, &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot;, &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot;, and &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;. He received an Obie Award for &quot;The Zoo Story&quot; (1960).

Daniels&#x27;s motion picture debut was as a school principal in the 1963 anti-war drama film &quot;Ladybug Ladybug&quot;. In 1965, he reprised his Broadway role as a child welfare worker in the screen version of &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot;. In 1967 he appeared in &quot;The Graduate&quot; as the father of Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s character. In 1969, Daniels starred as John Adams in the Broadway musical &quot;1776&quot;; he also appeared in the film version in 1972. Two years later, he co-starred in Richard Donner&#x27;s telefilm &quot;Sarah T. - Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic&quot;. in 1979 he again reprised his role as the outspoken John Adams in the film &quot;Rebels&quot;, again about the American revolution, without seeming to ever break character. He is known as the quintessential John Adams.

Daniels&#x27;s first network television appearance came in 1952 when he portrayed the young John Quincy Adams, eldest son of John and Abigail Adams in the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; drama &quot;A Woman for the Ages.&quot; In 1976, he reprised the role as the middle-aged and elder John Quincy Adams in the acclaimed PBS miniseries &quot;The Adams Chronicles&quot;. He starred in the short-lived series &quot;Captain Nice&quot; as police chemist Carter Nash. He appeared as acid-tongued Dr. Mark Craig in &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; from 1982 to 1988, for which he won two Emmy awards. Concurrently, he provided the voice of KITT in &quot;Knight Rider&quot; from 1982 to 1986. Daniels said in 1982, &quot;My duties on &quot;Knight Rider&quot; are very simple. I do it in about an hour and a half. I&#x27;ve never met the cast. I haven&#x27;t even met the producer.&quot;

Daniels reprised the voice-only role of KITT in 1991 for the television movie &quot;Knight Rider 2000&quot;, and again in the theatrical comedy movie &quot;The Benchwarmers&quot;. He performed the role in AT&amp;T and GE commercials about talking machines, and twice in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as well as at the Comedy Central Roast of his co-star David Hasselhoff. He reprised the role of KITT in the 2015 Lego-themed action-adventure video game &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;.

Daniels portrayed strict but loving educator George Feeny at John Adams High School in &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; from 1993 to 2000. In addition to the previously mentioned 1967 superhero sitcom &quot;Captain Nice&quot;, he was a regular on the 1970s TV series &quot;Freebie and the Bean&quot; and &quot;The Nancy Walker Show&quot;.

A familiar character actor, he has appeared as a guest star on numerous TV comedies and dramas, including &quot;Soap&quot;, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and many others. In 2012, Daniels appeared in the ninth season of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; as Dr. Craig Thomas, an unlikely mentor to the character of Dr. Cristina Yang played by actress Sandra Oh. His character, Dr. Thomas, died in the operating room while performing a procedure to repair a heart defect midway through the season, which forced Yang to move back to Seattle.

In 2014, Daniels reprised his role as Mr. Feeny in the pilot episode of the &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; spinoff, &quot;Girl Meets World&quot;. He cameoed in the final scene, praising the adult Cory Matthews for his parenting. He made additional appearances in the second and third seasons.

In early 2023, he completed filming of the role of King Henry VI in the upcoming &quot;Richard III&quot;.

==Personal life==

Daniels has been married to actress and fellow Emmy Award winner Bonnie Bartlett since June 30, 1951; at 73 years, it is the longest active Hollywood marriage as of July 2024. In 1961, Bartlett gave birth to a son, who died 24 hours later. They adopted two sons: Michael, who became an assistant director and stage manager in Los Angeles, and Robert, who became an artist and computer graphics designer based in New York City.

Bartlett and Daniels both served on the Screen Actors Guild&#x27;s board of directors.

==Awards and honors==
Daniels refused the 1969 Tony Award nomination for Featured Actor in a Musical in &quot;1776&quot; due to his insistence that the part of John Adams was a leading role rather than supporting. He was ruled to be ineligible for the Best Actor nomination because of the technicality that his name was not billed above the title of the show.

From 1983 to 1987, Daniels&#x27; work on &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; earned him five consecutive nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, winning in 1985 and 1986. In 1986, Daniels and Bartlett, who played his fictional wife on &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, won Emmy Awards on the same night (Bartlett for Supporting Actress in a Drama Series), becoming the first married couple to accomplish the feat since Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne in 1965 for a production of &quot;The Magnificent Yankee&quot; for the Hallmark Hall of Fame.

<doc id="657589" wikidata="Q3666953" url="?curid=657589" title="Cheap Sex">
<text>Cheap Sex is an American street punk band formed in December 2002, based in San Diego, California. Besides releasing three albums, the band participated in some compilations, including the Pure Punk Rock DVD, released by Punk Core Records, also featuring Action, the Casualties, Blood or Whiskey, Defiance, the Havoc, Lower Class Brats, the Messengers, the Scarred and the Virus, the last one being Mike Virus&#x27; previous band.

==History==
After Mike left the Virus, he decided to form a new band, taking the name Cheap Sex because it was catchy and funny. The original line-up consisted of bassist Derek, guitarists John and Jordan, drummer Gabe and Mike singing, soon after they formed, a five-song demo was recorded. The band signed with Punk Core Records and recorded their debut album titled &quot;Launch Off to War&quot;, released in July 2003, Jordan only recorded half album before leaving to join Madcap, being replaced by Chris Blitz.

After playing several shows on the West Coast, the band made its East Coast debut at the 3 day Vive Le Punk Festival at CBGB OMFUG in New York. The festival took place on October 3, 4 and 5th, 2003, in both the Main Stage and the Lounge Stage at CBGB, on the Main Stage bands like Abrasive Wheels, MDC, the Krays, the Casualties, Two Man Advantage, Awkward Thought, Molotov Cocktail, the Boils among others performed, while the Lounge Stage, restricted to people with legal drinking age (21 and over), hosted bands like U.S. Chaos, Street Brats, Wretched Ones, Hugh Cornwell Band, Broken Heroes, Capo Regime, Weekend Warriors and Spitfires United among others. Cheap Sex performed Saturday October 4, sharing the Main Stage with the Adicts, Antidote, New York Rel-X, the Turbo A.C.&#x27;s, Midnight Creeps and Silenced Sin.

In 2003, in a tour with Lower Class Brats, driving a van to New York the band suffered an accident, when a trailer sideswiped the van, a truck loaded with cinder blocks was on the road, the truck took the doors off the van and some bricks flew in, one of the bricks severely injured Johnny O., tearing his aorta, this caused the cancellation of the rest of the tour. Despite the life-threatening accident, Johnn survived, but left the band to recover from the injury, due to the John&#x27;s departure Phil joined the band.

In April 2004, the band recorded their second album for Punk Core Records, entitled &quot;Headed for a Breakdown&quot;, released October 5, 2004. They toured extensively during that summer, playing along the east coast with label mates Lower Class Brats.

The band performed in July at the Wasted 2004 festival in the U.K. (formerly known as Holidays in the Sun) with bands such as Discharge and Broken Bones. In the same year, Cheap Sex participated in the British Invasion 2k4 Festival, organized by SOS Records, the festival took place November 20, in San Bernardino, with the Adicts, the Exploited, Discharge, U.K. Subs, Cockney Rejects, the Restarts and local U.S. bands like Total Chaos, CH3 and Resilience among others, the show was recorded for a DVD release.

In 2005, the band returned to Morecambe for another edition of the Wasted Festival, between May 18 and 22, this time with bands like G.B.H., the Business, Funeral Dress, the Exploited, Anti Nowhere League, T.S.OL. and a lot more.

The last record by Cheap Sex, &quot;Written in Blood&quot;, was released on June 6, 2006, followed up with what would be their last U.S. tour with label mates the Scarred, called the &quot;Bloody Solution U.S. Tour&quot;, which began on August 11, 2006, in Anaheim and ended on September 16, 2006, in Ventura.

On March 1, 2007, Cheap Sex&#x27;s former guitarist, Chris Wick, committed suicide after struggling with heroin addiction and depression after the death of his mother in 2004, leading to the band&#x27;s break-up. On March 15, 2007, Cheap Sex sent out a bulletin via MySpace stating that they would be breaking up and a final show was in the works, the final show was played June 24, 2007, with Career Soldiers and 46 Short in Fullerton, California.

In 2009, Cheap Sex released a DVD entitled &quot;Dead Today: V Years of Cheap Sex&quot; featuring a documentary about the band and live footage from the final two shows. The DVD was directed by their long-time merchandise creator and filmmaker Lewis Smithingham.

==After Cheap Sex==
Mike was in a new band called Evacuate with members from Lab Rats and 2nd Hand Justice, following the hardcore / street punk sound that Cheap Sex and the Virus had, the band released a demo in 2007, plus a single and two albums. The band ended in 2017. Mike started a punk record label under the Evacuate name.

Phil and Brock, although rumored to initially be in Mike&#x27;s band, Evacuate, have gone on to create a different band, A Bande Apart, a female fronted band. The band recorded a demo and then split up.

In addition to A Bande Apart, Brock was the bassist for Smash 77 with Shawn Smash from Total Chaos and Danny, ex-drummer of the same band. He plays bass in the rock band Plissken.

Phil briefly played with the Los Angeles band the Lieutenants, as well as the Long Beach based band Three Two Ones, with former members of the US Bombs and Duane Peters Gunfight, and the Hunns. He now sings and plays guitar for the band Drosscapes.

Johnny O. Negative has played with Lower Class Brats and Total Chaos to fill in for open spots on their tours, he has also lived in Raleigh, North Carolina, working with No Revolution. Johnny joined the Lower Class Brats as a full-time member but after several years left the band. Currently, Johnny lives in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Gabe (a.k.a. Gabe Cross, Gabe Sex, Gabe Skunt) has played drums for the San Diego garage rock band the Muslims for a short period of time, the Holy Boys (with former Cheap Sex guitarist Chris), and punk/Oi! band Northern Towns. Gabe sings for NYC-based band Lowlands. 

Chance (Hurteau) (a.k.a. Chance Christ) had returned to being tattoo artist in 2005 under the name Chance Christ Superstar, and was tattooing in San Diego, California. He also did artwork using the name &quot;EyesoreArt&quot; for bands (most recently for the Lower Class Brats), zines, and music releases. He continued to write music and play bass, and from time to time he appeared in small music projects; but never returned to music full-time. Chance died in 2015 after a long battle with cancer.

Cheap Sex played a one-off reunion show on January 11, 2013, at The Observatory Theatre in Santa Ana, California, with Lower Class Brats, the Scarred, and Media Blitz. The show was to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of the first album, &quot;Launch Off to War&quot;, being released. All the band members currently live scattered around the US, so the band cannot be as active as it used to be. That one show led to the band re-grouping to play approximately once a year at various festivals.

<text>Beauséjour riding (formerly known as Beauséjour—Petitcodiac) is a federal electoral district in southeastern New Brunswick, Canada, which has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1988. It replaced Westmorland—Kent, which was represented from 1968 to 1988.

Beauséjour is largely Acadian and Francophone, with a significant Anglophone section in the southern section of the riding.

The riding consists of most of Westmorland County to the east and north of Moncton; and a large portion of Kent County. Major towns in the riding include Shediac, Cap-Pelé, Sackville, Bouctouche, Richibucto and the Southern and Eastern portions of Dieppe. The neighbouring ridings are Miramichi—Grand Lake, Fundy Royal, Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe, and Cumberland—Colchester in Nova Scotia; it is connected to the riding of Malpeque on Prince Edward Island by the Confederation Bridge.

==Political geography==
Westmorland—Kent was created in 1966 from Kent, and part of Westmorland that was not included in the Moncton riding. It was abolished when it was incorporated into the new riding of Beauséjour in 1987.

Beauséjour was created in 1987 primarily from Westmorland—Kent, incorporating parts of Moncton and Northumberland—Miramichi ridings. Between a 1990 by-election and 1993, it was the seat of Liberal leader and later Prime Minister Jean Chrétien.

In 1997, it was renamed &quot;Beauséjour—Petitcodiac&quot;, and expanded to include most of Albert County and the Petitcodiac area of western Westmorland County. This created a &quot;doughnut&quot; around Greater Moncton, which was a separate district.

In 2003, Beauséjour—Petitcodiac was abolished when it was redistributed into a new Beauséjour riding and into Fundy riding.

The new Beauséjour riding was created primarily from Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, incorporating parts of Miramichi and Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe ridings.

in the 2012 federal electoral redistribution, the riding lost a large portion of western Kent County to Miramichi—Grand Lake and a portion of Moncton Parish to Fundy Royal, but gained a portion of western Dieppe from Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe.

==Political history==

Former Governor General of Canada Roméo LeBlanc represented Beauséjour from 1972 to 1984. His son, Dominic LeBlanc, is its current MP.

Former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien represented Beauséjour for a short time in the early 1990s after he won the Liberal leadership. Chrétien did not have a seat in the House of Commons at the time, and the sitting MP stepped down to allow him to run in a by-election.

Since its creation, the riding has voted Liberal in every election except 1997, when it elected Angela Vautour of the New Democratic Party. Vautour switched to the Progressive Conservatives midway through her term, and was defeated in 2000.

<doc id="657602" wikidata="Q1316535" url="?curid=657602" title="Tristan Rogers">
<text>Tristan Rogers (born 3 June 1946) is an Australian-American actor. He is best known for playing Robert Scorpio on the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; and for voicing Jake in Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot;. He is currently starring as Robert Scorpio on &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

Rogers was born in Melbourne. His early acting roles were on Australian television and he completed short stints in soap operas &quot;Bellbird&quot;, &quot;Number 96&quot; (in 1974), and &quot;The Box&quot; (in 1975). He was a regular in the police drama series &quot;The Link Men&quot; (1970) which lasted for 13 episodes, and had guest roles in programs including &quot;Barrier Reef&quot;, &quot;Division 4&quot;, and the 1976 miniseries &quot;Power Without Glory&quot;. He also appeared in a few British films in the early 1970s, notably &quot;Four Dimensions of Greta&quot; (1972), &quot;The Flesh and Blood Show&quot; (1972) and &quot;Sex Farm&quot; (1973).

==United States roles==

===&quot;General Hospital&quot;===
He originally appeared on &quot;General Hospital&quot; from December 1980 until February 1992. The popularity and longevity of the character Robert Scorpio in &quot;General Hospital&quot; came as a result of his involvement with the monumentally popular &quot;supercouple&quot; Luke and Laura, whose 1981 wedding brought in 30 million viewers and remains the highest-rated hour in American soap opera history.

While Rogers&#x27; Scorpio had been &quot;killed with no body found&quot; when he left the series in 1992, Rogers returned briefly in 1995 as Scorpio&#x27;s spirit to comfort the character&#x27;s daughter Robin Scorpio (Kimberly McCullough), who is dealing with the loss of her boyfriend to an AIDS-related illness and is herself HIV-positive. He returned again in January 2006 for six weeks, this time with Scorpio being very much alive. Rogers reappeared in April 2006 and left again that November.

From 5 August 2008 through 21 October 2008, Rogers reprised the role of Robert Scorpio on the second season of SOAPnet&#x27;s &quot;General Hospital: Night Shift&quot;, a primetime spin-off of &quot;General Hospital&quot; which stars Scorpio&#x27;s daughter Robin. He was featured in 12 of the season&#x27;s 14 episodes, and &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; named the appearance their &quot;Best Return&quot; of 2008. Rogers later reappeared on &quot;General Hospital&quot; for four episodes starting 22 December 2008 as Scorpio attends Robin&#x27;s wedding.

Rogers returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Robert Scorpio on 29 February 2012 after Anna Devane (Finola Hughes) called him back to Port Charles to tell him that their daughter Robin Scorpio-Drake had been killed in a lab accident. After seven episodes, he left again on 8 March 2012. Rogers expressed disappointment. He later returned to the series on 15 November 2012 but later departed on 18 December 2012 as his character was drugged into a coma. Rogers reprised the role on 4 October 2013 as part of his on-screen daughter&#x27;s return. However, on 14 November 2013 it was announced that he would be departing the series to return to &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as Colin Atkinson. He made his last appearance on 30 January 2014.

Rogers returned to the series as Robert Scorpio on 17 December 2015 but he was also portraying Colin on &quot;Y&amp;R&quot; at the same time. He later left the series on 2 February 2016, although he briefly returned from 26 August to 9 September in the same year.

Rogers returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; in April 2018 for a story arc in which he aids Anna Devane who is trying to locate her long lost son Henrik Faison. Henrik is the unknown child that she bore in secret with the late Cesar Faison. After leaving the show on 1 June 2018, he later returned yet again from 27 July to 12 September in the same year for another story arc where Anna and Finn go missing. In 2019, he returned to the show again on 25 January and has remained on the show since then on a recurring basis.

===&quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;===
Rogers returned to daytime television on 8 December 2010 when he joined the cast of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as Colin Atkinson. He was placed on contract with the show in February 2011. However, Rogers&#x27; character was written out of the series in October 2011. He returned to the role briefly in 2012.

===Other roles===

Rogers starred in the CINE award-winning short &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; for which there are plans to develop into a feature-length film. 

He voiced Jake the kangaroo mouse in &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot;, and also gave his voice to the 2015 video game, &quot;Mad Max&quot;.

From 1997 to 1998, Rogers played bar owner Harry in &quot;Fast Track&quot;, a series about stock car racing which was filmed in Canada. Since 2010, Rogers has starred on the soap opera web series &quot;The Bay&quot; as Lex Martin. In 2019 he played Doc in the Amazon series, &quot;Studio City&quot;, a role garnered him an Emmy for Outstanding Performance by a Supporting Actor in a Digital Drama Series at the 47th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards.

He has done voice-over work representing restaurant chain Outback Steakhouse, Foster&#x27;s Lager, Reebok, Epson and others.

==Personal life==
Rogers has been married to Teresa Parkerson since 21 May 1995. They have two children: daughter Sara Jane (born 25 August 1992) and son Cale (August, 1996). He bought a home in Palm Springs, California, in 1997. He was formerly married to Barbara Meale from 7 June 1974 until 1984 when they divorced.

<text>Annus mirabilis (pl. anni mirabiles) is a Latin phrase that means &quot;marvelous year&quot;, &quot;wonderful year&quot;, or &quot;miraculous year&quot;. This term has been used to refer to several years during which events of major importance are remembered, notably Isaac Newton&#x27;s discoveries in 1665–1666 at the age of 23 and Albert Einstein&#x27;s papers published in 1905 at the age of 26. The opposite of this term is annus horribilis.

== 1345–1346 – Edward III ==

Eight years after the start of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, large-scale fighting had died down. Edward III of England decided to renew the war more vigorously in 1345. He despatched a small force to Gascony in south-west France under Henry, Earl of Derby and personally led the main English army to northern France. Edward delayed the disembarkation of his army and his fleet was scattered by a storm, rendering this offensive ineffective. Derby was spectacularly successful, winning victories at Bergerac and Auberoche. The following spring, a large French army, led by the heir to the French throne, John, Duke of Normandy, counter-attacked Derby&#x27;s forces.

Edward responded by landing an army of 10,000 men in northern Normandy. The English devastated much of Normandy and stormed and sacked Caen, slaughtering the population. They cut a swath along the left bank of the Seine to within of Paris. The English army then turned north and inflicted a heavy defeat on a French army led by their king, Philip VI, at the Battle of Crécy on 26 August 1346. They promptly exploited this by laying siege to Calais. The period from Derby&#x27;s victory outside Bergerac in late August 1345 to the start of the siege of Calais on 4 September 1346 became known as Edward III&#x27;s .

==1492 – Catholic Monarchs==
In January 1492, Isabella I and Ferdinand II, the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, completed the conquest of Granada, concluding the centuries-long Reconquista and bringing an end to Muslim rule over the Iberian Peninsula. Later that year, they would sponsor Christopher Columbus&#x27;s first voyage across the Atlantic, resulting in the discovery of the Americas on October 12.

That same year, Antonio de Nebrija published his monumental grammar of Spanish, &quot;Gramática de la lengua castellana&quot;. It is notable as the first work to focus on the grammar of a modern Western European language, rather than Latin.

== 1543 – The year of science ==

In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus published &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium,&quot; outlining his heliocentric model of the universe. This event is traditionally held to be the beginning of the wider Scientific Revolution, which saw the emergence of modern science in Europe. Andreas Vesalius also published his &quot;De humani corporis fabrica&quot; in 1543, revolutionizing the science of anatomy and the practice of medicine.

== 1625 – Spanish monarchy ==
A series of Spanish military victories on a global strategic scale obtained in 1625 during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, in important military theaters in Europe and America. These military victories were as follows: Siege of Breda, Relief of Genoa, Recapture of Bahia, Battle of San Juan and Defense of Cádiz. Those military actions were immortalized in a series of paintings in the Hall of Realms of the Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid. Thus, the “reputational” policy promoted by Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, favourite of Philip IV of Spain, was apparently confirmed by the initial success, and it was in reference to this &quot;annus mirabilis&quot; for Spanish arms that Olivares delivered probably his most famous pronouncement: &quot;God is Spanish and fights for Spain.&quot;

== 1644–1645 – Montrose ==
The military successes of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose in Scotland in the War of the Three Kingdoms during 1644–1645 are sometimes called &quot;annus mirabilis&quot;.

== 1665–1666 – The year of wonders ==
In 1665 to 1666, Isaac Newton, aged 23, made revolutionary inventions and discoveries in calculus, motion, optics and gravitation. It was in this year that Newton was alleged to have observed an apple falling from a tree (Newton&#x27;s apple), and in which he, in any case, hit upon the law of universal gravitation. He was afforded the time to work on his theories due to the closure of Cambridge University by an outbreak of the plague. He stated and proved the binomial theorem, invented calculus, formulated the universal law of gravitation, and developed a theory of color.

== 1706 – Grand Alliance ==

In 1706, the Grand Alliance arrayed against Louis XIV of France won resounding victories (the Battle of Ramillies and Siege of Turin) which, after the previous year&#x27;s failures, has been termed by James Falkner a &quot;Year of Miracles.&quot;

== 1759 – William Pitt ==

A series of victories by the British armed forces in 1759 in North America, Europe, India, and in various naval engagements caused that year to be referred to, on occasion, as William Pitt&#x27;s &quot;annus mirabilis&quot;. It was the turning point of the Seven Years&#x27; War.

== 1871 – W. G. Grace ==
According to Harry Altham, 1871 was W. G. Grace&#x27;s &quot;annus mirabilis&quot;. In all first-class matches in 1871, a total of 17 centuries were scored and Grace accounted for 10 of them, including the first century in a first-class match at Trent Bridge. He averaged 78.25 and the next-best average by a batsman playing more than a single innings was 39.57, barely more than half his figure. His aggregate for the season was 2,739 runs and this was the first time that anyone had scored 2,000 first-class runs in a season; Harry Jupp was next best with 1,068. Grace produced his season&#x27;s highlight in the South v North match at The Oval when he made his highest career score to date of 268.

== 1905 – Albert Einstein ==

It was in this year that Albert Einstein, aged 26, published important discoveries concerning the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and the famous &quot;E&quot; = &quot;mc&quot;2 equation. His four articles, collectively known as his &quot;Annus Mirabilis&quot; papers, were published in &quot;Annalen der Physik&quot; in 1905.

== 1939 – Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Year ==
1939 is considered the Annus Mirabilis of Hollywood due to the surprising number of movies released that year that are considered &quot;classics&quot; or foundational of their genre. Some of the films released in 1939 include: &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, &quot;Gunga Din&quot;, &quot;Beau Geste&quot;, &quot;Union Pacific&quot;, &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot;, &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot;, &quot;At the Circus&quot;, &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;, &quot;Ninotchka&quot;, &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot;, &quot;Midnight&quot;, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, &quot;Young Mr. Lincoln&quot;, among many others.

==2016–17 – Comebacks in sports ==
Between June 2016 and March 2017, the world of sports witnessed the largest comebacks in the history of NBA Finals, Super Bowl, and UEFA Champions League. In June 2016, LeBron James&#x27;s Cleveland Cavaliers became the first team in NBA Finals history to overcome a 3–1 deficit, thus beating a Golden State Warriors side that was coming off a record-breaking league-best record of . Eight months later, in February 2017, Tom Brady&#x27;s New England Patriots became the first team in Super Bowl history to overcome a 25 point deficit, doing so in the third quarter to beat the Atlanta Falcons 34–28. In the following month, on 8 March 2017, Lionel Messi&#x27;s FC Barcelona became the first team in Champions League history to overcome a first leg four-goal deficit to beat PSG 6–5 on aggregate. The latter two became known as &quot;28–3&quot; and &quot;la Remontada&quot;.

==2016–17 – Portugal==
Portugal is known for being &quot;the country of the 3 Fs&quot; because of Football, Fado, and Fátima, three of the most distinct parts of the Portuguese culture. Portugal managed to clinch a series of historic and unprecedented victories in all of these three aspects in 2016–17. First in football, when the Portugal national team won their first-ever major trophy at the UEFA Euro 2016 on 10 July. Ten months later, on 13 May 2017, Salvador Sobral won the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 for Portugal with the song &quot;Amar pelos dois&quot;, and in doing so, he gave Portugal its first-ever win in the contest. On that same day, Pope Francis visited Fátima on the occasion of the 100th Anniversary of the Marian Apparition of 1917. The period from Portugal&#x27;s victory at the Euros in July 2016 to the end of Pope Francis&#x27;s visit to Portugal in May 2017 became known as Portugal&#x27;s .

==Annus mirabilis of births==
*1946 saw the birth of three Presidents of the United States - Donald Trump (14 June), George W. Bush (6 July), and Bill Clinton (19 August), the most out of any year. All three were born within 10 weeks of each other during the summer, just a little more than nine months after the end of World War II.
*1963 saw the birth of four future NBA MVPs - Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Karl Malone, the most out of any year.
*1972 saw the birth of four future Ballon d&#x27;Or winners - Zinedine Zidane, Rivaldo, Luís Figo, and Pavel Nedvěd. Four winners of the most prestigious prize in world football were born in 1972, when no other year produced more than two.

<text>Bitely is an unincorporated community in Lilley Township, within Newaygo County, Michigan, in the United States. It is within the Manistee National Forest. It is near Bitely Lake, Lamoreaux Lake, Isaac Lake, Houseman Lake and several smaller lakes.

It was a station on the Chicago and West Michigan Railroad (later the Pere Marquette, then the Chesapeake and Ohio, now Marquette Rail) in 1889, and given a post office on September 13, 1889, with Archer D. Martin as its first postmaster. It was named for Steven Bitely, who built a sawmill there, but due to a typographical error, the post office was initially spelled as Biteley.

The Bitely Homecoming parade is held the third Saturday of every July.

<doc id="657611" wikidata="Q4419843" url="?curid=657611" title="John Simpson Kirkpatrick">
<text>John Kirkpatrick (6 July 1892 – 19 May 1915), commonly known as John Simpson, was a stretcher bearer with the 3rd Australian Field Ambulance during the Gallipoli campaign – the Allied attempt to capture Constantinople, capital of the Ottoman Empire, during the First World War.

After the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, Simpson used donkeys to provide first aid and carry wounded soldiers to the beach, from where they could be evacuated. He continued this work for three and a half weeks – often under fire – until he was killed by machine-gun fire during the third attack on Anzac Cove. Simpson and his donkey have become part of the Anzac legend.

==Early life==
Simpson was born on 6 July 1892 in Eldon Street, Tyne Dock, South Shields, County Durham, England, to Scottish parents: Sarah Kirkpatrick (née Simpson) and Robert Kirkpatrick. He was one of eight children, and worked with donkeys as a youth, during summer holidays. He attended Barnes Road Junior School and later Mortimer Road Senior School.

At 16, he volunteered to train as a gunner in the Territorial Force, as British Army reserve units were known at the time, and in early 1909 he joined the British merchant navy.

In May 1910, Simpson deserted his ship at Newcastle, New South Wales, and travelled widely in Australia, taking on various jobs, such as cane-cutting in Queensland and coal mining in the Illawarra district of New South Wales. In the three or so years leading up to the outbreak of the First World War, he worked as a steward, stoker and greaser on Australian coastal ships.

Simpson held, or developed, left wing political views while he worked in Australia, and wrote in a letter to his mother: &quot;I often wonder when the working men of England will wake up and see things as other people see them. What they want in England is a good revolution and that will clear some of these Millionaires and lords and Dukes out of it and then with a Labour Government they will almost be able to make their own conditions.&quot; According to former union leader Alf Rankin, there is anecdotal evidence that Simpson belonged to the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or &quot;Wobblies&quot;), a radical international labour union, although that has never been confirmed by historical documents or other sources.

==Military service==
Simpson enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force after the outbreak of war, apparently as a means of returning to England. He enlisted as &quot;John Simpson&quot;, and may have dropped his real surname to avoid being identified as a ship deserter. Simpson enlisted as a field ambulance stretcher bearer, a role only given to physically strong men, on 23 August 1914 at Swan Barracks, Francis Street, in Perth, and undertook training at Blackboy Hill Training Camp. He was assigned to the 3rd Australian Field Ambulance and the regimental number 202.

Simpson landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula on 25 April 1915 with the 3rd Field Ambulance as part of the 1st Australian Division. In the early hours of the following day, as he was bearing a wounded comrade on his shoulders, he spotted a donkey and quickly began making use of it to carry his fellow soldiers. Simpson would sing and whistle, seeming to ignore the bullets flying through the air, while he tended to his comrades.

He used at least five different donkeys, known as &quot;Duffy No. 1&quot;, &quot;Duffy No. 2&quot;, &quot;Murphy&quot;, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and &quot;Abdul&quot; at Gallipoli; some of the donkeys were killed and/or wounded in action. He and the donkeys soon became a familiar sight to the Anzacs, many of whom knew Simpson by the nicknames such as &quot;Scotty&quot; (in reference to his ancestry) and &quot;Simmy&quot;. Simpson himself was also sometimes referred to as &quot;Murphy&quot;. Other Anzac stretcher bearers began to emulate Simpson&#x27;s use of the donkeys.

Colonel (later General) John Monash wrote: &quot;Private Simpson and his little beast earned the admiration of everyone at the upper end of the valley. They worked all day and night throughout the whole period since the landing, and the help rendered to the wounded was invaluable. Simpson knew no fear and moved unconcernedly amid shrapnel and rifle fire, steadily carrying out his self-imposed task day by day, and he frequently earned the applause of the personnel for his many fearless rescues of wounded men from areas subject to rifle and shrapnel fire.&quot;

Other contemporary accounts of Simpson at Gallipoli speak of his bravery and invaluable service in bringing wounded down from the heights above Anzac Cove through Shrapnel and Monash gullies. However, his donkey service spared him the even more dangerous and arduous work of hauling seriously wounded men back from the front lines on a stretcher.

On 19 May 1915, during the Third attack on Anzac Cove, Simpson was killed by machine gun fire.

Private Victor Laidlaw, with the 2nd Field Ambulance, wrote in his diary of Simpson&#x27;s death:

He was survived by his mother and sister, who were still living in South Shields. He was buried at the Beach Cemetery.
==Commemoration, depiction and myth==
===Conflation with Richard Henderson===

Soon after his death, Simpson was being conflated with at least one other stretcher bearer using a donkey around Anzac Cove, Richard Alexander Henderson, of the New Zealand Medical Corps (NZMC). Henderson said later that he had taken over one of Simpson&#x27;s donkeys, known as &quot;Murphy&quot;.An iconic image (right) of Henderson, with a donkey at Gallipoli, has often been wrongly assumed to portray John Simpson Kirkpatrick. The image originated in a photograph taken by Sergeant James G. Jackson of the NZMC on 12 May 1915 (a week before Simpson&#x27;s death). The image became famous after Horace Moore-Jones, a New Zealand artist, who had been a member of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force at Gallipoli, painted at least six versions of it. Following the death of Simpson, Henderson continued to rescue wounded soldiers from the battlefield and was later awarded the Military Medal.

Moore-Jones&#x27; paintings have usually been referred to by titles such as &quot;Private Simpson, D.C.M., &amp; his donkey at Anzac&quot; and/or &quot;The Man with the Donkey&quot;. Many derivatives of the image, including sculptures, have appeared and a variation of it was included on three postage stamps issued in Australia in 1965 to mark the 50th anniversary of Gallipoli – on the five penny, eight penny and two shillings and three pence stamps.

== Growth of legend ==
The legend surrounding Simpson, sometimes under the misnomer &quot;Murphy&quot; grew largely from an account of his actions published in a 1916 book, &quot;Glorious Deeds of Australasians in the Great War&quot;. This was a wartime propaganda effort, and many of its stories of Simpson, supposedly rescuing 300 men and making dashes into no man&#x27;s land to carry wounded out on his back, are demonstrably untrue. In fact, transporting that many men down to the beach in the three weeks that he was at Gallipoli would have been a physical impossibility, given the time the journey took. However, the stories presented in the book were widely and uncritically accepted by many people, including the authors of some subsequent books on Simpson.

===Popular culture===
A silent film based on Simpson&#x27;s exploits, &quot;Murphy of Anzac&quot;, was released in 1916.

His life inspired the 1938 radio play &quot;The Man with the Donkey&quot;.

In 1965, in the lead up to the fiftieth anniversary of Gallipoli, there were calls for a commemorative medal for veterans of the Gallipoli campaign and/or the award of a late Victoria Cross to Simpson. Both proposals were rejected by the Australian Federal Government in 1965. In January 1966, Robert Menzies who had been Prime Minister of Australia since 1949 retired and was replaced by Harold Holt. The new government soon announced that Australia would present to Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy veterans of the Gallipoli campaign in 1915, an Anzac Commemorative Medal. Both living veterans and next of kin of deceased veterans could apply for the medallion but only living veterans would receive a lapel badge. The first medallions were issued to Gallipoli veterans shortly before Anzac Day 1967. The medallion and lapel badge featured Simpson and his donkey. They were also portrayed on a series of Anzac postage stamps issued on 14 April 1965.

In 1977, a donkey &quot;joined&quot; the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps, under the name &quot;Jeremy Jeremiah Simpson&quot;, with the rank of Private and the regimental number MA 0090. In 1986, this particular donkey was permanently adopted as the official mascot of the corps.

Simpson featured in an episode of the television show &quot;Michael Willessee&#x27;s Australians&quot; called &quot;Private John Simpson&quot; in 1988. 

At least two songs have been written about him: &quot;John Simpson Kirkpatrick&quot; by Issy and David Emeney with Kate Riaz, on the album &quot;Legends and Lovers&quot;, and &quot;Jackie and Murphy&quot; by Martin Simpson on the album &quot;Vagrant Stanzas&quot;.

The Australian RSPCA, in May 1997 posthumously awarded its Purple Cross to the donkey Murphy for performing outstanding acts of bravery towards humans.

In 2011, a play by Valerie Laws entitled &quot;The Man and the Donkey&quot; premiered at the Customs House in South Shields. The part of John Simpson Kirkpatrick was played by local actor Jamie Brown.

On 19 May 2015, the Australian High Commissioner, Alexander Downer, visited South Shields as part of special celebrations marking 100 years to the day that John Simpson Kirkpatrick was killed in action.

===Campaign to award Simpson the Victoria Cross===
There have been several petitions over the decades to have Simpson awarded a Victoria Cross (VC) or a Victoria Cross for Australia. There is a persistent myth that he was recommended for a VC, but that this was either refused or mishandled by the military bureaucracy. However, there is no documentary evidence that such a recommendation was ever made. The case for Simpson being awarded a VC is based on diary entries by his commanding officer that express the hope he would receive either a Distinguished Conduct Medal or VC. However, the officer in question never made a formal recommendation for either of these medals. Simpson&#x27;s Mention in Despatches was consistent with the recognition given to other men who performed the same role at Gallipoli.

In April 2011, the Australian Government announced that Simpson would be one of thirteen servicemen examined in an inquiry into &quot;Unresolved Recognition for Past Acts of Naval and Military Gallantry and Valour&quot;. The tribunal for this inquiry was directed to make recommendations on the awarding of decorations, including the Victoria Cross. Concluding its investigations in February 2013, the tribunal recommended that no further award be made to Simpson, since his &quot;initiative and bravery were representative of all other stretcher-bearers of 3rd Field Ambulance, and that bravery was appropriately recognised as such by the award of an MID.&quot;

<text>The International Etchells Class is one-design sailboat racing class, designed by American Skip Etchells.

==Production==
The first 36 boats were built by Skip Etchells and the Old Greenwich Boat Company between 1967 and 1969. In the early 1970s Skip Etchells finished hulls which were moulded for him by Tillotson-Pearson.

Since being established as a one-design class, boats have been built by numerous other manufacturers, including Bashford Boat Builders (later known as Sydney Yachts), Pamcraft and Phil Smidmore (trading as Pacesetter Etchells PTY.) in Australia, Ontario Yachts in Canada, and Robertson and Sons Ltd., David Heritage Racing Yachts and Petticrows Limited, all in the United Kingdom.

===Mold 11 controversy===
In 2010, the International Etchells Class Association of Australia was granted permission to build a new mold for the production of Etchells hulls. At the time there were three other molds being used - mold #8 was used by Ontario Yachts; mold #9 by Bashford and then Smidmore; Heritage and Petticrows used mold #10.

The three existing molds were made from the same plug, but 3D scans made by the One Design Technical Committee (ODTC) between 2005 and 2008 showed variations between the hulls they produced, and ODTC had since expressed the desire to standardise on a single hull form which would be used in the production of all future molds.

The Australian Association proposed basing the new mold on the Heritage one - this would ensure hull conformity between the two manufacturers, and supposed that Ontario Yachts would adopt the same shape when replacing their mold in the future. Instead permission was granted to produce a mold based on the ODTC&#x27;s 3D scanning data, an average or composite of the three existing hull forms that made up the majority of the worldwide racing fleets; the existent data was not complete enough for this, and further scanning was required.

The mold was licensed to Pacesetter Yachts and used to manufacture 24 or 25 hulls over a period of about a decade. Although the ODTC expressed concern about a scan of the second hull produced by the new mold, a report by the Etchells Class Chief Measurer stated &quot;The Etchells made from Mould 11 are in every way an Etchells in accordance with the Etchells Class Rules, Tolerances and Specifications.&quot;

It was not until Australian success at the 2019 Etchells World Championship that questions were raised about the hulls produced by mold #11, and in 2021 the newly elected International Governing Committee (IGC) of the International Etchells Class Association (IECA) declared that boats built with it were &quot;effectively not Etchells Class yachts&quot; and ineligible to compete in the class.

The justification for this decision was that mold #11 had never been approved by World Sailing, but it also claimed &quot;It has … been discovered by scans and floatation tests of boats from all three moulds that M11 produces boats which have a longer water line, less rocker, are flatter in the middle and fuller in the ends. The differences are material, far greater than can be explained away by minor variances due to manufacturing tolerances.&quot;

The IGC statement implied that the Australian Association were responsible for the differences, that mold #11 was &quot;produced … by massaging scan data which came from the official plug, obviating the need to ship the plug to Australia&quot;, that &quot;the method approved by the IGC&quot; had not been followed, and that it was a &quot;deviation&quot; from the class rules. The president of the International Etchells Class Association of Australia called this &quot;a distorted, misleading and biased view of the facts… in many material respects grossly wrong.&quot;

It emerged that the class association and World Sailing had no records of approval of molds #8, #9 and #10, thus calling into doubt the entitlement of other boats to compete in the class - boats from all current Etchells builders would be affected, including those from Ontario Yachts and David Heritage. On 30 September, owners of mold #11 boats wrote to the International Etchells Class Association demanding they reverse their decision or apply it equally to the other boats.

On 9 October 2021 World Sailing CEO David Graham, in a letter to the International Etchells Class Association, stated that there are clear issues with Mould 11, that World Sailing has no record of any approval of Mould 11, that measurement alone does not make a boat an Etchells, that it appears Mould 11 is materially different from other moulds and plugs, and that all hulls from Mould 11 have in fact been produced by Innovation Composites, rather than Pacesetter Yachts, which means they have been built by an unauthorised builder. Graham also noted that if Pacesetter Yachts had subcontracted the building of the boats, or transferred tooling, to another party, then Pacesetter Yachts was in breach of its licence.

== Design ==
In 1965, Yachting Magazine launched a competition to select a new three-man Olympic keelboat. E. W. &quot;Skip&quot; Etchells, a boat designer, builder and sailor, was interested in the competition, but refrained from producing a design until the trials were announced. However, once the details became available, he built the wooden Shillalah, taking her to Kiel, Germany, where the trials were to be held in the fall of 1966.

Shillalah performed well at the trials, winning eight of the ten races. Nevertheless, the judges were unable to agree on a winner, and thus a second set of trials were held in Travemünde the following year. For these trials Etchells rebuilt the boat in fiberglass, using the original Shillalah as a plug. As with the first trials, Shillalah II (as the new boat was named) dominated the races, winning ten out of the thirteen that were held, and only just missing out on an eleventh.

At the completion of the trials the judges chose the Soling over Shillalah II, in spite of her success in the races. However, the boat&#x27;s performance had won converts, and shortly thereafter the boat entered production with orders for an initial 12 boats. With the formation of a new association the class became known as the E22, and 32 boats were built by Etchells&#x27; company by the end of 1969. The E22 was recognised as an International class by the International Yacht Racing Union in 1974, and the name was changed to &quot;International Etchells&quot; in 1990.

The Etchells is a racing keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass. It has a fractional sloop rig, a spooned raked stem, a raised counter reverse transom, a skeg-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of lead ballast.

The boat has a draft of with the standard keel.

Designed for racer and day sailing, the boat has a small cuddy cabin without bunks, designed for stowage only.

For sailing the boat has a central control console that gathers many of the sail controls. These include the 8:1 mechanical advantage jib halyard, 4:1 Cunningham, 4:1 mainsheet, foreguy and the topping lift. Other controls are led to the cuddy cabin&#x27;s aft bulkhead, including the 2:1 course jib sheet, 6:1 fine jib tuner, 2:1 barber hauler and the spinnaker halyard. There is also a 6:1 adjustable backstay and a mainsheet traveler.

<text>Tamyra Monica Gray (born July 26, 1979) is an American actress, singer and songwriter, who finished fourth place on the first season of the musical reality competition &quot;American Idol&quot; in 2002. Post &quot;American Idol&quot;, Gray has begun acting on Broadway and television. She had a recurring role on the third season of the drama series &quot;Boston Public&quot; in early 2003.

==Personal life==
Gray was born in Takoma Park, Maryland, and later moved to Norcross, Georgia. She graduated from Stone Mountain High School in Stone Mountain, Georgia in 1997. She began singing at an early age. She competed in several beauty pageants and was named Miss Atlanta in 1998. Gray attended Georgia State University, majoring in business law and entertainment management. Prior to &quot;American Idol&quot;, she worked a variety of jobs including daycare worker, party motivator, telemarketer, waitress, and running her own cleaning service. She also filmed Coca-Cola commercials and worked with artists like her friend Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes and rapper DMX with hopes of finding an opening into the entertainment industry.

Gray married Color Me Badd singer Sam Watters (whom she worked with on &quot;The Dreamer&quot;) on September 2, 2006, in Capri, Italy. About 45 guests were in attendance, including her then-manager, Lisa Braude. Gray&#x27;s photographer sold the wedding photos to American press, and the low-key relationship soon became public after &quot;People&quot; broke the story. She is now stepmom to Kieran, Sam&#x27;s son from a previous marriage. On March 23, 2010, Gray announced to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that she was expecting her first baby with Watters. On July 17, 2010, Gray gave birth to daughter Sienna Marie.

==&quot;American Idol&quot;==
In 2002, Gray became one of the ten finalists on the first season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, eventually finishing fourth. Her performance of the Burt Bacharach classic &quot;A House Is Not a Home&quot; was described by Judge Simon Cowell as &quot;one of the best performances on television&quot; that he had ever seen.

Gray was also featured on two tracks on the &quot;American Idol&quot; Christmas CD—a solo version of &quot;Silent Night&quot; and a duet version of &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; with Ruben Studdard. She also appeared on the Idol Christmas Special on Fox with Clarkson, Studdard, and other finalists from the first two Idol seasons.

During the third season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, she returned to the show on several occasions to sing &quot;Raindrops Will Fall&quot; and &quot;Star&quot;, songs she co-wrote for her debut album, and to sing the National Anthem to open the final results show of the season. Gray also co-wrote the &quot;American Idol&quot; season three single &quot;I Believe&quot;, which was performed by Idol finalists Fantasia Barrino and Diana DeGarmo. Barrino then released &quot;I Believe&quot; as her &quot;American Idol&quot; single, which debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Charts.

===List of performances on &quot;American Idol&quot;===

**Theme: Burt Bacharach Songs
*August 20, 2002 &quot;New Attitude&quot; by Patti LaBelle and &quot;Feel the Fire&quot; by Stephanie Mills

During the season, many critics and fans thought that Tamyra would make it to the finals, and perhaps win. However, on August 21, Tamyra was placed in the Bottom 2 (along with Nikki McKibbin), and then eliminated from the show. The judges expressed their shock at the audience decision, while making supportive comments to Gray.

==Music career==
In 1998, Gray provided background vocals on DMX&#x27;s song &quot;Slippin&#x27;.&quot; After &quot;American Idol&quot;, creator Simon Fuller signed Tamyra to his newly formed independent record label, 19 Records, a division of his 19 Management, Gray&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;The Dreamer&quot;, which Gray wrote herself, was eventually released on May 25, 2004. The album sold 39,000 copies during its first week in release and has sold 122,000 to date. The H. Hector and J. Vasquez mixes of Tamyra&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Raindrops Will Fall,&quot; peaked at number five on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart; another set of remixes of the same song also hit number nine on that chart. Gray later parted ways with 19 Entertainment but remains close with Fuller, who attended her wedding to Sam Watters in Capri, Italy.

Gray performed a duet with American Idol season one winner Kelly Clarkson on Clarkson&#x27;s debut release &quot;Thankful&quot;. The song, entitled &quot;You Thought Wrong,&quot; was co-written by Gray but never released as a single.

Gray was a co-writer and back-up singer on Jessica Simpson&#x27;s album &quot;A Public Affair&quot;, which was released August 29, 2006. She is listed fourth in writing credits on the songs &quot;If You Were Mine&quot; and &quot;The Lover in Me&quot;, and sang back-up on &quot;If You Were Mine&quot; . The CD debuted on Billboard&#x27;s 200 Chart at number five.

Gray also co-wrote the number one &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 song &quot;I Believe.&quot;

Gray was reported to be in the process of recording a new album. Gray called it more club-friendly, hip-hop-based project than her debut. She is also in the process of finding a record label. Tamyra tweeted that she was in the studio recording a new album with Ryan Tedder and the production team The Runaways which her husband Sam Watters is part of. They had planned to release her album through a major label in 2010.

==Acting career==
She landed the recurring role of Aisha Clemens, a student in an abusive relationship, on &quot;Boston Public&quot;, appearing in seven episodes in 2003. She showcased her singing abilities, famously covering Luther Vandross&#x27; &quot;Dance With My Father&quot; and Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;. She has had guest roles on episodes of &quot;Half &amp; Half&quot;, &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;Tru Calling&quot;, &quot;What I Like About You (TV series)&quot;, &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot; and &quot;All Of Us&quot;. With other &quot;American Idol&quot; alumni, she appeared on &quot;The Tyra Banks Show&quot; in 2006.

She has starred on Broadway twice. In November 2004, Gray was cast for a limited engagement of twelve weeks in the role of Priya in Broadway&#x27;s struggling &quot;Bombay Dreams&quot;. Due to continued poor grosses, the show closed early on January 1, 2005. She joined the cast of &quot;Rent&quot; as Mimi Marquez on May 29, 2007, and was scheduled to play the role until November 25, 2007, however, that six-month contract was extended. Gray performed in &quot;Rent&quot; until June 15, 2008, and was replaced by Renée Elise Goldsberry.
In October 2005, Gray made her big screen supporting role debut in the independent film &quot;The Gospel&quot;, which debuted at No. 5 at the box office, and also had strong DVD sales when it was released to stores on January 3, 2006. Gray has one song, &quot;Now Behold the Lamb&quot;, featured on the movie&#x27;s soundtrack, which climbed to No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s Soundtrack Chart. Her second movie role was in the 2008 movie &quot;Rachel Getting Married&quot;.

Also in 2005, Gray appeared in a short film for H&amp;M&#x27;s new line of denim jeans, and performed the &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; show stopper &quot;And I Am Telling You I&#x27;m Not Going&quot;. Tamyra was featured in print advertisements for the H&amp;M denim and her version of the song played in H&amp;M stores.

In 2011, Gray starred in the musical &quot;Twist,&quot; a theatrical version of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; set in New Orleans during the Depression, that was produced by Debbie Allen at the Pasadena Playhouse in Pasadena, California. The musical was scheduled to run from June 14 to July 17, but was extended through July 24 due to strong ticket sales and a string of sold-out shows. In January 2016, she took over the role of Kate on the national tour of &quot;If/Then&quot;. On January 8, 2018, she took over the role of Papa Ge in the 2018 revival of &quot;Once on This Island&quot;.

<text>The Outline of History, subtitled either &quot;The Whole Story of Man&quot; or &quot;Being a Plain History of Life and Mankind&quot;, is a work by H. G. Wells chronicling the history of the world from the origin of the Earth to the First World War. It appeared in an illustrated version of 24 fortnightly installments beginning on 22 November 1919 and was published as a single volume in 1920. It sold more than two million copies, was translated into many languages, and had a considerable impact on the teaching of history in institutions of higher education. Wells modelled the &quot;Outline&quot; on the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; of Denis Diderot.

== Revised editions ==
Many revised versions were published during Wells&#x27;s lifetime, and the author kept notes on factual corrections which he received from around the world. The last revision which was published during his lifetime was published in 1937.

In 1949, an expanded version was produced by Raymond Postgate, who extended the narrative so it could include the Second World War, and later, he published another version which extended the narrative up to 1969. Postgate wrote that &quot;readers wish to hear the views of Wells, not those of Postgate,&quot; and he endeavoured to preserve Wells&#x27;s voice throughout the narrative. In later editions G. P. Wells, the author&#x27;s son, updated the early chapters about prehistory in order to make them reflect current theories: previous editions had, for instance, given credence to Piltdown Man before it was exposed as a hoax. The final edition appeared in 1971, but earlier editions are still in print.

== Organization of the work ==
The third revised and rearranged edition is organized in chapters whose subjects are as follows:
== Overarching themes ==
=== History as a quest for a common purpose ===
From Neolithic times (12,000–10,000 years ago, by Wells&#x27;s estimation) &quot;[t]he history of mankind . . . is a history of more or less blind endeavours to conceive a common purpose in relation to which all men may live happily, and to create and develop a common stock of knowledge which may serve and illuminate that purpose.&quot;

=== Recurrent conquest of civilization by nomads ===
Wells was uncertain whether to place &quot;the beginnings of settled communities living in towns&quot; in Mesopotamia or Egypt. He was equally unsure whether to consider the development of civilization as something that arose from &quot;the widely diffused Heliolithic Neolithic culture&quot; or something that arose separately. Between the nomadic cultures that originated in the Neolithic Age and the settled civilizations to the south, he discerned that &quot;for many thousands of years there has been an almost rhythmic recurrence of conquest of the civilizations by the nomads.&quot; According to Wells, this dialectical antagonism reflected not only a struggle for power and resources, but a conflict of values: &quot;Civilization, as this outline has shown, arose as a community of obedience, and was essentially a community of obedience. But . . . [t]here was a continual influx of masterful will from the forests, parklands, and steppes. The human spirit had at last rebelled altogether against the blind obedience of the common life; it was seeking . . . to achieve a new and better sort of civilization that should also be a community of will.&quot; Wells regarded the democratic movements of modernity as an aspect of this movement.

=== Development of free intelligence ===
Wells saw in the bards who were, he believed, common to all the &quot;Aryan-speaking peoples&quot; an important &quot;consequence of and a further factor in [the] development of spoken language which was the chief factor of all the human advances made in Neolithic times. . . . they mark a new step forward in the power and range of the human mind,&quot; extending the temporal horizons of the human imagination. He saw in the ancient Greeks another definitive advance of these capacities, &quot;the beginnings of what is becoming at last nowadays a dominant power in human affairs, the &#x27;free intelligence of mankind&#x27;.&quot; The first individual he distinguishes as embodying free intelligence is the Greek historian Herodotus. The Hebrew prophets and the tradition they founded he calls &quot;a parallel development of the free conscience of mankind.&quot; Much later, he singles out Roger Bacon as a precursor of &quot;a great movement in Europe . . . toward reality&quot; that contributed to the development of &quot;intelligence&quot;. But &quot;[i]t was only in the eighties of the nineteenth century that this body of inquiry began to yield results to impress the vulgar mind. Then suddenly came electric light and electric traction, and the transmutation of forces, the possibility of sending &quot;power&quot; . . . began to come through to the ideas of ordinary people.&quot;

=== Rejection of racial or cultural superiority ===
Although a few passages in &quot;The Outline of History&quot; reflect racialist thinking, Wells firmly rejected all theories of racial and civilizational superiority. On the subject of race, Wells writes that &quot;Mankind from the point of view of a biologist is an animal species in a state of arrested differentiation and possible admixture . . . [A]ll races are more or less mixed.&quot;. As for the claim that Western minds are superior, he states that upon examination &quot;this generalization . . . dissolves into thin air.&quot;

== Composition of the work ==
=== Wells&#x27;s methodology ===
In the years leading up to the writing of &quot;The Outline of History&quot;, Wells was increasingly preoccupied by history, as many works testify. (See, for example, &quot;The New Machiavelli&quot;, &quot;Marriage&quot;, &quot;An Englishman Looks at the World&quot;, &quot;The Wife of Sir Isaac Harman&quot;, &quot;Mr. Britling Sees It Through&quot;, etc.) During World War I, he tried to promote a world history to be sponsored by the League of Nations Union, of which he was a member. But no professional historian would commit to undertake it, and Wells, in a financially sound position thanks to the success of &quot;Mr. Britling Sees It Through&quot; and believing that his work would earn little, resolved to devote a year to the project. His wife Catherine (Jane) agreed to be his collaborator in typing, research, organization, correspondence, and criticism. Wells relied heavily on the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (11th ed., 1911), and standard secondary texts. He made use of the London Library, and enlisted as critical readers &quot;a team of advisers for comment and correction, chief among them Ernest Barker, Harry Johnston, E. Ray Lankester, and Gilbert Murray. The sections were then rewritten and circulated for further discussion until Wells judged that they had reached a satisfactory standard.&quot; The bulk of the work was written between October 1918 and November 1919.

=== Rejected allegations of plagiarism ===
In 1927 a Canadian, Florence Deeks, sued Wells for infringement of copyright and breach of trust. She claimed that he had plagiarized much of the content of &quot;The Outline of History&quot; from her work, &quot;The Web of the World&#x27;s Romance&quot;. She had submitted her manuscript to the Canadian publisher Macmillan Canada, which was Wells&#x27;s Canadian publisher. Macmillan Canada had the manuscript for nearly nine months before rejecting it. 

At trial in the Supreme Court of Ontario, Deeks called called three literary academics as experts, who testified that the content and structure of the two books showed that Wells must have relied on Deeks&#x27;s manuscript in writing &quot;The Outline of History&quot;. Wells testified, and denied that he had ever seen Deeks&#x27;s manuscript, while representatives from Macmillan testified that the manuscript had never left Canada. The trial judge rejected Deeks&#x27;s expert evidence and dismissed the case. An appeal to the Ontario Appellate Division was dismissed, as was a final appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the highest court of appeal for the British Empire.

In 2000, a professor of history at Carleton University, Ottawa, wrote a book entitled &quot;The Spinster &amp; the Prophet: Florence Deeks, H. G. Wells, and the Mystery of the Purloined Past&quot;, which examined the legal case brought by Deeks. McKillop&#x27;s thesis was that Deeks did not receive fair treatment from the courts, which he argued heavily favoured men at that time, both in Canada and in Britain.

In 2004 Denis N. Magnusson, professor emeritus in the Faculty of Law, Queen&#x27;s University, Kingston, Ontario, published an article on &quot;Deeks v. Wells&quot; in the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Law Journal&quot;. He took issue with McKillop&#x27;s position, arguing that Deeks had a weak case that was not well presented, and though she may have met with sexism from her lawyers, she did receive a fair trial. He argued that the law applied in the case was essentially the same law that would be applied to a similar case in 2004.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Outline of History&quot; has inspired responses from the serious to the parodic.

* In 1921 Algonquin Round Table member Donald Ogden Stewart achieved his first success with a satire entitled &quot;A Parody Outline of History&quot;.
* &quot;The Outline of History&quot; was praised on publication by E. M. Forster and Beatrice Webb.
*Edward Shanks described &quot;The Outline&quot; as &quot;a wonderful book&quot;. However, he also criticized what he saw as Wells&#x27;s &quot;impatience&quot; and stated &quot;it is an unfortunate fact that Mr. Wells often seems to find himself in the position of scold to the entire human race&quot;.
* American historians James Harvey Robinson and Carl Becker lauded the &quot;Outline&quot; and hailed Wells as &quot;a formidable ally&quot;.
* In 1925 G. K. Chesterton, wrote &quot;The Everlasting Man&quot;, a critique of &quot;The Outline of History&quot; from a Catholic perspective. 
* In 1926 Hilaire Belloc wrote &quot;A Companion to Mr. Wells&#x27;s &quot;Outline of History&quot;&quot;. A devout Catholic, Belloc was deeply offended by Wells&#x27;s treatment of Christianity in &quot;The Outline of History&quot;. Wells wrote a short book in rebuttal called &quot;Mr. Belloc Objects to &quot;The Outline of History&quot;.&quot; In 1926, Belloc published his reply, &quot;Mr. Belloc Still Objects&quot;.
* In 1934 Arnold J. Toynbee dismissed the criticism of &quot;The Outline of History&quot; and praised Wells&#x27;s work in his &quot;A Study of History&quot;: Mr. H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The Outline of History&quot; was received with unmistakable hostility by a number of historical specialists. . . . They seemed not to realize that, in re-living the entire life of Mankind as a single imaginative experience, Mr. Wells was achieving something which they themselves would hardly have dared to attempt ... In fact, the purpose and value of Mr. Wells&#x27;s book seem to have been better appreciated by the general public than by the professional historians of the day. Toynbee went on to refer to &quot;The Outline&quot; several times in &quot;A Study of History&quot;, offering his share of criticism but maintaining a generally positive view of the book.
*Also in 1934 Jawaharlal Nehru stated that &quot;The Outline of History&quot; was a major influence on his own work, &quot;Glimpses of World History&quot;.
* After Wells&#x27;s death &quot;The Outline&quot; was still the object of admiration from historians A. J. P. Taylor (who called it &quot;the best&quot; general survey of history) and Norman Stone, who praised Wells for largely avoiding the Eurocentric and racist attitudes of his time.
* In his autobiography Christopher Isherwood recalled that when he and W. H. Auden encountered Napoleon&#x27;s tomb on a 1922 school trip to France, their first reaction was to quote &quot;The Outline&#x27;s&quot; negative assessment of the French ruler.
*Malham Wakin, head of the philosophy department at the United States Air Force Academy, encouraged his students to consider and challenge a statement made by Wells in &quot;The Outline of History&quot;: &quot;The professional military mind is by necessity an inferior and unimaginative mind; no man of high intellectual quality would willingly imprison his gifts in such a calling.&quot;

==Censorship==
&quot;The Outline of History&quot; was one of the first of Wells&#x27; books to be banned in Nazi Germany.

== In popular culture ==
* In Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s 1930 book &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; Casper Gutman says, &quot;These are facts, historical facts, not schoolbook history, not Mr. Wells&#x27;s history, but history nevertheless.&quot;
* In Virginia Woolf&#x27;s posthumously published 1941 novel &quot;Between the Acts&quot; the character Lucy Swithin reads a book entitled &quot;The Outline of History&quot;. 
* In John Huston&#x27;s 1941 film &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; Kasper Gutman played by Sydney Greenstreet says &quot;These are facts, historical facts, not schoolbook history, not Mr. Wells&#x27;s history, but history nevertheless.&quot;
* In Fredric Brown&#x27;s 1949 science-fiction novel &quot;What Mad Universe&quot; the protagonist finds himself transported to an alternate universe. Finding a copy of Wells&#x27;s &quot;Outline of History&quot;, it turns out to be identical to the one he knows until 1903, at which point the alternate Wells records the invention of anti-gravity, a fast human expansion into space, a brutal war for the conquest of Mars which Wells strongly denounces, followed by a titanic conflict with Arcturus.
* In Satyajit Ray&#x27;s 1959 film &quot;The World of Apu&quot; the book, wrapped in a white cloth cover with only the title visible, is seen on the bookshelf of the protagonist Apurba Roy.
* In John Updike&#x27;s 1961 story &quot;Pigeon Feathers&quot; the young protagonist finds a copy of &quot;Outline of History&quot; and is surprised and disturbed by Wells&#x27;s descriptions of Jesus. Updike describes Wells&#x27;s account of Jesus as:
He had been an obscure political agitator, a kind of hobo, in a minor colony of the Roman Empire. By an accident impossible to reconstruct, he (the small h horrified David) survived his own crucifixion and presumably died a few weeks later. A religion was founded on the freakish incident. The credulous imagination of the times retrospectively assigned miracles and supernatural pretensions to Jesus; a myth grew, and then a church, whose theology at most points was in direct contradiction of the simple, rather communistic teachings of the Galilean.
* William Golding used Wells&#x27;s description of the Neanderthals as a basis in creating his own Neanderthal tribe in his 1955 novel, &quot;The Inheritors&quot;.

<text>Stephen Anthony Cambone (born June 22, 1952) was the first United States Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, a post created in March 2003. Cambone first came to the attention of the public at large during the testimony of Major General Antonio Taguba before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, where he disputed the General&#x27;s statement that prison guards were under the effective control of military intelligence personnel and interrogators. Cambone resigned at the beginning of 2007 and was replaced by James R. Clapper, Jr., former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Cambone was associated with the Project for the New American Century, participating in the study which resulted in the writing of the report Rebuilding America&#x27;s Defenses.

==Early life and career==
Cambone graduated from The Catholic University of America in 1973 with a BA in political science and from the Claremont Graduate School in 1977 and 1982 with an MA and PhD respectively, both in political science. His awards include the Secretary of Defense Award for Outstanding Service in 1993 and the Employee of the Year Award with SRS Technologies (Washington Operations) in 1988.

Cambone was the Staff Director for the commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization from July 2000 to January 2001. He was the Director of Research at the Institute for National Strategic Studies, National Defense University from August 1998 to July 2000. Before that he was the Staff Director for the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States from January 1998 to July 1998; a Senior Fellow in Political-Military Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) from 1993 to 1998; the Director for Strategic Defense Policy in the Office of the Secretary of Defense from 1990 to 1993; the deputy director, Strategic Analysis, SRS Technologies (Washington Operations) from 1986 to 1990; and a Staff Member in the Office of the Director, Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1982 to 1986.

==Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence==
Cambone was confirmed by the United States Senate as the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence on March 7, 2003. Prior to March 7, he was the Director, Program Analysis and Evaluation, Office of the Secretary of Defense. Dr. Cambone held that position since July 1, 2002. On July 19, 2001, he was confirmed by the United States Senate as the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. He held that position until July 1, 2002. Prior to that, he served as The Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense and Deputy Secretary of Defense from January 2001 to July 2001.

In January 2001, as George W. Bush prepared to take office, Cambone served on a panel for nuclear weapons issues sponsored by the National Institute for Public Policy, a conservative think tank. Other members of the panel included Stephen Hadley, William Schneider, Jr., and Robert Joseph. This panel advocated using tactical nuclear weapons as a standard part of the United States defense arsenal.

Cambone resigned his post on December 31, 2006.

<doc id="657649" wikidata="Q3875142" url="?curid=657649" title="Never Surrender (album)">
<text>Never Surrender is the sixth studio album by Canadian hard rock band Triumph, released in 1982. The album reached #26 on the Billboard Albums chart assisted by the singles &quot;All the Way&quot;, &quot;A World of Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Never Surrender&quot; which hit #2, #3 and #23, respectively, on the Billboard&#x27;s Mainstream Top Rock Tracks chart in 1983. &quot;All the Way&quot; (the third of the three tracks to chart) was Triumph&#x27;s highest charting song on the Top Rock Tracks chart, but did not sustain that level of popularity with Triumph fans as the song is not included on their 1985 live album &quot;Stages&quot;, the later &quot;Classics&quot; (a Greatest Hits album) or 2005&#x27;s &quot;Livin&#x27; for the Weekend: The Anthology&quot; album.

In Canada, the album peaked at No. 29 on the RPM album chart (compared to No. 13 for their previous album, &quot;Allied Forces&quot;) and none of the singles managed to reach the Top 100 of the RPM Singles chart, although they received some airplay at album-oriented rock stations.

A remastered CD was first released in 1985 on MCA Records (then again in 1995 on the band&#x27;s own TRC label). A new remaster was released in November 2004 on the band&#x27;s own label TML Entertainment.

<text>The TI-82 is a graphing calculator made by Texas Instruments. The TI-82 was designed in 1993 as an upgraded version of and replacement for the TI-81. It was the direct predecessor of the TI-83. It shares with the TI-85 a 6 MHz Zilog Z80 microprocessor. Like the TI-81, the TI-82 features a 96×64 pixel display, and the core feature set of the TI-81 with many new features.

==Features==
The TI-82 is powered by the same processor that powered its cousin, the TI-85, a 6 MHz Zilog Z80 microprocessor. This was an improvement over the TI-81&#x27;s 2 MHz Z80 processor. In addition, the available RAM was increased more than tenfold – from 2400 bytes to 28734 bytes (slightly more than the TI-85).

Some of the more notable improvements of the TI-82 over the TI-81 include the following: the addition of a link port to enable programs and other data to be transferred between two calculators or between a calculator and a computer; the addition of two new graphing types – polar and sequence, the addition of a new type of data – the list, the expansion of the size limit of matrices to 50×50, and the (unintentional) addition of the ability to program the calculator in assembly language. The last of these provided a significant boost in interest in the programmability of the calculator, as the use of assembly language (as opposed to Texas Instruments&#x27; own TI-BASIC) enabled significantly more performance and flexibility with the programs able to be used on the calculator.

Carried over from the TI-81 is the TI-82&#x27;s power source – four AAA batteries and one CR1616 or CR1620 lithium backup battery (to ensure programs stored in RAM persist when the AAA batteries are being changed).

===Design changes===
The TI-82 was redesigned twice, first in 1999 and again in 2001. The 1999 redesign introduced a design very similar to the TI-73, TI-83 Plus, and the TI-89. It introduced a more contoured body and eliminated the sloped screen that has been common on TI graphing calculators since the TI-81. The 2001 redesign (nicknamed the TI-82 &quot;Parcus&quot;) introduced a slightly different shape to the calculator, eliminated the glossy screen border, and reduced cost by streamlining the printed circuit board to four units.

===TI-82 STATS===
An enhanced version of the TI-82, the TI-82 STATS, was first released in 2004 in Europe. There are several improvements, most notably the statistical features as the name would suggest. In addition, it featured numerical differentiation and integration, together with complex numbers, financial functions and other improvements. In specification terms, it is virtually identical to the TI-83.

===Technical specifications===

<text>The TI-81 was the first graphing calculator made by Texas Instruments. It was designed in 1990 for use in algebra and precalculus courses. Since its release, it has been superseded by a series of newer calculators: the TI-85, TI-82, TI-83, TI-86, TI-83 Plus, TI-83 Plus Silver Edition, TI-84 Plus, TI-84 Plus Silver Edition, TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition, TI-Nspire, TI-Nspire CAS, TI-84 Plus CE, and most recently, the TI-84 Plus CE Python. Most of them share the original feature set and 96×64-pixel display that began with this calculator, with the exceptions of the TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition and the TI-84 Plus CE family.

==Features==
The TI-81 is powered by a Zilog Z80 microprocessor, like those used in almost every other Texas Instruments graphing calculator (except the TI-80, TI-89, TI-89 Titanium, TI-92, TI-92 Plus, Voyage 200 and TI-Nspire series). However, the processor is clocked at 2 MHz whereas the other Z80-powered Texas Instruments calculators run at speeds of at least 6 MHz (the TI-83 Plus Silver Edition, TI-84 Plus, and TI-84 Plus Silver Edition can run at 15 MHz). It contains 2400 bytes of user RAM, with additional RAM used internally by the calculator firmware software system.

The TI-81&#x27;s user interactions are provided by its so-called Equation Operation System. This is comparable to the interface provided by the more recent TI-82, TI-83, and so on. This system is capable of such tasks as two-dimensional parametric graphing (in addition to standard two-dimensional function graphing), trigonometric calculations in units of either degrees or radians, simple drawing capabilities, creation and manipulation of matrices up to 6x6 in size, and programming in a proprietary statement-based language.

In late 2009 an exploit was found that can be used to execute machine code on the TI-81, using manual input of code. The TI-81 has no data link interface; its only means of input and output are the keyboard and screen.

As with its successors, the TI-81 is powered by four AAA batteries and one CR1616 or CR1620 lithium backup battery (to ensure programs are persistent when the AAA batteries are being changed). Some early TI-81 units omit the backup battery; if the AAA batteries of one of these units are changed one at a time and quickly, the memory contents are still retained.

Texas Instruments distributes software which emulates the TI-81 and its Equation Operating System on a desktop computer using DOS or DOSBox.

<text>The TI-80 is a graphing calculator designed by Texas Instruments in 1995 to be used at a middle school level (grades 6-8).

The TI-80 featured a 48 x 64 dot-matrix display with a 5 x 3 pixel font, the smallest screen of any TI graphing calculator. It had the slowest processor (980 kHz) of any TI graphing calculator. The first revision of the TI-80 &#x27;A&#x27; contained a proprietary Toshiba T6M53 ASIC while subsequent revisions contained a Toshiba T6M53A. Additionally, the TI-80 had the processor on board the ASIC, unlike later calculators like the TI-83, TI-83 Plus, and TI-84 Plus which had separate ASIC and processor chips in certain models. In comparison, the TI-81, released in 1990, featured a 2 MHz Zilog Z80 processor. However, the TI-80 did feature 7 KB of RAM (compared with the TI-81&#x27;s 2.4 KB). The TI-80 also had more built-in functions than the TI-81 (such as list and table functions, as well as fraction and decimal conversions). Like the TI-81, the TI-80 did not feature a link port on the base model, however, unlike the TI-81, the ViewScreen variant (meant for use with TI&#x27;s overhead projection units) did. The TI-80 was the only graphing calculator to use 2 CR2032 lithium batteries (instead of the standard 4 AAA batteries with a lithium backup battery).

Since its release, it has been superseded by the superior TI-73 and TI-73 Explorer. The TI-80 was officially discontinued in 1998, when it was replaced by the TI-73, however, production continued until at least October 2000.

<text>Elmira College is a private college in Elmira, New York. Founded as a college for women in 1855, it is the oldest existing college granting degrees to women that were the equivalent of those given to men. Elmira College became coeducational in all of its programs in 1969. As of 2023, the college has an enrollment of approximately 657 students.

The school&#x27;s colors, purple and gold, are seen throughout the traditional campus, consisting mainly of buildings of the Victorian and Collegiate Gothic architectural styles. The colors purple and gold come from both the banners of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement and the iris, the college flower.

The octagonal study in which Mark Twain wrote many of his most widely read novels, including &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; and &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, is located on campus, and the center maintains Quarry Farm, where the Clemens family spent more than twenty summers, as a research facility for Twain scholars. Every four years the college hosts the International Conference On The State of Mark Twain Studies.

==History==

According to Thomas Woody, Elmira College is &quot;the oldest existing women&#x27;s college in the United States which succeeded in attaining standards in a fair degree comparable with men&#x27;s colleges at the very beginning of her career&quot;.Five months later, Alexander MacKenzie was suggested as a possibility for Elmira&#x27;s next president. He told the board that he was in the process of raising $100,000 with $53,000 already raised. While he wanted to remain in Owego, he accepted the presidency.

Elmira College became coeducational in 1969.

In 1995, Elmira College was sanctioned by the American Association of University Professors &quot;for infringement of governance standards&quot;.

===21st Century===

The college has an enrollment of under 850 students, down from its all time high enrollment of just under 1,200 in 2014.

Elmira College&#x27;s academic calendar contains a special six-week Spring Term, which is held in April and May. Courses taken during this term are usually not major-required, but can count as elective courses. They &quot;tend to aim at the generalized aspect of student education&quot; (Bulletin 24). However, some specialized courses are taken during this six-week period, such as lower level student teaching courses for education majors or nursing clinicals. Several courses are taught in foreign countries as part of the college&#x27;s study abroad program.

In 2016 the United States Department of Education determined the college had violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, for failure to promptly and equitably respond to complaints of sexual harassment and sexual violence. Specifically, the Office of Civil Rights investigation determined that in fifteen of the sixteen incidents reported at the college over three years, the college&#x27;s response was either in violation of Title IX or another serious concern was raised.

==Athletics==
Elmira College is a member of the NCAA, New York State Women&#x27;s Collegiate Athletic Association (NYSWCAA), ECAC, NEHC, and Empire 8. Their mascot is the Soaring Eagle. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross-country, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, tennis and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross-country, cheerleading, field hockey, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball. On July 15, 2020, the Empire 8 Conference postponed all fall sports, but will provide conference championships in those sports in Spring 2021.

The college will add both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s wrestling as intercollegiate programs for the 2020–21 academic year. Elmira College sponsored men&#x27;s wrestling in the early 1970s but the sport was later discontinued.

Elmira College holds several NCAA Division III National Championships in Women&#x27;s Ice Hockey as well as in NCA Competitive Cheerleading. Elmira College is a member of the United Collegiate Hockey Conference (UCHC) which has postponed conference competition until January 1, 2021 due to the COVID pandemic.

===Former buildings===
For eighty years, Elmira College possessed an observatory built by Professor Charles Farrar. Professor Farrar began buying telescopes for the observatory in 1859, and construction began in August 1859. The observatory first opened for use in April 1860 under the control of the Elmira Academy of Sciences. Twenty years later, control was transferred to Elmira College. Students would gather in the observatory for &quot;dome parties&quot; (102). &quot;The domed building, which occupied a triangular plot fronting on Seventh Street, stood until 1939&quot; (94).

Park Place School was housed in the observatory, and provided students with use of the college facilities. In June 1895, plans were made to construct a building specifically for the school.

There was a chapel at Elmira College, in which a memorial plaque was placed for the first dean of the college, Anna M. Bronson.

Alumnae Hall was built in 1917 as a sophomore dormitory.

The first gymnasium at the college was built in 1924. This wooden gymnasium was built as a temporary structure until a permanent one could be erected.

The school had College Apartments built a block south of Tompkins Hall in 1948.

The first incarnation of the Elmira College museum existed in Cowles Hall, but its artifacts were later moved to Gillett Memorial Hall.

MacKenzie Cottage was originally a residence built sometime around 1890. It became a dormitory in 1916.

<text>Mary Black (born 23 May 1955) is an Irish folk singer. She is well known as an interpreter of both traditional folk and modern material which has made her a major recording artist in her native Ireland.

==Background==
Mary Black was born into a musical family on Charlemont Street in Dublin, Ireland, and had four siblings. She was educated at St Louis High School, Rathmines. Her father was a fiddler, who came from Rathlin Island off the coast of Northern Ireland, and her mother was a singer. Her brothers Shay and Michael Black have their own musical group called the Black Brothers and her younger sister Frances would go on to achieve great success as a singer in the 1990s. From this musical background, Mary began singing traditional Irish songs at the age of eight. As she grew older, she began to perform with her siblings (Shay, Michael and Martin Black) in small clubs around Dublin.

==Musical career==

===1980s===

Black joined a small folk band in 1975 called General Humbert, with whom she toured Europe and released two albums, in 1975 and 1978. In 1982 she developed a professional relationship with musician/producer Declan Sinnott and recorded her first solo album, &quot;Mary Black&quot;. The album performed well in the Irish charts and it went gold. In 1983 it was honoured by the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; and it is still referred to as one of the best Irish albums of the 1980s. Black ventured into traditional Irish music with the band De Dannan and toured with them around Europe and in the US. The album she recorded with them, &quot;Anthem&quot;, won the Irish Album of the Year award. During her time with De Dannan, Black also continued with her solo career with albums such as &quot;Collected&quot; (1984) and &quot;Without the Fanfare&quot; (1985). These recordings took Black into a more modern musical direction. Along with the success of these releases, IRMA named her Entertainer of the Year in 1986 and Best Female Artist in 1987 and 1988.

For much of her early solo career, Sinnott acted as her producer, guitarist and musical director. This partnership lasted until 1995 when they parted amicably.

Black departed from De Dannan in 1986, and 1987 saw the release of her first multi-platinum Irish album, &quot;By the Time it Gets Dark&quot;. However, her popularity reached new heights with the release of the ground-breaking album, &quot;No Frontiers&quot;, in August 1989. It rocketed to the top of the Irish album charts (it stayed in the Top 30 for over a year), and achieved triple-platinum status. Mary&#x27;s popularity grew in the United States, due to several tours and widespread radio exposure.

===1990s===
Following the success of &quot;No Frontiers&quot; in the United States, and the extensive airplay received by the lead track &quot;Columbus&quot;, Black became a hit NAC recording artist. In spring 1991, she embarked on an American tour. Her 1991 release, &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot;, entered the Irish charts at No.1 once again and remained there for six weeks. Her single &quot;The Thorn Upon the Rose&quot; reached No.8 on the Japanese singles chart after it was used in a national railroad television advert. &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot; performed well in the US and it was voted one of the top 10 albums of the year in the United Kingdom by &quot;Today&quot; newspaper. The album release brought about a sell-out tour and her first concert at the Royal Albert Hall in January 1992, which was broadcast on Channel 4 a year later. She was once again named Best Female Artist by the IRMA.

Mary was featured on the cover of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine in a story hailing her as &quot;a firm favorite to join the heavy-hitting ranks of such Irish artists as Enya, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and Clannad&#x27;s Máire Brennan in the international marketplace&quot;. Her next album &quot;The Holy Ground&quot; once again reached the top of the Irish album chart. She also toured the US during October/November 1993, in support of the album. The next project saw Mary join forces with six Irish female artists to record the compilation album, &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Heart&quot;. Other artists here included her sister Frances Black, Eleanor McEvoy, Dolores Keane, Sharon Shannon and Maura O&#x27;Connell. Its good sales success spawned another album, &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Heart 2&quot;.

Black recorded two duets with American folk singer Joan Baez in the spring of 1995, for Baez&#x27;s album &quot;Ring Them Bells&quot;. A greatest hits album of Mary&#x27;s work, &quot;Looking Back&quot;, was released and she went touring mainly in the US, Germany and Scandinavia, to support the release. Black released three more albums in the 1990s, &quot;Circus&quot;, &quot;Shine&quot;, and &quot;Speaking with the Angel&quot;. She was named &quot;Best Female Artist&quot; in 1994 and 1996 for the fourth and fifth time.

===2000–present===
Black released her first live album in 2003, &quot;Mary Black Live&quot;. She also released her only studio album of the 2000s decade, &quot;Full Tide&quot;. Although it was successful, she has kept a low musical profile in the last few years. In 2008, Black released a compilation album called &quot;Twenty Five Years – Twenty Five Songs&quot; celebrating her career in the music business. It contains 4 remixed tracks, fully remastered songs and 2 brand new recordings. In 2008, Black was invited to sing a duet on Christie Hennessy&#x27;s posthumous album &quot;The Two of Us&quot; called &quot;If You Were To Fall&quot;. She also made a guest appearance on Liam Clancy&#x27;s album &quot;The Wheels of Life&quot; on the track &quot;Talk To Me of Mendocino&quot;. In 2009 she is featured on one track of Steve Martin&#x27;s album &quot;The Crow: New Songs for the 5-String Banjo&quot;. In 2011, she released a new album titled &quot;Stories from the Steeples&quot;. She has sung a duet live with Irish pop band Westlife entitled &quot;Walking in the Air&quot;.

A 2014–2015 &quot;Last Call&quot; tour with her daughter Róisín O was billed as Black&#x27;s final international tour although she intended to continue singing after this. Her autobiography &quot;Down the Crooked Road&quot; () was published in October 2014.

In 2017, Black released a remastered version of her 1987 album, &quot;By The Time It Gets Dark&quot;, to celebrate its 30th anniversary. The remastered album contains fully remixed and digitally remastered versions of the album&#x27;s tracks, a brand new song recorded especially for the re-issue called &quot;Wounded Heart&quot; and a rare b-side called &quot;Copper Kettle&quot;. Later in the year, Black released a brand new compilation album called &quot;Mary Black Sings Jimmy MacCarthy&quot; containing 6 previously recorded songs, four new tracks and one live duet with MacCarthy. Black toured in 2018 promoting the new album.

==Musical style==
For a number of years, &quot;What Hi-Fi?&quot; magazine considered Black&#x27;s voice to be so pure, that it was used as an audiophile benchmark for comparing the sound quality of different high fidelity systems. Music critic and lyricist Michael Leahy once said: &quot;Over the years, Mary Black has come to define what many people see as the essence of Irish woman singers: profound, slightly ethereal and beyond the reaches of trends.&quot; Today, Black is held in high esteem in her native Ireland and beyond and is regarded as one of the most important Irish vocalists of her generation.

==Personal life==
Mary is married to Joe O&#x27;Reilly, of Dara Records (established 1983), and they have two sons (Conor and Danny) and a daughter (Róisín). Her son Danny is a member of the Irish rock band The Coronas, while Róisín is performing under the name Róisín O. They reside in Dublin, but spend much time in County Kerry.

<text>Roland Lee Gift (born 28 May 1961) is a British musician and actor. He is the former lead vocalist of the pop rock band Fine Young Cannibals.

==Early life==
Gift was born on 28 May 1961 in the Sparkhill district of Birmingham, to an English mother and an Afro-Caribbean father. He lived in Sparkhill until the age of 11, receiving his early formal education at Anderton Park School and Arden Primary School. His family then moved to Kingston upon Hull, where his mother, Pauline, ran several second-hand clothes shops, while he was a pupil at Kelvin Hall School.

==Music career==
Gift&#x27;s first recording was as a saxophonist with Akrylykz, a ska band from Hull. The album was the second release on York&#x27;s Red Rhino Records. Although this record was unsuccessful, it did bring him to the attention of Andy Cox and David Steele of the Beat. Akrylykz toured with the Beat, which led to them, in around 1985, asking him to be the lead singer of their new band Fine Young Cannibals after their old band, the Beat, had broken up. He also was a guest artist on the Ska City Rockers&#x27; &quot;Time Is Tight&quot; single.

Gift has performed as a solo artist, appearing at the Rewind Festival in Henley. On 13 February 2012, Gift appeared on BBC Radio Solent promoting the gigs and announced a potential new album in 2012.

He also appeared in Jools Holland&#x27;s 20th annual &quot;Hootenanny&quot; show, which aired overnight on BBC2 on 31 December 2012 / 1 January 2013, the last to be recorded at BBC Television Centre. Gift sang the Fine Young Cannibals hits &quot;Good Thing&quot; and &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;. Gift was a guest vocalist on Jools Holland&#x27;s 2013 tour. 

Ten years after his first &quot;Hootenanny&quot; appearance, Gift re-appeared in Jools Holland&#x27;s annual &quot;Hootenanny&quot; show again, which aired overnight on BBC2 on 31 December 2022 / 1 January 2023. Gift sang the Fine Young Cannibals hits &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; and &quot;Good Thing&quot;.
